In the privacy of his own mind John can’t deny he had always wanted this, Sherlock was right on that account. He shouldn’t be at all surprised that Sherlock had seen his bisexuality from the very beginning, despite the fact that John had never put a label on it himself. Sherlock must have known that too, as he was uncharacteristically decent about not mentioning it.
‘You couldn’t go… home?’ He grimaces with distaste as he says the word. He will never accept that anywhere else is John’s home, despite where he might currently be living.
talk. And maybe that would be easier to do if they weren’t face to face. He’s now walked back to the main road where he can easily hail a taxi, yet he doesn’t raise his arm, he replies to his friend’s text instead.
John would have fallen to the floor if it weren’t for Sherlock’s strong hold on his arm: his legs have turned to jelly and his vision is losing focus, he realises he’s about to faint. There’s a sound in his ears reminiscent of standing in front of a waterfall, and time seems to stand still, before the white noise is shattered by the faint melodic ringing of his mobile phone. John doesn’t even try to reach for it, he’s unsure if he can even feel his hands.
‘Molly, what
Sherlock grits his teeth, fighting the urge to verbally decimate his brother over his pathetic crush on Lestrade, and his two pound weight gain. He’s helped in his endeavour by a beep coming from his inside pocket. He fishes out his phone, praying that it’s John, but it’s an unknown number.
Both Mycroft and Sherlock turn to look at him, almost as if they’d forgotten he was there. The other officers out the front of the house have all made themselves scarce, not daring to face the wrath of the Holmes brothers, nor Captain Watson.
John realises what Sherlock is trying to say, ‘Shit. Shit, shit, shit,
[Received 01:12]
When John’s tears run dry, he is ready to see his daughter for the first and last time. Sherlock leaves to give him this moment alone, both because he thinks John would want that, and because he can’t bear to see the proof that this child is gone. The child he was so looking forward to welcoming into his life, teaching the violin too, and performing experiments with. He had already been imagining her as a small version of Mary, sitting on the kitchen table in her own pair of safety goggles.
Sherlock smirks. Mycroft exhales loudly and raises his eyes to the ceiling, pinching the bridge of his nose as if to ward off the inevitable migraine. Lady Smallwood starts to say something but Sherlock cuts her off; he’s not going to put the British Government on Irene’s trail again.
The sunlight shining through the large glass patio doors illuminates the three people seated in the sparsely furnished reception room, though it fails to melt away the frosty atmosphere therein. The glow gives the room an airy and bright ambience, in stark contrast to the conversations that take place there.
John instinctively knows what he’s trying to ask. ‘I don’t want you, or Mary, to think I’m leaving her for you. I’m calling off the wedding because I love someone else more than I love my fiancée. I’ve never loved her as much as I loved you, and that wasn’t a problem while you were… gone, but now you’re here and you’ve forced me to face the harsh reality of my feelings for you. If I marry Mary now, I’ll never be happy. How can I spend time on cases with my best friend when I know I love him more than my wife?’
He throws open the door and strides out to face the press, John, as always, following dutifully behind him.
John stops at the midway point of the staircase. ‘You’d have to be an idiot not to see it. You love it.’
killed John’s wife and child? This involves him as much as it does us.’
‘As you’ve probably guessed, she was a dominatrix.’ Lestrade makes Sherlock jump as he speaks, having approached him unheard. He’s not surprised that the D.I. remembers Irene - he’s a red blooded heterosexual male, after all. What
‘It’s none of my business, John, but in my day, men didn’t leave their pregnant wives.’
me from all official records, and encouraged Sherlock to delete me from his mind. You wiped my existence away without a care in the world.’
Sherlock closes the last remaining distance between them and presses his plump lips against John’s dry mouth: a firm pressure giving the impression of a confidence he doesn’t feel. It’s not romantic, or sexual in any way, no more than a chaste touch of lips, but to Sherlock it’s everything and all he can think of is that John hasn’t pulled away. In fact, he’s
John tilts his head slightly to the side and frowns at Sherlock in that way he does when he’s failing to grasp a social norm. Sherlock looks down, suitably chastised as he realises John returning to Mary to think about having kissed Sherlock would probably cross a line of what is morally acceptable.
‘Please’, Mycroft insists.
her! Get her back here, Mycroft, I want to
mad?! No… don’t answer that.’ John takes a deep calming breath, ‘What’s going on?’
‘I shall pass on your regrets.’
John is now standing directly opposite him in the narrow space behind the front door. He’s so close he can feel Sherlock’s breath in his hair. ‘I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.’
yet he still spent every day trying to convince me to forgive you and move back in with you.’ He doesn’t say move back
‘I needed someone who didn’t already know me, didn’t know about everything I went through with you. It was supposed to be about me and Mary. Of course, it still ended up being about you’, he laughs softly.
‘Hey, hang on a minute.’
‘I’ve heard just about enough from you over the last two months’, she complains, stepping back, taking in the light and the space around them. Removing a mobile phone from her pocket, she snaps a photo of her captive, ensuring there is enough showing in the background for an intelligent man to identify their location. Not happy with her first attempt, she turns the flash on, taking a few more. John’s eyes screw shut against the light, making him look terrified.
‘Christ.’
‘I did. And I should probably be speaking to Mary first, but quite frankly I’m a coward’, he holds his hand up to stop Sherlock’s attempt to interrupt, ‘No, I am. When it comes to telling my fiancée that I just kissed my best friend, I’m a coward. So, I’m here.’
'Oh, don’t be stupid.’
He waits for a reaction to the news, but it’s nothing Sherlock hadn’t already worked out for himself on the way here. Despite having no conscious memory of her, he instinctively knew the killer was his sister, not another brother. He scratches at his arm again, catching himself this time. ‘Eurus. The east wind’, he says, obviously knowledgeable in Greek mythology, just as he is knowledgeable about almost everything else. The east wind. Why is that familiar?
‘John, if Magnussen blows Mary’s cover, you’ll be at risk. Especially if they can’t find her. The people she’s hurt, the families of those she’s killed – they will come for you.’
How on earth did I not see that for what it was?’
John’s vision becomes blurry as his eyes prickle with tears. He plays absentmindedly with the platinum ring on his left hand, a coping mechanism he uses to ground himself when he is struggling with emotions. He hates to think of what might have been. He has Sherlock now, and they have both never been happier.
Mary looks hurt and John is surprised to see such a vulnerable expression on her face. He feels a little guilty, though he does have to wonder if it’s an act. She’s fooled him so many times before, he rarely doesn’t truly believe she has an honest bone in her body. But he has to try… for the baby. Tenderly he takes her hands, ‘I’m sorry. I’m

My mother puts the shopping on the table, opens her coat, then puts the kettle on. She also wouldn’t have realised she was starting to bleed. When she hangs up her coat she is already dizzy, missing the coat peg. Bending to pick it up she sees the blood which is now coming faster.

nine months pregnant. Still, finalising their daughter’s room seemed to bring them somewhat closer together; a sentiment that is mirrored in their positions on the sofa; closer to the middle than they were the previous week.
haven’t moved on from what happened to Sherlock, you’ve just announced that you trust him more than me, and I’m fat, hormonal, and miserable.’
Sherlock gets a dot of gravy on his chin when using his hands to eat a Yorkshire pudding. Without thinking, John reaches out and wipes it with his finger, licking the sauce from the top of his digit. Mycroft clears his throat. Sherlock feels the heat rise to his cheeks.
‘I want to do all I can for you, but it’s very hard for me to help you when you won’t be entirely honest about the problems that bring you here. You speak of betrayal, yet there are many different types of betrayal, and each has a different severity that is entirely dependent on the people involved. How can I guide you through it if I don’t know what
‘Mary.’ John warns.
only just found out about the tea pots’, he responds, now adding to the case wall the relevant entries from John’s blog, along with the comments. ‘I had a suspicion, but I needed to see if someone else would pick up on the connection… to be sure I wasn’t seeing patterns where there weren’t any. I’ve often been accused of wanting things to be too clever.’
Well… I did.
John had returned home on Wednesday evening after a long day of digging into the background of their shooting victim and his last passenger, Miriam Evans. After failing to find anything of significance, Sherlock had all but shelved the case, as he had little to go on, but by Saturday he was bored enough to follow up with Lestrade, who had interviewed the wife and eldest daughter of Steven Horningsea.
‘Lestrade has identified the victim: Steven Horningsea, forty-two, married, father of three, been a London cab driver for twenty years. No criminal record. I read over Molly’s report last night. Autopsy showed no signs of any drug use, past or present. I also asked her to pull out the paperwork for the autopsy of Jeff Hope. Turns out she conducted that one, too.’ He pauses before imparting the most interesting information, ‘John, this isn’t just a similar shot, it’s
'You know my methods, John. I am known to be indestructible.’
‘Whoa! Wasn’t expecting that.’ John turns in Sherlock’s arms so they are facing each other, and they both begin to sway to music only they can hear.
Sherlock can’t work out what’s going on with John, but he’s acting most strange. First the polite request to visit, and now the quiet insistence that not only will Sherlock eat, he will do it at the kitchen table! They
Sighing, he opens his eyes and takes his phone from his inside jacket pocket, planning to send a quick message to John to test the waters.
Mycroft heaves a put-upon sigh, ‘Brother mine, the best thing you can do at this juncture is be there for John’, he says, with an uncharacteristic fondness. ‘Please, leave me to do my job.’ he hangs up without waiting for a response.
Sherlock sticks out his tongue, relishing how easy it still is to wind John up.
‘I’m an idiot! It’s not a wall, it’s a garage door!’ he shouts, frustrated at how long it took him to see what is now glaringly obvious. ‘That doesn’t help find him, though, does it? Do you know how many garages there are in Greater London? ’ he pauses in his tirade as Mycroft lifts up his umbrella, pointing at the “sold” sign in the garden of the house next-door: one of the few houses on this street that hadn’t converted their garage into another living space.
‘Let’s hope you’re right. John is gonna need all the support he can get. Christ.’ Lestrade wipes the back of his hand over his eyes, unsurprised to find it wet. Mycroft reaches out, placing a hand on the D.I.’s shoulder, and they both take a minute before Lestrade returns to the scene in front of him. There’s no time for grieving when there’s a spree killer on the loose.

‘Your plan was never
John drops his piece of naan bread onto his lap, staring open-mouthed at the TV. ‘Jesus Christ. Was this..? Was this
‘Okay’, Sherlock mumbles like a petulant child. He closes his eyes, afraid to watch John walk away once more.
‘You can’t blame –
Mycroft orders, hooking Sherlock’s arm with the handle of his umbrella to stop him running off without them, ‘The garage door will be locked; she wouldn’t want us going in that way, where anyone on the street could see inside. She must have taken him out through the garden gates, and into the neighbour’s back door. We follow her footsteps.’
‘I expect so’, Sherlock replies, not altogether unprepared for this eventuality. ‘It wasn’t me’, he smirks.
film, which Sherlock finds so dull he falls asleep twenty minutes in.
‘I knew you were bisexual when I first met you, just as I knew that you’d never act on it. You were attracted to me and clearly interested in taking things further but at the time it wasn’t what I thought I wanted. That, and I assumed that you would probably panic if I took you up on it. Quite correctly I might add.’ He smirks, pleased with himself when he sees the heat flush John's cheeks.
‘You were amazing today, Sher’, he manages to say, voice thick with emotion. ‘I appreciate it more than you can know. Couldn’t have got through it without you.’
‘Really?’
That had been meant for Mary. Obviously it had.
‘Two meals in the course of a week is unlikely to put any fat on you, especially with all the running around you do. Speaking of which, any joy on the case?’
Mary sits up, hand on her protruding belly.
‘Not hungry.’
It’s seven o’clock that evening before John steps off the tube at Baker Street station, having returned home after work to ask if Mary minded him staying the night, and to pack a bag. He knows there’s little chance of them finishing before midnight, and he doesn’t have to work Wednesday’s. There was a time when he would have left work at the first signs of a new case, but he has responsibilities now, he can’t just jump every time Sherlock texts, however much he might want to escape the oppressive silence that is his marriage these days. Despite the comments Mary made in counselling, she was surprisingly supportive of his decision to go, as long as he kept the volume up on his phone, for any baby related emergencies.
John makes the appointment with the receptionist, and catches up with Mary on the street outside. She’s walking away, despite the fact that they’ll need a cab to get home. John steps in front of her.
Sherlock holds his wine glass up towards John’s. ‘We met thirty years ago today. Thirty years, John. I’m a certified genius but even I can’t understand how that is even possible.’
‘How come there’s no record of Sherlock having a sister? If there was, we would have come across it by now. I know you Holmes’ think Scotland Yard is full of thick prats, but we’re pretty good at detective work.’
[Sent 21:13]
His last fare had been a nightmare: a batty old woman who had talked about her cats incessantly for the full forty minute drive. At least she’d paid him extra to convince him to break his “no south of the river after nine pm” rule. He sighed as he pulled into a parking space at the end of Porlock Street;
Sherlock blinks, amazed at the feel of John’s lips on his skin. His brain has gone offline, and for a moment he forgets where they are and what’s going on. Thankfully, John is a little more aware. ‘We should go in. We’ll have some explaining to do.’
‘He told me she was shot in the chest as she let herself into your home. She called the police but died before she could finish the call. It was quick, John’, she attempts to reassure. ‘I’m sorry but you’ll have to wait for the autopsy before I can tell you more. I’ll do it right away, but John… you don’t want to be here for that. Let me do what I can for them now. Come back first thing in the morning and I’ll have my report for you.’
‘Let me go now. Let’s spend a few weeks -’
are. Always have been. You can’t sell state secrets to a man like Magnussen just to protect Mary, or whatever the hell her name is. Actions like that have serious bloody consequences.’
and you can go back to failing to solve dull crimes of passion.’
‘He’ll talk. He owes me an explanation.’ Whether John is talking about the last two years or the kiss in the hallway, Sherlock isn’t sure.
The meal ends rather abruptly after that, nobody having much of an appetite any longer. Sherlock is annoyed that the drugged punch he had prepared earlier will likely go untouched, the mood being somewhat incompatible with alcohol. He’ll have to dose their afternoon tea instead. Hopefully John won’t be too suspicious when he offers to make it.
‘Yeah – I… needed to think.’
‘More or less. Yet both shots shattered the coracoid process, tearing through the coracoacromial ligament, and nicking the axillary artery.’
Sherlock’s eyes glaze over as he contemplates this and says, ‘They must be particularly vast. He has an impressive amount of data on a lot of people. Plenty about me that’s not on record; presumably acquired from Mary through blackmail.’ He avoids looking at John’s hurt expression. ‘The way he can recite information about anyone he’s looking at means he must have a digital filing system nearly as impressive as my mind palace, and it’s somehow linked to his glasses…’ He looks equal parts impressed and begrudging of the idea that another person could have so much information on other people without having to delete facts about the solar system to make room for it.
‘Sally can take charge of the forensic team. I’ve already spoken to Molly Hooper, she knows what’s happened and she’s going to do the PM’s this afternoon.’ He turns to Sherlock, putting a supportive hand on his shoulder, ‘She sends her condolences.’
‘What is it?’ Lestrade asks, before Sherlock shows him the image and the accompanying text. ‘Shit, right, I’ll get a trace on it.’
‘Obvious. As soon as they got in, my father would have gone to the bathroom, removing his belt of course, and almost always leaving it looser while he was around the house. He would have started bleeding before he sat at the table, though it’s doubtful he noticed. Nobody ever
Dr Farrell has attempted to get her patients to open up about the betrayal they alluded to, but has to back away to more positive topics each time they clam up. Positive topics are hard to come by with this pair, though. Mrs Watson appears rather self-centred and shows very little real regard for her husband, and her emotional displays are clearly nothing but good acting. Now that their session is almost up, she is trying to approach the subject again.
They return to the living room where the wedding talk is still in full swing; the ladies squashed together on the sofa talking about the colours and the flowers, and Lestrade is sitting in the chair by their side, looking as though he’d rather be anywhere else. Sherlock picks up another bottle from the coffee table, popping the cork and filling Greg’s glass, earning him a grateful smile. Sherlock tunes into Mrs. Hudson’s excited twittering.
‘We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it – together.’ John puts his hands on Sherlock’s arms, holding him still. ‘We’ll protect her, or jail her for shooting you! We can work with Mycroft, make a case against Magnussen. You don’t go up against him alone. And definitely not with a gun!’
‘Not in the slightest. I’m trying to keep my anger in check, that’s all. You killed my family and I would love to get my hands on you.’
Mrs Hudson ushers Mary downstairs, much to Mary’s annoyance – she clearly wanted to argue more and doesn’t want to leave without her fiancé. Mrs H looks back and winks at John, closing the door behind her.
‘Holy fuck!’ is Lestrade’s response, earning them the stares of the forensics team, the very thing that Mycroft was trying to avoid. ‘Are you sure?’
‘I bet you haven’t made tea though.’
The bedroom, in contrast to the grey floral design in the rest of the property, has a deep purple feature wall behind the bed; though it is far from the “feature” in the room at present.
‘Of course she is. You know she’s always trying to fatten me up’, Sherlock responds, taking in John’s haggard appearance;
Mary hadn’t been reticent on her turn either, saying she felt abandoned when John moved out for five months during the pregnancy, only a month after getting married, and communicating only through occasional text messages. Though she had conveniently glossed over the real reason.
‘Of course.’ Greg responds, taking in everything Sherlock has said in his mile-a-minute speech. ‘You think that’s what the killer is copying this time?’
John can feel his blood boil at the mention of her name.
John slowly moves towards him leaving Sherlock with nowhere to go. ‘I made a little speech. I actually spoke to you.’
‘Sherlock. Doctor Watson. I see you’ve heard the news.’
After another glass of champagne, Greg Lestrade is starting to enjoy the infectious laughter from the three women on the sofa. Mary seems to get on well with Molly and Mrs. Hudson and she has a sharp sense of humour that Greg appreciates, and a keen intelligence that reminds him of Sherlock.
‘Sherlock?’ John asks. ‘You’re doing the blinky thing again.’ He gently nudges his friend’s shoulder, ‘Don’t worry, there won’t be any actual religion involved, I promise.’ The blinking begins to slow. John takes a few spoonfuls of his stew before trying again. ‘Sherlock?’
‘It’s over’, he sighs.
‘I… I did – yeah.’
‘I’ve really missed this, you know? A good curry, working a case, Mrs Hudson cooing over us, the mess, the fear of what’s in the fridge…’
‘Mary Watson is under our protection, at your request. She will get a new identity and be taken far away from Magnussen.’
The violin should help take his mind off the interminable waiting. If he hasn’t heard anything in an hour, he’ll go round there and drag John out himself.
. It’s light, barely there really, but it
‘I think, in this case, the choice of victim was the link to me. Mary
‘No, you didn’t!’
‘He – er… wanted to be a pirate, when he was a kid.’ John answers for him. He looks guilty to be sharing such a personal detail, though it appears pertinent to the case. Lestrade giving a shy smile at the thought of a young curly-haired Sherlock playing pirates with his dog. Sherlock catches the look and huffs, irritated, turning on his heel and striding out of the bedroom. He finds his brother resting against the wall next to the living room, finishing up a call, and he walks right up to him, not stopping until they are toe to toe, with no room for Mycroft to back away.
Clad in his trademark black suit and white faintly pinstriped shirt, he’s reclined in a soft leather chair in the centre of the room, a plate of quickly depleting gingernuts at his side, facing Lady Smallwood who is seated alone behind a large glass desk. Mycroft is standing between him and the door as though afraid he might bolt. As if that fat tub of lard could stop him if he made a run for it. Why must the man insist on wearing those three piece suits when the waistcoat makes him look grossly overweight. Maybe it holds everything in with an inbuilt girdle. Sherlock chokes on a biscuit at the image that thought provides, and Mycroft glares at him, reading his thoughts in a single glance, and rolling his eyes while subtly pulling in his stomach and standing taller.
‘Oh, big brother, do you really think your emails are secure?’
do that. He clearly didn’t follow it up, but he closed the investigation without looking anywhere else.’
‘Thank Christ for that’, he releases a sigh of relief. ‘Tell me what you’ve found.’
‘You’re probably right, but I wouldn’t want to be caught without clean boxers’, he chuckles at Sherlock’s horrified expression. ‘Anyway, I’m here now. So, tell me about the case,’ he says, setting out the various food packages on the table.
‘Then why don’t you want me to take it?’
him. John’s aborted proposal was all but forgotten.
‘These tokens are linked to me, to my childhood. Nobody else could know those details
‘I had a red setter when I was a child. Redbeard.’
Sally heads over, biting her tongue to hold in the complaint that Sherlock’s brother is
‘I’ll always be here for you, John.’
‘Oh yes,
‘Sherlock.’ John groans, but there’s affection lacing his words as he realises the reason Sherlock is so adamant. ‘I’m not going to change my mind, okay? It’s safe to let me out of your sight, I promise.’
It’s then that Sherlock realises his mistake. Eurus was never really after him; she wanted Mycroft. Telling Sherlock to come alone, knowing full well he would bring Mycroft. He’s been an
He’s not yet quite desperate enough to call Mycroft and face his derision.
‘Soo Lin Yao!’
‘Where is she, Mycroft?’
‘You’re gonna clear up?’ he says when his breathing has returned to normal, smiling and attempting to lighten the mood. ‘That’ll be the day.’
‘Sherlock, Mary isn’t pregnant, she’s no longer my wife, and she’s not my pressure point.
John gazes at me, amazed, as he listens to me explain how I can possibly deduce so much from a door handle. Obvious, really, but it’s been quite some time since I’ve been able to show off to another (living) human being.
Day by day the John that Sherlock loves starts to emerge from his shell and they begin sharing breakfasts together the way they did when they were flatmates. John hasn’t mentioned going home or back to work. Slowly John begins to spend more time downstairs with Sherlock, bantering over the crap telly and eating far too much take away. Mrs Hudson has been mothering them more than usual. After Sherlock brings John toast and tea in bed, John finally calls him out on how weird it is to be looked after by him – cooking, cleaning, tidying, and dragging John out for walks. Sherlock is somewhat put out, feeling that his efforts aren’t appreciated, but John’s smile let’s him know that he’s joking.
She sighs, ‘Don’t make me angry, John. It’s really not wise when we are discussing whether I keep you alive or not. I feel very strongly about betrayal, you know.’
‘What the hell??’ John demands, all feelings of pity for Mycroft vanishing quicker in the blink of an eye.
he nearly died twice to protect Mary, and almost threw his life away to keep her safe. Her and our baby.’
Lestrade manages to jump out of his chair without falling on his arse, pulling on his jacket, his breakfast discarded on the desk. ‘Address?’
‘You bastard! You fucking-’ John starts, but finds he can’t articulate just how angry he is. Actions speak louder than words, and he would have liked to get a few more hits in. He’s done. He’s so done with this
‘But who would have known about him and the exact placement of the shot that killed him? The officers on the scene?
Mary smiles softly, relieved. In all honesty she thought it would be harder to convince John to forget her past. Maybe they will get through this. A tear escapes from her eye and lands on their joined hands before she Mary brushes it away with her thumb. She starts to move in for the kiss that will seal the end of that chapter and the beginning of their new life together.
He takes a deep breath in, cognisant of the fact he’s on the borderline of a panic attack. What the hell had Sherlock been playing at? Was it some kind of game? Sherlock has never paid much attention to socially acceptable behaviour, but even he must realise that kissing his best friend, who had just got engage to someone else, was more than a bit not good. How the hell were they ever going to get passed this? He was planning to ask Sherlock to be his best man! Christ, that would have been a disaster.
Mycroft doesn’t respond, but he tilts his head and quirks an eyebrow. Sherlock frowns in response, annoyed. John is used to the brothers’ silent conversations by now, and he takes these expressions to mean that there is an agent on Mary, though he can’t be sure if it’s for her own protection… or for Sherlock’s.
‘I’m going to wait here and call for backup. I’ll tell the forensic team to hold off, and request an armed unit do a silent approach. With any luck she doesn’t know I’m here. May take a while to get mobilised though, so try not to perform any heroics in there’, Lestrade warns, not joking at all.
‘I’m so sorry, Mycroft.’ Greg puts a hand on his arm in an attempt to be supportive. The government man looks down, unaccustomed to being touched, and when he meets Greg’s eyes the detective can see the shine of unshed tears. Mycroft looks shaken, knuckles white on the handle of his umbrella. Lestrade has never seen him looking so… human. Caring is not an advantage, indeed, but it seems the elder Holmes isn’t immune.
‘She’s a liar.’
The blood has soaked through the mattress to the floor below. Sherlock had been expecting another shooting when Lestrade had called him in; the last thing he expected to see was the sight before him now. The victim’s severed head rests under her right arm, the eyes wide open. There’s a pair of suspiciously blood free, violin-shaped earrings, hanging from her lobes. Sherlock takes a deep breath in, momentarily dizzy. His mind races with thoughts of Irene Adler, and the fate that had so nearly befallen her. Never before has a crime scene affected him like this.
Mary nods, eyes downcast, and when John moves closer to hug her, she leans forward and kisses his cheek, hiding her face against his neck. They stand there, in the middle of the busy street, the perfect picture of the happy expectant couple.
They front door slamming halts the conversation, and suddenly there is six-feet of pissed off consulting detective barging into the room, hair in disarray from the hat he has ripped off and thrown down in the hallway. John rushes in behind him, looking equally annoyed but trying not to show it in front of his friends. He’s uncomfortable too. Something about the press conference has upset them both, cutting the interview short after only ten minutes. Mary may not be a genius detective but even she can deduce that the press must have questioned the nature of John’s relationship with Sherlock. The two of them are like an open book.
‘Burglary?’ John enquires.
This is an argument they’ve had many times before, in the months before Sherlock jumped: John stating that the money belonged to Sherlock, and Sherlock countering that John’s blog had brought in many of their paying customers. John had acquiesced somewhat, but had balked at the idea of sharing the large payment given to them by Sebastian Wilkes, a friend of Sherlock’s from university, not a client from the blog. Considering the way the case ended, Sherlock had told John he could consider it a payment for damages. John laughed when his friend asked if he should pay something to Sarah, too.
‘Oh shut up, you git, I’m going. You know, despite the fact that you’re a complete arse, it’s been good to be here with you again, working a case.’
‘Don’t I know it’, John mutters. ‘I’ll make an appointment out front. Thanks.’
‘Why did you do it, Sherlock? I need to know why you did it.’
When we eventually enter a miraculously cleaned up 221B, John takes off his coat and opens the top two buttons of his shirt, winking at me when he catches me watching him. The heat rises to my cheeks and somewhat flustered (I don’t
‘You know what I was trying to achieve.’ Sherlock rolls his eyes at what he considers to be Mycroft’s dramatics. ‘Charles Augustus Magnussen needs to be stopped. Not just for Mary, but for John. And for all the people that are “different” that he preys on.’
‘Not our jurisdiction: some posh cottage in Bramber…
as if she knows him better than John, and that gets on John’s nerves more than it should. 'Come on, John. Let's leave him in peace.'
case: Irene isn’t dead.’
isn’t ready to accept Sherlock’s feelings for him. Maybe those two years apart have made it impossible for them to move forward. He’s truly the idiot that Mycroft always insists he is. He shouldn’t have kissed John, shouldn’t have pushed him to confront something he never wanted to confront. He has Mary now (damn you, Mary), he’s moved on, and maybe Sherlock has just ruined any progress they may have made towards restoring their old friendship.
to kill him. But she did, didn’t she? I was right there when he flatlined. I called you…’ Pain flashes in both pairs of eyes at the memory. ‘I was never going to forgive her for that. Never. I’m so sorry I brought her into your home.’

Listen to me. Why don’t you take a shower and get dressed while I clear up the food and get these stuck up on the wall. Then we can go over everything properly. Yes? I’ll even make another pot of tea.’
well, this is fun.
'Yeah’, John agrees, but he’s looking at Mary not Sherlock, and there’s no fondness in
‘Maybe’, he shakes away then memories, desperate to change the subject. ‘I don’t think I ever asked you; did you have a favourite case?’
Sherlock is rabid, teeth bared, cheeks wet, as he fights, ‘Let me
? She’s doing it for the illusion of height, to play a role, but they aren’t really her style. Next she removes the wig, releasing her natural dark auburn curls, and sets aside the glasses and the fake coloured contact lenses, letting her piercing green eyes shine. Wiping off the carefully applied make-up reveals a pretty face at least a decade younger than she first appeared. Sipping from a glass of red she’d discovered in the house she’s currently staying in, she stretches her legs out on the chaise-longue in the bedroom, enjoying the feel of the silk pyjamas she’d found in the master closet. She could get used to this. But, alas, it will not last. She has a future planned out for her and Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock looks unimpressed, rolling his eyes.
As expected, Sherlock responds in a fraction of a second, as though he had the message already prepared to send. He probably did.
They talk about therapy. Unbeknownst to John, Sherlock has been seeing Ella, and is surprised to admit she’s helped. He asks John why he chose not to see her for his counselling with Mary.
On the black four-poster bed lies a young woman, shackled, wearing a fishnet body stocking. Her breasts are bare; a riding crop resting between them. There’s a pair of black patent courts on the floor at the base of the bed, one beneath each post, clearly having fallen off her feet as she struggled. And she
‘It’s likely, I think. AGRA was a… professional name, but it’s possible that one of the letters was her true name. I agree, the R now seems the most likely.’
‘It’s okay’, Sherlock promises him.
Sherlock jumps out of the cab on the corner of Porlock Street, just before the line of police cars, Belstaff flowing out behind him like a cape. He pushes past the press already gathered, and ignores the police officers doing a bad job of guarding the scene, as he ducks under the tape. It feels indescribably good to be out on a case again, even if it does only rank at a four (he’s being generous, it’s probably only a two).
John places a cup on Sherlock’s side table, lightly touching his shoulder to attract his attention before settling into his own disused and dusty chair, and taking a long sip of his tea.
he’s done for me – for us – I just…’
‘It’s quite… crowded in here.’
‘So what, you think someone wanted to kill somebody and is trying to cover up their motive by making it look like the… vigilante that killed Jeff Hope five years ago?’
‘Yes, I think that was the first time you had completely wiped something from your mind. It helped that all traces of Eurus were removed from the house, and nobody ever mentioned her. After she had been gone a year I began to tell you the story about the east wind coming to get you. I was testing you, to see if you remembered her at all. You never did.’
The ringing of Sherlock’s phone interrupts them, earning him another angry glare from Mycroft. The device had been vibrating with messages all morning, though he had ignored them as he prepared his case for this meeting. Fighting for his continued existence seemed more important, but now he’s won that round, he pulls it out to see who’s calling, hoping it’s John. Despite protocol dictating that no mobile phones be brought into these top secret meetings, searching Mycroft Holmes’ brother is not a job anybody wants to have. Thankfully for him. He answers when he sees who it is.
‘For God’s sake, he’s
‘Eurus… I was a complicated child, with a lot of complex needs, and our parents already had their hands full with me’, Sherlock says, repeating the information he had been given by Mycroft. ‘Then you came along, so intelligent and needing support that they couldn’t give. It wasn’t that they didn’t love you, I was just… a lot.’
‘For not going. For choosing me instead of the case. I know it’s not the first time you’ve done that, and I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you for it.’ John takes a step closer to him; the hand on Sherlock’s back sliding down to take hold of his hand. ‘There’s a lot I should be thanking you for.’
‘For the umpteenth time, Sherlock, I am investigating a lead! You’re slowing down my progress with your incessant phone calls.

‘There’s no need, John. Your clothes are in the wash, they’ll be dry by morning. Stay tonight. You still don’t look particularly healthy, and you should eat something, which you won’t if you go home.’
Sherlock gets up and gently closes the door, knowing John won’t be back.
Sherlock chuckles to himself as John heads into the bathroom, pleased he managed to make John laugh again. Having been used to John’s habits when they lived together, he knows he’ll be in the shower for around forty-seven minutes, assuming he doesn’t masturbate (which Sherlock is decidedly

‘The ballistics report came in just before you got up. The round was a .380ACP from a Walther PPK, fitted with a silencer.’
As they walk together, closely, their hands repeatedly brush together, John trying to link their fingers as Sherlock attempts to keep them apart. John is always affectionate and touchy feely when he’s had a drink, and it makes Sherlock uncomfortable, especially now.
I didn’t ask for a divorce. I want to work through this.’
‘Greg’, John says, ‘Aren’t you needed here?’
where my loyalties lie.’
‘Would a bad shot choose a gun as a way of dispatching their victim?’
about the timing of it –
‘I met Magnussen while I was in hospital. I promised to deliver my brother’s laptop to him, for a fee. He wants Mycroft. Mycroft’s pressure point is me, mine is you, and yours is your “pregnant” wife. If Magnussen owns Mary, he owns Mycroft. But if he has Mycroft, he no longer needs Mary. This’, he waves the laptop, ‘is the price we pay to keep Mary safe.’
Naturally she told everyone that you’d destroyed your violin, and Mummy believed her, but I knew you loved it more than you loved anything, and the incident reignited my previous concern that someone had been hurting you. I began to follow the two of you everywhere.’
- to find his dinner being presented to him by a tall, curly-haired chap, in a very recognisable coat.
‘He’s in shock, he won’t speak or cry. Mrs Hudson, I don’t know what to do’, Sherlock is loath to admit.
I realise that John has turned out to be far more useful than I originally thought. One might say he saved my life. Of course, that would be wrong, I chose the correct pill, though his actions still cause a fluttering feeling in my stomach that I cannot identify.
It takes far too long for them to stagger to the top of the first set of stairs and John stops before ascending further to his room.
‘Exactly.’
very particular about his tea.
They pull apart just enough to walk into the cottage with their arms around each other.
The snow has begun to thaw, leaving an icy sludge on the ground beneath their feet, soaking into the clothes of the man that can no longer feel their chill. Sherlock crouches beside the body, mindful of the pool of blood beneath him, more concerned for his shoes than the forensics, yet paying no care to the damp absorbed into the bottom of his coat where it sweeps the pavement.
‘You are a
‘Well, we all know how you feel about him, don’t we?’
‘There’s no A&E at Barts!’ John yells in frustration.
John laughs despite himself. Most people might consider that sarcasm, but John knows Sherlock is completely serious.
‘Come on, get out your laptop. Let’s see what we can dig up on the victim. You know you’re far better at this than the Yard.’
When Mrs Hudson has calmed down enough to form coherent sentences, she asks how John is doing.
Drugs are, of course, out of the question, and he’s trying not to smoke so John can’t complain that he
‘Are you?’ Sherlock looks surprised at the both topic and the notion that this particular case matters to his elder brother.
The ever loyal Anthea is in the study next door, her own laptops hacking their way into confidential files no-one should have access to. She is, as always, up to date on anything and everything that involves her boss, and by extension his little brother, and Mycroft knows she is one-hundred-percent trustworthy. But even with Anthea on the case, the wheels of bureaucracy take their time.
‘Cock.’
‘Eurus loved watching Sherlock play the violin’, Mycroft continues with the story, ‘she wanted to learn, and she wanted him to teach her. When he refused, she took his beautiful antique instrument and stamped on it until it was nothing but dust. Sherlock didn’t speak for a month after that incident.’
‘Why? Because you got to share a bed with me for the first time?’ he winks.
Ten days later and the boys are together on the sofa, digging into a curry. Sherlock is actually eating with gusto, and John can’t stop smiling at him. Their… relationship… has progressed slowly since their confessions at Christmas; there has been some touching, caressing, and some cringeworthy flirting, but nothing more. They are both just happy to be here, together, and they don’t need to rush.
‘I made tea’, he says softly, stating the obvious rather than risk inadvertently saying the wrong thing. He waits for John to acknowledge his presence and when he doesn’t, he crouches down to put his face at John’s eye level. Said eyes are open and staring ahead but not really seeing. ‘John?’ Sherlock asks again, still receiving no response. He’s at a loss, ‘I’ll leave your tea there… If you want something to eat… No, of course you don’t’, he rambles, desperately trying to find the right thing to say, anything that might prompt a reaction from his friend.
‘What do you want, Eurus?’ Sherlock asks, eyes never leaving John’s. He sees his friend blink once, slowly; his only way of saying “I’m okay”.
[Sent 02:16]
. They had talked about how they had met, married, and fallen pregnant, with ease, but when Dr Farrell asked them what had prompted them to seek counselling, they spoke over each other.
‘No.’ Sherlock opens his eyes, staring John down. ‘You kissed back. For a moment you forgot that Mary even existed and you
‘Though I have never fired one either, I do believe I have some experience with that particular weapon,’ Sherlock states, rubbing the fingers of his right hand over the scar on his chest. ‘I was also lucky that the bullet stayed in my body, and even more fortunate that you were there.’
John takes the tray from Sherlock, leaving him waiting awkwardly in the doorway whilst he puts the plate on the small table.
‘How can it not be apparent, for god’s sake.’
.’ He puts his head in his hands, wincing when he puts pressure on his swollen nose.
‘Don’t, Sherlock. It’s not your fault. None-’ he hiccups, feeling a little sick at the sour taste of the whisky retracing it’s steps up his oesophagus. ‘None of this is your fault.’
Is this a joke, John?’
‘I can still remember the look on Lestrade’s face when I brought you to that crime scene’, Sherlock laughs.
Mycroft hangs up the phone, putting it back in the inside pocket of his jacket, his eyes locked firmly on Sherlock’s. John is watching them, flicking his gaze from one to the other, trying to pick up on what’s being said telepathically.
‘I wonder if -’ they both start at the same time, huffing out a laugh. Sherlock nods his head indicating for John to speak.
John just pouts.
was home now, his life in the suburbs with Mary, not Baker Street, not Sherlock. Yet the message makes perfect sense for Sherlock too; I’m sorry I stormed out, I’m coming back. And part of John is too weary to even attempt to pretend he didn’t mean for that to happen. Maybe he just wanted plausible deniability.
Sherlock frowns at the juvenile idea of “dating”, but secretly knows he’ll be happy to go along with it because it’s John.
‘I moved out for months because she shot you, Sherlock. It wasn’t about her lies and her past, it was about what she did to you.’ He sees the look on Sherlock’s face and reassures him, ‘Obviously I didn’t tell the therapist that, but Mary knew.’ He sighs and puts his head into his hands, ‘I should go back to her, shouldn’t I? Dr Farrell, I mean. She knew Mary, it makes sense to stick with her, and I… need to see someone, I think.’
What was it you said?
‘How on Earth do you know that?’ Greg asks, in the incredulous tone of voice that is his default when dealing with Sherlock.
‘That’s enough, Sherlock, come on’, John tries again, ‘There’s no need for you to be here now.’
just to give you what I gave “Mary”. She betrayed my brother’s trust, she
‘Are you okay?’ he asks his friend.
The room descends into awkward silence, and for the remainder of the meal nothing is heard except the scraping of cutlery against plates. Sherlock’s mind can’t stop replaying the words John had said to him and obsessing over the easy affection he is showing now that he has called time on his troubled marriage. It’s really not the time for Sherlock to be coming to terms with his emotions with regards to John, and he feels like his head might implode from the pressure.
‘Thai?’
‘Yes, plenty, thank you very much. I flew through the first few cases but then I got to the bombing case. Where we first met Moriarty.’ He averts his eyes so that Sherlock can’t see the pain in them. ‘It’s hard to write about him, considering everything that came later.’
Oh well.
Mary laughs, ‘Ha! No.’ She continues to chuckle to herself while John speaks over her.
‘Forensics are on their way -.’
John immediately bolts from the sofa in the direction of the door, Sherlock’s arm shooting out to stop him from fleeing without hearing what Mycroft has to say. John almost snarls at Sherlock, trying to pull away, before realising for himself that he needs to know where he’s going.
He takes my hand as we peruse the dessert menu and before I know it I’m offering to share a tiramisu. When he licks his lips I’m suddenly very aware of certain parts of my transport making themselves known.
Sherlock stares at the door blankly after John rushes down the stairs. He knows he’s not the most perceptive man when it comes to emotions, but where did he do wrong? He deduced John would likely storm out when Sherlock first aired the truth about his sexuality, but the doctor had taken that rather well (barely raised an eyebrow, in fact). Somehow it was John’s own confession of his love for Sherlock that seemed too much for him to cope with. Interesting.
‘Dealt with it?’
Besides, they aren’t exactly working the case right now. The folder stays closed on the table, with Molly’s autopsy report unread inside. Sherlock isn’t even tempted to pick it up, simply enjoying John’s company and reminiscing over their past cases. John can’t remember the last time he had an evening as relaxed as this, and with a baby on the way it will probably be a while before he gets another one.
‘I don’t expect you to solve it, Detective Inspector. I expect you to put up the pretence of working it until the story disappears from the newspapers. Sherlock can concoct a story for the

want this hanging over him. Mycroft will see straight through him, but maybe Lady Smallwood won’t.
‘I don’t blame you, John. Not really. And I can’t blame Sherlock. He always does what he thinks is best for you. Mycroft should have known he was supposed to keep an eye on you.’
died.’ And doesn’t that just make Sherlock feel like the worst human being on the planet. He knows how much pain he put John through, and now is not the best time for either of them to be reminded of that.
‘Yeah… God. I was head over heels for you, wasn’t I?’
‘Mycroft, I spent two years travelling the globe, alone, shutting down Moriarty’s network, based on
‘Maybe he just didn’t want you around’, Mary sneers, and John glares daggers at her. If looks could kill, they would no longer need to spend money on therapy.
'Oh, I’m really pleased, Mary. Have you set a date?’
'No, but seriously. When you were dead, I went to your grave.’
‘Nothing, Hudders.’ He moves to leave the kitchen and return upstairs, but he stops when he imagines John saying
He doesn’t want to leave him alone, but he needs some advice, so he squeezes John’s shoulder once before descending the stairs down to 221A, seeking out Mrs Hudson as he often does in times when emotions confound him.
‘Sorry, you don’t have the security clearance to know about that’, she apologises, without a hint of sincerity.
As soon as Molly has retrieved it, Sherlock takes it to the counter to visually compare the striations to the bullet taken from the cab driver’s shoulder. They’re a match. It will be a while before they get the official report from ballistics, but the visual comparison is enough for Sherlock.
‘I would hope you still are.’
John knows what he should do, just as he knows what he
‘My mother tried to make a call to emergency services’, Mycroft interrupts before Lestrade is able to form a sentence. There’s a faraway dazed look in his eyes, so unlike his usual self. ‘I have an alert on emergency calls from this number, of course, just as I do for Baker Street. Anthea was notified and sent out our responders before calling me. I followed shortly behind them, but by the time I arrived it was clear they could not be saved.’
‘Oh, I am’, John replies, giving me a cheeky smile, ‘I just have a feeling we won’t be needing two bedrooms.’
Sherlock can hardly believe he’d hit send. All of a sudden he’d been pouring his heart out in a message, all of the words he’d been bottling up had sprung free, but he’d never meant to actually send it. Now he’ll lose John for certain: he’ll go back to Mary and tell her he won’t be seeing Sherlock any more, because Sherlock has these pathetic unrequited feelings for him, so they can no longer be friends. Mary will be pleased. He pushes his hands into his hair, tugging at the curls in frustration. Should he call him? Should he run? Should he lock himself in his bedroom and not come out for a year?
Christ. John bites down on his lip as he feels his eyes start to sting and his vision begin to blur. He doesn’t cry in public, damn it, he
The first few days back at 221B are difficult. On the rare occasions John ventures out of his room he doesn’t speak much, he doesn’t eat, or want to interact, and Sherlock finds he’s the one who’s making and eating meals alone, just as John used to when they lived together. He knows what John is doing upstairs all day, he knows about the box that makes him cry.
use the kitchen table for food.
‘MI6 – they want to place you back into Eastern Europe. An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, I think, about six months.’ Mycroft’s cheeks are flushed, but whether it is from the bitter wind or the emotion conjured up at the thought of his brother’s demise, Sherlock can’t be sure.
‘Good, I’m gonna be late, catch me up later, yeah?’
‘Okay?’ John tries again.
‘I should think that was
Sherlock stands in the middle of the living room, looking lost, his eyes on the stairs for over an hour before accepting that John is unlikely to emerge again. Ever the British man, Sherlock makes tea, putting a splash of whisky and a spoonful of honey into John’s before taking it up. He knocks tentatively on the door and, receiving no answer, he gently pushes it open. John is lying on his left side facing away from the door, he gives no indication that he’s heard Sherlock knock, but as he hasn’t told him to leave, Sherlock enters, walking round to stand in front of John and placing the tea on the night stand.
Despite neither of them being convinced it was worth the money, Tuesday finds John and Mary once again seated on Dr Erin Farrell’s cream sofa. There are glasses of water on the table in front of them, condensation misting the glass; the room is always just that little bit too warm. Dr Farrell has coffee on her side table, yet has never offered one to them.
At the age of sixty-three, Sherlock has retained his full head of thick curls, though they are now such a bright white that he reminds John of a mad scientist. Well… he
gonna tell me how you did it? How you jumped off that building and survived?’
‘That’s because he’s an idiot’, Sherlock quips.
Sherlock knows Molly will come in to do this autopsy for him, after hours if necessary. Part of him feels bad for the way he uses her. Not bad enough to stop, though.
They have to shout to make themselves heard over the noise of the helicopter, which is churning up the grass around them as it begins to land.
her? You flew to Pakistan, stopped her death, faked it, had a fucking rendezvous in a poxy tent somewhere, then flew home without me even noticing?’
Sherlock’s nose crinkles in disgust as it does every time he hears his brother’s voice, real or imagined.
John chokes on a mouthful of wine. ‘You’re awful to that man – yeah I know, he mostly deserves it. Back to the cases… I have a bit of a soft spot for the first one, of course. And… well… the one when you came back to me.’
‘Why would they do that? Killers usually
‘He doesn’t trust me any more.’
‘Can’t. We’ve got, um… an appointment in the morning, then I’m working the afternoon shift. I’ll be on the end of the phone if you need to run anything by me.
‘Come on, Brother Mine, compose yourself. You do not want the yard to see you like this.’
‘John’, Sherlock says, ‘Molly is right, but maybe…’, he glances at Molly, eyes pleading with her to agree to his next request, ‘… maybe she can let you see her through the viewing window. Would that be okay?’
When he’s not supporting John, Sherlock is still working the case, though he doesn’t discuss anything with his friend. He still calls his brother daily, but his team are getting nowhere, or at least they aren’t admitting to anything - a fact that Mycroft is unusually apologetic about.
The young woman had been researching Sherlock, had been obsessed with studying him. John Watson’s blog was a wonderful source of insight, though the romanticised writing was painful to read at times. Did he realise he was telegraphing his feelings to the whole world with every post?
It only makes logistical sense for John to come back to Baker Street, assuming the incompetent police have removed the dead serial killer. It would save John the tube ride back to his dingy flat and keep me from the inevitable post-case boredom.
‘The bullet has been confirmed as matching that taken from Mr Horningsea’s shoulder.’
His immediate problem is how to stop himself shooting the walls in sheer frustration, or microwaving his phone to counteract his inevitable inability to leave John in peace. Truly, he could never be without his beloved iPhone, and his landlady (not housekeeper) has already complained about the living room wall resembling Swiss cheese. She would be livid if he reached for the gun again.
‘That’s Sussex police’, Lestrade answers, already compiling a list of reasons why he should take over the case from the poor detective saddled with it.
‘Lestrade. Another shooting, possibly related to our cabbie. The Jade Palace Gallery on New Bond Street.’ He grabs his Belstaff and scarf, elegantly flipping his coat on like it’s a cloak.
‘Nope. Even with an attempted murder, it wasn’t that exciting.’ He realises the implications in the comment when Sherlock turns pink with embarrassment. ‘Different kind of excitement,’ he coughs, awkwardly. There’s silence for a long moment, neither of them knowing what to say next. This isn’t the kind of thing they talk about.
‘Thank you.’
Mycroft sighs. ‘There’s no case for you to solve, Sherlock. Let it go.’ He turns on his heel and descends the stairs without a backward glance.
The lady herself is clad in an almost identical suit to the one she wore for their appointment last week. John imagines a walk-in wardrobe with row after row of identical skirts, shirts, and jackets. Or maybe it’s just her Tuesday suit. John is wearing the same jumper, and Mary the same jeans, as last week, so they can’t really judge.
'I heard you.’
‘Sherlock!’ John shouts as he runs out of the bedroom after him.
‘You were thinking for a long time. Did you come to any conclusions?’
Mrs. Holmes drinks her tea while John monitors her and is concerned that rather than the colour coming back into her cheeks, she is actually getting paler. He takes her wrist, counting the beats and finding the rate elevated. Her skin is hot and clammy to the touch. She sips more of her tea, hoping it will perk her up, but she’s begun to feel dizzy and places the cup on the side table.
When John comes out of the room his eyes are red but dry and he’s standing taller. Soldiers today.
Making a conscious effort to put his mind back on the case, Sherlock sends messages to Lestrade and Dimmock, requesting a list of personnel associated with both the “Study in Pink” case, and the Black Lotus, along with anything else that wasn’t in the files. After staring for an interminable length of time at the documents he had collated while John had slept that morning, he can feel the beginnings of a headache encroaching. Giving in to the (frankly unreasonable) demands of his transport, he takes a break from his visual analysis of the files, stretching out on the sofa and slipping into his mind palace instead.
Hiding his face behind his hand, he bows his head, letting the tears flow freely. Molly has seen her fair share of grieving parents, but she feels uncomfortable now that it is her friend, and she quickly moves to leave the room, knowing John would hate for anyone to see him in such a vulnerable moment. There’s only one person that can comfort him now.
a doctor, and I know a pregnant woman when I see one. You are not now, nor have you ever been, pregnant.’ John smiles that smile that has no trace of affection in it, only anger and pity. She underestimated John Watson. He can’t say exactly when he knew. There had been the early suspicions when he was convinced they had always used protection, and when she wouldn’t allow him to examine her, or to come to the doctor’s office for the official confirmation. Then there were the scans he was never allowed to attend, a complete lack of morning sickness or any other symptoms, the fact that she broke into Magnussen’s office and attempted to murder Sherlock during the risky early stages of her supposed pregnancy, and something in the way she carried herself recently that just didn’t ring true. When he had seen her that morning, for the first time in weeks, he had simply known.
Mary betrayed you, she was a danger to you. So she had to go’, she says, matter of fact. ‘Now John here, he also betrayed you. Not only introducing you to the woman who would almost end you, but he beat you when you returned from your… holiday – he went on and on about it in therapy. Remorse is so tedious.’
‘Sherlock, if this is personal, if we’re in danger, then I need to be at home with Mary. I know it’s my job to have your back, but I can’t leave her alone again, not when she could go into labour at any time.’
Dr Farrell glances at her watch, somewhat relieved, ‘Our time is up for this week, John. I would encourage you to make another appointment, same time next week? We have quite a bit of work to do.’
‘Yeah, sorry about the time. Long day, then I had to go home and pack a bag. Pretty sure I won’t be making it back tonight.’
He never hears the gunshot.
‘Mary has been shot.’
There’s a long moment when nobody speaks, until Mary finally relents. ‘I put Sherlock in hospital’, she states, matter-of-factly. Her tone of voice and demeanour say that she is proud of what she had done. ‘I didn’t have a choice, but John doesn’t see it that way.’
John opens his mouth to retort but his friend cuts him off.
‘There’s nothing you can do here, Sherlock. This isn’t the way you want to remember them.’
‘I’m not saying that anyone is right or wrong, that’s not my job. My job is to guide you to see things from each other’s perspective, to encourage you to understand motivations behind behaviour, and then to help you move past your problems and form a healthy relationship.’ (She wonders how a healthy relationship is possible when one half of the couple shot the other half’s best friend). ‘Again, I don’t know the full details of what occurred, but you said that Sherlock has forgiven Mary and encouraged your reconciliation. Do you trust his opinion?’
As the early evening light fades into night, an email pops up from Molly, letting them know she has finished the autopsy and finalised her report, and that she’ll see them in the morning. She pre-empts Sherlock’s question and refuses to send the report to him in advance: John deserves to hear everything before anyone else. She signs off by sending her love to the bereaved man.
Sherlock blinks twice, a look of confusion causing his brow to furrow in that way that gives him deep grooves on the top of his nose. John has always found it adorable, but this time it’s only there for a second before Sherlock explodes in anger. ‘Why the hell not?! We prepared the words. That was the plan!’
Leaving the hospital, Sherlock finds John outside against the wall opposite the side entrance they prefer to use.
Sherlock is completely absorbed by the photograph, and doesn’t notice they have left the room. He’s trying his best to look at anything other than his best friend, tied up and helpless, but there’s very little else for him to look at. There’s just enough light for him to see the bottom of the wall behind John, and where it meets the two walls running down the sides. He’s staring, barely blinking. He knows there’s a detail he’s missing, and it could be that very detail that saves John’s life.
Sherlock doesn’t respond. He agrees that John needs therapy, but he doesn’t know how to put his support into words. He’s always been useless with emotional matters. It never used to affect him, but now he worries that he isn’t a good enough friend to John, not enough of a supportive shoulder. He gives John as much as he can; more than he has ever given anyone before. He takes a drink, drawing his eyes away from John’s and into his glass. They are silent for a while, comfortable in each other’s company, before John speaks again.
‘How could you bring her into our home, John? We welcomed her into our

case. How the hell do you expect me to work it if I don’t know half the story?’
anything until… this… but I had suspicions. This killer knew things that only I should know about my brother.’
One thing he is sure of: he can’t marry Mary. He can’t commit himself to someone when his heart already belongs to his best friend. He can’t go through every day being married to one person while loving someone else, and he knows he’ll never be able to stop loving Sherlock.
They exit the farmhouse into the field outside the front of the home. They can hear the sound of an approaching helicopter. John looks up at Sherlock.
Home! He said home! Sherlock’s heart leaps into his throat (
‘What?’ Greg asks him, totally bewildered by all he’s heard so far. This family…
Sherlock’s head jerks up from the newspaper he’s been scouring for cases.
I don’t see it that way! You shot -.’ He catches himself before he finishes the sentence. Mary cocks her head to the side, staring John down, not at all worried this secret has been revealed.
‘Fine. I’d done some illegal things and I was trying to hide from some trouble. I didn’t want John to know that side of me, it was finished with. He never would have found out if Sherlock hadn’t -’
The pathologist is flitting about nervously, putting on her lab coat and then taking it off again, suddenly too warm. She picks up the file to have something to do with her hands and puts it down again when she realises how much her hands are sweating. Sherlock sits down and gestures for John and Molly to do the same. He expects that Molly will be addressing John, but the first thing she does is turn to
surprise him is that the killer managed to find another dominatrix working in such close proximity to Eaton Square; just how many
have struggled.
Mrs. Holmes clutches at her chest, eyes wide. ‘Oh my… Oh, John.’
John sits back down, close to Sherlock, holding the divorce papers in his hands. He has everything he has wanted for the past twelve months (or five years, if he’s honest): his deceitful wife has left their lives, the child (that he never truly wanted) doesn’t exist, and the man that stuck him in a bonfire, on Guy Fawkes night, for
‘Christ, that’s…’ he trails off, looking at the photographs Sherlock had printed out from both shootings, and the detailed diagrams of the shoulder he had included. The highlighted sections on the diagrams show that the shots really were as close to identical as you could possibly get with two different victims, two different shooters, and two different guns.
Of course, nothing is ever that simple with them, and before he knows it they are in the centre of a case again. There’s the tube car, the trick, the forgiveness, and after the dust has settled and their statements given, there’s a take-away on the sofa at 221B, and a conversation that is stilted and emotional for both of them.
‘Confused, irritated, angry’, John admits, ‘and… hopeful, yeah’, he tacks on the end. ‘Last night we built the cot together.’ More accurately, John had built the cot whilst Mary sat in the rocking chair giving orders. Not that John is complaining, she
to forgive
‘But I did’, Sherlock tells her.
Lestrade joins them after hearing John’s shouts, knowing how easy his anger can be tipped over into violence. ‘Everything alright in here?’, he asks, redundantly, as he can already see the blood soaking through the cloth against Mycroft’s face.
John slams the front door to 221, rushing out into the pouring rain whilst still fighting a war with his coat sleeves. He’s hot and dizzy, and the cold rain feels quite pleasant on his sweating skin. It’s like an out-of-body experience, he’s not sure if he can still feel his feet or even his legs, but somehow he doesn’t stop striding until he’s a safe distance away from the flat – from Sherlock. He’s crossed Clarence Bridge into Regent’s Park and slows his steps as he enters “Holme Green” and the irony of the name is not lost on him. Despite the rain, John sinks to the ground by the lake, disturbing a bevy of swans huddling together against the bank.
‘She hurt the cats’, Sherlock whispers, a memory tickling at the edge of his subconscious.
‘I just need a drink’, he says, nodding towards a pub on the opposite side of the road from Barts. ‘Coming?’ He doesn’t wait for an answer before striding off. The pub is not somewhere he’s ever been before, and it looks like a bit of a dive, but he honestly couldn’t care less.
‘I didn’t expect you to stay out all night! Anyone else would think you were having an affair’, she shouts, her voice loud enough to attract the attention of others on the street. ‘You’re never around. What happens if I go into labour and you’re not there?’
‘Trained shooter?’
‘Of course I do, you’re my best friend, there’s nobody I would rather have looking out for my little girl. Though you’ll have to make the flat a bit more baby proof before I bring her round.’
‘Eurus was incredibly intelligent, far more so than you or I’, he says to Sherlock. ‘She was speaking in full sentences by the time she turned one, and holding adult conversations by three. She adored you, followed you everywhere like a little shadow, always wanting to play “pirates”. But I had begun to notice things.’
‘Does Sherlock have a partner? A significant other?’
‘I said when I forgave you at Christmas that I’m still angry, and it would still come out from time to time. Talking about it brings it all back, that’s all. And you
‘Shut up, both of you. This isn’t the time or place for your petty domestics. Who knew this was how she – how she
‘Good. And make sure you get some sleep tonight, too. You look worse than I do.’
!’ he begins, struggling as Eurus slaps her hand over his mouth, leaving behind a layer of duct tape.
‘And has that been an issue for you?’ she asks innocently, in that way that psychologists do when they already know the answer to the question.
It’s two a.m. when John Watson pushes through the door to his room at the Premier Inn at Wembley Park, a small suitcase, a rucksack, and a cardboard box weighing him down and causing him to trip over his own feet, almost upending the contents of the box on the floor.
The Watsons had found Dr Farrell after many hours of tedious internet searches for a local, female, therapist: Mary supposing that a female would be more likely to take her side, and John simply being fed up with having his life dissected by a man. He hadn’t wanted to return to Ella; it seemed unfair to Mary to use a therapist already privy to so much of his life before. With (and without) Sherlock. They needed someone neutral, and Dr Plain Suit Farrell certainly fit that description.
‘Of course’, Greg responds, happy to defer to the government official. He had always had a lot of respect for Mycroft, ever since the days they worked together to get Sherlock clean.
Sherlock nods, grateful for his friend’s support. ‘Geoff comes with us’, he says, though he’s reluctant to leave the bodies of his parents, knowing that the next time he sees them they will be naked and cleaned on a metal gurney in the morgue. Lestrade can read the apprehension on his face.
‘Please don’t waste your resources, Detective Inspector, we both know my people will be able to trace this in a fraction of the time it would take Scotland Yard’, Mycroft says, thumbing out a text to Anthea. ‘Assuming it is traceable, which I very much doubt.’
The three of them climb into the back of one of Mycroft’s chauffeur driven Jaguars, Sherlock sitting close to John with Greg opposite. Mycroft takes the front seat, preferring to keep his distance from the ball of rage in the back.
Sherlock sighs, but finds he cannot argue, ‘Fine. Yes, I promise. I’m going to sit here reading through these files all day, by myself because you refuse to stay, and compare them for any repeated names, places, or officers. Tedious but perfectly safe, Captain.’
‘Yeah, it wasn’t bad at all. It could only be made better with a lovely soak in that ridiculously large tub.’
‘No, Sherlock. I can’t put this off. I need to talk to Mary and then I’ll check into a hotel. That’s non-negotiable. Please understand.’
‘What on Earth were you trying to achieve?’ He manages to hiss menacingly yet quietly enough not to wake his mother. ‘Committing treason? Risking life imprisonment, for you
Greg looks around the wood panelled kitchen that is the scene of the Holmes parents’ final moments. It’s a beautiful room, warmly heated by the modern Aga cooker against the furthest wall. Greg could fit his kitchen into this one three times at least. There’s a clock on the wall to his immediate left, in the design of a ship’s wheel, and directly below this is an old-fashioned telephone fitted to the wall, receiver hanging down. Mrs Holmes is on her back between said phone and the coat rack by the door, though due to the blood pool beneath her and against the skirting board, it is clear she fell almost on her side, and lay there for some time, before the emergency responders moved her to her back. Mr Holmes is lying beside the table, his chair moved out as if he had tried to stand and fallen. There is a small amount of blood on the chair and much less on the floor than around Mrs Holmes. He had fallen on his stomach and by the time he had been turned over for resuscitation his heart had stopped pumping blood. There are small droplets of blood around the kitchen table, to the counter and sink behind, and also leading away from the room towards the downstairs bathroom. The amount of blood increases from the bathroom towards the kitchen table, and on the other side the amount of blood increases rapidly from the kitchen counter to the coat peg.
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock walks past him, ‘In a minute.’
Mycroft ignores him, knowing what his brother needs, and he smirks when Sherlock takes a deep breath, switching from grieving son to Consulting Detective. He needs to see the scene, to know what happened here.
‘Good. We don’t need the money, and you know we have a joint account for client payments that you can help yourself to.’

‘I’ll text you when I’m settled, okay?’
‘What criteria?’ Lestrade asks.
, John mused when they entered for their first appointment ten days ago. Mary is heavily pregnant, with only three weeks to go until her due date. She wears her obnoxiously bright red coat, as if it were a suit of armour, her hands clutched tightly beneath her belly as she looks down at her flat, white, scuffed trainers, and the dirty marks on the coffee coloured carpet. John clenches the fingers of his left hand in his lap. His right, clad in a dark blue cashmere sweater (a gift from Sherlock, that Mary wasn’t impressed to see him wearing to their appointment), is spread out on the armrest in a display of nonchalance that isn’t fooling the therapist in the room.
She laughs to herself; human beings are a funny breed, she doesn’t think she’ll ever truly understand them.
Sherlock gives an almost coy smile, ‘While I’m flattered by your interest, you are already married, John.’
Both men flinch, snapped out of their reverie. Sherlock makes to move past John into the kitchen, but John takes hold of his arm to stop him. Remembering one of the lines that Sherlock had advised him to say to Mary, he says, ‘The problems of
John was torn between walking back to Baker Street or getting a cab to the house in Northwood. He hadn’t sent a follow up to Sherlock, hadn’t told him that the message wasn’t meant for him (because it was, in all honesty, wasn’t it?), and Sherlock had, of course, answered as if everything was normal. They needed to talk.
Mrs Hudson is there when John steps in through the doorway, as if she’s been waiting to accost him. It pleases her no end to know that Sherlock will be getting a good meal tonight, so mercifully she doesn’t keep John talking for long, only to ask how Mary is doing and how long they have left until her due date. Escaping as soon as he can, John trots up the seventeen stairs to the flat to find Sherlock clearing the coffee table for the food.
Sherlock looks at John in surprise; he truly is his conductor of light. He
John ignores her comments and sits in the chair to the right of her, reaching into his jacket pocket he pulls out a slim, silver memory stick.
‘Yes, but you still won’t tell me what it is!’
Dr Erin Farrell: marriage counsellor, with a PhD in clinical psychology, and a special interest in Emotionally Focussed Therapy. She’s in her early fifties, John would estimate, with her grey blond hair, cut in a bob, framing her pretty oval face. Her knee length beige pencil skirt has a matching jacket draped over the back of her chair, taken off at the beginning of each session. John wonders why she even bothers putting it on at all. A plain white blouse and cream high-heeled courts complete the purposely neutral outfit. Everything about her, and the room, is plain, unimaginative, and characterless. Despite this, John finds himself noticing her: the shape of her body (in damn good shape for her age), the swell of her breasts beneath her shirt, and the curve of her shapely thigh as her skirt hitches each time she crosses her legs. A bit not good.
Mrs. Holmes has gone pale and keeps patting Sherlock’s arm. Mycroft gets her a glass of water, but she slaps his hand away. ‘Did you know about this? Of course, you did. You know everything that goes on with Sherlock and you never tell me anything.’
‘No’, he gives Sherlock a pointed look, ‘It’s what you think of yourself.’ When Sherlock fails to respond, Mycroft continues, ‘I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline.’
matter.’
[Sent 21:08]
Faltering once before he makes up his mind, Sherlock slips off his suit jacket and shoes before sitting on the bed next to John, propped up against the headboard, legs stretched out in front of him. He rests a pillow on his knees to steady his laptop and continues to work the case, searching for any connection between the victims, either to each other or to himself. An hour trawling through social media gives him nothing so he sends a message to Mycroft, demanding that he finds Mary’s killer
Lestrade sighs, throwing his hands up in an expression of defeat, and goes into the garden as asked. He’s wary of moving about too much, in case he disturbs evidence. Sod what Mycroft Holmes has to say, he’s
‘Can I go?’
‘Boys, I’m sorry but I think we’ll need to cut our Christmas day short’, Mrs. Holmes says, regretfully. ‘It seems we’ve both had a shock and neither of us is feeling well.’ She looks up at Sherlock and fixes him with her intelligent gaze, ‘It’s almost as if Sherlock spiked the punch again.’
‘Lestrade, get Molly to do the autopsy this afternoon. I’ll head over to Barts now.’ He desperately needed something to do, and if that meant seeing patterns where there weren’t any, then so be it. At the very least, it should be enough to spark John’s interest and give him an excuse to come to Baker Street.
‘What? You can’t do that! I’m about to have your baby!’
Mycroft steps in front of him as he heads for the door, and he eventually realises that the people in the room haven’t finished with him. He groans dramatically, refusing to look at his brother and looking at the woman who holds his fate in her hands.
‘Who found the note?’
Sherlock looks down at the body at his feet for the first time. ‘The shooter didn’t have to break in, he simply had to smash a window and wait for her to arrive to respond to the alarm.’ The detective begins his usual pace around the body, crouching low then standing quickly, taking a step forward then doing the same again, almost like an exercise routine for his leg muscles. When he completes a lap he pauses at the victim’s head, taking a look at the wound, before starting the process again. His eyes flick up and down her body, reading all of the details at lightning speed:
‘What is it?’ Lestrade asks, wondering how this case could possibly get any worse.
John has been sitting on the bench in an almost Sherlockian trance for long enough for him to start to shiver – despite the mild summer evening – thanks to his still soaking wet clothes. When he pulls out his phone he realises he’s been sitting there for nearly two hours. He also notices there are no texts from Sherlock, which is unexpected, he would have thought there would have been demands for his presence, at the very least.
‘What do you –?’
to know that now, once and for all, before he has the dubious honour of being John’s best man (of course John would ask him, who else was there?). It would be like watching his own autopsy happen in front of him: his heart expertly carved out of his chest, weighed and measured before the guests.
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate, he carefully gathers John in his arms, pulling him against his chest. One hand a steadying presence on the back of his neck, and the other sliding up and down John’s arm in, what Sherlock hopes is, a soothing manner. John shivers, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s waist and splaying his hand out on his back, holding him in place.
‘I don’t believe in coincidences. The universe is rarely so lazy’, Sherlock parrots one of Mycroft’s favourite lines back to him.
On a large stone patio two men are seated at a small round table, their chairs facing the sunset rather than each other.
‘Not your concern. Do you have a case, or not?’
‘It’s not me you should be apologising to, Brother Mine. If you’re hiding something, I won’t be responsible for any bones John breaks.’
Then, and
‘I… yes. I mean, you… want me to…’
‘Oh, I’m used to that, John. Cooking is my department. I was just making some tea; would you mind taking one through to Mary? And you must call me “Mummy”, dear.’
‘Technically -’ Sherlock begins, but Mycroft cuts him off before he can anger John further.
‘This was the perfect anniversary. You, me, no other idiots, and good food I didn’t have to cook.’
‘Is that why you killed our parents?’ Sherlock asks. ‘Because they betrayed you?’
John comes back through the kitchen as I return into the living room, and as we meet in the doorway he takes his drink with one hand and ghosts the fingers of the other across my waist, so gently I barely notice, but a chill runs through me all the same. He smiles and settles into the green leather monstrosity that is the other chair in the room, immediately sensing that the red wingback is mine.
the life I want!’
‘No’, John says, taking hold of his hand, ‘None of this is your fault.’
‘Quite right, Brother Mine’, Mycroft responds, dragging his own thoughts back from those dark days.
‘Sherlock?! What the – How did you find me? Did you track… You
‘I think I need to lie down, John. This has all been a bit of a shock.’ She lies down on her side, closing her eyes. John notices her body go slack, far too quickly to be a natural sleep. ‘Mrs. Holmes?’ There’s no response, but she is breathing and when John takes the pulse in her neck, it is steady. He shifts her into the recovery position and calls for Sherlock, but there’s no response. John feels her temperature and notes that she is bordering on too warm, so he reluctantly leaves her to go in search of both Sherlock and a cool flannel.
Sherlock reaches across the table and squeezes his husband’s hand. ‘You might find it cathartic.’
Sherlock chokes on the mince pie he is stuffing his face with, spraying pastry crumbs over his black shirt. Mrs. Holmes turns to look at him with curiosity, but John distracts her easily by praising her baking skills, distinctly aware that the entire Holmes family are uniformly susceptible to flattery.
One of his many state of the art laptops rests on the table in front of him, various pages open on the screen. For all of the power at his disposal, he cannot think of a single action that will help him out of his current predicament. Even when you hold a minor position in the British government, you can’t perform miracles.
'Being Sherlock Holmes.’
Sherlock hugs her and kisses her head, thanking her for her insight, though internally he doubts that his presence will do much for John at this moment.

‘She makes you happy!’
John has continued his therapy with Dr Farrell, working through all of his issues with Mary, and explaining his history with Sherlock. Some days he comes back angry but he won’t tell Sherlock why.
Wiping the wetness from his phone he jams it into his pocket and heads off to buy some milk.
[Received 21:23]
Sherlock has filled a suitcase with far more clothes than John will need for two weeks. John adds the toiletry bag then asks Sherlock to give him a moment. At first Sherlock is reluctant to leave him alone, and John gives him a tight smile, silently reassuring the detective that he’s okay. Once alone, John once again ignores all of Mary’s belongings in the room, reaching under the bed to where he keeps an old shoebox. He’s had it since he was in medical school and it’s been taped back together many times, rather than simply changed for a new one. Inside the box there are some photos from the army, along with his dog tags, a photo of him with his mother, and some newspaper clippings of him and Sherlock that he collected together after his “death”. A candid photo of the two of them, snapped by Lestrade, also sits in the box. He takes an ultrasound pic from the bedside table, and a fluffy bee from the nursery, an early baby present from Sherlock. He places them in the top of the box and places the box in his duffel, covering it with a jacket.
He turns to John, ‘Do calm down. I calculated the doses carefully. It is something I’m pretty good at’, he quips.
John frowns at him but doesn’t answer.
‘I know, but the call came directly to me, requesting our presence.’
‘We haven’t… um… since the honeymoon. Five -’

‘This is a
Sherlock’s text didn’t say a lot – mysterious as ever – just that there was a case where a cabbie had been shot and he could use his help. Sherlock never really needs anyone’s help: he simply likes having someone to talk to, and the skull just attracts attention. John laughs at the memory as he unlocks the door to 221, using the key he still retains. He knows exactly why Sherlock has called him for this one – as if John could ever forget that first case and the moment he had killed a man for Sherlock Holmes. Besides, they haven’t seen each other since they parted ways on the tarmac almost a fortnight ago, and he likes to think Sherlock has missed him as much as John had missed the mad detective.
Mary nods, finally accepting that she had sealed her own fate that day. She rises from the sofa and her entire posture changes. She suddenly looks nothing like the woman he had loved. Mary doesn’t break eye contact when she removes the false belly, dropping it onto the sofa. ‘I’ll pack up your things when I get home. Please collect them when I’m not there.’
‘I know you’re not really in your mind palace, Sherlock. Don’t you think we should talk?’
John knows what that means; he cared for Sherlock for months after his release from hospital, and he was there by his side every single day, in both a familial and a professional capacity. As Sherlock’s doctor he had been privy to all of the information regarding his wound. The fact that Mary died so swiftly, from the same wound, confirms something he has long believed: Mary never expected (wanted) Sherlock to survive the bullet she fired at him.
‘Perfect timing, I see.’
But he does hear it, and he can’t deny how much that little confession means to him. He takes another gulp of his beer. ‘What you just said? That was… good.’
‘Ha ha, smart arse.’
‘Any number of people could have found out the information if they wanted to. But why would they be looking? It doesn’t make any sense!’ Sherlock throws himself down on the sofa, but without his dressing gown the move is far less dramatic than he’d hoped.
‘I won’t even ask’, he laughs, taking a sip of his drink. He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, as if he is about to impart some confidential knowledge. ‘Here’s an idea: why don’t you order a mini fridge, clear everything from the kitchen table, and set up a dedicated experiment lab in the spare room upstairs?’
‘Do you remember that first case?’
Mary snorts, ‘Wouldn’t that be novel’, and John has to dig his nails into the palms of his hands to keep himself from responding.
‘Maybe.’

Needs must.
‘I just left my wife, my wife who until about five minutes ago I thought was carrying my child, because she put a bullet in you. You
Sherlock doesn’t respond, eyes glazed over as his mind retreats from the room, momentarily lost in a memory of his beloved dog.
‘Hell of a thing, isn’t it. Decapitated with a curved blade, like a sabre. Killer was something of a novice though; they didn’t manage to get it through on the first hit, the whole neck is a mess. Would have called you in regardless, due to the sheer fucking brutality, but added to the cabbie shooting, it got me looking at John’s blog. Found the case you worked for Dimmock. Chinese smugglers, and an Asian museum employee shot dead. You should have told me about Soo Lin Yao the other night’, he admonishes.
‘God, Sherlock. You know I think that was the best night of my life.’
‘Right, okay.’ John looks back at Sherlock and raises an eyebrow in question. Sherlock nods. John turns to leave, leaning in close to Greg as he passes, ‘Keep an eye on him, please?’
There’s really only one option: he needs to stay here and face whatever is coming to him. An angry confrontation may be better than John never speaking to him again (which is exactly what he deserves; his own experiences have taught him that outing someone’s sexuality is generally considered a bit not good).
‘Yeah. Not sure it’ll be that interesting for you though, but it’s better than nothing, right?’ When Sherlock doesn’t respond, he continues. ‘Last night there was a shooting in Southwark. A taxi driver having a smoke against his cab, took a bullet to the left shoulder.’
‘Wait?’
‘Mary, I had every right to be angry, but I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I’ve chosen these words with care.’ He draws in a breath, taking her hands in his, ‘The problems of your past are your business. I wish you’d come to me; I wish you’d let us help you, but what happened before I met you can stay in the past.’
‘This is going to be hard to hear, but Mary isn’t who we thought she was. Her name isn’t really Mary and she has a rather… colourful past.’ He stops, unsure of how much he should tell her, then decides sod it: she has a right to know. ‘My wife was an assassin. She shot people for a living.’

‘Yes, agreed. How is the writing going? I see you sitting in your office watching me with the hives. Do you actually get any writing done?’ he teases.

lunch. Why can’t you ever just stick to a plan without going off on your own?’ Sherlock pulls at his hair, exasperated. ‘Why is she leaving? You’ve forgiven her.’
John vaults from the chair, knocking his cup of tea to the floor. He marches out of the room without saying a word to them, leaving the door wide open behind him. Both Sherlock and Molly watch him go, the latter panicking that she has upset her friend with the news.
‘And then that shot! My soldier coming to save the day. I think I fell in love with you right then.’
‘I didn’t get it at the time but later I realised he’d probably never seen you voluntarily talk to another person.’
‘But it definitely
‘What was it?’
And then he spots it. One of those walls is not like the others.
‘Mycroft. We shouldn’t be talking about this. Classified. Forget I mentioned it. He turns to Dr Farrell, ‘Please don’t write this down, this can’t be on the record.’
'Being back. Being a hero again.’
As they near the crime scene, Sherlock’s behaviour becomes clear.
Mrs. Hudson had long-since passed, Greg and Molly both retired (together and with grandkids) and Mycroft, still running the country at the ripe old age of seventy-one, the ever-present Anthea on hand to help with the legwork.
‘No!’ Sherlock snorts a laugh. ‘I just

He picks up the champagne glass on the desk that he never took a drink out of before, downing the contents in one gulp. He cringes; it truly is vile, but being drunk sounds like a brilliant plan right now. He refills the glass with the remnants of the bottle and drains that too. Alcohol never really has agreed with him. He considers going back to Mrs. Hudson for some company, but he knows she will read him and convince him to
‘It’s alright, Mrs Hudson, I’ve got to get going anyway.’ Greg puts his glass down, putting on his jacket, followed quietly by Molly, who hasn’t spoken a word since putting her foot in it with Mary.
Mycroft inclines his head in a fraction of a nod: as close to an acceptance as he’s going to give. He’ll be sure to keep a distance from the doctor, with an agent or two nearby, if needed.
‘Oh, are we doing conversation today?’ She replies sarcastically. ‘It really
‘Cause of death?’
‘John, we have to get our hands on what he has on her.’
‘Mary, please don’t make me prove it.’ He tilts his head and gives her a determined stare, almost begging her to fight him, but she turns away. John relaxes his stance. ‘I’m going to ask Mycroft to send a car for you. You’re going back to the house, and when you receive the divorce papers you will sign them without question.’
‘I’m sure you still have things here in your room, it’s not that long ago you were staying here to help me recover.’
Perfect.
‘Like I needed somewhere to stay because my wife turned out to be a liar! You betrayed him. You betrayed
