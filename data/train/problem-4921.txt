END OF PART ONE
“Considering I already told Sam about this, yes probably. Unless you’d rather lose three hundred dollars than spend an evening dining with me.”
“Thanks,” Dean manages to get out before he turns tail and silently slinks up the stairs with Cas in tow.
what you can give me. I don’t want your crappy shirts, I want
Dean swallows. He’s close enough here to lunge, provided he’s very quick. And he usually is— he’s never been the biggest guy on the field, nor the smartest, so he’s always had to make do simply being the quickest. But angels are no small-town scrappers; they’re holy warriors who can face up against the darkest and most dangerous and never be the first to blink.
“Well, I just came in here to get my wallet ‘cause I’m heading into town on a supply run. Come with and I’ll drop you off at Goodwill and you can pick some stuff out.”
Dean considers for a moment, before answering, “Normally I’d say human, but I guess that doesn’t apply.” He offers a small smile. “Look, man, not wanting to kill me makes you, like, the best of any angel I’ve ever heard of.”
have Bobby look at him and see how stupid he is. If all of this is just him saving his brother, that’s one thing and he’ll take the shit he gets for that happily. Having Bobby know, though, that he’d gone and got himself in even more hot water over a pair of pretty blue eyes is… “No, it’s not like that. He’s a friend.”
“No, Dean. I’d just watch him suffer,” Cas droned sarcastically. “Of course I would heal him.”
“Well he’s got to help you in the garden, so we’re teaching him… values, I guess.” Dean shrugged.
“No,” Garth says, shattering Jo’s dreams and her hopeful expression. “You’re gunna be working under Victor Henrickson. He’s on his way, be here by tomorrow morning. You know him?”
“Dean,” he said, his morning voice somehow even more gravelly than his regular voice. “Are you awake?”
“There’s no need to thank me,” Castiel says. “You should thank your brother.”
“You said it would be weird. That hurt my feelings, Dean,” Cas says in a tone that really only Dean could pick up as sarcasm. “I also think perhaps it’s time you put your money where your mouth is, so to speak.”
“No, no, a personal one. Dean?” Sam stares expectantly at his brother, watching him stew uncomfortably under the attention.
Dean hadn’t been fool enough to assume the gate would be unguarded; the angels are fiercely protective of their city. But there’s only one guard, alone, out of sight and earshot from any of the other watch posts along the wall— Dean was sure to check. Either the angels have placed a great deal of faith in this single sentry, or they’re idiots— it would be naïve to assume the latter, so Dean is cautious. He skulks in the trees, shielded by cover of their shadow and the vast array of shrubbery that lines the forest’s edge.
Castiel watches with a smile as the clouds move by overhead. From down here, the clouds are like gentle brushstrokes against the blue sky, moving silently and majestic, slow and fast all at once. They’re so much more beautiful from afar where you can see the puffs and plumes that make up the larger whole.
Dean is completely misplaced and out of his element. Research isn’t his area of expertise; he usually leaves the deep dives to Bobby when he really needs information, otherwise he just goes in hot on the seat of his pants and hopes for the best.
Dean sleeps through the night, waking slowly and gently the next morning finding his head resting on something firmer and warmer than a pillow. He looks over to see Cas underneath him, Cas’ face nestled in Dean’s hair.
“Oh, Sam took me to Goodwill,” Cas answers with a proud smile.
Sam rolls his eyes. “‘Kay then, grumpy. What got your panties in a bunch?”
“Hey, Cas,” older Dean responds with a forced smile. “So I probably should have called.”
“Why are you so obsessed with this guy?”
As far as first impressions go, weird is definitely understating it. Dean doesn’t know what he expected, probably someone big and muscular and rugged, who looks like they could take you apart with their bare hands, someone who could command a room with their presence. This guy is… not that. He’s small, and slim and looks pretty unassuming. Dean can’t help but wonder if at least half of his reputation comes from the fact that people who lay eyes on that sharp jaw, tousled hair and big blue eyes have an inclination to exaggerate his prowess.
Dean’s miserable to be around, he knows that. His responses are short and stilted, he’s snippy on a good day, and his favourite leisure activity is to drink alone. Yeah, he knows being cooped up with him must be draining, so he doesn’t hold it against the kid, he really doesn’t, when he goes out for the night. Sam’s missed out on a lot the last few years and he deserves better than a broken hearted alcoholic for company. So yeah, he better have fun. Dean’s got company anyway; first name Malt, last name Whiskey.
Sam merely shakes his head, dumbfounded. “You should count yourself lucky, then. It won’t happen again. Don’t go back, not on my account.”
“It was nice to be appreciated,” Meg said, through a smarmy grin. “Wish it coulda lasted. But hey, empty’s great.”
At the end of the chant, Cas tosses a lit match into the bowl, a red flame erupting upwards before simmering down into a glowing red flame, low and bubbling like a hot potion. And so they wait with bated breath for the rabbit to enter the trap.
Castiel looks over to the forest’s edge just ahead. Nobody will emerge from there now, and he no longer has any reason or responsibility to look. So he doesn’t. He squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in the warm, dry grass, hoping that if he does so for long enough then maybe everything else will stop.
Cas turns to look at him, the man he’d been avoiding giving any attention to in his peripheral vision. “Apologies,” he says, not able to bring himself to make eye contact, not able to bear the sight.
Cas taps his thumbs against the cold glass bottle. “I feel… fine.”
Excused, the pair take their leave, Jo bouncing around Dean like a moth around a flame. “Can you calm down?” Dean snips. Jo just rolls her eyes as they sweep into the mess. It’s already getting rowdy and the sight of everyone making merry suddenly pisses Dean off.
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean rolls his eyes and helps throw the last few bags up onto the back. “Know where we’re headed?”
“Okay, hold up. Ground rules; no kissing,” Dean stresses with a pointed finger.
Dean looks over to Cas, who gives a small reassuring nod. He really hadn’t told older Dean anything then, huh?
“I’ve spent nearly fifty years on this watch completely content. You and the books you’ve leant me have shown me everything I’m missing just standing here. I now crave drama and adventure— I was actually egging the squirrels on,” Castiel confesses.
“Something like this— this is beyond any power any of us should be meddling with. Believe me, I wouldn’t dare tell a soul.”
“Good.” Dean nods for a second. He presses his lips together, then runs his tongue across them. Cas is embarrassed about having wanted him. Cas wanted him. He wanted Cas. Bad. Cas won’t look at him but he’s looking at Cas. He’s right there and for the first time, maybe ever, there’s absolutely no barrier between wanting Cas and having him.
“Yeah maybe,” Jo muses.
Dean stiffens and his breath catches. Cas shifts his gaze away, not allowing the moment to persist, and shuffles off to find somewhere else to place his attention.
A small noise escapes Cas’ throat as Dean works his way down. As Dean reaches the base of his torso, Cas takes Dean’s face in his hands and pulls him back up to meet his lips. He lets them linger there, tasting the moment.
“Your father’s,” Cas says, voice soft.
“They’re real,” Bobby says. “Let’s just say I know a guy who knows a guy. They’re the real thing. But they ain’t a charity, even if you find ‘em there ain’t no guarantee they’re gunna wanna help you with something this high risk.”
“Dean, if you can- if you can hear me, which, I know you can’t; I changed my mind. It’s not enough to say it. I- I want to…” he trails off, even here still struggling to indulge in the act of wanting.
“We need someone on watch tonight,” Victor says, re-entering the room after having a quick wash in the bathroom (which doesn’t have any hot water, Dean asked). “Cas can I assume you’re volunteering.”
“I don’t have to die,” Castiel says, a paltry consolation. “There was an angel, one of my superiors, she successfully disappeared. If she could do it, maybe I could too.”
“Well, I’m awake.”
Dean’s been waiting for; a chance to make a real difference, to end this war, to find peace. And to kick some angel and demon ass along the way.
“So, Jo,” Victor starts between mouthfuls of reheated stew. “You and Dean grew up together, right?”
Sam turns a head to his brother and his… whatever, with a knowing look. “Well, there’s been a development,” he says, leading his brother.
“So you’re what? 26?”
“Yeah, same,” his older self says, closing his eyes and rubbing his temples.
“Remember,” Cas says to his side, holding his smile in place as Sam gets out of his car and begins to approach. “If you can’t pull it together enough to convince Sam, you lose.”
“So we’re going after the other half?” Dean interrupts.
. He looks like part of the family, ‘cause that’s what he is.
Sam’s eyes widen as he raises his hands defensively. “Jeez, thought you’d be chill since you and Cas are all loved up.”
“I’m thirsty. ‘Sides I finished it, I’m not putting it back.”
“God, you’re such a sap!” Dean said through laughter.
“Mark my territory?” Dean’s eyes narrow and his tone turns like gathering storm clouds.
“Looks like you two are gunna have a lot in common,” Dean mutters to Jo as they spot him.
Dean brushes his hand up Castiel’s arm until he reaches his shoulder. With eyes locked with Castiel’s, he unclasps Castiel’s robe and lets the fabric slip off his shoulder. Castiel’s lips turn up and he unclasps the other shoulder himself. He gets himself free of his robes, letting them fall down at his feet, his blade lost somewhere in the heap of white fabric.
“Okay, Martha Stewart,” Dean shakes his head. “So am I gunna meet the wife?”
“You’re sick, Sam—”
“No, he offered to do it. He didn’t ask for anything in return,” Dean explains. “He’s different, not like other angels, he’s…” Dean passes a longing look over his shoulder to where Castiel sits with Sam in the living room. “He’s a good guy.”
Dean gives a stiff half-wave and a grin. “Nice to meet you.”
“You okay?” he asks, quiet and sincere. Cas is sporting the same pained expression he had been the other night after the interrogation in the barn. It’s strange, really. For a guy who supposedly has a vendetta against angels, it’s almost like he takes it personally when he kills them. Dean doesn’t even begin trying to understand.
This time Dean’s got a plan. Step one: draw the angel away from the gate. Step two… is still pending, but it’s more than he’s ever had before. He’s got a weighty stone in his right hand, he dips his hand a couple of times, getting a feel for its shape and heft. With a strong pull back, he lobs the stone with a whip-strong overarm swing.
“Uh… whoever wrote this book is pretty convinced that Cleopatra was a, uh, demon,” Sam answers, exasperated.
Yet in just one movement, just the snap of a twig, it became unavoidable. Castiel snapped his mind back to his duty, knowing all that which it entailed. But then, as the cold metal of the man’s blade had struck him, he had fought back a smile. He had coveted the sensation of its sharpness, the energy and momentum of the blow.
“Don’t be sorry, I’m glad I met you.”
“Uh…” Dean hesitates, awkward as his plan is so quickly foiled. “I was just looking for the bathroom.”
“Okay then breathe slower,” Sam presses. “You’re freaking out right now and you’re not thinking straight. You don’t know for sure that anything happened to Cas.”
“Nothing really, just sometimes he’d make comments about how me ’n Sam were supposed to act and not supposed to act,” Dean says, fiddling with his tiny umbrella.
“I don’t want it,” Cas stresses. “If neither of us want it, perhaps we ought to let Jo take it.”
“Then I will answer,” Castiel says. He raises his blade to his own neck and nicks the skin there. A silvery white swirl of grace trickles out, just a small amount that he can easily afford to spare, into a vial he materialises in his hand. Passing a thumb over the cut, the skin knits back together in an instant. He hands the vial, glowing white, to a startled Dean.
“So…” he starts nervously. “What’s you guys’ deal?”
“I wasn’t thinking we use it for you,” Sam continues. “I was thinking we use it on Cas. If we could get Cas up to full strength, he could zap baby Dean back to 2005, right?”
“That’s not like you; you’re usually all over me before I even get out the trees.” Dean straightens his shirt out and leans down to pick something off of the floor. It’s a book. He must have dropped it when Castiel attacked him. Castiel watches with wide eyes. “You alright, buddy?”
, he couldn’t be bought with affection. Except he totally could and both Jack
That pang of guilt Cas had felt in his stomach earlier came back in full force. His body sank as he tried to shrink away from her confrontation.
Castiel tries to speak, but as soon as the words form they get stuck in his throat, his heartbeat racing and pushing him closer and closer to collapse.
Dean’s still clutching the vial tight, holding it to his chest. Despite its cool light, the vial emanates warmth. “Hey, good morning,” Dean says, soft. “How are you feeling?”
“Just one, he’s four.” Dean grinned proudly, his earlier reservations melting away as the joy he felt at the opportunity to talk about his family took over. “My brother’s bringing him over tomorrow once we’ve settled in.”
“We have a spell which will imitate a low-level demonic omen. It should be noticeable enough to attract the attention of the angel on duty, but not so large that they will call it in until they’ve carried out their own investigation. Once we have them where we want them, we will light the holy oil and trap the angel for questioning. From there we will likely have between three and six hours before the angel’s presence is missed, so once we have them, time will be of the essence,
At this point Dean isn’t embarrassed or flustered, he’s just tired. Announcing the same thing over and over no matter how you feel about said thing gets boring real quick. “Yeah, it’s not a big deal,” he says, dismissing any further discussion with a flick of his wrist.
And then he walks away again.
is the one with cause to be suspicious.
Dean grins and now runs his hands over Castiel’s feathers with purpose. Castiel sighs and leans into the touch. Dean’s fingers leave a trail of iridescence as his feathers shift under the light. Castiel shivers, his wings fluttering.
“Ready?” Sam asks, holding a lit match over the bowl. Dean and Cas both nod, and Sam drops it in and begins chanting in a language Dean doesn’t recognise (yet). Cas’ eyes light up up and there’s a bright light casting huge black shadows of thick plumed wings behind him. Both Deans look on in awe as Castiel’s fully powered grace and his vast, unbroken wings are revealed for what will be the final time. Both Dean’s are glad for the chance to see it, the younger for the very first time, and the older for the very last.
Castiel slows as they approach the hillside. There’s a small flat clearing on the slope where Castiel brings them down. By the edge of the hillside there’s a tree standing alone on the grass among the wildflowers.
“Dean!” Jody exclaims, beaming as she pulls away from her hug with Sam. Dean lets himself be pulled into a tight hug.
“There is something different about you,” Azrael states, eyes wide and brows furrowed in focussed curiosity. Dean leans his head back to distance himself from the angel, but Azrael is unflinching.
Dean scrunched up his face in a faux irritation. Of course, Cas was probably right, and even still, Dean wasn’t one to complain about having a literal angel do the heavy lifting for him. Dean opted for a double-box  stack too, but ones marked ‘clothes’; an acceptable compromise for him.
Efram remains tight-lipped. Cas nods, and after a moment, he lunges at Efram and gets a good slice in on his arm. Efram curls into the wound, hand grasping at his injured arm, blood spilling over his fingers.
“Good morning, Dean,” Jack says, clearly taking care to be polite and proper. “Dad says you’re other dad’s cousin who’s also called Dean.”
“Good morning,” Jack chimes back. Cas places a bowl of cereal in front of him. “Thanks dad, love you.”
Dean scoffs. “And watch you moon over the guy? No thanks. I mean seriously, he’s just a guy, Jo. A pretty messed up guy, and kind of a dick if you ask me.”
“I’ll watch over you,” Castiel offers.
“Some chick hit on me at the bar and I had to tell her that I was gay for you,” Dean says.
“You’re back early, was your boyfriend not there,” Sam says, mocking as he enters the room. His footsteps stop short. “Dean, are you okay, what’s wrong?”
Cas huffs out a short breath. He looks away from Dean and watches to door for a minute, as if planning his escape. “I couldn’t speak for a whole community,  but I think my opinion matters somewhat considering I’m a part of it.”
bad. I’m just not a freak like you who sleeps with their knife collection under their pillow to become ‘one with the knives’,” Dean mocks, which gets the childish response of a middle-finger from Jo.
“Nah, she said she was just passing through.”
Sam finally looks over. “No idea. Like I said, I only woke up a minute before you.”
Dean, for reasons that are beyond his conscious understanding, decides one evening to fish out that old box again. The messy tapestry of his life; Flannel on Canvas, c. 2005. There’s a loose thread he’s left dangling ever since he lost Cas, and he has been trying not to pull on it. And nobody else has made him, nobody’s pushed him. Not Cas, because of course he never would. Not Sam, mainly because he’s out of the loop.
“Things change,” older Dean answers back. “I changed. It’s been fifteen years. Fifteen years of- you don’t even know.”
The first thing he searches for is any trace of blight, on the off-chance that some taint had remained even after exposure to the purifying light of grace. When he finds none, he searches deeper, beyond his skin, his bones, to his blood and his soul. There’s nothing… concrete, but there’s a feeling. Something dark, twisting and writhing, something sick and
“I enjoy your visits, Dean. Very much. But they are not worth your life,” Castiel presses.
“You fell asleep.”
“They’re Dean’s,” Cas replies in between bites.
“I reckon we got a bed needing christening.”
Sam’s been quiet throughout the exchange, and it’s only in the brief lull of quiet that anyone notices why. Sam is sitting there, eyes tightly shut, hand at his temple and face screwed up in pain.
“When you find the Men of Letters,” Castiel begins, slow and wary, his hands fumbling in his lap. “I’m going to go.”
“You don’t have to give me anything,” Cas steps forward, bringing the distance between them to just one step. “I’m here because I want to be, that’s my choice. Everything I’ve done for you has been my choice.”
“Fuck me,” Dean squeaks in panic.
“Are you going to kill me, Castiel?” Efram asks, cocking his head.
“Liar.” Dean said with a soft chuckle.
“Uh, yeah.”
“Oh, yes, that would be nice.”
Castiel leaves the kitchen before Bobby can add anything else, retreating behind a closed bedroom door.
to do this,” Sam pushes back.
“Hey, come here,” Dean beckons Castiel over. Castiel obliges and lets Dean take his hand and pull him close. “I don’t blame you, neither does Sam. And I don’t want you to die for helping me, how do you think that could ever sit right with me? I want you here, with us.”
“Well, if you don’t, I’ll just have to bring you a different one until you figure out what you like,” Dean says.
“Mmmhmm.” Jo nods, mouth full.
“Anyone wanna clue us in?” Dean interjects. “Who’s this contact? An angel? How the hell do you even know an angel?” Cas and Victor are quiet, exchanging cagey looks. “Guys, seriously? We’re supposed to be on the same team here.”
“There are ways to make him feel welcome outside of making him into your mini-me.” Sam says, flat. “And it’s still not your fault that he died.”
“Yeah, understatement,” Dean comments.
“Oh, okay,” Cas says. “I just worried that you might have been upset at something I said or did. I know that this bet has been stressful for you and I don’t- I don’t want you to feel like you can’t be around me normally. If you wanted to back out-”
“No, not at all,” Cas replies with a faux-innocent tone. He passes a look back at Dean, who is standing there like a plank looking unimpressed. “Come in, Sam.”
As the last shreds of light fade out and the words dips into the dark, the group gets antsy. The spell is all laid out, waiting only for the final incantation to activate it. There’s a ring of holy oil ready to be ignited, with Victor standing by to set it alight as soon as the angel steps inside. Dean and Jo are hidden behind hay bales, poised to strike in the case that anything should go awry.
“Seriously, unless she is the
“I saw Cas earlier. He said you drank a cocktail.”
The last thing Dean wants is to sit and have a chin-wag with this guy, but there’s something about him that makes him want to say yes. So he gives a slow nod and follows Cas back to the kitchen.
“Well you’re not a demon,” the older Dean says. “Or a shifter.”
“You only live once,” Castiel agrees.
Dean frowns. “Okay,” he says, nodding slowly. The angel doesn’t move or stop watching him. “I haven’t seen anything. Is there anything else?”
“You must be my new neighbour!” she continued.
Castiel’s frown deepens and he looks down, eyes intently scanning the label on his bottle. “Hmm,” he chews on his bottom lip. “You think I look threatening?”
Cas runs his fingertips across the wooden table, watching as his fingers trace the pattern of the wood grain.
With the go ahead from Victor, they head out. This time Jo takes the driver’s seat, with Victor at her side chatting away happily, leaving Dean stuck in the back with Cas. Luckily, Cas doesn’t seem in the mood to make small talk, still sporting the same miserable expression and staring off into space.
Dean paused for a moment, obviously thinking. "I could maybe drive 'em home. When the time comes, do you think you could round them all up for me?"
"Oh, god," Cas sighed, burying his face in his hands and shaking his head. Dean comfortingly patted his shoulder. "How are they going to get home? I can't drive, and Mikey and Luci are way too drunk to be trusted behind the wheel of a car." He glanced over at the squabbling Seniors. They were literally fighting over a dog.
"You've gone on more dates than I have, Dean, so you must really want this to be special."
That should have been Castiel's first warning to get the hell out of there, but April had a death grip on his wrist, and he was too awkward to make up an excuse to leave on the spot. So he sat, continuing to listen to what she had to say.
"Fine? Fine!? You just got the crap beat out of you and all you say is that you're fine?" Dean spun to face the younger boy. "I can't believe it," he scoffed, tossing his hands into the air with exasperation. "My brother is a coward.
~Sheila
"Little bro, you are getting us food," Gabriel instructed Castiel once his brother came into view. He tossed a twenty dollar bill at him, or attempted to. The paper fluttered for a few seconds in the air, then tumbled onto the island that Gabe was leaning on. Rolling his honey-colored eyes, he shoved the money toward Cas, muttering something about how there should be a law that all money is aerodynamic.
"Hey, Dean!" Sam called, waving at his brother as he jogged towards the Impala. Slung around his arm was his backpack, bouncing up and down as he moved. Even from that distance, Dean could already see the traces of s bruise forming. Those damn bullies-Dean would get them back.
Sam cut his brother off with a vexed sigh. "Dean, seriously, I'm fine. I can deal with my own problems. I shouldn't have even told you."
"I wasn't sure," Dean mumbled, picking up the dish–luckily it hadn't broken–and averting his eyes as he cleaned it. "I just need some help for this date."
~Adios, Sheila
Watching for the side, Dean chuckled, shaking his head slightly and slowing his pace to match Castiel's. "Are they always like this?" He grinned, jerking a finger towards Cas's bickering siblings.
Dean chuckled, folding the bandage and pressing it against Castiel's nose. The bleeding had mostly stopped by now. "You'll be alright. To answer your question, it's 'cause of my dad. He trained me and Sammy to make sure we could protect ourselves. He's in the military, so he's big on that whole shpeel."
When he had woken up that morning, Castiel hadn't expected to be approached by the (kind of cute, though he wouldn't admit it) boy who had showed him around the day previous. Dean had seemed exactly like the kind of kid whose friends wouldn't approve of Castiel sitting with them for more than a day. And Cas definitely hadn't expected Dean to invite him, with resigned exasperation, to Meg Master's house for a 'Welcome to Lawrence' get together.
Drunk Novaks courtesy of my monarch queenofallpurple who helped me write the beginning of this chapter. Go check her out if you have time, because if I didn't take this chance to advertise, then I wouldn't be taking full advantage of my author's note.
"Why aren't you drinking?" Cas returned, still not looking up to meet Dean's (brilliantly green) eyes.
When Dean returned to the restaurant after walking Adam around the block, he wasn't entirely shocked to see that much of the mess remained. The mangled plastic was still sprawled across the floor, though there was an opened trash bag in one of the booths for the plastic ware. Instead of cleaning up, Jo and Charlie were making out against the wall, entangled in each other. Just like he had suspected.
On one hand, April had already presented herself as a jerk, but Castiel had to consider the fact that no one as attractive as Dean would stoop to a new boy. Could he just be lucky? That wasn't likely-Novaks didn't get luck.
"Anna?" Cas questioned, spinning around. It sort of sounded like his sister, but much too deep and warble-y. The redhead had Meg slung over her back, the short girl wrapping her hands around Anna's neck. "What are you doing?"
"Fine," Dean snapped, fingers clutching his amulet tightly. The familiar shape slowed his pounding heart a hair, but he could still hear the thundering in his ears.
"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry," the boy apologized immediately, even though it had entirely been Dean's fault. It took a moment to register those stunning blue eyes and ruffled raven black hair-the boy was Cas, the new kid he had shown around. Except now he was very close-as in, literally touching Dean's skin-and without any of his siblings or Dean's friends near them.
With a sigh, Dean twirled Adam's leash around his fingers, making it so that the energetic puppy wasn't able to bounce too far ahead. It was awfully weird that he had seen Blue Eyes again, this time out of school. He had looked awfully tired, even more so then he had during their shared lunch period. Dean wondered if Cas had a father or mother, or if his parents were deadbeats. He hadn't seen any parental figures when the Novak's were admitted that morning. It wasn't his place to ask though.
began to untangle himself from Cas and Adam's leash. Somehow he had managed to intertwine their arms and wrap himself around the other boy as well as cut off his circulation with Adam's leash. Needless to say, it was an extremely awkward situation. "It was my fault anyway."
"This school is awful," Castiel grumbled to himself.
"Hey, Blue Eyes," Cas heard Dean calling, and then a pattering of footsteps from someone running. He felt Dean's hand rest on his shoulder, spinning him around. "Sorry I couldn't catch you yesterday," he apologized, offering a breathless smile. "Didn't get around to it, but I had a question for you." He gave Castiel a quick wink, then raised his hands, both of which were smeared with unreadable marker.
"Brah!" A random jock appeared out of nowhere and punched Anna in the shoulder.
"Hey, Dean," a sort of slithering female voice called his name. When Dean looked up, he saw Meg Masters in all her dark, 5 foot 2 glory, leaning against a white picket fence not two feet away from him. She looked like she was waiting for someone, and Dean didn't want to know who-Meg had a bad rep. Even being only a sophomore, she had gotten into the ring of mostly Senior and Junior stoners.
Editing is for people who have consistent updates...
"Oh. That...that must be nice, having a dad who cares so much."
"Ahem, Tessa, could you make way for Dean?" The teacher requested. Figures she would know this teacher, Dean thought to himself. He seems the type of person she'd like.
"Blue eyes, you coming?" Dean asked with arched eyebrows. Blushing, Castiel shuffled forward, wringing his hands as he muttered a sound of affirmation. "Good, 'cause if I do this, I'm out of detention for a day. Even if it means showing a bit of fresh meat around the butcher's knives."
"Now, Deano, don't be that way," she smirked. "Did you know my cousin Alistair is serving in the same place as your dad? What a shame it'd be if Alistair accidentally hurt him." She offered Dean a batt of her eyelashes, twirling a strand of hair around her finger.
Plastic silverware-completely chewed through-littered the tiled floor. In the center of it panted a shaggy golem retriever with a large bone clamped inside its mouth. Adam was wagging his tail with satisfaction, making the chewed plastic crackle as his tail swept it back and forth. Rushing out of the back room was Jo, her blond hair a mess, and her sweatshirt hanging off one of her shoulders. She looked extremely guilty.
A sharp slap on his shoulder drew Dean's attention to the red haired girl standing with arms crossed behind him. He instantly recognized the pointed pale features of Abbadon. She had once been one of the most popular girls in their grade until she had taken a tumble down the social scale. Now she resorted to petty threats and bullying to get what she wanted, often alongside Meg and a few of Dean's wilder teammates. It was common knowledge not to cross her path, just like everyone knew not to mess with Naomi or her boyfriend Crowley Jr.
"You must be new. I'm Meg," she chomped noisily, sticking out her hand. Mustering his courage, he hesitantly shook it. Her grip was supernaturally strong-it felt like each one of Cas's fingers were snapping. "What's your name? You look like a Clarence."
~Adios, Sheila
What had he just agreed to?
"To improve your attitude, Mister Winchester, I believe I shall have you guide the new students around from the next few weeks."
"It's my Aunt's diner, actually. Closed right now though," he gestured to the sign hanging in the door window, then glared at Adam. "Because of this naughty dog."
"He's actually Sam's-my brother. His name's Adam. You not a dog person?" Dean guessed, unlooping the leash from his ankle and tugging Adam back from Cas, who he had begun to start sniffing.
Lucifer had already pressed the doorbell six times, and, as a consequence, Michael had swatted his arm fives times. Standing off to the side and popping jellybeans into his mouth, Gabe was leaning against the porch railing. Anna, for once, seemed almost nervous. She was smoothing down her red hair, rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet.
Dean knew his first instinct should be to shout 'no frigging way!' and run away as fast as he could manage. Instead, he shifted his weight to his right side, making it so he could comfortably hold his books under the crook of his arm. "What kind of favor?" Who knew? Maybe if he did something for Abbadon, then he would be off the hook. For a little while, at least.
His insides stirred and twisted again, something unexplainable as he made a turn backward through the already open door.
by me so badly, Dean?"
planned on repeating in the future.
The heat in his stomach flared bright, making him moan and pull out before it was all over too soon.
. And I'm gonna keep you." The demon growled as Dean's head kept swimming, body twitching from teasing touches that lasted not long enough.
Without meaning to, he was moaning and nodding in understanding, stroking, rubbing, twisting, pumping until he was a mess.
What followed wasn't what Dean had expected. Cas looked like the words stung, recoiling slightly, face tight with worry and fear. "Dean, you must know I would never- I would never do that to you or Sam I-"
His mouse hovered over the window as he chewed on his bottom lip, taking a look around just to check he’s really alone. He wouldn’t like anything inappropriate to pop up while someone’s looking.
A thumb ran down his sharp jaw, all the way down and pressed at his bottom lip, jaw instantly going slack. It was almost like his brain shut off, body working completely on some primal instinct and his downstairs brain without his control.
Another needy whimper shook through his core as he felt rough, warm hands on his back, running down from his shoulders. The only sound was the blood rushing through his veins and the frantic beating of his heart, accompanied by his heavy breathing. The wall pressed against his chest as it rose, and out of nowhere there was a finger teasing at his hole, circling and prodding. It made him jerk from surprise, but he couldn’t move much, only resulting in squirming helplessly.
The words brought a lazy smile to his face, making him float.
He gave the figure a sweep, combing over the features and characteristics with his eyes. The vessel that the demon was using didn't give him much to work with- nothing that would distinctly tell which one of the seven it was.
"Good. That's very good."
The first thought he got was,
For some odd reason it took Dean a moment or two to register that he was still looking at a
“Dean!” Cas shouted stiffly, effectively shutting Dean up. He wanted to deflect away from what Cas was going to bring up, the realization that it will be impossible slowly creeping up on him. It made his nerves buzz with anxiety.
"And...you're sure that's what you want?" Cas' voice was deeper, the way it gets whenever Dean does something Cas especially likes, and Dean's eyes followed the flicker of tongue over Cas' bottom lip.
There were those footsteps again, and wet fingers being pushed inside Dean. Hot and tingly- still fresh steam rolling inside of his body.
He trailed fingers down Dean's chest and pulled the shirt over his head, laying back and arching with his bare chest as he started on the belt and buckle.
He felt starved, and this was the only thing that he knew could satisfy this need, rooted so deep inside he couldn't know how he never noticed it before.
He focused back up, first thing that drew his attention instantly being the impossible blue looking back at him intensely. It made his skin crawl in a way he couldn't quite place, and it was almost like the air got stuck mid-way in his throat. Framing the blue was a patch of dark locks falling over the features, all messy and wild. God damn sex hair was the only way he could describe it and
He could see the man's lips moving in whispered words that got sucked into his ears whether he registered them or not, and it was like a switch was flipped in his head, something breaking loose. He pushed against the demon's lips hungrily, an unknown urge taking over. His hands wandered and felt everywhere and anywhere they could. He wanted to take and take and
“Huh, well, you know me.” He chuckled awkwardly, putting his hand over hers. “But I’m fine. Promise. I’ll just be a minute. Don’t worry about me, Charlie. Go home to your wife. You always wait for me- she’s more important.” He could see her open her mouth to protest, but came up with a sigh instead, the hand moving to ruffle his hair. “Take care of yourself, Winchester.”
Then, the touch was gone, and he was left with an unbearable ache, pinned to the wall by invisible hands. He heard bare feet against the tiled floor, and then sloshing and hissing of steam.
A head splitting headache and a blinding light took over his senses, and suddenly he was seeing fingers working in an entrance.
"I'm going to talk, and you're going to listen. Find it easy to
The feeling was hard to describe, but he wasn't worrying about thinking of it. Just feeling and experiencing. He felt light inside, but was glued by weight in the real world.
"Pull your boxers off too- you don't have to hide from me. There's nothing to be embarrassed by with me." The words put him even more at ease, erasing the already non-existent doubt.
Dean could hear himself begin to choke on sounds, moans and sobs. He could feel the ache of his throat, how raw it was. Each thrust amplifying the need, and Dean wondered how he's still able to remain conscious, or perhaps he wasn't anymore, but was still able to watch through the demon's eyes. In this whole time nobody had touched his needy erection, yet he could feel how close he was. Feeling himself penetrate and be penetrated at the same time. On, and on, and on.
The grace extended farther and brushed up against Dean’s mind.
"You're so good, Dean...so good…"
His palms were suddenly sweaty and he soon hit the tub full of holy water at the ready behind him,
Cas’ praise was making Dean’s head spin, he neither knew nor cared if it was his headspace or the doing of inhaling Cas’ grace. Both, probably.
His eyes remained on the screen, watching with a blank and unfocused look. At the same time, it felt like he knew just what he was supposed to do.
It was strange, that the demon didn't seem to react to the pain he was feeling...and at the same time, strangely arousing.
He barely noticed as a tingle spread through his body, numbing and relaxing his limbs. Getting heavier. He didn't notice, because he didn't try to move.
Dean could only squeeze out whimper in answer, hands grasping at the sheets. He was painfully hard and his mouth watered as he stared at Cas’ bobbing cock; the head was purpling and shiny with his saliva, swaying enticingly.
The meanings of the words didn't register consciously, but continued floating somewhere in his mind. His body was relaxing along with the flashes, heavy in the office chair as he stared, unblinking. His ears were full of the background hum, his mind empty, eyes focused on the spiral as it began to subtly shift in shape and color. Stretched in and out.
“Cas- Cas! Slow down, damn it, I’m coming.” Dean tried to get out of Cas’ grip but gave up soon after, figuring it was better not to fight it. There was little he could do when Castiel was determined.
He could feel Dean’s erection pressing against his ass while his own cock was sliding in warmth. He knew he wouldn’t last long if he continued on like this- especially with Dean’s blank face staring up at him with a cock in his mouth.
” His hand shot out to wrap around Dean’s neck, squeezing just enough to make breathing slightly more straining. Dean’s lids were already fluttering, eyes rolling to the back of his head before Cas slapped the side of his face just enough to bring his attention back. “No trancing out without my permission.”
Gradually the hum in his headphones died down, but not completely, another sound coming through.
He couldn't form words anymore. Only sounds. And it was all needed to please the demon.
The first contact made Dean splutter, his knees giving out and eyelids twitching. If it wasn’t for Cas, he would probably be kissing the ground. The shock rendered him mute as he tried to gather himself again.
“Fuck, Dea-
He considered it for a moment or two, shrugging slightly and reached or the headset, feeling the familiar weight on his head. He could hear some sort of background sound. A hum of sorts, but it was easy to ignore, so he selected
He felt something stir inside of himself as a smirk slowly grew on the demon's face, and for some reason it just felt like the right expression.
"Can you hear me?" It was a low rumble, yet soft and soothing at the same time. Dean's whole body shuddered, chills running down his spine, but his body otherwise remained unaffected. "I'd like you to nod your head if you can hear me."
Cas pulled away to make space between them, Dean’s legs almost going out beneath him again from the sudden change.
He heard the familiar shuffling of papers, signaling that everybody was tidying up and gathering their stuff at the end of the shift. Last one for today.
to me…"
The demon had dipped something in it.
She took a final glance back at him before leaving through the door. Everything was suddenly enveloped in silence, making him even more aware of his thoughts. The room was dimly lit, only one light left on and the glow of his computer screen.
Finally, Cas’ worry reached its limit as he dragged Dean out of the kitchen to his (technically their) bedroom by the sleeve during breakfast (he couldn’t even wait for Dean to finish eating his apple pie).
It happened a few more times, and he swore he could make out some sort of words, but they were slippery. Gone by too fast. There was a single black dot in the middle of the screen now, and he found his focus shift to it without much thought, words flashing on top of it freely.
and moved on. There was a short description, explaining the same things as before- how effective it is, that it helps with stress, confidence, concentration, yadda, yadda, yadda,...
Cas was merciful and offered the organ to Dean, lowering it against his lips. He moaned delightedly when Dean began to suckle on the head, blissful with his glazed eyes and red lips. Cas knew Dean would do it all day if he didn’t intervene. “Is that good Baby?” He stroked his index finger against the side of Dean’s jaw, smiling when his lids began to flutter and droop after he let out a soft hum. It made possessiveness coil in Cas’ gut at how innocent he looked.
As if reading his mind, the demon ripped off layer after layer with such ease that Dean was throbbing all over for the touch of his hands, skin to skin. His pants were pulled down and kicked away along with his boxers, leaving him feel exposed but strangely not vulnerable. He felt
- - -
Both Dean and Cas looked at Sam unsure look, "Ok, sure." He scooped underneath Gabe's legs and brought him back to a bridal carry. "You're gonna end up dying if you do it on your own."
"Dean? Cas?" Sam stands, the barn empty. Empty for a split second. Like before, a bright woosh fills the barn, stronger this time. It knocks him from his feet leaving him unconcious, but he'll be alright, Cas may have just done that on purpose.
Cas tilted his head in a confused mannor, "Dean, I think it's quite obvious that I am not my brother." Sam couldn't help the snort from him attempting not to laugh coming out. "You called?"
"Give me your hands Gabe." He tried grabbing him when he once again moved away from him.
"Oh my God! Just stay still!" He started to get off the cuffs.
He looked at Dean who had an unsure look on his face, arms crossed, "Really? Not much of a strong lead here."
"Sam? What the hell-"
As if on cue, Arianne walked past, not stopping, "Yeah, Luci has em too, six like his real wings. Hey Dean."
Gabriel was being a little too loud, "Shhh Gabe, why would they kidnapp us and then leave?"
"Dean!" He ran up to him, hugging him tight, patting the back of his head.
Sam gave him an 'I'm listening look' "Yeah, what is it?"
They snuck over to the window to look inside when Dean heard a small grunt, he turned to see a vampire jump on Sam.
Sam put his hands up, "No, no, no, guys, come on, lets just focus on the hunt alright?"
"No,"
Sam turned red this time, "Umm... heh... Gabe, you-youre like really drugged up right now."
"Dammit," Dean whispered and hit himself on the head.
"Sammy... after everything-"
The archangel gave him a wide smile, "You'll just have to marry me! ...Marry me Sam Winchester!"
"You heard that, right?" Cas paused for a minute to stop and listen.
"Oh." Cas got out of the car, "Right... human."
"Uhm yeah, guess I didn't notice... do all angels have those when on Earth or whatever?"
"No!" Sam stared at him with wide eyes, "No, you are not going on your own and we are NOT calling Cas."
"You boys deserve this, there are other hunters in the world. You deserve a life, worry free, a family. Sam... there's someone who's been waiting for you."
- - -
"I don't know man."
"Well, you know, maybe about Gabriel?" Sam's face turned bright red.
"So... you think I could ever see the real things?" Dean pulled away for a second to look up at the angel smirking.
"The kids, they need to-"
Arianne was down the hall lightning speed and into the dungeon, she closed the door behind her and leaned against it. She was completely red and rubbing her eyes.
"What?"
"Heyyyy Loki!" Gabriel smiled brightly.
Arianne kept walking when she heard a small yell. Without thinking, she picked up her pace and found Gabriel's door wide open, "Oh my Dad, Gabriel! You couldn't even close the fucking door!?" Quickly covering her eyes, she reached out to slam the door closed.
"Damnit they must've been more than vampires. Witch vampires? Friggin' witch vamps!?"
Gabriel kept his serious face for a few more seconds then laughed, "Yeah! Anything for my Sammyyyyyy."
Cas nodded as the car fell silent. He closed his eyes though he didn't sleep. "Dean?" He kept his eyes closed.
Eventually excepting the fact that he would have to carry the other, Sam settled on carrying him bridal style. "Wow Samshine, romantic."
*      *      *
Dean's mouth hung open at the glittering black-blue ink, "Damn, Cas." Sam just looked at his brother crazy, laughed, then left. The angel had turned back to reply.
The younger Winchester brother just glared at him, "You are making this so much more difficult than it needs to be."
"I can feel Gabriel's grace." The hunter nodded and got out of the vehicle, Cas following. They both headed to the trunk to grab some neccesities.
He closed the door and turned to Cas smiling, "Let's get it on," they started their fast pace to his room again.
To not be suspicious, the Winchester turned away from his touch to face the building, "So what, we go in guns blazing?"
Out in the hallway, Sam was walking down to his room. He scoffed to himself at the thought of his brother and Cas' little interactions. Just a few doors before his, Sam was stopped by a certain archangel, "Yeah, Gabe?"
Dean smiled, he likes when the angel says his name, "Wait, so you've known that Gabriel is gay? Heh Gay-briel."
The human brothers equiped themselves with large machetes and snuck over to a small house that seemed to be filled with people.
Cas gave him a concerned yet a little hurt look, he hated when Dean got mad at him. He tilted his head out to look and the witch vamp was gone. The angel left the spot he was in and started walking.
"Where is he?" Sam looked around frantically before being slammed into the wall, passing out.
"You should come up to Heaven, live with me and Jack, your family as well." Dean said nothing, only a smile looking on his face,.
Sam AGRESSIVLY ran his hand over his face, "Dude!" Cas was covering his face as Dean laughed at his brother's discomfort.
The angel squinted his eyes, "You... really?"
Dean just now turned to see Sam lying peacefully on the ground, "Yeah, yeah... good idea." He hesitently lets him go, watching him like a hawk as he takes a few steps away to wave a hand over Sam's forehead, him siting up with a jolt.
"If you need me to drive I can, Dean. I know how to-"
Bobby so far has sat there sipping at his coffee, listening intently to all sides. “Those wings
“You know it’s recommended for an adult to get around eight. You should sleep more, Dean.”
The two regroup and amble down the high street with their bounty, enjoying the early afternoon sun and the gentle late summer breeze. The pair, almost simultaneously, spot a quaint little hodgepodge second-hand store. As if on the same wavelength, they head towards it.
“Only three hundred dollars you ever made,” Dean mutters under his breath, directed at the coffee he’s holding just an inch from his lips. Dean knows Cas is goading him. He knows Cas goading him is what got him into this mess. But he’s in it now, and he’ll be damned if he’s gunna lose.
The words feel like tar in Castiel’s throat. Even the thought, the very notion of a purely selfish want is so alien to an angel it feels like blasphemy to even consider it. But even still, the thought is there, lingering in the back of his mind always. Castiel knows what he wants, that’s never been the problem.
badass, too good to be true. Dean always believes in what he can see, and he’s never met the guy, and only heard about him via drunken soldiers in the mess hall or gushing fangirls and fanboys— he apparently has a lot of those. It’s hard to take a guy like that seriously, especially when every rational bone in Dean’s body tells him that there is no way in hell this guy lives up to the hype.
“Tonight.” Dean rolls over to lie on his back. “It was kinda nice. I hate lyin’ to Jody, but… I don’t know it was nice being all together.”
“I, uh, maybe I shouldn’t tell you,” Sam hesitates, wary of this more unstable isotope of his brother. “Timelines and all that.”
“Don’t you wanna settle down with her? Raise a couple kids or whatever?” Dean pushes, honestly just waiting for ‘the truth’ to slip out and confirm what he fears.
Fuck this. Who knows if this other Dean can even help him; the guy’s probably rusty from being out of game so long. He’s probably got a bad back and can’t read stuff close up or see stuff far away. He’s probably got a whole heap of old man problems that Dean doesn’t imagine he’ll ever have to deal with since there’s little chance in hell he’s ever getting old.
Jody stops what she’s doing and faces Dean. “Yeah, shoot,” she says, gently as she senses Dean’s discomfort.
Cas frowns and makes a ‘one-minute’ gesture to Sam. He gets up and drags Dean up by the hand. “Come outside for a minute,” he says in a flat tone. He doesn’t tug Dean, but he easily could. Dean sighs and rolls his shoulders back in annoyance, but follows anyway. Cas leads him by the hand out to the back of the diner. Dean slumps against the back wall with Cas opposite him.
“Did he tell you what you needed to hear?” Dean spits, rounding the table to wash his own bloodied hands in the sink.
“Neither, we mutually agreed to call it quits,” Dean explains. Sam pouts and nods slowly, tuning his head to Cas, expectant.
“Tia, please.” Rachel grimaced. “Here’s me talking about a sweet loving father, and then there’s you flirting with a married mechanic.”
to have met Castiel, he thinks.
, to be given the basic luxury of both; to save the people he loved but to be able to stay with them too. Castiel stopped walking, he stood still, he looked up, if there even really was an up, and in a reversal of reverence he spoke;
“Do you work here?”
“But if I’m out, what about you? I mean why would you stay in it?”
“So,” Yulia began, fiddling with her tall glass and nervously shuffling in her seat. “He’s been coming into the café every morning to get coffee,
Castiel considers for a moment. “Possibly. Possibly not. I meant more so the consequences for all of us. There are things inside the citadel that we simply cannot allow to fall into demon hands.”
Dean gave Cas a weary look over Jack’s head. “Didn’t you have that yesterday?”
Dean puts his hands on Cas’ shoulders and it sends shivers through his entire body as Dean’s warm hands make contact. Dean spins Cas around and steers him into the front room where Victor and Jo are setting up mats to sleep on.
“Well that sounds like a pretty good plan to me,” Bobby comments.
“Nothing like that,” Castiel answers, tapping his fingers against the glass bottle, the gentle rhythm of the light clinks soothing. “I just don’t see much merit in frivolous entanglements when we have important work to do.”
“Dean, talk to me, are you alright?” Cas presses, firm, though his voice still laced with concern.
to date her. I was wingman-ing you the whole time— I literally spoke about how great you were the whole evening.”
Cas looks to Sam, then looks expectantly to Dean, who closes his eyes and sighs. “Come on Cas,” he says with a beckoning hand.
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” Cas states, thoroughly dispassionate.
He’s not trying to impress Cas. Well in a way he is, but it’s solely with the goal of victory in mind. Cas being gay definitely complicates things. He’s still pushing his boundaries the same way, but now it’s with the express goal of tantalising rather than repulsing him. It definitely carries different, much more loaded connotations. But Dean Winchester is not a coward and he’s not a quitter.
"Hey, Cas, you alright?" Anna peered into the room around Castiel's cracked door, just enough to see the left half of her face and a few strands of red. "You seem a bit constipated."
Castiel could tell Dean was avoiding him. During lunch, he hadn't been able to track down the green eyed boy, and had been forced to eat with his siblings–or at least Michael and Lucifer. Anna had been spotted with Meg, hands intertwined, and no one knew where Gabe went. He had hovered near Dean's locker for almost a moment, but then had to scurry off to class. Maybe he had come to his senses, realized Cas wasn't worth his time.
"I was very drunk," he corrected with a small scowl, turning away from the door and stomping off to his room. Michael huffed and rolled his eyes.
"About what?" Anna swung around the doorframe so she was fully in her brother's room and flounced to Cas's bed. "A special little crush?" she teased.
The archangel layed back on sams legs "Fiiineeeee." He let the Winchester work to get off his own handcuffs.
Sam pointed at him, "Yes! Uh- Loki?"
"Yes, I think so." He nodded, "But you seem to be injured, here." Cas reached out and touched his forehead, soothing all of his physical pain.
Cas had remembered one of the things the 'giant' would complain about, "Dean, I believe you should be watching the road-" the older brother was planning to turn his focus to the road after a few more hits when he heard a harder slap.
Dean nodded, "Ok, so where are Sam and Gabriel?"
"So what do you say, brother? We get our happy ending, get what we deserve?"
"Right here Sammy boy." He let his hands out to the side, smile growing by the second.
They look out, Bobby's sitting on the porch in the distance, waving at them to come over. "Bobby-" Sam looks over breathless, everything they deserve.
Sam raised an eyebrow, "Yeah? What's that?"
"No, Gabriel, I mean you being all drugged up." The archangel looked up quickly, squinting his eyes. He dramatically raised up his hand then snapped. Whatever he did definitely didn't get them out of there. There was a quick flash of light as he sent Sam flying into the wall.
The golden haired angel took a lolipop out of his mouth and stepped forward, "Well you know, I get bored here and there. This tecnically isn't even your bathroom." He continued to speak without letting the other respond, "Honestly, I say go for it. I mean, I went for it with Sammy and we ended up fu-"
"I don't know about yooou Sammy, but it seems a liiittle empty to me."
Sam groaned, "Oh my god Gabriel, why are you so difficult?!" The archangel gave him an annoyed look. "Ugh. Baby, could I please have those pins?"
Sam bent over to pick it up, "Yeah, you're not killing him." He shrugged and leaned back in his chair.
"Why the hell are you in my bathroom," he said in a calm but 'about to blow up' tone.
"Hello Dean." The angel of Thursday, one who rebeled and did everything to save the rigtous man, back at it one last time.
"Is some thing wrong with my brother?" Cas leaned forward a little over the seats, of course getting dangerously close to Dean's face.
"Oh! I um, I didn't mean it like that." Sam let out a nervous laugh as he rubbed the back of his neck.
Sam smiled, he couldn't tell if the drugs were still effecting him or not. He scooped him up and started walking inside, "Oh shit its me-" the drugs were definitely still effecting him, "No uhhh Sammy?" He pointed over past the Impala.
Dean shook his head and whispered, "Yeah, if screwing the archangel is nothing."
"So Gabriel must have six..." Sam muttered to himself quietly but his brother still heard.
*   *   *
Cas opened his eyes and faced Dean, "Well, I mean with Gabriel and Sam. Do you think it's strange? I never expected Sam to be a homosexual."
"Tell me it's ok, Sam" After everything that happened, after everything they faced, there was no way Dean could go out like this.
"Hey, Sammy, we're home." Dean tapped the backseat as his brother rubbed his eyes sleepily.
"Thanks Cas. So what, this whole thing was just Loki from the start?"
"Sammy!"
"I- what?"
"Ahhhh!" Gabe said sarcastically but dramatically as he flailed around in Sam's arms.
"I- uh, I'm good, Cas." He kept his eyes on the road.
Sam looked back to the door, "But what about everyone else. Dean, y'know, saving people, hunting things...?"
Gabriel kicked his legs like a toddler "Call me baby! Then maybe I'll let you have them."
Castiel's eyes went wide as he nervously processed what he had heard, "Dean, have you forgotten that my hearing isn't as limited as humans?!"
"Dean?" After seeing Sam the older human brother lowered his gun as he took in what he was looking at.
"Sammich! Ahhhh help! He's talking about my dad and trying to kill me!"
The drive back to the bunker seemed quick, no one really spoke most of the way. Both Sam and Gabriel were laying in the backseat together, sleeping.
He tilted his head and smiled, "Yes Dean?" He nodded down at their hands, "Oh, my apologies." He laughed nervously.
He nodded, looking at the two for a few more seconds, "I have a proposal to make."
"What?" Dean was wondering if he was doing a check in at the most random time, he wouldnt be surprized.
"Yeah Cas?" He turned towards him. For some reason the angel smiled, of course the hunter couldnt hold in his smile back.
Now Dean had started blushing and Sam let out a small chuckle, "Look who's talking," His brother gave him a death glare as he smirked back in response.
"So what, are we dead now?"
"You stupid son of a bitch, dont you ever do that again." Before the angel gets to do his classic confused head tilt, Dean yanks him in by the collar of his trenchcoat, locking their lips together.
The older angel brother groaned, "Oh come on Cassidy! I thought that 'profound bond' would help you get banged already," he mimiced 'profound bond' in Cas' voice.
"-Exactly Dean. After everything! You can't go out like this, man! You can't! We've faced demons, vampires, Dick, Amara, Dean we faced God! I will not let you die from some milk run." He's speechless, staring at his brother as the light fades away, "Cas."
"No idea man," he shrugged and followed after his older sibling, Castiel simply 'poofing' himself into the car.
Gabriel nodded seriously then jumped at him, "Carry me Sammy!"
"There we go!" He laughed and draped himself over his boyfriend.
"Mhm, of course you didn't." He grabbed the human by the hand and pulled him towards the room.
"No Dean, I'm not letting you go." His face changed, the older brother expected Sam to let him go.
*     *     *
"Nothing!" Sam gave a nervous laugh as Cas' face twisted into confusion.
Gabriel shrugged, "Sticks... I don't know what they're called, heh." He grabbed the case and opened it, taking out one of the special wooden swords. He tried to spin it in his hands but it just fell to the ground, "Heh, oops."
The taller man pushed him away, "No!" He stood up then Gabriel followed, stumbling over, luckily he was caught. "Jeez Gabe, hold on to me so you don't fall."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey sis, everything ok?" Lucifer asked her sacrcastically, smiling.
"You're very red again," he reached up to touch his forehead, "and you feel very hot."
The taller man put a hand over the shorter ones mouth, "Are you trying to get us killed?!" After finally getting the cuffs off he moved his hand from the others mouth.
One life is saved, another is changed for the better. Castiel is the reason why. Though his days remain the same, and his duty at this gate wears on him like the rhythmic crash of the tides weathering away the rocky cliffside, he can face it now with a sense of pride at the very least.
Dean shores himself up to match. “I
an item, he might say he were whipped. But they’re not, so God knows what that makes him.
“Garage,” Dean answers plainly, taking off again with his brain firmly in charge this time.
Victor sighs and grits his teeth. “I’m sorry, man. That sucks,” he offers, placing a palm on Cas’ right shoulder. “But I need you to get your head in the game. We need you at your best or we’re all angel fodder.”
“Hmm,” Cas tilts his head. “Well I’m not sure how much delight can really be derived from decapitation. It’s hard work, I imagine my arms will be quite sore tomorrow.”
Castiel nods again. Dean bites his lip and gets up to rummage around the cupboards for his first aid supplies. “What are you doing?”
Dean raises a forkful to his mouth and the instant it hits his tongue, his body melts into a temporary calm. It doesn’t taste familiar exactly - he can’t recall his mom ever making him lasagne - but there’s a homeliness that it embodies so perfectly.
offer.” Dean shoots back.
“Nah, it’s cool. I don’t wanna make anyone talk about bad shit from their past,” Jo says with a shrug. “Especially ‘cause Victor said you don’t really like to.”
“Why don’t you ask Dean?” Cas gave his get-out-of-jail-free answer. Hopefully Dean would have the strength to say ‘no’ since they’d definitely been indulging him too much lately in their shared euphoria at the new house and being so delightfully happy.
“But for me, the most important thing was always doing something with my life that mattered, that meant something. You know back in my pre-law days I had aspirations to be a human rights lawyer, because I thought that I could help people that way. Eventually I realised that the best way I know how to help is hunting, or at least my version of it. So that’s what I’m doing. And if I find that one day that meaning changes, like it did for you, then I’ll stop.”
"What up, bitches?" Charlie grimaced, peeking her head through and greeting them with her customary Spock sign.
"Brah!"
"Jo, I need your help," was the first thing Dean said when he walked into the diner's kitchen. "Help me plan the perfect date."
"Whatever, Dean," Sam said, hiking his backpack higher and storming off in the way that siblings always do after an unresolved fight.
The snippets that Dean could hear weren't exactly comforting. They were clearly planning on doing something. The Novaks needed to be warned, or maybe protected.
"Brah!"
Cas nodded unsurely, handing her a piece which she hastily popped in her mouth after taking the wrapper off. He wasn't sure any other angle he could take.
"Love you too," he muttered sourly, shoving aside a stack of boxes labeled 'FRAGILE DO NOT HANDLE ROUGHLY' and wincing as they clattered to the ground and the contents probably shattered. As he strode out the door, he heard Gabriel mutter, "This is why we can't have nice things, Cas."
After all, none of his siblings were that timid. Dean had learned that quickly enough. Lucifer and Michael hadn't stopped bickering once the entire tour, Gabriel had strolled through the halls like he ruled the place, and Anna had tried to flirt with him more than once. If not for Cas, Dean would have been very pissed and very done by the end of the tour.
"Fine. A Christmas party tomorrow night, and you two are invited."
And who better than a jock? Dean thought to himself, slipping away from the door and back down the hall as quiet as he could manage.
"Oh, er, April, right?" Castiel asked awkwardly, squeezing the piece of paper. "I met you a couple of days ago."
"Hello, boys," Abbadon treated them to a malicious smirk, sliding off the piano and strolling to he door. After taking a peek, she popped back in the room her face in a grimace. The frustration on her face almost drove Dean to a smile. "Crowley's here with that brown haired brat Naomi."
The style of writing looked feminine, but Castiel couldn't be sure. Who would've written him a note, much less such a cryptic one? And who would call themselves his angel? No one was that egotistical.
"I don't like most animals," Castiel admitted, edging away in what Dean assumed was supposed to be a sneaky manner. "Mostly just cats and bees and stuff."
He was very glad he wasn't claustrophobic.
Pink tinged his cousin's cheeks. "I didn't forget!" Jo claimed, returning Charlie's finger point. "Charlie distracted me!"
"Like, why are we even here? On Earrrrrrrrrrrrrth? And who named Earth? Did someone, like, look down and say, 'This is Earth'? Uh I don't think so. Maaaaaaaaaaaybe, maybe there's aliens. MAYBE THEY NAMED EARTH! That'd be cool wouldn't that be cool, Cassie? Cassie? Cass-" Lucifer's drunken rambling was suddenly cut off when he was distracted by the panting golden retriever panting on the floor. Giggling, Lucifer stumbled over to the dog and wrapped his arms around Adam's neck.
His father had been left by his mother. The Novak children had been forced to raise themselves. They never had a real dad at home. His cousin Claire had been put in foster care for years-neither of the other Novak branches were deemed eligible to take care of the girl. And, on the other side, Balthazar had been booted from university, and the youngest, Samandriel, was bullied.
Warning: Short & unedited (I think).
A/N: Shy Cassie is starting to fade, yay! And my chapter are still as slow as frick, yay! This one is barely edited (and I realized the previous wasn't edited either) and fairly crappy oops. '\(•-*)/' at least I updated.
Cas nodded absently, thoughts untethered from his words. Now all he could think of was Dean, and his proud smile and his spiked hair and brilliantly green eyes. The way he had risked a beating from Abbadon to help him, the way he had helped clean him up.
When Castiel opened his locker, prepared to retrieve his notebooks and trudge to the car, a note fluttered our. Written on pale blue paper, the writing was large and loopy, it took a few moments for Cas to acknowledge the writing.
"But make sure you stay away from Dean Winchester-I think I already mentioned that. He'll break your heart like its a twig." April's voice was bitter for a few seconds, and then she brightened and flashed Castiel another grin. And, blowing a kiss at him, she flounced away to leave Cas completely muddled.
"Dean," Tessa said coolly, crossing her arm across her chest and sending him a sharp look.
But he would have to break his heart. Over the years, Dean had gained a rep as a playboy, due to his inability to maintain a relationship. But he had never meant to play someone before-oh, goddammit, his head ached.
"Dean, why do I have to go?"
Dean could've slapped himself in the face a million times over. Cas must've thought he was a weirdo now. What kind of person just snatches someone's arm and starts writing?
"I said it first. Wait for a later chapter, Crowley."
"Let me guess," Dean sighed, "you forgot about Adam." It seems like everyone's been forgetting Adam.
Cas started to stumble over saying something, then stopped short. He seemed to notice only then that he had run into Dean, not just a random stranger. "What-what a coincidence," he chuckled with an uncomfortable grin. "I didn't know you had a dog," he turned to fix his blue-eyes on the golden retriever, slightly narrowing them.
Her face fell immediately and Castiel instantly felt sorry, though he wondered about Meg. They had seemed pretty cozy at her house the other day, but maybe that had just been drunk Anna. "Dammit," she muttered. "I thought he was straight." Then she continued with a sigh. "As your sister, however, I am obligated to help you choose a good outfit."
"A small kind," she purred, the remnants of her false smiling finally falling away. Without pausing for Dean to answer-if he wanted to talk, he could've easily interrupted though-she whipped away from Dean and strutted down the hallway, in the direction of Meg.
Cas had fallen asleep on a strange couch, and now he didn't know where he was. His rib cages ached, and his head pounded.
"It's alright," Dean
Charlie waved a dismissive hand as she joined Dean in cleaning the dishes. "Whatever. Dean, what do you think of that new Novak kid? He seems dreamy," she winked.
Crap. When Cas returned from the bathroom, Abbadon was there, smirking as she sat on the piano. Why was she sitting on a piano? Castiel wondered. Why did the Masters even have a piano? She held a phone to her ear, and seemed to be talking to someone over the phone. After a few moments, her expression soured and she vehemently tossed the phone at the couch. With a thud, it landed on the couch cushions, earning a glare from Ruby and who Cas had inferred was her girlfriend.
"Yeah. So?" He really hoped that shy little Cas Novak hadn't befriended Meg. He seemed like the type of person who she could wheedle and prod into bad things, even though he acted well-behaved enough.
"Castiel, turn around," Michael ordered without missing a beat, or even glancing at his little brother. Somehow, Michael always knew when anything happened, bad or good. "You're going to fall into Gabriel, and you're going to make a commotion, little brother." His voice was icy, and Castiel was sure Michael was glowering. "Do you want to make a bad first impression?
Dean took one last glance at his hands before slamming a fist against the wall, wincing as they collided. He squeezed his eyes shut, focusing on his breathing and not on the fact he was going to break Castiel Novak's heart.
"Sorry," Cas murmured. Then, clearing his throat, he spoke slightly louder. "My name's Castiel-or just Cas for short."
Stepping out of the doorframe, Meg gestured for them to come in. She led them to a family room type place, where Ruby and a blond girl were sprawled out together on the couch, intertwined. Other than those two and Meg, no one else was there (not that Cas would be talking to anyone anyway), so Castiel inspected the room.
After snapping the clip on Adam's collar, Dean smirked at the couple. "Good luck," he called as he walked out of the door backward, saluting his cousin.
"Is Ruby going to be there?" Sam asked nervously from beside him. He was fiddling with his long hair, and adjusting his clothes and shifting in the seat anxiously.
"Cas, hurry up," Anna groaned, elbowing her brother in the back. "You're going the speed of a snail. A snail that's dying."
Then her smirk grew, and she twisted on her heels and jogged away to a tall, dark haired man.
"I think I mentioned this, but your siblings are very bad at being drunk," Dean commented from over Castiel's shoulder.
A/N: A crappy, short, unedited chapter. :/ Sorry guys. I just wanted to update.
"I'm still calling you Clarence," Meg decided, smirking and leaning back into her seat. For the rest of the bus ride, Cas felt uncomfortable. He could feel the girl's dark eyes trained on his, watching him like he was some sort of prey. He did not like this situation. Not one bit.
Sighing resolutely, Cas typed the numbers in under a new contact heading 'Dean Winchester'. It was then he heard a loud voice from behind him, shouting, "Hey!" over and over. At first he ignored the person, assuming he or she wasn't trying to talk to him, until someone rattled his shoulder. The grip was tight, like iron.
Meg scowled, taking another swig of her drink then setting it down with a harsh clank! "You distract him while I sneak out the window," she demanded, eyes darting around as she attempted to speed walk out of the room. It was too late, though-the door swung open to reveal the couple afterMeg had made it but a few feet.
He had rung the bell on the top of the door and they quickly broke apart. Jo, blushing furiously, Charlie exasperated that Dean had interrupted them. His eyes flicked from his cousin to his friend, then he pointed at them both and spoke in a serious tone. "Your fault when Ellen gets mad." With that, he turned around and walked right back out the door, tugging Adam along behind him.
"Yo! Cassie! Dude!" A deep voice called from behind him.
There was something about him that Dean couldn't quite figure out. And maybe, just maybe, he didn't really want to know.
Tense with anger, Abbadon and Meg were held in a glaring contest, eyes flickering over the Novaks every few seconds. Luci and Michael were arguing beside the drinks that Meg had set out, Gabe could be seen sucking a lollipop he had pilfered, and Anna was leaning against the wall near Meg. However, Cas was hovering awkwardly near the door, fiddling with his fingers.
When Dean returned from calming drunk Anna, Cas had disappeared. Lucifer and Michael were arguing over. . .was that Adam? Anna was making out with Meg in the corner, and Gabe was harassing ninety percent of the party by showering everyone in skittles ('FEEL THE RAINBOW' 'TASTE THE RAINBOW' 'BE THE RAINBOW'). Dean, mostly regretting his decision to come to Meg's, leaned against the wall and watched the chaotic scene unfold.
"Yes, I'm fond of 'and stuff' too," Dean joked with a grin, jerking back the dog's leash again to make sure he didn't bother the new kid. "By the way, what're you doing here?"
Instead, he had brightened slightly and snatched Cas's arm, tugging a marker from the spine of his notebook. He had uncapped it smoothly, pressing the lid between his lips and gripping the writing utensil in his right hand. The tip had tickled as Dean scrawled down ten numbers, then dropped Castiel's arm. With a grin and a spin, he had said over his shoulder, "Text me, Blue Eyes," then jogged off down the hallway, notebooks and a binder tucked in his arms.
Your angel.
"Well. She's going down down in an earlier round. . ." Cas murmured as Dean hoisted him up, brushing off the boy's coat and jeans.
"Like you're one to talk, Gay-briel," Anna laughed behind her hand as Gabe sent her a glare.
Meet me outside the school tomorrow morning.
WARNING: UNEDITED
"Ellen, I'm so so so so sorry-" Dean began, rushing through the diner's door, bell ringing as he entered. Then he acknowledged his surroundings. "What. The. Hell. Happened?" he asked in surprise, surveying the scene.
He pondered this for a moment, staring at his shoes and resisting a blush. He registered faintly that Principal Mort was introducing the Novaks-the triplets as Seniors, himself, a Junior, and then Anna as a Freshman.
Right?
Castiel was straight. He was definitely straight. Just because he could tell another boy was attractive, that didn't make him gay, right?
"Why do I hurt so much?" Cas grumbled, pinching the top of his nose and cringing as he felt his tender skin.
"...no fricking way..." That was clearly Meg.
A small smile played across his principal's mouth. Over the course of three years in high school, Dean had been sent to the office many a time, and the principal had developed a soft spot for him. Unfortunately for Dean, punishments were dealt fairly when deserving.
"Practice," Dean chuckled, swigging down his soda to wash away the burnt rubber taste. "So, Cas, how was your first class?" Castiel shrugged slightly in reply, eyes and fingers focused on popping open his soda tab.
"Dude, you were flirting with my dog."
"Jerk," he muttered to her under his breath, shouldering by Tessa, even though there was a clear path around her.
Dean tapped his fingers on his steering wheel, drumming a steady tune to match the son playing on his radio. He loved this car-his uncle Bobby had helped him fixed it up the year before, and now Dean could barely manage to let his baby out of his sight. It was a beautiful car. No, more than beautiful, it was-
Jo didn't have the audacity to blush, instead shrugging in admittance. "And?"
"Hey, Blue Eyes," Castiel heard Dean say, sliding up next to him. "You're siblings aren't very good at being drunk you know."
"I'm a Junior, same as you, remember?" He flashed a self-confident smile.  Then, raising his voice slightly, Dean asked, "Where do you all want to go first?"
How do you like my Cassie so far? I know he isn't very much like the real Castiel, which I'm sorry about •~• but *heavy sigh*. Oh well. Please tell me how you're liking this story so far, point out any errors, ect.
"Technically, Lucifer was an angel, he's just fell," Cas offered a genuine smile. Even he knew his family was weird.
A/N: Half the length but twice the update time, I know, and I'm super sorry. I've just been pretty busy with school, since I have a lot more homework than I've been used to previously and I've been working on a bunch of other stories (such as the Short Stories of Supernatural, hint hint).
Now Cas stared at the black marks on the pale inside of his arm, then at the phone in his hand. He actually rather liked texting, as it didn't involve-shudder-actual human involvement. He didn't have to stutter and wobble around his words over the phone, or try to meet someone's eyes. Still... he reminded himself, if you text, you're bound to talk. And talking is bad.
Gah. Sam hated parties-even though this hadn't officially been a party, the number had exponentially increased-and he had piles of homework to do. At least the Novaks weren't too bad (even if one of them was the devil).
~Adios, Sheila
Cas tilted his head, shifting himself so his position more resembled sitting than sprawled across a couch. "Would Meg really do that?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have pizza!" Cas called as he shucked off his trenchcoat and took of his shoes. He set the still-warm box down on the counter, shifting a container filled with silverware out of the way. All of his siblings were no where to be seen, but it wasn't like there was much of anywhere they could go in this house.
"Dude, that's an awful attempt at a pickup line," he managed between laughs.
"This school is awful!" Dean ranted, pacing across the hall. With a roll of his eyes, Sam Winchester watched his older brother. Most of the time, he had learned to stay out of Dean's way when he got angry. "You can't let them beat you up like that, Sammy! I'm gonna give 'em a piece of my mind-"
Cas shuddered inwardly. Over the past few years, he had been in enough schools to know that there was a reason people hated the American educational system. It was because they were all literal hell-especially his previous school, who'd had Satan as their mascot. Just because they could. Lucifer, though, had gotten quite a laugh out of it.
"Dude, stop preening. You're acting like a girl. Ruby's gonna be there, yeah, but stop freaking out." Dean rolled his eyes, not turning to face his brother as he tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, comfortably resting his palm against the familiar material.
"First things first, stay away from the Weirdos-" she wrinkled her nose, like someone had tossed garbage at her "-they're well, weird. First there's Charlie Bradbury, complete geek. And," she gagged here, "really. Really gay."
Clearing his throat, Cas raised his voice slightly. "My name is Castiel." he said, sliding the gum back into his pocket. Silently, he prayed for Gabe or Anna to come sweeping in and save him. He wasn't good at talking to girls. Or really people in general-he had used up all his social skills earlier with Dean Winchester.
She returned the glower with icy blue eyes. "A new pony," she mocked, batting her eyes at Dean for a moment before straightened and intensified the state with Dean. Especially in her black leather outfit, she was intimidating, but Dean wasn't really in the mood to surrender. "What I want, Dean, is for you to do me a favor."
"Great," Dean clicked his tongue, winking as he sauntered away. "I'll text you the details.
"Who for?" She asked over her shoulder as she scrubbed the pile of plates in front of her.
Jo narrowed her eyes, training her inspecting gaze on Dean for a few moments. She combed his appearance head to toe, making Dean resist the urge to shift his weight between his feet nervously. "Fine," she accepted finally, her lips pursed. For the next few minutes, they continued to wash and dry the dishes in their normal routine until the Management Door swung open.
"He'd be great in theater, wouldn't he?" Michael grumbled, stalking after her brother with crossed arms, which left a frizzy haired Anna and a smirking Gabriel near the door.
"Oh, come on!" Dean groaned, stomping after the teacher, but not without a string of expletives said under his breath.
...so yeah, barely edited.
"Dean, where are you?" Sam shouted over the warbling and bass pumping in the background. "I can't see you anywhere. Did you go off somewhere to make out with Cas?" He asked, and Dean could hear the taunt in his voice.
Cas knew his face was flushing even harder now. "It's an actual place," he insisted, forcing a small smile, his eyes flickering up to almost meet Dean's. "As ridiculous as it sounds." Dean snorted again. "I swear," he repeated, slightly more confident this time, still feeling the color on his cheeks. "It's where my dad was born and grew up-it's a place for really religious people. Hence the angel names." Cas bit his to keep from snickering-it had always amused him to live in 'Heaven', especially since the small town was far from a utopia.
"Dean, what's wrong?" Jo sighed, not even needing to look up from her sudsy dishes to sense something was off with her cousin.
Cas did not want to be stuck between Anna and Gabe bickering. He did not want to be in a car with Lucifer and Michael arguing over directions. And most of all, he did not want to be going to a social event. For some reason, Michael and Lucifer agreed on something for once, though they evidently did not agree on how to get there.
Tell me whatcha think 'n' stuff, and poke that little star.
"You seem to really like that Novak kid, Winchester," Abbadon snickered, wrapping an arm around Dean's neck and slithering next to him. "So I have a little favor to ask you." Her smile was devilishly wide, red lips prominent against her pale skin.
"Hell's two blocks that way, sweetie." Abbadon's smile was poisonously sweet as she gestured in the direction of school. "But Hell's Queen is right here, in the flesh." Keeping eye contact with Dean, she aimed a sharp kick at Cas's gut. Dean's eye widened and, without thinking, he slid out the window and dropped to his feet. After a moment to recover his balance (but not his sanity) he jabbed Abbadon in the stomach, catching her by surprise enough to have time to swipe a punch at her nose. Her hands flew directly to her face, leaving her stomach open for Dean to headbutt her. Abbadon's expression went slack as she stood still for a second, teetering back and forth on her feet with shock. Smiling sarcastically, Dean reached out a a single finger and rapped her on the shoulder, sending the ginger tumbling onto her back.
(See the end of the chapter for
"For not telling me of course, you asshole," she snorted, flicking back a blond strand of hair and glaring at her cousin.
"Yeah, they kind of are," Cas mumbled, focusing on his fiddling hands.
"What?" Sam asked, glancing in the direction Dean was looking. "Oh, crap." He agreed under his breath. "What are Satan's child and his perfect little angel doing here? I thought Crowley Jr. and Meg hated each other."
A/N: I don't know if 'Heaven' is an actual town but '\(•-*)/'
"Don't call me little bro," Cas muttered, snatching the money. "And what makes you think I'll be your servant?"
"Dean, you are literally the biggest Atheist I know and you still celebrate Christmas," Jo responded pointedly. "Plus you could just not make it too big. A small get together would be fun for a first date. It'd help you avoid awkward silences."
"This is all so weird. Someone told me Dean was this huge jerk, but–he's been..." Cas pause, searching for a word that wasn't cute or hot. Because that totally wasn't what he thought of Dean Winchester. "He's been really nice."
Cas snorted softly, awkwardly scuffing the heel of his shoe against the cabinet. "No, not really," he murmured.
Adam immediately began to whimper when he spotted the house. "Shut up, Adam," Sam and Dean commanded together. Shooting a glare at each other, they climbed out of the car, shutting the doors with a tad more force than necessary.
"I feel like crap," Cas mumbled, propping himself up on his elbows and blinking his clear blue eyes rapidly. "I'm also wondering how you know how to fight so well." He brushed his messy hair from his face, groaning as he did so. "Correction: I feel worse than crap."
"No! No–it's just that Bl–Castiel is really shy, so I want it to go well, you know?" Dean protested. "I feel like it'll be kinda hard for him to make friends here, so–"
"Is he always like that?" Anna asked, popping a bubble, her lazy gaze fixed on Dean. Cas didn't really like the way his sister was looking at the boy.
Finally, after Luci's fifteenth ring and Michael's fourteenth scold, a young, dark haired girl that wasn't Meg opened the door. "There's this thing called patience. I think you should try it." The girl snapped. Then, raising her voice, she yelled, "Meg, get your butt down here; those new kids are here!" And followed the shout by slamming the door in the Novaks' faces. A moment earlier, it was opened again. This time, Meg was the one standing in the doorway.
"Legally, that's his name," Gabe smirked, chewing on a wad of tootsie roll.
Dean chuckled, though what Cas had said wasn't really that funny. They stood without talking for a few moments, Dean seeming to hesitate about something. "Where did you move from?" he asked eventually, taking a swig from a water bottle. "I meant to ask you earlier, but I forgot."
A/N: So, recently, I haven't updated much and I'm sorry for that. My excuses for no updates are as follows: 1) writer's block, the bane of my existence 2) school work. And YouTube is pretty good at distracting me.
"He was born Nick," Anna put in."he changed it to 'rebel'. Our dad's über religious." She tossed her long red hat over her shoulder and snuck a glance at Meg. She paused, then finally asked, "Are Abbadon and Meg dating?"
Jo tsked, tossing Charlie her washcloth. Grabbing the hamburger buns from the top shelf of the supply shelves, she began to prep for the dinner rush, shaking her head chidingly all the while. "You know, I told you not to take the business course," Jo reprimanded while rustling around in the fridge.
"Oh, crap," Dean grumbled as he saw a pudgy boy in black step out of a car, accompanied by another teenager with her long brown hair pulled up tightly. They were both dressed in clothes bordering on formal; neither showed a hint of the stains and wrinkles customary to high schoolers.
And I introduced a bit more of the plot, yaaaay! Also, I'm thinking once I have more chapters, that I'm going to probably combine every two chapters into one. Opinions?
"Uh, picking up dinner for my family," Cas mumbled. "Gabe said there was a diner here."
"Mom's gonna kill me if she comes home to this," Jo said seriously, running a hand through her tangled hair, fingers organizing it slightly. "You, Charlie, are going to help me clean this up. Dean, take Adam for a walk." Jo instructed, swiping the dog's leash off the counter and tossing it to Dean. He caught it swiftly, then kneeled down, brushing away some of the mangled plastic.
Dean was straight. Definitely straight.
Meg glowered, ripping open a bag of chips and forcefully emptying them into a small bowl. "What the hell, Abbadon," she muttered. Once the chips seemed to have all tumbled out, she smashed the plastic into a ball and chucked it at the wall.
Dean had no doubt she'd carry through with the threat–out of the four grades at Hunter High, Abbadon would be voted 'most likely to become an assassin' if the school offered the title. Torture was her business, and she monopolized it. And while it might break Dean's moral compass, he valued his dad's wellbeing over a new boy's, despite how cute the aforementioned boy was. Whatever Abbadon wanted him to do, he'd have to deal with.
"Giving Megara the Sassy a piggyback, brah!"
For a few more minutes, the girl continued to babble, mostly offensive comments about the Winchester and the football team in general. Castiel desperately wanted to edge away from the situation, but he was too nervous to interrupt her, and the girl never seemed to stop dragging on. Finally, when Cas was worried he'd never escape, he felt a hand clasp his shoulder and a girl leered over at April.
The way he was Dean Winchester.
A/N: Apologize for the long wait😁! This chapter just took a while (though I might be sticking to a real update schedule soon *cue gasps*). And I promise you a lot of this will come into play later and I'm not just inserting characters for fun.
"BRAHS! BRAHS! DUDES! OH MY GOD! WHOSE '67 IMPALA IS THAT? IT'S A CLASSIC DUDE BRAHS!" Anna pressed her face against the window, eyes wide as she stared at the street. With a sigh and a clap on Cas's shoulder, Dean headed over to 'Brah'nna.
Sometimes he wished he lived with Ellen and Jo and Bobby. They were his family, but he didn't want to place a burden on them. After all, with the combination of his dad's paychecks and the money he earned between his two jobs, Dean was able to support Sammy and himself. He was just lucky they didn't have to pay rent-John had bought them a family house a few years back, though he was rarely home. Dean didn't blame John, though. He fought for their country, and bravely too.
"Nothing," muttered Dean, focusing his energy on scrubbing one tiny patch of a plate dry.
"I gotta get home tonight, which means I'm driving. There's no way I'll risk crashing Baby," he said, the pride in his voice audible. At Cas's pause, he added, "My car. It was my dad's first-a 1967 Chevy Impala. She's beautiful."
Castiel sighed, creasing the note down the spine and sliding it into his pocket. The only way he could truly know would to be there.
"Uh, I'm Castiel," Cas murmured.
As soon as Castiel unwrapped a piece, a girl darted beside him, leaning across the aisle with a sly smile on her face. "Is that gum? Can I have a piece?" Her pale face was clouded with dark strands of hair, but Cas could still clearly see the wide grin on her face.
After finishing his second slice and wiping his hands on his shirt, Castiel debated what to do. He could do homework, but he really didn't want to-he could always use the excuse that there were troubles getting adjusted. It had worked in the past. If he wasn't going to work on school stuff, he could unpack, but Cas didn't want to do that either. Once he took everything out of the boxes, he inevitably had to put it back. It was just too much work.
Jo immediately slugged his arm, causing him to drop his plate to rub the red mark. "Ow! What was that for?" he protested, rubbing the spot where he knew a bruise would form.
"Uh, Dean. The kid who showed us around school."
Castiel Novak trailed behind his older brothers, clutching his bag tightly in his arms. He shuffled forward slowly, making eye contact only with the tiled floor. Of the five Novaks, only he seemed to be the slightest bit nervous.
Charlie smirked at Jo. "It's not my fault I'm this gorgeous." She gestured to herself and then flipped her hair, making Jo laugh. Then she sobered up, taking one last glance around the room.
Dean was mostly focused on finding his brother, but he knew his angel would be upset if they didn't get Gabe too. His angel. Dean shook his head a little. No. Not his angel, yet. He shook his head again, why was he thinking like this?
- - -
Dean wasnt expecting that question from him, "What?"
"Call me baby."
"You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. Should we take it to my room?" Blue eyes looked up at green as he nodded quickly. Dean grabbed his hand again and led the way.
Gabriel just gave him a small troublesome smile and pulled off his shirt, turning around. "Ari told me you were talking about them," Sam stayed silent staring at the six golden tattooed wings on the shorter being's back, "Theyre not as impressive as the real ones, but pretty cool, yeah?"
"Oh my dad..." Arianne whispered shaking her head. She walked off again, the two only looking up after she was gone.
"Dude really? You wanna see Gabriel's?" Sam just shrugged back, "I wonder what Cas' looks like."
"Huh?"
"And you're sure?" The blue eyed being gave Dean a small annoyed look.
"Sammy," Gabriel greeted him with a more sEdUcTiVe voice. It seemed like Cas was debating wether to fly off or not. "I heard my name, you guys talking about me?"
"Well look who it is," he said annoyed while also attempting to make Sam embarrassed.
"There." Sam circled a town on his map of Ohio. "I'm sure the Vamps will strike here next."
Gabe tried to kiss Sam but he turned his head, he settled for kissing him on the cheek, "Yup! But I know you love me, Loser."
"Guess where we are?" Sam opened his mouth to speak but was cut off, "- some kinda jail cell. Oh! And guess what these are?" He held up his wrists, they were bound by handcuffs but his arms weren't behind his back, "- Enochian handcuffs. Cool right?!"
"Really? Why do you have it?" He became more curious by the second.
She shrugged, "Grounded angel thing? Wait, how did you not notice this before? We slept together like four times." Arianne had one of what Dean liked to call a Cas moment.
"You know what? I am pretty damn tired!" The archangel snapped both himself and Sam away.
Cas furrowed his eyebrows, "I see that you are uncomfortable. You don't have to answer."
The taller Winchester scoffed and gestured at the map, "Come on Dean! They've striked 3 towns already! Same road, same distance. How many others are gonna die from them, huh? Plus, we are literally on the case, right now."
*   *   *
Ari turned to look at him, coffee in hand, "I... think so? Why don't you just ask Gabe or Cas... I mean, Luci if you really wanted to."
"Wait... he's here," Gabriel's mood switched to serious.
"Wait now," The giant turns to Cas with a confused look.
"Wait shh, I hear something." Sam moved close to the wall, not having any weapon to defend them.
The angel nodded and looked at him, "No worries Dean, this is practically nothing." He gave a small smile before sitting back in his seat.
The hunter cleared his throat, "Come on Gabriel, we need to get out of here."
"Ayeeee Cassie!" As Sam got next to Cas, Gabriel reached out and ruffeled his hair, "Sooo, you with the boytoy yet?"
Sam smiled, "What about before, huh? Still got a few hours left of driving so-"
Cas walked over to be in front of the freckled brother, "You know happy meal, I don't remember doing that." They both started another intense, what seemed to be, staring contest. Dean had more of an annoyed look, the other being slight confusion.
Dean let out a shakey breath he didn't know he was holding and let himself forget the world. He let everything go, all the hate, the hurt, everything. "God Cas, I love you so much." He finally came back for air, resting his forhead against the angel's, *his angel's.
He just laughed at her for awhile. A really long while, "Looks like you're not gonna leave this room for some time. Come on, lets play a board game!"
Sam stared at Cas' hand, thinking hard. "We deserve this...?" He looked at them both, "Yeah... you know what? We deserve this."
Dean whipped his head around to look at Sam, "Woah, since when does Feathers always tag along on our hunts?"
"What the hell?" Cas looked around, that was definitely something new.
Gabriel scooted closer to him and booped his nose, "Boop! Heh, you're so cute."
He took Cas' hand, the light shining once more, leaving the barn empty.
He was going to tend to his younger brother when he realized they were extremely outnumbered, even with the extra angel help. This definitely seemed like more than a normal vampire hunt.
"O-kay, you know what? Lets focus on the hunt!" He turned on the music but couldn't help to notice the adorable head tilt Cas did. Gabe looked at him and wiggled his eyebrows, "Hey! You better stay out of my head dude!"
"Dean!" He turned towards them both.
"Woah now, don't want me to get impaled again."
Dean, Cas, and Sam all sat in an awkward silence. The green eyed man thought about saying something in order to ease the tension, but only made it worse, "So Sammy, wanna tell me something?"
Dean didnt expect him to ask that either. Was he? No. He never had feelings for a man. Plus, Cas isn't actually a dude, just his vessel, right? "I- um..."
Dean turned his eyes back on the road. "I don't know... I mean, I'm fine with it y'know, but just Gabriel, I don't trust him."
Dean shook his head, "No, he killed Loki, remember."
Dean checked his watch, "Oh come on Sammy, we still have a few hours left of driving!"
Dean shakes his head, patting Sam's shoulder a few times, "Sammy don't... he's not gonna-" there's a woosh of light in the corner, catching both hunters by surprise. "C- Cas?"
Gabe nodded his head, "Oh, hells yeah. They said we'd never make it out of here with me like this, and honestly? I totally agree!" He laughed and layed down.
"You got a better idea?" Dean said while opening his door. "Hey angel, lets go," he tapped on the window to get Cas' attention, he seemed to be lost in his own thoughts.
Ari turned her head a little, "Hmm? Oh that, just a tattoo that showed up awhile back." There was a tattoo of purple wings spread across her upper back and shoulders.
It had been a particularly quiet weekend at the bunker. They found it a little suspicious, but everyone took advantage of the calm anyways. Since everyone was only lounging, they were wearing quite comfortable clothes. Arianne didn't mind that she was the only female currently staying with the boys, so she just wore a sports bra and some sweatpants. It was the early morning so she assumed only Sam would be up anyways.
The angel gives a slow nod, "It had to be done to get you here."
He pushed past him and headed back into the room with the others, "Let's go." He picked up the keys to Baby and went out the door.
"Ok everyone just shut up! For the rest of the ride. Ok?"
The blued eyed being nodded, "Don't worry, my brother truely cares for him, Dean."
He smiled and jumped on top of him, "Oh- Jesus Gabe!" The celestial being only smiled and pulled him into a kiss. After he pulled away Gabriel started kissing all over his face.
Gabriel went over to help when another vamp tackled him. Just as the other boys were heading over to help out, there was a flash of light and they were gone. The vamps, Gabe, Sam; all gone.

Dean gave a small nod, "Wait Lucifer has six wings?!"
"Wait," they stopped in front of Sam's room as Dean slowly opened the door, checking on his brother. The room was dim but he could see Sam and Gabriel curled up together underneath the sheets, sleeping peacefully.
"Well good morning Samshine!" Sam sat up and rubbed the back of his neck, with the restrictions of handcuffs. When his vision cleared he could see the archangel sitting near him.
Sam sat across from him, furrowing his brow, "Not really... do you not want to continue this hunt?" The older boy turned his head towards the TV, "Dean, I can go on my own or call Cas-"
"I uh... wow." Sam stuttered as the archangel went to put his shirt back on, "No- wait." He put out his hand to stop him.
"Dean!" He looked around, almost not seeing Cas  standing to his side at all.
As if another cue was sent, Castiel walked into the room, shirtless. "Oh... Sam, I thought you'd be on a run. And Dean, well still sleeping. He looked a little embarrassed as he turned to walk away, showing the tattoo.
The hunter furrowed his brows, "Why the hell would I ask Lucifer?"
Gabe stood up and his toes and gave him a small peck, "Oh well! I mean it Sammy."
"Ha, jerk."
- - -
"They should be in here." Cas pointed at an older buliding.
He went dead weight in order to make things difficult for Sam then snapped his fingers. They were suddenly in the Impala. Dean and Cas were in the front, Sam and himself in the back.
Dean didn't look behind him but he could feel the tension as Cas got upset, "Gabriel! Be quiet."
"Ok, here we are." Dean gave his brother a little tap to wake him from being half asleep.
"Okay." Dean turned to head to the building and ended up running straight into Cas. "Shit, dude!" Dean touched his face, his nose was bleeding.
Suddenly Dean's face changed, "Thats is what you meant, right? I-I went over it in my head so many times, thats gotta be what-" it was Cas' turn to cut him off now, smile returning and pulling him back into a kiss.
The older man got out and opened his door, "C'mon Sammy, rise and shine."
"Wait, Sam watch out!" Cas called out, getting Sam to move out of the way just on time.
Sam covered Gabriel's mouth once again, "O-kay thats enough Gabe."
There was a whooshing sound behind them, the older man put his hand on the bridge of his nose, "Well speak of the devil."
It happened to be a very small 'hallway'. So small that the angel and the human were both pushed close together at the chest, "Jeez, who designed this place?" Dean said, trying his hardest to keep space between them.
"They're safe. A loving home with their Aunt."
Cas walked back to him, "Dean, we will find them," he was just trying to reasure him.
"Nothing that she hasn't seen before, right? Didn't you two-" Sam cut off his archangel with a rough kiss, he didnt want to listen to whatever snarky comment he had.
"Oh! Let me fix that, Dean." He pressed two fingers to the man's forehead to heal him. Dean closed his eyes at the touch, he noticed the Cas left his hand on the side of his face for a little longer than neccisary. "You usually walk the other way, Dean, be careful." His voice was soft.
Sam gave a sad look as his brother turned his back, nightmares again. All of them delt with it but Dean always seemed to have them every night, "Did you ever notice that Ari has a tattoo?" The shorter man turned to him, silently answering no, "They're wings... hey I wonder if any of the others have them too."
Cas tilted his head, remembering the past topic, "So what is it about Gabriel?"
"Uh, Gabe... wha-what are you doing here?" The 'Moose' was trying to hide the fact that his face was burning up.
"Hey, did you hear me? Don't you ever do that again, ok? I... I love you too much and that really messed me up, ok?"
The human smiled and couldn't help blushing, "Did they give you something?"
"Shut up, we can talk about it once we get out of here." Dean nodded and started to turn around, might as well take care of the monsters later.
"All of this? For the guys who started the apocalypse... more than once?"
"I.. uh- just um, is that actually what your wings look like?"
"Morning Sammy." The older Winchester trudged into the room sleepily, going to fill the spot Arianne was in before.
"Ok, so what, are we gonna go in, hopefully get one captured, and make them lead us to the nest? Real practical." Sam gave a sarcastic statement.
The archangel did a big, dramatic sigh and shrugged, "Whatever." Just as he said that, the bunker's lights started to turn red, "Wow Sammy, this is really setting the mood, if you know what I mean ;)" Sam scoffed at the being he was carrying.
He turned on the faucet and started to splash water on his face. Why couldn't he be around Cas without feeling hot and nervous? He splashed his face again.
