John was forced to return to 221B Baker Street after a break down against the woman – Allison – as she sat at Donovan’s desk. As he was escorted out by Lestrade and another officer, the woman was in tears, apologizing for something that she was not at fault for. A cab was hailed and paid for by the detective inspector, instructing the cabbie to take John directly to the flat, even if the doctor told him otherwise. During the ride, all he could think about was the video, his anger growing with his passing moment – anger at the video, the abductors, the woman…himself for losing his situational awareness upon seeing his friend disoriented the night prior.
“We lost the van near Cavendish Square. They managed to hack into the traffic cameras, putting them on loop. We were unaware of the breach until then.” Admitting that they were ignorant to a crack in their own system did not appear to come easy to the man Sherlock had once referred to as “being the British government.”
“Anyway, I just wanted to stop by, check in, make sure you were doing all right,” the detective inspector said as he took a step back towards the door, avoiding Sherlock’s comment.
“Why do you give a fuck? You were just there to fuck his ass,” Cruz responded nonchalantly without any hesitation. The comment made John flinch, which thankfully went unnoticed as Cruz kept his gaze on the wall.
Sherlock attempted to stand, but it was forewent as a kick to his chest caused him to fall backwards down the steps. He hit the wall at a bend, groaning at the fresh bruises forming and small shards of glass sticking into exposed areas of skin. He moved backwards down the stairs as the shadowy figure made its descent, finally hitting the flat ground at the end. Despite his injured and bleeding feet, he stood up, stumbling down the hall and back to the room he had been held in.
He had made multiple calls for the return of Sherlock. He had offered plea deals, ways for the Cielo Diablos to leave the city without alerting any form of authority, complete immunity to any charges as long as they returned his brother alive. Each time, he had been denied, even so much as being told he would have his brother returned in pieces. Yet, the way Dreln spoke, it was clear the American was never aware of any such bargain.
Even Dreln’s reaction was of surprise at the comment as he went back to scrolling through his mobile. The normal confidence Sherlock exuded fell the wayside under his brother’s cold eyes; it was the very same look he was given that night when he was sixteen – when Mycroft left him bleeding and curled up on the floor.
Seeing Mycroft’s indifferent expression, John had to fight every fibre of his being wishing to treat the eldest Holmes as he deemed fit.
Setting his hands on his hips, he shook his head. However, his attention was drawn to John Watson jogging up to him and shoving a slip of paper against his chest. He took it as John pulled his hand back.
The streets were fairly vacant and the streetlights already lit, casting shadows every which way. A couple was walking on the opposite side of the street, both obviously intoxicated, whereas they were both laughing obnoxiously as the two men could overhear them discussing past matters. The woman was latched onto her partner’s arm, doubling over and stumbling several times before they turned the corner. Even as the distance increased, they could still hear the couple’s laughter. There was a man talking hastily on his cell phone, walking towards the duo, paying them no attention as he was heard shouting at the person on the other end, who Sherlock concluded was his wife, judging by the tone and subject. He failed to notice the six-foot detective, bumping into him and offering no apology, instead flowing into a slew of curses to the woman over the phone.
When they arrived back at the house Greg went straight to the kitchen. He rummaged throw the fridge, he brought somethings out, grabbed some others from the counter and cabinets. Sigyn sat at the peninsula and watched. He pulled out a lemon, a few potatoes, 3 salmon fillets, a couple tarragon, a bunch of parsley, some basil leaves, a garlic clove, bowl of greens and what looked like a citrus dressing.
John, Sherlock and Rosie were at the lake by the time they got there. Rosie was chasing a butterfly, John was watching Rosie and Sherlock was sitting under a tree. Each of them had on a swimming suit. Rosie had on a pink one piece with flowers all over it, her hair was braided away from her face and a little pair of goggles on her forehead. Sherlock had on a pair of purple board shorts that had bumblebees all over it and a purple shirt. John had on a red pair of swimming shorts that had a white cross just above the left knee and was topless. None of them has shoes on.
"I've done the calculations and looked at it from many different angles. I've come to the educated decision that I will vacate from the doorway and proceed to move about the rest of the house." Her father cracked a half smile and gave a small chuckle.  She moved from the door frame and grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge. She'd never seen her father smile before, little less laugh. She needed to study what had happened, take in everything. She sat at the peninsula and studied.
"I suggest you hold on. We love to run." He lightly placed his hands on her hips. She smiled to herself and started Mattie off running. Within seconds, Greg's grip got tighter and his seat got closer.
Getting as close as he dare he got to hear the most perfect good bye speech from a man that has said those words much to much in his life.
"There's all this stuff, all this science equipment. I left it all in boxes. I don't know what need doing. I thought I'd take it to a school."
"Your worse than you father. Here, sit up." Sigyn sat up with a groan. Greg handed her a bowl of soup and a spoon.
"I think your father's having a mental breakdown. Who'd have thought a child's game would do it." Again Sigyn and Greg couldn't help but laugh.
"Go, help him. Don't change what happened. Try showing him what affects will come of it. All the pain he causes, at least try and find out why." At her words the doctor jumped back to the controls, after kissing her on the cheek and making her blush slightly, EERrwWwooooooSHHHhEERrwWwooooooSHHHh.
She was finishing a tree when a knock at her door drew her from her thoughts. She waited a second for another knock. It would be her father with two knocks, other wise it was Greg. No second knock.
"My pleasure." Greg handed Sigyn his plate but never took his attention from John. Sigyn added some pasta and bread before handing it back. He took it and handed her his salad plate. She added some salad and handed it back with some dressing. Mycroft followed suit and she gave them back just the same. She waited for John's plate. He just kept talking about Sherlock.
"Good. My apologies for not being there when you got off the train. I had an emergency that required my attention."
"One for you, another for me, and the last one is for" Greg looked at Sigyn who had tears in her eyes. Greg stretched out an arm and signaled for Sigyn to join them. She joined Greg on the floor in a tight hug. Mycroft was at a loss of words.
"Look Rosie, it's not a lake monster." Rosie stopped splashing and opened her eyes and laughed so hard she almost fell off her tube.
"Right. It's hot, there is a nice lake out there and I am inviting your uncles and cousin over. Would you care to join us?"
"Two rows of black diamonds, one on each side, a plain black strip in the middle. It looks plain from a distance, but once you get a closer look it's beauty shines. It can be engraved on both the inside and on the strip."
"Oh. I. See." It was obvious she wasn't comfortable helping them anymore. She slowly put back the rings. She turned to one of the other sales woman and whispered something. The woman shook her head and walked over to them.
"My dearest Gregory. You are always one step ahead of me." Greg was still on one knee but his face was spotting a confused look.
"I understand your concern. Now go back to bed! You are not going to be good to them if you get sicker!"
Greg gave both horses some oats, fresh hay, and clean water. When he was done he got a saddle and bridle on Mattie. He then got a bridle for Gladstone, the yearling was not happy about that. Greg tied Gladstone at the front of his stall before he mounted Mattie. He guided Mattie towards the entrance of the barn grabbing Gladstone's rope before they left. As they rode he kept it at a slow pace, giving Gladstone encouragement along the way. After about two hours, he returned the horses. Once they were back in the appropriate stalls, he started the grooming. He brushes out their hair, checked their shoes, and gave them an apple as a treat.
'I'll finish the game then take her upstairs'. He scooted down on the couch a little bit and got comfortable.
"We are the smartest people on the planet. Some more then others. My brother is the only exception to the rule." Sigyn finished the last place setting and waited for her father to finish.
"Go back to the computer's matrix and stay there!" He turns from her in a huff, hoping to shield the longing in his face. Taking a long deep breath, River walked over to him and gently placed her hand on his shoulder. He instantly relaxed at her touch.
"Uh. Hm. You... you told me once that you weren't a hero. Um. There were times that I didn't even think you were human. But let me tell you this, you were the best man and the most human... human being that I have ever known, and no one will ever convince me that you told me a lie. And so... there." It was at that moment he walked up to the stone and touched the top, "I was so alone and I owe you so much." He turned to leave, not even making it two feet he turned back, "Please, there's just one more thing. One more thing. One more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don't be... dead." He nearly squeaked the last word out, "Would you do that, just for me? Just stop it, stop this..." With his head bowed like he was praying he wipes his eyes clear of his hidden tears. Composing himself once again, he straitness up like a perfect soldier, turns on his heals and walks away.
"Rumor has it your Uncle Sherlock has problems with this game too" Sigyn and Greg laughed only to be stopped short by Mycroft glaring at them with folded arms.
"I quit! I'm done playing childish games." Mycroft sat back on the couch and completely ignored Greg and Sigyn's laughter. Sigyn cleaned up the cards as Greg tried to calm Mycroft down.
"Well, the TARDIS thought you could use some help with building your cabinet. Seeing as you have your screwdriver out she must be right"
"Uncle John! I've missed you!" She hugged John and smiled when he spun her around. Greg entered and greeted John. They started to discuss the book and ignore her.
"Good night Sigyn. Sleep well." He turned to leave her room and saw Mycroft leaning against her doorway. His arms were crossed and a small smile sat in one of the corner of his mouth. Greg motioned for Mycroft to move. Both men cleared the doorway but stayed in the hall.
"Exactly. Your driver will take you to my house and I will see you tonight." She was a little disappointed that she had to wait to see her father.
"Why are you going to a fixed point in time? You know what will happen, all of time...at once. We've been there, done that, it was our wedding." She smiled at the memory.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes, if you please Father." Sherlock straightened his back and glared at John, who only smirked back.
"Sig, sweetheart. I brought you some tea. You need to try and drink some." Sigyn whined and rolled over. She sat up. Her eyes remind closed. Greg picked up the mug and brought it close to her mouth.
Her mind wondered. She thought about her family, her lack of friends, how her father was in a relationship, and how would she tell him about what happened with school? She sat back up and started Mattie off toward the barn. They ran to the edge of the lake and slowed to a walk. Greg was finishing his swim. He walked out of the lake and grabbed the towel he brought with him. He noticed them and smiled when they walked up.
John had forgone returning with company, instead hailing a hack and choosing to return to Baker Street, though he was certain he had only gone back out of habit rather than want. The anger had somewhat subsided during the ride, which Lestrade had been kind enough to pay the fare. When he exited the cab, he did manage a passable acknowledgement to the cabbie, who bid him a good day before he shut the door. As they drove off, John stared up at the door leading to the flat of 221B, wondering why he chose to come back, knowing that unnerving silence would be the only thing beyond.
He shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket, inhaling as he stared at the numbers on the door. Though he knew it was illogical, he found himself hoping to hear Sherlock playing the violin when he opened the door, with the music echoing down the stairs to the ground floor. Yet when he opened the door and heard nothing, a sharp jolt shot to his chest. While he logically knew there would be nothing, his heart could not help but drop at the confirmation.
“John,” her voice finally pieced through the veil of haze. “Yeah, a minor one by the looks of it,” she responded to a question the doctor did not hear. His vision began coming into focus, the features of the detective filling his view. “Can you stand?” she asked, to which he groaned as he rolled to the side, nodding. She helped him to his feet, holding his arm as he stumbled.
At the comment, Mycroft reached down and grabbed Sherlock’s groin. “Is this what you want to know about?!” he said with a ferocity Sherlock had only heard a few times before. The contact immediately caused Sherlock to go rigid and his arrogant demeanour to melt away, the colour draining from his face. “You’re so determined to know everything, after all!” He pinned Sherlock against the door, his knee between his thighs and his hands moving downwards to undo the belt to his brother’s trousers.
At the question, the woman, Allison, jerked her head up, as though coming to a sudden realization. “He is missing?”
The recollection of being violated and humiliated ran across his mind and Sherlock found himself creasing his forehead, complete uncertainty raging throughout him. He began recalling all the times John had stayed with him, when anyone else would have abandoned him: his initial verbal reading of the older man in the cab, John being near death during his first confrontation with Moriarty, his rejection of companionship during their time in Baskerville, his return after his supposed-death and John’s initial rejection.
“Not necessarily,” Sherlock replied as he took the cup, holding it still for a moment, as though welcoming the heat from the porcelain. “It doesn’t open for another two hours, so I assumed you would welcome something else to abide our time.” John glanced to him with a raised brow. “Incidentally, there’s a situation involving a woman missing her mother’s ashes and many of her left antiques.”
“Isn’t there a new case or something?” he put emphasis on the last word, wanting to gain some sort of response. Yet, the only response he received was Sherlock’s nonchalant shrug.
Sherlock’s jaw tensed before he glanced from John to his crutch against the table. Though he did not take his hand back, the conversation was quickly ended with;
His mind sunk back into itself, leaving him on the floor in the room. As he looked around, he saw both his brother and his best mate watching. While John’s look was compassionate, Mycroft’s was that of disappointment. He knew his eyes were red, his face sunken and being broken. He made eye contact with both of them before landing on John’s gaze, those eyes that he had become so accustomed to over the years without ever realizing. Seeing the expression he would have expected on his best mate’s features given the situation was one to make him break.
“I’m flattered,” Sherlock spoke nonchalantly, despite his heart skipping a beat. “But I do have matters to attend to – more important than those of your
I had about two pages of this down, but tonight, I decided to actually sit down and write how I wanted this chapter to go. I had to watch some clips of "Sherlock" to get me where I needed and, once I was there, it was like ::BOOM!!!:: LET'S DO THIS!!!
The moment seemed to drag before the obstruction was pulled from his throat, giving him a moment of reprieve. Dreln positioned himself, his hips directly overtop Sherlock’s head as his forearms kept him propped up, allowing him to thrust his hips forward over-and-over, moaning with each lunge. Sherlock gave up trying to push him off, accepting being used like nothing more than a doll as he tried not to gag each time the impediment hit his uvula and further.
With the hacksaw still on Sherlock’s neck, he pulled it back, creating a jagged cut on the exposed skin. Blood immediately began to drip down his neck, causing his fight or flight instinct to take hold. His hand went from grabbing at the man’s wrist gripping his hair to the hand holding the saw. While his vocals stayed predominately silent, his facial expressions grew frantic, his good leg kicking about as the hacksaw managed to draw forward, cutting deeper.
It was the confirmation he did not know he needed: he had found them – found the people who held his best mate. He took his hand from his hilt of his weapon, eyes moving to the door at the opposite end. With their voices fading, he made his way over, gripping the handle and slowly inching it open. He did not know what he was expecting.
He looked at John, furrowing his brow as he scrolled back to play it again. They met gazes as the speakers echoed:
“Fucking asshole can’t keep his mouth shut.” He made eye contact with John. “Have all the fun you want, ‘cause he ain’t going anywhere anytime soon.”
Sherlock himself had never been interested in pursuing a relationship and he had made that abundantly clear. As had John with his disinterest in men in totality.
The older man stopped and turned to look at him. The reaction and his expression spoke volumes, as if Sherlock himself had gone mad. “No. We’ll be on time.” Sherlock nodded, despite John’s look that of befuddlement.
Without any prompting, the man brought their mouths together; reactionary response had Sherlock clenching his jaw. The American spent a few moments trying to get Sherlock to open his mouth, which he had to force by pressing his fingers into Sherlock’s cheeks. The moment there was slack, he sucked the genius’s tongue between his teeth before biting down, garnering a muffled shout as Sherlock’s tongue retracted from reflex. The man pulled back, grinning as he licked Sherlock’s blood from his own lip.
Within a few minutes, Sherlock was dressed to his normality, overcoat and scarf included, and he and John were out on the sidewalk, walking to the restaurant John had been so looking forward to.
Clenching his jaw, he slowly spoke, “Sherlock…there is nothing to absolve you from – you did nothing wrong.”
The roar of the shower cutting on barely drowned out the blood pounding against his skull. A hot wash would help to refocus his mind and get him out of the spiral he found himself in. He avoided his reflection as he stripped down, even his subconscious not wanting to see the damage that was still healing. Stepping in, even with the steam billowing upwards, he increased the temperature, wanting to feel anything that was not the torrent raging inside his mind.
After the next few steps, the crunching of glass ceased and he was left with nothing more than the metal grating. At the end, he noticed another door to his right. Its wood was painted black. Along with the colouring and rotting wood, it would have been easily missed had it not have been searched for. While curiosity wondered where it led, he ignored it, his will drawing him to a dimly-lit entryway only a few steps further.
“Expect and accept top surveillance until you’re able-bodied,” Mycroft said, eyebrows raising as Sherlock snorted in response. The younger man tossed the now-empty container of yogurt onto the tray, making it a point to ignore the banana that had since gone cold. “Perhaps even longer, if need be.”
“Just like when we were younger,” Mycroft said as he caressed his brother’s cheek. “It will always be your fault.”
One of the officers holding Dreln jerked him forward towards the door Mycroft had come through and the two officials left with the man, whose silence and concerned expression brought a sadistic amusement to the Holmes brother. Down the hall, Lestrade passed the trio before entering the room through the same door, approaching Mycroft. Mycroft interjected before the detective-inspector was able to get a word out. “Where’s Sherlock?” he asked, trying to maintain his proper attitude, despite anger on the edge of his voice.
His shoulders dropped and he shut his eyes, head shaking as he was introduced to nothing more than a janitorial closet with its light turned on. Closing it quietly, he glanced back to the door he came through. There was a sub-level beneath the structure, he just had to find it. Given the dead end, logic dictated the stairway to the sub-level was beyond the door that held the two people he had been overhearing. Any chance of avoiding confrontation dwindled. The door shut softly behind him and he crossed the hall to the opposite door, where he could still hear the two talking.
John knitted his eyebrows in confusion. “They?” Mycroft looked at him, as though not understanding what John failed to comprehend. “Who are “they”?”
Sherlock glanced to him briefly and went back to the text on economics, eyes darting from word to word. “You’re home early. Couldn’t sew your seeds?” he asked with a nonchalant expression as Mycroft sent a glare. “So primitive. I expected more from you.” He shut the text and turned to face his brother.
. “Cielo Diablos, originating in Mexico, moved to the US and now they’ve managed to move operations to the UK. We got intel from overseas that they had planned to open several rings here,” he went on as John crossed the room to skim the article. “We managed to shutdown two of their operations, one which they had based out of Wales. One of the men we brought in said they had planned to set one in London, which we’ve been trying to locate for weeks.”
Taking his chances, he set his laptop next to him and reached across with his free hand, touching Sherlock’s jawline. It was an action that the other was not expecting, whereas he tensed, his brows furrowing as he looked to the older man. With his heart pounding in his chest, John took a breath. His very actions had the chance of pushing Sherlock away, but he had nearly lost him. Donovan’s words echoed across his mind:
“Sherlock, get out,” twenty-three-year-old Mycroft slurred, catching himself on the footboard of the bed.
I've been gone on a job for weeks, which made it impossible for me to actually sit down and work on this.
Eyes tracing the room, Lestrade saw the opened door leading to the corridor his men had come through. With Mycroft on his heels, he went to the door, passing by an old janitor’s closet to the left once passed the threshold. Lestrade motioned for the Holmes brother to go first when they arrived at the edge of the stairs with Mycroft’s shoes clicking on unfinished concrete. The first few steps echoed the crunch of glass under his shoes before shifting to metal grating. Rounding the corner, he heard the pleading voice of John Watson and the sound of beeping from an AED.
A cold metal met his forefoot, along with the honeycomb pattern of a grate, as he stepped up. After a few curved steps, light emanated from somewhere near the top, reflecting off a grey wall. He stopped, listening for a hint of life. Hearing nothing, he lifted his foot to the next step.
“Doctor Watson,” he broke the silence that had been between them that had encountered them each time they were around each other since Sherlock’s recovery. “Thank you…for taking care of Sherlock.” At the comment, John jerked his head towards him, believing he had heard him incorrectly. Unable to form a response, he could only watch as Mycroft left the room, his shoes clicking on the floor tile.
. Even with logic telling him it was in the past and he had nothing to concern himself with now that it was over and done with, the emotional – irrational part of his brain took over. It was as though he could feel the Earth’s very rotation beneath his feet – the true oxygen to nitrogen ratio in the atmosphere.
Sigyn made her way to the living room floor next to Greg. Greg was setting up a game on the coffee table as Mycroft sat on the couch. Greg stopped mid set up and stared at Mycroft, slowly he narrowed his eyes.
"Uncle John. Him and Uncle Sherlock have been in the papers a lot lately. I was simply stating that he will fit in with Uncle Sherlock's crazy ways." Her father smiled at the way she quickly came up with that. It made her a little sad that he would be disappointed in her in matter of a few hours. He will be getting the letter from her school today and want to discuss it tonight. The food was brought to the peninsula and plates soon followed. Everyone took their seats and began to eat. No conversation, just the sound of silverware on plates. When they were done eating Sigyn gathered the plates and cleared off the unwanted food. Before she had a chance to start the dishwasher Greg had a load in and waiting on the plate she had in her hand. Her father was upstairs changing his clothes. The dishes were done and put away by the time he rejoined them. He was dressed in a three piece dark blue suit.
"I gave Uncle John a hug before I came in here," he hugged her tighter. It made her giggle and give a little scream. John knocked on the door.
"Sounds easy enough" he tied his towel around his neck and steadied his nerves. She reached around her small frame and waited for his hand. He grabbed her hand and held tight. He got a handful of Mattie's mane. He got a small jump and threw his right leg over the horse. As he vaulted onto the horse   Sigyn leaned forward and slightly to the opposite side. He made it up and gave a small huff of air. He slid back slightly.
Greg was standing by the back door. He had on a pair of blue and green board shorts, a blue tank top, sunglasses that made him look like a television cop, and a towel wrapped around him neck.
"Myc, the movie's over. We need to go to bed. Come on honey." Mycroft raised up off Greg and laid his head on the cushion behind him. Greg stood up and shook his head. He walked over to Sigyn.
"Ugh! Fine! I'll find out how he feels before you ask. Ok? If everything is fine you propose, if not just wait a bit. Ok? Feel better?"
She was a few chapters into her book when she heard a car door slam, then keys being moved around and finally the door opening. She stayed in her position on the couch, not moving a muscle.  She knew it was her father. She looked up and the face she saw was not her father's. She was looking at a man with greying hair and soft brown eyes. He had a slight stubbed face and a leather jacket on. When he spoke he had a light cockney accent.
She walked down the hall and into her room. She was hoping for some alone time with her father. Looked like that wasn't gunna happen. She changed into some sleeping clothes and climbed into bed, hopeful that it was all a dream.
"Your approval." That shocked Sigyn. Why would he need her approval? She had nothing to do with their relationship.
"Yes love. You can keep him." Rosie laughed with joy and tried to wiggle off the saddle to no avail. Sigyn lifted her up and placed her on the ground. Rosie ran up to Sherlock and jumped into his arms. He hugged her tight. John joined them and wrapped his arms around both of them. Sigyn smiled and took Gladstone into his new stable. She gave him some grains and locked him in.
Facts: her father was in a relationship, he acted differently, he spoke softly, he stood in the kitchen cooking, he was still in his pajamas, he laughed and smiled. She thought back to the year previous. He was acting different then as well. Was it Greg? Could a single person have that much impact on a person?
'The driver will open the door. I'll have a another copy made for you.' Before she finished reading the message the driver had the door open and bags inside. She thanked the driver and closed the door.
"I'm not sure if I could dream up a better companion for my father. You are the complete opposite of him. You get him to do things nobody else could. He is much happier. I give you my approval. I would be happy to have you added to our crazy family dynamic."
"Just sleep. I'll be back in a bit. I have my phone if you need anything." Sigyn mumbled a response. Greg left her room and walked down the stairs. He grabbed his boots and jacket. He sat on the bottom step and put his boots on. He picked up his keys and wallet before leaving. As he walked to the garage he put his jacket on. He unlocked the door, opened it just enough to walk through and entered. He put the keys in the ignition and started it up. He zipped up his jacket, put on his backpack and helmet, hopped on his bike and zoomed off. He considered calling a car but figured his bike would be faster.
"You need to stay hydrated. Come on sweetie." Sigyn took a sip of the tea. It was hot but not enough to burn her.
Sherlock was frantic. He looked right past her as he called her name. He had his suit on but his tie wasn't tied and his cuffs were open. Sigyn touched his arm and he jumped.
Greg was waiting at the edge of the lake for Sigyn. He waited almost 30 minutes before he decided to run home. Sigyn always picked him up before riding home. Greg entered the house and ran up the stairs. He was gunna knock on Sigyn's door when he heard the reason why she didn't pick him up. He entered her room and headed straight for the bathroom.
"And all of time happened at once. See? That's my point." The Doctor said all in one breath. Realizing this was going no where. The Doctor stood up and walked to a very tired John.
Mycroft finished his trip early and wanted to surprise his family. He got out of the black town car and noticed a light was on. He turned his key and opened the door. The TV was on a sports recap show.
"Come on sweetie you need to take your medication." She whined and sat up. He handed her the toast. She just looked at it.
John Watson was sitting in 221B having the same Saturday night conversation he had every week; with a young, tall, lanky, quirky, bow tie wearing Time Lord. Ever since Sherlock's fall, John and the Doctor have the same conversation with the same boring dialogue every week, with very few variations. 'I need him. Bring him back. I don't care what happens', 'I can't, it's a fixed point in time. Maybe he had his reasons. What good would it do, other than stop you from driving me mad?'
"Father, I would like to take a gap year and not major in international affairs." She had never interrupted her father before. She didn't know how he would react.
"I know girl. But what else can I do? I'd be the same if I lost you or my sonic. Come on! Let's do it for John. What do you say?" He asked as he slowly and lovingly stroked the consul. WwooooSHHHhEERrwWwooooooSHHHh "That's my girl!" He replied with a small appreciative smile. As he jumped around the TARDIS, he felt the presence of another soul. He pulled his sonic screwdriver out of his coat pocket as he quickly whipped around, he was face to face with someone he never expected to see again. He was staring into the blue-green eyes of his favorite wild, smart mouth, ginger haired, gun wielding, archaeologist. River Song!
"Here Matts nummy carrots" Mattie nibbled at the stock all the way to the end. Mattie sniffed Rosie's hand, up her arm and around her neck. Rosie laughed.
"I would like to take the Holmes name. It comes with power and respect. I would be honored to hold it."
"I just came from John, in the future. Is there anything you want to know, or want him to know?" The Doctor turned away from Sherlock, not wanting to see him jump.
The day of John and Sherlock's wedding has finally arrived.  Everyone was gathered at a small church just outside of London. Not much decorations was done on the building.
Rosie let go of the horn, stretched out her arms, closed her eyes, and leaned back onto Sigyn. Sigyn grabbed the reins with one hand and placed the other on Rosie's stomach. Rosie let out a slow sigh.
Not bothering to stop the Doctor snapped his fingers and the T.A.R.D.I.S. door flew open. First thing, punch in the date of January 15, 2012. Next the location: Bart's hospital roof. EERrwWwooooooSHHHhEERrwWwooooooSHHHh *long loud groin*
Greg threw his hands in the air and huffed away. She was expecting something like this. He never stayed home more than a night.
"Uh, sure." She went to the kitchen. She placed the popcorn maker on the counter and plugged it in. She got the butter out of the fridge and popcorn out of the cabinet. She poured the popcorn, placed the bowl and waited for it to pop. The first bowl popped and a second bowl replaced it. She popped a few pieces in her mouth. The second bowl was full and the maker was empty. She grabbed the two bowls and headed to the living room. She handed one bowl to her father and the other to Greg. Greg sat in the middle of the couch with his left arm stretched over the back. Mycroft was leaning into Greg.
When she left the barn Sherlock, John and Rosie were walking up to the house hand in hand with Rosie in the middle.
Mycroft smiled as he pulled out his phone. He stood on the other side of the table and snapped a photo. He turned off the light and headed to bed. On his way he changed his lock screen. Greg loved Sigyn and Mycroft never wanted to forget it.
"What does this look like to you?" She looked over his shoulder and saw a slide under a microscope lens with a red substance on it. As she learned over to have a closer look Sherlock turned away and grabbed a book off his shelf. She looked at the slide and was instantly confused.
"Sherlock doesn't appreciate the beauty of these magnificent animals." Just then Sigyn's father walked up behind Sherlock.
This is the story of a 15 year old girl. She was born in London, England to a father with the power to start and end a war with one phone call and a mother who will never be named.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the coming together of one Doctor John Watson and one Mr. Sherlock Holmes. All of us need and desire to love and to be loved. And the highest form of love between two people is within a monogamous, committed relationship. John and Sherlock, your marriage today is the public and legal joining of your souls that have already been united as one in your hearts. Marriage will allow you a new environment to share your lives together, standing together to face life and the world, hand-in-hand. Marriage is going to expand you as individuals, define you as a couple, and deepen your love for one another. To be successful, you will need strength, courage, patience and a really good sense of humor. So, let your marriage be a time of waking each morning and falling in love with each other all over again. I do believe the couple has prepared their own vows, John, if you would please"
"I hope you're Sherlock Holmes, if not I'm too late." Glancing to look at the thin man and noticing the startled look, the Doctor then realized he probably could have handled his arrival better.
"I'm sorry to intrude, Sigyn your father said he'll be leaving his office and will be home in time for dinner. We should go."
"Me. I wanted to get to know you. Earn your trust. Show you how much I care for your father. In the process, I've come to care for you as well."
"Ok daddy" John walked the yearling around. Rosie was nothing but smiles. They were making their third round when Sherlock came running out of the house.
"Because," ZAP! The Doctor stuck a sleeping serum into John's neck, "I have things to do and you can't be left alone" John fell limply into his arms and was carried into Sherlock's room. John had spent every night of the past 4 years in there. He claimed he could still smell his cologne. It doesn't help that the Doctor sprays it in there every other day, hoping it would bring comfort to the once strong doctor. Once John was in bed the Doctor dashed down the stairs right past Mrs. Hudson.
John kept the flat in the same state it was in when Sherlock was there: his chair remained in its same spot, a knife in the un-paid bills on the fire place right next to his "friend's" skull, microscope and slides still on the kitchen table, even the dust line was left un-touched. The only difference was the man himself, he was no longer physically there.
Wow, a weeding. Her uncles were getting married. She sat up and grabbed her sketch bag. He father and Greg sat under a different tree, away from them. Greg was sitting against the tree. Her father was sitting between his legs leaning against him. She started sketching them. She just finished Greg's legs when a thought came to her.
"I know love. Let's get you to bed." Greg lifted her off the ground and carried her to her bed. He covered her with a blanket. He sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed her back.
"I thought about it, but I realized I'm closer to you than I'll ever be to him." She looked at her uncle and try to think of words that would express how honored and loved he made her feel.
"Sigyn" John handed her the rains to Rosie's horse. He dashed over to Sherlock and turned him around to look him in the eyes. They spoke in a voice to soft for Sigyn or Mycroft to hear what was being said. Sherlock tried to pull away but failed. The ex-army doctor was to strong. Sherlock shook his head and dropped his shoulders. They talked for a few minutes before Sherlock wrapped his arms around John. John lifted his head and kissed his cheek.
"Oh no! If I'm using my title and middle name, you are using your FULL name." Greg and Sigyn looked at each other with equal confusion. Mycroft just chucked from his seat.
"Come on Sig, we're going to play a game together. MYCROFT HOLMES! Stop pretending you can't hear me! Put your brief case down! I called A already and made sure your schedule is clear." Mycroft was trying to escape while Greg was talking to Sigyn. He failed.
Rosie was sitting in the inner tube when Sigyn caught sight of something under the water. She quickly looked to the shore and noticed John was missing.
"I'm going to go change my clothes." She went to her room and found a nice summer dress. It was a spaghetti strapped, off-white and had sun flowers on it. She put her hair in a ponytail and headed down the stairs. The table was set, food was still warm, and the wine was chilling. She noticed a second bottle in the ice bucket. It was juice. A bottle of grape juice. Greg must have brought it out when she was upstairs. Everything looked elegant. The only thing missing was her father and Greg. She heard a car pull up and a door close. Her father walked through the door seconds later. He placed his umbrella under the coat rack and his jacket over it. He turned and smiled when he saw her standing next to the table.
"Nothing interesting." Sigyn started getting the food while Mycroft put his things away in his office. Greg emerged from the basement.
Just beyond the doors was a cemetery. There was green grass everywhere, flower bunches at every inch, benches in every corner, and lushes trees. It could have been mistaken for a park if weren't for the tomb stones. In the far corner, under a tall tree was a black tomb stone with gold writing on it and a massive array of flowers at the base. Sherlock mournfully walked over to it. Looking at the stone, he kind of felt like Ebenezer Scrooge. It read: Sherlock Holmes. An empty feeling started to weld up inside of him.
He walked back around the table and kissed his fiancé on the cheek. Greg opened his eyes a little and smiled. Mycroft whispered,
"Criminal justice?" He looked at Greg for help. Greg placed his hand on her father's arm and gave him the most gentlest of looks.
A light piano music started playing to signal for people to find their seats. It didn't take long since most of the guests were in the wedding party. Sherlock's parents sat on the right and John's on the left. John's sister even made the journey. Greg walked around a corner and straightened his jacket. He had on a black suit, red shirt, black tie and purple pocket hanky. He winked at Sigyn and walked down the isle.
It was a hot day in England. Sigyn was in her room sketching. She had her balcony door open and was sitting in a chair next to it. She would get the occasional breeze. Her long auburn hair was in a high tight bun. She had on a pair of denim shorts and a thin top. She was sketching the scenery just outside. She'd always loved to draw. She had ribbons from grade school. Her father always said 'there is no future in finger painting'.
“Sherlock?” When his mate did not respond, John moved to take Sherlock’s hand, gripping it tightly. “Sherlock, talk to me.” Still, Sherlock stayed silent; all that came from him was the quickening of breath and a knitted brow. John started calling his name as he reached to hold his face, turning the younger man’s head towards his own. Despite his unfocused expression, the fear and anxiety building up behind Sherlock’s eyes was apparent. John kept calling to him, Sherlock’s gaze not focusing. “Sherlock, what’s your brother’s name?”
Despite Lestrade refusing to involve him in other cases – saying he needed rest, physically and mentally – there was one message from the detective inspector that had been timestamped that afternoon. It merely told him not to come back too quickly, and to use his time wisely as he healed. It received an eyeroll and Sherlock found himself deleting the message. Between Lestrade, John and even Mycroft, being treated like a victim had grated on his final nerves.
The comment had the sergeant and detective inspector turn their focus to the nurse, whose eyes were focused on John as he recovered. “He’s mental,” the man said, eyes narrowed as his hand was still on his neck. “I was giving the patient his medications.”
“But it’s not,” Sherlock said, the disapproving look of his brother meeting his eyes. Sherlock quivered, his forehead creasing as his eyebrows rose. “Mycroft, none of this is a fault of my own.”
He could not help but smile, holding back a chuckle as he wondered if even Sherlock realized what he was doing. By trying to avoid talking to Lestrade, he had eaten over half of the meal he had spent the better half of an hour complaining about. It was the most he had eaten since he had come around, much to the dismay of not just John, but the nurses who had been assigned to his room. They were threatening to feed him through an IV if he kept refusing his meals. If being annoyed was what had him eating, John had half-a-mind to call Lestrade back in; but it was forgone when Sherlock finally put the fork down and pushed away what little was left.
The ride was short, dropping him off on the second floor. As he made his way down the hall, he passed by a nurse’s station.
“You agreed that we would bring him home,” John’s voice was low, every muscle tense as he refrained from what he had wanted.
He twisted all five fingers, trying to push his hand inside, each time garnering a painful grunt from the young detective. After a few attempts, his knuckles finally passed Sherlock’s ring, and Sherlock released an unwilling shout of pain. His muscle contacted around the foreign object, which was met with a further intrusion as the American pushed in until his wrist met the base of Sherlock’s anus.
“Nothing that night was your fault, Sherlock, and I never should have allowed you to believe anything otherwise.” Taking in a breath at the mirage of emotions between them both, he brought his hand back. “You were young and I took advantage of your vulnerability. The accountability was mine – it always has been.”
All I've done is read. And my reading material consists of serial killers' methodology, psychology and pathology. So reading that stuff, it's hard to not allow it affect my writing. While it does for my "Criminal Minds" fic (which is actually a good thing), it's not for this.
An unwanted yell escaped his throat as he retracted them close to his body, a shard sticking itself into his left palm. To make up for the sudden shift, his right foot tried to gain traction, only to be met with more glass. He rolled onto his back, his right hand shaking as he went to pull the shard from his left. Though not being able to see, he could feel the trail of blood pour from his hand and down his wrist.
Sometimes, I really wish I was English so I could write the mannerisms more naturally. But eh, what do you expect?
“We’ve surveyed the locations,” came the voice of Mycroft Holmes from the receiving end. Hearing the familiar voice had John release a breath in a mixture of relief and frustration. “We’ve searched all but one possibility – a building near Southbank Centre.” John glanced to his list and out the window, the location being the very one he was pulling up to. “Doctor Watson, I require your medical expertise, given that Sherlock will undoubtedly require immediate medical attention upon recovery.”
John followed their exit, shifting to Donovan, whose expression was a blend of anger and annoyance. She turned her attention to the two nurses still in the room and the onlookers.
If Sherlock were there, he would have definitely suggested the entire area be scoured and the local buildings be searched. Yet, as he recalled the scene, he knew that had not been brought to the investigators and detectives’ attention; though it did have him question why Mycroft Holmes had not advised and required the local zone be combed. Then again, while Mycroft claimed to be more intelligent than his younger brother, in certain areas, it was clear that his little brother claimed domain.
of these videos I’ve sent. Holy shit, it’s still coming out. Ugh, that’s gross.” He inserted two of his fingers and pulled, stretching Sherlock and gaining a muffled shout as the a bit more trickled out. “Then again, maybe Mycroft’s getting off on all this. Fucking faggot.”
Before the detective inspector could get a word out edgewise, John turned and began walking away. He exhaled, turning just as Donovan exited the pub, a memory drive in her hand.
John managed to break away from one of the guards, looking to Lestrade, who he just registered was in the room. “He was there that night – talking on the phone. He was there. He was the one who drugged, Sherlock.” Lestrade’s eyes adverted to the nurse, while Donovan’s stayed on John, brow furrowing as if judging the validity of the accusation. “He was trying to give Sherlock Rocephin.”
At one point, John was there, shaking his head in disappointment. For reasons Sherlock knew naught, that had pained him much more than the brother he would never admit he looked to.
He caught his reflection; the cuts and bruises in the mid-stages of healing, the jagged mark on his neck that was still visible under the purple and brown bruise wrapping around his neck, the black that encompassed the corner of his eyelid.
John manages to find the hideout of the Cielo Diablos members who have Sherlock in their hold, causing his Army training to manifest.
At the information, John suddenly turned back around and walked up to him, staring up at the taller man with an oddly composed rage. “Then what do you think is better, hm? Sherlock dies honestly believing his brother doesn’t give a damn about him? Or dies knowing that you tried anything and everything in your power to bring him home? Now you tell me: what would you rather have him think?”
John now sat in Sherlock’s room, his laptop open as he found himself following the reports of the Cielo Diablos’ takedown through various news sources. A cold cup of instant coffee sat on the bedside table, which he still found himself taking occasional sips from. With Lestrade handling the main investigation and Mycroft dealing with the political spectrum, John was the only one left to watch after Sherlock, waiting for him to come-to. After the situation that morning, John had not left his mate’s side. It was Donovan who had sent an officer to the flat to get John’s computer, along with a change of a clothes and toiletries. From the woman who had always made her disdain towards Sherlock more than apparent, she had made certain John would not have to leave him until the young genius was conscious.
“You’re not alone.” John held his hand out to him. Sherlock looked down at the open palm in uncertainty. His eyes darted up, but before he could comment, John continued, “I’m here with you, Sherlock. I’ll always be here.” With the reassuring gaze of his best mate, even despite his own internal conflict, Sherlock found himself reaching out his own hand.
“A bit better.” He took his phone back out and aimed it at the detective once more. “Come on, look up,” he said, snapping his fingers. Once Sherlock looked at him, the flash went off. Again, the man began texting. “Let’s call this a little portfolio of your progress. Because if Mycroft really couldn’t care, they’re going to need some way to identify the body.” He put his phone into his pocket, a disturbingly innocent smile on his face. “Tell me, Sherlock. How are you with being on film?”
“Rather you didn’t,” came the response, his eyes quickly darting down to a bulge in the man’s jeans.
“Could you go ahead and get her statement?” Lestrade asked the female sergeant, though it was more of a directive.
"Come with me, help..." He turned to look at her and she was gone. Was it all in his mind? Was she really there? SHHHhEERrwERRE. He patted to center of the consul,
"WHY DID I FALL FOR SUCH A MORON?!" John Watson came crashing through the front door like a hurricane. He paced back and forth in the living room. The noise caused Mycroft to emerge from his office and Greg from the kitchen. Everyone just stood motionless as John paced. He mumbled something about cheekbones and intelligence.
"So Sigyn, I've never heard of that name before. Where does it come from?" She told him the origins of her name and how she got teased at school for it. He then asked about what her childhood was like and how school was. She regaled him with her childhood whoos. How she had many different nannies, a new school every year, no friends, and how she missed out on a lot of things. She fell silent about how school was now. She ate her food and hoped he wouldn't ask again. They both finished their salad. Greg placed two slices of pizza on her plate and two on his. He sat there smiling at her.
"He's a complete idiot." Sigyn rolled her eyes and went back to the kitchen. She got a serving bowl out and put the freshly drained pasta in it followed by the sauce from stove. She gave them a good mix together. She pulled the bread from the oven and salad from the fridge. She took the pasta bowl to the dinner table. John was saying something about coat collars and being smug. Sigyn went back to the kitchen and got the salad and some dressings. In the few seconds it took her to grab the bowl, John was now complaining about the mess his flat was in. Sigyn placed the bowl on the table and grabbed the bread from the kitchen. When she walked back to the dinner table, John was listening the things he loved about Sherlock. Sigyn sat down and looked at her father.
"My favorite suit." He father was at a loss of words. She never wore something like a two piece in front of him before. She thought she looked good in it and didn't care what her father thought.
He was about to respond when the staff came in with a tray in hand. They crossed the room and set the tray on the rollaway table that sat at the foot of the bed. Pushing the table over the bed and to the patient’s lap, they lifted the lid. Instead of the sausage and eggs that permeated through the halls, the tray held a steamed banana, yogurt and two soft cooked eggs. Even John gave a look of sympathy as Sherlock stared down at the bland meal. The doctor thanked the staff as they left the room, the wheels of the trolley squeaking to the next room.
“I’ll kill them,” he said, tone dark and expression falling. “Do you understand that?” When he turned to look at the older man, he saw nothing but remorse. “If you put me in a room with that fucking yank, I’ll kill him.”
A scoff left the American’s throat. “Please. With your needle-dick, I’m sure that feeling’s frequent.”
The silence from the other men in the room only seemed to cause his reaction to worsen, and as he was still trying to contain his emotional imbalance, all his brain could focus on was the eyes and camera on him, watching him falter – watching and recording the one reaction he thought himself immune to so long ago.
“If that’s the case, then show me. Show me what I’m missing out on,” Sherlock said the last bit with such contrivance, it took all of Mycroft’s self-control to refrain from knocking sense into him. “Or are you just going to mope about because you couldn’t screw something with a hole? Not that I blame you,” he commented with an air of arrogance. “With your lesser knowledge and capacity, it was only expected that your more primitive desires would draw you back from—”
Meanwhile, Sherlock was filing away the entire conversation, in the off-chance he would see the light of day again. As his brain ran over the mobile discussion, it latched onto the phone call. The group had made it abundantly clear that they the only reason they had him at all was to gain leverage against Mycroft; though unlike his brother, Sherlock knew there would be no barter. Even still, his attention hung on the words exchanged, giving his mind something to latch onto.
Mycroft nodded, his eyes trailing to the front of the bricked structure. Without glancing to Lestrade, he responded, “Allow me to enter through the front as your men take the rear.” The suggestion had Lestrade furrow his brows. “The back door, most likely, leads to the sub-level. Given the time, I highly doubt they have anyone of worth watching my brother, what with the situation at hand.” He finally turned to face Lestrade, whose expression had gone from confusion to understanding.
“Better than what you serve.” Sherlock scoffed. “You’re coming, then,” he phrased with certainty, instead of a question.
A small noise escaped from Sherlock’s throat, one which could have been mistaken as a whine. It was followed by, “…stop….”
Outside the door to the flat, his hand hovered over the doorknob. With a deep breath, he pushed the door open.
The camera was focused on Sherlock, apparently beaten, who was chained to a chair on the floor. One man stood next to him, his stature tall and lean, wearing a white t-shirt and black cargo pants. His face was covered with a black half mask, only exposing the bridge of his nose and up. The camera appeared to shift, as someone behind it angled it to where they wanted, with Sherlock in the direct centre.
Dreln pursed his lips together, eyes darting off to the side in silent contemplation. “What to do, what to do?” He focused his attention back on Mycroft, glistening in sadistic amusement. “I really liked Sherlock, though. Soft mouth and tight ass? What more could you ask for?” Laughing at Mycroft’s hands gripping the hand of his umbrella with such ferocity that his knuckles had grown white, he pushed off from the desk and walked to stand in front of him, staring up at him, mocking him. “Is that why you want him back? So you can have fun with him, too? I can give you all the details – how good his mouth felt around my cock, how his ass tightened around my fist—”
Sherlock had to come to terms with his situation, no matter the pain it would cause. It was not something John was looking forward to, but until he did, the younger man would have nothing to look forward to but anxiety, panic and the inevitable depression. Given his inner workings, the latter was what terrified John the most. If Sherlock’s mind were to fall into the part that was always behind the curtain, pulling him back would prove to be either difficult or impossible. He wanted to help him avoid that darkness as much as possible, but, at the same time, he could not stand idly by and allow his mate to self-destruct.
Clearly hesitant, Lestrade grabbed the mouse and hovered over the thumbnail. As though nervous of what he would see, a verbal acknowledgement from John gave him the final push to click.
“I may have underestimated the extent of the damage,” Sherlock muttered as he was assisted to his feet. He stumbled against John as he reached for the pole, which had hit the adjacent wall. As John wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist and the other set against his chest to stabilize him, he found himself taking on most of the younger man’s weight, despite Sherlock making it seem like he was not as dependent as he was.
Using his elbows and forearms, he turned back to his stomach, facing the sound as he attempted to move back down, ignoring the glass that dug into his bare feet and forearms.
For once, the man had no reply, instead giving a mocked sympathetic expression. “You know, I figured Mycroft had some fucked up relationships, but that? That’s just sad.”
Early in the evening, John had managed to sneak out without alerting his mate after Sherlock had fallen asleep on the couch. Though that may have been due to John slipping Sherlock’s medications into his tea an hour prior. He was somewhat surprised the genius had not realised his tea had been spiked. Or he did and chose not to say anything.
On the desk was the deceased’s severed head, blood pooling on the desk and dripping over the edge to the floor. In one chair sat the severed limbs, the torso in the other, each dripping red. Slowly and hesitantly, he inched towards the head, his jaw tight and eyes focused. When he passed the chair harbouring the limbs, the severed arm reached out for his leg, causing him to jump and take his attention from the desk. He glanced back to it, only to see it was gone.
"Nice setting" he placed the fish in the middle of the table. He brought the potatoes and salad next. Sigyn walked to the sink and washed her hands as Greg grabbed a bottle of wine from the basement. She filled a pitcher with ice and water. She then filled the wine bucket with ice.
She woke before her alarm went off. It was 4:25 in the morning. Still 45 minutes till her alarm. She laid in bed for a few minutes before she decided to get up. She changed into some lose clothes and went down to the kitchen. She was looking for a breakfast bar when she heard something behind her. She saw Greg running down the stairs and come to a quick stop. He looked about as surprised as she felt.
"I forget, thank you Mattie. I have nice ride" she patted the horse and left the stall. Sigyn gave Mattie some grains and met Rosie outside the stall.
"Why the interest in criminal justice Sigyn?" Maybe Greg will be a nice addition to her and her father's crazy family dynamic.
Sigyn picked up her flowers and took a deep calming breath. She walked down the isle and stood in her spot. She was more than a little pleased that she didn't trip. Rosie made her way next. She emptied her basket of flower petals and sat next to Mrs. Hudson.
Greg was on the couch but his head was laying on the back cushion. He was obviously asleep. Mycroft put his umbrella and jacket on the coat rack. He took his briefcase to his office. He rounded the couch and saw the whole picture. Sigyn was in her pajamas and bathrobe. She was fast asleep on Greg's shoulder. Greg had his arm on the back of the couch and was asleep as well.
she returned to her book, always keeping and eye on the man. More then two hours passed, when she finally heard a car pull up. Both her and the man look to the door and wait. Her father entered through the door and stopped mid stride. His eyes looked from her to the man and back.
"It's fine father. Have a good day." She gave him a tight smile and left for her room. Once she reached her room, she grabbed a book off her shelf and set herself up on her balcony.
"Sig, it's time to go to bed. Come on." Sigyn didn't bother waking up. She only groaned. Greg picked her up bridal style. She wrapped her hands around his neck.
"Fine." Greg and Sigyn cleared the coffee table of any and all evidence of Cluedo. Greg brought the card game to the table as Sigyn refilled everyone's drinks. Sigyn was drinking water along with Greg. Mycroft switch to wine after the second round.
Sigyn stood just to the right of the priest as Rosie made her way down the makeshift isle. She smiled at Sigyn as she sat next to Mrs. Hudson. Everyone turned and watched the two grooms walk up to the front, hand in hand. They made it to the front and turned to look at each other.
"Oh good. I need help!" He held out his wrists. Sigyn placed her flowers down to helped her frantic uncle. She buttoned his cuffs and started working on his tie.
"He asked for my approval and help picking out the ring. The engraved hearts were his idea." Mycroft fell to his knees and hugged his daughter and new fiancé. That was the first true hug Sigyn had received from her father.
With his adrenaline coursing through him, his senses went into overdrive, a feeling he had not experienced since the time he met Sherlock and had to save him from his own arrogance. It was a wave of clarity.
The younger man, whose eyes were closed, shook his head. “I’ve been drugged,” he said, his voice sounding distant,
The time of working with Scotland Yard had come to an end for him, having been dismissed several times before. Though he knew Lestrade wanted nothing more than to find the young genius, his position would not allow him to handle the situation as he wished, and giving the detective inspector an insight into his own forethought would most likely put Sherlock in an even more detrimental position. With the group monitoring Mycroft, it was only understandable that they most likely had Scotland Yard under surveillance, as well. If they even had an inkling that officials were about to close in, they would most likely cut off any loose ends and jump ship.
Even with his strong stomach, the sound grated on Sherlock’s ears, filling him with a wave of nausea. He tried his best to tune it out, but when he was able to regress to his mind, he found himself back under his brother’s disapproving gaze. Though it would have turned the insides of others, the sounds and smell of the cockney-accented man’s body being cut apart was one he preferred at the moment, even if he knew the same fate awaited him.
Seeing the proud Sherlock Holmes so vulnerable, every ill-gotten thought coursed through him. They had been made aware of the abduction minutes after it had occurred, yet they still could not track Sherlock or the men who took him until the young man was put through immense physical and psychological trauma. Lestrade found himself praying Sherlock’s genius shielded him from any long-term psychological damage, though he had a sinking feeling it would only make it worse.
She set the table like she was taught. Plate in the middle, knife and spoon on the right with the knife blade facing the plate, dinner fork and salad fork on the left on top of the napkin, glasses above and slightly to the left of the knife. She set the final setting and smiled to herself. Greg carried the finished fish, covered in foil, to the table.
"Sounds to me like you have a 24 hour flu." Sigyn groaned and wrapped her bathrobe tight around her. Greg smiled and walked into the kitchen. He took the lid off the pot and gave it a stir. It smelled good. He tested the noodles and vegetables. He grabbed two soup bowls and soup spoons. He ladled a good serving in each bowl. He pored some orange juice in a glass and milk in another. He put both bowls, glasses, spoons and two slices of bread on a serving tray. He walked into the living room and found Sigyn laying on the couch coughing.
Sigyn was brushing her horse, Mattie when a little voice distracted her. She turned just in time to see Rosie running though the barn. Rosie jumped into Sigyn's arms and wrapped her arms around Sigyn's neck.
Greg took a shower and got dressed. He called his office to let them know he would not be coming in. He entered the kitchen and started the kettle. He grabbed two mugs and placed a tea bag in each. He waited for the kettle to boil, once it did he pored the water into the mugs. He left one on the counter and took the other to Sigyn. He placed the mug on her nightstand.
Sigyn told Greg that everything was a good to go. Sigyn grabbed the potatoes and asparagus while Greg handled the rolls and wine. It was obvious that Greg was nervous and unless you really knew Mycroft, you wouldn't be able to tell he was nervous as well. The plates have been served, the wine has been poured and they all started eating. Everyone was quiet. No eye contact was being made either. Sigyn decided it was her job to get those men taking.
"I tried. He was on such a destructive path, he went looking for danger." A half smile played at the Doctor's lips, "He even tried to end World War One single handed. Not to mention the Daleks have a new definition for fear." He buried his face in her wild curls. "What should I do? What would you do?" His voice was muffled, and his breath tickled her neck. She gave a small child like laugh. As she stroked his back, she thought. I would do anything for him, to save him, for Amy and Rory, to see them again. There you have it, he has to try and help. She placed a soft kiss on his neck, causing him to raise up and look at her.
"John, I always viewed myself as Asexual. I lived my life that way for so long I was caught off guard when I fell for an army doctor with a psychosomatic limp. You restored my faith in humanity. You showed me it wasn't a defect to care for another person. People told you to keep your distance, that only made you draw closer. I know that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. John, I am a ridiculous man redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your love. I've only love a hand full of people, none as much as you. John, I promise to have your name on my lips as I'm dying. I will take you on all my life threatening adventures, I promise to try and be the man you more than deserve. I love you John and with this ring," Sigyn untied the ring and handed it to Sherlock, "I am yours, forever." Sherlock slipped the ring onto John's finger with smug grin.
"Sherlock, you gotta hide." The Doctor could barely be seen behind a tree. Why was he hiding? Sherlock turned just in time to see a puffy eyed Mrs. Hudson get out of a taxi and face the opposite side. Knowing she'd never come alone he was by the Doctor's side quicker then it took for her to turn around. For an unexpected reason, he was surprised when John showed up beside her. They walked in silence to the tomb stone. Once they reached it Mrs. Hudson was the first to speak,
"Just in time love. Sigyn and I made a nice dinner." He finished descending the stairs and kissed her father. Her father blushed a little and cleared his throat.
"No I sketch. Don't move." She started sketching Greg. She started with his head and face. She moved onto his chest. Making sure to get the details of his band tee.
"Yes Greg." Sigyn turned and walked back into the house. Greg finished with the horses he went back to the house. When he entered he saw Sigyn sitting in the living room.
"I do not create originals. I copy what I see in the world around me. Don't move!" She started on his shorts. Pockets still gave her a hard time. She finally got frustrated and moved onto his legs. She let Greg's body end there. She sketched the chair and drapes behind him before she finally put her pencil down.
"Cool. Well I'll see you back at the house then." He started off running. She didn't know what it was about him, but he started to grow on her. She motioned for Mattie to move and they caught up with him in no time.
"Come on love. Let's get you to bed." Her only response was a moan into his shoulder. He carefully and slowly walked up the stairs. He took each step with care. He made it to her room. Luckily, she forgot to close the door completely. It was open a crack. He pushed it open with his foot. He gently placed Sigyn on her bed. He removed her arms from around his neck. He used care to lay her head on her pillow. Once she felt her pillow she curled her arms around it. He covered her with a blanket. He moved a piece of hair from her face.
"No, he's still asleep. You ride your horse this early?" He moves from his spot at the bottom of the stairs to get a bottle of water from the fridge.
"Hey Sig, nice sketch." She looked up to find Greg was leaning over her. He had a huge smile on his face that fell slightly when she didn't answer him.
Sigyn was sitting on the floor with her head resting against the wall. Her long auburn hair was in a very lose ponytail. The hair along her temples stuck to her head. She slowly raised her head only to put it back down.
"You too." He grabbed the bags and left the store. He loaded the juices into the tailpack. The chicken, noodles, and stock got loaded into the seat storage. The small things got put in his backpack. He started it up, mounted it and started off towards home. He got home and unloaded the groceries. He placed the juice in the fridge. He grabbed a stock pot and put it on the stove. He added the chicken stock and turned on the heat to medium. He separated the chicken from the bone, fat and skin. By the time he finished a light boil started on the stock. He added the chicken, frozen vegetables and some water. He waited for it to boil again before he added the noodles and some spices. He covered the pot and tuned down the heat. Greg was in the process of cleaning the counters when he saw his untouched mug of tea. He put the mug in the sink and placed two slices of bread in the toaster. When they came out he took them up to Sigyn with a fresh cup of tea and the medicine he got.
"I know he will. The only thing is, I want to take a gap year and when I go to university I do not want to study international affairs like my father."
"Oh! We have some beautiful rings. I'm sure we can find something suitable for her." She started pulling out rings with different size diamond in them.
"Only Mattie? You didn't come to see me?" Sigyn stuck out her lip and made an overly exaggerated sad face.
"I never that good." Sigyn walks Mattie around the meadow a few times before taking Rosie down. As soon as Rosie's feet hit the ground she hugs Mattie and kisses her leg.
"Hey, calm down. If you act like this is a different dinner than any other one, father will get suspicious."
She was surprised by the question. She'd never had pizza before. Even at school, it was a strict meal plan.
Sigyn was alone in the house watching a tv show that Greg recommended. It was based around a medical physician and a friend who live in a wooden box that travels to different times and planets. She couldn't figure out why she found it enjoyable to watch a man, who has become a different man once already, run around in a suit and Converse. She was about to start a new episode when her phone dinged
"Come on Sigyn. Your uncles are already here." Greg made another motion for her to follow. She decided to bring her bag. She followed her father and Greg down to the lake. She watched as Greg held her father's hand and kissed it occasionally. She felt happy. She was happy that her father found someone that made him happy. She noticed a change in him. He acted differently when Greg was around.
Sigyn and Greg were sitting at the kitchen peninsula eating their breakfast. A nice little routine had formed over the last few week. Greg and Sigyn would get up around the same time and each do their morning activity. Greg would finish his swim and Sigyn would finish her ride around the same time. One would wait for the other and Greg would hop on the back of Sigyn's horse. They ate breakfast together. Occasionally Mycroft would join them, but he would usually be gone by the time they got back.
"The way you were so focused on the paper. You were lost in thought. In your own little world. Your father gets like that when he's doing important paper work."
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the coming together of one John Watson and one Sherlock"
A sharp pang shot to his chest at the thought, realizing that those times of normality may have very well come to an end.
His back hit the outside of the building and he placed his hands on his knees, inhaling while his head pulsed. Her hand was on his shoulder to help stabilize him.
