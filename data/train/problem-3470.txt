"Whenever you're ready," Dean says lovingly. He doesn't know how else to go about this situation. He can tell there's something swirling in Cas' mind that wasn't there the night before.
After the worst breakfast of Cas' human experience, he went into his room and stayed there. He felt absolutely awful about what had happened the night before. Dean was obviously disgusted by his actions. Dean hadn't even said anything about what happened which just showed how much Castiel screwed up. At least Cas enjoyed the feeling the alcohol induced dream caused him. He spent most of the day re-watching the episodes of Star Trek he didn't pay much attention to, and when he wasn't watching television, he was crying or trying not to. Dean had made it clear that males don't cry. Just another reason why Dean Winchester would never love him.
shouldn't care were Cas stands. And since when has he cared about how Cas would feel if he left for a job anyways?
A deal's a deal, Angel. Let's get back to the move. It's almost over." Dean can tell that Cas is upset. After a while of looking over and seeing no change, Dean couldn't take it. He hates seeing Cas so unhappy, so he did what he knows will help.
"Well we don't have a solid reason for that, but that's not how you eat ice cream Cas." Dean's annoying little brother is about to ruin this show for him, but he's
"Dean, what shall we practice  when we get home? I w-was wondering if w-you could, um... continue to teach me h-how to be human. IF that's ok with you, I mean."
Cas continues jerking himself quick to the speed of his mouth bobbing on the hard shaft that's leaking precum into his mouth, some dribbling past his lips to trail down his cheeks. Luckily, the water washed it away as soon as it appeared. Neither of the boys was going to last long, Dean shaking slightly against the shower tiles and Cas' mouth practically going slack. With a few more quick thrusts into his boyfriend's mouth, just shy of gagging him, he was spilling down Castiel's throat. The sounds coming from Dean along with the taste of him sent Cas over the edge as well.
"No, no Cas, trust me. You will thank me soon! If it's too much, snap your fingers, and I will stop." Castiel nods to show Dean he is ok with this and he understands. Dean pauses and strokes through his hair, giving his lover time to back out if he wants to. When he's satisfied with the wait, he continues his teasing. Castiel hears Dean sit back and remove his closing, he gets upset knowing he doesn't get to see, so he turns his head to the side to show his protest. He hears Dean laugh before trying to move his head back.
" Cas said with a sarcastic tone as he hops up to grab them some water, both boys smiling from their playful banter. He’s glad they can have conversations comfortably like that. Back and forth without either of them getting hurt. It’s always been nice, really nice, a pleasant display of their connection. Cas can imagine himself talking like that with Dean for the rest of their lives, preferably with kissing afterward. But that's another chapter to this fantasy. When Cas reaches the kitchen, he found Mary dancing around with headphones in getting a glass of milk to plop in the microwave. When she finally notices him standing there she takes out one of her headphones.
"I know Dean, I know." Dean sits up facing Cas with a look of determination and adoration. He kisses Cas' cheek softly.
Before Dean knew what he was doing, he ran in there and was talking faster than his brain could process. After a few seconds he heard himself saying something he had never said out loud.
"Hey, don't laugh at me!" Which, of course, only made them laugh harder, for the brothers say it in perfect unison. They fight to keep a straight face but end up laughing along with the two others. It's the best way to end a day! They play for a couple more rounds until Cas won 10 rounds to eight( Mary was in second with eight, Sam next with seven, and Dean tied with Sam). They joke around and play around while cleaning up.
"Mary and Sam shouldn't be home for a little while. We should Make-out again before they come back." Cas can admit to being a little desperate.
It all started when Cas first became human. Well, after he started living in the bunker. To be honest Dean didn't really know when this all started. The important thing is that this
"Or I'll sleep on the couch to be closer to the kitchen for all the midnight snacks I'll need to survive." Dean doesn't even properly reply, just pouts and rolls over as though he could actually go back to sleep. "Or I won't you delicate princess. I'll just not give you a blowjob in the shower with everyone else home." Cas turns to walk out the door smugly and Dean more than gladly follows right on his heels. Once he caught up to Cas he threw his arm around his lover.
He finally reaches the large, needy member. He takes a moment to just look at it. The way it twitches with anticipation the more he waits, the precum beading at the tip. When he hears muffled noises coming from Castiel, he finally decides to stop his teasing. He licks the slit first, taking away any drop of precum he could. He almost enjoys the bitter, salty taste of it, it's the sort of thing you crave and don't quite know why. He then puts his lips delicately around just the head, licking in a circle and pressing just right into the slit after every circle.
One moment they are out the door and the next they are pulling up to a very unfamiliar house. Cas is surprised at how distant this house feels, even though he lived here for almost six consecutive years. It's a large, cream colored house, four stories not including the basement. It has a whole lot of "look at me" space that Cas finds no need for. He's almost glad he never had to stay here that often.
about the former angel. He, of course, decided it best to ignore all these things in his mind. That was, until they went to celebrate their hunt.
"Still, Cas didn't spend the night here for two whole days! I was worrying all night every night! I'm just used to him being here, not in that big house all alone and unguarded."
"I get that, I really do. But Hun, we won't always know everything. Not even what we feel like we should know. Worry is a part of life, as is pain. We unfortunately just have to live with that. We will all be fine, and if not, we will live with a few scrapes and bruises physically, mentally, or both. We will all survive, and that's all that really matters." Dean nods again not trusting his voice anymore, Mary always knew just what to say. Dean cleared his throat.
Dean thought about the first time his mom and father got into a fight loud enough for him to hear. They were arguing about Mary's cousin who had come out as a lesbian. She wanted to attend her wedding in the spring that year, but John wouldn't have it. Dean remembers hearing him ask if her blood spread this to his children. Dean was nine. He stops thinking about it. He has a family here that loves and accepts him no matter what. John isn't there. John may never show up, and even if he does? Dean isn't a little boy anymore. He's old enough to fend for himself and fight back if he must. He isn't a little seven-year-old boy looking up at his father with fear anymore.
Oh how it hurt him to see the repentance and self-admonishment in Cas’s blue eyes as he said, “Dean, I’m so sorry.”
Dean feels his face doing something embarrassing, shrugs his shoulders, and shakes his head. He catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and he looks like a fool. All soft-eyed and red like this is some kind of holiday commercial where the guy takes his boyfriend home and his mom’s there passing out chocolate or--
"Thank you, Dean," Cas said, and he was so much closer now. Dean swallowed, throat clicking as Cas reached for him, and tenderly touched his cheek, cupped his jaw in his warm palm. He wiped his tears away like they were beautiful, and dear God if Dean didn't tremble.
Just standing there with a mug of coffee in one hand and a hammer in the other. With the sun backlighting him like a freaking movie. It was too early to look at Cas like this.
Dean, on his knees in front of the only being he’d ever had any faith in. Maybe it was sick, maybe it was wrong, maybe he was just insane. Maybe a small part of him thought he deserved the pain, the blood. Because that’s what he was, wasn’t it? Daddy’s blunt little instrument. All he knew was pain.
They lay there, panting in the dark. Cas shifts like he’s going to leave, and Dean’s arms tighten around him, pull him down. He presses shaky, helpless kisses to Cas’s temple, his jaw, the corner of his perfectly debauched mouth. “I want you here,” he begs. “Stay.”
The sound of hammering woke him. Dean sprung to his feet almost immediately, doing his best to ignore the light that snuck between the gap in his curtains.
He’s not gay, but he considers pulling the car over, getting on his knees and begging forgiveness, or begging for something else he’s afraid to name, but seems to be pretty close to the romance covers from earlier. If he could just give Cas what he wanted, he deserved to have what he wanted. And Cas wants him, and maybe Dean can do what he wants. He can, he could--
Leverage, they are each other’s will do anything for--and everyone knows--everyone fucking knows, and he knows. And Cas, Cas has to know. Cas knows everything about him. He thinks of the future, where he was cruel and Cas had given up hope. He doesn’t want that, not his Cas. Not--
Cas was reaching out, and Dean flinched because something deep inside him was convinced that if Cas hurt him again he would never recover, even if he lived. Cas touching him, gently cradling his face and oh--it hurt, tenderness hurt more than fists and blood. Tenderness cut him more deeply than knives and angel blades or hell itself it hurt.
“Dean,” Cas says, and his voice is so gentle as he reaches out. His hand settles on Dean’s shoulder, where it belongs. Dean detonates, clutching Cas’s hand to him in a way that he’d be mortified to witness.
"Where are we going?" Cas’s voice rumbles through him, and Dean feels himself return to inhabiting his body. He looked over at Cas, the real Cas, not the conjured Cas that was currently making the conjured Dean shout his name. It was nobody’s business if the both of them were covered in--
Cas’s love, oh how he held it so close to his heart that he could feel it beating against his ribs. He knew that one day it would escape, and it would kill him. Kill him to lose even a breath of what Cas thought of him.
Dean leaned forward, leaned so close to Cas that all he could smell was honeysuckle. And he leaned closer and closer until all he could taste was Cas’s lips. He had to know, he had to. Cas made a beautiful, broken sort of sound and opened his mouth.
He felt a gentle pressure on his shoulder, and jerked back like he’d been stung, wiping his face. “I’m fine,” he said, and then he signed it, because it was Eileen and he was trying to learn. Cas had always been better at it than him. A memory assaulted him, Cas’s hands curling over his as he taught him to sign his name.
“I love you,” Cas whispers, rolling them over and sucking a mark into Dean’s throat, right over his pulse. “Because I love you, Dean.”
And Cas is raising the angel blade, looking cool and distant--so far from his usual intensity that it hurt to look at him. It hurt to realize how different they were, how distant. Like planets in different orbits, and Cas had probably seen the planets and galaxies and everything up close. And he is looking at Dean with the same eyes that had probably seen sights that mortals couldn’t comprehend.
“I can’t hear your prayers, Dean.” Cas’s teeth scrape down his neck and Dean’s knees buckle beneath him. “You’re going to have to ask me for what you want.”
These are the moments Dean wishes he could bottle. The way the sunlight glints off of Cas's hair as he stands by the sink, red watering can in hand, humming as water fills it.
“Dean is not in any sort of bag,” Cas says with confusion, and Dean wants them all to leave. He wants Cas to himself, he wants--
Maybe it had hurt more than Cas saying goodbye had. To see him come back. To have him close, and not be able to say the things that needed to be said. To act like nothing had ever happened.
Outside of the Bunker, Cas is watering a plant with bare feet. He’s wearing jeans and one of Dean’s t-shirts. His hair is longer, wavy. Soft-looking. Everything about him looks softer, and Dean knows it’s the absence of expected violence. Cas got softer, and Sam got Eileen, and all Dean got was wasted.
“Cas,” he said, gesturing to the chaos as if it were obvious. Sam’s eyebrows practically disappeared into his hairline.
And Cas’s grace was more intimate than anything as it curled through him. It felt like worship, it felt like atonement the way that Cas’s grace lingered and soothed his broken pieces. It felt like being seen. Cas, and Cas’s gentle hands. Gentle. No one had ever been so gentle with him as Cas had. He was used to being ruined. He was used to being treated like something too strong to hurt, too steady to collapse. He couldn’t he wasn’t…
"Please don't leave me," Dean said, before he could stop himself. Shame welled up within him as he watched Cas register his words.
“I’m going to need you to be more specific, Dean.” Cas is toying at his belt buckle, fingers raking back and forth and slipping beneath the fabric to touch skin as Dean nods enthusiastically in consent. Kissing Cas is giving him more of a rush than anything he’s ever experienced or it was until--
Warning lights start flashing in Dean’s mind, fireworks and supernovas--shit Cas practically is a supernova. He probably tastes like stardust or something too holy or--
Morning came and brought the worst headache he’d had in at least a week. The shrill beeping of the alarm he had set to prove he was ‘functional’ seemed to stab him.
And the thing is that Cas means that, he means it, and Dean knows even though he himself can’t believe it. Cas believes it. It’s too raw, it’s like being flayed to hear Cas talk about him like he is what is holy while looking at him like that. He’s looking at him like, like--like he always does, because they are always like this.
He pulled the monstrous wreath from Cas's grip and hung it on the nail he'd affixed to the door. It looked good there, right.
And he pulls away, the bastard. The bastard pulls away just as Dean’s about to burst into fucking flames. Having Cas not touching him is the newest and most heinous form of hell.
Cas turns a particularly delightful shade of cherry red, but there is a flutter, and Dean’s stomach flips because damn if Cas didn’t land them directly on Dean’s bed and now Dean has a lapful of angel with very determined and extremely skilled hands. Cas loves to read, and god he must have done some reading because his hands are on Dean’s skin touching him everywhere, and he whispers Enochian adorations against Dean’s flesh as his fingers slip beneath Dean’s waistband.
Cas letting him move him. Cas watching him from across a darkened motel room. Cas being the only thing he ever believed in enough to pray to.
And maybe Dean is fucking crying too, but if he is it’s only because he’s never been so fucking happy as he is right now. Looking up at the stars with Cas in his arms and a lifetime of dawns ahead of them. A whole and happy lifetime of this.
That was the worst part. Because most of the time when Cas left him, it was because Dean told him to.
"What are you hammering," Dean asked, once the caffeine had entered his bloodstream. "I could have helped. Last time you--"
“I was lost from the moment I saw your soul. It’s such a magnificent soul, Dean. You are the best thing, my favorite thing, about the entirety of the universe.”
Sam looked at him with sad puppy eyes. Geez, that kid needed to stop before Dean fell apart. “Maybe if we…”
If Sam was awake, that meant it was morning. If it was morning, then Dean hadn’t slept. Again. There was a play like that, wasn’t there? Something had ‘banished sleep.’ Fuck, he couldn’t remember.
Dean was used to being looked at. He was used to being catcalled, admired, lusted after. He was used to his smile opening doors, to the cadence of his voice persuading people to do whatever he suggested. Buy him a drink, buy his time, spill secrets, or forget their reasons to say no. He was always called ‘pretty’ but never considered particularly clever or good. He thought of himself as something unworthy of saving. What was he really? A pretty fucked up hunter with bum knees, no future, and nothing to show for his life but a long list of people he’d let down.
Dean makes a sound. A whimper, a whine--the keening of prey when their number is up and there’s no hope left anymore. There’s no hope, he’s fucked it up, Cas is going to leave and--
“Cas, angel of thursday, Castiel of the trenchcoat? Cas, please. Please, please, please. I’m not one for begging, but I’m begging for you now. Come back and love me, please. I don’t mind, Cas--” and Dean felt the tears run like lava down his face, like hellfire and salt and all the things that Cas wanted him to escape.
Dean wanted to run away, wanted to scream, to cry some more. To rage and slay and die. I never got to say.
Dean Winchester kept his nightmares to himself. He kept his nightmares to himself even when there were others in the room.
Maybe Dean had wrecked that Cas, but he wouldn't wreck his Cas. He wouldn't watch him sink sadly into silence with what he thought to be his final words never acknowledged.
“I will never hurt you like that again,” Cas promises, and Dean feels his breath tickle his hairline and shivers. He fucking shivers because Cas is his weakness. Cas is his fucking weakness, and the closer they get the harder it is. It is so much harder to keep pretending that he doesn’t have the unhinged desire to strip naked just to be closer, to feel Cas’s touch on his skin somewhere besides his dreams.
So Sam and Eileen had moved first. Then, it only seemed natural for Dean to bring Cas with him when he moved out of the Bunker. His best friend. Who might be in love with him. This farmhouse and its two acres belonged to them. All of it, which meant they had to share aesthetic design choices. Which meant Dean had to be supportive of Cas's choice to paint the front door bright yellow. It meant that he had to help Cas now, help him with the stupid wreath with its lights and swirly words.
Sam’s voice floated through his head: Think about why it means so much to you, Dean. Dean would rather not. Thinking about stuff like that made him consider things like guys who play instruments. Which made him consider Dr. Sexy, which made him think of Cas in a lab coat looking better than Dr. Sexy which--
Charlie would know, what had she told him once--that he had internalized homophobia or something? The idea of Cas’s dick in his mouth probably had something to do with why he can’t remember the words, the terms. There’s a term for--
Sam was in the kitchen drinking something thick, gelatinous, and green. Eileen sat across from him, signing something Dean was too hungover to try to interpret.
"I'm fixing it." Cas didn't look at him before he walked out to the kitchen, heading towards the back yard. Dean sighed, running his fingers through his hair before deciding to sit down on the couch. Sam was - in fact he wasn't sure where Sam was, until he heard his voice in the yard too. He should have gone to join them and help out, but he didn't. It felt weird to be sitting around, wrong to let someone else fix his problem for him, but the line of Cas' shoulders when he'd left the room said he didn't need his help and more to the point, didn't want it. Which figured. Cas wasn't going to say it, but he was avoiding him and Dean wasn't such an idiot he couldn't figure out what that meant.
"Mmmhmmm, " Dean's gaze still follows the water droplets, dripping down onto the hardwood floor. Off Cas's arm, and suddenly Dean is fisting his hands so they don't do something stupid like reach out.
Dean nervously rubbed at the back of his neck, "I mean, I don't...I'm not good with... I want you to stay with me, and I. I want to build you flower boxes and make you burgers. I want to drive you to gardening stores and complain about you not knowing Zeppelin and--shit, I'm crying--" he tried to wipe away his tears, but his hands were still full of wreath. "Hang on."
“Please,” he says. “Please,” and he leans forward into Cas, feels the scratch of the tie against his cheek. Cas’s arms encircle him, and the air rustles, and Dean feels warm all over. Feels fucking salvation wrapped in an angel’s arms, an angel’s wings.
“It’s very close to yours,” Sam said finally. “Won’t you miss the privacy. We chose rooms in opposite halls to give each other privacy, Dean.”
"It says 'Welcome to Our Honeycomb,'" Dean said faintly, unsure if it was an argument or observation.
This was different. This was Cas perched on the edge of Dean’s bed like it was going to swallow him up. This was Dean rifling through his dresser for a t-shirt and some sweatpants with a drawstring because Cas should be comfortable, especially after wearing business casual attire for years.
Cas ducked his head, suddenly looking very small. “I am useless to you without my grace. I am, a baby in a trench coat, as you said--”
But Cas has had enough of words, and his palms are hot on Dean's bare chest, and Dean is so incredibly glad that they have no neighbors.
“Is this,” Cas gestures vaguely at the space between them. “Is this...I believe the expression is an ‘apology tour’ though I’m not sure that’s the proper reference.”
The bunker was home. It belonged to the people that they couldn’t be without. The people that mattered. Therefore, logically, Cas should be at home there. But he wouldn’t pick a room, even now that he was human. Yeah, it shouldn’t matter. It shouldn’t bother Dean that whenever Cas came back, he came without possessions or a permanent place to rest. Not that he even had to rest before now, but… It didn’t seem right that he didn’t have a place where everything was his. A place where he knew he belonged.
“Hey. Hey…, man,” Dean clapped a hand on Cas’s bare shoulder, then immediately retracted it when Cas looked at him in shock. He knew both of them were remembering Hell, remembering Cas’s handprint burned into Dean’s flesh. Remembering Purgatory and prayers. Remembering the cold nights when-- Dean swallowed, throat clicking. “I know that it’s hard for you to adjust to humanity. It’s...I’m here if you want to talk about it.”
Dean wanted him to stay and watch cowboy movies on the couch and make pie and watch him fall asleep and--
He stands before the cracked mirror in the bar-bathroom and washes out his mouth. Wrecked hair and bruised lips look back at him.
“Hello, Dean.” That was when Dean knew he was dying, and he didn’t even care because Cas was there. He could see him.
He meant it to be a joke, but it hung bitterly between them, an awkward silence that reminded Dean of the way he couldn't manage a single word when Cas was pouring his heart out before he died, again.
He thinks of his father, and how he called him a pussy whenever he cried, and he’s ashamed. It burns him up, red hot and aching. The shame. Shame for the way his mouth is curious about the curve of Cas’s throat. Shame for the way his body reacts to the closeness of Cas, the way that the closeness isn’t close enough. Shame and desire and longing all tied up in knots inside of him. Tied around his throat, and he can’t say it, can’t say anything. It isn’t fair, it isn’t fair--
"How come they're falling into Dean's house, anyway?" Sam asked like it was a perfectly innocent question, like he wasn't getting at something with it. Dean wasn't fooled for a second, gave him a look to tell him to quit it. He knew Sam was getting at something, something he didn't like, even as Sam shrugged and pushed away a stray strand of hair from his face. He glanced back at Cas, saw Cas struggling with something before it vanished, smoothed over to be replaced with the face of an absolute goddamn liar.
"My dick's gonna break, I think I got friction burns on it." Cas reached back, looking for it like a familiar friend. He gently caressed the head, thumb running under the ridge before channeling his grace there. He needed Dean ready but Dean pulled back, pulled away from him like he wanted to stop. The thought made panic spike in him. They couldn't stop, he needed more, needing to keep pleasuring Dean until he got him pregnant.
"They're company and I like guinea pigs more than angels. I called him Dean because I expected," Cas paused, focused on the guinea pig again. He moved Dean's hands so he could hold it himself as he rose back onto his feet and let go of Dean. The other Dean rested quietly against Cas' chest, against the white of his shirt. "I expected longer before you arrived." Cas glanced at the curtains behind him, the ones Dean had to hang up himself, and it clicked. Cas had made this house, worked on it by himself to make it right for Dean, to make it the kind of home Dean would want. He just hadn't had the time to do the finishing touches before Dean had got himself killed like an idiot.
"You can see it?" It sounded weird, breathless, as if it was a shock but not like how it was a shock for him. Like Dean was seeing something he shouldn't have, which okay, fair. He wasn't supposed to see himself looking like a glow-stick that had been cracked a whole bunch of times, he was pretty damn sure of that.
"The fuck..." He blinked, looked again but yup, there was still a golden glow around him. He lifted his arm, saw the glowing golden cracks running down his arm, opened his palm to see glowing lines there under the soap too. Cracks running up his palm, up and along each finger. The glow wasn't surrounding him, it was coming from inside him. "What the hell is this?"
Sam approached, wiping the blood off his forehead with the back of his hand. Dean wanted to go already, but the shift in Sam's expression, a bitch face that said he was gearing up for an argument, made him stiffen up against the door. The pain shot up him in response to the sudden movement, a wince he barely shut down and made Sam's face tighten in response.
He was still tired as hell though. He could feel himself starting to fall asleep as he pulled back from Cas' lips, looking at him through half-lidded eyes. The fondness on Cas' face as he reached up, traced his thumb along a crack on his cheek. Dean yawned, eyes shutting even as he tried to keep them open. He wanted to take in the expression on Cas' face for just a few minutes longer.
"I've never had to heal it." Cas sounded amused by that, even more amused by his frustrated and horny groan in response. It'd be cute if he didn't need it so badly. As it was he tried to give Cas a glare, muted by how hard he was. Damn it. Cas was a goddamn tease and it made his toes curl. Cas finally moved his mouth down to kiss the very tip of his cock before kissing his way along the shaft. Dean shifted under his lips, asking for more without a word that Cas took his sweet time to answer. By the time he finally slid into Cas' mouth, his hips were shaking from how badly he needed it, and oh man, it felt fucking amazing to be in that warm, wet mouth.
"Can you?" Cas looked at Sam in shock, like he hadn't noticed him walk into the room, before wetting his lips. Dean refused to be distracted by it, or by the way Cas was no longer meeting his eyes.
It was a betrayal. He'd realized it too late, but it was. He'd betrayed Dean, who trusted him, even when he shouldn't have. Misled him into thinking this was less than it was, was more than it could ever be. He would have to live with that too.
"From the first time I healed you." Dean shut his eyes and let out a hiss. Couldn't help thinking of all the angels he'd seen since then, all of them knowing something about him that he didn't. "Ah. That bothers you."
He didn't look like this earlier. He would have noticed the fact he was suddenly glowing, light cracking out of him like he was -
Cas took it as enough. It shouldn't be, Cas deserved more, but he still took it as enough and damn it, it was the sort of kindness that made him fall for Cas in the first place. It was enough to make Cas kiss his lips briefly, murmuring his thanks against them before kissing his way back down to his neck. His hand stayed on Dean's shoulder, his grace humming against his skin, the cracks brighter as Cas kissed along them. It only moved as Cas moved further down him, lingered on his chest and all the stupid injuries he'd got there. So many faded scars, visible again, that Cas lavished his attention on like he was kissing them better. His lips making a line on his newly healed ribs, carefully checking it'd healed with his mouth and fingers. Slowly, patiently, ignoring how hard it was getting him until he finally, finally reached the dip of his hips.
"What's his name?" Dean couldn't keep the amusement out of his voice, had a feeling he might be able to guess what it was. Cas looked a little uncomfortable but answered it anyway.
"It's already leaking out of you. You sure you can handle more?" Cas let out a frustrated noise between his teeth, tried to push himself onto Dean's dick but slid past it, slipping on the come trying to escape. The ache was hurting him and burning a hole in his chest. It hurt like he was on fire and Dean was still waiting like it was nothing.
"Cas..." He didn't reply. His hands moved down, tugged on his tee in a way that Dean understood instinctively and pulled it up and off himself. Cas paused, drunk him in like he was dying of thirst, before moving his hand to Dean's left shoulder and pressing over the glowing lines of the hand print. Dean started, felt Cas' grace thrum through his fingers into his skin. When he glanced down, the light was even brighter than before under Cas' hand.
"If any angel gets hold of me in this state, even my allies, they will breed me and breed me before sending me back to Heaven to breed me more, and I will lose this war." His knees buckled but Dean's hands on his arms held him up. The touch swelled inside him, pushed at him and he could feel his human body falter from those hands. He wanted to surrender to Dean, would agree to anything if it'd get Dean to mate with him, bury himself deep in him and wreck him completely. Dean didn't still get it. It was infuriating, like it was intentional, like he didn't know that Cas wouldn't be here if he wasn't desperate.
"You are going to, right?" The desperation was undignified. At this point, when Cas had touched him everywhere but his cock, he could deal with it if it meant Cas would finally fucking touch his cock.
He was panting, considering just going 'fuck it' and touching himself when Cas caressed the arch of his foot, ran his thumb along it before pulling back up. He reached his cock and just - looked at it.
"Ready as I'll ever be." Dean swallowed, joined Sam at the table and took the mortar to start crushing the ingredients in the pestle. There was always this moment, the calm before the storm, before whatever monster was causing havoc arrived. The clouds – when did those clouds show up, anyway? – overhead grew darker as Sam started the chant. It felt ominous.
Nobody came for the guinea pig. Despite waiting for the inevitable knock on the door from some kid, or maybe from some angel that wasn't as much of a prick as the rest of them were and willing to help a kid praying for help out (okay, he was thinking of Cas), nobody appeared.
"Fine, but I'm driving." It was a compromise. Dean would put up with Sam driving, and Sam would quit nagging him about his injuries. It would make Dean sigh, if the pain from his ribs didn't suggest that would be a very poor course of action. Instead he pushed himself back off from the door, looked at the driver's seat with barely concealed longing before switching sides.
"Thank you, Dean." He felt Dean relax in his arms. He meant it. He was overwhelmed and awed. Something else was there too. Happiness. In the moment he felt a happiness he knew he would never get to feel again. He could feel the echo of Dean in his grace, the heat and wetness of Dean's come inside him, the angel and human breeding tangling up together. He was holding Dean in his arms and knew he would never do it again after today. He held Dean and Dean let him, sunk into his embrace as he shut his eyes. Head pillowed on his chest, hair brushing against his neck as he worked his fingers through it to calm it. It was beautiful, a sight that made love swell inside Cas.
"So Cas has been protecting you?" The guinea pig didn't reply, it seemed more interested in the palm of Dean's hand as he rested it in front of its head. "He's good at that. He's really good at that. Got such a big heart that it gets him in trouble all the time. I mean, look at you guys. You forced him to come here." The guinea pig wasn't troubled by this revelation and stayed where it was, cupped carefully within Dean's hands as he stroked it again. "That dumbass thinks I was the one who made him like that, but I think he's finally realized that's not true." Even to the guinea pig, who wouldn't judge him, wouldn't understand him in the first place, he couldn't admit the next part. How it'd been growing inside him for longer than he'd ever realized, how long it'd taken him even after Cas was snatched away to fully understand it. How much he loved Cas. Not like a best friend, not like a brother, like how he loved Sam. It was something else.
"Look at me." Cas looked, meeting Dean's eyes like he had thousands of times before. Just not like this. Not with the tip of Dean's cock brushing on the edge of his rim, some of his come leaking out of his hole and making his dick slide against it. Not with the promise of more, of what he needed - wanted - so close. The silence dragged. Cas wanted to claw at his own skin, at Dean's skin to get him to do it, to push inside him. The look in Dean's eyes, searching for something, stopped him. Dean needed to look at him, and Cas let him, even if he wanted so much more. He opened himself to Dean's gaze just like he'd opened his legs for him.
It hit him as suddenly as revelation. Dean was knocking him up. It wasn't just dirty talk. His heat made it real. Dean was a human impregnating him, an Angel of the Lord, even as he waged war in Heaven itself. It wasn't going to be new angels or new humans born from this.
"It's your house, Dean. That makes it your problem." Dean considered the guinea pig in his hands. It looked fancy, white with spots of dark brown on it and long, flowing well-groomed hair, as it tried to wriggle its way out of his grip. It looked like someone's pet. Someone, out there, had lost their pig.
"God, you feel so good. Gonna get you pregnant like this." He felt Dean coming inside him. He dug his grace into Dean's back too as he felt himself coming undone, unraveling under Dean as his seed filled him, kept Dean hard and inside him, pounding even as he came, working so hard to knock him up, breeding him like he needed it.
"I am not ashamed of loving you." Despite that bold statement there was hesitance in Cas' voice that didn't match it and made Dean frown. "But I don't want that to be a burden on you." Oh, of course. Of course Cas was more worried about that than about himself. As if Cas' love would be a burden on him. The only burden Cas ever put on him was when he went off and did something stupid without telling him because he didn't want him to get involved.
"Easy." Dean paused, grabbing pillows to support Cas' hips before pushing all the way into him, balls deep in Cas' ass and bottoming out. "Hold onto me, 'cause I'm about to rail you like you've never been railed before, angel." Cas groaned, grabbed onto Dean's back and held on, fingers digging in tight as Dean thrust. Easy at first, not enough, drawing noises of complaint from him until Dean sped up and started to pound into him. A shift in angle and Cas' nails dug into Dean's back, breath stuttering in his chest from it, the unexpected jolt that sent his heat into overdrive. Incoherent words fell from his lips as Dean hit it again, another jolt shuddering through him. Not quite enough but something else, something that made his cock ache and twitch against Dean's stomach, smeared pre-come on it.
Cas wasn't an expert, but his enthusiasm was more than enough as he let Dean push deeper into his mouth. His hands buried themselves in Cas' hair again and the hum of appreciation in response made him shudder. He couldn't let himself look at it, at his cock between Cas' lips because it'd push him over and he wanted this to last, even as Cas sucked his cock like he was trying to draw his life out of him through it. Instead he dug his fingers hard into Cas' scalp, bit back his moans with years of experience of needing to be quiet as Cas grabbed the trembling thighs around his head. When he came it was deep in his mouth, fast and furious spurts down his throat as he arched back on the mattress. Cas swallowed down around him, swallowed all his come like it was nothing, and holy shit, it felt like every single bone in his body had gone limp.
"Mornin', handsome." Dean saw how Cas softened around the edges at that, as if he'd never dared hope for this. He leaned in, kissed him again like he didn't likely have morning breath. Cas opened to it, let him in to kiss his way into his mouth, lips parting as his fingers moved to run through Dean's hair and a hand curled around his neck. It was protective, his hand lingering when Cas pulled back to stare into his eyes.
"I'm in trouble." A pause. It dragged out, made Cas shut his eyes before he leaned his head back against the roughness of the wall. Not too proud to beg, not with what was coming. "Please tell me." It earned him a rough sigh in response. He could almost hear Dean pinch the bridge of his nose before he replied with the number of his motel room in North Dakota.
"Cas?" He heard the fear in Dean's voice as the galaxy faded from before his eyes, as he felt Dean's soul withdraw from his grace. As he came down with a bump, suddenly back in his vessel with wetness on his face. He'd cried? Unexpected. He wiped it away before reaching up, pulling Dean against his chest and his fingers moving into Dean's hair. He felt the fear in Dean too, tried to ease it even as he wondered if Dean could understand what had just happened to his soul, that it hadn't just been his seed Cas needed.
"Wait." Despite the pissy expression on his face, Sam shut up. They waited. After days of continuous exposure, Dean recognized the sound. The slightly panicky squeaking.
Dean dropped his hands, turned away from Cas as he looked at them. He couldn't meet the look in Cas' eyes, it was too much for him to handle. The light seeping out of every finger, how he'd managed to hurt every single one and how Cas had healed them. In the mirror in front of him he saw it too. Faint under the other cracks and lines he'd gained since, but still humming with grace. The glow from where Cas had touched him to heal him in Lucifer's Crypt.
"What the hell happened to me?" Cas frowned, stepped into the room and shut the door behind him. The tilt of Cas' head said he didn't get it, even though he surely couldn't miss what was wrong with him. He was glowing!
"I changed it." Like it was simple to do, like it was nothing to change a dimension, to change space and time just so Dean could see where Cas' guinea pigs lived. "I'd like you to see it."
"Back up a little, you're cornering me here." Cas knew his body was moving while he focused on forcing out his words. He couldn't stay still, his need was too strong. He needed to be pressed up close against Dean like this, tight against his chest. Close enough to smell him, really, really smell him. He smelt of sweat, the leather of the Impala, generic soap and a little aftershave. It added to the heat burning through him. It was unbearable, to be so close and not having Dean touching him everywhere.
Cas. It had to be Cas, who else would decide to sleep in a monkey suit? Dean eased his eyes open, tilted his head just slightly to look down. Even squinting, he could see the golden light shining on his hands. So that hadn't been a dream.
“I have a pretty good memory when it comes to you, Cas.” Why is it suddenly so fucking hot? He rolls the windows down, cool air rushing across his overheated cheeks. Cas watches him, as he always has: like he’s a specimen, a rare specimen.
"I won't," Cas said, instead of laughing like Dean deserved. And instead of stepping away, he moved closer. "But we need to talk about what happened that day--"
Stay. Dean says it with his body, with his gripping hands, with his heartbeat. He asks with his fingertips on Cas’s face: Do you love me? He punctuates his silent question with a stroke of his thumbs across Cas’s cheekbones as he presses their foreheads together.
This wasn’t the first time that Cas had died, but this time it was permanent. More permanent than Dean carrying Cas’s body to the burial pyre wrapped in curtains yellow as the daffodils he loved. More real than Cas bleeding out, or Cas being blown to bits. This time, there was nothing left of him. Not even his trenchcoat.
"It's not a bomb. You can just see the traces my grace leaves behind when I heal you. I need to check if there's anything else." Cas didn't shift away from his hand. The stubble on his jaw brushed against Dean's palm, against the glowing cracks of cuts for sigils and other fuck ups. Instead he reached up, fingers even more gentle against his forehead than earlier as he pressed in.
"And then?" Cas bit down on his lip. He couldn't get the words out. Couldn't explain how the pregnancy wouldn't be the problem, he could bear them without trouble. It'd be afterwards, when the new troops were safely born, when Raphael would have the time to finish making an example out of him. "Cas…"
"I prefer animals and humans. If I use this vessel, the guinea pigs are comfortable with me." Dean let out a hum, sort of understanding what Cas meant. If humans couldn't cope with Cas' true form, guinea pigs probably didn't stand much of a chance either. A guinea pig scaled Dean, and as Dean helped it up, he recognized it.
"Cas, seriously, what the hell is going on?" Cas turned, palm closing up under the weight of Dean's eyes, fierce but worried. He met Dean's eyes without hesitation and noticed the absence in the room. No Sam. Fine by him. It'd make this easier if it was just Dean. Cas held his gaze and ignored how he could feel heat creeping along his skin. It was starting to kick in as Dean got closer to him and ignored his personal space.
"Why would they pick you if they wanted to know about grace?" It was a good question, since he sure as hell didn't know anything about it. If they wanted that, they would have been better off kidnapping an angel. As long as it wasn't Cas, Dean would welcome them picking the brains of any angel they wanted. They probably deserved it.
He felt great. He wasn't sure if that was from the grace that he could still feel curled up inside him, or from the simple fact that Cas hadn't left during the night. Hadn't even left the bed to strip down and get more comfortable.
"I did a test on one, and it showed it's not from this dimension. It might be an overlapping dimension, or something else that's close to that. So, if we open up a portal in the back yard to their original dimension, then according to this book, it'll suck them all back up again." Dean scooped up the guinea pig on his thigh into his hands to join Sam for a closer look at the book. Even by medieval standards, the illustration next to the text was incompetently done.
Not entirely alone. He felt the roll inside him, felt it growing inside him. His final weapon to win this war. After doing something unforgivable, he could at least use the results of it. It was always thus. A warrior must fight with whatever weapons they had. Raphael, unintentionally, gave him this, and he would use it to destroy him.
He'd known for so long. He'd known for so long without knowing it himself. The difference between loving someone and being in love with them, that he'd denied for so long, blinded himself to. Now, with his eyes opened, Dean's soul in his grace and the cascade of love it caused inside him, he could never close them again.
"You want to upset the kid who lost it? No, you need to hold it close to your chest, or it's gonna keep trying to escape."
"Of course." Dean cracked one eye up to give him a really good look, to make sure he wasn't just saying what he wanted to hear before sneaking off again. Cas, amused, turned them both over with a heavy thump. "We still need to talk to both of you tomorrow." Dean thought of what Sam was doing right now, how he was probably being bombarded with hundreds of questions from Jack. Probably wondering where the two of them were too and if Dean was going to show up to save him. It made him smile. Hah. After the endless questioning on the drive home, Sam could deal for one night.
"It'd be useful to have a guide, huh. If only we had a guide. If only we'd had someone willing to help us, someone you hadn't pissed off."
He had to go now. He cleaned himself up, reluctant to sweep away the evidence of this occasion, of just how successfully Dean had knocked him up. He left the come inside him, wanted to feel it, to know that this had really happened. Even if it was something that he knew he couldn't keep if he was to win this war. He pulled his clothes back on as he heard Dean moving around in the bathroom. If he didn't go now, before Dean came back out, Dean would ask him to stay. He would say yes and rain Heaven's wrath upon both of them. He knew he couldn't say no to Dean, and that he couldn't let himself say yes. He reached the door, wiped the sigil off it before vanishing just as Dean opened the bathroom door. Cas knew how Dean would react, how angry he'd be, and made his own prayer to him as he threw himself out of Dean's orbit and out of his galaxy altogether.
"I dunno, it is a little-" Cas cut him off by taking all of his cock into his mouth in one go. Dean wasn't hard yet but Cas would get him hard and he ached at the thought of it. He could feel Dean's dick swelling in his mouth as he sucked on him, edging his tongue along the underside of his cock, teasing the head. He willed the weight to grow against his tongue and fill his mouth up with cock. He needed it, needed Dean hard and ready to fuck him, let out a needy little moan against Dean's cock at the thought. His hands moved into Cas' hair and slid through it, before fingers dug into it as he sucked harder on Dean's cock. He was fully hard now, straining against the warmth of his mouth. It felt satisfying, felt perfect with the heat and need coursing through his veins and grace. He took Dean all the way down, right to the base of his cock with his nose pressed up against his pubic hair, as Dean swore and his hips strained against Cas.
"I need a shower and coffee first." Even with the pain gone, Dean needed the grime off him before starting on their next hunt. It couldn't wait, it never could wait. If it could wait, they wouldn't have come.
Lucky him. He'd pushed Raphael to resort to such a blunt tactic. He must be desperate. Castiel would have felt some grim satisfaction at that if he couldn't feel the yawn in his stomach. It was emptying, ready to be filled with heat and desire.
The squeal of the guinea pig made him pull back a little and made Cas pull back too. It was objecting, wanting to roam free. Cas moved his free hand, the one whose fingers weren't sliding into his hair and gently uncurled Dean's hands from holding onto it. Cas moved a finger to rub the top of its head, calloused palm still resting on top of Dean's hand.
"Dean-" Whatever stupid excuse Cas was about to give him, he didn't want to hear it. Not even with that pleading tone in his voice, like he needed Dean's forgiveness.
"What were they trying to find out?" Dean groaned and shut his eyes. He didn't fucking care, they were dead, but Sam still wanted the 411.
"Tell me." Cas' patience snapped, both from the desperate need to be fucked, to be bred and from Dean testing him like this, right now. All he wanted was Dean to come in him again and again. Was it really so much to ask for?
"Damn it, I need to know how to fix this. I know we can fix it but you gotta tell me what the hell is going on." The uncertainty in Cas' eyes made him go cold. This couldn't be so big so he couldn't fix it. He had to fix this. If he didn’t, that was on him and not on Cas. There had to be something. But Cas was looking at him like there was nothing, like it was beyond hope and damn it, he couldn’t give up. "Cas." His hand stayed on Cas' chin but he wasn't forcing Cas to look at him now. No, Dean cupped his face like he damn well wanted to but usually knew better than to do. It made Cas' eyes flicker, whatever fight going on behind them over and won, the uncertainty gone as he readied himself to speak.
"So what brings you here?" A sensible question from Sam. The way it was teamed with the look like he wasn't sure if he was interrupting something but doing it anyway, made Dean take a step back. For a moment, it was almost like Cas was pulling forward like a magnet, back to Dean. But he didn't. He stopped and looked at Sam, his face shifting, unreadable for a moment before it returned to neutral and serious.
"Thanks." Despite the fact that it was a dismissal, a hint that Cas really should pull back, he still lingered in the space he'd stepped into to heal him. A closeness that Dean should have pulled away from but didn't.
"You know what made me uncomfortable? You ignoring my calls. What the hell, Cas? You did hear my prayers?"
Was he about to go nuclear? Maybe that was their plan all along, to rig him up as a walking bomb and blow him to hell once he thought he was safe and dry. The thought punched any tiredness out of him. He was running on fumes but the adrenaline shot through him as he rinsed off and jumped out of the shower. The glow was brightest on his ribs where Cas had just healed him. It shone like a beacon, nearly blinded him with how bright it was. At first it looked random, but there was a pattern to it, every crack lining up with an injury Cas had healed. Through the fog of the mirror, he could see them on his face too. Cuts and bruises long since healed and gone, shining back at him again.
He got it. He finally grasped why so many human failings seemed to involve sex, how it could destroy men who couldn't be taken by any army. It made a terrible, clear sense as he pulled back, sliding Dean all the way out of his ass, just the tip nudging against his hole before slamming his hips back down in one swoop. It made Dean stutter, frustrated and wanting, made Dean reach out to guide his hips before Cas slapped his hands away. No. He was going to make Dean come and he didn't need Dean's guidance to do it. He'd do it his way, take care of everything, of all of his needs. All Dean needed to do was fill him up with his come.
"Something like that, yes. Jack is much better than Chuck at being God, but I prefer doing anything other than dealing with them. I tend to leave that to him." A pause. "I don't think he likes doing that either." Cas sounded fond, a little indulgent, like he was still teaching Jack about the world. Maybe he was.
He turned back again to face Cas. The furrow of his brow said he wanted to heal whatever was wrong, as if that hadn't got them into this mess in the first place. The intensity in his eyes, trying to make it right, trying to understand what Dean needed. He couldn't ask for it, but maybe it was better if he just showed it instead.
"You completely spaced out! I'm not doing this like that." Accusatory, like Cas had done something wrong. Maybe he had, maybe he'd broken some rule he didn't know. The heat clawed at his skin as he tried to figure it out, fogging his mind up. What did he do wrong? He wanted Dean, wanted Dean to get him pregnant and Dean had agreed to. Until now.
"Dean." It was a request for him to open his eyes, to look at Cas again. He did it slowly, met Cas staring back up at him. Cas didn't look bothered or annoyed. Maybe a little wistful but it was tempered by the sheer affection in his eyes. "I have many regrets, but I don't regret healing you or that they can see it. They don't understand but they wouldn't. I only regret that they used it to hurt you."
"What is it, a baby?" Dean held it close to his chest anyway, which seemed to calm it down. "Hey, it's probably hungry. Wanna split your lunch? I'm sure it'll enjoy it more." Sam rolled his eyes but picked up some of the lettuce from his plate anyway and pushed it towards Dean.
He had five minutes, maybe ten at most. If someone wasn't fucking him in fifteen minutes, he'd be attracting every angel in the continental United States to him. Even his allies couldn't be trusted now. Raphael hadn't bound his heat to another angel who'd be his partner. He was fair game to every angel and would be completely irresistible to them. In Heaven they would all hunt him down, he would never escape. He'd heard stories of it being used as punishment long ago. A way for the archangels to make an example of exceptional troublemakers who refused to learn any other way.
It was about all the stuff Cas said before the Empty took him. All the 'I cared about the whole world because of you', 'you changed me, Dean', the...the 'I love you', Cas had finally realized that he didn't mean it. Cas thought he was leaving forever, wanted to make Dean feel loved before he was taken, and it'd come out all wrong. It'd come out sounding like he was in love with Dean, which wasn't possible because he was an Angel of the Lord with all the shit that entailed, and Dean was just some far too human fuck up. It was impossible and Cas had realized that once he was back in heaven, back where he belonged despite not being a complete jack off like the other angels. That was why Cas was avoiding him, was still avoiding him even as he fixed this stupid guinea pig problem he'd caused.
"Shut up." There was no fire in it though, and the guinea pig did look happy with the lettuce. Dean met Sam's eyes, just a little smug about it, and it hit him again just how glad he was to have his brother back with him too.
"Sure. Go wild." He turned onto his back at the small sound of relief his answer caused. He watched the shift of Cas' shoulders, capable of holding so much weight, as he moved on top of him and leaned in, lips pressed against his forehead. It took a few more kisses to realize where this was going. Gentle, reverent kisses along his brow, down to his cheek bones, pausing to linger along his jaw. Every single one along one of the cracks Cas had fixed. Like they really did make him worthwhile as he said last night.
"Yeah, you keep saying that Cas, it's been all about what you need. But what do you want?" Cas tried to parse the question. The ache in his body from not having what he needed, not being filled with cock right now was scrambling his brain. What was the difference? He needed Dean and he wanted Dean. Need and want were the same thing in this moment. Dean didn't move back to the bed as he stared at him, as Cas wetted his lips. He didn't get it but didn't want to argue the difference. So he said it, voice needing and low and yes, wanting too.
Whatever Dean was looking for, he found it. He leaned in closer. Calmer, in control, and Cas shuddered to feel his breath against his neck. "That's what you want? You want me to breed you? Get you pregnant? Fuck you until you're so full of my come that you can't take any more?"
Dean pulled at his thighs, tilted the angle and pounded away inside him even harder. Cas clung on, rolled into Dean's thrusts, faster, needing more, wanting more. His body was taking the pounding like it was made for it, made to be fucked by Dean like this, destined to be fucked into oblivion, in a baby making haze and filled up with come.
Cas didn't say much after arriving. Dean didn't even get a 'hey, you've done a great job with the place' out of him, which he had. There hadn't been much to do, admittedly, the house had been nearly finished when he'd arrived. Just a few things, fixings to be attached, a final pair of curtains needing to be hung. Still, it would have been a normal thing to say, which was why Cas looked around, ignored his excellent work and said "there's more guinea pigs here than I expected" in a dead serious voice like it was a matter of life or death instead.
"Okay, look, stop. Shouldn't we just get the guinea pigs back to where they belong and then the two of you can have this stupid fight you've both been stewing over for however many years." Sam, acting as the goddamn voice of reason and making them both look like idiots. Dean sighed, gave Cas a look that said they'd be talking about this later, even if he knew they probably wouldn't, that Cas would ditch him again at the first chance he got.
"I want to kiss every part of you." Cas' voice was low and rough, with a force to it that said Cas might have been thinking about it while Dean was sleeping. Lying there, holding him in his arms and thinking about kissing him everywhere. "Can I?" It felt a little overwhelming, though not like the 'pumped him so full of his grace that it was shining out of him' thing was, and it made Dean swallow.
"Dean?" Not even a full minute and Cas was there in the doorway. No coat, no jacket, like he was planning to stay a while. Concerned but calm, much calmer than Dean felt with his heart in his throat. Like Dean wasn't leaking light like a nuclear bomb about to explode.
He hoped it was just bruising and those assholes hadn't cracked any ribs. He couldn't let Sam see it, because then they'd have to discuss urgent care, and paying for the privilege of waiting around for a radiologist to tell him that yeah, he was hurt again. Dean just wanted to go home, pop some painkillers they'd stashed from their last visit, which was way too recently for his tastes, and wash off the grime of this hunt and sleep. He could handle a couple hours of driving. The pain would keep him awake.
"For forty years. Right." Sam got down onto his knees and folded himself under the table. It definitely wasn't designed for someone as tall as Sam to fit under. It would have been funny if Sam hadn't immediately followed up with "You didn't even give Cas a call?"
Found Cas too, holding the guinea pig close to his chest, protecting it from the approaching threat. Cas, Mr. Mystery, king of freaking disappearing without a single word, who he hadn't seen since the Empty stole him away, was staring at him like a deer caught in headlights and clutching a guinea pig to his chest.
"That's not true." Dean looked up, saw Cas watching them from the doorway to the kitchen. Cas sounded sincere, more sincere than the circumstances merited. Cas walked over, crouched down in front of Dean, careful to not touch his knees, as Dean lowered the guinea pig back down onto his thighs. Cas didn't look at him and focused on the guinea pig instead. "They've been very happy here. You've taken great care with them, despite not wanting to." Cas finally looked up then, the deep sincerity in his blue eyes, the look that Dean would have described as adoring if it wasn't aimed at him. "Thank you, Dean." Dean couldn't tear his eyes away, couldn't stop looking into Cas' eyes, felt that tightness across his chest that wasn't real now but he could still feel anyway. Parted his lips to say something but couldn't. Cas tilted his head. Just a little, not like he did when he was confused, but how he did when he was listening, waiting to hear what Dean was going to say. As if it was the most important thing in the world. Dean swallowed.
Dean scampered backwards, tossing the towel at Cas’s chest. “There, now no one will slip on a puddle.” He grinned at Cas. A definite mistake, because now Cas was tousled, and it simply was not acceptable, and his excuse about stress was not helping the situation south of the border, the border being his belt. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, I’ll leave you to it. I have a lot to do--”
“I love you,” Cas says, and he’s so close that the words on his breath caress Dean’s lips. A mad impulse, a slight tilt and Dean is the bravest most foolish man in the world.
“Dean, what is it?” And Cas’s eyes were so very blue, his voice so gravelly. The man must gargle glass to get such a voice and--
“Cas, Cas!” Dean’s hips snap upwards and Cas grinds down because shit there’s no time for words after all these years, but they have to talk. They have to--
“Why?” and Dean’s heart is trying to escape again, because he knows. He knows Cas loves him as surely as he knows that his baby is the best car, as sure as he knows the sky is blue.
"Dean I— I'm so sorry— I stayed up late to finish it, but I must have been too tired and, I'm sorry," He mumbled, and hung his head, lips trembling, "—I won't do it again, I'm sorry—"
"But nobody wants to come forward. We do need a leader, but we don't know anyone who can take this movement ahead." Silence followed Castiel's words, but a moment later, it was Benny who spoke up. "But I do."
how ready Castiel was. As they continued sucking at each other's lips, Castiel felt Dean lay him back down on the bed as his lips coaxed Castiel's. Castiel slipped him tongue, and felt Dean's cock twitch at Castiel's thigh, pulling an unbidden chuckle out of him. Dean simply stopped and stared down at Castiel with light amusement.
Dean expected harsh words about what was wrong and what was right, about knowing better, about failed expectations, but instead—
Silence came oddly loud after that. Benny had gone quiet, seemingly drinking in Dean's words for a second. On his face, Dean could see doubts and questions, and yet, Benny didn't let a single one slip out as he staggered back a few steps.
Dean nodded, unable to say anything more, as he wiped his tears away, and sucked in a few, deep breaths. He slunk away from Bobby, back against his chair, and sighed. His skin felt numb, and though he wanted to move, he couldn't find it in himself to do so.
"Don't care." Before Castiel could even realise what was happening, Dean was hauling him up in his arms, hooking Castiel's legs around his waist, and Castiel yelped at the suddenness of it, before giving into Dean's touch and slinging his arms around Dean's neck.
Slowly, Dean's feet carried him closer and closer to Castiel, who was humming a Zeppelin song under his breath as he browsed through the books, and it seemed as if one of the books was too high. Castiel stood up on the tip of his toes, stretching his arm up to reach for one of the books at the very top, when at once, Dean noticed the step-ladder creak and tremble, and in an instant, before Castiel could even blink, he was dashing forward to hold Castiel up by the hips. Castiel's eyes met Dean's. He let out an incredulous gasp, before chuckling, and pressing their foreheads together.
"Cas." Dean started, wanting to defend himself, knowing there was nothing he could say that would change the intensity of what he did.
A loud cough a few feet away brought Dean staggering back to the present, and he glanced up to find the librarian, Mrs. Mosely, staring down at him with a sassy look in her eyes.
"Dean," He gasped, "—please—" He couldn't tell what he was pleading for, or why, all he knew was that he needed. more of everything Dean had to give to him; was giving to him.
"Yeah? Aw, you made a wittle mistake? Are you gonna' cry now? Want me to kiss it better? Fucking idiot," Dean growled, and walked away, into the living room. Castiel followed after him, dejected and quiet, and lingered at the doorway, simply watching as Dean groaned, and lounged back against the couch, making himself comfortable.
Benny sucked in a breath, before letting his fork drop down next to his tray, "-nothing much. I just— about Friday, I—"
They walked out the conference room, ignoring the obvious chatter about them the second they left, and Dean guided Castiel to the elevator. The silence in the air was thick, heavy, suffocating— anticipation and impatience lingered in the air, and Dean couldn't find it in himself to turn back, because one look at Castiel's tousled, raven hair and those obscene, pink lips and Dean would lose it.
Castiel let out a disappointed sigh, before turning his eyes down to his book. Things hadn't always been this way. At the start, at the very start, Dean had been the sweetest, most gentle person Castiel had seen. He helped everyone with their doubts, helped them write good answers, and even extended deadlines if the time called for it. Never shouted, never argued. He was sweet, funny, kind and with a heart of gold. It was why Castiel had fallen in love with him in the first place. Watching how knowledgeable, how well-versed he was with what he taught— that was just a bonus.
"Oh, this?" He asked in turn, pressing his finger against the dark, purple bruise under his right eye, evidence of the slap John had struck on his face the night before, "-erm—"
place," Castiel snapped, "—I would love to stay and listen to you and your husband crush each other's throats, but I have more important things to do, like apologize to the one person who loves me more than anything in the world."
"Stop looking at me like that, creep," He growled, but his voice had lost its edge. Castiel shrugged nonchalantly, and picked up his pen, leaning forward to write, but the moment he did, the fabric of the panties slipped inside his ass, rubbing over his taint. Two gasps rung through the room. One, understandably Castiel's, and the other—
With every word Castiel said, Dean only felt his chest tighten. It wasn't until Castiel sniffled, and pressed against Dean's chest for comfort that Dean could even think right again. All he could think of was how he would twist every single bone in Alastair's body if he ever saw the boy again. But then Castiel words rung through his mind.
"Come on, he can't be better than me, I can't accept that, my ego can't accept that, Castiel." The three of them burst into a chuckle, and the sound of it was only cut short when they heard Naomi saunter into the room.
"It's alright. Why wouldn't it be? You like spreading your legs open for weird men, don't you? You probably even think of taking their wrinkly cocks too, don't you? God, you're a sick bastard."
They parted a few moments later, and made their way back down to the library where Anna, Meg, and Benny had fallen into casual conversation. At the sight of Dean and Castiel, the three of them turned their eyes up. "Sorry about that," Castiel sighed, as he pulled out a seat for him and Dean.
"Castiel, we're counting on you, alright?" Anna smiled, and Castiel felt more at peace with the love he could feel thrumming in his veins from the rest of them. Castiel sucked in a breath.
"Mr. Singer. Dean once told me, he's like an uncle to Dean. And he's a good person, he can help us."
Silence settled between them as they passed the empty corridors of Lawrence High, and without the hubbub of students, it felt almost eerily out of place. The walk down to Bobby's cabin was short, but with how oddly silent they were, it seemed to drag on for hours until they finally arrived at the narrow door to his cabin. Bobby pushed the door open and made himself at home as he walked over to the window sill, and leaned back against it, simply watching Dean. Dean shut the door behind him, and lingered idly for a moment, before Bobby spoke again.
"No, not really. I mean, he was quite decent when we were younger. But as we grew older, when we started making choices of our own, some of which didn't please him, we kind of grew apart. Dad used to be in the Marines, but after he retired, he got into starting the garage, and slowly, he got into alcohol too. We didn't know how to stop him, and he wouldn't listen to his friends. They left him to himself, but we couldn't."
When Dean pulled out, he watched as a stream of his come dripped down Castiel's hole, onto his thigh, and Dean promptly pushed it back inside, where it belonged.
"Good," Dean nodded. And after a beat, added, "—and now that you're single, how about a date with a real man, huh?"
Silence settled between them, and Castiel let himself drink in the sight of Dean, beautiful as always, glowing in the dregs of sunlight pouring in through the narrow window at the top of the empty corridor. His eyes were deep, not the usual apple-green, but a new, bittersweet ivy-green, as he stared down at Castiel. Behind his eyes, Castiel could see hesitation. Perhaps, he wanted to say something, do something, and Castiel wondered if it was the same thing Castiel wanted to do.
Dean groaned, trying to steady his breath as he felt the warm, wet suction of Castiel's mouth pulling his cock inside. Every moment was one step closer to the edge, and Dean tightened his fingers in Castiel's hair to keep him in place. Damn it, the man didn't seem to have a fucking gag reflex, if the way he was hungrily swallowing down Dean's cock was to judge by.
Castiel felt his chest drop, and yet, he smiled reluctantly. Meg was fun to have around, they talked about boys, about girls, about school, about movies— she was growing closer to Cas every day, and being with her made him feel at peace. But he knew Dean would spend the day, so unwillingly, he let Meg go.
"I'm bored. Can you untie me, please? I won't bother you, I'll just go back to doing what I was before you came." Castiel pleaded, and blinked his big, round princess eyes up at Dean with such innocence,
"What are you talking about?" Castiel asked, trying to compose himself as he tried to push Dean's arm away from his chest, but in vain.
"That so, boy? Well, in that case, I should just break every bone in your body, shouldn't I? And this—" Dean laughed, and stepped on Alastair's crotch, watching as the colour bled from Alastair's face, and he gasped and choked on the floor, "-you wanted to fuck Cas till he was
In the kitchen, Castiel had ended up seated on a barstool before the island counter, and Dean was rummaging through the fridge and shelves to find pans and spatulas. Somewhere along the line, they'd both chosen to have pancakes. Castiel was excited beyond compare, although he wouldn't show it. Having Dean cook for him, rather
Dean's rough hands— hands Castiel had always craved for on his body, crawled down Castiel's heated, smooth skin, down to the inside of his thigh. Dean's hand grazed across the tip of Castiel's cock, and Castiel bit down on his lip to refrain a whimper. Dean let his forehead rest against Castiel's, as Castiel sucked in shallow breaths. Teasing as always, Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel's cock, and began tugging at it in slow, lazy strokes. Castiel squeezed his arm around Dean's neck, and felt his eyes roll to the back of his head as Dean rubbed at the tip of his cock.
A palpable shudder coursed through Dean, and both of their eyes met for a second, before Dean was pushing his tongue into his cheek and suppressing a smirk, hands already traveling down to the metallic buckle of his belt.
There was a lingering feeling of dread and fear nagging at Castiel, and he knew he was eating up Mr. Singer's time, he knew he was disrespecting him by staying silent, but he couldn't form a thought, he couldn't think of anything coherent to begin with, and it was making him jumpy and touchy. All he wanted to do was go home and crawl into bed.
Said boyfriend, however, was lying on the couch on his stomach, a headset on his ears, and a console in his hands as he propped himself up on his elbows. Instantly, Dean's eyes wandered down his body, where he was wearing Dean's loose, Black Sabbath t-shirt which slipped down his shoulder and revealed his tempting, glistening neck; paired with what Dean decided were the shortest, tightest, flashiest orange panties. Just the sight of Castiel's ass had Dean growing tighter in his trousers, and
And suddenly, Castiel was clenching around Dean's cock, rocking back and fucking himself to the hilt, because damn it, Dean knew he would be up for it, up for licking his come clean, slut that he was.
"Fuck, baby, I love you so much—" Dean grunted, holding Castiel's head in his hand as he dove down to seize Castiel's neck in a ferocious littering of bruises and bites and nips. Castiel held onto Dean's shirt, rocking back and forth with every thrust, every push, every pounding.
"Cas, sweetheart," Dean whispered, and got up on his knees to pull Castiel into a soft, warm hug. He felt Castiel crumple his uniform shirt in his hands, and the wetness of his tears seeped into Dean's shirt. When Dean shut his eyes, all he could think of was the pair of guilty, pain-stricken eyes he'd witnessed on Friday, and his own legs threatened to shake under him as he held onto Cas.
Dean in that moment, nevertheless, he rolled his eyes, and slapped the workbook against his face, trying to suppress the heat rising at his cheeks. Dean didn't budge, simply tossed the workbook aside, and took another drag of his cigarette. It was strange watching someone smoke from up close, but with the intensity in Dean's eyes, it seemed too natural for him, as if he'd been doing it for ages.
Sighing, Castiel rubbed his hands across his face, and always wiped away a few tears pooling at his eyes, before clapping his hands on his thighs and getting up. He walked out of Dean's bedroom, and found Sam seated at the table in the kitchen, munching away at a bowl of cereal. The moment he saw Castiel, Sam broke into a grin, and Castiel smiled back.
"Oh, oh, oh—" Castiel moaned, breathless and choked as Dean slipped a hand inside his panties, and rubbed a dry finger against the boy's slick, lubed hole.
understand the intensity of being raped and abused? And these aren't allegations, these are facts. We have witnesses to account for these. We have a line of students ready to tell you just how much Alastair Knight has wrecked havoc in their lives. But nobody has been willing to come up and speak about it." Castiel said, and watched as Mrs. Berry studied him.
Next Update date is uncertain, but the update will surely be there. Sorry for leaving you guys hanging, and just as a side note, the next few chapters will really see the resolution of the Alastair/Castiel storyline, after which, the main focus will shift onto Cas/Dean's relationship. Thanks for bearing with me.
Castiel pouted, mumbling to himself as he sent Dean a vicious glare, but sat quietly on the chair with his legs spread open and arms tied behind his back. Goddamnit, Dean would give anything to bury his face between the boy's thighs and eat him out until he was gasping for air. Castiel would make the prettiest noises, Dean just knew, with soft moans, mewls, and loud, breathless screams. He'd squirm against the chair, and his thighs would tremble, but Dean wouldn't stop.
"—fuck, look to your left—" Castiel growled into his headset, and hissed, annoyed at someone on the screen as he tapped away furiously at his gaming console. Just Dean's life with a boyfriend much younger than him. With a deep breath, Dean stalked forward, careful steps carrying him towards the edge of the couch, where Castiel had his legs held up and floating in the air. Dean leaned forward, and nudged the headset to the side, enough for Castiel's attention to be drawn to it.
"But you know there's never been anyone like you, Cas. You're my everything, I swear. The things you make me feel, the way you love me, nobody's made me feel that way before. You idiot," Dean chuckled softly, "—I almost killed someone for you, and here you are, thinkin' there could possibly be something that could take me away from you. I've fucked people I liked, sure, but I've— I've never made love to anyone before."
and I blamed you for it. I was wrong. I was wrong, alright? I really was," Castiel sputtered out another sob, "—thank you for standing up for me, Dean. Not just now, but— but always, with Alastair, with the club, and now with mom. And thank you for, for being my rock. For being the one person who always has my back. I was angry, and I said some things I didn't mean, I over-reacted, just please don't think they're true, just don't ever, ever think I don't need you. I'm sorry, Dean," Castiel broke into a snivel, "—I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, Dean—"
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, and flipped over through the sample questionnaire, before sucking in a breath and handing it over to Dean.
Even then, as Dean's body floated towards his climax, his mind could comprehend nothing but a small, brunet twink.
Castiel smiled, and pressed his face into Dean's neck to breath in the scent of soap. They met again, languid this time, as their lips found each other, and their hands flew and legs twined, bodies rocking against the bed as they tasted every inch of each other's mouths, pulling away to catch their breaths. Their eyes met, and Dean's were bright as always.
, this was wrong, this was so, so, wrong. The boy was just seventeen, for fuck sake, and Dean was nearing twenty-six, there was a stark gap in their age, which God, Dean shouldn't have found hot. The boy was inexplicably gorgeous, and begging for a cock in his pussy, shit, how could Dean keep holding back?
Tension coursed through every single nerve in Castiel's body, and all he could do was imagine a scenario where he would have to beg Alastair to stop. Either Alastair would beat him to a pulp with the nearest sledgehammer, or he would—
Oh, right, and Dean had the nasty, purple bruise on his face that his father gave him. And Castiel had helped him cover it. Was that when Dean noticed the kit? Hm.
Speechless, Dean nodded, and snatched the bottle of beer out of Benny's hands to press it to his own lips. He winced, but swallowed a huge gulp, and with a hiss, handed the bottle back to Benny. His head pounded, but it felt rejuvenating, and a newfound vigour seeped into his movements as he clamped a hand over Benny's shoulder. His breath grew heavier, shallower, and he felt a determined smile spread across his face, "-Ben, I'm gonna' find Cas and I'm gonna' tell him I love him. Right now."
Waking up was disconcerting. Having been used to sleeping alone and awaking to a cold, empty bed, Castiel faltered at the realisation of having Dean's legs entwined within his thighs, and Dean's chest pressed flush against his back, with the sound of his steady heartbeat thrumming in his chest. Perhaps, somewhere over the course of the night, they'd ended up tangled within each other, but Castiel wasn't complaining. In fact, with the way he'd been resting his head against Dean's arm for God knows how long, he didn't even have the right to complain. It took him a few seconds to compose himself, before the events of the night before came staggering back to him. He paused in his tracks, eyes wide and mouth hung open, as he recalled Dean's words, their confession, and the— the kiss. The kiss Castiel had so unabashedly stolen from Dean's lips.
"You tell your boyfriend not to come in for the week. Tell him to get as much rest as he can, kay?" Bobby sighed, and with one final clap to Dean's shoulder, rose up from beside him. "And don't worry about his absentee record, I've got connections. You just tell him to take some time off. And don't act like a fuckin' knucklehead with him, use your mind and control your anger, ya' idjit."
"Ice cream," Dean says. "You and me. We’ll take a drive, or walk. Hell--we can even take a plane if you want."
Sam finds him in the Spring. Finds him fucked up in a room above a roadhouse, finds him clutching a bloody coat surrounded with empty bottles.
He stumbles backwards, and Cas collapses in on himself, head dropping and shoulders shrinking. Dean prays and prays. I didn’t mean to hurt you, I want you so much that I can’t stand to touch you.
But Dean is crying in Cas’s arms--a fucking chick-flick moment if ever there was one--listening to Cas talk about his soul and he can’t take it anymore, he has to, he has to--
“Fuck, fuck, Cas--” A prayer falling from Dean’s mouth as Cas palms his dick.  Cas. Fucking. That’s the correlation, Dean thinks as distantly he’s aware of his own voice making sounds he never knew he could make. Whimpers and keens and low moans that scrape his throat.
And he didn’t mean to grab Cas’s arm, but he needed to hold onto something because he felt like he was falling and for some reason Cas was the only thing that would keep him steady.
Dean choked on the coffee, wishing that Cas had a more adept grip on the connotations of things that he said. He tried very hard to not think of Cas's powerful thighs, or the domineering thing he did with his brows when he was displeased. The way he was probably quite capable of pound--
Seeing Cas in the passenger seat is making him lose his goddamn mind. He’s fucking gorgeous, irreplacably Cas. Castiel. When did it get dark? When did the sun go down and when did the stars come out? He can’t wait, he has to say he has to--
"I am in love with you, Dean. I have loved you since the first time I set my gaze upon your soul in hell, and every day since. I'm not sure that it's 'gay' considering that angels have no inherent gender, but if you mean do I desire you as a romantic and sexual partner--"
Sammy thought he drank too much, but Sam didn’t know what Cas had said. He didn’t know. He had Eileen, and the world was saved. All Dean had was his memories, because Cas was gone. Jack was gone.
Sometimes he’d fall asleep in the sweet-smelling grass and dream of Cas calling for him, reaching for him, but when he woke up his hands were empty.
Cas’s hands are everywhere, Cas’s lips, Cas’s tongue licking into his mouth like he’s lost something in there. Holy shit, Cas’s lips and Cas’s hands. Cas’s hands in his hair and pushing him back and then (in a decidedly inspired turn of events) Cas clambering to lay on top of him. Cas kissing him more thoroughly and more tenderly than he’d ever been kisses before--he’d fucking cry if he wasn’t so distracted by Cas’s wandering hand slipping down to--
“Dean,” Cas’s hand falls heavy on Dean’s knee, and he can almost breathe again. “It was the only way, Dean. I had to save you.”
“Still,” and Dean found himself (completely bereft of his own volition) going up to Cas, taking the towel that hung over his shoulder, and drying Cas’s hair. Cas endured his ministrations patiently, lips falling open as if in question. Had they always been so pink? Maybe it was all the sun...Cas was tanned now, bronzy like a cowboy or--
"Cas," he says quietly to himself. Because he's allowed. He's allowed to just say Cas's name. And he's probably allowed to touch him. He could probably just...walk up there and wrap his arms around Cas's waist, lean against his back and--
“Get out, Sammy,” Dean growls from his place in Cas’s arms. Because Cas looks debauched, he looks positively fucking fuckable with kiss-swollen lips and pupils blown wide. Dean is only human, and he’s allowed to touch an angel, he’s allowed to tangle his fingers in his hair, to press closer and feel the hard line of--and Dean tries really hard not to think of Cas’s dick while his brother’s in the room but he’s only a man.
He whispers, “You’re beautiful, Dean.” as he strokes at his hipbones. Dean, who has only been called ‘pretty’ in dive bars and alleys and nameless hook-ups loses language at the earnest compliment. “You are so good, Dean.”
“Well you don’t fucking get to decide shit like that.”  Dean says, and he clenches his jaw tight as he pulls off the road, pulls into a field in the middle of fucking nowhere under all the stars in the sky. He turns off the engine, the moon is so bright he can see Cas’s face as he reaches out. See the way he jolts in surprise, in horror, in made fucking delight as Dean’s hand caresses the curve of his jaw.
“Do you know?” Dean asks, because he can’t say it. It would kill him to say it. He’d rather be tortured in hell for another dozen years before he can say it. And Cas’s breath catches, his beautiful lips parting just so.
He'd call Cas later, once they got back. He let himself think about it, about him, as the pain cracked through him with each breath, with every jolt on the road, despite how carefully Sam was driving.
"What - no, Dean, no, please, keep going, Dean, please-" Dean didn't listen and pulled out of him. Cas felt like he was falling as Dean's weight lifted off him, the bed creaking as he got up, scrambled back along the bed to pull on Dean's arm, to pull him back to bed. Dean staggered for a moment before pulling away. Cas dropped it. He felt the give in Dean's arm, remembered how fragile Dean was compared to him, and dropped it. His cock ached and it hurt, it hurt not to have Dean inside him, fucking him, he needed him back.
"Oh, it's that? I thought you two were trying to – anyway, if you need to go upstairs, you can just pray. Don't try to rip chunks out of heaven!" Dean looked over at Sam who looked like he was having the same thought as Dean was. They probably should have tried praying in the first place, seeing as this was, after all, heaven. Yup, that would have been smarter, even if Cas was ignoring him. Someone else might have picked up the call.
At least they hadn't had to kill one of the guinea pigs for it. Knowing their luck, it probably would have turned out that the one they picked really was someone's pet.
He looked up, saw Dean had his eyes shut, lips parted as Cas swallowed around him. His cock ached seeing him like this. Didn't seem to matter that it was his first time as a human, his heat was guiding him through it. His heat kept that need pressing behind his teeth and cut through any concerns about doing this right. He wanted to keep going, let Dean come right down his throat, but the thought hurt too. It wasn't the right place. He needed to be bred, needed Dean to come in his ass.
"You're teaching him bad habits. Shouldn't you be setting an example, you know, joining the choir invisible? Finally learning to play the harp?" Dean laughed at his own joke, trying to imagine Cas wrangling with a harp, in long flowing white robes and a halo. He couldn't see it. Cas smiled again, probably more at Dean laughing than at the joke itself. He could live with that.
"Oh, here's your problem." A panicked squeak made Dean try to look under the table, only to see nothing but Sam's legs. The hell was under there? "Take it." Despite his concern, he held his hands out, let Sam place something warm and furry into them before he scrambled back up to his feet.
"So I guess I better return you to the kid who's looking for his pig, huh. You'll be happier with him." Dean was sure of that. He'd be happier with Cas too.
"This isn't funny Dean." It'd be sharper if it wasn't tainted with his lust, with how badly he needed this. Without the heat burning through him.
"How else am I supposed to get you up here, you ass? You know, I really expected more from you." The angel vanished with a beat of wings, before Dean could ask who'd been giving her lofty expectations of him.
A glance to his left shoulder confirmed it. A hand print was there, glowing with the same bright intensity as the cracks along his ribs. It matched perfectly, as much as he could look at it directly. Whatever this was inside him was leaking out of his old injuries, old cracks in him that Cas fixed. Why?
It was the usual tingling sensation as Cas' grace pushed into him, checked for any nasty surprises. When Cas lifted his fingers he felt it. Something broke off inside him, a small remnant of someone else lingering. He recognized it as Cas, some fundamental part of him he couldn't usually feel but knew. His palm, cupped against Cas' chin, fingers lying against his cheek, glowed brighter. He swallowed hard and tried to find his voice.
Dean wouldn't approve. It was another betrayal. Dean would want it to have a chance, to let it live as a human, to be more than this, than a weapon for its father. A weapon for Castiel just like Castiel was a weapon for God, just like Dean was a weapon for John Winchester. The Dean in Castiel's head asked him what the fuck he thought was doing. Something important, he told him. This war must be won, and everything must be used to win it. He felt it stir in his grace, curious already about its parents, about the angel already making plans for its future.
It wasn't that different from where Cas was a moment before. Cas didn't notice, didn't even hear Dean cursing as he slashed his palm open and smeared a sigil onto the room's door. It'd work to hold any angel desperate to mate with him long enough before he blasted them away.
He didn't feel the hand on his shoulder like it was burning through his jacket, as it rested on the exact same spot where Cas had last held onto him, either.
"You thought I felt guilty? I did, I do, but not because," the words stuck. Still hard to say it, even now, with Cas looking at him like he was preparing for Dean to break his heart. He was just as stupid as he was, for all his millenniums of experience. "Not because I don't love you back. I didn't realize, didn't think you could - fuck, whatever, it doesn't matter. It's not something you can't have." He managed a smile, in the light of dawning realization on Cas' face, the way he was clutching onto the guinea pig for his support as much as the guinea pig needed him. "You changed me too, Cas."
"Yes, and no." Dean waited for an explanation, hand still resting on Cas' face. Waited until it was clear that Cas wasn't going to explain, even when he raised his eyebrows.
"It's not up to you, Dean. You can't go in there, it's not for humans. It's just for them." It didn't hurt that Cas had taken the time to design a dimension, one that he specifically couldn't access, while he was ignoring him. It didn't hurt at all, so when he ignored Cas offering him a hand to take them both back to his house, Sam taking his other hand without question, he ignored both the hurt on Cas' face and the 'are you fucking kidding me?' look on Sam's. It was not because he was hurt. It was because he hated getting jerked around by angels and getting pulled around from place to place.
"Uh...no." Cas didn't get any further in his failed attempt to explain before the bottom drawer of his desk burst open, and out of it rushed more guinea pigs.
"Yes." It wasn't a sacrifice to say they'd never talk about it. He didn't need that, talk was cheap and Dean had agreed. Dean's agreement would spare him from getting sent back, from losing this war and leading too many to their deaths. There was only one way he could show the deep, endless gratitude he felt.
He nearly flinched off Dean's cock as his fingers wrapped around him. His warm, large hand enveloped him, his other hand pulling him back down onto his dick. Too much, too much with Dean inside him and hand on him, jerking him off. One, two, three strokes and Cas exploded.
The research, the lore and the undercover work (aka asking the neighbors) all led to one conclusion: the source of the guinea pig breach was at Dean's house.
"If we can find the source, then we can stop it." A hunt. A hunt, somehow, right in heaven, for the source of an invasion of guinea pigs. Well, why not? It'd been too long. Peace was nice but it got old. It was time for action. Dean drained the last of the beer from the bottle and slammed it down on the table.
"They'll kill you if you go back?" Cas didn't understand why he was asking but nodded in agreement anyway. Dean looked up at the ceiling, didn't meet his eyes as he exhaled deeply through his nose. "Okay. I'll do it but after this, we are
"Sure." This time it was his hand on Cas' shoulder as Cas' wings beat, pulled him again through place and time.
"You're hurt." His voice was soft, sympathetic beyond measure, and it made his ribs ache even worse. Cas pushed himself out of his chair, made his way up the stairs to him with the determination in his stride that said he wasn't to be put off. Cas reached him, much closer than he needed to check if he was hurt, close enough that if Dean moved their chests would bump.
"I don't care man, I just want them gone." Dean leaned back on the couch, heard the scratching of feet and shut his eyes with a sigh as a guinea pig clambered on top of his head. If he took it off, another one would come up and replace them. It didn't stop the stink eye he gave Sam for laughing at him though.
The first guinea pig was thrilled with the company. Dean was significantly less so as his house became a guinea pig refuge. Even when he'd tried to throw them out, more of them kept appearing.
Cas pulled him in closer, tight in his arms and tucked him in under his chin. A kiss pressed on the top of his head as his eyes fluttered shut against his chest. "Sleep."
It might have been embarrassing, if Cas wasn't so clearly into the lines where his grace healed him. Instead it felt hot, like Cas couldn't get enough of him, even if he was a celestial being and Dean was just some dude. Cas wiped his hands on the sheets, tucked himself away before flopping back down on the bed next to him. When he turned to look at him, Cas was already looking at him. He looked like Dean had shaken his world even though he'd barely touched him. It made Dean dare to think of more, of next time when he'd show Cas a really good time. It was a dangerous thing to think of in his life, but Dean let himself consider it as Cas shifted and buried his face in his neck. His fingers traced a line down Cas' neck, the glow bright against his tanned skin, before pushing back up and burying his fingers in Cas' hair.
