Just like last week, people stare at him and the guy just doesn't give a shit. He holds his door in front of him until his stop, gets off, and heads down the street.
Cas wedged himself between Dean's legs and thrust against him, causing Dean to groan and grip Cas' shirt tighter.
Dean wakes to warmth all along his back, a pleasant weight across his hip, and his phone shrilly ringing from his pants on the floor. He reaches down, extracting the phone, and presses it to his ear.
"I have a science project coming up and I really need to get together with Emma to plan what we're gonna do. I was hoping to go over tomorrow morning." She says.
different. It didn't start in some seedy bar with a shitty pickup line and a blood alcohol level high enough to barely remember the night. It didn't start with a blind date, or a friend of a friend of a friend. It didn't start with beautiful words that turned hateful as time went on.
A half hour or so later, Dean found himself laughing and leaning in more towards Courtney, placing his hand on her arm, or her back. His usual moves.
Cas gave a humorless laugh. "You think I do? You've had a lot more experience with this sort of thing than I have. I just know what feels right. And this" he motioned between them. "This feels right. But if you're not up for it, just tell me now. Please."
Cas knew his heart was beating very hard, and he knew Dean could hear it as his ear was pressed right up against it. But he didn't care. This was amazing. This feeling of closeness that hed wanted from Dean for so long, he was finally getting it.
Dean's face broke out in a grin. "Damn right it is. Come on." He grabbed Cas' hand and pulled him to his room, locking the door behind him.
Dean shivers and smiles, goosebumps raising along his body at the soft touches Cas is pressing into him. "Good morning sunshine." Dean says, voice still rough with sleep.
"Nothing" Cas looked down again. "Theres nothing I can do, except wait for it. I'm not going to leave, or give this up, out of fear."
Cas moved his hips faster, pumping his hand in time with his thrusts. Squeezing his eyes shut, he could feel himself getting closer to the edge, holding himself back. He wanted to make Dean feel good.
They stayed like that for a long time, kissing, exploring with their hands and mouths, and softly rutting against each other.
"What? I was just clarifying for him. If he thought that's what we were doing, I wanted to make it clear we werent" Cas said, not understanding at all why Dean was upset.
Cas can feel tears pricking at his eyes again, but this time for a very different reason. He's speechless. This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for him. "It
their naked bodies are pressed together, Dean's cock sliding against his own, and it feels so fucking good, but he wants so much more.
Cas was just staring at Dean, his heart hammering away in his chest. What the hell was happening. It must be the liquor. He probably passed out and in a minute he'll wake up embarrassed. But Dean's voice continued.
Without thinking, Cas lunged forward, smashing his lips to Dean's. Dean dropped Cas' hands, and wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into his lap, Cas' legs on either side of him.
Dean explains, very briefly, what he uses and what needs done, before Cas interrupts him. "Yes, I've used this a lot. I can look it over and probably have it fixed by tomorrow, if you can be without your laptop for the night."
Dean chuckles out loud this time, and Cas shoots him a grumpy morning glare which just makes him laugh harder.
"I will never regret this." Dean stated, leaning in and pressing a light kiss to Cas' lips. "But we probably should slow down. I dont want to take this too fast."
Cas is jolted awake by knocking. He pushes the blanket off and stands up, rubbing his eyes as he heads to the front door and pulls it open. His eyes are still a little blurred, but he can see Dean standing there on his porch.
"I just want to make sure you know what you're doing. That this isnt just some lust filled fantasy. As much as I'm enjoying this, I dont want you to regret it afterwards."
"Fuck, I want you." Cas says, voice deep and growly, echoing Dean's exact thoughts. Dean kisses him again then pulls away and grabs his phone off the counter. "What're you doing? Cas asks, and he's flushed and breathing hard and Dean needs him so much.
Cas watches him for another minute, and when he says nothing else Cas huffs his annoyance and goes back into the house.
He feels Cas press a light kiss to his lips, his cheeks, eyes, forehead, and back to his lips. "I love you." Cas says. "I love all of you." His lips skim over the bruise on Dean's cheek. "I'm so sorry you got hurt."
Dean looked around his room, thinking 'what do I do?' He noticed the card sitting on his desk, walked over and picked it up. Pulling out his phone, he wrote out a message.
"Amazing." Dean rolled away and stretched. "I don't know what you do, but the last two nights have been the best sleep I think I've ever gotten."
Confused, he nods and moves to the side of the door to slip his shoes on. Once he's outside, Dean heads down the steps and Cas follows him to the driveway. For the first time, Cas notices that Dean's Impala isn't there, instead there's an old truck with a tarp covering the back.
He stares at her and she stares at him, and the longer this goes on the more pissed he gets. "Sign your warning and go home, Mister Winchester" Naomi says, sliding the paper further across the desk.
"You know exactly what I mean. That was weird, between you and Claire's dad. Why?" Emma sits down next to him. "Did you know him, before today?" Ah, leave it to his daughter to just know things she shouldn't. Damn observant child.
The moan he pulls from Dean just spurs him on, and he presses harder, moving his hands to Dean's biceps and gripping tight. He can feel Dean's hands on his hips, pulling him even closer.
Cas settles at the kitchen table, across from Dean and with the girls on either side of him sitting across from each other. He doesn't know if this is better or worse than sitting next to him, because it's already been so hard to keep his eyes to himself today.
Sometimes, every once in a while, there's just a flicker in Cas' eyes, or a look on his face, or a lingering touch that lasts just a little too long, and Dean's almost sure Cas has feelings for him. But then it passes, and Cas never says anything, never makes any other indication he wants something more than what they already have.
"Jesus, Cas." Dean's voice is choked up, and when Cas looks at him he can see the sadness in his eyes. "Fuck, I am so sorry. For everything."
"Hey, you're later than usual." Cas says. After a moment, his smile starts to faulter and he walks around the island until he's standing in front of Dean. "What happened?"
Cas pushed his tongue past Dean's lips into his mouth, exploring every inch of it. He could feel his heart rate pick up again as Dean's body pressed his down into the couch.
When Cas finally pulls up outside the house, he is just very ready to get home and possibly take a nap.
"Come on, man. You've only been here an hour." Dean said. Then, quieter, he added "Please don't go yet."
Cas pulls his phone out of his pocket and sees that it's after midnight, and he has no messages. He'd heard from Dean that morning, but has gotten no response to either of the messages he'd sent throughout the day.
Dean stayed in bed a while longer, but he set the bottle of liquor on the floor and didnt drink from it again.
These are clearly people that know Dean well, and respect his opinion, and Cas is really wondering why Dean would put his neck on the line for him when he's only seen a tiny portion of the work he can do.
"What the hell?!" Dean says, still trying to figure out what's happening. He can see something floating in the corner of his eye, and glances over to see a feather drifting down, landing on his lap. "The fuck?"
Cas grabbed ahold of Dean's shirt and slid it over his head, exposing a wonderful expanse of bare chest. Then he sat up a bit, pulling his own shirt over his head.
She ponders for a few moments, probably trying to come up with the best, most invasive question she can think of. "Did you love him?"
Though that was kind of true, his voice didn't compare to Dean's. And it was embarrassing, getting up there in front of all those people. He'd been considering taking off anyway, as he'd come here to spend time with Dean, and that obviously wasn't happening, so maybe this was as good a time as any.
Benny's watching them as Dean pulls it further on, making room for Cas at the top of the stairs. Dean watches as Cas pulls out his wallet and flashes his bus pass, and Dean's grinning to himself because it's so fucking cute. Cas, the perfect little rule abiding citizen, even while he's bringing a giant old tv onto the bus.
He felt, more than heard, Cas moan at that movement. Dean pulled his hand out from under Cas' shirt, and gripped the bottom of it, quickly pulling it up and over Cas' head.
"Alright, hurry and get your shoes on. And grab a sweater. Oh and grab a blanket for Claire." He's made it to the stairs, and concentrates on making it down them while holding a teenager princess style and not falling and breaking their necks.
Oh, Dean wants to. He wants to go inside and dry off and spend the rest of the evening with Cas in his arms. "I really shouldn't. As much as I want to, if I go inside, I'm not sure I'd be able to control myself." Dean says with a smirk.
Dean's hand made it's way to Cas' thigh again. As he rubbed, it made it's way closer to Cas' already semi hard member.
Cas shakes himself out of his thoughts of the past, and back into the present. It doesn't matter. He's only here for Claire, and once this lunch is over, he never has to see him again. That thought makes his heart ache, but he pushes it down. He doesn't need that in his life again. A second time, he really probably wouldn't recover.
Cas stands up and quickly divests himself of his clothes, grabbing the bottle of lube from his nightstand before climbing back behind Dean and running his hands up the backs of his thighs.
She stares at him for a moment before telling him to take a seat in front of her desk, and once she starts talking Dean can feel his stomach drop.
Nobody stops them on the way in, and they make it upstairs with no problem. The nurse at the desk on her floor asks his name, but let's them pass a minute later telling him to go on in, and that Claire was awake when she checked on her a few minutes ago.
He dares to look at her after it's been silent a moment, and she looks so sad, he doesn't know what to make of it.
." His orgasm crashes through him and he throws his head back into the pillow. It's all consuming, sending flames throughout his entire body, pulses of pleasure like electrical shocks as he spills over their stomachs untouched. Dean is still thrusting into him, and he feels so full clenching around him, and then Dean stiffens, buries his face against Cas' neck and Cas can feel Dean filling him, his hot come covering his insides, marking him, as Dean moans into his skin.
Dean scooted even closer to Cas until he was between his legs. He leaned over, resting his torso and head on Cas' chest.
"Dean, you act like you've forgotten that I've known you for eleven years. I can tell when somethings wrong. What is it?" Cas stated.
He realizes that Dean's saying he hasn't been with a man since himself, and the possessiveness swells bigger in his chest knowing that he's the only man who's ever been inside him. "Jesus Dean" is all he can breathe out, before his lips are attached to Dean's again.
Dean grabbed some clothes and they made their way to the shower room, not bothering to dress first since Sam and Jack were both gone.
Cas is utterly and completely overwhelmed by Dean. Jesus, this is too much for this early in the morning with almost no sleep. Not only is he here, he brought breakfast and coffee, and even had the foresight to bring something light for Claire. He is so amazingly thoughtful, and Cas has definitely not had enough sleep to sort through his feelings.
"Just couldnt sleep. And not all of us go to bed as early as an old man, like you. Couldnt even make it through a movie" Dean responded.
On the morning of the fourth day, Dean woke up with a start, shooting straight up in bed, his heart hammering. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around.
He heard Cas take a deep breath, then said "I would like to take you on a date." Cas looked down, seeming embarrassed.
"Mhmm" Dean responds, finishing what's in his mouth. "This month's books for my shop. The damn numbers aren't adding up and I've been over it five hundred times."
Cas didnt ease up, squeezing and sucking until he'd swallowed every drop Dean gave him. Once he could feel Dean's body relax, he pulled his mouth off, licking his lips.
Cas figited. This talk was heading into dangerous territory. "I see you at work every day." He replied cooly, taking a longer drink.
"Theres nothing to be scared of" Cas whispered. In his head, he knew what it was. He thought hed lost Dean. He finally admitted his feelings, and then he almost lost him, again. But not being able to control his body, that was new to him.
"We're gonna go sit outside. You guys can join us if you want." Emma says, grabbing her bowl and walking away before Dean can say anything. He stumbles after her without a word, skeptical of his daughter's motives.
Cas leaned down to kiss Dean again, pulling his shirt up as he did so. He pulled back long enough to yank Dean's shirt over his head, and toss it to the floor, returning to the kiss.
Cas stifled a noise, and gripped Dean's shoulders. "Yes, I see that. But it's a problem for your mind.
Lost in his own thoughts, and desperate to get back to the bunker quickly, Dean didnt notice someone following him until it was too late.
Cas rolls his eyes in true Cas fashion and sighs. "That's not okay, Claire. I shouldn't let you go tomorrow now."
Cas moved his hands, so his left hand was holding both of Dean's wrists above his head. He slid his right hand over Dean's chest, down to the hem of his shirt, teasing at the edge of Dean's pants. Then he slipped his hand up underneath Dean's shirt, rubbing against his bare stomach and chest, as he continued his assault on Dean's mouth.
After Dean had left the room, Cas sat on the couch for a while wondering what went wrong. He knew something was wrong, the way Dean had rushed to get away from him. Maybe they had gone too far. Cas had tried to stop it, but with Dean he only had so much willpower.
Finally home with the clock, Cas sets up in his workshop and starts in on it. It's a long process, bringing something back from the dead like this, but Cas loves every minute of it. It's amazing, to watch something transform from broken ruins into something working and beautiful, by his own hands.
Dean pulls Cas' lips back to his, but they're just breathing each other's air now, gasping for breath, and Cas feels himself teetering on the edge, so close. Dean cries out again and a moment later he's spilling over Cas' hand. Cas follows right behind him, biting down on Dean's shoulder as his orgasm pulses through him.
Cas will get caught up in something, per usual, for hours at a time. When he resurfaces, where before there would always be a text from Dean, this week there's been nothing. Cas has initiated most of their contact, and it's really starting to worry him, especially with the no sex thing. He wonders if maybe Dean is going elsewhere. They haven't exactly had the exclusivity discussion, but Cas assumed they were. Now, he just doesn't know.
"I'm so sorry, I just need to check this message." He says. Asa replies that it's no problem, and Cas clicks the message and puts the phone to his ear.
"Yes, well she insists that she can take care of herself now, so I guess I'm no longer needed." Cas says, but he's smiling a little so Dean knows he's not completely serious.
So, needless to say he's a nervous fucking wreck when he opens the door on Saturday to Claire and Cas standing there. He invites them in, and Emma pops up out of nowhere pulling Claire up to her room with Cas yelling after them to call him immediately if something's wrong.
Pouring lube onto his fingers, he warms it before moving back down Dean's body. Cas looks up at him, and when Dean gives a small nod he circles his rim before adding pressure. He feels Dean tense, and Cas takes his leaking cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head. Dean groans, hips twitching before he relaxes and Cas can dip his finger in.
His bus is empty as he makes his way down the main strip downtown. There's someone sitting on the bus bunch, so Dean pulls up and opens the door. Its Fern Guy (as Dean's been silently calling him for months now, though he's never had another potted plant after that first time).
After a while, Cas climbed back up onto his knees, pulling his spent cock out of him. Looking down into Dean's face, he knew he could never give this up.
Getting lost in his work is nothing new, and he's elbows deep in it when he hears a loud screeching coming from the yard. He jumps up and runs outside, taking in a scene that makes his heart pound and his stomach drop.
Cas rolls his hips, and an unbidden groan escapes Dean when their erections meet. His hands tighten on Cas' hips even more, urging him to do it again, and when he does, pleasure courses through Dean's body.
After a minute of adjustment, Cas sits back a little to look into Dean's eyes, and tears spring to his own as he sees so much love looking back at him. Dean nods, and Cas begins to move slowly at first, then faster as Dean clings to him, begging him for more.
Dean noticed it had gotten very quiet in the room. He turned his head toward Sam and Courtney. They were both staring at him.
He's halfway through his food, doing his best to nod along with whatever Gordon is saying, because he's really not even paying attention at this point, when a new person shows up at their table.
It was so painful to listen to. Finally, the bartender set the shots in front of him and Cas paid, eyeing them warily. This was a bad idea, he knew it was. Cas didn't drink often, and these would definitely push him way far over the line from buzzed to drunk.
Dean can't get any words out, so he makes an agreeable noise, urging their hands to move faster. "So close, don't stop." He finally gets out, the flutter of his orgasm already so close he can taste it.
"I dont need the gruesome details Cas" Sam interrupted, shaking his head, but with a slight glint in his eyes. "I am here if you need me for emotional support though. Dean can be closed off, so if you need to talk about something, I'm happy to listen."
Dean shakes his head, because he's not really that great. He has a storage unit with some of his old pieces in it, and he took Cas there once. Cas had seemed impressed, but Dean figures he's pretty biased.
Cas could feel the tightening in his lower abdomen, and knew he had to slow down or his was about to be over. As he slowed his pace, Dean whimpered. "Can't. Too close Dean." Cas gasped out.
"Dean" Cas says firmly, and Dean stops, turns to Cas with worry written all over his face. "I wanted it. I want it." Cas sighs, running his free hand through his hair. He doesn't want to tell Dean, but he has to. Dean has to know why he's scared. "I... I need to tell you something."
Dean looks at Claire, and she's holding her right side, her face is pale and scrunched up in pain, and she has a flush high on her cheeks. Dean puts his hand on her head and she's burning up. "Oh, sweetheart." He says.
Cas leaned down, kissing Dean's mouth first, then moving along his face, down to his neck. He could feel Dean's hands all over him as he sucked a mark onto Dean's neck.
Sam gestured toward the hall. "Last night. Me and her. I mean, you saw her first. And I know you're with Cas now, but I thought it might be weird for you."
"Excellent guessing." Dean says, unable to look away from Cas' profile. The pink has moved to his neck and ears, and Dean gets the urge to press his lips to it, see if his skin is as warm as it looks. He drags his eyes away after a minute, focusing on the beer.
"Its okay. I got to be happy, even if it was for just a little while." Cas said, wrapping his arms around Dean. "I'm so sorry."
"Man, guess I should've taken longer. Oh well, foods here. I got pizza. Come get it before it gets cold." Sam said as he continued to laugh. He turned around and left, closing the door behind him.
Dean smiled then, and leaned forward, pressing a light kiss to Cas' lips. "You're amazing" he whispered, pulling back.
Everybody who gets off the bus makes a nice comment, all except the man with the scowl, who gives Dean a death glare as he deboards, but Dean smiles politely at him anyway, and continues on his way.
Dean shook his head "so much worse, Sammy." He paused for a few moments, and Sam remained quiet, waiting patiently for Dean to continue.
"There was. Some guys were drunk and harassing a woman, I asked them to leave the bus, and I got punched. There's a police report filed." Dean says confidently. He did nothing wrong here, even the police said so.
At this point, Dean had finished his shower and was about to walk into the war room when he overheard them talking. He stopped, just out of eyeshot, when he heard Cas say the word 'worried'.
Dean pulls back a little to breathe, and Cas latches on to his neck, licking and sucking every available inch of skin, finally tasting Dean. He's wanted this for so long, wondered how Dean's skin would taste, and the real thing is nothing compared to his imagination.
Cas smiled around Dean's cock, pulling back and plunging down again. Dean's mind was reeling 'So fucking good... Cas... How does he... Cas... Fuck... Oh God... Please... Cas... Cas' mouth... Fuck'.
Cas nodded "okay." He was a little sad, hoping to continue what they'd started. But Dean couldnt be cooped up for too long.
"I didnt actually eat it. Supposedly it looks strange if we go out to eat and I dont order anything." Cas said, shrugging.
Dean woke up slowly. With his eyes still closed, he felt around next to him, searching for Cas, but finding nothing.
Suddenly, Dean grabbed the top of Cas' pants and underwear, and pulled them down, freeing his aching shaft. Cas all but whimpered as the cool air hit his hard on, digging his fingers into Dean's back.
Dean stops walking, and stares at Cas' back. Did he just say... "Did you just say she's lunch?" Dean asks incredulously. After everything Cas did to save those stupid chickens.
A shiver of affection warms Dean's body, and he smiles, rolling over a little to press his lips against Cas'. "You wanna shower with me?"
As he stood back up, Cas opened his eyes. Reaching out, Cas took the washcloth from Dean. Adding more soap, he followed Dean's lead and did exactly what he had done for him, pausing at Dean's stomach for a few moments, where, not even an hour earlier, there had been a gaping hole.
Once inside his house, Dean takes a quick shower, because gross bus floor, and changes into sweats then collapses onto the couch. He turns the TV on, and a minute later his phone beeps with a message from an unknown number.
Dean is staring with his mouth open. This is ridiculous, everything has been just fine aside from Gordon's attitude. He opens his mouth to say something, finally, but Benny starts talking.
Cas looked up from his book, at Dean. But Dean, very pointedly, made no acknowledgement that he had done anything different, so Cas went back to his book, extremely aware of Dean's hand on him.
"I dont get out much." She replied, taking a swig from her own glass. "Just needed a night to unwind and forget my troubles"
As he stood outside the bar, looking around, hoping Cas hadnt actually left, he thought to himself 'well what the fuck was I gonna do anyway?' Then he turned around and went back inside.
Pushing his plate away, he looks everywhere but at the man sitting across from him, worried about how much trouble Cas got into because of this asshole.
Dean reach over and pat Cas on the back, smiling. "Yes. Alright Sammy, go pick a movie, and I'll make some popcorn" Dean said jumping up out of his chair.
Shaking his head at the strange situation, Dean pulls the bus out and continues with the rest of his boring Wednesday.
Cas stared at Dean, watching him come undone beneath him. Listening to the most wonderful sounds come out of Dean's mouth. This was better than anything Cas had ever imagined.
Dean shook his head. "You have it all wrong." He then placed his right hand on Cas' upper arm. "I didnt do it just to get you to stay. I wanted to. I've wanted to for a while."
"Just tell me why, then. Why you're insistent on feeling this way every day." Cas asks from right behind him.
"It's nice to officially meet you." Dean says, shaking his hand, and damn it's a nice hand. It's always looked nice, but it feels nice too, warm and big and soft with a few rough calluses.
Dean's pinky brushed against it first, and Cas, unable to control it, sucked in a quick breath, but gave no other reaction to the movement. He reached forward and turned another page.
Once his breathing is back to normal, hopefully it was only a minute or two, Dean grabs the bag, scribbles his cell number on the back of one of his cards, and heads back to the kitchen.
Dean sighs. "It's really personal, but basically after I left he went on a year and a half bender, fucked some chick to try to make himself not gay, and got her pregnant on accident. God, I totally fucked him up."
"Dad, you're the one who's always telling me I can't hide from my problems. This is your problem, and you're hiding. I'm sorry, but you can't teach me to do something you're not willing to do."
"Fuck." Dean says, looking at his watch, realizing the search and rescue took way longer than he thought. "The bus was supposed to be back ten minutes ago. I'm so fucked." Dean mutters, stalking up to the front and picking up the radio. "413 on my way back to the station, be there in five."
Cas doesn't try to close the door again, but he doesn't step back to let Dean in either. He takes a calming breath before trying to say anything. "How did you find me?" His voice is flat, not letting his emotions into them.
Dean sighs contentedly. Waking up wrapped in someone like this is a joy, and he will not let that jerk ruin it. He's just dozing off again when Cas' hand starts rubbing lightly along his stomach, inching downward. Becoming aware of Cas' hard length pressed against his ass, Dean's dick starts to perk up, twitching when Cas' fingers lightly graze the base.
Dean walked over to the edge of the cliff to take one last look, while Cas packed up the blanket and bags. Once they were stored back in the trunk, Cas quietly walked up and stood beside him.
"Don't. Don't you dare say you're a failure or you did the wrong thing." Dean lifts his eyes to Cas' face, the ferocity he sees there taking him aback. "You did exactly what you should've done. You protected someone, and if your job couldn't see that, then fuck them." The curse leaving Cas' mouth startles him a little. Cas isn't one for curses, and Dean knows he's serious if he let one slip out.
Around the corner, Dean attempted to get his breathing under control. 'Its fine. Everything's fine" he kept chanting to himself.
What the fuck? He knows his face is showing his confusion by the look Naomi is giving back to him. "I didn't say anything to anybody, except that I'd get them to where they needed to go as soon as I took her to the hospital." Dean says. He's searching his mind, trying to figure out when the hell he was rude to somebody.
Cas' brain to mouth filter must be broken, because he says "you're just gonna let the whole 'best thing I've put in my mouth' comment slide without a joke? Come on, that's not like you."
Dean took a deep breath. This was it. He was about to get his heart crushed. "I didnt want you to leave."
Cas takes the last few steps around the island and crowds into Dean's space, turning him until they're face to face. He reaches up and places a hand on either side of Dean's face, and Dean closes his eyes.
"Get out!" Dean drunkenly yelled, throwing the empty glass in his hand past Sam's head, shattering it against the wall.
This Wednesday, though. This Wednesday is even less than ordinary. Every passenger is calm and well behaved, there are no arguments or full out fights, no babies crying, and nobody with bad b.o. stinking up his bus. As nice as it is to not have to break up a fight, or to not have to discreetly breathe through his mouth so as to inhale as little of the smell as possibly, it's also
"Okay sweetheart, just stay calm. I'll meet you there, I'm leaving now." Dean starts rushing to his car again.
Dean's staring at him, mouth slightly open in shock. Cas drops his hand back to his side, at a loss of what to do now.
"I didn't know how you felt until I saw the flower, and I should have told you before, but I've been in love with you since the second I saw you. You were standing in the grass outside the science building and the sun was shining behind you, and you were glowing, and I tripped because I couldn't take my eyes off of you. My bag fell and my books were everywhere and you came over and picked them up and handed them to me, and then you smiled and I'd never seen anything so beautiful in my life and I knew. Dean, I'm so fucking in love with you."
"Sure." Dean said, digging his keys out of his pocket and handing them over. Dean climbed into the passenger seat as Cas slid in the driver's side, and started the car.
Dean once again moved his lips from Cas', down to his neck, sucking more small marks as he went. He didn't stop at the neck this time, having access to a whole expanse of beautifully naked skin beneath him. Dean kissed along Cas' collarbone, down to his chest, stopping to suckle on his nipple. As Dean flicked his tongue out over the hard nub, he felt Cas buck beneath him, pressing his cock harder into Dean's hand.
Dean opened his eyes and looked down, watching his hard shaft disappear into Cas' mouth over and over again. He couldnt hold back. With a loud moan of Cas' name, he felt himself let loose, pleasure wracking his body as wave after wave spasmed through him, throwing his head back and closing his eyes again.
"I know Dean. That's why I didnt say them to you. You werent supposed to hear them, I'm sorry." Cas lightly stroked Dean's back.
Dean moved his lips back to Cas', mercilessly shoving his tongue into his mouth, like he didn't need to breathe.
: Oh, earlier I was talking to Bobby Singer over at Singer Salvage and Auto, I worked there for a few years when I first moved back. Apparently he's been looking for someone to do his books too. Says he's getting "too old for that shit" lol. I may have told him about you, and he said to tell you to give him a call or just drop by anytime they're open.
Dean moved his hand slowly, caressing Cas' chest. Cas closes his eyes, his breath quickening with every second. With his eyes still closed, he could feel Dean inching closer, until he felt his breath tickling his face. When he opened his eyes, his entire vision was filled with Dean's face. A face full of complete admiration and desire.
Dates have never been this easy for Dean before. It's like they just connect, flowing easily from one topic to another. Cas makes him laugh, with his deadpanned sarcastic comments, and Cas can't stop smiling at the stupid references and dumb jokes that Dean makes.
It's been almost two months since he and Dean had worked through what happened and finally got together, and it has been amazing. Probably the most amazing couple of months of his life.
"Okay daddy. We're just finishing something up. Can we have like fifteen minutes, please?" She says in her innocent voice.
Like any teenager, Emma likes her sleep, so he knows she must be really unsettled about the whole thing. "'Course Em. Just gimme a minute to wake up." He says, and closes his eyes again. He knows if he doesn't get up, he'll fall back asleep so he rubs his face and pulls himself out of the bed.
While Dean pauses, he knows Sam's thinking this through, can almost hear the wheels turning in his head. "You didn't tell him, did you?"
Cas really needed to stop thinking these things, or the problem in his pants wasnt going to get any better.
Please remember that combating depression is a lot of work, and there is no easy fix it, not even beautiful gay love. If you need help or need someone to talk to, please do. Find a friend, a confidant, or even call a helpline. Whatever you need to get the help you deserve.
Dean deepened the kiss, opening his mouth a little and pressing his tongue against Cas', asking for permission to enter. Cas opened his mouth and accepted Dean's tongue. After a moment, Cas let out a small moaning noise, which caused Dean to pull back, dropping his hands.
"Cas lives here now." After Sam's expected exclamation of "what?!" Dean explains about Cas moving back, and about their daughters, how they've talked a little, and how he ran into him at the coffee shop.
The date is going... alright. It's not bad, not at all, but it's not great either. Asa is nice, funny, a good conversationalist, and he's attractive, so Cas has spent the better part of the date so far trying to figure out what's wrong with him that this doesn't feel right.
Cas crawled up Dean's body, his fingers still deep inside of him, and crushed their mouths back together. He knew Dean was tasting himself on his tongue, and Cas' neglected cock gave a twitch reminding him how unbearably hard he was.
"Sam's my brother. And that's Jack. He's... Well, hes like our kid. Its complicated" Dean said, gesturing to Jack beside Sam.
He's speechless. Surprise and joy overwhelm him, and he's so fucking happy right now he doesn't ever think he'll feel this amazing again.
They sat in silence for a while, eating their food. Dean didnt know what to say. She probably thought they were crazy, but apparently it was a loveable crazy. Dean had no idea how he was gonna get them out of this, but part of him didnt want to. It would be almost nice to have someone who knew.
"You looking amazing" he said, staring at the side of Cas' face. Cas just smiled, and continued driving.
When Cas' phone pings with a message, he pulls back and looks at it. "The car is here." He says, then types something out. "Let me have your number" Cas presses his phone into Dean's hands, and mindlessly Dean enters his number and hands it back. "I'll text you about tonight. That is, if you still want to go?" Cas sounds hesitant again, almost nervous.
Dean straightened up. "I'm sorry Cas. I'm just so... I'm so damn happy." Dean reached out, resting his hand on Cas' waist.
"I did. I can't wait to get started on it." Cas says, pulling his bus card out and flashing it to Dean. Obviously Dean knows he has one, but every time he does it Dean gets a fond smile on his face, and that smile always brightens his day, so he always does it.
Cas is smiling, Dean's smiling, and they're both just standing there smiling at each other for a minute before Cas says "So, I'm just gonna run upstairs. I'll be quick, but make yourself at home."
Dean turned his head and placed a kiss on Cas' temple. When Dean pulled his head back, Cas had the sweetest smile on his face.
Before he knew what he was doing, he reached his left hand over, resting it on Cas' left leg, which was still tucked underneath him.
He knocks before he opens the door, and when they walk in Cas is staring at him with a confused head tilt, and he just smiles as Emma immediately heads over to Claire and climbs up next to her in the bed.
Cas kissed around the lines of his boxers, his thighs, hipbones, then lower stomach. He moved down further, kissing Dean's hard length pressing against his boxers.
Now for the sad part. "There were complications all through the pregnancy, and the delivery was terrible. She, uh... She didn't make it. They saved Claire, but there was no coming back for Amelia. She knew it too, going in. Told me that whatever happened, I needed to be there for Claire. Of course I would be, but I had no idea it was that bad, and I don't know how she knew she wouldn't make it. She just wanted her child to live."
Cas puts his finger on Dean's chin, moving his head back to look at him. "You have nothing to be ashamed of." The vulnerability in Dean's eyes is heart wrenching. "Besides, if you had told me, we could've enjoyed it together."
They've got a movie on and Dean is dozing on the couch when Charlie shows up, but she immediately whisks Emma away for "birthday girl stuff" and Dean is totally fine with that and just keeps dozing until he has to get up to start prep on dinner stuff.
Cas took his time, and by the time he arrived at the bar it was ten past eight. As he entered, he looked around and found Dean sitting, two tables pushed together to accommodate the group of people with him. He had an empty chair on one side, and the art teacher Anna on the other.
Dean's gripping the hem of his shirt, and he pulls away enough to let Dean pull it over his head. He does the same to Dean's, and finally has beautiful skin pressed against his own as they kiss.
They kiss for a while like that, tongues and teeth and hands gripping at each other, and Cas has grown hard again, can feel himself straining against his jeans. He let's himself rest down into Dean's lap, and feels Dean pressing against him. The fear doesn't come this time, only the thrill of knowing he made Dean feel this way, that he's turned him on and Dean wants him.
Dean can hear Cas' voice breaking, and it breaks his heart even more, but he can't see him. He can't. It's too hard and too much and he just needs to stay away.
Cas looks up at Dean with a look of awe, and yeah, Dean feels that too. He doesn't know where she got it, but his kid is fucking amazing and he couldn't be prouder.
"I've gone seventeen long years without you in my life. A day has never gone by that I haven't thought about you, or missed you, or wanted you, and I never want to be without you again. I love you so fucking much. You and Claire are already family, and Emma and I would like to make it official. Cas, will you marry me?" Dean's hand slides into his pocket and pulls out a little black box, and when he opens it Cas sees a silver ring gleaming inside.
"Yes, work. I'm in the middle of that myself." Dean says, gesturing down himself, which gives Cas the perfect excuse to let his eyes scan Dean's body again.
"I guess your worries about Sam not getting her settled were inconsequential." Cas said, looking over at Dean.
Cas closed his eyes as Dean moved the washcloth to his chest, running it over him as the soap lathered across his chest. He felt Dean sliding the washcloth down to his stomach.
Cas is silent while Dean gathers his thoughts, and his courage. "Back then, the day I left, my dad found out about us." He says quietly, not raising his head. "I don't know how he found out, but he did. And when he confronted me, I couldn't deny it. Couldn't deny you. You didn't know how bad it was, before. Nobody did. But, when he found out..."
Cas looked at Sam, then took a long hard look at Dean, his face stoic. "He seems fine, Sam." Then he turned, and started to walk out of the kitchen.
Cas took a few moments before he responded. "Your phone kept beeping. I didn't want it to wake you, so I tried to turn it off." Cas reached over and tossed Dean's cell to him. "Your girlfriend texted. I didnt intend to look, but then I saw my name." He finished angrily.
Dean holds him while he cries, rubbing along his back, and whispering encouraging words into his ear. When someone comes up to the desk behind them, Dean leads Cas over to the chairs and sits down, pulling Cas back against him.
"Oh thank God, I'm starving. That burger yesterday can only hold a girl over for so long" Courtney responded.
Once it was done, he poured 3 mugs, scooping sugar into one. "How do you like your coffee?" He asked Courtney, doing everything but looking at her. It was just too weird.
Finally, they're both gloriously naked, and he has Dean's weight on top of him. He missed this so much, he missed Dean. How could he have ever let them get to the point where they almost weren't an 'us' anymore?
"Alright, that's it. I dont have to sit here and take this." Dean said in fake anger, standing up and downing the rest of his drink. "Come on Cas!"
"Dean." Sam said, looking at Cas then back. "I think you should stay here. Jack and I can handle it."
Dean pulled back, and aggressively attacked Cas' neck, kissing and biting every inch he could reach. Cas tilted his head back against the door, giving Dean more space to explore.
They stepped out, drying themselves, and began to get dressed in the clothes Dean had brought in. A pair of jeans and tshirts for both, and a flannel to throw over top for Dean.
"Seriously, let me talk to him. I'd hate for anything to happen to you, for you to get fired or something, because I have shitty taste in men."
As Cas entered his room and flipped the light on, he noticed something on his bed. Walking over, he set the shirts on his bed, and picked it up. It was clothes. Dean's clothes.
Cas could see Deans eyes widen in surprise. Cas smiled to himself, knowing Dean hadnt expected him to 'fight' back.
Two deep breaths, and as he raises his hand to knock he hears a noise and looks down... at a damn chicken. The chicken is standing at his feet just staring at him. It makes a '
Dean nods. He knows. He knows there was only so much he could've done, but it doesn't hurt any less. "I know." He says quietly.
Once he's showered and dressed, Cas goes to the kitchen and gulps down an entire glass of water, then half of a second, while playing over the events of the evening in his head. Their first kiss, their second kiss, Cas' confession, then their third kiss. The last one makes Cas blush, his body tingling with the memory.
"Okay. Bye then." Dean says quickly, and turns away before he starts tearing up, which is absolutely ridiculous because this was a first date, nothing more. He just read it all so wrong, and it's embarrassing and disheartening and it really kind of hurts.
Pulling his head back, Cas looks into Dean's eyes as he lines himself up and pushes inside slowly, both of them groaning with pleasure. Dean's hot wet heat surrounds him, feels so fucking good he wants to start thrusting, but he holds himself still, giving Dean time to adjust. Dean's clutching at him, fingers digging into his back, and Cas loves it. He wants more.
After several minutes of this sweet intense kiss, Dean slowly pulled back. Cas sighed with his eyes closed, as Dean rested his head in the crook of Cas' neck.
He picks up his phone and shoots his daily reply to Dean, then buries his face in his pillow. The couch isn't the most comfortable thing to sleep on, but at least he can get a few hours here and there, unlike in his bed. The memories of Dean are too strong there, and he tried a total of one time, after that first night, to climb into bed. After several hours, he stumbled back downstairs and has been on the couch since.
: And Ellen Harvelle, at the Roadhouse. I hear she just fired her guy for stealing, so stop in there too. I worked there as well, and Ellen's a hardass but she's really great.
Once they're settled back in bed, Cas pulls Dean to him, pressing his face into Dean's hair and let's a few tears fall. "I love you. I love you and I'm sorry," Cas says quietly.
Dean looked over to Sam's table, where he saw he was eating a salad. So hed actually made this specifically for him. That was nice. Weird, but nice.
Dean threw his head back into the pillows again, this time in pleasure. Searching for anything to hold onto, he grabbed the sheets in his hands.
Cas' scent surrounded him, and Dean inhaled. He was enjoying every moment of this. He knew he couldnt just lay here forever though. Cas had already been laying there long enough, probably bored out of his mind.
Wasting no time, he hands the man the money, lugs the clock up onto his shoulder, and heads out to the nearest bus stop, hoping to have enough time to get started on it before his date tonight.
"Daddy!" Her voice is shrill, and Dean jumps off the couch and is running up the stairs before he even realizes he's moving.
Cas gave a small nod, and Dean reached over Cas, grabbing the remote that was sitting next to his phone on the nightstand. He turned the TV on, then scrolled through netflix until he found something that might interest Cas.
Dean grinned. "Definitely." He said, before digging in and taking a huge bite. He let out a happy noise, which made Cas smile again.
Cas feels an overwhelming amount of gratitude for Dean, and he wants to cry again at how grateful he is that Dean was there. "That's fine, sweetie." He says, because he understands, and actually wishes it were true, though he really really shouldn't.
By Friday, Cas has filled out paperwork with Ellen and already started work for her, and Bobby had said he'll have things ready the next week. He's texted with Dean a few times, all work related, and Dean said his brother should have their paperwork ready the next week as well, but it'll be at least another week before he has any work for Cas.
The ride is nice, though pretty quiet, but once they're settled into their table at the restaurant and their food is ordered, conversation rarely stops.
Cas closes his eyes, gathers his thoughts before opening them again. "I get that being with someone who's inexperienced isn't what you signed up for."
But there's some part of him that's unfulfilled, and it takes a while for him to figure out what it is.
As Dean contracted around him, Cas felt his own orgasm pulling. A couple more thrusts, and Cas was filling Dean up, biting down into Dean's shoulder to muffle his cries. He pushed in a few more times, riding his orgasm out.
Cas texts Dean to update him, in case Emma convinces him to go back to the hospital, then he gets Claire settled on the big couch, gives her full reign of the tv, and lays down on the loveseat to close his eyes for a little while.
Cas just gives a halfhearted twitch of his lips, says "goodbye Dean", turns around and gets into his car. He's driving away before Dean can even move from his spot.
Cas' heartrate picks up, and he feels nervous all of a sudden. Does Dean want kids? They've never talked about it. Is it too soon to talk about it? If it's too soon to ask him to move in, it's probably way too soon to have the children discussion. Or the marriage discussion. Does Dean want to get married? Cas does. What if Dean doesn't? Would Cas be okay with that? What if Dean doesn't want kids?
"Hey, Benny, can you hang on one second?" Dean calls as he sees him reaching to close the door. When Benny nods, they pull the tv the rest of the way down the aisle and he turns to Cas. "So, I'll see you in about twenty minutes or so?"
"I need to tell you something." Cas just stared at him. "Okay. So, when I was collecting the bedding, I looked at my phone and read... her messages. She was just asking how things went between us. I texted her back." Dean finished in a rush. 'Please dont be mad' he thought.
"Can we go sit with her? Please?" Emma asks, and why the hell not? Just leave him here alone with the awkwardness that is his and Cas' current relationship.
Pressing a smile into Dean's neck, Cas let's the warm feeling from those words fill him. "Yes, I'd enjoy that very much" he says, and when Dean looks at him with such fondness in his eyes, Cas knows he's completely done for.
Not two seconds later, the bell over the door rings and there's a presence behind him. He straightens up, and moves to get out of the way when the person speaks.
He looked in the kitchen on his way by, but it was dark and still no Cas. Then he made his way to Cas' room, knowing the whole way that he wasnt going to be there. Dean knocked and slowly opened the door. "Cas?" He said into the dark room. He flipped the light on, and looked around an empty room.
The house is big and cozy, and when he'd bought it he'd always thought it was just perfect for him. But now that Dean's spent so much time there, when he's not around it just seems too big and empty. Too quiet, lacking the jovial spirit and laughter Dean brings.
Dean adjusted himself, crawling up onto his knees to get a better angle, but never letting his lips leave Cas'.
"Got you a new sleeping space." Dean says to the chicken. "You didn't come see me like you usually do when I pulled in." She '
Once again, trying to focus on the task at hand, Cas felt Dean's hand slide up his leg, now resting it at the very top of his thigh. Cas breathed slowly, attempting to control the way his heart sped up. What was Dean doing? His brother was right across the room.
When he let's himself in, the warmth and comfort of home surrounds him, but he doesn't really feel better. He's still angry, and disheartened and just so over his whole job, but he doesn't know what to do.
Dean softly takes the box from his hands, and Cas swipes at his tears. "Alright sweetheart, let's get her inside."
Dean sat there contemplating what Sam had said. He knew he did that, he just didnt realize Sam knew. But of course he did, Sam was an expert on all things Dean.
If he's being honest, he misses Dean. Misses his smile and his laugh, his jokes, his presence, and his stupid beautiful face. And he knows, he
"You know what I mean. Outside of work. We don't hang out like we used to. Did I... do something?" Dean had a concerned look on his face, like he was actually worried he'd upset Cas.
--'oooh washing sheets, that good huh? Tell me what happened as soon as you can. He must be a great guy. Maybe I can meet him sometime.'
Dean makes it to the hospital quickly, and helps the woman off the bus, a nurse rushing outside as soon as she sees them. The woman in labor mumbles a 'thank you' to Dean as she's escorted inside, and Dean feels really good that he got her there in time.
Courtney smiled. "Dont be. Go work it out. And here" she reached into her purse." Call me if you ever need to talk" she said, setting a card into his hand.
Cas sighs and won't look at Dean again, staring behind him. "There's a thing I wanna get. Back there." Cas says, hooking a thumb over his shoulder, and he's blushing now.
Cas sighs and sets down his paintbrush, looking over at Heather nestled atop her blanket at the end of his workbench.
Forcing his eyes away from Dean, he looks around and realizes his daughter is no longer on the porch. Dean, seeing what must be a puzzled look on his face, replies to it. "The girls slipped inside while Charlie was attacking you."
Cas removed his fingers, and positioned himself above Dean, lining up his hard cock with Dean's hole.
Breaking away to breathe, Dean kisses down Cas' jaw to his neck. "Dean, please. Need you. Want you. Please. Please." Cas is begging, babbling, but he can't stop. Breath coming faster, heart racing, fingers tightening in Dean's shirt. "I love you. Love you so much. Please don't leave me. Please don't stop." His brain is fuzzy, his body on fire, and he wants
Dean moved his face down, pressing one more soft kiss to Cas' lips, before sitting back onto his knees.
He cannot, absolutely will not, let that happen. He cannot let Dean's charisma, and charm, and beautiful soul reel him in because he can't handle it. Even if Dean didn't leave again, how can Cas have an honest healthy relationship with him with what happened in their past, with the knowledge that he
Dean reaches out, grabs ahold of Cas, and pulls him until his entire body is on Dean, taking comfort in the solid weight on top of him. Dean tightens his grip, and buries his face in Cas' hair, breathing him in.
Not long later, something occurs to Dean. "Uh, you said 'until we finish building you your own space'" Dean says in confusion.
When Emma opens her gift, she's as delighted as he'd hoped she'd be. It's a 50 inch smart tv, to replace the old one that's probably not even 30 inches that she's had in her room as long as Dean can remember.
"Don't wanna talk about it," Dean replies, heading straight for the hallway to the guest room. Once there, Dean drops his bag on the floor and flops face down onto the bed.
Dean dropped his hand to the bed, and Cas slid his right hand up to grasp Dean's hand in his own, folding their fingers together.
The look of anguish on Dean's face hurts him so much, he just wants to make it go away. "I didn't even ask," Dean says quietly, letting Cas move him closer. "I'm sorry" he says again.
Dean sighs, reaches up and pulls the tarp off. "I made you this I hope you like it." He says quickly, almost too fast for Cas to catch what he'd said.
He's even more nervous as he drives the few blocks home, tulip resting on the passenger seat. Once he's parked, Dean takes a few minutes to gather himself. He can feel his hands shaking, his heart racing, and the nerves creating a swarm of butterflies in his stomach.
"I should've been here as soon as you called." Cas can hear himself say, voice muffled. "I should've... the restaurant was loud and I didn't even know my phone had rung until I got my wallet out. It's no excuse, I should've been here. She was in pain before she left but she said it was cramps and she was fine. I should've made her stay home. I should've known something else was wrong." He's rambling and he doesn't even care because he feels like shit.
"Alright, kid, we'll stay." He says, and she beams at him. "Let me call Charlie, then we'll go find some coffee, alright?"
"Oh sweetheart" Dean says, and there's such kindness in his voice that Cas almost looks up. Dean's hand slides down his cheek until his knuckle is under Cas' chin, and lifts his head until Cas is looking at him. The softness in Dean's eyes makes him melt, makes the fear, the tension in him ebb a little. "It's okay. There's nothing to be ashamed of."
He took his time in the shower, making sure he got all the dirt and grease off his body. He got out, dryed off, and fixed his hair.
"Mhmm thanks Cas." He said, not opening his eyes. Cas chuckled, and Dean opened one eye to look at him. "What?"
Dean watches a fond look cross Cas' face, and after a moment he says "fine, but if you lie to me again..."
"I figured it out after I dropped you off yesterday. The times you disappeared upstairs, leaving us alone. The lying, to get us in the same place. Whenever I'd tell you I wasn't staying, or when Dean didn't come to breakfast with us, you'd look disappointed. The talk, in the hospital." Cas says, and Dean is fucking confused and impressed as hell at both their daughters, and Cas for figuring it out.
Dean looked deep into Cas' eyes. What he said "I need you." What he meant 'I love you'. If he couldnt even say them to himself, how was he ever gonna say them out loud?
After dinner, the rest of their evening is spent on the couch together, watching a movie and throwing snacks back and forth at each other. A typical Friday night in the Winchester house.
Dean pushes down the hurt and sadness and embraces the anger once again. It's not right, Cas not even giving him a chance to fix it. He'd thought Cas loved him, but now it just feels like he was nothing. All for what?
Cas gathers himself, and forces his own smile. "Yes, that's fine. We're happy to have you." He says, and is proud of how steady his voice is.
"Yes, gone. Disappeared. Vanished. Never to be heard from again until this afternoon. Can we drop it now, please." Voice firm, not a request.
Cas rings the doorbell, and as soon as it's opened his entire plan goes to hell. Dean is standing there, and Claire barely says hi before she's pushing past him and up the stairs.
The couch smells like Cas, and he draws comfort from that, letting himself be enveloped by the scent. He really wants Cas, not just his smell, but he's sure he's still out working in his workshop and he doesn't want to interrupt his process, so he takes the comfort where he can.
"I got my shit together after that. She wanted to keep it, even knowing that I could never be with her that way, and I was on board."
Though Claire isn't actually alone, her father's here, Dean completely understands what she means and she's right. He wouldn't leave either.
The drive was nice. Dean's head was fuzzy, but pleasantly so. He had Cas with him, and it was taking everything he had not to reach over and grab at him.
Not hesitating, Cas slid his hand down and gripped Dean's boxers, the only clothes he had left on after last night, and pulled them off, throwing them aside.
Once again Dean tried to pull his hands away, but was unable to as Cas gripped even tighter. He was sure it was going to bruise and he didnt even care.
Castiel stands in his workshop staring at the wrought iron bench he'd picked up the day before. This is a personal project for him, not something he'll be selling or giving away.
Dean has spent his entire shift thinking about telling Cas. Halfway through the day, he decides he's going to do it tonight, before he loses his nerve. It needs to be done, because he can't just move out without saying anything and a small part of him really believes Cas feels the same.
Laying there, watching Cas, Dean felt himself getting nervous. This was all new to him. He didnt know why he wanted it this way, not the other way around, he just knew he did. He wanted to feel all of Cas, every inch of him.
They head out to the hospital, and by the time they get there it's 7:15, both their sandwiches are gone and Dean has finished his coffee and is starting to feel at least partially awake. He grabs the bag, and hopes that the hospital will even let them in, and that Cas won't mind the intrusion, because it's still early as fuck. There's no question whether Cas will be there this early or not, because Dean knows he'd never leave her here alone.
"I'm fine" Cas grumbled, pulling his arm out of Dean's grasp. He started walking toward the stage again, more carefully this time. The room was a little tilted, but really it wasn't as bad as he'd expected after ingesting that much alcohol.
Cas makes a quick sandwich, eating standing up at the kitchen island, before heading upstairs and jumping in the shower. Once he's clean and dressed, he plugs his phone in to charge and crawls into bed, worry still at the forefront of his mind.
"Dean, why are you doing this?" Cas asks, because if Dean is that pissed at him then why is he here?
"Hah no Cas, Dean would never admit to his feelings unless forced. I have eyes. I'm an observant person. And I know my brother very well. Trust me." Sam smiled.
"Ah, now that is the million dollar question." Dean says, and Cas just feels more confused. "It's kind of a long story, but I can give you the condensed version." Dean motions to the kitchen table, and they both take a seat before he starts.
He stops and looks at Cas, and Cas is figiting, shifting around, biting his lip, which Dean has come to notice is a nervous habit of his.
"I'm sure you'll love it" Emma continues to talk. "You could probably just stay once school starts again too. Seriously, it'll be so awesome."
Instead, hes on a trip to the store, that they really didnt even need. Dean just wanted them to have some alone time, away from Sam's interruptions.
." Dean begs, sending more arousal southward, and Cas doesn't think he's ever been this turned on in his life.
Its cathartic, working with wood. He's always felt so. He could get caught up in it for hours, just his body and the machine and the wood. He's sure this is how Cas feels when he's working on a project, and completely understands how he loses track of time.
Once he gets her home, he settles her into her new pen area off to the side of the livingroom. She seems content, nestled down into the blankets, so he finally allows himself to sit down on the couch and rest.
: It's no problem. You're actually doing me a huge favor. I hate hiring people, especially when I don't know if they're good at what they do. So thank you.
Cas can feel some sort of lie in there, but he doesn't push it. He just doesn't have the energy right now.
A third finger was added, as Cas swallowed around Dean. Suddenly, Dean's hand on Cas' head was yanking him off, as Dean's other hand came to squeeze at the base of his cock. Cas looked up, and Dean was panting. "Not yet." He breathed, voice already completely wrecked. "Want you, Cas. Want you so bad."
Charlie pulls back and looks up at him. "Cas, right? I've heard so much about you." He sees Dean throw her a look that he can't decipher, but she just barrels on. "I'm Charlie, and I'm so happy to meet you. Sorry if I embarrassed you, I tend to do that, but I just thought you should know you're hot."
The girls are watching a show, and Cas doesn't realize how much time has passed when Dean's calling them back into the kitchen.
"I'm yours baby. All yours. Only yours. Fuck, Cas. Always." Dean's breathless, body so strong and solid on top of Cas. He's getting close.
As Cas pushes into him again, he wraps his arms around Dean's middle and pulls him up until Dean's in his lap, bouncing on his cock. "Yes. Yes baby, please." Dean moans, grinding his ass down. Dean's hands shoot out to grasp the headboard for leverage, then hes pounding down onto Cas' cock with abandon.
This went on for several minutes, Dean's hand adding more pressure as time went on, until Cas was sure he couldnt get any more turned on. Above the table, Dean continued to flip through the book as if nothing was happening, while Cas was pretty sure he was going to come undone any second.
"He did say that, Sam" Cas chimed in. He still had that pleased look on his face. Dean wanted to ask him what it was about, but he figured that could wait.
Conversation stops for a bit after that while they all eat. When he's almost finished, Claire perks up and looks at him. "Oh, dad. Dean said he's having trouble with some numbers stuff and I told him you're an accountant and you're good at that kind of stuff if he wants some help."
"Damnit, I am so bad at this." He hears behind him before footsteps rush to catch up to him. "Just, hang on." Cas says, falling into step beside him. "Let me explain."
Dean dives in and quickly scoops up the closest chicken, who's apparently caught off guard. He puts his hands around it to settle the wings, then takes it straight to the cage, closing the door behind it.
Dean nodded, and headed for the door. The two made their way to the kitchen, and, once there, Dean set to work making coffee. Cas sat down at the table, watching Dean with an intense stare.
Dean pulled his face back from Cas' and closed his eyes. Fuck this hurts, he thought, but knowing it was Cas' fingers inside of him made his cock twitch.
"So, Emma was telling me about this ice cream place downtown, not far from Uncle Gabe's place. She said they're the best and we have to try it. They even have black tea ice cream, which I know is your favorite."
"Dean, I want" Cas starts, but doesn't even finish before Dean's nodding, because he's sure whatever it is that Cas wants, he wants it too.
He knows it's ridiculous, because she's fine. It was a routine surgery and she's young and healthy and they said it all went perfectly, but he can't help it. He cries until his tears dry up and then he just sits there holding her hand and watching her sleep.
He flips through the stack of papers next to him, and is comparing yet another set of numbers on the screen when Emma and her friend come into the kitchen. The girl has long blonde wavy hair, dressed in mostly black, with thick black liner under her eyes.
The girls don't say anything else about it then, they just keep giving each other looks. Once their plates are empty, Claire clears her throat and looks at them seriously until she has both of their attention.
Cas growled. Watching Dean touch himself, watching himself disappear into Dean's hot wet mouth over and over again, it was too much.
"I-" how does he even begin to explain? The words are stuck in his throat, fear and distress gathered there, leaving him speechless.
"It's hard to back up and take a look at logic when it's your own kid, trust me I know. When Emma had to have her tonsils out, I hovered for a solid month. I'm surprised she didn't murder me in my sleep." Dean says, and okay this is easy, talking about the kids.
The day off is spent completely with Cas. They have breakfast, and cuddle on the couch for a while, then head out to the workshop together. Dean gets lost in the woodworking, Cas in his art, and it's a pleasant afternoon.
He's got music playing, bacon's cooked, fried potatoes done, and he's halfway through the pancake batter when the girls stumble into the kitchen laughing.
When Cas pulls up to the vet, he can see Dean already there, pacing outside the door. He gently slides the box with Lunch inside into his lap before climbing out of the car.
"You're a sick fuck" Dean says, slamming the doors shut and dropping down into his seat. He's shaking he's so mad, adrenaline coursing through him. Dean apologizes to the other passengers, slips his seatbelt on, and pulls the bus back out into traffic. Nobody says anything, but he can see the disgust on some of their faces in the mirror, confusion on others, and grateful glances to Dean in the rest.
Courtney shrugged. "Hes very protective of you. He doesnt like that we're friends, but hes coming around. Softening to me a bit. I can see it in his posture." Dean could feel Cas shift a bit beside him, and Courtney turned her eyes to him.
He has a few passengers on the bus, most of whom are sitting toward the front, save for one guy in the very back. Dean stops at a red light and does his usual scan in the mirror, making sure everything is fine. That's when he sees it.
Dean opens his mouth to say something and is interrupted by a very loud clucking by his feet. He looks down and rolls his eyes again. "What?" He snaps fondly at Lunch.
"Damnit Cas. Just come on" Dean said through the side of his mouth. He had to get out of there before he fell into another laughing fit.
It took about an hour, Cas telling him which roads to take and when to turn. He kept looking at his phone, Dean assumed for directions.
Dean pushes past them in the hall and into his room, grabbing his duffle bag from the top of the closet and shoving clothes into it. He's not even thinking, just knows he can't stay here anymore, especially if those two are back together. He doesn't want to see Cas with
Cas hit that spot one more time, and Dean's cock exploded between them, untouched, streams of white covering Cas' stomach.
Dean gets his knees under him, bringing himself up, and thrusts back against Cas' finger, needy noises coming from his mouth. Cas stills him with his free hand, and presses another finger into him, working him open. By the time he's worked a third finger in, Dean is a babbling mess, "
Dean grabbed the cream from the fridge, pouring some into the third cup and following it with a scoop of sugar.
"Mister Novak?" When Cas nods she continues. "Im Doctor Mills. Lunch is doing okay. We've cleaned her up and given her antibiotics. She was in shock, so we also gave her pain medicine to help with that. She's resting now, but I'd like to keep her overnight just to make sure she doesn't have a reaction to anything."
Cas pulled his head back, looking into Dean's eyes. He was a little concerned he may have crossed the boundary Dean had set.
Cas looked at Dean, studying the way he was laying, then moved to copy his position. Once he was settled, he looked at Dean.
"Just wait" Dean said. He could feel his heart beating faster by the second. His breath quickening. But looking into Cas' hurt face, he knew it was now or never.
He walks down the hall and knocks on Claire's door. "We're leaving in ten to drop that stuff off at the Winchesters."
After several minutes, Cas pulled back slightly, and laid his face into the crook of Dean's neck, his lips pressed against him.
He slowly walked into the bunker, making his way into the war room. No Cas. He walked up the steps to the library and saw Sam sitting at a table with his face in a book.
Cas picked Dean up and threw him onto the bed, knocking the wind out of him. Dean felt Cas climb on top of him, claiming his mouth once again, not letting him catch his breath. Dean's chest was burning with the need for air, but he didnt care. He grabbed Cas's shirt, pulling his body down harder against himself.
Cas buried his head in the crook of Dean's neck as he felt his cum cover his fist. Cas thrust into him a couple more times and felt his cock throb as his load shot out, filling Dean.
With those words, Cas grabbed Dean's ass, hoisted him up, and carried him to the bed. He laid him down on the pillows, climbing between Dean's legs.
Cas crooked his fingers, finding the bundle of nerves and passing over them with each thrust. "Fuck, Cas. Yes. God." Dean was mumbling almost incoherently, his hands in Cas' hair, tugging the strands.
There's a plate set in front of each of them with a burger and what looks like homemade fries that smell like garlic and parmesan, and a platter in the center of the table with burger toppings on it. Cas watches as Dean loads his up with ketchup, onions, and pickles, exactly the same way he ate them in highschool.
Suddenly Cas whipped around, grabbing Dean and shoving him into the closest wall. He grabbed Dean's wrists, holding them above his head.
"You made yourself perfectly clear Dean. I understand. I understand why. I just... I cant be here right now." Cas said soberly.
Stunned, Dean doesn't say anything for a minute, trying to grasp what Cas just said. "You're asking me on a date?"
Cas bites his lip, looks at Dean, then looks forward. "I actually think I'm going to take the bus." Cas says.
"What're you doing to me, Cas?" He laughed, turning towards the door. "Get dressed and I'll meet you in the TV room." Then he was gone, closing the door behind him.
Cas looked right back into Dean's eyes. "Everything I said to Sam was true. But please, dont freak out about it. I know how you feel about that word, and it's not something I want to push on you right now."
When Cas wakes up, he's alone in Dean's bed. Dean's already gone to work, as he'd told him the night before, and he can't help but already miss Dean's presence after spending the last few days basking in it. Cas enjoys a few minutes curled up in Dean's bed, his scent surrounding him, letting himself enjoy it.
When Dean did answer right away, Cas pulled his arm out of Deans' and stood up, stepping away from the bed and grabbing his shirt off the floor. As he put it on, he said "you dont have to pretend on my account. Its fine."
Once Dean got his laughing under control and caught his breath, he leaned back in his chair, watching Sam, who's face was currently in 'bitchface' mode.
Dean squeezed his hand a couple more times, in time with his mouth, and he felt Cas' hot liquid shoot down his throat. He tried to swallow it all, but it was a new sensation for him, and he ended up choking a bit, having to pull his mouth off and let some of it drip onto the bed.
Dean's opening his mouth to say something, anything to make this awkwardness pass, when the vet comes out and approaches them. Cas stands up, and Dean follows behind a second later.
When did his daughter get so observant? He thinks about it for a minute before replying. "There's not. We're friends, and that's it." It actually kind of hurts to say, but it's the truth.
Dean kissed his way back to Cas' hard member, and plunged his mouth back over it. Moving his head up and down, swirling his tongue as he went, Dean squeezed the base. He could feel Cas coming completely undone beneath him. He was now writhing and moaning loudly, unable to catch his breath.
Claire puts the phone to her ear again. "Hey, can I call you back in a few? Alright, thanks. Bye." She says, before ending the call and setting the phone on the bed next to her.
When he looks at Dean, Dean shifts on his feet and nods. "I'm not good at the whole art thing, but I can build. It's not perfect, and it can never compare to what you do, but I wanted you to have something for the girls, other than that shed."
"What are you talking about, Cas?" Dean was worried. The room shook again, and Dean braced himself with the table.
The man in the back is touching himself. His arm is moving in such a way that it's unmistakable. He sees the man's eyes watching a young woman toward the front of the bus, and feels his stomach roll with nausea, head racing with what to do. The light turns green and Dean moves the bus forward, looking for a place to stop. He pulls the bus over, flips the hazards on, and pulls his seatbelt off before stomping down the aisle toward the back.
Cas tilted his head to the side, looking at Dean. "I thought we were past the personal space issue." Dean could hear the airquotes.
Dean looks over at him, and he looks guilty. "I'm sorry. We just wanted to drop something off, but we're leaving now." He puts his hand on Emma's shoulder and is steering her around to the door.
They headed to the garage, and climbed in the car. Dean started her up, then looked at Cas. "Umm, Cas. I dont know where we're going."
Cas took one more step towards him, now just inches away. "Please." It was so quiet Dean almost couldn't hear him over his anxious breaths.
Dean shrugged. "Been sleeping well the last couple of nights." He said, glancing at Cas. "What about you? How did you sleep?" He asked, looking back at Sam, pointedly.
Dean continued to press kisses to the exposed areas of Cas' neck and jaw line, getting rougher as he went. Sticking his tongue out, he licked a strip from his neck to his jaw, making Cas quietly groan.
Not too long after that, the bus pulls up. Dean grabs one end, Cas the other, and they start loading it on. Once it's up the stairs, Dean turns to look at the driver and sees his friend.
With all the willpower he had, Cas managed to break the kiss and pull back enough to look into Dean's eyes. "Dean, you said-".
Dean knows this because he absolutely doesn't ever stare at the guy as he's boarding. He hasn't noticed his shock of dark unruly hair, or his piercing blue eyes, or his large hands with the long nimble fingers as he flashes his bus pass.
Dean pulled back a bit, lifting his body off of Cas slightly. Looking straight into Cas' eyes, Dean moved his hand once again to the top of Cas' pants, but he didnt stop there this time. He slowly moved his hand under the elastic waist of his pants and boxers. He could feel Cas' rough hairs as his hand inched closer to its destination.
Dean laid there, trying to watch the movie, but all he kept thinking about was how close Cas was. How warm the bed was, having someone in it. It had been a long time since he'd shared a bed.
As he walked in, he saw Cas pouring 2 cups of coffee into mugs. Quietly, Dean walked over to him and slid his arms around Cas' waist.
"So much for one minute" he mumbles. "I'm sorry, I was just going to drop Emma off and leave, but she insisted we meet you Charlie. I didn't mean for us to intrude."
Emma sighs. "I was just talking about my new friend Claire. She just moved here, and she's awesome."
He pulls back up at Cas' and stares at the house. The house that's become like home to him in the last several months. The house he thought he'd one day live in.
"Who's going to be there?" Cas asked, he could hear the uncertainty in his own voice. Watching Dean with a date was always the worst, and he wanted to know if tonight was going to be another one of those nights. Dean flirted, all the time, and Cas could handle that. But when it came to watching Dean with his arm around someone, kissing them, Cas just couldn't take that anymore. It caused an ache inside his chest, an intense feeling of hurt, and wanting more, that wasn't right.
"You don't have to do that." Dean says, and can see Cas' face fall minutely. "I don't need the thanks. But, if you'd like to just go out sometime, I'd really like that." He really fucking hopes he's not misreading this situation.
"I'd had enough after that first year, and went to college just to get away. Honestly, the first semester of my freshman year is a haze of too much pot and alcohol." Cas chuckles a little at Dean's look. He was never one for partaking in anything like that back in highschool, and he's sure it surprises him.
A spread of warmth washes through Dean's body at the caring words, the soft tone that Cas said them in. "Wow." Is all he can think to say.
"Well, I'll just say it. This is awkward." Courtney said, stirring her coffee with the spoon Dean had left in it.
Breaking their kiss, Dean's lips make their way down Cas' jaw to his neck, pressing, licking, nibbling the skin there. Cas tilts his head back against the door so Dean has better access and can feel himself growing harder in his pants. Dean rolls his hips against him, pressing his own hardness against Cas', and a moan escapes Cas' throat unbidden, as a sudden shock of pleasure and terror races through him.
Karaoke started, a few people went up first, and then Dean was called. Dean looked at Cas, smiling brightly, then winked and headed up on stage. He knew the wink meant nothing, but it never failed to rile up the butterflies in his stomach.
Dean knows why, as the smell of nail polish wafts down the stairs. "School work. Huh?" He asks, smirking at her. She has the smarts to look a little guilty at least. "You'll have to ask Claire's dad, he's the one who's waiting on her."
Cas shrugs. "It's all part of the business. You'll always get people like that. This is not the first, and I'm sure it won't be the last time something like this has happened. I just haven't been on the floor for a while so it threw me." He can feel Cas studying him intently, eyes never leaving Dean's face. "It was very nice of you to come apologize, even though it wasn't your fault."
Running his hand along the side of Cas' face, Dean smiles at him. "More than okay." Cas' hand finds the back of his neck, and he pulls Dean into a slow and sweet kiss, before wrapping his arms around him, and Dean settles down, head pillowed on Cas' chest, content.
Cas smiles again, beautiful and shining. "I'd like that too." He opens the door, steps out, and collects his chickens from the back seat. "I'll talk to you soon. Goodbye, Dean." He says, closing the door and walking up the path to the house.
By the time he's loaded up on his bus and is pulling out of the station, he can almost see the dark cloud following him around.
Cas reaches over and grasps Dean's hand, pulling him closer, turning so they're facing each other. He runs his hands up and places them on either side of Dean's face, looking into his eyes as Dean's hands rest on his hips, and Cas can feel a shiver go down his spine.
Lost in his thoughts, he was at the mini mart before he knew it. The lot was empty. He parked Baby in a spot and went inside, grabbing a basket and throwing in random things he knew they probably already had at home.
Cas pressed his body back against Dean's, bringing their lips back together. He started to rub his hard length against Dean's leg as he continued to rub Dean through his pants.
"Well, maybe I could distract you from your distractions." Asa says with a smile, hand sliding across the table to cover Cas'.
"I just went to clean up our stuff from the showers. I thought you'd be asleep for a while." Cas replied, stepping fully into the room and closing the door behind him.
Dean turned towards Cas, reaching his hands out and grasping Cas' wrists, freeing his hands from beneath him.
He sees Cas' fingers, out of the corner of his eye, slide the card off the table. "No, I can text you." He says, as he pockets the card.
He makes it all of ten steps before Cas calls after him and he stops, pressing the heel of his hands into his eyes. He's just ready to go home.
"Definitely! We'll have to get together for a game night or something sometime, it's a blast." She says.
"Come on, dad. Just for a minute, please? Emma's told me all about her, and I really have to meet her. Besides, you'll want to meet her too. She'll be here for Emma's sleepover."
"Take your time." Dean says, because now that he knows he wasn't being blown off, he feels way better and is in no hurry.
He wonders if he and Dean are together now. Things have been so push and pull between them, that even after what happened last night, Cas isn't sure where they stand. He does know he wants to be with Dean, and he's tired of denying himself what he wants. And what he wants is for them to be together.
Cas' arms gave out, and he collapsed on top of Dean, trying to catch his breath. Dean's arms came up around him, holding him tight against him. Cas could feel Dean's lips in his hair, and he smiled against Dean's chest.
Sam, who was in the middle of taking his own drink, spit the liquid out all over the table. "What?!"
Cas bit down on his bottom lip as Dean moved his hand, just a little at a time, over the large bulge that was now in his pants.
"What?" Dean asks, bewildered. "I texted you back, I was just busy and didn't get your message right away. And I'm not seeing anybody else Cas, what the hell?"
He turns to look at Cas as he's unbuckling his seatbelt. Cas hesitates with his hand on the door. "Well, thank you. For the ride, and being so understanding." He says, pulling his bottom lip into his mouth and biting down.
Dean moaned quietly, pushing one hand onto the back of Cas' neck, while the other dug into his hips.
They heard a cough, and pulled apart to look up at Sam, who neither had heard approach. "I guess you're okay now?" He asked.
It's silent for several long beats before Claire cracks. "Okay, okay, I'm sorry! I didn't think you'd let me since we're spending tomorrow together." Claire says, then shoves a bite of ice cream in her mouth. "Oh my god Em, you were right!" She says in delight, mouth still full.
"Deal" she says, enthusiastically, before quickly climbing out of the car and grabbing her bag, no doubt in a hurry to avoid him changing his mind. "Thanks dad!"
He turns back to Cas to say something, but forgets as soon as he takes him in. Cas is soaked through, they both are, and his blue shirt is clinging to his skin, water dripping from his hair down his face, and he's watching Dean with an amazed longing in his eyes. He's fucking beautiful.
He looks around the room, and all the girls are just staring at him with varying levels of concern on their faces. "Alright, I'm taking Claire to the hospital. Charlie, you stay here with the other girls and I'll be back when I can." He says, then turns back to Claire. "Do you think you can walk?" He asks.
Once inside, Cas stayed still for a few minutes. It was excruciating, the need to move his hips almost overtaking his resolve to give Dean time to adjust.
Dean immediately picked up the shot and downed it, setting the glass back down. As soon as Scott poured the second, Dean swallowed it again. After a couple more of these, he let the half full glass sit in front of him and took a pull from his beer.
"Look... I'm sorry. I hope you're not upset. Sam said you were fine, but I wanted to talk to you myself about what happened." She said, shifting nervously on her feet.
Grabbing his keys, wallet and phone already in pocket, Dean heads out the door, settling in Baby and letting her low deep rumble soothe him.
Sam stood up. "I'll work on it. Just... Stop drinking so much." He walked to the door. "And take a damn shower, it reeks in here." With that he left the room and closed the door.
Dean looks to Benny, and Benny quirks an eyebrow at him. "What? You never seen a man with a tv before?" Dean asks in a playful tone.
Dean gives him an unsure look, because, well, he's unsure. Cas looks honest, and upset that Dean's leaving, but it all just seems like an excuse. If it is, though, why is Cas asking him to stay? Fuck, dating is hard. Maybe he should just give it up altogether.
After not nearly enough time, Dean pulled back and looked into Cas' eyes. "Dont leave." Dean sighed. "Just, don't leave." With that, Dean pulled his hand away and walked towards the hallway.
Burying himself back into his blankets, he gives himself twenty minutes to mope and feel bad about himself. Twenty minutes to think of all the reasons Dean cancelled on him, all the things he could've done better, all the reasons his past relationships have failed.
Chickens. The chickens are fine, Cas made sure of it. Yeah, he needs a fence, and had been contemplating calling to see how much it would be to have one installed, but he just hasn't had the energy to do anything about it yet.
He got up, making a stop in the bathroom, before heading to the kitchen to make some much needed coffee.
"Cas" he breathes out, almost a whisper, as he sees recognition, surprise, then hurt flash through Cas' eyes before a mask comes up and covers every emotion.
It's a week before Dean sees Cas again, but they keep in contact. Just texts, back and forth, about their kids, and brothers, and Dean telling Cas what movies to watch, and Cas shooting back with well if you like that then you should read this book. It's really fucking nice, and Dean's all around happy with how things are going.
Cas darted his tongue out, running it along Dean's bottom lip, before shoving it into his mouth. Dean opened his mouth willingly, letting Cas' tongue explore.
"What Sammy? I'm not letting the kid go out there to face this, without me." Dean responded, walking into his room and throwing his duffle on the bed.
Cas shook his head and sat there for a moment, before standing up and turning around. "No, Dean. I didnt leave. But I probably should have." He was angry.
"I didn't, I would never do that. I don't ever want anybody else. I love you so fucking much, you're it for me." Dean says with resolution.
"Oh Beloved, I'm so sorry." Cas says, cupping Dean's face in his hand. "You know you did the right thing, and that's what matters."
Cas moved his lips further down Dean's stomach, kissing along the waistband of his pants. "What do you want?" He asked, his voice low with desire.
Now he heads back home, feeling even worse than before. Dean doesn't want to see him, or listen to his explanation, and Cas can't even blame him. It's his own fault for being so stupid and blind.
When Dean gets home from work later that day, he showers, dresses in comfortable clothes, then calls his brother, which he'd been itching to do since he ran into Cas at the Bean, the informative conversation following that, and Gabriel's audacious poking and prodding at his personal information.
Cas nodded. "I know you dont really care about art" Cas said, as if he was reading Dean's mind. "But I think there is something here you will enjoy."
Dean paces around his apartment for a while, knowing he should put the clothes away or he'll regret it tomorrow, but he's too worked up and it's almost time to leave anyway.
"It isn't what we did Cas. That... That was amazing. I enjoyed every second of it. Its just... Afterward, when you looked at me the way you did, and said the things you said. I just kind of freaked out a little. I promised you I would try not to, and I'm doing my best, but sometimes it creeps in and it scares me."
"It'll be okay." Dean says. "I'll see you soon." He tries to sound truthful, but he has no idea how bad it is. He hangs up, getting into Baby, and driving as quickly as he can.
Not saying a word, he reached his hands out and grasped the hem of Cas' shirt, still covered in his blood, and slowly pulled it over his head. Then he grabbed ahold of his own ruined shirt and discarded it as well.
"You don't have to if you don't want to" Cas says, stepping closer to Dean. "But you love it, and you are so good at it, and I know it would make you happy."
His responses had been coming almost immediately, so when the next one takes a couple of minutes Cas gets a little concerned. He busies himself finishing getting ready for bed, then grabs his phone as he climbs in and sees a couple of messages.
Cas gets up and follows a moment later, because after all of that, being away from Dean is just not an option right now.
Claire turns her body to face him, and he can see a determined look on her face. "Was he mean to you? Did he pick on you? Is it because you're gay? What did he do?" She's shooting off questions, and it's endearing how she wants to protect him from an unknown force from so long ago.
The door opened and Dean stood on the other side. Dean looked out at Cas for a moment before he backed up, letting him into the room. Cas stepped in, and Dean closed the door behind him.
"Everything will be alright. And if it's not, I'll be right here and we'll call you." Dean says in reassurance.
fair for him to judge Dean on something that happened so long ago. He's proven that he's reliable, and he's stable. He has a kid, which means disappearing really isn't much of an option. Cas is sure Dean still feels something for him, and he definitely still feels something for Dean.
Suddenly, a black smoke-like mist began to materialize in front of them. A disembodied voice rumbled through them "Castiel, it is time."
Dean's back is pressed to the door, Cas is pulling at his clothes, and Dean is totally on board. Arms full of six foot of sexy man, Dean pulls him closer, slipping his hands underneath Cas' shirt to feel his warm skin, running his fingers along the tight muscles of his stomach and sides.
Courtney just nodded, smiling. "Well, I like it." She looked at Dean. "I'm glad you guys came. I've been dying to hear what happened after you left the other night."
"Sure!" She said, standing up. She made to grab her plate, but Sam stopped her. "I'll get it" he said.
Forcing himself off the couch, Cas walks down the hall and stops at Dean's room. After a minute of staring into the darkness, he slowly shuffles in, curls up in Dean's bed, surrounded by Dean's scent, and cries until he finally falls asleep.
"Its okay love." Cas whispers, before slowly pulling down the panties enough to expose Dean's hole. Cas takes ahold of both cheeks and parts them, lowering his mouth to lick around his rim. Dean twitches and moans, and Cas licks again, before pushing his tongue past the rim. He works Dean's hole until it's lose and giving, then coats his fingers in lube and presses one in easily.
Dean held himself still, resisting every urge to thrust his hips up. He felt Cas' hands grab ahold of his hips, pulling him closer.
, so close. Close enough to touch. Cas' body thrums with the need to be even closer, the need to pull Dean against him and kiss him and promise to make it better.
Cas shakes his head. Of fucking course it was Gabriel. Who else would it be? Gabriel Can't-Mind-His-Own-Goddamn-Business Novak.
"Oh yeah. I've had my fair share of flings." He replied, turning back to the car and adjusting something under the hood.
Sitting there in the kitchen, taking everything he had not to stare at Dean, at his brilliant green eyes, his freckles, his toned body.
"Teenagers. No matter how hard you try, their natural instincts kick in and everything you've taught them goes out the window."
"Help me, please," Cas finishes, slumping back into the couch, exhausted from the tears and emotions and not sleeping for days.
Dean stopped stroking himself, focused on swallowing everything Cas gave him. He heard the most amazing sound hed ever heard come out of Cas' mouth, making his own dick even harder.
He misses his house. Misses the old creaks in the stairs, the rounded archways, the high ceiling in the foyer. He misses the kitchen, the chipped island counter, dancing around and cooking. He misses his garden, the flowers blooming, the bench where he spent so many summer evenings.
Cas is down on the floor on his knees painting something. He's beautiful, the way the light from the window shines on him, the concentration and determination on his face. Dean soaks in the moments before he has to explain everything. Before he has to relive this awful day all over again.
Cas shook his head "I wasnt intending to invade your privacy, and when I realized who it was, I stopped reading."
As the door begins to shut, Dean's hand reaches out to stop it. "Please Cas, just give me five minutes." He sounds so dejected, so hurt, it takes everything in Cas' power not to let his sympathy overcome him. "Please."
He can see Dean is a little nervous now. "We don't have to do anything, if you don't want to. If it's too fast or whatever" Dean says.
Starting the car, Cas heads out to the hardware store. He picks up what he'll need to make a temporary chicken pen for outside, and stuff to set up an indoor area for Lunch to heal, then heads home.
"Yes" Cas says, reaching out for Dean and pulling him into his arms. He barely registers the squeals coming from their daughters. "Yes, of course." He's crying now, just a few tears, but tears of joy, and Dean's laughing in his arms.
"Jesus, that's good." Dean says once he swallows. Cas looks proud of his success, and that makes Dean even happier. "What is it?"
Courtney tilted her head to the side, almost the way Cas did, but not nearly as cute. "So you're telling me" she leaned forward again. "That you really are an angel. And your father is God. And you're hunting him?"
"Wha... Oh sure thanks" Dean said. He slowly got up from the table, watching Cas meticulously fill each part of the coffee maker, before pushing the start button.
Cas smiles at him, leans in and kisses him. It's soft and sweet, gentle, and Dean soaks it up. When they pull apart, they're both smiling. "Yes, definitely." Cas says.
After a while, Sam set a plate of pancakes and bacon in front of Dean, and Dean just stared at it. "Its real bacon Dean. Eat it. You havent eaten in days."
The word 'Dean' sets off more tears, and they roll down Cas' cheeks as he wipes them away just as quickly as they appear.
Dean just shakes his head. "I'm not sure what part of this is wasting my time. The part where I help you with something you care about? Or the part where I get to spend more time with my gorgeous date? Because either way, it's definitely not a waste."
"I promise, I dont want him in that way. I'd had a rough day, and just needed a distraction. I would never come between two people that clearly love each other. That's why I wanted to meet you, to explain. I hope you understand." Courtney stopped talking, and just watched Cas.
It's Friday, which means it's been a week since the fiasco with the chicken and the vet's office and putting his foot in his mouth. He's not seen Cas, and he's barely spoken to him. Dean did send him a few text those first couple of days, asking how Lunch is doing, and how Cas is doing, and he recieved one and two word replies in return. It was disheartening.
"I am so tired of this Chuck bullshit. Cant we have 2 seconds of a win without being dragged back in?" He growled.
"Yeah, that definitely won't fit in Baby. Bus it is." Dean says as Cas stops next to him. Dean runs his hand over the top of the tv. It really is pretty, old and large, and though he hasn't actually seen Cas' work, it seems like just the kid of thing he'd want to work on based on the things he brought onto the bus.
After a couple of minutes of this torture, Dean started moving his whole hand, very slowly, back and forth on Cas thigh, moving it closer and closer to Cas' now rapidly growing cock with every stroke.
"uuuhhngggh" he heard Cas moan, and felt his hand grab the back of his head lightly. Dean pulled his head back, and sunk it all the way down again, causing Cas to thrust slightly into his mouth.
Dean gave her a look and nod. Most women ordered basically nothing, but he supposed she wasnt trying to impress anyone here.
Dean's hand were clutching his back as he bottomed out, blunt nails digging into his skin, and Cas fucking liked it. The sting, mixed with the pleasure of finally feeling Dean surrounding him. He had to stop, giving Dean time to adjust, afraid that if he moved too soon he'd finish right then.
"Shut up" Dean said, not even looking at Sam. He slid a box of pizza toward himself and set a couple pieces onto his plate.
"You used to trust me. Give me the benefit of the doubt. Now you can barely look at me. My powers are failing, and I've tried to talk to you over and over, and you just dont want to hear it. You dont care. I'm dead to you. You still blame me for Mary."
Dean wants to ask so badly, wants to say 'hey dude, what's with the door? And the plant last week?' But he's a professional damnit, and it's really none of his business. Fern Guy isn't bothering anyone, so Dean just continues on like this is normal.
"That song was for you." Dean replied. He raised his hand up, and tentatively laid it on Cas' chest. "I've been trying to find a way to tell you for years, but I was scared. And then you started avoiding me, and I thought I'd lost the chance. And then you agreed to come out tonight, and I knew I had to do something. Didn't you notice the words were different?"
Making his way into the kitchen, he sees Cas at the stove, stirring something. Cas flips the heat off and turns around, a smile lighting up his face when he sees Dean.
But, he goes. He goes through the motions, and the fake smiles at the passengers, and acts like every second of this isn't slowly killing him inside.
"Hey sweetheart, your dad's here." Dean whispers to her, and Claire squints her eyes open at Cas before closing them again and snuggling back into Dean's side. Dean chuckles quietly, then looks at Cas. "Sorry, they gave her something for the pain and she's kind of out of it." He says.
The drive back to his house is nice, peaceful, just the rumble of Baby's engine filling the space, helping calm Dean's nerves. It's been a long time since he's been with anyone, and he wants so much for this to work.
"Obviously, I wasn't. Now, if you'll excuse me." Cas turns back around and leaves, but not before Dean sees the tear sliding down his cheek.
"But you didnt. You were there for me, like you've always been" Dean said, moving his hands up and down Cas' arms.
"We've been married five years, Dean! Together seven. How can I believe that you've been able to hide this that long and you're not just making it up as a cover for what you did?" Cas says, letting his anger take over again.
"I need him," Cas says, voice broken. He doesn't have any tears left to cry, but his throat still burns with it.
He could feel Cas continue to take off his pants. Once they were off, Cas leaned above him and began to slide the flannel off his shoulders, leaving him in a tshirt and boxers. When he finished with that, he laid back beside Dean and pulled him against himself.
The only person who was a surprise here was Anna, everyone else hung out regularly. That realization made Cas feel even more sick. She was most likely here at Dean's invitation. Cas was stupid to believe Dean hadn't invited a girl, and was resigning himself to a night of heartache and jealous pining. At least there was liquor here.
Dean stood up. "Well, grab a seat man" Dean motioned to the empty chair next to him. "I'll grab you a drink. What do you want?"
"Ah, well, you see... Dean and I have been best friends for about eleven years now, so I kind of know everything. But please don't get upset. For one, he didn't think he'd ever see you again. And two, it took a rare free night and lots and lots of alcohol for him to tell me anything. He doesn't like to talk about it."
Dean reached his hand out and grasped ahold of Cas' hand, turning and leading him into the shower stall.
"Its nothing of import, Dean" Cas replied. He felt Cas' hands on his waist, then a second later he could feel his whole body pressed against him.
"That is because I am being truthful. You should know, being friends with Dean can be dangerous." Cas picked at the burger still sitting untouched on his plate.
The feelings Dean had, he couldnt explain them. When he looked at Cas, he could feel this pulling in his chest. Something hed never felt before.
As he got closer, he could smell fresh brewed coffee. Sam must be up already, he thought to himself.
She looked at Cas. "I'll have the same." Cas did this a lot. He didnt eat, but if they were having dinner with someone else he would order whatever Dean ordered, and nibble on it throughout the evening. Then Dean would end up eating it as a midnight snack later.
Leading him around to the bed of the truck, Dean stops and looks at Cas. "I'm really sorry I cancelled. I just" he glances at the tarp, then back. "I wanted to get this done before I saw you. I thought it would be finished by last night, but it took longer than I thought. I spent last night and this morning finishing it, and came over as soon as I got it loaded and showered, because trust me, I needed one."
Cas tilts his head, trying to make sense of Dean's words, and Dean huffs out a humorless laugh. "Yeah, that didn't make any sense." Dean says, running his free hand down his face. "I'm an idiot and I suck at words. I wasn't saying that I'm glad you told me because I don't want you. I'm glad you told me because we can slow down, take our time, as much time as you need. Then, when you're ready, we can take that next step."
In the next second, Cas is in his space, pressing their lips together, and it's everything Dean thought it would be, and more.
Smiling, Dean pulls on Cas' hand, leading him to the couch until they're sitting next to each other, facing each other "Well, kissing is nice." Dean says, a small smirk on his face.
Life isn't perfect. Cas still has setbacks, days where it's a struggle to use a healthier coping mechanism, days where he needs extra encouragement and reminders of how far he's come, and how much better his life is.
"Uh, I'm not sure, I've never been here before. But, based on the proprietor, I'm not sure I'll be returning again." He says, shooting a glare Gabriel's way.
In that moment, Dean wanted nothing more than to leap over that table, and kiss Cas until neither of them could breath. Unfortunately, he heard a noise behind him, and turned around, releasing Cas' hand, to see Sam coming into the room.
Cas adjusted himself until he was, in Dean's opinion, in a more comfortable position. Feet tucked under him, and leaning against the arm of the couch.
When he finally drags himself out of bed, he heads to the kitchen to make some coffee, and sits on the couch, reminiscing about the past couple of days.
"Cas, 's this okay?" Dean asks, and Cas can feel him holding back, hands tight on Cas' hips trying to control himself.
Cas looks up again when Claire makes a happy noise. Mouth still full of food, she says "damn, this is good." Swallows, then says "why don't you ever cook like this?"
Dean began to get cold, and when Cas felt him shiver a bit, he pulled him tighter against himself. "We should probably get dressed." He whispered.
"Well we'll just have to change that. Come on." Dean said smiling, then he walked towards the hallway to his room.
Realizing, if he didnt come out soon, that Cas would come looking for him and find him eavesdropping, Dean took one last calming breath and walked around the corner into the war room.
Enjoying the quiet of the empty bunker, with nothing but their breathing, and the noises Cas was making, Dean didnt want to stop. But he realized how tired he actually was. He felt like he'd had no rest in a week.
"It said it wouldnt take me then. It said..." Cas stared at him desperately, pleading with his eyes for him to understand. "It said it would wait until I was really, truly happy. And then it would take me." He finished.
Or, he could move out, put some distance between them, and hopefully, eventually, move past these feelings. That option isn't likely to happen, as it's been years and his feelings have only grown stronger, deeper with each day that passes.
Dean's stomach growled at the thought of food. "Yeah, thanks" he said. Sam nodded and walked out of the room.
They all ate in silence for several minutes, before Cas said "Dean I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything."
"Yes, Cas, yes. Baby, please, harder." Dean says, grabbing onto any part of Cas he can reach, so Cas thrusts in harder and faster and Dean's back arches, chest pressing against his.
Dean finished what he was doing, closed the hood, and leaned against Baby one more time, before sighing to himself and heading inside.
