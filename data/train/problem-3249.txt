Heat seared through Dean’s sternum and ribs, like a lightning striking a tree, carving into the bone.
“You know this is a bad idea, right?” Sam chuckled. “This is the kind of church you said you wanted to

A waitress with name Jean on her tag walked over to Sam. She was short, with a pure white pixie cut and blot of ash on her forehead. She studied him for a second before refilling his cup. “Had a little too much fun in Lafayette? Looks like Jack, Jim and their brother Jose picked a fight with you last night,” she joked.
Sam had always been a man of faith. He had believed in God and angels long before he had actual proof of their existence. He prayed daily and had readily gone to mass with Jess and her family for the precious few Christmases and Easters they had together.
“I know. It just-” Dean paused. “It just feels like I need to find some sort of middle ground Between us. Ya know?”
At the sight of the scars, Jimmy froze. Slowly he reached over and grabbed Dean’s hands, pulling his wrists closer to him.
"I’m just thinking.”
This chapter contains brief references to rape/non-con.

Sam lowered his hand, wiping his nose with his sleeve as discreetly and quickly as possible just before his brother entered the room. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He cleared his throat. “
“The Apocalypse?”
The scars were a sign to Bobby of something he and Dean had already known. That the wounds were a part of him. They always had been. Tears streamed down Bobby’s face, and he wiped them away gruffly with the sleeve of his forearm.
“Jimmy didn’t want to be stuck riding shotgun to an angel for the rest of eternity. You were just another reason to leave.”

The flapping sound once again filled the room.  With it, Castiel vanished.

A minute went by. Then two. Then three. Finally the door opened just wide enough to reveal a man in his late thirties wearing a black shirt with a white collar and a cross around his neck. He stared at Dean with a look of confused recognition.
Castiel nodded. He walked over to the demon, pulling his sword from his sleeve and hovering it above the demon's chest. Just before he thrusted it down, the demon let out a hearty laugh.
As Dean lay there, disorientated and covered in scratches and dirt, he could hear Zachariah yelling at Castiel about rebellions and this being his last time.
Sam shuffled out the side door of an abandoned barn, the gravel kicking up under his boots. In one of his hands was a gallon milk jug. In his other hand was a makeshift funnel made out of the top of a Pepsi bottle.

Aleah shook her head slowly. She watched him in silence as he walked over to the chair and sat down. “Are you gonna take me to Heaven?” Her eyes began to gloss over. She paused, biting her lip. “Can I say goodbye to my mommy and sister first?”
Breathing heavily, Dean stood and made his way into the bathroom where he quickly splashed his face with hot water.  Pressing his hands against his eyes, he mumbled to himself. “I fear no evil, for you are with me. You are my rod. You are my staff...”
“Ya know, for a nun, you’re pretty strong.” Dean winced, pulling his jacket off.
“No you don’t, Dean.” Sam’s words were panicked. “These people are—”
Dean’s eyes moved wildly around the church, looking for her. He sank to his knees, tears streaming down his face. He closed his eyes; he could still smell her sweet perfume, but after a moment that was gone, too, replaced by the smell of roses.

Castiel’s eyes drifted up to the ceiling. “‘And they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.’” There was a profound weight and seriousness to Castiel’s words. His eyes lowered again, locking on Dean. “You’re His Chosen Son, Dean. You’ve

?”  Miriamne paused. “Are you some sort of prophet? A miracle worker?” Wonder didn’t leave her voice.
There was almost nothing Sam could do for Dean. Bobby was too far away and a hospital would ask too many questions. Medical care itself was almost futile beyond keeping the wounds bandaged.
Unlike his wrists, Dean’s hands bore no reminders of the wounds that been inflicted upon them. He had left them and the blood that been caked upon them in Hell, along with every other wound he had suffered. Castiel,
Jesus nodded sheepishly. He left the house, making his way into the large, walled in courtyard.

Dean nodded. “Thanks. I appreciate it.” He watched Susan run her hand over her stomach for a moment. “Is it kicking?” he asked.
Reluctantly, Dean lifted himself up onto the side of his bed and gasped, feeling his pain spike. He hunched over, shaking, wrapping his arms as tightly as possible around his torso. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean noticed bright red blood stains covering the comforter in streaks and blotches. Despite the stitches and the layers of gauze, Dean’s wounds were

But now he’s refusing to follow even the most basic of orders we give him. He’s making scenes in churches and healing whomever he pleases. People that were never supposed to be healed.

Because of your unfortunate preoccupation with the Nazarene, with Dean, with all those mud monkeys,” Uriel hissed. “Once again, you can’t see that getting rid of the Messiah is for Heaven’s benefit.” He started to march down the aisle.
“Yeah,” Sam’s voice shook as he breathed heavily. “Naamah’s one tough demon. She beat Dean up pretty bad.”
Sam bit her again and again, biting harder and more furiously, his teeth digging into her flesh.  Sam listened as her gasps turned into moans. He trailed his fingers down her stomach to the waistline of her jeans. He undid the button and fly, shoving his hand into her panties.
“You’re positive you don’t have any idea what did this?” Sam asked with concern, eyebrow raised, as he finished wrapping the last bit of gauze. “Ghost? Witch? Daeva?
:: In both the gospels of John and Luke, Judas is described as being 'possessed by the devil' at the time of his betrayal of Jesus. In the  Gospel of Judas, a Gnostic text, it is said that he actually betrayed Jesus at Jesus' behest, being the only Apostle who truly understood Jesus' mission.
But Dean remembered them. He always would remember them.
“I get that.”
“Son of God,” Uriel repeated. His tone was biting. “You’re forgetting that

Ruby had been gone for two weeks.
Dean bit his lip, shaking his head with a nervous chuckle. “Puttin’ it like
“Yeah, well.” Dean shrugged, glaring. “I just did.”
“Did you hear them? The Angels?” John whispered, still holding Jesus upright. Awed, his fingers griped Jesus’ shoulders even tighter. “They were speaking of you.”
He pulled the sleeve of his jacket up slightly exposing his right wrist. The scar had become a wound again. Shallow. A small pool of bright fragrant blood bubbling up from it.
Dean cleared his throat. “The menorah looks old.”
God didn’t answer Dean.
Castiel walked over to Dean. “You need to be more careful.”
Dean just stared at the cheese and meat covered pie. He could feel his stomach tightening and turning at very sight and smell of it. Taking a sip from his drink, he slid the box back to Sam. “No thanks, man. I’m good.” He shrugged, turning his gaze away from the pizza.
Mary shook her head. “It’s gone.” Tears formed in her eyes. “Dinah will be humiliated.”
John was already up and getting dressed. “How are the two of you doing this morning?” He smiled as walked over to her, kissing her gently.
“What is this?” Dean’s voice shook, his eyes not moving from Lucifer.
,” she purred as Sam undid the button and fly of her jeans, exposing black panties.
Usually Dean did go unnoticed. Those who were more open to things—psychics, sick people, even hunters—tended to acknowledge him with little more than a smile or implied word. Those who the angels spoke to could almost never pick him out, mostly due to him not fitting with their assumptions of what the Messiah would be. Were it not for the scent of roses or them catching sight of his wounds, most never even noticed him. But when they did, often they would make a scene of it, proclaiming him as Christ returned.
::In stark contract to his portrayal in the gospels, according to both Philo and Josephus, two contemporary Jewish writers, Pontius Pilate was a man who ruled over Judea with an iron fist. He was a man of 'vindictiveness and furious temper' who was insensitive to Jewish sensibilities and would use excessive force to quell uprisings. According to Josephus, he was recalled to Rome by Emperor Tiberius in 36 CE for ordering the brutal massacre of a group of Samaritan pilgrims.
“Odd?” Detective Connolly cocked an eyebrow.
Unable to do anything, Castiel heard Jesus speak words of anger at Zachariah before the clearing erupted into chaos. A knife sliced through the air, followed by a blood curdling scream. A bright light flashed and there were more screams.

With that, Zachariah disappeared.
“Rufus is by himself because he likes being left alone.”
“Whatever. Let’s blow this popsicle stand.”
Dean nodded, taking the glass from her. “Thanks,” he rasped, chugging the water down.
He took the glass of fresh water back over to Dean, setting it down on the nightstand. “You know Dean, I was thinking.” He paused, swallowing hard as he sat down on his bed. “When you’re feeling better… we should take a trip down to New Orleans. See if we can find you a hoodoo priestess or a faith healer. Something.
The man’s daughter stood behind them, leaning against the wall. She was a grown woman, only a few years younger than Jesus. Her long dark hair was worn loose under her richly dyed veil, a sign that she had never been married, and the light scent of jasmine wafted from her. She glanced at Jesus briefly and smiled, warm and inviting.
He spent the rest of the night trying to locate the Apostles, but to no avail. When the sun began to rise, he made his way in the direction of the Antonia Fortress, where the Roman Prefect and garrison in charge of watching over the city was stationed.
Jesus' eyes narrowed as he stared into the man’s face. A horde of grotesque, demonic faces reflected back through it. “There are quite a few of you in there,” he said conversationally. In reality, there were so many Jesus couldn’t even count them.
Bobby stared at Dean, studying him. “You gonna need anything else?” He asked. “A prayer shawl maybe?”
Sam grew quiet. He slowly walked over to the bed, sitting down on the edge of it. His eyes locked on Dean before focusing on the bruises that marred his forehead, the reddish purple stark against his pale face. A long moment passed before Sam spoke again, “So…
Dean was in the woods behind the Novak’s backyard with an ax in his hand, surveying the trees, an endless sea of sugar maple and oak. Finally, he found a pine tree, he walked over to it and grabbed one of the lower branches chopping at the base of the branch with the ax.

“Oh yeah,” Detective Connolly replied, nodding, pulling out his notes. “According to her husband she was at Saint Anthony’s every Sunday at 9:00 AM sharp. She was there every Thursday after work for adoration too. And she was a member of the choir, and had practice every other Wednesday.”

an old Hebrew prayer Castiel had heard spoken many times before. Some were more obvious. The quiet pause Dean took before taking his first sip of coffee, used to silently say a blessing over it.
Castiel nodded. “In reality, the palms can’t support the weight of a body. The Romans crucified through the wrists.” He paused, sitting himself down on Sam’s bed across from Dean. “Your wounds appear the way they do, Dean, because you’re

“No.” Castiel shook his head. “He didn’t.”
“Think we should check on Columbo? See what he’s up to?” Bobby asked.
“Nope. I’m good.” Dean shook his head as he popped the bottle open, taking a swig from it. “You and Sam go relax. Watch the History Channel or somethin’.” Dean waved them off, his mouth full of food. Sam and Bobby made their way into the living room as Dean took a few more bites from the burger and sips from his beer.
“You sure about that?” Bobby squinted at him. “Because from where I’m standing it seems to me like you’re gonna be needed here.”
Sam shoved a ziplock bag containing one of Dean’s t-shirts into the front pocket of his hoodie and knocked.
“Yeah? How do you know?”

Jesus watched him carefully for a second. Slowly, he nodded. “I am. Who might you be?”
Mary quickly glanced down at her belly. “How do you know
Dean hoped it was a good sign. That maybe, against all odds, he was getting better. Another part of him thought it was something more ominous, a last gasp of energy and drive before the inevitable. Dean ignored it while he spent the afternoon tuning up Bobby’s Chevelle. He ignored it still shortly after sunset while he and Bobby sat down for a dinner of burgers and beers.

Hesitantly, Dean made his way over, his eyes locked on the shot glass. A deep breath left his mouth as he took it into his hands. “Well…
“Yeah.” Sam nodded, clearing his throat. “They’re also known as the Five Sacred Wounds.” His shoulders hunched slightly.
Mary stiffened. “No.” She stared at Jesus, her eyes wide with shock. “How could you do this?”  She quickly turned, running outside into the walled courtyard.
Quickly, he turned around, stumbling away from the rock bluff. When he was far enough away from the sheer drop, he collapsed to the ground, his knees digging into the sand. Jesus ripped his headscarf off, pulling the fringed shawl draped around his shoulders up over his head.
On what Dean could only assume was the seventh day, Alastair returned.
Sam’s expression hardened and he grabbed Ruby by her hair, exposing her neck.“Maybe. But he won’t think very highly of me after I kill him.” He pulled out his knife. In one quick movement, he stabbed Ruby in the neck, piercing her carotid artery.
“Why?” Susan asked, slowly lowering her gun. “What do you have to do with all of this?”
“You’ve lived many times throughout history, Dean. Originally, your soul belonged to Adam. Later, it became the soul of Noah, Isaac, Joshua, Judah Maccabee and then, eventually, Jesus. After he died, it became the soul of the others until, finally, it became yours.  But out of all of them, only you and Jesus have the distinction of bearing The Soul and being The Son.” Castiel paused. “I wasn’t supposed to tell you this, Dean, but you need to know.”
question was loaded with reluctance and fear.
“Is it?” Estelle shot Sam a look. “You know of Saint Francis, don’t you? Francis identified so strongly with Christ’s suffering that the wounds appeared on his body,” Estelle recounted. “The stigmata are just a manifestation of that connection.”
“I tried!“ Castiel retorted, pulling free from James’ grasp. “I can’t stop this!”
Sam squatted down in front of Dean. “You know, rumor has it that you broke the first seal because Alastair hung you on a tree.” He laughed, vicious and mocking. “What was the matter? The cross hit a little too close to home for you?”

“Oh, Dean.” The demons smirked. “You might think you’re something special now that you’ve gotten your Super Mushroom, but you’re about as threatening to us as a baby lamb.”
“That’s not an option.” Castiel shook his head, concern spread across his face. “Heaven
She looked up, gasping at the sight of him. “Jesus?” She stumbled to her feet, running across the courtyard and hugged him tightly. “You’ve returned to me. Thank Hashem.” She cupped his face in her hands, tears welling up in her eyes.
Sam sat there in silence for a moment before he grabbed his jacket off the end of his bed, throwing it on his shoulders as he quickly left the motel room, slamming the door behind him. He marched himself over to Castiel and Uriel, angry tears welling up in his eyes. “
“Can’t or won’t?” Dean asked.

Dean shook his head, roughly wiping away the tears with the back of his hand. He couldn’t meet John’s stern gaze.

Something felt off about them, but Dean couldn’t put his finger on it.
A moment later, he got another text:

“Bring him to Sam. He’ll want to see him.”  Ruby motioned to the two other demons.

“Speaking of which where the hell is Cas? He’s been gone for a while.” Bobby asked.

The waitress awkwardly placed Jimmy’s food on the table. She left without saying a word.
“Yeah? Well I say it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven!” Dean shouted, his fists clenching.
Dean glared at him. “Bobby, I’m not above hitting an old man.”

“Well,” he spat, “if it isn’t the bastard from Nazareth, here in the flesh.”
“Killing Lilith and breaking the final Seal.” Dean said bluntly, grabbing the keys. “ If he does, the world is gonna get fried and it will have me and him to thank for it.”
“Thanks.” Sam took a few bills from his wallet and put them down on the counter before he walked out. He crossed the street, heading back to his motel where the Impala was parked, taking his cell phone back out of his jacket.

“I know.”

Dean focused on details of the prayers, the names of loved ones and their illness, repeating them in his head like a mantra until little crackles of heat began to course through his veins.
he whispered. Leaning closer, he pressed his lips gently against Castiel’s.
“Man, I hate cops,” Dean hissed, sitting up in the pew. “Thanks for getting him off my ass— I mean, uh, butt.” Dean flung his duffle bag over his shoulder and limped his way out of the pew. “Sorry, Sister.” He winced, half stumbling into the aisle.
Jesus didn’t respond, he just walked over to the vats. His eyes slipped shut as he placed his hand against the side of one of them. Heat crackled under his skin, working its way down his arm, into his fingertips, and soaking into the clay. He opened his eyes and pulled his hand away. He gestured towards the jar for James to inspect. Reluctantly, James and Miriamne stepped forward and peered into the jug.

Seeing them. Dean’s heart sank.
Not long after, the men gathered up their belongings and left the inn, heading into the street were they found Simon the Zealot hiding in an alleyway. He shared a few words with Jesus before joining them on their walk to the city gates.
“Need to lay off the Jameson,” Dean mumbled to himself, scanning the bathroom once more. He flicked the light on and off a couple more times. “Shit’s makin’ you paranoid.”
“Zachariah,” he spat. “I had a feeling you had something to do with this.” Dean stepped back surveying the small, dank room. “You’ve got some pretty big cajones showing your face in front of me.”
Dean climbed his way out of the ravine. As he was brushing himself off, he heard soft groans coming from the area of where Castiel's body was.
“Good.”
“Who?” Bobby asked, wiping his brow and fixing his hat.
You can’t even handle a demon, Dean. Ruby thinks—”
“No.” The angel shook his head. “Every Prophet reaches despair at one point or another. The fact that you resisted is victory enough.”
His eyes then focused on the man the soul belonged to: Dean Winchester. A man who thought so little of himself, though he had no cause to. He was a man of great courage, strength, and loyalty, who gave so much of himself and expected nothing in return.
Castiel shook his head. “That’s not at all what I’m saying, Dean.”
Lucifer’s fist thrust into Dean’s chest.
“Shit,” he hissed as the needle slipped out of his blood-caked fingers for the second time in a row.
It didn’t make him feel better.

“How do you feel, Sam?”  Rudy asked, walking over to him, her feet kicking up dirt and gravel.  Sam could barely even see her in the shadow cast by the train bridge underpass the car was parked under, sitting in a large section of road shoulder, her body only visible by the headlights of the lone car that passed by them.
“It’s pine which is soft as hell- real good for carving. It was a cake-walk.” He paused. “You got the cords?”
A third soldier ran over and shoved the other two away, berating them briefly before turning his gaze to Castiel. He looked at him for a moment before calling out. “You!” he yelled in Aramaic. “You get over there and help him carry that.” He walked over to Castiel and grabbed him by his arm. “At the rate he’s going, he’ll be dead before he gets to the damned hill,” Balthazar hissed.
While Bobby made an effort to keep an eye on his line, Dean just held it between his knees, choosing instead to stare out at the lake.

“Praying in your sleep? Yes. I heard it”
Dean paused for a second. “I’m not really much of the prayin’ type,” he admitted, breathing deeply as he walked back over to her. “But, I’ll pray with you.”
“I’ll be fine,” Dean said flatly, looking at his reflection in the Impala’s rearview mirror. “My FBI schtick ain’t
One of the soldiers Dean assumed to be Pontius Pilate. He had been dressed in the uniform of an officer and instead speaking words of detached mockery, he spoke words of embittered amusement and frustration. He also didn’t speak Latin. Instead, he spoke in the same language as the voice, what Dean now knew to be Aramaic. His words flowed with ease and confidence, far better than Dean thought they should since he clearly was not speaking his native tongue. In Pilate’s shadow, lit against the flames of hanging wall torches, Dean swore he could see wings.
Dean smiled. “Thanks, Cas.”
James shook his head. “You were a boy. It wasn’t your fault.”
Jesus glanced at her. “You don't have to do anything. This is my responsibility.”
Dean looked up, his eyes settling on an elderly priest, the one who had the said the mass. He strolled up the main center aisle, slowly, stopping at the pew in front of Dean.
Ruby wrapped her legs around his waist, pressing open-mouthed kisses to the corner of Sam’s mouth.
Dean shook his head. “I’m not gonna argue with that one.”
Anna stopped in her tracks. She paused briefly before she turned to Castiel. “For now, nothing. He’s to do as he’s done for the last two years. Preaching, healing, exorcizing demons, and spending his days with a bunch of surly fishermen.” Anna paused. “But two seals have already been broken and the next full moon hasn’t even come.”

“Though Jesus had faith, he too had his doubts, the same as you.”
Once Jesus was upright, Castiel wrapped his arm tightly around his waist and slowly they began to trudge down the street. He carried the majority of the weight, allowing Jesus to regain his breath.

Susan nodded. She watched him for a moment, and then placed her hands on her stomach. “You said you… made Charlotte better. What did you heal exactly?”
“Of course I know.” Castiel nodded. “I raised you. The wounds are a part of your resurrection.”

“Are you gonna help me here or not?”
Sam quickly ran back into the motel room, grabbing the few things they had already brought in, thankful that they hadn’t settled in yet. He tossed everything haphazardly into the trunk before he jumped into the driver’s seat, his eyes briefly locking on a hunched over Dean, whose hands were pressed firmly against the sides of his head, before he sped out of the parking lot, barreling onto Interstate 29, heading north.
Sorrow washed over him. Deep sorrow. Tears flooded his eyes as he sucked in a deep ragged breath, his eyes fixating on the ceiling.
encounter wasn’t very conductive but-”
“There’s nothing I can do about that, Ima,” Jesus sighed. “I didn’t choose this.”
When the two of them had finished speaking, Dean cleared his throat. “Alright, so I’m
Ruby jerked, pulling away from the touch.
Jesus watched them as long as he could, repeating their destination under his breath long after they disappeared over the hills.
Bobby froze. “The Anima Christi.”
Mary shook her head. “You don’t understand what you’re asking of me.” She wiped the tears from her eyes. “This is too big.”
:: Judah of Gamala, also called Judah of Galilee, was a Jewish leader who led an armed resistance to the census of Quirinius in 6 CE (the same census mentioned in the Gospel of Luke). The revolt was crushed brutally by Rome. Along with Simon of Perea and Simon bar Kokhba, Judah is one of the better known Messiah claimants from the era of Roman occupation.
John vanished.
“No!”
She leaned over the counter. “You wanna talk about it?” she asked.
Tears streamed down Dean’s face as his voice cracked sharply. “I’ll do it. I’ll do it,” he pleaded, “just… take me off this thing.
He didn’t answer it.
Dean stared at his brother for a moment before he waved him off and curled back in his seat. Pulling the hood of the sweatshirt up over his head, he rested it against the cool window and once again shut his eyes. “Whatever, dude.”
“You gotta stop this before—”
Jesus watched Judas leave. After a moment he stood from the table and followed him. Leaving the room, he found Judas sitting on the ledge of the second-floor walkway, his feet dangling over the side and his back against one of the support arches, a goatskin filled with wine in hand.
“That so?” Dean gritted his teeth. “He’ll like it even less when I shank your ass with the demon blade.” Dean pursed his lips, glancing between Ruby and the other two demons. “But since that’s not an option right now,” He cleared his throat. “
“I wanted to think that maybe this was something we actually had a shot at stopping. For once.” Sam took a defeated breath, holding it in before he turned and left the room, closing the door behind him.
“Abba died,” Jesus said. “Suddenly I had to care for seven younger siblings and a grieving mother who was with child. I had too many mouths to feed as it was to worry about adding a wife and however many more would come along.”
Jesus sighed, running his hand over his eyes.
When Dean placed his hand upon Sam’s head, no heat coursed through his body. For the first time since he’d begun healing people, there was no fire. No electricity. Nothing. Just cold and pain. Pain that Dean was sure would have led to his wounds reopening if Sam hadn’t pushed him away.
Susan placed both of her hands over her belly; she stared at Dean for a long moment. “Well,” she said, taking a deep breath as she took hers and Jacob’s guns and put them next to the wall of the foyer. “That stew is
“Jacob, who was that at the door?” Susan, Jacob’s wife, waddled into the living room, one of her hands pressed protectively against her stomach, the large swell making the purple fabric of her sweater tight.
“I am.” Estelle eyed Sam. She smirked. "And you’re a day late, son. All the college kids visited me yesterday.”
The church parishioners did the same. The only ones who ever acknowledged Dean were the children in the daycare room Dean volunteered to watch the following Sunday during mass and even then, they addressed him more with curiosity than awestruck reverence. One little girl named Nicole asked Dean if he could bring her pet gerbil back to life and a little boy named Anthony asked him why he looked nothing like the man in one of the paintings hanging on the wall.
“Sam.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean hissed, running a hand through his hair.
home.”
“Yes Lord.” Bishop Tamsen nodded again. He and Father DeMatteo stood back up, making their way to the front door.
So could Sam.
James cocked an eyebrow. “Does that still happen?”
Sam didn’t say anything.
A lump grew in Bobby’s throat. He put his hand on Sam’s shoulder. “It’s gonna be okay, son.”
“So, let me get this straight...” Bobby shifted in the passenger seat. “You’re the vessel of Michael?”
She nodded at him solemnly, gesturing at them to move.
his soul, not just one or the other.
“Come on.” He took a deep breath as he glanced over at James. “Let’s go.”
“I know I’m his son. The angels called me such when I was in the river.”  Jesus sighed. “But after Michael came to me, I tried to speak to Ima about it. To see if she knew anything. She just began weeping, mumbling something about the Archangel Gabriel.”
They reached Capernaum just before daybreak.
“I’m gonna make myself stronger.” Steel tinged Dean’s words. “And I’m gonna stop this damn Apocalypse before it even begins and I’m gonna fix Sam.”
the water into wine. I saw him.” His voice trembled.
Finally, the punches and strikes ceased. The mocking voices disappeared.The voice and it’s weeping soon followed and Dean found himself hunched over on the floor of the bathroom, his body leaned up against the side of the bathtub. His trembling hands pressed against the sides of his head, trying desperately to claw at the digging wreath to no avail. He could feel it poking into his skin, but there was nothing around his head.
The three of them made their way into the kitchen where they sat down and ate. Even though it had no taste, Dean ate two full bowls of the stew. After dinner, Susan brought Dean into the half-finished nursery. One side of the room was painted bubblegum pink and rabbit themed, stark against the cream colored walls and simple daybed with a quilt on the other side of the room.
“I am sick of listening to you boss me around. I’m sick of listening to you dictating my life with that self-righteous attitude of yours,” Sam hissed, clenching his teeth. “I’m doing
“I do.”
, not nuke the damn planet.”
Only a small gust of wind blew against him, running across his face and through his matted hair and beard.
“If he doesn’t start eating normal or takin’ communion, he will,” Bobby sighed, shaking his head. “But honestly, I don’t know. Some stigmatics survive for decades, some a couple years. Damned if I can figure out why he’s even getting the wounds in the first place. But whatever the reason is, it’s gotta be big.”
But soon other voices came. But these were

As soon as his feet hit the cement floor, he saw it. The door to the panic room was open.
Bobby stood there and listened while Sam trudged up the basement stairs and out of the house, the front door slamming behind him.
Jimmy cleared his throat. “Well, I’m going to take a shower.” He undid his tie, tossing it on to one of the motel beds. “ I haven’t showered in six months. Or changed clothes.” He ripped the trench coat and blazer off, throwing them in a pile with the tie.
“I knew there was somethin’ up the moment I saw you on my porch,” Jacob snapped. “Who are you?”
Nothing happened.
“I’m aware of that, brother.”
“Holy… shit,” Dean’s voice trembled, his eyes wide with shock.
Once all of the Apostles and Jesus’ family had died, they skewed the visions and writings of men they made into prophets even further.  The angels had them write Jesus' mother as a perpetual virgin who never had other children and they turned Judas into a wicked man possessed by Lucifer himself. Sometimes, they had the authors write Jesus as a mystical fountain of secret knowledge, but the version of Jesus that stuck was the man who was God incarnate and who died for the sins of humanity. Something Jesus never truly was and never did.
It wasn’t the service itself that bothered him. The joining of two households under a canopy was a beautiful thing and he always enjoyed the feasts that followed. He loved the music, dancing, food and wine, reveled in them in even.
“Then you know why I won’t let you do this alone.”
The cot was empty.

Silence fell between them.

Sam looked at Dean with scared confusion. "Wh-what?"
“I just— Right now, I just wanna sleep.”
Sam shook his head, a deep sigh leaving his mouth. “
Dean paused, reluctant. “A heart defect.” He gazed at Susan. He watched her eyes grow wide and gloss over. “I kinda…
Bobby scoffed. “You don’t know what your mom is up to?”
Reluctantly, Dean’s eyes drifted down to his hands, turning his palms upwards. They were almost as perfect as the day they clawed their way out of that pine box, unbroken and unblemished. Sporting little more than calluses he quickly regained thanks to shovels and socket wrenches.
Amelia screamed. “No!”
“The whole family’s watching,” James whispered.
“No. I am.” Dean cleared his throat.
Susan nodded. “We will.”
“Jimmy. Who is this?” Amelia said, standing up from the couch.
“Fuck my language, Cas!” Dean spat, taking a step forward. “Why can’t I fix Sam?”
“No. I mean the way you were quoting scripture.” Sam stared at him. “It didn’t…
“Where are you Dean?! I know you’re around here somewhere! I can smell that rosey
When Jesus awoke, he found himself lying on the rocky floor of a cave, covered with a heavy cloak.  It was dark, the oppressive sun replaced by the chill of a cloudless night. Sitting up, he pulled the cloak up around his shoulders and wrapped it around his thin middle.
“Where do you want to go, Dean?” Castiel asked concerned.
Thick, oily blood mixed with water ran down Dean’s side, pooling on the sleeping bag beneath his body. He was quiet and still. Motionless. Breathless. His head slumped against his chest.

Castiel walked over to Jimmy, staring at him. “I
Dean took a single sip before pulling his mouth away.
Dean scoffed, biting his lip.
Dean slammed into the back cell wall, landing on the floor and hitting his shoulder with a thud and a crack. He grunted in pain.
Just before reaching the pulpit, Dean stopped. He planted his feet firmly against the wooden floor, taking a deep breath, and didn’t remove his eyes from the ceiling. “If you want me to stay in here and die, I can do that too.”
Not long after, a war broke out, one that Castiel’s garrison, the one that had protected Jesus, lost.  Some of his rank and file siblings were killed outright. Officers like he and Anna were spared, but recalibrated. Only one, Balthazar, managed to get away. Michael made a decree that no angel could take a vessel and the survivors of the rebellion were to be stationed on Earth, incorporeal and invisible, watching and observing humanity without any way to help them.
They got halfway to the bathroom before they stopped. Dean heard the sound of a heavy thump against the wall.
“You’re not stickin’ around?” Bobby called out to him.
it. We’ve seen it in blizzards and electrical storms. Why, it’s been in the very air for months now.” He paused for a second as a smile spread across his face. “But do we have anything to worry about? No. Because He—Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior—has returned. But he’s come not upon the clouds of Heaven, but as a thief in the night.”
going on with me is awkward for you-”

“But…” Mary’s chest heaved, her voice shaking. “But… how is that even
“No.” Dean’s eyes narrowed. He looked away, taking a sip of the water and gagging on it.
Estelle cocked an eyebrow. “The same brother who is wandering highways healing folks, instead of sitting here with you, trying to find a way remove the wounds from his body?”
it’s Hanukkah.”
Simon cleared his throat. “We hunt all kinds of unholy abominations. Lycans. Shapeshifters. Estries. Dybbuks.”
“We wait.”
As soon as the service ended, Sam and Dean jumped from their seats and started making their way out of the sanctuary, trying to weave themselves through the crowd as they moved briskly down the aisle. They only made it halfway before Dean saw something dart in front of him. His eyes lowered to find the boy standing there, staring up at him in awe and wonder.
She grabbed the stack of tarot cards and placed them in front of Sam. “Focus yourself and shuffle the cards until you’re ready.”
lashes. Alastair counted each and every one of them with glee. When he finally finished, Dean lay in a pool of crimson, slumped against the stake.
“I’m fine. Listen, you gotta get outta here!” Sam winced sharply, panic filling his voice. As she got closer to him, Sam noticed a scent wafting faintly around her, a smell he had gotten all too good at picking up on, the smell of sulfur. His hand was reaching into the pocket of his jeans where Ruby’s knife was just as her eyes flickered black. Before she could do anything, Sam stabbed her in the chest with it.
Opening his eyes, Jesus turned to find an angel wearing a simple wool tunic and head shawl. The sunlight cast a shadow of wings against the rocks, long and thin against the evening sun
digging into my head,” his voice cracked as he made an attempt to yell. “I’m living out Martin Riggs’ version of Easter here. Why the hell didn’t you say anything, Sam?”
Jesus blinked. He looked back and forth between the angel and plate. “Where did you get this?”
The woman’s eyes went wide. She smiled, leaned in, and kissed him on the cheek. “Thank you, Lord,” she said softly.
They were just about ready to pull onto Interstate 84 when Dean suddenly twisted in the seat, shooting Sam an angry look.
. Dean had managed to ignore it while he was in the motel room, but in the closed confines of the Impala, it was getting stronger and more concentrated and he couldn’t ignore it any longer.
that’s happened to you and in a way”—he paused as he swallowed hard—“this could be a good thing.”
person you went to,” Bobby pointed out. “You sold your soul for him, Dean. You’re gonna sit here and tell me you could just up and leave him?” He glanced down to the blood stained bandages around Dean’s wrists. “Especially now?”
The waitress walked back over with a tray of food. “Here we are.”  She was about to put the plate of fries down in front of Jimmy when she stopped, her gaze locked squarely on their hands.
” Mary cocked an eyebrow at him.
With that, James walked into the house. A few minutes later, he returned with a cake, setting it down without a word.
“So you honestly think this is just some weird, Hell induced,

than enough. You’ll be good and roided out for Lilith.”
With that, Castiel placed fingers to Dean’s forehead.
As they made their way down a hall to a side exit, the pastor’s wife ran up to them. “Lord?” she asked with excitement.
Dean’s tired eyes locked hard on Sam. “Sam… if I could deck you in the face right now I fuckin’ would.” There was pained rage in Dean’s voice as he attempted to sit up. “How dare you? You’re the one who said I needed to accept this Messiah thing. To see it as a
“Ima—” James began.
“Chill. I just consecrated him. No biggie.” Gabriel shrugged as he took a couple of steps away from her. “If anybody asks, I wasn’t here, okay?” He turned around, a serious look appearing on his face as he placed his hand gently against her cheek, his eyes locking on her. “Remember, angels are watching over him.”
. I guess that it was.” A somber chuckle left Dean’s mouth as he rubbed his eyes. “At the end of every day, I was given a
“‘My Father’”? Dean’s fists clenched. “
“An angel.” Dean’s voice was blunt. “I’m sure you’ve heard by now that they’re walkin’ the Earth. Maybe you even heard of them speaking to people. Well, they’re here because of me.”
Dean lay there in silence for a while before he pulled the left sleeve of his shirt up, his eyes squinting hard at the mark on his shoulder. He scoffed bitterly. Burying himself under the covers, he curled his shivering body into itself as that terrible aching sorrow once again wrapped itself tight around his heart.
Dean swallowed and nodded. “Of course, mom.”
for Dean get the better of you.”
Castiel watched Dean as he made his way slowly down the side of the road with his thumb out. The street was bustling with cars, but not a single one stopped or slowed down or gave Dean so much as a glance. Soon the sound of feet, light and delicate, walking on the frosty sidewalk filled Castiel’s ears. The steps were followed by the voice of one of his sisters.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “He knew you winged jackasses were going to twist everything after you ganked him. He wanted to make sure there was something of his you
He heard the screams when he was awake the same as when he slept. He heard them at the sight of blood and in the shrill cries of the people he saved during hunts. He heard the screams when he was sober. Sometimes, he even heard them when he was drunk.
Ruby kissed him back with equal force as Sam ripped his coat and flannel shirt off, letting both garments fall to the floor as he carried her over to the bed, dropping her down on top of it. A grin spread across Ruby’s face as Sam straddled her, a deep moan escaping from his lips as he rocked his hips roughly against hers.
” Awkward panic covered Dean’s face. “You don’t gotta do that. I’ll be fine. Trust me.”
“You know it’s quarter after noon, right?” Sam called out, his voice laced with concern as he made his way down Bobby’s front porch, the screen door squeaking and slamming behind him. He set his eyes on Dean who was sitting on the trunk of the Impala, a metal flask in hand.
Castiel said quickly
“You sure ‘bout that, boy?” Tom asked in a thick Oklahoma drawl, cocking an eyebrow. “There ain’t nothin’ out here.”
Seeing the makeshift cross, Dean didn’t scream. He was utterly quiet and still while the demons unlocked the handcuffs and tied him the two by four. It wasn’t until the nail pierced his right hand, breaking bones and tendons, that he screamed.  Not because of the pain, but because of the sound.  The hammer hitting the nail and striking against wood dragged up memories of smoke, sulfur and white eyes. They intermingled with memories of arid heat and a mother’s sobbing.  Memories of terror and sadness, hopelessness, and abandonment.
are you doing in my house?” Mary hissed, glancing at the open nursery door.
And they had. For twenty-nine years, Castiel watched over Dean. Now he had become something else. Logos. Mashiach. Emmanuel. The Alpha and the Omega. The Son of Man. The Son of God.
They found him in a cave just outside the town. Though it was being used as a stable, dark and filled with the stench of animals, it was the only place where his mother and the midwife could get any privacy. The child’s mother was young; a teenager married during the previous summer harvest, little more than a child herself. She named the child Jesus, not as any grand gesture, but simply in honor of the great-uncle whose death marked his birth.
Castiel walked over to it.
“Only their
It was why when Dean first started going to church Sam was confused, but largely unfazed by it. He went along with it as Dean made spur of the moment choices to go to Catholic masses and Methodist church services. Even when it became clear that Dean was planning them, he found amusement at the sight of Dean awkwardly sitting through Baptist sermons and Pentecostal prayer invocations. But when he watched Dean shrug off pastors and parishioners, albeit politely, Sam started to become annoyed. Dean chose to go to the services. He couldn’t reject his “flock” while still trying to observe them.
“Who?” Sam asked, flexing his fingers.
Dean was silent. Without saying a word, he pushed the sleeves of his jacket up and placed his arms on the table, his wrists facing upwards.
He took a deep breath and walked over to the pews.
The title is from

find them?” Dean said, playing absent-mindedly with the zipper of his duffle bag.
Dean shook it. “Thanks.” Dean turned and left the office, leaving the synagogue and going back out the parking lot where the Impala was sitting. Climbing inside the driver's seat and placing his hands on the steering wheel, he let out a deep breath of relief.
Jesus was a prophet, the man Castiel’s father had chosen as the Messiah and Castiel was charged with keeping watch over him.
“The what?”
Dean scoffed as he wiped tears away, shaking his head.
Rufus stopped mid whiskey sip, putting his drink down. “Don’t rat me out, kid.”
what I need to do,” he glared, “so my Father can return.”
Castiel didn’t respond. He looked over to Mary and Miriamne. “You should go back to the city. It’s not safe for any of you here, especially Miriamne. In her condition—”
Dean was silent for a long moment before he finally croaked out, “N— no.” His voice shook as much as his body did.

“A week.”
“You understand it just as well as I do—better in fact,” James argued. “You have a passion for it. You always have.”
will… I don’t know… I sure as hell don’t…” A nervous chuckle left Dean’s mouth as he rubbed the back of his neck.
One by one, the parishioners filed out of the church. As soon they were all gone and the church was empty, Dean lay down on the pew and closed his eyes.
Sam’s eyes went wide; they slowly turned to Dean, a knowing smile spreading across his lips.
A smile spread across Castiel’s face. He lowered himself down to his knees and slid his hand onto Dean’s inner thigh, moving it upwards until he hit the fly of Dean’s jeans. He squeezed his hand around the hard bulge just under the denim of Dean’s jeans.
He contemplated it, considered it even, but he
A barren wreath of thorns was shoved onto Dean’s head and there was more pain. Pain that was sharp, that poked, scratched and itched. It was followed quickly by a blunt strike to the side of his temple and a punch to his jaw. Then another and another as the laughing continued.
“You’re the Second Coming?” Dean’s words echoed through Sam’s ears as he repeated them, his eyes wide with shock. “...of
“Dean will die, Castiel. One way or another,” Uriel hissed, punching Castiel in the face. He pulled his own sword out of his jacket, hovering it just above Castiel’s chest. “I’m almost tempted to let you live. Just so you can watch yourself fail again.”
“Man,
Kneeling in between her thighs, Sam picked up the blade, cutting her once across the labia. He surged forward, licking over her slit. Slick and blood and sulfur mixed on his tongue and his knees buckled. He reached down, stroking his cock in time with the flicks to her clit over and over until both were wet and trembling with need.
“For what?”
“Damn it, Bobby.” He rolled his eyes, shoving the blankets off and throwing his legs over the side of the bed. He stared awkwardly at the shawl before running his hand over the stripes, making his way down to one of the long corner fringes, running its threads slowly through his fingers.
Jesus’ starring gaze drifted down to his shaking hands.
see the world destroyed. This—this is only way I can ensure that it won’t be.”
“Sam don’t—”
“Good. Then let’s get started.”
“Well,” Bobby sighed, holding the bottle up. “Found it. How about we watch some Clint Eastwood movies?”
“We are sheep, Castiel! Our superiors are only following Dean because they’ve been
It almost felt as though she weren’t his anymore.
When he reached the Impala, Dean popped open the trunk, grabbing one of his duffle bags from it. He pulled the contents out of it and replaced them with a first aid kit, a spare pair of jeans, a couple of shirts, a few pairs of socks, and basic toiletries.
“Tell me about it. But the fifty stitches and the tetanus shot in the ass hurt a helluva lot more.”
He quickly shut the water off, making his way out of the bathroom and back over to the bed where Ruby was sitting, a bag of ice against the top of her naked hip. “I’m sorry Ruby. I don’t know why that happened.” He swallowed hard, trying to hide the panic in his voice.
Jesus bit back a smile. “You too?”
“Right. St. Francis was different from Padre Pio and both were totally different from Catherine of Siena,” Sam paused as he aimlessly wrote something down in the notebook. “Is there anything that
With that, Bobby and Dean turned to leave. They took a couple paces before Detective Connolly called out.

“It’s the closest I’ve been to Him in
Jesus shook his head. “Not with Roman legionnaires roaming the countryside. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but men like me—prophets, messiahs—” Jesus paused. “They don’t live long.”
Dean nodded. Quietly, he glanced over to the Stations of the Cross lining the church walls. His gaze lingered on the final one, Jesus being laid in the tomb, before he spoke again. “So.” He took a deep breath. “After Jesus died, what happened? Did his death do anything besides reset the seals?”
For the first time in a week, the knot that rested heavy his stomach was gone.
The demon flinched, smoke began to pool out of his mouth before Sam flicked his fingers, making it surge back into the boy the demon was possessing.
“I’m not sure, but I think so.”
Dean nodded. “You did.”
The mother stood in the threshold of the kitchen, clutching Dean’s beanie in her hand. “Thank you!” She ran over to her daughter and hugged her tightly. She looked up at Dean apologetically. “I’m

Suddenly, the cell was filled with the sound of flapping wings.
They didn’t say anything.
He watched as altar boys rushed to restock the tables behind him with fresh palm leaves for the next mass. Families filtered in slowly from the vestibule, picking up palms as they made their way to the pews their grandfathers probably claimed when the cathedral was built over a hundred years ago.
“Yes, but that won’t do you any good. Not anymore.”
“I’ll explain in the car.” Dean padded Bobby quickly on the shoulder before making his way to the front door.  “Right now, we gotta haul ass.”
“Are you kiddin’ me?” Dean shook his head, scoffing as he placed his duffle bag down on the floor. He glanced around the room. “A roof over my head? Soft, warm bed? Clean sheets? I couldn’t ask for more.
The sand dunes turned into rocky hills and plateaus.  Half a day’s walk down one such plateau, Jesus came across a rock bluff with a sheer drop.  He walked along the edge, standing a few steps behind it. Slowly, he looked down at the sudden drop, into the deep canyon below.
She nodded, removing Dean’s boots. At the sight of Dean’s bloodstained socks, Sister Joan froze. Carefully, she peeled them and the blood-soaked gauze off of Dean’s feet and inspected the wounds.
god,” Simon stated. “The god of our ancestors. Hashem. But there are other gods. Monsters that require human sacrifice.” He gestured over to Judas. “We would know. Our clan's ancestors helped Moses and Aaron kill the gods of Egypt, the Prophet Elijah kill Ba’al and the Maccabees kill Zeus after Antiochus the Wicked forced his worship in The Temple.”
Sam nodded. Without saying a word, he looked around the bathroom. Finally he caught sight of a glass that was resting on top of the sink; he filled it with water before walking back over to Dean. Squatting down, Sam placed the glass to Dean’s lips.
“What do we do now?” Sam asked, crossing Dean’s hands over his lap.
"It was right here the whole time,” James added.
shocking, you going to church willingly or an angel suddenly appearing in front of me."
“Good. What questions did you have?”
.” Susan chuckled. “Would you like to feel?”
Sam nodded. With Sam holding his torso and Bobby holding his feet, they carried Dean down into the basement. They dressed him in some old clothes Bobby had laying around and placed him on top of the cot.
Dean nodded. “Cas said you were a ‘Jesus is my co-pilot’ kinda guy.”
It was suffering Dean never wanted and wasn’t worthy of, but suffering he bore as best he could.
Sam chimed in, “He actually passed away a couple years ago—”
“Really?” Dean winced, sighing.
“It’s a thing in Roman Catholic lore. Sometimes saints when they die their bodies don’t decompose. It’s a sign of their sainthood and it’s used to canonize them, like miracles or apparitions. There’s a ton of examples: Bernadette of Lourdes, Clare of Assisi, Padre Pio. ”
Simon rolled his eyes as he grabbed Jesus by the arms. He dragged him through the crowd and out of the synagogue. “What’s wrong with you? What are you
Warily, Jacob shifted his eyes over to Dean. “Why is she acting—”
“An angel?” Dean’s question was frustrated and disheartened. “

to take you to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, so I guess we’re square.”
Castiel had just begun to make his way down the hill when he saw Mary and James walking up the hill, Miriamne trailing close behind, her heavy stomach making the trek somewhat more difficult for her.
The demon wearing Father DeMatteo nodded. He walked over to Dean, pulling a knife out of his blazer. “How’d you like to be crucified upside down? By the balls.”
Sam’s head was planted on the table in Bobby’s study, a stack of books under him, his eyes closed in a dozing half-sleep. Save for a few hours on Bobby’s couch, he had barely slept.

Castiel’s eyes grew wide. “But that could bring the destruction of the world.” He shook his head. “We can’t ask that of him.”
A bright white light filled the water, engulfing him. Calm and inviting, it broke the silence, filling his ears with the sound of wings, that quickly gave way to high pitched buzzing. He had heard this buzzing from time to time for as long as he could remember. It ached his ears and made his head throb with pain. Now it didn’t hurt him. Now he could perfectly understand it. It was words. The collective voice of Heaven itself.  ‘…
Gritting his teeth, Sam clenched his hand shut, his knuckles turning white and his nails digging into his palm. His heartbeat grew louder, faster. Chaotic. Pain throbbed at the base of his spine.  A single drop of blood fell from his nose.
Sam shot her a look.

Castiel’s hand slipped into the slit of his boxers. The touch and heat of his palm and fingers wrapping around him.
“You gonna be okay?” Dean asked, opening the front door. He set her down onto the ground and she swayed a little before shaking her head. “Do you need someone to drive you home?”
“Because Huntin’ doesn’t require me to be somethin’ I’m not.” Dean jumped off the trunk with a wince, taking a couple of steps as he faced away from Sam. After a moment, he turned around, guilt covering his face. “Because I’m not

The reading gave lead right into the pastor’s sermon. Sam and Dean gave each other wary looks as they watched the older, stout man stand at the pulpit, his voice booming across the sanctuary.
“And that was unusual for her?”  Bobby asked.
“Why do you say that?” Miriamne asked.

“Caire! Get back here!” Amelia ran over, grabbing Claire. She looked at Dean and Jimmy and glared. “You need to leave. Now. Before I call the cops. I don’t know what kind of Jim Jones crap you're pulling with my husband but you’re not going to pull that with our daughter.”
Mary’s face grew serious. “And if you had grown up safe and happy in Lawrence, you would have still ended up here, angel. You have always been the Messiah, and Sammy has always been… your opposite.” Mary pulled the bottle back. When she lifted him up, Dean saw blood trickling down the side of his mouth.
Sam shoved his hands under Dean’s arms, picking him up again and he was back on the frost covered driveway, rapid clouds of breath escaping his mouth.
“Eat.” Rufus insisted.
Jimmy nodded. “I will. Thanks.” He waved before he turned and started making his way up the sidewalk of the house. Dean watched him as he climbed up the steps and walked up to the front door, ringing the bell.
Dean sat in silence for a while, crying with utter abandon, until finally his blurry eyes lifted up to the overcast sky.
Sam kept walking.
“Whatever.”  Dean rolled his eyes as they made their way out of the building and down the steps. “At least we got a confirmation of demons and where there’s demons, there’s Sam. ” As Dean was making his way across the parking lot, a pain began in the back of his head, but quickly moved to his temples. It was dull at first, but then turned throbbing and sharp like a knife. His head spun and his stomach turned.

Castiel pulled the nails out; Dean let out a hoarse moan of pain. “You told me once a long time ago that we always have a choice.” He untied the ropes. Dean fell from the cross and Castiel caught him, throwing him over his shoulders. “You still have one Dean. You can stop this.”
He let out a blood-curdling

“Blasphemy, Dean.” Castiel shot him a look.
He only got to his second sip when Sam walked into the kitchen, heavy bags under his eyes and his hair a rats nest of grease. He was wearing a slept-in pair of wrinkled jeans and a gray hoodie. The same clothes he had worn for the last two days.
When Rufus was done, he handed the cup over to Dean.

She nodded as she scanned him up and down. This time, there was reverence instead of judgment in her eyes. “They told me that I would know you by the smell of roses about you.”
All too quickly, the feeling of serenity was replaced with anxiety, and the comforting warmth became blistering, arid heat. Dean could feel his heart racing, and he broke out into a cold sweat.
Sam placed his hands on Dean’s shoulders, walking him slowly out of the church. “You know Dean, I get that you were having an existential crisis, but it wouldn’t kill you to answer your phone. I tried calling you three times.”
It’s just… Dean’s been sick.”
“You need to stop that. It will alert the other angels to you.”
Dean shrugged. “I’m not hungry.”
Sam and Ruby walked inside, making their way through the musty, spray paint and beer bottle strewn hallways until they came upon a set of tall french doors with a rose window of stained glass just above it.
“Right,” Dean nodded. “Was there anything odd going on in her life lately?”

that his death was ultimately His Father’s Will.”
That night, before going to bed, Dean took the wooden bunny hanging on the inside of the nursery door and carved a devil’s trap into the back of it.
“You gonna eat or are you gonna sit there and pick at your food like a stubborn toddler?” Bobby said through a bite of BLT.
Air flooded into Dean’s lungs, filling his chest so fast it burned with pain. He gasped, his eyes snapping open. He sat up with a jolt. The first thing he noticed was the smell, or rather, the

better than you think I do, trust me. You’re actually handling this better than the first Mary did.” Gabriel smiled. “Speaking of which, I almost forgot.” He quickly scooted behind her. Reaching around, he placed his hand tenderly against the swell of her belly. A white light emanated from his hand, spreading across her stomach.
Sam glared at him. “That’s not funny Dean. We should get the hell outta here.”
“Well, that’s because there really isn’t any official Church dogma on the phenomena.” Father Frati shrugged. “It’s more of a doctrinal footnote than anything. Also, the experience varies from stigmatic to stigmatic.”
“Maybe this is a sign from Hashem-

Sam shook his head with a sigh. "Hopewell, New Jersey. Three hours away. Possible Dullahan.” He took a sip from his coffee. “I'll do the witness questioning to see if it's actually our kind of thing while you rest up in the motel room."
