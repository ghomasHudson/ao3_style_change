Both men were gasping for breath. Lust burning in their loins like molten iron.
"For now." Sherlock's voice was a low rumble and it stirred a warm feeling in John's loin. He tried not to think too hard about what was slowly becoming imminent, but it was a bit difficult with the love of his life standing so close.
His world funneled down into that tenacious heel of hand pressing firmly into the mottled mess of his left subscapularis tendon. Over the puckering, starburst scar that lie just beneath his clavicle, where all his ghosts took shelter.
A once thriving and industrious town; it had since become an occupied ghost town. And all within the last four years.
"So?" Sherlock turned to face out with his strange drink behind him, leaning back on the bar with his elbows, and thrusting his pelvis out a little too invitationally. John found himself leaning closer, feeling the overwhelming need to claim the territory of those hips as his. Just as he had Sherlock's bum earlier.
A terrible pounding fell upon the door then. "High Steward! Open the door! The Captain has an item for me..."
Excitedly, seeing John's eyes linger upon it, Sherlock became animate. Remembering their plans for tonight and bursting with the opportunity to tell him how ingenious he had been.
The heavy door shut behind them as the High Steward left, both of them listening to the terrible scream of the bolt as it slid into place.
They had turned onto Baker Street before either of them spoke again. John feeling satisfied with food and Sherlock contemplating all the information swirling about in his head. He slowed his pace to allow John to walk ahead, to arrive at the flat first. He almost didn't think John would even notice.
John settled himself down into the tall chair and snapped out the creases in his newspaper, glancing only briefly at Sherlock as he came banging into the kitchen from the side door, laden with a medium sized box with the stamped words: 'PROPERTY OF ST. BART'S HOSPITAL - HUMAN TISSUE - DO NOT DELAY' and looking positively thrilled. He set it down on the partner to John's chair and hurriedly gathered supplies.
Oh no. He'd been with Sherlock long enough to know that hesitation at the door was more of a theatrical event than an actual thought occurrence. The chance for a quick escape should the idea not be reciprocated well. He'd been brushing up on his deduction skills. Much to his own chagrin.
"Mhm." John hummed noncommittally, leaning back against the counter and glancing down at his watch. He wasn't about to get started on the solar system again.
"Fudo Myo-o." He muttered. And John blinked up at him, shocked out of his deliberate breathing patterns.
Count to ten. Calm down.
The reaction was immediate. Sherlock bore down hard, coming fully flush with John's lap and burying his face deep in John's neck. He hid what could only be described as a gutteral sob, choking on a lungful of air and John howled inwardly at the intensity of the tightslickwetHEAT that swallowed him up.
"It's a miracle!"
Lestrade eyed Sherlock cautiously before answering. "Tell him there's a head and a body found separated down here. Victim fits the same profile as the others. No identification found in his poncy suit. Same two teeth missing. Residue under the tongue. Blonde. Male. Fit. Late thirties. " He cocked his head, making an educated guess. "Five-foot what? Six? Hard to say without a head..."
"So now you know the truth of it, John. I have been promised to Charles like a trinket. Locked away up here for my own safe keeping. I am not my own man anymore. I am a prisoner in my own castle and I regret to inform you that you have been made my cellmate."
Usually this job would have been stationed by a Gentleman of the Bed Chamber. A personal groom to assist in dressing and bathing and attending the Prince to his every want and whim. But Sherlock's previous Gentleman, Victor Trevor, a man with whom Sherlock had been quite close, had been let go almost immediately after Charles had been placed into power. His position taken over by the High Steward himself.
By now, Sherlock's quiet thing had drained completely, shrunken back into its wrinkled skin as if hiding in  embarrassment. John was actually panting with effort as he finally let Sherlock fall free.
"The Jolly Bulldog."
But no. What if they were not the sort to be bribed? What if they exposed him and he was punished like Sherlock had said?
Sherlock arsed himself enough to tip his head back to see what John was talking about, then gave a dismissive grunt and curled back up. Dull.
John ate and drank by barely lifting his head, but felt marginally better once he was finished. Good enough to follow William out the door at least.
"No. At my birth, perhaps. But not since I can remember."
"About how I knew that you had used pannage to collect them?" Sherlock blundered in. "It was quite simple really, I knew that after you had eliminated the impossibility of entering the woods from the front due to the guards, your path would naturally lead you farther on and you would try to enter through the far edge of the forest. That path, therefor, would lead you right through Diagonese Crossing and given that you're a man of reasonably moderate intelligence, it took you no time at all to realize that the pig farmers had the privilege of letting their swine graze the forest floors in Baskerville for mushrooms and so you used this knowledge to gain access to a wood that would in all other circumstances see you put upon the high pillory."
John couldn't help it. He threw his head back and gave one throaty laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.
"Now I remember why I quit." He wheezed, after the worst of it had dissipated.
Jimmy Page's distinctive voice made John turn the song up. Remembering that Mrs. Hudson had wanted him to listen to Led Zeppelin, he obliged her if only by convenience.
John only glanced up from battling to get his boots on to see William carrying in his armour.
There was a half done figure at the High Steward's shoulder in the portrait. Standing tall and thin like an apparition that was only given form through roughly sketched lines and abstract shapes. But it was the pair of eyes that this wraith had, not yet fully realized but instantly recognizable, that had stayed John's gaze.
"It was so quick." John said hollowly, as if he were absent from his body and the only thing that remained inside him was his story. "I hadn't even realized I'd done it until it was done. I remember the blood hitting my face. It was hot. And thick. And I remember his face, I will always remember his face as he fell. How it twisted. How his blood would not stop coming out no matter how hard he pressed it back with his hands. It's so much different than cutting the throat of an animal...I didn't know...I'd never killed before. It scared me...and in my cowardice I ran. I ran before his body had even hit the ground."
"What about in /your/ bedroom?" John's voice dropped into a furious whisper, his tongue pressing down against his bottom lip.
This shit should be happening to him, not John.
"Are you now?" The backhanded saccharine was almost too much to absorb. "I suppose that's a point I could possibly concede to." He said warmly.
John blinked in half alarm and half amazement, his neck a quick swivel to gape. How did...
"No it can't."
John tipped the rest of his stew into his mouth and set down his empty bowl between his boots, wiping his hands upon his linen shirt, before delicately taking the scroll and breaking the seal with a small hint of trepidation and a large sense of curiosity.
"You could always get naked and get in here with me." Sherlock suggested and then had the audacity to raise a suggestive eyebrow. "Skin-to-skin contact /would/ be the most efficient way to get me warmed back up."
"The back windows were tinted so darkly that it was impossible to see out during the short drive, but tracking each turn the car made, it wasn't hard to figure out that I ended up being taken to Marlborough and the Mall before the car went underground."
Only approaching to snatch up the bread when it was finally tossed a little ways from his hand.
Lots of people talkin', few of them know
p.s. trigger warnings for gardners in this chapter...I apologize profusely to all you green thumbs for this. I REALLY TRULY do. but I wanted to keep this shit weird...
But Sherlock could dwell on none of this, he could only violently suppress the embarrassment at the High Steward's hands around him and do nothing about the sick feeling writhing wildly in his stomach. Should Charles suspect anything between them, his days in John's company would cease abruptly and something very terrible would happen to this good and kindly man.
"What?" John had strained to listen for whatever it was. "I didn't hear anything."
Second rest.
"For all these things to be firm and forever established, we have put the King's seal on this document and it has been signed by my hand. Given here on this day. May the peace and glory of Castle Appledore never die."
Sherlock regarded him for a very long moment. "Sparkling."
Prince Sherlock was more beautiful than John's memories had imagined him.
"I'll not be wearing those today." John said offhandedly, a little breathless as he tried another go at stabbing his foot into his loose shoe unsuccessfully. He'd spent most of his risen hour trying to get his hose on, and that had used up all the flexibility his back was willing to give him today. "Lord Sherlock has requested it."
Mycroft had simply put a stilling hand on his husband's thigh as Lord Gregory had made to rise and asked Sally to leave the room. Waiting stoically for Sherlock's tirade to end. Or at least for the young man to require another breath. "Why would you do this Mycroft?!" Sherlock had raved. "What could have possibly forced you to agree to this?"
William just shrugged. "I'm merely the messenger."
It was not until that night, when the downpour had finally slackened, when the sun had begun to set once more as though it too was weary of the rain, that John came across his salvation.
They both stared at it for a long while, lost in their own private thoughts. It's light was dim against the harsh fluorescent over the stove, but its subdued luminosity remained constant and seemed to be filled with hope. A strange little life amidst conspicuous death.
He reached down and took up a grape and pressed it into Sherlock's lips, watching jealously as it disappeared.
"What's that?" Sherlock asked suddenly.
Riding three days nearly non-stop on very little food made his bones feel brittle. His stomach hollow. And his head throb in a way that made even the torch that William lit upon the wall be too bright for his eyes.
John's neck went to water, letting his head fell back with a thunk as he allowed himself to give up watching and simply /feel/. Gasping harshly as Sherlock took him into his mouth without any hesitation, testing the limitations of John's impressive girth in the confines of his hot, wet jaw. And even if it all turned out to be the impractical investigations of a scientist detective; to John it felt akin to pure carnal rapture.
"It can wait 'til morning!"
"Well...what were you going to do with it after you bought it?" Each question he asked made him feel more and more like a clot. Desperately slow on the uptake and needing to satisfy his own worry as to Sherlock's true motives, just the way he'd told off Mycroft for doing when he'd picked him up outside 221B, chastising him about trying to control a  grown man's life.
"Why not?"
"So if the Realm called upon you to serve it, you would do so?"
Each step is laborious.
After leaving Sherlock's solar yesterday, John had been silently shown to his chambers by the High Steward, which had turned out to be a room of his own with a real bed with real sheets and a real mattress filled with down.
John turned to drink his water before Sherlock could look up and misconstrue the look on his face.
John tallied them up in his head, ignoring how tight his voice had gotten. "Just how many experiments have you got going on right now?"
"Leave it and go." Sherlock muttered and John was taken aback a bit - though not wholly surprised - at the rudeness of the reply, but then realized there was someone coming up the stairs.
"Oh. That's a shame." John saw the exact moment Sherlock dismissed her from his mind forever. "Best to let her down easy I suppose."
And like being absolved, John's outlook on the putrescence that was his life had been wiped clean with one simple flash of ice-coloured eyes that had only met his briefly before sweeping away.
Sherlock flashed a glance at them both as though they were utter imbeciles trying to waylay his moment. "What floats are things less dense than the water they're in, if any of you were smart enough to finish sixth year. Salt water has a higher density, which can support things more easily, but this far up the Thames, beyond the estuary, the water fails to even be slightly brackish. So why ELSE would a human head /specifically/ float in fresh water?
She held it up for him to look over. It was a black and white sleeve with a picture of the Hindenburg going down in hydrogen-fueled flames: Led Zeppelin's first album.
They kissed until the kisses became lazy and quiet. Sipping delicately from each other's mouths until John was contented to rest his head back on Sherlock's chest and let the room's silence encapsulate them.
He'd caught himself navel gazing more than once in the supermarket, eyes lost in the middle distance, standing in the way in the aisle, before he forced himself to leave and head back home. Burdened with a score of random edibles he'd gathered together with no real thought.
"Then there's still time. . ."
"But he's married now." John had said, disbelieving. "He would never agree."
It made John wonder what kind of lover he would be. What did he prefer in his partners? Had he ever even made love before? He couldn't imagine that a Prince trapped in a tower could have much chance at romance, but surely he had had the ability to bed whom he pleased.
"And how does that mean it's a 'he'?" John asked, causing Sherlock to turn his irradiating attention upon him.
thank you. please enjoy.
"A fish. Obviously." His tone through the door sounded occupied, resistant to answer his question.
Nimble fingers peeled down his jeans and pants as one, loosing the dark blonde thatch beneath his navel and the delicate flushing flesh of his prick, which lay docile against his thigh. At the draft of cool air, John gasped.
"But it's not like that between us."
Sherlock's shirt was soaked through with sweat, his curls limp with moisture, his neck sparkling with condensation. Sherlock was panting just as hard as John was, his face buried in John's neck, his heart pounding just as madly as the blood rushing through John's ears and John had the overwhelming urge to turn around in Sherlock's arms and hug right back hard enough to leave bruises. Tell him it was alright. That he loved him. That he was everything.
John interrupted him. "He told me that much, he said it was the case he started on. Read it in the paper." His brain automatically cycled back again to finding those trainers in 221C.  The catalyst clue that had begun the horrendous game of cat-and-mouse with Moriarty, and the climactic night that had nearly ended in John and Sherlock being blown apart by semtex.
William smirked knowingly and looked up at him from beneath his pale eyebrows. "Clearly keen on you. That's for certain."
"Of course I do." John assured him, his dark blue eyes all that Sherlock saw. The naked awe in them. The way his little pink tongue darted out in the midst of his graying beard to wet his lips and leave them invitingly shiny. "It's extraordinary. You're extraordinary."
And just like that, John came. Pressing deep and letting go.
John's aborted erection from this morning suddenly had no trouble finding its second wind.
Instead of going to it, as John suspected he would, Sherlock limped back through the kitchen and with one hand sliding along the wall to brace himself, disappeared into his bedroom.
"And I see your appetite has begun to improve as well. How fortuitous. I expect the physician will see an improvement in your humours this morning." Sherlock, to the High Steward's delight, swallowed the grape whole.
John was experiencing a sort of vertigo now. With Sherlock's eyes boring down on him, he noticed that his heart was beating incredibly fast, knocking about in his chest like a bird into a window. The music and the crowd and the moment all trying to simultaneously consume him. Eat him up. He felt his armpits grow sweaty, his shoulder throb. He flexed his hand and tried not to feel so wrong-footed.
He'd taken it so personally when John'd stopped them earlier, considering himself broken. How did this help? Would he consider this cowardice on John's part? Promising all this deep insistence of mutual decision while lying in bed with him, but certainly not proving it in practice? Hiding himself away like a lech because it was /easier/?
He removed a silver cover from a large platter and worked some bits of hardened crust from a bread loaf that had come with his untouched meal from yesterday.
John has a plan. but nobody said it was a good one...
A singular laugh betrayed him at the memory. A look of fondness softening his face as he wiped the wetness with his palm. "And it was this ridiculous shit-eating grin that he use to have sometimes and I just remember that I paused when I took off my kit. To laugh at the git. I stopped to fucking /laugh/, and th...that's all it took. The sniper must've crawled closer on his second shot. 'Cause...well...
"It's a true rarity in the marine aquarium industry, John. So much in fact that it's considered the crowning jewel of anyone's collection and requires deep pockets and museum-grade certification to obtain. Mr. Asano has been an avid collector for thirteen years now, and as his collection has grown, he has dedicated an entire room of his house to the hobby. He told me that he is currently in possession of fifteen tanks totalling seven hundred and sixty litres altogether. He claims to house everything in them from giant clams, an octopus, cuttlefish, angel fish, mantis shrimps, and nudibranchs, to incredibly large mother colonies of small polyp stony corals, anemones, and gorgonians."
"It is, your Highness." More than John actually thought, but did not voice this. Thinking it imprudent.
"I observed it on the first day you came." Sherlock admitted a bit sheepishly. People usually didn't like for Sherlock to expose the parts of their life that they chose to keep secret.
This was madness!
John was frozen in a state of shock, all this information leaving him spinning. He was to leave, to set out for parts unknown to serve someone he'd never met before and take someone else with him on this stranger journey. . . and it would all be set into motion at his word?
It'd be fine.
"What?" Sherlock breathed. Perhaps John thought he was sullied now. What if tonight was ruined by what he had witnessed?
"You look gorgeous today." He whispered silkily into Sherlock's ear before tilting his head and pressing a kiss to the side of Sherlock's naked neck. Before adding another. And then another. Getting all he could taste of him in these brief but splendid moments.
Sherlock's eyes flicked back and forth from the door to the assistant's back. "Your tooth was chipped, it was the perfect opportunity."
Understanding this sacrifice, Sherlock shifted his hands to bracelet John's wrists and begin to position him to his liking, neither of them noticing when they knocked the toothpaste into the sink. His procedure was slow enough that he gave John the option to stop him any time he wished it. But he did not want. He merely watched Sherlock's icy eyes flick from him to his work and back again.
Almost immediately, Sherlock tilted his head towards top of the suit, having spotted something and stooped until he was mere centimeters away from the collar. He plucked something from beneath its fold with a quick move and wadded it into his glove as he stripped them. John saw him shove it into his pants pocket while the others were still busy looking at the dead man and shook his head in exasperation. Which earned him a disarming wink from the Consulting Detective.
And at this, the monk placed a pudgy hand atop the wooden cross around his neck and the strap of his satchel as if holding his chest together, letting his his laughs peter out into breathy chuckles, still shaking his head. "Heavens no, dear fellow! Quite the opposite in fact. But perhaps we had better take my mission indoors, hm? I have much to explain and would be very grateful if you would join me for a fine evening meal to tide us over on our way back."
But Sherlock was standing swiftly, shoving both phone and glove into his pocket as the dental assistant approached them. John rose quickly to match him. Putting out his hand. "Mr. Watson? Hi, my name is Ygritte. If you'd like to follow me to the back, Mr. Sipe will see you now."
"Jeremy Brett and David Burke." Sherlock said smoothly, producing from his inner pocket two plastic cards and handing them over for inspection. Along with two twenty pound notes. When the man handed him only the cards back, it was with a satisfied but otherwise barely moved air. Taking the dog, he walked back to a nondescript door and knocked twice.
After a little bit, John leaned in to whisper, unable to cool his thoughts. "Greg? Can you elaborate on what happened between Gregson and Sherlock during the Carl Powers' case? He's never mentioned him before."
"You're face gets smoother when you're sleeping." Sherlock remarked as a form of answer. He pushed a soft kiss onto the cap of John's shoulder, and burrowed a sharp chin into his bicep.
John kept periodically checking his pulse for anomalies as he worked.
As though summoned, there was a knock at the door.
And a small victory in the same.
The shorter man was obviously John with golden stubbling prickling his chin. Despite his hair being lighter than it was now, noticeably less gray, and cropped incredibly short. It was wrecked into spikes, having apparently just received a manhandling of some sort.
with the music, i'm trying to incorporate certain songs i've chosen into the chapters like they did with Sherlock episodes 2x3 and 3x1. but i'm slowly introducing them where I feel they will fit the best.
"What?" Lestrade asked, leaning in to try and see what he saw.
Sherlock remained blessedly silent and it was a while before John's voice allowed itself to be found again. "We were assigned to clear out a compound in Nahr-e Saraj that was suspected of housing Taliban. It was a green level village, which meant it was considered friendly, nothing special should have come of it. Easy in and out. A five man patrol was to probe one kilometer North, sweeping for IEDs as we went. Standard procedure. " He took a long breath, almost laughing in disbelief. "Those bloody things. When they'd go off, they'd pick up whatever was around them and scatter it into the blast. There was...I once saw a twelve inch piece of grass puncture through a bloke's thigh, still green. I mean...shit. Those were worse than gunfire in a way. I'd have taken live fire any day over...over...
The ocean surged rhythmically against the bay beneath him. Eating away at the world. It was a miracle and a half he even made it down at all.
"Pleasure to meet you David." He seemed to consider something before leaning back over. "Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not here to hit on you. Totally straight." He threw a handful of peanuts into his mouth and spoke around them. "It's just-- my mates are still back there dancing and I don't want to look like a complete tosser sitting all by myself at our table."
"You clearly do not understand the significance of this, Lestrade! According to the London Bridge tide tables, this has all been orchestrated. Perfectly synchronised for the discovery of the head to happen just as Gregson was giving his speech about taking a suspect into custody! The WRONG suspect!
The thick-walled battlement the bird sat upon served to defend the castle should it fall under attack. However unlikely such an occurrence would be; given the unique and impregnable location of the castle here at the absolute edge of the high cliff and crushed between two mighty rivers that roared along each side.
John had felt his heart speed up and the blood rush into his ears.
"John. Believe me." Sherlock's hand tightened on the doorknob, looking over his shoulder at John who did not turn, before letting his gaze slide to the floor. "We cannot survive this without tea."
Understanding, but not caring in the least, John took him by the lapel and pulled him down into a kiss to ease his anguish, making it count. He backed off after a little while, just as Sherlock had begun to want to make it heavier. It had seemed to work wonderfully for calming him down. He kept it in the back of his mind to use later. "God, your lips are freezing. Open." And when Sherlock begrudgingly obliged, John slid the thermometer beneath his tongue and tapped his jaw for him to close.
"There's a bit of a problem with that, unfortunately." Molly squirmed. "When we took Mr. Jones out of his body bag, since he was all twisted around, he sort of...well--"
"'Morning Molly." Lestrade and John both said in unison.
"Cheers. That makes me feel loads better." He remarked sarcastically.
They brought each other to their first shared pleasure when they were fourteen in the apple grove behind William's house. A dirty and fast stripping of each other's flesh that had left them both gasping and biting at each other's lips. Trying to press their luck on how quickly they could go again.
"Shouldn't I be the one to ask you that?" Came the rumbling baritone right against his spine. Sherlock touched his lips to his nape and rubbed them back and forth. Not quite in a kiss, but more as if in sensation. To feel. It made goosebumps raise across John's forearms.
"That's illegal!" Anderson balked.
"No." John growled stubbornly, keeping Sherlock away by stiffening his wrists. "I'm not ready to go off like a bloody teenager. I want it to last. Come up here and kiss me some more."
"Through the foramen magnum...amazing." John suddenly said, the muddled lens of evidence wiped suddenly clear to him. When his eyes flashed up to Sherlock's, he was gracing him with a gorgeous close-mouthed grin.
John contemplated his response for a long while, the story compounded by his own personal experiences that seemed to have bloomed fresh with new sadness. He knew his words were nothing but a balm to a wound that would yet take years to heal, but he felt it necessary to say what he felt, if even for his own selfish comfort. "It's a lucky thing, seeing a mate off. Getting to just /be there/. It means a lot to the ones who leave us. Trust me on that. And getting to go out under our own steam, that's a blessing too. Even if right now it doesn't look like it was."
As the tangy afterkisses die down and the exhaustion slides in, Sherlock resettles onto John's side.
To this, John merely raised his eyebrows. For what did he know of physician's educations and Princely deductions? He did not have an answer that would suit, he was sure.
The monk did not dismount as he moved a little further on, but stopped his horse beside a rickety looking stand where a large-eared sow was suckling six piglets as she lay on her side in a pen. The young woman standing near it greeted brother Michael and handed off a small parcel with a fond farewell.
"Oh, brilliant. So us ...snogging? That was, what? Just data gathering?" John couldn't help the sharp edge his whisper took, about to be incredibly cross should it turn out that Sherlock had been using him.
But Sherlock's arms only squeezed more tightly across John's shoulders, pressing them together so firmly that it seemed he too was trying to give John the osmosis he wished for. "So your phobia of medical equipment covering your face stemmed from..." Sherlock began, not finishing as he felt John nod minutely against him. Feeling John's skin break out in a wash of goosebumps. Feeling the smear of wet eyes.
Sherlock took a seat in front of the plate of food, to which John made sure be more fully captivating by setting down a steeping cup of tea next to it and prompted idle talk of 'the Work'. "So? Got any theories on why Gregson didn't come with Donovan to pick up Sipe? I would have thought he'd want to bring his man in himself."
"John." Sherlock's deep voice cracked as loud as a peal of thunder through the room, though he'd only had it raised above a whisper. Sherlock tossed the book back into the drawer and shut it with a slam, as if he could reverse this opening of this Pandora's box. "Look at me John."
Harry had grabbed the idea with both hands shaking and swore up and down she had had her last drink and that she had reigns of her life on the turn around. Clara just needed to see. Take some time to calm down. She'd said all this while spreading out her folders across John's bed trolley, taking a seat beside his thighs and ducking beneath all his IVs.
He took a large sniff of the air, frowning. "I can smell her curling iron. She always sets it too hot. I don't think she can read the dial anymore."
"Anyway, I'll be high, so, it won't be so bad." John joked in hopes to ease the tension and glanced over at Sherlock, who was now staring a hole though the back of the dentist's head.
The allowance was no longer than a second, barely more than a quick flash of his eyes, but John knew that Sherlock had seen what there was to see and when their eyes met up once more, Sherlock nodded minutely in thanks and John nodded back, slipping the soft fabric on and feeling a little bit calmer.
John felt a deep sense of gratitude and contentment overcome him as he settled down into his chair. Sherlock remained in the kitchen, picking through the grocery sack, but not really putting anything away. He cracked open the biscuits and took one in his teeth, sucking the chocolate taste from them until they became a mush in his mouth. Discarding it after it changed texture.
John frowned and squinted at his watch, surprised at the time. "Cor, it's already past lunch."
holy crap lovelies! do you even remember what's going on? cause I don't. but set your phasers to finished anyway!!
"Maybe it's a metaphor? For what you mean to him." Mrs. Hudson suggested while making a decision between a bag of semi sweet and a bag of milk chocolate chips. Eventually she decided on both. They'd studied the rock only briefly before leaving, not knowing what to make out of it. It was about the size of a potato and completely unremarkable.
Before shattering.
"Sshh. Easy. Easy. Almost there. Bear down. Just bear down against it."
Miles sniggered and held up a finger, going to the coat check and coming back. He slid over a glossy paperback copy with a rueful look and flushed a bit while John looked it over.
"Uh, yes." John answered belatedly, reaching for an explanation. "Chipped it chewing on ice."
"I already have." William's words had been soft and sobering. Unwilling to be swayed. "This is for the best, John. If you love me then you will find it in yourself to know it. I will have a partner I can take into the village now. Be seen with without recourse. I will not have to hide and lie about it. I will not have my name disgraced by my actions. Our children, when we choose to have them, will not be made out of wedlock. Do you understand John? I love you and I always will, but my decision is made. I'm to be wed this time tomorrow."
Moran's sneer had transformed into something predatory, his eyes foreseeing a battle already won. "Very well, Lord of Umberland of the North. I am Marshal Moran. I come under the blessing of King James of Westwood. You and your people will have a decision to make by this time tomorrow: side with King James and his Crusade or be slaughtered. The choice is simple."
Sherlock loved him, in his own mad way. And just as Mycroft had warned him, it was all consuming.
Suddenly, Miles' stunning smile slashed through John's memory and to know that that particular beauty might not be seen again for a very long time seemed to suck the air from the room. "Oh Jesus. Jesus!" Barring countless surgeries and months to years of physical therapy, this man would probably be crippled for life. John felt instantly nauseous. He'd made this happen. This man's life had been ruined because of John.
And then it hits him.
Sherlock immediately leant down to examine the red grin of a sealed incision above the man's right hip. "John? Come and have a look at this."
"Take care of yourself. Sherlock."
He dreamt about punching Bill's shoulder hard and laughing at the git. His dream morphing into when he fucked him for the first and last time that night with no protection under the naked spill of the Milky Way. Bill's tattooed body curled up and back above him like an apostrophe as he slowly sank down onto John's cock. John fighting the entire time to keep perfectly still.
"Ah! It does speak!" Another brush from those palpable eyes was favoured upon him. Reading more of him like an illuminated text. "Do you do any other tricks I wonder? Like perhaps addressing your Prince directly? Or am I so ugly that you should always deign to stare at a wall?"
"I pulled some strings. Asked for a favor." Sherlock said simply.
"The what?" Anderson asked, ruining the atmosphere.
"So it would appear."
"Now where is that damn thing?" John went out in the living room and found it stacked nicely with the newspapers, undoubtedly the work of Mrs. Hudson once again. "There's only ever been the one thing I needed to know," he said as he made his way back towards the kitchen, "are you clean?"
"John." Sherlock said warningly, alerting him to the fact that he was forging into idiot territory.
John, the first to fall, had gone missing not long after the last of the blood had been shed. His body secretly taken from the physician's hospital under the cover of darkness and presumed to be one among the many corpses now lying in a deep pit outside the village. In the sterile earth that belonged to no one.
John had laughed. One single scoff and self-conscious hand stroked over his beard. "I--Thanks. I am well. Thanks in part to you." He had said, glancing at his feet. Unable to keep William's eyes for too long lest the sting behind his eyes come to real tears.
"Right." John had snorted. "You do know that's a recommended night's sleep for normal humans, right?"
Sherlock's impotence will be explained in a later chapter.
first Morse : Sherlock Holmes gives amazing head.
And if one chose to cross over the East river upon the East fork, they would be led straight into the shadowed tangle that was the forbidden Royal Forest of Baskerville, which had overtaken the road with its wildness and shrouded it in magic and secrets.
"No."
Is this what love is to a madman like Sherlock Holmes?
"Makes sense I guess. Might be interesting to watch since we've nothing on tomorrow." John agreed, looking out into the living room and hearing the bright harmony of foreign opera. It was nice. "It's kind of a shame though, how nice Dr. Sipe was. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill psychopaths." John scratched his eyebrow. "Threw me for a loop."
And indeed it had been.
"I don't know if I...I've never..."
But instead, John found his unused hand starfished against his chest, sliding of its own volition over his pecs and stopping to pinch the hard flesh of his nipples into peaks. He envied Sherlock's sensitivity here. Remembering the way his whole torso had lifted from the bed when John had sucked them. The very thought made John shiver in the midst of pelting warmth.
John did not understand the smirk that hooked Brother Michael's mouth at this, but only watched as he took a sprig of something from another vial and crushed it in his fingers over the stew before throwing the stick in with it. The smell of it, sharp and deep, overtook John and his stomach growled loudly. "Forgive me for being bold, but isn't the point of being a monk to abstain from indulgences?"
John took a steady breath and ignored the twinge in his shoulder while the disgust ebbed. "So the murderer's stealing organs then? He's an organ thief."
This morning, Mr. Asano had wired five thousand pounds into their account. He saw the shopping amount taken out at thirteen fifty-two, just as expected. But then...
The man whom John had formerly thought of as the King paused here and behind the veil of the parchment he held aloft, met and held John's gaze for the first time since he'd met him with a cold, calculating stare. A small smirk making his mouth slither upwards.
"What's all this about?" John asked, being mindful of the angry heat radiating off the lamp as he bent to inspect the little boxes lined up in a row.
With the sway of a victorious man, Charles exited the screen and took up the tray from the bed. Plucking up his own grape and sliding it seductively into his mouth. John, with his clenched jaw and turned-away eyes, would not deign to look at him.
'/I felt it was a good representation/.
John shook the hand out of nothing more than courtesy.
"Thanks very much for this. I definitely need it after ...this morning." Lestrade reached out to take the cup marked 'BL' and seemed to hesitate about continuing.
Somewhat comforted in the idea that they were in the right, John relaxed a bit. "So how do you know this guy's the one? Did you call up the Red-Headed League hotline or something? Ask for a dentist that fit the description?"
A question about dinner had stopped the tiger-in-confinement stalking on the spot. His eyes narrowed and his words intending to eviscerate.
Sighing, John clicked open the cabinet, fished out his toothpaste, and when he shut it again started sharply. Sherlock had silently moved to stand very close behind him, grim and pale as a spectre. "Jesus Sherlock!" John growled, having to twice now recalm his racing heart.
Though he wore a calm facade and what he hoped to be an interested look, he felt like an utter tit. Raising his eyebrows every so often when Asano-san or Sherlock would look in his direction, hoping they'd suddenly break into a conversation he could partake in. But it never happened. He twitched uncomfortably in his seat and fought the notion that they were talking about him. As it seemed highly unlikely.
Charles interrupted. "Oh? Have you heard from him? Has he sent you word?"
"No one would accuse you of vanity, John." Sherlock scoffed. "A bespoke RARELY get dry cleaned. That's entirely the point of them. Chemicals would only warp the wool. Besides, the smell was all wrong. It smelled like steam iron press and something...organic. I can't place it exactly, which is irritating.
"Sherlock." John sighed. "I don't want to go to a club. I want to eat. I'm starving. I haven't eaten all day."
A quick glance to Sherlock's lap revealed smooth fabric that would have immediately shown any sort of arousal. Its formless plain made his stomach twist.
"I've just remembered something." He lies, but takes his time to stop and speak with her. Because this may well be the very last time he will get the chance. "I need to step out for a bit. Call me if Sherlock comes back, yeah?"
John smiled. A soft, delicate thing that Sherlock felt in his heart of hearts that he didn't deserve. COULDN'T EVER deserve. He couldn't begin to accept that this wonderful man had limped into his life so unassumingly and had become so vital. Crossed his blood-brain barrier and become permanent. And that he would do anything to keep him. That he'd DONE EVERYTHING to keep him.
"D'you think?" John let the little flame of hope flicker in his chest.
"Dull." Sherlock grinned and pressed in the other part of his wiring, completing the circuit and making the little red diode glow to life.
Beneath him, a marquee scrolled by, exclaiming that NSY had taken a murder suspect into custody.
"Well, doctor Watson. I don't promote the eating of ice, but hopefully you'll be satisfied with the abilities of your new tooth." Dr. Sipe showed them back out and stopped short as they came to the back of the waiting room's door which seemed to be the perimeter of his territory. The man behind the curtain.
John had looked over during a moment of contemplative chewing and had watched curiously as brother Michael unrolled the leather roll of vials from his satchel and went about scraping the dark earth out from between his toes, carefully pushing it into an empty vial.
But instead, he buried his face further into his upturned collar and raised his middle finger in high salute, trudging away down the street and off into the welcome arms of the night. Preferring never to have heard the name Sherlock Holmes.
It had started with a twitch of his finger, then a roll of his eyes beneath their lids, and then finally a flutter of his lashes and an angry moan. Not long after he was responding to stimuli and accepting small sips of wine and spoonfuls of broth. Even growing so well as to sit up in his bed by the third day and regaining the pallor of a living man by the fifth.
"I will. I'm alright. Thank you." John says, taking her by the shoulders, which makes her eyes go a bit wide, and embracing her. Her thin, old body feels wonderful and motherly in his arms. "What's all this about?" She asks in mild alarm.
Ever since his convalescence, John had never been able to get used to the wrongness of this new body he had and how strange it felt to inhabit it. How drastically it now differed from the body of his youth. Gone were the lean, tight muscles of hard-laboured limbs that had once been - by his own and others' estimation - beautiful to behold. Now, they had been replaced by a stretch of thin, scarred skin warped tightly over a nest of sharp bone.
"Oh God!" Growled John, his voice broken in his throat, leaking out through his muffling hands. "Oh Sherlock! Nnnhg. Sto--don't stop!"
"No." Idly, Sherlock's fingertip drew a Golden spiral starting at the center of John's cervical spine and radiated it outward precisely. "But I was rarely myself in all the time I spent with them, so explanation never seemed necessary. And since I preferred penetration and intercourse was rarely pursued without the use of recreational drugs, my body would perform admirably. So it never really became an issue. But if they did notice when I didn't achieve orgasm, they never said." He could feel the tension coil minutely in John's body and instantly he cleared the air. "That is not to say I ever allowed myself to be coerced or abused because of it, if that's what you're worried about. I assure you that I was always a willing partner every time. I simply provided myself as the means to an end for something they felt they needed by necessity and I ...did not."
John would never get tired of being able to provide a concrete reference to Sherlock's rudimentary knowledge of anatomy. Casually flinging out things like 'Omo-hyoid muscle' or 'Anastomotica magna of the brachial artery' whenever the mood was right. John was simply happy to help.
John stared at it longingly. "I hope someday you'll play again. I'd very much like to hear it. I bet you play magnificently." John had always been one for music. Especially as it came into his life rarely and infrequently. But every time he heard it, it moved something deep inside him.
"Hm?" Sherlock's other slicked hand rose up to take John's hot prick into its grasp, offering one long gorgeous stroke before it too came to a stop, poised right beneath the corona.
"Agh! CHRIST!" John shrieks as the ball of his humerus slips back into its glenoid socket and despite the initial flash, the after burn of his body coming back together banks down enough for him to gather his arm to him like a long lost child. He tries to find something beyond the pain and finds Sherlock (ALWAYS Sherlock) pulling his shoe back on.
He's upon them both in an instant, hands clawing at the Union Jack neck man's clothes. Trying to pull him off. Grasp   slipping. Fingers refusing to grip. In a desperate gesture he goes for the soft bits he can reach, just like the military taught him, and he presses his hand into the man's skull and rends.
"SHERLOCK!"
And much to both their surprise, they go tumbling over the marble rail.
A thin rope was tacked across the windows, burdened with an array of dried herbs, desiccated bird feet, leathered frogs, and small burlap pouches of ingredients too small to be hung whole.
But there was nothing. No response. No comment. No derision. The only indication that he hadn't turned into a bloody statue at the touch of high humidity was that his palms had come up to press together in front of his chin.
He contemplated the tragedy of it, the sudden prodigy of the very concept. How utterly amazing and totally terrifying it could be. How unthinkable and natural and very truly completely dangerous...but was it true? Had that really just become a possibili--?
In the early afternoon of the second day, the post came, effectively twisting the mood that had been filling 221B into a more defined focus. Providing the catalyst they needed to end this pointless circling.
The Union Jack neck man is over the top of him. Crowding in.
This confession seems to put a halt to the brittle shell of isolation that Sherlock's beginning to rebuild around himself again and he looks so young when he's confused. He blinks and with his soft brows furrowed pensively, that wrinkle on the bridge of his nose forms just as quickly as John wants to kiss it away.
It turned one eye at the misshapen reflection its body made in the uneven glass diamonds of the window, before hopping up onto the cradle of the lead bars where one of the small panes had been removed. Looking in.
"The High Steward." Prince Sherlock announced, knowing somehow without having been there, as though he'd worked it out through witchcraft. "He has spilled poison into your ear. Tell me, what did he say?"
"Come to think of it, you were rather boisterous about your intentions that night. Perhaps even overcompensating in the hopes that your nerve would win out against your hesitance. /In fact/, you've been casually forthcoming to any woman who falls into your categorization of attractiveness; curvy, athletic build, similar eye-height, A to B cup breast size relative to figure. You even went so far as to hit on Mycroft's personal assistant. So it's certainly not a question of timidity."
Letting at least an hour pass, John tried the door again, but still nothing became of his knocking. "Sherlock? I know you're in there. At least, I think you are. Look, I um-- thanks for the tea, by the way. It was--I don't take sugar. But it's alright. It was good anyway." He lied and traced a finger over the grain in the wood, trying to imagine what Sherlock was doing on the other side. "After you left yesterday, Lestrade asked me to tell him if you knew anything more about how we could get this guy and um--it's kind of...well, you're acting a bit... look if it's something I can help you with, I want to help."
He was dressed in a silken swath of dark gray and yellow that switched emphasis at his waist, a pair of fine white chausses, and pointed shoes that were adorned with large gray rosettes. The large black robe lined with fur that was fastened at his shoulders was long enough to cover his horse's croup.
The Watsons were a family of master disappearances. They'd been doing it for years.
He thought on the three gold sovereigns William had pushed into his hand when he had left, 'just in case' he had said. And maybe he was right.
And then he sees the sparkle.
He was unshouldering his coat when Sherlock came stomping back out, barefoot, dressed down in his pajamas and dressing gown and took up a foetal position with a massive thump on the couch. "Bedroom's yours," he muttered petulantly, before slamming his fist into the Union Jack pillow for good measure and burrowing down into the mashed leather.
X-rays reveal that both the radius and ulna of John's right arm have been fractured, while the dislocation that had once affected his left, had been expertly sorted out by Sherlock. And while John's doctor comments on how lucky he was not to have done any further damage to himself falling from such a height, John is rather more concerned with being so inconveniently hobbled than he is on his 'good fortune'.
He wanted Sherlock to feel safe and warm and calm. All the things he was clearly not right now. He let him sink down completely until the sharp fans of his ischium were stabbing into John's firm hips. Sherlock's knees practically bent up against his ears. "I'm inside you now. I'm in love. It's over. Just relax. Give it a minute."
"I am." Sherlock told the truth for them both. "But it's alright." He looked down John's body, nearly as thin as his own. "Do you trust me?"
"'Course it does." John chuckled. Already aware that the next couple of hours were going to be spent with himself doing all of the cleaning and already planning on goading Sherlock into playing something on the violin while he worked.
He looked as though a boulder of burden had been lifted from his shoulders. He was bright eyed and well-rested. Not at all the bedraggled and mudcaked thing that had shuffled into his chamber yesterday. He was a new man that shone so bright and so true that he rivaled the morning sun in its beauty.
"During the second stage, your tremors will worsen along with your muscle control. You will become incapable of walking and will require assistance even to stand. You will become emotionally unstable and suffer bouts of uncontrollable laughter, which is just as well, because when you reach the terminal stage of the disease, your life will not end happily.
John gave a snort of disbelieving laughter and passed them back, letting Sherlock organize them back into the appropriate pockets.
And something in those starlight eyes relayed that no further argument would be broached. "The rules say nothing about my performing a sexual act exclusively upon you as restitution for the hurt I have just recently caused you." Came the simple reply. "And if you are still concerned over your purported performance issues; it will be a far simpler task to relieve it from your hands completely with no expectation of reciprocity."
It was a long while before either man spoke again. John contented, if a little stunned, to watch the monk work so fastidiously. He watched raptly as he pulled from his satchel and robes all manner of unusual things with which to help him make a meal and before long, the stwe was brought to a simmering boil that smelled absolutely heavenly. It was then, that the silence between them was finally broken.
"John."
Lestrade stood outside, holding up a gym bag and a large green thermos. "Thought this might help a bit." He nodded towards the bag, "it's got my work out stuff in there. Might be a little short on 'im but it's about the only thing we've got around here that'll do for now." He craned his neck to see past John's shoulder. "You're just lucky they're clean. They've been in the boot. I haven't made it to the gym yet."  Sherlock mumbled a stuttering, disparaging remark at that, but John just took the proffered items appriciatively. "Ta, very much Greg."
To Hell with Umberland of the North. Moran could have it and all its worthless peasants. As long as John regained his beloved in the midst of the bloodshed. . .
John pulled back before it got too embarrassing. "So. What's on the agenda for today? Anything cracking?" He asked, going for ambivalence as he picked up the top most petri dish and held it up to the window's light. He wanted to finally see what had Sherlock so invested.
John slapped the folder down on the sitting room desk with a sigh, rubbing his hands across his face before tunneling them through his short, coarse hair. The act made it stick up in starburst spikes, but he took no notice. Mycroft's visit had both angered him and intrigued him.
They looked enamored. Loving. Willing. A devotee.
He sprang up so fast John took a surprised step back, hand raised to his head in defense. Sherlock was fully standing on his chair now, fists in the air, a huge smile splitting his face. "Oh! This is BRILLIANT!" He bounded down and was at the door in two strides, plucking his coat from the rack and winding his scarf about his neck. "Come along John! Grab your shoes and coat! We're going to be expected!"
"No." It was a point, maybe.
John cleared his throat, trying to be vague. "Ah, well. I have my escapes." The bag became sudden evidence.
"Alright?" John asked. Still taking soft bites at his mouth.
Sherlock's head nearly spun on his neck to look over at him. "Tact! What are you talking about? I was incredibly tactful."
And always the same dream; of finding his brother struck dead in gold plate armor on a formless battlefield. Slain by an arrow, or an axe, or a sword. The method mattered not because the outcome was always the same:
He couldn't help the burst of filthy lust that washed over him when he heard the wet /flup!/ of the anal plug leaving Sherlock's orifice. Felt his guts' resistance in letting it go. John just barely registered the noise as it thumped to the floor discarded when he became suddenly too preoccupied with pressing his fingers up against Sherlock's yawning entrance, moaning when he was able to finger the loose muscles of Sherlock's external and internal sphincters immediately. So plied were they, so stretched, that he was able to slip both fingertips up and in side by side (and could have possibly included a third) feeling the peculiar viscosity of old lube coating the anoderm. He felt Sherlock's muscles flutter ineffectually to try and close the gaping hole. Close around his fingers. He would have sold his soul for a mirror right then. He'd always had a thing for dilating muscles. A relieved whimper from Sherlock brought John's lizard brain to heel. "Wha--? How long? How long have you been wearing that?"
Sherlock started from his abstraction. "So?"
The bouncer makes a noise in the affirmative and the Queen Mother sighs defeatedly. "Well I had had a whole monologue prepared for this moment. But if he's not going to even be able to hold a conversation with me then I suppose we will have to forgo all the pleasantries. Please go and inform my dog that I require him."
"Yes. Hello." He shook Sherlock's proffered hand obligingly, before circling in front of John. "And hello to you, Dr. Watson. Always a pleasure to meet a colleague in the medical field."
Sherlock sighed with effort. "It's not simply a suit from Primark, /John/." He inflected his name as though he were replacing the word 'idiot'. "It was fitted specifically to him from an admirer. Given the intimacy of it, I'd say this was a crime of passion."
Sherlock, for his part, steeled himself against the less wonderful half of his story. "During my second summer of staying with him, Victor appealed for me to look into the circumstances involving a man who was black mailing his father. An old acquaintance who had invited himself to live on the estate with us and was abusing the Trevors' hospitalities.
John saw stars when Sherlock took his whole hard prick in one slippery hand and gave it a desultory stroke, holding tight to the base to keep it in position. John just barely managed to catch Sherlock's arse cheeks as he moved with the intention of dropping himself straight down onto John's slicked cock. As if to impale himself cold start. "Christ's sake Sherlock! Take it easy!" He managed to choke out.
"It took a bit of convincing, but Geoff was eventually persuaded." Sherlock sniffed proudly. "I can be very persuasive."
He went to the bathroom and rummaged through the medicine cabinet, blinking a bit at its contents. The brand new bottle of Beechams all in one that John was fairly confident he'd just bought was gone, replaced by a brand he'd never used before, something called Comvita Propolis Elixir, which boasted that the propolis contained within was produced by bees and used by them to keep their hives free from infection.
One more application of threading, slick saliva to his hand and Sherlock pressed inside and curled his fingertips down against the swollen, richly sore gland of John's prostate, primed to explode. Holding nothing back. He stroked it three times clockwise and watched John's body climb to the precipice.
"Behaviourally he had manifested a tic that he would unconsciously perform when he was nervous, where he would press his palms together like this. What he had in looks however, contrasted greatly against the manner of his speech. He spoke with a heavy Cockney accent, sometimes it was so thick I couldn't understand him, though at times he claimed he could not understand /me/, but he was rather an idiot. The pronouncement of his alveolar consonants on the occasions when he was smoking marijuana alone were enough to-" John's bewildered look broke his traction. "What now?"
The intake read out like a car wreck. Each fact only amassing to a worse and worse calamity until all the hateful parts made up a nightmare whole.
"I'm hardly to be blamed for him sabotaging his own self..." Sherlock spat, before something else occurred to him. "Wait. Lestrade? Why didn't we meet at the station? Once the first train leaves all the data will have been compromised--oh. He's forbidden you from consulting me, hasn't he? /That's/ his way of getting revenge. He hasn't changed at all."
John's eyes were wide, frightened, his lips shaking. He had not told a single living soul about this nightmare he had experienced. But he knew in his bones that Sherlock was the on;y one in which he could confide. This terrible thing that had haunted him forever.
"The sex you had. Was it casual? Or--"
The truth was, he'd made an assumption that had come out completely wrong. Dredged up by the recent  conversations he'd been having with Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, and Mycroft as to Sherlock's past, which completely superseded whatever input Sherlock could have given to John himself. If he'd simply just /asked/.
Sherlock handed off the looking glass to John's gentle hands and tried not to make a mess of it.
These things did not bother Sherlock so much anymore. Being looked upon like a meal to be consumed. It was the more illicit touches that vexed him the most but he managed. He had long since become separate from his body. His mind his only refuge.
Pulls his other fist back...
John continued when he could, but only just. "We were going to move in together when we came back. Find each other after our tours ended. It's stupid, isn't it? To plan. That's when it all gets cocked up. That was the last time I saw Bill. He was killed a week later." He sniffed harshly and crushed his eyes with the heels of his hands. If he couldn't stop himself from crying now, he was determined not to make it a spectacle.
In Afghanistan, he'd been at least one step ahead at all times; clear of his orders and crystal on the objective. Letting circumstances fall as they may. He performed his duties admirably, with diligence and esteem. But back in London again, and embroiled in the capriciousness that was Sherlock Holmes, John felt he was always at least a step behind. Holding on with both hands simply because he had no choice. Shining only in the glaring refraction of the mad man's genius. It took adjusting, he knew. Time and patience.
William and John's family lands had been plotted side by side and once the boys were old enough to pick up stones from the paths of the ploughs, they took turns helping each other tend to their fields and daily work, for which their parents were grateful. They were stout young boys who laughed loudly and grew to love each other. Destined to marry, their parents would say.
"Of course it was. That was extraordinary...that was quite..." John's trailed off as the deja vu washed over him.
"Come on. It had to have crossed your mind at some point. I assume you would have had some experience while on leave to visit brothels in the area during your tours."
Sherlock pecked softly at the pocket behind John's jaw, pressing against the pulse point and felt it hammering strongly beneath his featherlight breaths. He walked his lips down the slide of John's sternocleidomastoid, licking into his suprasternal notch and scraping his teeth out across the high wire of John's clavicle.
The shock of light that poured in from the room beyond made the dark hallway flare brightly, strangely after so much darkness, before leaving it to fire-eaten shadow once more as the door was closed again.
"Noooooo, Sherlock. That was the least tactful I've seen you do yet, which is saying something. Now, don't get me wrong, that was at the same time absolutely bloody fucking amazing! But no, 'tactful' doesn't even come close to describing what you just did back there." He stabbed a thumb over his shoulder, like what they were retreating from was wreckage.
"Sherlock. Please." John breathed.
Sherlock shook his head vehemently and John believed him. /Would/ believe him always. Sherlock said himself that the only time that he'd ever enjoyed sex was when he was either inebriated or emotionally compromised. This was clearly only the latter. "Okay. That's good. You're hurting. I can see that." As he spoke, he'd begun to press up into Sherlock's trembling body, more slowly, only pushing the very tip of his cock in and stirring it around with a filthy little circle of his hips.
He would have crumpled, but for the iron grip that caught him about the ribs and held him tight. That lissome body pressed into his back and wedging him upright against the sink, so wet and hot that it was a conundrum to decide which of them was more hot or more wet as compared to the other and who started and ended where.
"No." Sherlock answered, a hair too quickly.
Gregory's hand on Mycroft's shoulder had put a hairline crack in the King's impressively quiet vexation, making Mycroft see the vulnerability with which Sherlock was imploring him, instead of the red wash of his anger.
He leans down for one last kiss and stays low when they part. Their nose tips touching gently.
He felt loved and alive when he'd forever thought that he never would be again. And it was truly terrifying.
"Oh my god...Shhhhr...oh...Christ...oh!"
John is bodily dragged clear to the far end of the table and plopped unceremoniously down at the place sitting. He blinks drunkenly at the bone china dish, the perfect setting of too much gold cutlery, and a rosette-shaped silk napkin that looks as soft and spiraled as a dollop of cream.
Finishing with his morning ritual with a put-upon sigh, Charles's dabbed at the sides of his own lips, wiping primly at the excess saliva that had gathered at the corners of his mouth. Taking the time to feel its consistency between his forefinger and thumb as he rubbed them together. As if they revealed something to him. "Are you certain?"
"I had had it for about a week before they figured out what it was. Long enough for me to contract pneumonia on top of it and end up pyrexic. Which you can probably guess meant that I was pretty far removed from consciousness then. Between the recovery and the meds and my immune system failing, I was pretty much dead to the world. So it wasn't 'til later, /weeks/ later, that one of the nurses had to explain to me what had happened..."
"Shut up Sherlock." John muttered half-heartedly and rubbed all the more briskly, avoiding the warmth in his eyes. "Things aren't that dire yet."
Gorse grew up through the floor, only because half the back wall is missing. There was gull shit in the sink and salt burn across the walls. What still stood gave the impression that the little place was disappearing. Gust by gust. Just like him.
Sherlock pulled John's left testicle into his mouth, rolling it about, deciding it shared the same basic characteristics as that of a hard boiled egg. Getting a mouthful of the right one revealed the same, though it was slightly smaller to its companion. Sherlock wondered if the dominant trait of John's left hand had any influence on this particular differentiation and filed it away for later investigation.
"Yeah." Lestrade said. "Forensics apparently had a bit of a time getting him up off the rails. Seems his clothes melted to his skin. I suppose that's gonna happen when you get cooked alive by about 600 volts."
John took what little consolation he could from seeing the man's torso moving with shallow breaths to reassure himself that the man was still alive.
The condemned man was struck in the face by a rotten lettuce head (which exploded into a shower of soggy leaves) just before a small stone caught him across the forehead and made him cry out. Shrill and sharp. Opening a large gash in his brow.
John knew he should answer his Prince, but again the words would not come to him. They remained trapped at the back of his tongue. None of them willing to come to the forefront of his mouth. But John was absolutely certain that it was not, above all things, fear that stayed them. John could not be afraid of that which he coveted.
"Yes my Lord. I would." John agreed automatically, eyes still fixed on the fore post of the bed.
There was suppose to have been fibrous tissue and cartilage to get through to get to the skull. A tangle of muscles that wound around the spine to keep it safe and supported, but someone had taken the time to clear out and scrape away all traces of meat around the bottom, leaving only the hollow collar of neck flesh hanging like a skirt beneath the base.
"And it should be fairly obvious that we will not be engaging in sexual intercourse while this or any case is on."
Thankfully, Charles' eyes were on John this time when the Captain turned to meet Sherlock's gaze and using every ounce of his will John kept his face entirely impassive, for Sherlock's eyes were an absolute flood of shame and remorse.
"I still don't..." Lestrade began confusedly.
"What? No." John bolstered himself at the flash of shame, forgetting that Sherlock could read minds. He supposed he should be grateful Sherlock hadn't said anything in front of Miles. "Listen Sherlock, I was out of line before. I DO trust you. I don't want you thinking that I don't. It just surprised me is all."
"What about drugs?" John found the question coming out before he'd thought about it. "Was he using when..."
He hesitated only a step when his familiar did not shadow him immediately, barely turning his head. He was clearly walking away. "Come along John. I believe we're done here. Sergeant Donovan? Text me the toxicology report when it goes through, if you would be so kind."
"OI! About bloody time you answered your fucking phone! Thank god. Are you alright? Where are you?!" Lestrade was shouting through his mobile as soon as he picked it up. His words frantic.
This was a magic hour; the delicate time between when the nocturnal predators had returned to their homes for sleep and the diurnal predators had yet to awaken.
He halted to pay tribute to both rosy nipples in turn, thrilled to feel them rise up as tiny beads beneath his mouth and pull surprised gasps from Sherlock, even going so far as to illicit a bow-like arch to his spine when he gave it a sensory bite. He felt the ghost of a hand hovering over the back of his head when he did, skittish as a humming bird, but never quite touching down. He took note of how ridiculously sensitive Sherlock seemed to be there, shelving the knowledge to utilize more in the future.
John, despite his want, did not look away.
John turned back to Sherlock. "Besides, you weren't there. Makes it a bit difficult to speak to you."
He was caught out eventually as he stared for far too long at the narrow white crescents of Sherlock's wrinkled feet, pondering the peculiar way they were crisscrossed over one another as though he'd been trying to warm them. The long gnarled toes curled against the ball pads and then released. It was simultaneously beautiful and ugly. Much like Sherlock.
Sod this.
John wasn't sure if he wanted to fully articulate what he thought he understood.
'The Cross', as it had come to be called, was the center point of all the trade routes that snaked East, West, North, and South and all those in between throughout the known world. All of them came together here in a sort of eight-pointed star where trading posts for the most exotic to the most mundane goods had set up business and stayed. Over time the eclectic assortment had turned into a sort of village of its own and become permanent.
Close enough to kiss.
"Allegedly." Sherlock seemed undaunted by John's inner struggle. "There wasn't visual confirmation made by either you or I as to his arrest, so in all actuality, neither of us can substantiate that the case has been solved as of yet. And besides, I still need to further monitor your reactions to familiarize myself with your personal triggers for sexual arousal."
John opened instantly beneath the wet heat, drawing Sherlock in to drink more deeply from his mouth. Inviting him into the possibilities that they may share soon and let Sherlock explore as he chose. He went for the open corners, the margins of his jawbone, the hot air above his tongue.
Straight for the bollocks then.
But as they grew older, their obligations to the church and matters of royalty began to superseded their time together and they grew apart, towards the end not seeing each other for years at a time.
"I don't want to read it now."
He let John look his fill, before closing the lid very gently.
"There. You see? Obvious."
(See the end of the chapter for
Where the blue turns of the lower rivers cradling the sides of Baker Town became mere ribbons in the bodice of a larger valley.
Before hopping back.
Beside the bed on the floor was a tapestry that had been taken down. Its absence from the wall left a large naked space above the bed.
Charles watched the rain with him for a while, stroking Sherlock's fingers as gently as if they belonged to him.
Sherlock bent down lower now, electricity crackling in his loosened muscles, leaning in for a kiss. Pulling back slightly when John turned his head away. His voice so small and helpless. "Sherlock. I'm ill."
Too early on the third morning (2:34 AM) John woke up feeling terrible.
"Indeed. From a very gifted individual." Something popped and sputtered in the pot and brother Michael went back to stirring, dipping the little finger of his other hand in and giving it another taste. "You swore your knighthood these seven and twenty days past, is that right?"
He settled him onto a stool and found the red kit with a white cross attached to the wall. When he'd come back to Sherlock, the detective had his hands steepled under his chin again. "Oh John, this is wonderful."
Run around sweet baby, Lord how you hypnotize.
It was not until William (a month after the Battle, after the Lady of the Manor had finally died and all the property she oversaw been inherited by her son the new Lord of the Manor to oversee) had finally drummed up the courage to pay his respects to John's surviving family only to stumble upon a heartache so piercing that he had fallen to his knees upon the doorstep.
Unlike the black and gold of Appledore's official knights who wore simplistic (yet no less stunning) battle armour, John's armour was polished silver with only the merest touches of gold to offset them. An understated construction that made it all the more gorgeous.
Somewhere around eleven thirty the LED had finally faded out and John resigned himself to simply shutting the sliding doors to the kitchen to save time. Sherlock had gotten dressed in one of his dark, trim suits and had collapsed on the couch with his violin across his narrow chest.
"J-John?"
Sherlock let the pregnant silence sit between them before looking him once again in the eye, his tone sober. Wriggling like a kid caught out after curfew. "You are correct, John. I misinterpreted the lengths at which Moriarty would go. I honestly had not expected him to involve you. It will not happen again." Sherlock fought against seeing the memory of John throwing his arms around Moriarty, fully prepared to sacrifice himself and be lost in a fine spray of gory mist.
"Friends with benefits?" John ventured, to which Sherlock scowled. "Or not..."
Sherlock's long fingers were threaded through John's hair, thumbs slung beneath his ears, moving John as if by his axis and the sheer submission required with it, enhanced by the touch memory from before, was enough to make John's knees soften beneath him. But when John tried to put his hands on Sherlock's hips for support, he found his left hand trapped behind him and a blood-deprived tug sent a shock through his shoulder.
John tongued the small defect in the same way he'd done habitually for the past three days and couldn't help but ask aloud, "how do you know it's chipped?" They were walking again.
John licked his lips. And then respun the string back on, making his final decision. "No," he spoke aloud to the empty flat. "If Sherlock wants me to know. He'll just have to tell me himself."
She looks like she would rather stay and continue to hover, but she's also smart enough to realize that there's something going on between the two of them that needs sorted.
"He was." Lestrade confirmed. Simple enough.
So John decided that he would be soft with Sherlock tonight, as soft as Sherlock could stand, because he was something infinitely precious to John and he should be treated as such.
It was the one name he'd been hoping for Sherlock to gloss over and therefore the one name he would notice.
"If you're quite finished talking about me, could you lay out his suit please John?" Sherlock's deep voice was heavy in the silence. He had two fingers and a thumb pulling the man's limp tongue out from his pried-open jaw and holding it out of the way as he probed two fingers inside. A rather outlandish scene if it hadn't been so commonplace. "Lestrade, Molly, look at this." He was pointing to the milky white residue smeared beneath his tongue.
When Harry finally drove away waving out the window. Gladstone was biting at his ankles, managing to pierce a bit of skin. John tapped the floppy thing with his cane, which it took to biting instead. The wind flapped up and brought the ocean with it.
He chastised himself for letting it bother him so much. What the fuck did it matter?
Sherlock subsided without protest. "Yes doctor." He unshouldered his coat and jacket, revealing a sky blue dress shirt impressively tucked into his black trousers and hefted himself gracefully up sideways onto the table length. Long legs dangling over the edge.
The balcony itself was a smooth, glossy stage of mosaiced bedrock. An intricate pattern that looked like a very deliberate placement of stone and yet from their vantage remained a mere jumble of black and gray.
John nodded, letting the concept seep in.
The water was so crystal clear, it made John want to jump into it and drink enough to parch his dry soul.
"Good." Sherlock smiled and then he noticed something. Something that brought a smile to his lips and a warm sensation to the pith beneath his stomach. "You've no need to stuff your codpiece, do you?"
He'd been trying half-heartedly to tidy up the flat a bit, but he kept becoming distracted by the barrier between them.
The buttons of Sherlock's shirt had been finicky and swear-inducing with his cold fingers and Sherlock had apparently lost one of his shoes to the muck, but after finally getting him stripped completely naked, John worked a shock blanket roughly over his skin, drying what he could with what he had before wrapping the Belstaff around his shoulders and tucking the heat packs into his armpits and between his thin legs, apologizing when the back of his hand brushed Sherlock's shriveled cock accidentally.
John had slapped his hand over William's mouth at that moment with fire in his eyes. Pressing him back into the tree under which they had found their first climaxes. "Don't say his fucking name! Not in my presence. He does not get to have you. Not in the ways I have. You are mine. Do you hear me? Mine! He does not get to know you in those ways."
However, Sherlock had clearly not anticipated them having made to wait once they'd arrived and as a result, the Consulting Detective was practically a live wire just waiting to make contact.
"You'll probably not even notice I'm gone. Knowing how you get sometimes." She had said, putting far more impassivity into her voice than he knew she actually felt. It had taken him far too long to understand that this was her saying goodbye.
Their simultaneous orgasms grip them utterly. Each of them crying out in ecstasy as the muscle contractions rage. John comes hard at the same time he feels the seeping heat of Sherlock's spunk spread inside his body. It is raw. It is wild. And it is wonderful.
"Certainly not. Geese are notorious for their bad defecation habits." He challenged John's dark eyes evenly. "Think logically, I can't have an animal soiling two hundred pound sheets John; your bedding is far less expensive to replace. You're in need of new ones anyway. I thought you would applaud my frugality."
"You thought you'd stick your nose into your brother's business because somehow you think it's /your/ business too? Isn't that what you mean?" John growled.
"I'm fine." Sherlock assured him as he absentmindedly started organizing John's socks by color and stopped himself.
Each footfall jarring despite the vigilant care Sherlock's giving to John's injuries.
But his stomach couldn't and it gurgled another protest to his neglect. Driving him from his office in search of sustenance, a snack to hold him over, but not before he turned the volume knob up loud enough to hear it.
Both of their breathing picked up as Sherlock disrobed him. Their heartbeats hammering. It was such an intimate act carried out with such gentleness and it made John want to cry. He was nearly naked in a stranger's room and yet he felt more protected than he ever had in all the year's he'd been alive.
She looked to her subordinate, who had said nothing throughout the whole proceeding, and she looked utterly disappointed. John assumed she wished to be looking to Lestrade, her favored DI, or even Anderson, for a defending word, and not just a faceless officer to help her if the arrest got difficult. But she got nothing in return.
John checked his wristwatch again and silently tried to figure out what extra long handles were really needed for. Deciding it was better not to ask. He wondered what was taking Mrs. Hudson so long.
"Sorry for disturbing your much-needed slumber," William said softly, taking hold of one of John's still-booted feet and shaking it lightly, "but the High Steward has requested your presence in his chambers. He'll not be kept waiting."
"Alright, alright. Don't get sentimental." John smiled. He steered the conversation back into more familiar territory. "So how'd you know that suit didn't belong to the dead man already? Maybe he bought it for himself?"
Lestrade simultaneously became distracted by something and fished his phone from his pocket, ignoring the growing rumble of the media behind them. Some were beginning to ask ignored questions their way, crowding in like a wolf pack on their prey. Smelling blood in the air.
And all John did was solidly hold in a sigh.
Sherlock was standing when they entered, his violin put away and he bowed deeply when the men entered. And then in the blink of an eye broke into perfectly fluent and perfectly foreign Japanese. If he'd had any forewarning on the matter of today's client, he'd left John completely out of the loop.
"Been a bit busy lately, what with case you just solved and all. You can't tell me you've already deleted it." John said, trying to break his own tension, finally able to turn. "It's only been a half hour."
"Is this how we're going to drum up business from now on? Chasing ambulances?"
"That's preposterous..." Sherlock muttered but John talked right over him. "What about Donovan? She'll have no reservations about telling Gregson we're here." John was trying to foresee possible disastrous scenarios while Sherlock continued to stare at the door impatiently.
It's the last thing he remembers vividly before sliding into the car.
Suddenly, the villagers who had not recognized him at his entrance, began to slowly realize just who it was that was in their midst. So changed had he been in form and figure that it took this new self-agency, this visage of a man he had once been and someone they had once known resurfacing briefly, to recognize him now.
"No. Nope. There will be absolutely no carrying." John assures him, before lifting his foot, setting his jaw, and beginning to climb.
"My arm..." John wheezes when he finally can, trying in vain to pull his dead arm to him. "M-my arm's broken."
He only /just/ managed to catch himself by instinct with a loud fistful of curtain and an angry clatter of curtain rings. Which effectively broke the spell of hedonistic solitude irreparably.
For being the master of his own fate.
Perplexedly, John found himself wanting to snap at him, to have him just say his peace and leave. John knew he did wrong and this incessant waiting for the row or the domestic or the whathaveyou to kick off would be much easier to take if he'd simply just /say it/.
His hands took no pause as they sank down towards their prize, the ribbon coming with it still looped about his neck as he never took it off. His hands were practically trembling with delight as they touched the cock cage cupped around Sherlock's groin.
"You use me ALL the time." John says with a sad smile.
To battle then.
"I mean...fuck. And do you want to know the most twisted thing about it all? That day it happened, that was the /same/ day Bill was back in Afghanistan bleeding out from a bullet. The EXACT same day. It was almost like ...like we were connected or something and I could /feel/ him dying and it woke me up." His brain caught up to his mouth, his eyes realizing that he was still staring at that flat little bud of skin and suddenly his ears smouldered with embarrassment. Embarrassment at his fear. Embarrassment at his actions. Embarrassment at having spoken the words aloud now making them /real/. And Jesus if that idea didn't seem utterly RIDICULOUS in daylight.
Mycroft's blood would still be warm as it pooled around Sherlock's head and shoulders and arse. Cradling his suddenly naked back in a sheet of red as Charles' weight pushed down on top of him, forcing him deeper into the soft wet earth, the soft wet body, the shredded armor opening like teeth around him and letting him sink into the ground. Into the blackness that rose like the sides of a tomb.
"The thought had occurred." Sherlock's light eyes flitted wildly in his head. "The truth remains, however, that we need more data. Our pusher is working quickly and it's doubtful that he's finished in his endeavors. If we're to consider his previous timeline, he'll have another victim either in his possession or chosen for tonight. We need to act quickly in order to catch him unaware."
The tone was meant to bite, but John was still trying to understand and was staring into the middle distance, his brow held in a perpetual furrow. And that made Sherlock even more edgy. He didn't want John disseminating it. Trying to understand it. God forbid trying to /fix/ it. He just wanted John to accept it and move on.
"Right, and now that you've solved it, /twenty/ years later, you've put the wind up him and sullied his reputation." Lestrade interjected. "Making it hell for me, thankyouverymuch. Did you know he's taking over anything that has the remote possibility to save face before he retires? It's a bit disconcerting that; watching an old man have to scrabble to save his career from a cock-up like that.
The large gray rosettes on his shoes shuddered as he moved, his heels clicking. His broadly cuffed hands floated delicately in front of him, fingers twitching out as though drawn magnetically to the young man inside.
In an instant, Sherlock swept towards him, completely overwhelming him. He bullied John back by climbing on top of him, lying flush against him, staring into those thundercloud eyes and drinking in the deep well of emotion until he thought he could absorb it all. Leech it from John's soul and let him be at peace.
oo2. the star-shaped cataracts occuring in a person who's been electrocuted is something that can really happen:
The illustration beneath the words was of a black fungus with a blood-fringed cap that grew out around only three quarters of its stalk. The red edge of it was thick and sloping, giving the mushroom the appearance of a horse's hoof. Its odd colours making it incredibly striking.
Sherlock felt one of his fingers dip into the soft wetness of Charles' mouth and shut his eyes. Feeling like a bag of wretched bones. Sifting through it to find what was left of his resolve.
"Oh, right. Bees." John sits back against the pillows Sherlock's mounded up for him and nods like he should know why that last statement makes perfect sense.
The predawn sky that enveloped dear London was the fitful sodalite colour of the ever-lit, always alive with electricity. And immovable in the midst of its starlessness, stood the man with steel grey mustache and the bulldog by the bus stop. As if no time had passed all.
It could not be . . . it could not be! . . . he was not important enough to be granted this gift . . .
He took residence between his Veed legs, resuming the hedonistic plunder of the doctor's eager mouth while John finished shucking his shirt, reserving special tenderness for his left arm. Sherlock used his own impossible arms to reach back and beneath, pulling off those hated socks before they disgusted him completely, much to John's amusement. He threw them with contempt at the floor, muttering. "Abominable things."
"Couldn't he have just got it back from the dry cleaners?" John suggested, his voice trailing off as he saw the look come over Sherlock's face.
"Yes. I only wanted to know what this felt like. And now I have. I'm alright if you're done after this. It's fine." God Sherlock feels HUGE inside him. Overwhelming. He doesn't mind being done. If this is the only time he gets to experience this, it has been more than enough.
"Was he the one to break it off then?" Sherlock gave a nod of appreciation to John's obvious attentiveness concerning sentiment.
"Oh! Yes. Of course. You're right. I'm sorry. I'll just--" and she bustles off, opening the front door and making sure the way up is clear from any obstructions before coming back. "Oh honestly. You two really must /try/ to outlive me." She tuts anew as they make it into the entryway. Witnessing how slowly they move.
The sixth piece he let drop straight below his hand and held his breath as the bird hesitated one brief moment before he felt soft feathers kiss against his fingertips as it stooped to snatch it up.
His cock twitched in appreciation and the warmth in his loins burned brighter in anticipation. That hadn't helped at all.
From this height, Baker Town looked as though it had been built for insects. A scattering of little white boxes with dark slashes of roads in between. The East and West Lower Rivers, which ran along its borders, snaked off lazily into the horizon.
They broke apart panting heavily.
John immediately felt himself alienated within the room of people. He hesitated awkwardly for a moment, hovering, before disappearing into the kitchen to put together a tray of edibles as slowly as he could. All the while tilting an ear towards the deep baritone of Sherlock's voice sounding completely at ease speaking in a moraic secondary language against the serious, high agglutinative morphemes of the client's. He rolled his eyes, but remained mostly amazed.
"Everything." Sherlock said gently, speaking on all the pain, all the heartbreak, all the ruin that he didn't even know was ample in John's life up until this point. "Everything you've ever done, is what you did."
John's eye crinkled in an attempt to smile, an errant tear cutting loose down his cheek when he blinked. He had to inhale and exhale a steeling breath to tell this part of the story, looking as though it was physically agonizing. "I remember Murray looking back at me and the cock was smiling. The blood had gone into his mouth so his teeth were all red."
A long white arm snakes out from beneath the covers and takes hold of John's wrist, keeping him there. "One more." And he's being pulled back down against Sherlock's prostrate body, lying flush on top of him. The kiss resumes and keeps.
"Or lack thereof." The chopsticks clattered to the table and Sherlock smiled self-satisfyingly into John's dark glare.
"You have been in pain for some time." Sherlock whispered and it felt like he was speaking of so much more.
"It's untainted."
"What?" Sherlock threw himself down with a bounce and retook his spot on his belly, facing John's feet. He reclaimed the cigarette and ashed it into John's RMC mug which he'd also snatched up in his sojourn. John looked to the ceiling for strength at the sound of rustling paper. An expandable folder being jostled open and used as a platform.
Beside him, the dentist put up his gloved fist to represent John's tooth. "Now doctor Watson, I'm just going to take you through some of the steps we're going to be doing: I'm going to clean and polish the tooth so it will give us a nice, strong surface to hold on to. The broken edge doesn't appear to need any trimming, so we'll skip that part and move straight on to applying a tooth conditioner. And after that, I'll be applying a bonding agent in multiple layers, in between which I'll be shaping the resin to replicate what's missing and curing it with this UV light to ensure a solid bond."
Were it not for the bodily evidence, John couldn't have proven that that moment had just happened at all.
CASH ONLY is scrawled across his knuckles. A spider web tattoo nets out from his temple.
John faintly remembered the grinding pain he'd endured for four hours as the indelible ink had been etched into his own arm with his tattoo. The married emblems of the Fusiliers and RAMC that he'd asked Harry to design for him before he'd left to Afghanistan. At the two-hour mark his endorphins had been depleted and he'd had to sit through the rest calmly gritting his teeth as his arm was turned to hamburger.
Excitement flickered suddenly through John.
Sherlock kept trying to catch John's eye, but the doctor refused to look at him. "Aren't you going to ask me where I was?"
For his part, Sherlock never once interrupted him, never flinched or judged as the harder and more cruel details of John's life came and went. He only ever listened, running the cloth soothingly back and forth across John's shoulders, across his ragged back, and down his muscled arms.
"Hi Miles, I'm...uh...David." John remembered his pseudonym just in time.
"And it's nice to see your leg all better. I worried about your cane and those stairs when you first came to see about the flat. It seems he's done some good for you as well." She beamed at him, coaxing the trolley further down the aisle towards the spices.
He threw another.
He kissed him until the man begged for breath and breathed for him when he tried to stop. John didn't stop to investigate the tears that occasionally ran down the man's temples. Only worked his hips more softly and made it his life's work to hit every sweet and glorious spot inside to get that mountain of man to crumble.
"Uh, nothing." John startled, suddenly needing to be in action. "I just thought I'd make a fire then a grilled toasty for lunch. Fancy a cheese and tomato?" He stooped at the hearth and set to work, pointedly not returning Sherlock's interested gaze as he barrel rolled to face him.
John made his way over to the cafetiere - avoiding the dangerously stretched cord - to where Sherlock's mug was already waiting expectantly. It was rote going through the steps to make Sherlock's coffee, but he decided for himself that it was a tea kind of morning. The good teacups were still in the drying rack, so he used one of those.
John had blinked and lost interest at some point in reopening his eyes again. She'd left sometime after with a soft kiss to his forehead that burned like a bullet never could.
Lestrade read his features and the furrow in his brow deepened. "Yeah well, trust me when I say that he didn't take it very well when you solved that cold case, Sherlock. /Especially/ without being able to provide the murder suspect. He thinks you're holding out on him due to your guys' previous ...history."
Sherlock was fully dressed in all black, leaving only the pale root of the back of his neck and long, curled hands exposed to the caustic kitchen light. His ramrod posture and the stark beauty that was Sherlock Holmes in his element did nothing to dissuade John from dropping a kiss to the crown of his head as he passed, thrilled at the pleased hum he received in return.
"What I said only applied at that particular moment in time John. But, you should know that I regret having said it. It won't happen again." Sherlock swallowed the hard knot in his throat, choking to get out his next words. "I ...value your companionship greatly. Despite anything I might say to the contrary. You have become vital to my work."
Their gold-edged black armor had gleamed brightly in the sun. Twin basalisks tangling wildly across their cuirasses.
Trying to settle his unease, John made tea.
"I don't care." John grit through his teeth.
Sherlock slid his finger across the touchpad in a huff, scrolling to the bottom of the page to get John on the same wavelength.
"Of course." John was out of his seat like a shot, following close and scanning the room as they went, watching for any and every possible threat that could leap out and catch them unawares. Not at all certain what it was he was suppose to be watching for, but certainly ready for it.
"This fucking light isn't good enough. I can't see. Can you make it to the bathroom?" John moved around so that he was able to pull Sherlock's arm over his shoulder.
"How long was I asleep for?"
But security around the Forest was endlessly vigilant. Much to his dismay, two guards had been stationed at each campfire and while one slept or cooked or wandered off to take a piss, the second took their place and saw everything.
The inside of geode is a riot of colour. Layers of orange and gold and blonde are separated with thin bands of white that radiate out from a halo of neon pink towards the inner most center. And at its very core is a burst of star red crystals which sparkle magnificently when his hand trembles.
Sherlock cradled the back of John's skull so softly in his long, thin fingers that it could have been a cut diamond suspended in the tines of a ring, but, incidentally, it was for the sake of efficiency; allowing Sherlock to position their heads in the exact counterpoint to have their salient noses slide right past each other's and strike home. Which in itself was quite impressive.
And that had been what had been most unbearable.
Sherlock withdrew like a night-blooming jasmine flower against daylight. Feeling as though John had just pierced right through the core of him into his dark, nucleic center and saw him for what he truly was. A junky in need of a fix. And John, his sponsor, who'd been there before, done that.
Sherlock pursed his lips. "Sixteen varieties of carnivorous plants, though the lot is predominantly Nepenthes and Sarracenia. I had them overnighted..." Sherlock's voice died out as John held up his hand, not wanting to spoil the tone of tonight with tangents. "S'fine."
A thousand different reasons as to why this was abseiling him this morning rocketed through his head, but he found his deeply ingrained pocket of British dignity and put his teacup back in its saucer. The porcelain clink being very  cathartic.
And as terrible as it was; it was a firm truth. Set down by decades of example.
The omissive lie he'd told John about deleting his time with Eric was only partially true, the whole truth being that his perpetual cocaine dependency at the time had left a sort of miasmal fog to the whole affair. But with Victor, his memory was steeped in stark contrast. As clear as if he'd just lived it yesterday. It was one that Sherlock both clung to and reviled, unable to redact it for fear of losing one of the most vital elements that had made him who he was.
Sherlock stared a moment, unsure how to answer, before kissing him again. Slower and longer this time. He made sure to move his plush lips in a comforting way against John's. Making sure that it did not promise anything more. He had half a mind to tuck the poor man into his bed once he pulled him from the bath.
Blood ran down King Mycroft's face while the killing weapon still stuck out from his body. The royal decree he so loathed fixed to it, flapping like a standard in the breeze. Signed and sealed in his brother's name. Slicing sharply at Sherlock's face as he bent to check his brother for signs of life, though he knew him to be dead.
John licked his lips.
He and Harriet and Clara were free now.
"A few." Sherlock said irritably, almost giving John a half-glance. "Is that a problem?"
"This will be my stop then lads." Brother Michael said as they came to the final three-pronged fork in the road. He clambered down off his horse and stretched his back, handing the reigns off to William before reassuring John that he could return the gray horse he was using whenever he saw fit. She would no doubt be better stabled at the castle than she would be here and she deserved a bit of spoiling.
"You. Leave us."
"Implicitly." John said, giving no pause.
"And I also assume that the push the murderer used took a lot of effort in order to get the victim off his feet and down onto the rails, yes? He had to step back a few paces and strike him here," he made a motion towards Lestrade's solar plexus, "low, in the abdomen. Correct?"
John cleared his throat and looked away.
John let the smile fade on its own as Lestrade's demeanor came back to sober, thinking more on the initial question. "But also, you have to look at it from Sherlock's point of view. To him, it's all about the clues. The case. It's just what his life is.
He heard Sherlock's tread go back to the door, the sussurus of his coat sliding on and the front door open, before there was a pause at the threshold. Using that same old trick. "John. . ."
"So what about this food?" John gestured to the plate.
John makes a decision.
There was but an inch of space between them for either man to lean into, but it was a testament to both their fears that neither of them did.
In a brief dance of movement, he consumed the scene with a quick shuffle of his eyes. Cataloguing, referencing, absorbing. Pale hands fluttering like nitrile butterflies. He sniffed at the body, scrutinized its suit, he shook the corpse down and felt it up. He probed inside the man's mouth and palpated on his misplaced stomach.
His transition to full hardness was quick. His member standing proudly from his body, enjoying the tickle of water down his sac as he spread his legs just a little bit wider and reveled in the feeling of it hanging free from sticky, soapy legs. He replayed the memory once more, embellishing it with Sherlock's eyes open this time and his tongue probing impossibly deep as he felt his arsehole flutter in anticipation. And then an unfathomable emptiness open low in his guts in counterpoint.
