In early September her first day at school was upon us. I was a total mess: what had I been thinking, for God’s sake? If her birthday presents could bring me to tears, how had I thought I was going to cope with
He usually has a physical map of Rome spread out on the kitchen table. His knowledge of the city is thus determined by what is contained in that image and in his memory. What lies beyond the map’s area—the exurbs, the countryside—may as well not exist. He doesn’t go there (hic dracones).
Sherlock and I had spent so long holding onto our fears, about ourselves and each other. And here we were, surrounded by proof—and I know what proof means to Sherlock—that he was no solitary freak and I no junior acolyte. Yet another thing we’d learned from Rosie: to get beyond the detritus of things past, and get on with being happy. Starting, in this case, with a wedding, and the holidays, and his birthday, and—sometime in the winter—a honeymoon.
I hadn’t realised or perhaps acknowledged it to myself, but women: they terrified me. They had a societally-dictated role, and consequently an expertise, in a set of expectations and behaviours that eluded me. The categories I did not shine in: charm. Social lubrication. Subtle flattery. Harmless flirtation. Not my area, any of it. John enjoyed the delicate dance; I hated it.
I probably shouldn’t have been surprised when Sherlock went silent after my alarm message of 7 October. I had no idea where he was, but obviously he’d had to obscure any connection anyone could make between us. Still, it was almost a physical pain to go from the certainty of an imminent reunion to limbo, from hope to terror.
. Apparently he considered St Paul’s before settling on St Stephen Walbrook. Neither really resembled the setting of the photo carved deep into my brain, but, well, they were supposed to be slightly different, after all.
I was puzzled. Sure, Rosie and I had spent some peaceful hours with Sherlock in the flat, and she’d been affectionate with him, in her imperious way—but how much could a thirteen-month-old remember about a person she’d last seen three months earlier?
I can’t bear it, I nearly get out of my chair and go upstairs. I stop myself. There may be no right way to handle this, but I have a strong suspicion there’s definitely a wrong way.
Sherlock assumes an affronted expression and says, “Please, Graham. I hardly need your help to look capable on a dance floor.”
“When you married her, were you in love with her? Or—keeping a promise? Or punishing me?” From the grim tone of my voice John must have known that while I hated to ask him this, I hated even more not knowing. He took his time answering, and finally said,
“Cleanliness, John, is next to—” I paused for a filthy swipe of my tongue into his mouth and out again. Responsive,
The audience was clapping in time and whooping as though they were watching Ireland’s premier folk group, and the band stepped up its game. The dynamic brought back what Sherlock had said about identity being at least in part a result of what was reflected back at you. John knew that was right: he’d lost his own identity more than once, and he’d been able to—he’d
“No. I was—not myself. My thinking was strangely slow. I gave you the phone without examining it. John arrived and we left shortly after.”
So it went on, two months of getting to know him, getting over my dislike, cautiously finding common ground. Without ever talking about it, we gradually went from loathing and distrust, through surprise and gratitude, to tentative appreciation and even, at times, enjoyment. Partnership.
He used to suspect that Sherlock was posing when he was impervious to outside data. “Lights on, nobody home” seemed as stagey and unrealistic as “it was all a dream.” But over the past, more intimate year, he’d come to realise there was nothing fake or forced about it: the man really did dive so deep into his thoughts that the outside world literally didn’t register. With one exception.
Standing there in just his pants, Sherlock was as magnificent as he was evidently uncertain. John couldn’t keep from kissing him but kept a careful inch of space between them while pushing him back to the sofa. “Lie down.”
It seemed I’d never get to the end of Sherlock’s extravagant forgiveness. But I still had to push at this, like a wound it felt bizarrely good to press.
An inquisitive black pony came up close for company, but he couldn’t see another living being beyond two walkers on the horizon. Going by their cheerfully coloured gear, neither of them was Sherlock, who wouldn’t be caught dead in turquoise or magenta. Well, once he wouldn’t have. Now, who knew?
. You never gave any sign that you thought of yourself as bisexual. Well, none except the way you looked at
Wednesday, the third morning after my return, he came into the kitchen dressed for work and looking grim. I handed him his coffee and he took it without comment.
Romantic entanglement would do it, John had said, adding that Sherlock isn’t capable of understanding how or why. But it’s John who doesn’t understand that Sherlock’s
He buried his face in my neck and held me hard against him. “I’m sorry, John. I’m so sorry. I never should have kept you in the dark. I knew it would kill me to lose you, I just never thought—”
“John, I misjudged everything so badly. I’m not sorry I jumped, but I’m so sorry I left you without telling you why, or that I was alive. I’ll never stop regretting that.”
Meanwhile Mary’s attentions at work were becoming almost embarrassing. She angled relentlessly if indirectly for a date, even asked me out herself twice. I didn’t accept, but I didn’t tell her I was married to my work, either. Wouldn’t have been convincing anyway, since anyone could see I wasn’t.
The small, unpretentious, but top-flight trattoria just across the street was open, and we settled in for a plate of pasta and a side dish of field greens sauteed in garlic and hot pepper.
, who mocked most of my own attempts to do so, and routinely dismissed Lestrade and his team’s abilities to tie their own shoes. I saw Donovan roll her eyes and set off after him, probably to capitalise on their newfound
“And you told him he didn’t need to be a better dancer to keep your attention.” I didn’t mean it, though. If Holmes was even capable of uttering words like that, he’d never admit it to me.
, as you put it. But once we’ve made the arrest, and the dust and the paperwork have settled, I’ll be sent back to Rome. Why don’t you come with me.”
The night had been fully as gratifying as it had promised. Unbelievably, indescribably exhilarating. In my entire adult life I had never been so fully present to my own body. It was disconcerting to recollect that in the night I had sometimes neglected Roberto, unable to lavish on him the same attention he was paying me because I was drunk on sensation, focused entirely on my own pleasure.
“Wait, wait! Should I still include the pick-up line? Isn’t it a bit too corny?” John asked while trying to hold his place but his friend only kept pushing him out until he was finally outside the classroom, “Hey, Mike! Mike!”
“Have a great time, John. Oh, and Sherlock!” Mike called before the two of them could leave, “Take care of my best friend, will you?”
John groaned and crouched down to gather the cards on the floor, “Ah, bloody hell. I-I’m sorry. I didn’t--this is so embarrassing. I’m really sorry,” John got up once again after he has finally gathered all the note cards though he refused to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
Sherlock chuckled, clearly amused of John’s stuttering mess. He shut his locker door and stared at the shorter man in front of him before speaking, “Clearly, you don’t have any plans for tonight. Want to go somewhere with me instead?”
It made John smile back sheepishly. He rubbed his nape and chuckled nervously, “Sorry, I just…you’re just…you’re really beautiful, did you know that?” John said without properly thinking, “I mean--I…you--,” he tried to explain but Sherlock waved him off.
John almost smiled widely but stopped himself and cleared his throat instead, “Come on, Sherlock. See you tomorrow, Mike!” he glanced at his best friend who gave him two thumbs up and a wink that made him roll his eyes and shook his head in amusement.
Sherlock opened his mouth and was just about to say something when John cut him off and stammered out, “Hi-uhh…did you…um-did you f-fall out of heaven,” John paused and shifted from one foot to another, “B-because you--,” the note cards fell out of his grasp because of how much his hands were shaking.
John looked up from the note card and stared at Sherlock with wide eyes which made the other man furrow his eyebrows in confusion,
The silence between them lasted for what seemed like an eternity but really, it was just for a minute or two before John heard Sherlock clear his throat and say something that made him raise his head and look properly at the gorgeous lad in front of him.
The door to the classroom slammed shut, “You can do it, John Watson! I believe in you!” His friend shouted from the inside.
John furrowed his eyebrows in confusion and opened his mouth to say something but shut it again and stared at Sherlock in disbelief. It couldn’t be that easy after all. This might be some kind of a trick.
John cleared his throat making Sherlock turn and look at him. He smiled at the other who was staring at him with one raised eyebrow. He fiddled with the cards on his hand and looked down on it for a second just to see what he should do first.
John threw his head back and laughed. He shook his head and stared at Sherlock noticing a small smile on his lips, “I wasn’t going to include it but I guess it’s okay because it made you smile,” John paused and looked straight ahead, “I love your smile,” it was then that he took Sherlock’s hand and laced their fingers together.
They were walking side by side with their hands brushing and John had too restrain himself from holding Sherlock’s hand. That was when Sherlock spoke, “You looked adorable earlier, John. The pick-up line was corny though.”
John noticed that the boy always looked bored during lectures and he sometimes caught Sherlock drowsing behind a book but when the lad was asked a question about the topic, he could flawlessly answer it despite being asleep just seconds ago.
It was Mike’s turn to sigh and roll his eyes. He stood up from the stool he was sitting on and grabbed his best friend’s shoulders to make him stop, “Will you stop that? Stop thinking negatively. Now, get out there, look for Sherlock Holmes and ask him out!” he then started pushing John out of the room.
“John Watson, I never saw you as the shy type,” Sherlock stated with a small and teasing smile on his face.
John could feel Sherlock’s intense gaze on him but he only kept his eyes in front of him. After a few seconds, he felt Sherlock tighten his grip on his hand making him smile even wider than necessary.
John tried to open the door again but his friend locked it and he couldn’t help but sigh in defeat. He looked around him and thanked god that classes are over meaning the halls are entirely deserted though he could hear a few noises coming from the field outside. He hesitated for a few minutes and just loitered outside the locked room.
He trudged down the familiar way that leads to Sherlock’s locker and almost ran back to where he was from when he caught sight of the boy’s figure turned back from him. Sherlock was arranging some things in his locker and he still hasn’t turned. It gave John a few minutes to gather his courage and wits. He took another deep breath and approached the other lad.
Sherlock didn’t say anything and just waited for him to lead the way. They walked back to the classroom where Mike was waiting for him. When the door opened, his friend has the biggest grin he has ever seen him do and it took a lot of his patience to not tell Mike to sod off. However, he did glare at his best friend and quickly grab his bag at one of the chairs inside.
Sherlock is a not-so-diligent student with unbelievably perfect grades. That was just one of the things that John admired about him. He could go on about how much he fell in love with the other lad’s bluish green eyes or how he desperately want to kiss those lips that was shaped like cupid’s bow. Add to that was Sherlock’s luscious curls that seemed to be always asking him to run his fingers through it and his almost pale and flawless skin that John always dreamed of marking.
At five, John locked the library and went to visit Molly in the morgue. He found her investigate tissue samples of rather fascinating poisoning and they spent a while chatting about some interesting autopsies she had recently worked on. She then fluently changed topic in that adorable nervous way of hers and told John about her new hobby - youtube makeup tutorials.
“This house sits on the network of disused Underground tunnels used during WWII as a shelter for the government offices. The tunnels had entrances inside of the houses that were rented by the government through some intermediary. It was vital not to be seen to enter any underground facility because it could have tipped off traitors. If you take a look at the walls in the secure room, you will find out some hidden corridor, that’s for sure. She wasn’t alone in that room, she had to be on the date.”
Sherlock became a regular at BSL. However, there was nothing regular in his habits. Sometimes, he arrived among the first readers in the morning and left only when John turned off the lights in the evening, so absorbed that he ignored everything around him. Sometimes, he came in several times a day. Sometimes, he crashed in like a madman, checked the information in one book and dashed off as if a life depended on it.
Sherlock looked at him questioningly because he knew John had just lied to them but he was curious what John is up to.
Lestrade was making phone to instruct his people, so Molly just bid them goodbye and watched them leave the morgue together.
The Barts Science Library was eerily quiet when John came in. He was the only staff, therefore it was up to him to come half an hour early every day and make sure everything was ready for its visitors. He opened the windows and let fresh air in. He could smell the rain in it but it hadn’t started yet. He made himself a cup of Earl Grey in the tiny kitchenette adjacent to an equally tiny back office. The computer on the front desk was humming quietly, as it started loading the Amlib system. John opened the book box, to which latecomers could return their books, and took out three books to check them in. Next, he went to prepare the interlibrary loans and ordered a courier to pick them up.
Like every day, Sherlock sat at the desk under the window where John seated him that first time. John gave himself an imaginary pat on the shoulder because that place offered a direct, undisturbed view from John’s spot at the front desk. He could look, right? He knew that this man was out of his league (Hell, his coat alone was worth a month or two of his rent) but it couldn’t prevent him from window shopping, could it? If somebody told him that he was developing a crush on Sherlock, John would laugh. He would laugh and then he would deny it. Because John Watson didn’t do crushes. He also didn’t do relationships. Especially not now, when it took him all his willpower to go through another day alive.
John’s protective instinct kicked in but Sherlock didn’t seem afraid, more like extremely pissed off, so he let him go. John didn’t see the interior of the car very well as it was dark, but he thought he spotted a man and a woman sitting there.
“Oh wow,” John breathed heavily, his cheeks red, arousal clearly written all over his face and body.
Sherlock broke the kiss gasping for breath but immediately recaptured John’s lips. This time, it was exploratory, he nipped on John’s lips carefully with his teeth, their noses touching gently. John moved to kiss Sherlock’s face, nose and the perpetual frown between his eyebrows. Then they joined their foreheads, resting, just basking in each other’s presence.
“Nevermind.” John snapped the photo. “All done. Just a minute till the machine prints your card. Now, what were these books you wanted to borrow? And
“I did and he was so sur-” Sherlock’s words died mid-sentence as a big black car with blackened windows pulled over in front of them. His mood changed abruptly and his jaw clenched.
John nodded. Sherlock dialled a number. “Mrs Hudson, I’m calling you to tell you I’ve decided to accept your proposal, in case it’s still on the table. I can come around at noon if it is convenient for you? Great. See you there.”
“I’m going to assault you now,” was the only warning Sherlock got before John pulled him closer by the lapels of his weathered coat and kissed him with such eagerness Sherlock dropped the bag he was holding in his hand.
“So, what exactly are you researching? I thought I would get the idea eventually but your book selection is so random…”
John tried to focus on Sherlock’s voice, which dropped lower than usual in an effort to calm him down. His touch grounded him and he gradually calmed enough that he was able to breathe almost normally.
He could do this without help. He didn’t need Mycroft’s money. True, his own odd jobs only barely sufficed for this pathetic excuse for a flat but at least he didn’t have to listen to anyone.
“Shall we order? I sweat the linguini here are to die for. Well, not literally, since dying might prevent you from actually enjoying the meal, but close enough. It’s the lamb. And the seasoning. The only one who even gets close to that is Mrs Hudson, but she was married to a mafia boss from the south of Italy, as cliché as it sounds,” he went back to rattling the information at lightspeed. It seemed to John that he wanted to cover his nervousness. He wasn’t ready to address the issue further either, so he just went on with the chatter.
The minute they were out of sight, John pulled Sherlock into an empty room, which happened to be a storage space for chairs and tables near the lecture hall.
Mike was the person who got John his job, a welcome supplement to his military pension. After he got invalided from Afghanistan, John couldn’t work as a doctor because everything connected with it, smells mostly, triggered his PTSD. In the midst of thinking he would have to leave London, he met Mike in the park. They chatted, Mike told him about the job and later recommended John to the position.
Today, luckily, wasn’t that day. Sherlock was the first person waltzing through the door, curls bouncing and John found that he was genuinely glad to see the mad genius, as he began to nickname Sherlock in his head.
He was engrossed in cataloguing the additions left from yesterday when a round head with glasses and a friendly smile popped in the doorway.
“Hello,” he boomed. Sherlock jumped visibly and bumped his head on the desk edge. He straightened up, rubbing the top of his head.
“You...Are...Brilliant,” John breathed between each press of his mouth that Sherlock reciprocated enthusiastically.
With Mike, it was even easier, a good-natured chap he was. He dismissed John’s concerns about Sherlock’s personality with a wave of his hand: “John, I teach here. I can manage one more arrogant sod, trust me. Give him my number and we will make it work.”
“Thank you, John, I would be grateful. I may have an alternative though,” Sherlock searched for his phone. “Meantime, I have to go to the morgue to pick up my bag. Would you come with me?”
John leaned over the front desk and whispered: “Listen, Molly, can you do something for me? Can you bring me a coffee from the cafeteria?”
“Let me first clarify that I did enjoy this. But what brought this on?” Sherlock inquired, his own cheeks and expression matching John’s.
John found out he liked the job. It required some moving around but not much, so he could rest his leg. The presence of books around him was calming and he also got to meet people and help them with their enquiries, which was satisfying. He liked helping people.
They continued making out as if their life depended on it until John’s hands moved lower and he squeezed Sherlock’s round arse. A startled muffled yelp interrupted their snogging and they split up.
Initially, Sherlock wanted to take the books to his flat but now the prospect of warm, quiet, nice smelling library seemed more appealing to him than his cold ugly flat.
“There is one more bedroom upstairs,” Mrs Hudson chimed in from the doorway, “but I guess you won’t be needing that.”
John inhaled sharply as the tables were turned on him. He should have known that Sherlock was seeing right through him. He suddenly found hard to breathe, as if a firm band constricted his chest. His vision swam and a wave of fear crashed over him.
More giggling. More kicks. He is lying on the floor now, curled up, protecting his head. A kick in the ribs. Every breath is pure pain.
“It seems to me you are wasting your potential,” John frowned. When Sherlock bristled, he quickly continued. “I mean, you are brilliant. Your deduction skills and all… Why don’t you work as a detective?”
John heard Sherlock’s tiny gasp of surprise and then the genius caught up. John kissed him hungrily, suddenly needing to feel he is alive. He ran his hands through Sherlock’s curls and held them firmly as he licked his way to Sherlock’s mouth. John felt the long fingers digging into his sides, almost painfully, but the pressure was welcome.
That voice. I’d dreamed of it for so long, mourned when I’d lost him. Now I could hear that gorgeous baritone in every tone and colour, laughing and rasping, cursing and imploring, and—Sherlock being Sherlock—occasionally demanding and commanding. For myself I’d never been particularly inhibited in bed, but with Sherlock I felt freer than I ever had, more spontaneous. It was ... transformative. And, I trusted, contagious.
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don’t even need names.
“Get someone to keep the kids, or else bring them. But you should be here on Friday night. Surprise her. Make it up with her.”
I told her that I'd seen a copy of the death certificate, which had shown her as signing off the medical certificate. I commiserated how horrible that must have been for her. That made her cry again.
“You had a ring on the table for her, and I blanked. I couldn’t think of anything but how to make my reappearance into a magic trick, something so unexpected that you’d be too blown away to realise how gutted I was.”
The first evening we put her in her cot, though, I found her toy box full of primary and princess colours. She’d had her elephant with her, but she was pathetically cheered to be reunited with her purple dinosaur, and yellow duckling, and the rest of the plushy menagerie. She spent an hour cuddling with John, and even with me. When I held her again I was too moved to say much but “Watson,” and “there you are,” over and over as though I’d been searching for her for months. After John bathed her she settled down into a dozy kind of haze, looking at him and saying “Da,” and at me, saying “Ba.” Which was a little eerie, when I thought about it.
Back to Uncle Google, then. And there it was, a proper if no-frills website, with photos and sample songs and everything. But the violinist wasn’t Sherlock, wasn’t even male.
It was a bit like his travels in the spring; lacking language, he paid more attention to gesture, eye contact, body language. And that was revealing.
“But I tried to tell you, too, Sherlock. Dozens of times. Hundreds.” Now his stroking hands have come to a stop, tightening on my own, then relaxing, resting there.
Though the kitchen was warm his hands were icy, his cheeks were burning, his legs were boneless. He sat down heavily, as gracelessly as he had ever collapsed, and was staring at the phone when Roberto came in. Sherlock looked up at him silently for a few seconds, then cleared his throat.
The nights were intoxicating. So were the days, as the Italian schedule of rest after lunch gave us an ironclad excuse for going back to the hotel as soon as we’d eaten. The afternoons were far more luminous than in London, and the mellow light in the room, the deepening shadows slipping along the walls, gave another intensity to the sheer stunning beauty of Sherlock in love, Sherlock in orgasm. I could watch him, feel him, listen to him, forever.
“No, there’s more. And you’re not going to like it. Mycroft showed me some surveillance photos of you. One of them, no, two of them, were fairly ... private. I refused to look at the rest.”
Not like the last couple of times I’d been, late in 2011; not as a grieving friend, flatmate, partner. I’d go back to Barts and he’d be there, in the flesh. I’d hear that voice, and see him alive, and hold him. I promised myself that if I saw him standing before me, I’d make sure he knew what he was to me. And I wouldn’t let him go off without me again. Not ever again.
In the event it was well past Monday before he could connect with an organizer. The festival was a far larger concern than John had realised, and it was still going on. He gave up waiting for someone to ring him back and began to ring at all hours, hoping to find someone. Didn’t always leave a message.
“Actually, you could. When I first met you I was beyond depressed, I was ... anhedonic. I hadn’t felt joy or hope or, or sexual interest, in so long I’d forgotten what they were. Then I met you, and I started feeling again. Literally. I wasn’t numb anymore, I was alive again and I wanted to feel everything, try everything I’d been missing. Even—well, other people. You, preferably. But you didn’t want that, and that was fine, no harm, no foul. But I still wanted to feel those things again, so I ... yeah, I started dating.”
laugh documentably attributable to Mycroft Holmes, when he saw my reaction to what Mephistopheles and Asmodeus had done to—with—
Enough. I dialed his number. That in itself might ring some alarm bells, as a cold call from me was fairly unusual.
That was, indeed, a thing. Sherlock leaving a crime scene to head off to his assignation was another level of anomaly, and it was making me more nervous by the day.
Sherlock is a magnificent liar, always has been. An escaped serial killer who targeted children—had to be an eight at least. Although we’d promised not to lie to each other and this was a whopper, all I could do was press my lips together and try not to let him see my smile.
afraid of was that he would stop wanting me, stop loving me. It had become a stupid habit, always choosing the most painful interpretation, and it hadn’t got me or us very far in all these years. He had the right to be unsettled—just days ago he was in bed with someone else, after all. (Agony to have a visual to attach to that knowledge.)
“I found I could live more happily loving you, even without hope of return, than trying to life a life far from where I’d been happy with you. At least in London I’d be able to think of you, remember you, without the distraction of another person tugging at me, and the sensation of mistreating him.”
The days and nights with Sherlock in Bologna had been the most extraordinary of my life, a time out of time. From the moment I’d seen his pale face in the dark station, every minute we’d spent together had surpassed every secret hope I’d ever had. Sentimental as that sounds.
I felt giddy with delight, with relief. John and I were talking. He’d answered in our familiar teasing code of snark, taking the piss. It took me all of twelve seconds to find my reply, from the American labour anthem “Joe Hill”:
Thank you again, Anyawen, for FTH 2021, for your plot bunny, for gently dissuading me from a resolution too hurried. Your "John has to work for it" plot bunny has plenty of scope for someone else to take it in a more angsty direction, in case this one was too placid for a Queen of Whump!
His racing brain stutters to a stop, empties out. White silence. In that silence John’s voice echoes:
,” pointing with his chin at the nocturnal city around them. There are people out walking, all staring, but more at their clothing than their embrace. Sherlock ignores the attention: they’re welcome to gape at the man beside him, he understands the temptation, is proud to be the one holding him. He’d be staring himself, but for now he revels in the warmth of John’s tight arm around him, publicly possessive.
?” It still felt odd to speak Italian to him, but he wanted it and I’d seen how responsive he was to it, so I meant to get used to it right away.
“It’s not funny, you know. Not funny at all. That poor kid. He was already the runt of the litter, and they were all locked up in that barn with the brutes outside armed with rocks and bricks—”
It seemed likely that only Moriarty’s own direct reports, and the heads of his far-flung mob branches, knew anything at all about John Watson. I would simply eliminate the heads, expecting that the Greek myth of Hydra would apply: heads might multiply but they’d compete, and they’d know nothing about Moriarty’s sick vendetta against me and mine.
is even more than any-any-anyone that you adore,” Sherlock dances Donovan backwards and, incredibly, down between his legs only to pull her up again once he’s swung a long leg over and reversed his position.
And he did. Oh, he did. First he flushed dark red, and then, literally, he went white. “Is—that—what he thinks? That I’m ashamed of him?”
It was round the solstice, just before Christmas. And I realized I'd completely forgotten to get the shopping in. Nowadays you
Once Sherlock had come to in the oily, icy bilge of a cargo ship hold, it had taken him precisely 43 minutes to organize the other eleven men and boys into a ragtag resistance—despite having no language common to all. The plan would have worked, too, but for one generous, confident, daring young man, a boy, really. He’d caught Sherlock’s eye with a conspiratorial glint, tilted his head toward the guard with the gun, and created a diversion that allowed the other captives to jump the man. But not before the guard had slid a knife between the boy’s ribs and into his heart. Sherlock had held the boy up as he died, the light fading from his bright blue eyes, his face and physique and hair so like John’s, what John must’ve looked like twenty years ago.
Moving into Roberto’s flat had been easy, that first morning. Needing to get to work, Roberto had gone quickly through the logistics. Keys. Phone numbers. Map. Meeting time and place. Things to know about the flat. Dull. (Was everyday life always dull? Was it always going to be dull? Had it been dull moving into 221B?) (
I did take it up with him later, and he did work on the case, but for Rosie's sake in complete confidentiality.
—She moved away half her life ago, love. She doesn’t need us to move there and stare at her as she starts
Though it sometimes required some fancy footwork. The morning after we got married, for example, I was plucked out of bed (after a
He had laid it all out in a kind of Snakes and Ladders itinerary around the sitting room, which became navigable only via a series of irregularly placed lily-pads—small bare spots on the floor where John was allowed to step. It hurt to watch Sherlock agonise, propose, revise, reverse, and start all over again agonising.
Well, it wasn’t competition-level dancing, but we did well, and we had fun, and we set a bar that relaxed everyone else—win win win, in other words. And Holmes, reluctant though he was to even brush my bum, managed to keep my skirt in place, so I didn’t have to show off the goods to the whole room. When we danced I could see something in him he didn’t share anywhere else, something that made John’s devotion make sense. It was good to have him as an accomplice rather than an enemy, for sure.
The breath rushed out of my lungs as I realised for the ten thousandth time how much I loved John, how perfectly his strong suits compensated for my weak ones and vice versa, and how unfazed he was by being married (
He had no eyes for the other pedestrians clutching each other, equal parts horror at the hit-and-run and gratitude for their own escape. The figure on the macadam, supine and unmoving and terribly small, too small to be an adult, oh God no—but yes, an adult female, he could see as he knelt in the fast-spreading pool of blood. Early thirties, dark blonde, dressed like a uni student, the helmet coming apart around a face miraculously untouched.
Holmes and I got together occasionally to dance; tried to set up a semi-schedule, but one of us was always busy on a case. Eventually he just said, “let’s text when we see a window, and try for every second and fourth Thursday. I do want to get our
The first time I heard Sherlock play the violin after so long, so painfully long, he played it for me and Rosie. For the most part she settled in easily at 221B; she was an easy child once she got over crying at night. But one afternoon in early April I came home, and as I came round the door Sherlock had just picked her up off the floor. He was wearing the warm blue woolen dressing gown we’d bought in Bologna. He caught my eye and winked but his face stayed impassive, even solemn, as he turned her to see me.
And damn it, again he didn’t answer the following Sunday, leaving me on the edge of a full-blown meltdown. My nerves were coming through my skin, and Baker Street was a prison; I managed to restrain myself from contacting Mycroft in case someone was watching for me to do so.
I got home around seven and Sherlock and Rosie were holding dinner for me. He and I tended to eat earlier nowadays, and we unfailingly got Rosie to bed by 8:15 or so, to have our evenings.
I fought down a spurt of righteous indignation. Because I’d been jealous myself, and the feeling is its own punishment. I remembered the time Sherlock had voluntarily shown me a text string, with Zanardi. I could have done the same with this one, even without knowing he’d seen part of it. But I hadn't, because I’d sensed he’d use it to discredit not only the school but the whole
Their winter coats were a godsend, concealing their questing hands and the palpable evidence of a wholly mutual arousal. Roberto’s hem at mid-thigh covered Sherlock’s right thumb and two fingers closed loosely around Roberto’s frankly
Horrifying. The reverse of a tapestry. I never knew—no, I never thought—what this “suicide” would look like to John. His life had been my only consideration. Not his heart. Not his peace of mind.
“I don’t know why you can’t apply those observational skills you’re so proud of to your own behaviour, your own damn
I sat there in 221B and thought of everything Sherlock had stolen from himself when he jumped. Everywhere my stunned stare landed: something he’d lost. His music. His research. His collection of oddities. Outside the window: his city.
It was Rosie’s doing, of course. She didn’t know he had a “thinking machine” reputation to protect, so she always just charged right in, didn’t defer at all to his image. Then she'd tug and nudge until he caved, looking very gratified to be forced to do what he wanted to do all along.
(Johnlock writers: please feel warmly invited to add one of your one-shots to the collection if you haven't already.)
Aislinn Riordan emerged from the shadows behind the stage and made her way over. She held out a hand and said, “You must be John from London?”
! I mean, not the way you think. It's better than that. You know how we’ve said, now and again, how much we missed Sherlock, and wished he were still here, still with us.”
As years passed without a slip-up, I started to relax. A bit. Rosie knew we had a job that entailed stopping bad guys, and she knew we were sometimes in the press. Her school friends knew who we were, but a couple of kids in her year had
“You’re ... what you’re ... I ...” Roberto’s voice was faltering along with his words, and he didn’t seem able to move except to brush Sherlock’s flies just as lightly.
Somehow it helped, just a little—knowing it was a thing, this being left behind by someone who offed themselves. Someone dearly loved. I went looking for more music about it. Easy, when you put your search terms into YouTube. Found a whole album, practically, on the first try. “Sweet Old World.”
I saw him consider that, and I recognised my part in making him doubt that I meant it. He looked at me in silence, his expression sad now, no longer angry but somber, and finally he sighed and said, “You have to, Sherlock. You have to let me in. And trust me. Treat me as an asset, not a
I didn’t really notice the violin at first. But then there it was, a low hum beneath the dulcimer, then all at once taking up the melody so strongly and sweetly that the dulcimer-man started playing a harmony instead. It made the waltz  even prettier, with the the long rich lines of the violin like a velvet ribbon, and the bright notes of the dulcimer like ice crystals.
. You weren’t interested, and I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable. By raising the issue again of me being interested in men. In you. —What? What is it? Look at me. You’re making me nervous. Will.” (
John’s trust is breathtaking, after all the times I abused it, on a case or on a whim. Damn it, I feel weak enough to cry, and lean in to kiss him.
I spent a month not looking at John. Staring into the middle distance. I didn’t touch his phone for weeks after seeing that woman’s first message string. I didn’t want to
The Registry office was already doing us a favour by giving us the last slot of the day, bumping us up in the queue; John was keen not to keep them later than necessary. No written vows then, thankfully. No music, no photo sessions; the photos of John’s first wedding were stored safely in an album for Watson to see, one day. I didn’t want a rival set.
In the meantime, I was on the alert. No texting John, no going out, no violin or even John’s MP-3 player.
The doorbell was ringing when I finished, but had stopped by the time I shrugged into a bathrobe and pulled the door open. No one was there, but a floral delivery the size of a very large dog was sitting in the corridor. It couldn’t be—
There is truly only one disadvantage to our move: it will be a bit harder for Rosie to get to us from Italy, and for us to get to her; London’s airports were convenient that way. Visits may be longer for that reason. It’s hard to believe that the UK was still firmly part of the EU when she was born! The post-Brexit years have been frankly bizarre; none of us know what will come of the new political configuration, which I for one did not see coming. We’ll have to reserve judgment, I suppose.
I had a restorative shower, then did a few blog updates while I ate the excellent curry he’d ordered in. The terrible action film was actually funny, and I was almost surprised to hear Sherlock coming back in as the credits rolled.
After three hours of wandering we turned back for home. We hailed a taxi and sat, silent and weary, until we reached his front door. Once in bed we had sex, lazily and without urgency, Roberto kissing me deeply, intensely, while he murmured words of love into my skin and my mouth. Words I did not deserve, and received with unease because I hadn’t yet managed to fan my fondness into actual love. Once I’d thought it might come. It might yet.
“Lucky for me, then. I wouldn’t have found you, else.” And he tightened his grip on the hand in his own.
“But I’d hear Rosie gurgling to herself in her cot. Before she gets properly awake and impatient, she babbles. I’d listen a moment, and think,
He shaved off his moustache. Mary said it was because Sherlock had mocked it, but she was wrong. It was because the moustache went with his new life, and Sherlock had made a mockery of
Before I could say anything, though, Mycroft said, “I think you were right to warn him. The acceleration of his work seems to be pointing to an imminent dénouement. He was in hiding in London when you alerted him, and he vanished immediately, went underground without a trace.”
“No. I wouldn’t insult your intelligence by thinking that humiliating you would scar you for life if you weren’t instantly avenged.”
’s timeworn joke fell a bit flat, the family naming lore was defusing the tension that my demonstrativeness had created.
And now: Valentina’s shy approach. My impatience, masked. Her feigned nonchalance as she asked if I had time for an
Before evening came I ordered take-out, texted John to pick it up on his way home, and cleared some space on the table to eat it. No candle. Shame. One day I was going to light one with every dinner. Not for romance—for the privacy it creates. A circle of light, more encircling than sunlight, more restful than lamplight. One day.
Christmas with John is the epitome of our life together. The essence of the two, no, the three of us, distilled into our signature extremes: the delightful and the exasperating, the riotous and the serene, the affectionate and the ravenously passionate, the transcendent and the embarrassingly human. Our month of December rescripts all the Decembers we lived before we became what we are now.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
Oh golly, a little melancholy. Well, that creeps in at the holidays too, I guess. Fortunately the rest of the series is cheery ... mostly. ❤️
Sherlock had imagined a hundred scenarios for his first orgasm in John’s presence, each one more expertly calculated and smoothly executed than the last. He’d drop gracefully to his knees and open John’s flies eagerly, fluidly, take him into his mouth with a self-assured competence that would conceal how limited, and how long ago, his experience was. Or he’d let John take them both in his strong, sure hand and bring them to orgasm together, kissing and gasping and licking as they came. Or John would open him with exquisite care and enter him with one swift, claiming stroke.
He was hunched up against me with his head nearly under my arm. Past the cloud of his dark hair I could see, if I moved carefully, his shoulder and scapula. I was right: they were indeed slightly more rounded than the last time I had seen him. In light of his eternal war on food,* I had to admit that the month in Rome had fed him up. (Again, the jagged knife-edge of jealousy.) As for his war on sleep, that remained to be seen; but the current position was encouraging.
Now wasn’t the time to think of that: now was the time to take him to bed, to take our time, to tell over the ways I loved and wanted him, to tell him without words. I let my hand drift down to his gorgeous arse, cupped the left cheek and squeezed it hard, and in the mirrored wall of the lift I saw the flush deepen on his face as he swallowed hard and turned to cover my erection with his own hand. He let loose a small moan when he felt the proof of my arousal, and so did I when he began to run his thumb up and down under the seam, whimpering (he would later deny this) at the throb and leap of my response. God, I wanted him.
Sherlock tightens his lips and takes a step toward John. Time for the big guns. “I thought I was fulfilling my own responsibility to your daughter by doing nothing that might deprive her of another parent.”
It was immediately clear that John Watson was a rival, and a formidable one. He didn’t look like it at first: on the short side for a Brit, on the shady side of forty, and not especially prepossessing in appearance. But he had a powerful presence that Dr Hooper was certainly deferring to, and between him and Sherlock there was some kind of force field that made them into one unit. It was a strange kind of energy, though, as if they were both positive and negative magnetic poles at once—both attracting and repelling.
) to an erratic genius with bizarre blind spots and incapacities. And for the hundredth time I thought of his vows.
“So, Moran’s out there, and he’s gunning for you.” John’s voice was thoughtful; then he snorted. “And Miletić? Seriously? Are
It wasn’t that I was ashamed of Sherlock. Not in the least. But it was going to be delicate, introducing a male partner into my family with no such precedent in my life—and particularly delicate for the children. Adolescence is hard enough without the homophobic scorn of their peer group.
“Why aren’t you bored? You used to always be bored, or at least you were always saying you were.” My tone is deliberately sardonic, I’m hoping he’ll take me up on the chance of a good squabble.
Ten weeks spent traveling the world had enlarged his musical tastes, and the programmes on different musical idioms were even more absorbing than interviews or radio dramas.
The night had been fully as gratifying as it had promised. Unbelievably, indescribably exhilarating. In my entire adult life I had never been so fully present to my own body. It was disconcerting to recollect that in the night I had sometimes neglected Roberto, unable to lavish on him the same attention he was paying me because I was drunk on sensation, focused entirely on my own pleasure.
He didn’t know how but he was sitting on the kerb now, staring at the blood in the street, so much of it, how could he have thought she could survive losing so much? The heap of mangled metal that was her bicycle—the impact that created that was the same that shattered—he couldn’t think about that, his mind veered away.
Mycroft’s lead petered out within two weeks—fortunately, because on September 23rd John again raised the emotional temperature by several degrees with a very encouraging
Before I could even wonder whether he might be the same with me, he added almost curtly, “I don’t want to talk about this. About any of it. Anything I say, you might apply to yourself. To you and me. And it wouldn’t be the same. I’d rather... start fresh. It’s completely different with you.”
“Shhhh. Relax. Not that. Not you, at least.” At this John, with some effort, glances around confused and looks his question.
Sherlock lowered the violin and turned away from the window, visibly relieved that John had understood. “It’s foolish, but I find myself ... concerned ... that this version of me won’t
in Belgravia? Was John referring to his blog again? To my long period of mutism after the Adler case? Christ. I had no idea where to even start.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
This whole evening has something of the surreal about it, John thinks, tugging uncomfortably at the black tie at his neck. He doesn’t like formal dress, though he can carry it off reasonably well by adopting a more than usually military posture—but the tie he flatly loathes, and he tortures it at every opportunity. Why he and Sherlock have to be part of this absurd charity do at the Met is beyond him. They don’t socialise with Lestrade’s colleagues, most of whom think the consulting detective and his blogger a dodgy pair at the best of times.
to the door, and her legs are strangely coltish and uncoordinated. Strangely, because earlier she had no difficulty maneuvering in those shoes even in complicated dance patterns. Instantly the song’s forgotten.
Obviously not all of our firsts could be happy. We also had some bleak anniversaries to mark, or as Sherlock always put it, to overwrite. The date he jumped off the roof at Bart’s—for over two years that was the anniversary of his death. Mary’s birthday came and went, or at least the date she told me was her birthday. The date of her death, which was much more certain. Even the day Sherlock and I had met had been overshadowed by the same day last year.
“Couldn’t have gone better. Seems no one got away and no one was seriously injured.” Sherlock had noted only a couple of smallish bloody smears on the floor, clearly from fists, not firearms.
I like a wuthering height as well as anyone. However, I have not yet deduced why we are climbing one in early December, through four inches of snow (only getting deeper as we gain elevation), in temperatures which, while not life-threatening, are nonetheless more likely to prompt yearning for whisky and a warm fire than any sense of exhilaration and accomplishment.
“You were trying to save her. You were wrist-deep in her blood. And it wasn’t even your business, let alone your job, you were just there by chance. It’s shocking to watch someone die at the best of times. But it’s harder when you’re

” He touches Sherlock lightly on the sleeve. It would perhaps have been a better save, had Sherlock not simply looked at the hand on his arm with detached interest.
“We still haven’t seen the Ca’ Rezzonico with all the ...” For the life of me I could not call to mind what we were supposed to see at the Ca’ Rezzonico, despite having been the one to insist on it.
Sherlock is up at once, since the bed is now an odious and useless piece of furniture. John clasps his waist and his hand, pulls him in close.
The ballroom is filling up, the tables around the dance floor small enough for conversation but large enough for conviviality. John hovers near the bar, still not fully resigned to this bizarre waste of an evening. They get so little down time, and for his part he’d have written a sodding cheque for the privilege of staying home and watching bad telly with Sherlock’s icy feet thrust obtrusively but not uncomfortably beneath his thigh.
“Was it stupid, stupider, or stupidest?” He asked without malice, given that I knew his opinion of my taste in films.
“I was saying ... get ready to be cold again for awhile.” With that I climb on top of him, lower my head to cover his mouth with mine, and delicately lick along the underside of his top lip, then suck it into my mouth. I cannot
The waiter had already brought over a chair. As Roberto settled into it—leaving his overcoat on, I was glad to see—I asked, deliberately, “How did you find us?”
“Those things I wrote. On the blog. I only put them in to balance the moony things I said. “Charismatic.’ ‘Fascinating.’ ‘Like a drug.’ I’m sorry. I was embarrassed to be so—” His eyes narrow and I can’t find my words.
I’d gone a month without a word to or from John immediately following his wedding. Two months after Mary’s death. Month after weary month in the years after I jumped. But he’d always been with me, on my mind nearly every moment, as present as when he was just upstairs at Baker Street. Now I was evicting him, and if I wasn’t quite sure how to do it—if I’d lost the habit of drawing each breath utterly alone—well, I’d known solitude once, and I would learn it again.
and a liqueur. Roberto looks relieved, but nowhere near so relieved as Sherlock feels. They have two cars to drive to the family’s country house, and Elena’s barely opened her mouth to invite Sherlock to ride with her when Roberto asks if he would mind driving. Sherlock, who knows to a milliliter how much Roberto’s had to drink, appreciates being rescued from a more private, and thus more uncomfortable, interrogation.
So I breathe deeply in and out, counting breaths and suspending the exhale, until I feel muscles release and melt one at a time and then I’m in a beautiful green tunnel, a kind of holloway with green light and green shade all around. I feel John’s hand in mine, but I’m so busy looking around and ahead, and squinting against the light flooding in from above, that I don’t really see him. Still it’s his hand, compact and callused, that I know as well as my own, and I hear his voice, though I can’t make out the words. I can hear the smile in his voice. That’s all that matters.
Any one weird circumstance could have had an innocent explanation; two was a stretch. All of them together: what kind of an idiot did he take me for?
Returning to London had initially meant hunting out a place to live that would be close to hives. Until Mrs Hudson found out, when she let out an uncharacteristic screech followed by an incredulous, “So you think you can just waltz back to London and
In the middle of the night Sherlock woke to find John by the sofa, staring at him. Just standing there. By the light from the bedroom he seemed to be wide awake, his smile a bit awkward.
I suspected that Sherlock hadn’t briefed John, hadn’t included him. So later that evening, after eight, I texted John to tell him where and when, adding,
At that John’s face relaxed a bit and he said, “I’m glad. You left London and … I wanted to find you. Took me a couple of weeks to cool off, and by then you were gone.”
Too, at a certain point I realized that she was better than good on the little electronic keyboard he’d bought her. She often used her little pink earphones when she practised on it, and if I gave that any thought at all it was to be grateful to be spared the cacophony of a new skill and new pieces. Sherlock was teaching her, and he said they weren’t ready to spring anything on me yet, but they were actually practising a duet for piano and violin.
He’d come back to London defeated but not actually hopeless. None the wiser about where Sherlock might be, unless he counted his now substantial list of places he wasn’t.
So, I took out a calendar and started planning a real schedule, to add to my visits to Ella, to the shops, to Sherlock’s grave. Performing grief was surely still necessary, but it was time to perform it for a larger audience.
no. On the contrary, I had the presence of mind to shout at the cabbie, which was very practical and productive, I’m sure.
They were looking at autopsy records when I got there, and I noticed with a shock that Sherlock didn’t really look at me, didn’t acknowledge me. Certainly didn’t introduce me. Molly looked flustered and stepped outside, so I thrust out my hand and introduced myself:
, Sherlock. It was the luckiest day of my life. Until it wasn’t. You ... I never thought you’d send me away. As though I were nothing to you if I couldn’t be your partner. Colleague.”
The journey had been costly, but not a waste. Certainly not a failure. He had Sherlock back again in a way he hadn’t before, when his brain had been scrambled first by grief and guilt, then by hurt and outrage. And he was clear to himself in a way he hadn’t been in—perhaps hadn’t ever been.
. Always paid attention to his surroundings—things, places, people. (At least when he was out in the world; in the flat was a different matter, in the flat he used to be able to tune everything out.) During his years away that level of attention to detail had become hypervigilance. Obsessive, on the edge of fear-tinged.
The cabin was tucked just below a ridgeline, protected from the wind and exposed to the south. Times he heard nothing at all but the wind rushing overhead, passing him by on its race inland; or the birds in the early morning; or his own fiddle, as he worked and worked on mastering a new musical language. New intervals, new finger positions, a new style.
If I’d had my phone out I’d have taken a photo: Donovan actually smiled. A wide, rueful, confidential smile that was the reward of my candour. I’ll have to tell John. Sometimes I can make a connection by being honest, where he would have advised me to be tactful. For a moment she was comfortable.
Summoned back into the conversation, he looked up and said stonily, “No. It wasn’t I who called you in. Check with Gavin.”
Expert string players and fans: on the im/possibility of a violin having a recognizable “voice,” do hold off until Ch. 5?  ♥️ 🎻
He stands there motionless, in relief and disbelief, John’s hands on his lower back. His own hands slide from John’s face to his arms to his hips. The Belstaff muffles every sensation but the solid, tangible presence Sherlock now finally holds close. John reaches up to draw Sherlock’s neck down and bring their mouths together. Softly at first, then more firmly, surely, their tongues meeting and gliding.
Mycroft had hinted that John too should share information, and seemed unsurprised at the noncommittal answer.
I lay quiet, considering. Still stiff as a plank. Considering. If my nightmare was all too transparent, where I was lost in a wilderness without him as the world became uncontrollable, his was equally so, where he had to save a helpless child and I was apparently useless in the endeavor.
“Now the visibility was getting worse, but I could make out a couple walking toward the shelter, through the red sand. As they got closer I tried to ask them ‘Where is this?’ or ‘Where are we?’ but the words wouldn’t come out, I couldn’t breathe, and the wind was blowing so hard it was pushing me along the accumulated sand on the roadway as though I were dune-surfing.”
“Then listen. We’ll get something in to eat. John’ll be home soon, and we’ll eat and talk and catch up. And you, in the meantime, don’t call home. Don’t have any painful conversations long distance. That never helps, beating a dead horse on the phone, or videochat, or whatever. Just text Ciaran to say you’ve got here, love to the kids and greetings from us, you know. Whatever you have to say to each other can wait until you’ve both cooled down a bit.”
no, I hated it, it’s why I left.” That made me laugh out loud: something we’d always had together, from that very first evening at 221B.
He evicted that unwelcome distraction by taking Sherlock in his arms and kissing tenderly across chest, nipples, and throat, murmuring words he couldn’t swear made any sense.
But reluctantly I leave him in the shower and step out, dripping onto the mat and towelling vigorously before going into the bedroom while he does what I asked him. He’s private that way, I’m learning, and that’s fine. (
Something was hovering at the outer limit of his attention, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
“What is this, Sherlock? Please tell me what’s wrong, so I can fix it. I can’t stand for us to be like this.”
As the agents dispersed Lestrade introduced the stranger, one Roberto Zanardi. Close to, he seemed even taller, his stare even more focused. He was unusually well dressed for a policeman, Sherlock thought, but then he was Italian: attention to presentation was something he’d always appreciated about Italy, along with the music, the coffee. As he shook hands he inventoried the man: early forties, recently divorced, at least two children, perfectly bilingual and bicultural, a British—ah, mother.
“Nice to see you too, Sherlock. Thanks for coming.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at the wry twist of Lestrade’s mouth, and didn’t answer.
He went to work half-expecting Sherlock to turn up. For real this time, not like the old man with the saucy videos whom he’d taken for Sherlock. But no, just the usual run of patients with the usual low-key health worries, enlivened with one quite serious knife injury. (Why on earth had a four-year-old been playing with a serrated knife? People
“You’re thinking about Roberto.” I say his name for the first time in two months. So much for a marriage proposal.
“That was his decision. His terms. I am to have no knowledge of him or contact with him. In exchange, he has consented to check in once a month. Not directly. On a public message board on some ridiculous social media platform. On the last day of each month my assistant is to post a coded message, to which he says he will reply.”
When I was little, we had a sacrosanct ritual for Christmas presents: one on Christmas Eve; stockings on Christmas morning; and one tiny present one each of the Twelve Days of Christmas. And when I say tiny--it could be a pencil sharpener or a glitter-glue pen. Unbeknownst to my younger self, Ba in particular waged guerilla warfare against the aunts and grandparents, to keep them from spoiling me and Christmas with gift inflation.
“Yes, but remember what I promised when we married: I’d put you and Rosie first until she was grown up, and after that I’d put you and me first. And I don’t think that you and I will really be better off moving to Italy and becoming our grandchildren’s nannies.”
He looked completely wrung out. Although we heard nothing but quiet snuffles from the baby monitor, it was close enough to Watson’s hour for waking that by unspoken agreement we pulled on our clothes from yesterday and went into the kitchen for coffee.
When John came home, Watson was napping and a morose song by Georges Brassens was playing low in the flat. Minor key, lugubrious lyrics by Aragon, pessimistic premise:
How could he have thought he could improvise this degree of intimacy, just because he’d found Roberto attractive? How could he have thought he could be ready to change everything about himself? If this is what John meant would complete him as a human being, he wants no part of it. It is false, it’s futile, and it is hurting a very good man.
It felt like just a moment before he was lifting his head from Sherlock’s shoulder and stepping back, feeling hot with embarrassment and drawing breath to apologise.
Nicola was smiling even more warmly now, and said she loved it when parents were supportive of their kids, and proud of them. It gave children such a head start in life, she said. It was sad when they only got real affirmation at school, it made them imprint too much on their teachers. She
shine in: charm. Social lubrication. Subtle flattery. Harmless flirtation. Not my area, any of it. John enjoyed the delicate dance; I hated it. I’d overheard any number of examples of coquetry that got under my skin—though I never responded aloud, of course.
The phone rang, and rang, and rang. I rang off and tried again. Still no answer. Half an hour later I dialed again. This time the call went through.
“Ha. They wouldn’t part with that for twenty thousand pounds.” But it was a thought. Just one high-fee case would cover its purchase and delivery. I felt an unaccustomed rush of avidity.
I was taken aback, though thrilled; never thought he’d offer to leave 221B to even sleep over at mine, let alone move in. I mulled over the possibility, visualising Sherlock standing barefoot in pajamas and dressing-gown in my drab kitchen, and found the idea incongruous but also somehow right.
I’d studied the Oratory of St Lawrence, interior and exterior, in all the detail available online. Layout. Architectural history. Restoration. Decoration. Iconography. But nothing actually replaces physical presence. Outside, the building is an exuberant hybrid of styles, and its façade commanded my interest for several minutes. Not only pragmatically, in terms of the theft of the Caravaggio, but artistically.
The last prompt of this Advent calendar will post on Christmas day, not the 24th. But if you haven't seen
People in the recovery business always say that a change of address is no way to address the changes that need to be made. And that’s true, for most people. But they weren’t most people, and a change of venue had been almost exactly what they needed. Leaving London had banished old habits and patterns and stressors; it had given them a new dynamic and a new breadth of possibility. It had shaken loose the constraints that accompany the expectations of friends and family.
“I did forgive you. I do. But you’re her only family, and she’s always going to come first. She has to. You can’t expect Lestrade to expose Watson to losing you.”
“Of course I do. Having you here has been good. It’s what I missed when—when I was away. Before.” He shifted left to look straight at John.
Our conversations were the other half of the understanding we were building together. Even the hard ones were helping us to see how adamantly we’d always loved each other and how much we always would. He asked questions I couldn’t always answer, and was unexpectedly patient when I asked for time to think them over. Like when I’d acknowledged I was bisexual, and what that meant for my feelings for him, which I’d fought and denied for so long.
Halfway through a warm September evening I went to my bedroom and chose clothing that would be both seductive and suitable for dancing. I straightened my hair with a citrus-scented product and gelled it, combing it back from my face. John looked startled, unsurprisingly, to see me in a silky black t-shirt two sizes too small, with skin-tight black leather pipestem trousers (not sure about those, but he looked frozen as he stared at them). Blue-green color on my eyelids, even a hint of glitter.
He looked thoughtful, not jubilant. “Most definitely a group effort. Perhaps the largest of my experience.”
And just like that my heart is pounding. Whatever John has in mind, I want. I want without knowing what it is. But first I have to give him something, and there’s no way to do it without utterly killing the mood.
. I don’t get along with anyone, John. He’s fine as an editor, but I hardly want to socialise with him.” He flicked the television on but muted it after a moment and went on talking.
Once you called me a conductor of light, not luminous myself but enabling and channeling illumination. It wasn’t much of a compliment and maybe it wasn’t meant to be, but it made me think about all the ways I see
But something noisy and official was happening just ahead of us, outside the affectedly tasteful Gritti Palace Hotel. There were sirens, and flashing lights, and dozens of uniformed officers swarming the place, and
“What is it, then? I mean, if you want to say. I don’t mean to push.” And I really didn’t. I felt as though I had to take one half-inch step at a time to avoid having him shut down.
John’s face turns away from me a little. He doesn’t want me to see his expression. The silence goes on just long enough to make me uneasy—ah. Of course.
They’d finished their second pint and were saying goodbye when Sherlock texted to ask for an ETA so he could coordinate their takeaway delivery. John resisted the urge to ask if they’d be two or three to eat it.
I didn’t know what to expect of an Open Day, but we got to Rosedale so late that there were no children left on the premises. The rooms had been divided up into years, and we went to one of the Reception classrooms to see a short presentation and then meet the staff who had set up at different tables. Each table had information on a few of their initiatives and procedures for early childhood education.
At the safe house—a small row house in Camden Town that stood out only for being utterly nondescript—I gave Will Simpson a basic exam. Apart from mild dehydration, his physical condition was good enough. His state of mind, though, was pitiable.
“Never been happier to be outclassed,” says Greg, grinning at John. “Sherlock never fails to surprise me, but Donovan—who ever knew? And Sherlock and Donovan
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
demanded attention and care. A puppy was the very definition of needy, and noisy, and affectionate, and fun. Just the distraction the dads needed, when I left for Italy in mid-January.
for us: Met officers on one side, members of his homeless network on the other. He whirled back round to face the inside and compose himself. Then he turned back to walk down the steps with me, smiling and wincing a bit at the paper confetti being thrown at us. Just behind us was Mycroft carrying Rosie, quite unnecessarily. They were followed by her train of admirers, like some suite of attendants for a young royal—he would say “general.”
But she wasn’t Sherlock. And now that I knew he was alive, he was almost all I thought about, waking or sleeping. Every Sunday I came to life again. At first, I was just so happy to be in touch—no matter how obliquely. But week after week it became more clear to me that what I was feeling was not what I’d felt for Sherlock before—fond, exasperated, admiring, protective. There was definitely
Sherlock just got up as if I hadn’t spoken, saying, “So we’re to be at the container dock at midnight, in case things get started earlier than planned?”
“I’m hoping you’ll make up for it back at the flat.” He tried out a leer but apparently wasn’t very good at it yet, or hadn’t mastered the timing, because it fell quite flat.
And from then on, it always was. Every Sunday was an anniversary, and those first few were indescribably precious. The Christmastide washed over us gently; it was our respite, and the calm before the storm of Sherlock’s return going public. The following week, the 23
Back at the flat, with Ash again crashed in the guest room upstairs and everyone else gone, they settled in on the sofa and John again managed to surprise him.
We settled on early February, from the 4th to the 12th, so we could be back well in time for Watson’s fifth birthday. John was delighted that our stay would overlap with the opening of Carnevale; I was much less so.
Then again, he wanted to put his mouth to pretty much everything he saw. The graceful fingers pressed together against lips both etched and plush. The lashes sweeping against high, sharp cheekbones. The hair, rather long at present, which John knew (from checking for fever) to be as soft as it was thick, and which had been forcibly ruffled. The shoulders, square and strong. The—
“Sherlock,” he said now, and Sherlock knew what it meant, as he always had known: “we’re this now,” “we were always supposed to be,” “I’m going to make you happy too,” “thank God you’re here, with
“Perhaps his survival is also his penance. To be responsible for so much loss and sorrow would surely be enough to make a man hate his own life.”
I’d directed him to Giulia’s violin-maker to lease a violin, and in the time it took him to play one piece to establish his skill level Benedetto had decided to loan him, free of charge, an early eighteenth-century Italian instrument. No fancy maker’s name, but to my ear at least an excellent sound. So he was always playing. He must’ve seen the sheet music for cello and piano and worked out that I was the pianist, but he never suggested playing together and that was fine with me. It’d been years since I’d played with Giulia, and Sherlock was far too good a musician for me to start again now with him. But I loved to hear him.
“By then Wiggins was there as Mycroft’s proxy, John. I wish you’d asked him, if not me. That bloated bureaucrat managed to get Wiggins on his side, probably paying him more money than he's ever seen before. And there’s no gaoler more implacable than a former ally.”
John is so angry that he’s stomped off to bed. In his old room, upstairs. Closed the door with an ostentatious click that’s worse than a slam. He’s never been able to sleep when he’s this angry, and he won’t this time either. His heart will pound, his mouth will harden into a stiff line, his back muscles will tense. His shoulders will knot until he gives himself a headache. It’s useless for him to fling himself into bed in this state.
“So, tell me about your eyes—why d’you wear contact lenses? I almost didn't recognise you.” He didn’t mean it; he’d have known Sherlock anywhere, known him with unshakable certainty. The embarrassing misstep with the old patient of the saucy videos notwithstanding.
“No, of course not. You’re not a narcissist, anyway. You just like to play one when convenient. I’ve got your number.”
The contrast between autumn and winter was electrifying. He was alive again, his mind ticking over smoothly like a racing car in perfect condition. When Lestrade had called him in on the copycat case he’d had a spike of hope that it would be equally absorbing, equally distracting. That it probably wasn’t, he’d known as soon as he saw the familiar tattoo on the body. It was clearly an attempt to throw the police off the track, but Sherlock had identified the murderer through the abundant forensic evidence.The universe was rarely lazy, but killers often were.
Indeed, sooner. They’re there in minutes, in front of the darkened flat, John paying off the cabbie while Sherlock unlocks the front door. His hand’s unsteady, and he thinks of the scratches he’s leaving on the keyhole as he carefully pushes the door open. Mrs Hudson’s windows too are dark; they have to be quiet.
what he’s here for, after all: to hold John in his arms and make him understand, with tenderness, and visible desire, that they’re made for each other and it’s time they got on with it. Time to be brave, he tells himself. Time to be honest.
There were so many things to like about Roberto. He was clever, easy to talk with. Sophisticated, cosmopolitan. Smart. Unusually educated compared to his opposite numbers at NSY. Decent and humane, completely dedicated to taking down a criminal network he considered to be a cancer that was rotting the European Union from the inside.
As it turned out, we didn’t leave for Sicily until late afternoon; night still fell too soon to make it worth arriving at 5 or 6 p.m. After a wobbly start, our last day in Venice was memorable. John reserved our Palermo flight and hotel, and rescheduled our return to London.
The muffled clatter of energetic breakfast preparation, a heavenly waft of sausages. Whatever emotion, whatever tension had gripped John the night before must have dissipated.
I made myself remember that the life I had, the life I have, is a known quantity, and the one I would have had with Sherlock is an imaginary perfection. For all I know, it could have been a misery; we’re neither of us easy men, after all. But I had wanted it, so badly.
“Yes, but. I went looking for you. Not just this past spring. When you were dead, I went to your grave. I made a little speech. I actually spoke to you.”
Ten minutes later I'm silent, only stroking Sherlock’s tense back steadily, slowly. “Colleague.” “Spectacularly ignorant.” “Annoying dick.” “Machine.” “Drama queen.” From the man who routinely called me “idiot,” demeaned me to our acquaintance, mocked my love life and my writing—it was unexpected that these words had hurt him. But they had. These, and a hundred others.
I picked up my fork and poked at my starter, some random collision of soft goat cheese and lavender confit that didn’t go very well together.—French food. For God’s sake. They never can let just one flavour occupy the spotlight, with some supporting actors propping it up. They always have to serve up a plateful of divas.
she seems capable, confident. As though, unlike an ordinary courier, she’s been briefed as to his appearance as well as his location. Sherlock doesn’t respond but she keeps her arm outstretched, confirming his deduction that this is one of Mycroft’s minions, not a commercial driver. Somali mother, he thinks. Italian father. Raised and educated in Milan. No, Pavia. Came to Rome for—irrelevant. He rolls his eyes ostentatiously and sighs, reaching for the envelope.
I slipped out of bed and went to the wardrobe to get my gym bag. I always kept it packed with fresh workout gear, and I went into the kitchen to dress and put on my trainers. When I put on my winter running jacket I went to the stairs, listened to be sure Rosie was still sleeping, clicked the door of the flat closed behind me and flung myself downstairs.
“Robbie, darling, I’m well. How are you? And you must be Sherlock.” She answers her son in English, seizes Sherlock’s shoulders enthusiastically and kisses both his cheeks with perhaps more emphasis than a first meeting would normally merit. She’s nearly his own height, and her jaw-length hair, mostly grey, is trimly cut and styled. She wears makeup and a well-cut suit of a deep raspberry raw silk.
The first night we came here—and being here again made it seem just days ago—I was so wound up with hope and tension and lust that I thought I would come just from Sherlock’s hand grazing my skin. Everything he did, and the thought of anything he might do, intensified my trembling desire: I didn’t last long that first time, and neither did he, we were so very past due for lovemaking.
By 8 o’clock they were all ready for a meal, and the usual debate was gearing up about what kind of food to order in, or whether and where to go out, when John (genius John!) announced they’d be eating at the Chinese round the corner. Remembering how noisy and wired they were after a rehearsal, John had reserved a back room where they could continue the bickering and brainstorming that made them all equal partners in the band’s creative profile.
He looks away and ploughs on. “Don’t ever think that I have, or that anyone has, the right to hurt you that way. You never—you always—oh, fuck it. Sherlock: you think you made a mistake that got Mary killed, yeah? Something I’d be right to blame you for. Well, you didn’t. Mary’s past got her killed, and it was always going to.”
“It looked like a good fit to me. On the human level, that is. Good facilities, more green space than I expected. Lots of play-to-learn activities, like music. Small enough classes, and focus on developing the whole child, not just the skills bit. What did you think?”
I could hear him smirking. “Almost literally, I’d say. Certainly systematically. He obtained the death certificate from that pathologist friend of yours. You were so sure he wouldn’t pursue details that I didn’t waste resources building an airtight illusion around them. I believe he’s learned nothing concrete. But he must have gained the sense that concrete information which should be available, is not.”
“Well, who ever knows, right? But he told me he found it flattering—he may have said seductive—to be wanted like that. I said he always has a trail of admirers drooling after him, men and women. He said that a man who wants another man and isn’t afraid to admit it, isn’t something you find every day. I think he meant Roberto isn’t ashamed of him, or ashamed of wanting him.” I looked at John, meanly hoping he would feel the implied comparison.
But the fact that they’d been the ones to make Italy my favourite place didn’t make it any easier for them to send me there for years on end. Da had been hoping I’d go no farther than Oxford or Cambridge; Ba held out secret hopes for London itself. So Salerno was going to be hard on them.
It was ridiculous, and embarrassing, that a few simple words could set off fireworks in his chest and weaken his knees. “That, and more.” He had to take it in stride: despite John’s warmth he was under no illusion that he was that man anymore. Anyone’s best friend.
A delighted grin crinkles around John’s eyes as he looks up at Sherlock. “Really? Me too! Seems a bit fond and foolish for
“Treat him well. If you don’t, I will personally rip your head off your shoulders and shove it right the fuck down your throat.”
Well, that did it, didn’t it. Again tears welled up in Sherlock’s eyes and he turned to hide them. There was no emergency here, none but his need to have John close as long as this benumbed and volatile state lasted.
I came to consciousness with a thrashing jolt and stared about me, disoriented. Then levitated out of my nest and staggered to the bathroom, desperate to relieve my aching bladder. It must have been a
Surprised into laughter, Sherlock felt a rush of gratitude for this kindness but took care not to let it appear as encouraging warmth. He showed Julian down the stairs to the street door and forgot about him before he’d got back upstairs to 221B, texting John and then ordering takeaway from the Thai round the corner.
Sometimes I drank. Tea. Whisky. Tea again. Beer. Whisky again. I don’t remember eating. What was brought me I didn’t look at.
Ah, fantastic. A precocious cook, then, too. Time we got this girl into a proper school before she ended up with her own Youtube channel.
“It’s me. Checking the hives.” The Montbretia rustled and fluttered, its spectrum of yellow and orange intense in the evening light.
“What?” She looked both wary and game. It was Donovan’s best face yet. I was surprised to find myself pleased that she was back to her old self again after this conversation, which couldn’t have been an easy one for her.
“And you’re sure it hasn’t?” He only tipped his head, the way he does when he thinks I’m being thick, but refrains from saying so out of politeness. (Sherlock never refrains.)
had been recommended to me by an acquaintance in Anagni—with the caveat that it was heated only by a wood stove. I was undaunted; I’d lots of experience getting a country house comfortable with wood. And the prospect of being somewhere completely isolated, where we couldn’t be overheard in bed, was magnetic: Sherlock might feel able to let down his guard a bit.
Then this morning, reading aloud to Rosie on his lap. He often reads her things she would never understand, but she loves to hear his voice echo in his chest under her ear (like father, like daughter) and she loves to be included in whatever has his attention. The syndrome is one I understand perfectly; though he doesn’t read me articles on advanced toxicology with my ear pressed to his torso, I almost wish he would.
They made love, they dozed, they woke and tried to convince themselves to sleep but ended up making love again, they rested, they fondled and nestled and stroked, and only truly fell asleep at dawn. And to think that he’d resigned himself to being, at best, not-unhappy. He was going to have to figure out what would keep John with him for good, waking like this every morning.
I wrote “ANNOYANCE is an emotion.” with the day’s date and time. That one I stuck on his bedroom door.
of his tin ear that his brother had got piano lessons—no. His parents had barely accepted his second disappearance. It would only destabilise things to reach out to them for any reason, but especially for something so trivial, so random. They would only fuss.
Amid the expected explosion of hugs and tears from my mother and Mrs Hudson, Mycroft absconded with Watson. The flurry of dressing for the December cold kept me from noticing Gavin holding everyone back from the door, forcing John and me to go first. We stepped out onto the steps to see a small crowd of thirty or forty people lining the staircase: to our left a large group of Met officers, to our right, a clutch of members of my homeless network.
“I wanted to say. The guv told me something you said to him about me, something really decent. D’you really think that?” She looked up now, and held my eye.
So I deliberately blurred my mental focus. The most observant man in the world, he calls me, and I turned that faculty off. I saw only cases, and Watson. Watson, and cases. And I turned away from him.
“In spite of yourself.” He translated exactly what I’d meant, flashing a smile as he held the door open and shoo'd me through it.
From here on in, POV alternates between Sherlock and John, with a horizontal line indicating the shift.
My feelings about her very complicated parents transferred to her the moment I took her, literally, from her mother, in a gesture Mary made of forced trust and ruthless conquest. My feelings about Mary were as complicated as her kaleidoscopic personality.
When the band started up again, John was surprised to see Ash sitting in the audience beside Ciaran, instead of on stage. Patrick picked up his guitar, leaned into the mike.
“No, seriously, look at the stars!” John’s insistent voice breaks in on his thoughts. His eyes locked on John’s, Sherlock answers, “I am looking at them.”
“I’ll tell you what else I didn’t know you had in you.” I was pleased with the smooth segue, but I still felt nervous bringing it up.
“I Get A Kick” comes to an end and there’s applause, then a pause as dancers go for a drink, check in at the bidding table, listen for their numbers on the loudspeaker.
His last answer made me decide to move from the small chair to the bed. I wanted more contact with him. I stood and poured us each another dram, then took off my jacket, then my shirt.
Watson and I had a quiet afternoon after I picked her up at daycare. She was more active than ever, and curious beyond her expressive capabilities; it made taking care of her more stimulating, and more tiring, than when she was little. She didn’t have my complete attention today, though; I was thinking not-precisely-happy thoughts about whether or not to tell John about the messages from Roberto.
“She missed her nap. The delivery came today.” That was touching, too. Sherlock sleepy doesn’t do connective tissue.
only get better and better. He would do such unexpected things: write on pub coasters, or paper napkins from airplanes, and tuck them in my pocket. Things he sometimes finds it hard to say. No accident that he’s a writer.
Another thing I learned: Sherlock is in fact above taking advantage of my anxiety and guilt. He really is kind, that way.
There’s something about shared genetic material: voices can blend as though they were the same person overdubbed. Patrick and Ash, despite the difference in vocal range, dovetailed until John could not always tell one from the other.
advanced for her age, and why had I ever thought it was a good idea to send her to school at four-and-a-half?
in the government and will pursue that lead aggressively. Mrs Simpson’s murder will be a separate if related criminal case, for which you Sherlock will be one of four witnesses.”
This concludes Part 2 ("Wanted"); Part 3, "Entwined," begins with the regular posting schedule on Tuesday. Thank you, gentle readers.
gone away voluntarily—there had to have been an overpowering reason for doing that, and for not telling me. It’s not as though he didn’t care about me, or imagined I didn’t care about him. He knew what he meant to me: I’d killed for him, offered to die for him.
John reared back a bit, well and truly unsettled. Sherlock admitting to fatigue was only marginally less bizarre than Sherlock needing time to think.
Too many clothes. I pulled back and stripped off my shirt, heard his laboured breathing stop a moment (I’d never quite understand his reaction to my scar, but so be it). Swung a leg off to get rid of my own trousers completely, pants and all, and then to tug his down and off. He’d gone completely silent but in the absolutely good way, the silence not of cold distance but of rapt surrender to a wave of sensation. I knew him now, what he was feeling was as clear to me as my own experience. It was the same sensory feedback loop that had made lovemaking matchless from that first time, in this very bed.
We pelted into the house and pounded up the stairs. I raced for the shower since she was due back home in about 7 minutes. I shoved my fouled clothing into a bin bag for the moment and sagged in the luxuriously hot shower, watching what blood was on my skin swirl down the drain.
“One of those terrible, pointless deaths after a night out clubbing. Jamie was in a car that was hit by a young man who’d had too much to drink. A head-on collision on a country road. The only survivor was the intoxicated driver. I will never stop hating him for it.”
Of course there are more innocuous decorations, a sketchy little wooden violin, a crystal cadeuceus, a few stars and other celestial bodies. But anyone who really looks can see the mediaeval representation of a scorpion, another of a snake—you know, the classic friendly beasts at any nativity scene.
“Thanks.” His voice was neutral. No, worse. Distant. Damn. I’d wanted to be wrong about that, but it appeared he did have morning-after regrets.
Startled, John looks up, but Greg is already following Molly with his eyes again. John can’t blame him. Her slight form, her handsome gown, her slender neck holding her head high—she looks like a princess in a Hollywood film. Sherlock’s smiling down at her kindly, not tenderly but affectionately, and again John feels a rush of pride in him. Sherlock’s being truly generous with her now, careful not to put her out of countenance when she’s so uncertain of her public persona.
Our daily texts had tapered off to a few times a week; I was almost always unavailable when he invited me on a case, and I always blamed the lack of childcare. What really held me back, though, was the fact that Wiggins was still to be found so often at 221B. And Sherlock never texted me first unless it was about his work.
I thanked Fred with all the earnestness I could spare from the task at hand, which was to get Sherlock cleaned up and comfortable and settled as soon as I could. Fred, bless him, said, “You need a hand here? Would it help if I took Rosie over to mine, let her play with the kids for a couple of hours? They should be back in—fifteen, twenty minutes.”
that wasn’t your fault, I was wrong ever to say it was. I thought—tell me if I’m wrong here—I thought you’d forgiven me for saying that. For thinking it. So why are we
And wonder of wonders: lying arse-up on the bed, wearing nothing but a tiny smirk and seeming hardly to feel the chill, was the wonderful man who’d prepared all those clues for him to wonder at.
I run my hand over my own jaw and mouth. Indeed there’s a bit of a burn, but not enough to cause this midnight hygiene mania. “Well, don’t do it again. My face isn’t that tender.”
Sherlock nodded, still silent, but his stare was fascinated and desirous so I thought maybe this was just how he was about sex. Or about sex with a relative stranger. He’d open up, talk to me, as we got to know each other. But sucking his cock was so intoxicating, so thrilling, so novel, that I didn’t feel anything missing, and his responses though subdued were enough to reassure me that this was what he wanted too.
. This was becoming intolerable. Awake, Roberto was affectionate, discreetly so; asleep, he was invasive, possessive. Sherlock felt trapped, unwilling to awaken him, less from consideration than from anxiety that a discussion might result. In the dark it was so much more likely that words would come out, creating confrontations that waking life with its urgencies and distractions made it easier to evade.
“Time for me to be off, General. Your fathers will be with you tonight. Don’t let them talk and giggle all night, they need their sleep.”
I had to sit tight and hope. Respect his terms. Spend Zanardi’s “probation” month trying to make the time pass, keep the dread tamped down, and most of all, keep the jealousy suffocated.
So, off to a third office. Said I was looking to lodge a complaint about rough treatment I’d received at the scene. The youngish lawyerly type said she’d e-mail her colleague in HR a list of the staff working that day and let him handle it according to hospital regulations.
He looked struck, as though he hadn’t made the connection. “Maybe I could. God knows general practice is boring beyond belief. —So you don’t want me working with you?”
, and returned to my solitary life as a solver of puzzles more interesting than himself. (As though such a thing could even exist.) Solemnly, and humbly, and simply, he stood there and asked me not to leave. To love him.
They glide over to the balcony doors and slip outside, leaving the door ajar, hearing the music muffled just enough for conversation. The late autumn night is cold and the shock of it draws them even closer together—and doesn't
“Ash. You’re not the first married person to have a fling, and I promise you won’t be the last. It happened, it’s a shame, you’re sorry, and it’s over. You can both move past it.”
In the event I ended up putting the children off for their mid-month weekend. They weren’t bothered, though I’d been away for so long, and although it was unfair of me I felt a little wounded that they weren’t more eager to come over. But I joined them at their mother’s for a leisurely Sunday lunch instead, and they were so affectionate that I felt reassured. I decided I could introduce them once Sherlock had decided to stay, and make it up to them then.
, stammering out her embarrassed demurrals even after John’s out of earshot. She’s still wittering on when they reach the dance floor and Sherlock, tired of it, sees an opportunity.
“Get in while it’s hot. And God help you if you go anywhere. If you disappear on me, I’ll beat you to a goddamned pulp.”
I didn’t want things to change, and I didn’t want things to stay the same; if they did change, I didn’t want us to fail: my whole life was bound up in Sherlock. And I didn’t want to be that dependent, that connected. That vulnerable. I didn’t want him to be dependent or vulnerable, either. Oh, I was in a fucking stew. It didn’t help that the next day I kept getting distracted at work, daydreaming about Sherlock rescuing Sally Donovan in his ridiculously sexy get-up.
And I would fairly reliably stew about it, in my head talking through the likelihood that he was ... getting off on a regular basis. If he was, who with? Why was it so... scheduled? It only seemed regimented, though: the days and hours varied every week. Only the duration was stable: about three hours.
to see him. When he did come, their conversations had become careful again, avoiding any assumptions about the future. They’d contained little ease, and none of the snark that always meant security and stability between them.
Lestrade had won my second dance, and he was in very good spirits, spinning me once and then again, looking to Dr Hooper to see if she was impressed. I warned him I was going to dance with her later in the evening, she looked so irresistibly sweet. He was so gone on her, it was endearing. Lady Gaga stopped singing, and I made for the loo.
“You do know the only reason I haven’t already tackled you is that this is our local café and I’m fond of their all-day breakfast?”
, and you didn’t tell me. You can’t keep things from me anymore, God damn it. Whatever else happens, Sherlock, you have to promise me: No. more. lying. We’re better off as a team, we can’t be deceiving each other and keeping each other in the dark.”
That night and the next morning I fast forwarded everything for him with the paperwork, the permits, and the pathologist. That got me
He came home from his walk with a plan half-formed; a request (rather, a demand) outstanding to his brother for certain surveillance photos; and a new timer and remote command to attach to my camera.
Moriarty’s vicious crime cartels one by one. Probably without anyone beside him who could shoot his way out of a wet paper bag.
It isn’t that our planets finally aligned, or anything irrational like that; it’s that we finally worked up the nerve to risk a rebuff. I did it, in a letter of farewell; John, in a letter begging (
We start to jog, then trot, and then we pick up the pace until we’re at a dead run. Are we racing? Why are we running? It doesn’t matter, really. His hand is in mine the way it was when we were handcuffed together, that time. That was one of my favourite sprints with John. This is another.
“After the big trafficking case wrapped up in 2016, I was reassigned. I had my pick of cases, in intellectual property piracy, tax evasion, and money-laundering. I’ve been concentrating on cases connected with big money, high social status, high visibility. Last night was a very high-profile arrest. It required a glare of publicity, lots of Finanza in uniform, media coverage, and resulting public humiliation for a prominent drug manufacturer.”
I turned the topic to her favourites, asking if she would be amenable to having John and Watson live with me in 221B. At this she went, predictably, into high gear, listing all the things I would need to change, provide, organise, adapt, to make the flat ready for Watson. I’d already done a fair bit back in the autumn, but there was a great deal more to face, and it sounded frankly tedious. Nothing for it but to ring the abominable Mycroft, endure his oily and insincere congratulations, and have him turn his minions loose on the task.
“I’ve been thinking that it might be good for Rosie to start school in the fall, you know, Reception, instead of waiting as we’d meant to until first year when she’s five and a half.” I found myself rushing a bit, an invariable tell for nerves.
was in some ways a classic nativity scene, in others pure Caravaggio and no one else. Standard: the Angel announcing the birth to the shepherds; Mary, Jesus, and Joseph; the ox and ass; an attendant shepherd; the two saints framing and observing the scene, their impossible presence in the picture plane representing both their contemplation of the scene and their proximity to Christ. Ubiquitous in Christian art.
Until the Hell-Hounds. Watson managed to select two demonic beings cunningly disguised as puppies to pour onto our bed in the middle of the night on Christmas morning. We did not at first discern the diabolical glint in their eyes, or we might, as she feared, have returned them to the shelter on Boxing Day.
“Well, could be worse. It’s not Tristan, after all. Or Terence.” Sherlock’s voice was vague, though, as though his mind was elsewhere.
Tried to compose in his head. Surely he could do that, in silence and stillness. But the sounds pulsed through his body, through his veins, pushing against his bones, his joints. He couldn’t stop the pain, no it was just an itch, no it was agony.
“Right. First: is there any causal connection between this murder and the November killing? If there is, is the victim’s nephew part of this organisation? If so, the nephew is still guilty; if not, he’s not.”
John thought and went to put the kettle on. Luckily it wasn’t one of those modern supersmart beeping beasts. He didn’t want to wake Sherlock up yet. His face was calm, the perpetual frown that wrinkled his forehead gone. His lips were partly open and John could hear him snoring lightly.
In a few long strides, the stranger was at the front desk. John stood up. The first thing he noticed when the stranger came closer, was the curls. Because seriously, they couldn’t be overlooked. They were sticking from the man’s head in every direction and looked as if they were still wet from the shower. When the smell of soap reached John’s nostrils, his hypothesis was confirmed.
John wasn’t fooled by Sherlock’s flippant behaviour. He went to him and looked into his eyes properly. They were wide and full of hope. He put his hand on the side of Sherlock’s neck and, stroking his jawbone with his thumb, asked quietly: “You want me to live with you? As your boyfriend?”
Eventually, Sherlock stepped away from the corpse and smiled smugly, before promptly rattling off his deduction:
John stole a glance or two and then turned to today’s task. He postponed this long enough. He eyed the trolley stuffed with leather-bound tomes and then looked at the place where these books belonged. Up. Way way up. Like 13 feet up. BSL was an architecturally interesting place (translation: it was a bloody nightmare). For the most part, it was a regular room, but it had a big nook that reached to the second floor. Two sides were walls mounted with shelves and two were glass panels so that the people sitting in the hospital cafeteria on the second floor could have a soul-elevating view of the old books when eating their croissants.
Sherlock took his time with the shower so when he stepped out of the bathroom, a heap of wet clothes in his hands, the takeaway just arrived. John waved at Sherlock to put his clothes on the wall-mounted dryer in the bathroom and went to get the food. They sat on the old sofa. Sherlock was still shaking a bit and John put an offensively orange blanket over him.
Try as he might, Sherlock couldn’t extinguish the warmth he felt every time John complimented his intelligence when they got to chat about something random.
The next thing John noted was the determined and a bit intimidating expression on the stranger’s face. And the set of sharp cheekbones. And his beautiful eyes, the colour of which John couldn’t pinpoint.
"If you check security cameras of place where the victim was, she must have been on a date with the woman before. I would start there if I were you.”
“She was found in a locked secure room in a jewellery shop. Single fatal wound, she cracked her head on the table edge. Here’s the address and a few pictures of the crime scene,” he took them out of an ordinarily-looking manila envelope and spread them out on a table. “They’re calling it an accident, except the angle is weirdly off. There’s literally nothing she could have tripped over. So how did she die? Who killed her?”
“No form, no card. No card, no books,” the librarian said and pointed to the nearby table. “You can sit over there. Come to me when you are done and I’ll take your photo.”
He didn’t seem angry but Sherlock checked just to be sure, lowering his voice: “You really want to know?”
Sherlock didn’t know what he expected but he sure didn’t expect this and he felt his cheek warming. “Do you think so?”
Holmes recited the titles again, marginally slower, and John checked them in the computer. “We have four of them here now, two I have to order from the storeroom and the rest we don’t have but can get to you through interlibrary loans in a few days. Will this be okay with you?”
The librarian’s eyebrow shot up. “Whoa, slow down, please. First, I cannot type that fast; second, can I have your library card?”
With a resigned sigh, John handed him the book and quickly found out that if he got in trouble, it would be definitely worth it. From his spot on the floor, he had a perfect view of Sherlock’s long legs in fitted trousers. When Sherlock climbed up and down, the muscles on his thighs moved in the most interesting way. And God, that ass! How somebody so thin could have an ass so round, was beyond John.
In the cab on the way to Marylebone, Sherlock told John why Mrs Hudson offered him a special deal. It made John alternate between shaking his head and giggling uncontrollably. However, the lady greeting them at 221B Baker Street was nothing John had been imagining and he immediately liked her motherly attitude towards Sherlock. She made them tea while they were exploring the flat. Hired goons were just leaving, having unloaded the boxes with Sherlock’s belongings.
John stared at Sherlock in utter amazement for a moment but it wasn’t possible not to laugh at the sight of it. Soon they were both giggling. Sherlock recovered first and, wiping the tears from his eyes, said: “I have to admit that Angelo is anything but subtle.”
The tall man looked sheepish for a moment. John found it incredibly adorable. “I have to admit I got carried away. They are amazing. But I know they are involved in something! I just don’t know what. They shouldn’t be so widespread. I wonder if we ever get racoons, now that would cause an uproar!”
At the elementary school, the head librarian hated him because he returned his books constantly late and damaged. In fact, that didn’t change, he was the same at the university. He may have paid more for the library fines than for his tuition. The librarians looked the same too. He could swear they were clones but so far he had no proof. And now he was about to meet another one. He shuddered but steeled himself and strode in.
John pressed on Sherlock's shoulder to indicate he should sit back down. “No need. Here, I made us tea, you must be thirsty. I sure know I am.”
“He made his move and they kissed,” John chuckled. “You were right, he is right in the middle of a divorce. But he thought he doesn’t have a chance with Molly. When you left, he comforted her and well, you know...”
, John thought, moving the trolley back to the front desk. He would really want to thank Sherlock but how?
They looked at each other, smiling. It seemed that neither of them wanted to go home. Sherlock got up first.
“The tunnels check out. One of our PCs has just filed a report about them, an architectonic marvel.” He checked his phone and continued: “And the victim was found on camera having a romantic dinner with another woman. Your story checks out. My guys have been on this for 36 hours now and you figured it out under ten minutes. How the hell did you do that?”
Sherlock leaned forward, animated. “The police don’t consult amateurs, John! That’s why I’m writing my book. To prove myself, make myself known. I have a website and I sometimes get to solve a case through it but it’s not enough. Also, I tend to discourage potential clients, you know,” he gestured to himself. He suddenly had enough of self-probing: “And why are you hiding in the library?”
“Oh! It’s for him, isn’t it?” She chuckled. “I have to say you have a good taste, he is handsome and kinda cute! Look at those curls!”
That's all, folks :) thank you for reading and for leaving such lovely comments. We hope you enjoyed reading the story as much as we enjoyed writing it.
In the morgue, Molly was busy examining a new addition to their corpse collection. She waved them in. Sherlock was shifting uncomfortably, his coat was still a bit wet and he was aware of the residues of mud that he couldn’t brush off properly. He was also feeling weird being here after the yesterday scene. John elbowed Sherlock into his side and gave him a pointed look.
“Alright, so how do we find the other woman now? If she came from the tunnels, it could have been from bloody anywhere.”
He descends into the darkness of the basement floors of his Mind Palace. He doesn’t try to turn the lights on, there aren’t any there. He walks slowly through the corridor. It isn’t visited often, the air is stale and stinks.
“Oh, God forbid that I would get a thank you,” John huffed but it didn’t sound angry. He pointed to the kitchenette with a kettle, some chipped mugs and a box of PG tips. “In case you want something to drink. Now, I really have to get back to work. Let me know if you need anything.”
John just grinned mischievously. No way he was going to reveal that it was the displays of Sherlock’s competence that affected him so.
Sherlock managed to get on his feet, albeit quite wobbly. He was shaking badly. John supported him from the side and let him through the entrance. They took a cab to John’s flat. Sherlock was silent for the whole journey. The driver wasn’t happy with the drenched seats but John placated him with a big tip.
Molly considered it for a while. “John Watson, you’ll owe me so much. But I think you’d be really cute together, so I’ll figure something out. Can he work with an unconventional schedule as well? I mean, there might be visits from the police - but they usually visit during the official office hours, so if he’s a night owl, it might be possible to arrange something.”
“Oh. Err… not exactly,” Sherlock mumbled. “I meant to tell you yesterday but then all Hell broke loose, so I quite haven’t got a chance.”
“Possibly. Given the place, I presume a business deal had gone wrong. I would check moves on her bank account and the cash flow. I don’t have enough data, however, I guess the victim and her mistress had a deal, diamonds possibly, then something went wrong and the victim wanted to sell the other short. Her lover knew about the hidden entrance, maybe used it for the secret meetings with the victim. This time, they argued, one pushed at another, the victim fell. Her lover panicked and left through the hidden corridor.”
“What part of ‘I’m not moving into that posh house of yours’ didn’t you understand?! … No. … No! … Don’t bring mommy into this, Mycroft! … All right, forget I asked for anything!”
He looked around properly and found only one free spot in the middle of a group of students. He felt sick just from the thought of working there.
Sherlock scoffed. “I’m not good with following orders and obeying superiors. I like my freedom too much.”
John was still blushing when he reached the Barts main gate. But he felt really good about himself. He was so deep in his thoughts that he hadn’t noticed a big black car parked at the gate until a beautiful dark haired-woman got out and held the door open.
“But isn’t this much better? How about you move in with me? The rent will certainly be much better if we share!” he shrugged nonchalantly.
He leaned against the wall and slowly slid down. Another kind of darkness, void and voiceless, claimed him.
“Oh,” Sherlock couldn’t wrap his head around that. “But I… That wasn’t my intention, I just wanted him to shut up and I did what you told me not to, so I disappointed you.”
He was grateful to Mike. Not only for the job but for his good-naturedness and optimism. He was always there when John needed somebody to talk to or to go for a beer with.
“Mycroft’s people, don’t talk to them, they might eat your brain, John, and then use your corpse to smuggle spies and secrets abroad,” Sherlock told John in a mock whisper. He whirled in the middle of the sitting room. “So, what do you think?”
They looked at each other, not moving. Then Sherlock did the most unexpected thing. He began to laugh. There was a rumble in his chest and his shoulders started to shake. He pressed his mouth into a thin line as he tried to suppress it but soon the laughter overcame his defences and bubbled out.
“No, that’s fine. You didn’t know. Hell, I didn’t know either,” John said shakily. “I mean.. I know my triggers but this was so unexpected…”
“Hey, I haven’t seen you drink anything all day. You can have a cuppa here, you know. Do you realize that the brain is a goo that works on water? Here, you must be parched. And err… thanks for earlier.”
John sighed and rubbed his eyes. “All right, grab your books and come with me,” he said and led Sherlock through the small door to the back office.
Then Sherlock shifted and John found himself breathing against Sherlock’s chest. He was enveloped in a warm embrace. He snuggled into it. He felt something akin to a kiss in his hair and smiled into Sherlock’s collarbone. He nosed his way up on Sherlock’s long neck, the tip of his nose hitting Sherlock’s chin as he slowly raised his head. Now would probably be the time to stare romantically into each other’s eyes but John ditched it in favour of going directly for Sherlock’s lips. The way Sherlock had been snuggling him back gave him hope that the kiss wouldn’t screw everything up between them.
When Sherlock woke up in the morning, he found John looking at him with revering expression as if he couldn’t believe he was really there. Sherlock felt the same way. He couldn’t understand that John hadn’t kicked him out, that he wasn’t mad at him and Jesus, were they really snogging like teenagers? He blushed.
Sherlock arrived at the library already annoyed because he had another phone call with Mycroft, this time about Mummy’s birthday celebration. His brother didn’t forget to remind him to get a haircut and to dress properly. “I’m not a child, Mycroft!” One day, he would actually smash the phone.
Sherlock didn’t reply, he didn’t even move. John quickly checked his pulse and breath and, relieved, searched him for injuries, finding none. He grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him firmly. Sherlock groaned.
Sherlock stood on the pavement in front of the Barts, fists and teeth clenched, heart pounding. His vision blurred. The world was rendered to shades of black and grey. He started walking. He didn’t know where he was going. His legs carried him through the city with only enough mental presence left not to be run down by a car in heavy London traffic.
Sherlock knew that he shouldn’t say that but couldn’t help himself: “You’re an Army doctor who has been invalided home from Afghanistan and your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
“John! You are here, with me. Breathe with me. Inhale... Exhale… Nice and slow. Everything is OK. I’m here.”
“Oh, you again,” Lestrade fumed but it sounded good-natured. He handed one coffee to Molly, smiling at her.
“Your library card. You know, that thing people bring in the library if they want to borrow some books?” He sounded amused now.
We stop here for this installment of the DtS story. In the coming months: a casefic co-written with 7PercentSolution in which Roberto and Sherlock team up for a high-stakes art theft case, and it is, er, fraught. And not just for John.
. He could target John’s daughter. Even if he didn’t, he could target John, and Watson’s only got one parent as it is. Use your
It would be a pleasure to be ostentatiously indifferent to Sherlock’s shadow—for in terms of electric charisma, blazing energy, or magnetic sex appeal the Greek really couldn't compare.
I visualised his milky-white skin emerging from the silks and woolens he affected, and my welcoming smile grew strained; I saw from Valentina’s embarrassment that I had let the mask slip.
“The Mafia, wasn’t it? Would you like to do more of that kind of investigating?” He sounded honestly curious, not as though he were tiptoeing around the subject of Roberto.
A well-earned morning shower (pity there wasn’t room for two in Sherwill’s tiny tub). An equally well-earned breakfast, improvised in the now spottily-supplied kitchen. A fully mutual decision to go for a walk if only to make sure they got
My goal had been to collect data. I tried to look at the information I had gleaned (and the lack of information) as neutrally as possible. To avoid confirmation bias: I was vulnerable to that, since I desperately wanted for Sherlock not to have killed himself, for his death to have been stage-managed in some way.
In the cab on the way home he thought about the Italian policeman. The man had certainly been impressed. That wasn’t unusual; what was unusual was that he hadn’t been repellent. Superficially attractive, certainly, though that was irrelevant. But notably intelligent, discreet, and, well, promising.
I didn’t waste a second examining the body; Sherlock could scold me later. I just left the handgun, wiped carefully to remove any prints, and exited the way we’d both come in, from the back. Any minute now Mycroft and Sherlock and a few agents or some combination of these would be swarming in, and my presence there would be a complication for Mycroft.
,” he got me to at least give it a try. He would scale back casework for a time, taking on Rosie for the mornings she used to spend at daycare plus the afternoons I was operating; and I would take the rest of the shifts, as I mentally called them.
Roberto’s expression of relief was eloquent: so he’d actually doubted I would come. That was only fair; he didn’t know me well, after all. He couldn’t know that once I’ve announced a decision I follow through. It would be irrational to do otherwise. While I had some apprehension I had no misgivings, at least none sufficient to make me change my mind about Roberto and about Rome. I was going to spend the month, and perhaps more, trying to build a rapport with him, and that was that.
He’d said he liked dancing; I was an enthusiastic if low-frills dancer. So I looked through the CDs and cued up the song I’d sent him in London: Paolo Conte, “Via con me.” Seductive but ironic. I left a note for Sherlock to find when he came down later in the morning: “
He was lean and fit, long and rangy. Taller than me. His hair, like his beard, was dark brown and already greying, cut rather short—not cropped, like Lestrade, but elegantly and properly cut, enough to look artless without actually being so. It flattered his face, which was fine-featured and kindly in expression. His eyes were brown, his smile a slow curve.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
was too rational to pout about you spending a month having sex with a man seven inches taller than me, intelligent and handsome to boot. At least I’m too rational to expect you to apologise for it every day for all of February.”
That was unacceptable, so Sherlock reached out to touch John’s shoulder, cup his neck. “It’s just that I don’t want to hurry.”
She’d latched on to me immediately, despite my downcast air and the bitter remarks I made to all and sundry. On top of all that, she wasn’t a very practised or capable nurse. Was it my paranoia at work again? She was beginning to look very much like an agent in place. Not one of Mycroft’s people, but someone else, someone who might have had the same doubts I had about Sherlock's death.
“Okay, I can get that. I’m going to try for some words. I’m not good at this, so bear with me. I have never. In my life. Had more electrifying sex. Actually, it’s more than that. I’ve never had a more meaningful experience of any kind. It wasn’t just gratification, or satisfaction. It was as if I finally understood everything, was part of everything. There was no more you and me, there was no more me and the world, there was just—wholeness. I can’t express it and I don’t understand it, but even now I feel like everything is changed.”
“Especially with this.” Sherlock’s anxious expression eased into a fond one, and John swung his left knee to rest by Sherlock’s right, lowered himself carefully to just barely brush their bollocks together through their pants. A desperate gasp followed.
, I told you that the feather could've only come from one place!" Sherlock protested as soon as John let out the first snort. It was so annoying!
Sally Donovan raised her brows, "You mean the Freak? Don't even try to talk to him, your just wasting your precious time. I suggest you go back to where you came from."
John's face was burning up, he'd never felt more embarrassed in his life. All the spirits had already told their child to go to sleep and the teenager already left for school project, but it still meant John could be heard. From outside.
the first to regain consciousness, but it wasn't really his fault that he woke up finding himself swarmed in a mass of... heavy cotton fabric. Also noticeably naked. He tried his best to climb out of his imprisonment. Sherlock finally managed to stick his head out of the mess, and take a deep breath of air.
When John woke up lying down on his back, his whole body felt sore. He sucked in his breath and rolled over.
"Can I go in or not? I work with kids everyday. If these children contain valuable information, it's not my fault you're not getting it," he bit back bitterly making Donovan flinch and step aside.
John quickly spun around and exited the room, pulse ticking like a bomb. It really was not a good idea for Sherlock to find out who he is or was. He hurried past Donovan, rushed outside the house waiting for Sherlock to catch up.
"It's okay Mrs Hudson, don't cry," said John as he walked over to her, ignoring the protests of the intruders.
"Oh, murder." Murder was taken seriously in any meetings, some spirits could be witnesses but they can't tell anybody.
"No that was Harry," a kid glared at the older, blue eyes shining. There were three toddlers huddled near the corner of the room, far away from any furniture in the room. John noticed two other spirits were attending to their own children.
"Disappeared? Like gone, poof, magic?" John's eyes widened and he swallowed hard, "How- then what did you mean by 'human subject'?"
"John! Now you answer your phone, we're having a meeting. I know you just transferred, so why didn't you pick up?"
Wait, human? Where did that human go, the one who looked like him; it shouldn't be hard to find the guy who punched him in the face and John certainly wasn't the 'human subject'.
John woke up to the rumbling sound of unwelcomed footsteps below the flat and Mrs Hudson's protests.
he scares half of the living daylight out of people. That's just the way he smiles, he can't change it. John tried his best to glare at Sherlock, only to be rewarded with a wider grin.
Hi, 'tis me. I completely screwed up the settings of this fic, and have avoided it ever since. Please feel free to read and comment as I try to re-adjust to writing again!
"Sherlock, how much did this cost?" John lifted the trinket into the air, admiring how easily the light caught onto the gems.
"You have absolutely NO RIGHT to hold me here!" someone shouted, then the door swung open rather hard nearly bursting John's eardrums.
This must be a joke; no one can possibly disappear into thin air. Especially in an explosion (which is usually more gruesome). Well, even being vaporized shouldn't mean your clothes were left behind.
Danger was coursing through John's mind. He had to get his kid to safety. Where was he, where was Sherlock? He panicked as the echoes of footsteps grew louder. John scrambled out of the bed and was about to teleport before Sherlock's door was thrown wide open.
John looked up to see Mycroft standing at the entrance of the door. How can the British Government act so differently after kidnapping him from the middle of the night and forcing him to come here, now Mycroft was smiling an exasperated face full of pity at him.
to murder. You daft idiot," John scowled. Of course. There is no reason for John to feel like murdering someone, let alone want to murder. He's a doctor.
Lil Sherlock's light grey eyes slowly trailed up to his best friend's shoes, jeans, jumper, and finally up to his friend's eyes.
Sherlock felt a sudden pang of sentiment, no, shame; ashamed of startling the solider who sat in front of him.
Sherlock couldn't control himself, John looking like a murderer? Definitely something that he can't imagine, an army doctor who wears fluffy jumpers running around looking like he just killed someone.
"What for?" John inquired as Sherlock picked up his phone. He finished texting his message and looked down at John.
"I think you're asking the wrong questions." The voice paused. "Why do you care for Holmes so much?"
Sherlock promptly lifted the corners of John's lips; it looked ridiculous. It wasn't a real smile at all, and that made it worse. Sherlock sucked in air to keep from laughing.
"Lestrade, the paper. There's something behind it," Sherlock gripped the DI's shoulder in pain. Lestrade glanced down at the pitiful sight in disdain, but seeing Sherlock's desperate look he reached down to grab the fallen article.
did John know of that? As if the blond was caught in headlights, he quickly blurted out, "I mean... it
Sherlock raised his brows, "Enough to make them fall asleep for a while. Don't lie to me John, they have obviously slept for over ten minutes straight with you yelling in thin air." John noticed Harry crossing her arms in the corner of his eye.
Interesting. Something new, oh this could be very interesting. Sherlock bored his eyes into John's head, eager to start his new experiment.
"Sure go ahead, I'm sure they won't utter a single word in our direction. Let alone to a 'friend' of Sherlock Holmes. They don't even act like normal kids. Hiding around the corners, if you ask me I think they need a mental hospital."
"Problem?" Anthena stared at John, "Oh, I keep forgetting, you're new in this section; anyway, the affluent spirits all tell their children ahead of time. Supposed to make them more independent."
"Hurry John!" Sherlock pulled John out of the many (unnecessary) layers of clothes, "Lestrade's coming, no time to explain."
"Perhaps, a cabbie is a liable suspect. Easy to blend with the crowd and most people put full trust in these strangers for their safety. You can find them anywhere, everywhere," Sherlock replied disinterested.
Even more disturbing was that there was no spirit nearby, but there definitely was a spiritual barrier around the living room before he stepped into it.
"I'm getting there if you let me talk. As you know I have eyes all around London. Finding Doctor John Watson was not hard."
"It's okay Ms Hudson, you just scared me that's all," Lestrade slowly sat up and dusted his trousers. In reality his bum was feeling rather injured, the Detective Inspector grimaced as he stood up. Mycroft turned to the small lady and asked if she had seen or heard any strange noises not long after the explosion.
"Of course I do! It's just-when I smile," John bit his lip, "I tend to scare people away. A lot." Sherlock raised both eyebrows, John warily gave in, "I look like I want to murder somebody, when I smile."
, wants to meet the Freak," Sally gestured violently at John like he was an imminent threat. Lestrade ran his hands over own face like it was the only thing left to smother his frustration.
"John," Mycroft said, holding Sherlock in his arms, "I wish to speak with you alone. Anthena, please.”
John felt anger boiling within him, the energy was trying to escape. No one should judge a book by it's cover, first Sherlock and now small kids? Donovan had some guts to say such cruel things about people.
Already John felt uneasy as he entered the car, when he asked the driver where they were going the only response he received was silence. By flat, did that lady mean Sherlock's because it was really the only home he could think of other than the house where Harry was residing.
The inanimate scrawny baby-like object, he guessed, was himself and that the other boy was Mycroft. The two other children however were a blonde boy and a dark-haired girl.
He tried to look around, but panicked slightly when he couldn't move his body. His arms and legs were apparently strapped onto a stereotypical dentist-like chair. Oh great, and his fingers weren't responding either. John internally groaned.
The detective grinned manically and took the camera from Lestrade, crushing it. Now that Mycroft's only digital spy was out of the way, Sherlock could finally ask Lestrade some questions.
"Of course no-," Sherlock froze, realizing the same fact. How had this simple observation slipped from his mind?
For a second Sherlock wished he had brought a companion other than Lestrade. He quickly shook the thought out of his head and nodded to the police detective. They were ready.
John turned around just in time to catch a glance of a few locks of dark brown hair before it disappeared from his sight. A feeling of déjà vu crawled up his back.
"Sir, we can't comprehend what exactly you are trying to say. Certainly you fall under the human category, what else could you be? The unknown entity disappeared once
"I'll-I'll explain later. Look Sherlock, I'll see you tomorrow right? I'll just leave now." John muttered softly. Sherlock stood and walked across the room, half expecting the blond to leave too. John just stared after him.
"Shoot!" Lestrade ran back out to look for said stranger. Sherlock hummed as he closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, waiting for Lestrade to come back with his person. Honestly, coming out once in a while was not bad.
"Please tell me this isn't another one of your spider on a tree tricks," Anderson grumbled as Sherlock shoved the lot down the stairs.
The consulting detective reached for his pocket lens to further inspect the names of the boy and girl's on the pastel artwork; John and Anthea. Suddenly, Sherlock's legs gave out from underneath him as a new wave of pain crashed onto his body.
John just sat there staring at his food as if he didn't know what to do with it. Sherlock eventually asked for the cold case and the DI reluctantly gave him the file.
"And you invaded Afghanistan," Sherlock hears John giggle and after a moment the consulting detective also begins to laugh.
Going to the antique store to buy something wasn't hard if you were Sherlock and six. Even the most expensive things came easily to the little mastermind.
Sorry for not updating, unfortunately I reread this fic and I killed myself with anticipation. I mean,
"So you're the guy who punched me in the face earlier?" John asked as he tiptoed to reach behind the lamp.
John tried to stand again, successful, and slightly woozy. The blond ended up tumbling out of the alleyway and onto a busy pavement, where he raised a hand to block the sunlight from his eyes. He blinked as he looked around, feeling a bit taller than usual. It had to be from the sudden change of perspective.
"You can take them off now, kiddo," John hoped that his belief was right, he waited as the boy uncovered his face.
John's ears were ringing as he ran off hearing a series of similar offensive phrases and honking string behind him.
DI Lestrade had just barged into an empty flat with scorch marks all over the walls and shattered glass everywhere. An obvious sign that an experiment had gone wrong.
Lestrade talked to John the rest of dinner, whilst Sherlock was still shovelling food in his mouth. He truly wanted to heave, somehow his brain decided not to listen but keep on eating. Sherlock was truly annoyed by whatever was causing him to continue to devour like this.
"Shwrwok, yucnletgnew." Sherlock snapped his head up to see a slightly red John, whose eyes flashed with annoyance. He reluctantly let go of John's head, watching him rub his jaw, waiting for the right moment to speak.
Sherlock knew where to go, back to Baker Street. The consulting detective had to get out of Mycroft's insufferable office, but how. A couple of possible ways popped into his head but most of them included crossing paths with Mycroft's face, Sherlock scowled at the ideas.
His flatmate rolled his eyes and dropped his hand, but continued to hurry John. The ride back to Baker Street was very uncomfortable. John felt Sherlock's intense gaze on his neck the entire ride. He shifted further away from Sherlock as much as possible, almost absolutely sure that Sherlock was staring either from lust or murder. Probably murder. Oh God, what did he do to make Sherlock act this way?
Anthena walked into the room seconds after Mycroft set his bags, John grinned broadly and waved to her.
John Watson found himself standing right in front of a door of a building surrounded by police cars.
Sherlock chuckles and pauses when he heard Mrs Hudson's footsteps. He smiles at John when Mrs Hudson opens the door, her arms open wide.
"Thank you," John barged into the house letting his instincts pick up the surroundings and which room was which.
If it wasn't for the unexpected guest, he probably would've left the minute he saw the file about a man who drowned in his vehicle in the bathroom. It was the frog, of course.
, lovely really, having to run and drag an army doctor a whole two meters across the room. Large scaled, not miniature. Sherlock managed to reach their destination in record time; perhaps he should join the Olympics because he just ran what felt like 200 meters within 20 seconds flat
This would be the second child who had seen him as a human and what was worse is that this one works for the government. John wanted to disappear. Murray was definitely going to do more than just snicker at his horrible misfortune.
John swallowed loudly, of course he'd forget that he could still use his powers even if he wasn't really considered an imaginary spirit any more. Adjusting his eyes back to normal vision was easy, but that was what scared him. With "normal human" vision he couldn't see anything, just darkness, but how did the kid know he was there.
After Harry hanged up, John let out his breathe he didn't notice he was holding in. He stared at his phone, wondering
John froze under the point-blank range of the first assailant's Sig Sauer P226R and reluctantly put both of his hands behind his head. He yelped when another guy forcefully held both his wrists together and shoved him out the door.
The cost was ridiculous. £381.52. But it was worth it because John was worth it, Sherlock decided. And Sherlock needed him.
John felt heart stop momentarily and opened his mouth to protest, but paused when he noticed that the woman in front of him and visibly relaxed when a middle-aged man passed by. John could only assume he was some sort of detective at the moment.
"He knows what will happen, I've already told him. Besides, he’s capable of taking care of himself in the future."
Interesting there were no signs of a child at the crime scene, so it was impossible that a kid was there.
Both opened slammed open the door to a long hallway. Halfway down the hollow interior, the lights flickered out.
"Wha-" John blinked away the tears collecting in his eyes. The voice seemed to groan loudly before becoming silent again, but where was it coming from? None of the other people spoke after the last one asked how was he, so who?
"No I'm sorry for getting you into this mess in the first place," John felt himself calm down as he sympathised with his counterpart.
"Lestrade, you took lots longer to come out than usual since your time was nine minutes... bit over average if I'd say," Sherlock muttered loud enough for Lestrade to hear, while grabbing John's wrist.
funny!" John flushed at his imaginary partner, "I'm not sure why I'm like this anyway, it's not my fault!"
When his phone rung for the fifth time Sherlock nearly chucked the item out the window. Fuck Mycroft and his pompous arse, his brother was probably spying on him right now at the very moment.
Sherlock lifted a brow at Sally's remark, letting his head drift to John. John was standing by the corner of the room, completely unfazed by the Yard's recent joke. His expression was so flat, so serious, Sherlock had to try not chuckle at John's mortifying neutral expression.
Sherlock ran up to the next glass display and stared at the encapsulated complex puzzle, fascinated by its art. He had been running around with John all day, so the fatigue had finally caught up a few minutes later as he stood up slowly. Sherlock paused midway when he noticed John's fidgeting in the glass reflection.
The eyeball game went on for half a minute, until a breathless Lestrade ruined it by opening the door on the blond. The wooden door to the private room hit the small man directly between the occipital and parietal region of the head. Sherlock snapped back into reality from his momentary trance.
He cautiously avoided the jarred pieces of glass as he tried to reach the upturned kitchen; only to find the detective's and doctor's clothes lying on the ground. As if their very owners had perished into thin air, leaving only their clothes behind.
The cab stopped. As John reached out to pay, Sherlock dragged him out before he could even utter 'thank you' to the cabbie. John was guided upstairs and shoved harshly into his chair.
"Oi, freak," Sally probed, "What did you do to him? Is your 'sociopathy' becoming contagious? Although, come to think of it, we've all never seen John smile before."
Within seconds Sherlock was inside the living room, Lestrade grudgingly tailed the detective upstairs and waited patiently for the genius to say something as he looked through a microscope.
"Shut up, look what happened," Lestrade pointed at the two halves which now had a grey hue on it. Sherlock lifted them and realised there were now words on the back, he stared at Lestrade in disbelief who shrugged obliviously.
But there was one thing that puzzled Young Sherlock Holmes: John didn't age. From his very first memory, John had always looked like an eight-year-old boy. Sherlock wasn't bothered by that fact, but he was bothered by how often John dodged the question about his age. The brunet hardly doubted that his best friend was an adult in disguise, he was too short to be one.
“I can’t tell you how excited the Editorial Board is about publishing this work, Mr Holmes.” He did indeed look eager.
He’s saying too much, he knows it, and Sherlock might not understand but he has to, he has to see why John had snapped—
Patrick took the microphone for a dreary song to which John resolutely paid no attention, only clapping listlessly when it ended.
, an exquisite and complex fish dish with local greens and a fennel sauce, Elena seems to want to start over. She smiles warmly and says, “
“You’ve never been anything but dismissive of my study of tobacco-ash. I thought I’d spare myself the derision.” Anyone else would’ve sounded waspish; Sherlock managed to sound coolly indifferent.
He’d been on John’s mind, almost constantly. Had been sought, actively and doggedly. Remembered with more than just contrition or nostalgia. “I found him in places he’d been in, and places he hadn’t; and I found him in my own mind and memory.”
We had patterns, of course we did; I wouldn’t call them habits, because somehow there was always something of the unexpected in our lovemaking, we could always surprise each other. As soon as I said
“I would. I do. I knew as soon as I met her. She’s reliable, like Molly but without the self-doubt. Low-drama like Lestrade, tender like Mrs Hudson. And immediately loyal.” He smiled, and it was as though he’d said “like you.”
Dreams awaken him. All of him. Usually he can suppress the urges. Sometimes—not. Then he takes himself in hand with short, sharp tugs, for relief more than pleasure. To evict. To exorcise.
Now apparently the band was coming to London for a mysteriously important gig, and Triona had to pull out for the excellent reason that her third baby had decided to turn up a month early.
I was a little surprised that Donovan was in charge; more surprised that the text exchange was reasonably affable; and gobsmacked that Sherlock had stooped to repeating himself to confirm our presence in the morning.
John didn’t react at first and let the words sink in but he couldn’t quite believe his own ears, “I’m sorry, what?”
John sighed heavily and shook his head to clear his mind from such dirty thoughts. He took a deep breath and slowly release it. He straightened his composure, cleared his throat and started walking down the hall where he could possibly--and hopefully--see Sherlock.
I finally found the dress, and had it tailored just a bit for flexibility (and for modesty—that lift!). The bodice was ivory velvet, the skirt ivory damask with tiny gold stars hand-embroidered down one side and along the hem, like a playful galaxy. The shoulder straps were metallic gold, so I had fine gold cord twisted through my hair, and if I say so myself I came up with a stunning gold-and-ivory design for my eye makeup.
“You wanted to delete me.” Not a question. A statement. I stroked his long calf with my foot, trying to make a joke of this painful thought, trying to make this whole hideous moment pass.
Before I at least was ready, the outside world was calling to threaten us with a post-interview debriefing. Morstan had, apparently, disclosed quite a few features of interest.
That only works when you still have options, of course. There’s nothing fun at all about the reality of being penniless. But a few weeks of short rations were doable, to get the overdraft a bit closer to manageable.
He jammed his feet back into his boots and went out to look. Stopped by the Blind Piper, where the band would be playing the following night. Nothing.
Not two weeks after he’d walked back into 221 B he'd walked out again, carrying only one thing. That’s what people do when they start a new life, isn’t it? Leave everything behind and become somebody else? He’d considered leaving the violin, but decided instead to take it under his arm and travel until he reached a place where people would call it a fiddle.
From the first night it’d been my job to protect him. From bad men like Jefferson Hope. From people who mocked him, out of contempt or out of insecurity. From his own worst impulses. From starving himself. From using, from smoking, from living in a germ lab. From Mycroft’s suffocating “worry.” From
And a damned good thing it turned out to be that he was working again, because barely two weeks after the Kensington case closed, we got a copycat. Like the MP, this victim had been strung up from a metal hook; unlike the MP, it had happened after death. Like the MP, this victim had no immediately visible cause of death; unlike the MP, this victim was stark naked. Obviously he was lacking any form of documentary I.D., but in five minutes flat Sherlock whipped up a profile on him that was so detailed I forgot my resolution not to let him show off, and asked him how he knew all that. By the time he got to “surely you noticed his residual tan is stronger on the right arm than the left,” it was all sounding embarrassingly obvious and he was practically radiating self-satisfaction.
Sherlock snorted. “In that case, I take everything I just said back and I will say it tomorrow anew because this is a terrible cliché.”
“Are you alr- Jesus, Sherlock! What are you doing here?” John knelt by the other man. “You are soaked! You’ll catch your death!”
Sherlock hailed them a cab as soon as they stepped out, gesturing to John to get in. He rattled facts about his cold cases with a complete disregard for oxygen and John interspersed it with awed interjections. He had already realized that praise was what made Sherlock tick and he wanted to milk the opportunity and get to know more about the extraordinary man.
John had already noticed that Sherlock never ate or drink anything in the library. Of course, it was forbidden to snack over the books but the library had a nice corner where you could eat your sandwich without the necessity to leave the premises. And you could have a drink at your desk if it was secured against spilling. Sherlock didn’t drink even if he was sitting in the library all day. John marked it off as another one from the lanky genius’s eccentricities, of which he had more than enough.
“In this case, yes. Or some stuff from the pharmacy in exchange for paperwork. Or cash, like when I returned a stray dog to its owner because I know every homeless person in the area and they spotted it hiding. Free pizza when I got the delivery guy out of trouble with authorities.”
“Believe me, I’m not doing it for my pleasure,” the librarian said dryly and gestured to the small queue that formed behind Sherlock.
He checked the Petri dishes on the table and, satisfied with their development, left the flat. He froze mid-step in the doorway. There was a perfectly innocently looking envelope lying on the threshold right in front of him. Sherlock knew exactly what was inside, he would recognize the envelope paper everywhere. Well, that was fast. He picked it up and tore it up to tiny pieces. The phone in his pocket started to ring. Sherlock huffed.
John had only one duvet but luckily it was quite large, so they both managed to fit under it after some shuffling. Sherlock was lying on his back, looking at the ceiling. John lay down on his side and observed the man. His eyes were wide open and shadows accentuated his cheekbones. It was a sight for sore eyes, John would just prefer to have him here under completely different circumstances.
“Then this hero wants one more bottle of that yummy wine we had for Halloween and some nice chocolate. For starters.”
“I could get fired for this,” he muttered as he moved the stacks of papers and binders from the small desk. “Here, would it be to Your Highness’s liking?”
“Molly!” John hissed but had to smile. “I just want to thank him for something he did for me. Nothing more!”
Sherlock inched closer and put his arms around John. At first, it was a bit awkward but then John decided that as a comforted party he could do what he had wanted to do for a long time and buried his nose in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. It felt every bit as good as he had imagined.
Time to think. He could make money and buy the books he needed but that would take at least some time and effort and he couldn’t spare either. Or, if he couldn’t get his own books, he could use the library. He remembered that one of the hospitals should have a nice, science specialized library.
And yet, it seemed that Sherlock liked to spend time with John. They chatted about random things, Sherlock sometimes even helped John with shelving when he needed to stretch his legs, as he put it. And was that John’s imagination or was Sherlock standing closer on these occasions than was strictly necessary? So close that John could smell his soap and something so distinctly
John didn’t think once about the madman during the day, he simply didn’t have time. Sherlock wasn’t the only one who found the exam period taxing. Only when the door closed after the last student, he remembered he hadn’t noticed Sherlock leaving. He locked the entrance and went to the back office. He found him there, just not as he imagined.
