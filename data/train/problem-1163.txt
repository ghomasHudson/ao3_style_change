“What planet is this one from? And do we need to keep it away from you until you're older?” John asked suspiciously, looking over at his daughter.
“So what are the plans for today then?” Harriet asked, looking over at her dad knowing that Sherlock would have no idea of any plans.
He makes it back to Baker Street in five minutes, running up the steps to 221 and hammering on the door.
Oh and for those of you who are Marvel fans, you'll recognise the code name for John which is Mockingbird. Its a reference to the character Barbara Morse from the Marvel universe who has a Ph-D (a form of doctorate) and is code named Mockingbird. Kind of my sly way of crossing fandoms. Wren is also a reference to Eurasian Wren which is the national bird of England and the smallest of the bird species, a slight nod to Mycroft's minor position in the British Government ;) xxxx
“Well it was to everyone else. Even John knew that. And that was over eight years ago when he realised it.” Mycroft remarks with disdain, wondering how long he's been wearing his heart on his sleeve when it comes to his partner.
“What do you mean 'alive'? Are you sure, Anthea?” Mycroft asks desperately, fearing for his brother's already fragile state.
“Don't frown, you'll get wrinkles.” John's grin drops to a playful smirk as he continues to line his eyes with the black pencil.
Thankfully, John and Lestrade come running into the alleyway as I struggle to fight unconsciousness. Lestrade cuffs him as John hauls me to my feet and insists that he's taking me back to Baker Street because he 'won't hear the end of it if he sends me to hospital'.
I was going to call this My First Blow Job but after the re-naming of the first chapter, I thought I'd try a classier approach. That and the fact that the boys spend more time talking about how they should progress than spending the morning giving each other blow jobs ;)
But that didn't matter now because I always knew Sherlock would tell me in his own time, I just hoped it wouldn't be something he told me on my death bed.
Without a second thought, Maggie runs for her life and doesn't look back, too afraid that the vampire will make good on his word.
“Yes! I did. I really liked it, John. I've wanted to kiss you for so long now. Um, I've … had a crush on you for a few years now.” Sherlock replies, whispering the last part.
John smiled in appreciation and continued to work on Sherlock until he panted out, "John ... I ... can't hold back ... for any longer."
.” Greg growls, completely ignoring the man's remark and focusing on how tight a hold Davies has on the younger man.
John suggests tea at our favourite take away and I have to agree that I'm a little hungry myself, and honestly, I feel like a walk now.
“Living together in a flat in London, of course. I'll be doing my consulting work, which you will help me do and then you'll still be complaining about all the experiments I do.” Sherlock says matter-of-factly.
John moans again, closing his eyes to stop himself from physically holding his best friend down and having his wicked way with him.
“Yes, well, there's nothing wrong with looking presentable.” Sherlock snaps, bringing his hands to his hips.
“Oh, okay." Maggie replies unsurely, wondering why the hell she even came up with this lame story. “So, just out of curiosity, how old are you. I'd say thirty but I'm guessing I'd be wrong.”
Sherlock just smirks in response, hooking his finger into his boyfriend's belt hoop and pulling him forward for a kiss.
Sherlock carefully places John down on the sofa as the ex-army doctor drifts in and out of consciousness.
“Our own? They're just pawns to you. Pawns to fight in a war that isn't of our concern.” Sherlock sneers, turning to look out of the window.
John blushed and tried to hide behind his newspaper while Sherlock shamelessly grinned at Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock smiles back and then slowly crawls out of bed, stretching his long limbs while John watches his boyfriend's movements with a lazy smile.
“I was hungry. But I found a lovely little snack on my way home.” The vampire smiles, clearly remembering the poor sod he killed last night.
John slides off the bed as the pair get undressed slowly and in silence, both more than a little nervous about their first time together.
“No really, I am. Come with me and I’ll show you.” The Doctor replied, pointing in the direction of his time machine.
When did I last feed? I'm sure it was only yesterday but then again, this case has been going on for days so it could be longer.
“Well, maybe it's time to open your presents now, Harry.” Sherlock smiled awkwardly, sitting down across from his partner.
"You didn't take a lot of convincing." John winked, before heading to the bathroom. "I'm going for a shower. Be good, Princess and goodbye, my love." John added, kissing them both as he passed.
I worked it out a few days after moving in with him, it was obvious really; especially when I tried to check on a stab wound that was already healing, Sherlock was practically unconscious by then so I just left him to sleep it off.
“Is this supposed to happen just from a kiss?” Sherlock whispers softly, a blush creeping up his cheeks.
“Good morning, Maggie. Sorry, I was thirsty. And well, it was easy to work out where you lived. After all, I am a vampire, I can smell you.”
Immediately, Greg lowers his hand and realises his fatal mistake; he raised a hand to a man who's been to hell and back, probably had a hand and fist raised to him more times than he can count, and suddenly, Greg drops to his knees and pulls the frightened young man into his arms.
“I don't need to hurt him, Gregory. I already know what I need to.” Mycroft replies calmly, letting go of Sherlock. “Why must it always be drugs, dear brother? Can't you get yourself a
So? I know, very long chapter but I got confident with sexual stuff so ;) does anybody not  like it? xxxx
John moans in response and pulls out, slamming back into Sherlock before leaning in and kissing the younger teen slowly.
“In a minute, let me finish.” John scolds, as he adds some mascara to his fine lashes. “Right, get here then.”
“You should think about it, though, university, I mean. It's the best time, isn't it? Do everything while you're still young because when you get older it will be a whole lot messier.” Greg replies, stopping at the halls of the university to spark up a cigarette.
As Sherlock's curiosity is peaked by the mysterious young girl, the Doctor turns dark and refuses to tell Sherlock anything.
“Sherl, let's just get it over with. You know he'll just be a dick about it all night.” John sighs, dragging himself up off the couch.
“You had just been promoted, I didn't want to jeopardise that, Gregory.” Mycroft says softly, turning to look at his partner.
“It doesn't have to be a snog or anything. Just longer than twenty seconds.” Greg replies, unsuccessfully trying to suppress his amused smirk.
After ten minutes in the house, Sherlock asks to step outside and get some fresh air while John continues searching.
John rests his hands on his boyfriend's slim hips and kisses him back, tangling their legs together. He pulls away slightly and looks up at Sherlock.
Obviously, I stayed awake all night wondering if I'd lost my mind and if it wasn't for the blood on Sherlock's shirt, I could have convinced myself that it hadn't happened.
“Who? Not Molly is it? I mean, she's cute an' everything but I don't feel that way.” John replies sheepishly, looking over at the young girl.
“I’m the Doctor. And I’m a traveller, I was looking for a companion and I thought who better than the great Sherlock Holmes. I mean, you’ll be able to understand all my technical language better than anyone.”
Sorry, it’s not as long as my others or maybe you’re glad it’s not ;) and sorry about the abrupt ending but it was just a little morning sex and embarrassing poor Mrs Hudson ;) xxxxxx
a body, Mycroft! Just confirm it already so we can put this to bed!” Sherlock yells, jumping up from his chair and swaying.
Just ahead of her she sees a man sprint past the next street at quite a speed and wonders what on Earth's got him running so fast.
"John!" This time Sherlock shouted, the tone reverberating around the room. "You know how bad I am with my emotions!"
“Victor? Victor's straight, Matt asked Victor for a shag last year and nearly got a broken nose for it. He's with Molly, dickhead.” John laughs, shaking his head at his friend.
The younger man glared at his partner; who quirked an eyebrow in response, daring the younger man to challenge him.
“It's six thirty in the morning, what the hell are you doing in my house? In fact, how the hell do you know where I live?”
Of course, their story is much longer than this but unfortunately I'm relying on the Doctor to bring me news of the Holmes-Watson family now.
The next night John and Sherlock are working a case; nothing too complicated really, just a husband who's wife had an 'accident' conveniently
“Thank Christ. We've been looking for you bloody everywhere, man.” The voice laughs in relief, shouting orders to his squad to get the others out too.
Sherlock grabs the mobile and relays the address, telling Greg that John is hurt and he is taking him home.
She grabs his arm and pulls him in the direction of the back garden, opening the patio doors and pulling him into the cold night air.
Yes, maybe Sherlock should have called an ambulance but he knows that by the time they get John prepared for surgery, he could be taking his last breath.
“Um, these, do you think they'll be okay?” Sherlock asks softly, mentally shaking himself as he blushes.
“I know, love. I am trying to. I've got to go. I'll ring you when I've checked the next one.” Greg sighs, rubbing a hand through his silver hair.
“Holy fuck, you are exquisite, Sher. A bloody masterpiece, right here.” John moans softly, starting to move in and out of Sherlock.
Mycroft walks over to his brother and holds his arms out, the younger Holmes practically falling into the welcome embrace.
I agree and sit down at the kitchen table. I wait for him to mention about the events of last night but he doesn't.
John hummed in agreement and the vibrations shot through Sherlock, this time he didn't have time to suppress the loud moan that escaped.
two years ago.” Sherlock replies cruelly, but there's no mistaking the hitch in his voice at the word 'death'.
Obviously it's pointless, I'm much stronger than any human; especially this four foot two inches bag of bones.
But just as he starts to think this is the end, he hears the most terrifying noise; a dangerous growl that echoes in the silence of the house and suddenly the source of the noise leaps into action.
Sherlock gently nips John's neck but as the older vampire finds his prostate, Sherlock's teeth sink deep into John's neck.
I go and call for a cab, I already know he's going to follow so why should I waste time waiting for him?
Greg smiles warmly before grabbing John in a bear hug, “You given me some grey hairs, you have, mate. Have you seen this?”
“Well, try and get some rest. It's a long journey. That goes for the rest of you too.” The operative replies, nodding to the rest of John's troop. “And we'll need that shoulder checked out too.”
The Doctor pulls a face and I just chuckle. It's nice when Father shows affection. I guess Dad has had some effect on him.
Greg and John simultaneously turn at the sound of Mycroft's voice, John giggling away to himself at the slight blush on the older teen's cheeks.
Thankfully it's quiet because it's late Thursday night and everyone is probably home by now. There are a few drunks but they won't even bother to do anything, never mind testify if they see what
John pushed Sherlock back into the counter as his hands roamed over the detective's chest. As he did, Sherlock's hands moved to untuck John's shirt and scratch down his back, causing the ex-army doctor to moan again.
“Just relax, baby. Let it happen. I got you.” John replies softly, resting his hands on Sherlock's hips.
“Of course I want this.” John says softly, crawling off the bed and sitting next to Sherlock. “But with every relationship there are pros and cons. You just have to hope there are more good things than bad. And with you, there are. You already know my habits, my daft little quirks, what annoys me and what makes me happy. You know all of it, Sherl. That's why I've been wanting to ask you out for a while but knowing,
“You … You look good, John.” Sherlock replies unsurely, looking down at the floor and blushing again.
“Lestrade, this is the man you're looking for. You should find the murder weapon at his home and the stolen artefacts at a storage longer at this address. Oh, and you'll find a substantially large amount in his bank account since before the murders started.”
The younger teen rests his hand on John's chest, feeling the rise and fall of his breathing. He runs a finger down his breast bone, stopping at John's belly-button before looking back at John for permission. John nods and smiles softly, folding his arms behind his head as Sherlock's finger goes further down, running a delicate line down the older teen's cock; causing him to moan loudly and buck his hips slightly.
“Oh. I should have told you before then. Potential flatmates should know everything about each other, after all.” He grins at me, his fangs catching the light of fire.
"I know it's impossible, considering it was my genetic material, but she's starting to look like you too, John."
Maggie finishes work after another impromptu late shift at the bar. She's tired and just wants to go and meet her friends, Amy and Tisha for their movie night.
“What did the Doctor get you this time, Harriet?” Sherlock asked with a curious look at his daughter.
“Heartbreak is an awful motivator, Gregory. Remember that.” Mycroft replies carefully, the past two years clearly having had an effect on the older Holmes too.
“For the love of God, Sherlock. Do you have to do that, it's our daughter's birthday.” John half-moaned, watching as his partner continued to seduce him.
The Doctor quickly started pressing buttons and turning the dial; he knew it had been a bad idea to bring Sherlock to his own future.
John is busy searching through the wife's dresser when he feels the impact of wood hitting bone; his head spinning and vision blurring as he turns to face his attacker.
Suddenly, he's hauling me out of the cab and dragging me up the stairs to 221; he struggles to open the door and I want to help but I have no strength to lift my arms.
“I know, Gregory. I truly only wanted you not to worry. And I had it in hand.” Mycroft replies, resting his hands on top of Greg's.
“Aww, mate, it's only a nickname. Ya know I mean nothing by it.” Greg grins, collapsing down onto the couch.
John grins and continues to lazily lick his boyfriend's cock, slowly and teasingly. Sherlock moans loudly, his body lifting off the bed and driving his cock deeper into John's mouth.
When they pull up into the driveway, Sherlock point blank refuses to get out of the car, instead decides to sulk until Greg has no choice but to drag him out and wrestle him into Mycroft's house.
“Now, if you don't mind. My food got away and I'm still hungry. Go home. Unless you want to be on the menu.” The vampire growls, stalking closer to Maggie.
“Ah, so you boys are finally awake now. I’ll make some tea and get some biscuits.” Mrs Hudson smiled as she entered the flat.
Sherlock closes his eyes and involuntarily moans, his hands wrapping round John as the ex-army doctor continues to drink from him.
But now I'm fifteen and the Doctor is here, at our flat, talking to Father about science. I'm sat on the couch with Dad, keeping him company and watching some daft tv show. He keeps laughing and it makes his eyes sparkle, it's a lovely sight, really.
Sherlock pulled away to grab the lube and a condom from the bedside cabinet as John smiled in anticipation.
"Oh this man isn't a blogger. What is a blogger anyway, is that internet writing? Never mind. He's wanted to be a writer since he was a child and after meeting you and John, he was inspired."
“No, I’ve only just met him. I mean he’s a guy from work, we just started chatting one day. You know how it is.”
She'd noticed that ever since Sherlock had returned all those years ago, that the boys had been going at it like rabbits.
“I'm sorry. For turning you. But I couldn't lose you, John. I know we haven't been together long but I had no choice.” Sherlock sighs sadly, tears appearing in his eyes.
John wraps his arms around his mate tightly and drifts off into a peaceful sleep; his hunger for both Sherlock and blood sated for now.
Sherlock shudders with want and dashes down the stairs into Mrs Hudson flat. He quickly heads to the kitchen and grabs the bags of blood from the fridge, putting them into a bag so he doesn't have to make multiple trips.
“Your dad is in the kitchen and your presents are next to the couch.” Sherlock grinned, causing his daughter to blush at her actions.
“I kinda told Amy that you work with me, I mean what was a suppose to say, ‘hey Amy, this is Sherlock, he’s a vampire that I met one night after work.’ She’ll think you’re from some sort of cult.”
“Lookin' good, mate. Luv the eye-liner, really brings out your eyes.” Greg smiles, cocking his head to the side as he admires the younger teen.
“You really fucked up there, Sherlock. But you're not a bad guy, no matter what anyone says. Granted, you're still a dick.” I chuckle, smiling at him.
Harriet smiled and hugged him in return; her stomach rumbling as the smell of breakfast reached her nose.
“Oh, well. I’ll just get some tea and biscuits.” The landlady gushed, blushing as she realised what Sherlock had been insinuating in the look.
“Doesn’t stop you coming back for more though, does it?” John called from the bathroom with a wicked smile.
“Oh, I didn't. Kate told me that it was lunch time before she saw my experiment and started screaming.” Sherlock grins, a shimmer of glee in his eyes.
"Hey Amy, sorry but I won't be able to meet you and Tisha tonight. Only just finish and I'm totally beat. Maybe we can meet tomorrow, it is my day off after all."
“Mr Holmes sent us. Unofficially of course, so try to keep that bit to yourself, alright.” The man replies, a hint of a smile on his face.
“Greg! How much have you had to drink, mate?” John grins, catching his friend as he trips and stumbles into John, nearly spilling his beer all over the other teen.
“I’m sure Mrs Hudson wouldn’t mind taking Harry to school early. She can finally go to that breakfast club.” John smiled suggestively.
John sighed but smiled at his daughter; at least Sherlock was actually taking notice of his daughter, even if it was to teach her some Not Good things.
“I'm sorry, Sher. I really am. I'm so, so sorry.” Greg soothes softly, as Sherlock's broken sobs reverberate through his own chest.
With any luck, my secret is safe for now and John believes that the stab wound wasn't as bad as he first thought.
Sherlock leans in to kiss me one last time before moving back to his violin and starting to play a slow melody.
But for some reason, I still decided to meet up with him the next day to look at a flat and move in that same day.
The second time Harriet met the Doctor. Unfortunately, John doesn't take this encounter too well, unlike Sherlock.
“What's he talking about, dear?” Mrs Hudson asked, walking into the room with another present for Harriet.
Mycroft speeds up his pace and heads downstairs to Mrs Hudson's flat; turning the television up to full volume as he enters.
"But they're just fiction, like characters in a book." She sounds scared, balling her hands into fists to hide her shaking.
“Slow down, baby. You haven't eaten all day. I don't want you passing out on me.” John breathes, trying not to moan as Sherlock nibbles his neck.
exist. We're like ghosts. And yeah we do. Obviously Mr Holmes thought you were important enough to commit numerous acts of treason to rescue.” The operative replies wryly with a smile.
“With you two around? No way. I don't wanna know what either of you are thinking.” I reply, watching as Dad blushes and Father smirks.
"Damn it!" John exclaimed, throwing his favourite mug across the room and watching it smash into pieces.
"Well, I never believed it until now. John takes everything I throw at him and has always stood by me."
John chuckles before replying, “Sherl, we're going to a party, it's not like a formal do or anything. There's just going to be a bunch of drunk teenagers celebrating Christmas. You don't need to wear anything special.” The older teen grins before digging into his chest of drawers.
“Let it out, sweetheart. Let me hear it. Tell me how good it feels.” John whispers, kissing Sherlock's neck.
“Because that was … unbelievable. And fantastic. And you've always been the best decision I ever made.” John smiles, pulling out slowly and curling up next to his boyfriend.
"As I said, I had a 'thing' for you. In fact, I was tempted to take you up on your offer." Sherlock replied, crawling into John's lap.
"Well, I could use other ways." Sherlock smiled seductively as his hand roamed down John's chest and towards his crotch.
“What's there to regret, Sherl, I like you. Have done for a while actually. Shame no one was ever convinced with me lying. I thought they might end up telling you and you'd switch rooms.” John replies, kissing Sherlock's neck slowly.
Sherlock looks up at John, a soft smile spreading across his lips as he puts the equipment down and walks over to his boyfriend.
Sherlock moaned in response, grinding his hips into John’s causing the doctor to moan and respond in kind.
They kissed lazily as Sherlock finished washing John before the older man returned the favour, smiling as Sherlock watched him.
“Baby, don't you remember last night? I thought I'd be the one with the hazy memory due to alcohol but you, you were barely even tipsy.”
Greg bites his lip and grabs Mycroft's hand, pulling him towards his dorm-room so he can make his boyfriend pay for that obscene use of his name.
“What sort of friend … would I be … if I did that?” John asks breathlessly, taking a deep breath in before letting it out slowly.
Sherlock hummed and looked up at the older man, loving how easy John was to manipulate. He felt himself get harder as he watched the water from the shower run down John's chest and disappear into his crotch.
“Shut it.” Greg snaps, before breaking into a smile. “What about you and Sherlock anyway? I've never heard him say
For once, Sherlock was terrified, more than he'd ever been in his life and he decided not to ask again.
“Fuck your brains out? Make you scream my name to the heavens? Make you feel like you'll never walk again? Oh yeah, been meaning to talk to you about it for weeks but didn't want to freak you out.” John replies, grinning at his mate's reaction.
“For presents, actually, John.” Sherlock corrected with a smile, “I've taught you well, Harriet. And I'm so proud of you.” He adds, high-fiving his daughter.
"You were drunk. As I recall, you said; 'You know something, Sherlock, you're incredibly attractive and have amazing eyes. I'm surprised women aren't all over you. And, if I wasn't certain I was straight, I'd probably go out with you. Is that weird?' So I asked if you were saying that you fancied me and you replied; 'Of course, who wouldn't? And with that body of yours, I bet you're amazing in the sack'."
"It comes close? I show you an amazing time machine like this and it only 'comes close' to impressing you? Honestly, I knew I should have chosen a regular human."
His worst fears come true when Mycroft, now an official government official, brings him the file. Which of course, Sherlock isn't supposed to see but in Mycroft's rare act of kindness, he breaks every rule he can, just so his little brother is the first to know.
Greg smiles sadly at his partner, so rare it is that he is prone to emotion and sentiment that Greg sometimes forgets how capable he is of such human things.
An old woman across from them throws the teens a glare and huffs, making it known that apparently that kind of talk isn't welcome in a café at 11am.
John and Sherlock have been friends since Sherlock was seven years old when John decided to befriend the 'freak'.
Mr Cambria makes a move to get up but Sherlock is faster; lifting him off his feet and pinning him to the wall by his throat.
"Ah, an old friend of mine, Princess." Sherlock grinned, picking his daughter up and hugging her tightly.
“I want to experience it all, John. And I want it to be with you.” Sherlock says desperately, looking at John with pleading eyes.
“Sounds good. Well, I best head out, love. I start class in five.” John smiles, kissing Sherlock softly.
“No, we don't. I met a child who appeared to be ten years old but was actually one hundred years old. She'd survived the war only by being bitten by a vampire.”
"It's your fault, you bloody tease." John growled and jumped on Sherlock, biting his neck teasingly.
Sherlock smiles shyly at his boyfriend, gently pulling him down onto the bed and climbing on top of him to kiss him softly.
“Right, if you're going to scream about it, we're going back to our room. No arguments.” John replies, grabbing his text book and bag.
the pros and cons of a relationship with you.” John smiles softly, leaning over and touching Sherlock's face.
Maggie looks out the patio doors and sees the vampires disappear into the night, secretly hoping she'll see them again one day.
“I know, love. I'm a doctor, I knew I was going to die if you didn't turn me. But I meant what I said, I love you, Sherlock. I did from the moment we kissed.” John replies, wiping tears from his mate's face.
“I've broken every law I am meant to uphold bringing you this information, Sherlock. I could be tried with treason.”
He sorts the mess of curls into some sort of tidiness before covering Sherlock's eyes and spraying hairspray all over the younger man's head.
John bites his lip to prevent a moan and spreads Sherlock's legs wider. He lifts the younger man's hips and pushes into him slowly, watching as Sherlock arches up.
“I love it when you talk dirty.” John grins, pulling out and shoving back in before Sherlock can think of a witty remark.
"Wait, how many presents have you bought her? The only one I know about is the psychic necklace." Sherlock asks suddenly.
So if you're reading my other fic Our Love Is A Tragedy, you'll know that I promised to update that before anything else but I'm struggling with inspiration.
Amy grabs another bottle of wine from the fridge and places it on the counter before grabbing some more crisps and pouring them into some bowls.
“Fine.” Sherlock sighs dramatically, going into his wardrobe to look for appropriate clothing. “What does one wear to something like this?”
“We're doing great, yeah, mate. What about you and Mycroft?” John smirks back, sipping his tea gratefully.
"I know, it's Dimensionally Transcendental, which means the larger interior can fit inside the smaller exterior. It also has a chameleon circuit, enabling the machine to blend in with its surroundings. It takes a lot to impress me, Doctor but this definitely comes close." Sherlock replied, looking around at the machine.
Davies, Sherlock thinks he's called, in all honesty he hasn't bothered to remember his first name, after all, he's just a warm body for Sherlock to abuse.
“Sir. You need to see this.” She gasps, leaning on the door frame for support as she continues, “And bring Greg and Sherlock with you.”
John suddenly gasps and Sherlock looks up into his eyes; completely black which can only mean that he's survived being turned.
from your work and we've just started talking. Right. I might forget all that. Useless information stored in my mind palace usually gets erased.”
Anyway, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at my husband. For looking around for a new mate. Really, Sherlock, going for a younger model! And
Maggie disappears back through the patio doors to her friends, completely baffled as to what just happened.
John splutters on the smoke in his lungs and blushes bright red, coughing out a “Oh God.” before waving his two friends goodbye and heading back to college.
"Telepathic connection. She felt your pain of loss and love. I had to be sure you were going back for the right reasons. The TARDIS sensed your love for John and showed me what you'd done for him."
The younger man buried his face in John's neck as the older man got to work, slowly stroking Sherlock to completion.
“Oh, you’re definitely your father’s daughter, alright. Same dramatic flair.” John grinned at his daughter, who shot him a glare in response.
“Piss off, Lestrade. You can't tell me what to do.” Sherlock scoffs, grabbing his mobile and wallet from the table.
Sherlock tugs his jeans and boxers off in one, throwing them off the side of the bed before remembering how sticky he is.
“I don't want him as a mate, brother dear. I'm trying to stop you from having your throat ripped out.” Mycroft replies calmly.
John smiles and goes back to kissing Sherlock's neck, nibbling slightly as he pulls Sherlock tighter.
“Me too.” Sherlock replies softly, kissing John's forehead. “This is all I ever could have asked for, falling for my best friend.”
make an attractive couple. Sherlock being lean and beautiful while John is broader but equally as handsome.
“Me too!” Greg giggles back, clinking their bottles together with a grin. “Ooh, guess what … I know a secret you don't know.”
John wakes up to a pleasant surprise as he opens his eyes and sees Sherlock doing something very unexpected; sucking John's cock.
And Sherlock spent the following two years doing heroin, getting blind drunk and doing sexual favours for anyone and everyone.
Greg barely manages to catch Sherlock as he collapses; the shock of what her simple words mean to an already fragile heart.
“Yeah, they look fine. You okay, Sherl?” John replies, looking at Sherlock curiously as he sees the blush on the younger teen's face.
They travel back to Mycroft's home in silence, the only sound being Sherlock's occasional muttering and grumbling about stupid brothers and how useless they are.
His smile faltered at John's words "Don't be dead." as though even his eyes hadn't believed what they'd seen. But whatever the reason, Sherlock had sworn to protect John at all costs because if
“Ah, baby, we were just talking about you. All good things, obviously.” Greg purrs, practically sauntering over to his boyfriend.
It's not a bad year but very different from my own, I must say. And I do miss John and Sherlock terribly.
He checks his wounded shoulder and sees that it's healed quite well considering, even though there's an ugly scar left behind.
"Why? I can't give her anything. I can't love, John. I'm trying to but I can't." Sherlock replied, the mask slowly crumbling and revealing the detective's true emotions.
Once Sherlock had shrugged his shoulders and closed the door, the Doctor ran up the steps of 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock stands and makes his way to the door, determined not to be dragged into the lovers quarrel.
“Shortly after John went into the army, I found Sherlock high in his room. It was weed at the time and I hoped that if he must do drugs to cope with his situation, then that's as bad as it would get. Until two years later when I found him unconscious with a needle in his arm. You were liaison for a case in Cardiff at the time so I felt no need to worry you.” Mycroft replies carefully, standing in front of the fire place  with his arms behind his back.
“Of course I would, love. Distance doesn't mean I'd want you any less.” John replies surely, reaching out to touch Sherlock's curls.
They walk in silence for while, passing by the different shops on the way back to Greg and Mycroft's university, both teens thinking about their boyfriends and where they'll be in a few years.
Sherlock is just about to reply when he hears a noise from the shadows and steps in front of Maggie.
“Yes. Sleep now, my love.” Sherlock replies, kissing John before turning round and snuggling against his mate.
“Then bloody well act like one. What would John say?” Greg replies, opening the car door for Sherlock.
“He hasn't? Shit, he told Mycroft he'd shagged that little prick Victor.” Greg chuckles, nudging John in the arm.
John giggles again, putting his make up away. “There, you're done.” He smiles, grabbing his hair gel to do his hair.
John set a glass of orange down for Harriet and handed a tea to Sherlock before sitting down and grabbing his own breakfast.
We wrestle a bit longer until I manage to throw him off me and back into the alley he dived out of, I instantly leap on him and use my strength to wrestle the knife out of his hands so he resorts to punching and kicking me instead.
John drops to his knees as pain overwhelms him; holding a hand to his side to keep pressure on his wound.
"Sherlock Holmes, right? I’m the Doctor. Did you know that one day a man is going to write stories about you? He's called ..."
“Yes, Sherlock. You look like a doll.” John replies distractedly, shoving on his boots and lacing them up.
John tries to suppress the moan in his throat at his husband's authority but it comes out as a whimper and Sherlock's eyes go black at the sound.
John turns the shower on, pulling Sherlock under it so the water soaks them both, the younger teen follows a drop of water running down John's body and dropping off his hip to join the puddle on the floor. The older teen grabs the shampoo and squeezes a generous amount into his hand before reaching up and rubbing Sherlock curls to wash out the gel and hairspray.
John pulls out his favourite pair of faded grey skinny jeans and his tight black shirt; deciding that the full Goth-Rock look would be a bit too much for a party.
He signals to Sally Donovan to send the rest of his force in to make arrests and climbs back into his car.
They all knew the truth but he was glad for Mrs Hudson's rambles, it made him feel less guilty for leaving.
Anyway, I was eight years old when I first met the Doctor; the mad man in his time machine. It was completely by accident. I was at the park and a strange creature ran past me, followed by a strange man.
“I don't feel as hungry, if that's what you mean. Now I just feel horny as hell and want to fuck your brains out.” John chuckles to himself.
“Actually, our little rendezvous on the couch made me... um... well, I thought I could see to that myself and have you watch.”
"Where are we?" Sherlock ran to the Doctor excitedly. "And who's that little girl?" He added with confusion.
John giggles before replying, “It's deep purple and so tight it looks like you've sown yourself into it. You trying to impress someone?”
Mycroft immediately jumps up, helping Greg and his little brother to their feet and not even bothering to straighten out his suit as he bolts through the door.
“Yes, I am. And be careful, the last boy to say my name like that I threatened to fuck him across a table.” Greg smirks back, a mock serious tone in his voice.
John stops just at the door and admires his boyfriend hard at work; who's clearly already forgotten about Kate.
quickly about-faced and all but ran down the stairs back to her flat, giggling all the way. She noticed that every time after that, either the door had been locked or the boys had the good sense to do it in the bedroom.
“You don't … wanna know.” John stutters, trying to breathe as Sherlock continues to run a delicate finger up and down his cock.
Sherlock starts to breath properly again, gingerly standing up and willing his brain and feet to work together.
“Too much, mate! I'm fuckin' wasted. But, it's a fan-tastic party. I bloody luv it.” Greg grins, straightening himself and gripping John's shoulder for support.
“Believe it or not, they gave me some supplies to fix it up myself. Apparently they needed me alive for something.” John replies with a humourless laugh.
"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Sherlock. As much as I hate to admit, even people like us can love someone."
Sherlock takes a deep breath before sprinting down the street; the houses becoming a blur as his speed picks up to an inhuman pace.
“You shall.” John grins, grabbing his own bag and taking one last look at Sherlock before leaving their room.
“I understand. Well then, I'll have to make sure we both feed regularly then.” John smiles, kissing Sherlock's curls.
Harriet grabbed the rest of her presents and made her way out of the room when she heard her dad call her name.
The young girl in question ran into the kitchen and jumped into a chair. Before she started to eat, she eyed her fathers’ carefully, noting the flushness of their cheeks and the ruffled state they were both in. Harriet rolled her eyes and started to tuck into her food.
Greg stands and makes his way over to his partner, wrapping his arms around his waist and resting his head on his shoulder.
it.” John's grin grows bigger and he kisses Sherlock soft and slow, rubbing the excess shampoo into his skin.
“Holmes? You mean, Mycroft? Mycroft sent you?” John asks in disbelief, holding a hand up to shield his eyes.
Sherlock makes a noise in his throat and John grins in satisfaction. Sherlock lets out another noise that sounds very much like a purr and it makes John shiver down to his core..
Unfortunately, John is only half awake and trying to get his bearings so his brain is not fully aware enough to enjoy the experience.
“Keep going. Come on, baby. Keep going, please.” John moaned encouragement to the younger man and that was enough to send Sherlock over the edge and cause a white blur behind his eyes as he came loudly.
Then the vampire turns on the mistress, grabbing her and shoving her against the wall with such force that she too blacks out.
“That's some wake up method you have there.” John grins, running his fingers through his boyfriend's messy curls.
“Yes, Sherlock. It is. But it's better than having a daughter who blackmails people. You're going to turn her into a criminal, Sherlock.”
“Sherly! Ya came! Come 'ere and give me a hug!” Greg grins, stumbling into Sherlock; who gives him an awkward hug before pushing him away.
“Thank fuck for that.” John grins, flopping back down onto the bed and wrapping Sherlock in his arms.
“Then what do you propose, Sherlock? Turning him into a vampire? Are you even going to ask him or just bite him and hope he's okay with it?” Mrs Hudson snaps, wondering how her poor boy could be so reckless.
“Where do you think we'll be in ten years?” He asks curiously, stroking back some of Sherlock's curls.
“And besides if he sees you as a friend then at least you can stay mates.” Amy smiles, giving her friend a reassuring squeeze on her arm.
“What do you … Oh, right.” John stutters, seeing Sherlock's erection through his pants. “I … Um, okay.”
to … we should take this slow.” John replies, finally looking his boyfriend in the eyes and stroking his cheek.
Sherlock smiled into John’s lips, pushing gently into John, causing him to moan and shift his hips for better leverage.
“Well, we’ll have breakfast first and when Mrs Hudson takes Harry to school, we can have some … fun.” Sherlock grinned wickedly.
When Moriarty told Sherlock he would burn the heart out of him, Sherlock knew things wouldn't be so simple. He was naive enough to believe that when he 'killed' himself, John would be safe but it was all too simple.
In all fairness, John did receive the letter two weeks ago but with all the course work he's had, he sort of forgot about it. And now, he's just told Sherlock he's leaving in
As Sherlock gets back to their dorm, he slams the door in John's face and the older teen sighs and rolls his eyes.
Even in his half-waking state, the doctor could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him and almost trying to will him to full awakening. John chuckled and opened his eyes; his deduction being correct.
“I should let you suffer, Holmes. Don't think I don't know manipulation when I see it.” John smirked dangerously, seeing Sherlock's disappointed expression.
“Yes, I heard. Now, if you're quite done discussing our sexual positions to John, I think Sherlock would like to have his boyfriend back.”
“This is going to take a while, I want to worship you. I want to take care of you. But most of all, I want to love you, Sherlock.” John whispers into Sherlock's ear as he moves in and out of him.
Now ignoring the fact that there is a vampire in her kitchen at ten to seven in the morning, Maggie decides to continue what she set out to do; make a cup of tea and some breakfast.
“After breakfast it is then.” John sighed, moving his hand back up Sherlock’s chest and letting it rest there.
John smiled softly at his partner and ran his fingers through his damp hair, pulling him in for a kiss.
Sherlock moans into John's mouth before blushing as he realises that his erection is probably digging into the older teen's thigh and he can feel it. He pushes John off and dives off the bed in a flash.
“Finally he says it as it is. About bloody time, dear brother.” Sherlock remarks in the silence left behind, walking out the room and up the stairs.
They watched as the future Sherlock waited for someone to answer the door, and Sherlock mirrored his fidgety future self.
Will Sherlock kiss his best friend because he's had a crush on him for four years or will he back out to save his friendship?
“Mr Cambria, don't … do this. You're already wanted for … murder, you don't want to make … it worse.” John tries to reason, struggling for breath.
He kisses back gently, wrapping his arms round my waist protectively. I instinctively wrap my own arms round his neck, pulling him close and deepening the kiss.
The older teen goes back into the bedroom to put on his skull necklace and black leather stud bracelets.
“Sherl, I've always loved you. You're my best mate and, sure, I thought that if you ever needed advice on dating or you had a crush on someone then I'd be there for you. If you'd have told me that it was
“I love you and I always miss you when we're apart, Sher.” John chuckles, resting his hands on Sherlock's hips.
“Well, if it's so confidential, you shouldn't have brought it here then.” Mrs Hudson replies, turning around and leaving.
“Fine, whatever. Kid wouldn't even give it up anyway. Take the stupid prick, see if I care.” Davies laughs, letting go of Sherlock.
Did you like my little bit at the end. I had to add in my special guest just to bring the story back full circle :p xxxx
Unfortunately, Greg doesn't want to listen and instead storms out into the rainy night, I'm tempted to follow him but being Sherlock's flatmate probably isn't the best standing point right now.
"I'll be with you in a moment, just have to make a call." The Doctor replied, waving his mobile at Sherlock.
“Let's work up to that, baby? First, let's try this.” John smiles mischievously, rolling Sherlock over and sliding down his body.
“I'll be back up soon, dear. I have some things to sort out before your party.” She smiled, turning and leaving the room.
"You have beautiful eyes. Mine are just dull and plain, like me." John said sadly, staring at his very beautiful partner.
He looks down into his partner's face and sees his own tears reflected there, the lives of three men turned on their heads because of one man; John Hamish Watson.
Mr Cambria is thrown from his feet; the weapon he used to stab John flying across the room as the mistress stands there shaking in terror.
He walks down the stairs, quickly but carefully, listening to John's breathing as it becomes more harsh.
“Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. She must have forgiven you, or she wouldn't be here now.” John replies, curling round his new mate.
That's all the consent Sherlock needs as he digs his fangs into John's neck, still crying and holding the older man close.
She jumps as she walks into the kitchen and finds the vampire from last night standing there, a cup in his hand.
“I'll explain later, Gregory. Right now though, we should make our way to our home. It's been a long enough wait for my little brother.” Mycroft replies with determination, “Thank you, Anthea, my dear.”
“Ah, well my dinner's at twelve. What about yours?” John asks, grabbing a t-shirt and some jeans from his wardrobe.
This follows on from the last chapter but about two months into John and Sherlock's relationship. It's a long one so bare with me :) xxx
Greg grins back, walking into the room and clapping John on the shoulder as the doctor let's go of Sherlock.
“Keep going. I want this.” Sherlock says softly, reaching down to run his fingers through John's hair.
John just gets into his college building as one of the female tutors screams and runs out of the science lab that Sherlock was occupying before John went to lunch.
He leans in slowly, pressing his lips to Sherlock's softly. Sherlock responds slowly, moving his lips slightly to accommodate the height difference.
Almost as though he realises this, Sherlock pulls off to give his boyfriend a few minutes to wake up.
We're heading to the take away when our favourite murderer jumps out of an alleyway; presumably he knew I was on to him and decided to take matters into his own hands.
. Fuck me, please.” Sherlock moans, running his hands down to John's arse as he continues to grind against him.
!" John's voice almost broke on the last word; the truth of the situation being thrown into an argument that could make or break their relationship,
We wrestle and fight and I tell John to run for Scotland Yard as it isn't that far from here. Besides I need as little witnesses as possible for what I'm about to do next.
John is fully naked on the bed and looks over at Sherlock as he enters; taking in Sherlock's naked form as each part of skin is revealed.
Sherlock flinches slightly but doesn't push John away, he just breathes deeply and waits for the pain to give way to pleasure.
Of course, he's upped Sherlock's and Greg's security clearances but who is going to listen to his junkie brother, and a mere Detective Inspector isn't exactly of the highest ranking.
He walks back down the dark hallway, intent on having words with the younger Holmes and as he reaches the entrance, he grabs the younger man roughly, practically dragging him to the car.
“I told you I'd make it good for you, baby. And it was, wasn't it? I bet you've been wanting to do that for a while. I
John just sits on the desk and grins, watching his boyfriend's mental struggle and wondering what else he can convince him to do.
Mycroft falls silent before whispering softly, “How did we get here, Gregory? We used to know each other so well. We used to be happy.”
“Yep, that's the one. We're Black Ops. Special Forces.” The operative replies, herding John and the others into a chopper.
As the door explodes, Doctor John Watson and his troop jump in fear, those kinds of explosions never mean anything good is about to happen.
John stalks closer to Sherlock and flashes his fangs in warning, causing Maggie to take a few steps back.
“It's just a precaution, my love. I nearly … I nearly attacked her once … I hadn't fed in days but I'd had heroin at the time and I … I went for her.” Sherlock murmurs softly, lying down properly.
The younger teen hisses in pain at first but tries to breathe through it, focusing on the sensation.
“I'm so glad she doesn't want to use that thing around us. You can hardly control yourself at the best of times.”
“John, do you think these ...” Sherlock breaks off as he sees his best friend walking around in his underwear.
John feels his heart pounding in his chest at the realisation that once again he's on the brink of death.
"See what you make me do? You never show any interest in our daughter, ever! She tries to talk to you but you're too wrapped up in your bloody experiments!"
“Don't care. Busy.” Sherlock mumbles into John's neck, moving to leave a love bite on the older teen's collarbone.
She blushed as one particular moment came to mind where she'd walked in on them when John had Sherlock bent over their desk while he was going for it like a champion.
Mrs Hudson answers and immediately gasps in horror, noticing the blood covering John's jumper as Sherlock pushes past her.
“Oh, right. Well, I thought that's what we were about to do.” Sherlock replies, blushing bright pink.
“Come on. Your hair will be a nightmare to brush if we don't wash it soon.” John smiles, climbing over his boyfriend and pulling him up off the bed.
“Y .. Yes. Doctor Watson. I'm … I'm Doctor Watson.” John replies nervously, adrenaline coursing through his veins.
Gosh, there's been a hell of a wait for this one. Sorry about that guys, real life does have a habit of getting in the way. Anyway, a long awaited update is here :) xxxx
“Yeah, but half your record convictions will be spent by the time you train to become a cop. And besides, if Mycroft really is going into the government, I'm sure he'd make that record disappear.” John smiles, leaning against the wall and taking the cigarette from Greg.
John can tell that Greg doesn't even try to argue with the detective, clearly picking up the tone in his voice and trusting Sherlock to sort it.
parts of your anatomy this early in the relationship.” Sherlock replies with a smile that John can only be described as
“Now, tell me. What the hell have you been doing to yourself?” John cries, stepping back and looking his partner up and down.
“Oh God, we're dating emotionally stunted men. If we were women, our mates would be telling us to pack up and go. And we'd be meeting up to have a good cry about it.” Greg sighs, picking up his coffee.
“Under the bed were you threw them last night while you were sulking.” John replies, opening another bedside drawer and pulling out a bottle of whiskey.
“Well, I'm home now, love. So we can sort this, can't we?” John replies softly, pulling his partner back into his arms.
Sherlock bites his lip and continues to thrust slowly into John's mouth, until John speeds up in his assault and Sherlock can no longer hold back anymore; driving his cock into his boyfriend's mouth hard and fast.
"Harry, I'm so sorry." John replied, grabbing his daughter and hugging her tight. "Go to your room, sweetheart."
What happens when John is finally found alive, after those two years, with a bullet in his shoulder?
I know eaves-dropping is wrong, Dad's always telling Father off for it but I've always been a curious person, so what Dad doesn't see, doesn't matter.
"Of course it is. You're perfect, John. You're very handsome, have a great physique and extremely beautiful eyes." Sherlock replied, running his hands over John's face.
“Behave yourselves. Please.” Harriet sighed, leaving the room and directing her friends to her bedroom.
“You alright there, Sher? Don't tell me I'm stood here washing your hair and your having dirty fantasies about me.” John grins, moving into his boyfriend's body and running his hands down his chest.
“This is nice. I could get used to this.” John sighs happily, once they're both back curled up in bed together.
So instead, I turn to look at Sherlock as he looks over at me and I find myself staring into his beautiful icy blue eyes. Suddenly, I feel like for the first time ever we're actually in sync with each other. He walks up to me and I unconsciously move into him; our bodies almost touching.
He's forty something, the oldest Sherlock has gone for so far but maybe that's because he has good heroin.
“Oh, yes, because turning you into an immortal blood drinker during sex would have surely made you the most
says that! It's not you, it's me … and then they walk out on you! I can't have that from you, Sherlock! We've been best friends for years ...”
The only sound is their breathing in the cool night air, not even the city can be heard around here.
John tugs Sherlock's jeans and boxers down a little way, pulling Sherlock's erection out. Sherlock freezes up and his breath quickens.
"Let's stay in tonight, John. I want to spend time with you and Harriet." Sherlock practically purred as John continued to stroke his hair.
He pulls off his t-shirt and baggy pants, throwing them into the wash basket in the bathroom as Sherlock continues to search for an outfit.
“Ooohh I see. Mycroft's got you on a chain with a big yard, has he?” John grins, nudging his friend.
John lubes himself up quickly and slowly lines himself up to Sherlock's entrance and pushing in slightly.
“Come here.” John smiles softly, blobbing a bit of gel onto his hands and styling Sherlock's hair with it.
Sherlock sucks his boyfriend off with slow, long strokes, making sure to lick the underside while John moans low in his throat.
“I haven’t finished yet.” Sherlock scolded and was graced with a teasing smile in return. “So, yes, I was thinking, how would you feel about morning sex? We’ve never actually done it due to Harriet’s school schedule but Mrs Hudson has offered to take her to school today so we … will have the flat … to ourselves.” Sherlock grinned, punctuating the last half of his speech for affect.
"Thank you, John. For always being so kind, especially towards someone like me." Sherlock whispers, his eyes still fixed on mine.
“Some vampires are born human and some are turned. Well, you've probably read the books. Anyway, Sherlock and his family are vampires, his mother was turned by a rogue vampire. And so both Sherlock and his brother were born vampires. Sherlock is a danphia. Half vampire, half human. I don't suppose he's told you the story of his mother. Has he? No, he wouldn't have. Anyway, we'd been living together two years before Sherlock turned me. A week after he did, we got married.”
“You know I'm a stronger vampire given my build and my army training! And don't shout at me! I'm not the one
“Oh, God. Sherlock, you're a terrible man.” John moaned, gripping Sherlock's damp hair tightly as the younger man did that terribly wonderful thing with his tongue.
The next time I met him, I was eleven. This time, he looked sad as though he'd been hurt by someone.
I can't help myself now, there's something about him in that moment. I lean in and kiss him. I don't know what makes me do it, just that it feels right.
“When we're not point scoring? Yes, we are, my dear.” Mycroft replies softly, touching  the photo frames on the mantle.
John slowly climbs back onto the bed and gently pushes Sherlock down, settling himself between his boyfriend's long legs and kissing him slowly.
I've just finished drinking my meal when I hear John's shuffled footsteps heading into the kitchen; I quickly wipe my mouth and wash the glass before turning to look at him.
“Leave you alone for a year and you're already hunting for a new mate. I thought we were passed that, Sherlock. And a poor young woman too. I'm disappointed in you.” The older vampire sighs, looking a little hurt despite his tone.
“You're such a child, John. Bloody hell. Besides, what can I say, Mycroft is a real slut in the bedroom.” Greg grins, only trying to provoke the old lady further.
“That's just it, I don't. I would wait around for you. I'd wait until you came back on holidays and I'd wait until you came back for good. But would you still want me then?” Sherlock asks, sitting up with his back to John.
“Mycroft, piss off home. I don't need you.” Sherlock calls down, knowing that even over the tv, he'll hear him.
“What's wrong with my shirt?” Sherlock asks, his voice going up higher a few notches, before he coughs to clear his throat.
John moans and bites his lip, still surprised at Sherlock's new found confidence in his sexuality and how he teases the older teen with it.
John sighs softly and allows sleep to take over him once more, and if Sherlock invades his dreams then that wouldn't be so bad.
“I'm in love with you too, Sherlock. I think I always have been.” John sighs softly, nuzzling Sherlock's hair and breathing in the scent of his shampoo.
wish, more like, sweet-cheeks. Mikey says I have the body of a God and I'm the best shag he's ever had.” Greg grins back, nudging his friend again.
fucking Romeo and Juliet. Star crossed bloody lovers who topped themselves at the end, yeah, right. We're just Greg and Mycroft. No labels.”
The waitress returns with the muffin and smiles sweetly at John, taking his money and heading back to the counter.
Sherlock just stares at his pale fingers splayed across John's slightly darker tanned chest, moving his fingers experimentally.
. And this 'friend' could be some … some weirdo. For God's sake, put your bloody experiment down and look at me, Sherlock!" John replied, slamming his fist down on the table.
“Yes, well, maybe just a nibble.” Sherlock replied, even as he piled his plate with fried eggs, bacon and sausages.
“Arrest him. For drug possession with intent to sell.” Greg tells the assisting police officers he texted before he entered.
“For coming over to talk to me when we were little. For always accepting me … For not taking advantage of me earlier.”
“His troop was captured and they have been missing since. Six men missing and four dead, it's a bloody cock-up.” Mycroft growls, revealing his true feelings for once.
John closes the door softly, drops his bag on the floor and carefully makes his way over to Sherlock.
” Sherlock replies awkwardly, looking down at his pants and trying to make John understand. “I mean,
"It's okay." He assures me. “John, there's something you should know, I meant to tell you but I didn't know how you'd react ...”
“You always be my fallen angel, Sher.” John breathes into Sherlock's lips, causing the younger teen to chuckle softly.
The Doctor flicked switches and turned dials and with a whoosh, the time machine disappeared into the vortex.
John deftly dodges the second swing but isn't prepared for a sharp stab to his chest; the husband of the dead wife coming into view.
He drops me on the couch and lifts up my shirt, I just barely hear the gasp of shock before everything goes black.
“Answer me, William!” Mycroft yells, roughly grabbing his younger brother by the chin and forcing him to look him in the eyes.
