Good thing Lestrade quickly grabbed Sherlock before he dropped onto the ground, Sherlock's head was pounding.
saw someone come into the house with his mum."
"Well
"All this for a favour, Sherlock?" John was torn between punching and throttling his stupidly selfish flatmate.
Sherlock's head was already perked up and his brain ready to soak up the whole conversation. John was grumbling to himself, because Sherlock was going to be a git and enter his mind palace and didn't even have the decency to let John borrow the flannel once. Freezing in the flat was not a real option at the moment, especially if you're naked.
That was when John froze. How the heck did that man know he was a doctor? To the rest of the world he didn’t even exist. Unless...
"Just this once?
This was probably a conversation he never expected himself to be caught in.
Sorry for not updating, unfortunately I reread this fic and I killed myself with anticipation. I mean,
Forgive me? Welp, I was too caught up with drawing other fandoms I sort of set this aside.
"Clearly we both can't bear the feeling of overwhelming idiocy."
the world had to be a confusing place, and it just so happened that it decided to start picking on him.
Sherlock wants to know where John got his inexplicable information from.
Sherlock blinked at the paper and read it's counterpart;
I though you had 25/20 or so vision, what's the point of-
"Who's gone?"
event in history similar to theirs. It would suck if he was stuck like this forever. A cold draft of the room paused his train of thoughts.
Sherlock remained hunched over the napkin with a piece of graphite in hand and continued to ignore the doctor, so John decided to grab the food anyway.
Sherlock could use really John's smile on someone he really hates, someone like ANDERSON.
"But-" Sherlock cut John off with a glare and grimaced as a new wave of pain flooded his head. Bloody transport. The blond's expression showed concern, but he reluctantly turned to Sherlock's room. Sherlock sighed when the pain suddenly subsided.
Mycroft turned slightly and gave John the death glare before he walked over to Sherlock's bed ignoring them both. John rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out at Anthena hoping to crack up the political spirit.
Yet, now they can.
"Welcome to London."
"John I'm sincerely sorry but I have to leave. I paid for the food," Lestrade looked at his phone, "I have to run. If you don't mind, I'll be needing you at the scene again tomorrow if possible. Stop looking at me like that Holmes, John gives more input than your quick claims. I know I don't do this often. Look, if you need anything ask Sherlock for my number. I mean there's no escaping the law anyway, you helped NSYPD out today."
"Lestrade, you may call me Mycroft. Mrs Hudson I believe that you may have some mice crawling around your floors, I will call over someone to take care of that for you. As of Sherlock..." Mycroft Holmes stood up and contemplated about the whereabouts of his younger brother and his companion.
John pointed nervously at something else on the mantelpiece, "That's a skull."
That reminded him, the human. It should be safe to talk the the voice now.
"I'll-I'll explain later. Look Sherlock, I'll see you tomorrow right? I'll just leave now." John muttered softly. Sherlock stood and walked across the room, half expecting the blond to leave too. John just stared after him.
The wind blew coolly onto Sherlock's face and he resisted the urge to grab a cigarette.
Sherlock snapped his head up, as Lestrade also hurriedly reached for his gun, at the direction of the voice. Out in the darkness, stood a dark silhouette of a man.
"Yup, just got into a dispute nothin' else," John quickly replied in a shrill voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock watched John walk up to him from a few metres away. Half of the detective's mind was frustrated by their find and the other part was satisfied that John was walking in a straight line with no signs of a limp.
"Whoa! That'sa neat trick, now you made two of you!"
(See the end of the chapter for
John's ears were ringing as he ran off hearing a series of similar offensive phrases and honking string behind him.
"Sergeant Sally Donovan, only authorised personals can enter this crime scene," Donovan said firmly, "Unless you're a witness, suspect, or you work for the New Scotland Yard you may not enter."
Sherlock swiftly brought out 221c's keys and dangled them in front of John's face.
"Problem?" Anthena stared at John, "Oh, I keep forgetting, you're new in this section; anyway, the affluent spirits all tell their children ahead of time. Supposed to make them more independent."
I didn't mean to accuse you, Lestrade. I apologize Lestrade. T^T
Wow. Now that I look back... I find this a bit adorable.
" John climbed into the lift(elevator), and Sherlock knew that he only had a few seconds left. He felt like he was trapped in a time loop as his body sluggishly responded to his commands. Sherlock's mind was racing with a new desperation, "
It belonged to a tall young man wearing a long black coat who was walking toward some taped scene. John could only see a part of the man's face before he could come to a positive conclusion. The man, whose back was facing John once again, had walked up to a woman and exchanged a few words before ducking underneath something and then disappearing altogether.
"Afternoon, John," Anthena said as she glanced up from her blackberry.
Interesting, he had been stuck in a bundle of what could only be observably described as gigantic clothing in a span of a few minutes. His own clothing, along with everything else, was noticeably larger by a great scale.
Lestrade entered the room with a stupefied expression, Mycroft does tend to exaggerate his decorations. Sherlock scoffed at the DI face before jumping out of Mycroft's chair and then landing on the mat purposely scrunching the fibres. If one word could express what Sherlock was feeling at the moment was; bored.
"You have absolutely NO RIGHT to hold me here!" someone shouted, then the door swung open rather hard nearly bursting John's eardrums.
Please comment if you want to include anything.
"Sherlock..."
like S-Holmes doesn't-"
Holmes brought back a broken boy.
He's done the impossible, he's met his long lost child, and the feeling of accomplishment was overwhelming, but now what?
"Wait-- what? You have a newborn, how did you get in a fight--" he could hear the eye-roll, "Never mind, just hurry up! It's not that hard to travel here."
"And I, William Murray-"
"Which one was it? In Afghanistan or Iraq?" Sherlock replied impatiently.
"Sir. Mister Holmes wisely advised for you to leave. A car will arrive soon and lead you back to your flat, he sends his regrets."
John's smile was beyond average, what any normal human being would call plain creepy.
need to know where that creep of your brother puts his cameras."
John just sat there staring at his food as if he didn't know what to do with it. Sherlock eventually asked for the cold case and the DI reluctantly gave him the file.
Details, he needed more details. Sherlock had to see how John smiles.
"Morning Lestrade," Sherlock said as he opened the door out of 221C.
Then how did they know Sherlock would find it?
"I dealt with a case like this before, something to do with a stolen government experiment and invisible ink."
The Detective Inspector grinned at Sherlock, "Just meet someone interesting today. Thought you might want to check him out."
He sighed and lifted two fingers in a circular motion across his other hand, then vanished.
John sighed, "Just don't freak out."
"Friend of mine. When I say ‘friend’...." Sherlock stared at the skull himself and then took off his Belstaff and scarf.
John noted when he saw the streets. John giggled as he felt people brush by him, this had to be a dream. Something within him told him it was already half past noon. As he peered across the road, he saw a head of familiar dark curls.
"Er, any problems just let us know," John smiled politely then slammed the taxi's door shut.
"Lestrade, the paper. There's something behind it," Sherlock gripped the DI's shoulder in pain. Lestrade glanced down at the pitiful sight in disdain, but seeing Sherlock's desperate look he reached down to grab the fallen article.
The lights suddenly turned off and John blinked trying to adjust his vision, he could see the man in front of him was red and frowning. Then something snapped in his mind, no. It couldn't be...
"For a request such as yours, you'll see him at dinner. But first, we've got this case to solve."
Lestrade ended up storming out of the Scotland Yard building, his face twitching in annoyance.
The silhouette suddenly slumped and disappeared, Sherlock heard a cry behind him.
"You can take them off now, kiddo," John hoped that his belief was right, he waited as the boy uncovered his face.
So he ran across the street towards the person's general direction but stopped when he heard the sudden sound of tyres screeching on his right side.
After three minutes and 44 seconds, Lestrade finally called up his club of idiotic policemen and policewomen to invade the flat.
Lestrade answered with a gasp and twisted himself out of the chair, ran down the flight of 17 steps, out through the door, and onto Baker Street leaving the (rather startled) Sergeant behind. He quickly scavenged through the boot of his car for a notebook and writing apparatus. Lestrade shouted in victory and snatched out a sketchbook and large permanent marker. He ran to the nearest building (with a camera) and popped the cap off and started writing frantically.
The voice sighed, '
"I'm sorry.
He is
John raised his hands in defense, mind rushing to find an explanation for his current form. However, Harry just frowned and ran back into the room. John visibly relaxed and noticed his previous deductions were correct, because the teenager stared at his door like he just saw a ghost.
Great, he was fully visible, if the police happened to notice him then that meant Trouble. With a capital 'T'. However, John could sense three imaginary spirits in the house somewhere. And miraculously his teleportation skills still worked, because none of the officers were guarding the front door at the moment. Idiots.
The cabbie looked like he was about to drive straight through him.
For a second Sherlock wished he had brought a companion other than Lestrade. He quickly shook the thought out of his head and nodded to the police detective. They were ready.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade. Sherlock..." Sherlock hears Mycroft pause. Sherlock knows that silence, Mycroft saw something he shouldn't have.
John suddenly jumped when his pocket vibrated. He shoved his hand in his pocket finding a phone, he was surprised he hadn't noticed it. The smart phone was a emergency communication device for some spirits.
a child's game," Sherlock remembers and smirks. "We're going to find out."
"What is it?" Sherlock turned around also.
"Come-on, tell us! I, Mike Stamford, solemnly swear-"
Ms Hudson shook her head just as Mycroft saw something move at the corner of his eye.
DI Lestrade had just barged into an empty flat with scorch marks all over the walls and shattered glass everywhere. An obvious sign that an experiment had gone wrong.
This would be the second child who had seen him as a human and what was worse is that this one works for the government. John wanted to disappear. Murray was definitely going to do more than just snicker at his horrible misfortune.
It also wasn't his fault that after being drenched by extremely dangerous (and possibly corrosive and flammable) chemicals, both the consulting detective and doctor were caught in a 'minor' explosion.
"John, what are you saying?" Young Sherlock stood nimrod straight, there had to be telltale signs. Of lying. But John's eyes stayed sorrowful, he wasn't lying.
Sherlock makes some changes.
“Looks like we’re going to be stuck here for a while,” Sherlock said as he stared out morosely into the torrential downpour, “luckily I’ve  brought snacks and your Daddy made sure you were bundled up before our adventure.” Sherlock grinned down at his adopted daughter, his head was just lightly brushing the ceiling of the structure.
Mycroft was doing his best to read the documents as Rosie beat him with her fists. “Down! Play chickie chickie” she screamed over and over again.
Sherlock was sitting at his work bench in 221C Baker Street. The basement flat had been converted into Sherlock’s permanent lab years ago. Originally Sherlock had though his makeshift workspace in 221B’s kitchen had been sufficient enough, safe enough. He promised John it would be. Then the most terrifying thing to happen in Sherlock’s life occurred.  Rosie, Watson, his second conductor of light had pulled herself up the side of the island and come into contact with poison sumac. She was two, and apparently highly allergic. He hadn’t expected it, hadn’t even seen her ghosting her little hands around the edges, only to come in contact with a pile of leaves from his latest crime scene. It was only when Watson started crying, and her cries became wheezy and wet, that he looked over the island to see her sitting on the floor in pain.
G: Let me live, you bastard.
“Chickie chickie!”
“Yes,” Greg groaned, “But I don’t see why we have to be doing the heavy lifting. Doesn’t this count as legwork?”
“Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time” John said as he cleared the island. Sherlock pouted.
“You haven’t even touched your food. What’s going on?” John sat across from Rosie, face full of concern. He hadn’t noticed any odd behaviour from her this week but looking at her now, he could tell something had been eating at her.
It should have gone well but, fifteen minutes in she had needed to change her pad. Rosie walked two doors down, used the bathroom and returned to chaos. She was gone three minutes. The playroom was suddenly covered in her things as the twins had gotten into her overnight bag. The one she retrieved the new pad from, and flung the contents about the room. Well being an awkward, frustrated, and tired teenager that she was, she screamed. This some how convinced the twins that it was play time. It was not. Now Rosie was at the end of her rope, the playroom was a mess, and her Uncle would be home any minute. She was done. She didn’t yell, she didn’t stomp away and lock them in the playroom and wait for her uncle. Instead she sat down on the floor as the twins sang their songs, and she sobbed.
Mummy mourns the changes in her middle child.
M: Rosie is teaching me texting emoticons.
Mycroft smiled, taking mugs and other supplies from their various places. “Now as for why your fathers believe me to be the bad guy,” he paused turning to face her while the milk heated, “Your Papa and I share a long history, one where I often left him out of the loop and took my position as oldest very seriously.” Rosie nodded, listening intently. “I wasn’t,  and still am not, very straightforward or honest in my micromanaging of his life, though I’ve lessened my habits the past few years.”
“Oh” Rosie explained, “Speaking of black and yellow, did you see Mrs. Suresh’s optical illusion painting on the back wall today? It was memorising!”
She doesn’t hold the same hope for Mycroft, he’s too far ensconced in her brother Rudolph’s shadow. He used to be such a caring, if a bit awkward, lad. Now he calls his brother an idiot, slow, and warns him away from basic human emotions. A year ago he would welcome hugs and would wear soft comfortable jumpers. Now though, he’s practically his uncle’s miniature.  He wears suits, though not yet a three piece like her brother. If she were being honest with herself, though she can’t as it’s a thought too much to bear, she had lost all three of her children in that fire. She is torn from her thoughts by the sound of the front door bursting open and Sherlock shouting a proclamation.
A day after his brother's wedding, Mycroft and Rosie have a chat.
“Good afternoon Inspector” Mycroft said with laughing eyes as he turned for the door.
“You care what I think, you were vulnerable to Sherlock’s blatant lies, and said man just attempted to sneak into a pub dressed as a woman. Clearly, there’s interest if your brother is willing to kick up such a fuss, and for you to listen to it.”
Rosie sat her chopsticks down and took a deep breath. “I got in a fight at school. They suspended me.” She kept her eyes on the table, and tried to make herself as small as she could.
“I think Papa gave him puppy eyes. Plus he said you’ve been trying. Daddy just grumbles about that.” She too sipped her cocoa, receiving a cream moustache for her efforts. “But you do care, I mean who would have pushed adoption papers through on short notice, and record amendments that let me have Papa and Daddy’s last name, but only Daddy’s for school? Everyone hates paperwork but you did extra, so I could be happy, that’s love.”
“You are suspended! Why on Earth were we not told or cont-”
“Yes my dear?”
“Oh.” Mycroft desperately wanted to know what they were saying, especially since they wait until their daughter was out of sight. However, he didn’t want to use Rosamund, she trusted him, really trusted him. Mycroft wasn’t going to betray that trust, this little girl was thus far his only family member that seemed to see him as he was, human. Not the best thought but, it was the truth. No matter his intellect, or how vocal he was about the dangers of sentiment, he would always be human.
Sherlock made no reply but could hear Rosie asking to be put down, and then making her way to the living room, obviously looking for him. Rosie, not seeing him, toddled towards his bedroom door which was slightly ajar. Sherlock ignored her and continued to focus on his face, satisfied with his eyebrows he had moved on to his cheeks. Rosie had pushed herself into his room.
Rosie was alarmed, and angry. How could she have been so blind, so complicit on what this girl had really been saying. Well not anymore. “Forget it, you fucking suck.” And she marched out onto the stoop, and was greeted by her Uncle pulling up to the curb.
John blanched, but, Sherlock turned to the bed and picked up a top hot. He turned quickly, leaned down and placed it on Rosie’s head.
“Like Papa” Rosie excitedly interjected.
Sherlock laughed long and loud, happy for his brother and future brother-in-law.
“What do you mean?”
“I’m already a troublemaker...Myc.” Rosie grinned defiantly
“I’m pregnant.”
“12,” Greg asked surprised, “Do tell” he finished, leaning forward, resting his chin in his hands.
She gave Sherlock a look of thanks. “You weren’t contacted because I called uncle Mycroft when I was called to the headmistress’ office. I convinced her secretary to allow it since you were on a case.”
“The wooden puzzle on the outside can be solved by anyone, but the combination for great Aunt Bathilda’s old wall safe comes from the cartesian coordinates of a cylinder, in other words, it requires Maths.”
“I have homework and an essay from Uncle Rudi to complete” Mycroft said, following after his brother.
“The man is observant after all,” Mycroft said in mock surprise. He leaned a bit closer and whispered, “But let’s be clear, your offer is actually our second date.”
“You’re sure,” Mycroft spoke barely loud enough to be heard, “it’s.” He stops, unable to find the right words for once, and looks at his husband. Greg too, wants to ask the question that leaves a bitter and decaying taste in his mouth.
“Rosamund, quit it, or I’ll bite.” Mycroft said sternly, then turned and flashed his teeth at the child. She paused briefly, concerned.
It had been a year since the fire that burned and hollowed out Musgrave Hall. A year since she was forced to concede that something was wrong with her only daughter. A year since the last spark of joy left her middle son’s eyes, and a year since her oldest had stopped eating cakes and started forging his tongue into a cutting blade. So much has changed but, today was the biggest change come to pass. Her children had always been home schooled before, now though, she thought it was best to send them out into the world. Perhaps Sherlock would brighten at the thought of adventures with someone his age again, maybe they can stop feeding into his restructured memory, maybe he can finally grieve.
However, that was unimportant. What mattered now was his current Trust, and Rosie’s care should anything happen to either John or himself. None of that was the issue though, the issue at hand was Rosie’s pure enjoyment of his brother’s presence. Not five minutes ago she had been bashing him upside his head with her tiny fists. Rosie was displeased at not being allowed to play with the exploded chicken, and she saw Mycroft as the one preventing her from doing so. Even though it was Sherlock who handed her over to him to keep her away from the mess.
“He came immediately, though on the car ride to his office he said he’d only not call if I promised to tell you after the case. And that I would be spending the rest of the week in his company studying, at least until the case was over.” She paused and worried her lip. “There’s a girl in my class who is really smart but a bit,” she paused looking for the correct descriptor, “awkward.”
Greg                            "How bad was the shot wound?" I asked as he kept me close and I knew he could feel the adrenaline running through me where I'd been preparing to shoot Seb myself. Thank God Mycroft had had a weapon on him.
Mycroft                     Slowly, I become aware of my surroundings. I take a deep, gasping breath, breathing in the antiseptic-tinged air gratefully. A hand touches my shoulder, and I open my eyes sleepily to see Greg sitting beside me, a worried look on his face.
In this chapter, the Doctor is played by MsLadySmith, and Seb Moran is played by Lonewarg
Mycroft                     I see his hesitation. "You can touch the back of my hand. That does not trigger my ability." I whisper. To make the point, I lightly brush the back of my hand along his jaw, turning his head slightly so I can kiss his lips.
John                            “Get off me!” I rush down the stairs but by the time I reach the second landing, I realize that I can’t go outside. Bringing my fist back, I punch hard into the wall, leaving a big hole there. “Damn it!” I rage whirling back up the stairs. “Sorry, Greg. Sorry.” I say helping him up.
Mycroft                       I laugh weakly. "Yes, a bit not good. He ranted on about how I should have told him first, should have informed the boy's father first... without regard for the value of the information I'd given him."
John                            “You know I always trust you. I never doubt you. I just want you home.” My hands search the space around me.
She is here. Be careful.
Sherlock                   Within seconds I'm trying to roll us over, so I end up on top, kissing and nibbling my way down John's now naked body, worshipping at his scars as I go, "I want to suck you. Now."
Mycroft                     "I... I suppose that would be... agreeable." I fidget with my coffee cup nervously.
Greg                            I wanted to say that I'll sort it but I couldn't, not yet, not with his sister doing this sort of thing. I held him close after phoning NSYs forensic team and rubbed his back soothingly. I could sense their father was somewhere else in the house and didn't want him finding that either.
Mycroft                     "As is yours." I reply softly, my fingers still tracing over the sweatshirt.
Eurus
Greg                             "Then show me what a dominant Mycroft can do." I moaned as I pushed my cock against his, causing a slight brush of friction and I can't think of another time where I'd been turned on this much. I'd always wanted to be more adventurous with sex, yet Caroline was rarely home or just wanted to get off herself.
John                            “No. I’d never allow it. I’ll come find you on my own if I have to.” I bury my face in his shoulder, trying to breath him in.
Greg                            "You’re so bloody gorgeous.. I.." I kept his eye and wanted to say that I loved him, but he cut me off when he started pushing into me with his cock. I moaned loudly, not caring if John was in the house and could hear where I'd nearly lost my life and didn't want to be apart from Mycroft again.
Moriarty
Mycroft                     "And what about our brother?"
Sherlock                     Slouching back on the narrow seat in the cells, my arms are folded, glaring at the door to freedom and kicking my heels up and down. I seem quite resigned now to sit and wait.
Jamie                           "Molly is... Well... Molly." I pull the Zippo out of my pocket to light his cigarette. The loud clunk of the lid closing causes him to jump slightly. "Tell me the truth, Sherlock, are you ok? You seem a bit..." I motion to his shaking hands, dirty jeans, scuffed shoes, and more.
Mycroft                       I nod slowly. "Understood, brother." I help him up out of the chair, handing him the rest of the package of jaffa cakes. I give him a brief pat on the shoulders, and he quietly leaves my office. I pick up the phone and ring my receptionist. "Katherine, I will be leaving early today. Please reschedule my remaining appointments for later in the week." I grab my coat and leave the office, heading toward Greg's flat.
Greg                            "It would be more like throwing rather than assisting." I said softly.  We sped through the footage until the next day where the cameras only caught a wide angle. Mr. Ingraham disappeared from view, my hand asking him to go back to try to close in on Moran.
Mycroft                     I didn't want to let go of Greg, but found I had to in order to return to the control panel. "I have radioed Anthea our location and situation. . I will have her send a medical team, as well.  Mrs. Lipton should return shortly with those that need transport off Sherrinford" I say, nodding at my brother's sleeping form. In a calm, quiet voice, I reassure John, "I suspect he will sleep for a day or so. Expending that much energy at once is overwhelming. But sleep and sugar are simple cures."
Mycroft                     "Yes. Baker Street is constantly monitored." I avoid Sherlock's surprised glare.
Greg                            "Okay... so me not asking about your powers until you actually brought it up? I could have easily said no to you coming around here with food, suggesting we have a personal relationship more than just a professional one? Doesn’t that scream interest?" I asked as I tied my scarf round my neck tightly and I was trying to hold back my glare.
Greg                            I sigh with a brief sadness in my face but just turn back to Rosie who seems to be beaming up at me. "How are you finding London, Rosie? Bit noisy, isn't it?" I smiled.
Dave the Druggist       "Get me help, please. It hurts." I curl in a little, my gun well out of reach and honestly scared. I suddenly feel the urge to confess all I can, "I just work here for Mr... Mr..." for some reason the name of my boss escapes me. I try again, "I'm just a chemist by trade. I fulfill the orders that come in and help test the purity of the products."
Greg                             "I'm guessing Sherlock got the same thing. Asking how he's doing probably." I said between us kissing, my eyes and general demeanour tired where I'd been taking my antibiotics and then trying to do my normal work day.
Greg                            I kick off my own shoes and leave my jacket hanging at the end of the bed, curling up with his head on my chest as I held him. I'd done a lot more research into soulmates and if either of us were injured, depending on how strong the connection was and how bad the injury was, the other could feel it just as much.
Mycroft                     "Yes. At the NSY Christmas party last year. Interesting chap..."
Mycroft                     I look up at Sherlock suddenly. "The simplest solution is often the best."
Sherlock                     After leaving Lestrade to ponder my words I hail a cab, giving the address of my brother's office. I had already checked his flat, swiping some interesting looking chocolates from his fridge as I did, and knew his club wasn't a likely place to go when wishing to avoid people. As the cab pulls up outside his office block I make my way through security, rather huffily as I know they do get annoyed when I bypass it, before ending up in his outer rooms, glaring at his receptionist and demanding to see him
John                            Sherlock sniffs. “Of course. She’s part John. I’m preprogrammed to love... like her.”
Sherlock                   My breath catches, sweeping John behind me to block the line of sight with my own body, drawing myself up, "Oh hello there Jim." My tone is mild, polite, "So good of you to join us."
Mycroft                       I kiss my way down his neck and chest, paying special attention to his nipples, sucking and gently nipping them to hard peaks as he writhes beneath me.
Mycroft                       "Having Sherlock on the inside will make it easier to get Moran, but it may also make Moran less valuable." I sit at the table. "Stop pacing, Greg - sit for a moment."
Mycroft                     I roll my eyes at Sherlock, and glare at John. "You would think, with the trouble we've gone through, he'd be more appreciative..."
Greg                             "Pacing helps me think. And we need to get what's most valuable to Jim and at the moment, that's Sebastian according to Irene and from what we heard from Oliver." I rubbed my face and didn't know all my feelings were swimming around the room for Mycroft as I tried to think about what to do.
Mycroft                     "You will learn to make more sense of what they tell you - it takes time, and practice. You should work with my brother's bees more. If you can make sense of them, other animals may come easier, as well."
Rosie                           "Umm... Homeless network?" I look at both of them hoping someone explains what that is.
Sherlock                   My breath still comes rasping and weak, but my hands flutter at John, awake enough to feel his kisses all over my face but still not conscious enough to do anything about them.
Moriarty                   "Maybe next time. Maybe when you're not so... Hmm... Well, not this." I wave to all of him.
Greg                             "Yeah, yeah, don't give me that crap. You're lucky your brother didn't see the feed of you hanging around a drug den." I growled as I sat up and brushed away some of the dirt on my coat.
Greg                            "Yeah. Just a bit." I smiled politely in front of the young woman and picked up my mug, then looking back at him where he still wasn't putting his gloves back on. It made me question what he was doing.
Greg                             "I don't know. I'm just… feeling things that I've never felt before like. Like I can feel a little of what you're feeling or it's just an aura around you. Sounds really cheesy but it's the best way I can describe it." I ran a hand through my hair and stumbled over my words a little.
Sharon Price          My smile is brighter now as I glance at the waiting ambulance, "I should... get to the hospital, to see to mum. I'm sure they'll take me." With graceful fingers, I slip the glove off one hand, offering it to him, "It was so nice to meet you Greg. I wish it wasn't like this."
Sherlock                   Pulling back, my lips and tongue find his neck, amazed at the hint of sweat I can taste, before nuzzling at the curve of his jaw, teeth nibbling back and forth as my hand starts to pump myself harder, "You're my conductor of light. It's always you, John."
Greg                            I simply rubbed her back as she sobbed into me and I held mine back where I was a more private person with emotions. I knew Mycroft would be noted of this soon with his driver still up the road, stuck there by police and I then heard the paramedics call the time of death on Mrs. Price. It was heart shattering.
Sherlock               I'm standing near the door, my skull clutched in my hands holding it high, a rather small and irate woman brandishing a cloth at me with a threatening look, "He doesn't need a wash and he doesn't need to be put away. Leave us alone"
Greg                             "You need to get up Myc, if we're heading over to Baker Street and then to the Yard…” I called when I stepped into the shower and knew he would have done what I would have done - shut his eyes to get a few more minutes - but we needed to get to the Yard rather quickly.
Mycroft                       I chuckle darkly. "A certain, silver-haired detective inspector," I murmur in his ear, as I slowly press into him. I nip his shoulder as we both moan with pleasure.
Mycroft                       I lean up and kiss him tenderly, reaching up tentatively and brushing my hand lightly over his cheek. I gasp a little at the immediate flood of feelings - mostly sexual in nature, of course - and let my hand drift down to his shoulder. Between my own lust and the emotional feedback I am getting from him, I am painfully hard, and grind up against him wantonly.
Sherlock                   I've spent the rest of yesterday and the night rather restless, wandering around the rooms Moriarty has designated for me. I'm constantly aware of the guards watching me, either openly or through the two-way mirrors or spyholes they don't think I'm aware of. I've tried sleeping again to visit John in my dreams, but my head won't shut down, whirling on how to contact the outside world. Finally, come morning, I'm pacing in the library, a cup of tea sitting cooling on the table, the sound of waves crashing harshly outside
Greg                            "When have you had a woman in your office? Apart from Anthea?" I raise an eyebrow quicker than I could register myself doing it, not even feeling the jealousy in my voice or expression until Mycroft smirked at me to then put his hand over mine. I was just generally curious.
Mycroft                       My eyes snap open at hearing my name. "Greg... how are you feeling?" I rub the sleep from my eyes and stretch
Greg                             "I’m fine, I’m fine… Just a little tired..." I waved it off, now moving to sit on the sofa properly, my heart starting to beat a little quicker now, but I just took a couple deep breaths.
Moriarty                   Pfft "He would know how to in the past, but I've made quite a few additions. You saw one on the way out. There is sooooo much more. Sensors, alarms, big booms, basically if I'm not with you I suggest you do NOT go a-wandering."
Sherlock                     "I told Lestrade about Cameron." My voice is blunt, fingers meeting under my lips
Greg                            "Was there anyone else he worked with? Anyone he spoke with on a phone maybe?" I sat back a smidge to give Oliver breathing space and thankfully we'd put an official police sign on the door, so we weren't going to be disturbed.
Sherlock                     Glancing out the window, I see us nearing the yard, before turning back to Rosie. "Lestrade...Gary...wants me to fetch some evidence from his office. We're concerned a woman named Sally will stop me, or interfere somehow. You'll need to distract her while I work."
Mycroft                 "It appears Dr. Watson will be meeting his daughter sooner, rather than later. Her current living situation, apparently, will not be continued, and since he is her nearest living relative, he will be given custody.”
Mycroft                       I finish getting dressed - opting to just tuck my tie in my pocket for now, since I'm heading home for a change of clothing anyway - and open the bedroom door. "Greg... where are my gloves?"
Mycroft                       "Possible." I leaned on my umbrella, deep in thought. "And there are apparently to be repercussions, as I read the enclosed note before you did... as though he knew I would."
Greg                             I take a deep breath and sip my tea, "I know that but it's not the point. He knew we were working together and he just went behind my back when I've been trying to deal with all these families who have lost someone. Missing persons records, up to my eyeballs with 18-hour days." I explained.
A red and a blue, one lies and one’s true, they're in the drawer next to you, here's a little clue, one pill to not weep, one pill to sleep, one pill will heal you, two pills will kill you.
Greg                             I glare down at the mugs in front of us, having some inkling that having the power he did was hard enough without everything else. I continue to listen as Sherlock goes on.
Mycroft                     I nod to John, who I know also heard Greg's report. "Where are you, Greg?"  I had a sneaking suspicion I knew where he was heading, and that he was no longer on the boat, as he was meant to be.
Mycroft                 I stare out the window as we arrive at the clinic, just a few minutes behind the ambulance. "Next time, just ask." I say a bit coldly. "Now, to check in on my brother and his doctor." I climb out of the car as the driver opens it, walking quickly inside. I walk into the room where Dr. Watson lay, Sherlock already lecturing and annoying the nursing staff on his doctor's behalf. "Sherlock, let them work, brother..." I say calmly.
Mycroft                       "I would do what had to be done to protect you, and John, and Greg." I said quietly. "I don't matter."
Dave the Druggist       Inside is a large and modern looking warehouse, surgically clean and tidy. Shelves line the way containing boxes that are labelled with long, complex names, each one packed with packages of pills, powders and liquids
Sherlock                   My head feels like lead as I lift it up slowly, wincing and gasping. My body feels stiff and I realise I haven't moved for quite some hours. Sitting up, my hand goes to my forehead, grunting, before I start taking in details of the room. It's dark and the air tastes fresh. Not London. I've been moved while I slept it seems. My gaze falls on the walls and furniture and my heart sinks, chest growing tight and cold. I know where I am.
Mycroft                       I roll onto my side facing Greg as he lay beside me. I kissed his neck softly, my tongue tickling along the soft flesh. I ran my hand lightly down his chest and abdomen, stopping just below his navel.
Mycroft                       I pull away, breathless. "While a cold shower might be appropriate right now, I doubt either of us wants one." I say with a light chuckle, reaching behind me to turn off the water. Rising to stand, I gently pull him up with me and grab a couple of towels, handing him one as I begin to peel off my own wet clothes.
Greg                             My hips were moving in time with his thrusts and then his hand on my cock, his gravelly voice in my ear telling me to cum being the catalyst for my orgasm that resulted in my pillows being covered as well as his hand. I had shouted out and vaguely heard my neighbors banging on the wall when Mycroft came.
Seb                        "You hold the whiskey and glasses then." I hand them to him and loved the laugh he gave me when I picked him up bridal style. I carried him to his bed, setting him on it gently and as we drank, I explained how Mary found the body and I even shot John who didn't put up much of a fight.
Rosie                          I get off the bony guy that I've only succeeded in knocking over. Grabbing my backpack, I make a run for the door.
John                            Sherlock and I both let out a snort at the same time.
Rosie                          I'm not an idiot. "Rubber is bad for honey but I did leave it alone. Next time use silicone unless you WANT it to degrade." I turn back to the blonde. "I wasn't hurt or lost. It's fine now."
Greg                            I handed him the file with everything in, my eyes flicking across the screen as I punched in the numbers and found the car was under somebody's name, taxed and insured and I found a random bit of paper to see what his background was like. All while Mycroft was stood there looking at the photo
Sherlock                   I keep my voice blank, cold, not reacting to the kiss but not pulling away either, "There's nothing left for me in the world. My doctor soldier is gone, my brother and DI betrayed me."
Greg                             "Sorry. Ruined your jumper." I nuzzled my face into his neck under the hot water and I couldn't even speak about the dream so part of me wanted him to read me. Just to understand to support me. To keep telling me it was a dream. Wasn't real.
You're forgiven. This time.
Greg                            "She technically got pregnant and I believed for a while that it was mine... until the actual father turned up demanding for a DNA test." I sighed between finishing off my take out, just then sitting there with my wine mug.
Greg                            "John… we need to get Myc to hospital, Eurus can be sorted out by medics at the Yard. Take my phone and call Latimer... he's my trusted officer at the yard, do it..." I looked behind me to find John frozen in place glancing between us all. I was keeping my hand on Mycroft's covered skin, wanting him to focus on my voice.
Greg                             His fingers just dancing across my hip is like his fingers are on fire and I pull my fingers out completely to turn to face him. I kissed him hard, stroking him myself until he made a noise that resembled a whine and a growl mixed in together.
Mycroft                 "The male victim - the body in the morgue - is NOT Sebastian Moran. He was a decoy."
John                            “I’m freaking out here Greg. You guys said this would work. That everything would be fine. That this would be quick. Why hasn’t he contacted us?” My words come out on in a stream of panic as I pace in the small room.
Rosie                          "You're a servant?" He looks kinda too... Richish.
Greg                             "Hence the breakfast but I'm glad you slept well." I reached over to touch his arm for a moment, my hands going around my own coffee as I looked down into it. I didn't exactly know how to bring up what happened or what this meant about us.
Sherlock
Sherlock                   My nose crinkles, his snorted laugh making me finally turn to scowl at him, "Of course you're fragile. You died. Twice."
Moran                        "She's at Baker Street." I bark loudly, panting in fear, the heart monitor going crazy behind me.
Greg                            I simply nod as I head out first and get into the passenger’s side, giving no choice to John of where he was sitting. I didn't hold back from putting my hand on Mycroft’s hand or thigh and just wanted to get this sorted so we could all go home.
John                            “I do. Sherlock and I had our little bumps in figuring things out also.” I say remembering back to just a few months ago when we started to figure out the physical aspect of our relationship. My being afraid of losing control of my own strength and Sherlock’s own general nervousness causing him to teleport involuntarily. It had actually been more endearing than frustrating. But with breathing exercises on both our parts we had figured it out together.
Greg                            My heart is in my throat as I watch his lips skim down my skin and he traces over old wounds that I'd gotten from stabbings, cuts and then marks from general scrapes and bruises. My good hand rubbed his shoulder, seeing his brain working through something.
Mycroft                       I lick his cock slowly, enjoying the sounds he is making as my tongue swipes over the hot flesh. I rest my hand lightly on his hip with a moan as I take him into my mouth, sucking gently as my power floods me with his emotional state again.
Mycroft                       "I spent most of the time talking to the families of missing metas.  There have been at least a dozen reported to the Meta-Human office in the past two weeks. I don't know they've all been reported to NSY. In each case, the meta has a particularly strong or rare ability, and was last heard from just before leaving to - and I quote - 'meet a friend for dinner.' None of the friends knew the name of this dinner companion, or where they were meeting. The missing meta kept everything secret."
Mycroft                       "Yes, it does expend a great deal of energy... to stay in control...
Greg                            "You've definitely done this before." I chuckled breathlessly as I was thrown over his desk, knocking a few pens and pencils on the floor, my head turning to watch him over my shoulder. The room was cool against my bare skin even though it was only from the waist down.
Greg                            "I'm going to give myself an hour before I'll text him to have a look. Just to determine whether there's a link and how come you're here anyway? Just checking up on Rosie?" I asked, flipping my phone over in my pocket.
Mycroft                       I look at the photographs more closely. "Either these are extremely accurate replicas, or this person - I can only assume that J.M. is Jim Moriarty - has actually laid hands on the Crown Jewels. I will get hold of the Tower's security footage, to be sure." If Moriarty can circumvent security measures at the Tower of London, we definitely have our work cut out for us.
Sherlock                   Reaching for the toast, I cut it in half, offering her one half as I dip my own into the soup, "That sounds very generous indeed. You must owe him a great deal."
Sherlock
Moriarty                   "She loves you. That's why she is so mad at Mycie. He decided he didn't like the way she played so he got rid of her." I attempt to turn his attention to food. "Do you know why I don't fear you, Locky? Why your power doesn't worry me?"
Sherlock                   My arms come around him from behind, my chin resting on his shoulder, "I questioned if Moriarty had additional security covering it, apart from the lasers he mentioned. He said he hadn't got around to it yet, suggesting the defenses should be familiar to Mycroft" As I talk, my lips brush his ear back and forth.
Greg                             I held out my hands for him to join me on the floor, it not going to be the most comfortable but thankfully Mycroft had a soft rug that I didn’t think he would mind possibly ruining. I shuffled back once our clothes had been chucked out of the way and gave him the option of being on top so he could control how much he touched me.
Greg                      "Of course and I'll be at their call at any hour if they need it." I smiled slightly, finding it hard to think Sherlock as a parent but I'm sure he'd get a hang of it eventually.
John                            “Alright then. We’re going to New York.” I smile widely at him before leaning forward to give him a kiss.
Mycroft                       "Your wish is my command," I grin, resting my head lightly on his shoulder, relaxed. It's not long before the slow, even breathing of sleep takes him. I carefully extricate myself from his arms, rolling onto my back. Half-asleep myself, I absentmindedly pull my gloves off, setting them on the bed stand before I fall asleep.
Mycroft                       I let Greg pull me to my feet as he pulls my shirt the rest of the way off. Putting my arms back around his waist, I grab the hem of his t-shirt and quickly pull it off of him, discarding it. Breathless, he pulls me into the bedroom, kissing me roughly as he removes my belt and unbuttons my trousers.
John                            “I thought you were leaving for the crime scene, Gavin.” Sherlock quips entering the kitchen, then he narrows his eyes. “Wait. Somethings... what were you two talking about?”
Sherlock                     Scooting forwards in my own chair, I nod, a wounded little look to my eyes but my voice level and calm. "The man, Moriarty, we believe is trying to recruit metas to his cause. By killing John, he wants to weaken me, torture me. Break me. This is why your father needs to stay hidden, to keep him safe while we work against Moriarty. Do you understand Rose Marie?"
Greg                            "Funny that because we have CCTV of your car at the scene of a robbery and since nobody can back up your alibi, I can only assume it’s you driving... waiting for them to come out and we can link you to one Sebastian Moran." I brought out more CCTV photos out and saw him go even paler.
John                            “Yeah... I was. I don’t know how the hell it works, but...” I turn my head again, showing him the side of my neck.
Sherlock                   I breath in the fresh London air a moment before clearing my throat, "I'm unsure she understood my intentions." I quickly add, "It's fine. I'm used to barriers between myself and others. As long as she stays here. As long as she's safe. I shall do whatever I have too."
In this chapter, Mary is voiced by Lonewarg
Mycroft                     "I doubt he would go to Musgrave, but I would like to check on my parents..." I say, hopeful that he would agree.
Rosie                          "Mine??" No way. The gotta be kidding. "Like -mine- mine?"
Mycroft                       "It was necessary, Greg. People speak around infants as though they do not understand, but they do remember." I look at him as he glared at me. "Penny was meeting Sebastian Moran last night. They were planning to meet somewhere on James Street... she never said the name."
Sherlock                   My teeth grit at his mocking little tone, before I turn to the door, forcing a rather tired smile to my lips, "I would say I missed you but, as always, you slipped my mind as soon as you left."
Mycroft                       "Finding a way to draw either of them out might be a challenge. We don't know where they are, and we don't have a clear picture of what Jim looks like." I frown.
Greg                            I had to smirk but just looked out the window, thinking he had a pretty cool power. "That’s right." I said lightly and looked back at him when he kept going.
Greg                             "Crazy but cute isn't really a description. Has he had an opinion of wanting powerful metas to be in the limelight again? Does Sebastian do all the killing, get his hands dirty?" I ask more angrily where she was then looking over Mycroft and rarely felt jealousy until now. I ignored her question of who we were to glare at her.
Greg                            "No...no, no, we can do that later or tomorrow at least. You need to rest with what you did with Eurus." I push him back down with a stern look, knowing we could make her wait as I was sure she was pretty out of it as much as her brother was.
Mycroft                     "A clear threat against those connected to Lestrade has been made. We need to guard against anyone recognizing your connection to him. Or my connection to him.  We need to be seen as operating independently of him."
Mycroft                     I swallow hard. "Where are they taking him?"
Sherlock                   "What flavour of drugs will you feed me?" My voice is listless, weary. I don't even need to act that much, not after my dream. My wrist still tingled where dream John grasped me.
Mycroft                     Once the waves of pleasure eased, and I melt into a contented, relaxed state. "Mmmm..." I sigh happily. "That was very good..." I start to reach for him, but he moves up alongside me before my hand reaches his shoulder, laying his head on my chest quietly. I put my hand back on the pillow without touching him.
Mycroft                       I walk back into the kitchen and fill a reasonably clean glass with cold water, and return to the living room with it.
Greg                             "Yeah but Sherlock said he had to sort something out with John, since he's apparently dead and then what they can do with Rosie… maybe use her as the distraction for Sally and Anderson... Plus I have officers out in the signal area we got from the latest missing person's phone call." I explained and sat back in the chair to put my feet on the desk. I knew it wouldn’t mind.
Greg                            "Someone with a large amount of patience?" I snorted as I stood beside him, it being just us in the office where it was late, and everyone had escaped around 6. I watched him take a large swallow and sipped at my cup myself.
Sherlock               "Clothes. I need clothes." My gaze sweeps around the room with a frown.
Greg                            "I’m not trying to kill you and I won’t kill you. I just need you to talk to me, and I will get you help, don’t worry..." I knelt in front of him and used my jacket as something to press against the wound to stem the bleeding a little. I would be definitely calling this in to the Yard along with an ambulance.
Sherlock                   My phone is slammed back into my pocket, huffing, "It seems to have your genetic code for sass John."
Sherlock                     My heels kick against the bare metal of the uncomfortable chair, my gaze sweeping around the interrogation room. Sally has left me there with a few kindly words and a large cup of coffee. The good stuff. From the coffee maker in Lestrade's office and not the terrible machine in the foyer. She didn't tell me, but I know that means my brother is on his way.
I shake my head with a wry smile, pushing those memories aside and delving deeper.
Seb                              "I found a tree that's about to be cut down and put him inside to suffocate and to be eaten by insects without leaving a trace. Is that a good enough death, Jimmy?" I grinned up at him and just speaking to Greg was what drove me to kill Olly and not just because Jim told me to.
Greg                             "Not until tomorrow morning now." I said softly and worried that us being connected or soul mates or whatever was making his head hurt where I was worrying so much. It being my police head mainly.
Seb                        We'd been given a case that led us to Tel Aviv, it thankfully going smoothly while Mary and I were scouting the building while John was keeping an eye on the boundary. We'd been given the intelligence that the building was clear but we still had our hands near our weapons anyway.
Sherlock                     My eyes narrow, glancing around. There's still some who have their attention on me, blocking my way out. With a small smirk my eyes shift upwards, before blinking out of sight, reappearing above their heads, clinging to a balcony of the flats and swinging my legs over it.
Mycroft                       "I suppose I can try. Once he's fit again, we will talk. If he wants to.”
Eurus                         The knife drops away, still clutched tight but at my side, snarling at Mycroft now, "I don't need anything from you. I was always the most powerful one among us. You were scared of me, so you hid me away." My tone drops again, becoming sweet and sunny, smiling once more, "Jimmy lets me be free. He isn't scared of me."
“I’m worried too. Let’s just go home.” I look up at him as we exit the terminal.
John                             “Perfect?”
Sherlock                     My eyes narrow at her back, before I turn in a swirl of coats, striding off towards the entrance, hoping Rosie hasn't wandered off once more.
Moriarty               I lay myself on top of him and tell him to tell me again how they did. "Did he cry? I bet he cried. They’re all so weak and afraid. But not you, Sebby," I kiss his collarbone, "You're not weak or afraid." It never hurts to enforce a previously planted suggestion.
Sherlock                     Leaping over a barrier, I land on a ramp, tearing off but not taking the main, public way in which I may lose Lestrade. Instead I dart through a shop, tearing through the 'staff only' door and through a storeroom, throwing open the fire exit and into an alley
Mycroft                     "A small headache... sure it is," I grin at him. I finished bandaging him up, take off the gloves and throw the refuse into the bin by my desk. "Stay there. I will see if I can find some dry clothes for you." I leave him shivering in front of the fire and head to the spare bedroom, where I have an assortment of clothing that just might suffice.
Mycroft                       Chuckling, I nod. "Probably true." I rub his back lightly. "I have the opportunity to do some research earlier today.”
Greg                             "Ah... Well, what if I tell them that I don't remember?" I rubbed my face and still felt it was a bit cold, my heart rate now back to a normal pace and I felt less like I'd taken acid.
Moriarty               I hum an old lullaby as I come back in. Seb is exactly as I instructed. "I got you a gift, pretty pet." I hold up a supple leather collar for him to see. "I'm so proud of you, I've decided to keep you and make you my own. Isn't that nice of me?" After attaching the collar, I take a picture with an old Polaroid I keep on the dresser.
Greg                             "A trap is risky, Sherlock. You might have identified the pattern with Moriarty but it’s about Seb is well... a huge group of powerful metas.  We need to calculate this properly." I said as he kept pacing around the living room and I wiped my face tiredly. I felt like I needed a kip, John wandering over in front of me.
John                            “But you can’t. I don’t want you to get hurt.” I’m moving around, trying to move towards the rumble of his voice.
Sherlock                     My head drops, then I let myself slide down the inside of the door, resting my head back onto the cool metal, before finding my voice, "You can do far better than Anderson, Sally." I try not to shiver at her description of his attributes.
Sherlock                   I'm frozen in shock, near to Moriarty but unable to do anything, my eyes wide and face pale
John                             By this time I had Greg’s shirt partly open. “Um I don’t know. He come around a bit... but I think we might have to get him to A&E. He’ll need antibiotics.”
Mycroft                     "Agreed. But unfortunately, they have some power in this decision, as they have had custody for some time. No need to worry - I will resolve it soon enough." I didn't share with him that her cousins were demanding payment for their cooperation.
Moriarty               Mmm, it felt nice what Seb was doing. It was both weird and somewhat exciting to give up control. He was my gentle giant, taking his time to touch me. He has a seb-stantially large penis, so I know it's going to take a while to prepare me. "Suck my dick, baby. Show me how much you want me." I could only take not being in charge so long it seems. That's ok. The Sebs of this world need me to tell them what to do.
John                      “No, of course not. I want you to be involved... if you want to be.” I put my hand on his thigh.
Mycroft                     "Interesting. They appear to be adept at staying below the radar. We may need to do some more intensive research."
Jim Moriarty          I kiss Seb hard and deeply but stop the kiss before he gets too excited. "Then off to the mall with us." Seb stands up with me still holding on to him and walks us to the waiting helicopter. "We have people to kill and bears to build." My laughter is heard even above the whirl of the copter blades.
Finally John leaned back.
"Love you." The end of his words trailed into a moan of pain, but John felt satisfied. He had said what he needed to say. Now he could finally join Sherlock.
He carefully set his phone down, not looking at the text yet. 'Figure things out.' Like she (apparently not Rachel or Rebecca) even knew what she was talking about. John tapped his fingers gently on the table. Maybe he should go out with his mates, he always got better pulls when he was out with his friends anyways. He picked up his phone, pulling up his messages to send out a few texts to Lestrade and a few others, but he paused as he saw Sherlock's unread message. He sighed, but clicked into it.
"It's not sentiment. Because to you sentiment was illogical and idiotic and dull, and this, what I feel, it's the farthest thing from that!"
He quickly texted Sherlock, but there was no response. He looked back at the building Sherlock was in, but his view was blocked by another bush.
"He's unavailable right now, what do you want?" He couldn't afford to be distracted like this, he had to find a way to fix this situation (a dull sense in the back of his mind reminded him that he was late on reintroducing himself to the others, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson and whatnot, but John was more important)
"Just an experiment, you see, I haven't had the motivation in the past to-"
"Mrs. Hudson's bound to be home soon. If she hears me talking to you again... I need to stop allowing this, but you make it so hard..."
"Tea?" John smiled gently at the detective.
"Yeah, he's a consultant for the police, he's brilliant." John grinned easily for the first time that night. Rebecca's face soured more.
"I, I only did it to protect you, I had to get rid of Moriarty's web, you have to understand, I needed... I... I can leave if you want. If you don't want to see me again, I understand." Sherlock started to turn away, to go to his room and pack, but was stopped by a shuddering exhale from John.
He knew that Lestrade still talked to John every so often, that he had even called John in for a couple of cases. He knew that John went out every Friday with Lestrade and Mike Stamford. He knew that John had tea every Tuesday and Thursday with Mrs. Hudson, but that since she had gone on vacation, John should be alone, resting in the flat above.
I'll be home in 30 minutes -JW
This morning so far, he had been approached by Sherlock and intensely stared at no less than three times, but he would not break. He had his breakfast while Sherlock paced and yelled at thin air, threw things (mostly pillows thank goodness), and generally had a tantrum.
What was your subject of conversation when each reading was taken?
He slowly tipped the bottle so the capsule rolled into his palm. It felt slightly sticky, even while dry, but the familiar feel of a pill in his hands was nothing new. The use of the pill was new maybe, but he was a doctor.
Why do you insist on turning off your phone, what if I were hurt? -SH
Sherlock was laying out on the couch when John walked in, but sprang up immediately, stalking toward him in a way that had John raising a hand to stop him before he even took a second step into the flat.
Why was John ignoring him? Why was he so
Glancing back, he saw Mrs. Hudson watching him nervously from the safety of the cab they took to get there. He shifted till he was more comfortable on the hard ground, and nodded at her. As he watched her nod back and get into the cab, he reached into his pocket with the hand hidden from her surely piercing stare. The cab pulled away as he touched cool plastic.
"John's not coming in today, he's a bit predisposed. Don't call again. Goodbye!" Sherlock wanted to yell, he wanted to grab his Stradivarius and deafen himself to the world for a few hours so he could
"John." Lestrade called back towards the stairs, making Sherlock jerk his head back towards the doorway and take another half a step forward as he realized John was alone out in the stairwell. He stilled his movement as he realized Lestrade was still holding the gun with laser focus on him.
Sherlock was shaken from his thoughts as John closed his book and gathered his cup, getting ready to stand. Sherlock again sprung up, ready to follow him. John just wandered into the kitchen, rinsing his cup, then passed Sherlock in the doorway as he went to go upstairs.
"Sherlock, what are you going to do with it."
"So what's the point of this experiment?" He asked as Sherlock began fiddling with the stethoscope, placing the buds in his ears and grimacing as he tapped the bell too hard. Sherlock took a deep breath and opened his mouth with an imperious expression. John hurriedly interrupted.
"Well, within reason I guess, but it might be important." He had tried to explain it to others before, he didn't understand what was so confusing about his willingness to go through with Sherlock's idiosyncrasies. If there was a chance it could help Sherlock save lives, it was important. His phone buzzed.
Finally, in the last one to his left, he found him. Sherlock was sitting against the wall, legs drawn up to his chest and staring blankly at the other wall. John ran to him, sliding to his knees beside the genius. Sherlock shifted his gaze slowly, as if in a trance, but his gaze sharpened as he registered John's presence.
