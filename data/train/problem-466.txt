Sherlock stood on top of the roof and looked down; the people and the cars were so small, so insignificant. He remembered jumping; he remembered John screaming his name, John begging to let him through
Grimacing, Sherlock turned and started walking into a different direction. He didn’t care where he’d land.
That was decided then. He knew Mycroft would have a car waiting for him again, but he didn’t even want to think about the possibility of getting in the car again; he tried to be as independent as possible, and relying on Mycroft for a ride didn’t really support his position.
Sherlock felt something rise in his chest, something he had thought he would never feel again. It crippled him and made him unaware of the police sirens and the Samaritans, and how they pushed him aside in order to heave John on a stretcher; unaware of Lestrade trying to talk to him; unaware even of John being pushed into the car, out of his sight,
He wanted to snap at the teacher, but thought better of it. Mother wouldn’t like it and make Mycroft give a speech about manners and all sorts of useless social norms.
Sherlock managed to focus his eyes on the face in front of him. If he hadn’t known better, he’d said Mycroft looked worried.
John tried to calm down. “I just … can’t believe you don’t know any of these people. Where have you been?”
The school was still abandoned, of course. The dirty brick walls emitted bleakness and something else that Sherlock couldn’t really put his finger on. There was still an hour and a half to go before classes would start. Sherlock was probably the first one here, but he didn’t mind.
Sighing, he searched for the nearest entrance. He didn’t want to leave through the front door; the secretary was going to arrive soon, and he didn’t want to be caught slipping in or out. So he followed John in the direction he had gone to; there needed to be the second door somewhere.
John Watson flickered his eyes to him and nodded. His tongue darted out to wet his lips, just briefly. Interesting, thought Sherlock Holmes.
“Now that you apparently lack the enthusiasm for telling us something about you, we’re just going to get started. You have chosen a rather unusual time to join us, but we welcome you nonetheless. Just go ahead and choose where you want to sit; you will grasp the most important things throughout the day.”
He could have blamed it on simply being the new one in school, but Sherlock knew exactly why nobody really wanted to talk to him, why he sat at his desk alone during the few breaks they got throughout the day. He was perfectly aware of his physical appearance and other people’s reactions to it and how he just
The last thing he heard was an incredulous snort, but he thought Sherlock might have been smiling too. He decided that was the case, anyway.
No, it must be something harmless. And he really shouldn’t be scared of walking up there and going to his locker; it was only a boy, why was he suddenly so worried about another human being? He didn’t even have to talk to him, he could just go to his locker, shove his books inside, and leave the building. He would stroll around until it was time for classes; in fact, now that he thought about it, he might as well skip classes and walk around the town all day. An idea began to form in his head, but he denied himself developing his thoughts. Of course Mycroft would know if he skipped; of course Mycroft would know where he’d go. No, this was out of question. He had to stay in school.
“I am sorry, John. I couldn’t save you. I tried, I really did. I am so sorry. For everything you have suffered through because of me.”
Sherlock looked incredulous. But before he could protest, John grinned at him with a sparkle in his eyes. “Come on, it’ll be fun. I haven’t played ‘Who am I?’ in years.”
He jumped. He hadn’t been paying attention and barely knew what the topic was, only that it was boring and nothing new to him. Desperate for an answer he looked at the blackboard where a simple equation was written down.
Sherlock ignored him and pretended to be busy with scowling at some bad paintings on the wall opposite to him.
The woman behind the counter shook her head. “I am sorry. This was the last flight tonight. We’ve put you on the first one tomorrow.”
The class laughed uncomfortably. Sherlock blinked a few times and realized he had been staring at this boy with golden hair for far too long. The boy flashed an uncertain smile and looked away.
The only thing that kept him here were the drugs and he knew what John would think about this. “I’m so sorry, John”, he whispered for the countless time. He needed to escape his thoughts, but whenever he took the syringe in his hand, guilt rushed over him like a disease; it became stronger each time he did drugs.
John laughed at that. Sherlock shot him an angry glance, so he put up his hands in a defensive manner. “I’m sorry, I just didn’t expect that.” He got up and walked over to the mini fridge and asked, “Drink?”
It didn’t give him much. Cleaned less often than most would prefer, it was nothing but a quick stopping point for passers-by. Too many people came through here to leave any individual traces worth noting. It was almost calming, in a way. He looked back at John.
Before Mycroft could reply, he got out of his chair, ignoring the cup of coffee his mother had just put on the table. Without another glance at his family, he left the kitchen, not interested in the banter with Mycroft anymore.
“How was your first day at school, dear?” Sherlock’s mother asked good-naturedly. Sherlock just scowled at her, which led Mycroft to sigh; Sherlock had stopped counting how many sighs he’d heard out of this mouth this evening.
John’s scowl stayed put for a second, but at the ridiculous sight of this man in front of him and the entirety of the situation, he couldn’t help but return the grin. What the hell. This couldn’t get any weirder anyway. He set his briefcase down and closed the door.
It took him a moment to recover from the surprise, and when he did, he wanted to disappear. Twenty curious faces were staring at him, the new boy in class. He turned back to the door and stared at the woman in horror, but all she did was wink and close the door.
All Sherlock could see was John, John, John, John alright, John in Baker Street, John chasing after him, but not here, not slowly going to the ground in slow-motion and grimacing in pain and disbelief.
“Good morning, brother mine. I was just expressing my surprise to see you down here at this time of the day.” He gave Sherlock a false smile.
They were also quite drunk, however. Sherlock barely drank, and John wasn’t used to it either for sororal reasons. They both knew they should go to bed, but neither of them wanted this evening to end. Suddenly John sat up.
Had there ever been a more obvious nudge from the fates? In any case, John was grateful. Smiling, he picked up the phone, ready to continue what they had started back in that hotel room. He couldn’t wait.
“No,” said Sherlock sharply. “I think we’ll take the room, though,” he added, after a quick glance at John, who nodded. A little frown had started to emerge between his brows again, though.
It didn’t take him long to find what he was looking for. He rifled through the huge stack of documents until he found something that looked important enough. He skimmed the document, barely interested – when something caught his attention. Frowning, he started to read from the top of the page. When he was done, he stormed out of the room, not caring to unlock it or to cover up his tracks.
“I am very sorry, there seems to have been a mistake. One second please,” she said, and picked up the phone. While she was whispering into the line, John Watson looked at Sherlock. “A fellow Englishman, then? What brought you here?”
Surprised, Sherlock blinked. Since when did he care about other people’s opinion? While he was still trying to figure out what was going on, John laughed. He didn’t seem to be upset at Sherlock’s words; instead, he nodded in agreement while his eyes sparkled the same way they did yesterday.
I admit, I didn't proof-read this chapter another time (I'm too drunk). I still hope the chapters are enjoyable!
He was babbling around and only when Sherlock stared at him, obviously annoyed, he stopped. He blushed and said, “Uh, sorry … I’m John, by the way.” He didn’t know what to do, so he simply held out his hand, looking uncertain. Something about Sherlock made him feel stupid, but the new boy seemed also quite interesting.
Sherlock made a sour face at the teacher’s last words. He really didn’t need to hear all this. He didn’t need friends. He didn’t need any morons who couldn’t follow a single word he said, let alone be close to them. But that wasn’t the answer which was expected from him.
John Watson put his shoes neatly next to the bed and looked up. “Yeah. I don’t have time for people who won’t tell me who they are immediately. What about you, then?”
He stumbled out of bed and searched for his shoes, pointedly avoiding Mycroft’s gaze. Suddenly he couldn’t bear it anymore; even less than usually.
He took out a cigarette and lit it. It was glinting in the dark, like a beautiful creature. Sherlock watched the smoke vanishing into the night and he found himself wishing he could do the same. He wanted to disappear,
When Sherlock arrived at the door and looked down the corridor, he noticed that the boy was already gone. Scowling, he turned and went the row of lockers up and down until he found number 21. He quickly shoved his books inside and walked down the stairs and through the front door into the sunlight of a late autumn afternoon. He decided to ignore the unbearable feeling of disappointment that rose in him. He could think about what it meant later – or even better, not even think about it at all and simply ignore it.
He couldn’t look in John’s glazed eyes; instead, he focused on the wound, ignoring how visibly John was struggling to breath.
“Jesus, you scared me! I didn’t hear you coming up – what are you doing here anyway? Isn’t the front door still locked? Or are you joining the team? Mind you, we could use some new players, even though I wouldn’t have taken you for a big football fan.”
John laughed again at that, but Sherlock found that the cared surprisingly little. He didn’t feel like he was the butt of the joke and he … liked the way this man laughed. It wasn’t malicious, and it seemed to light up the entire room.
The man named John Watson stared at her. He was starting to open his mouth to protest, but Sherlock quickly interceded. “I don’t think a hotel outside of the airport will suit either of us. It is late, and the flight tomorrow morning leaves early. Mr. Watson here has been working at a tiring conference all weekend. I myself could need some rest as well. I suggest we take the room; we will easily be able to keep separate.” The last bit was aimed at the man next to him, who looked at Sherlock with wonder. “How–? I don’t–”
He had tried to argue with his mother, gone on a hunger strike, started to smoke inside, and built up his experiments in the most inconvenient places he could think of, but nothing had changed his mother’s mind. Sherlock could practically smell Mycroft’s influence – he hated his brother even more now; he hadn’t thought this was possible.
Now, he went up to the front door of the building and examined the lock. Almost laughing out loud, he got out a paper clip. Not even ten seconds later, the lock clicked and Sherlock opened the door. The lock was a joke. He would have to tell someone. But then again, maybe it wasn’t the wisest move to admit he had broken into the school building on his second day here.
However, when Sherlock lay on the couch, still dressed, and John had crawled into bed, suddenly knackered, and the lights were turned off, nobody fell asleep. Two pairs of eyes stared into the darkness, pondering over what tonight meant to them. They both knew they wanted to stay in contact after this night, but how did one go about that? How did someone tell a complete stranger that somehow, he had touched the other person so deeply in their soul that not seeing him again suddenly seemed impossible?
and he had a faint smile on his lips and his eyes were so big and seemed to sparkle with amusement and –
Sherlock knew his mother felt guilty for sending him to a public school. But it wasn’t so much the “public” that bothered him. Money didn’t save people from being idiots, unfortunately. The thing that bothered him was that his family suddenly started to decide over his life. Sherlock wasn’t used to this. He didn’t
But John seemed to buy it and didn’t ask further. Instead, he looked at his watch and frowned. “Shit, I’m late for practice. I need to go – Sherlock, right? It was nice meeting you; I guess I’ll see you later in class later! I’ve got to go now. Bye!”
He remembered how the secretary had given him his locker number this morning, just before the woman now walking next to him had ‘taken care of him’. He had got number 21, and while they were walking down the corridor, he tried to make out the numbers on the lockers, but he couldn’t quite manage it.
Sighing, he detected the posh car standing in front of the school building. He had been right – of course he had. His family didn’t seem to be able to withstand a chance to show off their wealth to save their life. Well. While Sherlock couldn’t change their behaviour, he might as well make good use of it.
He wanted to go up to him and talk, but Lestrade seemed to have something else in mind. He came up to Sherlock and sat down on his desk. Sherlock made an effort to not roll his eyes. Really, adults always thought he felt better when they minimized their height as if they’d seem less intimidating when in reality Sherlock was superior to most of them, only they didn’t realise, or rather, didn’t
“I’m not! Of course I’m not! Why would I be afraid of a public gathering of morons that calls itself school? The only thing that would happen is my death caused by boredom. Unless, of course, this is what you have been aiming for…”  Something sparkled in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock couldn’t keep from huffing in annoyance. But he knew every word he said was going to go to Mother, so he forced some sentences to form in his mouth. “It was my first day here and I am not used to others being around me. It is all new to me.”
Sherlock rose to his feet. “So you’re going to put me into some kind of boring public school where I’m supposed to make friends and act like I’m just as dull as everyone else? You can’t make me, Mycroft! I don’t need other people to tell me what I already know. I don’t need to see how boring everybody is. I don’t need to socialise in order to understand that I can’t. I don’t need
“I just never thought it was important,” Sherlock said. He had some reading to do when he got back home.  He wanted to be able to talk to John about what interested him next time.
Sherlock pretended not to hear this last comment. “Explain,” he demanded, and sat back, arms crossed in front of his chest.
“Hardly something I would be concerned with as this is not included in my duties, as you know very well.”
He imagined himself standing down there, so small, and looking up to see John standing where he was standing now, about to jump – and he couldn’t take it, he couldn’t believe what a fool he had been and what he had done to John and
A couple of hundred metres before the hotel entrance, Sherlock paused for a moment and then, turning partly towards John, said, “You don’t have any luggage either, do you?”
“You need to eat something, Sherlock, you need to stay healthy. At least have some toast and coffee.”
“Yes. Please, take the bed. I’m quite comfortable here now.” To accentuate his words, he jumped up and down a little where he was sat, not minding how ridiculous he probably looked.
When he had sat down again, Sherlock took a sip from his bottle and shook his head. “Let’s hope this day never comes. I have come to have some sort of reputation amongst police officers for solving difficult cases. The American police contacted their colleagues from London to ask a favour, and life has been terribly boring recently, so I went.”
His thoughts still on the lockers, the woman caught Sherlock completely by surprise and opened the last door on this floor and shoved him into the classroom.
Sherlock lay down on the sofa, still wearing his shoes and his coat. He looked up at the ceiling. Since he was much taller than the sofa allowed for, one of his feet dangled around in the air while he spoke: “You are clearly a doctor with an army past. Since I myself was just in New York City, I have come across several advertisements of the huge surgeon congress in town. It must have been a big one, which increases the probability of an English surgeon attending, especially when that man is flying back to London on the day the congress ends. Let’s call it an educated guess.”
“Yes, the front door was locked until five minutes ago; no, I am not joining the school’s football team; yes, you are right, I am not a fan of this ridiculous sport. What’s the point of a few people running around on a field, trying to get a hold of a ball, just to give it away almost immediately after getting it?”
He would be early for school, but he didn’t care. Sherlock didn’t want to stay at the house, and he almost felt something like anticipation when he thought about the extra time he would get to sneak through the school and examine the place a little bit.
“I don’t mean to overstep, but I do believe they said that this is the only room available tonight.”
He strolled into the room, looking more casual than he felt, and put down his suitcase next to the sofa. Then he turned around and opened his arms invitingly. A small smirk played around his lips. “It’s not so bad a room.”
But then it rushed back in, the reminder of what he was now, how he needed John for his well-being, how he had lost everything
“Ah, you must be Sherlock! We’ve been expecting you! Guys, he’s the new one!” The teacher, who was sitting next to the blackboard on an enormous desk, beamed at the rest of the class and got a few murmured ‘hellos’ as response.
Mother had forbidden any experiments for today, so he didn’t know what to do with himself. Christ, if he had known about the possible outcome of his experiment being half of the kitchen demolished he might have done it somewhere else, but that risk was part of experimenting, of
They had another round after the first one, and then ordered another one from the bar downstairs. Sleep seemed forgotten for now, like an unwelcome thought pushed back to make room for more pleasant things.
Eagerly, Sherlock strode forward to the shelves on the wall opposite to the door. Beneath the shelves, there were at least six boxes. Sherlock knew exactly where to look. Sometimes he wondered if Mycroft knew how well Sherlock knew him. Probably. Mycroft wasn’t exactly one of the slow kind, yet so boring.
Sherlock observed the room briefly. There were a few open spots in the classroom; he wasn’t sure where he was supposed to sit. The girl with the stupid bangs? She seemed like the talkative type. So no. The boy with thin hair and glasses? Parents didn’t care a lot about him, sought for attention a lot. No. There was another boy, and
He left everything behind except Baker Street and Mrs Hudson. These two he just couldn’t turn his back on. He ignored Mrs Hudson ninety percent of the time and devastated 221B whenever he was high; but he knew Mrs Hudson appreciated him staying, and although he felt sorry for her he knew they both needed this comfort. He hated and loved Baker Street for the memories of John it provided; and while Sherlock couldn’t decide if he liked or hated it, he couldn’t stay away from it either.
“I was simply expressing my opinion; I wasn’t aware we had added this to the list of things we don’t mention in this household. Excuse me.”
Sherlock looked for the wound from the bullet that had hit John and cursed under his breath when he saw the damage it had already caused. He applied pressure to the wound to keep John from bleeding to death and searched in his coat pocket for his phone at the same time. After he had called an ambulance rather demandingly, he dropped the phone and brought his full attention back to John.
John unlocked the door and pushed it open. As soon as he had taken a couple of steps into the room, he stopped dead in his tracks.
Thank God he still had his bike. He hadn’t used it a lot lately since he had nowhere to go except the woods nearby the house to collect samples of fungi and herbs for his experiments, but Mother had forbidden going there again after he almost got shot by a small group of hunters.
Instead, he forced a smile at the older man and signalled he wanted to leave. Of course Lestrade didn’t buy the hint.
They didn’t think they had laughed that much in years. Sherlock’s lack of knowledge regarding popular culture became evident very quickly, so the game soon turned into John yelling celebrities’ names to see if Sherlock knew them.
Sherlock decided he needed a smoke. His thoughts were decidedly too occupied with John. He didn’t even know him, why did he not stop thinking about him? And why did he seem to not have control over his thoughts suddenly?
The next days went by in a rush. Sherlock didn’t see, didn’t feel, and didn’t think. He felt as if his whole world had stopped moving; in a way, it had. John was gone
When he had sat down, the teacher turned the class’ concentration to the blackboard. Or at least he tried to. But throughout the day, Sherlock couldn’t help but get extremely annoyed at all the badly hidden looks and murmurs in his direction.
“Madonna?” He was laughing so much he had tears in his eyes. Sherlock was obviously trying to concentrate, but when he couldn’t find anything in his memory, he shook his head, frowning.
After adjusting my collar, I notice out the of the corner of my eye Sherlock’s hand is dangling just so almost brushing my  thigh. Odd he never does … oh! Immediately I remove my hand from my pocket and intertwine my fingers with his.
Quite out of character, Sherlock, startled at the resonance in my voice, releases the glass jar from his slender fingers. Neither of us are able to reach for it in time before it hits the ground with a smash. He’s looking at me now. Eyebrows furrowed. Ahh not this time you don’t Sherlock Holmes. I will not let you deduce what is wrong with me right now. You didn't figure it out before we left the flat, you don’t get to know now.
'Right, over blackberry jam.' I close my eyes knowing this won’t be the last apology Sherlock will make.
I can see Sherlock’s smug face wiped right clean off, eyes widening, and finally clicking the pieces together. His shoulders are heavy and leaning forward. A small whisper escapes his lips. ‘A bit not good?’
These small moments of you being unaware of my soft gaze ground me when you're physically departed from the space I normally share with you.
Pivoting on my heel, I snatch the basket and head toward the checkout. 'Looks like we’ll be without any jam for tea this week!' I shout over my shoulder, unable to look back at him standing there all alone to clean up the mess he’s made. Those puppy dog eyes of his would have me back to him in an instant, apologizing for my tone and snogging him thoroughly right there, making a scene at our favorite Tesco. No, no. I press onward towards the machine, scanning each of the items - not the blackberry jam as it was the last jar that smashed to the ground in my fit. I scramble for my trifold, flustered with myself and that damned temper of mine. Seven counts in. Five counts out. Eight counts in. Release. I’m able to pull the card from its place, slide it into the machine, and punch in my pin - 7437. Hurriedly, I grab my receipt along with my items, because damn me if I forget the shopping for the week, and make my way back to Baker Street.
My heart drops as I glance at my chair. A note with a carefully scripted 'My Darling John' on the front has been placed on my seat. If Sherlock has composed an apology, it can only mean he genuinely knows that he’s done something wrong. The man, as logical as he is, can bring me to tears with how beautifully his emotions are transpired onto the page and flow deeply into my soul.
I know he doesn’t really understand me and my unspoken needs, but dammit, sometimes it would be nice to have a Sherlock who doesn’t prioritize experiments with ink over me and my achievements. I rub the chilled tears stuck to my cheeks off, casting them to the side - not unlike my own goals -, and push my unwilling body up and off the bench. Time to finish the trip to a most likely empty flat, make tea for one per the as-of-late norm, and work on the next bit my publisher wants me finish just in case my first published work sells out like we hope. Rain starts to saturate the hem of my trousers, causing my socks to soak and shoes to fill up. I quicken my pace and before the rain has a chance to chill me to the bone, I make it to the flat. Fumbling with the keys with my frozen fingers, I manage to get inside and allow the warmth of the hallway to wash over me. A smell wafting from upstairs is unusually pleasant, and I’m terrified to find out what it could possibly be.
'Excuse me, Sherlock, but do you think you’re the right person to be making tea? I hope this isn’t as good as my cuppa, or else I’ll be out of a job. What’s next?' I push my chest against his, trailing my breath up his neck, and placing my lips just underneath his earlobe. Fervently I trace my tongue in a circular motion that I know will elicit the right kind of sounds demanding liberation from his mouth. Releasing my mouth from his neck, I whisper on to his skin, 'Will you be better at sucking cock than I am? Sherlock Holmes, World’s One and Only Best Cock Sucker.' I can feel his smile widen and a forceful deep-bellied laugh vibrates the space around us.
The sun shines through the window on this brisk morning. I slowly open my tired eyes, squinting into the rays of light greeting the immaculate room I notice myself in. The shadows of the previous evening dissipate, taking with them the memories spent wrapped in one another’s arms. Momentarily blinded, I inquire my surroundings, feeling around for what I need most. My palms skim over the high thread count of the sheets that enveloped our bodies the night before tumbling into the softness of your tangled hair. Tenderly I sweep over top those tousled curls, twirling them attractively about my calloused fingertips. Pausing momentarily, I listen to soft susurrations gently escaping your slightly parted lips, emitting shivers down my spine. These same lips I desire to claim for my own taking. For they are mine and mine alone.
A weekly trip to Tesco leads to a bit of a domestic, and two idiot men making up in the kitchen before tea.
I cannot finish my sentence before my trousers are unbuttoned and round my ankles at record speed. His hands glide down my body, undoing each of the fastenings of my shirt, popping a few of them off in his haste to have me bare chested. He flips me around so my back is flush with the counter behind me. I gasp at the cool touch of the back of his hands descending down to my navel, teasing the waistband of my pants. He gently kneels down, pressing his lips against my protruding hip bone and again on the other side. Pulling at the waistband again, but this time with his teeth, he slides my pants down to accompany my trousers, and places firm kisses along my legs, up one and down the other, completely bypassing my erect cock.
He pulls back, and I confidently lick my lips, knowing that once I give the command he’ll be the one weak in the knees.
‘Oh so you finally decided to come home. How very nice of you. Did you soak yourself to the bone in the rain outside, John?’
You give me that mischievous wink that you’ve spent weeks trying to perfect, secretly, in the mirror when you believe I’m not watching. I like this one you have gifted me. You must have deduced that this is my favorite since you’ve stuck with it for around a week now. You rarely make us a cuppa, and I greedily want to watch your long graceful body clamber out of bed.
My eyes, fully open now, glissade down your body. The sheet is draped lazily along your side, exposing favorites parts of you to me. Alabaster skin you’re apprehensive to present during the day, cloaked away underneath layers of unconscious distrust of the surroundings of the world; however equally ardent to reveal yourself solely to me in the radiant moonbeams of our hidden mainstay. I pull my hands away from your curls, more a mess than when I found them, gently skating your skin. Allowing the softness to slowly wake you from your sleep. Selfish of me, I know, rousing you when you’re peacefully displayed in front of me, but the desire to gaze longingly into your eyes when you’ve turned to face me overpowers your necessity to slumber. My heart races as I’ve predicted. Your sleepy eyes gaze longingly at me as if it were the first time you’ve laid your sights on me; similar to that of our first meeting back in that sterile room at Bart’s. Wrinkled nose accompanied by a tired half smile.
My back arches, fingers lightly pull on Sherlock’s curls as his mouth takes me in. His hand pushes my hips against the countertop, giving him the push he needs to keep me still. While we both know Sherlock craves that demanding nature from me, he lives for the thrill of being the one in charge, putting his well developed skills to fruition. The slight bob of his head hardens me even further. I groan and grip the sides of the counter, knuckles white, and my bottom lip encased between my teeth. The sensation of Sherlock’s mouth wrapped around me sends my toes curling. I can hear my cock slide in and out of his mouth at a faster pace; he’s found his rhythm, and I don’t have much longer. His free hand goes underneath and firmly grabs my arse, releases and begins pulling his fingers along until he reaches my shaft. Combining his hand with his mouth, I can barely think, let alone breathe. Sensing my completion, Sherlock speeds up, twisting his hand along my wet cock, pulling his mouth to the tip.
'Dammit, Sherlock! I can do things by myself you know. It’s not like you’re coming to Tesco like we prearranged when we first got together.' I drop the basket to the floor, throwing my hands up with a temper I’ve not felt in ages. My eyebrows shoot up and my shoulders tense as a shiver runs up my spine. With each word my voice gets louder until I can feel the words vibrating off of the shelves around us. 'I’ve been reaching for this same type of jam for the last two months now all by myself. ‘Oh look at me! I’m Sherlock Holmes. All tall, dark, and handsome. I can grab the ritual spread from the tip top of the shelf without even breaking a sweat.’'
I drop the bags in arms, angrily stride over to Sherlock, and push my finger directly into his chest. My eyes are wide and full of contempt for his pompous face and sharp cheekbones. I ignore the way his lips pout and stare deep into his eyes. No changes in his face have been made, and it looks like we’ll be having that domestic he claims I started while at Tesco.
‘I may not be the best boyfriend, and I know I get caught up in my experiments, forgetting entirely the date and time for important events, but I truly thought tonight was our planned dinner to celebrate your achievements.’ He takes his hands and places them on either side of my cheeks, thumbs generously tracing my jawline, causing my legs to give just a tad at the pads of his fingers on my soft skin. Beholding my eyes, searching for the right moment, Sherlock claims my lips with his. Gentle. Strong. Content. My Sherlock. His tongue begins to beg for entrance, but hastily retreats understanding this tender moment should not be disturbed by the arousals both of us can feel pressing against one another’s thighs.
‘Nothing. Just thinking about how I don’t want to get out of bed to get us a cuppa this morning. I might get them ready and come back to bed since it is a bit chilly out this morning. Thank god the bedroom is close to the kitchen.’
Perfection. It’s as if our hands were designed to interlace as they do every single day. I sigh at this revelation and squeeze his hand a bit tighter than usual. Sherlock looks up from his phone and shines his infamous half smile towards me. I’ve forgotten that I’m perturbed at him. I promptly replace my dreamy stare with that of a contentious huffed scowl. His damn cheek bones. Those looks of his be the death of my temper. Calming the storm that rages inside of me whenever he does something ridiculous, albeit brilliant. My breath hitches and I steal a glance at my love, hoping I haven’t hurt his pride too much.
"Yum, you should try some of the soup, it's really good." He smiled softly, rolling his eyes at the fond behavior of the elder Fae, "She frets too much," he pursed his lips slightly, "We'll all be fine," he gave a soft huff of laughter, "but we can go see her soon, right?" He snuggled close to his mate, nuzzling at his jaw, damp nose sliding against John's skin.
All that mattered to John was keeping the fawn happy, even though it hadn't proved difficult yet. With a hum, he swallowed his mouthful and nodded, sopping up a bit more yolk with his toast.
The younger boy tilts his head slightly, "You could help me with an experiment." He smiles widely, sitting up, "Do you wanna?"
It was almost unbelievable to think such an ordinary man like himself had anything to offer in comparison to such an amazing creature, but the fae was admitting just that.
"When I go into town for supplies next, I'll send a telegram to Harry. I'd like to tell her about us in person though...it's not really something you can explain by post. You're too wonderful to fit on paper." He grinned and kissed at the fae's neck "We're sleeping here tonight, Love?" John asked softly, pulling back just enough to look up at the fawn.
John hummed into the kiss, closing his eyes and drawing circles down Fawnlock's hip and thigh. When the need for oxygen burned in his chest, he finally pulled back, staring down at the fawn with a hazy, half lidded gaze. The soft little noises the fawn made turned John on far more than they should have, but the fact he was making them because of what John himself was doing was enough to make the blond shudder and sigh himself. A deep heat started to grow in his belly, coiling down through every limb, to his toes and fingertips. His love and desire for the fawn was spreading through him like wildfire, and there was no way to put it out besides the pair of them just burning together.
The fawn's lips twitched up into a smile, happily following John, who was still trying to know the wood better. The traveled a bit longer till the creek crossed their path. The Fae kneeled by the water's edge, pulling John down with him. Fawnlock cupped his hands into the water, bringing it up to dump on his head and ruffle his wild raven curls with speckled fingers, a way to clean them a bit.  He wiped his hands off in the grass and turned to smile at the human.
When they arrive, Sherlock pretty much leaps from the limo, bag in hand, "Come on, John! You have to call your mum still." He whispers low enough so Mycroft won't hear.
John may not have been magical, but the bond with his mate was strong and he had felt a tug in his heart the moment he'd returned to the woods. Now that he was so close, it had become an overwhelming surge of comfort and relief, and the blond had run out to greet Fawnlock.
John knelt down beside Fawnlock, reaching into the bush and plucked a few berries, setting them into his palm until he'd collected a handful. He looked over the the fawn and laughed, thumbing away a bit of juice from the corner of his lips. He sucked the taste of his thumb, then reached down and took the fawn's hand, pouring the berries he'd collected into the fae's hands before going back to collect his own. The fawn smiled and cupped his hands around the berries, then put another in his mouth. He watched John, ears twitching slightly as he ate another berry.
He was sure Fawnlock would do anything to help John, and not just learning how to speak another language. There was a faint hint of worry there however. He didn't want to take all of Fawnlock's time. The incident with Mousey was fresh in his mind after having it explained to him last night, along with the fawn's admittance of his usual demeanor. John didn't want to be a burden in any way.
He hands it back, "I'm not too hungry, I'll just have some wanton soup." He offers John a smile, "And you?" He asks.
John's eyebrow rose, his fingers stilling in the thick fur at Fawnlock's promise to play dirty. As he felt the mouth on his ear, John shivered, turning his head just slightly to make it easier for the fae to reach his ear.
Mycroft looks down at his little brother and immediately regrets it.  He can never resist Sherlock's puppy dog eyes. Mycroft looks away, shaking his head and smiling.
Fawnlock's ears flicked as John's fingers trailed over his skin, and played with his tail. The fawn gave a soft bleat at John's promise before he recuperated John's kiss, fingers tightening in John's hair as his tongue flicked over the Fae's lips.
There were a couple of bike racks next to the school building. Sherlock remembered them to be completely empty yesterday, due to the rainy weather. He wondered if they were full on other days; he didn’t want to have to look for a new place for his bike. However, he would worry about this on a different day.
and he snapped back and yelled at Lestrade and wanted a cigarette, but he needed to wait, needed to make sure he was with John first, so he jumped into the ambulance and didn’t care about the protests around him, in fact he didn’t think he would ever care about anything ever again in his life, so he let them yell while he stared at John’s lifeless face and prayed for the first time in his life for a miracle, because this just couldn’t be and there needed to be another option and
"Congratulations!" Mycroft spins in a circle, laughing excitedly with Sherlock in his arms. "I'm so proud of you Sherlock!" He presses a kiss to his brother's cheek. "What do you want to do when we get to the Summer Home then? We're leaving tonight instead!"
Fawnlock smiled as John recuperated the nose rub, tail swishing under the warm water. The fawn wriggled slightly in his mate's lap as John's fingers gently rubbed his thighs.
John kissed Fawnlock’s forehead over and over again, murmuring his name softly between kisses. "I've got you Fawnlock...Always." The Fae was soothed by his mate's mumbling of his name, of his soft words making Fawnlock feel safe, and at home, like he'd been waiting for John through all the millennia of his ancient life.
The fawn stopped for a moment at the opening of the clearing before huffing slightly, and following John. A thrill ran through Fawnlock, he was going to see inside of John's den, a real human den, his lips curled as his ears perked with intrigue.  He followed the human to the door and watched as a warm glow was revealed within, he stepped inside, the considerably warmer air causing his to shiver slightly, and followed the human's actions, seeing as his feet were muddy like John's had been. He stepped off the thick piece of cloth, and looked around, eyes taking in everything and their possible uses... Oh the experiments he could do in here, if John would allow it. His tail flicked happily and he looked around, less wary than before, now extremely curious. The human's word finally broke through his daze and he turned to John, "I eat most anything, though I don't really like..." He paused, looking for the right human word, "Hmmm, made with chemicals, I believe." He frowned slightly at the language barrier that'd suddenly popped up.
"You had a head start you cheater!" He ruffles Sherlock's hair, making it messier than usual. Sherlock laughs, poking his tongue out at his older brother.
Fawnlock huffed impatiently, before beginning to hum softly. He stared into the flickering flames of the fire, toes wriggling as he grew more impatient every second he waited. His ears twitched and flicked as he listened to John, estimating his impending arrival, tail swishing.
He snaps the book shut, settling the tome on the edge of the nest, stretching out his back as he did. The fawn turned to face John, tail swishing, but a frown turned down the corners of his lips.
"Yes, I do that as fun." He chuckles softly, he slings his pack off his bag and digs through it, "And ahh, well, remember how I wouldn't show you what I had?" He pulls out his plush bee, he sighs softly before looking to John, "This is Bilbo.." He was a tad worried that John would think him a baby for having a plushie.
Sherlock's pulling them makes him smile, he clutches Sherlock's hand in return as they run, Mycroft keeping up easy enough but only because of his long legs.
The younger Fae huffed softly at his brother before he put his face into a calm expression and straightened his stature.
Sherlock pouts slightly as his brother ruffles his curls before he sidles up beside John, staring up at the night sky with wide eyes.
"Great, we're having seafood chowder for lunch. I hope you like it, our butler Winston makes it home made."
"Humans are even stupider agreed when they are scared." John sighed, hopping over a creek that he recognized. They were close to the cottage, and he picked up the pace. However, at the same thought, he stumbled and slowed, realizing that it meant Fawnlock would be done with his task, and leave. John frowned and looked back at the other, chewing on his lip. "Umm...can I make you dinner or something? To thank you for taking me home?" He looked up at the fawn hopefully.
Sherlock looks to his friend, lips pursed. Then he calmly closes his book and settles it on the table, "Anderson, did you know your mum's having an affair? Yes, with the librarian, Mr. Burns, judging by the smell of his cologne on her whenever she picks you up." He flashes the bully a smug smile before going back to his book.
The young Fae stayed tucked close to his mate as they padded to the edge of the clearing, he only broke from John's hold to kneel and lift a hand, ears twitching as he checked the protection spell around the cottage, fixing any kinks he flaws in its barrier. Fawnlock stood once more, going back to John's side and tucked up against him, the rumbling begging in his chest as they began to move once more. After the fawn had finished, his speckled fingers tangled in the fridge of his scarf, tail swishing side to side as the mates padded down the path to his old den.
I take a step back, realizing that I have Sherlock backed up against the counter, a slight embarrassed pink color creeping up his neck and onto his cheeks. I chasten myself. Of course he does, and for Sherlock, this is a big deal. Surveying the room around me, I can see that everything is in place just the way I like it. My newspaper folded next to the plate with two lightly buttered toasts and my tea, no sugar but a splash of milk, in my favorite coordinating mug slightly near Sherlock’s place setting. Not a hair out of place.
'Sher-Sher-Sherlock!' I cry out with my release. He continues to stroke my cock as I shudder and try to regain my breath. 'Okay. Okay! I get it, I get it! Apology accepted.'
'Oh bugger off you prat.' I go to lift my pants and trousers back up, but he stops me, pulling me down to sit by him. I lie my head on his chest as he strokes his hand through my hair. Kissing me softly atop my head, Sherlock mumbles ‘Are we okay? Am I not a shite boyfriend then?’
Shame you have on your pyjamas. I’m rather fond of your vulnerability in the mornings. It’s intimate the way you share parts of yourself with me, unbeknownst to you or not. Moments with you set in this stage are blissful, and I hope to have an eternity of them with you.
Slowly tracing my upturned finger along your sharp jawline, I nudge your chin upwards, exposing the blank canvas of your neck. I hear a slight hushed moan as my lips make contact scattering a constellation of kisses along the base of your throat. Before I am able to continue painting a masterpiece on your skin, you force yourself downward. Noses grazing one another. Eyes locked. Breathing each other in. It could be my last breath, and I would always use it on you. I claim your trembling lips with mine coming undone as you part them, giving me access. Your taste never wavers. My chest hitches as you dominate our dance pushing yourself forward crowding my sense. Our rhythm is tender, sure, and unabashed. How long we are captured in this intimate moment I know not, and I care not.
'You’re a damn tease, Sherlock Holmes.' I mutter wanting to pull his curls into my hands and push him where he knows he needs to focus and pay attention.
‘You’re the epitome of domesticity, John. Let me try for once. Can't risk my doctor catching a cold because he seems to always forget his house slippers when getting out of bed to make a cuppa. Enjoy your moment in bed alone because when I get back, I would like to continue this lazy kissing with you. I’m growing quite fond of you, you know that?’
My head swivels round breaking the eye contact with the possible apology letter, and I come nose to nose with Sherlock.
'A BIT NOT GOOD?! IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY? DO YOU JUST NOT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU’RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HAS GOALS!?' The words erupt from deep inside of me as if I was a once dormant volcano ready to lay waste to the unexpecting village below me. 'DO YOU SUPPOSE MAKING TEA AND GOING TO YOUR LEAST FAVORITE TESCO IS GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT?? HMM??'
I tug the collar of my coat up to avoid the muggy London air. It’s just another Tesco Tuesday except for the first time in two months Sherlock has decided to grace me with his presence while we shop. How I was able to pull him from this latest experiment - John, trust me when I tell you that the UV-Vis spectrophotometer is quite a simple machine, and that we do need one in our flat. It won’t take up that much room! - is beyond me. The last time I looked at him funny while he was in his studious nature, he threw me out of the flat with a huff, briskly telling me 'go grab a pint with Graham or Molly' and leave him be. To his dismay I had been out all night at the pub watching the game and didn’t get back in until well after two in the morning. Someone at 221B was a bit upset with the fact that their dinner hadn’t been made that night, and it sure wasn’t Mrs. Hudson. Ha. Served him right for kicking me out of our flat and having so many expectations.
I’m briskly walking back to my flat, but my short legs can only take me so fast. The thoughts swirling in my head overcome me, and I have to rest on a nearby bench. Have I eaten today? Is that why I’m nauseous or is it because I basically had a one sided domestic with Sherlock in the middle of Tesco over blackberry jam? My cold fingers run through my hair as I quiet an unexpected sob trying to escape my throat. Of course. Dinner at Angelo’s this past Thursday. That was the night we were to celebrate one of my published works. A case we worked on at that. Tears start to trickle down my cheeks. I was left there at Angelo’s all by myself, drawing unnecessary attention from Angelo walking by patting me on the back saying ‘He’ll show up. I just know it.’ By the end of the evening, my entire meal had been comped, and I traipsed back to our shared flat to find Sherlock passed out on the couch. I had been so embarrassed and hurt, that I completely blocked the fresh memory out, unwilling to bring it up to Sherlock and have a row with him over it.
Sherlock pouts, "No, you'll muss them up." He takes John's other hand, pouting even more at his friend's amused face.
John does as he is told and gets the duvet. Together they make a blanket fort John not letting his torch leave his hand.
John hummed in thought as the fae took his hand and began pressing kisses along them. He wondered if losing his antlers would hurt. Deer rubbed against trees to break them off, would it be the same for Fawnlock?
John tries his best not to flinch when Harry ruffles his hair and nods as he readjusts his pirate hat that she'd nearly knocked off with the action. He hates that nickname, "Yeah, sorry. Sherlock, this is my big sister Harry. Harry, this is Sherlock, he's on vacation here with his brother."
The Fae wriggled slightly, sitting back up to scoot to the edge of the mattress and wrap his arms around his mate, snuffling into the jumper he'd just put on, the material smelt delightfully of John, the scent comforting Fawnlock.
John watched as the fawn lit up happily as he described the coming spring and all the wonderful things they could do together. He loved that there was so much more to explore with his mate, and entire world to discover together and live in.
The elder Fae took the flowers happily, giving the human a soft smile, "Why thank you, aren't you a dear." She chuckled, "I think I can see why our prince is so fond of you." She settled a feathered hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently, before turning and starting to pad deeper into her home, "Now come, the sitting room's much more cozy." She lead him inside of the room and gestured to a rather weathered looking sofa. "I'm going to get something to put these in, they're very beautiful." She spared him another gently smile before she scurried off once more, before coming back a few moments later with a small vase with the flowers carefully arranged inside. She set them down carefully by a window, "Would you like some tea, then? A couple biscuits too? I just whipped some up."
The fawn watched John as his nose scrunched and the corner of his lips twitched slightly into a small smile. His ears twitched as he grabbed another biscuit, "I started the book you have me, then I did my rounds of the wood, came here, Mrs. Hudson made me tea and then asked me to go out and gather some things for her." He nibbled on the biscuit quietly, "I was out in the wood most of the morning doing that." His head tilted slightly as he examined the human, "You slept longer than you usually do, what did you do this morning?" He asked, taking another sip of his tea, which was almost gone.
Sherlock gives a sleepy chuckle, "Good, let's go back to sleep, m'kay?" He pulls his little nest of pillows and blankets closer to John's before curling up with his bee, a hand on John's arm as they doze off.
Fawnlock pressed one last kiss to his mate's lips before they parted completely, "I have a theory, that if you can't read regular Fae script, maybe you'd be able to read something I've written. I've written somethings, we can find them in my old den." The fawn smiled softly, nodding eagerly and happily followed John into the kitchen, helping him gather foods to bring.
Those mumbled, broken words and moans really were lovely, even if John couldn't understand half of it. He didn't have to know exactly what those words meant, because the meaning was so very clear in the tension of his body and the evident pleasure he was receiving from all that John was doing. But it was the drag of his name that really grabbed hold of his heart and stomach, squeezing them both tight with so much feelings he couldn't possibly contain it all in his chest.
Sherlock peers out of the kitchen and watches as the pair gets farther away from the table and the bottle of liquor. He purses his lips and darts out of the kitchen, grabbing the bottle and skidding back past Harry, taking John's hand. He drags John into the bathroom he'd noticed before, turning to lock the door after slamming it closed. He can hear Harry swearing and cursing on the other side.
After a few minutes, they entered a darker part of the wood, the fawn's demeanor changed and his ears dropped slightly. He padded up to a tree and placed a palm on the rough bark of the tree. He sighed softly dropping the human's hand to place his other hand in the tree's trunk. His tail flicked and he bowed his head. John watched Fawnlock as he gingerly touched the old, gnarled tree before them. He moved forwards and did the same, reaching up to touch the bark, feeling hoe brittle it was. The tree had died, and was rotting away. Definitely suitable for firewood.
"You are my happiness John, I didn't have any true contentment until you stepped foot into my ancient life." He murmured softly, ears flicking.
What more is that he didn't care... Sherlock didn't even blink and just moved on. He still wants to play with John, be his friend. John smiles brilliantly and chases after Sherlock, unshed tears of happiness in his ocean blue eyes.
Positioning himself beside Fawnlock, John checked the wound, inspecting the gashes. They were healing very cleanly, scarring over with no infection. The antibiotics had done their job then. John had been worried they might not work with the fawn's physiology.
"That I'm yours." He murmured softly against Fawnlock's mouth, leaning back and flashing him a smile.
"Oh!" he sees the cage and the file for Sirius that had been dropped off without them noticing. "Let's see how Sirius likes his new home!"
John doodles on his note book, bored as ever. The the first day of school is always about introductions, rules and assigning reading to be done for the week. The last two weeks were a nightmare. His sister tormented him the entire time since Sherlock left. He admires the medallion on his wrist that Sherlock gave him. He missed his Captain.
Sherlock chuckles, "Okay, then can we do the driftwood? I want John to see that!" He smiles and turns to his friend, "Do you know what happens when you burn driftwood, John?" He asks, taking a roasting stick that Winston hands each boy.
Sherlock nods tentatively, "And the Hobbit, always have.. I've read all the books." He gives John a smile, hugging Bilbo close.
"How was school Sherly?" He asks surprised, watching Sherlock bound cheerfully down the steps. He looks at the short blond boy being dragged willingly behind him and smiles, "I should have known." Mycroft looks down at his brother and his friend, "Hello John, good to see you."
As the kiss broke and once again air filled his lungs, John's tongue darted out over his lips, tasting the remnants of saliva left from their kiss. Fawnlock may have no real experienced, but John could have never known that from the passion he poured into the embrace. He pushed against the fawn's forehead, nuzzling him back as his gaze dropped once more to the wild thrusts of their hips, and wet slid of their pricks between the circles made from their hands.
"We'll take ours, ah- plenty of room." Mycroft blushes... he didn't want to "show off" any more than he wanted to prove that both Sherlock and himself could care for John if need be.
John’s thoughts were suddenly fractured apart when Fawnlock rocked forwards, drawing a low, bitten off moan from John as their groins brushed together. He closed his eyes for a moment, grip tightening on Fawnlock's backside before he reopened his eyes and found his mate staring down at him.
Sherlock nods eagerly and takes John's hand to lead him, though it's more like dragging, through the large house and through the back door with a bounce in every step. "Here we are! That," Sherlock pointed to a rather large and old looking oak, "is my thinking tree."
Last night Fawnlock had come back bored from the gate, and tonight he'd come back bloody. John could at least be thankful that his mate seemed to be a fast healer, as evident from his wrist. Of course, nothing made the fawn happier than something sweet.
The fawn froze momentarily, before wrapping his arms around the human. "It's okay, John." He murmured, nuzzling slightly into The top of John's head. His pale gaze was lowered as he pulled away, "Friends," he smiled softly before taking John's hand and leading him back to the sofa. He began to make himself a cup of tea, "Mrs. Hudson was surprised when I asked her to make me tea this morning, usually she makes me honey milk, she didn't think I'd like tea, but I do, especially the way you made it." He added a large dollop of honey and a spoonful of sugar to his tea, stirring it carefully. He took a sip and smiled once more, ears twitching before he snatched up a biscuit, munching on it happily with a pleased bleat.
After a moment he puts two and two together, the taller boy turns to John, "John, I think they're assuming we're 'boyfriends'... And that we.. threaten them in some way.." He puts another piece in play, frowning slightly.
"/Moosecroft,/" he murmured, turning to John, "I've got something I need to check out, come." He took the human's hand once more.
There was so much love in his face, John could feel it radiating through their bond like a miniature sun.
His mate was right; John had been riddled with nightmares, sometimes even every night for a long stretch of time. But since meeting the fawn, he hadn't had a single nightmare. How could he when he had someone who loved him curled in his arms as he sleep?
After several seconds the Fae nodded, "I'd like that, though, I believe my antlers would provide some trouble.." He murmured into the wool covering his love's torso.
But he still didn't want other Fae spending so much time with his mate, it was a territory thing. But after the look he received in return to his objection from Moosecroft, his ears dropped slightly.
boyfriend, I'd like the graciously accept.." Mycroft beams at Greg and squeezes his fingers lightly, trembling with excitement.
He had the urge to bound up and pounce upon his brother in an embrace like he had as a young fawn when he caught up and spotted his brother, but he didn't, he couldn't, not after so long. He was still pleasantly content with his brother's eventual understanding, though the young Fae had lose his composure a bit for it to happen.
He looked thoughtful for a moment, watching his mate fumble with the cap to the shampoo before showing him how to click it open.
It'd been a long day, and really all he wanted was to crawl into their nest and cuddle until they drifted off into sleep. But he wasn't going to go tossing his...well his brother-in-law out when he was actually being decent and sweet, something he probably wasn't very often.
Sherlock nods, "And I need to finish this maths review worksheet," he taps the worksheet with his pencil before he taps the eraser on his bottom lip. "I doubt final exams will be hard for me." He said, looking down at the paper and doing a few problems. "What do you have to do?" He asks, glancing up at his brother, pencil still on his paper.
As the fawn moved his hand to join John's, the man slid his fingers up around the speckled digits, intertwined their hands together as they stroked together. He was more than happy to be patient, to teach Fawnlock how to be intimate with another person, because it was only beneficial to them both in the end. It was the most delicate, wonderful thing you could trust someone for, and John was the one Fawnlock had put his trust in.
John hummed and touched the wildflowers crowning the fawn's mess of curls; he longed for spring, and then his rough fingers would work those delicate flowers into crowns for his mate, and hopefully catch that same wonderful, happy smile. And the pages turned more, and John witnesses their father cradling that small toddler with such obvious love, John couldn't help but smile.
John closed his eyes with a soft sigh as the nimble fingers dragged through his hair. Here, John could be selfish for a bit, and let someone care for him for once. He'd always been saving others, not only patients and soldiers, but his family too. And that had been the hardest. But whether intentional or not Fawnlock had saved him.
The fawn wriggled slightly, making himself more comfortable before peppering kisses across John's face, over cheeks and the bridge of his nose. Fawnlock recuperated John's nuzzles, bleating softly, damp nose sliding over the human's skin, snuffling slightly. The rumble in the fawn's chest grew to be the loudest it'd ever been, Fawnlock's back arched into John's hands, giving a soft bleat. John's hands roamed over the fawn's back, feeling the velvety fur beneath his fingertips as the fae arched backwards.
Soon they have things put away and they are in their beach clothes, rushing out with a bucket full of sampling tools for the Holmes brothers to collect specimens.
"Should we consider lunch for after? My dear Johnny tends to get hungry every few hours." Mrs. Watson asks Mycroft, still holding his arm.  She likes this boy, polite and gentlemanly - would be good for Harry to be friends with. Too bad she is a lesbian, good family to marry into... Still, maybe he could be a good influence on the fifteen-year-old rebel.
Fawnlock nodded content, nibbling on a biscuit. He finished his tea and noticed the human eyeing his antlers and his ears a bit longingly. The fawn's ears twitched in thought before he bowed his head slightly before the human, he gave a slight huff, "You can touch them, if you'd like, I understand they're unique and interesting to you. My antlers aren't as hard as they would be yet, but the cold is coming and my ears are a tad sensitive." His ears flicked once more, he didn't let anyone touch his head, save Mrs. Hudson, but he was fond of John.
John watched him walk across the thin blanket of snow that had settles in the garden, then shut the door and crossed over to his mate.
After a fair amount of cuddling and kisses, and those soft murmurs in a foreign language that sounded like music to John's ears, the fae was perking up and scenting the air. He had a much better sense of smell than John did, so the man was prone to trust his judgment.
"Aye Captain." John laughs, seeing a daddy long legs resting on a patch of grass. He motions to it for Sherlock to see. "They are rude and closed minded. I hate them. So mean."
The Fae sighed softly, turning to one of the last portraits of the brothers, several years after their parents passing, his ears twitched slightly, as his did nose. The fawn flipped to a recent portrait of him and Mrs. Hudson, then the last amount of pages were blank, a place for new memories. Times with John.
The fawn bleated softly at the kisses eyes fluttering closed as he reveled in their gentleness and the warmth they spread. His ears twitched slightly at John's words, he huffed softly. "It was boring at first, same as always, but I had this sense of... Foreboding..," he mumbled something in his language before continuing, "I was weary, soon something tried to push through the veil, I was able to contain it.. At first, then it lashed out, pushed me back. I hit the ground, and a rock," his hand lifted and he gently tapped the butterfly bandage over his wound, "I got back up, I felt a bit hazy, I maimed it with my antlers, it fought back when I tried to push it back through the veil, I was winning but it surprised me, clawed at me, I got hit, but I was finally able to push it back, it didn't come back, I hurt it pretty bad." He sighed softly, cuddling close, "It was weird, this creature was all dark... I couldn't really see it." He huffed softly. The fawn nosed at John once more, the rumble in his chest starting out softly.
Sherlock was terrified. He did not understand why he had to do this. In his opinion, everything had been going great in his life; he’d had some rather interesting scientific discoveries lately and only started to dive into all the interesting experiments there were. But apparently his mother didn’t think the same. And now he was stuck in this room with morons, one duller than the other. And all of them were staring at him.
It had been too late from the moment he had looked into John’s eyes and seen nothing of John in them.
He gave Lestrade a supressed smile and moved closer to the door. This time, the teacher had no intention of keeping him here or doing some more talking, so he let Sherlock through with a small smile.
This time, a tall, dark-haired man appeared soon after the announcement. He was thin and seemed a little jittery. He was wearing an expensive-looking coat. Dragging a slick-looking suitcase after himself, he arrived at the counter just moments after the blond man who had got up at the first announcement. He was already urgently talking to the airline assistant that was standing behind the counter of their gate. At the moment, she was raising her hand defensively. “Listen, I am very sorry about the inconvenience –“ As the tall, curly-haired man arrived, she smiled, showing relief at the prospect of being released from the first man’s impatience.
“Can passenger Sherlock Holmes for flight A5372 come to the counter please, can passenger Sherlock Holmes for flight A5372 come to the counter please.”
“Sherlock Holmes, is it? How the hell did you know why I was in New York? Are you a weird stalker I should know about? Should I flee from this room right now?”  He had meant it only half-serious, but he couldn’t stop a little worry from sneaking into his words.
Not showing any of his inner conflict, he stepped toward his locker. Reaching for the lock, he dropped his bag on the floor. The other boy jumped and turned. He looked horrified; when he saw Sherlock, he visibly relaxed.
“Mr. Holmes, I regret to inform you that unfortunately, you have missed your connecting flight to London. Now, we know this is due to the delay from your first flight –“
But Sherlock’s words had no impact on John. He went down and only when Sherlock saw the blood gushing out of John’s body his brain caught up.
The halls were quiet except from Sherlock’s footsteps which echoed loudly from the walls. During the day, it didn’t feel that loud, even though a lot more people were wandering around and screaming at each other.
Outside, he took a deep breath, walking away from his brother and his pity and questions and accusations. He couldn’t take it; his own thoughts were enough.
The walk to the hotel was mostly silent. It felt awkward to walk next to a stranger and know you would spend the night together. Or, well, at least in the same room.
Sherlock cursed loudly. He had been awake for most of the night after falling asleep so early in the evening. It had been a waking-up-and-falling-asleep all night long; he felt accordingly exhausted.
Before Sherlock could answer, the airline employee had finished her conversation. “I apologise, gentlemen, but it seems as if there is only one room left at the hotel. And you have both been booked into it. The only alternative is a hotel closer to the city. I can try to get a room there, but I am not sure –“
“Don’t be ridiculous, brother mine.” Mycroft suddenly looked very tired. “But you read what the psychologist says.”
Not needing to tell the driver where to go, he silently rested his head on the back of his seat and tried to relax a little. His first day had been dull but bearable. He didn’t like the thought of being stuck in this school for the next few years, but for now it had to be enough.  And maybe he could find out more about this boy.
They probably wouldn’t have met again if John Watson hadn’t seen an ad in the paper a couple of weeks later, of someone looking for a flat mate. He was scanning the newspaper absent-mindedly when a name caught his eye. “Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective in the world, looking for flat mate. The address is 221B Baker Street. For inquiries call number below.”
Sherlock didn’t bother answering. He thought about getting a cup of tea before he left, but decided against it. He didn’t want to be slowed down on his first days of school.
John took another swig of the beer, then stared at the bottle as if he saw it for the first time. Sherlock felt awkward, as if he had asked the wrong question. He didn’t know what to do, but before he could start going through options, John spoke.
“MYCROFT,” he yelled through the house. He didn’t care if he was being loud; dammit, this house needed some noise. He didn’t care what his mother was going to say; he wanted her to explain herself. He didn’t care if Mycroft would accuse him of spying on him; he wanted his brother to know he had.
Horror defined his face when he stroked the outline of John’s lips with his thumb; they tasted salty from his tears as he placed a chaste kiss on them. With closed eyes, Sherlock breathed in the smell of John one last time; he needed to memorize more; needed to memorize everything; needed to know how John smelled; needed to feel the texture of his jumpers; needed to thread his fingers through the blonde hair before it was too late.
Sure enough, Sherlock found a staircase at the end of the hallway which led to a small door with translucent glass. Carefully, he pushed it open.
John looked disbelieving for a second, but then he thought better. He smiled at Sherlock encouragingly. “That’s not a problem. Here, it’s really simple …”
Sherlock managed not to roll his eyes. “So what are you going to do? And when were you going to tell me? You can hardly think I wouldn’t have found out sooner or later.”
Mycroft sighed. “You read the document, Sherlock. I don’t know what there is that you could possibly need an explanation for.”
“You should think about your future, Sherlock. I know, you disapprove of holding a position in the government, but we both know what you are able of doing. You know your silly little experiments are not going to get you far. Maybe it is time to come back to reality. Grow up, Sherlock,” Mycroft said with what sounded like pity.
John laughed again. “I don’t know how the hell you did it, but I suppose I am an open book. Oh well, I can’t hide who I am. Probably for the best, too.”
Sherlock stayed behind and pretended he was rearranging the contents of his book back. In reality, he didn’t want the others to see him getting into the pompous black car that was surely waiting for him at the front entrance. When he finally couldn’t pretend anymore, he got up with a sigh only to see that two people were still in the room. There was his teacher – Lestrade or something like that, not important – but more importantly,
Mycroft only stared at Sherlock in response, but he didn’t care. He was used to his brother reacting to him like this; sometimes he really wondered why his behaviour still came like a surprise to him. His mother looked more composed than his brother, although she couldn’t hurt the glint of anger in her eyes. Sherlock didn’t care. He looked around the room they were in. It was pompous, just like the rest of the house, and lit badly with several standard-lamps. He didn’t like it. The walls were covered in an awfully patterned wallpaper that looked expensive enough to impress visitors; the table they were sitting at was big and of dark oak. Sherlock couldn’t imagine a more uncomfortable place for dinner. It was just one of the things he felt at least partly compelled to take part in. But not today. Not when his mother and brother decided to play the game of superficiality to nicely.
Sherlock caressed John’s face in a desperate effort to comfort him. “Hold still, John, they’re coming, they’re going to fix this, don’t worry. It’ll be alright.”
Sherlock watched as John slightly laughed at his words, or rather tried to; he watched painfully as affection and amusement flashed over John’s face.
The former detective left the roof and St. Bart’s and Molly and Lestrade and the cases and he didn’t think he would ever come back because it reminded him too much of
The receptionist handed over the keys and wished them a good night. The slim suitcase and leathery briefcase were carried outside the lobby, and up to the second floor.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his brother’s words, but managed to choke out an answer. “It was great, Mother. I could not ask for a better facility to educate me in the most absorptive years of my life. The averageness and of stupidity of the students and teachers is just lovely and I am sure we will get along just fine. I can’t wait to waste the next few years in there; what an opportunity!”
Despite wincing inwardly at the falseness of his answer, he hoped this was satisfying enough, but Lestrade didn’t seem like the very bright type.
Mycroft took care of the formal stuff; he organized the funeral and almost couldn’t convince Sherlock to go. It had taken harsh words to shake Sherlock off his stupor; only the words “he came to yours” made him appear at the ceremony; he left as soon as it was over. He couldn’t stand the sad faces and the tears and the regret and sorrow and all he wanted to do was throw up, but he didn’t. Instead he walked around London all day and at night he found himself back at Baker Street, still in his funeral suit, the drugs in front of him, and when he was high and screaming and crying and begging for an end, he was sure Mrs Hudson heard him, but he didn’t care, because he had no reason to care anymore.
Sherlock nodded distractedly and skimmed his gaze over the room once more. He obviously couldn’t sit next to
They arrived at the reception desk still giggling. “Good evening, sirs, how can I help you?” The receptionist was looking from one to the other curiously.
When the bell rang to signalise the day was over, the majority jumped up, packed their book backs and ran out of the classroom.
“Could be worth a little deducing,” Sherlock thought, before his thoughts drifted off to his latest experiment that was waiting for him at home.
“No, John, you are. Do you hear me? For God’s sake, you’re not going to die on me! You can’t. We’re going to get you to a hospital; the ambulance is going to show up any minute and you are going to last that long, you understand me? You can’t leave me.”
Sherlock could feel his cheeks turning slightly red. Slowly, he turned to face John. “Uh…” was all he managed to say.
, it would have been too embarrassing, and so he was going to have to choose someone else. After a short consideration he crossed the room and sat down next to the girl. He pretended not to notice the twist of her mouth as he sat down.
The woman dragged the corners of her mouth upwards, nodded, and, after some clicks on the computer screen, confirmed the room number. “Your luggage will be taken care of for you, of course. And please enjoy breakfast on us in the morning.”
Next to him, Mycroft sighed. He knew what this look on Sherlock’s face meant and he didn’t like it. Sherlock decided to scowl even more.
“It’s not getting better, John”, he whispered. “It’s not getting better at all. It’s just getting worse and worse and every day that passes is another promise that you won’t come back. I don’t know what I’m doing anymore, John. I never did without you. I just want you back.”
