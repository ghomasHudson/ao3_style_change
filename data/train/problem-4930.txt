The voice from the ceiling said which made Steve hum, but the woman and the man behind him froze and looked at him for a little while before starting whispering with each other furiously, which Steve ignore as they stopped bothering Steve or ordering him around, which made the Omega relax a little as he tried to calm himself down a little, when the door ping and open the were greeted by the sound of screaming and shouting.
"Howard, what are you doing here?" Jarvis's confused voice made Tony turn his head to the side, to see his father leaning on the wall beside the door and frowning while looking at Steve, something that made the hair on Tony's body to rise, and a raging growl nearly left his throat, if it wasn't for the sob of pain Steve let out, which shifted Tony's attention to his mate once more.
When six months mark hit, Tony woke up in the middle of the night screaming his lungs off, shaking, crying, and cursing, he felt something squeezing his heart and refused to let go. That day he went to the hidden stash in the kitchen, he stares at the alcohol bottles, maybe for seconds, maybe minutes, maybe hours. That was until he admits defeat until he took them and start drinking bottle after bottle, he knew that him drinking the alcohol was him admitting his son was truly dead… and Tony hates himself for that…
"First… first hope was going to die…" Steve said remembering the scene he saw… how Peter the kid that was full of energy and love and happiness, no older than thirteen from what he saw, rushed to save Tony, having so much endless hope that he will succeed in his quest like a knight in shining armor. "Then everyone will lose their will to live." Tony, beautiful and amazing Tony, holding into Peter tightly screaming and weeping and cursing the Gods begging for Peter's survival, but no answer came, and when he heard Bucky's voice talking to Steven, he was so broken… like he already knew that there was no hope, no way out… "It will end with death…" So twisted, that version he saw of himself that took Peter and Tony away… so twisted that its features were that of a monster, Steven even had a rough time separating his face from Thanos and death and hater.
"Steve… what are you saying? Steve, let's go back home… S-Steve?" Tony whispered in a confused and horrified tone, extending his arm toward Steve as if trying to reach him, and Steve couldn't help but raise his hand to Tony, gazing at his arm in fascination when it disintegrates before him, turning into stardust at the slightest breeze…
"Can I really stay with Mr. Stark?" Peter whispered which made Tony nod his head with a smile which made the pup grin widely showing his teeth as he starts jumping. "Yes, yes, yes! Can I see the bots, Mr. Stark? Can I help you with the lab? Oh, oh, I have a great idea!" Peter rushed as he gripped Tony's pants which made the Alpha flinch a little at the boy's loud voice looking at Tony and mouthing 'Sorry' which made the Omega laugh at that and shake his head.
"When you live more than 2500 years, it is in your right to curse however you want and whoever you want, considering that you know every cursing word that was utter since the start of time, you useless meat bag!" Steven snarled at the blond, making the man jump back like Steven was going to attack any minute now.
"I advise you to show yourself; you would not like what I am to do if you continued this game of cat and mouse," Steve called out after he reached a small clearing in the forest, turning his head to the direction he last hear the shadow from. A dark look was painting his face as he waited for the person who would dare to show their face, wondering if it was one of Tyber's minions sent after him.
Whatever harsh words and actions Anton planned on spewing got stuck in his throat with no way for them to be out, because when Anton turned his head to the queen…. The queen was crying. Fat tears were rolling down the queen's cheeks, causing the queen's flushed face to turn red; Anton doesn't know if the redness was because of the queen's offers to hold the sounds of his pain back or if it was from how wound up he was. "He took, and you welcomed him back?" Anton's breath hitched when the queen's voice broke. Not once, not even when the queen lost his stillborn child did the man ever let someone see him cry, and to witness this now, part of Anton felt like he was gazing at something that he has no right to see. "No trust, you Alphas are all the same, liars!" The queen hissed before turning around and walking away from Anton, so fast that the Alpha had a hard time saying that the queen wasn't running.
Anton swallowed, trying to banish the memories of pain, fear, and helplessness that took over him. Closing his eyes Anton tried to collect himself, taking a deep breath in the hope of forgetting what he just saw, what he felt. He tried to banish the memories of teary blue eyes as they took him in with panic, he tried to shake away how the woman whispered these words in a low voice that even the man above her didn't hear…
Natasha’s eyes flitted from the front windshield to Steve’s face and then back again. “Going after him is a dead end,” she said, vehemently. “SHIELD’s tried to get a hold on him several times and every mission has been a failure.”
Steve pursed his lips, knowing better than to think Bucky was being serious. “It’s called marriage, these days.” He followed Bucky as he made a slow walk across the room. “Why are you here? I thought you were having a good time down there.”
It was wonderful. The liberating feel of just being able to kiss Steve whenever he wanted. The feel of his lips on Steve’s. Forming that connection again.
Steve was already apologizing and Tony was still busy fighting the incredibly bad impulse to dive in for seconds. Steve had
Tony hummed, and there were steps, and then he stood next to him. The arc reactor shining through his shirt cast a dimmed light against the window front. Bucky tried not to look at his mirror image, but eventually, his eyes flickered sideways. Tony’s gaze was locked on the stump where Bucky’s metal arm had been.
As soon as Tony stepped into the workshop, he rushed over to where the bulb was still standing beneath the huge bell jar.
“You were right,” he added. “Extremis was messing with my perception, I stopped second-guessing myself, which, let’s be honest, has always been a bit of a problem with me—”
Tony smiled and leaned in to whisper in Steve’s ear. “You sure you don’t want to get out of here? Take off, just the two of us, for a dirty weekend somewhere?”
Captain America. More importantly: He was Steve Rogers. And he wasn’t the sort of man who cowered under bullies. “None of it.”
You come here, encouraging him to pursue his naïve dreams of a better world. Trying to destroy everything I’ve built these last few years.”
He couldn’t help but smile back at her, probably far too wide and far too open, but alas. Natasha had seen him in various states of sleep-deprived clumsiness by now and Tony had long stopped gauging his every move around her. She made to stand up, grabbing for a bottle of water and pushing a straw through the opening.
Steve motioned at the tiny candle in the middle of the cupcake. On top of the meringue frosting, there was a delicately written
TS 7:04 P.M.>Sure you don’t, sweetie-pie. That’s a yes to café date right? Tell me when you’re back and we set up a time?
Tony licked into his belly button with a fevered moan, sliding a hand between them to free Steve’s cock from his pants. He grinned up at him, and the mischief his eyes only made the ache between Steve’s legs more pronounced. “Glad you agree.”
"Next time, you’ll let me watch the whole thing," he said, even as he bodily turned Tony around and took another step back so he could watch at least some of what was happening. With his eyes fixed on Tony's ass and the slow slide of his slick fingers, Steve turned to scoop some of the lube onto his fingers so he could get his own cock slick and ready.
“Jealous?” Natasha asked without once looking away from the television, but Tony could see a small yet scary smile tugging on her lips.
In the far distance, Tony could see the Arts Faculty. It was already late afternoon, but the auditoriums were still lit, and Tony knew from a little hack into Steve’s schedule that he had classes on late Monday.
Bucky paused, surprised, his eyes wide as he stared at his friend. "What do you mean 'gone'? What did you do?"
Whew, next chap's already gonna be the last one! I'm so giddy about writing Civil War, though, it's lots of fun so far, and I hope you guys will be there for it :)
The roar of the sea filled Steve’s ears and a cold shiver raced through his body, as if the waves suddenly started to whisper a certain name.
Things were… tense, to put it mildly. The US government was prying more and more into their lives. For now, Tony had been able to keep them at bay, but Steve knew it was just a matter of time before they all had to testify about Sokovia. For now, though, all he could do was have Tony’s back.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but I had to step out today,” Steve explained, fully aware that they had never really shared any personal information before. Tony didn’t know he was in the army. “I’m at the front lines.”
“So this is where you’re having your sordid affair with Howard’s boy?” Bucky asked after a minute of silence.
“STOP TALKING!” Ultron shouted, clearly some response to whatever Tony was telling him in his mind, his voice manic as he forced himself to his feet. “You’d both do better to remember who you’re talking to!”
He really needed to get Steve to write down when and where those visions were happening to him. Natasha and Clint had at least given them some pointers to what their triggers could potentially be. With Steve, who acted like if he didn’t keep those visions a secret something horrible would happen, it was like skipping through a goddamn minefield.
“Did you bring enough in case Steve’s metabolism burns through it?” Tony asked and stepped up to Thor. There were at least twenty vials in there, so there was plenty of antidote at their expense…
“Nah,” Tony said, unable to stop his mouth from tilting into a half-smile. He tried to get a glimpse at the ring, but Steve still had his hand closed around it. “That sounds exhausting. Think I might just take what I’ve got here and leave it to you to make up for this… very
“Coward,” Tony murmured against those lips, pouring all of his outrage and despair into the kiss, while Steve was pressing himself against Tony furiously. It
For a beat, Steve remained stock still, his whole body seemingly freezing. But then, his hands shifted and he was pulling Tony in, angling his head just right. The next thing Tony knew, Steve nipped at his lips with blunt teeth until he opened up for him, and it was as if they had been
It was amazing how the world had changed in only four short years. Or was it just Tony’s workshop? There were so many things Steve didn’t recognize—the displays alone looked nothing like he had seen in 2018.
. Tony moaned into his mouth and he felt it. His hands slid down over his shoulders and he felt it. Warmth blazed across every inch of his skin.
Ian took that moment to yawn adorably, and the disgruntled expression that followed sent everyone to another cooing-fit.
Once they had landed, Tony flew just above street level, opening doors and windows until every family in the central districts was ushered to leave the city. They had split up, with Steve, Thor and Bruce working to direct the cars leaving the city via the many bridges, Clint, Sam and the Maximoff kids evacuating the residential areas, and Tony and Vision scouting high in the air. He stayed close to the others, but from up here, he could see Sokovia extending in all directions. For a city this large, there was surprisingly little light, not at all like the near-constant brightness of New York.
Steve smiled, patting Bucky’s back with calm reassurance. “Yeah…” he agreed. “Luckily your girlfriend helped me through it.”
As soon as he stepped into the hallway, slow footsteps sounded, then the door creaked open. Natasha was staring intently at her phone, not even looking up.
Every morning, Mister Stark would be waiting for him at breakfast and more often than not, they’d spend the rest of the day together. He told Steve about his meetings at the conference, told him about his inventions, he joked with Steve, warmed him with his laughter and taught him a hundred things about life without even realizing it.
Fear gripped him; insidious, chilly tendrils curling up and wrapping around his stomach, creeping upwards toward his heart. If Barnes hurt Steve—or worse, if something happened to Steve because Tony hadn’t been at his side, he’d never forgive himself.
He pursed his lips in thought. There were flashes here and there and an odd sense that he needed to be very embarrassed when it came to looking Steve in the eye today, but other than that, nothing particularly scandalous came to mind. “No,” he said. “Not a thing. Why? Did I do something? Oh God, I did something, didn’t I? Dammit. This is why I didn’t bring any hard liquor.” He tried to sit up and immediately fell back with a pained groan.
He couldn’t believe it had already been three days since they’d defeated Thanos. He and Vision almost hadn’t made it, and Bucky and Peter were still in the hospital. Bucky had been the worst off, almost losing his other arm, too, but by now, he was recovering well.
The last days had been a whirlwind of many things. Most of the time, they’d been busy helping with the cleanup all over the city, and the few hours they hadn’t been busy carrying rubble around, they’d sat in SHIELD’s New York headquarter, discussing the attack and preparing for the day when Thor would bring Loki back to Asgard.
He licked his lips and held his breath as he pulled his fingers free. Spending too much time on this would only drive him crazy at this point, so to get himself back under control he turned to a more practical task and tore the package open to lube up his dick.
“Of course you are,” Steve said, slightly out of air. “It’s all out in the open: You just didn’t turn out impressive enough.”
"Gladly," Tony said, looking at Steve over his shoulder. He leaned one arm against the wall, bracing himself while he scissored his fingers. The squelching noises were obscene, and their only counterpoint were Tony's steady moans and Steve's ragged breathing. All in all, it was almost a bit funny how fast he'd gone from not knowing if he wanted this sort of sex again and craving Steve's dick like he craved nothing more... but looking at him, his eyes fixed on Tony's body like he was the thing he most wanted in life... it probably didn't get much better than that.
There was no wariness in Steve’s eyes when he finally opened them. No hesitation—only warmth. And that solidified it. No going back now.
He walked over to the closet, picking one of his fancier suits, since he already knew where this was going. Meanwhile, JARVIS provided him with the recent news feeds. Almost every channel was reporting about ‘The Winter Soldier Unmasked’, using photos and videos of Barnes’ past. Half of them were showing him at Steve’s side.
Natasha would know about their appointment. Pepper had pinky-swore not to tell anyone, so she must’ve overheard him and Steve talking. The only question was whether or not she’d passed the information to the whole team yet. “We hadn’t exactly planned to let that cat out of the bag yet…” he told her with a pointed glare. “And it’d be nice to keep it that way.”
“It’s all right,” she said, immediately. “You know I’ve had worse.” She stood up and walked over to them, then brushed a hand down his tangled hair. “Этоничего, любимый.”
Steve nodded slowly. “I should’ve reacted better… I should’ve told you it didn’t matter. You just caught me off-guard, but… I’ve missed you,” Steve confessed.
Steve leaned further against the kitchen island because his legs were threatening to fold under him.
Next to Maria, Natasha grinned knowingly, and obviously sensed that there was good gossip at hand. “And tomorrow’s the big day? Finally?”
If the way Barnes had latched onto Natasha like a baby octopus was anything to go by, it was hard to imagine him as some sort of ‘ladies’ man’, but
A gasp tore from Tony’s throat. “Fine with me,” he agreed, rubbing himself against Steve’s hand. “Get on with it.”
Tony tried to ignore how hard his heart was hammering inside the suit, but it was no use. Everything had happened so fast, too goddamn fast, and the adrenaline of the battle was still steadfastly pumping through his veins.
It was loud and piercing, and was yanking him out of a very nice dream by the scruff of his neck. He tried to block the sound by covering his head with another pillow, but it was too persistent. He couldn’t ignore it. Not just because it was so damn loud, but because something inside of his sleep fogged brain was telling him he shouldn’t.
Tony cupped Steve’s face and kissed him. His lips were so soft, a fact that never ceased to amaze Tony. Even after hours of fighting, and dishing out the most brutal punches and kicks, his lips were still soft.
Tony grew silent for a second, considering. No, it didn’t matter where they went. As long as they were together nothing seemed to matter. The last few weeks had opened doors Tony had never even considered. And though they might lead down tumultuous paths, he was confident he and Steve could emerge from any conflict better for it.
Steve all but shook with laughter by now and the disgruntled look on Tony’s face didn’t make it any better. He pulled him near, grinning widely. “If you walk a
It took both of them a second to make the connection between Steve’s voice and someone actually having entered the workshop, and that probably spoke volumes of how out of it they seemed to be. Bruce raised one hand in an awkward greeting, while Tony made a move to pull the towel off of his face, but apparently decided against it halfway through.
“Lovely,” Tony commented, smiling. He took Ian with him as he walked up and down the room. His eyes fell on the door leading to the reading room, and following a sudden thought, he walked into it.
Tony nodded, closing his fingers around the small tool. And then, and it was by far the hardest thing Steve had ever done in his entire life, he let go of Tony, and turned around.
“Better get used to it, mate,” Clint said with a resigned wave in their general direction. “Cause it’s never ever going to stop…”
Steve’s arms tightened around him, his body quivering terribly. “I never moved on. It was just about getting through another day.”
It couldn’t be helped though. He hadn’t seen Bucky in so long, and Tony didn’t speak with him anyway. Thus, it was almost morning when Steve felt his eyes drop. He hadn’t even managed to change out of his uniform, when the air split. The blurred objects in the room formed shape, and he found himself slammed into the door behind him with an angry Tony pressed to his front.
Peter laid his head on his hand, looking like he was thinking really hard, before shaking his head softly. ”But Daddy is never sick.”
Peter nodded seriously, picking the blue car up too, holding it next to the red one. ”Yes! He says that it’s more practi — practical.”
Steve’s smile fell off his face, adding tension to the room from a second to the next. “You are suffering, aren’t you?”
— who had settled down in a chair and looked miserable from there. He looked like his high school sweetheart had just ditched him and he was beyond heartbroken and Tony really didn’t have the patience or nerves to cheer him up.
”What is it?” Tony asked straight out, because hell, he was so sick of this heavy silence with someone he should be closest to. ”What makes you so special?”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest but then couldn’t stop thinning of Peter from this morning, when he had done the same. Jesus, the kid really did look like him. There was something so terrifying about that thought that Tony couldn’t even keep his arms like that. He let them fall to his side awkwardly, wondering when he had lost his smoothness.
Rogers was about to pick up the next shirt but then dropped his hands to his sides instead, turning to look at Tony with a tiredness that just a father could muster. ”Let you see what?”
And it wasn’t that Tony didn’t want to think about what it meant, because of what he might find out.
“Tell you about what?” Rhodey’s eyes were half closed and he sat up as if nothing but will power was holding him up.
He could hear them scream every time he blinked. Tony didn’t know if it was a flashback or just something this creature had planted into his head, but he could feel it.
Steve seemed to have seen the change in Tony’s posture, because after Peter finished his reading lesson, Steve got up quietly, ruffling Peter’s hair, but didn’t say anything.
How am I supposed to —” Clint turned his gaze to the floor, swallowed, his breath trembling, there was no fire behind his words anymore, he just looked tired. ”You could have died, Tony.”
Turned out he didn’t have bring down the moon to make Steve happy, all it would’ve taken was to be his home. But he screwed this up so badly that Steve felt like he’d feel better in Bucky’s presence than Tony’s.
”How about you put on your outside clothes and your raincoat and we can go to the park and learn numbers by counting the doggies there, huh?” Steve said more soft this time, finally snapping back to the present.
Tony coughed a few times, trying to find an explanation. Trying to remember if he had seen a ring on the girl’s hand, he went home with or if he had seen anything that had pointed at her having a child.
Tony wanted to shake his head just to piss Rogers off. See if he could get any other expression out of the man except for
“It makes me feel —” He ended in a shrug again, he didn’t know what she wanted to hear, but he knew that adults didn’t like it when he answered wrong.
Tony hummed and blinked one eye open, looking up at Rhodey, who looked like he was patting himself on the shoulder on the inside,
“You don’t have those seeds. You have everything in your brain that would be needed, like the apple. But it still has no seeds.”
”Yeah, let’s talk about our marriage.” Rogers expression opened up excitedly, but fell again just as fast, when Tony finished his sentence. ”So, did we have like an open relationship?”
“I don’t mean to hurt you, Tony, but think this through, okay? You don’t know if it is love that you feel or just joy.” Well, Steve certainly sounded like he was sure that it
Tony was about to abort mission, because Jesus, seeing the kid walking up to him like that made the whole thing a lot more
And that just hit Tony. It was as if he had just lived through the longest second of his life and suddenly
Sure enough, he had dog tags on his neck. No way. There just wasn’t a way he had ever served. Tony’s breath quickened for a second before he got a better look at them.
Tony shook his head and wrapped up his plans for the new arm; he couldn’t focus anymore anyway. He walked slowly to his coffee machine, rubbing his temples and tried hard to not think about anything anymore, it just distracted him too much.
Rogers obviously wanted him to ask questions and get to know them, to make sure he’d finally relearn how to act around the kid. This morning hadn’t been the first time he had made him cry and he was honestly sorry about it. He got why Rogers wanted him to finally learn how to talk to a child.
Steve’s smile just brightened, giving Tony the feeling of warmth again, that he had tried to ignore for the past few weeks.
He tried to find his best options, maybe crack another joke, see if he could get any reaction out of Rogers. Anything but his sad frown.
He told Rogers exactly that when he came to find him, anger still missing from his face. He just looked disappointed but not surprised at all. Tony shouldn’t be as bothered by it as he was. Who gave a damn that he had disappointed a stranger? He shouldn’t. He still did, though, just a little.
There was nothing but pain but he was not injured and so confused. What was he supposed to do? He took deep breaths and looked up, trying to get a hold on something but he couldn’t.
Tony watched as a long string of cheese fell from the spoon down onto the table, and without thinking for another second he let go of the whole spoon and listened to it fall on the floor
that is. He was certain he did. Yeah, he might haven’t had the most experience with this kind of thing and only practically was this short of impossible, but
Tony nodded at him and then went straight to the coffee machine, watching Sam out of the corner of his eye.
. His hands lying in his own lap. Frown right in place; as was his sadness shadow. Tony thought about if this sadness was his fault or if Rogers was just one of those people who have already seen too much on this earth as to ever lose this sadness again. If it had always followed him around like a nasty rain cloud.
. He needed some kind of reaction, just something that would tell him that he really was back and that the others could see his failure too, but nothing.
noticed him, he made a little hand motion and flashed Tony one of his tiny smilies, that still made his frail heart pump a little faster.
(I am so busy rn, it's not even funny anymore -- but I have like the whole story already written (I actually wrote it literally 7 months ago fsddhfdsj hi)
Rogers face lit up a little when Tony finally took part in the conversation. ”My twin sister was our surrogate.”
”No, no, it’s a great idea, Tony,” Steve said, eyes bright blue and shining with so much honesty that Tony felt like it’d burn him alive.
nodded seriously and then ran off to the door, struggling with the handle for a second before running outside, shouting ”Uncle Bucky!”
And it really shouldn’t have surprised him so much, he knew it deep down already, somewhere in his subconscious but it really did. He should have been more careful, shouldn’t just have ignored the obvious signs. His body couldn’t take or heal injuries as fast as it used to.
“He is six, it will be fine.” His father told his wife over and over again, while she took a few steps from Tony, looking like she didn’t believe it for a second.
Tony was about to scoff and disagree but Steve raised his hand and shook his head determined. ”Don’t. I do. I know that you have a heart even though you try really hard to not let it show. You don’t have to, I know you don’t trust me with it. But Peter has done nothing wrong. He deserves to have his hero and I know that you don’t think it’s you, but it is.”
Peter began to chuckle about the bad word again, Rogers, though, just spotted a disapproving frown. ”Do you mind watching your language around our kid?”
Steve looked after his son and then rubbed his hand through his hair, taking another shuttering breath before getting up, not walking closer to Tony. He looked at his hand though, as if he wanted to grab it. He looked defeated and as if ready to give anything right now to stop whatever
It worked either way. But Tony got bored fast, Rogers’s pants weren’t exactly tight so all Tony could do was guess at best.
He through a wink at Wilson and placed his now empty mug in the sink behind him, before he walked, still quietly snickering, past them all in the direction of his workshop. He totally did not blush when he got a little glance of Steve’s reddened neck and ears, clearly thinking about the fact that Tony loved to beg for more while getting fucked by him.
And also Tony knew that in his fridge was nothing but a very questionable slice of cheese, a half jar of pickles, a crumpled mustard tube, and a mysterious Tupperware container. So why even try to find something he had no urge to eat anyway.
sorry, he hadn’t been good enough. He wished so much that he were. Right now more than ever; because if he’d only been better, he and Cap would still have
Peter didn’t look happy with the answer. He seemed confused, as if he couldn’t understand why Tony would leave the table like that, when he had apparently always sat there till his
Steve smiled at him in a downright heartbreaking way, ”Bucky made me feel like I was back home and I was so blinded by the feeling, that I didn’t see that the only home I have, the only home I
He tried to whisper it to himself but couldn’t bring himself to form those words, they felt weirdly heavy and
He sat at his desk for another two hours after Steve had left, overthinking their conversation, trying to find his mistake. He didn’t.
”I would sign them all, if that is what you wanted. I won’t take a penny of your money, I know you are worried about it. But I promise, I will make it all easy for you, just —” Rogers broke at the last syllable and Tony really couldn’t say why he was so sure that there were many terrible things he had to see in his life, but this man crying would take the cake, for sure.
Steve looked unbelievably tired, and hell, Tony did feel this sort of tiredness too, deep inside his bones. He felt like he was losing a war here too, and wasn’t that just his whole life in a nutshell.
“Sounds awesome. How is it?” He wanted to say it.  He wanted to say that it meant hearing your mother cry in the bathroom for an hour before she came to your room, faking a smile. It meant worrying glances from doctors, and police on the front porch every other day, because
Tony had gone through many painful things in his life. Had lived through abuse, betrayal and helplessness.
Tony didn’t sleep a wink for the next two days. He also didn’t leave his bedroom, afraid what he might meet out there. Not trusting himself to confront Natasha about it and have her confirm what he already knew deep down.
Then he just let out a huff of air, letting his shoulders fall and his head with them. That was it. Yeah, he had said that. And maybe he should’ve just stayed with this truth instead of trying to fit in a 'forever' before everything turns to shit, when he couldn’t even get a year.
“Oh, I’d never doubt you, great Mr. Stark, who just paid for one of my drawings with what will be my next 6 months rents and I hope will do that again.” Steve attempted a little bow, which caused Tony to laugh again and shake his head.
Bad enough, he avoided thinking about it so much, even more since his eating habits changed. He just didn’t need yet another thing to worry about. He buried himself in his work. If he stopped doing anything, everything would be so quiet, and he’d have nothing other to do than thinking about everything he doesn’t want to think about.
He tried to change and really make it work; in fact, he’d never before in his life worked for anything as hard as he’d strived for this. And he couldn’t just let it go. Because once it was gone, what was he ?
“What?” He answered breathless, begging every higher power that might or might not be listening to give him proof that he hadn’t just missed his chance for an easy out.
“You’re not Bucky.” Steve stood up from his desk, his hands smudged with traces of colored pens, which he got all over his blond hair when he ran his hand through it.
“Could you?” Steve asked, looking not worried about being tactless or offending Tony. He seemed generally interested with a hint of challenge.
”Is that what you picture to get off? Me getting fucked and still begging? I don’t want to ruin your fantasy, but
Rhodey drowned half of his cup of coffee in one go, before he stopped all together. As if he just froze in the middle of existing, till his mouth fell open in realization.
“I don’t know,” he tried again, staring back at the wall, counting how many pictures of the woman in front of him, together with smiling children, hung there.
”I saw Peter.” Peter looked up at him again, in question. Tony just shook his head and shot a quick grin his son’s way.
”Tony ?” Steve said in his just-Steve-tone; the tone that Tony craved so much, the tone behind the voice, something so soft and light. Tony nearly forgot that this was how Steve said his name for all the time they had been in a relationship.
. Because Tony had known okay, he knew that today was their one year anniversary, but he forgot it, too deep in research and neurological testing, and he just didn’t think about it.
If that made things better or worse was a question beyond Tony to answer but it certainly showed that Steve was a self-destructive idiot.
Bucky looked at Steve like he wanted to lay a hand on his shoulder, but his only arm was holding a snoring child to his chest, so he just nodded understandingly.
“Steve, I’m tired,” Tony sighed, suddenly feeling as if there wasn’t enough oxygen for both of them in his room.
His hair was damp and there was a bit of toothpaste on his right cheek. Rogers came walking up behind him with a wet shirt, looking a bit out of breath. Yeah, Tony totally didn’t want to ever give bath to a kid, it seemed like a lot of work.
”Papa!” The boy exclaimed and began to pounce again to which Tony startled out a cough again, before raising his head quickly, relief
“Jarvis? Is somebody upstairs right now?” Tony had struggled with it. Problems he would never admit to the others - it would only worry them and they’d see it as invitation to mother hen him — but he was scared. There was no other word to describe it then. He was downright, deep in his bones, afraid of being alone in the common rooms of the tower. He has too much struggle to tell what was real and what wasn’t as it was right now, and he didn’t want to risk it.
The crowd gathered, and Steve’s gaze swept over to Sam, who was looking somber. Tony stayed near him for comfort. Bucky, however, had decided to stay behind, watching the progression from afar with only Natasha at his side. Natasha, and about twenty UN soldiers trying not to disrupt the ceremony.
“Mister Jarvis will show you the rest of the house later,” Stane told him as they rounded a last corner before they came to a stop in front of a large, sun-filled room. When they stepped inside, Steve’s eyes briefly lingered on an old wooden desk first, then he tried and failed to take in the sheer luxury of the interior. “These will be your rooms,” Stane explained. “Tony selected them specifically. This one is called the Morning Room. We brought one of our finest desks here. It’s where Mrs. Stark used to answer her mail and file out daily orders for the staff. I hope it will suit you with… whatever it is you’re doing.”
“Tell me,” Tony pleaded suddenly, and Steve could feel his movements becoming jerky. “Tell me you love me.”
, it was all over his mind, and he couldn’t make sense of it. They were still trying to pinpoint how many people had lost their lives in those last weeks. They would all be granted a hero’s funeral when their bearings had been recovered. And yet… if you asked him, those who had survived almost suffered a worse fate. Having to deal with the fallout, having to bear all those what-ifs, all those nagging questions on where things had gone so horribly wrong.
He was standing in a foreign motel room, and it felt real. It felt so real that he was having an increasingly harder time convincing himself that his body was actually lying on a cot in a now-icy cold Italy. That he was wrapped in thick blankets, sleeping in a small tent with Bucky and his other team members. He knew that, but it didn’t make the motel room feel any less real.
. He’d only read it once but Steve’s words had burned themselves into his memory and that last line especially was on constant replay. Need him? Why should he possibly
“Only if you want to, of course. I just know that my best ideas come to me when I’m here. And I’d like the company.”
Tony drew in a deep breath and caressed his brow. “Goodnight,” he said, and then, with a much more quiet voice, “And, uh... thank you. Really.”
Trace of a smile curling her lips, Natasha petted his head affectionately. “You sure are, sweetie. Just ride it out.”
And yet, he breathed in, and stroked his thumb over whatever of Tony’s skin he could. Bucky cast him a reassuring smile from afar, and he knew, as long as he had them at his side, everything would be absolutely, positively fine.
He’d let the flames of Hell lick his insides if it meant he got more of this. More of Steve. More of that mouth whispering words against his own, of Steve’s tongue exploring his mouth, his hands mapping out Tony’s body in ways that no one had ever done before.
Tony hummed, having a vague idea what Steve was going to ask. He licked his lips, both hands slowly running up and down Steve’s thighs. He could feel the muscles underneath the silky pajama material, and it was a bit hard to focus. “And what would that be?”
Eyes still widened, Steve took a step back. And another. He looked about as shaken as Tony had ever seen him. Even all of these criminals, murderers, drug dealers and psychopaths they’d put in prison together over the years… none of them had managed to truly shake Detective Steve Rogers.
Once Tony's words registered, though, he heard himself laughing lightly. So Tony knew how to take advantage of the rules. That was good to know, too. Steve's remaining clothes were discarded easily, and he reached down to close his hand around his own erection. God, he was so hard, so ready for action, but there was still some time to go…
Dazedly, Steve heard Ultron chuckle. “We’ll see how you like this,” he said, to whom Steve didn’t know, but there was already another metal fist rushing towards him, and good God, he’d really underestimated Ultron, and this could be it, this could—
Tony exhaled a low breath, his mind going to a complete and utter stand-still. He turned the ring, dreading what the inscription on the inside would be, though the signs were already pretty damn clear.
“Okay. Just… Tony? The agency—I don’t wanna pressure you, but…” He could hear the hint of warning through the phone. “Usually, most agents would double over to support Iron Man and Captain America, but the superhero thing is actually a no-go for some. And… showing them that you can’t even make your appointments most of the time isn’t exactly giving the impression of reliability.”
The words came slowly and with difficulty. “It’s Peggy,” Steve said, his voice almost inaudible. He didn’t say anything else, and
“We tried to keep it low-key. They’d been kind of a prototype that—strictly speaking—hadn’t made it into production.”
Steve had a gut feeling that once the gates would open, it’d take a long time till they’d see the sun again.
"I didn't freak out last time," was all Steve could come up with to say as he sat up. Whatever had happened, he needed to know, and he'd face the consequences, but he still couldn't bring himself to be harsh or outright cruel towards him… despite the fact that if the knowledge they'd just shared a bed like this, however innocently, ever came out, he'd be in deep trouble. "Did we…" He waved a hand between them in a vague gesture to emphasize the question.
Tony was a whirlwind of words that kept pouring, one thought after the other, not letting Steve's still hungover brain catch up. He didn't really…
“Always try to make everybody calm down. This is not the damn time for your Asgardian Worldly Wisdom.” His hands fisted, anger subsiding in waves as he looked back at Natasha. “He was right here, wasn’t he? Right fucking here and you didn’t tell him. You know, I think there are only so many lies a person can tell before forgiveness is not listed under the options section of the How To Pretend To Be A Damn Friend guidebook, Natasha.”
of time talking, and sometime along the way, well… they’d made a plan for the next few years with the two of them splitting their time between superheroing and being… parents.
“Your memories are playing tricks on you,” she said, and her tone never wavered as she looked at him, her eyes didn’t get misty—she wasn’t the type to show her feelings, but he still saw it, the raw emotions in her green eyes, and he knew she loved him every bit as much as he loved her.
Bucky hummed, and nodded in acceptance. He put the photo back down, his eyes lingering for a second before he looked back up at Steve. “What I meant is… I knew you’d eventually find someone. Not everyone could possibly be so stupid not to see what a great guy you were.”
A wry smile spread across Tony’s lips. “Kettle, pot,” he replied, rearranging his position on the armchair and wincing with the movement. “I want you to go, Steve. I’m not kidding. There’s nothing here for you.”
For a moment he thought about ignoring the plea, hoping that what had happened was only a dream—but he knew that reality wouldn’t bend to his wishes. Extremis was gone. Just as JARVIS was. He felt it with every inch of his body, like a limb had been cut off.
There was silence settling in the room, and Steve put his forehead on the table in front of him, sighing deeply. “I should follow, right?” he asked quietly.
Weirdly enough, Thor hadn’t even protested. They’d talked about the Mind Stone in Loki’s scepter and Thor had agreed that they needed to keep it safe as much as possible. And Vision was their best option to do just that.
“No,” Steve said firmly. “Not right now.” And with that, he turned and headed for the farm house, leaving Tony staring after him.
The conversation with Fury sat heavy on his mind. He had turned up sometime before dinner, basically telling everyone to get their asses out of the gutter and back in the game. Steve hadn’t missed the pointed look he’d given both Steve and Tony, just as he hadn’t missed the quiet talk Fury had had with Tony in the back of the living room afterwards.
wanted to punch him in his foreign face. “I bet they’ll want to know where you stand by then. Coulson has been meeting with Rosalind Price. She was head of the ATCU, so I suggest you’ll call him, rather sooner than later. Things are moving fast, gentlemen.”
“Don’t you think someone would’ve said something about this?” Clint asked, shining his flashlight around to investigate as they descended the stairs. “I mean, this seems like something someone should’ve said something about.”
God, it would have been so much easier if he could just hate him for what had happened. But he couldn’t.
Stane might've said about him, but as soon as he turned his attack on Tony, there was really no way around it. He moved fast, and soon had two fist-fulls of Stane's collar in his hands, and he pulled him close, away from Tony. He maneuvered them around to keep Stane from gathering his wits until he had him pressed firmly against the workbench.
“She didn’t,” Rhodey agreed, then shook his head in confusion. “Don’t even know man, there was beer pong, and then nothing.”
It took Tony a moment for the meaning behind his words to sink in, but when they did, he groaned. “Too many hospitals lately,” he muttered hoarsely, then winced when he tried to move up.
Next to Steve, Tony took the flash drive out of his pocket, putting it into the port. Immediately, the computer around him sprang to life. On the screen in front of him, a single line of text appeared.
Tony heaved a breath and stood up, pacing back and forth. Steve knew he had stationed a Quinjet there.
If Steve was going to ‘the’ bar while Tony was away on business meetings, and didn’t tell him, maybe he, he...
“I have condoms,” Tony ventured hastily, “but I can’t catch any diseases, and…” He smiled and leaned down, nipping at Steve’s lower lip before brushing his mouth along his ear. “I want you to mess me up as best as you can.”
“Not drunk.” Oh Jesus, Tony was reaching for the fastening on his own jeans now. “There’s lube, I bought lube… I have it… somewhere.”
"Three hours, enough air, candle light and radio silence? How's that for a date?" He murmured, lips brushing over Tony's smooth skin.
They were standing in front of the guest suite that Steve usually occupied whenever he visited Tony in New York. Fingers entwined, they leaned into each other, with Tony standing on his toes so he could occasionally press little kisses to Steve’s mouth. The debate about sleeping arrangements had accompanied them for the better part of those last weeks, and they had spent a few hours dozing off on the couch while being wrapped around each other, but that was all. No sleeping together, in no way whatsoever.
That couldn’t be good, Steve thought with a distressed look at Tony’s eyes. He had a feeling that Tony was downplaying this a whole lot and couldn’t be bothered to hold back his worry. Tony was steadily
She released him for a moment, but only to position herself above him. He hooked his hand behind one of her knees and lifted her up to wrap her legs further up around his waist. When she’d settled, he poised himself at her entrance and right as he was about to plunge himself inside her, someone pounded on the door.
He supposed there were a lot of things that others would deem heroic, but Tony had never shared their sentiments. Not truly. He’d never felt like a hero. Never felt like someone for others to look up to.
been prepared for that, but between regrouping, getting information on the Maximoff twins, making rough plans,
The world really did end the next day. Or at least Thanos tried to make it happen with everything he had. And what he had was a huge army of alien-soldiers, a bunch of giant alien-ships, a few alien-children with a temper problem and the rest of his crazy Black Order, one fighter deadlier than the other.
.” He made an unpleasant face. “We call that the ‘week of sin’, by the way, none of us wanted to be anywhere near you for days. I think Clint even moved to a motel.”
All of them were rich—not as rich as Tony—but Steve soon realized this was indeed America’s high society walking in and out of Stark Mansion.
“I don’t wanna see you hurt,” Tony said softly. “Don’t get me wrong, I’d do anything to get Steve and the others out, but if you attack Ross’ men, I—”
Tony smiled, at seemingly nothing in particular. His once meticulously groomed goatee was now fraying at the edges, making him look somewhat less intimidating. “You, too, Cap,” he said quietly.
There was a minute’s consideration, visible in the way the suits slowed down, but didn’t stop right away.
“Why not?” Bucky asked and pointed his thumb at Steve and Carol. “I don’t care. You’re gay. They’re bi. Whatever.”
Tony saw one of Steve’s hands slide between his legs, and squeezed his ass in command. Steve huffed, exasperated, but dropped his arm, anyway. “Hurry up, then,” he ground out, not even trying to hide his annoyance, then began to shove back on Tony’s fingers with impatient movements. He was bracing one hand against the backrest, the other curled around the side frame as he took Tony’s fingers, thighs starting to tremble after a while.
In just a few days, Tony was looking and feeling much better. The dark circles had started disappearing and he was actually looking forward to spending time with everyone. Hill had been a great help over the past couple of days, really pitching in to step in with the Committee hearings, while not giving him a hard time when things didn’t go the way she wanted. Which, truth be told, she’d been known to do so far.
On the right side of her face, Steve could see a few very colorful bruises. Her throat was red and Steve could see the vague traces of a handprint.
The Stones were vanishing, one after the other, but all of a sudden, there was an odd vibration in the air.
“Here,” Steve said. When Tony looked up, he saw Steve walking to his desk, reaching under the surface and pulling the watch out of a small drawer, as if he’d done so a million times.
Bruce closed his eyes briefly and paused to gather his bearings. “He’ll retain his free will. That’s—”
Steve had his best friend back, and one day Barnes would accept him back in his life, and they could all go back to normal. Tony could go back to actually having a husband—and regular sex—and cuddles in the morning—and
“You know why, James,” she said a minute later, as always able to read exactly what was going through his mind. “You know why he does it.”
“Remember,” Strange said behind him. “These are just temporal possibilities. Time, like threads, always forms its patterns. Any weave can be unraveled and woven again, so if you unravel it, you’ll have to weave it differently.”
Steve didn't have FRIDAY to tell him the odds and the statistics. He counted on his perception and his gut feeling. He'd very rarely been wrong in his assessments, but preferred to not bring that up. He wasn't too keen on fighting, either, and Tony was proving… less difficult to deal with, in a sense. Steve could feel it, if not for what he said then for his gestures. Tony's hands on his face, his gentle demeanour, were all quite pleasant.
“Let me decide on that,” Steve said, and rolled around until he settled on top of Tony. He was painfully aware that they should be doing some clean-up, but this was more important.
Steve smiled widely. “Yeah.” After a moment, however, the edge of humor dissipated and a frowned took hold of Steve’s face. “So, uh,” he said lowly, voice degrees graver than before, and Tony instantly felt a shadow subduing his happiness.
It had been a while since Tony had even thought about sex. After the disastrous popping of his cherry with Ty last year, Tony had all but decided he might like guys, but he didn’t like guy-sex. Ty had used about no time at all for prep, only using about two minutes on stretching him and only a minimal amount of lube, and Tony, being the idiot he was, hadn’t asked him for further ministrations. He’d done some readings on the matter and knew it could hurt at first, he’d just not imagined it to hurt this much. He hadn’t been able to walk without a hitch for days, and while the thing with Ty hadn’t lasted, Tony had decided that blowjobs he could do, frotting—perfect, but there wouldn’t be a dick in his ass ever again.
“Tony, don’t…” Steve pleaded, knowing exactly what was happening, as he tried to get back on his feet with visible strain. “We need to get him out of here, we need…” Steve coughed, staggering for a second, and Tony turned around to really look at him, checking him for wounds, for anything, when—
They were quiet for a long moment, and Steve was just about to say something, when Tony whispered hoarsely, “You’ll be missed, Pegs.”
to fuse together. As though once they understood that there was no motive for fighting anymore, they might as well do this instead. Just a different sort of battle—it seemed they couldn’t stop battling each other if they tried.
“Counting on it,” Tony grunted and his eyes fell shut as Steve’s thrusts grew harder. He’d never even softened, not for a second. Instead, he was really pumping himself into Tony now. His chest was pressed against Tony’s chest and his mouth was slotted against Tony’s neck, probably decorating him with a handful of hickeys.
, so to speak, but it’s… it’s a bit like trying to take JARVIS down while he fights you tooth and nail. It’s not easy in the first place—only I haven’t programmed this AI myself, which makes it a shitload harder.”
Tony was hugging Steve, and while the power of his excitement still had him trembling, he regained some form of calmness.
“Don’t worry,” Steve assured him earnestly. “I’m with you. The last thing I want is to let you down.”
He settled his hands on Tony’s back, letting his fingertips wander downwards ever so slightly. He could feel the firmness of Tony’s muscles beneath that fancy shirt; he could feel his heat and smell the scent of his skin.
“Great! You better put on your tightest pants, honey,” Tony instructed cheekily as he walked back towards their bedroom. He was swaying ridiculously from side to side with Ian on his arms, and Steve couldn’t hold back a laugh as he watched them go. “I’m going to take your papa out and show him off, baby,” he told Ian. “What do you say about that? Can you say
Steve twirled the USB stick around between his fingers, frowning at the SHIELD symbol. Maybe it wasn’t fair to be so angry at an inanimate object, and maybe it was childish to want to toss it outside of the van and watch it smash to smithereens. It sure as hell was irrational thinking that none of this would’ve happened if Natasha hadn’t retrieved the data. He couldn’t help it, however, and knew he had to focus his anger on the task at hand.
Steve didn’t know any motel that was called ‘Four Seasons’, but he was very sure this wasn’t the same rundown motel he’d gone to bed in.
He moaned when Steve put a hand on his ass, and one on his shoulders, and pushed him on his back, with Steve lying on top of him. Once they were settled, his eyes softened and he brushed his lips against Steve’s. “Okay, now move with me,” he whispered, and started to roll his lips up and against Steve.
There was a dim, while not quite black sky, similar to a late twilight, with a jet-black dot in the sky, surrounding by a glowing radiance. The corona moved. Tony could see it flow in and out slightly, as if it was alive.
"Would I be asking if I did?" Steve countered, finally sipping his own coffee. It wasn't tasty, but that's what they served here, so he just drank on.
“Sure is,” Sam agreed. “For the, you know, ‘enhanced people’. Not the mere humans. I won’t touch that stuff with a pole, I’ll only make fun of Steve once he does.”
"Us. This. This thing we're doing," Steve said into Tony's skin. "I thought you were saying you regretted hooking up and…" he paused, contemplating if he should be so direct about it. Well, it would give Tony some example for how things tended to be for normal people who communicated, wouldn't it. "And letting it get… serious."
He hadn’t even wanted to go to any of the pre-graduation parties, and those were usually the big highlights of every semester. Free alcohol, free make-out sessions and a happy ending at the end of the night, if you played your cards right.
She bent down to grab her jacket. “Hey, but there’s one benefit,” she called over on her way out of the gym. “You get to meet Stark. That’s something even he can’t ignore. So maybe you can ask him yourself why he won’t be of help.”
That was it, then. With a deep breath meant to support his confidence, Steve clenched his hands to fists and walked forward.
“Uh-uh, Captain Super-Secretive,” Tony commented with a frown. Steve’s smile had turned a little sheepish and that was… odd, especially now. He was about to press for an answer, when the lights inside the Quinjet switched from red to green, indicating their arrival.
“Who’s J?” Steve asked, though he had a feeling Tony wouldn’t be the kind of guy to share his feelings. And he was right, his expression closed off immediately.
Steve whistled to get Natasha’s attention, motioning her that he was going in as well. She was heading in Clint’s direction, and gave him a thumb’s up. As he contemplated the best route to the roof, Sam and Thor followed Natasha to fight off the rest of HYDRA’s forces.
He didn’t have much cash on him; and tracking his credit cards would be far too easy for people like Ross. Or Tony, if they forced his hand. And they
Natasha looked up from where she was kneeling on Clint’s left side, and only then did Steve spot the blood on the snowy ground beneath him. “It’s a non-fatal injury,” she hurried to explain, her hand pressing down on the wound, “but we should get him to Cho asap.”
Tony sighed, heavy and loud, showing Steve exactly what he thought of his needling. He did reach behind himself, however, and produced his tablet out of nowhere. He flipped through whatever apps he had running and eventually threw the tablet on the mattress so Steve could reach for it.
“Just because you aren’t a threat to me doesn’t mean I’m bored,” Steve tried. “There’s no point getting out of shape while we’re here. Who knows how long the team will take to find us.”
“Tell me Captain, do you know where Thor is right now? Can you guarantee that James Barnes won’t have another lapse with those implants in his head? If I misplaced a couple of 30 mega tonne nukes, you can bet there’d be consequences.” There was a heavy pause as he glanced around. “Compromise. Reassurance. That’s how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.”
At that, Natasha and Steve exchanged a long, meaningful glance before simultaneously imploding in a sea of amused chuckles.
He had wanted to meet Howard’s son, either way—even though he’d initially worried a bit that his efforts to find Steve would come with certain demands. But so far, he had never even showed up here, so Steve had likely been wrong about that.
"Didn’t know you’re such a quitter…" Steve said against his neck teasingly before pulling back to look at him.
Everything was exactly the same: The huge bed, the window front, and the silken sheets. The rug, the night stands, the bed lamps,
Maybe after the gala, they could find some time for themselves, and then Tony would break the news to Steve, and hope they could find a solution together.
As they drove towards Hopkinsville, the midday-bustle on the street had already begun. Soon enough, Steve realized quickly that they were only a small part of people, all driving towards Hopkinsville and all bound in a single emotion of expectation and excitement. Steve could almost smell the eclipse fervor in the air. Some people even wished them a ‘Happy Eclipse’ as they drove past them, a few even waving banners. People were clutching cameras all set to glue the moment to memory.
Steve hummed, moving closer to him. He buried his face in the crook between Tony’s neck and shoulder, breathing in deep.
Barnes sighed, his tone uncharacteristically serious. “You’re good together, Stark. At least  when you grace him with your presence. Just don’t wanna see the two of you hurt. So stop with the secretive bullshit and talk to the guy.”
Tony’s smile broadened and he kissed Steve, deep and long. He reached for the bed sheet that was tugged around Steve and pulled, leaving him naked to his eyes once more. He kissed his way down Steve’s chest, pausing at his nipples briefly to lick them, and then—to Steve’s absolute shock—he trailed further south.
”What would you know about being an adult? You don’t pay rent, you live off of my money and you are like
Steve had looked so happy when he had finally spent time with Peter, but how couldn’t he see? How could he be so blind, that he’d be happy to see Tony talking to his son?
his damn issue was. Before he could even answer, though, did the boy chime in, putting his chin on the man’s shoulder and then pointing at Tony with a strangely familiar smug expression.
There had to be a moment he couldn’t pinpoint, when he started to look at butter but then decided to eat his piece of bread just like it was, because he couldn’t help himself but feel really uneasy just looking at it; but he couldn’t recall when it was. It must’ve been months since his coffee turned blacker, long enough for it to not even taste bitter for him anymore.
him this time, but in the same urge he just wanted to crawl back into those arms and never let go again. It was confusing as hell and Tony was still
Tony took a deep breath, resting his chin on Peter’s head, before speaking up, breaking his safety blanket that the silence had built.
“Yeah, sure.” Steve raised an eyebrow and walked one step closer to him, “Because you never knew anything else. I’m right, aren’t I? You never felt one positive thing in your life, did you?”
”Please,” Rogers answered, the word had a weight to it that made it seem impossibly heavy and important. Tony was about to make a cheap line about begging, before biting his lip and nodding.
”Okay, damn,” Tony said, annoyance clear in his voice, even if he didn’t want it. He wanted his emotions just as hidden because what Rogers could do, he could do twice as good. He was sure of it. He had to smile for cameras ever since he was 5 fucking years old, he could convince a stranger that he didn’t feel utterly annoyed by his misery.
right through it, because he accepted it as an answer with a little smile before getting up after patting Tony on the shoulder one more time.
Bucky nodded, smiling again while getting up. ”What did you remember? The dirty stuff?” He said lightly, while putting his glass into the dishwasher.
Steve just didn’t seem to understand that ever since Tony had the chance to yell at him for all he’s worth, everything else just seemed numb. He’s said all he needed to say to Steve back then and now everything he did was empty and felt unimportant and all that’s left was the constant need to tell Steve that he was so
The name was still like a bitter pill in his mouth, but Bucky’d asked him with a quite heartbreaking expression to
“You are human. The mistakes you made while not feeling anything do not change that. That you weren’t able to feel does not change that either. You are worth so much more than you know. You live your life in anger and hate and sadness, I can see it all over your face, but you deserve so much more. You deserve to be happy, too. You deserve to love something and not just
Then again being sad really began to make him question his sanity. He didn’t want to leave his bed, he cried a lot, he wished he could call Steve but couldn’t and he just felt tired all the time.
Nothing else changed really, but Natasha seemed to warm up some more again since Bruce came back as well and she even talked to Tony shortly. Just enough to make sure that they weren’t enemies. What didn’t mean they were friends, though, that’s why he was even more surprised when Natasha walked into his workshop as if she owned the place. Tony found the instant need to grab something to protect himself and look for ways how he could escape if he needed to.
“Cheers to that,” Rhodey mockingly raised his hand as if he was doing a toast with a glass, before he settled it back in Tony’s shin, “But it’s also great, mostly. Like when you can spend time with that person you feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside and — I don’t even know, man, it’s weird.”
”I love you,” Tony said to that without missing a beat. Three words and they still felt way too big for this small room.
And frankly, he was still somewhat afraid of what she might do to him. She was an assassin after all and he felt weaker than ever.
Tony took another deep breath, steadying himself on his closet. What was he supposed to fucking do now!
They sat in comfortable silence for a bit longer, till Steve’s expression turned serious again. ”So, you can remember more?”
Living with the team was easy — or at least easier than he expected. He got along well with them once they got over the first few awkward conversations and guilt-fueled, half-hearted apologies, that rung in Tony’s head over and over again. He was so done with lies and he could just see that those apologies were everything but 100% from the heart.
He just came to a stop though, when he realized that he wasn’t in some apartment. He was in a hospital, with yellowed ceiling, heart monitor and pictures of bouquets on the walls and everything.
Tony exclaimed, only hearing distinctly how his heart monitor shot up a beat and the doctor taking a note, before walking closer to him, talking in a soft voice. ”There is a ring. Rhodes!”
Rogers nodded, though, obviously understanding his son without further questions. He turned around and got fruit loops from the kitchen shelf, filling some in Peter’s bowl.
Sam’s grin was easy, his eyes flashed excitedly when he saw Tony enter the kitchen. And hell, didn’t Tony wish to always be as carefree as Wilson seemed to be.
Steve’s whole posture collapsed; he seemed smaller, as if he had just lost any hope for this conversation ending in his ideal way, whatever that had been.
, for God’s sake, his insulin level was practically nonexistent, his heart had been damaged even before all this and only getting worse every second. His hair was getting thinner, his nails bluer, he’s got constant bruises
Tony stumbled into his room, breathing hard, trying to keep his balance. He didn’t know anything about kids. Nothing. He didn’t know how to talk with them, how to take care of them, how to play with them. He didn’t know what he was supposed to do.
His voice sounded so tiny and broken that Tony was about to fight heaven and earth if it meant making all the pain go away.
”What were you playing with, Peter?” Tony asked, his voice sounding weirdly thin and freaked out, but Peter only giggled and took Tony’s hand, dragging him over to the couch, where he pointed him to sit down, already holding a bright red car directly in front of his eyes.
Fear was not like being startled but worse. Well, it was in some way, but the second Tony took the head piece off and looked around he was weighted down by it all. He practically fell out of his chair and mustered the work shop as if he’d never seen it before.
Tony tapped an uneven rhythm on his chest and then startled out of it, when his fingers hit something hard. Confused did he pull out the chain around his neck, pulling his eyebrows down.
Tony rather spent the whole day alone on the couch, after Rogers had told him that he’d have to work a bit on a painting and that Tony shouldn’t hesitate to call, if he needed anything.
“Huh?” He just stated, knowing that Steve good enough to know, that his expression meant, that he couldn’t keep his thoughts quiet for long.
day, but it doesn’t feel like I did when I am around you. You make my life less shitty, you’re the reason I haven’t gone insane yet. You make me want to get up and
Rhodey hadn’t seemed to mind his behaviour when he had actually been 27, but now he just looked at Tony like he was missing something magnificent and when he had asked him about it, all he did was shake his head and pat his back as if this would make anything easier.
”Yeah, well, kid,” Tony said slowly, while watching Rogers getting up and cleaning the table. Bucky, though, stayed seated and looked at Tony with a serious expression. He always looked easy and relaxed when he was talking to Peter, keeping his voice light and funny. His gaze right now wasn’t light, though. It was heavy with a clear warning. Tony should watch his mouth, calculate what he would tell the kid.
”Earlier, you meant,” Tony started, walking back into the living room, closer to Steve. ”If I was going to go out and hook up with someone, didn’t you?”
“Jarvis,” his voice sounded as if he’d just eaten sandpaper for months; he swallowed dryly 3 times and licked over his lips, ignoring his booming headache and took a deep breath, ”For goodness’ sake, turn the sun down.”
But then he blacked out. He had blacked out all the time, since he didn’t lie down to sleep anymore, but this was different. He felt his whole body shutting down, felt his urge to
Tony threw a laugh back at him, before Peter grabbed his hand and all but pulled him out of the kitchen.
Then Tony looked up, locking eyes with Steve, who had looked up from his drawing pad. His eyes glowed brightly, holding an undertone of something so deeply hopeful, making Tony painfully aware how dead they had looked before. He nodded encouragingly before
He realised that they didn’t just have a routine when it came to the important stuff. They had a well played routine for everything and apparently
”Yes!” Peter exclaimed, jumping up and down, obviously not catching up that his Daddy had no idea how that was exciting.
He was about to book tickets planning to fly about anywhere, when he sat back against the headboard heavily.
Tony nodded seriously, like he was considering the kid's words and then stood up so slowly that he could swear Peter was about to burst from his impatience.
Rhodey raised his eyebrows and looked at Tony with a mischievous but also very honest grin. Tony was suddenly really happy that he had kept Rhodey around all those years ago even though it was out of pure practicality.
When he stood in front of about 25 reporters, he tried to understand why he still was hiding. His father had worked hard to keep it all under covers, but he was literally 8 foot deep under the surface of the earth now, he didn’t have a say in anything anymore.
“Well, I don’t hate it,” Tony said after a while, as honest as he could. He didn’t feel dislike or disgust while looking at it, which was as far he ever came to liking something. It also made him feel lonely, but nearly everything did. He shivered thinking how huge his house was and he was all by himself, all the time. Maybe was this picture exactly what he needed, another thing to focus on, instead of walking around aimlessly, trying to picture how his life would be, if he had been normal from the beginning.
He turned and faced Steve fully, banning every emotion that wasn't casual out of his expression and went for a pressed smile instead. His best defense was after all still attack.
Rogers ruffled his son’s hair and filled orange juice in his cup, giving it to Peter who extended his hands greedily.
, but he didn’t want to hear the answer really. He couldn’t stand to listen to Jarvis telling him just how much all the recent events affected him and how
“You’re not blacking out on me, are you?” Clint walked a few steps closer but kept his respectful distance, not coming too close to Tony.
Maybe that made it sadder, even. Because Tony had actually really just wanted to try. He wanted to do something good.
Not Clint, who grinned at him just as teasing as Sam. Not Natasha, who didn’t keep her head down really, just avoided his eyes as if they were powerful lasers. Not Bucky, who had quite an impressive bed head, but awake and attentive eyes, scanning his surroundings purposefully, like the trained soldier he was; even though there was a little upturn playing around the corners of his lips, as if he was excited and pleased by Clint, Sam and Tony making fun of each other constantly. And of course, who especially mustn’t know through just how much pain Tony really went in his life. Especially not the only one who knew a hell of a lot of it —Steve, sitting to Bucky’s left, gaze burning through Tony’s skin.
He knocked two times, till he heard a, “This better be important, jerk.” Which he took as a 'welcome in'.
There was really only one thing that Steve could look so uncertain about right now. Looking like he didn’t want to overstep some line he had drawn for Tony.
Well, part of him wanted to tell him. Right then and there, but he couldn't. And his silences may be the cruelest lie he's ever told.
Tony only heard a murmur on the other end and another laugh, which softened Steve’s expression. ”Listen to me, jerk. I don’t care if you only have one arm — what do you - it doesn’t have to be a fair fight. You deserve to have your ass kicked when you buy my son a dog.”
Tony sat down next to Peter heavily, pointing at the number and then just continued to stare at Steve like he had just teleported himself into the kitchen from another planet.
”I’m sorry, Pete,” Steve said slowly, crossing his hands in front of the child’s belly, hugging him to his chest and burring his nose in the boy’s hair, closing his eyes for a second. ”Daddy isn’t feeling so good right now, but he will come back home with us tomorrow.”
He already knew deep down that it would be anything but easy, though. Stubborn Steve, who really had a point.
Steve lived in a little apartment complex just outside of the center of the city. Tony looked around and made sure he locked his car, twice.
“Yeah, with great teeth too, but I don’t show them around weirdly as if every passing stranger is my dentist. And by the way, my father called me
Tony swore he could still hear the ringing of that ‘I Do’ in his head, giving him more comfort than it had any right to.
This kid would grow up to hate Tony and have like major daddy issues and the only one who seemed to realise that right now was he himself.
Yeah it had been weeks since he’s been released from the hospital and all his action was limited to his own hands, but still, he hadn’t even thought about going out to get laid.
He hoped it didn’t surprise Steve as much as it surprised himself. He didn’t know why he still had the feeling as if he had to prove himself to Steve, even though he had just looked at Tony and Peter together as if his world had just found its balance again.
He had done everything to make sure that he’d live his life exactly like he deserved it, alone but heavily partying. He did never mean to pull other people into this and also — what were the chances. The chances that his life had made a 180 turn and he had ended up with a future that was the polar opposite of how he had pictured it?
”Tony,” his voice had a completely different tone behind it now. It sounded husky and rushed, as if Rogers tried to get as many words as he could out there, before Tony vanished or something. ”I’d sign the papers. Everything. I know you don’t trust me, but I would make it easy for you, I promise.”
”No, I wanna hug Daddy!” The kid whined and Tony was about to try to suffocate himself with a pillow. He couldn’t stand this whining. It caused him a headache he really didn’t need right now.
Tony screwed his nose up and tried to lift his arms to get that boy off him but couldn’t even raise his arms a centimetre without groaning in pain.
And this was the story of how he ended up, curled on the floor of his work shop, tears on his face, hands over his heart, shaking and sobbing. It hurt, everything hurt so
They made a beeline for the bar soon after. Steve ordered a whiskey and drank it down with a firm, unhappy grimace. He hated alcohol, but he needed something to help him not think about… certain…
Steve’s eyes found his again. Soft. Meaningful. And he kissed Tony with such tenderness that he both wanted to urge him on, make him go faster, but also to keep things slow so he could enjoy every goddamn second of it.
“Pointless,” Strange said. “Thanos took the power of the Infinity Stones with him. The Gauntlet is still linked to his essence, but by now, he took all its power with him. The only one who’s able to stop all this is Thanos himself.”
Steve eyed him warily—took a step closer. “Yeah, I want that,” he said, “even after you went all day-time soap opera on me with the big slamming door.”
was his future, Steve and Ian and his team, and that he’d be happy and have a family and be very loved.
Where did that come from? Steve shook his head and, dropping the pen on the counter, tried to reach for him. "What's gotten into you?"
Suddenly, Tony had Steve’s face captured between his hands, and pressed his mouth to his. “We do,” he agreed heatedly.
Tony snorted as he punched Steve’s shoulder. Then, he walked back around the kitchen counter and pointed to the raw turkey. “Should we get that thing in the oven now?”
Steve’s cock disappeared and reappeared in a blur, driving him completely crazy. He thrust, and shoved and swirled inside him, hitting his sweet spot with precision. Every. Single. Time.
The streets of Lagos were still busy around them, with people everywhere. Rumlow had, intentionally or not, chosen a time for his attack when people were just getting off work and some were just starting. It had taken over two hours of supervising the area before they’d realized what was about to happen. The rest of the team was scattered all over the city. Wanda and Pietro had done well, so far, with Pietro hunting down most of Rumlow’s goons on his own.
At the mentioning of JARVIS’ name, Steve had a somewhat bizarre sensation. And he knew without the shadow of a doubt that Tony would be experiencing it too. Before, JARVIS would’ve never skipped a mentioning of his name without chiming in some sort of input. Especially when the opportunity to tease Tony came up.
“I don’t think so,” Steve said, leaning up on his elbows and gazing down at Tony with a soft smile. “What you’ve done, the
He swallowed hard. The witty parts of his brain had clearly abandoned him. “I know I’m a bit younger than you,” he admitted helplessly. “But no one has to know right? You're not
Natasha held his gaze for a few seconds before breaking eye contact. A small silence fell between them, and it felt different. It felt like an acknowledgement that everything was about to change. “There’s always gonna be a part of me I can’t share with you.”
There was some universal law about popular people like Steve making the lives of non-popular people like Tony hell. And he couldn’t even blame Steve. At the end of the day, this was all Tony’s fault. He’d fucked up their friendship by putting Steve in an awkward position.
“My beautiful boy, you’ve gotten so big,” Steve murmured, kissing Ian again, and Tony could’ve stood there forever, just watching them.
That didn’t sound like much of a fond memory, but somehow, Pepper’s expression and the gentleness in her voice made it seem like one. And Steve could imagine it so easily, how Tony had passionately worked on his projects for hours and hours on end, determined to bring to life whatever his mind had come up with in theory.
Before he could fully comprehend how they’d gotten here, he was already stretching Tony, slicked fingers moving deep inside his body. They lay next to each other with Steve half on top of Tony, kissing along his neck and shoulder as he prepped him. And being so near him—it felt both surreal and strangely like reaching the end of a long and lonesome road. Tony was panting and muttering all kinds of words as he rocked back into the sensation and Steve was utterly entranced by the sight of him—spread out and debauched for his eyes only.
Feeling Tony's desperation in more than one sense, Steve responded to his request with a quickening of the pace and deeper thrusts—not much of either, just enough. He let his skimming fingers finally take hold of Tony's cock, stroking him in time with their motions as best as he could.
“You’re crazy, you know that?” Tony called after him. He stood on the bank, looking at Steve with the beginning of a laugh on his lips.
“Well, you sure make the age gap seem like a non-issue,” Betty observed, smiling at them warmly. Tony was pretty sure that Bruce had told her exactly when and how he and Steve had met and fallen in love, but he also knew she wouldn’t say anything about it.
Names hadn't been important for a long while, but for whatever reason it seemed important now. He knew that face, and it tried to reconnect in his brain, but the timeframe he’d been given was so small that he couldn’t linger. He flexed his fingers, then pulled the trigger, once, twice.
“You know he could be a real dick about this, right? Obi’s… not a bad guy. He’s just, I don’t know, conservative as fuck, a real hardliner. He doesn’t really know I’m into guys, so don’t take it personally when he’s throwing a fit. He’ll get over it.”
she’d been winking at him—before she reached for a small, aged photograph on the coffee table. She pulled it close to her chest so Steve wouldn’t be able to look at it. “My grandson found this in the library. I think I once stole it from Howard.”
There was… so much to do. The city was a mess, and while the Maria Stark Foundation and numerous other charity foundations and private donors had given plenty of money, it would take a lot of time and work to restore New York to its former glory.
They were sweaty and distinctively glued together in the middle, but Steve couldn’t be bothered by any of it, so instead of moving, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s middle, hands on his head, kissing his eyes and then the corner of his gasping mouth.
“Maybe,” Steve conceded. “But whenever he’s smiling, he’s all you.” He reached out and traced a laughter line next to Tony’s mouth. “It’s a little crooked, and it lights up his whole face. ‘s beautiful. Like you.”
He felt the shield Howard Stark had given him resting safely on his back, as he let his gaze sweep over the mountains before him. He felt determination settle inside him like a long forgotten dream and he knew, even if this might be his last battle, he’d give it his all.
“While you’re at the whole sharing-your-feelings thing, which—honestly—is freaking me out a bit… maybe it’s time to lay a few more cards on the table,” Tony said. Since he’d strapped himself to that machine, he’d been awfully quiet, not meeting either of their gazes—not even Steve’s. He seemed conflicted, and up until now, Steve had figured it was because of what he’d seen about Project Insight, but now he wasn’t so sure anymore.
The machine’s humming grew louder, joined by a sharp, high-pitched keening sound, and there was a sudden flash of light that made Steve screw his eyelids together and bite down on his lip—
Strangely, Bucky only lowered his gaze to his coffee, staying quiet for a moment, before he cleared his throat. "It's… not going so well for me," he said, then told him how he'd been released from the hospital, how the military discharged him with nothing to his name but a purple heart decoration. Steve kept nodding his head as he heard how Bucky couldn't get a job, and how he didn't do well enough in his SATs to get into college.
"What?" Steve wasn't sure he was even following Tony's line of thought. "What are you talking about?"
Steve sucked in a breath and moaned Tony’s name aloud, his hips arching off the bed and right against Tony’s groin.
“Ultron,” Bruce suddenly exclaimed, his eyes twitching in Tony’s direction. Tony glanced at him for a moment of mutual understanding, then stared back at the robot.
“Thanks.” He knew how hard it was for Natasha not to come with him right now. He turned to Tony. “Stay safe.”
And no matter what, keeping his secret became harder by the day. Especially since he had the feeling that Steve—and Natasha, probably—were getting suspicious. They likely didn’t know
The man, a blond guy with nice-enough features, cast him a smile that rang just a little bit strained. He shook his hand with a strong grip. “Don’t worry about it.” He closed his mouth, his eyes wandering intensely over Tony’s face, before he cleared his throat. “Hope he isn’t sick?”
There was another long beat of silence, before Rhodey said, “So, how do you like life at Stark Mansion?”
Steve’s jaw tightened as he held his gaze. “Won’t let you die. You don’t get to breeze into my life and shake up my whole world view and then just leave like this.” He shook his head as he tied the sleeve tightly around him. “I don’t care what’s going on with you, and what you’re keeping from me—You don’t get to die like this.”
And the fact that Steve apparently hadn’t told anyone so far didn’t change that being around him would be flat out horrible. It was the apocalypse. The Four Horsemen. A shower of frogs. Burning lakes of fire. It was—
And still. Steve trusted him to do what was right. And this time, he figured, whatever was needed to save the world had to be it.
Steve only grunted, grinding his erection against Tony’s abdomen and tucking his dress shirt out of his pants.
And just as it had started, the hallucination was gone, and Steve was back in the Avengers Tower common room, with everyone where they had been sitting before, but at least half of the team was staring at him instead of the TV, and Steve, still panting, reeling from the experience, leaned forward, cupping his face in his hands.
felt definitely real. Before Steve could stop himself, a moan tore from his throat, slightly muffled, but loud enough for Tony to notice.
It certainly was a nice thought. That way, he could just call the others, let them know that he was fine and that he’d meet them back in Manhattan and…
Steve stopped, but made sure not to let his uncertainty show. “I’ll not let you order me around,” he retorted, crossing his arms, his body wound tighter than Steve had ever remembered.
When Tony finally opened the door, Steve held his breath, taking a first step into the large room that lay behind it.
Maybe Tony already was in a relationship? Maybe he had a girl at home, or even a family, and these dreams were just a little adventure for him.
Tony’s calm expression began to fall. There was open sorrow in his gaze now that had Steve’s insides tremble with confusion. Were their opinions really that different and he just hadn’t noticed?
The night truly was a perfect archetype for ultimate realization. As the rain washed the old world away, cleansing the earth of the many robots, Tony hovered in steady acceptance. The chaos he’d inflicted was everywhere around him. The horror and losses, the pain he’d caused so many had officially come full circle.
stopped when he saw Tony naked. Naked and giving the kind of feline stretch that looked effortlessly natural but could be an act all the same. The mental slow down that accommodated the time it took Steve to really take in the sight, marking down every inch he wanted to kiss and tease and taste, was the only reason he didn't move to get out of the rest of his clothes right away.
He had never been asked this before, and it was by sheer willpower that he didn’t go for an emotional retreat then and there. Only that when Tony opened his eyes again, Steve was still looking at him in question, and Tony was determined not to let his fears of intimacy rule him. Not with every inch of him doused in pleasure.
. He saw things he forgot had happened… Like a door unlocking in his mind: torture, slaughter, and training others in their use. So much
“You’ll come up with something else later. It’s… it’s amazing, sweetheart, it really is.” The following kiss lingered and that Steve’s hand travelled down and landed on the curve of Tony’s ass was in no way accidental.
Natasha nodded, eyes strangely sullen. There was more to this. That much was clear. For once, Natasha’s demeanor couldn’t be any more obvious. Her expression reminded him of the looks that had always colored the expression of homecoming soldiers. Natasha was coming home from a war still embedded in her mind. It was subtle enough to remain disregarded, but there for those who looked.
Tony let loose a shaking breath. Hearing those words from Steve—it was more than he’d ever expected to get. “I know,” he whispered. “It’s okay. As I said, I forgave you a long time ago, but… thank you. For telling me.”
It was slow. The teachers were simply not interested in quelling their boredom anymore. Which was fine except for times like now. With the upcoming road trip hanging above Tony’s head like a guillotine, he could use an excuse to get distracted without the added bonus of consequences.
He nodded at the deep broken lash in Ultron’s body, at the cables falling out. “You’re stuck in this outdated metal casing. The big Ultron isn’t quite as memorable as he’d like to be… You’re just an enormous egomaniac with an inferiority complex that’s almost as funny as your sense of entitlement to everything this world has to offer.”
. This was where he belonged. Where Tony belonged, too. In Steve’s arms, his hands hooked behind his neck, his face tilted upward in anticipation of his kiss.
Steve reached to caress over Tony's wrist at his waist, his fingers light against Tony's skin. He hummed his understanding, then leaned a little back.
him. But he hadn’t wanted to, and that meant this wasn’t the time to swoon, or to wonder how Steve’s mouth would feel against his when he was really into it and—
Natasha, as pragmatic as ever, squeezed his hand one more time, before she sauntered into the room, bee lining for what looked to be cake frosting.
“Okay, forget it. I won’t last through a blowie,” Tony gasped and closed his eyes. “You’re too much. Just get on with the lube.”
“Jerk,” he retorted, his voice boisterous as his hand reached for Tony’s pants. “Come up here, I wanna touch you.” With that, he quickly hauled Tony up with two fingers in his belt. He opened it quickly, shoving both Tony’s pants and his boxers down over his ass. His fingertips gently caressed his hard length as the rest of him fought to get both of their jeans down.
Tony chuckled, then let his fingers delve under Steve’s uniform shirt to caress his stomach. The smile on his lips faded somewhat as he softly massaged the skin where Ultron had hit him earlier. “And you? You’re bruised, too, I’m not stupid. I… I felt him hurt you.”
There was a pinch between Tony’s brows. It took him a long moment to answer, and when he did, it was barely a whisper.
"If came the next autumn solstice and you have not chosen a bride to wed, you will wed whomever the elders choose for you." Jamti stated, his heartbreaking when he saw the defeat in his friend's eyes; it made Jamti angry, it made him enrage, how an oath breaker of an Omega managed to cause his dearest friend so much pain. "You do not know, Anton, maybe you will find someone who will catch your fancy before the end of Winter!" Jamti gave his friend a weak grin, causing Anton to nod his head and return his attention toward the piece of metal that he was working on before Jamti came to tell him the news.
Tony could only let out a tired sigh, trying to dodge Steve's grapy hands as they tried to pull Tony into a hug; Tony couldn't help but gaze at the ruined sandwich with sadness and pain, this was the 482832nd time that Steve and Serpentine ruined a very good sandwich for him just because they decided to open their mouth and ruin his day with unexpected shit the two of them came up with. "But I can't marry, Steve, next week! I have to go on a business trip to Italy." Tony whined as he gazed at Serpentine with a pout, ignoring how Bucky gasped like he was a dying whale at how Tony dared to oppose the ghost in front of him (Tony was too tired to deal with the Addams anymore, they want him, they have to deal with his brattiness!) on another note, Tony was going to order Pepper to send him to Italy somewhere around the next few days, even if it meant he had to go for work, the crazy Addams don't need to know that he lied to gain a few days of peace.
Natasha helped him inside of the house, as the two of them cleaned and tidy the place, as for Clint the man as it turned out shouldn't be left in the garden alone or he would go overboard… now Tony owned enough firework to last him throw autumn and Winter, and not to forget the bonfire the man did near the lake, something about roasting marshmallows and enjoying the simple life, and that ended up with Natasha and Clint bickering once again.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, horror elements, violence, and character(s) death, poor Tony he will have a heart attack after this chapter, and we will see Steve or not! All reviews are appreciated.
The drive to the hospital was filled with Tony and Peter's chatting at this and that, but it was mostly science mumbo-jumbo that Steve didn't care about that much, and he can see the pride on the Alpha's face when Peter told him that he was in the eighth grade, and Steve hated how his heart skipped a beat at that look, how long did he wish that Tony will one-day return home so the three of them can be family? For how long he wished for the Alpha to look at Peter with pride and happiness? Looking at the Alpha now, it made the Omega bite his tongue and look out of the window hoping that no one will see his glassy eyes
"You don't understand Steve! It was his fault, ever since he came into our home, why are you protecting him?" Tony said desperately, hoping that Steve will listen to him this time, he wanted his mate to believe him, doesn't he understand that this was all James fault, that ever since the younger Alpha arrived, their lives turned upside down.
"Of course we are." Steven said with a fond smile, which made Tony give one of his own, being grateful for how normal Steven was acting around him. "Can you tell me what happened after I passed out?" Steven asked after a while of comfortable silence, which made Tony hum a little and start explaining.
By the time Steve's core collapse on its own, nearly all of the Chitauri were already dead, even some of the ships had fallen from the sky and landed in the battlefield. Steve though, knew that this was not enough, especially when Thanos was still struggling weakly trying to heal himself using the Infinity Stones… Steve heard the sound of something breaking inside him, and he closed his eyes tightly, as he felt his physical original body exploding in a supernova way, followed by the core in this body that held Thanos, sending shockwaves around all of Asgard and its sky and the space surrounding Asgard's realm.
"My answer is yes…" Tony finally gathered the courage to say which made the Alpha tilt his head a little showing the Omega that he was a little confused at that. "You asked me if I wanted to consider this a date… and my answer is yes… so, Steve Rogers, will you go out with me on a date?" Tony asked nervously as he gazed at the Alpha waiting for his reaction… the gentle smile he was at the end of made Tony's heart flutter happily in his chest when he got the Alpha's answer…
He wants it all to end; he was tired of his friends continuing to beg him to get help to save himself before it was too late. He was tired of Clint always coming to his house, begging him to get out of the lab, begging him to go out with him. He was tired of Winnie always coming to his house, mainly to clean it and leave him some food hoping that he will at least eat something before he works himself to death. He was tired of Betty and her mate, offering him help whenever they saw him walking down the street. He was tired of looking at Pepper and seeing the things that he will never have, tired of wanting to hold a child in his arms.
Finishing his wash, the Omega then will go to clean the stables and take care of the horses, feeding them if the one responsible for them didn't show up, which they never did ever since Steven start working under the Iron King's thumb, slacking in their work and leaving Steven to handle the downfall, finishing with the stables, the Omega will start working on the gardens making as much use as he can with the last daylight of the day before he was forced to return home and make the evening meal, which once again he will get yelled at for how bad his skill was at cooking, then the Omega will return to clean the house once again, this time cleaning the first story while ignoring the rooms he was forbidden to enter, which as always his work ended up a little bit after Matins, which got him a few hours of sleep at best.
Today was one of the good days, Tony can tell anyone that; he enjoyed the day with his friends in the town, laughing at Natasha and Clint as they bickered again and introduce him to their friends, he end up sighing happily at the amazing food Angie put in front of him without him even ordering but he inhaled anyway, and spent his evening in Peggy and Bucky's house as the two of them spoil him even when Tony pout like no one's business, but secretly he was all warm on the inside and happy to finally have people who care about him like how Pepper, Rhodey, and the Jarvis family (Rest their souls in peace) do.
"I did, and came up with several plans to do so; all of them would have ended up perfectly. The thing was; I did not count on you having a child." Steven informed the Alpha leaning on the pillows that helped to keep him seated, his words causing the Alpha to lean back on his chair and give Steven a long look like he was studying the meaning behind Steven's words, which only made the Omega roll his eyes.
, it seemed like these lovely ladies don't even know what the word 'No' means," Steve stated in a bored voice, causing the women to flush in embarrassment and anger at how blunt Steve was; Tony couldn't help but laugh at that hiding his face in Steve's shoulder. Of course, Steve wouldn't care about social etiquette; of course, he wouldn't mind embarrassing everyone in this party as much as he doesn't mind turning them into flea-eating frogs… Tony doesn't know why but talking to Steve after being forced to be in Ty's presentation was refreshing.
"What can you tell me about the Infinity Stones in this universe?" Steven asked as he sat in the chair across from Loki's, it usually annoyed Steven that everyone always decided to tag with Steven when he wanted to talk with Loki, and he knows that the man himself was feeling annoyed too, today they were sitting in the tea room, because Loki wanted no one in his room, and he can't really fault the man, the last three times Steven was in the man's room, he ended up snapping at Thor and Clint who made a mess of the whole room.
But what if Peter was really his baby? What will Tony do? As much as Tony fantasy about nothing changing between him and Steve, and that the two of them are going to stay together to raise Peter, he knows that deep down that was not true, that Steve won't forgive him for what he was going to do, that he will be angry, violated, that he will never trust Tony ever again… but he has to make sure…
It was only a few seconds before the Omega blinked his eyes, his brown eyes turning from wild and scared to relieved as he raised his head to gaze at Steve, the barely-there smile that was on his face vanishing at the look of betrayal that Steve was giving him. "S-Steve… I… I can explain…" The Omega said as he let go of the knife, the sound of metal hitting the ground making a loud noise, but it wasn't loud enough to cover the shaky sob that made both Steve and Tony turn sharply to gaze in horror at Peter, who was shaking in his place as he gazed at them, fear and pain shining in his eyes.
Reaching his house Tony grin as he made a B-line to the deck, letting out a hush of giggles like he knows that he was doing something naughty and getting away with it, which made him let out more giggles this time, his heart pounding in his chest, the happiness of earlier that day made him giddy, he ignored the boat and left it alone, planning on using it come morning.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluffy fluff! Peter being a precious bean, maybe a little bit of violence? And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"What do you mean baby?" He opened one of his eyes tiredly, his body hurt from Stan's visit earlier, and he just wanted to close his eyes and rest… and never open them again… but his baby needs him, he was what? Two years old, or maybe he was three? He lost track of time, he doesn't remember if there was a time he wasn't locked in here like an animal… the memories of having a family and warmth were so far away it seems like a distant dream…
It was either a stroke of dumb luck on Steve's side, or the doctors and nurses were happy that he was leaving, that no one came to stop him from leaving the hospital; even if Bucky and Becky were to search for him, Steve would have managed to contact Tony by then that he wouldn't need to fear the consequences.
So what? Part of Anton snapped, glaring at everything in front of him as he marched once more toward his workshop, trying to ignore how his Alpha's hackles were raising and raising and how his hands clenched tightly wanting to punch something or someone until it gave up and blood started to ooze out. So what if the foolish queen decided to get remarried? So what if he refused to wait before remarrying? Or decided to marry someone from his people? It wasn't like it was any of Anton's business to feel angry about how foolish the Omega was… the Omega has nothing to his name, nothing! Does the Omega know how hard he would be forced to work to gather the dowry for marriage even when the person who proposed said he didn't want one? Or that his guardian should at least know about the Omega remarrying? Does the Omega even have a guardian at all?
Steven gazed at the man in surprise, then a small smile took over his face as he lowered himself into a sitting position; it was awkward for a few minutes, both don't know what to say to the person they haven't seen in many years, a lifetime even. Other than Steven knowing that the Alpha had reached his fifties (And looking surprisingly young and alive) and few other information that Steven doubted staying the same as the years passed. Steven doesn't really know that much about the Alpha; how did he survive the seas when he was announced dead? Did he marry or was he still grieving for his dead mate? Where was Nicolaus when Brookland was burned to the ground? Many questions and so many answers Steven could gain. Nicolaus seemed to have the same thoughts as Steven because the Alpha cleared his throat and started talking, filling Steven about what happened in his life and what he missed while Brookland was still standing. A smile crossed over Steven's face, the anger he felt earlier this morning all but disappear as longing filled him when the older man talked about their home. Nicolaus was a family; he was like his uncle, seeing him after all these years brought bittersweet happiness. If only was his mother here, she would have pulled the Alpha's ears for the no doubt over-exaggerated stories the Alpha claimed to go through that gave him the title '
"Your full name?" Steven asked not taking his eyes off of the woman making her jump in her place and gaze at Steven like a dear that was caught in headlights.
"See, I told you he wasn't nice when he goes in one of his fits." A new voice peeped which made the blond growl at that and stand up, already planning to kick the one who said those words, a crazy person he wasn't, but the stress of what happened to him and being surrounded by idiotic Midgardian was enough to tick him off.
"How are you, Steve? I know this must be a lot for you, not only did you meet the person who the fate chose as the one, but now you are to take care of a child that not only is not yours, but he thinks that you are his father… what's your Alpha's reaction to all of this?" Jarvis said calmly looking at the tired Alpha that leans on the wall behind him to think.
It was a week from hell, everything was blurry and he couldn't concentrate on anything other than the need, he needed something, he knows he does! But what?! In the distant, he swore he heard his father enrage voice as he huffed and puffed, it was followed by his mother, aunt Peggy, and Jarvis… and Tony was scared. He remembered how he made his body crawl into his closet, and close the door behind him, he didn't know how much he stayed there, but he knows it was enough to cause panic with his 'family'. Tony knew it was childish, but he couldn't stop wishing that Captain America would come and save him…
"Say Bucky, why don't the two of us go shopping today?" Steve asked, a huge grin took over his face at the thought of being out of the house, maybe he will get to know Bucky better and the two of them will become friends! Bucky though only gave a choking noise as he gazed at Steve with wide eyes like Steve has lost his mind, but the Omega won't take any offense to it, it seems that Bucky was the shy type, too shy, and still didn't get the hang of being out of the military, Steve was sure that a day out will do Bucky good, the Alpha didn't leave the house since he came here! "Come on Bucky, you and me, just us! We can go shopping in any mall you want, I can even show you around Manhattan and you can see the changes that took place in the last decade! My treat I promise!" Steve was starting to get excited at the thought of finally leaving the house, and enjoying a day out, maybe he can sneak a dozen or two pieces of clothes in Bucky's dresser, the man doesn't seem to have much, and he was angry at his oversight, but not as angry as he was at Tony, for ignoring his brother or and not helping him financially when he was loaded and running SI.
The mug that was full of tea was in one of his hands, warming it from the biting cold that made it shake, the other hand his right caress his belly, refusing to find another perch, afraid that his baby will vanish if he moved it away; Tony was still not believing what happened early this morning, his mind couldn't wrap around what happened, he was sick of the dark fate that waited for him, how Ty would have taken him against his will and would end up killing him, which made Tony desperately hold himself tight, afraid of getting sick; in the back of his mind he wondered who saved him, if it was the monster that punished everyone who bullied another.
The next day you will find Tony looked at himself in the mirror for the sixth time; he didn't want to admit it, but Tony was so nervous about finally meeting Harley for the first time. Steve and Peter on the other hand were supportive of him and tried to cheer him up (Well, Steve did), telling him what Harley likes and what he doesn't, and that he likes science and robots, and how Harley is easy to scare, and how he has asthma that acted up every time he was startled (The last two things didn't really help him at all gathering enough courage to meet the little boy; Steve ended up pulling Peter's ear when the boy went to tell Tony about how easily startled Harley is when an Omega makes fast moves).
The tears were hot in Steven's eyes, a pained whine was trapped behind his lips; the thought of him losing his child, losing his only family was too much. Standing from his bed, Steven gritted his teeth and bear the pain in his stomach, his first priority was to find James, his baby; Steven has to find him before Johann did! His James was in danger, just like his brother, he was not going to lose his James too!
When the woman was finally gone, Tony slide down until he was on the floor, terror taking hold of him as the realization of what the ghost said finally made sense to his poor and scared mind. "I'm going to die…" Tony choked, tilting his head to the side as he finally understood that he just let a ghost who was the cause of the Great Depression stay in his mansion with the scariest and ruthless assassin in the whole world...
he slept on. It had been weeks since Hammer was humiliated on national TV; weeks since Steve came home happy as he made a B-ling to Tony and hugged him to death as if he was expecting praise for what he did on national TV. It had been weeks of the Addams' creepiness surrounding him from all sides, causing Tony to finally give up and accept his dark fate, after all, who would care what happen to Tony Stark? Tony was just entertainment to the outside world and a target to his 'friends' who were still angry that he was going to marry Steve. Like why don't you propose to him?! Tony didn't make it hard to do that, did he? They weren't even in a real relationship!
"Probably because uncle Bucky work with him, you know that he and uncle Bucky are a pack, right? And uncle Bucky is a family, so that's probably why." Steve said avoiding the question with a pounding heart, fear taking hold of his chest at the possibility of Peter knowing that Tony was his father; it will be a disaster…
Natasha and Clint were waiting for them at the door the two of them were arguing about something, when the two noticed them they smiled, their argument is forgotten; they duck out into the street toward Natasha's car. The rain isn't showing any sign of letting up, but Natasha still insists on dragging Tony and his friends to the department store down the street to buy what they need, and it seems she made the right call; for Pepper and Rhodey went and bought what they wanted, Pepper picked out a couple of cable-knit sweaters, a bath towel, and some fitted sheets, throwing them at Rhodey, who folds them over his arm as he follows her around the store, all the while Pepper was complaining about how forgetful Rhodey was, and how amazing the store is. Pepper lingers over the selection of quilts and blankets, settling on a woolen blanket in dark green and a quilt made of squares of muted, earth-toned fabric before shoving Rhodey towards the cashier's desk, and insisting on him paying, glaring at the man until he did, and it caused Tony to laugh silently, for he had missed the couple dearly even when they fight.
Sam opened his mouth maybe to plea with the Omega to sit down least he fell, or maybe to call a shrink or a doctor, but Tony's blank look made him swallow. "I was able to get my hands on a few photos of the child, in many different cases this would have been impossible, but…" The Beta said as he gave Tony an envelope.
Any other person who even dared to act the way Braes did would have met their end by Starkad's hands, but as it was, the Beta had been Starkad's friend for over a decade and a half. "A brawl is taking a place on the main road, Hamar and his followers are terrorizing the queen when he was heading to his people, the young prince tried to stop them and…" Any other word Braes tried to tell him went over his head, and he starts running as fast as he can to the main road, his heart was pounding in his throat at the thought of his son being in the middle of a brawl, especially a brawl that had Hamar in it, for the man always played dirty, and always tried to take away his most prized possessions.
A whimper left him as he tried desperately to open his eyes. It took time, his body was killing him, from the top of his head to the tip of his toes; hell, even his goddammit hair was hurting, and that was mindboggling as it is. It was like he has spent the night fighting with bears and lions, only to be hit by a train came morning, which was not a reassuring image at all.
"Nothing, baby, everything is going to be fine; it's just Tony and the Avengers getting called," Steve stated calmly as he rushed to the panic room as fast as he can without running and waking Peter even more, it was a few seconds before Steve skid down the hall, his eyes widen when they fell on someone… actually, it was not someone per se, it wasn't even a person! It was… it was a raccoon; a raccoon with big guns but still a raccoon, a rabid raccoon that glared at Steve and pointed the guns his way.
It was calm; the coldness was seeping in every living thing that dared to wake in the night. The eternal night with the dark sky that was doted by stars; stars in different sizes and shapes, giving the land below the light it needs, not to flourish, no, but enough that whoever walks on its land will see where their steps were taking them. Rocks float around the place, no gravity to hold them down; footsteps echoed loudly in the place, promising many things and nothing at the same time. The stars' light seemed to waver as if they flinched away from the dark and cursed place. Something was approaching, something dark… something that promised only death and pain and despair.
Margaret's words were mirrored by many, which made happiness bloom in Steven's heart as he looked at them with a happy yet sad look.
Tony heard the front door open and close, followed by a sigh and a grumble about idiot Alphas. Tony's lips twitch up at that and he stood up and stretches his body wincing at the cracks he heard from his back, yeah… that was a bad idea. Anyway, time to say 'Hi' to the hopefully Godmother of the baby. "Pep!" Tony called out making the apartment get quiet and footsteps were heard rushing toward the living room.
The child said in Icelandic which made Johann look at the child in confusion than at Steven, it was only a second before rage clouded the Alpha's eyes, the Omega was teaching the pup a barbaric language behind his back! That caused the Alpha to snarl and he nearly attacked the Omega but he was stopped by the same redhead woman with green eyes…
"Oh honey, didn't Stevie tell you? I came here to hunt your mansion for a while! After all, every mother should get to know her future son-in-law better, don't you think?" The woman asks, her smile turned dangerous as she stared down at him, which was a fate considering that the woman was five feet, but somehow she managed it, and she was absolutory scary while doing it.
"Explain." Her father ordered, and for the thousand times, Nebula tried to reign in her disgust; her father always gets like this when he was talking about
"Babe, what's not to like, you are adorable!" Tony said with a grin, causing the blond to roll his eyes at that, but Tony considers it as a win when he saw the smile on his Omega's face. "Say, babe, why don't we return to bed, we still have a few hours left to rest… I will make it worth your while…" The man said while wiggling his brows causing Steve to chuckle at that and bite his lower lip trying to stop his smile from widening.
It started with Tyber and his sister's manipulating nature; the two of them were so desperate to try and twist the queen's tale, that the two of them started to give outlandish accusations. So outlandish that everyone started to doubt their honesty, which was nothing but a joy to those who wanted this play to end. It started with the queen's want for justice and revenge on the oathbreaker, that the Omega agreed to an alliance between Anton and him not caring for the consequences as much as caring about the results. As for Anton, the Alpha was thrown in the middle of this, not for the lack of trying mind you, but because Anton was being pulled between two opposing forces that tried to win his favor… well, one of the forces (Tyber) was trying to win his favor, as for the other (Steven), Anton was the one who forced himself on to try and win him, which gained Anton nothing but a twitch of an eye. Strange accordance, but not that unwelcomed.
The sound of whimpering caught Tony's attention, causing him to tighten his grip on his ax, planning on swinging it on the first person he sees, not caring if they were Zemo or not, he wanted blood and he would get the blood he want. Holding his growl, Tony walked toward the source of whimpering, a harsh frown on his face as he arrived toward the source, only to see nothing but boxes. Raising his eyebrow, Tony tilted his head to the side, wondering what kind of thing would hide here, was it possible that Tony found a puppy or a cat on the verge of death? That thought caused a dark smile to paint Tony's face; with a hum, he moved the ax in his hand pushing the boxes away from his path, boredom coloring his face when he reached the last box.
Steve was still looking at the sky when that metal thing came into his view, making Steven frown harshly and give it a nasty look, already feeling his right leg throbbing. "So… are you done?" The metal thing asked which made Steven purse his lips but sighed and nodded his head, he was already too tired to care about what will happen to him, after all, he was interrupted from his four years journey toward his original body and fell here… into a wasteland that was inhabitant by metal creatures… a land that not even in all of Steven's long existent did he saw or gaze at that place. "Hey, I hate to ask and snap you out of your brooding hour, but do you know where that star that crashed here disappeared to?" The metal thing asked which made Steven scowl and send him a hateful glare, which made that thing raise both of its hands as if trying to calm him down.
"Can you please stop blaming your brother for every single thing that something wrong happened?" Steve finally snapped, unable to calm himself, not after what he experienced today; Tony throwing the blame left and right wasn't helping him at all. "Look, Tony, I don't know what is your fucking problem with Bucky, and I don't even want to know, but please… please stop doing this, stop blaming him for everything, stop acting like he is the lower of the low; if nothing else he is your brother, so please." Steve plea, turning to his husband who was looking away from him; a few minutes passed with no acknowledgment from his husband which made Steve bit his bottom lip and turns away heading to the bathroom.
A few seconds later the shuffling stopped before returning, and after a minute or two, the person behind him finally gathered the courage to come and sit beside Steve. Steve didn't need to turn around to see who it is, he already knows the person who showed up, after all, Tony had to have the last word even in a losing argument. "I'm doing what has to be done," Tony said, his words causing Steve to roll his eyes, of course, Tony will start his argument with something like that, if Steve didn't care about this idiot he would have already thrown him from the tower's roof.
"It is but a simple price…" Nebula told the woman, her tongue getting thicker as she tried to banish the horror that would befall the Ancient One away from her mind. Nebula wondered if Thanos was going to be merciful enough to rip the star's heart and eat it out; Nebula desperately hoped for that, at least death would have been more merciful to the star than decades of torture and assault that would follow. Nebula could only before he too started breaking and losing his mind…
It was a few seconds or hours later, Tony had stopped counting, that the Omega heard a snarl and a familiar voice shouting, which made him secure his grip on the sleeping pup and stand up just as the hug/scary/blond Alpha cross the corner, it took a few seconds of the Alpha stared at him with a strange look on his face then he rushed toward the Omega and the pup. "Mr. Stark." The Alpha said in a low voice full of worry, and Tony wonder if he could really explain what happened a few hours ago?
"'m fine…" Harley swallowed, his lips trembling like he was a second away from crying, an action that pulled at Tony's heartstrings, making him steel himself and not do something rash like pulling the kid in his embrace and not letting go. It was a few seconds later that Harley raised his head to glare at Tony, as if daring him to do something or say something, Harley's jaw was sit in the same stubborn scowl that Steve had, which made Tony's lips twitched up… Steve and Harley did have a special bond, which made Tony wonder if Harley had come to Steve but couldn't find him; maybe he did, the boy certainly didn't seem to know that Steve and Tony had married last month or he wouldn't have called Tony by his maiden name.
…" The voice said in wonder, a giggle could be heard hidden deep within it, and when that thing raised its clawed hand….
It was a month since that terrifying day; a month, a short time, but at the same was a long time as any, Steve just hope that he won't end up crushed when Tony decided that he was done playing house and that he was content with being back to work, where he will ignore Steve until he remembered that he had a husband waiting for him back home; a husband that was pregnant with his daughter. Steve sighed as he went under the shower, welcoming the warm water that descended on his back, trying to distract himself before hormones decided to act up and Steve would find himself crying in the bathroom.
"What happened?" Steve asked gently hoping that he wouldn't throw the older man into a raging fit with that question…
"We are fine, doll, though we missed you, I wish you could have come with us…" Steve murmured, giving Tony another kiss on the cheek his beard tickling Tony's face making the Omega shiver pleasantly, an annoying knowing grin was pasted Steve's face when he noticed what his action was doing, though, Tony won't mention it, for he was too busy questioning how the older man was looking more handsome today than usual, maybe it's because Tony didn't see him and Peter for three days, and that made Tony pout fiercely because Tony sure as hell missed his boys.
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluffiest fluff, Steve is finally opening up to everyone, and Peter and Tony are the cutest little fellas out there! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Isn't this too much?" Bucky asked when Steve survey their fifth shop, which was an amazing place selling winter wear, Bucky's uncomfortable tone made Steve gaze at the Alpha who looked like he prefers to be anywhere but here, Steve's eyes soften at that, and he gave the Alpha a reassuring smile.
The teen couldn't have been older than fifteen, with brown chocolate hair, and light brown eyes. The teen was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, kneeling next to a claw-like machine. The teen was beautiful, especially with that wide and innocent smile on his face. Steve didn't know he was holding the picture, until the sound of someone clearing their throat made Steve jump and look at the person, only to see Howard gazing at him… well, more of at the picture in his hand…
It was only a minute or so before James came back inside, dragging Petrus with him. The smaller boy was trying hard to make James let go of him, but between the two of them, James was the strongest so Petrus struggling didn't work. Steven raised his eyebrow at James; gaining nothing but a sheepish look from his pup, who let go of Petrus and rushed toward his bedside, giving him his famous puppy dog eyes.
"He became a fallen star…" The grin on the Mad Titan's face widens even more if that was possible, causing Nebula's breath to hitch; when the meaning of Thanos' words finally hit her, Nebula's eyes widen uncontrollably. "For the first time in years, you have done an amazing job, Nebula, I'm proud of you." Thanos said in a soft voice, his big hand came for Nebula's head, petting her like she was nothing but a domestic animal. "Go and prepare my army, we are going to Asgard to bring the gift that my Bride deserves, after that, we are bringing my bride home." The titan laughed loudly, causing Nebula to shiver as she stood up, nodding to her father before rushing away from Thanos when he let her go; desperately Nebula tried to run away from the laughter that echoes all around the place, suffocating her and causing her worse fear to come true.
"Of course, Papa, I love Tony." Peter answered looking at Steve with wide innocent eyes, probably wondering why Steve will ask him something like that, which made Steve's lips twitch up.
James's words, caused Steven to press his lips tightly, he turned to the small boy that was still holding onto him like the Omega was going to disappear any time if the boy didn't hold on. It broke Steven's heart; it really hurt him how much the pup seemed to suffer without his idiotic father realizing it.
Pepper's frantic voice called out making Tony let out a shaky breath. "My baby is alive, all these years, when I felt him out there, he was really alive I didn't imagine it …" Tony let out a shaky laugh at that… "He is alive." Tony heard Pepper confused shouts, for the first time in six years…
"For God's sake, fuck off!" Steven snapped which made the room become so quiet that you could hear a straw of hay fall and it will sound like a loud bang, it made Steven blink at that and turn to Peggy who was looking at Steven like the older man confess to her about being the true leader of Hydra. "What? Did I say something wrong?" Steven asked which made the rest of the team look at him.
Steve grunt as he started to wake up, his head was killing him, and his body hurt; for a second Steve tensed when he felt someone snuggling into his back, only for Steve to relax when he remembered that the person behind him was no other than Tony, who was holding Steve and refuse to let him go.
"Mr. Rogers." The doctor called out which made both Steve and Tony blink their eyes, letting go of each other before turning to the Beta who was blinking in surprise at the sight they were making. "I see…" The female said before smiling causing Steve to relax a little, turning to the kids before ushering them outside with Natasha and Clint. If the doctor had important news, bad or good, Steve wanted to discuss them with Tony before informing the kids about it.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, maybe blood and violence, a little fluff, and Steve being patient as a saint! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Then what are we going to do? Natasha and I can do all of the undercover work, but what about the Helicarriers?" Clint asked looking t Natasha who was looking at Steven with a strange look, the Omega didn't even know what to make off, but what the man said made Clint a little afraid; if Shield was Hydra does that mean that Phil was too?
"Very well…" Steven said as he stood up, planning on leaving, not wanting to see Pepper's face, hating to see the woman that destroyed his husband's life more than Steven imagine she would.
The picture that Steve gave to his son, the boy always took with him no matter where he goes, though he never took it outside of the house in fear of losing it, these days, his baby usually leave it on the coffee table in the living room, because that's where Peter spent half of his days after returning from daycare and later on, school.
"I am an idiot…" Steve murmured to himself ignoring how Peggy and Bucky looked at each other in concern before turning to Steve. "I should probably apologize to Tony and tell him I am not coming, this is stupid, I can't even step my right foot in front of my left without tripping." Steve bite the inside of his cheek, wondering how stupid was he, asking Tony out for a dance when he couldn't help but trip every time he tried to take the step needed for the dance, not to forget about the twirling, it was a nightmare on its own.
"Everything will be perfect for our children. That's a promise, Steve." Tony says one night after they've made love; both of them snuggling closely under the cover and listening closely in case that Peter will sneak into their room to sleep with him, 'So that his baby sister won't feel scared', Peter always claim.
Tony shivered as he walked toward his house after a month; he walked to the house with Ty's words chanting in the back of his head.
A choked whine left Tony when he felt a soft squeeze on one of his hands, causing Tony to raise his head, his teary eyes taking in Steve whose tired eyes were staring at Tony unfocus in their stare. "Steve, sorry, Steve…" Tony gasped, repeating his words over and over again, gaining nothing but a shuddered breath from Steve and his hand being squeezed weakly.
"If you wanted to help, then I will appreciate you leaving me to my thoughts." Anton snapped, loud enough to make everyone still and gaze at the king who had a furious look on his face. "Now, if you would please be quiet, we are going to reach the hunting ground soon." Anton huffed, clicking at his horse to go a little faster, leaving Tyber behind as he tried to recover from the embarrassment not a few seconds ago.
, the phone was still lying on his desk, and no, it wouldn’t magically disappear just because he wished it so.
Tony pulled out the bullet he’d been shot with. “There were three slugs. And the riffling doesn’t match anything I’ve ever seen and JARVIS says it’s untraceable.”
“I just mean… I could top, too. I’d love to be inside you, so much. If you don’t want that, that’s really fine, we don’t have to do that, I love—” He stopped, biting his lip. Yeah, not going there. “Everything we do will be great.”
This was all so weird and Steve needed more of it. He needed Tony to strip his pants off and feel the hardness between his legs. He needed him to do something to ease the fire he’d set loose in Steve’s body. He needed—
Their shared weeks eventually wrangled a confession from Steve’s lips as to the confusing nature of his dreams. He couldn’t keep it to himself any longer, and he didn’t want to talk about it with his psychiatrist. At first, he’d thought Natasha would call him a lunatic and be done with it, but she’d sounded intrigued more than anything. That was probably a bonus of working within an organization that dealt daily with not-so-normal events and people.
“I begin to see where you and Steve would’ve been besties,” he mumbled, before standing up and walking to the window front of Barnes’ cell. “Look, if you sign this, you’re an official member of the Avengers Initiative and whatever the US decides to accuse you with, I’ll be able to answer for you. I can use my lawyers to present your cause, and the other Avengers can testify for you.” He put the stack of papers in the pass-through, pushing it forward. “Just think of it as an insurance. It doesn’t have to be more than that.”
Steve nodded and sighed deeply with relief and satisfaction. “I forgot how bitter we were,” he whispered.
Living on Earth had been an endless pit of decadence and sin, mocking the way humanity preached a pseudo-morality that denied the sway of temptation.
A small smile graced Tony’s lips. “Your innocence is nothing you have to apologize for. Trust me.” He looked at him with a serious expression. “Do you really want this?”
Steve thought in a haze, and he was about to leave, when he realized what exactly Tony was doing right there, standing in the water.
Steve dragged a hand over his face. “That makes two of us. Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are.”
Tony stared at him for a moment. He was obviously trying to keep his expression in check, but Steve saw it nevertheless: a pang of pure sadness, and it had Steve confused beyond measure. Was the suggestion really that out of the picture? He knew it would be difficult for two men, maybe impossible, but if he’d had the chance to meet Tony, he would take it without a doubt.
“And I know you can’t do this,” he started, staring into distance. “But I… I just wanna say that I don’t regret it.” He smiled, forced himself to, really. “Kissing you was great. Greater than pretty much everything I’ve ever done so far so… yeah. I don’t regret it.”
She led him past the next crossroad, into a back alley that wound behind the theaters and restaurants. Only a handful of people were milling there. They were leaving after some late performance. They giggled and talked amongst themselves even as they scattered into the darkness.
Steve remained in stunned delirium as Tony’s tongue pushed into his mouth, but then he was all but ravaging him. The pent up tension, the longing, the worry, the sadness—so much sadness. Everything poured into one single kiss. They tasted each other. Needing far more than could be given, needing everything and nothing at all.
He twirled the fork between his fingers for a moment, before he leaned up and pulled Steve in for a kiss with a hand on his neck. Lingering for a moment, tracing Steve’s lips with his own, Tony knew it would all be worth it. “I’m also stupidly insecure, sometimes. I’m in it, of course I am.”
“Getting there.” Tony upended the bottle, took another huge swig, leaned back against the chair and started to sing again. “
A good hour later, Bucky was sitting cross-legged on a broken freezer when Steve reentered the cellar. He’d used some iron chains to tie him down, making sure his bionic arm was secured in a manner that should make it impossible for Bucky to get any leverage and free himself. Steve had brought the shield with him, however, in case he was wrong.
In the back, the others were quietly trailing out of the room, too. Sam and Wanda without another comment, Vision with a pat to Tony’s back that Tony really didn’t know what to make of.
The tone in Tony’s voice was harsh and closed-off, and Vision found irritation rise within, which only irritated him more. Usually, Tony’s antics left him a bit impatient, but the feeling inside him now was decidedly different. Decidedly more conflicted.
Tony could hear his heart slowing; feel the heat ebbing from his body. Steve stared at him and he slowed down for a second, before gaining speed again. A moment later, they were in the Quinjet.
God, Tony was afraid. So afraid to lose this, while knowing exactly that they didn’t have really have another option. Steve would be
He had come to love those eyes fiercely, and now, they were empty. And they stayed that way when Tony’s gauntlet crashed right into Bucky’s face.
“Tell me,” Tony panted as he tightly gripped Steve’s arms, “how it made you feel when I did that. Did it feel this good?”
It was odd, seeing him so bruised. It probably had been a while since Steve’d been hurt this much. Not even Tony had managed to injure him like this in Siberia… and certainly not for lack of trying.
known it. So he covered the space between them, feeling Steve’s heart thudding against his chest, and drew him in again.
Steve sighed. A heavy, drawn-out sigh. He sank forward suddenly, elbows on his knees, and head falling into his waiting hands. “I just…” He shook his head and fell silent for a moment, palpably searching for words. “I thought I could do this. Come back here, just do what Fury asks of me, and… I can’t.”
Steve’s hold on him faltered. He stared at him, and though it took him a moment to grasp Tony’s words, the relief was bright and all-consuming.
Tremors seized both of their bodies, blinding ecstasy ripping through every fiber. He didn’t even know who came first or how long it took, Steve couldn’t see—he could barely breathe if he wasn’t chanting Tony’s name, soaking their cocks with his release.
“It’s better for the both of us,” Tony replied. He willed his wings away again, wincing only slightly at the pain the movement still ignited in him.
There were about two seconds of undisturbed bliss, with Tony’s mind floating off to a space where Steve had actually just agreed to go steady, before his words registered with him.
“Do me a favor and listen to my plan before you try to convince me to drop it, would you?” Steve asked, brushing a tender kiss across Tony’s forehead.
“It’s just a graze,” Tony interrupted him firmly, not entirely able to keep the wince of pain out of his voice. “Nothing Extremis can’t heal. Go get him. I’ll stay with Nick.”
“To explain it to me. Your reasons for protecting Barnes. I wouldn’t have listened back then, maybe not for a long time, but we’ve worked together again for a couple of months now, and you… you never even tried to talk to me.”
“We can’t. Not right now.” A sigh from Steve. “Ross won’t believe a word we say, and we have to find out what the game plan is before something happens. We’re on our own.”
His ears strained through the silence, barely catching the faint sounds of their movements. And for the first time in days, something akin to curiosity welled up in his mind. There was an itch to see, but before he could reach a decision, Stark was talking again.
He still often woke up terrified that he was back in Zola’s basement, in the container they had locked him in. The place that had been his prison for years that felt like an eternity. That everything that happened since would be accredited to a dream, and this place, Natasha, Steve, everything… would only be a place he had imagined in a fit of despair.
He kind of missed touching Tony, but if it meant they had a chance to get along a little better, and maybe get to actually know each other, Steve was okay with that. For the moment.
,” Steve breathed in understanding. Now that he knew, the resemblance was obvious. “You’re… your name’s Tony Stark? You’re Howard’s son?”
Of course, Captain America would go down with a last, ultimate heroic act. Saving the man who’d sent him into exile, no less—saving him with his own life.
“What?” Bruce asked with an incredulous tone. For a long second, he stared down at Tony’s abdomen, before glancing back at him with a distinctively more worried expression. “Just try to stay conscious, I’ll get it out.”
Together, all three of them walked down into the cellar. The room where the Eye of Agamotto had once been was now empty, aside from a single chair standing in the middle of it.
Steve laughed at that. "Takes a lot more than that to break Bucky Barnes. He appreciates it, don’t worry," he said, turning to Tony fully. "I don't know what to say. This is…" He hesitated, looked at the blueprints so that he wouldn't have to look at Tony when he continued talking, finally deciding to steer the conversation towards their own predicament. "You—you left so quickly…"
Steve shook his head with conviction. “No. Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards from the barracks. If they rebuilt it, they wouldn’t have done it there.”
Seeing Obadiah Stane outside the confines of Stark Mansion was startling, but his presence filled Steve with a dark foreshadowing all the same.
“I told you, I’ve been here before. I know the way,” Steve told him, smile becoming positively smug when Tony stopped fighting him, his gaze fixating on Steve’s lips instead. He stole a kiss from him, lingering momentarily, then continued on his way. “Besides,” he called over his shoulder. “I thought you
He didn’t answer, though, he just keep on staring at Tony, who tried to look as open and honest as possible. The outcome of this conversation will shape his future, it will change who he is.
Tony didn’t know if that made him like himself more, but who knew? Maybe he could get there. Someday. Right now, though, he had more important things to think about.
I've already got like 4000-5000 words for the final chapter, so you won't have to wait for the happy ending for too long. (And a tiny, little bit more angst. Really, just a biiiiit more --)
”I didn’t ask for a husband or son either, but here we are,” Tony said smugly, looking closely to see if something in Rogers sad expression slipped. He stayed flawlessly, not even flinching around the eyes or anything. Tony blew out some air.
He also didn’t know why the ‘don’t care about me’ left this bitter taste in his mouth; as if those words didn’t belong there. They shouldn’t exist, not out loud and not as thought, because they weren’t true. Tony didn’t want to think about why it was like that. He didn’t care about Rogers.
“Steve is my roommate,” Bucky told him before stepping to the side, “Second door on the left, make sure to knock, or you’ll startle this punk and he’ll mess up his drawing and pout all week long. Been there, done that, barely survived. Losing my arm was less painful.” He shrugged and then grinned mischievously.
Steve had told him so often that he could just ask when he had questions. Had always assured him that he was not alone, never will be again. Tony had seen it as threat when he had first heard it, because
He turned around and was ready to just lie back down in his bed, when Peter answered him. Tony only barely suppressed a roll of his eyes.
”Yes,” he drew the syllable out, as if he actually wanted to keep it to himself. Tony wasn’t the least surprised that Steve didn’t just lie about it, like everyone else would have. ”But you are right, Tony. You aren’t a prisoner. And I am sorry if I ever made you feel as if you were.”
It took him a few minutes to look back at Tony, with bright eyes. “Daddy?” He asked, a grin spreading on his little face.
But I still had problems with Beta - Readers. A few people agreed to read over my texts which is incredibly nice and I appreciated it and I get being busy,I literally have like - 10h of free time myself, but I didn't hear back from any of them for months so I decided to read over my stuff myself. There'll still be mistakes hshdfds sorry. I just got out of work, have to study for 3 exams and it's like - super late, but I wanted to upload this now so - I hope it's ok!!)
”You were over the moon,” he said silently, eyes shining in a bright blue, making him look way younger than 34.
huffed and then went over to the kid, ruffling his light brown hair playfully. ”And I kept my promise, Mister, you do see your Daddy.”
”Spiders,” Tony repeated, ”Your favourite animals are spiders because they were printed on your snuggles.”
”I’ll bring him home in a sec, do you mind watching him a bit longer, though? I want to say goodbye to Tony.”
. Not when he still had so much happiness left that it shone over all the other dark emotions inside of him. It would be a part of this big emotional ball inside his brain soon enough, only coming out when he was happy, but right now he had his time to feel light. Better not to overthink it.
He huffed. Why would he care? They weren’t even his. They belonged to a stranger. A stranger whose ring he had on his finger.
”Thank you for —” Steve cleared his throat, clearly not knowing if he should finish his sentence. Then apparently deciding to do it, not much of a surprise to Tony. Steve always said about everything he thought. He wasn’t afraid to say the hard things. There was a bravery behind it that Tony envied, not that he’d ever admit that to anyone. ”Staying sober. It couldn’t have been easy, but I am glad that you did it.”
“It worked, huh? You got one hell of a smile, much better than the one you tried to convince me that you were fine with.”
Fury blinks his eye at Tony's complaint and narrows it, coming to stand in front of Tony and slam both of his hands on the table, which by the way was not necessary at all. "Break up with Rogers and while you are doing that make sure you host a conference stating that you have never been with Rogers and that it was nothing but a misunderstanding." Fury said in a serious voice, causing Tony to give a dumb '
A tired sigh followed by the drag of one of the dining room chairs, when Tony finally raised his head he saw Angie sitting beside him, gazing at him and Morgan with a soft and sad look. "I told them this was a bad idea… hiding the truth I mean," Angie stated, smiling when Morgan turned to her and begin waving her arms around. "No one is going to hurt you, Tony, I know you that you probably won't believe us, and maybe even refuse to because of the secrets we kept, but be assured that no one would hurt you," Angie whispered softly, her words causing Tony's lips to tremble and for his eyes to return back to his daughter.
Then there was the sound of something moving in the crawl space underneath the house. It is slow and heavy, the thump and susurration of a dead weight being dragged through the dirt. And Tony listen with tear-filled eyes to the sound of ragged breathing until he realized that it was not his own. Because… because he's awake. He's awake and there is something moving in the crawl space under his house! His lungs lock, at the thought of Stane finally catching up to him, the huff of breath that had been gathering in the roof of his mouth tries to push back down his throat but it couldn't he was shaking at the thought of Stane finally catching up to him after three months.
The king rolled his eyes, which nearly made Steven bristle at the action, but he held his tongue, mainly because he was sure that his baby will do something stupid if Steven and the king start fighting in front of him. "You can call yourself whatever you want, I do not really care about it. The only thing I do care about is you always returning back here by the end of the day." Stated the king before turning around planning to leave Steven, which was something that did nothing but make the Omega frown.
Thor had gone back to Asgard, Steve refused to tell the prince or his friends about any other information, least something happened that was unsavory, Thor told him that he was going to talk with his father in hope that his father will grant Steve a meeting to discuss a way for him to go back home, or a way to stop the dark future that Thor got a glimpse of by Edith's analyzing.
"I don't wear heels! Tony hissed as he tried to keep his voice down, face turning red from embarrassment. Steven couldn't help but let out a genuine laugh at Tonys expression; it was the same look that his husband always sent him every time he brought up the subject of the man's high heels collections.
