“Cas, I- I’m sorry,” Dean said.
"Dean," Cas said causing Dean to look up.
"Bet you enjoyed calling me
Sam helped Cas and placed him in a spot, and then he guided Dean to a few inches away from Cas. It was too close. The sky started to rumble and dark clouds appeared, blocking out the sun completely.
high because they were the god damn Winchesters, but somehow this felt worse.
Dean took a deep breath in, "That's none of your business." Sam who had been sitting beside Castiel surrounded by Inias, Jody and Donna, nudged Cas with his elbow. Cas turned to see Dean slowly losing his battle with his temper and immediately rushed over to defuse the tension.
"What in the-" Dean muttered, putting his hands to find that it was feathers. Incredibly soft yet austere, black feathers.
. I feel better now that you're here, but there's this darkness I can't fucking shake off," Dean mumbled, staring at his hands on his lap.
Mama, I'm coming home- Ozzy Ozbourne
"What the fuck are those?" Dean asked, nodding to the swords.
"Cas buddy, hey it's me,"Dean spoke very gently and carefully. He reached out to touch Castiel's shoulder but the angel flinched away.
"I am aware that you don't feel that way towards me or well- you know men. But that's okay. I'll always be your friend and even to be your friend, to be by your side, is an honour in itself," Castiel rambled, shifting his weight from his left leg to his right.
Unsteady- X Ambassador
Cas grinned, kissing Dean again, but this time a little more hungrily.
Sam watched his brother finish the beer and stare down at the table.
"Perks of being a mundane once," Clary said, as she drove the car down the stranded road.
"Cas, we're in a fairytale. Let me catch you up to speed. So, in this fairytale, Cinderella is a pretty little girl working for an evil stepmom. She wants to go to the ball that the royal castle is holding to meet the prince. The magical fairy godmother helps her get ready, turning a pumpkin into a carriage, rats into horses and dressing her up, and Cinderella goes to the ball. But Cinderella must return home before the clock strikes midnight or the magic fades and everyone will realise she's just a maid. She dances with the prince. The clock strikes. She runs and leaves her glass slipper behind. The prince then goes around trying to find the girl who fits into the glass slipper. He finally finds Cinderella, they get married. You know, your classical fairytale," Dean finishes, pulling Cas into him closer.
Sam floundered, "Ew Dean. Put that down. We must be close though."
"Heh, you're welcome I guess," Dean stuttered, peaking a glance at the angel. Cas was smiling, and Dean's entire world suddenly became a whole lot brighter.
"And nobody does anything to hurt Dean or put him in more danger," Alec followed through, receiving an appreciative look from Cas.
Cas kissed Dean's forehead gently which was his way of saying "you're welcome". Dean said goodnight and passed out on Cas's chest as the sun rose slowly above them outside the bunker.
"I sent her back to her demonic realm. She won't return, trust me. All portals are closed," Magnus said, standing beside Alec.
. And now- he's- I don't know Dean, he just needs time," Sam said quietly.
"May I touch them?" Dean asked cautiously. Castiel remained quiet for a bit pondering on the question before he answered with, "yes of course." Dean's fingers trailed along the feathers- they were as soft as the clouds- making Castiel shudder at the touch. Dean noticed the dent where the bullets had make their mark on the wings leaving the feathers puffed up and bloody.
"What the hell happened?" Dean asked, now trying to walk. The blood spewed into his head a little too fast, causing Dean to sway and almost fall over.
"Purgatory ain't the place for this," Dean muttered.
"No, I meant, I'm tired of fighting with you." Cas pulled away a little to look at Dean, "I hate fighting with you. I'm sorry for hurting you, can we just- go back to normal. I'm so tired, Dean." Cas fell back into Dean, head dropping weakly.
Sam and Dean worked best together than apart but finding the Most Holy Man was not easy. Dean got frustrated quickly, and they ran into a vampire nest on the way. This didn't reside well with Dean, who just wanted to retrieve the blood and return home but Sam was persistent that they hunt the vampires. Their hunt ended faster than either of them had anticipated but was grateful for.
“Why didn’t you fucking tell me?” Dean asked, his voice sounding small and weak.
Cas could always read in between the lines. He knew when Dean was lying out of his teeth, or when Dean was hurting but refused to show it.
you. But he's scared. I would feel the same if it was me and Kaia. I would give everything to get her back, Dean," Claire said, with a weak smile.
The next day, Jody asked Dean and Cas to check out this vampire nest in the next town, while they waited for Sam. Dean refused it immediately. Cas accepted it and agreed to go alone. Dean hesitated then and agreed to hunt with Cas as long as they didn't have to speak to one another. Cas was fine with that.
Dean and Cas stared at each other for a bit, speaking silent words between them.
You care about everyone, and you feel as though they are your responsibility because that's how your father raised you. But it's not true. Dean, listen to me. Just talk to me."
Cas noticed, "You're safe here. No more running on your own."
After breakfast (not sure if you can call canned food a "breakfast"), they were back out on the road. Castiel picked up his pace, making sure Dean was able to keep up with him. They entered an area with a bunch of trees. It looked eerie and dark inside and Dean wasn't too sure.
Jody and Donna looked at Castiel, "Cas? Sam? Your thoughts?"
women. It really doesn't matter to me what kind of shit you've got hiding down under."
"But that's fucking YEARS ago, Cas," Dean said.
"This is so shit, dude," Dean whined. As the roar of the storm became louder and louder, the rain continued to thump down on them at a tremendous force. Dean winced at every crack of thunder.
Sam and Jack retreated to their room. Jack didn't sleep much so he let Sam wash up first. Sam grunted, got cleaned up, and crashed into the pillow before Jack could even close the bathroom door.
Dean bit his lips, "I'm acting like an annoying clingy girlfriend, aren't I?"
"You should sleep, I'll heal you when I can." Cas sat upright a little, even though he was very tired himself.
"We'll have to burn-" Cas was interrupted when Maggie turned on her heels and started yelling at him and Dean.
We could have had it all if the CW weren't such massive cowards ah well.
Cas gasped, because he was there, staring at Dean Winchester who was standing before him with a bruised face, busted up lips, torn jackets, and jeans, and an angel blade weighing in his experienced hands.
Lucifer wiggled his eyebrows playfully, "oh come on Dean! I'm not blind. I noticed how you two look at each other when you think the other isn't watching. And not to mention, Castiel gets
Cas rolled his eyes dramatically, "Your very existence makes me happy, Dean."
"You're okay?" He asked.
"Hey, come back to bed with me. Sam's passed out and Jack's having some Harry Potter movie marathon. Stay with me, we can have our own movie marathon," Dean said. He wasn't sure if he was pushing his luck this time, but Cas just shrugged and agreed.
Dean took a swing out of his beer, "The same old, you know. He's not good, Sam."
"Couldn't sleep," he muttered, rubbing his eyes.
"I am not. Although I wish I was. She quickly realised that you were my greatest weakness, and she tried to use it against me. She would train me, day in day out. At first, I couldn't do it. I couldn't kill you, even though I knew it wasn't you at all. I knew it was a fake version, but I couldn't do it. She forced my hand, Dean. Over and over again. I think it was around the 600th Fake Dean when I could kill you without breaking down," Cas sounded so devastated and Dean despised it, "Even so, I think Naomi knew I was resisting. So, she kept going. Putting you and me in different scenarios, forcing me to kill you."
-------------------
-----
"You were hurt."
"Damnit Cas, just do it," Dean shot back.
Dean sighed, "Yeah, man, I don't get it either. Anyways, what did you mean about how I was yours the moment you saved me from hell? What was all that about?"
"Then what do we do? I don't want to get stuck here, although this place does seem rather nice," Jack said gazing around the room.
"Wait, hold up. How do you even know who we are?" Sam asked.
"Jesus not here Lucifer," The detective sighed and grabbed his hand dragging him into a different room and indicating the boys to follow.
Jack frowned, "the human soul? But that's impossible…
Dean reached forward, pointing, "Oh shit you're hurt." He was about to hold her right arm and help but Maze pulled back defensively.
"Alright, what the hell is going on here?" Dean asked. Cas let go of Dean.
A wake of panic overcame Dean. He immediately rolled off the bed and went to Cas, hand at his shoulder.
Jody looked so shocked at Dean's words, and even Donna had her mouth hanging open. They all knew Dean and Castiel's relationship was all sorts of complicated, but they knew Dean would never speak to Cas like that.
"Lucifer we can have this conversation later okay? We’re in the middle of a case so please focus," the woman said clearly very annoyed.
Dean stuttered when he spoke, "no dad. Cas is my friend. We're not- it's not like that."
"Everyone here knows that's not happening," Cas said in a low dangerous voice.
Dean looked down, "Yeah, pretty much. He said we couldn't be like that."
Inias gazed at Cas, raising an eyebrow, "Sam would never agree to it."
When Cas laughed, he felt the angel's muscles and body move up and down, "Yeah, and you love me," Cas replied nonchalantly.
Lucifer glanced around searching, "where's your kid?" Dean felt his heart drop for a second as he called out for Jack.
Cas nodded again, smiling. Dean waited, watching Cas again. But his mind wandered, thinking about the way Cas didn't seem to mind that their legs were still mangled up. Or that Dean's head was still on Cas's arm. Or that Cas's hand was resting on Dean's shoulder. Or that Dean was still watching him. It was a calming silence.
Dean did not wake up in the bunker the next day.
That was all Dean needed to hear to turn around right on time to see two leviathans fall right beside them. Cas swung his machete at lightning speed, as one of the leviathans flung himself towards Cas. The angel grunted and fought back. But the leviathan was strong. He saw Dean struggling on the ground as the other monster had Dean pinned to the floor. After going in circles for a bit, Cas ducked expertly, swinging his machete to decapitate the monster. He immediately sprinted to Dean who was struggling to get the leviathan off him. Cas didn't think twice when he swung his machete, absolutely butchering the monster by cutting his head off. Dean heaved on the ground, clutching his heart. His eyes met Castiel's. Cas offered a hand, but Dean waved it off and stood up by himself.
"We've lost too many good men in the battlefield for Dean," Inias said slowly.
Dean sighed, "uh yeah. It's just, these are a bunch of kids, you know? Except for that Magnus guy."
"Let me try," Jack said, and he placed his left hand on Dean's forehead. The light travelled from Jack's hands to Dean's face, and they watched as Dean's wound healed completely.
Sam sprinted into the face of danger as he always did. He grabbed the flare out of his jacket pocket, "hey ugly." He smirked at the wendigo, grabbing his attention.
Cas's mouth fell open a little. He finally understood why Dean had been struggling so much more than he had anticipated. Cas died, trying to save Jack. Cas died, but Jack lived. Jack was a constant reminder of everything Dean had lost. His mother, his friend, his hope, his faith.
touch, Dean." You don't raise your voice against John Winchester, Dean knew that. Cas was screwed, but at the same time, Dean felt a little rush of pride watching Cas stand up for him. It also sent a wave of fear tingling his skin.
Dean smiled, "No. I always believed in you." Cas reached out, holding Dean's face in his hands and healed the rest of the wounds on Dean's face and body.
"Wait, Dean, we just stepped into a whole other world we know nothing about. Let's just be careful," Sam replied to which Castiel agreed. Dean huffed annoyed his delightful plans were crushed. Meanwhile, Jack watched as the tall, handsome man passed them. He fixed his suit with a blonde-haired lady strutted by his side. They squabbled and hurried down the sidewalk.
Dean shifted and turned around in his bed, the perfect peaceful dream turning into one of his worst memories.
After perhaps 30 minutes, Sam's phone rang and he jumped awake, the blanket dropping to the floor. Dean looked up.
"Just one more minute. You're so comfortable, angel," Dean grumbled into Cas's chest. Cas rolled his eyes, but then after a minute exactly, he shook Dean again.
The next morning, Cas had a sudden gut feeling that they would make it. When Dean woke up, legs still around Cas's waist, his chest against Cas, he groaned, still weary.
I recommend listening to "If your prayers don't get to heaven" by Brian Fallon while reading this chapter because the music really sets to tone and vibe for this chapter :)
Cas paused, taking a sharp breath in. When Dean didn't reply, Cas moved so that he was finally facing the hunter, "Dean, we're fighting a war. We don't have time for things like this. For… a relationship."
The slow music droned on. Dean asked Cas to dance to which he agreed. Dean pulled Cas into the dance floor, ignoring the staring and judgmental faces.
Fun Trivia: The Hidden Reality by Brian Greene is an actual real book about parallel universes that explores the multiverse theory. I haven't read it bc I ain't got the brains for quantum physics but if that's your lane, check it out; it sounds cool :)
He fastened the door shut, and darkness engulfed him wholly. His mind went through everything that happened. Dean closed his eyes, unable to comprehend that Cas was really gone for good this time. He had let his anger and rage overrule his head and his heart. He was blinded by his pain, and he didn't realise Cas was hurting just as much, if not more. Cas had lost his son, had to burn off Jack's body to prevent Belphegor from taking over hell. He had tried to talk, but all Dean did was drive him away. There was no going back this time. Dean let out a shaky breath and let his head fall back.
"No Dean, I meant- I was the one who put those walls up in the first place," Cas said. Cas saw the confused expression on Dean's face so he explained everything like how he told Sam and Jack only a few moments ago. Dean went "well shit" before going completely quiet. The silence was agonizing.
All was well. God was locked up, the world was safe and the majority of monsters were gone. Sam and Eileen had become closer than ever, but Dean and Castiel were still facing their never-ending array of obstacles. After Dean had prayed to Cas in purgatory, Dean had hoped that things would go back to normal, but it didn't. The tension was still there even though neither of them brought it up. Dean had wanted to say more, to tell Cas how much he really meant to him, but he never knew how to start that conversation so he just kept it under the rug.
Dean was about to leave when Cas grabbed his hand, "Please, talk to me. Just talk. I don't want to fight with you, Dean." His voice softened.
"Wait, how old are you guys anyway?" Dean asked.
"I don't matter, Cas." It was a simple sentence but it hit Castiel like a shit-ton of bricks.
Cas felt the fury and anger boiling inside him, "Why the fuck do you never talk to me? All I do is try to be there for you, but you just keep pushing me away. Why?"
"They think Dean is a distraction for you. And they want to kick him out," Inias said.
"Cas, what's going on?" Jack asked.
Meanwhile, Claire found Dean throwing punches at some boxing bags at the training grounds.
Thank you for reading! Hope y'all enjoyed this little fic, I enjoyed writing it so much!
The angel finally looked up and their eyes met. Dean felt like Cas was staring into his probably broken and fractured soul. There was a heat that travelled up Dean's spine and all over his body. It was always like this when he looked at Cas, or especially when he would catch Cas staring at
mentions other universes," Cas said slamming the book shut out of frustration. Dean leaned on Lucifer's piano watching Cas get up and move around stretching his arms.
I have given you everything, Dean. I have given you my love, my heart, my LIFE, and this is what you give to me? We're
However, Cas wasn't done, "I will always do my best to keep you safe, Dean."
angel."
slow.
Cas noticed what Dean was doing and immediately went to his side.
What do y'all think of the Magnus/Dean friendship? I wanted to explore more of their dynamic bc I think it's a fun interesting one.
Castiel wanted to cry. He wanted to hug Dean, hold him and never let go. But the world around them was burning. There was a tremendous loud blast above them, and the ceiling started to collapse. Dean reacted first, grabbing Cas's hands and pulling them out of the room. Dean ran, pulling Cas with him until they came to a clearing.
Dean grinned and shook his head lightly, "Idiot." Cas smiled fondly.
Once they were back at the castle, it was late afternoon and the sun was setting majestically over their small town. Cas followed Dean into his room and waited as Dean threw him a change in clothes. After Cas cleaned up, they went for dinner, and Cas was delighted to see Jack again.
Dean shook his head, "I'm done. I'm done with you. I'm done with this. I'm done with everything. Fuck you, fuck everything."
Dean gulped, "I can't take back what I did to you. How I hurt you, and what I said. But I want to make things right.”
Cas smiled a little at the comment, "it's nice to meet you, Magnus. I hope we can all get along."
Cas straightened his back, "I'm sorry I made things worse for you."
Cas grinned, "Me too. She's so much like you, it's scary."
When they reached the town, they hunted together. Cas spoke when he had to, and Dean only replied with short answers. When Dean nearly got shredded to pieces by a vampire, Cas was the one who saved him. This time, Dean didn't thank him. When Cas offered a hand, Dean didn't take it. They went on like this, hunting and fighting together but not saying a word to one another until the vampires were all dead.
Dean was stone cold and unable to gather his thoughts.
"Don't die".
"No, it's okay. I haven't seen you around here. I'm Ella!" The girl grinned extending her hand.
"Were you worried?" Cas asked perplexed. He looked at Dean up and down, a smile formulating when he saw that Dean was wearing his spare clothes.
"Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt," Dean snapped back. Dean couldn't stay annoyed at Cas for too long, because the feeling of Cas's gentle fingers touching his rougher and already worn out ones, was sending heat and fire down his body.
Cas rolled his eyes, "you know I don't go down that easy." Cas placed a soft kiss on Dean's cheek, "stop worrying your ass about me, Dean. I'll be fine. Just go with Sam. He'll look after you."
"Hold on! You trust them?" Dean said, immediately, pointing his finger at them accusingly.
Sam smiled a little, "Dean, I'm serious. You can call him or text him. But you can't see him. The power inside Cas has already grown and gotten stronger from the 3 meetings you've already had. It's too much already."
"Dean? What's going on?" Sam asked.
"Anything I can help with?" Dean asked.
"Thank fucking god," Alec muttered.
Cas replied, monotonously, "I guess we'll know when we see it."
After Dean got himself together, he looked at Sam. Sam noticed his red eyes, the puffy pink nose, Dean's messy hair, and Sam just
"I've been having nightmares. Hell, dad, losing you, losing Sam, Lucifer, Michael, the apocalypse- the whole clusterfuck," Dean said. He looked up at Cas, who had the most sympathetic look on his face.
A week passed by in a flash, Sam and Dean trying to help Rowena in whatever way they could. Most of the time it was Sam bickering with Rowena about some spell and ingredients, and Dean couldn't stand the both of them. Dean wanted to hunt. His fingers twitched and craved for a hunt, his mind wanted to return to work, his muscles wanted to get back into a fight. But of course, Sam wanted Dean to rest. It was a never-ending cycle.
“Dean, I’m worried about you,” Cas said. Dean heard Cas’s voice in his ear, it was gentle and quiet but concerned.
Lucifer passed over his drink, which Dean gladly accepted, and took a swing of.
It was a clearing with mowed grass in the centre and a massive rusty old gate on the opposite end, leading to the rest of the forest. Castiel and Dean stepped forward, instinctively trying to get to the gate to see what it was, but Cas stopped, putting a warning hand in front of Dean. He narrowed his eyes, scanning the area. Dean heard what the angel's ears had picked up before he could. It was the sound of a gun cocking.
"So, how are you holding up?" Sam asked.
Dean took a long shower while Cas checked up on Jack. He was tired and confused but overall the kid was doing fine. Jack told Cas about meeting Ella and her little maggot story which confused Cas immensely.
The room Jody showed them to, was small yet comfortable. She passed Dean a change of clothes, asking him to leave his dirty ones for her to wash up. Cas just used his grace to clean up to which Jody replied with an exasperated,
David pursed his lips, "When we first met Castiel, he was a soldier. He fought and did what he had to do. But we risked so many of us to find
Dean shrugged, "No promises, but hey, at least this time I've got my angel. Keep in touch, Sammy."
"Jace, check Izzy," Alec muttered. When Jace went to check on Isabelle, Magnus sprinted out the door to find Clary.
Dean saw all of Cas's visible muscles tense. Castiel hated John Winchester with a burning passion.
Dean frowned, slowly forcing his eyes open, "You're no fun, you know that?" When he pulled away, his lips brushed against Cas's jawline accidentally. Cas simply ignored it.
“No, Cas, I’m starting to remember. I don’t remember what I said, but I remember what I did. How I punched you until you were bloody and broken. I was so…
"Better. He should be waking up soon," Cas said.
Most of the cuts and bruises had healed but there were still a few more. Cas watched Dean grumble something as his hands lazily slipped inside the trenchcoat. Naturally, Cas didn't mind. In fact, he liked having Dean this close. Even if it was only for one night.
-------------------
Dean blushed, smiling lightly, "Sorry. I thought you were asleep."
The afternoon drew in. The maids got the brothers ready for the ball, fussing over Sam's hair, and Dean's suit. They talked about how Dean would find his perfect match from this ball and Dean wanted to scream. When the brothers walked into the ballroom, the room fell silent in respect.
The next day, Cas and a few others went out on a monster hunt. Cas wanted to get out a little away from the others, and by others, he meant Dean. Castiel found it suffocating and unbearable being in the same room as Dean. So when the opportunity to go on a hunt without the Winchester brothers arose, Castiel took it. They left at dawn, well before the sun rose, and was planned to return in the evening. It was meant to be a quick hunt, nothing serious, a bunch of werewolves. But naturally, something always goes wrong.
Cas's face flushed.
Alec grabbed Cas's arm, "Get Dean out of here, and back into the Impala. Clary and Sam go with them." Nobody argued with Alec. Dean was trying to speak and stand up but he was too weak. He wasn't bleeding anymore, but he was rocking back and forth from consciousness to wakefulness. Huge crashes of boxes falling and metal clanging to one another could be heard as the battle commenced.
His eyes started to sting and his knuckles still screamed for attention.
Dean closed his eyes, “Fuck. I have to go. I’m-“ he looked at Cas, “I’m so sorry.”
"What?" Sam asked in a small voice.
Dean narrowed his eyes at Sam, "Shut your piehole, Sammy." But Dean didn't hear his brother whisper
Dean rolled his eyes, "Good talk, brother." He ruffled Sam's hair playfully and stumbled out of the room.
"Leave your bags with me, and go sleep. You'll need the rest. I'll come to find you in the morning. We can say our goodbyes to Sam and anyone else you want," Cas said. Dean sighed.
Cas's eyes light up as he saw Dean trying to sit upright.
, if there's something I can do about it!" Dean yelled.
"Alternate universe?" Maze asked directing her attention to Dean, "that's bullshit."
Dean nodded, and Cas walked in, watching Dean close the door behind him.
"Hey there, champ. You're going to owe me big time," Magnus said, with a small smile. Dean didn't bother replying. He watched as Magnus muttered something no one understood, and purple sparks flew out of his hands and directly into Dean. It was odd. When Castiel healed him, he always felt a rush of something cool coursing through his body. But Magnus's magic was warm. It was warm, and delicate, a little fiery as it stung.
Dean and Jack said their goodnights and took off to go to their rooms to clean up and crash for the night because they damn well deserved it.
"It's great to see you, Cas," Dean muttered smiling, as they drove away.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can get through this, Cas. No matter what happens I'll fight through it. If I break or go out of my damn mind, I- I trust you'll know what to do," Dean replied. Dean wanted to kick himself for being a stuttering mess but he couldn't help it when Cas was looking at him like that with his sad blue eyes.
"Dean, you've got to control yourself," Cas said quickly, placing a hand on Dean's jacket. But Dean just pushed Cas away leaving him standing alone.
Sam rolled his eyes, "You're a
"I know. David can't be reasoned with, you know this. I've tried to keep him in check for months, but he's proven to be resistant. The only way around this is if I leave with Dean," Cas waited, watching Sam's angry facial expressions warp into shock.
After a while, Sam ended the call with a grin on his face.
Dean went up to Cas, "And you remember what I told you? I said I need you. And- Cas- it still stands true."
Dean put his head to his hands, "And to think I just wanted to take him on a fucking date."
Castiel rolled his eyes as if it were obvious, "Dean surely you figured it out by now? I am your guardian angel. I always have been. Why do you think the angels assigned me to drag your ass out of hell during our apocalypse days? Why do you think you were so closely bonded to me?"
look that Dean absolutely detested, "
Cas's eyes never faltered. And that was when Dean completely caved in. He leaned a little closer and placed his lips gently on Cas. Cas was taken aback, made a small surprised noise as Dean's lips pressed against his. But when he realised what was happening, he quickly kissed back.
“I helped you heal, but the rest of the healing is up to you, okay? I’ll leave you alone now,” Cas said. He squeezed Dean’s shoulder reassuringly and left.
"I know. And it's okay. I understood your messages," Cas said. Dean looked at Cas, mesmerised by the intense blue in his eyes. He saw the pain and exhaustion behind Castiel’s eyes and felt a wrench of guilt at the back of his throat.
"I want to make it to that camp before nightfall, so get up," Cas replied.
Dean's breath got stuck in his throat and suddenly he felt like he couldn't breathe. His vision started to blur, and his heart started to speed up. He remembered the whole conversation now. It had started with this itch he couldn’t scratch, the spell slowly breaking lose inside him.
"I guess we finished the story," Cas said, glancing back at Dean.
Sam smirked, trying his damn best not to turn it into a full-on grin. Jack seemed unbothered.
Cas nodded sternly, "Dean was on the far end opposite this camp, I believe. He wouldn't have run into your camp here. And yes, I searched and I found him."
"Hey Dean," Sam answered.
Dean laughed, relaxing his muscles again, "I know, Cas. Just leave me something behind so I can find you again."
Cas shifted his duffle bag to his other hand, "Well for one, she's stubborn and has a hot temper. But she's kind, and she cares a lot. She loves passionately and wholly. She sees the world in a way a lot of people don't, in a way adults don't. She's a fighter too. She broke her arm once and when I offered to heal her, she stopped me and she said "No. I want my body to heal on its own so I can become stronger." Her mother thought she was insane."
"Well, this is new," Cas said, forming a small smile. His shoulders slackened.
Dean twisted and turned around in his bed, clutching his pillow tightly as what he thought were dreams sprawled his mind. Not dreams, but more like memories all morphing together one after another.
There was a yell and a very loud "HELP!" which both Sam and Dean recognised was Jack's voice. Dean surged forward but Sam caught his arm, tugging him back, "they can mimic human voices remember? This could be a trap."
"We'll figure this out, okay?" Dean was gentle, but he saw that it was useless. Cas was daunted.
"Cas if it's okay with you, can I see your wings again?" Dean asked a bit hesitantly. Castiel looked up at him and stood up doing that little confused head tilt he does.
I hope y'all are enjoying the story so far!
"Can you rebuild those walls?" Sam asked quietly.
-------------------
Sam was absolutely thrilled to see his brother and Castiel, but even more so excited to see Jody and the girls again. It had been too long until they were all reunited together, under the same roof. Too damn long. Donna accompanied Sam's team to their new "dorms" where they would be sleeping, with David flashing a quick smug look at Dean as he strolled by. Inias came to the sidelines to talk to Castiel.
"Are you having a meeting without me? Okay, wow
"Then why did you do it? Apocalypse Cas was all work and no play- daddy's little perfect soldier. You didn't give two shits about what happened to me back then. You even threatened to send my dumb ass back to hell. So, why bother keeping this trauma away from me?" Dean asked. It was the one question Cas had hoped he wouldn't ask.
"You good, Cas?" Dean asked. He untangled their hands and placed his hand on the angel's thighs, under the table, instead. Cas nodded silently and muttered a small "thank you" to Dean.
"What's happening to me, Cas?" Dean asked, now gasping as if his trachea had constricted, and he couldn't get enough air into his lungs.
“I can heal you, make you feel, better.”
Sam broke off from Rowena, sprinting towards Castiel, shaking him awake. Dean laid on the ground, watching his brother try to wake up the angel.
"Oh, uh, nothing."
Sam, Dean and Castiel arrived at their motel and Sam dumped their duffle bag onto the floor near his bed with a massive huff.
Dean arrived at Lux with Jack and found Cas with a glass of whiskey in his hand. Cas looked up with drooping eyes, "finally."
"Which is exactly why you need to find him and apologise. You need to communicate with him! He's been more than a friend to you, this whole time, but you've been too much of an idiot to see it. I'm gonna go check for any more ghost or apocalyptic shit. You go find Cas, and bring him home before it's too late," Sam glared at his brother before he grabbed his cup, and stormed out of the room.
Cas pressed two fingers onto Dean's forehead but couldn't heal him.
, remember?"
Dean's mind raced as the pain etched through him,
Rowena started by adding some ingredients that Sam had crushed before this and began chanting. Sam joined in, holding Rowena's small and delicate hands in his massive ones, adding one ingredient after another with his free hand.
"You know why," he replied, almost whispering.
Another girl stumbled into the scene. She was blonde, and she looked paler than ever.
Dean knew, there was no way in seven hells, that he was letting his brother risk his life so he didn't want to bring it up again. They would talk it out the next day.
Cas gazed at Dean desperately searching for answers in Dean's eyes.
"Yeah, me. Use me as bait. Lure Michael out from wherever the fuck he is, and we hit him when he's distracted," Dean said like it was so obvious.
stick with a Shadowhunter, as they aren't equipped to fight this demon, like we are. Sam will stay with Clary, Castiel with Alec going from the back. Jace and Isabelle will go from the front and try to distract the demon. I'll go from the back as well, and try to rescue Dean first. Once we know Dean is safe, then I'll gladly send her ass back to hell," Magnus said with a menacing smile at the end.
"Holy shit, Cas?" Dean put the angel blade back into his jacket, and sprinted over to Cas, wrapping his arms around the angel, "it's you."
"Oh right, sorry," Dean muttered. He watched the others pull a body out of the back. Dean's heart fell, as he realised that was probably Rosaline.
"You should head back to the motel Cas. Sammy and I will take care of this. You've already done enough," Dean said.
"Castiel, I like Dean. He's stubborn and annoying sometimes, but the man has a lot of heart and fight in him. Dean has tried to get along with him but David won't change. They want to plan a meeting with everyone tomorrow, they're just waiting for Dean to wake up," Inias said.
"I could ask the same thing about you and Castiel," Lucifer said openly, throwing the same dilemma right back at Dean.
Sam was called in and he looked baffled.
Cas was taken aback, "Dean…"
"I mean,
Cas was stumbling in the dark as he tried to make his way over to Jack.
After a few minutes, Sam found Dean on the side of the road, throwing up still. It was the third time Dean had thrown up his guts all over the ground. Sam went over and helped his brother.
Song for the chapter:
Cas looked down, upset, "it wasn't me. I couldn't heal you. It was Jack."
to finally meet you," Cas said, pulling out a hand that John refused to shake. Cas, awkwardly, stuffed his hands into the pocket of his coat. He should at least
Dean droned out the murmurs and made himself comfortable next to Cas.
"Jody? Donna?" Dean asked, his voice breaking halfway. Donna, who was wearing her brown leather jacket with a shotgun in her hands, caught Cas in a tight warm hug, while Jody buried Dean in her arms.
Dean went to the kitchen, made his own coffee this time, and had leftover food from last night. He tried not to think about the way Cas always hummed a tune when he cooked, or how Cas always smelled like the morning dew. Sometimes, if he had been out and about late at night, Cas would smell like fresh Earth, refreshing and welcoming. Dean always loved watching Cas cook in the mornings- it was peaceful, and both of them enjoyed each other's company.
Sam said, eyes shifting from Dean to Cas.
Alec smacked his parabatai in the head, "Will you shut up? If anything happens to Dean, that's on us."
Cas turned to look at him. He placed his maps and things down, and walked over to Dean, "You have nothing to be sorry about, Dean Winchester."
"I'm here to pick up Chloe. Where is she?" Maze asked scratching and pulling at a small slowly bleeding wound on her arm that Dean noticed only now.
"Cas, no. You're their leader, you can't just leave. I'll go, it's nothing I haven't done a thousand times-"
they were.
," Alec remarked, putting away his arrow.
"Yeah."
After a second he wrote,
Sam grabbed Cas's phone, opened notes and typed out the book and author quickly before the information sprinted out of his short term memory slot. Cas snatched his phone back and looked at the note, tilting his head confused.
Dean turned to face his brother, quietening his voice, "I know, Sammy. I'll get us back home."
"So, they got jumped by a few of Michael's monsters. Out of the first group we sent on the hunt, two out of five are dead. The second group is bringing everyone in. They'll be here by late evening."
"I don't think there is Sam. I just wanted you to know," Cas said quietly. He looked at Dean, brushing a hand over Dean's.
"You don't get to spend months hating me and wishing I was dead, and then suddenly show a spark of interest now," Cas said bitterly.
"Oh my god," Sam said also watching. Jack came up beside Sam, gaping.
Cas helped him but Dean, in classic Dean style, accidentally cut his palm while trying to pick up one of the pieces.
Cas knew Dean hated the crash and boom of thunder. Years ago, when there were thunderstorms in Lebanon Cas had asked, "Why are you so afraid?"
he thought.
He told his fellow Shadowhunter friends their situation and Jace huffed, "he had one job."
We see how the camp changes and evolves as Sam takes up his place as the leader.
The warehouse inside was relatively empty albeit its name. It was more of a barn. There were large shelves of god knows what on either side. There were hooks in the middle that Dean was tied to using metal handcuffs, and a beautiful gorgeous woman standing beside the bleeding hunter. She was wearing a long black dress, her black hair flowing effortlessly down her back. She was smirking at Jace and Isabelle, who had already entered.
Dean muttered a small "goodnight" back and hurriedly left the room. Cas stared back at him. He felt a weird weight in his left pocket and pulled out a note that read,
"I just feel helpless. It's my job to keep you safe- to protect you. What's the point of being with you, if I can't do this
Dean frowned,
"He was, but they headed back only a few long hours ago. Come on inside, we'll catch up." Claire indicated, leading Dean and Cas through the massive gates. They walked through a few shrubs and trees until they came face to face with a huge stone building perhaps the size of a factory itself. They entered the building and Dean's nerves immediately calmed down as another familiar face rushed to his arms.
"Oh, thank God!" Sam said.
Dean's head flickered up, "What are you talking about?"
"We always have been," Cas smirked, "you can stay with me tonight if you want. I don't know if I'll be sleeping much with everything going on, but you can sleep here."
Dean wanted to scream. He wanted Cas to be angry at him because it would make all of this so much easier. But instead, Cas was here, calmly reassuring Dean the way he always does.
"It's the last time I swear," Dean said. Cas looked at the flowers, feeling the soft velvet touch of the petals.
"Oh yeah, because you're one for hope right?" said Cas, bitter and annoyed.
Dean looked at Cas quickly, but Cas beat him to it, "Dean summoned me after I rescued him from hell... then he stabbed me in the chest."
Dean eyed him carefully, but as Alec lowered his weapon, so did Dean.
"Sorry. I wasn't there, I don’t know," Sam replied. Dean cursed, blinking out the tears, and threw his phone across the room which shocked Sam. He stormed out without another word. Sam watched the pieces of Dean’s phone where it shattered and remained battered on the floor.
"You have a strange way of showing your appreciation, Dean Winchester," Cas said walking up to Dean, "Most people would, you know, talk it out. But you, you talk through notes and flowers." Cas leaned against the counter, watching Dean intensely.
"Sam, take Dean to base. Give him one of the free rooms, get Kristy to cook him a good meal, and give him some of my extra clothes. I think they'll fit him better than your
Dream on- Aerosmith
"You heard right," Cas said, now smiling because of how insane it all sounded, "Dean was in hell, and I was asked to save him. A few other angels and I stormed in, and I managed to rescue him. But it was too late. Dean was already tormenting souls; I couldn't get to him fast enough."
" Cas said. Dean closed his eyes because the voice of Cas begging (and not in a sexy way) was too much.
"Shadowhunters, always a pleasure. Let me introduce myself. Hecate," She said, with a little bow.
Let me know what you think!
"Come on," Cas said, beckoning Dean to follow. Dean did exactly what Cas did but he nearly missed his footing at the end. He was about to fall into the stream when Cas immediately reached over and grabbed Dean before he could fall.
It's a slow start I know, bare with me, I'm going through one of those days lmao
"He said he felt like he was missing someone important in his life. Even though his mind doesn't remember you, I think his heart does. I don't know how long we can keep this up, Dean's not an idiot," Sam sighed, running his hand through his floppy tangled hair.
"Hey, Sammy. Cas and I talked it out. I'm doing this," he said coming to a stop in front of his brother.
Cas's eyes went wide as he frowned, "I told him not to tell you."
They were on their fifth house when they heard a scream in the distance. Their natural hunter instincts kicked in immediately. Sam and Dean's guards from the palace, were thrown off guard when the brothers sprinted into danger. A young woman was laying on the ground looking terrified as another older lady with a maroon dress stood over her in the empty alleyway.
If I suffer, y'all suffer with me :)))
"So, are ya gonna finish these pancakes or what?" Dean asked, breaking the tension easily with his humour. Cas shrugged, pushing the plate towards Dean, who gratefully just ate the whole damn thing.
Jody put a gentle hand on Claire's back, "You're right, but-"
Cas smiled, playing with Dean's hair nonchalantly, easing Dean's nerves a little. He put a hand on the back of Dean's neck before pressing his lips into Dean's softly. The fireworks went off in the background but Dean was too occupied to notice the colours bursting in the sky above them. Neither of them heard the loud bursts of sound as the fireworks crackled. It was as if they had entered a world of their own, cancelling out everything else around them. Dean kissed back, squeezing his grip on Cas's waist as his lips explored Cas's for the first time. It was invigorating and intoxicating, but it was something they both needed. Cas lifted himself a little on his feet to pull himself closer to Dean, deepening the kiss. It was Dean who pulled away first, only to see Cas beaming at him. The sudden sounds of the fireworks came back to them, as Cas gazed up at the sky, arms still hooked around the hunter. Dean did not give two shits about the fireworks because the brightest work of art was standing right before him.
-------------------
Lucifer, now pissed and annoyed, clenched his fists together, "Dean you stay here. I've got some unfinished business to take care of." And with that Lucifer quickly crossed the small street to the man, grabbed and bent his gun upwards which then rendered useless and sent a punch flying to his bearded jaw.
Cas put his hands over Dean's, "Dean, we need to finish the story."
look up. Cas
Dean found Cas in his room cleaning up.
"You know where we're going?" Dean asked. The forest was dark and where the leaves were parted to the side, the sun shone down on them in small patches.
-------------------
Love, longing, desire.
"CASTIEL!" The step-mom screeched and Castiel stumbled into the room. He had taken off his jacket now and Dean could see all of Cas's muscles prodding out. That was when he realised they barely saw Cas without his layers of clothing. Cas stepped forward quietly, and Dean offered him a pen and paper.
"Although I seem to be doing a pretty terrible job of keeping you safe lately. You can't be tamed Dean Winchester," Castiel continued with a stupid smirk as he began to walk away.
"He- he didn't want to come back," Dean said quietly.
"Dean?" Cas said holding Dean's face in his hands delicately. He made sure the hunter was alive and well. He felt a pulse at the side of Dean's neck.
Dean glared at him and Cas saw his eyes glisten, "They can't do this to you." Dean glared at David, pointing a finger at him as he said, "
Sam looked at Dean, speaking silent words between them, "Not yet, Jack. But hopefully soon."
Anyways, song suggestion for this chapter:
Alec looked appalled, but Magnus howled with laughter, "you didn't!"
"Chloe!" She yelled scanning the room for the detective trying to get past Dean.
Sam, Dean and Rowena waited. The field was an empty one indeed, stretching for miles, far and wide. Sam helped arrange and prepare the ingredients, while Rowena went over the spell one last time. Dean meanwhile paced back and forth restlessly.
," the woman said smirking in a way that made Dean feel very uneasy and uncomfortable.
"Cas how is it that your wings... bleed?" Dean asked genuinely confused.
"So what now?" Jack asked, a little confused, "Has the story ended yet?"
"You need to rest, Dean," Cas said quietly.
Jack nodded in response while Dean grabbed their duffle-bag. Lucifer waved to Jack, "see you around, kid." And Jack smiled and waved back with a huge grin on his face.
"Guys, this is Castiel. Cas, these are some people from an alternate world," Dean said. Cas looked at him a little confused but unfazed nonetheless. "They hunt demons and a few of their demons have entered our world, so they're here to help kill them."
Dean seized the heavy book the angel had set in front of him, "Jack, you can get started on the others." Jack nodded pulling out a book from the shelf. Dean sat opposite his angel friend.
kick him to the curb. I'll leave with Dean, we mean no harm. We don't want to start a fight. Sam will take over- he knows how to lead, how to run this place, how to fight and he knows Michael just as well as I do," Cas said firmly.
"I can deal with all of that just fine. What hurt most is being away from you and Sam," Dean stared down at his shoes.
sword, which fought back five times tougher. The witch walked forward twirling her fingers, enhancing her magic making it harder for Sam and Dean to fight the enchanted sword. And then the sword suspended in the air unmoving for a few seconds before dropping to the floor with a loud clang. Dean glanced up to see Cas standing behind the witch with his angel blade piercing right through her heart. The witch lifelessly crumpled to the floor. Sam sighed, catching his breath and went to check on the young woman who was thanking him non-stop. Dean stared back at Cas, a little proud.
Dean followed Sam's eyes and saw Baby, his beautiful 1967 Chevrolet Impala. When they reached the car, Dean grazed his hands over the impala, "Oh sweetheart, how I've missed you."
"Your brother gave it to me. Anyway, Sam, I have this friend called Maze who's a demon- don't ask- but I told her about your situation. She told me to tell you to check out this book called,
Sam rolled his eyes, "Alright. I'm gonna go check up on the others. Cas, look after Dean."
Dean looked at his angel for a second, wondering whether to say "I'm fine" again or to tell the truth this time. But Cas knew when he was lying, he always did. And most of the time, Cas just let it slide because he knew not to push Dean too much.
Dean opened his eyes to a bustling street ahead of him. Castiel followed suit with Sam and Jack close behind him looking equally baffled and taken aback. Jack coughed and Sam patted him on the back.
"You know why, Castiel. To remove Dean Winchester," David said.
After they had their meals, they found a cheap motel to crash in. They paid for 2 small rooms: one with 2 single beds and one with a double bed and you can guess who slept where.
"Damnit, Cas! I can't- won't leave you again," Dean said, desperately. Cas looked at Dean, seeing the past year's worth of pain and loss engraved onto his face.
"Dean, we need to talk about what just happened," Cas said. Dean remained quiet, taking a sudden interest in his shoes.
think I was going to just get along with that man? He's a monster," Cas disapproved.
song recommendation bc this song is so beautiful and it just reminds me of deancas so much:
Dean's mind was spiralling and he didn't know what to do or say. The only thing he could focus on was Cas holding his hand and how fucking
Cas pursed his lips, turning his back and left the room without another word.
"Part angel, part human? In our world, that's a Nephilim," Sam said, trying to piece it together.
Let It Burn - Citizen Soldier
"I'll try my best," Dean hooked his fingers into Cas's belt, gently pulling him in, "I'll try to make you happy."
"Will you stop being a dick to me? I am trying to
"You told me I was dead to you. I'm just your weapon. I don't want to be your weapon anymore. Please, just get the flowers to Michael," Cas said, taking a few steps back.
"Do you have… anyone else living here?" Dean asked politely.
-------------------
"Absolutely not-"
Dean nodded, “He just knows I get fucking nauseated every time we’re in the same fucking room.”
Dean coughed and started to wake up. His eyes fluttered open, and he was placid, staring up at the ceiling. They all watched him carefully. He turned his head to look at his brother holding his left hand, and the angel holding his right hand. Jack stood on the edge of Dean's bed, looking stunned.
Cas rolled his eyes, "I don't know all the details, but generally, yes." Dean laughed. Cas probably knew all his dirty little secrets and regrets, and he knew it should make him uncomfortable, but this was
Dean, without wavering, nodded, "I do."
Cas stood up, closing the book he was reading. He walked up to Dean but only just a little, "You called me a failure. You said I was the reason everything went wrong in your life. You said- you said everything I touch, I break, and that I poison everyone I love. You said a lot about how I was the worst person and how much you hated me."
"You good?" Dean asked.
"Tonight. I'll take you out for dinner. My treat of course. I want to know more about this little world of yours," Lucifer said with a hint of mischief in his eyes. Dean didn't know how to reply to that.
"I hate this," grumbled Sam.
"I think you had a small panic attack," Cas replied.
"Oh hey, kid. What's up?" Dean asked, massaging his injured fists as he stepped away from the mats.
Dean found Cas in his room, going through some old lore books. Cas was surprised to find Dean standing by the door, looking pale as though he had seen… well not a ghost, Dean would be thrilled to see a ghost, but perhaps something even worse.
"So, what? Do you think this pain is just going to disappear? You think this anger, confusion, the loss that you felt, is just going to grow some god damn legs and walk away? You think that pushing away your feelings, your feelings for me, is going to magically evaporate into thin air?" Cas fired back, equally enraged, "I have tried to talk with you, Dean. Every single time. But you just push me away."
Claire dropped her fork with a cling, "We don't know that! We don't know what happened to them!"
"I don't know. I was thinking we could keep moving south. That's where we heard there was civilisation last, so maybe there are some supplies left that we can gather."
"I need a drink," Dean muttered, but Sam looked at him like he lost his mind.
you tell him?" Dean asked. Cas bit his lips, now troubled.
"It's so good to see you, Cas," Dean whispered. All his nerves had disappeared now that Cas was by his side.
"You're hunters, and you know this world, we don't. We need to work together," Clary said.
The man's eyes softened, "I appreciate your offer, you seem… lovely. But I can't. I'm sorry. Have a nice day."
Michael frowned, "and you just accepted that? Bit of a dick, aren't you, Dean?"
look.
"Oh, these are runes. They give us special abilities like stamina, strength, healing, whatever. It helps us hunt demons better," Alec said. Dean looked pretty impressed.
"Nothing that's gonna put us, or our world, in danger, alright? Calm your panties, little brother," Dean snapped back.
," Dean begged in his sleep.
I know you hate his guts, but you're going to keep your trap shut. When you talk back to him, he's going to come after
Thank you for reading and for your support, it means the world!
His best friend. And sure, maybe Dean had developed a massive crush for him over the years, especially after Purgatory, but it was still
"Please do continue," Cas snarled back.
Dean sighed. He went to his room, pulled out his laptop and started to track Cas's phone. Cas was only a few towns away, and not moving. He could go and try to talk, but would he listen? Dean heard Sam's voice firing off in his head, and knew that he had to try.
"Yes, my grace was so low last night, I just needed to rest to replenish it but I'm better now. Thank you for asking."
Dean smiled, shaking his head. Cas frowned then, "But I'm not wearing a glass slipper, Dean."
So this is it. The End.
Cas seemed unbothered, "well, you've always had Sam."
and I fucking broke you. I can never forgive myself for that. You were good to me, Cas. You always came when I called, you always healed me up, you gave up an army for me, remember that? I don't hate you, it's- uh- it's actually the opposite."
Cas nodded, "Inias, prepare a small team. We'll leave to find Rosaline, dead or alive, in 10 minutes. The rest of you will return to base as planned." Inias nodded and rushed off. Cas turned, almost bumping headfirst into Dean, before quickly rushing off to his tent. He gathered his maps, but Dean stopped him.
When Dean winces, Cas just replies with, "stop whining, Dean. You've faced worse." Dean gave him a blank expression, unimpressed.
Maggie stormed up to Dean, poking her index finger into his chest accusingly, "why should Castiel put your life before my girlfriend? What are you to him?"
Dean has had Castiel by his side for 10 years, but when Castiel decides its time for him to move on, how will Dean cope?
"I want you, Cas. I think I always have, but it just- I just hid all my emotions and everything under the fucking rug because I didn't know how to deal with it. But then when you said that I said that I couldn't- lo-love you, I realised it wasn't true. I CAN love you. I WANT to love you. And I NEED you to know that," Dean said, now frowning and breathing hard, trying to get the words out somehow.
"So, it's the same spell, same ingredients and all, but instead of archangel grace, we use the human soul," Dean summarized.
"Sam-"
Dean shrugged, "Cas will probably have some answers. At least, I hope so."
After a while, he opened his eyes and gulped.
>>TW: homophobic slurs and language used<<
"Cas?" Dean's voice was utterly broken, "Cas, I remember. I remember everything. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
John was still staring at Cas, coldly, "so, you're friends with an
"And Sam, you two are rather close for brothers," Lucifer said objectively. Their drinks arrived- 2 glasses of water for Lucifer and Jack and one cup of coffee for Dean. Dean would rather die before having a glass of water.
"I don't need to eat. You do," said Cas. Dean shrugged and grabbed out a few packaged sandwiches, and a bottle of water. Dean chugged the water down, remembering to leave some for later, or for Cas. Once Cas was sure they were safe, he sat on the rock opposite Dean. Dean didn't look but continued to eat.
"Wait, where are you ladies off to?" Lucifer asked quickly.
Sam waited for Dean to disappear and he grabbed his phone and sent a simple text,
"Is that how you show your love, Dean? So, it was love at first sight, huh?" Lucifer pressed further, his smirk growing.
"Dean, listen to me," Cas said, taking some steps to bridge the gap between them, "I hear you, but this is going to take time to fix, to heal. But this is the most open you've ever been with me in the past 10 years. I know how hard this was for you, and I appreciate you coming out here to try to talk to me. I don't know if we can go back to how we were before, but I'm willing to try. Our relationship has been dragged through the mud before, but we always came out strong. But I can't do this if you won't communicate with me, Dean."
"I'm sorry Cas, I was wrong. I should have let you come, I should have listened to you damnit," Dean replied as the guilt crawled inside him. If he had just
"Well, that's a relief. Let me know if you feel unwell. Dean, we need to talk about what happened over there," Cas said, coming closer. Dean instinctively stepped back.
And just then, Dean stirred and very slowly opened his eyes.
"What is it, Clarissa?" Cas asked.
The anger simmered and boiled until it overcame him. Dean grabbed the lamp from his bedside table and threw it across the room. He took his books and ripped the pages apart, not giving two shits if any of it was important. Dean grabbed the closest thing he could find, and threw it to the ground, watching everything break and shatter. He screamed and he yelled until his voice went hoarse. He hated himself more than he ever did before. Dean punched the wall until it made a small dent, and his knuckles bled dry. Dean kicked and broke whatever he could find. Everything hurt down to his very core. He couldn't do it, the pain was overwhelming, and he felt like he lost Cas all over again.
Cas asked.
"Cas, there
"I must leave when the clock strikes midnight, unfortunately," Cas said after a pause. Dean's eyes went wide, and Sam looked at his brother putting the story together. Cas was Cinderella, I mean, was anyone surprised?
"I know, I get it. It's okay," Dean said quietly. Cas lowered his head, now almost at the door. He could read Dean like an open book and sometimes he wished he couldn't. Because at the moment, Cas knew Dean was not okay. That he was hurting, and pretending he was okay just for the sake of their friendship.
you underestimated your enemies. You could have gotten yourself killed you dumbass," Castiel said frowning.
to our story. Do you understand?" Cas asked.
Dean squirmed.
