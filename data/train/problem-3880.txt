Dean’s eyes linger after her, the slight limp on her right side. The dread in his chest has disappeared, legs no longer trembling. He thinks about what Charlie told him.
Before Mom got sick and Dad got dead, Dean moved around a lot. Throughout all of elementary school, they never stayed in one place for long. Being a military kid had its perks, sometimes -- moving around meant he never really had to learn everything. Sure, he fell a little behind, and sure, it was a bitch to get his GED a decade later -- but at the time, not having to pay attention in class was the only good thing that came with being the new kid. The bad stuff was a little more overwhelming, especially for a seven-year-old. He never had any friends, never got to know any of the teachers, never got to try out Little League. He had Sam, though. And that had to be enough.
Dean stares at him for a long moment and wonders how this place made him start trusting two brand new people all in the span of three hours. His old list of “People I Can Trust” used to extend to Sam, himself, his Mom, and the school bus driver. It had expanded much too rapidly for his own liking, and he wasn’t sure how to feel about it.
Dean curls his arms around himself, tucks his face into his chest and tries to make himself as small as he possibly can. He lets two sobs wrack his body before pressing his knuckles into his eyes, hard. Holds his breath as long as he can before heaving out one last breath. He thinks about his lungs collapsing, chest caving in; a small black hole sucking up the rest of him into nothingness.
He traces his fingers over the friendship bracelet on his wrist, and Dean decides that he can’t afford to let his thoughts start racing again. He spends three minutes trying to make his hair look half-decent before saying
(When someone you love goes away, the grief is overwhelming -- there’s nowhere to put everything you feel for that person. No place to throw it away, or hide it, or move it around to someone else. It gnaws at you, fighting to get out, until it eats you alive, and it feels like you’re dead too.
For what feels like the first time in his life, it appears that Dean was correct on the first try. Cas’s small smile disappears, replaced by something that can only be described as pure distress.
“See! You’re wrong, I just proved you wrong. Family doesn’t hate you,” Dean says as he watches Castiel shake his head, and he digs deeper.
“It feels like everyone here kind of draws the short straw. Even most of the staff that I know, they’re here for a reason,” she says, eyes on the floor. She looks back up at Dean and attempts a smile. “I guess you never really know what someone’s been through, huh?”
Dean shrugs, quietly takes a seat in the chair he threw yesterday across Bobby’s small desk. His office is the only room that isn’t beige, painted a dark green instead. It’s almost the same shade as Dean’s scrubs, and he would give anything to melt into the walls. He tries to find something in the room to focus on, glances around the stacks of papers and packed bookshelves. Bobby clears his throat after placing a notepad and pen on the desk, and Dean swallows.  He wipes his sweaty hands on the bottom of his scrub top.
“Tell Jody you had your intake today. She’ll give you extra,” he calls out after Dean walks through his office door, and Dean crooks up the corner of his mouth. It seems like Jody will give out extras to just about anyone who asks, and he starts to think that she might be a lot kinder than her harsh expression gives away.
There are about a dozen other patients on the ward, and all of them stare as he walks around looking for a table. The younger patients are sitting together at one table, but they still look about ten years older than Dean. The others look to be in their fifties, and they’re scattered in pairs or in solitude around the room. Anxiety thrashing around in his gut, Dean swallows and avoids as many gazes as he can while he walks to the back of the room, close to the too-high windows.
He peeks his head out of the doorway before walking quietly down the hall, making sure it’s as late as he feels it is. No one is walking around, and the clock on the other end of the hallway confirms that it’s ten. Dean drapes a towel over his shoulders and slowly makes his way to the bathroom, unseen.
,” he spits out, taking a step closer into Dean’s space. His heartbeat skyrockets for all the wrong reasons, and Dean realizes that this is the closest Castiel has ever come to him. His gaze is electric blue and Dean feels glued to his spot on the floor.
In May, Sam finds out that he got into Stanford and Dean’s sober enough to muster up the energy to say congratulations. His voice sounds rusty, and unused, but Sam thinks it’s one of the best things he’s ever heard. They celebrate with a pizza from the joint downtown, and Dean
“Just because it has gremlins and the main character shares the name of your brother doesn’t make it good,” Cas says, stretching as he sits up. Dean stares for a second before turning his attention to the stunning graphics on the side of his toothpaste tube.
and starts to walk a little faster, but Dean notices that she’s not chasing him the way that Bobby and Charlie did. He stops and turns, sees that she’s got a pad of paper and pencil in hand.
Dean crawls out from under the bed, dusts himself off and nods at Blue Eyes. His heart has finally stopped pounding, and he glances around the room. It’s decorated with tons of art -- and not shitty art, like in the hallways, but
“Seriously. Everything’s fucking beige. It’s ugly. You wanna go out staring at shit like this?” He turns and points at a framed picture of a very poorly drawn tree with a sun shining in the corner. There’s a scribbled
Every therapy session with Ellen is like pulling teeth now. Any mention of future planning makes Dean freeze up completely, so badly that he stops talking sometimes. So far, they’ve gotten through the process of how to get back to his apartment and different places to look for jobs. But as soon as Ellen mentions what to do further down the line, like building support systems or finding people to check in with, he shuts down. He can’t help it.
Rolling his eyes, Dean sighs. He briefly mimes writing, and Charlie hands him a little notepad from her desk. The pen she gives him is bright green, and there is a tiny Yoda head on the cap.
Dean nods, rubs a hand down his face before resting it on his palm. Castiel looks at him intently with his arms crossed on the table, colorful bracelets looking ridiculous in combination with his serious expression. Raising his eyebrows, Dean gestures at the bracelets and looks back at Castiel.
Dean clears his throat and slaps a hand on Adam’s shoulder, gripping hard. At the touch, Adam startles -- he leans back, but Dean holds him in place with a firm hand.
Dean’s memory of his childhood home is fuzzy at best, and if not for the picture of his family on the wall he wouldn’t even be able to recognize this place as his own. He wanders throughout the bottom floor, peeking into rooms and calling out for his mother.
“This is the medical bay, where you’ll come to get all your medications and see Charlie or one of the others for whatever you need. While you detox, things might be bad. Have you been through withdrawal before?” He turns, and Dean shakes his head. “It can be bad, but that’s just how it is. Meds make it better, but if you start shaking and gettin’ confused, let someone know A-S-A-P. Got it?”
and now the guy won’t even let him help out to find some damn thread. Not only that, but Cas usually spends a lot of their time together looking at Dean; and he doesn't like it about himself, but he's kind of vain. He likes to be looked at, and he likes catching Cas staring. It almost feels like a game. But now -- Cas won't even
“I know that you probably find me disgusting, because most do. This is why I didn’t want to tell you,” Cas says, swallowing heavily as he keeps his eyes closed. Dean shouts at himself, willing any muscle in his body to shift out of panic mode and to do
Sometimes, Dean even feels a little bit happy. Sharing meals, going for a walk in the woods, making things with his hands. He hasn’t done those things in years. For the first time since he was a kid, he does things for himself. He ended up here because of Sam, sure -- he knows that. He sees it, almost impossible not to see it. But when he finishes a little painting, or laughs at one of Benny’s jokes, he can put that aside. And he can pretend to feel like he’s here because he chose to be, and he’s choosing
“Sam, I believe that our time is running out. They run a tight ship around here,” he says, and Dean glances back up at Cas. “It was wonderful meeting you. Dean says goodbye, as well. He hopes you’re having a good time.”
“Well, that’s not always a bad sign,” Benny says it to Ash, but he’s looking at Dean. He offers a smile and shrugs. “He’ll fit in with everyone else, just takes some time. We’ll adjust.”
He goes, and Dean manages to hold back the tears threatening to spill over. Benny strolls through the front doors with purpose, shoulders pulled back and head held high. Last night at group he told everyone that he was moving back in with his cousin for a while, gonna try to land a new job in the next few weeks. He was happy, and he was excited. Everything that Dean isn’t.
A sad look crosses Ellen’s face. “Dean, he wanted to get out of your father’s apartment. Can you blame him for that?”
He stops at first because he realizes that he’s about to say something that he’ll absolutely regret, and then he stops because Castiel turns and looks at him again. And his posture is still unyielding, but his face is neutral. Unreadable, waiting.
. He’s leaning gently against the door, book tucked under crossed arms. His forearms are covered in friendship bracelets. At least a dozen on each arm, bright colors and different patterns -- there are so many that Dean’s eyebrows raise up and he points to them, takes a step closer to look. Blue Eyes sticks an arm out without a word, letting him admire the bracelets; there’s one in particular that Dean can’t stop looking at, dark teal and dusty orange intertwined with black threads in a diamond pattern. It looks like the color palette of every cowboy movie he’s ever seen.
Castiel rolls his eyes, unaware of the tornado of self-loathing that just blew everything down in its path through Dean’s brain. “We knew each other in high school. Some things happened then, but now she’s just a dear friend. We happened to reconnect under circumstances that aren’t ideal.”
In this way, Castiel feels like everything that Dean can never be. And he thinks about how it took him three hours just to work up the nerve to say two words to an empty room. And in twenty minutes, he has to talk to Sam -- and he’s not going to be able to.
He saunters back to the table with Kevin and Ash, and Dean’s left feeling gutted for some reason. The small kindness of introducing him to everyone in the least fear-inducing way was just -- so
His lip quivers, and he grips the side of the tray hard with his fingers. After a few seconds, he grabs the plastic fork from inside the tray and psychs himself up to take a single bite.
It’s the only time that he feels good about himself, really. Because Dream Mom doesn’t know that he turns tricks, and she doesn’t say anything other than
Dean stares at him for a second, looks down at his worn leather jacket. Starts to panic a little at the thought of going without it. He gestures to it, takes everything out of the pockets and throws all of it on the bed haphazardly. Dean takes the jacket off of his shoulders and shakes it out to prove there’s nothing hidden inside, and then looks at Bobby again. Pleading.
Dean just shrugs and looks at her sheepishly, avoiding Adam on the stool. He intends to avoid him entirely, getting in and out as quickly as possible. In his mind, Dean thinks that if he scarfs down enough pie there won’t be enough room left in his body for feeling bad. Maybe if he eats it fast enough he’ll even feel a little sick, and that’ll
Or something like that. If he could thank the lady at the grocery store who gave him a few bucks, it should be nothing to thank this random guy who just pulled Dean out of the hell that is withdrawal.
“That’s okay. How about I ask questions? Like therapy, but better since it’s me,” Dean says, cracking a grin and offering a wink.
Dean does what he’s told, feeling his pulse start to settle down even though he can hear Bobby and Charlie getting closer. He shuffles his large frame under the twin mattress, watches Blue Eyes readjust the sheets before standing up and standing near the doorframe. He tells Dean to tuck his knees in more, then offers a quiet
He lets his arms fall at his sides. With a sigh, he makes his way to the door. Bobby must hear him come closer because he doesn’t knock again, and Dean sees the shadow of his feet move back under the door. He rests his forehead against the wood, just for a second, and wills the tears away. Once they’re gone, he lets his hand twist the handle to reveal one surly Bobby behind the entrance.
Dean stared at the line of Cas’s back for a good five minutes, breaths slowing down until Cas must have thought he was asleep. After a few more minutes had passed, Dean’s eyes finally starting to drift shut, and Castiel whispered into the darkness.
And to this day, he thinks the doctor must have been reading his mind, because she told him right then that he should stop going to work and try to take it easy.
“That’s certainly true. So you can take your time, but I would like to remind you that we don’t have all day and I do still have a backup notepad.”
Castiel offers the bundle of threads back to Dean, and Dean tries not to dwell on the surge of warmth he feels when their fingertips brush together. He nods in thanks, stares back down at his tangled mess compared to the many pristine examples of craftsmanship on Castiel’s wrists.
He shuts the door behind him, staring with wild eyes at the dark-haired man. He’s messily rearranging the sheets on his bed, a dark blue quilt hanging over the side and pooling on the floor. He doesn’t turn back to Dean, just starts talking as he messes up the sheets. “Get under the bed. I’m going to crack the door open, and they will most definitely come in here. Just stay curled up. And don’t make a noise, of course, but it seems like you’ve already got that down.”
He listened a little, sure -- but he just sat there. He tries to wrap his mind around her words, the casual way she had thanked him. Easy as anything, like he actually did something that obviously mattered. It makes an ache unfurl in his gut, and it hurts; the only good thing is that it pushes his anxiety out and away.
The morning of his eighth day at Hope Valley, Dean walks into Bobby’s office with one of Charlie’s Star Wars pens and a small notepad that Cas snagged for him from the art room. He already has a message written out, anger visible in the harsh curves of the letters. He rips the note out and slaps it on Bobby’s desk, not taking his seat like usual.
He jolts back, eyes wide as he almost trips over himself in an attempt to get away from Dean. The gesture simultaneously offends and relieves Dean, but he makes the executive decision to not analyze the nuances of those emotions and instead stares at his friend. Cas stares back, expression blank. He swallows, and then opens his mouth to speak.
talk. And he really meant it, even if he only promised it to himself. But he doesn’t know if he can, now.
good at anything. Nothing that's his own. He's not worth anything that he didn't take from someone else. He's good at raising Sam, but that's because he learned everything from Mom. And he's good at fixing cars, but that's because Dad showed him how. And he can't talk about his job.
“Why?” he asked her. The paper sheet under his legs crinkled as he moved, and he felt hyper-conscious under her gaze.
Dean picks three at random, ending up with a mix of reds and yellows. For some reason he feels self-conscious about his choices, and grabs plain black and white to complete his selection. Castiel shows him how to cut the thread twice the length of his arm, making a knot at one end. “Now, make a four shape with the first two threads and make a loose knot, then keep going.” He starts his own bracelet, four different greens and one black thread. After a few minutes, he turns to check on Dean’s progress. “Oh, not quite that tight -- hold on.” He reaches over and unties Dean’s first row of knots, cheek hovering next to Dean’s shoulder.
“We’ve tested your white blood cell counts and the specific type of cell that HIV attacks. We have also measured the viral load, or how much of the virus is in just one milliliter of your blood. I can go over each result with you if you would like, but the tests are conclusive. You are HIV-positive.”
“Your mother requests your presence, Samuel,” the man stated clearly, jerking to attention as he spoke.
He felt the other hand at his closed eye, forcing it open as he leaned close enough to where their noses barely touched. Staring straight into Dean.
When he was met with no response, he lifted the man by his throat, shifting them both around so Dean’s front was pressed against the bookshelf.
Castiel watched, a smirk on his face as he took in the man's expression. Hooded eyes, pupils fully dilated, lips wet with saliva and precum. ‘His feisty little sex freak’ he mused, his hands exploring the man’s body.
“Really think this through. Who do you work for?” Dean’s gaze drops from Cas, his mind racing while trying to come up with the correct response. He looks back to meet Cas’ gaze, a smile on his face with his head tilted to the side.
He could feel sleep right there, within his grasp when something niggled at the edge of his mind. Twitching at the irritation, moving his head as if to rid the annoyance, he settled back down.
“I don't love you!” He screamed louder, the villagers lining the lake murmured to one another, some gasping in surprise at the statement. Michael’s eyes narrowing at the confession.
He was met with concerned looks and head shakes. Nothing was there. Not to mention this weird anxiousness that had him looking over his shoulder.
Castiel made a face when he removed one of the parts of the coffee maker to reveal caked-on coffee grounds and who knows what else. Lifting the spray bottle, he applied more than a generous amount of liquid before whipping at it with the paper towel.
She placed her hand on top, closing her eyes, muttering something under her breath before removing her hand. Picking one card up, Dean gasped when the card was no longer black but Yellow.
"Well, you kind of have to, you know, on a night like this," to emphasize his point, Dean clicked the hammer back on the revolver.
He heard a chuckle beside him, turning his head to take in the medic beside him. Messy black hair, fair skin with light scruff. But when those eyes were on Dean, he felt like he was pinned under those eyes. He’d probably let the man do anything to him if he wanted.
“Uh, sorry,” He apologized, glancing back at his phone before pocketing it. He grabbed the box before him to help bring it to the front of the store.
Without another word, Dean left her so as to begin making his way up the stairs to the large double doors. One of the doors had been knocked clean off its hinges while the other was barely hanging on. Inside, the scene was much the same as it was outside. Bodies of the soldiers were thrown about, littering the entrance hall as he continued through the massacre to the next set of stairs. He could hear the distant groaning from some that had somehow survived as he began ascending the steps to the second floor.
“Yes, what?” Castiel bit his lip when he felt the tip at his entrance before it moved back to its rubbing motion along his ass.

The dreams were of a man, the same one from the start. His body was tan, toned, and felt strong beneath his hands.
"Do you not believe in the legend then?" They murmured the question. Blondie folding his arms, a smirk on his lips.
He didn’t know what to expect...no...that’s a lie. He expected carnage as he had witnessed on his way here. Taking a shaky breath, the image of his parents and brother in a heaping pile of blood and death on the throne room floor filled his head as he walked through the door.
Cas' dick popped right out from its restraints, mere inches from his face. Dean turned his gaze upwards to the man before giving the head a small lick.
"How big is this guy?" Castiel questioned, wiggling his fingers around before starting to pull his fingers in and out.
The entire room was plunged in pink lighting, loud music pulsing through the speakers, and people everywhere. Dean stared around the place, unsure of what he stumbled upon.
When he turned around, he wasn’t expecting Dean to be sitting there with his head in his hand, elbows resting on his legs.
“Are you looking at me?” The pervert! Probably hasn’t been laid in years and the first person that walks in, he eyeballs like crazy!
Sam sat opposite of him as the girl slid in, flush against Dean's side as his hand instinctively wrapped around her shoulder.
Castiel contemplated, keeping his head low, fists clenching before reluctantly nodding his head in agreement. They shook hands briefly before Castiel walked around the man and through the door behind him.
For lack of concern, he maneuvered off the bed, keeping one hand out to prevent himself from running into anything.
"Yeah," Dean's voice raising slightly at the lie. "He told me he wanted to experiment by switching roles,"
"Tsk tsk," the Creature uttered, crossing their arms, lifting one hand to touch their cheek. "And here I thought we got you." They spoke, amusement clear in their voice. "Clearly Castiel has a firmer grip on his mind than we thought."
Castiel hummed, bringing his hips forward, out of Dean's grasp to turn around and gazing down at the man. One hand reaching behind him to turn the handle of the door.
“It’s not just some stupid pottery, Dean,” Sam started, his tone Dean was all too familiar with. This was the tone that signaled that he was about to give a lecture. The best way to prevent it was to cut it off at the source.
“Well, I hope you feel better,” Dean started after a few beats of silence, standing up straight. He placed the cup on the table, his palm of his hand lying flat along the surface. Castiel stared at those hands, slowly trailing them up the arm. To the shoulder before locking eyes with the man.
“Dean gets the first watch, Sam you rest. And you know where I’ll be.” The boys nodded their agreements, having already been through this so many times. This had been going on well before they were alive and it’s become regrettably second nature.
Dean thought, recognizing the shouting of Bobby. When he looked back up, a cold chill ran down his spine at the look he was receiving.
The mysterious man, from what he could see, cocked his head to the side as if unsure of what he just heard.
“Alright, we're gonna sprint across. Count down from ten then open the door.” Dean replied into the phone. “The second I hand up,”
“But you were able to free me,” the man's voice sounded puzzled. Dean let out a muffled yelp when a cold hand touched his cheek. “The seal,” he started, Dean opened one eye to peek at the man, confused by the concerned look on his face.
He felt Dean let his cock free to replace his hands-on Castiel’s hips as he slowly pulled out and pushed just as slow back in.
Pulling his hand from his nose, probably seeing the blood from the cut there, before shaking his head.
He heard chuckling in his ear, it was low and soft. Another image flickered through, the torso of a man stood over him, between his legs with there hands on either side of Dean’s body.
“Please! They’re going to kill me!” the voice called out hysterically. Dean could feel his heartbeat start to pick up, a sick feeling dropping into the pit of his stomach.
Castiel didn’t respond. He couldn’t say anything as he tried not to look down at the man whose gaze was solely focused on him. He could feel those eyes like a weight in his gut as he tried to squash those hopeful thoughts of his.
“Alright, you know the drill. Get the lackeys to clean up the mess then we are out of here. Are the pedestrians gone?”
The feeling of being unsatisfied lasted longer than he thought within those first seven days. He tried his hand with many of the servants and young maidens around the village. Nothing gave him that overall sense of completion.
That being said, Castiel had witnessed the comings and goings over the years of all Mr. Winchesters exploits as they attempted to leave in the mornings. Castiel not saying a word but being kind enough to extend them breakfast as a courtesy
“Nonsense,” Crowley interrupted before Castiel could turn away. “We should have that in supply here within,” the man pulled out his pocket watch, checking it before answering. “A few minutes. We can bring it back when it's ready if you want it in your private room,”
He figured he would grab a coffee on the way to work so he didn’t cause a stir in the quiet household. He could easily use the silencing charm to create a bubble around himself as he did his morning routine.
“Cas-fuck-” Dean grunted out, voice shaking. Castiel ran his hand soothingly along the man's back as he inched his way in. They both groaned in unison when Castiel was fully sheathed, both of them one using that moment to adjust.
The man replaced his lips for his hand, slowly stroking the length to give the man a cheeky smile, enjoying the praise.
Limbs shaking as the man continued his slow rhythm once again, feeling a hand grasping his weeping cock at the base in a firm grip.
“Ya Idjits ready for the prom?” Bobby called out, rounding the corner with a beer in hand. Checking his watch again, he sighed when it read four minutes to seven.
As the sun rose higher, the streams of light found its way onto the bed and into the eyes of one of them. They moved their head away, groaning, before curling tighter into the body before them.
Dean anxiously looked at his watch, ten minutes to seven, turning his attention out the window to the slowly setting sun. He took a deep breath, a hand on one of the bars to make sure they were secure. Turning towards the room, it wasn’t that big, but it was enough to fit a handful of people comfortably. A cot in one corner, three computer screens on the wall with a desk settled underneath them and a big cabinet off to the side filled with necessities such as food, water, and guns.
She gave a nod of her head, throwing in an overdramatic curtsey for good measure, making Castiel smile.
“It’s ok,” he murmured to them, sitting on the edge of his seat to get closer. They turned their eyes on him, the fear sparking pleasure within him as he leaned closer. Watching their pupils dilate, bodies becoming lax as they fell under his hypnotic gaze.
Castiel had just placed the dinner plate in front of the man, intending to grab the napkin to place it on his lap when a grip on his wrist stopped him.
Easily slipping in two fingers, already stretched from there last session, sinking all the way to the knuckle.
He groaned at the pounding headache, squinting in pain, wanting to bring his hand up to rub the ache away but his arm was too weak to move.
“No, please,” the figure cried out when Dean placed a hand on his forearm, yanking it away to curl tighter in on themselves.
That...that did not end well. They found her body mangled, hanging from a noose in front of the capitol building that morning.
The trek through the door didn’t take long, Castiel having reached behind after Dean pushed him against the door to start making out. Only after the door opened, Dean made quick work to gently lay him out on the bed, covering the man below with his own body to resume the kissing.
Meg gave his shoulder a small push, Castiel’s body moved before his mind and he was out of the door in no time. He unchained his bike and peddled home as fast as he could.
Dean became a panting mess after Castiel added a finger, then two and three after Dean was able to relax himself. Somewhere in between, Castiel couldn’t help himself in biting one of the man’s ass cheeks.
He heard a low whistle as he was forcibly turned and patted down but the ugly looking man. A bowl cut with overgrown eyebrows, tall but thick in stature, with a pencil-thin mustache.
Gripping Dean’s hips, he began slowly. Picking up the pace the more comfortable he felt Dean get. Revealing in the small gasps and moans he elicited, his hands moving up to Dean’s shoulders, gripping them as he picked up the pace.
“And what made you not want to experience this again?” blues eyes kept their gaze on the man, the pillow had been removed so he could take in the lip biting and crossed arms.
Nodding, Castiel turned around to start his shift. Stocking the coffee cups, making a fresh pot, rolling silverware, and so on.
He zoned back into the conversation when his name was called, catching the tail end of Bobby’s story about how the creature of dark magic was imprisoned inside a vase. Trapped. Locked away and looked after by the Winchester line.
He didn’t intend to stay as long as he did. Castiel was still sitting at the bar when they made the last call announcement. Castiel had lost count. Was this his 4th drink? And how many shots?
Dean bit his lip, muffling a cry as he came all over Castiel’s hand and comforter, his body shuddering through his orgasm.
Cas stared in horror, his eyes adjusting to the little lighting they had from under the door, as he watched Dean fiddle with his belt just before dropping his pants as well.
A small crackle in the air every now and then that he couldn’t explain. Seeing the same crackle surrounding the two sent a cold chill throughout his body.
Dean looked around, and sure enough, people were grinding on the dance floor, people making out on the couches, alcohol and yup, drugs.
“Well-uh, kind of.” Castiel raised a brow, indicating for the man to continue as he leaned against the dining room table, arms crossed as he waited for an answer.
Humming to himself, Dean placed the rag he was using into the sink as he came around the counter to join Cas in the living room.
“Who said you can look up,” he heard Eldon murmur angrily into his ear, Castiel flinching away but a hand around his shoulder kept him from moving too far.
A moan from below had him turning his attention to watch just as the dirty blonde head lower farther onto his cock.
Kissing the top of his head, Dean relaxed back into his pillows. Looks like they weren't going anywhere real quick. He loves everything about this man.
“Hey!” the first man complained, almost dropping the sack filled with his drink, glaring at the second.
The last one...well that was the weirdest. They were closing shop while Dean was sweeping the floor. A man came in, all ruffled and exhausted looking. He walked right up to Dean, placing a hand on his left shoulder while handing him a card.
“Now, normally people who talk like that are raised with a strict upbringing,” Castiel gathered, recalling the stories Dean has told him from the previous sessions. From what he can gather, he was a Man’s Man.
The sadness when Castiel basically brushed the whole thing off, making a comment saying how friends don’t kiss.
“But you can wait till the purge is over,” Sam let go, squeezing Dean’s shoulder as Bobby and he walking down the hall to the main room.
Only a few patrons were here this early. Sam turned back around to lean forward, indicating for Castiel to do the same.
“Not much of a pep talk when all I have to tell ya is to do everything I call out,” The oldest of the four said as he clapped Dean on the back.
Sighing into the air, adjusting the blankets tighter around himself. The rain continued its downpour as he tried to get back to sleep. Blaming the weird incident on his high sex drive lately.
The locks are on the outside just in case of situations like this. The door gave a loud groan when he opened the door, the strangers head popping up to see who it is. His shoulders remained tense, his face set in neutral as Dean shut the door and leaned against it while crossing his arms over his chest.
“Have you eaten anything today?” Castiel questioned, starting their usual routine of questions. He turned in time to see Dean pushing down his sweats so they’d pool at his ankles. For a man of his size and structure, he was very well hung. No wonder his female clientele list was long.
“Get in!” Dean urged, pulling the guy by the coat, his gaze turning outward to the approaching shadowy figures. He yanked the guy over the rest of the threshold before slamming the door, spinning the locks into place.
"Well, You're gonna get it tonight, Big Boy," the man commented, swinging the whip around. "What's your safe word?"
After that, Castiel wasn't expecting the outcome of leaving work early, a stolen bottle of scotch from behind the bar and a certain businessman pushing him down onto his bed.
“Dean, always a pleasure,” Castiel’s back was still turned as he refocused on the matter at hand. The notebook for this session. Rifling through until he found W for Winchester, he picked it and turned towards the man.
No. At least, that’s what he believes. The item in question, he can’t even recall what the thing even
“What? Is it one of those ‘survive on an island’ type of thing?” Sam asked, the corner of his lip lifting up into a small smile.
“Dean!” pausing in his warm-up, he turned in the direction of the familiar voice, a smile spreading across his face when he saw him.
Squinting into the distance, the sun having gone down not too long ago, he could make out the silhouettes of people in the distance.
“Dean,” keeping his voice firm despite his insides being rattled by just a simple hand on his wrist.
chapter tw: mention of child abuse/neglect, discussion of underage prostitution (before and after only. NOT graphically discussed), brief underage drinking.
He’s just about to exit the room to find Charlie when a knock sounds, three quick raps on the door. Dean opens his mouth for a second, so stunned that he almost speaks aloud for the first time since entering the facility.*
He feels fatigued even though the day is only halfway over, and he can’t fathom how people here get through two therapy sessions per day with constant activities in between. Bobby told him that he could pick to go with the hiking group or the crafting group after lunch since he’d just finished his intake, but after today he’d be sorted specifically like the rest of the patients on the ward.
The direct question startles Dean, and he looks at Benny with wide eyes. He swallows and shakes his head.
The phrase punches all the air out of Dean’s lungs, and he moves away to grab his toiletry bag for the showers. His heart is pounding in his ears, and he has no idea how to respond to the sincerity in Cas’s voice.
It took him two hours to muddle through his story. It had been almost a year since he’d spoken that much, and he stuttered more than he wanted to admit. But at every strained pause, Cas would say “It’s okay, Dean,” and it really did feel okay. And then he would keep going.
Castiel offers him a soft, beautiful smile, and he nods. “I agree. Health, and these matters can be… difficult.”
and Cas had been smiling at him more than usual in the craft room -- but Meg was there, standing in the doorframe, having a similar conversation to the one he’d overheard before.
Adam’s eyes go wide, and Ellen nods once. The only person in the room who doesn’t stare is Cas, who simply nods along with Ellen as she speaks.
Dean traces the outline of Castiel’s profile with his eyes. And he knows Cas isn’t talking about the same thing. But he understands.
“Dean,” Castiel says from Dean’s left, tucked into a corner behind a stack of art supplies. He’s at a table that looks built for one, but he grabs another chair and sets it up on the other side. “Glad to see you.”
He hears movement on the other side of the door, the gentle creak of the bed as Castiel rises. Shadows move in the space under the frame and Dean holds his breath for a few seconds. He feels glued to the floor, trapped in this moment -- he doesn’t know if waiting outside or leaving is worse, but it seems like his body has independently decided that staying is the best option.
Bobby catches him staring, and makes a small grunt in response. “Don’t be worried about that. Had someone toss my favorite lamp at me one time. Everybody here gets a little worked up at some point, just got yours outta the way early.” He hands Dean a little cup with a white pill inside and another cup of water, watches him swallow and gulp down the rest of the liquid.
“Just be honest. He cares about you, you care about him. Plus, he’s my friend too. I wanted to meet him, so kiss and make up.”
Breakfast passes as it usually does; he listens to Benny and Kevin talk about the ethics of hunting and the value of AP credits, then silently walks to the little room next to Bobby’s office. He takes a deep breath in before he dials the number.
Everyone has been telling him about how hard group therapy is supposed to be, but by the time the session finishes Dean is so deep in his own head that he’s not taking in a single word that anyone else says. Bobby leads at the front, and Dean’s still aware enough that he waves to the room when he hears his name during introductions -- but after ten more minutes, the voices and stories of those around him are just static.
“That’s Ellen, in group. She’s a riot,” he says, voice going soft around the edges. “I think you’ll like her. But you can’t meet her unless you get through this with me first, son.”
He backs away again, knees knocking into the edge of his small bed. “I can’t use, so I do this instead. Hate to break it to you, Dean, but I’ve got a few more problems than just liking heroin a little too much. All of the other problems are just as ugly. You weren’t supposed to know.”
Dean put a blanket over his brother’s shoulders and went to the back of their apartment silently before standing in the bathroom for a long time, stripping and turning on the shower. He examined himself in the mirror, tracing the lines around his eyes and the errant scars over his body. He looked older than twenty-two, but his heart felt even more ancient. Eyes scanning down, he thought about his body: a tool, a machine, a vessel. And now, more terrified than he’d felt in eighteen years, he wondered if it was also a traitor.
Dean gulps and takes a step forward, putting Castiel barely four inches of space away. Immediately, Cas lunges back into the room, trying desperately to keep a decent area between them -- Dean follows, pushing back the electric spark in his hands as his fingers wrap around his friend’s elbow.
“Doesn’t sound like this place would pass a health inspection,” the voice says, and it takes Dean a solid five seconds to connect it to Adam. He gulps and draws his hand away, disappointment flooding his lungs as he turns to walk back to his room, sans pie and sans motherly advice. Unbidden tears spring up in his eyes again, and in his hurry to get as far away as fast as possible he runs into the edge of the counter. Cutlery clatters on the bar and he feels a dull pain radiate into his hip.
“Dean,” Castiel whispers, and he closes the distance between them. For the first time since he met Cas, Dean falls into him -- Castiel tugs him into a bruising hug, and Dean can’t help himself. He melts into the firm line of his friend’s body, allows his arms to curl around Cas’s waist and hold him steady. Cas still smells faintly of lavender, and Dean closes his eyes. Tries to stop thinking and just feel.
“Would you like to come learn a new pattern with me? After you tie this one on, of course,” Castiel says, moving one of Dean’s hands from his shoulders. He tucks Dean’s hand gently within his own palm, places the blue friendship bracelet there. Dean swallows, hard.
Usually, it happens every few months. And it’s always the same dream every time. But since he got his diagnosis and the drinking really got out of hand, he hasn’t seen her in a long time. Once Dean started hitting eight drinks by two in the afternoon, his sleep got so bad that he didn’t dream at all -- any rest that he got was in short bursts, mostly induced by blacking out. So it had been awhile since he’d seen his mom.
There’s one window, obscured by what might be the only tree in a twenty-mile radius. The chairs in the room are green leather, and well-worn. One lamp behind the desk bathes the room in a sickly yellow light, and Dean is about to stand up and start pacing when the door opens again.
on him makes Dean bristle. It’s stupid, he knows -- he’s at a medical facility. They have to know things about him, they’re trying to help him; emphasis on
“...can’t keep doing this,” the silhouette says, tone acrid. Dean thinks there’s something familiar about it, but he can’t place it.
Dean grins at her. “C’mon, Jody. You knew I was goddamn blessing before,” he speaks with a shine in his eyes, the familiar banter making some of the ice melt over his skin. “With a face like this, I never have to say much.”
Instead of waiting on him to ask, Cas appears to read his mind instead. “I was involved in... an accident when I was in my last year of college. I liked the painkillers a little too much, and here I am. One-hundred and sixty thousand dollars down the drain, and all I have to show for it are some collapsed veins and a stunning vocabulary.”
Infinity passes between them, and when Dean opens his eyes again, Cas is just watching him. Calm, unreadable -- something in his face that Dean can’t name. He doesn’t shy away from Cas’s gaze, and Dean knows that friends don’t act like this. He knows that this also isn’t how you act around someone that you just have a crush on, but that’s too terrifying; as soon as that thought passes behind his eyes, he tucks it in a faraway corner of his brain to deal with later. For now, he focuses on the way Cas is close, and warm, and smiling at him.
Dean nods again and takes a step backward to try and escape. He’s losing time to practice his words, and Benny telling him that his discomfort is completely visible to the outside world just makes Dean feel even more anxious. He grips the cuff of his jacket tightly in his hand, willing his hands to stop shaking.
after meeting Cas. Sure, maybe he shouldn’t have just assumed those things -- maybe Cas stared at him too long and winked at him too much and it was just because he was weird, not because he liked Dean. Or liked dudes, in general. Knowing him a little better now, it seemed perfectly plausible that Cas was just a weird little guy. Not necessarily a guy-who-likes-guys type of person.
“Now or Never” Castiel could swear he heard the man whisper before hands were cupping either side of Castiel's neck.
The woman, the blade digging into her chest, her body flashing orange then black internally before collapsing to the floor.
"You know what, I thought about it. This is just fine. Michael's vessel. It's perfect. We keep you, Dean, in a secure location so Michael doesn't interfere with our plans,"
“No, I didn’t,” Dean finally said, keeping his attention on anywhere but Castiel who wrote the information down with a nod of his head.
Glancing up at the man through his lashes, the man’s jaw was tense, head straight but his downward gaze was focused completely on Dean.
As the Butler and personal confidant to the billionaire, Castiel did have his own standards to uphold.
“What happens after? I become your slave until you get bored of me then throw me out?” He heard the creature chuckle.
“Since when have you been interested in our family history?” Sam questioned moments before slamming a stack of books next to his brother who jumped at the sight of all the information his brother brought.
“Fuck!” Dean panted out, sitting on the stool Garth provided after the bell rang indicating the end of the second round.
"Well these dunderheads must really want him back," Bobby uttered, walking over to the computer to press a few buttons. The screen changed to the cameras outside, a group of seven people stood by the entrance. Waiting.
“Cas-,” the worlds full of lust, watching the man writhe under the blankets in need. Castiel had to take deep breaths in to calm the blood rushing south.
He swiped away the notification before throwing his phone into his bag. He was supposed to meet Charlie and Hannah for a study session down at the library.
A hot bath will get rid of this irritation, he told himself. The hand clutching his neck as he slowly made his way to the tub in the next room. It took him a few tries to light the fire with the flint and iron.
“That was some spell,” the familiar voice of Meg spoke as she gave his back a few pats. “It threw Castiel into quite a rage.”
The conversation paused when one of the patrons came up to pay their tab. Sam kept his head down, a fork in hand as he poked at his food.
“Now now, you know this is just a facade,” Castiel informed the man for the hundredth time, a marriage to make his family happy.
“Clarence,” she spoke after the long silence, dismissing the underlings. “He’ll come around,” while keeping her distance from the man.
Castiel chuckled, that's when Dean realized they were still talking in the doorway. He opened the door wider to let the man in, taking in his appearance.
After taking off the ridiculous trench coat and suit jacket, he watched Castiel roll up his sleeves, which makes any man 5,000% hotter.
Castiel couldn't help but smile down at the man after lifting completely off before anything could happen.
A quiet city with beautiful scenery surrounding it. Buildings nestled in between like they were in their own little world. The leaves were just starting to change from Summer to Fall, changing from green to the array of reds, yellows, and oranges.
“Let me guess,” the man said, dropping to his elbows before him, tilting his head to get a better look. “You broke up with your boyfriend,”
He looked around one more time, hearing the distant cries and alarms in the distance, before pulling on the handle. Locked.
"I see why you'd need me then," already picturing how rough this guy will be. "The couch, as usual?"
“I've missed you,” he murmured into the kiss, Castiel's hands having fallen at his waist, his feeble attempt to keep this 'strictly professional'. The Man didn’t let go as their kiss lasted, their hands locking around Castiel’s neck.
Cursing to himself, he continued on his path to the woods. The only place to hide in the vast landscape. Keeping his eyes open for anything that could give any clue as to where the burglars have gotten to.
Dean shouted for the guys' attention, pulling his gun from his waistband and aiming it towards the guy right as they looked up.
“Nice ‘n easy there,” a nasally sounding voice chimed in through the quiet. Dean noticed the men around the campfire sit up at the sound. Taking a deep breath, careful not to move his neck too much, he slowly stood at the order of the man behind him with his hands raised.
Yeah, he just…he fucked up. He let a stranger into the bunker in the middle of the worst day of the year. His gaze drifted over to Sam again whose attention was now focused on the camera feeds.
Dean had lost track of how many he received, his cheeks must tomato red at this point when he didn’t receive another, his body tensed. Maybe this is just to build anticipation?
"The obvious difference between your sexual experience and mine. I am always prepared." Castiel wiggled his ass before pushing it out more, giving Dean an eyeful. "No wonder all your male sexual partners left here limping,"
“You’re not going to die,” Dean insisted, replacing his hand over both wounds, a green glow emitting from them. His attention moved from Bobby’s face to the wound. Beneath his hands, he watched the wounds slowly heal just as the man’s eyes closed. In a panic, Dean felt around Bobby’s neck, breathing a sigh of relief when he felt a pulse.
The man adjusted himself so that he was on the seat next to him, he watched those fingers grasp his length, pumping him slowly till he was fully erect.
They spent the next hour lounging in bed before Castiel wanted to move to the living room. Dean had gone to go grocery shopping with the list Castiel made of the things they need, coming back with arm his arms full of stuff.
In the back of Dean's mind, just as he was asked for his order, he was glad to have given that tip to someone who needed it. Some kids aren't like his brother, the ones who are better supported. Of course, Dean doesn't know the kids' situation, he could have given some rich kid some free money. Who knows.
“I’ll be fine, I have a car,” Castiel said in a clearer voice, holding up the glass, squinting at the contents before downing the rest in one go.
“Than please elaborate for me,” turning his head to the noise as much as possible. The corner of his eyes caught a glimpse of a naked body curled against the wall.
How Dean commented multiple times how much he enjoyed wearing the robes they found, even though Castiel caught glimpses of the belt losing, Castiel had to turn his head. Out of respect, of course.
“If you want to call it that. But anyway, as I was saying, you broke up with the guy. He was…” he puckered his lips in thought. “Neglectful? If that’s the word I’m looking for. He didn’t appreciate you or the things you did for him. But the second you don’t do it, he blows up?” raising a brow with that freaking smirk because Castiel couldn’t believe that he was spot on. “Probably bland sex too. Get in and get out the situation, very vanilla,”
He had half a mind to block the number, ignore the message since he figured it was a prank or a wrong number.
The loud cracking sound of bones was clearly heard over the wind, permanently silencing the men, Dean’s stomach dropping as he watched the men burst into a pool of blood.
He looked around where 'Cas' was standing, noticing markings on the floor and candles spread around.
Holy crap Dean has been here way too long if he was thinking that! It must have been hours if not days! But Dean couldn’t be too sure, considering he passed out at one point.
They somehow had fallen into a routine. Dean would bathe while Castiel foraged for food. Some days they spent the entire time just talking. He would get distracted sometimes by the outfits that Dean wore. The colors he chose really brought out his eyes and he knew he was staring, despite Dean telling him to stop. With a smile of course.
“And in the red corner,” The announcer cut through the all the cheering, silencing them so he could continue. “Weighing in at 194. Fighting from right here from our town of Lawrence, Kansas, with a winning steak of 7 and 3, Deaaaaaan Winchester!”
“All that prep and still so tight,” Castiel murmured, pulling out before slamming back in causing Dean to let out a strangled yelp.
He watched the man compose himself slowly, his body shaking as he rose his eyes in defiance towards Castiel.
"D-Dean.." Cas huffed out in between breaths, feeling that intense sensation that keeps building and building.
Dean started backing away. She stayed put. But the sound of chainsaws revving up had him turning and sprinting away.
Cas slide himself out before pushing back in just as quickly. The moan that came from the man's lips was so deep and sexy sounding that Dean was lucky he didn’t cum right then and there. Cas thrusted roughly back into Dean's mouth however many more times before letting go of Dean's head.
“Touche me-please-Cas,” he didn’t need to be told twice, his hands traveling lower at an agonizing speed, getting lost in the pleasured moan when his fingers wrapped around the weeping cock.
He scratched his head while pulling a book from the pile. It still doesn’t explain the information before that. It says that she came from a long line of farmers. That’s it.
“It’s ok,” Suddenly the hand was gone, leaving Castiel to gasp for air. From the corner of his eye, he watched Eldon reaching for his waistband and pulled out a gun. “I’ll be taking care of this today. I was told he hadn’t been in but that’s because he’s been out of town. I found out from a little birdy that he'll be coming in any minute.”
Right as the man had gotten home, shutting the front door, Dean was on him. Only pausing to allow Cas to put his stuff down so they could continue.
They moaned, Castiel’s hands finding Dean’s shoulders, his nails raking through the man’s skin, leaving angry marks in their wake.
Looking at the number that appeared, Castiel squinted at it, not making a connection to who it could be. He glanced around the restaurant, glad that it was a slow day before swiping open the screen.
A. He was really glad that his brother dragged him to the beach, after all the kicking and screaming about how he hated the place.
“If it’s anything, I was more concerned you were gonna hurt yourself. On another note,” he started before Dean could say anything. “I’d like to fix my misconception in my own ways,” Dean gave him a weird look, quickly changing to mischievous when Cas began to lead him to the bedroom.
“You can’t just decide to leave the Castle in an emergency like this,” Sam tried to reason, the conversation going back and forth, ending with Sam using his frame to block the doorway. Hands gripping either side to make a barrier.
“Whatever, Dean,” and to rub salt in the wound, he pulled out the offensive desert and placed it on the table.
He’d been lied to. His whole life. Even though everyone tried to tell him that it was real. They were all two-faced. He couldn’t see any of this, the proof. Like everyone was amusing him by saying such a thing existed so they could get a rise out of him even though they were secretly hiding the truth.
“Castiel, this is Sam. He transferred into our school last week,” Hannah introduced, gesturing towards the man.

“I can’t force you to come with me,” the man started, holding the vase, looking down as he held it gently in his arm. Caressing the side with one hand in an almost loving manner. “But I can give you something to
“I’m feeling awesome,” He watched Dean look over his shoulder to wink at him. Castiel rolled his eyes at the comment. “Fine,” in an exaggerated voice. “Everything is good, but I’d feel comfortable going slow today.”
"Juac, tie him up, and please do something about that mouth if he's not gonna go silently," the third man uttered towards Dean, watching him bring a hand to rub at his temple.
He was planning his surprise attack, the feel of a cold blade against his neck halting him from doing anything else.
He doesn't know how or why, but why look a gift horse in the mouth, when Dean was able to take out the remaining three demons.
chapter tw: mention of suicide, discussion of child abuse, discussion of HIV, discussion of substance abuse
It’s been too long. Dean knows it’s been too long to look at him like this, to look at a friend like this. So he tries to look away, fighting the urge to lean forward just a few more inches. But in his battle to keep away, his eyes are weak -- he glances down and catches the curve of Castiel’s mouth, pretty in the shadows.
“Cool. Why did you get sad in group? I know they skipped you over the question, looked like you felt bad about getting left out.”
As though reading his mind, Castiel glances over at Dean’s slow but steady movements. “Next time I can show you something more complicated. If you want.”
All of his anger bleeds away, replaced by a fresh wave of terror. Because Bobby doesn’t know everything -- but he knows some. And all at once, Dean’s illusion of choice is gone.
He can’t say for sure, but Dean thinks he may have shared a street corner with him once. Which means that he might know what Dean is.
He’s silent for an entire month, and then another after that. Sam stops asking him what’s wrong after three weeks, and they operate by writing notes on an old legal pad.
As he walks to the cafeteria, he weighs his options. On the one hand, it would be awfully nice to get a whiff of air that didn’t smell like it was drowning in hand sanitizer or see some non-fluorescent light. On the other hand, they might have some thread in the crafting room for him to practice making a bracelet. And if he doesn’t quite remember how to make the diagonal pattern or how long to cut the strings, maybe Castiel Novak would be there to help him remember.
But Ellen told him three days to try and hurt himself less, since the world had already hurt him enough.
“You must be Dean. I’m Bobby,” the man says, extending a hand. Dean meets it cautiously and nods once. Hopes that he wiped whatever he was feeling off his face before Bobby could see it.
“The thing about it, though, is that I know it’s gotta be something bad that got you here so young. And however nice it is to see someone so handsome here, I hope that I never see you back after three months.”
Castiel explained to Garth, and he let them go without another question -- all he did was wish Dean good luck and tell him that he could do anything. Dean tries not to let another kind comment incapacitate him, and instead focuses on the logistics of this plan.
“Because she’s just some nurse who works here. You asked why I wasn’t here, it's because she was always fucking in your room when I came over.”
***NOTE: if you are not in the habit of checking individual chapter TWs, please do so for the next chapter (Ch. 29). It should be up relatively soon and I wanted to put an extra content warning out in advance. Check it! However, also note that 29 will be our last instance of rougher content. Thank you again to anyone who reads and comments -- we are getting to the home stretch of this story :)
So it’s nice, Charlie talking to him like this. It feels amicable, and he’s not worried, and she’s looking at the little stack of intake papers on the desk but she’s not judging him. He can’t read her expression at all, actually -- her face is blank as she flips through pages and pages of questions that he already answered with Sam the night before. Well, that Sam answered for him; Dean doesn’t exactly know what he wrote. But looking at the papers just made him want to drink more, so Sam did it.
“If your therapy sessions are so effective that I don’t shoot up within twenty-four hours of leaving this facility next time, I’ll mail you one,” Castiel says, voice dry. Dean’s eyes widen, but no one else in the class responds to the bluntness of his comment -- not even Garth, who just claps Castiel on the shoulder and tells him that he can do anything he sets his mind to.
Worry starts to crawl up into Dean’s chest again. There are a lot of variables today that he wasn’t counting on, and he wanted to talk today.
Ellen’s eyes narrow as soon as she reads the message. “Don’t apologize. And you're not lame, whatever the hell you mean by that.”
Cas clenches his jaw while he adjusts the bracelets, arms concealed again. “My parents certainly never did.”
He looks back down at the tray in his hands, then decides to try and eat just a little bit of it. He knows that he won’t be able to hold down much, but he’ll try. After all, Jody’s food was pretty good -- and for the first time in years, someone’s making sure that he eats.
“Winchester! Up and at ‘em,” Bobby calls through the door, and Dean scrambles out of bed. Exchanges his rotting pair of scrubs from yesterday for an identical pair that smells like the cheap detergent they use on the ward. For a second, Dean pauses:
Dean’s eyes snap up and lock onto a deep blue gaze. Even more shocking than Castiel’s suggestion is his face -- he just looks earnest. Not a trace of pity to be found.
Ellen’s voice cuts through the air, sharp. “I don’t appreciate someone who’s late either, but you speak for yourself and no one else. Benny, how about you go next?”
He lifts up one half of his mouth, shrugs. Dean tends to believe that no one can ever really know anybody else, regardless of the trauma-sharing. But sitting here, staring back at the only other orphan he’s ever encountered (outside of Sam), Dean thinks that he might be wrong. He checks the clock, then picks up the Yoda pen one last time.
Charlie takes a deep breath in. “Can you tell me on your fingers? You can just show me, ten plus how many more?”
The floor is the only place he can look. Specifically, the chipped tile next to the edge of Bobby’s small brown desk.
Castiel’s breath stills next to him, and Dean glances up to see blue eyes staring at him again. The hand falls away, and a curious expression lights up Castiel’s face; he opens his mouth for a second, looking Dean over, then shuts it again. Grabbing the friendship bracelet from Dean’s clenched fingers, Castiel stands and places both of their projects back on the dresser with his buckets of thread and art supplies, leaving Dean to rot on the ground some more. Dean continues to clutch his skull and tries to push the dagger-like headache out from behind his eyes.
Dean shrugs. “Sounds pretty damn good to me,” he says, working the phrase over in his mind. “Actually, I might steal that from you.”
, and those are the types of thoughts that lead a man to slam his entire body into the door two more times until the wooden frame splinters. Dean slams to the ground, hard, and Bobby is following him and talking to him like he’s a spooked animal, and he
“Great! Makes my job a whole lot easier,” Charlie grins wider at him. “Alright, the hard part is out of the way. Once your labs are back, you’ll come back this afternoon for your medications. Until then, you’ll get a tour of the facility from one of our counselors. You get to see your room, the therapy spaces, and,
Dean nods at him, follows him down the hall. There are other residents in the group therapy room as he passes, and he notices a different counselor in the middle of the circle. Her voice carries out into the hallway with a similar twang to Bobby’s. She’s moving around the circle, looking at each person as she speaks. She has a small plastic rifle in her hand that she uses to gesture around the room.
He just had to get through this as a bargaining chip to get Sam on a plane out to school, and then he’s back to the old Dean. He’ll have two weeks before Sam comes home from school for Thanksgiving, and that’s plenty of time to get to the destination he wants to get to.
Dean likes routine. And it took him a month, but he finally settled into one. And having this guy here makes him a little nervous, because he looks familiar.
Adam rolls his eyes because he's a teenager, then he waits a second before opening his mouth to speak again. “You seem familiar.”
A small eternity passes, and it’s long enough that Dean finally feels his heart slow down enough to start moving again. He takes in a silent, shaking breath, then turns on his heel to walk back to his room. It’s been forever -- Cas isn’t going to come out. Cas still might not ever talk to him again, which will piss Sam off and make Dean monumentally sad, but at least he’ll know. He’ll know that Dean’s sorry, and he’ll know that Dean didn’t mean to push him away. And he’ll have Dean’s shitty bracelet.
“You do love to put words in my mouth, don’t you?” Cas says, putting his hands on his hips as he lifts his chin.
“Gotta get onto you about something else since I know you’re never gonna cut that fucking mane on your head.”
“And your body definitely ain’t rotting, believe me. I’ve seen some ugly looking bodies, and that’s not what you got. You’re--”
“You’re going to walk out of here and go to the medical bay. There’s a nurse there named Meg, and you need to tell her that you have to speak to Garth. He’s kind, and he’ll take you back to your ward. He can handle everything else. You’re lucky this place doesn’t have enough money to have security guards walking around,” Castiel finishes, and Dean can hear a smile at the end of the sentence.
With everything he just told Bobby fresh in his mind, the phrasing shakes him a little. But he grits his teeth and shoves the feeling away quickly, instead just shrugging his shoulders. He walks up and down the bar, pretending to think over his options. There’s a tray of leftover lasagna and another of sandwiches, alongside some little bowls of salad and fruit. Cookies down at the very end, which he pauses to take a closer look at. When Dean looks back up at Jody to point at what he wants (a sandwich and a cookie), she instead hands him a full plate.
“Alright, well, we can just get started anyway,” Ellen says, and someone in blue that Dean doesn’t recognize pipes up. An older man, graying hair and something sharp behind his gaze.
means Ellen, too; maybe even Garth, but Dean doesn’t think it’s really possible for Garth to be tough.
“Mullet over there is Ash. Bartender who got carried away, but a genius. Rufus and Lee over there playin’ blackjack, both of ‘em got some wife issues and some family issues.”
But the longer he looks at him, the further away his voice feels. Castiel quirks another smile at him before slipping a small note in the front pocket of his scrubs, ripped from the notepad at some point when Dean was busy feeling like death.
At that, Dean just shrugs and starts working on his knots again. He’s tangled up some of the strings again somehow, but he wants to finish it himself without help. For just an hour, he wants to stop thinking about where he is and why he’s there. Cas doesn’t write him any more notes or comment on Dean’s obviously forgotten technique, just works on making what looks to be the Mount Everest of paper cranes.
He stares at her for a second and tries to focus on the throbbing in his arm instead of the weird feeling in his chest. If Dean felt like talking, he would have told Charlie to fuck off -- using a Star Wars metaphor to talk about how fucked up he was didn’t make it any easier. Bitterness rises up in his throat, and it gives him just enough strength to turn away from her.
As he walks softly down the hall and through the double doors -- the red warning letters more of a welcome home sign at this point -- Dean encounters an obstacle he’s never encountered before.
Even though people have told him his entire life that he looks young for his age, Dean has never understood that. What he sees in the mirror is an ancient face: eyes with permanent dark circles, an ever-present scowl turning his otherwise pretty mouth into something ugly. As his eyes track downward, all he sees are tired shoulders and aching knees. Burn scars here and there -- most of them are faded on this part of his body, but he knows they’re worse on his back.
Castiel extends the jacket to Dean, finally looks at him for just a second. “You left it here the other night. I took it off of you because you were burning up, but I forgot to return it. I’m very sorry, Dean.”
“Congrats on finishing your intake. It’s a tough one,” she says, expression neutral. Dean looks down at his plate again before shrugging with one shoulder. Terrified of what he might do if he thinks about how much he told Bobby for one more second, he turns on his heel to find a table.
Walking to the door, Castiel’s footsteps are silent. He opens it for Dean, and offers a tiny smile as Dean walks through.
“It’s nothing, really,” Sam says, and Dean pictures the way his brother is smiling down at his shoes. He started doing it when he was about seven, never dropped the habit. “School’s good too. And Jess is great. She, uh. She wanted me to come to Thanksgiving with her family.”
Scrambling around the room for his one singular possession, panic grips him. Under the bed, inside each drawer, tangled up in his sheets. Anxiety reaches up through the ground, wrestles his ankles to the tile and cements him to the floor. Dean feels sweat starting to collect on his palms.
He’s got a small black backpack slung over his shoulder, full of the few belongings he brought with him when he came to Hope Valley. The only thing missing is a half-full bottle of vodka, discarded by Charlie ninety days ago. Early morning sunshine streams through the windows high up on the walls, illuminating Benny and turning his eyes a little golden. Over the last five days, Dean has watched Kevin, Ash, and Rufus all be discharged -- and now, Benny goes.
“Hi there, Mr. Winchester. My name is Charlie and I’m going to be doing a preliminary medical exam today. Just gonna ask you a few questions, take some blood, nothing serious.”
The dream starts to play through just like it normally does. He’s sitting at the dining table, and he looks how he does now -- gaunt, tired, older. But she treats him just like when he was six years old, offering Dean a box of juice and some eggs for breakfast. She sits across from him and has a cup of coffee while he eats, watching with a gentle smile on her face.
“Whatever,” Sam says, voice just slightly bitter. After a beat, he speaks again -- softer. “Do you actually wanna hear about college?”
it flashes, second after second, forced into the front of his mind. Everything on a loop, on constant repeat, and usually at this point in the morning he’d be four drinks in and numb enough to carry on with the day without wanting to leave his body behind. But as it is, he’s more sober than he’s been in months, and the thoughts don’t stop coming.
Once her notes are completed, she faces him again and puts on a cheerful expression. “You’ve just got ten minutes left on your fluids and then you can grab something from the cafeteria. Usually they have crafts or group sessions at night depending on the schedule, but Bobby said you can chill out in your room tonight.”
chapter tw: self harm, discussion of drug abuse, discussion of alcoholism, very bad coping mechanisms, very bad communication skills, very brief mention of past assault, brief mention of child abuse
Except his head hurts so badly that he doesn’t even realize he didn’t think those last words -- they came right out of his mouth.
So when Dr. L***y tells Dean that his white blood cell count is low, he doesn’t think much about it. She says that
Without hesitating, Cas rips off the corner of his pastel piece and hands it to Dean. He grabs a pen from his scrub pocket and tucks it between Dean’s fingers. His hands feel like ice compared to Castiel’s own.
“Doing okay? That’s good to hear,” Bobby says, eyes neutral but letting a brief smile across his face. Dean nods and mimics the smile, clenching his fist behind his back until he feels his nails dig into the skin. “Well, if you’re ready we can get an early start. Get you out earlier, extra time for a little crafting with the other patients. Alright?” Bobby doesn’t wait for an answer, instead turning around and walking down the hall.
He nods once at Bobby before closing the door, then takes a seat on the bed. He tugs his shirt off and the scrub top over his head, staring down at the rigid fabric. Dean already feels naked without the jacket, arms cold and exposed. Swallowing deep, he tries not to think about why he hates to feel cold so much, why he wants the jacket back so badly.
“You were talking about planning for the future, and everything. Leaving here. Support systems and shit.”
Waking up and eating breakfast in silence while Benny, Ash, and Kevin talk about politics next to him is nice. Letting Jody slip an extra biscuit onto his plate because he “looks like he’s never had a real meal in his life” is nice. Even his first round of therapy that day isn’t too bad -- Bobby asks about his family, and Dean talks about Sam the whole time. And talking about Sam is always nice, regardless of circumstance.
"The plans were ruined, but we figured a way to get to him. You see, 'Castiel'...he's interesting. To say the least. Quite boring but big ambitions to stop the purge."
“Condoms?” He asked a moment later, Castiel almost missing it from the pleasure of those strong fingers pumping his dick and the fingers pushing deep within him.
"A request?" The question hanging in the air like a thick fog. And when Dean didn't answer right away, those fingers disappeared, a sliver of dread drifted through his mind.
But alas, having all this money and anything he wanted, one thing is for sure, a man can get lonely.
“I love you too,” Dean murmured, lacing their fingers together. Castiel doesn’t remember the last time he’s ever felt this happy, his heart racing at the admission as the two finished dressing. Castiel looked out the door first, the commotion hadn’t died down which means they were still gathering people up.
"Are you feeling drowsy? How many fingers am I holding up?" Dean asked while waving three digits in front of Sam.
‘There was no point in lying’ Castiel thought, moving the cigarette from his lips, breathing out the smoke as his mind raced.
The man in the corner smirked, using his tankard to cover it as he watched the tavern people lose their mind.
Firing off another bullet, the same person fell. Just then the car peeled away. Dean firing shot after shot at the car.
"Why are you telling me this?" He asked, finally lifting his gaze to Castiel-no...Dragon, his eyes glowing red, his face showing no emotion.
Afterward, the lands began to prosper. And so began the tradition of sacrificing people of the village every couple of years.
"you're not going to kill me," Castiel stated in a matter-of-fact tone as he shifted to sit on the floor, tired of the strain on his shoulder. "You would have done it by now," He heard The Demon's footsteps as it paced around what must be a big room. "He's ours to protect. That's all I am telling you,"
He was about to call for his attention again but was silenced by the sudden scraping of a chair against the tile.
“We haven't introduced ourselves. My name is Dean. What's yours?” There was a long pause, a thought flitted through Dean’s mind. He doesn’t know anything about this guy. Except for his deep voice that made Dean shudder.
“Yer Majesty?” A familiar voice pulled him from his thoughts as he sat among the shredded pillows, books, and any other item in the room. She could hear the shouting for what felt like hours.
He looked up in time to catch sight of dark blue jeans, purple tank top, and leather jacket sitting in the seat before him.
That’s when he felt shifting next to him, a shadow in the corner of his eye, following its movements. A pang of fear piercing his paralyzed body when the figure straddled him, a hand on his chest as they settled themselves on Dean’s lap.
A hum beside him disrupted his thoughts, Dean looked down to see the girl looking up at him sleepy eyes, a small smile pulling at her lips.
"Cas!" He shouted, banging on the window to wake him up. Nothing. Cursing under his breath, he followed along the side of the church until he reached the back.
“I-uh, is it ok if I sit here for a moment,” Dean’s voice was muffled by his hands, Castiel nodding despite not being seen.
Completely confused by the statement, he reached out to hold Dean’s hand, rubbing the back of it with his thumb. He was at a loss for words really.
Not ten seconds later after all the noise did Dean appear with a tray in hand. Placing it down in front of Cas to see.
Castiel didn’t question it, wrapping his arms around the man, relief of finally having the man in his grasp.
Whoever had left Cas here was in a hurry. The back door was wide open. Or a trap. Every horror movie flashed through Dean's mind as he placed both hands on his gun while he took a step inside.
He needn’t worry about people seeing him since the window and himself were high enough that no one would be able to tell. The village, if he could call it that, seemed to be tents. Fires pits scattered amongst them with people-no...creatures surrounding them. Walking between the rows, eating at makeshift tables, some looked to practicing with one another using swords or barehanded.
“Your shift started an hour ago, you can’t be asking those types of questions anymore,” Castiel finally said to the she-demon, taking in her still lounging position from where he was restocking the shelves with freshly made herbs.
Castiel made his way through the crowd, weary of the surrounding people while keeping his head low, using his hat to hide part of his identity as he made his way to the bartender.
“F-fuck,” Dean moan out, as Cas started to slowly rock himself, inching deeper with each thrust. Only when he felt that Cas’ was fully sheathed, the feeling of the man's sharp hip bones against his bruised ass and the deep groaning sound did Dean let himself breath.
He felt fingers grasp the flat surface of the plug and a slight tugging. He shuddered at the empty feeling combined with the pain of his ass.
“You good?” Dean asked after he got situated. Castiel nodded with his eyes closed, folding his arms under his head as he enjoyed the softness of his comforter.
"No." The quick response made Castiel's eyes widened in panic, turning his head quickly in the man's direction. Eldon side-eyed him and smirked. "This one needs to remember who he belongs to. The one who lifted him off the dirty-ass floor and put him through school, allowed him to get a job.
“You think I’d let you get a job without someone watching over you at all times?” Dread knotted itself in his stomach at the revelation, eyes opening to look towards Eldon. “That’s right. I’ve been informed you’ve been
“Not necessary but I’m still doing it,” Dean stated, bypassing the hands to tuck it into the apron pocket.
Castiel wanted to fight, wanted to demand to know why he was led on, but the anger in the Dean's eyes was wavering. He could see the edges of hurt and regret with the tears threatening to fall.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your company,” Castiel tried, biting back the queasiness in his stomach.
He pounded into Dean, his head falling back as he got lost in the warmth surrounding his dick. With the added pants and moans of the man below were an added bonus to this surreal moment.
With one hand reaching to hold the back of the man's neck, the other sloped down to undo his belt, the button and pulled down the zipper so as to free himself just enough, hissing into the kiss from the cool air as he ran a hand along his length.
“So soon?” Dean teased, looking up at him through his lashes while his hands worked their magic. One to slowly massage his balls and the other to pump him achingly slow. Castiel came here for a reason, he reminded himself, his train of thought deterring as he watched Dean lean forward to lick the pearl of pre-cum, his tongue teasing the slit before his lips wrapped around the head. Eyes begging Castiel to have his way with him. Looking away, he could feel the last bit of his stance weakening.
“I’m a man’s man,” Dean argued back. “I like guys but I don’t take it up the butt. I give and that’s what gets me off.” The words sounded hollow even to Castiel’s ears like they weren’t his own.
The way they were before this was exactly how he wanted it to stay. Despite the thoughts he had of the man before, at least he hadn’t acted on it.
Watching the man, tan in color with a mop of black hair, rippling back muscles as he stretched his arms above his head to the sky. A groan, so low it sent shivers down south, Dean questioning himself on what kind of reaction that was when he felt his dick perk up.
The guy’s response was to stand straight up, reaching under the table for a bottle, pouring a generous amount into Castiel’s glass before placing it in front of him.
“I thought you didn't love Michael, and that he just wanted to become a duke. Now I know that you love each other. He found you. You told me that only true love could take him to the island.” Sam replied, a hand reaching out the clasp his brother’s shoulder, green eyes smiling as the drums began to play, signaling the start of the ceremony.
A trick on his mind he told himself as he relaxed into the steaming bath, feeling the knots loosening throughout his tense body.
“But you...look so much like him,” he sat up, giving Dean a clear look at the man’s face. Messy black hair, pale skin with glowing blue eyes that left him speechless. “Hmm… but your body” he murmured under his breath, a pleasurable sigh escaping his lips as he began rolling his hips in a circular motion in Dean’s lap. His cock standing at full attention from the feel of Dean’s straining in its confines, taking joy in watching his eyes close in pleasure. “It remembers me,"
He walked to the cliffside where the best flowers grew, attempting to go down the side when a noise caught his attention.
Once he arrived, he could see a body hanging in the air by their ankle, already knocked out from the tranquilizer. They didn’t believe in these rules of killing one another set by these New Founding Fathers. It was just wrong. Over the years Dean could count on one hand how many people he had to kill.
Cas did have a tendency for canceling on some of these shindigs. Dean honestly couldn’t complain. If Castiel didn’t want to go, deciding to stay on the couch and watch tv, well, he was ok with that. Of course, it didn’t last long, once the guy got comfortable, he ended up falling asleep.
“Dean!” a new voice prompted Dean to turn towards the source, surprised to see Benny approaching. What truly caught him off guard was the worried expression on Benny’s face once he was closer.
“There’s no such thing as magic,” he mumbled out after wrapping the towel around his lower half while running a hand through his wet hair.
Sitting up in his chair he turned it to get to his file cabinet, opening the door to reveal the many cases he’s currently working on.
Leaning forward from his spot, he found two figures standing at the entrance, huddled close as they continued to speak.
“A Maze,” it wasn’t a question, just a comment that seemed to have spooked the man. There was fear in his eyes, his mouth moving as if trying to say something.
The day he re-emerged into this world, Meg welcomed the moment with open arms. He was a skeleton of his former self when he found her nest.
“Always so unsure,” he murmured. The next thing Cas knew it, he was being turned around, his back being pushed against the door. His pants were unfastened before he could speak, gasping when those delicious lips wrapped around his slowly hardening length.
I don't know why the font and words are so bold and big when in my doc's is not even this way, smh. Enjoy!
From what Cas knows of the man, the guys got quite an extensive customer list. He was already really popular with the ladies. His male clientele has been slowly growing from what they've discussed during these last couple of sessions.
The closer he got, the distant murmuring could be heard. Ducking down, he crawled the rest of the distance to a bush that separated him from the campfire of unfamiliar looking men.
“No wonder I was able to slip in three fingers in so easily,” He heard Dean say, breaking the silence. Castiel felt something touch his back, his heart jumping at the realization.
Rolling his eyes, this was ridiculous, he was about to respond when the static on the walkie talkie cut in.
Dean was so caught up in the pleasure wrecking throughout his body that he didn't hear the uncapping sound of lube or both hands disappearing from his ass.
“Did you ever figure out that game of yours?” Sam asked after paying his bill. Castiel paused at the question, squinting down at the cash register as he tried to figure out what Sam meant by ‘Game’.
Amongst the rubble, he could see his brother hunched over as he tried to recover. Dean's arm lifted, palm out, the energy building as he readied himself to fire. He wasn’t expecting Sam to slam his glowing orange hand into the floor, sending debris and dust into the air, clouding Dean’s sight.
“Really now…” Dean trailed off, pulling the knife away to examine it. Even going so far as to use the tip to clean at... whatever that was under his nail. “That’s a shame. I guess we’ll just have to settle for a compromise.” He placed the weapon onto the table before him, looking at the array of torture devices set out. Usually this wasn’t his job, but this man decided to hurt someone close to him. Bobby was currently at the hospital with a head wound that they had to place him in a medical coma. He’s amazed at how calm he was despite the rage that wanted to come out and tear the man’s head off with his bare hands.
“F-Fuck,” Castiel moaned out, keeping one hand grabbing the man’s shoulder as the other wrapped around his own need, leaking with precum as he moved his hand to match the speed of the thrusts.
Watching carefully, Castiel watched what were lust blown eyes turning hard as the man gripped the blankets to cover him, yelling for him to “Get the hell out!!”
“It’s cool, that was hot,” Dean brushed off while whipping the spit from his face, smirking up at Cas as he leaned forward to start sucking again.
Dean glared at the gun for not having any more bullets before placing the weapon back into the waistband.
He could feel a bead of sweat dripping from his forehead, wiping it away right before he felt a tingling sensation course through him.
“All I’m saying,” she started, both hands up to show no means of harm or any transgressions. “Now that he is here, it should be taking the edge off,”
Pushing the heavy door open, he and Sam were met by an array of men bustling through the corridor, their father stood amongst them, their mother sitting on her throne. Watching. From the entrance, Dean could see worry and concern on her face clearer the closer he got.
Which is the only explanation. The pain in his neck pulsed in agitation. He brought a hand up to grab at the spot, teeth clenching as he fell onto his bed to curl in on himself.
“Yeah-yeah, try not to speak,” Dean muttered out, holding his hand to the man's wound. Just as his hand began to glow a faint green color, he was stopped by Bobby’s bloodied hand moving it away. “Bobby, don’t be stupid!”
Nodding his hand, making the connection, he allowed Dean to tie it around his head successfully covering his eyes.
“Uriel,” he murmured, the man’s eyes not lifting to greet him. His chest was heaving from the latest torture session.
Keeping his two fingers still deep in Dean, his other hand reached into his bag, digging around until his hand felt the cool touch of steel of the item he was looking for.
The buzzing feeling under his skin had subsided, replaced with this emptiness that should have been filled with sweet release.
Dean nodded in understanding, remembering what happened to that one female that tried to become president so she could end the Purge.
Castiel didn't know if he should feel pleased or disappointed that what he was looking for was not on the menu.
He continued staring straight ahead, unwavering, even when he heard the hammer being cocked on the revolver.
Dean's lips opened slightly, Cas’ thumb brushing along the heat. His breath caught in his throat when the man daringly swiped his tongue along the pad of his finger. His words stuck where they were when Dean closed his lips around the digit, giving it a small suck.
So simple. It made Castiel’s heartache when he felt his body begin to heat up. Like fire in his veins, Castiel’s body arching off the bed. Dean pulled out to back away as he watched pale skin turn grey, horns piercing the skin on his forehead, transfixed but unmoving.
She was a nice lady, someone who had been speaking with him for a while. Charming, witty but an over all sucker for him and his looks.
Only...it couldn’t. The creature was stunned as Dean leaned forward in time to kiss its scaley mouth. His hands up to hold the Dragon in place. It didn’t last long, yanking free, head shaking in confusion, the creature stared at the man.
“Black Coffee?” he asked, already knowing the answer. Castiel felt his stomach flutter when those green eyes landed on him, the light hitting them just so and the small smile of acknowledgment when they landed on him. As Castiel settled the cup before Dean, the man was also reaching for his wallet. Just as he was about to refuse, the fifty-dollar bill made its way into view and it sparked something else within Castiel as Dean placed it near the cup.
“It’s...hard to explain,” now that piqued her interest, enough so that she swung her legs down from her relaxed position, sauntering over to the man with a small smile on her face.
An hour later found the two sitting at a quaint little breakfast spot, the breeze was blowing like crazy that fine morning. Luckily the place was indoors.
Weightlessness, soaring, it wasn't until his back slammed into something solid, knocking all the air out of his lungs before crashing to the floor.
A snowflake floated beside him, drifting along with the air current before disappearing. Followed by the wind picking up around them, the fires and banners bending to the sudden change gust of wind.
He felt the cold presence on his hip, he nearly jumped, especially when he felt something solid press against his back.
But when Dean made that sucking sound, Castiel couldn’t control his hands as they found themselves gripping Dean’s hair as his hips jutted forward, unintentionally choking the man.
He doesn’t know, he doesn’t care, his body moving on its own as he leaned up to catch Dean’s lips with his own. He could feel his heart begin to pump faster at finally having this, a dream but now it was his reality.
That's when he noticed the problem. There was an obvious stain from all the precum dripping from the man's weeping cock, straining hard from lack of contact.
"This is a bit strange," Castiel remarked, stopping to taking in the display. Noticing a Deer and Stag off to the side, noses touching in a kiss.
Gasping and moaning at the man’s continued assault, he almost whimpered when the heat suddenly disappeared. Looking up through hooded eyes, he watched Dean just as he pushed his pants down just enough for his own cock to spring free from its confines.
“Would you like my assistance?” Castiel asked, a little taken aback at the situation. He’s been assisting Dean for the past year and a half and never has this happened with him before. Generally, it’s been casual, simple and downright friendly.
Meanwhile, he didn’t hear the sound of a gun being carelessly tossed on the table, the rustling of fabric or even the footsteps approaching him. He saw the shiny black shoes right as he felt his chin being lifted to meet the steel-blue gaze of the man standing above him. Gritting his teeth, he held back the string of a few choice words while watching Castiel’s cold gaze lingering from Dean’s face to the wound.
"J-just give me a moment," Dean said, a little breathless, one of his hands coming up to cover his face.
“There’s nothing to be worried about. I’m just going to go for a walk.” He opened the door and walked out just as he heard Sam call out.
He jumped slightly at the sudden feeling of something circling his hole, glaring slightly at the man above with that cocky look on his face. Leaning down, he slid the flat of his tongue at an agonizingly slow pace from the base to tip.
The voice demanded, the image of a man’s body standing between his legs, towering above him as he stroked Dean.
Castiel bit his lip as he watched him take the tip into his mouth, bobbing his head to take Castiel inch by inch.
He glanced at his dash to see the time, nearly dropping his phone when he realized it was almost ten.
The beating of wings pulled him from his thoughts, the sound getting closer and closer. The gusts of wind getting stronger and stronger.
“I-uh...didn’t actually drive,” Castiel confessed, looking down at his feet. He braced for an earful, but he felt really bad when he heard shoes on the pavement as they retreated with the sound of a door opening. The slam of it had Castiel looking up, brows knitted together, realizing there goes another man in his life.
“It’s okay, sweetheart.” Rubbing a hand along his back as the guards and his brother rushed in to start picking the books up.
Click. Empty. The sound of the hammer being cocked echoed around the room, snapping Dean’s attention back to focus.
The half dragged half walked Dean back down the aisle to the man standing there. The people dropped, causing him to fall on his hands and knees.
“This game just keeps getting weirder and weirder,” Castiel said to himself after getting into his car.
“Fuck!” He cursed out, hands on the armrest with his head laying on the cushion, ass sticking out in the air for another smack.
“To hell with the cliffs and the fog! I've had enough, helmsman. Turn the ship around. We're going back,” Gabriel grabbed him before he could move.
“Did you want one?” he offered while holding out the box. Dean smiled and shook his head. He pushed back on the metal headboard, stretching backward, his ass on full display for him. Castiel had gotten lost in looking at the cum slowly leaking from the man’s hole that when Dean had moved to get off the bed, it snapped him back to reality.
Must be a girl, with a tight short dress and rocking curves. She was wearing a white face mask, dark hair sticking in every crazy direction. But the kicker is her entire dress and mask had blood splatter all over it.
"Well, what if the designers thought it would be a good way to remind people about what Christmas was about,"
“No,” it was simple and came so easily as Dean held the man’s face with two hands. “I’m not losing you again,”
“I've missed you as well,” Castiel spoke honestly when they parted, losing the feeble battle with himself by letting his fingers find the belt loops of the man's pants, hooking them in his reluctance of not wanting to let go. Green eyes danced in delight at the words, leaning in for another kiss.
All teeth, biting, Dean's hand pulling the man as close as possible. Castiel moaning into the kiss as their cocks brushed against each other.
