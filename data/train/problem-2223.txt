As might have been expected, Sherlock shrugged off the bathrobe and wiggled up into the bed, pulling the blankets around him and John. And John thought he might have been in his case focus mode or restlessness, but something about what they'd just done put Sherlock at ease so quickly he fell asleep almost immediately.
Sherlock had once almost given it up for George Burnwell. Burnwell was a player, and one of the worst of the type. If he could, he might have tried to rescue Mary Holder, the niece in question who was obviously the one who had let him in to do the job, but he knew that she wouldn't want to be rescued. He approached Burnwell with a blacked-out card. It was lucky for him that Mary had expensive tastes, and the amount on the card was high. Holder had said, no expense too high. (Sherlock had insisted, no bitcoin though, you cannot rely on that shit. Real money backed by a real bank or get the fuck out.)
"So...I think maybe it's time you explained some things," John said, leaning back in the chair with an easy smile to let Sherlock know he wasn't judging, even if he might feel tempted to do exactly that. "About Shinwell Johnson, for one. You don't usually just have people come by and give you a vintage Harley for no reason."
This was intolerable. If John didn’t wake up horrified at his own indiscretion, if he didn’t flee or even lash out at Sherlock in violent displacement of shame at his own homosexual desires, then Sherlock would be very hard put to get rid of him.
Jon woke up with a start, imagining he was still back in Afghanistan. He yanked his hands down from around the pillows, expecting to see them covered in blood.
"It is. He does a good job of it. But there are some things you can't change, and, like they say in the Serenity Prayer, wisdom is knowin' the difference."
"Shoulda trusted my instincts," John panted. "Didn't like the look of that place from the outside, I was just too damn horny."
His eyes darted around for a while before he finally settled in. Mrs. Hudson flipped the record, and "Blue Nile" spread its vibes around.
"That's one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me," Sherlock said, stripping completely nude and stepping coyly into the shower. John had to suppress his instincts towards the toilet. He followed Sherlock's lead and undressed completely, uncomfortable as he was with his half-mast that was mostly piss.
Sherlock blinked for a second and then complied, launching himself with his heavy hiking boots first, with the full force of the martial artist he was. John kept firing above and around him. With a horrible sound of tearing meat, the door eventually parted, strands of gristle still keeping it from opening entirely, but coming to himself at last, Sherlock grabbed John, and with all his force, shoved him through into the clear air. John didn't let go of his hand, and pulled Sherlock behind him as the door slammed shut.
"How 'bout a nice big pitcher of Mrs. Hudson's cold sweet tea?" John said with a little grin. "I know you can't resist that."
John thought. At first, he'd known the twists and turns of road, the specific sounds of gravel in certain places, the rush of wind moving through walls of trees sounding so different from the patches of open fields. The dips of valleys, the steep rises of hills, the stomach-twist of switchbacks and the little inner ear-pops of changing altitude. But now, he was lost, well and truly, and the world was dark.
John was strangely touched. "And here I was thinking it was some kind of animal scent-marking thing."
He’d weathered Sherlock’s piercing study of the scratches, the mud, the surprisingly piney-fresh scent of John’s knapsack. Even if Sherlock figured out what John was up to, he was just going to proceed as if he didn’t live with a super-genius. (But John really hoped he wouldn’t.)
The elder Holder was gaping like a goldfish, and only turned to Arthur as an afterthought. “I’m so sorry, so sorry.”
He pulled John roughly against him, catching both their cocks between their bellies. Sherlock was rock hard, John realized. He fucking loved this. "Oh, John," he groaned into John's ear. "You are so, so perfect." He took a bar of soap from the rack over John's head, without releasing him, and started to soap up his back. John leaned in, wary of knocking them both over.
"I never meant to cut you out of it. But this wasn't a gig where I needed muscle. It relied on my own contacts."
Sherlock sealed his lips to John's for a long time, and John's hands rose up to twine in his hair instinctually. This was always good. You couldn't go wrong with this. Sherlock's tongue danced inside John's mouth with a salacious, tasty rhythm, and John was distracted from all thoughts of payback. He just relished the sensation of Sherlock unbuttoning his shirt and sliding it down his shoulders, kissing his way down John's chest until he reached his stomach. That little flutter of long sensitive fingers over John's belt buckle. A quick upward glimpse of Sherlock's quicksilver eyes, questioning.
He almost wished they were - that's how it is when you lose a patient. You ought to wear the marks. It's not right that you get to go home to your family (but you can't, the demon at the back of his head said. She don't want you. You're not a married man anymore. No, he couldn't go back to the family he thought he would have had.)
. Takes place between the end of the Chapter 10 and the beginning of Chapter 11 (which only has a few hours between them).
John's getting a little hot under his blue collar, so leave it to Sherlock to take the sting off. (Sherlock and John, I think, are rather unreliable narrators when it comes to Mycroft).
"My lips are sealed," Sherlock said. "I swear on this flask of swill I'm willing to drink to prove it."
"I sure do. Glad Miss Adlero is still cranking them out." It was a remarkable song - R & B with decades of history in it, a haunting blues slide guitar slithering alongside her versatile, masterfully controlled voice. There was sorrow in it, and hope. Watson took the phone from Holmes and looked at the title. "Goodnight Mr. H?"
Fuck, Sherlock was sucking him like he was trying to eat a hearty soup through a straw. John was amazed he'd managed to keep linear thought going as long as he did. Inarticulate sounds broke from his throat, and he didn't think he'd be able to come nearly as quickly as he did, all his efforts at holding off defeated.
The strawberries were so fresh and succulent - and so was Sherlock in that porch chair in the moonlight. John bit off a tip and came around behind him, running it down Sherlock’s long throat and bending over to follow the juice with his tongue.
Sherlock allowed himself a quiet shiver, and then his mask arose and his spine straightened. Though his heart was breaking, he had a task to see through.
He'd lost fair and square, and was already getting hard in his jeans when he thought about the reaming he was going to get.
Sherlock pulled out two towels, and they rubbed each other down as their teeth chattered. "Oh, John," Sherlock said as he took intimate liberties with the towel on John's body. "I do appreciate how accommodating you are."
Arthur was a sullen young man, in a specifically wealthy sort of way, but the look on his face was dogged and harried.
The church was packed, standing room only, but Sherlock and John truly saw only a few people. Martha Hudson herself, asleep in her bed of flowers, and her caretaker Violet Lestrade standing by the casket. Violet’s mother Molly (née Hooper) hugged her and glanced at her husband who waited on the bandstand.
John's eyes slowly blinked open, a bit sticky and gummy with sleep still. The light in the windows of the old bedroom was gray - an overcast day, maybe some rain for the garden later. That'd make Mrs. Hudson happy. Also create a lot of good mud for preserving footprints in case there was a promising murder any time soon. Yeah, John had a lot of reasons not to mind rainy days.
John cocked his head and smiled at Sherlock, all sleep-mussed in the moonlight. “You erased the solar system, but not Yeats?”
John froze in his tracks and shook at the sight of Sherlock in the bathtub, pale shoulders and face and spread knees lying limp in the endless redness. Red water dripped and sloshed over the edge.
And maybe something about it made Sherlock a little bit settled. John felt that warm, long weight shuffling around in the bed, and as John wriggled just a little bit he felt Sherlock's huge hand slide across his back to his side and pull him closer. He felt Sherlock's breath across the nape of his neck, with a motion that was a little more than a nuzzle and a little less than a kiss. Oh, that was nice. He wasn't sure yet just how awake Sherlock was, if this was going to remain at the cuddle and back to sleep stage or if it was going to blossom into some lazy morning action, and either would have been fine with him, except for one nagging problem.
John might try to protest, but Sherlock was meticulous. Then Sherlock drew John's legs over his shoulders and proceeded to simply devour him. John closed his eyes and rocked into Sherlock's mouth as much as he was allowed, nails convulsively raking the surface of the couch as Sherlock sucked him hard. Christ. Was this to reward him for being so accommodating, or did Sherlock just want to reassure him he still enjoyed it without any piss involved, or maybe he just wanted to show off, and John thought all of that was probably true and it didn't matter.
Two VERY DARK glimpse of what might have been, if this version of John and Sherlock had never met. Most of the others are rather light-hearted. These aren't.
"Fuck," John said, letting his head loll back on his suddenly boneless neck. "You're just decadent sometimes, you know that?"
"Not with his knowledge, no, he's craven but not stupid, and it wouldn't profit him in the long run, even if he did try to frame someone else. Still happened on his watch. Inside job, though? Almost certainly."
“Yeah. Look, just sit there, and relax. You asked about something a little while ago. Just sit there and look handsome. You’re good at that.”
There was something youthful and happy flashing across his face. Like a teacher he had a crush on had given him a gold star.
“I can keep my mouth shut,” Lestrade said. “But you probably oughta know she's put word out in her church that y'all are
, one of my favorite writers of weird tales. Especially in his Silver John stories - about a war-vet wizard who roamed the North Carolina mountains fighting evil beasties with his knowledge of folk magic and his silver-stringed guitar - he was very good at creating cryptids that feel like real folklore. Here's a little sketch of his about the
home. 221 Baker Street in Harlem was home. Not the home he'd expected, but the one where he belonged.
The archaic shower pipes above his head awakened with their usual piercing screech. John hadn’t needed as much sleep as he’d thought, then. Soon he’d be coming down, and then Sherlock would assess his mood in a moment, and he would know how to proceed.
Sherlock groaned and his knees nearly buckled - he leaned back against the wall of the shower for balance while John stroked him off. John took a moment to slick himself up with soap, and pushed his hips up against Sherlock's, angling his cock between Sherlock's thighs. God that felt good. Sherlock's balls pressed up against his cock, velvety and rolling, Sherlock's pulsing erection in his hand, the soap making everything deliciously slick and clean. The sounds Sherlock made echoed against the tile walls and sounded deep in the roar of the water as John made him come. All over John's hand and belly, thick and white, washed away in the shower streams. As Sherlock shivered and trembled and clutched at John's shoulders, he clenched his thighs together tight, clasping John's cock in the tight space between them, and John groaned and let go, feeling hot pulses of ecstasy as he released - again, a different kind of sharp relief. He bit down on Sherlock's shoulder as they rode it out shaking.
So John knew he’d wind up on his belly gasping and writhing as Sherlock ate him out with shamelessly wet and hungry fervor, and filthy little grunting noises as he fought for breath in the cleft of John’s ass, slick hot tongue working John's hole open.
“Yeah?” John asked as he stripped slowly, refusing to cringe from the chill, watching the movements of Sherlock’s eyes down his body. “Really?” He crawled under the covers and ran his hands over Sherlock’s legs. “You sure?” He lay down on his back.
"Fine," he said. "I am Alex Holder, and if you've been reading the papers, you probably know there's a repatriation ceremony next week. A very precious artifact from Southern Asia - "
Beer sprayed from Lestrade's mouth into the creek. His body was wracked with eye-watering cough-laughter. “Shee-it,” he gasped. John noted with satisfaction that he might have caused hiccups, and calmly cracked open another cold one.
He looked down at the dark curls tickling his thigh and felt a line of warm drool leaking down to his balls.
Sherlock started undressing as he went up the stairs, letting his shirt fall over the banister, leaving his shoes right at the top for John to trip over, dropping his tight bell-bottom jeans right over the threshold of the door he wasn't going to bother to close. John chugged the lukewarm Bud as he heard the water pipes howl.
Holder looked like he’d aged a decade, and he hadn’t really had it to spare. But he played the role very well, shaking hands with the Ambassador and handing over the priceless artifact, which Holmes rather thought looked to be in even better condition than it had been before.
And honestly, there was something satisfying and endearing about Sherlock Holmes, supergenius, just having to go like anybody else. And John would get to witness it up close and personal.
It was actually kind of nice to think of watching Sherlock piss, knowing it was allowed. He was going to ask for that next. Now that it was apparently alright to sneak up on one's lover in the toilet - as long as he was standing and not sitting - John was going to use that opportunity to stalk the next time he overheard a wet stream.
Mycroft took a deep breath. He commanded so much power of perception, and yet even his skills could be so easily undone in the face of real pain. Right now, he truly hated the masters he served and the thugs he commanded.
The creak of wood, strained and rocking. Heavy breathing. A rhythmic swinging and slapping. A grunt, an intake of breath sharp and sudden.
“Hush,” John said. “You’ll like this one. What you’re doin’ at midnight, you’ll be doin’ all the rest of the year.”
“Sure did,” John said. “Too much snow to fuck you right here though. Let’s go home and I’ll collect my bounty.”
(“Damn, man, leave some fish for the tourists.” Lestrade had been impressed with the collection of silvery trout bodies John was steadily pulling out of the sleepy brown creek.
"But the help you did give was invaluable. You know we're a team, right? I'm not in this just for me, you know that."
John wandered back toward the bed, led by Sherlock, hand in hand. He'd only sat down on the edge of the bed when Sherlock dropped down to his knees and took his half-hard cock into his mouth, driving it up to full erection with one single vigorous pull of his lips. John groaned and spread his legs, leaning down on his elbows across the bed and just letting it happen.
“But not you. I haven’t had you, because this is different. And for a long time, I wasn’t completely sure, and I knew I couldn’t do this if I weren’t sure, not with you. And now I’m sure. I was sure this morning on the dock and I’m sure right now and I’ve been sure, actually, for a while, just—waiting. For the right moment. So eliminate the impossible, all right, and whatever’s left—”
When John thinks about everything that’s changed, now that Everything is over, he thinks mostly about the pill box. About how he has his own bottles, locked away in a cabinet because one of them is an opioid painkiller. About how the cabinet is in Mrs Hudson’s bathroom, because one of them is an extra-strength sleeping pill.
“Yeah,” John had agreed, without really hearing him. He had been thinking instead about that hand, broad and smooth, about the weight of it, about the stillness of it. He’d wanted to turn his hand over under it, press their hands together palm to palm. “’m up. Where?”
It does hurt. It is horrifying. But John is neither shocked nor surprised—only determined. He know that Sherlock knows they are in this for good. He knows that Sherlock knows that John will follow him anywhere, whether to bad restaurants or right into bed. And he knows that Sherlock knows that John wants—wants this, wants this life, wants him.
He turns his head again to look at John; gets snagged, a little, on the sight of John’s fingers, stretched out between them. His eyes are so blue in the dark, his gaze unwavering, like he’s daring John to say it doesn’t matter—it doesn’t matter if Sherlock never says it back. If he never says so.
Sherlock has a blush riding high on his cheekbones, but he nods. “Just being—well, ridiculous, I think.”
“Come on, you’re okay,” John says, pulling him a little closer, and Sherlock tenses and then crumples all at once, collapsing into John’s hold, hiding his face in the curve of John’s neck. “It’s okay to be tired, all right? It’s okay. You’re okay.”
“I did,” Sherlock had admitted, his eyes darting away, and John had wondered if Sherlock had ever said that out loud before. “But I thought—you know how children are, before they understand how everything really fits together. Things make sense in a different order.” He huffs a little self-deprecating laugh. “His name was Redbeard,” he says. “I thought that if I’d loved him better, maybe he’d have lived.”
So John hadn’t asked, and Sherlock hadn’t volunteered. Instead he had tossed one of Mrs Hudson’s thick knit blankets into John’s lap as he climbed into the driver’s seat and said, “Go back to sleep. I’ll wake you up when we get there.”
It’s not something he’s thought about very much before. He tries to not really consider much further beyond the next day or the next week, relying instead on the general decision to follow Sherlock as far as Sherlock might let him. The rest of it, beyond that, has always seemed like a bit of a question mark on some faraway horizon, some unknowable shape of cautious assumption and hopeful possibility.
more than with this place, wearing faded denims John’s never seen before rolled up to the knees with a white button-up that might actually be flannel, sleeves rolled up to just below his elbows. His shoes and socks lay abandoned behind them on the slats of the dock; his toes go back and forth through the water, back and forth, back, so slowly, and forth.
The little line between Sherlock’s eyes, right above the bridge of his nose, flares into being. “How?”
After a moment, his toes start to drag back and forth again through the water. Back and forth. Back and forth.
There’s a fog rising off the surface of the lake, settling low around the bulrushes, curving around the bases of the old oaks along the edge. The sunrise has been a creeping, lazy thing, peaking only here and there through the clouds, and other than the occasional birdsong, there’s nothing but the sound of Sherlock’s toes, dragging slowly back and forth through the water.
He sets his wine glass down on the coffee table and sits on the very edge of the sofa near Sherlock’s waist. Up close, he can study the line of Sherlock’s nose, the creases around Sherlock’s eyes, and auburn undertones in Sherlock’s curls, and John knows every detail of him better than he knows his own face, every line and wrinkle, every spot and blemish.
“John,” Sherlock says like a chant, like a prayer, and John slips his pyjama bottoms down and kisses damp against his navel, against his hipbone, down. “John, John, John,
He sounds like he’s testing the words in his mouth to see if they sound correct. John kisses them out of Sherlock’s mouth, like he’s accepting them, making them true. “You’re a better man,” he says. “A good man.”
John’s not dreaming, but he could be. It feels like a dream: out of place, out of time, a little bit. Sherlock is somehow incongruous with
Sherlock hums, but he doesn’t startle. He must have been paying closer attention than John thought. “Don’t know what you mean.”
looks. John looks back, absolutely unflinching, and says, “You don’t have to prove we can have a quiet life, Sherlock. You’ve been
The cottage had been at the end of it, shadowed by an enormous oak and gardens bursting with fresh greens and marigolds and stalks of foxgloves, with bright blue shutters and a matching front door.
“I don’t think you can know that, though,” Sherlock counters, but he lets John pull him in anyway. “Not for sure. There are a lot of would-be Moriartys out there, you know. Lots of would-be Marys, too.”
They’d spent the better part of the day exploring that space, that familiar distance, to see how it might move differently now. They’d wandered through the afternoon, finding paths through the wildflower meadows, curving along the edges of the trees. They’d ducked in between the branches, to where the air was still cool and dark, smelling of earth and of something undeniably
They’re both being a little ridiculous, but it’s surprisingly comforting, actually, to not be the only one. John nods too. “It’s not like we’ve never slept next to each other before.”
It’s about hips. Elbows. Necks. Gasping breaths and parted lips and eyes that focus too hard and on too much and hands that lose their way, beautiful in the moonlight, desperate in the dark.
“It’s a cottage,” Sherlock had responded cheekily. “You can put the bags in the bedroom through to the back—there’s just the one but there’s a lilo, ought to be fine.”
“Yes, well,” John says with a smile, watching their hands together. “We take care of each other, I think.”
to want them. And I don’t know—I don’t know how to take all that back. Or how to let you see past it. I don’t know how to show you what you need to know, so you’ve got to tell me.”
One of the books is a book of poetry, and John imagines Sherlock reading it out loud into the hush of the evening, his voice deep and careful over the words, his eyes flicking up to John’s every so often when they really meant something. He couldn’t have imagined it before, but he can now.
Across the pillows, Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “You make it sound like I’m pinning you out like a butterfly.”
John wipes his hands on a dry tea towel, makes a fresh mug of tea, and follows Sherlock out into the back garden.
Sherlock doesn’t answer that, not with words. Instead he kisses John again, and John can hear what he doesn’t say with every press and pull, with every give and take.
“John,” Sherlock says, and John can hear him rolling his eyes, “don’t be obtuse.” He pulls back to look at John properly, his eyes cleared if a little pink, his mouth softened, and he adds, “I thought it was the right time too. Well, bit late, maybe, but then I always am waiting for you to catch up—”
The whole place feels like a secret treasure, a hidden sanctuary tucked away into an English countryside that feels more like wilderness than farmland. There’s something almost sacred about it, about the pillars of the trees and the vaulting arch of the sky, and as John watches Sherlock pass through the neatly trimmed garden and out into the meadow beyond, the long grasses and bright wildflowers reaching all the way up to his knees, John feels like he’s only just brushed the surface of everything there is to discover here.
There are places Sherlock has been without him. There are places he has been without Sherlock. There are stories they could write, or re-write, or leave behind.
splayed across the blue-flowered sheets, sparking up spines and flashing into thighs, drawing tighter and tighter, tenser and tenser.
So John had nodded, and he’d settled his head back against the makeshift pillow, and with the heat blowing warm on his feet and the smooth rumble of the car beneath him and Sherlock’s steady, watchful presence beside him, he had been asleep again before they’d even hit Marylebone Road.
Now, he’s here, in some hideaway cottage with Sherlock’s hideaway heart in his hands, looking at a stack of books Sherlock might read aloud to him before leaning in to kiss him with poetry on his mouth. He’s here, watching Sherlock sleep by the light of the fire, watching Sherlock as he breathes in, and he knows the way Sherlock’s mouth tastes, the way Sherlock’s hands feel, the way Sherlock’s heart beats, as fast as a hummingbird’s, in time with John’s own. He knows how
He’d dressed in a daze, packed a few things without thinking them through, and gone downstairs to find Sherlock waiting with the same sort of Land Rover-type thing he’d driven before, way back when, idling at the kerb.
Sherlock shrugs; there’s new tension in his shoulders. “It was a perfectly understandable reaction.”
Sherlock doesn’t look at him, though, keeping his eyes on the grass, and John ducks, trying to find them, catching Sherlock’s gaze from underneath. His eyes, his giveaway eyes, are wet.
to himself to get the timing right, the way they each look in t-shirts with worn collars and pyjama bottoms that tend to run too short on Sherlock and too long on John. They already know how to move around one another, a familiarity born of late nights stumbling home from cases, of caring for concussions and bullet wounds, of meeting in the hallway drenched in a nightmare’s sweat, too exhausted to care about things like the privacy of sharing a sink.
The wind picks up through the bulrushes; a bird somewhere trills into song. Out in the water, John’s bobber dips and wibbles, even drawing an inch or two of the line out, but then it goes still again.
So when Sherlock turns to hand him a rod, baited line swinging precariously out over the water, John does the only thing he can think to do.
Sherlock has all the building blocks, all the individual pieces that make up the feeling that lives in John’s chest, in the insides of his elbows, the corners of his mouth. He just needs to thread them all together.
“Countryside. Nothing dangerous; wear something comfortable. I’ve got your toiletries together already, bring a change of clothes or two.” There had been a pause, and the hand on John’s wrist lifted away. “Two, I think.”
“What is this place?” John had asked finally, following Sherlock in and looking over the hodge-podge little sitting room.
John wishes he were more surprised. He wishes he could say he’d never seen this coming, that he’s shocked and hurt and horrified and can’t even think straight for the unexpectedness of it: that Sherlock would accept whatever John gave him.
had been on the tip of John’s tongue, but he hadn’t asked it in the end. Instead he’d let Sherlock take his bag and herd him into the passenger seat, and wondered at how much it didn’t bother him not to know.
“You don’t have to be afraid of that, you never have to be afraid of that again,” John says, pressing their foreheads together, closing all the distance until there’s none left. “Not of that. Never of that.”
He thinks Sherlock is thinking about the pill box, and their inbox bursting with cases, and the way lives can start over if only there’s love enough to raise them carefully from the ground.
John doesn’t have to say anything either. He kisses Sherlock’s forehead one more time, and that says it all.
He’d drifted off sometime after dinner to the sound of the old record player in the corner, which was still playing a soft, scratchy cello. John had been finishing up with the dinner dishes when Sherlock had disappeared into the sitting room, ostensibly to select a book or two to pass the rest of the night, but once John had poured himself another glass of wine and come to find him, he’d found this instead: a stack of books on the coffee table with leather covers and worn-out spines, and Sherlock, eyes closed, breathing steady.
He’d imagined it eager and earnest and sweet; he’d imagined it sleepy, so soft it could almost not even be real. He’d imagined it relaxed, and stressed, and biting with anger, slow and lingering with disbelief and uncertainty; he’d imagined it in the shower, pressed up against the tile, slick-hot and desperate, and he’d imagined it on the front step, pressed up against the door, giggling, in the back seats of cabs and behind trees in parks and in Lestrade’s office and between the open doors of an ambulance, as a whisper and a reprimand and a demand and a giving and a total, unadulterated relief.
“How can I prove it to you?” John murmurs, watching him. “You’re so good at seeing this in other people, when someone’s crossed that line for someone else. Do you want to measure my heart rate? Watch my eyes dilate compared to different people in different light? One of the first things you taught me, even—what do you say? Hesitation on the pavement always means there’s a love affair?”
They’d kissed again, just there inside the door, and again in the kitchen, with Sherlock propped up against the kitchen table. Kissing to cheeks and to wrists as they put together a couple of cold sandwiches from what was in the fridge, as easily as if they’d always done it, as if they’d always been this way, slotting kisses into their usual domesticity as though it’d always been there, even though it hadn’t been tangible.
For years, John had not done it, because in all the ways he’d imagined it, he’d imagined that they’d
“Didn’t he, though?” John had asked gently. “It’s been thirty years, and you still know his name. Isn’t that how we survive, in the end? Isn’t that how a life goes on?”
It’s the way the kiss lingers, the trail of John’s mouth down Sherlock’s jaw, down his neck, down his shoulders. It’s in the way Sherlock tilts his head back and gasps, a little, when John bites down where neck and shoulder meet. It’s in the way his curls crush against the pillow and the way his hands pull at John’s shirt and the way his hips rise up and up.
John knows Sherlock. Knows how to move with him, when to move around him, whether to move for or against him. Knows how to live with the noise and the music and the science in the microwave, the panics and the vague, roundabout apologies, the laughter and the constant running, running, running.
Across the pond, the sun has crested over the tops of the trees. The dawn is filled with the sound of birds singing and frogs chirping, with the breeze and the warm smell of sunlight in the grasses, and Sherlock’s hand is cool when John finally reaches out to take it.
He doesn’t answer right away, and John wonders if he’s ever thought of it in those terms before, if he’s ever asked himself that simple question.
There is Sherlock, hands a little shaky and a little tentative, belly a little tender when John reaches out to touch it, breath a little uncertain on all his edges as John slips underneath his sleep shirt to lay a palm flat on the bare curve of his waist, to stroke his fingers along his skin. There’s a scar shaped like a dimple where he’d had an appendectomy before John knew him and a scar shaped like a thumbprint where he’d given his life before John knew Sherlock loved him, and he’s real and warm and alive and right here, right here.
Sherlock shakes when he comes, clenching down hard around John’s body, arm wrapped tight around John’s shoulder, knee hooked hard around his better leg. He shakes like it hurts, gasping and wrenching John closer, and John follows after him.
Something cold settles into John’s stomach, but it’s not as sharp as it used to be. It’s more like pressing on a bruise so faint it can’t even be seen on the surface anymore—nearly healed, though tonight it’s here
“I missed you too,” John says, and then the last thread of cold in his stomach finally dissipates, letting John go, letting him breathe for the first time in years, and John hadn’t even known he was holding his breath until all the air comes rushing in. “I missed you too.”
Into the night. Into the dark. Into an oblivion, shining with fire and soothed with kisses more breath than anything else, leading them past the life they’ve lived together and into something totally and entirely new.
He’d imagined it standing in the sitting room, catching each other’s gazes in the mirror over the fireplace: what it would be like, just then, if he turned, if he took Sherlock by the wrists, if he asked, “Now?” He’d imagined it over the breakfast table, sharing newspaper pages back and forth, laughing into each other’s tea-tinted mouths, on the sofa, reaching across the distance between their two chairs.
Sherlock shrugs, pulling back just enough to reach down beside them and pick up the mug of tea again. It’s probably gone cold from its seat in the cool, shadowed dirt, but Sherlock just wipes off the bottom a little and takes a sip before offering it to John, who shakes his head.
He sees rare bookshops and antique markets, Sherlock’s fingertips trailing gently over creased leather and rusting bicycle handles, telling stories about people he has never met. He sees the dust caught in the shafts of light, turning secluded library corners into secret worlds for a kiss or two, and lazy afternoons spent meandering with nowhere particular in mind.
Look it's been two years I know BUT I'M HERE and I said I would finish this fic and now I'm finishing this fic and if you are one of the folks who subscribed two years ago and then promptly forgot about this, hi hello!! I love you!! Fancy meeting you here!! I think probably life in the last two years has not been as grand as I would like it to have been for you all (pandemic, yikes) but I hope things are starting to turn around. There's a light on the horizon and we'll make it through! <3
John shakes his head. He wants, badly, to take Sherlock’s hands, to pull him close, but instead he only sneaks his own hand across the mattress, waiting for Sherlock to take it on his own. When he’s ready.
Sherlock’s hair catches in the breeze, just the tiniest bit, lifting the curls from his forehead as he looks up toward the line of the treetops, and John wonders again what they’re doing here, but he still doesn’t ask.
Sherlock’s jaw works for a moment, like he’s trying on various answers to see how they feel. “What makes you think I need to know?”
It had been comforting, actually, in the way deeply familiar things are comforting, to know that Sherlock was aware of him, watching over him in some instinctive, deeply ingrained way, and for a moment John had wanted nothing more than to reach out and put his hand over Sherlock’s on the gear lever.
It’s about their two hands angling for space between them and their two jerking hips chasing and chasing faster and faster, it’s about the thrust and the power and the skittering pleasure that winds and builds and wraps them closer and closer, it’s about wanting, it’s about needing, it’s about every case they’ve ever solved and gone home to go to bed alone, it’s about every dinner they’ve had across the table from each other carefully not touching, it’s about every time they’ve looked for one another and
He looks at Sherlock, at his toes swishing back and forth through the water, scaring away any fish that might have been inclined to investigate their baits, and thinks about the chances he might still be missing.
“I think that no matter where you go, what you do, I’m going to follow you,” John tells him. “I think we’re going to spend the rest of our lives together. That’s the way I think things are.”
Sherlock likes it too, if the way he relaxes into it is anything to go by. He seems familiar with it, though he doesn’t say how, or why. John doesn’t ask.
looks beautiful out here, standing among the flowers as he raises John’s tea to his mouth and drinks.
“Stay with me, Sherlock,” John whispers into his dark curls, laying his palm flat so he can feel the beating of Sherlock’s heart, so very like his own. Strong now, beating slow and even, beautiful as the breeze creaking through the eaves.
“Oi!” Suddenly, a pillow bounces on your face and both of you collapse into giggles again. Whatever this is (because it isn’t quite sex yet, is it?) is so unlike any other encounters you ever had. Is this how it was supposed to go? Or is this unique? You have no frame of reference. Either way, it is spectacular the way feelings, talking, laughter, sparks of passion all flow into each other near effortlessly. Maybe this is why sappy romance films talk about falling in love with your best friend.
hypothetical situations get filed away in this room next to this one preserved moment. John already has a room dedicated entirely to him, filled with his likes and dislikes, family members, birthday, other inane information like that, plus all the things you enjoy about him. Clearly some rearranging will have to be done so these two rooms connect at some point. What should this new room be called? The “John Sexual Attraction room”? … John Sex room? An involuntary shiver flutters through your body while your mind is far away. You are definitely no longer bored.
Thank you for reading! :) Naturally, I found a typo and a phrase I didn't like almost as soon as I hit "Post" so it's been very minorly updated. SIGH!
Once again fighting to maintain self-control, John closes his eyes and sets his jaw. Despite his best efforts, he can’t hold back a soft grumble, annoyed with this odd coy game while he stands dripping rain water on the rug. A couple heartbeats go by, and he feels a bit steadier, so he decides to play along and properly looks around the room. Really looks. And the longer he does, the more he is sure he must have slipped into an alternate dimension version of his flat. The desks, mantle and bookcase have all been tidied and dusted, no longer looking like a paper bomb went off in their front room. There was a still steaming mug of tea on the cleared off and gleaming coffee table near the sofa. And, the most damning evidence of all this was some kind of hallucination pulls a quiet gasp out of John’s chest.
John’s eyes squint at him now, somewhere between amused and concerned at the prolonged eye contact, and looks down at the dishes instead. “For that case? Is that what you’ve been working on all night?”
A wet sensation on your belly greets you when you surface again, just to the right of your navel. Involuntarily, you curl away from the contact, abdomen muscles tensing. John pulls away in surprise but then looks up at you with a dangerous sparkle in his eyes.
“Did Watson go down alright tonight?” Sherlock asked, watching John’s hands unwrap the antiseptic sheet.
John rummaged around the top shelf of the kitchen cupboard above the kettle, feeling rather than looking, for what he was searching for. Tea bags...tin of beans...packet of crisps...first aid kit. “So how did you go from chasing a suspect to get glassed in the face?”
“Yes, probably,” John agreed, lightly dabbing at the cuts, eyes squinting to pick out any flecks of glass now visible once the blood was mopped away.
When Sherlock stood up it became apparent that Harry was almost exactly the same height as her brother if an inch shorter.
“Of course I’ll have you,” he said, before falling into another deep stare, eyes flickering from John’s hand at work to his lap and the frayed ends of the fireside rug. “Lord knows, someone has to teach the girl cool logic and rational thinking to combat her father’s frankly reckless behaviour,” he added.
A small reciprocating peck from John was enough to bring Sherlock back to his wits and he stumbled away.
The glass came away cleanly and Sherlock gave no reaction but a squint of his eyes and a small intake of breath.
“Yes of course I bloody well am,” he snapped. Then after a beat, “look at yourself.” A wave of his hand breaking their physical connection.
John leaned in closer, watching the firelight flicker off the cuts and counting each splinter he noticed. One, two, three….four.
A wavering half smile graced Mycroft’s mouth for a mere second. He leaned over to Sherlock, clasping a wrist.
"Just let me know," John said. "Remember, I'm still countin' on you for some payback. Or some... pee back."
Watson. Instead, he was going to address himself completely to the issue of the pumpkin and why Mrs Hudson’s pies had such chemical perfection. The question of Jamie Rowe, and the question of Dr Watson, would percolate in the subconscious of his mind while he studied the inner alchemy of the largest native squash.
He shook himself, and tried to re-orient himself to reality. What he was actually hearing now was jazz. What he was actually smelling was coffee and grilled onions.
"Come with me," Sherlock said, whisking John out of the reception hall and into darkness. Down and down they went, through hidden doors and mysteriously unmanned checkpoints.
At the sound of their code words, Sherlock pulled away immediately, and started to help pull John's jeans back up. "What's wrong?"
Long sidling licks, up and down the sides of John's cock. When John started to enjoy that too much, Sherlock switched up and went down to laving his balls.
Holmes had ruled the music on their long drive back from Illinois on that long mission to rescue Cinda. He wouldn't forget how far Holmes had gone to help him bail out a comrade. Holmes had put his body on the line. Literally.
Jon's face was radiant, smiling. He was still in that elegant suit but he'd loosened his collar. And Jon was applauding with his whole heart.
John’s bladder was screaming. Seriously. If he dawdled too much he might not even make it to the bathroom, it was that bad. Regretfully he gently nudged Sherlock's arm off his waist - if Sherlock squeezed anywhere below his navel they'd both live to regret it.
John finally got his chance just a little bit before dawn on December 23rd, when Sherlock had finally succumbed to heavy post-research exhaustion and lay like a snuffling pile of rags on the living-room couch.
Sherlock shivered. For a long time, he leaned up against a tree and seemed to go into his mental reserve state. It was amazing to see that, with his jeans half down his thighs and his protruding cock at half-length.
Sherlock turns his hand over and folds John’s hands into his own, carefully meeting his eyes in the low light. “I missed you,” he says. “I had no idea I was going to be so affected. I was
Known, understood, trusted, believed: told in lips and those short breaths Sherlock makes when he’s worked up about something, told in the gentle movement of Sherlock’s jaw and the hard clasp of his hands and the human sound of his heart.
John doesn’t think Sherlock is thinking about any of that, though. He thinks Sherlock is thinking about how this place feels
, and John had kissed Sherlock up against the trunk of some great oak until they were both trembling with it and he’d had to step away.
“I think it does, sometimes,” Sherlock says finally. “But every time we have a new case, I wonder if this is going to be the one. The one that takes you away.”  Sherlock laughs again, a little more self-deprecatingly. “I’m afraid, John. And I think . . . I think I’m tired of being afraid.”
“No, right, it’s not—not even like we’ve never shared a bed, what with that whole case with the paint, do you remember?”
John thinks about this, and he thinks about why Sherlock is thinking about this, and he bends to set the mug of tea down next to a bunch of daisies, rotating the base a little into the dirt so it stays put, and then he pulls Sherlock into him. Sherlock doesn’t unfold himself, doesn’t uncross his arms, but he lets John pull him to his chest, lets John hold him with both hands.
Sherlock had finally looked back at him. His eyes had suddenly seemed fragile, and he had taken a deep breath, and he had asked, “Did you ever say
John almost laughs, thinking of all the different times and all the different ways he’s imagined kissing Sherlock. “I’d have kissed you at the breakfast table at 221B yesterday morning, too, if I’d thought it was the right time.”
This is a meadow that has had time, John thinks. This is a meadow that someone has loved, that someone has wanted, that someone has raised carefully from worn ground back to fertile land.
“Not really,” Sherlock admits. “I thought that because I was doing the logical thing, it would be easy to do. Leaving my life behind, chasing after Moriarty. Maybe it would have been once, but. I forgot to account for you.”
John looks at Sherlock, laid out on an old worn sofa with a sag in the middle and throw pillows that smell like cherry pipe tobacco, and he sees an answer to every question he had ever wanted to ask.
Sitting on a thick wool blanket at the end of a rickety dock side-by-side, legs dangling over the edge, a styrofoam container of wet, dark dirt between them, they’re fishing.
Sometimes it weighs heavy on John’s chest, all the things that have happened, all this time that’s passed them by, all those years he’s never going to get back. All the mistakes he’s made. All the things he wishes he’d done differently or not at all. The chances he’s missed.
It’s an unobtrusive thing. Sherlock keeps it on the top shelf of the medicine cabinet behind the mirror of the bathroom. It’s nothing special; it’s got a compartment for each day of the week, which Sherlock refills every Saturday night after John goes to bed. He’s inspected them, of course—there’s an innocuous little white pill, a bigger oblong one, and a soft-gel. The soft-gel’s just fish oil, of all things. John doesn’t know what the other two are; some other doctor must have recommended them. A vitamin, he suspects, and if he had to guess, just a regular aspirin, which makes John think about Sherlock’s heart, and about all the things Sherlock’s done to it, and all the things John himself has.
Sherlock’s hand presses into John’s back as he says that, as though he can feel the tension about to unspool along John’s spine and wants to stop it at its source. John exhales under the weight of it and finds he has to look away.
John had stared at him, at his little smirk, and looked over the room again, trying to find something in it that might identify what the place was, or who it belonged to. “Is it—Sherlock, did you—did you
Sherlock is a warm, sticky mess beside him in the bed, sweat-damp and beautiful. He’s staring up at the ceiling, but he’s smiling, so that’s all right.
Sherlock had snorted. “As if that’d stop me. No,” he had answered, seriously then, “I couldn’t have bought a house without you because I’d be rather hoping we’d be buying it together.”
It’s the only answer John can give, where Sherlock is concerned. The only answer John wants to give for the rest of his life.
John feels like they’ve been reaching out toward each other for years, orbiting around each other, and it’s not so much that they are changed as it is that their fingertips have finally met across the space they’ve been trying to close for so long.
It’s been fifteen hours and countless kisses since John woke up that morning, and everything is different now.
“Mm. I think we just understood, right then, that this was it, didn’t we? We’re going to be together, and that’s the way it ought to be. Was it not the right time for you?” he teases. “Should I have waited?”
He can imagine a lot of things he’d never imagined before, and as he stands there, watching Sherlock sleep, he imagines what the rest of their lives might look like.
“Mm. It’s . . . nice.” Sherlock’s fingers slip away as he takes the last sip of wine. He studies the glass for a moment, swirling some unseen remnant. “I was here alone, before,” he confesses. “Three weeks. No mobile service back then, no internet, no telly. I couldn’t go anywhere in case someone managed to recognise me before I could even get out of the country.”
. Everything that had happened, Sherlock’s suicide and Mary’s martyrdom, each as fake as the other, Moriarty and Mycroft, two sides of the same coin, the drugs and the gunshots and the drinking and the baby. It’s easier to just say
god, he’d forgotten how Sherlock had laughed, and he’d imagined pressing Sherlock down into the black-and-red tiles of the Landmark, pressing him back into an alleyway because he couldn’t wait to get home, pressing him back into the dusty sofa at Baker Street, filling it again with warmth, with life, following through, following down, telling him, telling him everything.
And he pulls Sherlock in, Sherlock, who is warm and who is heavy and who is grabbing John back, Sherlock who is
“Well,” Sherlock says, smile cracking at the corner of his mouth, “maybe a bit better than all right.”
did that you have to keep paying for so that things can go back to the way they were—you don’t, all right? Debts cancelled. I don’t even
He still doesn’t know everything, but now John thinks he might know enough, and all those endless, cascading possibilities, all those whethers and hows and whys and ifs, are all beginning to coalesce, to connect, taking the shape of something happening
He could be thinking anything, just then. About wildflower types, grass breeds, soil pH levels. He could be thinking about the patterns of seeds, what he could tell about the history of this land from the swell of purple cornflowers on the slope of the hill, from the scattering of meadowsweet along the forest edges. He could be thinking about the ancient days when these lands might have been soaked in battle-born blood, or when these fields might have been forests, ancient and tall, or when this cottage might have been abandoned, derelict, forgotten and left to the birds to nest in its rafters.
When the evening had wrapped itself firmly around the cottage, they’d gone back inside together, rummaging through the fridge for something to make for dinner. John had found himself making spaghetti carbonara while Sherlock had sat on the edge of the table, telling him a story about a dog he’d had as a boy, laughing and gesturing.
There’s the locking of doors, the turning out of lights. John pours glasses of iced water in the kitchen while Sherlock uses the loo, taking them into the bedroom—tiny, wallpapered, lace-curtained, with little blue flowers printed on the sheets—before sliding alongside him in the bathroom to share toothpaste, jostling elbows, watching Sherlock as he inspects some invisible grey hair in the mirror.
It’s Sherlock’s hand in John’s this time. “You missed me,” he says quietly, examining the nicks and burns left behind by reckless experiments, the violinist’s calluses, the blue veins in the wrist. The cold in John’s stomach shivers around itself, waiting for an answer, the last answer, to the very last question.
, he thinks at Sherlock’s tall figure, the dark of his hair and the white of his shirt stark against the soft greens and yellows of the fields around him.
John leans in, slowly, and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, lingering there for a moment. He’s never kissed someone’s forehead like this before. It’s deeper than affection, John thinks, with the warmth of Sherlock’s skin, with the night-sky smell of Sherlock’s hair. It’s tender. It’s
He sees a chance to get away, a chance to slow down, a chance to finally take some time for just themselves. Paris. Cairo. Bangkok. He sees French villas in the countryside, long rows of grape vines that smell sweet and earthy in the afternoon sun, fruit that makes Sherlock’s mouth taste dark and luscious. He sees tall windows looking out over foreign skies, the heart-pumping excitement of the crowds in the marketplaces, the sound of different languages in Sherlock’s voice. Ancient wonders and modern marvels, tourist traps and hidden gems. Flowers tucked behind Sherlock’s ear that he’ll scoff at and blush over but won’t take out.
Sally Donovan had said to him once: an alternative to the rush, the noise, the uncertainty. An alternative to the strops and the shouting, to the drugs and the danger. An alternative to strange and unbelievable and improbable.
Sherlock has a talent for doing the strangest things and making them seem so normal that there’s nothing one can do but go along. It’s dragged John loads of places—into absurd foot chases up and through buildings and back down, through locked museum back doors, down abandoned Tube tunnels—and while John hasn’t always been
Kissing Sherlock isn’t anything like John had imagined it might be, and John had imagined it might be a lot of different things.
“Hush, I’m being serious,” Sherlock says, even though he smiles too, if only briefly. He sighs a little. “You know what I’m like, John. I don’t expect I’ll change much.”
who is stuttering his own breath against John’s mouth, who is making that noise in the back of his throat, and God, Sherlock kisses in exactly the way John had always imagined he would: with everything he has.
“John,” Sherlock says gently, guiding his gaze back to Sherlock’s with two fingers on his chin. He cranes his neck up, kisses John softly. “You are a good man. You
There, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder at the end of a rickety dock, with a fishing pole balanced precariously against John’s knee with only one hand holding it steady, the other hand holding onto Sherlock, holding
It’s easier, like this: to bicker and argue, to jab at one another and make them laugh at themselves. Sherlock finally puts away his socks; John finally finds his phone charger, sticking it into the single free socket he can find; there’s fluffing pillows and poking fun at the sheets that remind them both of Mrs Hudson.
Eventually they’d managed to separate, all small grins and lingering touches, and Sherlock had driven them about a mile back through the winding copses of birch trees and pines before the two-track had given way to a gravel drive.
John kisses him, and the mist rising off the lake starts to dissipate in the morning light, and John’s fishing pole lists precariously to the side and he has to let go of Sherlock’s hand, startled into laughing, to catch it before it falls, and Sherlock takes both their poles and lays them down next to him on the ancient planks of the dock, lines still suspended somewhere out in the water, and he cups John’s face in both his hands and kisses him back.
“Hey there, stranger,” John says, stepping through the meadow as he comes up next to Sherlock, following Sherlock’s gaze out over the rolling hills, toward the line of trees and the dip in the land where the fishing pond must be hidden from view. There are birds calling into the sky, bright and joyful, and the breeze is soft through the wildflowers, turning the heads on the tansies and the buttercups, the ox-eyed daisies and the cornflowers, ruffling them like the soft hair of raucous children, while the stately poppies look on, dotting the land with their coppery-red blooms, and the odd scattering of oxslips and wild parsley play in the undergrowth.
John doesn’t know if Sherlock’s ever been this open with anyone, if he’s ever been this vulnerable before. The look in his eyes says no. The look in his eyes says that he’s afraid right now, and John is
It’s nothing like London, and Sherlock sits next to him, silent and still with his jeans rolled up to his knees, one foot trailing through the water, back and forth, back and forth, like someone else entirely.
“You’ve already changed,” John counters gently. “You change all the time. Your violin playing hasn’t improved much, I’ll admit, but you—you’re different, than you were when we first met.”
Sherlock had laughed again, and had gone over to take bags out of John’s hands, throwing them carelessly onto the sofa. “You should know better,” he had chided, taking John’s hands and kissing the irritation off John’s mouth. “Couldn’t have bought a house without you, could I?”
He’d imagined it hard, and fast, and aching, crashing together in the fall-out of a case, in the aftermath of a nightmare; he’d imagined it tentative and gasping, barely brushing together at the bottom of the stairs in a moment of orbital gravity. He’d imagined it sheerly accidental, a quick goodbye kiss to the mouth in a moment of forgetfulness, and he’d imagined it in candlelight, seductive and passionate and careful, so deliberate, so intentional.
From the corner of his eye, John sees Sherlock swallowing hard. “I don’t know if it’s been enough. All the—all the people, the cases. What if it wasn’t enough?”
and when John finally starts to get his breath back, when his heartbeat finally begins to even out where it’s thudding hard against Sherlock’s, he knows they’re never going to be anywhere else. Not in any way that matters.
There’s only one bedside lamp in the bedroom, barely large enough to light the space while they shuffle their way around, fiddling with their luggage, packing and repacking pairs of socks awkward until finally John runs nearly headlong into Sherlock as he reaches for his shoes and they both stop, looking at each other like deer in the headlights, and laughing.
The breeze picks up a little, making the grasses shift and shudder like waves as the trees rustle and sway. There’s a bee in the buttercups, bumbling and fat; there are birds in the sky, singing and soaring low over the wildflowers.
, with the capital letter out front, than it is to try to spell out exactly what he means each time, the same way it’s easier to say
“I know this hasn’t been easy,” he finally says, curling his fingers closed and then open again, aware that Sherlock is aware of him even when he’s not looking. “I know I’ve made mistakes, and I’ve said things I didn’t mean and did things I didn’t want to, and I
Maybe it should. Maybe it should be shocking or astonishing or whatever else—how simple it feels, how smoothly their edges align as soon as they step together. Maybe it should be uncomfortable, how easily that familiarity moved into intimacy, how easily the distances between them pulled closed.
John goes, and it’s about shifting over, it’s about aligning together, connecting to each other like stars, a constellation of
John had taken Sherlock’s face in both his hands then, brushing his thumbs over Sherlock’s cheeks, and he’d kissed Sherlock, just once, hard and a little fierce. “I said it every single day that you were gone, Sherlock Holmes,” he finally managed, resting their foreheads together. “I said it
“I’m tired,” Sherlock repeats, softer this time, and he sounds like he’s surprised to have said it out loud, like he hadn’t quite known that’s what he was thinking until he’d already said it. His gaze darts away from John, suddenly unsure. “I’m tired, but I don’t know who else to be. I don’t know if it’s—” He breaks off, frowning, his mouth a tight, unwelcoming line.
John meets his eyes. Wiggles his fingers between them. Knows, in his heart of hearts, that Sherlock trusts him. And slowly, steadily, Sherlock reaches out to take his hand.
Sherlock had turned the ignition off and sat quietly for a moment, following John’s gaze out over the water. “Fishing,” he’d said finally.
The sun is warm on the back of Sherlock’s neck, under John’s hand; the wind is cool. The scent of wildflowers washes over them, delicate and fresh, a little peppery underneath with the smell of grass and earth.
of John, of the angle of John’s head against the window and whether it would make his shoulder sore come morning, of whether turning the heat up a degree or so would help him go back to sleep.
of something broken that must have created all this, the cottage and the meadow and all this peace and all this quiet, just so they could be standing here, breathing it all in.
“We’ve got to go,” Sherlock had said, stroking his thumb over the back of John’s hand, just once. “Are you up?”
that’s protecting Sherlock. It’s not these wide open spaces that’s going to catch Sherlock when he stumbles, and it’s not these wildflowers that are going to ease Sherlock into unfurling.
“What do you think?” John dares to ask quietly, reaching up to flick a curl off Sherlock’s forehead. “Shall we head to bed?”
John had stepped forward, back into that space he’d wanted to stand in for so long, and Sherlock seemed to open around him, letting him in. He’d stood between Sherlock’s knees with his hands on Sherlock’s arms and said, “It sounds like you loved him.”
He’d woken up again as the car rolled to a stop, and then he’d had to blink away the disorientation for a few moments.
The night in Sussex is deep and dark, sort of hushed in a way that London never is. There’s no faraway pulse of music or rumble of lorries or  wails of sirens. There’s no light from the orange streetlamps filtering in and no lingering smell of grease and onion on the air, and it feels smaller, somehow, closer, but also wider and broader, like falling into the sky itself, like being lost at sea with nowhere else to be.
John pauses, his mug halfway to his own mouth. The breeze picks up a little, rustling through the grasses.
John thinks, watching Sherlock through the window over the kitchen sink as he meanders through the back garden.
It’s about pausing and catching their breath; it’s about rushing forward, shifting clothes out of the way, finding new places of bare skin. It’s about places they have touched before with worry in the place of joy—changing bandages, inspecting wounds—and rewriting a history here for themselves.
each other somehow, that they had both known in some ephemeral way that this was it: this was their choice.
He takes the mug from Sherlock’s hands and pulls him closer, slipping one hand back around his waist until he can feel the shuddering breath trapped in Sherlock’s lungs.
He had thought Sherlock might have been aware of that too, but he hadn’t done it, the same way he hadn’t turned his hand over upstairs. “You’re sure you’re going to be all right if I sleep?” he had asked instead, ignoring the thing about popular fiction.
John starts again, quieter this time. “I told you once that you were the best and wisest man I knew,” he says. “The most—the most human human being. I meant it then, you know, I really did, and then I spent two years being
“It’s important that you know. Before I go to—well, we’re already in bed, but before I—before I cross this space. Between us. It’s important that you know I’m not just trying this on for size. I’m not just taking what’s on offer.”
John laughs, and carefully pushes himself out of bed to trek out to the bathroom, cleaning himself with a wet flannel in the sink before throwing a clean one in to Sherlock. He takes their glasses of water for refills—entirely necessary after the physical exertion of the evening—and then climbs back into bed.
It was quiet. Almost too quiet. They had sat in the silence, listening to the rumble of the engine as they watched the fog rising through the rushes and reeds. Sherlock had made no move to get out.
John shakes his head. “I do know it,” he insists. “I know it for sure. No one could take me away. No one could stop me from following you.”
, Sherlock. It’s just what you do. And it’s been brilliant, and fantastic, and so will anything else you decide to do. So do whatever you want, all right? Try a few things on. Be a writer. Get a half a dozen dogs and drive us both crazy. Be a beekeeper, or a gardner, or take up knitting, if you like. Become a pirate finally.” Sherlock laughs. “Doesn’t really matter, Sherlock. Are you happy being a consulting detective? Are you excited, when a new case comes in?”
Sherlock is still looking at the trees when his bobber dips, once, then twice, and goes still again.
“Not for us,” John says, shaking his head. “Not the way we were. You asked me to believe in you, Sherlock, and I did, I did for so long, and then right when it mattered, I stopped. And we both paid that price, and we’ve both done some pretty awful things, so whatever you think
, somehow, even with all the evidence of time in the land and the cottage around them. Like when the world was made.
They already know the beats and rhythms of the end of a day together, the way Sherlock likes to take forever in the mirror to inspect his hair, the way John brushes his teeth while humming
It wasn’t the laughter, though, that had made John pay attention. It had been the silence in the wake of it—the way Sherlock ducked his head and studied his hands when the story came to an end, the quiet turning thick and contemplative, a little melancholy in the low light of the kitchen.
Sherlock’s smile had twitched. “Yeah, of course,” he had reassured. “I’ll wake you up if I need it.”
“Hey,” John soothes, “Hey. Of course it’s been enough, Sherlock. It would’ve been enough if it had only been once, yeah, and you’ve solved hundreds of cases. Some really important cases. You solved
John wants to take Sherlock’s hand in his. John has wanted to take Sherlock’s hand in his for a thousand years, it seems like.
John had glanced over. Sherlock had been concentrating on the road, or so it had seemed, but Sherlock was usually concentrating on more than one thing at a time, and John had known just then that Sherlock was
John watches him from the doorway, sipping at a glass of wine and tracing the line of Sherlock’s body with his eyes: the tilt of his head, the line of his neck, the length of his legs. One of his hands is splayed out over his belly, where it moves ever so slightly with every breath Sherlock takes, slow and even.
He sees rolling green hills and gardens bursting with lavender and honeysuckle and wisteria, two pairs of slippers side by side at the end of a bed, the grey dawn filtering through lace curtains. Well-worn paths trailing along babbling brooks and clandestine retreats under weeping willows. The flair of Sherlock’s coat as he crouches down to see a toad or a mouse, the excitement in his voice as he learns something new, the shine of his smile as he looks back up over his shoulder. A writing desk pushed up against a window, sacrosanct space in a workroom overflowing with pictures and books and test tubes. A skull on a mantlepiece; fresh laugh lines around the corner of an eye.
Once they’d meandered back to the cottage, there had been tea in the back garden, sitting side-by-side with their shoulders pressed together the same way they’d sat that morning. They had talked about everything, and about nothing, and John had wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s, watching the lavender light of day deepen into velvet twilight, and thought that he was maybe, finally, beginning to learn how to listen to Sherlock’s silences. That he was beginning to learn how to hear the things Sherlock doesn’t say.
When John had finally blinked his eyes open, Sherlock had been standing in the doorframe, half-silhouetted by the light in the hall shining gold around him like a spirit, half-illuminated by the cold blue numbers on John’s bedside like a ghost. They had read
It had still been mostly dark, with just the barest hint of dawn approaching through the blue and violet shadows. They were pulled over just off a two-track road along the edge of a long, winding sort of pond, lined with long grasses and tall reeds still frosted in the dawn. The heavy mist rolling off the water nearly obscured the line of trees on the opposite shores, ancient oaks and creaking pines that rose up like sentinels.
“We’re going to be all right,” Sherlock says, minutes later, or hours, maybe. He’s ended up on his back, stretched out underneath John with one hand petting over John’s lower back as if to make sure he doesn’t slip away. His hair is a mess from being pressed into the cushions and it makes him look unbearably soft; John doesn’t bother to resist the temptation to slip his fingers into the curls. “Things are going to change, but we’ll be all right. We aren’t the men we once were, and I think—it’s okay. Good, even.”
A year ago, two years ago, not knowing what Sherlock was up to would have made panic well up in John’s belly, oil-slick and black, but things had changed. John knew better than that now. John
In that primal, elemental way only certain things can be known, John knew that whatever he might imagine, it would only ever happen because they both knew: that this is right, and this is now, and this is them.
“I don’t know.” Sherlock looks away, squinting back out over the water. “Either, maybe. I’m not the easiest person to live with.”
It had been uncomfortable to think about, actually. The unknowableness of it. Sometimes even frightening. John had not particularly wanted to examine all the wheres and hows and what-ifs of a life he couldn’t be sure he’d get to live.
It couldn’t happen because there was a threat, or an ultimatum; it couldn’t be an alternative, a whatever-remains. It couldn’t happen just because it was a last chance, now-or-never. It could only happen because they
John had imagined it again for the first time in years, indulgent and furious and heartbroken, the night Sherlock had reappeared, breathing and standing and
“You don’t have to be anyone else,” John says as they drift apart, between lingering kisses and soft breaths. “Solving crimes isn’t who you
But Sherlock doesn’t say anything. He studies John for a long time, there in the moonlight, and then he rolls over onto his back, staring up at the ceiling. His profile is pale and soft in the darkness, and John can’t tell what he’s thinking.
He’d imagined that it would have changed everything, and maybe it would have, but maybe it wouldn’t have. It hadn’t mattered, because John hadn’t done it.
John thinks, watching Sherlock wrap his arms protectively around himself, turning his face up to the early afternoon sun. Something more than the confession of shared breath and soft kisses exchanged in the early morning mists. Something more than just the thing sparking between them. Something about the quiet, maybe, or the peace.
. We’ve been separated. Apart, from each other, and I just. I just want to live our life together now. Any kind of life.”
John then chuckles his way into the kitchen to start the kettle boiling, leaving you deep in thought.
“I don’t know! Maybe you wanted them. Or maybe you hate the mess. I wasn’t exactly thinking clearly with all my blood to my brain otherwise occupied, Mister Holmes. I just grabbed a handful and ran back.
“Maybe you should have gone to the store after all.” Sherlock quips, trying humor to diffuse the weird, tense mood. He sees John’s mouth twitch at the corner and finds himself relaxing. It had worked at least a little.

There comes a point when Sherlock rises back to the surface from his Mind Palace, sees the now-cold tea and the untouched plate of biscuits at his feet, and it occurs to him that he anticipates it rather than being surprised. That’s new. When did that happen? His brows pinch together minutely but he is tired now and the self-reflection is difficult, unpracticed.
“Sherlock?” John’s blue eyes were on him. His question was thick with meaning – What's wrong? Can I help? Do you want to give up and go home?
“Yes, well.” The blush that tinges his high cheekbones wasn’t completely voluntary, but so long as it helped the narrative, then so be it. The rest spills out in a quick, clipped barrage of words: “It involves a romantic relationship and I find I’m a bit out of my element. Have to do more research on emotional reaction. Would you be amenable?”
That therapy technique is something my own Therapist gave me years ago. Maybe I should show her this to prove I remembered it!
John’s partially collapses onto your torso and squeezes his elbows against your waist as he giggles.
When was the last time someone touched you with such gentle affection? Honestly, you probably would not have let them. Were this anyone else, you would have been
“I need your assistance with navigating certain emotional interactions." Pale eyes widen at Watson’s smirk in response. It was barely on this side of predatory.
“Yes.” You hold his gaze with intentional heat, trying to will the full, explicit meaning from your brain to his through eye contact. To your delight, not only does he receive the message that you are ready, he growls out an enthusiastic groan as he slowly, carefully removes his fingers from your body.
Thankfully, finally, Sherlock takes over then as John is at a loss. Pressing his hands into the arms of the chair, he pulls himself to his full height, adjusting the jacket of his suit. He lifts the mug off the table and closes the gap between them, offering the tea.
In one fluid motion, John cuts off your train of thought by pushing forward and up. Warm, rough lips are on yours. Startled, your eyes widen, but you see his are closed and tense – He's decided to gamble everything on this and you are paralyzed. John ebbs back when nothing happens, and your body aches at the missing warmth.
He rubs his hands over his face lightly and allows himself a soft sigh. Emotions are so... thick, and heavy. Thoughts are lightning fast, and he finds he can hop easily between them, back and forth. It’s
John watches him, thoughtfully chewing on pad thai. Often, Sherlock will face away toward the windows when he plays, but this time he deliberately turns to face into the room. To John’s curious surprise, it seems he had deliberately chosen songs more modern that he typically plays, full of drama and emotion. Was that for John’s benefit? Seems logical...
boredom. Your chest clenches slightly at the thought, not wanting it to have been a pantomime birthed from your imagination. Except maybe the embarrassing growling stomach bit, that can stay fiction. So far, the joint aches and warmth do nothing to disprove you are still in the sitting room recovering from a rough nap. But then, the ‘couch’
bored by the saccharine displays and taken control by now to get to the point, get it over with. The urge to take, to overrun, to press and press until you get what you want, is all still there – thrumming in time with the pulse in your throat – but this is not a race to paroxysm with a casual stranger to clear your racing mind. This was a man you know and live with and work with. A man that loves you. You would rather be dragged to hell than push too hard and shatter that. You want
A sense of déjà vu and irony flood Sherlock so completely, all he can do is stare and smile for a few moments. He hears his name and the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs, snapping him out of it. Soon, John comes around the corner in his pajama bottoms, old grey t-shirt and bedhead to find Sherlock crouched down, gathering up the errant snacks.
Someone was either ambitious or overly cautious. Though, anyone was possible to be both of those things at once, it was John Watson. He must have seen your thoughts on your face, because you hear him give a nervous huff of laughter.
Looking up through your lashes with a very intentional roll of your hips, you mirror his words from just after breakfast: “So... Where were we?”
Just like that, the battle between mounting frustration and attempted patience to see this experiment through was over with a clear victory. An already blush-splotched face fills in with a deeper shade of red, and an unintended pout forms on his mouth. Both thoroughly over this conversation and trying to ignore the twist of confused hurt under his sternum, Sherlock Holmes whirls toward his bedroom door including a billowing of his shiny blue dressing gown for maximum drama.
Later, while cuddled together watching telly, you run your fingers along the arm of the couch, smiling at the sensation of the leather surface. Aside from the skull, you didn’t take a lot of stock in talking to inanimate objects but it felt appropriate to give a mental ‘thank you’ for rolling you onto the floor this morning.
“Mm. Yes, thank you.” Their eyes part again, and John sets about the now well-honed motions in the kitchen. Sherlock beelines for his laptop and sprawls out on the sofa, typing away.
Despite the current empirical evidence, it is difficult to believe this is real. Maybe you did fall asleep in the nest on the sofa after all, and your touch-starved body was imagining the leather as a warm body. Maybe that was the ineffable need that had you aching this morning but couldn’t place why. Even as you think this, John’s hands slide inside your dressing gown to grip gently on your ribs, then slide feather-light down your sides to settle on the top of hipbones, never ceasing his soft kisses. It feels like your nerve endings light up in bioluminescent ripples under his palms, cascading sensation into a shiver.
“Speaking of picturesque arses...” John leans and presses his mouth to yours, reaching to grasp a handful of your flesh. You make a noise of derision into John’s mouth, disagreeing with his assessment. In your estimation, running about with poor nutrition and years of treating your transport as an afterthought have left your backside woefully inadequate. You weren’t entirely joking about John’s arse, though. His recent army muscles with the results of a slightly more sedentary life covering over them was a delightful combination of firm and pliant
John starts to move, pulling you back to reality. There is a detangling of limbs, murmured words of comfort and love. You don’t know much more after that; sweet, gentle kisses on your face send you off to sleep.
“What are you thinking about that has you smiling so hard?” He smiles back at you, nude and unbelievably beautiful in the light of the sun streaming in the room. He moves to the bed and slides in close.
The hand on your shoulder starts to pull away. Before you can overthink and let the moment slip away, you reach up to clasp your hand over John’s. Very deliberately catching his startled gaze, you give his fingers a gentle squeeze. To your absolute delight, a faint pink blush appears on his face and the tips of his ears.
. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to take a little bit of control here, return some of the adoring affection he had been doling out generously. You smile, putting your hands on his shoulders to push just enough so you have room to stand. You press your lips to John’s once, quick but firm, while pulling his tucked shirt out of his jeans. Both hands slide up under his jumper to his underarms, until he relents to putting his arms up and being disrobed. Once the neck of the jumper has popped off his head, he is grinning with his eyes closed. It is impossible not to grin back, even if he can’t see it. His delight, his sense of humour, the way he finds pleasure in sometimes inanely simple things can be infectious. It was irritating at first. You did not see the benefit of childlike wonder or being ‘easily amused’, but lately you seem to smile and laugh so much more. Begrudgingly, you had to admit it was superior to being haughty and sneering all the time.
Thank you very much for all the kind comments and kudos. It has been a real pleasure to connect with people on this little sliver of my mind. One more chapter for these two sillies.
When the doctor said nothing about the dishes being off the floor the next morning, Sherlock allows a pleased smirk to settle on his face, assuming it had gone unnoticed and therefore “Case Closed”. However, frustratingly, he found himself dwelling on that last errant thought in between his other endeavors over the next couple of days. It harries him like a pest, invading his few precious quiet moments. By the third morning with it on his mind when his eyes open, he stalks out of his bedroom wearing naught but a barely-cinched dressing gown and a scowl - cornering a poor, unsuspecting John in the kitchen as he put a kettle on.
Sherlock ran a hand through his hair, only for it to catch on the ladybird clip. He played with it absentmindedly as John went about sealing up the second cut.
He had escaped the scuffle with a minor concussion - the result of John’s heroism and his head meeting a brick wall.
“Dinner’s on you then,” John said wiping his hands with antibacterial gel before peeling back one of strips from its paper. Snipping it to size he placed it across the largest of Sherlock’s cuts and pressed down gently.
Sherlock had been expecting the question. When he didn't answer, John gave a squeeze of his hand and said: “Sherlock?”
“For once, can you just act like every other hospital visitor and remain ignorant of my maladies? I’m fine.” Sherlock emphasised his last word through gritted teeth, his head giving a tight pang which he felt behind his eye and at his ear - a mock from his transport as if to say ‘you are far from fine’.
But before John could finish his exclamation, Sherlock had silenced him, sealing the limited space between them with a firm kiss.
“I know a place...well I know several places.” Sherlock uncurled his hand from the hem of John’s cardigan and let it rest in his lap.
So in tune, he was these days, to the sound of tiptoed feet across the landing - Rosie’s bedtime routine of exploration and hiding before sleep - that the hushed sound of footfall on the stairs was enough to jerk John awake from his doze at the fireside.
John made out yet another ghost of smile on Sherlock’s lips. The shadows of the dying fire giving his friend’s face a grave tone.
And then the eleven short words seemed to exhaust him for John’s eyes slipped closed for a few seconds, the half smile faltering, the tense pained look he wore in his sleep returning to his brows.
She was already taking out a cigarette and handing it to him. “Gotta walk fucking miles mind. Can't even smoke in the carpark anymore. It's a bloody joke if you ask me, if there was ever a time you could justify a fag it's when you're in a damn hospital.”
Her hair was short and sandy brown, nose pink from the early spring air, eyes bright in a face that was prematurely lined.
“Nothing much,” Sherlock answered, and then before Harry had a chance to question further, he said: “There's an unwritten rule in our flat banning the talk of siblings. My brother's a cock, we don’t mention him unless it’s 100 per cent necessary. Sometimes we don’t mention him and he’s sat in our living room.”
When she discarded her raincoat, a heady mix of fresh air, rain and smoked Superkings engulfed the small space between them.
Not the dignified tears that their mother often tried to hide when faced with Sherlock’s ‘episodes’ as she called them. His could scarcely be concealed by neatly folded tissues and watery sympathetic smiles.
He had had a frantic, manic, sense of urgency to speak to Mycroft about something. The guard at the door had told him to wait out on the street while they called someone.
It had taken Mycroft’s intrusion into his private devastation to remind him that he was in fact in dire need of things such as painkillers, sleep and - if nothing else - a strong tea.
The lack of the rhythmic tapping of an umbrella on the tiling as Mycroft’s footsteps faded down the hall, made Sherlock look to the now vacant chair.
But then when they had had dinner after John had delivered a fatal bullet thereby bringing their first case together to a blunt end, Sherlock had looked at him anew.
The cold realisation in his words, coupled with those damn Watson eyes boring into him made him feel simultaneously anguished and nauseous.
John cupped his fingers under Sherlock’s jaw and dabbed at the fresh wound, mopping away any excess blood. He gave it the professional once over before saying, “lucky for us, the cuts aren’t too deep so you won’t be subjected to my rusty sewing skills. These should do the trick.”
Sherlock had been staring unseeing at John’s hand, it was only when it moved fractionally towards him did he actually notice the direction of his gaze.
Harry shifted closer to the detective, her shoulder now damp with exposure. She smoked some more before saying, in a voice a lot quieter than it had been: “But he’ll be alright?”
In the few months that they had known each other, Sherlock had realised that not only was John the very best heart to his head, he had a way of knowing a lot about Sherlock instinctively - his moods, his behaviours, his habits - even if Sherlock's reactions to these things remained somewhat alien to John. Maybe this was a normal occurrence when two people were able to cohabitate relatively harmoniously over an extended period time. But Sherlock suspected they were particularly well matched.
He kept twitching, hands swiping down his front every few minutes, as if an electric current was sparking - pain hitting a pitch that needed to be addressed.
John leaned in to get a better look. The wounds were not particularly deep but the instrument that had caused them had been sharp, no doubt the attack had been expected and partially combatted. A twinkle of something at the edges of the cuts - different from the rain shine of Sherlock’s trousers - suggested splintering, glass then. The placement of several small gashes in a compact space pointed to the weapon being a bottle of some kind rather than a single shard.
“I’m doing a morning shift at the surgery tomorrow, maybe Mrs Hudson could have Rosie and we could do something afterwards?”
Experience had taught him to always carry bobbles and bobbypins close nowadays because toddler hair would not be tamed by will alone.
After one or the other had no real need for any further assistance, they would both slip back to either sides of their invisible line until the next trauma or illness pushed them together again.
“Ten to nine,” Mycroft said, looking at his watch. “Morning.” Then, with the eagerness of a man who had suddenly thought of a tactful way of leaving the room without seeming rude, he said: “Time for tea, I think.”
Sherlock didn’t answer but, knowing John, that would be enough for the older man to understand that yes, things were a bit not good.
“I met your sister,” he chose to say, unsure himself why this had any weight in conveying his feelings.
Sherlock felt himself both mentally and physically brace for Mycroft’s introductory comment, surely a ‘we knew this was going to happen sooner or later’ or a ‘this is why you shouldn’t get involved’, but his guard was unneeded.
A mop of dark curls appear from behind the door, a pair of light eyes scanned the scene in the semi darkness.
His temples were throbbing, his back protested from his slouched position in this horrid chair, his arms and hands ached from executing chest compressions.
“Mmph ‘erlock,” John said, his hand gripping the bedside rail to stop himself being pushed sideways.
Descending stairs led to further darkness, nothingness. A cellar, usually stocked with information, turned up cold.
“You can stop dabbing that same spot if you like, John, I think you’ve cleaned it quite sufficiently,” Sherlock said with a slight coldness to his tone. His head jerked away just a fraction.
At the sound of the final step of the stairs squeaking, the quiet thud of quality shoes on wood, John breathed.
for tomorrow’s bedtime. I heard it’s a real cracker, you should read it with us after dinner,” John said, edging forward slightly.
He shuffled to the kitchen, passing the table where an experiment involving parchment paper and Coco Pops had been left abandoned by his daughter and flatmate earlier in the day.
Mycroft had come out, impeccably dressed, bringing with him a faint scent of coffee, expensive cologne and the office’s papery bureaucracy.
John's skin was cool, rough at the tips, and despite dealing with a near-fatal injury his grip was strong.
Balancing the stick of the umbrella in the crook of his arm, he brought the lighter to the cigarette between his lips and clicked.
“Good God, is it not enough that I've been stabbed you're going to give me a heart attack as well?” John said, his hand brushing over the patch of lip where Sherlock had just been.
In the few seconds when his mind had caved to a heavy black weight of impact, the suspect had landed his blow and so had John.
“Good, I may need your assistance,” said Sherlock, closing the door behind him with one hand, his other pressing a handkerchief to his face.
“John...” A breathy moan slips past your parted lips. Your hips move of their own volition, seeking him out. There is a warm pressure building up somewhere inside and it is both transcendent and torturous. “More. Please...”
It’s difficult not to stare as you move to sit at the kitchen table. This seems like your normal John – part time GP, part time crime-solving partner and blogger, full time flatmate, lover of earth toned jumpers and a splash of milk in his tea. But there is a whole new lens now, sharpening certain details that didn’t seem important before. You see the involuntary signs all over him: the remnants of a smile linger on his face when you accept the offer of food, how he turned his body at the stove so he won’t have his back to you anymore even though he was focused entirely on the pan, and the way he left your eggs in the pan a bit longer than his own because he knows you aren’t a fan of runny yolks.
beneath you and you rocket up to full wakefulness with hope in your throat. Peeking an eye open, you notice several things at once, but most prominently: it is now afternoon judging by the quality of light, and, happily, you are definitely not in the sitting room.
Apologies for the long down time between chapters. My creative juices were being stubborn, and then they thought of a new story and went on a tangent before I could wrangle them back to this story. I am feeling rather pleased by how this turned out. Not bad for a first try? I have a few things I would like to work on after working through this first story, so hopefully I will show improvement moving forward.
