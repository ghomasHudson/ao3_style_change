“Are you sure Dean? That’s a big step isn’t it?” Castiel questioned.
He never had to say it. It was obvious how he felt for Cas when he introduced the angel as his devastatingly handsome boyfriend and bragged about him whenever he got the chance, when he woke Cas every morning with soft kisses and called him sunshine, when he somehow always gravitated towards Cas, some part of him always brushing against his partner, as if to make sure he was really there. After Cas had gifted Dean his grace in a little vial so that they would be able to grow old with each other, Dean even fed Cas with the pie he had made for himself that morning because “now that you can taste food again, I’ll be damned to waste another day without you trying some goddamn homemade pie”. Dean’s feelings were obvious whenever Cas woke up at night and Dean, although sound asleep, pulled him a little closer as if he wanted to tell him that he was safe. It was crystal clear how Dean felt about Cas because he was so openly, blatantly in love with him, it was impossible to ignore.
[Cas 10:37] No, my feet are perfectly fine, why would they be cold?
“Do you mind telling me why you dragged me out of bed this early?” Cas muttered, shivering in the cold morning air. Dean sat down next to him on the hood of the Impala and wrapped a blanket around his grumpy boyfriend. Dean scrambled to find the right words. “Fuck it”, he whispered almost inaudibly. Cas tilted his head in question. “You know I’m not good at this, expressing my feelings and everything...” He lifted his head to meet Cas’ eyes. “I love you Cas. And I need you to know that”. A nervous smile flickered across Cas’ face. “I love you too, Dean...” he cleared his throat “...But... I know how you feel for me. So why did we drive here in the middle of the night? Is something wrong with you? Are you ill?” His eyes scanned Dean, as if he was looking for a sign what was wrong. Dean let out a nervous laugh. “No man, look, I just... Damn it, I can’t even do this right”. He ran a hand over his face before looking at Cas again. “See, I never told you that I love you, but you deserve to hear it, even if you know it anyways.” Encouraged by Cas’ fond smile he took his hand. “And... umm... so this is just a stupid human tradition, but with you being human now maybe you’d like to... umm, so...” Dean bit his lip and exhaled sharply. “Do you want to marry me, Cas?” Without hesitation, Cas broke into a smile and nodded. “Yes, I would very much like to do that”. As the sun started to rise in the background, Cas cupped Deans face and admired him for a moment, then Dean leaned in and kissed his fiancé deeply. In between kisses, he murmured against Cas’ lips “I love you, I love you so freakin’ much.”
He’s never really said it. It just didn’t feel right. It wasn’t that he hadn’t come to terms with his feelings, he knew now for nearly a decade how he felt about Cas. It also wasn’t fear of what John – he didn’t refer to him as his father anymore – would think, or rather do, if he knew. Dean couldn’t care less about his father’s opinions these days. He was happy about who he was. He was out and proud to a point were Sam got annoyed by the amount of gay jokes Dean made. (Charly reassured him that Dean would eventually “grow out of it”, that it was completely normal to obsess about his newly embraced identity after having suppressed this part of himself for so long, but Sam wasn’t so sure about that.) So yeah, it wasn’t like anything held Dean back anymore from saying those three words to Cas. He just ... didn’t.
Lost in thoughts, Dean adjusted the flower on his lapel and smiled at the mirror. He never thought that he – Dean fucking Winchester – would ever get married. And yet here he was. His phone buzzed and his smile became even wider as he saw who texted him.
[Dean 10:39] Sure thing, sunshine, but don’t worry about acting right, it’s your wedding day, all you have to do is enjoy it. And everybody here knows you’re a little weird😉
The party afterwards was one for the books. Everyone had a blast and surprisingly enough, everyone got along perfectly, which wasn’t exactly a given on a party were hunters and supernatural beings came together. Donna’s and Jody’s wedding cake was mind-blowingly delicious. It was a white cake with three tiers and a figurine of the happy couple on top, wearing their trademark flannel and trenchcoat. When they cut the cake open, it revealed a colorful surprise. The top tier was colored like the bisexual pride flag. The second tier was chocolate-brown and the bottom tier looked like a rainbow flag. Dean insisted on feeding Cas with some cake and “accidentally” smeared frosting on Cas’ face. After he had kissed it away shamelessly, which earned them loud cheers and whistles from their guests, Dean pulled his husband onto the dance floor for their first dance.
Without a knock, Charlie barged in. “What’s up bitch, you ready? Cause your fiancé is and he’s smokin’ hot.” She winked as she noticed Dean’s blushing cheeks. “Yeah, I’m ready. Where’s Bobby?” “Already waiting downstairs for you. I have to go, see you in a few”.  As quick as she had come, she disappeared again. Dean took another glance at the mirror to make sure everything was perfect before he left the room.
Claire and Jack came up to give them their rings. Claire handed Cas a ring and whispered: “Congrats Ca... Dad”. Cas froze up for a second, tilting his head, squinting his eyes, trying to understand if she really just meant that or if it had just slipped out on accident. When she gave him a shy confirming smile, he pulled her into a strong hug. Jack handed Dean a ring with a “Hello Dad” and a short hug, before tugging on Claire’s hand to pull her back to their seats. The almost married couple shared a confused look after what just happened, Dean opening his mouth to ask “Did they just call us..?” “I believe they did”, Cas replied happily.
[Cas 10:34] Dean?
They linked their hands, their wedding rings shimmering in the warm afternoon sun. As they finally attempted to leave the ocean, their knees almost gave in, suddenly unfamiliar with the sensation of their weight after having floated weightlessly in the water. After a short struggle and some giggles, they made it out, helped each other out of their BCDs and dropped into the warm sand.
The party carried on deep into the night, roaring rock classics long having replaced the quiet couple-dance music, everyone partying on the dance floor or sharing stories and laughs at the bar. As the newlyweds sat down to chat with Sam and Eileen over some drinks, Cas looked at his husband lovingly. He was overjoyed to see Dean beaming happily from being among all the people he loved, no danger in sight. As Dean caught Cas starring, he gave him a gentle peck and got up. He linked their hands as they strolled towards the lake, the party sounds fading into low background noises. They leaned up against each other, the reflections of stars and fairy lights glistening on the water as they held each other close in the cold night air. Dean nuzzled his nose into Cas’ hair and pressed a gentle kiss on his head. Cas turned to see Dean’s glowing eyes and pulled him into a long, achingly tender kiss. They were home.
[Cas 10:38] Oh. I see. I’m nervous that I might act weird because I don’t know all wedding customs. So I wanted to ask if you could maybe help me out when I’m about to make a fool out of myself.
As they broke through the surface and ripped off their masks, Cas’ eyes beamed at Dean. He smiled widely and started to ramble: “Dean... that was incredible! Did you see that puffy fish in the cave? And the rainbow ones nibbling on the corals? The sounds they make are very endearing. I wish we could have stayed down longer.” Pouting, he added: “Why do humans have to breathe, this is utterly inconvenient.” He tilted his head. “I was never aware that the ocean was such a pleasant place to be in.” “So you liked it?” Dean asked with a big grin, happy to see Cas this excited. “I loved it” Cas admitted, biting his lower lip. “Thank you for pushing me to do this”. He pulled Dean into a tight hug. Dean cupped Cas’ face gently and gave him a soft peck. “Thank you for getting over your fear and sharing this experience with me. It was wonderful.” Then quietly, he added: “You’re wonderful Cas. I love you.” Pulling Dean in for another kiss, Cas whispered against his lips: “I love you too, Dean.” His lips tasted like salt and Dean pushed against them hungrily, making up for the last hour that they didn’t have the chance to kiss. As they finally pulled apart, they leaned their heads against each other, breathless but happy.
Charly placed Cas’ hand in Dean’s. “Hey handsome! Missed me last night?” Dean whispered with a wink. “Hello Dean. I missed you very much indeed”. Murmuring “Me too”, Dean softly leaned his forehead against Cas’. The grooms stood there for a moment with closed eyes and fond smiles on their faces, the longing for each other almost unbearable. Cas finally pulled away and stated softly: “You are incredibly beautiful”. He turned towards Sam. Dean blushed at the seriousness in Cas’ voice and slowly turned to face his brother as well, not without glancing at Cas’ concentrated face once more and shooting him a loving smile from the side. While Sam held his unsurprisingly deep and thoughtful speech, Cas slipped his hand into Dean’s, who squeezed it lightly in response.
The rest of the afternoon they just stayed there, holding each other tight, sharing lazy kisses and basking in the warm summer sun. Dean dozed off at some point, exhausted from the dive. Cas watched him sleep, listened to his soft breaths and felt incredibly lucky. He tenderly brushed his fingers over his husband’s sun-kissed freckles, admiring how beautiful he was. He peppered little, ever-so-gentle kisses on every spot he could reach, Dean’s hair, his forehead, his cheeks, his shoulder. He cupped his face and let his thumb slowly trail down to those soft, pouty lips he loved so much. As he lightly brushed over them, Dean turned his head to kiss the palm of Cas’ hand before he searched out his lips. Cas gave him a short, incredibly soft kiss, before pulling away to look at him again. Still sleepy, Dean let out a grumpy groan at the loss of his lips and pulled Cas back down energetically. Cas understood and crushed his lips into Dean’s, turning him on his back and straddling him. Dean buried his hands in Cas’ hair, ruffling it up while he passionately licked into his mouth.
When it was time to say their vows, Dean took Cas’ hands in his and started shakily: “So, uhm, I’d like to start if that’s okay. Cas – you’re my best friend. And you’re the love of my life. I never thought I’d ever say something like that, I didn’t exactly think love was in the cards for me. I never let anyone close. But you...” His furrowed brows softened, and he broke into a fond smile, adopting Cas’ little head tilt. “You immediately got to me – well, right after I stabbed you... Sorry for that, buddy.” He winked and Cas chuckled softly. Dean continued, his voice overflowing with love: “I love your weird, quirky personality. I love that you’re such an openhearted, adorable little dude and at the same time you’re brave, strong and one hell of a badass. You never stop surprising me. You have the most loving, pure and beautiful soul.” Dean’s voice started to crack. “You know me better than anyone, heck, you probably even know me better than I know myself. You looked into my soul and you love me for exactly who I am, which is the best gift you could have ever given me.” Firmly holding Cas’ gaze, he added seriously: “I promise to always love and support you unconditionally, in our human life together and beyond. I’ve been yours ever since you first laid a hand on me. And I swear I will be yours for all of eternity. I love you Cas, so damn much.”
When he got Cas back from the empty, he immediately hugged him like his life depended on it, not entirely sure that this wasn’t just a cruel dream. When Cas hesitantly whispered his name, he interrupted him with a sigh. His right hand grasping Cas’ hair, he buried his face in the bow of his neck and grumbled “You can have me. Of course you can. Always did”. He squeezed him once more before he pulled back and was met with the same expression of pure adoration that he saw last right before the empty ripped Cas away from him. He loosened his grip in Cas’ hair and let his hand slide down to cup the angel’s face instead. Cas understood Dean’s longing glance at his lips and bridged the gap between them, letting his lips touch Deans ever so softly. Dean felt himself melting into their kiss, first hesitantly, then more firmly, his lips parting to taste Cas’ tongue against his own. When they stopped to catch their breath, foreheads resting against each other, Dean mumbled in a raspy voice “Never do this again, okay dude? Never leave me again.” The moment was perfect. He didn’t need to say anything more and he wouldn’t even have had the time. After the two were forced to sit through a quick obligatory welcome-back-to-life-round with the others, Dean pulled Cas into his room where the angel showed him happily what the pizza man had taught him.
Sam moved on with the ceremony and let them repeat some more promises to each other before posing the final question: “Do you, Castiel, take Dean Winchester as your lawfully wedded husband?” Cas answered earnestly “I do.” Sam turned to Dean to repeat his question: “Do you, Dean Winchester, take Castiel as your lawfully wedded husband?” Dean grinned widely, eyes crinkling around the edges: “Hell yeah, I do!” Sam asked them to exchange their rings to seal their bond and Cas took Dean’s hand gently in his. He slipped the ring on slowly, looking deeply into Dean’s beaming green eyes. Dean then slipped a ring onto Cas’ finger, his fingertips lingering longer than necessary. Sam finally pronounced them “...husband and husband. You may now kiss your groom!” Under the roaring cheers of their loved ones, Dean cupped Cas’ face while his husband pulled him close, arms wrapped around his waist. Their lips found each other easily, all of their adoration blooming into a chaste, soft kiss. Cas spontaneously bent Dean backwards, who gasped into his mouth in surprise, before letting himself fall into the strong embrace. Their kiss deepened, both too far gone to hear the excited cheers and whistles around them. It took them a while to gather the strength to break apart, foreheads resting against each other for one more moment before turning to the cheering crowd. Dean linked their hands and raised them up, as Sam exclaimed loudly: “I present to you Mr. and Mr. Winchester!”
Dean always beamed with happiness whenever Cas spoke those three words. Ever since he got back, he’s been constantly saying them. He said them when he woke up to Dean’s kisses, when they went to bed, when they finished up some chores, when Dean made him wear a cowboy hat to watch old westerns and when Dean made him smile with a silly joke Cas didn’t really understand. He must have repeated those words a million times, but somehow, they never lost their meaning. Cas always stated them like a fact, so sincerely and honestly, like he was stating a universal truth. And although Dean never failed to reply to Cas’ declarations of love with a kiss, a loving smile or a simple “and I you, Cas”, it wasn’t the same as actually telling Cas himself that he loved him. And Cas deserved to hear it.
As the sun set over the ocean, they separated, their eyes still burning with desire. Completely out of breath, Dean brushed some lose strands out of Cas’ face and whispered a soft “I love you”.
Dean rolled his eyes, amused at his fiancé’s confusion.
Now that he was completely sure that Cas wasn’t going to panic, Dean started to take in his surroundings. He had always imagined that it would be nice to dive, that the underwater world would be absolutely stunning, but now that he was actually experiencing it, he kept glancing to Cas. Sure, he too was impressed by all the colorful fish around him and he loved how the sunbeams broke through the surface and illuminated the blue that seemed to swallow all colors the deeper they went. But the best part was experiencing all of this with Cas for the first time and seeing the pure joy on his husband’s face. The only sounds down here came from fish nibbling on the colorful diversity of corals and from their own breath, sucking in air from their tanks and blowing it out as bubbles. It was peaceful. As they glid past corals and all kinds of wonderful creatures, Cas kept tugging on Dean’s arm excitedly, pointing out rainbow-colored fish, a turtle and even a little squid that swam past them. Their time went over way too quickly.
Lying awake yet again, Dean ruminated about this topic yet once more. He felt so incredibly lucky, the love of his life sprawled over him, breathing quietly, Dean’s hands running through his hair and over his back. He never thought he could have this and he had been okay with it. Just having Cas in his life was enough for him. But now that he had everything he could have ever possibly wished for – living a peaceful life in the bunker with Sam, Eileen and of course Jack, who visited them whenever he could, real freedom to do whatever he wants for the first time in his life and, most importantly, the love of his life sleeping in his arms – he would be stupid to take any of this for granted. To take Cas for granted. To not show him the love and appreciation he deserved. To not tell him. A smile found its way onto his face as he checked the clock. He had been awake since 2am. Now it was almost 5am. He gently brushed over Cas’ cheek. “Cas? Wake up sunshine” Cas grumbled, clueless why Dean would wake him at such an ungodly hour, but he felt that Dean was up to something. After some very convincing wake up kisses he agreed to get up and let Dean lead him to baby. After a short drive, Dean parked at a nice viewpoint.
“Are you nervous?” Sam teased Dean, who stood in front of the mirror, tugging his tie straight. He thought about it for a moment “Excited? Sure, can’t wait to see Cas again after you forced us to spend last night apart for some stupid tradition. Nervous? No. It’s Cas I’m marrying.” Sam smiled knowingly, already half out the door. “I’m very happy for you two!” Alone again, Dean’s eyes drifted back to the mirror and he placed his hand on his shoulder, right over Cas’ handprint. He meant what he had said to Sam. It had been the first night they had been apart since he got Cas back and he barely slept. He had just felt wrong without hearing Cas’ gentle breaths, without being able to wrap his arms around the former angel and without feeling the weight of Cas’ head on his chest. But was he nervous? Not at all. He was almost surprised at how calm he felt. He’d never been this sure about anything in his life. After today, he would never have to spend another night without Cas.
Castiel couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face. “Good. Cause I was going to find out even if you didn’t.”
“I’ll text them. Got to let our brothers know anyway.” Dean put Jack down and made him promise not to run off before pulling his phone from his pocket.
Castiel just nodded, not trusting his voice this moment to speak both because he didn’t know how his voice would sound and also cause he was scared of blurting out the reasoning behind it. He had a plan for after dinner and he didn’t want to spoil it. After a minute of silence he felt more composed and felt safe to talk. “I promise when we get home I’m going to make you feel so good.”
“I have a surprise for you.” Was all Castiel said by way of explanation.
“I’m gonna be an uncle!” Sam said excitedly as he looked at the picture.
“Yes!” A little voice called back.
“You do?” Castiel asked hopefully.
On his next thrust Dean added a second finger, then adding a third a few minutes after, before long Castiel was begging for Dean’s dick, but Dean was enjoying the teasing, so he kept going, until even he couldn’t resist the sounds Castiel was making and moved back to slick himself up.
“Yes please.”
“Cas, I was only joking. Dean loves you, everyone knows that.” Sam tried to reassure him.
“Dean, I think my water just broke.” Castiel said, trying to keep his voice calm.
As soon as Dean had settled, he lent down and whispered into Castiel’s ear. “I want you to fuck me.” Castiel moaned from hearing those words alone and quickly shifted them so that he was now the one straddling Dean’s hips. Castiel then lent down to capture Dean’s mouth in a searing kiss, biting Dean’s lower lip gently as he pulled back enough to move his lips to Dean’s neck once again. Placing his hands on Dean’s hips to keep his balance, Castiel ground down against Dean, his jean clad erection pushing against Dean’s. Dean moaned and leaned his head back to allow Castiel better access to his neck, the feeling of Castiel’s erection pushing against his stronger for him as he was only wearing a thin pair of boxers. After a minute of griding against each other, Castiel pulled back slightly, just enough to get his own shirt off without pulling too far away from Dean. As soon as his shirt was off, Dean grabbed his pants and started to fumble with the button and zipper, desperate to get the denim out of the way. Whilst he was doing that, Castiel somehow managed to get his head around Dean’s arms and latched onto one of Dean’s nipples. Castiel felt a surge of satisfaction in feeling the shiver that ran through Dean as soon as Castiel’s lips touched him, and the moan that he let out was obscene, his hands falling away from where they had pushed Castiel’s jeans to his thighs, one hand gripping the sheets below him, the other making its way into Castiel’s hair to hold him in place, his back arching to push into Castiel’s mouth. Dean’s moan as Castiel gently scrapped his teeth across his nipple was much louder than any noise Castiel himself had ever made in bed, and it was making Castiel harder. He felt proud that he was able to make Dean let out a sound like that. As Dean was still making satisfied sounds, Castiel didn’t want to pull away, but he had to. Dean let out a groan of annoyance and frustration as Castiel did pull back, but Castiel assured him it was just for a moment, as he quickly stood up and completely removed his jeans, then deciding to just strip his underwear off as well, pulling Dean’s off of him before he crawled back up the bed to settle over Dean again.
“Yeah, I guess that would look bad.” Dean said, looking expectantly at the waitress that was walking their way with a large juicy steak. As their meals were placed on the table Dean grimaced at Sam’s plate. “Why are you always so healthy. Live a little man, eat something with a bot of fat and flavour occasionally.”
“Yeah I am, why?”
“He looks like he loves it.” Jody remarked, gaining Castiel’s attention.
“I need to stretch you first Cas” Dean replied.
“Well, I can assure you that I certainly want to see you again. That is of course if you do to.”
Sam laughed thinking of the class he had, Dean was going to be bored listening to this lecture. “Literary theory and criticism.”
“So why are we in a literary whatever class then?”
“Maybe I could come to the class with you then. I’ve never been in a college class, could be fun. What class do you have?”
“Come here baby, let me do the work.” Dean said, as Castiel curved his body so he was laying on Dean’s chest. With a quick swivel of his body, Castiel was laying down and Dean was on top of him, pushing inside him slowly at first, until Castiel’s desperate whine reached his ears then he sped up, thrusting hard and fast, looking for the right angle until he found it, Castiel hooking his legs around Dean so that he could try and pull him in even closer on each thrust, his hands tangled in Dean’s hair, pulling it occasionally and sending extra waves of pleasure rolling through Dean’s body. He loved when Castiel pulled his hair.
“Do you have the ring?” He asked excitedly.
“Of course I want to go. When are the viewings?” Castiel asked.
Dean asked cheerfully. There was a lot of noise in the background, and Crowley guessed that Dean had answered the phone as he was still working on a car, not having left the garage to do so.
“Of course. You didn’t really think I was going to ask you to get rid of our baby did you?” Dean asked.
By the sixth month mark not much had changed, except that Castiel was slightly less emotional, and he and Dean had started shopping for items for the nursery. When purchasing the bigger items such as the crib and change table they got them delivered to Dean’s apartment, as they were fairly sure they wouldn’t fit them in the impala, and it was better than sending them to Castiel’s as they would just have to move them to Dean’s place eventually anyway. The smaller items such as clothes, toys and blankets were easily placed in the trunk and bought home with them.
“I can see someone is excited to be a big brother.” The nurse acknowledged.
The next two months saw Dean and Castiel preparing even more thoroughly for the baby. Now that they were living together it was easier to make sure that they had everything they needed as the nursery came together. Around the time Castiel reached his eighth month, he stopped going into the office for work, instead working from home, do as much as he possibly could. That continued for two weeks until his boss told him as he was so close to his due date, and babies could come early especially if he was stressed that it was time for him to start his maternity leave, so Castiel did. He didn’t like it very much though. He was used to having a busy schedule and always having things to do. Now though all Castiel had to do was sit around the apartment reading books or watching tv all day until Dean got home from work. Around lunch time every day he would receive a call from Dean, just checking in on him, always ready to rush home if Castiel went into labor, and Castiel would assure Dean that he was fine, just a little bored.  He had also taken to going for a walk every day, usually doing so right after Dean had finished his call. He would spend about an hour outside enjoying the fresh air. As soon as Dean would get home from work he was always super attentive to Castiel. As much as moving in with someone could take some people a while to become accustomed to the new arrangement, Dean and Castiel had settled into it immediately, as thought they had never lived apart. Dean was the happiest he could remember ever being, and he could see that Castiel was equally as happy. All they had left to do now was start counting down to the due date, the day that they would finally meet the little bundle of joy that they had created together.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh, crawling into bed next to Dean in just his boxers and settling into the comfortable mattress, his muscles relaxing. Dean wriggled one arm under Castiel’s body and pulled the younger man into his side, his other arm moving to rest with his hand on Castiel’s abdomen. “Was the bed really too empty, or did you just want to touch me?” Castiel questioned, unable to hide the smile on his face.
Suddenly the last bit of control Dean had maintained snapped, and he came all over his stomach with a shout of Castiel’s name that could probably be heard from the lobby of his building, his hole clenching tightly around Castiel. The extra pressure that Castiel could feel on his cock tipped him over the edge too, and he buried his face in Dean’s neck to muffle his own scream of Dean’s name.  As they both came down from their high, they disentangled themselves from each other and laid down, Castiel placing his head on Dean’s chest, while Dean placed his arm around Castiel. After lying there a while, they had both regained control of their breathing enough to talk.
The family all said their goodbyes and left, thanking Dean and Castiel for a nice night and congratulating them on the baby. When everyone had gone Dean and Castiel moved upstairs to their room, Castiel suddenly spinning fast and pinning Dean to the door with his body as soon as it was closed behind them. “Thank god their all gone, wanted you all night.” He murmured, before leaning in and pressing his lips hard against Dean’s.
“Really Dean? You just spent the last hour and a bit staring at Castiel.” Sam sighed.
“How do you feel?” Castiel asked him. The line of questioning made him feel like it was his first-time having sex this way, but he had gotten to know Castiel pretty well the last few weeks and he was simply kind and caring by nature.
“I love you Dean.” Was all Castiel said before kissing Dean hard.
“But you love it so much when I fuck you.”
“Yes. I wish you had told me, but I am happy about it. It’s kind of perfect timing I guess.”
“It was a part of it.” Castiel admitted. “There is one other part though.”
Dean looked down at it, unsure what it was for a minute before a memory came flooding into his mind and he knew what it was and what it meant. He looked back up at Castiel and saw the fear in his eyes. “You’re pregnant again!” He stated, not sure what else to say.
“You thought it wouldn’t go well?” Dean asked teasingly.
Pushing the door open softly, Dean peered around it and was shocked at the sight he saw. Castiel was on the floor next to the toilet, with arms wrapped around his legs that were pulled up to his chest, his head buried as deep towards his chest as he could get it. When Castiel looked up Dean could see that his eyes were red and swollen from crying, fresh tears still running down his cheeks, his nose red as well, presumably from the tissues that were pilled up next to him. “Cas? Are you okay?”
“Apparently so.” Castiel said, looking at the couch instead of his boyfriend’s face. “I can’t believe this! I have bottomed once since before Jack was born and I’m pregnant again.”
On his next thrust Dean added a second finger, then adding a third a few minutes after, before long Castiel was begging for Dean’s dick, but Dean was enjoying the teasing, so he kept going. Growing impatient Castiel grabbed the lube and slicked up Dean’s cock, but when Dean didn’t move, Castiel removed his fingers himself and pushed Dean onto his back before lining up and sinking down in one smooth motion.
“That’s good. My niece was a little slower as well but now she has a better vocabulary than most of the kids in her class, so don’t worry. Jack will be just fine.”
“Cas, look at me.” Dean said, squeezing his boyfriends’ hand reassuringly. Castiel reluctantly opened his eyes and looked at Dean. “You can do it.” Castiel shook his head and opened his mouth to speak, but Dean didn’t let him. “Yes you can. You can do this. You are the strong one of the two of us. If anyone can do this it’s you. Just one more push and this part will all be over.”
“I’ll leave him here with you for a bit, just press the call button when you’re ready for me to return him to the nursery.” She said, smiling at everyone before stepping through the door.
“I love you Dean” Castiel whispered when Dean moved back to kiss his neck once again, moving down his chest and stomach as well, to kiss where there new baby was growing.
“Do you need any help?” Castiel asked politely, startling Dean a little as he was now standing just behind Dean, one hand on his upper left arm. “Sorry.”
Dean was about to speak when there was a knock on the room door and the nurse came in with the baby. “Time for a first feed.” She said as she handed the baby to Castiel, Dean grabbing Jack and settling him on his own lap so that Castiel had room.
“If everyone would like to sit here for a minute, we will be right back.” Dean said, grabbing Jack from Sam and running into the house, Castiel walking slower after him. Upstairs in Jack’s room Dean and Castiel quickly got Jack changed into the perfect outfit that they had found, having decided that he was going to be the announcement. On the front of the shirt it said, ‘I’m going to be…’ and on the back it had ‘A Big BROTHER.’ They were quite proud of the find and thought that it was a brilliant way to say it. Castiel then changed his shirt as well, putting a jacket on over it so that it wouldn’t be seen straight away. His shirt said ‘I’m carrying’ with a picture of their last sonogram underneath the words. Going back downstairs they paused just round the corner from the back door, reminding Jack of what his instructions were, and going outside themselves, Dean grabbing his phone so he could capture the reactions of his family when Jack told them the news.
“Goodnight Castiel.” Dean replied.
“Hold?” Jack asked.
“Yeah, I’m ready. Just need to have a little chat with Sam before we go though.” Dean said as he grabbed Castiel’s hand and tugged gently as they both started to walk from their room and downstairs to greet Sam and say goodbye to their two boys. As they got closer to the first floor of the house the noise grew louder. As they reached the final step Sam came running into view, closely followed by two young boys. Jack (8) grabbed a hold of Sam’s hand and tried to pull him hard enough to get him to fall over, whilst Kevin (6) grabbed Sam’s leg with both his little arms and legs and held on as tight as he could. Sam just laughed at the extreme effort the two boys were putting into trying to beat him and grabbed them quickly, one boy in each of his long, strong arms, holding them effortlessly even as they wriggled and tried to break free. They were all laughing so loud it took a minute before they noticed they were being watched.
“But what about work and space Dean? I’ve only been back a few months and now I’m going to have to tell my boss about this and start organizing the maternity leave again. And this place is only big enough for the three of us, we can’t fit another kid in here.” Castiel explained.
“Hey Jack.” Sam said, smiling largely at the boy in his arms before turning to his brother and Castiel. “He can almost say Uncle Sam.”
“God you’re so big Cas, it feels so fucking good.” Dean moaned.
“Well, you looked pretty interested in my lecture, so I figured you were a new student. I’m Castiel.” He held out his hand to Dean, and Dean took it, shaking his hand without removing his gaze from Castiel’s face.
“So, they are essentially a second teacher for the class?” Dean was trying to make sure he understood exactly what Sam was telling him.
When the got to the hospital their doctor was waiting for them at the front desk, Dean had called from the car before calling Ellen to ask her to pick Jack up from childcare that afternoon, and got them to a room in the maternity ward as fast as was possible, running through the chart and a few questions once Castiel was settled in the bed. The doctor did a quick check and found that Castiel was already eight centimeters dilated, meaning his labor had progressed very fast and it wouldn’t be very long now before the baby as being delivered. The doctor then left as he had to go check Castiel into the system, not having done so when he first arrived, wanting to get his patient comfortable first, and said he would be back very soon on his way out. Just like with Castiel’s labor with Jack, Dean climbed up on the bed behind Castiel, settling him in the v of his legs and helping him through the contractions as best he could. Everything moved pretty quickly this time around, only an hour later Dean was standing beside the bed holding Castiel’s hand as Castiel screamed and pushed, this time not needing a pep talk as he knew he could do it. Before long there was a loud cry that broke through Castiel’s scream and their baby was there. Dean cut the umbilical cord then returned to Castiel’s side as the nurse cleaned the baby and wrapped it up in a blanket before handing it to Castiel.
Jo wanted some more details, so Dean gave in and explained how he had fist met Castiel properly, and then what had happened we he asked him out. “Now can we get to the clothes please Jo.”
“Don’t worry about it Dean, it’s late so let’s just go to bed.”
When Castiel reached the seventh month of his pregnancy Dean had developed a habit of resting his hand on his stomach whenever he was close enough to touch him, rubbing his hand in an almost massage across the large bump where their baby was resting comfortably, slowly growing. The first weekend into Castiel’s seventh month was moving day. Everything that Castiel was taking with him to Dean’s apartment, now their apartment, was all boxed up and sitting in the front room ready to go. Other items that were bigger, such as Castiel’s bed, couch, chairs and tables were the only things left to deal with, but as they were being put into storage, and were much too big to be transported in either Dean or Castiel’s cars, they had hired a small moving truck for the day that Sam and Gabriel were going to help them with.
Having a desk next to his partner is a blessing and a curse. It's hard to get anything done when she keeps sliding over to crack a stupid joke every few minutes, but it does keep him entertained during an otherwise-boring work week.
Castiel can’t help but smile. He’s such a cute kid. Castiel likes him already.

“Oh, trust me,” Sam says, “we’ve got
The faint sound of sirens can be heard in the distance, growing just a little louder with every passing second. That must be the ambulance. It's about time; Patience should really be getting to the hospital. She can contact her father from there. If all goes well, she'll be home in no time.
Castiel clears his throat, and Dean looks back at him, his smirk as annoying as ever. As long as it's directed at him and not Charlie, though, he's okay with it.
Castiel grimaces. They've been alternating drivers in their two-person carpool for years. This has to be the first time either of them has tried to put a stop to it. Granted, he did it first, but it still stings. He just wishes he could apologize, just get it over with, but with Dean staring at him, that's probably not a good idea.

“Luce --”
Dean just nods once because he has absolutely no idea how else to respond. He helped kill her just a few years ago. That’s probably not an easy thing for their relationship -- or lack thereof -- to recover from. He watches her walk away, waiting until she’s presumably out of earshot before turning back to his friend.

Charlie pops back into the room. "The ambulance is on its way. Can you walk?"
"You see the problem here, too, right?" Jody asks. "You're not
"Are you sure?" Charlie asks warily. "I could've sworn…"
"Ketch?" Castiel says, an eyebrow cocked. He's sure his tone says all the man needs to know.
Castiel shoots his partner a look. What the

"Well, I

"That's what
"He struck a deal," Castiel says. "He's gonna help us get the Vamps, and then he's free to go. Off on all counts."
Work is pretty uneventful. There hasn’t been a new (non-gang-related) murder in at least a month so Castiel and Charlie have just been working on older cases, which is remarkably less fun than taking on new cases but equally as important.
until CastieI started touching the barely-formed blood clots, but he still thinks this was for the best. He can mostly gauge how bad the wounds are, and except for a cut or two that looks to be purposely made with a knife as opposed to just scratches presumably from hitting the ground, he thinks it will all heal on its own in time.
"Cas?" Charlie says again, quieter this time. "Cas, are you home?"
"I'm not sad," Castiel says immediately.
"Agreed," Castiel replies. "We've got this case in the bag. One more murderer off the street
He’d hoped he was being subtle; it appears he was wrong. The old man cocks an eyebrow. “Anxious to leave, are we?”
sure," Dean surmises. "You don't know if anyone's ever told him they love him."
He has a feeling this is going to bite him in the ass, and
“Yeah, gimme a sec!” Castiel calls back. He didn’t realize Jack knew when he leaves in the mornings. He wonders briefly whether the kid also knows when he comes home, and whether he watches the clock when it’s around time for him to come back. He really hopes he comes back at the normal time today. He really hopes he comes back at all today.
"Yeah, he was," CastieI says, though three years old isn't quite a baby so much as a toddler. "It's complicated."

"He won't talk to me," Jody reminds him.

When that conversation winds down, Mary turns her attention to Dean, probably to split up the attention. "What ever happened with Jack?"

"No, I know, I got that," Charlie says. "But what if a woman

That plan is interrupted when they're immediately greeted with a surprised and almost excited "Cas?"

Dean shoves him backwards, and he shoots his hands out behind him to catch himself on the table. "You have

read them, if only to see what Castiel meant. He’d be surprised if Dean lets him leave in the part of the letter that tells his brothers that they can always come to him if they choose to leave the Hunters, but he hopes he does -- and he hopes it works. Castiel hadn’t even considered leaving the gang until he’d found out Sam was going to. Maybe his brothers will be the same way about him.
“Um…” Dean pauses, and Castiel wishes he could see the look on his face just for some vague idea of how he feels about that. “Where’d you hear that?”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Yeah, but you shouldn’t
"What
"Can we meet somewhere?" CastieI asks. "Just you and me?"
"I prefer to think I just misled a coworker," CastieI says, as if that will make this any better.
They lapse into silence again, and Jack goes back to cleaning his cuts. CastieI is left wondering once again whether or not he should get some alcohol out to clean them. He did enough stupid shit as a teenager to know how much alcohol on an open wound hurts, but he really doesn't want the kid to get an infection.
CastieI fights back a sigh. "Then fine, I'll talk to him. Just don't get your hopes up."
"What?" Jack asks. "What'd I do?"
"We thought, hey, if the universe wants it to happen, it might as well," Dorothy adds.
much easier to get a ride with Charlie like he was supposed to, but he has to admit, it was nice to have the time to cool off. Seeing Dean again really put him on edge, and he took it out on both Charlie and Jody. He'll deal with the latter at work tomorrow, but he should probably call his partner now to apologize. He owes her that much.
Sam pauses. "There's someone listening to your side of the conversation, isn't there?"
"Even your brothers?"
Charlie nods slowly. “Okay, that’s fair.” She drums her fingers on the steering wheel. “If they take the Hunters down, are you going to…?”

spending his downtime with Jack. It’s nice to know that he’s okay, but it still stings. They had time to find Benny and Andrea in Purgatory, but neither of them will stop by for a visit?
dead; not just if I get shot -- can you give him this?” Dean slides an envelope between the two front seats.
Casiel glances between the two of them, and he's not sure which one looks more surprised.
Dean chuckles. "Works for me." He straightens it out with his teeth, and, with a little maneuvering, he manages to get it in the key slot. Castiel watches, amused. He knows Dean will be able to get himself free, but it doesn't make it any less fun to watch him struggle.
to do if-slash-when I get in as deep as you."
“What --?”
"We're out of here," Dean says. He waves his pistol towards the door, signalling for his men that it's time to leave. He walks up to Castiel and rests the barrel of his gun against his forehead.
"I promise, Cas, the hospital will
And with that, Castiel heads back home. Maybe this time he can actually go to sleep.
"Huh." Randy shrugs that off. "I'm sure this is going to sound

cops!"
"Google it," Castiel says says simply.
"No, you're not in trouble," Jody says. "All things considered, I think today went fairly well. I think it goes without saying that you're taking tomorrow off to rest up. I'm sure once the adrenaline wears off, you're going to need the break."
"Is it Dean Winchester?" Charlie asks.
"Who was it?" Jody asks.
CastieI shoots him a glare. The two of them barely refrained from killing each other when they were on the same side. It's infinitely harder not to walk over and smack him now that they don’t even have that going for them.
"You got somewhere to sleep?" he asks quietly.
"It happens to the best of us," he promises.
At least, he can trust that Dean's actions, Dean kicking him out of the bunker and his profound silence afterwards, are an unambiguous rejection. A solid statement that no matter what affection he feels for Cas, he is still disposable to Dean. He might as well be a barn cat, he reflects, useful to kill the mice but not welcome in the house. Now that he's lost his claws he's not welcome at all.
“I’m going fuck your face. You can touch yourself if you want. But I am going to fuck you with that knot after I come in your mouth.”
“Dean, you’re so good for me. So good, taking my cock like this. Such a good slut for me,” Cas is rambling. He’s back to stoking Dean’s cock, letting Dean hold the knot inside himself. It’s good, way better than he thought it was going to be. He forgets why he was nervous in the first place. He’s already half thinking about getting a bigger size.
"Not particularly.” There are many things that can be said of the angels but supportive is not one of them.
There are his feet, the vulnerable arch, the tough soles, the hard bone of his ankle. The machinery of his body.
When Cas climbs back into his lap, he straddles one of Dean’s thighs. His thighs are things of beauty and Cas wants to worship them, wants to be buried in them, wants to drag him out of every fucking command meeting where he’s wearing that infuriating thigh holster to fuck him urgently in the back of the cabin.
They shudder through the aftershocks together, Dean sighing as Cas twitches and flexes around his softening dick. He mouths at Cas’s shoulder, pressing half-formed kisses to any skin he can reach. He relishes the feel of Cas’s chest expanding under him, catching his breath. Cas lets his legs slide down, making Dean slip out. Cas to hisses in discomfort. Dean kisses his collarbone in apology.
"Thanks. You want some?" Mick offers the joint.
“It would be accurate to say I am also trans,” Cas offers. His voice is steady but for some reason, his heart is racing.
Cas smiles. He only teases Dean for a minute longer before he sinks down, taking all of Dean’s cock in one move. He stays there for a moment holding Dean inside, and Dean can feel his muscles fluttering. He’s probably so sensitive it’s unbearable.
"What do you mean?"
“I would like that, I think.”
“Dean, you will behave or I won’t let cum until Friday.”
"Rain coat off," he waves at Dean. Dean compiles, handing it over for Cas to toss in the direction of his shirt and jeans, but leaves on the wet jeans to Cas's amusement.
It doesn’t last, which is a relief too. Dean pulls out and grabs a dildo from the towel he brought in earlier. It must be one of Cas’s, Dean must have gotten it from the box in Cas’s cabin while Cas waited patiently on his knees. Dean doesn’t fuck him with it, just slides it home and pulls up Cas’s underwear over it.
He doesn't answer immediately, not sure what to say. He's tired, he wants to curl up alone somewhere, but he will probably just end up sitting in the pay as you will cafe in town anyway until he can't anymore. At which point, we will wait in the park until the gas-n-sip closes and then he will sleep, and be awake again in time to open.
He sits on the edge of the tub, Cas’s hand on his knee. He gets a gets a new bandage, smoothes it down, then tapes it in place with practiced motions. Cas suppresses a shiver. Other than Mick’s hugs and holding baby Tanya, hardly anyone has touched him since Dean kicked him out. He wants more.
“Text me when Nora gets back. I’ll pick you up.” And with that, he’s gone again.
Cas whimpers and gets a hand on his dick. He rubs quick and with abandon, chasing his orgasm eagerly. This is one of the best parts of humanity Cas decided long ago, the orgasm, the moment the body breaks into mindless pleasure--pleasure so great it’s almost pain--the moment he is not himself but a bundle of sensation in someone else’s hands.
Cas can feel his high dipping after dinner but he resists taking another hit. He’s long since learned the lesson that sex while too high is always a disappointment. So he lets the high wane, idly playing with Dean’s fingers, admiring the freckles along his knuckles. He put those freckles back in place when he rebuilt Dean.
He tugs Cas a little aimlessly, no plan, just wanting him closer. Cas swings a leg over Dean’s hips and settles his weight against Dean, leaning down to kiss his neck. Dean sighs as Cas nips at skin of his neck, jumps a little when Cas bites down a little too hard.
Mick, a tiny dark haired guy across the room from Cas steps up to answer."How do you want to be nonbinary? I mean, look there's no rules, even if you were binary, you are the one who gets to decide what that means. You know, I really struggled with the idea of being a guy, of being part of a group of people who had visited so much violence upon me, sorry I know this isn't relevant to you--"
“I’m tired,” Cas finally says.
"It means I'm not an accident."
“I dunno. Claire mentioned it to me.”
"Steve, look I'm sorry but you will need to leave tomorrow." Marlene tells him once they’re sequestered in her tiny office.
“What do you mean how? It’s not that hard.”
His stomach, his belly, the organs under them. He can feel his organs working sometimes, hear them too. And certainly he hates the endless slog of it. Constantly need to feed himself only to do it again hours later, and water, and then needing pee and brush his teeth and wash his hands, and wash his body and figure out where he can do those things, when he doesn’t have a house or even a motel room to call his own.
“I can’t do that again. I can’t give you another chance like that,” he says, face crumpled.
“Yes, Dean. I will make sure to get in the habit of being nosier. I am sure it will serve me well on our next hunt.”
“Oh, well that’s good then.”
Dean's expression flickers, it's so quick Cas can't read it but he gives Dean a slow once over anyway. Dean doesn’t often indulge Cas’s flirting, which is probably a stupid move since it only makes Cas try harder.
He doesn’t complain as Cas rubs his lips against Dean’s thigh, nor when he wipes his fingers on the edge of the blanket, which makes Dean shudder in disgust.
“Wouldn’t do that either. Roads are mostly impassable that way.” It’s a tiny bit of an exaggeration. The roads are passable, but just barely.
“Mmm, Jeremy, before the command meeting,” Dean presses harder and Cas’s breath hitches. “I fucked him. Tied him to the bed and came riding his dick.”
“You’re ok. I didn’t mean to hurt you. You’re ok,” Dean says into his hair.
“I think you might be magic,” he admits. Dean makes a face.
“That’s right Dean. Fuck yourself for me. Get yourself wet and loose for me. Take your time.” Cas’s voice is steady and commanding. Dean lets his eyes slip closed as he rides the dildo.
Cas bumps their shoulders together.
“No.”
“Uh-huh,” Dean mumbles into Cas’s shoulder. Cas laughs a little at him, and wraps him up in his arms.
"It's it closed by now?" he asks.
“Easy,” Dean murmurs and tugs the panties down, finally taking the dildo in hand and fucking him properly. He’s pumping into Cas fast and brutal and Cas is near tears as Dean mercilessly fucks him towards orgasm.
“Fine then you need to tell him you really love him.”
“Hurts just right,” Dean admits, too turned onvto feel even a little embarrassed with the admission.
anyway
“I don’t want anything else from you. I am happy with this,” he makes a strange human gesture, an aborted shrug, as if to encompass the world.
“Oh fuck,” Cas sighs when Dean slides home again.
He throws off his pants, and shirt for good measure, and gets in bed on his belly, back arched invitingly for Dean.
“Please, Dean,” Cas answers, gravely and heavy with arousal.
“In me. Need you in me,” he finally says.
"Enjoying the rain," Cas answers, blowing water off his lips to answer. There's no answer and when he looks over, Dean is standing there staring at him, oversized rain jacket zipped up tight. The hood, which he’s got pulled up, makes him look like a little kid dressed by his mother. It would be more endearing if Dean weren't looking at him like he’s taken leave of his senses.
Dean wants to argue. Wants to tell Cas he’s not worth it; he’s just a worthless speck of a human to be ground down under the heel of the universe. He doesn’t deserve that kind of devotion.
“Shut up, Sammy.”
“You’re so loose,” he says, awed.
“Oh Dean,” Cas gasps. The angle isn’t as deep but he’s hitting Cas’s g-spot on every thrust. Cas can’t help the little whimpers he makes as Dean thrusts quickly. He’s so sensitive, right on the knife’s edge of another orgasm.
“I dunno man. You take spiders outside instead of killing them. You cry at poems every week. You know so much shit, I still can’t believe you’ve never been to college. You sat outside with Lenora for an hour when she got upset last week. You’re weird as fuck. You’re always at work on time. You’re kind and hardworking and you’ve got this air around you, I dunno, earnest, serious, intense, I guess. You’re Steve.”
Marlene, who looked so open and friendly this morning, is holding herself stiffly now. Standoffish Cas thinks, though he can't understand why. Maybe he offended someone? Maybe the showers. He knows his body is not like the bodies of other men, he knows that men who look like this, men like Jimmy and Dean, are not always treated well, but is he really being denied a bed for this? He doesn't dare ask.
They stay like that until Dean’s too soft and slips out. Dean slides out from behind Cas to sit against the headboard beside him. Cas stays on his back, feeling hot come leak out of him with relish.
Cas feels again like he’s back in that shower at the first shelter, caught out, exposed, nervous. Cas has learned that he moves in certain ways when he’s nervous. He shifts his weight, he might even fidget. His hands will sweat, an annoying little biological tick that sometimes is his only cue that he is nervous at all.
“Want me to do it?” Dean asks, kneeling beside Cas on the bed, fiddling with the strap on one thigh, trying to get it comfortable. He’s so tempted to slide his cock into Cas’s mouth suddenly. Cas has an unforeseen enthusiasm for oral that Dean loves to receive. Whether it’s sucking his cock or eating him out, or sometimes, eating his ass, Cas applies himself with a focused kind of hunger that never fails to leave Dean quivering. Dean’s got a couple of photos squirreled away on his phone of Cas between his thighs, lips shining, looking dazed and ruined like he’s the one who just got eaten out to an inch of his life and not Dean.
Dean just shakes his head and settles on one of the tables, feet set on the bench, legs spread wide. He's still wearing the absurd rain jacket.
Eventually, Diran calls them all to order. They sit, and go around the circle introducing themselves. There's a couple of young college students who are relaxed, comfortable in their skin. A couple of adults who say their names and pronouns with halting hesitance, a couple people who say their gender like a challenge to the world. Cas doesn't really know where he fits in.
Dean doesn’t say anything, just gently rubs the lotion in. Cas is grateful that he has the right kind laying around the cabin. The thought comes to him that maybe Dean does this with someone else, maybe he keeps this lotion around for the women he fucks while he’s studiously avoiding Cas. His eyes prickle.
“Yeah,” it’s Jack who answers, “It says that people in queerplatonic relationships can do some stuff from romantic relationships too but that they don’t really feel romantic feelings for each other.”
He wakes in the dark with Dean at his back. They aren’t quite touching but Cas can feel his warmth. The closeness makes him jittery. All the hurt from that first night wells up in his belly, a huge burning thing. Cas considers grabbing his bag and leaving the motel. He thinks about calling Mick to come pick him up and staying the night on their couch instead.
He’s never been this full, never had the occasion to be adventurous about fucking himself before now. But with Cas here, holding him, pushing the dildo further into him every once in a while, stroking his cock he feels full. Full of Cas, surrounded, possessed, safe.
So Cas waits patiently on his knees as Dean walks out of the cabin and into the evening, ready for whatever Dean gives him, even if it’s frustrated solitude.
“Fine, fine.”
Dean keeps working Cas through his orgasm then keeps sucking softly at Cas's dick after until Cas makes an uncomfortable little noise. He pulls away, draws his fingers out and kisses Cas’s heaving stomach, his sternum, his cheek, then his lips.
“You must have watched thousands of weddings, dude.”
The view isn’t great. Cas is tucked close between Dean’s thighs and it’s dark and Dean’s angle from the floor means his future self’s thighs block much of the view but he can hear the soft wet sounds of Cas’s mouth and he can hear himself moaning. He can hear Cas make a low pleased noise in the back of his throat that makes future Dean curse and makes Dean dig his fingers into his thigh. He wants to jack off.
“I’ll be right back,” Dean says quietly and takes his hand away. In his absence Cas feels cold and lonely. No doubt Dean will give Cas a towel to wipe away the mess and a glass of water and then kick him out of the cabin. Cas shivers, semen cooling on his face. His nakedness feels vulnerable, his ass is beginning to ache uncomfortably.
Dean pops back in, watching Cas struggle to tape down the bandage one handed for a moment.
Dean pauses to think about it, about all the times he’s touched Cas, reached for him, comforted him.
“You’re so hungry for it. Hungry for my cock, to take my knot like a slut,” Cas tells him. Dean grinds down on the toy nodding, breathing against Cas’s lips.
That night Dean sleeps with his hand in the middle of Cas’s back, feeling his chest expanding under Dean’s hand. Here, he thinks. He wants to be here
“That feel good, Cas? You going to come for me? C’mon Cas, come for me. Yeah, sweetheart, just like that,” he’s murmuring, because he loves Cas and he wants Cas to know that, wants Cas to come for him knowing Dean loves him, loves fucking him, loves making him come and moan and cry out for Dean.
“Hm?”
The first brush of fingers against his back makes Cas jump but he settles as Dean rubs a hand up his back, then down again. It’s rough and heavy and warm as it slides down his back to his ass. He slips his hand further down, pressing over Cas’s underwear, and Cas did put them on specifically for Dean, pressing on his dick, making Cas sigh.
More shuffling and Cas is sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning over, and Dean’s hearing got rebuilt after hell. All the years of damage from firing guns with no protection taken away and he’s almost good as new now, which means he can hear the slick sound of a kiss.
“You alright?” Dean asks, his voice low and rough.
The door opens, re-locks, someone pads across the room.
"Cool. Me too! You, uh, do you need help getting T or anything?" he asks.
"Yeah, we've had problems with them before. I'm sorry about that. I'm Marin by the way, they them pronouns."
Then, he takes the dildo and slowly presses it back into Dean.
Cas is beautiful like this, groaning and gasping in turn. Dean works him up until Cas is grinding against his face, holding his head in place, riding his face just the way Dean likes.
“Cas,” Dean of the future says. Cas pauses in the doorway, turning back.
“Dean,”
Dean moves his hand away so Cas can shove his boxers down. It’s a shame, he reflects, he didn’t even have time to put on something nice for Dean. Dean dips his fingers into Cas then brings them back to his dick, smearing wetness there, rubbing the length, teasing his frenulum, making Cas gasp with how sensitive it is.
When it finishes its quest, Dean snarls "Fucking things. Thought we got all of them.” He examines the ceiling, the eves.
Today, he has been thinking of his body. It had been a slow quiet day at work and when he could no longer focus on the package labels he’s been reading or the magazines or his phone, he had taken to examining his hands. He has a mole on one knuckle he’d never noticed before. There are scars left over from when this was still Jimmy’s body. His nails are ragged. He knew this before, from the way t hey scrape along his skin uncomfortably when he scratches an itch. He
When it's over, some people leave and some wander out to bring back takeout and others go into the back room, the room where Cas slept. Cas helps put all the chairs away, stacking them carefully with the help of Lenora, a woman with a lip piercing a streak of pink in her hair.
“Cas, Cas,” he chants instead of answering. He suddenly wishes Cas’s cock were actually like this, the kind of cock that Dean could just hold inside himself for as long as he needed, until he had his fill of Cas. A fool’s errand; he will never have enough of Cas.
“It’s me,” Dean says in a low voice against the back of Cas’s neck. Cas relaxes back into Dean.
“Dean, Dean, please,” he’s chanting like Dean’s name is a prayer, and maybe at this point it is.
Dean doesn't answer. He's frozen still as a curious hornet nudges at his nose. No one breathes as it explores Dean's face, then his jacket.
Cas doesn't really understand humans' relationship with their own nakedness. He understands the vulnerability of it. He can understand protecting the body from the sun, the cold, insects, from abrasive surfaces. But the need to hide the body from the eyes of others, the way Dean is fiercely protective of his own nakedness, that he’s never quite understood though.
“I can’t – I can’t give you what you want,” Dean admits quickly all in one breath.
Cas leans down, still cradling Dean’s face, and kisses him. The angle is bad, with Dean sitting on the bed and Cas still standing. Dean’s tugging on Cas, trying to get him down here, closer. Cas breaks away only to kneel between Dean’s knees. Dean inhales sharply, looking at Cas. Cas brushes a thumb along his cheekbone, down to press against his bottom lip. Dean exhales against Cas’s finger. Cas tilts his head to the side, gently guiding, to leave open mouthed kisses on his throat, under his ear.
"You got any family?" he asks as he sets the coffee down in front of Cas.
Sam gapes at him for a minute. Cas leaves the room only to return a moment later with an orange. He sits at the table and sets his piercing gaze on Sam.
A moment later, he hears Dean sloshing through the grass behind him.
“In that case, would you take this to the bathroom please,” he says, because he’s reasonable, and a graduate student and doesn’t have time to have sex time Dean gets a little horny.
Dean blushes, which is hilarious given Cas literally has Dean’s come leaking out of him right now.
“Let me,” Cas answers.
He pulls out a brightly colored book called
Cas gestures him over. When he’s close, Cas takes a deep hit and grabs Dean’s chin. He holds the smoke then pulls Dean close; Dean dutifully opens his mouth, letting Cas exhale the smoke into him, their lips brushing. Dean pulls back just far enough to stare into Cas’s eyes. Cas stares back greedily, admiring all over again how beautiful Dean’s eyes are.
Sam sits across from them. He’s still staring at Dean.
Dean presses close, shoving a thigh between Cas’s legs, applying teeth to the parts of Cas he can reach until Cas is groaning and grinding against him.
"Well, Steve, I've got a few things to do before we can talk but you can sit here. Feel free to watch TV or read any of the books. There are some snacks in the kitchen and I think there might be brownies from yesterday in the fridge. You're welcome to them."
A moment later, as Dean kisses over his belly, Cas hands him lube and a condom.
"Shit," they sigh, "Come on in."
Cas frowns, tilts his head in that way of his, “What do I want, Dean?”
Cas grabs his hands and pins them down by the wrist with one hand. “Hold still,” he orders and Dean, like the idiot he is, answers, “Or what?”
“Yes, he was,” Cas answers shortly.
“Um, I’m not sure I can stay hard that long,” he admits.
“Please,” Dean answers, hands on Cas’s hips, pulling him closer.
“No, he means he wants to do a wedding with the family, Cas,” Dean clarifies.
Finally, he stills and pulls out the dildo, leaving Cas shuddering.
Cas is gasping, moaning. Dean wraps his free arm around Cas’s hip and rests his free hand against Cas’s stomach, enjoying the way it flexes and tenses under Dean’s hand as Cas writhes under him.
“Fuck!” Dean groans out when Cas runs his nails down Dean’s chest again. He grabs onto the sheets and fucks up into Cas hard and fast until Cas is letting out little breathy moans. Cas braces himself against Dean’s chest and starts to fuck back on him with abandon, his thighs—fuck, his thighs, Dean wants to touch them—working as he fucks Dean hard.
“Will you shut the fuck up and let me finish? Cas and I love each other but we’re not really conventional. We don’t really do the whole romance thing. We just, we want to spend the rest of our lives together, as friends.”
“No, I mean touching. I would not mind if we touched more.”
Cas takes a long shaky inhale. He holds it, willing the tears to stop. He breathes out steadily. He takes his next hit probably too quickly.
“I almost made it to 30 without your intervention.”
” he says again, with more urgency.
He leaves again but Cas can hear him, in the bathroom, then the kitchen.
Dean reaches for the whiskey and drinks straight from the bottle. He grabs his blanket and pillow and hightails it out the front door, leaving it unlocked, praying he won't run into himself.
Cas doesn’t know how to respond to that.
“Pants off, on the bed,” Dean tells him. Cas pushes down the flicker of disappointment. He does so enjoy being on his knees.
it reads in big letters across the top. There's a rainbow underneath and then a little description reading
Dean doesn't deserve that from Cas, such searing devotion. Dean wants it like nothing else. He wants it from Cas, Cas who just short days ago looked at Dean with confused fondness after they got kicked out of a brothel, who looked at Dean with such fear at the prospect of sex with a woman. Cas who told Dean that he could send Dean back to hell if he didn't show a little respect. Here he is, on his knees for Dean. At least, this time he's not covered in blood for Dean. He's not actually sure this is any better.
“No, you’re not.”
“Nah, it’s ok. You look like you got your brains fucked out.”
Dean lets out a shuddering sigh and climbs off his chest. Cas mourns the loss of his steady weight pinning him in place. He wants nothing more than to be a helpless bird thrashing under Dean’s hand. There’s a long still moment where Cas keeps his eyes closed and Dean catches his breath. The whole time, Dean keeps a hand on Cas’s chest. Cas’s world narrows to that point of warmth.
A few miles later, on the highway, Cas says, “Dean, I must confess, if you are hoping to have sex – with me – I’ve found I don’t particularly like it. I’m sorry to disappoint.”
Cas just gives him a grin and pulls him up for a searing kiss.
“I think I understand, Dean.”
“I think you promised to fuck me,” Cas murmurs, as he leans down to kiss Dean. Dean’s hands come up to hold his hips; he slips a hand under Cas’s sweater, hand resting on Cas’s back, over the spot a wing might be if he still had wings. Cas shudders, kisses Dean harder, nipping at his lip the way he knows Dean likes.
His future self does get up, but only to go out the back door, leaving the door open. Probably to wash up with the rain bucket, Dean thinks.
“About what?” he demands, adrenalin already pumping.
IIt takes some fumbling and Cas helps guide his cock home but then he’s flush against Cas’s ass. He grabs Cas’s hand, laces their fingers together and presses lingering kisses to the back of his neck as Cas adjusts.
“I would not turn down the chance to sleep in a bed tonight, no matter how upset I might be with you.” Cas can’t see his expression in the dark but he hopes that hit landed.
"No, it's cool," Sky says, gesturing him over.
Cas thinks; he wants Dean angry maybe then he’ll
“It’s Cas,” he admits.
John 12,
He settles the crying child easy on his hip, no awkwardness in his movement.
Dean shakes his head.
“They don’t know,” he stops to bite at Cas’s collarbone, “That I had you first. That you were mine first,” he sucks a nipple into his mouth briefly, flicking his tongue over it. Cas whines at the sensation, enjoying the cool when Dean’s mouth leaves his nipple wet and hard.
In Mick’s car, after the reading, he asks to be taken to the gas-n-sip.
“Dean was just explaining to Sam that we go married,” Cas says and Dean throws him a withering look.
"I'm sorry. Things have changed. You can stay for the night but we can't offer you a bed tomorrow."
“Take it out Dean,” Cas commands. The knot pops back out making him gasp.
“Roll over,” he orders. Cas rolls onto his back, staring up at Dean through half-closed eyes. He feels like he’s high.
Sam doesn’t comment, but Dean can feel him watching. Jack doesn’t comment either but he seems to take their increased intimacy as an invitation to touch more too. When Eileen comes to visit it is somehow Jack who gives her the first hug, much to her delight and Sam’s mild dismay.
So Dean settles beside him again, presses his cock to Cas’s thigh and strokes Cas lazily as Cas works himself open. Dean loves this, breathing the same air as Cas, their foreheads pressed together, as Cas works himself open. He can feel every little hitch in Cas’s breathing, the little sounds of discomfort he makes, the minute the discomfort turns to pleasure and his stomach jumps and his eyes flutter and he moans. Cas works himself open and Dean watches, loves watching. Dean doesn’t think he’s seen anything so mesmerizing as Cas’s pleasure.
On the porch, Dean stomps mud off his boots--a nice gesture but when are his boots ever free of mud Cas wonders--then leaves them at the door, socks in a neat, if wet, pile on top.
What can Cas say? 'I caused my whole family to fall from heaven and my only human friends turned me out for no reason I can understand.' 'I am afraid and hungry and I do not understand this world, nor how to navigate it.'
Dean takes him by the hips, guiding Cas’s movements. Cas gets hard against Dean, swollen and wet and eager for Dean to be inside him. He keeps going, Dean’s skin getting wet from Cas’s arousal. Dean puts up with it until finally he loses patience and pulls Cas close with hands on his ass.
“Sam, he knows how much I love him. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I would not mind if we spent more time together, physically,” Cas admits after a pause.
Cas doesn’t mind the smell of rain but he won’t deny the pleasure of warm water after the chill of rain.
“What’s that?” Jack asks, now seated beside Cas at the table. Dean wanders over to them, putting a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
“Missed you today,” he says into Cas’s neck, beard scrubbing at the tender skin there.
Dean gives a stifled sigh, “I’ll review the reports tomorrow morning. As a precaution, we’ll go west instead.”
He teases Cas, lapping at his cock, getting him wet, listening to Cas sigh and feeling him wriggle with impatience. He licks over Cas’s lips, teases his cock but then Cas grips his hair and says, “You promised me a blowjob.”
“I think they called it spam stir fry,” Dean says doubtfully, flopping next to Cas on the bed. “There’s rice,” he adds helpfully, as if that makes it better. Cas takes the plate when it’s handed to him and eats without really tasting anything. Thank you weed for making most of camp Chitaqua’s terrible meals taste like nothing at all.
“Yeah, yeah, Cas it’s good.”
So Dean breathes nice and even and watches Cas with his brow furrowed as he reads about early Christian heresies with Dean’s cock in him. He feels a little absurd, but mostly he feels filled up with purpose. He’s being
"Hey, hey Steve." He comes awake as if swimming up towards consciousness through soup.
He calls Mick.
“Touch yourself,” Cas commands and Dean does.
“You close?” Dean asks, not slowing a bit.
“On your knees,” he orders, taking a step back. Cas goes easily, knees hitting the dusty floor hard. Dean slips a thumb into Cas’s gasping mouth. Cas closes his lips around the digit and swirls his tongue, giving Dean a little preview. He’s become an expert at sucking dick these last few years, which Dean has reaped the benefits of many a time. Dean shivers as Cas works his finger. He’s expecting the order to open Dean’s pants and get to work, but it doesn’t come. Instead, Dean pulls his finger out and orders, “Stay there.”
“I will,” he promises.
“Dean,” Cas breathes, when Dean pulls his fingers back.
Cas nods, giving a choked sound of affirmation and Dean keeps going. His arm is probably getting tired, Cas thinks, but it doesn’t really matter as Cas starts to feel good again. There’s a kind of overwhelmed pleasure Cas’s human body is capable of, an advantage when he has so many orgies, but it’s also terribly raw and vulnerable. That’s where Dean is pushing him now. Cas keeps stroking himself with shaking hands, groaning with every breath. This orgasm is different. He feels it in his feet and the legs and spine and chest. Like every string in his body has been cut, it makes him feel a little hysterical, a little like he’s been reborn as liquid pleasure. He being burned up from the inside by Dean, cracked open and made into a simple creature, just a shuddering body, a vessel full of pleasure and for a moment, maybe love. Maybe Dean’s love.
"Yeah, I think I do."
After that he wanders, looking at the titles. There's a small collection of poems: Whitman, Corral, Vuong, Waites, Sappho, Lorde, Hughs. There were children's books, fiction books, romance novels with well muscled young men in cowboy hats and assless chaps on the cover. There’s even a section on spirituality and religion with titles like
Cas is too tired to parse what Dean means by that. He lets himself be held.
The next morning Diran shows him a cabinet full of brightly colored pre-packaged cups of cereal. He picks out a little cup of fruitloops. He eats in silence, watching Diran brew coffee for them both.
“What? Sam, he already knows that.”
He pushes up Cas’s shirt, kisses him there, on his solar plexus.
They chat. Cas asks after Diran's kids, all well, the youngest has fallen in love with a kid's movie called Frozen. They talk about Nora and Cas's struggles with work, the way he's going around the store reading all the packages to understand what they are really selling. For some reason this makes Diran laugh.
