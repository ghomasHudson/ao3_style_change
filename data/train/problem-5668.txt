"Well, then Sif is added to the mix, and she can outdrink them all," Thor shrugged, looking around. "What are you looking for here?"
“And a while ago, you said
Steve let out a long breath, pressed against Tony even though Tony was still on top of the sheets. “The future has some incredible benefits.”
Tony entered, and stopped, having come to check on the popcorn and decided that going back to staring at Steve’s gleaming blond hair in the changing light of the film was preferable to watching an international spy and assassin have a breakdown in his kitchen. He waved to Natasha and retreated quickly, Thor already enthralled with the actors on the screen.
Tony flicked the phone app open as soon as it started ringing, not even paying attention to it until a voice started talking without any pleasantries or greeting. "Tony, as much as I deeply appreciate the thought behind Christmas gifts, please come re-take the ones you sent me,” Charles said.
Tony meets his gaze, careful not to allow the spark of hope slowly reigniting inside of him get the best of him, and replies: “well, breaking off my bonding contract usually means I disobey one of its conditions. In other words, yes, I am offering you to have sex with me.”
"Remember my overbearing father?" he supplies, "that bastard got me hooked, line, and sinker into a bond with an alpha I absolutely detest and cannot stand."
Tony feels a rush of hot anger at that, a quick rise of irritation not aimed at the Alpha but intended for himself. He was discovered too easily. Tony forgets how capable Steve's observant nature is. It provokes Tony into standing, all thoughts of the slick sticking to his pants holding no leeway over his drive to prove the Alpha wrong.
his big, strong alpha.
public transit—the cramped space within the cab overflowing with a miasma of scents of all who came before them. It’s not pleasant. In fact, it makes Tony nauseous, his nose stinging, not used to the free flow of mixed scents within a small, enclosed space.
Cheeks flushing hotly, he looks away. Then pictures Steve posing heroically on a rock with the angry crashing of waves behind him, adorned in nothing but a green leaf covering his groin; his muscles glistening in the sun beating down on him—no clothes to be seen.
. Low and firm, a deep timbre that races up his spine; yet somehow it settles glaringly loud in Tony’s ears, only quieting when he sits his ass back down. Huh.
he has Steve's attention, the alpha crossing his arms, leaning further back into his seat. “And how am I in this reality of yours?”
in the alpha's voice—the sheer want heard in the rasp of it—it makes Tony clench even tighter around him, his arousal burning hotter.
"You're just helping a fellow O’ out with a problem,” Tony looks away and finishes with: "we can go our separate ways after the deed is done. We never have to tell a soul; as simple as that.”
"What's so special about getting fucked for the first time?" He raises a brow.
How’s that for being a first-timer at smut? ;) And I thought the first chapter was long. LOL. I am going to be completely honest with you guys, I did NOT expect this fic to get the response it did. You guys literally surprised the hell out of me with the amount of kudos and comments I've received. Thank you so much for wanting to read this! ;;-;; I might be making this longer than I anticipated, but who's really complaining?
spend tonight being a Debby Downer. Not when he is finally ripping the reins away from Howard and taking back control over his life.
things that have no business conjuring images up in his mind's eye, but do nonetheless when he side-eyes Steve.
He has this vague sense that something else is supposed to happen, but it's too far away to grasp onto. He is dimly aware of words being whispered into his ear, but the only words he can make out are:
He inhales a surprised breath when Steve pushes his coat off his shoulders, the jacket sliding to the floor, briefly thinking
A group of obnoxiously loud people walk by, unaware of the air becoming charged between them, so tense that Tony has to hold his breath, watching the way the alpha's eyes darken. Steve’s throat bobs in a hard swallow.
Steve unwraps his arms from Tony and sits up, a part of Tony deflates from the loss of warmth. "Tony," he begins, clearly about to embark on a long speech but Tony sits up with him.
He peers up at him.
Tony gives himself a little nod, and then turns to face Steve. “I need you to have sex with me.”
“Besides the point. You were
demanding back the release that has been cruelly ripped away from him
fine.
The alpha
Tony peers around and notices he is alone, no one else within sight except for a couple walking arm in arm across the street, and a group of people heading further down. They are too far away to recognize him. It offers him enough time to shake the jitters loose. Not that he is nervous—okay, maybe just a little. A microscopic amount. Tinier than an atom. An atom that somehow holds the size of the universe—and fitting several other miniature universes within it's pockets.
"Yes," Tony blurts without thought, his ardent need to fill the silence intense. "No. Maybe."
does. Probably won’t forget it anytime soon, honestly. Steve did everything possible to relax him and chase away Tony's nerves, made him comfortable up to the point Tony's apprehension completely melted away, overtaken by the Haze, giving Steve the perfect window of opportunity to do as he pleases. And yet, the man made no attempts to take what was practically offered up to him on a silver platter.
“We can take it slow. There's no need to rush,” Tony's hand looks almost fragile within Steve’s hold. "We have all night."
"You should go in alone."
Tony just hopes the driver doesn't recognize him.
Tony can wield the finest silver tongue when the mood strikes him, but right now? He feels the need to be blunt and honest, something inside him demanding it.
He whines in protest but Steve only shushes him and pulls him up for a kiss, then rolls them over until Tony is covered by his mass. He feels incredibly small beneath Steve’s huge frame.
, and proceed to throw back their whiskey.
In his peripheral, Steve shakes his coat off then folds it neatly over a chair by the desk. He feels the alpha's eyes on him, a feeling of innate awareness tipping him off. “You okay there?”
Tony watches the movement of Steve’s adam’s apple and decides enough is enough. It’s either now or never, and Tony prefers
The Alpha bends down, his face inches away, the alluring scent of him filling Tony's lungs. Not aware of it, Tony’s mouth parts, expectant, heady with the scent of Alpha, observing the lowering of Steve's lashes.
Steve hums, waiting for his response, but Tony can’t focus beyond the tantalizing fingers dipping beneath his briefs, slowly inching past the rubber band.
And just like that, it hits the nail on Tony's coffin, implements into his head that
hates that. Immediately, his thoughts take an abrupt turn and all he can think of is that he might have made a mistake, that this whole plan of his is just plain idiocy, and by him actually propositioning someone and getting rejected reaffirms that notion.
"I should start a betting pool," Clint mused, watching him. "Do you need any help there?"
"It's not a plot. It's concern. Your AI is so advanced he feels concern. So we make sure that we both know what there might be to be concerned about so we can head it off," Pepper explained, sounding like she'd done so before.
"You were alone on their Migardian holiday then, weren't you?" Thor asked, still not releasing him.
"What do you mean beyond that?" Tony asked, stilling.
"It was one of our travels to another realm.  Thor was challenged to a feat of strength, which required him to lift a cat.  All he was able to lift was a single paw because the jotunn who offered the challenge had enchanted the Midgard serpent to look like the feline."  Loki's lips curled upward, "I'm certain you have that one in your mythology texts."
"I think a lot of people want to throw Logan through a few trees," Clint shrugged. "He blew smoke into my face the first time we met and I hit him in the ass with a trick arrow. I can't tell if we get along or not."
Bruce moved over next to him, looking at the books, one in particular catching his eye for Thor, "I like it.  There's still so much about it we don't understand and can't explain.  But we try."
A-A-A-A
"What happened with Stane and what does it have to do with the terrorists?  There were a lot of things mentioned on Christmas, but I can't find the threads to connect them."
"We've been grating on each other’s nerves from as soon as we met," Steve answered.  "I think this is worth working through those fights, but I also can't see the future.  From where I'm standing now?  I'll say again, you're stuck with me."
Tony opened his mouth, closed it again and then laughed. "Oh my god. No, do you know how many villains I've had drinks with?"
Loki narrowed his eyes at him before he shook his head, laughing. “You cannot change the whole world to suit your moods.”
Deciding to avoid the jab about him being asleep for so long, Tony shrugged. "Not big on trees in the army then?"
"Yeah," Clint said, voice low.
Bruce paused, reaching out to cup Clint's cheek for the briefest moment. "Alright. You know how to find me if you need me."
Clint frowned, leaning further into the couch. "So how's the pack, I'm sorry, the students," Tony said instead.
"I was thinking maybe for Bruce."
She grinned in response, "Oh you did didn't you? Whoops. Oh well, it's still locked up tight."
“That wasn’t what I meant,” Thor said, arms still crossed and standing over the bed.
Loki took an equal step away from Thor, "Until they can make a cell to hold me.  I'll not spend my days trapped."
reasons."
That garnered a laugh, "Of course they did. However did you all manage a holiday with gifts and decorations?"
"He used to be," Tony sighed. "He cheated rather severely a couple years ago, not only cheating death itself but de-aging himself along the way." Clint nodded, realizing now why the man's movements seemed so off.
Steve shivered at that touch, mouthing at Tony's jaw, "Then you're obviously not seeing what I am."
“Sortta look like one,” Tony said, finally finding his words. His fingers twitched in an aborted motion. When he realized what he said he bit his lip hard.
"Sure," Tony said, shrugging and suddenly uncomfortable.
"Sure," Clint said, grin still not easy but brighter than it had been.
Clint paused. "I always thought whale sharks looks cool."'
Pepper blinked at him at that question, "Where did that come from? I thought we are?"
Tony took another step back and then forced himself to stand his ground. "That's not my problem."
“I do not like being without you,” Thor said. “I would rather not face another year without you by my side. But nor do you get to command who I give my heart too. Can you not accept it has room for two people?”
Tony's fingers stopped. "Well, I've grown up," he tried instead.
Clint blinked and then rolled with the subject change. "Oh, we both slept with our superiors and on both counts it was a stupid move," he said, and braced his elbows on his knees. "But—but it was different. Because ... because you're fine with things, aren't you? You and Fury and sometimes you sleep together and you can be angry and do it again but in the end it doesn't matter how fucked up you are."
"Maybe it's not a bad thing.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe we will keep in touch if we're just friends," Betty offered.
"Doesn't that go under garlands and ornaments?" Tony asked and almost missed Thor's tiny wince.
"If you need it, the other guy pretty much never has metal on him," Bruce said, casually, except for how tense he was holding himself.
Tony pushed himself up on his elbows. “What? Why?”
"No, no disasters."  He took a couple of steps further into the room, "Actually, I was kind of hoping to talk about Christmas?"
That earned a ghost of a smile from Bruce, "Something like that, yes."
"Indeed," Jarvis said dryly.
He'd already made the clerk pick out the ruby and silver flowered ring he'd spotted, the box sitting at his elbow before Natasha arrived, but he was having trouble figuring out which particular pair of earrings looked the most like Pepper's necklace.
Thor let out an angry and frustrated breath. "You escaped last time, seeming with little issue."
“What I assume is the usual way and buying things,” Tony said. “Except Thor. I don’t know if he actually bought any of the gifts in Asgard, but he came prepared.”
Clint managed to wait until he was sure Bruce was gone before tearing down the emergency staircase Tony had built into the back of all the rooms. "Nat!" he said, barreling into the room. His hands were shaking again but for a different reason.
“Yes, yes,” Loki said.
Tony hesitated before rolling over, burying his face into Steve’s back. Steve started to shift to turn over, but settled back against the mattress, giving Tony that concealment. For several minutes Tony just breathed, considering if he was really going to say what he was about to. “Obadiah used to call me pretty,” Tony said, shuffling his nose against Steve’s shoulder blade. “Usually when he wanted something.”
"Betty, I can't offer you a normal life.  I can't offer you even a safe place to finish your research.  I'm wrapped up in this life and the Avengers."
Fury's face was impassive as he held a check out. "There wasn't anyone else to really give this to," he said and Clint froze.
"And try to get some sleep tonight too," Natasha agreed, unfolding smoothly from her seat.
"Yes," Thor nodded. "I like the lights you string up," he said, tilting his head back. "And snow feels different here."
Bruce stilled at that, looking over at Clint in mild surprise, "Thanks."
"I know he's your brother, but I can't help but be confused by not trying to at least have him finish the terms of his current punishment," Jane murmured and then paused, "What were those terms again?"
"What is this Christmas?" Thor asked, coming up behind Steve's shoulder.
Clint stopped, staring. “What?” he yelped and Tony just shrugged.
“Only some of them,” Tony said, and finally took the doughnuts into the kitchen, where Nick Fury was standing with Natasha, seeming to have a staring contest of some sort. “Am I interrupting anything? Because please let me be, that would be great.”
Bruce blinked. “Okay that sounds less terrible than it could.”
"Yeah, seriously, don't," Clint said, climbing up on one of Tony's chairs to string a light over the fireplace. "Good Christmases are few and far in between and if you jinx this one, I will personally have to shoot you."
"I didn't keep it, Mom did. So...well, I suppose that means that I do have it now doesn't it?" she sighed. "It was adorable, though. I couldn't
"I don't know, sometimes a person just wants a hug and to be told things get better," Clint shrugged. "Even if it is meaningless, but no, I don't really want that."
"I sortta expected them to at least throw champagne bottles at us if that’s the case," Tony said.
"Well, when Jane was here, Thor had that look in his eye like he really wanted to give that children making thing a go," Tony said, voice light. "Wasn't he supposed to be like deity of fertility?"
"I think we're more likely to find what we need at a lumber yard than at an actual store," Bruce answered, setting the books down on the counter and paying for them, accepting the bag from the cashier.
"If you even think about saying thank you, the offer is rescinded," Tony ground out. "Just go take a shower."
"You're sure about this?" Steve sat down at the table again.
For a moment Thor didn't reply, looking around the streets around them. "It is like a legend that would be a dream to you people. We use magic instead of science but it is the same thing. There's more... pomp in the capital, but vast places of ice and darkness too. There is war and there is also hope. I don't know... I wouldn't know where to begin to explain it."
"Apparently Natasha complained to him about a lack of hot water.  His solution was to offer me his shower until he can remodel my floor again.  Any insights or suggestions?"
"I've managed to shoot you before," Clint said, one eyebrow and the corner of his mouth twitching up sardonically, and people were starting to turn and stare at them. "I'm full of surprises."
"And what is that?" Tony asked, wishing he hadn't taken the sunglasses off when they got home.
Turning to look at the boxes again Clint bit back any response he wanted to give. "Sure, if you feel like giving it."
"You haven't had any luck trying to find him?" Jane glanced up at him again, before turning her gaze back to watching where her feet were landing.
For a moment, that’s all it was. Their mouths pressed together in the faint light, neither moving more than that. Then Loki caught up with what was happening, wrapping his hands in Thor’s hair and holding on, Thor’s hands carefully holding his waist.
"What did he miss in the last decades?" Thor asked, looking from Tony to Steve and seeing the unhappy set in both of their expressions. "It is unfair if they are hurting each other only by their own accidents."
"How did all of you manage to forget a holiday at once?" Fury asked, eyebrow raised. "There are six of you plus Jarvis living in that tower."
Bruce carefully set out the ornaments as he unpacked each box, "Where did you get all of these?"
new territory for me okay.”
"But you did give it an AI, didn't you?" Natasha guessed as the new set seemed to perk up at the appearance of its predecessor.
Frowning, Tony looked between him and the glass. "All the good?" he asked, head lolling back on his shoulders as he considered the soldier.
Thor nodded, holding the door open. "So what are you thinking for Anthony and Clint?"
"So we just picked up a stray?" Tony asked, arching a brow and for a second Jarvis' panel flickered like he was laughing.
Bruce settled in one of the chairs slightly to the side of where the TV was, Steve sinking down on the floor in front of one end of the couch.  Natasha hesitated before sitting down on the couch, crossing her legs and watching the others silently for a moment, “Does anyone want me to see about getting popcorn?”
Loki arched an eyebrow at that, "I'm very certain sure that's actually any of your business."
Steve considered a rack of origami books and picked one up for Bruce before following Clint toward the puzzles, "I can't believe we all forgot about this."
“He seems a bit cheerier than he has been,” Tony said. They both continued to look at where he had disappeared into the kitchen for several moments.
“I am sort of implying that request, yeah,” Steve said.
Thor frowned, approaching the kitten carefully, like he expected it to be something else, before he reached a hand out, lifting the kitten’s paw with one of his large fingers. The kitten mewed at him and after a moment he grinned, lifting the entire kitten up. "Ah, good!" he boomed, the kitten rubbing his head along Thor's beard. "It shall grow up to become a mighty warrior!"
Tony muttered something that sounded dark at the cup as Clint blinked at him and over to Steve. "You missed that didn’t you?" he asked, glancing at Bruce as well.
?" Steve turned to Tony, looking at him in shock.
Steve's lips curved upward, "I don't know, I kind of enjoyed the fight for food."
Tony had ended up sprawled out on his back on the plush carpet between the couch and the chairs, wedged almost under the table and a bottle of scotch nearby. "Bruce!" he hollered, pleasantly. "Join us in celebration! Or mourning. It might actually be mourning. But you're welcome to join us."
"Yeah," he said, clearing his throat. "So what sort of frame are you getting Tony? It's gotta be sleek, you know?"
Tony just groaned.
"I'm not actually sure," Steve admitted, pushing back the blankets and starting to find his clothes.  "It wasn't happy, but I'm not sure how angry it was."
"I make plans," he said and paused. "At least I've made them in the past. They never really worked out for me or anyone around me. It's better to just not have them in the picture."
"Yeah, well, he figures anywhere is a place he can drop in on," Clint shrugged. "The worst thing is how right he is."
“Sure, sure,” Tony said, flailing an arm out and eventually getting the strawberries onto one of the nightstands before he settled down in the circle of Steve’s arm. “Was it that?” he asked, voice low again.
Bruce shook his head and turned to look over the city, "How do you think he's doing?"
"On and off," Tony said. "Before Christmas." He did not admit it had started the night Steve had found the kitten.
"I said Tony has been having drinks with Loki," Bruce replied, his tone far too even.
to be fucking kidding me," Clint said, posture rigid from where he was looking at Tony over Loki's shoulder from where he had coming in after watching from the street until he finally placed the sharp but blurred features and it felt like a punch to the stomach.
Bruce's eyebrows rose sharply and he turned away to hide what amusement he felt at that.  Steve paused, blinking for a long moment before he nodded his agreement with Thor.
"Sure," Rhodey shrugged. "Tony has a habit of walking feet first off the high places and only wondering if he has a plan halfway down. There are a thousand little events I could tell you about, dragging him out of clubs black out drunk, or mocking enemies who could smear him on the pavement. But I've told you enough, I think." His eyes were still hard. "And I swear to god, Captain America or no, I'm only telling you these things because you asked, because I saw the way he looked at you, and because he'd never answer himself and I really think you do care. But if you fuck this up? I don't care about your perfect smile or the fact I had a poster of you when I was a kid—I will find a way to break your teeth out of that mouth."
"Do you want it enough to try?  To ask?"
a second one it's probably going to be moderately cognizant too."
“I don’t think I would ever consider you a side bit,” Thor said after a beat.
"Technically you still could in that case," Bruce said, considering him.
“A few.” He paused, focusing his gaze on his plate, "Betty, I don't, I don't know if this is working."
Jane nodded very slightly, shifting the subject away again toward the breakthroughs in a few of the fields she kept up on—including research being done by Betty Ross which was admittedly out of her normal purview.  She kept up a steady stream of conversation as they continued their stroll through Manhattan's streets. Thor tried to focus all his attention on her, truly fascinated by the science and what she offered to explain to him, but he still could not shake the feeling that Loki had been standing there, watching them, even after they returned to Stark Tower.
"How is he?" Thor asked, crossing his arms and looking down and Tony blinked.
Steve finally managed to get the water shut off and the towel tied around his waist, "It's your bathroom. I just, I thought you'd be out longer."
“They live here,” Tony cut in. “On their own floors. You have one too, I’ll show you around later. But I think Clint has his little heart set on Star Wars first.”
“Eh, brilliant is usually good,” Tony said.
“On a scale of anger, just about where are you?” Tony asked, hands on his hips. “Because I really can’t tell.”
A-A-A-A
"Yes," Bruce agreed simply, flipping the pancakes.
"I don't," he paused.  "Three or four months."
"Fuck," Tony informed the room at large on his way out.
"And god knows you're the least open book to walk around," Clint added and ignored the look Tony gave him through the shades. "What? You are. You don't like talking about yourself, I get it, but Fury—for some reason—gave Steve your redacted file. The one without Afghanistan or the arc reactor, er," and he paused for a second at Tony's look. "Poisoning incident."
"That was way too much trouble," Clint muttered.
Bruce tilted his head back to look up at the sky.  Fewer stars were visible than in other places he'd been, but he could still make out Polaris, "Are you alright?"
Bruce's gaze moved to the ties, "They sent you Agent Coulson's effects."  It wasn't a question, though perhaps it ought to have been.
"Hey, can't I just be glad you made up?" Clint asked.
"I would say that, yes, Steve likes food," Natasha said, having watched Tony consider and discard many things already and knowing they'd been through pretty much every other department.
“What would they need privacy for?” Tony asked but shut the cupboard anyway.
like you?”
Pepper pointed at a particular oak flooring, "What about this for the central room?  I'd actually carpet the bedroom though I think."
"Better paranoid than dead," she replied automatically as she folded herself back into the comfortable leather couch that Tony had furnished her with, looking for all the world as though she'd never moved.  "What happened?"
"One tale gives him a daughter.  And yes, I believe we could, but I do not know what that would look like or entail," Loki's tone was neutral, leaning toward dismissive of the thought.
"I got one of those originally," Tony sighed. "I'll work on the tinkering thing."
Steve glanced at him, "We just have to be careful not to hang anything too heavy on the garlands or it might pull them out.  We can hang ornaments from them, though, and it will help hide them a bit more."
“No,” Thor said. “And yet I expect you to try.”
"I'm not actually sure that Tony has full control of the personality traits his AI's take on," Bruce admitted.  "Not that that's reassuring, but it might at least mean he didn't program it to fight off anyone who comes near it with a fondue fork."
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're not getting out of it later," Steve warned, but obligingly slid their mouths together so neither could say anything further. Tony hummed, tilting his entire body up to get closer.
"For you?" Thor said. "I thought you would hope I would always be a fool."
The scientist nodded slightly, changing the subject, "When did you figure out you were a cat person?"
"That's what worries me," he managed. "That I might just be too tired."
“You brought my apology strawberries,” Steve pointed out, though he hadn’t touched them yet.
"The world hurts too," Clint said. "It's not really something you can run from."
Steve tried not to look too pointedly at the still unwrapped present on Tony's knee, even as he too avoided the one from Tony for last.  Natasha, meanwhile had been making use of one of the knives from Thor to systematically slit the paper from the other gifts, lips curling up at the wood puzzle Clint got her.  She set it down to reach up and pat his knee in silent thanks.
Natasha sighed and shook her head at Steve before following Tony.  Steve paused long enough to gather half of what remained, glancing at Thor, "I really need to not open my mouth, huh?"
"Well, those bottles may show up later," Steve responded with a grin, bracing his hands on the counter on either side of Tony's hips.
Steve's eyes followed the stretch, taking in every line of the other man's body, "Not even a hint?"
"My mansion is not moldy," Charles replied with a long-suffering look.  "And it's been remodeled so many times I'm not certain it even has a specific design anymore."
"I'm not quite sure yet," Bruce replied.  "Perhaps we'll look for the Yule log and see if we come across something."  He turned back toward the front of the store, pausing when he saw a history of weaponry and considered it for a long moment before picking it up.
"He also mentioned ulcers,” Steve said, nuzzling down into the skin of Tony’s neck, like he couldn’t stand another second without doing it. Tony’s hands flexed before he lifted them, tangling his fingers in Steve’s hair. “Though I think I'm physically incapable of getting those."
"He's only putting off the inevitable.  Says he thinks I should be using my time for redemption, and that this constant chase is tiring him."  Loki shook his head, murmuring thanks to the person who set down the second martini.  He pulled out the olive and passed it to Tony.
“You are here, are you not?” Thor asked, walking away again, Mjölnir slung over one shoulder. “Do you need any help with your injuries, or only the silence and peace to heal them?”
"Or I just get gift cards," Tony said, feeling more exhausted than he had any right to.
That earned the faintest ghost of a smile, "I'm sorry for your loss. Death is never easy to handle." He paused, "If there's anything you need..."
"She was involved on that one?"  Bruce's brown eyes moved to look at Clint again, hesitance in his expression.
Natasha's lips curled up amusedly, "You have got to stop giving your things AI."
Rhodey sat down, almost on top of Tony, to open the remote controlled airplane. He gave Tony a distinctly unimpressed look. "You said I owed you a plane, honey bear," Tony said.
"No higher brain function," Charles reminded.  "Hadn't ever been."
"There's really not," he agreed. "But... I think it was time to say it none the less."
Clint barely glanced over at her from beneath the sunglasses, snorting as Loki glanced toward him. His hands curled into fists and he tried to remember every calming thing Phil had ever tried to tell him. It only made him angrier.
“I don’t love you like a brother,” Loki snarled, all at once, like he had been holding it in a long time and that time Thor could not contain himself as he rolled his eyes. “That is not,” Loki started to protest, hands clenching at his sides but then Thor leaned down, slamming their mouths together.
Loki, his appearance distorted to look similar to the businessmen on the street, looked at the latest headlines and dates on the paper he had picked up. Stiffening on the roof Clint’s eyes finally found the businessman that caused the ache to swell. He had to be certain before firing.
"I came here to rest, why would I be an aggressor in that situation?"  He finally dropped his hand away from Thor's chest, letting it hang by his side.
He glanced at his watch and grabbed his cane, "I would like that tour.  I've got an hour and a half before I need to leave.  We're decorating this evening."
Tony double taked and stared up at him. "I got sold out," he managed, not mentioning Obadiah. "I woke up hooked to a car battery and told to make them weapons. Made the suit and broke out instead."
"You can't be—" Steve broke off, considering what he'd seen of Tony's reaction to Howard and he sighed, "Maybe I should."
Steve's eyes narrowed at that, "We were at war, Tony."
"Sorry, that came out of nowhere, didn't it," he offered Thor a sheepish glance.  "I've just been curious.  It's obviously different than here, but what's it like?"
"I'm still figuring out how destroying a few pieces of glass and plastic got a lid there in the first place," Fury said, watching her carefully but keeping the tone as light as he could.
“You’re saying the Other Guy has an attachment to you,” Bruce said.
"It's not," Thor started and shrugged. "Things are different now, but he is still my brother. I just wish I could find him again."
Bruce nodded, but glanced at Clint for confirmation, "I think so."
Bruce came to a stop in front of the shelf holding books on the Brooklyn Dodgers, frowning slightly at them, "It's hard enough shopping for people when you know them.  Last minute gifts have always been difficult," he picked up one of the books, opening the front cover to skim the information about it and then checking on the short author's biography before deciding that it would do.
Steve rocked back on his heels, keeping his gaze focused on Tony even as he really regretted opening his mouth in the first place.  He hadn't even been thinking about the weapons when he'd mentioned Howard playing fast and loose with the rules—the testing and design of those had all been sanctioned, "So they're not the best weapons in the world, they're still there and they're still killing."  He needed to stop, long since.
Steve looked at the door for a long moment, "Who was Coulson to him?"
“That is rather tragic," Thor said, entirely meaning it. He crossed his arms, considering the streets around them, enjoying the sight of the lights around them, though he sighed when he realized he was still looking around every corner as if Loki would be there.
"More surveillance than there is here," she replied.  "I've quite a comfortable apartment.  And the team seems to be working together better by the day."
Charles looked toward him, smiling cordially, "I think the other part of that agreement entailed your AIs never coming anywhere near my mansion."
LOTS OF LOVE FOR YOU GUYS <3<3<3
But hidden away from the rest of the world, it is too easy to believe otherwise.
If you liked it, please don't forget to kudos and comment! I would very much love to hear your thoughts! ^-^ Knowing how you feel and what you think makes me want to update faster! Much love and thank you for reading!
He stares at him, swallowing thickly, marveling at how stunning the Alpha is. He remembers Adonis then, the epitome of youthful beauty, a favourite of Aphrodite and Persephone—a most fitting description for Steve. Steve's fingers dance along Tony’s thigh, tiny touches of finger-tips that draw further inward, almost tickling—except he isn’t laughing. He’s holding his breath, waiting for something he doesn’t quite understand, only that he craves more.
Steve's hair is more golden than the pale illusion it gave off in the bar, rich and bright like the sun. A brilliant star attracting effortlessly in a way that is also endearing as well, a notable softness in Steve’s face that Tony doesn’t discern until the moment Steve laughs at something the driver says.
“Wait,” he says—no,
to. Not fucked, but
Enjoy! ^-^
Steve hums in response.
Steve said. Made
A lone, queen-sized bed sits along the wall beneath a painting of sunflowers, the painting itself complimenting the gold duvet covering the bed, alluring in a way that surpasses sleeping comfort and traverses into territory untouched.
He barely registers his fingers closing around the base of Steve's shaft—his movement fast and quick—then the impulsive swipe of his tongue tasting him. There is a burst of salt and citrus in his mouth, a spike of Alpha scent rising to his nose, the glands embedded into Steve's thighs heavy with his musk. The Alpha tenses, his cock jumping in his grasp from the sudden stimulation. "God, Tony," moans Steve.
Tony waits, his heart beating fast.
It’s everything—this sensation. Too much and not enough all at once, crashing into him and around him, stealing the air from his lungs in its ruthless attack. It stokes the hunger inside him, brewing fierce and wicked and hot; assaulting all of his senses and drawing tears in Tony’s eyes.
He must have said something flattering, noting the pleased look on Steve's face when he glances up at him, something akin to pride gathering in Steve's playful gaze.
Then suddenly the characters Jenny and Bradley are being replaced with Tony, the Alpha from the books soon wearing Steve's face.
Tony feels incredibly full, his body trembling from the sensation—but he knows innately it's not enough.
Tony ends up retorting anyway and finds out—regrettably—Steve has a fiancé at home who isn’t speaking to him at the moment. They recently broke off their engagement for reasons Steve won’t disclose, and that he is currently couch-surfing at his best friend’s place.
No matter—Tony is
carefully thought out plan. Not like he stormed out of Stark Industries and left a red-faced Howard behind, demanding
But Tony can't find it in himself to care because he is
P.S. Don't mind me. This was actually my excuse to write some abo smut. Idk how that is looking now, but It's also the first time I am actually putting the E in explicit into any type of story I've written, hohoh. Also, I've never actually written smut before so this will either be a make-it-or-break-it moment.
Steve looks on the verge of reprimanding that, he halts though, resigned in a way that gives the impression he is already familiar with a head-strong, stubbornness; and sighs, looking to the entrance of the building. "I have no qualms about anyone stealing you. In fact, they should fear it instead."
Steve pointedly looks around, "there's barely enough people around to know who you are."
beneath his breath and begins to gently thrust his finger in and out.
“Why didn't you fuck me?” the words fly from his mouth without technique.
Steve's pupils are blown wide, watching Tony like he is prey, Steve's aroma of lulling arousal filtering into Tony's lungs. Something in his brain reacts, makes Tony's last hold on his sanity go cloudy. Then he swallows down around him, submitting to the Alpha's pleasure, his mouth stretching wide around the blunt tip as he guides him in.
A love motel. Or a Heat motel, if you will.
Steve’s fingers feeling so good and so wonderful and—what?
At first it almost seemed like the Alpha was shocked, which is—well okay. It’s a perfectly normal response, right? Considering he is some random ass stranger. But don’t strangers approach each other with the intentions of sex at bars? He’s heard of this plenty of times. So why is it such a surprise?
Not long after that Steve adds another finger, a second pushing thickly into him and stretching him further. "That's it, sweetheart." Steve's breath fans hot along his neck, teasing Tony's flaming gland with his proximity. "There you go."
There is a spark of answering heat; the trace of an earlier desire filling the azure of Steve's gaze. Tony wants to continue staring at him, he really does, the man as transfixing as the various complicating parts he used to make his not-so-very-smart-AI-but-also-very-smart-AI, Dum-E. But it’s intimidating. So he drops his stare to the coffee table.
He leaves his melancholy thoughts behind him at the traffic-lights, before the scent of it can intensify and rat him out.
Steve chokes on his drink and Tony mutters
He looks up at Steve, the Alpha appearing absentminded as if he too, is lost in thought.
the Alpha praised, which makes him shiver all over; pulling a lewd moan from him, the sound vibrating around Steve's cock. The Alpha whimpers, his knot thickening, the sweat gathering on his brow. Tony's slick gushes quicker from the sight, almost coating his thighs. He doesn’t know how long it lasts for—the sounds leaving Steve’s lips being the only thing that matters, the only concept of time known to him in this moment—then Steve is gently pushing him off, his cock still hard in Tony's grip.
his First Time he’s proffering; it might as well be with someone memorable.
But it’s the image of his mother’s disappointment that has him wavering.
Tony marches over to Steve's side of the bed and snatches the remote from his hand.
"Such a gentleman," Tony croons teasingly, a bit uncertain but he is quick to mask it, and takes Steve's offered hand.
The room is small but quaint. There is a love-seat that sits to his left in the corner with a coffee-table placed before it, the window beside the sofa displaying nothing of importance beyond that of the outside world; the deep, wine-colored curtains adorning it pulled to each side, thick and goblin-pleated.
“Broody, sulking.” Tony waves a hand around, blunt, “like someone took away your favorite toy.”
Only a kiss and yet, why does he feel so affected by it? He feels like he has been ripped away from something delicious, the heady rush of it profound and taunting.
wants
There is another long moment that passes between them; the total opposite of the companionable silence they shared earlier in the night.
"No one is going to steal me, don't worry. We can't be seen, remember? I don't want my trip in that foul-smelling cap to be for nothing." Tony refutes, adamant. "Plus, somebody
had offered him the drink and the proposition. And now that he is thinking it, perhaps Tony innately knew, in the only way Omega's know when a prime Alpha is within close vicinity, that he was different. He admits Steve has this look about him that separates him from the others; wherein the Alpha's at high social gatherings would surround Tony in a circle of gawking eyes and leering stares, their smiles showing too much teeth, Steve has a gentleness to him that is obvious once you spend more than ten minutes with the man.
to hear Steve moan in pleasure like he had him and return this wonderful feeling Steve had bestowed upon him. Very tentatively, with the utmost caution Tony can have—which is currently not much—he trails his fingers down Steve's chest and stomach, stopping at the end of the happy trail below his navel and touching the leather of his belt.
A stunning scene that painted, but actually experiencing it? That uncontrollable lust? Where everything fades and nothing exists but the Omega and the Alpha? The gap between knowing and experiencing that is so vast it's one of those 'you have to go through it yourself to truly understand' kind of experiences. He believes it goes without saying that Tony finally understands all the hype behind it now, and why it's so damn popular among romance novels. Even now Tony feels it lingering, the Haze receding like waves at shore only to rush back in with the tide, leaving his thoughts overturned like rocks.
okay—as in you should keep doing whatever you're doing and don't stop." He hears him chuckle, feels the breath of it fanning against his mouth.
"Tony," the Alpha warns, low and deep, drawing more heat in his belly. He likes how Steve says his name.
They pass a few more streets before arriving at their destination.
“I don’t have—” the alpha attempts, but he’s cut off by Tony.
Everything fading to black.
The Alpha side-eyes him. "What contract?"
And God, just remembering the
They're both panting with exertion. Steve's skin covered with a fine sheen of sweat and glistening in the soft intimate light of the room. He presses another kiss to Tony's lips, long and soft, nipping at his bottom lip before slanting their mouths together. There is no rush this time. Nothing but laziness and Tony’s fingers skimming along Steve’s biceps; nothing but the faint feeling of being poised upon the precipice of something, a sense of importance dawning over Tony. It leads him steadily through and away from the fog, the hold on his mind relenting and allowing him to push through his instincts.
“Then,” Tony groaned, sound high pitched in his throat. “I hope you know how to carry me to bed because coming in my pants in the bathroom is pretty embarrassing and should not be a thing that happens.”
Steve stepped off the elevator almost three hours later than he'd said he'd be there. He looked subdued from his trip and apologetic for his tardiness, "Sorry, more traffic now than I was expecting."
"No," Tony replied. "Under my roof, my protection, yada, yada. Also, my alcohol you're drinking so shut up and enjoy it."
"Any solutions?" Clint asked, propping his feet up on Bruce's chair.
Bruce looked up from the experiment notes he was going over, "Hey."
"Do you think neither of them would like books?" Thor asked, sounding actually concerned.
Natasha bumped his knee in response, "You're getting downright soft, Clint Barton."
"Good. Do you want me to leave so you can—do that?" Bruce asked, not drawing back.
"What?" he asked, looking up.
Rising and picking up his mug, Bruce offered him a ghost of a smile, "Better get on that, then."
Tony watched her go, chin propped in the palm of one hand. "Think we should take food up to the Asgardians?" he asked mildly.
"You just pissed off half the team," Steve almost yelped.  "Loki tried to take over the world the last time he was planet-side."
“Clint says there’s more than one type and that I’m uneducated regarding that," Bruce said and shrugged, “Basically he’s trying to figure out what movie he wants to watch to relax after the fight today and has decided it should be a communal event.”
For a second Tony just considered her. "Potts," he said finally. "Are we actually dating?"
“Is it enough?” Bruce asked softly.
“Silence and peace,” Loki said faintly, so Thor walked into the next room, still not bothering to turn a light on.
"Okay, now you've lost me," Steve said, curling his fingers around his own cup.  "Why would hating you be for my own good?"
"Well, we should finish up here at least," Bruce offered quietly.
Natasha made her way purposefully through SHIELD headquarters, instinctually avoiding the halls that most people used.  She had made an indirect promise to her partner and she intended to keep it now that Christmas was over.  Rapping twice on Fury's door she waited a brief moment and then entered, closing it behind her. There was a beat where Fury didn't look up. "I'm sure there's nothing that pressing," he started and looked up, single eye registering surprise. "Agent."
"It feels like cheating," Clint said. "It's not but it feels like it." He sighed. "Trying is hard."
"Is she staying?" Clint asked, not looking over. "Are you two going to be a thing again or is she going back? I mean, not that you couldn't leave too."
Tony leaned forward, almost falling off the counter so he could kiss Steve again, hands braced on his chest. Steve chuckled against the kiss, "Come on, we just decided this couldn't go any farther here."
"Alright," Clint said, and found himself stopping in front of a men's fashion store, looking at the ties in the window. His eyes automatically picked out a dark green one, the pattern embroidered in the same color with small pinpricks of mint green. He'd shopped there before, one Christmas when he'd been out on a mission until late.
Jarvis made a sound suspiciously like he was clearing his throat. "Hopefully go nowhere near Fury," Clint muttered.
Tony shifted like he was deciding what to do before he lifted his legs up to wrap around Steve's waist. "Yes and no. My parents didn't. Obadiah didn't. Yinsen didn't and he had a plan."
"They will get better.  But it won't happen overnight.  It'll take time and you have to be willing to let it," she replied.
Dr. Banner looked toward the two blonds, dropping his gaze back to his juice for a moment before turning his attention to Tony, "Company could be nice."
By the end of the night, they realized the first fondue set had moved beyond flirting into outright protection of its new found love and while they all managed a full, chocolate slathered meal, it was hard won. Samuel had perched himself up high, washing his paws as he watched the fight, and by the end of it even Thor's smile was almost genuine.
"I hope Darcy and Eric are having a good Christmas," Thor said, smiling as children ran past them, throwing snow balls before they stared wide eyed at the Asgardian, even in Midgardian clothing.
"Yeah?" he finally looked up and over. "That requires two people want the same thing."
Thor blinked once, having been intent on the hurt under his chest instead of other things, like the Midgardian notions of privacy, and the fact they were both in Tony's bed. "If you like."
Steve shook his head, "Older."
Bruce poured himself another mug of tea and turned back to Clint, "I do know. But I also know you take risks that most people wouldn't think to take."
“I’m fairly certain he’s not allergic to anything,” Jarvis replied. “The serum and so on. However, you should probably find a different peace offering if that is a concern.”
"It's Christmas Eve!" he said. "Why did no one remember it was Christmas Eve?" Tony looked up in some alarm.
"Long enough to outlive their mother," Loki replied icily.
Her lips curled upward at that, "Alright, true. What about hard wood or something like that instead of tile?"
Clint managed for once not to say what he thought of that originally. "Well, at least she had some experience yeah?"
"You're over reacting."
Bruce spoke softly again, "You said four guys and a girl? You're asking Thor and Agent Romanov too then?"
His eyes slid away. "I have no illusions that I lost two of my best agents that day," he said. "Because Phil Coulson had always been my best eye and Barton will never come back. I'm not asking you to leave them, you were always supposed to be a part of that team one way or another," he said, eye moving back. "But I hope they're not assignments that are mutually exclusive," and he left the
The string of words that were muttered under her breath at that were definitely not English, nor were they complimentary, "You mean to tell me that Stark's been having drinks with Loki, you found this out, and have since come to the conclusion that the Hulk is hyper-protective of you?"  Natasha shook her head, motioning to the couch, "If you can sit still come sit down."
“And you think that has anything to do with you?” Thor asked, barely turning his chin over his shoulder, not quite looking back at Loki.
"This should just take a minute," Bruce said, stepping into the store to inquire about the steampunk-style telescope that was in the window.
She looked pointedly toward the windows, but nodded, "I never said you weren't."
His partner finally met his eyes and shook her head, "He's not joking, Clint."
"Why not ask him yourself?" Loki replied, turning his attention to his drink.
"Bed for what?"  Natasha asked from where she'd entered silently.
"You expect to sleep on Christmas?" he laughed, taking the back stairs rather than the elevator.
"Tony, I'm trying.  I'm blundering my way through it, but I'm trying," Steve said, leaning back on his heels.  "I'm tired of fighting with you.  But every time I open my mouth something else wrong comes out of it."
name on them anymore."
"Something that doesn't involve property damage at least," Natasha said with a shrug.
Jane turned, her face lighting up when she saw him, "Thor!"  Steve looked in her direction, smiling faintly at her as she crossed the room quickly to Thor.
"What? Why not name the cat after his hammer?" she asked and Thor laughed, shaking his head and trying not to fall over the edge and start crying. He was pleased his friends were there. He
The other man fell very still at that, blue eyes focusing on Tony, "I'm trying not to read into what you just said. Can you spell it out for me or am I going to have to let that one go?"
"It's no trouble," Bruce replied, locating a mixing bowl and starting on the batter.
“It was rather shocking,” Tony agreed with a dark smile. “Luckily we’ve already formed a club.”
Bruce saw Tony pause and turned his attention to the other, tensing as well when he caught sight of the ornament.  He carefully set the lights down and took a couple of deep breaths.
"I've had better days," he allowed. "But it's not so bad I'll go out and get myself killed." His eyes were sharp as he watched Bruce.
"Seems like a decent plan to me at the moment," Clint remarked.
"Xavier, Charles Xavier?"  Steve asked.
Steve's mouth twisted at that, but he nodded, placing a kiss on Tony's throat, "No compliments then. That goes for you too."
“What?” Loki asked, tone frigid.
"Don't go there, Cap," he said, as much a warning for himself as Tony.
“Yes,” Thor laughed. “Merry Christmas indeed.” He paused. “You know to stay here, don’t you? If the others saw you I don’t want to get into that fight.”
"I'm beginning to understand that," Steve answered.  "He was different when I knew him."
The blond offered him a bit of a smile, “Well, in that case, I...Thank you, Tony.  This, it means a lot to, well, to have a place to come back to.”
"I'm still not entirely sure, but probably Tony."
"I'm not good with this trust thing," Tony said. "And to be fair to that, you haven't seen me try to make anyone hate me."
Another flash of lightning went by the window.
The kitten pressed into his hands, mewing again.  Steve smiled, "We've all got room for it, really.  It shouldn't be a problem, should it, Jarvis?"  He glanced at the ceiling.
"I'm confused about why he's still in this city even," Steve mused.
She ran a gloved hand through her hair, speaking more to herself than to Thor, "Well, there's not much incentive for him to do much else at that point."
Tony just blinked once.
"A treatise on the moral implications of travel to Earth," Thor smiled.
Thor seemed to consider. "We could pick her up in the Quinjet," Clint offered, as they had requested and received a jet of their own. "If she wants to come."
“This year I brought enough for everyone,” Rhodey said. “And Tony, the plane better be real this year.”
"Only when it's deserved," Loki replied with a shrug.
Loki's lips curled upward ever so slightly, "It's fascinating how often those things go hand in hand."
"Yeah, you don't happen to have any blinding ideas about that, do you?" Clint asked, blowing on his hands.
"The bit where he went after Stane alone and had me blow the roof with him
"What just happened?" Tony asked, entering and looking over his shoulder. "I have never seen Barton that spooked and he came from here. Oh, and you're not big and green. So what did you do?"
Kicking the chair around, Tony crossed his arms and stared at him. "I don't actually owe you any answers."
"Speaking from experience?" Bruce asked, glancing at him.
She shook her head, leaving a message for Clint, "We're going to be late, hopefully not more than an hour, but give us an extra two.  Have Thor call Jane so I know if I'm flying to New Mexico tonight, and if any of you know what you want for Christmas call me back."  She hung up and followed Tony, pausing by a display of fountains, "These are nice."
"Did I put any caveats on the original promise?  Tell anyone and you can go back to testing your drinks for poison."
Never had there been so long a stretch of time without him in all of Thor’s thousand and five hundred years.
Bruce rose quickly, starting after him but stopping not sure if he should follow the other. Tony watched Clint stomping down the stairs and heading to the gym. Emerging on the roof, he looked over at Bruce. "Well, I was going to see how Clint was doing but now I think I might ask you instead."
"You will be," Loki replied, drawing his magic around him.
Natasha fell completely still at that, "He kissed you?"
"They should actually work as fondue sets now," Charles said, off-handedly. "Kurt says the one is quite a good swords-appliance."
"Why wouldn't we keep it?" Clint asked, looking like he was more than prepared to fight anyone who would want to get rid of the kitten.
Steve was white-knuckled, his blue eyes cold, "What happened to the bastard?"
Clint took a breath and let it out. “He calls me Cupid. I think it was supposed to be derogatory except it’s not anymore. He even, um, brought me flowers from the botanical garden last week when we, you know, crashed into it. And through it. And out the other side.”
"Look, I managed to get that arc reactor in me by myself," Tony pointed out and Thor was looking at him.
"Yes," Thor agreed, smiling at her, dimples in his cheeks and Darcy glanced between the two of them and back to Eric before throwing her hands up and moving to stand in line.
Clint stared at her a long moment. "Natasha," he said finally, drawing her full name out slowly like so he rarely did. "When you told me,
Steve crossed the room at that, his tone taking on a warning note, "Clint..."
Bruce offered Thor a faint smile and a nod, "It is."  He pushed open the door of a bookstore he thought looked promising, "Let's try here first."
"About a year later," Rhodey said. "That's a simpler story in that the arc reactor, the only thing keeping him alive, ending up poisoning his blood stream. Instead of being the height of maturity and telling anyone," Rhodey paused, mouth twisting. "He started doing his damndest to make us hate him while giving away all his possessions. I got a suit, the Mark II I think, and Pepper became CEO of the company. He didn't want us to mourn, so he did it in the most annoying way possible of course. Story short, he found a new element after from prodding from Nick Fury and is still alive to cause us all ulcers."
"Not up to lab issues," Tony hummed, rolling onto his side.
"We had other things on our minds?" Clint offered.
"I am not over reacting!" Clint thundered and Samuel's ears flickered back, his tail poofing out.
Steve gestured to the pile of decorations, "We've still got a lot of these to put up and around the room.  Bruce, Clint, you got the lights handled?"
“Okay,” Clint said softly.
Shuddering at that touch, Steve drew a deep breath, "God, Tony."
"Not that stupid, thanks."
"Has anyone actually had real food yet today?" Bruce asked in response.
"Is there anything we need to work out yet?" he asked, putting his hands flat on the desk and pushing himself up.
"And that's why I'm sorry," Clint said, folding his hands over his knees. "It's not easy and you shouldn't—" suddenly his head snapped around, like a bee had stung him. "But you're not even
“It is a state that will probably not last,” Thor said, inclining his head. “Thank you.”
"Eh," Tony shrugged. "Well you caused it in him, so why not honestly?"
Tony's eyes widened and he jerked the chair back around because he couldn't remember where the nearest pair of sunglasses were and he knew his eyes showed all his lies. "Because you kissed me."
The scientist's eyes widened slightly, "Those...those are his vintage cards, aren't they?"
"Oh the press will have a field day.  I do hope I can obtain copies of those headlines wherever I end up."
Steve thought about the sketches he had and shrugged, "There's one he might.  I could try and find a frame for it. Maybe."  He picked up one of the kids’ chemistry sets and considered it, smiling a bit, "A crystal growing kit could work."
He sat for a long moment on the edge of his bed, not moving, not breathing much, with only the streetlights from down below to see by. But he did not need to see when he could hear Loki moving around slowly.
Glancing at the other, Bruce nodded, "That's the current trend."  He considered what he was looking for and looked at the signs indicating how the store was arranged, turning toward the sports books.
"For you maybe," Steve answered. "Me? I'm beat. I hear this rumor there's a room for me around here somewhere?"
“For telling me of my brother,” he said. “I,” he stopped again, letting out a breath. “I do not mean to belittle any of his crimes. But I have missed him. It is a relief to know he has both been quiet as well as fine.”
"Which is pretty much never," Tony muttered, shaking his head. "Come on then, Charles, let’s go give the grand tour and get it out of the way, or you'll stay here for hours like an overbearing grandmother nitpicking everything."
“Oh do look up,” Tony said and after a second Steve did, squinting to see mistletoe above them.
"Which is why I will send Clint to take Erik out while he's still surprised," Tony replied and Clint's head snapped up.
"I can make those," Tony replied promptly, dragging his eyes abruptly away from Steve.
"Loud," Thor said after a moment. "Fandral wants to believe himself a lover, Hogan is more interested in weapons, and Volstagg in eating. But they can all agree to drinking."
"There always is," Thor said, bracing one leg back and pushing with his hands. "But you would not see, nor take it."
"I don't think I want to bring up Fury's manipulations to his victims," Clint muttered, burying his face in his hands, moving his fingers up to rake through his hair.
That earned a laugh, as Charles called a counter response, "And yet you've picked up a tower of strays yourself."
"Well first he approached the kitten, lifted the little guy’s paw, and then seemed to stop and pick the whole thing up and then he was like a kid in a candy store excited," Tony said. "I'm thinking there's a story there and I'd like to hear it."
Offering the spymaster another long look, Steve finally turned and exited the conference room, closing the door firmly behind him.
"Well you wouldn't hex me for sex jokes, I just don't know where the boundaries are," Tony said, totally idle as he finished his drink, setting the glass down.
"I could always call Lehnsherr," Tony said after a beat. "That would be funny as hell."
Huffing, Clint crossed his arms over his chest. “Of course there is, which is what I’m going to be teaching you. So, Tony, any thoughts on what first?”
Her lips curled upward briefly, "Well that's what you have—” She broke off before she finished the sentence, glancing toward where Coulson would once have stood during the post-op debriefs.
"I don't think he's even given us tours and we live here," Steve said, still considering.  "I think I'm filing this under things I don't understand about Tony."
“Alright,” Clint said, arms still around his knee. “How much do you and the Other Guy ever communicate with each other?”
"That would be me," Bruce answered.  "It's the best way to know where it is to avoid it."
“As I said, vapid wastes of paper.”  Loki shook his head, “Your world crumbles and they spend their time on your sexual escapades.”
"Guys?" Clint tried again, looking around. "Come on, I woke up out of that mind control thing and went down the surface. I haven't seen him since the portal opened--did something happen? Is he injured?"
"Good," he said. "We should... I don't know, wrap presents or something then."
“Cute,” Bruce repeated before he shook his head. “Well now I can’t really date anyone else, because who else would find the Other Guy cute anyway?”
Clint could feel his eyes start to burn and shook his head quickly, jamming the dark tie with red accents to the bottom of the pile before picking up the next one and taking several deep breaths.
"I've not seen him since last we spoke, so if it's increased or continued since then, I unfortunately can't take pride for that," Loki said, a shade too snide.
“You should have told me,” he said, still not looking up from where his arms were braced on the counter, eyes sliding over to the microwave when it let out a particularly loud pop.
Natasha opened her mouth to respond, closed it, repeated the action and finally managed to speak, "Did he realize he'd done it?"
"You were in an active military zone!" Rhodey said. "Without telling me that oh by the way I created a suit that allows me to fly around the world and I'm gonna take out a terrorist cell in a revenge scheme while you have no go ahead in the area."
Clint shrugged. "Can you cook?" he asked, honestly surprised.
Charles stepped off the elevator, looking around and ignoring Tony's plotting of his demise, "Oh, this is nice.  Very modern, but nice."
Tony made it down the stairs in a sleek bathrobe, hair wild around his face and walking past everyone else already gathered for the kitchen. "No one talk to me until I have coffee," he muttered.
“Yeah but he scares the shit out of them,” Tony said, stepping back. “Which okay he does for normal humans too but when you’re made entirely of metal it’s worse.”
Bruce sighed, sitting up fully again, "It's not easy, no."
"Not sure," Tony replied. "I mean, I really have no idea."
“Long distance,” Thor said.
"Because he's been pretty mopey," Tony shrugged. "Which you had nothing to do with, of course."
His legs coming up to wrap around Steve’s waist, Tony cocked his head to one side. “Not comparable,” he decided, one hand skimming down Steve’s chest, just to feel it.
Tony just huffed again, attention already wondering to the phone and floor plans. "Do you want your own floor then?"
"Well, that's one way to do it."  Bruce pulled out a couple of boxes of lights and tossed them to Steve who started weaving them onto the tree.
"Well, that dumb luck of yours had better hold," Pepper replied, looking at him.
"Well, you could have asked," Clint said. "Probably wouldn't have answered but—Steve was there when they finally told me about, about his death," Clint said. "So he heard. And all of Shield more or less knew. I did tell Tony. Mostly because I wanted him to get me very drunk."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I still have nothing," he sighed, turned to trudge down another aisle.
Watching the Thor carefully, Steve shifted to stand nearer to Tony.
"Basically," Clint agreed, free hand wrapping around one of the ties before he thought about it.
Thor sighed again, running a hand over his face. “
Swallowing, Clint looked off to the side. "Nick Fury dropped by to give me the money from Phil Coulson's apartment," he said, and was suddenly heading back toward the stairs.
Looping his arms around Clint, one resting on the other's hair, Bruce nodded, "I know.  I'm going to take great pleasure when he finally is gone for good."  There was a contented rumble in one specific corner his mind that he shied away from at that thought.
Steve was carefully gong over the slim pickings that remained, considering the gaps in the branches and the size of each tree, "It's not the end of the world, that's what the garlands are for after all."
"You know, that's entirely true," Tony said, shrugging into his coat and checking his watch one more time. "I'm sure I'll see you around at some point or another, one way or another."
"I wish you would come with me then," Thor said.
"I'll bet that Jarvis could cue up some light kids' movie if we asked," Natasha said.
"Informative," Tony said, watching him.
The receptionist frowned, certain that the man in question should be much older than the one standing there. Before he could call up, Tony came breezing in from the outside, stopping when he noticed who was standing there. "Oh, what're you doing here?" he demanded, wrinkling his nose from where he was carrying several packages of supplies he'd handpicked to make the kitten a bed.
“I do,” Clint said after a beat. “It just—I’m not sure this is the right time.”
A-A-A-A
"I highly doubt they would come close to touching Thor's lifespan.  He would have to watch them grow old and die, just as he watched their mother."
"You've given them all a place to stay here then?"  Charles asked and he looked almost smug.
“Not by following your example,” Tony said and paused as a small child, with blue and green spikes for hair looked up at him on the way out the door.
"Alright it was less of a grey area and more of an ethical violation, but there was no brain function and no family," Charles replied.
“You are one of the benefits,” Steve said when Tony thought he had fallen asleep. “You know that right?”
Thor nodded once again before he turned and left the room almost as abruptly as he came in, leaving Tony and Steve standing. “I don’t actually think that could have gone better,” Tony said after a beat of silence.
Bruce looked seriously tempted, but shook his head, "No."
"No," Clint said. "But I'm sure I will be."
Dinner passed in conversation and talking about what had happened in the time since they had last seen one another.  Or rather, Bruce would deflect or give vague answers about that time, but was more than willing to encourage her to talk.  He was able to talk at length about some of the locations he had been but never in too much depth about why he had been there to begin with.  Her research seemed to be progressing, though there had been a few setbacks—nothing as major as his change fortunately—and her father was foaming at the mouth about Bruce being back in the States.  SHIELD had pulled off a pardon and protection for Bruce and the scientist wasn't sure whether to thank Fury or assume he now owed the man something.  He would go with the second and wait for the other shoe to drop.
Bruce answered from where he was getting himself a cup of tea, "Tony was having drinks with Loki."
“So you—”
"It's procedure," Fury replied, but his voice had gone softer, the line of his shoulders lessening. "You wouldn't return any of my calls or letters. I would have tried a carrier pigeon if it thought it would get through. But you would have never lived there, we both know that."
"I could come over here," she offered.
Steve looked briefly stung by that, but quickly set that aside, "Right.  Alright.  I'll let you get back to work."
The clerk's eyes widened, "The whole stock, sir?"
"A flatterer," Victor drawled. "How charming."
Charles laughed quietly, "It took you long enough. But honestly, Christmas day went well? I'm still a little in shock here, you'll have to give me a moment."
"It's what?"
Very carefully, Clint didn't reply, taking a hasty swallow of the coffee instead. "If you say so," was all Tony muttered as Thor surveyed the room.
Bruce pushed himself up, sitting against the headboard of the bed. “Is there a good time?”
"I'll keep it in mind next time," Steve murmured before stepping inside.  "Hey, Tony."
Tony paused. "Um, good? Is good the right answer? Swell."
"Ugh, and lose the joy of commercial air travel? Come on, I know Stark has better alcohol than this."
"When Steve and I first came on board. Natasha mentioned them, told Steve that he'd probably ask if he would sign them," he murmured in response.
"I've been noticing, that, yeah. She seems to organize everything around him too," Bruce remarked, a hint of a smile on his features.
"Even when the data he's working with is obviously flawed?" Bruce responded.
"They don't seem to like each other."  He paused, "But Tony's giving him a tour."
"That sounds like something you came up with," she offered him a smile. "I'll remember it."
Tony backtracked from where he was glaring at a toy display. Seeing one of the fountains that lit up he picked it up, turning it over to see the description, which claimed that it was soothing and grinned.
"Thor, Bruce, Clint," he listed off and paused. "Steve."
Bruce entered the kitchen, blinking at the group, "Do I want to ask?"
"I mean what did he do?" His eyes were locked on Tony's as much as possible considering the other's sunglasses he was still wearing, "I have no idea what Pepper and Rhodey were talking about."  But he had suspicions.
"Give me your usual," Fury replied, shaking his head slightly, arms crossed loosely over his chest. "If I need more, I'll tell you. Just what happened and what's on the ground."
"I think they're flirting," Tony sighed and Clint laughed, carefully trying not to look over at Bruce.
"Someone's gotta take them," Clint said, shrugging.
Looking ready to shoot back some comment, Steve pulled himself up short at a sharp throat clearing from the stairs. Bruce stepped into the room again, having managed to calm down before the Hulk showed up, but didn't say anything and went back to hanging up lights, looking for all the world like he'd just had something caught in his throat rather than intending to cut off Steve's probable response to that.
“Oh no,” Bruce said. “That sounds like a
She kept her gaze steady as she nodded very slightly, "I did."
"Yeah, well, nice and me don't really get along on any level," Tony said, looking away and counting down equations in his head.
Tony tilted his spine up into the kiss before sinking back down into the mattress. "What did Rhodey say anyway?” Tony asked, trying not to look too hungry as he watched Steve’s face.
"The cat," Thor smiled. "He is growing quite well."
As the conversation had taken a darker turn than he had expected after opening presents, Thor boomed happily over the food, making sure everyone had a plate and food. Steve rose after a moment, setting his untouched breakfast aside, and missed the way Pepper tracked his movement as he slipped across the room to where Tony was. Tony shifted so that he could get out of Steve's way, assuming he was heading toward the kitchen.
"Then I'm good if you're good, cap," Clint replied, lifting his glass.
Clint sighed and looked down. "Uh. Great."
"So mistletoe and then you offered him your shower," Charles said, drawing the conversation away.
For a long moment, Rhodey watched him. "Alright," he said after a beat. "What do you want to know about then?"
"Well, that requires pre-planning, though in the future I should probably plan for the fact that Nick Fury is an asshole," Tony replied, waiting until Pepper was closer to slide an arm around her waist.
"Hence the hope of finding something," Bruce said as he wove his way through the store, trying to find anything for Tony.  He paused in front of a display of alarm clocks, picking up one of the unboxed ones to examine the casing for a moment.
"And you come to me for help?" Victor asked, kicking the shards of the vase under the bed. "I'm flattered I'm sure."
Steve turned away from the coffeepot, "Missed...?"
"So, we'll need to take him to the vet, and get food and like a bed or something," Steve said, already making a battle plan.
"And you managed to have a nice Christmas?" Charles asked, arching an eyebrow.
She ran her fingers through one of the front locks of her red hair, causing it to cling to her skin as she considered that, "I'm going to set aside the very serious concern over what that says about the Hulk as part of Bruce and focus on what you said originally.  You think the Hulk is in love with you?"
"You still owe me a plane," Rhodey said, even though he was already looking at the packaging of the box, fully intending to try and fly it off Tony's reconstructed balcony after breakfast.
"Which is still a lot higher than I'd like it to be," Steve said.  "But I don't know what to do to change that so," he paused before speaking again, "I guess the real question I've got is, what can I do?"
"Not a lot of people get excited about books. Sure, they read them, but actually find them exciting?  That's not the most common thing."
Or the Avengers fail at Chistmas--the finale
"Is this the 'so can we keep him' moment then?"  Bruce asked, arching an eyebrow.
"You can kiss me," Bruce assured him.
"Says the man who is still fully dressed," Steve muttered, his lips brushing over Tony's skin.
Clint hummed, considering before he reached over, twining his fingers together with Bruce's. Stilling, Bruce waited a second to see if this was going to last. When he did he smiled and squeezed Clint's hand back.
“Okay,” Steve said, looking bemused but also unbearably fond and Tony's chest was too tight so he pulled Steve back down, biting into his mouth.
did you know about this already?"
Bruce looked between them, mostly focusing on Clint, "When did you find out?"
Steve paled at that, "You ran into a plane?"
Strolling along the streets a few blocks away from Avenger's Tower, an illusion cast around him to make himself shorter, his hair lighter, and his features softer, Loki paused to consider the headline in the paper, regarding an attack by one of the Fantastic Four's foes that had taken out a cafe a mile and a half from where he stood.  He knew he should be actually hiding, rather than out where he required his still depleted magic reserves to conceal himself.  And he certainly should be far away from the locus of his defeat, but he was curious as to how long he would manage to avoid capture.
"Not to mention we could have had the whole issue of 'Loki's on the loose' wrapped up weeks ago if you'd mentioned this."
“Good morning, Anthony,” Thor replied. “I see evidence that you spent the night well.”
"What brought you to New York?"  Bruce finally asked over dessert.  "I figured after the last time, well..."
Also this story underwent a fairly extensive edit over the last month or so. Most of it was just tightening up scenes and sprucing up dialogue. The only scene with a full on tonal change was the one between Clint and Bruce in chapter 11.
Tony tensed, eyes darting around Steve’s face before nodding. Steve glanced at him again, before heading to the kitchen and starting the coffee. Stopping in the doorway, Tony looked over his shoulder before back to Steve. "So how will you react when the tabloids find out?"
"Jarvis says Tony doesn't like animals and it's technically his place," Steve answered.
She crossed to his desk and set a small package down on it, stepping back again, "Happy Holidays, Director."
"Look, I only dealt with Tony when it came to his contract with the army, when it came to that side of things," Rhodey said, spreading his hands. "I never figured it all out, like if they were sleeping together or if Stane's eyes were just that creepy, or how they split stuff up but I know Stane was part of the board and they talked a lot and Tony generally didn't move without Stane's permission—except when he did. So, there was Stane, there was Tony, and Stane paid some terrorists to take Tony out, only they cottoned on to who he was and decided to ask him to build weapons for them instead." He paused, breathing. "He was held in a cave out in the desert, made the arc reactor out of scraps and his own weapons that had been illegally sold to them, built the Iron Man suit and exploded the whole base, which is how I finally found the moron when he crash landed."
"I'm not slinking," he said except that he sat down. "I'm running."
"I thought tension would keep them in balance—Rogers from doing anything too crazy and Stark from sliding that far. Apparently it was the wrong tension. Did you ever get a look at the shield Stark was building, a few years ago?"
"I'm not," Clint said. "I'm not sure one way or another."
“Oh, it, it died a couple of months ago and I haven’t gotten a replacement,” he answered.
"His great—" Steve actually propped himself up on his elbows and started to turn over at that, "You were
Tony tilted his head up. "You know—" but whatever he was about to say was cut off.
"And give up the lab and grant and research?"  He shook his head, "I won't ask that of you.  What you're working on could change the world for the better so much, Betty.  I’m not worth that.  And the danger that would put you in is too much."
“Enough that I’m certain it will prove hard to explain at some point,” Loki said and Thor took a step back, Loki staying pressed up against the wall.
"Of course I came up with it," Tony grinned. "Because if we can't save the Earth you'll be damned sure we'll avenge it."
“He has not tried to kill me since the arc reactor and suit,” Tony replied. “But, uh, I’m working on contingency plans if he decides to pick up the mantle of rebellion again.”
"No," Bruce answered, his tone tense and his breathing forcibly even. "How can you not get him at all? I'm sure there are more than enough newspaper clippings and news videos that you could figure some of it out.  And I strongly suggest you damn well do so."
Finally managing to catch a breath enough to speak, Charles nodded, still grinning, "Your resentment is noted and ignored."
Loki's lips curled upward, "I have my ways.  The apple's my offer for passage and asylum."
. Star Trek has movies.
Steve turned to face him, leaning against the counter, "I'll tell 'em to go to hell.  It won't work, but it'll make me feel better about them nosing in on our private lives.  But you're asking if I'll run, aren't you?  I'm not one to back down, no matter what gets thrown at me.  You're stuck with me, Tony."
“Over a couple of nights though I think,” Natasha advised.
"Alcohol and I don't mix," Bruce answered, considering his host and the other man in the room as well.  "I was really just coming up to check with you about some results and a potential lab issue."
“I actually think they made their peace with each other a little while ago,” Steve said and Tony blinked. “No, honestly, I think they did.”
"I didn't actually mean that," Clint said, shrinking back slightly. "But why would you give something like that up? If you could keep it, I mean."
“And out the back door,” Jarvis added for their benefit, and Clint snorted.
"You can take it back," Tony said, setting aside the socks and arching a brow at Clint's childhood crystal growing kit, Bruce's alarm clock with removable panels getting a smile and then becoming entirely distracted with the Asgardian compass Thor had given him. He still had Steve's present on one knee but hoped the compass would be a good excuse for distraction.
“We had a team first, copycat,” she said and moved on, leaving Tony gaping at her. Charles had to lean on the doorway of the kitchen he was laughing so hard.
"How do you think it'll be living with the lot of them?"
"Is that a good reaction, yes or no?" Clint asked, watching the doorway.
Steve's jaw tensed slightly at that description, "And you say he was running the company for Tony?"
“Well, it’s natural when you’re kissed,” Tony said, except he still stared at Steve and his eyes had always been the most honest part of him.
For another moment Thor looked at her. "At least allow me to sit down," he said finally.
“Yes,” Thor said, angry because he paused and leaned back. “You are injured.”
"I still don't owe you answers for that," Tony said but his voice was quiet.
"They didn't tell me," Clint said, tongue loosening with the drink. "Tasha, Fury, Steve. They didn't think I needed to know." He looked down at Tony. "You didn't tell me either."
Entering the room, kitten in his hands, Clint paused as he looked between the two men there. "Should I not interrupt?" he asked, not sure how to read their body language but certain something was off in the other man. He held himself wrong and it put Clint on edge.
"I don't know," he shrugged again. "I mean, are you happy?"
"I think it has more to do with the hang over," Clint replied. "Drink your juice and then go at the coffee, alright?"
"There are gifts exchanged?" Thor asked, starting to look happier than he had since he informed them his brother was missing. "Ah! May I invite Jane as well?"
"So what have you been entertaining yourself with?" Clint asked, not looking up but pulling the plate of food closer to him.
“Let us say that I still love you,” Thor said, a deep rumble. “Even after everything you have done.”
Anyway, I hope it was worth the wait, I hope you guys still enjoy the story. VS out.
He nodded in response, "Yeah, I did. And you kissed back."
"Alright," Tony said after a beat. "Accurate."
"Yeah, good night," Clint said, waving him off before looking over at Natasha. He hesitated, unsure if they should talk or continue their truce since Star Wars.
"Challenge accepted," Tony replied and Clint finally laughed, the sound short but present.
But, he reminded himself over and over, that was just Steve’s way. It wasn’t actually a reflection of who he thought Tony was.
“Probably the, whatsit, rec room or whatever Tony calls that massive TV screen that’s allowed to have a room around it. Actually, he’s been stuck in his lab all afternoon and evening and I think Steve is going to start begging around it, so let’s fetch him for some enforced relaxation too,” Clint rattled off, heading toward the elevator to where Tony’s main lab was in the basement, below the bottom of the tower. Their private elevator reached the first floor, all their floors, and the basement, with no access to the floors in between and a special key card and code needed to get into it.
"Natasha ordered me one," Thor said. "Or it was for Clint and ended up in my hand. Sometimes things like that happen.”
Jane smiled at that, "Stranger things have happened."
“…What?” Tony managed after a moment.
Pepper nodded, "It will, possibly, calm down at meetings eventually. They're still blustering on about this that and the other thing. Little things. Things that are not now nor never shall be relevant."
"I'm not," Bruce replied, watching Clint and trying to gauge the other.
"That's alright," Thor beamed and then frowned at Rhodey and Pepper. "I do not have gifts for you."
Steve offered him a grateful, crooked smile, "So you'd build something for him them?"  He gently set the kitten down again.
Scratching the base of the kitten’s tail, Clint propped his chin up with his other hand, elbow on the counter.
"Totally clear," Clint said, holding up his hands. "I apparently have you and Bruce and the Hulk on that."
"A couple blocks from here, it was shivering in an alley."
Once he was safely inside the Limo, Tony became intently focused on his phone, tracing out a couple new designs. Pepper sighed, reaching down to slip off her high heels. She shrugged out of her blazer as well, turning enough to look at Tony where he was sitting next to her, "Well that went better than it could have."
"I'm not sure any of us actually get enough sleep to count as healthy, Cap," Bruce said, finally drawing his attention away from Clint and Natasha.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony waved a hand. "Anyway, perhaps it's time to settle down with someone good and maybe he doesn't have to be a spit and polished icon either."
"Yeah, who do you think build most of the stuff in this room?" Tony demanded. "You think some subpar store bought bed or toys is going to be nearly so useful?"
"Of course," Jarvis replied, already flicking the screen on.
“Yeah,” Tony said, throat thick. “I know that.”
Tony was still frowning. "Yes, yes, but why would you
“I told you. I came for drinks.  If I desired something more than that I would be out seeking it.  As it stands now, I seek color and sound.  This is enough.  What brings you here, while we’re on the subject?”  Loki asked, arching an eyebrow.
Bruce stepped further back from the edge, "Yeah, I just usually try to avoid doing it so spectacularly."
"Not that I like.  I haven't worked with paints of that quality ever, and I haven't had the chance to work with paints at all since well, since this," he gestured to himself.  "I have a couple of sketches, but they're just that—sketches."
"We were busy?" Clint offered. "Who's that for? I mean, so long as it's not for me then forget I asked."
"Do you have
"But I have one really honest question for you," Clint said, leaning back against the wall. "What the hell do you think that arc reactor he has does?"
Picking up a book on Astronomy, Bruce added it to the one already in his hands without commenting on it, "Who knows, maybe we'll answer some of our questions sooner rather than later."  He looked around, trying to figure out if there was anything for anyone else there.
"I was thinking about it. I might wait until he's done with the remodel entirely, but then I'll probably come," she answered, watching him from the corner of her eye.
"Well," Tony said after a beat. "You learned from your mistake, right?"
"That's all we can ask for," Steve said, nodding.
"It takes all of three seconds to turn it over," Natasha remarked, considering the kitten.
Clint had meant to slink past the living room, except the flash of Natasha's hair stopped him. "You didn't come home last night," he said, forcing his voice to be light. "Make up with Nick?"
"Share that information and I'll gut you," Loki said, his tone still conversational as he got to his feet and picked up his coat.
"Then release me," Loki grit out.  "For if you do not, I'll see if I can't make this next wound last longer."
The alluring scent from earlier quickly envelopes him though, suffocating in the most pleasant way, the omega in him wanting to drown in it, which is odd; he has never reacted this way to another person before.
Tony can see the flashes of buildings passing them in the peripheral of his vision. He looks at the Alpha and remembers how the man first appeared to him when he first entered the bar, wondering if it’s a trick question.
that resides deep in Tony’s gut, his accumulated confidence gradually receding with the fact that Tony has no idea how to proceed. So he busies himself. He steps deeper into the room and snatches up a pen from the little stand sitting beside the TV, and slides it between his fingers whilst surveying his surroundings, repeatedly clicking it.
Damn. Tony never stood a chance, did he?
So Why? Why didn't Steve take? Didn't he think it was within his right? Not that Tony would have minded; he had felt completely ready for anything in the moment.
Steve raises a brow, a tiny tilt of his lips curling up. “And? How did I look?”
He needs more than just
He feels so hypersensitive, his body producing more slick. It’s as if everything is jumping into hyper-drive; a myriad of urges and feelings long dormant, now awakening with each tender touch the alpha lays upon him. He wants Steve to slip his hand lower, to move beyond his tease and right down to his—
There is pleasure shooting down his spine, making his thighs squeeze around the Alpha’s head, his other hand twining his fingers through Steve’s hair, tugging slightly. He can feel himself clenching around nothing, the urge to be filled rising; growing hotter and closer with each stroke of Steve's tongue, his cock throbbing.
Steve spreads him wide, hooks Tony’s legs over his thighs.
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, KNOW THAT Y'ALL ARE THE BOMB.COM. Anyways, I don't want to take up too much of your time so I will jump right to it.
“Kiss me again,” his voice is a tad firmer, but soft, the need rising inside him leaving no more room for doubt. A gnawing hunger opening up deep in his belly.
“Yes?” The man queries, his timbre low, deep and uninterested. The man’s eyes are murky blue in the poor lighting of the bar. He’s dressed as if he’s been away at work and only stopped in for a drink, his coat placed carelessly on the stool beside him.
Steve sucks a breath in, words lost in his exhale.
"And?"
His cheeks tinge pink at the question.
When Steve thrusts in a third time something gives—the force behind it so hard and tenacious he feels something
that?"
Steve reveals but it passes right over Tony's head, who is too busy persevering through his mantra, trying hard to clamp down on the nerves gathering beneath his skin. It grows less steady the closer they get to their room, which isn't even that far—a few more steps out of the way after reaching the second floor, then his eyes are staring at the gold-engraved numbers.
So very, very
question—he can't help himself, still drunk off dopamine and Steve's alpha pheromones, he impulsively reaches out and touches it. "But that weird hazy-thingy?" he says while admiring the flesh, soft when you'd think a big Alpha like him would be rough. The surface of his skin like pale marble thinned into tenderness, blonde wisps of hair dusting down the center of his sternum and across the rippling muscles of his stomach in a fair line, disappearing past the waistline of his pants. "What even
wants it. So badly.
The banter leaves a warm feeling inside Tony. Nothing like the heat earlier when he baited the Alpha to comply with his demands. It's more of a gentle warmth, flowing over the vestiges of a cold tension he's been holding onto since before entering the bar. The warmth like the dawning sun gradually building in it's heat.
“Okay. I will help you."
but then Steve is pressing kisses along the side of his jaw, leaving Tony bereft of finishing that thought. He feels a finger tracing a trail of fire across his chest, stopping at the collar of his throat, Steve's thumb gently pressing into the hollow of it.
The whole point of this agreement is to rewrite the course of his life. This is providence being broken down and shredded, the epitome of rejection of his oh-so-called-destiny. Stark's are made of iron and teeth, therefore, Tony is made of iron and teeth. It has been stamped deep into his soul since the day he understood what being a Stark meant.
"Stubborn but
What concerns, but equally puzzles Tony, is that Steve hadn't cum, and if he remembers correctly—which he does. He really,
“Steve,” he chokes out, almost out of breath, a little embarrassed at how worked up he is.
He watches him leave, waits until the Alpha disappears through the heavy, wooden doors and turns away, running his hands through his hair.
UPDATE: I made Steve a little older to fit my quickly-growing-plot because suddenly there was, erhm, plot. More plot than what I intended to fit a PWP. So naturally, there were some plot-holes that needed to be fixed. Hence, Steve's age. He is no longer twenty-nine, but a few years older. I would say close to thirty-two?
Tony’s fucked.
That's a lie, he always knew, probably has known it since he first walked into that bar.
counterpart flashes through his head, stoking Tony’s ire.
Ugh, he absolutely
He heaves a long sigh, "so will you help me or not?"
if you are.” Tony leans his face closer—just a small distance—barely noticeable to anyone passing by, but glaringly obvious to Steve, and continues in a soft breath, “I prefer you help me tonight, before the sun comes up.”
The sound is pleasant, affecting him in a slow rise of yearning that creeps at him, Tony more aware of Steve in the intimate space of the car. He briefly wonders about the other sounds the alpha might make, how he will sound if Tony were to do...things. Very
"Omega haze, right. Makes sense now," Tony muses quietly. Haze, Haze, Haze. Who gave it such a bland name? It's such a broad term and so plain and boring. Why not something more like 'Omega-Gone-Sex-Crazed'? Then shortened into 'O.G.S.C.', and then maybe 'O.G.', because saying the acronym would be a mouthful. Like Steve. Like his mouth. Pink and delectable, soft like peaches, dragging hot on his throat and on his chest, down between his thighs in tender little nips...
She isn’t aware of his dislike toward him.
Then he’s sighing and dropping a twenty on the counter-top. He reaches for his coat, then Tony, and proceeds to drag him outside. The Brooklyn autumn air is cool and brisk and it smacks Tony in the face, sobering him a little.
Steve chuckles and pulls Tony closer, “would you have it any other way?"
But Steve nods, softly responding with an ‘okay’ and—
“It was six o’clock in the evening.”
, “—and, and I need help with a very small problem. A teensy one.” He holds a tiny space between his fingers for emphasis.
It flutters to the ground, leaving him bereft except for the pants plastered against his thighs. Then he is taking his hand and leading Tony back to the bed, proceeding to lay him on his back in the center of it. The sheets feel soft against his heating skin, enough to drive him closer to Steve's touch, chasing the warmth of his hands as the alpha peels away his pants. Then he's naked, except for his soaked-through briefs.
“I’m waiting,” the Alpha urges, smooth and deep. Subconsciously, Tony presses his head further back against the pillow, hints of his throat baring.
Tony opens his mouth, attempts to speak, fails, before drawing in another breath and trying again. "J-just give me a minute," he whispers it so low he's not even sure Steve heard him.
"I hope my answer doesn't scare you off," he starts, intentionally delaying his response as he searches for the bartender a final time, wondering where the hell did he venture off to—he needs another drink—before returning to Steve's gaze. ”But... I am nineteen—and before you say anything!" He holds his palms up toward the Alpha, "I am nineteen with a genius IQ level, which technically makes me older than I am."
”’Yes’, what?” Steve glances cheekily up at him, then sucks another love-bite into his thigh, leaving a trail of bruises blooming like rose petals. Tony moans, thrusts his hips but Steve steadies him, holding him down with a hand.
He hadn't realized Steve disappeared into the bathroom, the sound of running water pulling him out of his thoughts. It's another short moment before the Alpha reappears, his indigo shirt ever present, and walking toward Tony.
feels like his conscious thought is locked in constant warfare with his Omega psyche.
Huh. Tony must have said that aloud. It doesn’t matter though. What
Tony's heart picks up pace, gripping the pen in his hold.
Tony remembers the sea of red-faced Omegas sitting all mannerly and bashful, their giggles hidden behind their hands, a hint of sweet fragrance wafting through the air in the classroom. All quietly whispering among themselves when the teacher moved onto the next image in her power-point,
Steve’s other hand moves from the hold on his waist, curling around the hand hanging limply at Tony's side, gently squeezing it before guiding it to the center of his chest.
The Alpha groans, presses his lips beneath Tony’s ear and down toward his swollen gland. The hold on his nape releases, Steve's hand dropping down between his thighs and gathering the slick squelching around Steve's cock—then he is gripping Tony's dick, thumbing his tip. Steve's mouth closes wet around his sensitive gland at the same time, and sucks, a sensation that has Tony jerking violently—then he is suspended and held taught, his muscles squeezing so tight he’s afraid it will cramp up, an electric coiling of energy gathering at the bottom of his spine and deep down between his thighs.
