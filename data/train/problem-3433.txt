"Lovely One, the quiet pool is the serenity of your being. The vast sea of your being whence all life came; its waves are the ebb and flow of the universe you rule."
"Damn. A girl can try..." She turned away from the bed to address Castiel. "Seeing your boyfriend naked isn't the reason I'm here, though."
Dean didn't see anything wrong with what he said, but by the looks he got from everyone, it must have been bad. Cas was banging shit in the sink. Sam was giving him one of his classic bitchfaces. Benny...well, Dean swore he saw the vamp's fangs appear for a second. But Bobby...hell, Bobby snatched him by the collar of his shirt and dragged him outside. Bobby might have still be wearing his coat, but Dean wasn't given a chance to grab his.
"Cas, it's okay, you don't have to finish this," Dean said softly. Castiel gave him a tight smile.
“Cas, you can’t just…you uh, can’t just say things like that man.”
"I didn't watch television, but I can read, Dean. To escape from my family, I would go to the library, and lose myself in books and magazines."
Dean's face rose from where he was feasting on Castiel's nipples. Without the warmth of Dean's mouth, the buds hardened even more in the soft breeze. Dean looked down at him and licked his lips. "Cas...I...uh...will you..." Dean let go of his hands and pushed himself up to a kneeling position. He rubbed the back of his neck, anxiety evident on his face.
Looking a bit frightened, Dean asked, "We aren't picking 'em up at the airport, are we?"
"She looks comfortable. I wouldn't really care, but I'm allergic to cats."
"Want to take one of the snowmobiles?" Benny asked, standing as well.
Pierce sat on the mantel looking down at him with her green eyes as if to scold him for letting his mind wander from the task at hand. He looked at the row of unfilled jars. Benny needed a dozen for a special mail order. So far, he had none. His friend wouldn’t complain if Castiel didn’t have his orders filled, but he would give Castiel a pitying look. Benny assumed, because Castiel lived in a small cabin miles from town…alone…with just Pierce and the wolf for company, that he was lonesome. Truth be told, most of the time, he wasn’t.
"Let me think," Benny said, stopping the car in the middle of the road. Dean turned around and gave Sam the abridged version of the Goddess' plan to keep him hostage. Dean's head was reeling. His father was possibly dying and there was no way for Dean to get to him. He was about to get out of the car and tell Benny to leave him behind. To just make sure Sam got to the hospital, when Chara ran out of the woods and stood in the middle of the road. She faced the car, her eyes locking with Dean's. They were so blue, just like Castiel's. She blinked, then turned her head to look down the road, and then she trotted back into the trees.
"He had Benny in quite a state, and I'm not sure if was all because he is a hunter," Missouri said with a knowing look.
The next day passed quickly. He drove through Kansas and Nebraska, only stopping to get gas and eat. At the South Dakota welcome center, he got out and stretched his legs. He called Bobby to let him know where he was and get updates on the case. Apparently, two of the park's employees were found wrapped in cocoons, with large puncture marks on their bodies. "So, you're thinking Arachnes?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cas!” Dean called.
“Unlike your usual rescues, these ones aren’t even bleeding internally, so they don’t need an ambulance for the ride. As long as you go a speed humans can survive – maybe try to match the usual speed of an ambulance? – straight to the hospital is preferred. Not the ER, though. We called ahead. There’s a team ready in the west wing on the fourth floor. And don’t forget to support their necks in the air.”
“I thought so as well, but… I agree with Gabe. With how old these sigils are, and how complex… I don’t think there’s anything else it could be.”
Cas did not like the sound of Dean Winchester calling him by such a… stiff name, so different from his own. “Mr. Novak sounds so formal. Please, call me, uh,” shoot. Cas realized he couldn’t very well have Dean calling him by any name that felt truly his. He tried to think of a name James Novak would want to be called by. He couldn’t imagine Dean calling him James as Anna had just done. “Jimmy,” he said, saddened as he realized this man he’d grown to care for –yes, he will admit to caring for Dean, not necessarily to anything else his siblings say about him and Dean—would never even be able to learn his name.
“Just pestering me to get a date,” Castiel said, testing the waters.
“Okayyy. Well what should we do now, then?”
“Before you go,” Anna said, also speaking so that no humans could listen in. “Most of the kids aren’t responding, but a couple have spoken. It seems like the demons were doing soul examinations. That’s why so many of them are so unresponsive.”
Dean smiled again. “You’re right,” he said, kissing Cas on the cheek. “Ok, let’s start getting ready.”
“Is this the mayor’s gala?” he asked.
Dean honestly didn’t expect it to go anywhere. He didn’t think Castiel would be interested in him. But Cas shocked him. He looked down at Dean’s lips and licked his own. Pleasently surprised, Dean brought his face closer to Cas’s.
Cas was out in the garden. Watching the bees. Contemplating.
Dean decided to take the time while Castiel was conferring with Renegade and Archangel to review his theory in his mind. He started by brainstorming ways he could get more information.
Dean was glad that his brain had stopped replaying deeply traumatizing moments with Alastair on repeat in his head, but he could do without the decision it seemed to have made to instead play all his interactions with Jimmy on a loop instead.
>>From: 913-555-0401
Gabe flew in, which meant he must have finished with Dean at the school.
“I think that’s a bit of a stretch, don’t worry,” Anna said at the same time that Gabe said “Why’d Anna get a ‘no offense’ too, you didn’t even insult her!”
David nodded motioned to Dean that he could step over the line of “CRIME SCENE – DO NOT CROSS” tape. Victor started walking back where he’d come from and Dean followed close behind.
“Like, a cop was less someone who would save the day and more someone who might take me and Sammy away and we’d never see each other again.”
He sighed then jerked his body up and began sorting out the papers he’d messed up when he face flopped onto it. Benny took another sip from his coffee.
Maybe, if Dean did connect the dots, Cas would be open to more possibilities with the man than he’d originally thought.
“Oh, come on, don’t give me the squint of disbelief,” Gabe said.
“Ellen runs the Road House actually. Remember we saw each other that one time?”
Benny was writing a piece that had to fit in a particularly odd shape for the next day’s paper edition, so he had asked Dean to look at the layout for a second opinion before Benny sent it to Charlie. Dean had rolled his chair around his and Benny’s little desk cluster and was sitting next to Benny’s desk, reading his screen.
Cas turned back to the window. Gabe drew a big heart in the air, then began making obscene motions to the window. Cas grimaced. “I would love for you to introduce me to their pie. But, uh. Do you want to maybe eat it at my place?”
He’d been wrong.
“Good morning, Dean.”
Gabe sighed. “Guess we have our work cut out for us, then,” he said.
More scared than when this very man had held him last. Had told him he was safe. Had brought the terrifying proposition that... maybe it was really over.
“I was gonna fly to Gabe’s but, maybe I’ll just walk over and stop at his car on the way? See what’s up?” Anna said.
“Hey!” Gabe cut in. “Cassie, man, come on. We can’t give up here. Positive attitude! We’re not that desperate!”
“I got it, Bobby. ‘Don’t screw this one up’,” he said in a voice trying to intimidate Bobby. ”Gee you make it sound like I can’t handle things.”
Dean walked over to Bobby’s office. “What’s up, Bobby?”
>>From: Cas
More scared than when he was laying there. Broken. Slowly losing his will. Waiting for Alastair to come back. Waiting for it to start again.
“I doubt it,” Anna said. “He saw us months ago. He would have called us earlier if he wanted to do that, and he has contacted you as ‘James Novak’ before. Considering that is who the phone is registered to, I’d assume that’s who he’s trying to contact now.”
“Come on, Dean.” Jess chimed in. “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.”
Crowley had already cleared out everything that survived the fire, so all that was left was the building itself and the charred remains of some supplies Crowley had deemed unsalvageable. A disturbing amount of what was left consisted of bones from creatures Casitel was certain contained no supernatural properties, meaning they were just killed for fun. And hung on the warehouse walls as trophies. Cas was trying not to think about it.
######
Anna rolled her eyes, and Cas tried to mentally bore into Gabriel with his.
They looked at each other for a beat. He wasn't sure what to do, so he picked up his coffee. "Well. I was on my way to work, so I better get going. See ya, Jimmy."
Ahhh I went back and read the other chapters and there are s o  m a n y  inconsistencies. But it is already tomorrow, so that is a problem for another time. Also, I started this chapter at 10pm  after doing homework all day, so it is not the best. Hope you enjoy, though!
Anna gave Cas a look of encouragement. Cas nodded. He answered the phone. “Hello?”
“Reporting for duty, Mr. Singer,” he said, putting emphasis on the title Bobby insisted on him using at work.
Dean got a confused look on his face and stared off into space (at Cas’s earlobe) for a while. Then his face broke into a smile. “Oh yeah I did! Shit. Looks like we’re gonna have to spend the night here.”
Cas laughed and linked his arm with Dean’s “Yes, I do say we shall, Mister Winchester.”
“God, I hate that douche bag,” Dean remarked aloud, thinking of Crowly. He was Meg’s cousin and Dean knew for a fact Meg was probably one of the few people who hated Crowly more than Dean. It was common knowledge around school that Meg and Crowly hated each other’s guts. Word was Crowly makes Meg invite him every time she has a party or else he would tell her parents about it. Dean figured Crowly would just show up uninvited anyway.
The stupid SOB
#####
“It can be read!”
“Yeah, uh we got enough,” Dean said. “Thanks for your renewal, allowing us to keep the city informed and safe!” he said with an overly cheesy voice and a smile.
Even with all that progress, things had been so quiet that they’d jumped at the chance to check out a simple warehouse fire.
Dean let out a breath. “So the thing is, Cas -- and you better not tell Charlie or Garth or anyone about this, I mean it!” Dean waited for Cas to nod.  “The thing is… I may be a little bit afraid of heights. And I um, I don’t think I can do that.”
He could hear tears in her voice, and he knew she was being sincere. But she didn’t understand. It had happened precisely because he was here.
“Aw, man,” Dean said.
“Dean, you were barely ten feet off the ground, and you’re over six feet tall.”
Cons: If he was wrong, Jimmy would think that he was crazy. Or maybe even that he was only dating him for a chance at an insider scoop. Either way he would most likely get dumped immediately and this was a relationship he really didn’t want to ruin.
He tried to take a step and swayed violently on the spot. “Whoa, whoa,” Dean said as he rushed to his friend’s side. He wrapped an arm around Cas’s back and used it to ease him down until they were both sitting next to each other on the floor. “Take it easy buddy, I got’cha.”
“I think he wrote very respectfully. H left out some things which I’m sure the press already knows which the victims are, perhaps, not ready for the world to know.”
“Actually, you know what,” Gabe said. “This is kind of a lot and… you’re not the best liar. How about I give Dean the interview this time.”
Cas slipped his hand into Dean’s.
He looked at Anna with puppy dog eyes, tilting his head toward Cas. Anna caught on: Cas was just fermenting in regrets at this point. He needed a change of pace. “I suppose we have gotten as we can with the resources we have here on Earth,” she said. “Taking a breather couldn’t hurt. And Cas, I think getting out of the house would help you get out of your head.”
Castiel had rebelled. And probably gotten over half his siblings killed in the process.
Dean nodded at him with a strange face and left.
“Shut up!” Charlie laughed, elbowing him in the ribs.
Gabe gave her a grim smile.
Anna thought Gabriel was trying to move things along too quickly.
And then probably get those people hurt too.
Castiel hadn’t even realized he thought that about the movie until he said it. All of the sudden the movie was hitting a little too close to home. He could feel himself tearing up as he continued. “And to say that all that had been planned the whole time anyway feels cheap. Like why did Thursday have to suffer through all that if it was always the plan anyway?” His voice cracked on the last bit and his tears started falling outright.
More scared than when he was 22, and his brother said he was leaving.
Dean had a baseball game.
Eventually, a truck drove up and a woman got out, shouting “Dean!”
“Any time, Cas,” Dean said wistfully as he watched the man walk away.
In reality Sam had managed to lock up Lucifer, the city’s most powerful mob boss, and his second in command, Alastair, had kidnapped Dean. He’d been beating up Dean daily and said he wasn’t going to call Sam for ransom until Dean was already dead inside. He’d said it had to be that way.
Cas laughed. “It’s good to see you again, Dean.”
But he still didn’t know what, if anything, he should do about the situation. It was possible that Dean hadn’t noticed his siblings with him at the bar, or hadn’t put all the pieces together. Dean was very smart, so Cas somewhat doubted that. But, as Anna had mentioned, when the three of them went about as the Angels they gave the humans no hint that they walk among them every day, or are even capable of making themselves look human. So maybe Dean hadn’t connected the dots. Only time, and Dean, would tell. He decided to just wait, and see what Dean did. But maybe…
“Uhhh,” Mark said, looking a bit flustered. It was clear he had not been prepared for questions. Luckily, one of the EMTs overheard, and answered as they were lifting the fourth student.
“Naomi, Naomi,” the Leviathan clucked his tongue from where he sat, leaned back in a large armchair with his legs propped up on an ornate desk. “How many times do I have to repeat myself! I,” he paused for dramatic effect, “am the mayor. Or, ‘Dick’ is, whatever.” He took his legs off the table and sat up. “The mayor cannot just go gallivanting about, mingling with people willy-nilly during his private time. Cameras are always following during prominent men’s personal time. In order for the mayor to be able to speak with someone in private, the conversation has to be conducted at a public event. Thus, the ball.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam laughed. Jess tugged Dean’s arm up as she got off the couch. “Come on, big guy. Loosen up a little.”
Castiel knew of this. He remembered hearing stories of John Winchester. The human who had somehow managed to kill Azazel. He wasn’t sure how much Dean knew about that, so he stayed quiet. Dean continued.
When Gabe was done Cas thanked him. He couldn’t stop worrying though. “Naomi… she has so many more,” he said in a broken voice.
“SOB”?
He wasn’t sure he believed Gabe’s motives were entirely altruistic, though.
Hi so 2020 is still kicking my ass but I’m back atm. I still feel weird about the police though, so I think this will be the last chapter where they actually play in.
After that Dean had been in the hospital for two weeks. When he got out Bobby made him take sick leave for. After a month Dean was begging Bobby to let him get back to work or he'd go crazy without anything to do. After much persistance Bobby finally agreed. Coincidentally Dean was assigned to go check out the scene the next day when the Angels referred to as Warrior and Renegade had unearthed a group of Lucifer’s followers on the city council. When Casitel had seen him he’d stared at him for several moments, not moving. Dean had stared back. When Castiel broke eye contact and flew away, the Renegade, Castiel's red-headed partner, had actually spoken to Dean.
He finished his third draft.
Dean groaned. “PR. If I have to answer one more stupid person I’m going to scream.”
“See, that wasn’t so bad, right?” Castiel asked
“Of course not.”
The added challenge of trying to stay awake enough for office-level human interaction without caffeine was not a plus, but Dean had been ready to settle into a day of PR work. Then, someone from the telephone bank came and told him that there was something going on with the Angels and gave him the address.
Castiel was sitting in the dorm lobby, watching over the unconscious students. Gabriel had come through earlier, and finished his sweep of the building, but Castiel was still waiting for the EMTs. He was contemplating why these kids had been knocked out but the ones at the music hall had not. And what would have prompted the soul exploration.
Dean tried to play it off smooth. “Yeah,” he said with a chuckle. “Just nervous, I guess. First dates, you know.”
Castiel had been new to human interaction back then. He had tried his best to assure the man that he had been saved. He did not quite know what would be the best way to ensure Dean’s safety from that point, but the man had been throwing up a lot so Castiel had dropped him off at the nearest place where he smelled food.
Once they got to the party Dean had been pulled away by Garth and Benny and Cas had been forced into a crash-session on Star Wars by Charlie. Apparently tonight they we’re going to be watching the second three which were actually the first three which Cas thought was confusing, to say the least.
Dean turned his full attention to the Angels, now. He watched them converse. He had promised himself that he wouldn’t keep enabling his half-baked delusions that the three Angels looked like Jimmy, Anna, and Loki. But now that he knew Jimmy better, had seen him laugh and smile and talk for hours on end… looking at Castiel now… Dean had to admit it almost seemed irresponsible to not consider the possibility.
“Shut up,” Dean said, blushing profusely.
Dean sighed and stepped out of his car.
Dean shook out of it with a jolt. “Sorry. You were saying?”
Cas was grounded. (“Oooh, Cas. Did you do something naughty?;)” ”I may have accidentally shown up in the church parking lot naked, covered in bees. It is a long story” “Dude, you haaaave to tell me how that happened.”)
#####
He watched their flying and listened to their buzzing, relaxed, until morning.
“Yes,” Cas said, and they kissed again.
“Don’t worry, Cassie,” Gabe chimed in. “You’re new to this. You haven’t been on Earth that long. I’ve been here for eons, remember? Contrary to the stories they tell you all up there, most humans don’t actually believe in miracles.”
Gabe continued for just his siblings. “Ok. This is very rare. I’m talking like… it’s happened exactly twice in all of prophet history rare. But there’s a chance, if this prophet is really powerful, like mega-ultra-“
“Crowley.”
Cas chuckled at his brother’s antics as he heard the bell above the door announce a new customer come in. Then he heard the unmistakable voice of Dean Winchester conversing with the cashier.
After they had made their way through half the sigils in the room, Gabe paused. “These are so old, and the goo… this has to be the work of leviathans.”
They watched Dean for a few more moments. He hit his head against the steering wheel and started rolling it back and forth. “Perhaps that would be best,” Cas replied.
“None taken,” Castiel responded. “It was kind of like a job. The family business and the family itself were essentially one and the same. For most of my life I never even considered the possibility of doing anything else.”
“But they’re demons. Can’t you just summon them into the privacy of your own home.”
Gabe shot up from his chair, but Anna put her hand on his arm. “He just needs some time,” she said. “Let’s try and come up with some sort of a plan, ok? So we can have some good news for him when he comes back down.”
“Maybe,” Gabe said. “I guess that would explain the soul examinations. The prophet’s soul would be marked with the Eyes of Metatron. But why would they look here? I mean, like Anna mentioned, there’s nothing on this campus that screams ‘supernatural’ per-se.”
“But why search the dorms?” Cas asked. “Surely they would get all the information they need about whether or not a student is the prophet from soul examination?”
Cas sighed. Hopefully the two of them were right and everything would be fine.
“Are you taking an audience here for some reason?”
Benny laughed. “No pressure or anything. All right, best to you then!” Benny called after Dean as he nodded his goodbye and went out to the parking lot.
"See you, Dean"
That was a new development. The names. The time before last that Dean had interviewed Cas, Gabe had been there. Thankfully he hadn’t done anything too embarrassing, like tell Dean to propose or buy him roses. He had simply walked up between the two of them while Cas was being interviewed, taken both of their hands, said “Cas, Dean,” and walked away. Cas had then clarified that his name was actually "Castiel," but asked that Dean keep that out of the paper. He preferred the actual names of his team stay unknown. While any entity who bothered to look at the pictures in the news would probably recognize Anna's red hair or realize that the only rogue archangel was Gabe, going by their aliases--- Renegade for Annael, Warrior for him, and Archangel for Gabriel--- offered at least meager protection.
“I'm talking about the fact that you’ve stopped by the bakery every day this week, ever since you heard that reporter say he likes my pie. I have to admit, he’s got good taste in food as well as men,” he said with a wink toward Castiel. Castile blushed as Gabe continued “but maybe you should come up with a better strategy for seeing your lover boy than just… waiting around here, hoping he’ll show up.”
Dean smiled and kissed him back.
>>From: Dean Winchester
“Yeah,” Dean said. “And so do you.” He looked at Cas. “I just want tonight to go well.”
“Ahhh. It’s just one date, Sammy. Probably won’t be anything to report.”
He looked sad.
There was an awkward pause where they looked at each ither. Then Dean picked his coffee up from the cnouter and hopped off his stool. "Well. I was on my way to work, so I better get going. See ya, Jimmy."
“Nah, Bobby, really! It’ll be fine. Besides, I’m still paying off hospital bills, and I’m trying to get, ya know, a less shitty apartment.”
“Cassie, what was that?” Gabe asked, again in a way that no humans could pick up on. “Scared to talk to your lover-boy?”
I feel you’d be surprised by my alcohol tolerance. You do know I grew up with Meg, right? And have you ever met my brother?
Benny and Charlie had offered to skip the party and hang with him instead, and Kevin had offered to Dean that they cancel the party altogether, but Dean had insisted they go off and have some fun. At least someone should be enjoying themselves.
Gabe raised his eyebrow, clearly waiting for a response. Cas sighed. “Ok, ok. You’re right. Let’s go,” he said. He and Anna took off.
“Whoa!” Sam said, “you’re awfully chipper this morning.”
Dean was leaning against Castiel’s arm. Cas could feel him breathing in and out as they watched the movie. They had done this many times before – sitting together, watching a movie. This time, however, felt a bit more personal. A bit more intimate. So it was killing Cas even more than usual, every time he had to tell Dean a not-quite-truth, and every time Dean called him Jimmy.
“You, uh, know him?” Dean asked.
“I was young. Sammy doesn’t even remember her. But it changed my dad. And not for the better. He quit the force to work freelance. Doing the same stuff, basically, but he was obsessed with finding her killer. Moved us all around the country looking for him.”
“Sammy, you got this. You’ve made it on your own so many times.”
Bobby nods and continues, pointing off in vague directions. “Ellen and I live in a house few hundred yards behind this cabin. Rufus and Aretha are settled down that somewhere over yonder and your mom and dad are across the lake together. Jo has been traveling around with friends for the past bit, so I don’t know where she is at.”
“Just don’t try anything, please Cas. I won’t ask nicely a second time.”
Dean carries his angel through, his eyes glistening with unfallen tears. He rushes up to the main desk where a nurse meets his eyes before dropping them to the limp body he holds. She shouts for a doctor as Dean stands shakily before her.
“Whether or not you are lonely tonight,” Cas winks at him as he grabs a pool stick, ignoring the nickname Dean gave him.
A few year later, Eileen is pregnant with their first and only child. Sam attends online school to finish his law degree and works shifts at a restaurant in town. When the baby shower is thrown, everyone who attended the funeral plus a few others come and participate. Garth’s twins are now talking and along with their sister, they continually tease Sam about the cayenne pepper. Donna and Jody shower the couple in love, although Jody offers more tough love. Within a month of the baby being born the two are married. Sam insisted on naming their son Dean.
Bobby chuckles, “Just let me finish my damn speech son then I’ll send you to your angel.”
Cas is up first, waking Dean with small bites along his collar bone and nails tracing gently up and down his back. Dean grunts, burying his face deeper into the pillow. Cas smiles and throws off the covers. He slides out of the bed and stands. Stretching slightly, he snaps his fingers. He’s clean and fully clothed again, only leaving the bruise and scratches that Dean left. Dean rolls over, rubbing his face with one hand. Sleepily he mutters, “how long have you been up Cas?”
Someone comes up to Dean, taking Cas from his trembling arms, and rushing off to a room. A herd of nurses follow, dressed in dark blue scrubs. Dean follows them in a state of shock. He mutters under his breath, “Cas, please I-… I need you.. I l-…”
Dean just nods and pulls out his keys, spinning them on his finger. Together, they walk back to the Impala. Dean unlocks the car and opens his door, sliding into the seat. Sam gets in next to him, tucking his long legs into the car. Dean turns on the car and throws it in reverse. Backing up he feels a jolt as the car hits something and he hears a thump as that something falls to the ground. “Son of a bitch!”
He trails off, his heart wrenching as he walks. He stares blankly at the door that they close in front of him. Lights flick on as they lay Cas on an operating table. Dean lets out a few heavy breaths, choking on the tears he doesn’t want to let fall.
“No.”
Sam looks down, tears streaming freely down his face. “Sammy, you go out there and you live. You hear me? You live because that means you’re fighting. If you’re not living, you’re losing and that isn’t who you are. Find Eileen and have a family. Grow old, just please keep fighting Sammy, please.” Dean’s voice cracks.
After hours of peaceable sleep, Dean starts to wake up. His eyes flutter and sun light shines on his face, illuminating every freckle and lighting up his bright green eyes. “Hello Dean. What were you dreaming about?”
The first time was when he was 14. His dad found out and somehow the silent disappointment had been worse than the punches. John had focused solely on making him more manly for the next few years, drilling it into his son’s head that he was not to like boys. From there on, Dean rarely got farther than first or second base with male hook ups cause no matter how much he tried to suppress it, he could hear his father shouting in his head.
Cas opens his eyes. His entire body tingles, grace flowing through him once more. He feels invigorated and more alive than he had in a long time. He looks around, the world around him glowing with an unearthly essence. He turns his head, letting his gaze slide over the landscape before him. His eyes snag on a man standing a few feet away by a familiar vehicle. The man’s emerald eyes shimmer with tears as he stares at Cas. Cas sobs, rushing towards his hunter. Dean wraps him up in a big hug, holding him close, his lips brushing Cas’ ear. Cas grips his flannel tight, sobbing into his chest, ignoring the fact that he is a powerful angel and not a blubbering baby. Dean holds him for what feels like years before he begins to whisper comforting words into Cas’ ear. “I missed you Cas… it’s gonna be alright… I didn’t mean to go… you shoulda stayed with Sam…” He stutters briefly, his breath hitching and his chest tensing under Cas’ cheek. “I love you,” he whispers so quietly that if Cas were not an angel, he would not have heard it.
7:16 am Thursday – Cas
Sam snorts and rubs his face sleepily, “fine, I guess we’ll stay the night here. It’s a few more hours till we get back to the bunker anyway.”
An alarm rings out, echoing throughout the room. A tanned hand reaches out, fumbling for the off button. Finding it, the hand slams down, silencing the ringing. Dean rolls over, facing the opposite wall. He stares at the khaki trench coat that hangs on a rack beside his lamp. It was one of Cas’ older ones. Cas got hurt so often they often had to buy new ones. There are still flecks of blood around the color and streaks of burns around the wrists. Dean sighs, wiping his face with his hand. He hears a yap and the bed near his feet dips. He sits up as Miracle barrels into him. He wraps his arms around the dog, pulling them close and pushing his face into the fur. “Good dog,” he mumbles.
Dean hangs up and trudges back into the room with Sam. He shoves his phone back in his pocket and scoops up the plates. He strides back into the kitchen, setting them on the counter. He rolls up his sleeves and flicks on the hot water. Soaping up the sponge, he grabs one of the plates and runs it under the tap. He scrubs the plate before rinsing it and putting it back in the dry rack. He repeats this until all the plates, pans, and utensils are clean. Turning away from the sink, he dries his hands. He wanders back to his room and passes out for a few hours.
He closes his door while opening the backseat, scooping Cas out quickly as time is of the essence. He slams the door shut and strides towards hospital’s automatic doors.
Bobby chuckles with him. Dean wipes his face, lowering the beer and setting it on top of the cooler. “Shitty but sentimental.”
Dean takes a long sip, tilting his head back so the rays of sun brush his face. He swallows, savoring the taste as he looks out at the lake before him. “This reminds me of my first beer with my dad.”
“There’s something in my back, I can’t pull away.”
Dean sputters, nearly spitting out his beer. The stranger smirks and extends his hand to the blushing Dean. “Castiel.”
Cas senses Dean’s heart rate plummet and hears doctors scurry to revive him, He freezes in the doorway, staring at Dean hooked up a bunch of machines with dried blood caking his wrists. He can’t look away, but he doesn’t want to watch. He shuts his eyes as the world shouts at him. Crumpling to the floor, he screams back, “Please don’t leave me.”
Sam chuckles sadly as he watches tears fill Dean’s eyes. Dean shakily continues, “You were so much smarter, and you never took anyone’s crap, whether Dad’s or some bullies at school. You even stood up to me. You’re so much stronger, you’ve always survived, no matter what Dad or Lucifer or Chuck threw at you.”
“Dean, why are we stopping?”
Dean looked on in somber awe. Cas was back, he was finally back. Dean wasn’t sure how, but to be completely honest with himself, he didn’t care. He had his best friend back. Blinking furiously to make sure it wasn’t just another cruel trick, he realized that it was indeed Cas leaning heavily against the table before him. “Hello Dean,” the angels gravelly voice groaned.
Cas throws back the shot, wincing slightly at the burn of the liquor. Dean chuckles and spins back around. “So, what’re you here for?”
Cas nods knowingly. “He still seems off, more than he often is. Did Eileen give him that ring?”
Dean holds up the journal. In the bottom most corner of the right page, there is a sketch of a skull face, nearly identical to the one that the officer showed them. “It’s a mime Sam.”
“Just did some research and got some sleep. Not really as exciting as yours I’m sure.”
“I love you Sam, I always will. Just like Jack, I won’t be gone. I’ll be right here.” Dean weakly taps Sam’s chest where his heart is.
Dean stares in the direction that Bobby pointed. He could see his parents again and God how he missed them. He couldn’t fathom what they would think though. Would John be mad at him for abandoning Sam? He shook his head, shaking away the terrible thoughts. This was heaven, he wouldn’t think about that. Bobby interrupts his thoughts and hands him a beer from the cooler between them.
“Where are we going Dean?”
“I told you Dean; I would wait here.”
Dean can feel his face burning. He’s horrified, angry and embarrassed but he’d never show it. He mutters through gritted teeth, “go.”
Sam looks down at him and smiles, “hey jerk.”
Dean flicks through the radio stations trying to find something good. He flies through Elvis, Taylor Swift, and Dave Matthews and continues for a few minutes. He settles on a random channel as a soft tune starts to pour out. He listens as he drives, a quiet yet rich voice pouring out of the radio. He pulls into the Gas-n-Sip parking lot at 7:16, right as the first few lines falls out.
The odd pair quickly arrived at a roadhouse off the side of the two lane. Dean pulled Baby up into one of the closest spots and turned off the engine. Cas was already sliding out of the car by the time Dean pulled out the key. Cas led the way into the old barn that had been repurposed what seemed to be decades ago. Dean followed quickly, letting the heavy wood door swing shut behind him. A few people dotted the room, sitting on bar stools, at tables, or leaning against the wall holding various beers.
Upon finding the barn that the vamp mentioned, the boys slip inside as quietly as possible. Sam hears a faint crying noise, and he points at the closet where it is coming from. Dean sees his signal and creeps forward, opening the door. Looking in, the brothers see two little boys sitting on the floor. Sam motions for them to stay quiet and then to follow him. “We’re here to save you,” he whispers.
Dean nods absentmindedly as he stares in the direction where his parents are settled. He could see his parents again and God how he missed them. He couldn’t fathom what they would think though. Would John be mad at him for abandoning Sam? He shook his head, shaking away the terrible thoughts. This was heaven, he wouldn’t think about that. Bobby interrupts his thoughts and hands him a beer from the cooler between them.
Dean takes a few antsy steps back and forth before he starts pacing up and down the hall. He brushes by a few nurses, mindlessly walking as he tries to erase the bad thoughts. He scratches at the blood drying on his hands as he paces.
Cas smiles and pulls away and Dean wipes his face off, erasing the tears. Cas cups his face gently with his hands and pulls him in so their foreheads touch. Cas snaps his fingers, and the radio starts playing at a gentle volume. Cas grabs Dean by the waist and takes his hand. Together they sway back and forth before Cas slowly starts to sweep Dean along.
Dean paused his humming and squinted at Cas. “What ring? They didn’t get engaged did they? Sammy would have told me.”
“You can let me up now Dean.”
Sam’s voice rises in confidence, “You heard me Cas. Jack will need your help, hell, he’s your son.” His voice sinks to a whisper once more as if he is afraid someone who is no longer there will here him, “I know how you felt about my brother. The two of you need each other more than I need you. Give him my best and take care of him Castiel. Please, promise me that.”
Dean follows along, placing his hand on Cas’ shoulder and gripping his hand tight with his other.
Dean snorts, “thanks man. Anyways, what did I win?”
Cas leans in, gently kissing Dean’s collarbone. Dean shivers beneath him. He feels Cas’ lips brush against his skin as he smiles. Cas works his way up Dean’s collar, pausing each time Dean shivers. Cas plants a kiss at the base of Dean’s throat. Dean groans as he does so, feeling his pants grow tighter. Cas smiles, pulling away from Dean and pulling off his trench coat and hanging it on the hook besides Dean’s head. He steps back, fully unknotting his tie and throwing it on the bedside table. Dean shrugs off his flannel, hanging it beside the trench coat.
“I don’t think I’m going anywhere anytime soon.”
“GO CAS.”
“I told you Sam, I met him briefly in the bar.”
Sam reaches around and shakes his hand, “Sam.”
As soon as the words leave her lips, she is decapitated. Sam had gotten up quietly and swung as hard as he could. Her head tumbles down across the floor. One of the vamps releases Dean’s arm and as he rises to attack Sam, he meets the same fate as Jenny. Dean shoves the last vamp back and hops up. Dean swings, his fit connecting with the monsters’ jaw. The vamp manages to woozily grab Dean’s arm and spin him around. With the force of multiple men, Dean is shoved back. He feels something penetrate his lower back. Sam finishes off the last vampire and turns to Dean. “C’mon we have to find those kids.”
The two brothers brandish their machetes. The vampires charge them, and the fight begins. One body drops to the floor, headless. Another falls, its head rolling across the dirty floor. A third vamp knocks the machete from Sam’s hand and decks him with a right hook. Sam falls back, his head cracking against the floorboards. Dean is overpowered by two who wrestle him to the floor, his machete held uselessly in his right hand. The vamp that knocked Sam over pulls off its mask. “Ah, hello Dean.”
The officer picks up a notebook from the porch. “The mom sketched this, that’s it.”
Dean chokes on his pie. He lowers his fork and swallows hard. His voice cracks nearly imperceptibly as he speaks. “I’m not sure we can bring him back. He made a deal, and we don’t even know if Jack has sway with the Empty. I don’t think I can get him back and I don’t really want to focus on that thought. He sacrificed himself and I’m not letting that go to waste so stop being a freakin’ Eeyore dude.”
Dean reaches out, grabbing Sam’s coat, tugging him closer. “Look at me Sammy. I am so proud of you. You have to know that. I have always looked up to you, and not just because you’re taller than me.”
Dean closes his eyes after he parks, imaging his brother. One of the two things he can’t live without. The image of Sam fades and Cas steals his way into his mind. Dean sighs, memories of the angel flashing in the dark as the lyric wash over him. He turns the car off and rubs his face, vigorously wiping the memories away. He pulls out the keys and hops out of the car, striding towards the door. The lights are on, but no one walks around inside. He tugs at the handle, frowning down at it as it refuses to budge. He glances back up, his eyebrows knit as he scans the sign on the door. The store doesn’t open until 7:30. Dean shakes his head and walks back to the Impala, perching on the hood gently as he waits.
A nurse lightly grabs Dean’s arm, pulling him along to a seat near the door. Dean sits wearily, the dried blood on his knees flaking off onto the floor. He puts his head in his bloody hands, disrupting and smoothing his hair. He sits for hours, repeating the action until his arms are as numb as his mind. Tears lightly paint his face, glistening in the fluorescent lights.
Dean wipes his face and walks back around the car. He opens the door and slides in. He turns the key and Baby purrs. With one hand he steers, the other he grasps Cas’ hand tightly. He would never lose his angel again, they had forever, and Dean would make sure of it. They drive down the road, hand in hand in silence. Eventually Dean checks the rear-view mirror and sees a woman sitting in the back seat. He smiles at her sadly and keeps driving.
“What?”
Dean lets out a massive sigh that is overwhelmed by a sob. He chokes down more tears and drops back into his seat. He leans his head back, finally letting his agitated mind relax.
Sam looks at him confusedly and opens his mouth to say something, but Dean gives him a quick look. Sam closes his mouth and looks back out the window. “Do you know him Dean?”
Bobby chuckles with him. Dean wipes his face, lowering the beer and setting it on top of the cooler. “Shitty but sentimental.”
“Right. Well, I think I am going to lay back down.”
Sam opens the back door and climbs in behind the drivers’ seat. He sees Cas in the passenger seat, his hand out of sight but angled towards Dean. Sam turns to the other occupant of the back seat. Eileen stares back at him with overflowing eyes. “I love you Sam.”
Dean slides it back into his pocket and looks at the man that Cas left slumped in the alley. He seems to be fine and it is nowhere near cold enough to hurt the man, so Dean walks away. He heads to the diner in silence.
Bobby smiles and nods. “Where is he Bobby? I need to see him.” Dean’s voice breaks more as he tries to hold back tears.
Dean felt his heart jump as he stumbled over to Cas, overwhelmed with conflicting emotions. He grabbed Cas and yanked him to his chest, burying his chin into the worn trench coat Cas always wore. Cas tentatively returned the hug, before collapsing into his embrace. Dean gripped him tighter, determined to never lose his angel again. Dean felt tears start to silently slide down his cheeks. They clung to each other until Dean heard the heavy steps that signaled Sam and Jack were walking the hall together.
The bartender wanders back over, and Cas orders a shot of whiskey. He drums his fingers on the wood counter as he waits. Dean spins around, facing the rest of the restaurant. His eyes sweep back and forth as he regains his composure. It’s not often someone, especially a guy catches him this off guard. The last time he was this flustered was decades ago. A few people come up to Cas, whispering about future meetings. Each time, the man gives them an awkward greeting before nervously getting down to business. Cas mutters times back to them and they wander away looking somewhat satisfied.
Dean closes his laptop after jotting down an address on a post it note. He stands, shoving it into his back pocket along with his phone. He had spent the last half hour tracking down exactly where Cas had gone after he left the bunker. Dean still felt bad about that, but he needed Sam back, even if that meant sending his best friend away for a little bit. He rubs his eyes as he walks to the garage, keys held gently in his other hand. He unlocks the door to Baby, swinging it open and sliding in. He turns it on, stepping on the gas and driving off. He shovels his hand into his pocket, pulling out the note and holding it between his fingers as they rest on the wheel. He grits his teeth and sets off towards his angel.
A watery smile sits dully on his lips as his breathing slows. He squeezes Sam’s hand until he loses the strength. Sam holds him up as the life seeps out of his brothers’ body. Weakly Dean reaches up and pulls Sam’s head towards him, so their foreheads are touching. “Me and you. Goodbye Sammy.”
Cas takes one step inside the hospital and all the eyes immediately latch onto him. A nurse gasps and runs for a doctor while another guides Cas down a hall. One of the nurses take Dean from Cas, whisking him away. Someone comes to Cas, asking him what happened. Cas sways, dazed as he focuses on the faint beat of Dean’s heart coming from the other room. He manages to mumble out “wrists… blood everywhere.”
Dean looks at him confused and sits in the chair by his side. Bobby leans back and looks at Dean. “We don’t just live out our golden oldies. When your kid got up here he changed a lot.”
“Bobby? This isn’t one of my memories, what the hell is going on?”
Cas slides down the wall, gripping the knife tight as he does so. His trench coat scrunches around his waist as he sits. His feet slide across the floor, squeaking gently. He flicks the knife open, staring at his wrists intently as a mellow voice drifts through the door to him. He feels tears start budding in the corners of his eyes as his mind latches on to the lyrics
His voice is smoky, smooth in way that pulls you in, but it has enough gravelly undertones to catch you off guard. Dean chuckles, “and why’s that?”
He screams with every fiber of his being, begging Jack to steal him away all while once again wholly devoting himself to Humanity. Sam flinches at the raw pain clawing it’s way out of Cas’ throat and into the night sky. He knows for sure that Cas would do anything for Dean. It was no longer Sam’s responsibility to watch over his older brother. With a sudden and bright flash of golden light, Cas was enveloped and disappeared from sight. Sam had to look away, his eyes burning and every atom in his body aching. When he turns back around, Cas is gone. He is left with no trace of the angel nor his brother.
Dean nods shakily in agreement with Bobby’s words and looks over to the gravel lot beside the cabin. Baby sits in the lot, original plates, and all. Dean stands, reaching his hand into his pocket like he had done so many times when he was alive. He pulls out the keys, spinning them around his finger as he hops off the porch, his shoes crunching in the gravel. He runs his hand over the exterior as he walks up to the driver’s side. He opens the door and slides in, settling into the familiar seat. He puts in the key and turns the car on. It roars and then settles into its familiar gruff purr. “Hey, Baby.”
Cas is opening up the little Gas-n-Sip, making his way through the aisles slowly. He checks the door, making sure it is still locked. Sighing, he walks back to the counter, grabbing a cheap knife from one of the stands. He twirls it in his hands, staring at it curiously. He frowns at the knife and then at his wrists, twirling the knife faster. He’s put off by its weight, but it will make do. He turns his head to the left, checking the lock once more. It’s another fifteen or so minutes before the gas station opens, just enough time to do what he needs to do. He wishes he didn’t have to do it here, but he’s done and has no where else to do it. He shuffles into the station’s bathroom, keeping his eyes on the ground. He closes and locks the door as a gentle song starts playing over the Gas-n-Sips station’s radio.
Only once they had gotten in the Impala did Dean dare to glance at Cas. Cas lounged in the passenger seat, loose enough to show he felt safe but rigid enough to show he was guarded against something. Dean could only hope he wasn’t guarding himself against Dean. They sat in silence for a few moments before Dean turned on the radio. Too distracted to actually change the channel, he let the smooth voice of Elvis float out of the speakers.
Dean sighs and calls Sam back as he walks out the door. “Hey dude, where are you.”
“Guess you’ll have to play and see,” Cas chuckles as he sets up the balls in the rack.
Dean snorts at the comment and sits up, running his hands through his hair. Cas stares at him, watching the thin beams of lights coming through the curtains illuminate the man in his bed. Cas rarely took people back with him, especially if they hadn’t made a deal.
Dean nods and lines up the ball. With a swift thrust of the stick, the balls disperse with comforting clacking noises. The solid red 7 drops into the one pouch. Cas nods and the two play. Dean’s phone buzzes in the middle of the game and he pauses while Cas takes his turn. Sam has texted him a room number and the hotel name,
The Empty whips its head around, staring at the intruder. Cas blearily lifts his head, convinced this is just another form of torture. His eye catches on a little white coat clad kid, staring at Cas and the Empty with their head cocked and eyebrows scrunched. The kids’ hand is raised in a frozen wave as he stares back. Cas props himself up gently yet painfully on his elbow, analyzing the figure before him, his mouth open ajar. As it stands above Cas, the Empty clenches its fist, causing Cas’ airways to be squeezed shut. “Jack…” he chokes out between labored breaths.
11:37 am Thursday – Dean
“What?”
“Then I’ll choose for you… go.”
Sam plants his hands on the hood of the car and watches as Dean pages through the aged journal. “In 1986 or something, there was a case that Dad looked into. The witness drew this.”
“Dean, what are we going to do after we load him up?”
Cas chuckles and rubs his thumb lightly against Dean’s shoulder. The sun sets slowly, a final ray illuminating the two. Cas glows, his hair on fire like a halo. Dean stares at him with eyes full of satisfied love. Dean pulls him close and together with Cas’ head resting on his chest, they dance through their worst memories, knowing nothing can part them. Dean remembers when the Empty took Cas and when Lucifer killed him.
Cas drops to his knees, pulling out the paint brush and filling in the scratch, restoring the devil’s trap. Sam stares down at him, a confused look stealing across his face. Cas stands back up, dusting off the knees of his suit pants. He hands the paint can back to a stunned Sam. Dean turns and looks at him smiling. “See? He’s not that bad. Besides, he’s like my Ruby.”
Sam sobs, tears flowing faster as Dean’s hand drops, and his head falls back against the wood beam behind him. His eyes drift off of Sam, barely focusing on something over his shoulder behind him. Dean sees a little dorky man in a trench coat, his rich blue eyes brimming with tears. His mouth goes to form the word, but his body gives out before he can. He breathes his last and falls against Sam gently. Dean dies in his brother’s arms, with his angel’s name on his lips.
Cas looks up at him with weary gratitude, letting a tired smile show. “Indeed, he does.”
. Dean stands up and shoves the delivery box in a nearby trashcan. He pulls out his keys, shaking them lightly. “Well c’mon Sammy, let’s check this out.”
Cas fades in and out. He hears the door crunch as it is kicked repeatedly. He feels rough fabric wrapped around his wrists before he is tugged to his feet and then scooped up. Cas can faintly smell Dean, sweat and beer invading his nose. He feels himself shoved into the Impala; the faint leather smell mixed with the harsh metallic scent of his own blood. He hears the song play as Dean seemingly screams along with it, choked on his emotions.
Dean scoffs and pops open the fridge, snatching up the butter. He walks out of the kitchen and winds his way to the main table. Sitting down, he pulls his computer over and opens it. As it starts up he slathers butter on his toast. He takes a big bite as he punches in the password. He opens up google and checks the digital newspaper for the nearby town.
“Hmm, not sure where he got it then,” Dean muttered, ignoring the angel’s awkward phrasing.
“What?”
Sam sighs and looks around before grabbing the guy by the ankles. Dean circles back around and shoves his hands under Cas’ armpits. Together they lift Cas and slide him into the back seat. “You sure we shouldn’t call 911?”
In less than five minutes, Dean has pulled up in front of the emergency room, the tires leaving skid marks as he brakes. He hops out, grabbing the keys and shoving them quickly in his pocket.
Sam shakes his head, his vision blurred by tears. Dean breathes shallowly and sucks in shaky breaths. “Sammy, tell me it’s okay. Please. I need to know it’s okay.”
Sam steps back to Dean. “Dude, what are you talking about.”
He noticed Cas was having a bit of trouble, so he wrapped his hand around the angel’s, guiding it into a better position. He slowly pulled back as Cas took his shot, the cue ball banging into a striped 10 and knocking it into a pocket. Cas grinned and lined up for another shot, this time copying what Dean had showed him. Dean stared at him, amazed that such a perfect being could love him.
“Jenny. You tried to kill me over a decade again Dean. Now I’m going to take the pleasure of killing you and your brother.”
Dean looks at him confused and sits in the chair by his side. Bobby leans back and looks at Dean. “We don’t just live out our golden oldies. When your kid got up here he changed a lot.”
Sam whispers to him, his voice cracking, “Cas, you have to choose.”
Dean shovels some pie into his mouth, nodding slowly. “Uh, speaking of the incident… Have you thought about how to get Cas back?”
Dean slides out of the Impala as Sam swings his door open. Sam shakes his head as he looks around at the small pie fest. Dean stares in awe at the handful of people walking around with plates filled with varying flavors of pie. Sam wanders over to one of the benches and sits down, pulling out his phone. Dean rushes over to one of the pie stands. When he comes back to Sam he has a large delivery box with five or six different slices of pie inside. Sam looks up from his texts and chuckles. “That’s so much pie dude.”
Dean’s hand found the angel’s where it rested against the warm metal. Cas turned to his human, his breath hitching and his voice wavering into silence as Dean started singing.
Cas had made him beg, something he never did. God, Dean had wanted him so bad and Cas made him wait, kept him in suspense. Every kiss, every thrust, every bite only made him want more. Cas had sent him to heaven and then dragged him back down to earth. For once, Dean didn’t really want it to just be a one-night stand. He opens his eyes and begins dressing.
Dean stares at him, the song he has on repeat in his head stuttering to a halt. Tears build in the corners of his eyes and his sinuses fill with pressure. He lets out a choked sob, dropping his head into his hands. He lets it all out, tears flooding down his face as the doctor walks away. He weeps as his mind is consumed by blame. He knows this only happened because he kicked Cas out. He sits there and cries, mourning his angel and his best friend.
She jots it down and starts to walk off.
“You heard me Cas. I’m pissed but if Sam finds you, he’ll kill you.”
The bartender nods and walks off. Dean runs his hands through his hair, fluffing it up as he waits. He stares mindlessly at the wall as he does so, barely noticing as the person beside him is replaced by someone else. Only when he hears the man beside him mutter does he let his eyes drift from where they were burning holes into the wall. The man next to him slouches a bit onto the bar, resting his left forearm on the counter while the other loosens the blue tie around his neck. A dark obsidian coat is draped over the man’s left arm. He looks over at Dean, still tugging at the knot at his throat. He flashes Dean a wide, toothy grin before glancing away.
“Bobby? This isn’t one of my memories, what the hell is going on?”
Cas lets out a gentle whimper. No matter how many times the Empty used this technique, he still felt sharp pains shoot through his heart as Dean’s tear stained face stares at him, confused. Their last interaction is burned into Cas’ memory and the Empty only makes it ache. He had confessed to Dean, both making his spirits soar and his world crumble. The Empty gives him a little pout, fake concern flashing through its eyes, almost looking sincere enough to convince Cas that Dean had come for him. It kneeled beside him, caressing Cas’ face lightly. Cas lets out a whispery sigh before he jerks his head away. The Empty’s eyes flash, a midnight black invading the normally brilliant green. Its arm reels back, preparing to deliver a blow when a small voice chirps out into the void, “hello.”
. He slides his phone back into his pocket and takes his turn. “Who was that Dean?”
“Just help me get him in the car Sam.”
Together they sit in the Impala off the side of the road watching. A three-story, white house towers above them. Right when they are about to nod off from exhaustion, a black van pulls up in front of the house. They both sit up a bit straighter, readying their machetes. They see two vampires, clad in black clothing head to toe, and wearing tacky skull masks. The brothers open the Impala’s doors and gently push them shut. Dean sneaks towards the front of the van while Sam goes around back.
Bobby smiles and is silent for a moment, rocking his chair back and forth gently as he drinks his beer. “You know, your kid had some help from Cas.”
Stepping out of the bathroom, he looks around. His eyes catch on the paper on the bed. Walking over, he picks it up and looks down on it.
Bobby smiles, rocking his chair back and forth gently as he drinks his beer. “You know, your kid had some help from Cas.”
Cas looks around the room bored. The white walls no longer provide the same comfort that used to. Earth was much more ideal now with its luscious forests and interesting wildlife. He would much rather be helping out the Winchesters. Even they were less annoying than the angel before him babbling on about what they were to do next.
Cas feels like a heavy weight has been lifted from his chest as he hears those three most important words. He hugs Dean tighter, tears filling his eyes. They just stand together, swaying back and forth gently like the trees around them. Cas is the first to pull away. “We have a few more stops Dean.”
“Hold up Sam.”
Dean leans over and looks at his phone. A news article reads
The bartender dropped the El Sol off in front of Dean who was now side eyeing the stranger. “You’re lucky this isn’t a strip club,” the stranger says in a low voice.
Dean chuckles and takes a sip of his coffee. Spotting Cas walking by across the road, he turns away from the window. He now focuses on the diner’s décor. After a few minutes their food is brought to them and a half hour later they are walking out the door. “We should get a move on Dean.”
Sam steps out and goes inside, closing the door behind him. Dean sighs, looking into the rear-view mirror at Cas. He’s laying there peacefully, his blue eyes closed. Dean opens the door and climbs out, opening the door to the back seat. Cas does not stir so Dean places a hand on his hip and shakes him gently. “C’mon Cas.”
Sam raises his eyebrow and stares at Dean. Sam knew he had a very intimate relationship with Ruby, so it caught him off guard that Dean compared this Cas fellow to her. Sam looks back at Cas and his eyes catch on the bruises that dot the area along his collar. His jaw drops and his forehead wrinkles as he realizes what Dean meant. Cas gives him a sly smile from over Dean’s shoulder. Dean’s face flushes and he looks away. “He’s staying with us Sam, he’ll be helpful.”
Forty or so years after Dean’s death, Sam lays in a hospital bed in his home. Eileen had passed away a year or two ago from pneumonia. Dean was now a full-grown adult just like Garth’s kids. Sam makes a mental list of who all will come to his inevitable funeral. Jody became housebound due to old age and Alex now took care of her so they probably won’t come. Charlie and Stevie are all about his age and Kaia and Claire are most likely to show. Sam sighs, almost choking on his respirator. His lungs were failing, and his body was shutting down. Dean leans over him, grasping his frail hand. Dean echoes the very same words that Sam had said nearly four decades ago. “It’s okay dad, you can go.”
Sam chimes in, “I’ll just have a side of hash browns.”
“What’re we playing for Cas?”
Dean pulled away, letting out a weary but satisfied sigh, before wiping his face. Cas squinted at him, tilting his head ever so slightly, in a way that would be invisible to anyone who didn’t know his mannerisms. Dean shook his head nearly imperceptibly as Sam and Jack walked in. Their heads were down cast and there was a tiredness that shaped their posture. Only when they noticed Cas did they perk up. Sam faltered and stared, mouth agape in stunned awe. Jack wore a smile that reached his eyes.  Cas lurched towards him, scooping his son up in bear hug. Jack squeaked and returned the hug with a fierceness he hadn’t shown in a while.
Cas lurches up, a fist swinging towards Dean’s general direction. Dean grabs his wrists, pushing him back down into the seat. “Woah, easy there tiger.”
“Finally, Dean, I thought you had bailed on me.”
Dean just snorts and opens the menu. Looking up, he sees Sam looking at him, occasionally giving him a once over. Sam notices Dean staring and chuckles, “she really did a number on you dude.”
He can’t tell if this is another trick or not, so he lets his head thud back down against the floor. He closes his eyes, clenching them wearily, waiting for the vise in his throat to fade and the Empty to move on to a somewhat less painful method of torture. Of all the people that the Empty had used to trick and hurt him, Jack was one of the most painful. Cas hears faint footsteps, pacing closer as the Empty hisses out, “you!”
Dean smiles, turning down the music. “So uh, how’d the two of you meet?”
The three occupants of the Impala continue their silent journey down the long winding forest road. In the distance, a gas station sign rises about some low-cut trees. Dean can see someone leaning against one of the signposts. Upon driving closer, he sees Sam propped up against the sign watching the road. The car slows and Dean rolls down his window. “Hey bitch.”
He hides his face in his hands, weeping over the corpse of his best friend, his brother, the love of his life. Cas feels a rough hand settle on his shoulder, and he lets out a lighter sob as his cries subside. He turns around, expecting Jack to be behind him. He is surprised when a faded silhouette stares back at him. His jaw drops and he lets out a sharp exhale. A washed-out Dean stares back at him, a wispy hand on his shoulder. Cas sobs, embracing the ghostly figure and crying into its shoulder. People brush by Castiel and his ghost as the paramedics pack up and leave, whisking away Dean’s body.
They all stand and watch as Dean’s body is set on top of the pyre. Garth is visibly upset, and Jody is crying as they walk away. Claire clings to Kaia, crying as Alex and Patience huddle together. Charlie and Stevie hold hands, willing each other to be strong. Donna wraps Jody in a hug when she gets back to the outskirts of the clearing. Eileen hugs Sam and squeezes his hand before he unwraps himself. Readying himself with a deep breath, Sam makes his way to the center of the clearing, Miracle trudging behind him solemnly, as if aware of the gravity of the situation.
Dean stumbles over to him, grasping the front of his coat and pulling him close. He wraps his arms around the angel, burying his face in his shoulder. Cas warily hugs him back, slowly gripping him tighter. Cas feels tears soak through his shirt as tears roll down Dean’s face. Dean mumbles into his shoulder, “I should’ve told you earlier Cas. I… I love you too Cas.”
With a snap of Jack’s fingers, a door opens in the void, bright light shining at the other end. The shining frame envelopes them, whisking them from the dark wasteland and to a field. Cas melts into their arms, letting himself savor this small second of solace as he hugs his child. Slowly they release each other, turning slowly to face an old barn, flashing lights bouncing off the walls as emergency vehicles stand parked before them. The humans were packing up, a stretcher with a large shape on it being shoved into the back of an ambulance. Cas watches as a tall figure lumbers out of the shadows, their back slumped and their head downcast. With a jolt, Cas recognized the crestfallen human to be Sam. Eagerly, he looks around for Dean, nervous to see him, but hopeful.
Song: The Night We Met by Lord Huron
He launches off of the hood, gripping his phone tight. He runs forward, shoving by the girl as she goes to close the door. She shouts at him, but he doesn’t hear her as the previously quiet song grows louder in his head. He looks around the store quickly before shouting into the phone. He hears the faint sound of his voice echo back and his eyes dart to the men’s bathroom. He quickly strides to the door, knocking heavily. With no reply, he gives the handle a quick twist, frowning when it doesn’t turn.
Dean looks at him in awe. “He really did that?”
“I’ll meet you at the diner next to the bar in a few minutes.”
“My brother, we came into town together. He texted me the motel room if I decide to not spend the night with someone here.”
Dean was dumbfounded. Never in his life had someone been this forward yet so awkward. He smiles a bit, “I think I’ll take you up on that offer.”
Sam scrunches his forehead at the comment but doesn’t say anything. The waitress returns with a mug and a pot of coffee. She pours him a cup while he finishes figuring out what he wants. “The combo 2 with bacon, eggs scrambled.”
“For me? Home. For you? Well that depends.”
Dean pulled off at a little picnic area by the road. He hopped out of the car, sitting on the hood of the Impala, watching the sun lower. Cas stared through the wind shield at Dean’s back questioningly. Finally, he opened the door and got out, joining Dean on the hood. Dean was humming again. Cas started singing along, adding a rough but comforting layer to the simple tune.
The vampire squirms looking slightly nervous and scared. He nods his head to the right. “There’s a barn a few hundred feet that way. They’re in there.”
“Who are you talking to Sammy?”
As he walks by the door again, he sees a doctor grab Cas’ shoulders and lower his head to his chest.
“Where are we going? Shouldn’t we be taking the unconscious guy in our back seat to the hospital?”
When he turns around, he sees Cas in the middle of unbuttoning his vest. He steps up to him, grabbing his hands. Cas looks up at Dean as he releases his hands and finishes unbuttoning Cas’ vest. Dean pushes the vest off of his shoulders, grabbing it in one hand and tossing it onto the floor. His fingers start unbuttoning Cas’ shirt, starting at his throat, and moving down. Cas, growing impatient, pulls Dean’s hands away and quickly undoes the rest of his buttons. He tosses it into the corner on top of his vest. Dean pulls his t-shirt over his head, throwing into the corner.
“Not very long.”
“Whatever you say Dean.”
Sam gives him a look but does as he is told. Dean slides back into the driver’s seat and restarts the car. He checks behind him, making sure no one else is walking behind the car. As he turns around, his eyes catch on Cas laying peacefully in the back seat and he smiles a bit. He turns back around and proceeds to back up and drive off. Sam only looks up from his phone when he realizes they are leaving the town. “Uh Dean?”
“Right.”
Dean chokes on his beer as he whips his head back to Bobby. His voice cracks as he speaks, “Cas?”
Dean snorts at him and catches the bread as it pops out of the toaster. “Son of a bitch that’s hot!”
Cas stares at the ground, mentally begging it to swallow him and never let go. Maybe staying in the Empty would have been better because none of it was real. Cas had seen Dean die hundreds of times, whether by his own hands with Naomi or through the several manifestations of the Empty. Still, this hurt so much more. This was permanent and Cas felt that in whatever poor excuse he had for a soul that Dean was never coming back, at least not to life. More tears spilled forth from his eyes, blurring his vision. Heavy sobs shake his entire body as he kneels on the cold dirt floor. He doesn’t answer Sam, he can’t answer him because for once in his long life, he isn’t sure what to do. Should he stay with Sammy and watch out for him until his time is up and he gets to see Dean at the end of his mortal life? Or should he cut the time in half and see the love of his life as fast as possible?
“Alright, now you’re going to tell us where those kids are.”
“Doesn’t have to be a memory son.”
He looks down and sees Cas standing on the edge of a carpet that they left in front of the entrance to the garage. Dean chuckles and walks back to Cas and kneels before him. He picks up the corner of the rug and pulls out his knife, flicking it open. He scratches away the red paint, breaking the devil’s trap. “There you go Cas. I forgot you can’t walk through these.”
Dean stood up, “I’m going to use your shower before I go.”
“The father was murdered, and all the blood was drained from his body. The mother was left alive though they cut out her tongue.”
Cas grumbles and steps out of the circle. “Hand me the red paint on the table would you Cas?”
Disbelief and anger war in Dean’s head and it seems Cas can see it in his eyes. “I’m going to release you, don’t try anything.”
Sam points at his own neck. Dean rubs his hand over the places Sam pointed out and winces. “Yeah, I guess they really did.”
Dean sits on the bed, wrapping his hand around Cas’ neck, pulling him down. Dean leans back, laying on the bed as Cas bends over him. Cas kisses him while placing his hands on his hips. Cas tastes like whiskey and fire. His stubble scratches Dean’s face as they kisses. Cas pulls away, beginning to place kisses down his body. He starts at Dean’s throat, working his way to his collar bone, and then across his chest. As he drops light kisses down Dean’s ribcage, Dean arches his back. Cas holds him down as he lets his lips ghost over Dean’s hips, right along the top of his jeans. Dean squirms, letting out a little gasp.
Dean stares at the man’s broad back as he weaves his way through crowded bar, muttering apologies and “excuse me” as he does so. Dean throws back the rest of his beer and follows Cas.
“I met him last night at the bar briefly.”
Cas clenches his jaw and wraps his trench coat around himself tighter. Giving Dean a terse nod, he walks out of the alley way. Dean watches him go, longing for something he shouldn’t want for so many reasons. His phones buzzes in his pocket, jolting him from his racing thoughts. He pulls it out, yet another text from Sam.
------
Sam is back at the bunker. Dean’s body sits wrapped in a sheet in the morgue drawer. Sam calls up everyone that is still alive that might want to come to the hunter’s funeral. Jody sobs when he breaks the news, and he can hear the girls crying in the background when Jody tells them. Garth stays silent for a moment but replies with a tired and broken voice. Stevie has to take the phone from Charlie who froze at the news. Eileen was the first to know, Sam having texted her as soon as he got in the car. Donna simply let out a little “oh” and hung up as soon as Sam gave her the details.
After a few minutes of hugging the dog he pushes Miracle away and climbs out of bed. He stretches, taking another glance at the trench coat before he walks out, Miracle at his heels. He walks into the kitchen where Sam is cooking breakfast, hair slick with sweat from his run. He walks over to the toaster and checks the time on it. “It’s hot Dean.”
Sam lets out a shaky breath and bows his head slightly. He looks up, his eyes filled with tears. Dean stares up at him, a look in his eye that Sam rarely saw, fear mixed with need. Through sobs, Sam makes out the words. “It’s okay Dean. You can go.”
The man in the back seat lets out another groan and struggles to sit up. He holds his head in his hands, blinking slowly. “C’mon man, I know you can talk.”
Cas snorts at the statement. “What’s so funny,” Sam asks, turning around to face Cas.”
Seeing the odd look Dean gives him, he gives more context. “Family name, my parents were an odd pair.”
Cas’ mind wanders to the eldest Winchester. He was intriguing but he was unavailable in so many ways. With his current mission with the angels, he couldn’t become more familiar with Dean. His mind drifts as he ignores what is being said. He instead focuses on the sparkle that dances in Dean’s rich green eyes and the way he smiles, his lips slowly dragging upwards.
Sam shoves his hands in his pockets. “Any leads?”
The person stares at Cas for a second then rushes off to talk to the doctors. Cas rubs his face roughly and starts pacing, continuing to listen to all the thoughts in his head.
Dean takes a long sip, tilting his head back so the rays of sun brush his face. He swallows, savoring the taste as he looks out at the lake before him. “This reminds me of my first beer with my dad.”
Sam doesn’t reply so Dean slips his phone into his back pocket. He picks up the pace to keep up with the man in front of him. They walk in silence to the motel down the street before stopping at room 203. Cas punches in a code and flings the door open. Dean followed him nervously, it had been a years since he had done anything with a guy.
Jody chuckles into the speaker. “We would Dean, but I still have work as does Alex and Patience. Claire is somewhere with Kaia hunting.”
Dean continues to stare, unable to tear his eyes away, unable to walk away. He watches as Cas pulls away, letting the person he was holding slump to the ground. Cas wipes his mouth and turns to leave the alley. As he does so, his eyes flash and a large shadow in the shape of wings is cast behind him. Cas looks at Dean. Dean sees the black eyes flick away and the shadow fade as Cas stops. “Son of a bitch,” Dean whispers.
Cas goes to take a step and finds himself unable to. “Dean.”
Sam nods, “thank you officer, we’ll let you know if we have any more questions.”
Dean blushes and grabs his own pools stick, rubbing some chalk on the tip. “You go ahead and start us off Dean.”
Dean opens his eyes. He feels no pain and the rebar that had pierced him was gone. He looks around wildly for Sam. All he sees is bright sunshine and mountains rising up before him. He looks around confused at the scenery. It shouldn’t be this beautiful, his whole life had just crumbled. He left behind Sam and he couldn’t protect him anymore. Cas was gone, and he was stuck in a block of heaven living out memories that he knew would hurt more than heal. He stumbles back a bit and mumbles sadly. “At least I made it to heaven.”
Cas lets out a shaky sob, his blurred vision lazily drifting back to the stars. His voice starts as a mere whisper then grows with each word until he is shouting into the darkness. “I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise.”
Dean can feel the life leaking out of him and oozing onto the floor. He is numb and his mind races through near empty thoughts.
Sam smiles and squeezes his shoulder slightly. “Hello Dean.”
Cas stood there awkwardly in the entrance until Dean gave his trench coat a little tug. He guided Cas to a two-person table in the corner by the pool table. Signaling a passing waitress for two beers, Dean inserted a few coins in the pool table. He breathed a pleased sigh as he heard the clinking of the balls knocking against each other. He set them up in their triangle, removing the rack and grabbing the white cue ball.
Cas sobs, whispering it back over and over again as he clings to his Humanity. Dean starts crying too, holding him tighter as tears drip down into Cas’ thick brown hair. Jack watches from afar, content to leave their dads in a pocket of peace for a while longer. The two cry in near silence, just an angel and his hunter.
Dean’s head shot up, and he stared at his husband’s eyes. Would there ever be a time he grew accustomed to the feeling of belonging he experienced every time he looked at them? Unable to find the right words to describe the emotions crushing him, he did the one thing he knew – taking action. Climbing onto Cas’ lap, Dean’s hand’s buried into his husband’s hair and covered his mouth with his own.
“Cas?” Dean sounded confused, but Castiel still didn’t react. Everything blurred in front of his eyes.
Once again, they were crowded by their friends and family. At least a few of them told them they had never expected them to be more than friends. But all were happy for them. With every word of encouragement Dean’s still simmering fear became smaller though he knew it never would be extinguished completely. He could live with that, finally aware that his weird extended family supported him. He wasn’t alone anymore.
Although Claire didn’t know if the cuffs would work on the witch she was quite confident, especially since she now was making it clear that she was aiming a gun at her target; a gun that was still carefully hidden in Claire’s jacket pocket from the outside world. If not more, at least the cuffs had worked as a distraction. With a sigh the witch sat back and surrendered for now.
Dean could feel tears welling up in his eyes but he wouldn’t give in. He would not give in, and still a single tear escaped. There would be time to get teary eyed later when he was on his own. “Either I actually was in Heaven, though I doubt that, or I just had the weirdest nightmare ever.”
They fit perfectly together as if they’d done this for years. Nothing of this moment felt sexual. This went somewhere on a far deeper level. Dean should be freaked out, usually he would, but this was Cas and it felt as if it was meant to be. Look at what a frigging sap he had become. Right now, Dean didn’t even mind. There would come a time he would have to think about it all. For now, he just let the moment take him. All he knew was that it felt right, as if something he hadn’t even known had been missing. It completed him and settled his heart in a way completely foreign.
“Cas, did you find him? Get this...” Sam looked at Castiel, before his glance shifted over to Dean, and back to Castiel. “Oh ... My bad. I’ll be in the library, in case you’re looking for me, which I doubt. Just remember, there’s a rugaru on the loose.” And with that, the younger Winchester was gone.
*****
However, taking care of Sammy was only part of his current fucked up situation. Every time Cas only hinted at hunting alone, flashes of a pair of black wings burned into the soil beneath him passed in front of his eyes and he started to feel the panic rising through his whole body again. The flames of Cas’ pyre never stopped hunting him. Dean took a deep breath to steady his nerves.
*****
The moment the words of the prayer hit him, Castiel was yanked back into the Empty. His eyes flew open and he awoke struggling, trying everything to reach Dean. He needed to save him. Dean was dying and he had to help. Yet he was unable to move, still bound by the Shadow’s clutch.
Bobby might have been a point, but
“Cas, stop it! I’m perfectly fine.” This argument was getting ridiculous.
And then suddenly, they were married. The first kiss they shared as newly wedded husbands was incredible, yet far too short and a mutual promise for later. Everyone rushed towards them to be the first one to congratulate them.
But Donna wouldn’t give in. “Dean?”
The righteous man. He could already see him. There, right in front of him.
“Not me. Never met her.” Claire shrugged.
“See, you are perfect for each other.” Sam bumped friendly against Castiel’s shoulder, grinned and jumped back to his feet. “Now take my brother to his bed or lay him down on the couch if you want to stay here. The floor isn’t the right place for any of us.”
“Just killed the bitch. More like executed her but the outcome’s the same,” Claire replied and Sam pictured her shrugging at the other end of the line.
The uneasy feeling Castiel had experienced for the whole time of their stay was lifted when his eyes fell on Dean. He had known his friend was safe, but just seeing him soothed Castiel in a way no one else had ever been able to.
Damn it. There shouldn't be ghosts in the bunker, again. Yet, if he knew something, there was always something going bump in the night. When he headed out searching for whatever might have entered the bunker uninvited this time, he nearly stumbled over the little bundle that was crouching huddled in a blanket at the doorframe.
“Maybe you wanna put the windmill in your garden. You know, the garden you always talk about. Flowers for the wild bees and insects, and rabbit food to feed the moose…”
Their usual visit at the police station and the coroner’s office didn’t help Agents Swift and Plant in their investigation. They were still as clueless as before, although they had gathered a bit more intel on the victims. After they had been found, most of the kids were now staying at the same place: a local children’s home.
“I’m sorry I have ruined our moment.” He still felt the need to apologise.
Watching his friend doing the physical hard work, he knew it had been the right choice. Dean needed the distraction. His bodily reactions towards Dean were irritating, though. Since his return from the Empty, his want for Dean had taken up another notch.
“Okay?” Cas still sounded doubtful. “You actually want me to drive?”
This was it. Slowly, as if not to startle a frightened deer, Castiel lifted his other hand, the one not currently clutched by Dean, in order to touch Dean, to cup his face and hold onto him. Dean’s eyes grew wide the moment he realised what would happen. Tentatively, Castiel let the outside of his index finger stroke Dean’s cheek. Until now, Dean had stared at him, but as soon as he made contact with his skin he could feel and hear Dean drawing a breath. It almost sounded like a whimper. Dean closed both his eyes for a moment as if to collect himself, pressing their interlaced fingers firmer together.
When he was back at the graveyard, there was an eerie silence around the whole vicinity. The Impala was still there, but his brothers were gone. Suddenly, thunder roared, and the sky turned into a bloody red. This wasn’t good. When he found Bobby he tried to resurrect his friend, but nothing happened. Realising his powers were gone, he suddenly knew he was human. He had defied his father’s plan and now he had been punished. There was a sound, coming from the direction of the Impala. He couldn’t describe it. It sounded like nothing his angelic senses had ever experienced before. Taking a step in the direction of the car, he heard the same sound again, louder this time. Was that a groan?
Resting his temple on Dean’s shoulder, he nodded. Castiel wanted nothing more than to recreate that sensation, yet he feared it would be too much. Only once before had he experienced it, years ago in the deepest parts of Hell, when his true form had touched the righteous man.
came with the job description".
They were all there when he finally tried it. It looked like one of those cheesy romcoms he would never admit having watched ... and liked. He preferred to think of this more of a badass action, fantasy or sci-fi flick. Like Aragorn walking the Paths of the Dead or Leia rescuing Han from Jabba’s Palace. Hell, he didn’t even mind being Leia.
“That sounds reassuring,” Dean grumbled. “Yeah, uh, so, thanks, I guess.” He looked at the kid, trying his best to relay his sincerity. “Thanks, Jack.”
released the connection of their hands.
“Damn it, Cas, you’re so adorable I never could stop loving you.”
Dean scowled at him, before his curiosity got the better of him and his friend ripped open the bag. A broad grin appeared on Dean’s face when he took in the item Castiel had brought him. “Pie!? You brought me pie? Damn it, Cas. I love you,” Dean burst out, his voice still heavy with sleep.
Immediately, Castiel turned to Dean who still lay motionless on the floor. Dreading the worst, Castiel crouched down next to his friend and felt relief flooding through him when he could feel by touch that Dean was alive, though badly hurt. Grace poured out of Castiel’s fingers faster than he could think about it, and yet, he knew it wouldn’t be enough to completely heal the wounds. Once it would have easily done, but not anymore. He was able to cure the worst, however, and that would keep Dean alive and out of danger, even though it would still take some time for his friend to fully recover. Broken bones were mended, internal bleedings had stopped, and the life-threatening effects of the heavy concussion were taken care of. Most of the cuts were closed, leaving Dean with a bad concussion and several severe bruises. One last spark of grace sent Dean to a deep, dreamless sleep.
Eventually, Dean pulled back. “Well then, sunshine. Let’s not lose another minute.”
“It was always you, angel. Only you!”
“How?” Sam asked, astonished.
“I like Sam. It’s who you are.”
“None of them were you. You might be inexperienced, sunshine, but I love
With his last reserve of energy, Dean forced himself to look at him. “Lucifer–”
When Dean finally looked up, Castiel lowered his hand, losing their connection but hoping his friend would stay and listen. He needed to make sure his next words were not only heard but understood. It might be his only chance to explain himself.
He could recall only a handful of them if he was being honest. Dad had done what he had to do and Dean still loved him but that didn’t mean he had to follow in his footsteps. He’d already done that all his life.
“Thanks? I guess.” Dean bestowed a broad smile on Castiel, before he frowned at the phone. “Wait! What? You knew?”
Inch for inch, Dean tried to get some distance between their lower bodies when Cas suddenly shifted and created some breath-taking friction. Dean gasped at the sudden, yet welcomed contact.
“Everything?” Dean managed to croak.
, almost everyone of our friends. Gabe, too, of course. I’ve never been shy about it,” Dean erupted.
“Dean. It’s you. It’s really you.” Cas hand came up to Dean’s face. But before he touched it, shock was written all over Cas’ features. Scolding him with a simple move of his eyebrows, he muttered, “You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe. They’re here. They’re watching me. They’ll never let me go. They own me.”
As Castiel had said earlier, life wouldn’t be any easier now than before. Their pasts were still there, lingering in the background, with all their traumas and memories in their individual and shared histories. Unless they retired immediately, and probably even then, their lives would still be full of monsters, demons, angels, fights, and dangers of all kind. Yet, they wouldn’t need to fight on their own next to each other any longer. They finally had acknowledged their feelings. Castiel would not trade them, but all those years of pining and longing had been exhausting. One part of him had always been occupied with hope and fear, with the constant wariness that his feelings might be discovered. Now he was free to be himself, to finally explore who he truly was, what he wanted in life. Of course, there would be downsides of their relationship as well, but he finally knew that Dean loved him back. Looking at the man in his arms he knew whatever would happen in their future, they would be stronger because of it.
“Shuddup!” Like earlier that day, a single tear was falling down Dean’s face. Castiel wanted to kiss it away but wasn’t sure if he was allowed to. Instead, he raised their interlaced hands to his lips, brushing Dean’s knuckles with tiny kisses.
Dean set the blinker to the right, and stopped the Impala right there next to the road in the middle of nowhere, somewhere in Missouri or wherever they were driving through right now. This was too much. He was literally shaking. Turning towards his angel, he gaped at Cas. A hand cupped his right cheek immediately, and Dean leaned into it, bathing in the love that was radiating from it. A love he always had longed for, yet never deemed himself worthy of.
Castiel was tempted to roll his eyes towards all the sass thrown at him, but Dean was in no state for that.
At the same moment, Dean squeezed his palm, eyes mirroring the same feelings that were boiling inside him. He could swear he heard a hoarsely whispered “Later” escaping from Dean’s lips, but then again, it might as well have been his imagination playing tricks on him.
The hand vanished and Castiel took a deep breath he technically didn’t need. With both his grace and his body being affected by his arousal, his human body’s reactions became more prominent. In wonder, he realised he had piloerection. Touching his skin he frowned.
Castiel tilted his head in confusion.
Dean huffed and Castiel glared at him.
Stumbling back, he could feel his knees giving up and he slumped to the ground, unable to breathe under the weight pressing onto his chest. His phone was ringing in his ears. The cold of the dungeon’s stone floor seeped through his body. Cas was gone. He had seen it. He had been there. And he had never told him. Cas never knew. Cas never knew how much he loved him.
Sam nodded and sat up. Castiel crouched down and brought his right hand close to Sam’s temple. “May I? I can heal you. You will feel better afterwards.”
There he was, fallen, his powers decreasing, facing the two most powerful archangels in existence. He knew it was suicide, but this was where he had to be right now. Stull Cemetery was the only place he needed to be, the only place he wanted to be. Right here, helping Dean and Sam and Bobby to stop it; to stop the Apocalypse. After all, Dean was only human and he was right in the middle of it. No, not
“Ugh! I don’t want to know.”
Should he dare to risk some more teasing? No, not today. Today, he was too happy to have Cas back, to have his family back. Dean looked around the table: At Sammy who had become not only the finest hunter in existence, and a fucking witch if he chose to be, and now was finally free to do whatever he wanted. At Eileen who was not only a damn good hunter herself but also had chosen his moose of a brother as her partner – for whatever she saw in him. At Jack who was smiling, munching some fries as if nothing had changed, and yet he was the most powerful being in the universe. And then there was Cas. Cas who was his best friend, the one person in existence who knew as much about him as his brother, probably even more, and who loved him despite it. Hell, Cas was in love with him. It was still too much to have finally settled it. How could he be so damn lucky? For years and years they had danced around each other. He had doubted the thing that was between them. Had doubted himself, everything he ever knew. Still did.
“I don’t know. They did quite well on their own,” Sully replied, his legs swinging from the table he was sitting on.

*****
It had been so easy to say the words to a lifeless body. Now, his mouth moved but his tongue seemed to be stuck in his mouth, leaving him once again staring at Cas, completely unable to form any words. He cursed himself internally and just acted. His hands cupped Cas’ face when he yanked him towards him, finally bringing their lips together. It was kind of rough and far too short but he hoped his intention was clear. Cas’ hands wandered to his collar and now Dean was pulled towards his angel. Cas’ kiss was tender and light and everything he could have wished for. He could feel his own broad smile mirrored on his best friend’s face. Dean’s hands found Cas’ neck and the short hair in the back and buried into it. He wouldn’t let him go ever again.
“This time, when the Empty took him and Billy, Castiel didn’t die. Whereas Billy was already fatally wounded, Castiel was still alive. He had summoned the Empty and they collected their prize.”
Dean moved his lips over his teasingly, before he turned his attention back to his feathers in childlike wonder, his hand hovering right in front of them, eager to touch yet holding back, unsure if he was allowed to.
d-bags, Sammy. But you love us anyway.”
Castiel gasped as soon as Dean’s finger made contact with the feather. The sensation, a firework of feelings, rushed through every nerve of his human body and touched every aspect of his grace. For a moment, he felt vertigo and feared his knees would give up under him. Dean caught him right in time, holding him tightly.
Sam should have expected Claire’s reply. “Just call and I’ll come running.”
Dean lifted his head and stared at him unbelievingly, gaping, his mouth moving but unable to form any words.
Dean just stood there in the middle of his room for a moment to embrace this weird feeling of closeness before he put his brother down on his bed and covered him with the blanket Sammy had brought with him.
His brother looked at him questioningly.
Dean liked his angel this way.
Now it was at Cas to blush adorably. “I might have been too distracted from watching you.”
? Damn, you’re old as fuck. You could have anyone you ever wanted.”
“I can see that, Dean,” Castiel grumbled. For the first time he was looking up, hoping Dean’s face would give some answers. “What I don’t understand is why. You are fully aware I don’t eat.”
“Home,” Castiel answered, and, for the first time in his life, Castiel knew exactly where he belonged.
“Thank God,” Dean exclaimed, “I don’t think I can make it much longer.”
Somewhere in front of him, he suddenly could make out a shape.
Deep down, he knew that Cas was right to head straight back to the bunker. What other option was there with Sammy at his toes? Even though it meant they might lose the fucking witch’s trail.
“Capiche.” Cas smiled, taking Dean’s hand in his and guiding him back to the bed where he sat them down a feet apart, not touching except for their linked hands. Sitting there, they just had gone back to staring at each other.
“Damn it, Cas,” Dean cried out. “Open the fucking door. This ain’t funny any more. It’s freezing and your stupid anchovy pizza is getting cold. Not to talk about me.”
“I often observed you while you prepared dinner for yourself and Sam. Furthermore, I have been around long enough to gather some knowledge about cooking and the culinary arts in general. It should not be too difficult to mix several ingredients in certain amounts to heat them up at a specific temperature for a defined period of time.”
“Hey, don’t talk to me like that!” Dean returned.
“That’s what you guys are calling it today?”
Though, as always, he had done the only thing reasonable and retreated. Quickly closing the bathroom door behind him, Dean rested his back on the cold wood to steady his nerves and to fight off his body’s reaction to waking up to a view like
*****
“Dean? I’m sorry. I would have liked to tell you myself.”
“Damn it, Cas. Open the door. Who doesn’t like the pizza man?”
“Oh, I could think of a few things,” Jody threw in, but Dean ignored her.
“Guess what? He did,” Dean deadpanned, easily deflecting Cas’ logic.
“Yes!” On the spur of the moment, he laid his hand on Dean’s thigh, mirroring the earlier events.
“Cas, fuck,love, I won’t last any longer. I ...” Hazy green eyes were staring at him and Castiel closed the distance for a kiss. As soon as his lips touched Dean’s, the hunter bucked and white semen shot over Castiel’s hand and the adjacent vicinity.
“I have to go,” Jack said suddenly.
Finally allowing himself to close his eyes and to give in to his body’s primary demands, Dean was asleep sooner than Castiel could cover him with his wing.
The newspapers had prominently covered the case, and although the connections between the elderly and the children were obvious even for them, no one could explain the unexplainable. Sam only wondered why anyone would go to such lengths.
Dean uncocked his gun and slipped it into the waistband on his back before he squatted down and lifted his little brother into his arms. Who'd thought just yesterday he would be able to carry him so easily? Actually, it never had been so easy to carry Sammy around. Dean brushed his brother’s tears away with his thumb. "Come on, buddy! That's no place to rest. Wanna stay here with me tonight?"
“I seem to recall that you liked it.”
“He longed for you. Your bond was so strong, I could feel it. I called you, only amplifying what had always been there between you,” Jack explained. “Back then, I didn’t understand what I did. I was a newborn. All I wanted was to make Dean happy, hoping he would like me, and to find someone who wanted to have me. Someone who would accept me. I longed for my father. So I called your name.”
*****
“Or what? You’ll throw me out of the bunker because I got too close? Dean, I’m not going anywhere. I won’t leave you.”
At that, Dean opened his mouth to respond but Castiel laid a hand on his shoulder, and at once he could feel his friend calm down. “Let’s dress, love.”
Dean woke with a gasp, sweat soaking his clothes, panting heavily. These dreams had become worse. Hell, Dean was used to nightmares, he was a freaking expert, but this shit was new. This was real, personal. This was family. Though all his nightmares were based on reality, this was different. His nightmares usually messed him up, but Dean knew them far too well. All he had to do was deal with them. It sucked, but guess what? He was no sissy. This nightmare however ... These were memories Dean had buried deep down, never to visit again. With all the shit going on in their daily life, all these new nightmares were worse than Dean’s routine. He had never thought he would ever be bothered by those hidden memories again.
*****
“Yes. Thank you, love.”
Becky frigging Rosen?
“Now we’re truly hellbound,” Dean mumbled, chuckling. “Your mother always told me I’d be your downfall.”
Dean felt dizzy. He’d imagined he would have wanted to flee, to chicken out, hell, he still felt like running, but deep down he believed Cas. He probably had believed it for a long time. And Dean wished he could tell Cas how much the angel meant to him, how much he l–
“Oh, I don’t know,” Donna said, “I wouldn’t mind watching the conclusion as well.”
“He’s sleeping,” Castiel reassured him.
“Damn! Well, can’t change that. But I can change this.” Hands were in his hair and lips met his, nipping and teasing, until Castiel opened up. He returned the favour and for a moment they were lost in each other, relishing each other’s presence.
Dean lifted his welding goggles with both his hands, resting them on his temple. The goggles left imprints behind on Dean’s face. "Whatcha think it is?"
“Hey!” Sam took a step back, his arms raised in surrender. “You okay?” He sounded worried.
*****
DVDs in the player? I thought it was just another of his movies. My parents weren't a great help with sexual education after all."
“Awesome.” Dean’s eyes lit up. “Sorry, you had to see it like this, though.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Dean replied. “At least no one died this time.”
Dean tried to remember the previous conversation that led to this moment. They had talked about Adam and Michael, about angels, and about their vessels. Well, at some point Dean must have turned off the chatter, too engrossed in the food in front of him: a hearty steak, some bacon, lots of fries, and enough vegetables for his liking in the form of ketchup, and well, roasted corn on the cob. It had been a peace offering to his brother due to the lack of anything else that remotely resembled rabbit food.
“Dean.” Castiel held him back. “It’s okay.”
The boy beamed at his brother. “And now you have to apologise to Castiel.”
The dream sequence once again will be kind of heavy – there are child neglect, implied child abuse, parentification and panic attacks. I added a short summary in the end notes if you prefer to skip it.
“It’s not that difficult. All I did was bind his life force to mine when reducing his age. That way it will last longer.” The witch shrugged. “If I sever the binding or die, he’ll transform back to his former self. No big deal.”
The following silence was deafening. Cas was standing so close, far too close, and at the same time still too far away. This celestial wave of light the size of the Chrysler Building folded into its human vessel, that along the way had become Cas’ body, was focusing its – his – whole being solely on Dean. He could feel it. The air around them seemed to sizzle, smelling like an incoming thunderstorm, enhanced by all the things left unspoken between them, and Dean’s whole body was tingling. It reminded him of their first meeting in the barn in Illinois. It should be terrifying, yet all he could feel was this all-encompassing longing that threatened to crush him.
A shudder ran down his back when Dean cupped Cas’ face with both hands, his thumbs still brushing away residual and newly fallen tears. Without another thought, Dean dove forward until his lips found Cas’.
“As I said, the bond between Castiel and Dean is particularly strong,” Jack was explaining again.
“Bullshit! I won’t,” his friend objected.
“Dammit, Sammy, you need to hold on. Or I’ve to put you down.” Immediately, little hands grabbed his hair tightly. “Ouch!”
Whether this was another cruel dream, a hallucination, or whatever, Dean didn’t care. His hands grabbed his angel’s jaws and he kissed him, throwing all his love into the kiss, hoping Cas would understand, before he laid his head on his shoulder, gripping the coat tightly, and inhaling his scent, never wanting to let go. Sobs were running through his body but this close to Cas his breathing finally calmed down.
“Bullshit, Cas! Nothing was ruined. Come on. Let’s drive home.”
“Dean, you needa tell him.” Donna was frustrated. She couldn’t believe Dean, after everything that had happened, was still too chickenshit to talk to the angel. “You can’t ignore it. You can’t ignore
“Cas, I need to tell you ...”
*****
But it was a hunger Sammy didn’t need to know about. “Nah, we’re good. We’ll just head over to my room, getting some shut-eye.”
He huffed. “I’m painfully aware of that.”
They sat down around one of the library’s tables to eat united as a family for the first time in months. Sam complained that he and Cas should at least dress before they sat down but they happily ignored him.
Castiel raised an eyebrow.
For a moment, Dean tried to calm himself, but then Cas shifted his stance, and Dean’s brain short-circuited when he felt Cas was as turned on by this as Dean was. Almost choking on the gasp he tried to let out despite their still locked lips, Dean tore his eyes open.
Following and being led by Dean, Castiel felt giddy. Never had he expected this morning’s events. He might have hoped secretly, and sometimes not even so secretly, but Dean had never reciprocated his feelings, not openly. Now he wondered why he never caught any hint of Dean’s real feelings.
But nothing happened. Life and her surroundings came rushing back in. The diner’s sounds were almost too loud; cutlery clattered, buzzing voices formed an indistinguishable ocean of words, a mixer roared in the kitchen, and somewhere outside a motor backfired. Life was going on. Frowning, the witch repeated her motion without any further result and Claire let out the breath she didn’t know she had been holding, letting out a relieved laugh. They worked. Those frigging cuffs worked not only for angels and demons but for witches as well.
“What?” Castiel inquired, astonished. He stared at Dean, his head cocked, unable to think of something Dean liked more than pie.
“Why does Dean call you ‘Cas’, Castiel?” Leave it to the younger humans to touch the deep and interesting questions.
barn.
Dean glared at his friend. “Damn right, I ain’t happy about it.”
*****
Dean closed his eyes, knowing that Cas was probably still glaring at him. That had been a close call. It was a wonder he had managed to steady his breath and keep his heart from beating a loud enough tattoo  to evade the angel’s attention.
“Did it once for you. Setting up the pyre, preparing your body, collecting your ashes. That sort of shit. Did you know I refused Sam’s help?”
“Okay, Cas,” Sam sputtered, looking everywhere but at them. “Get me out of here! Now!”
“So did I, Dean. I’m painfully aware of how much grief I caused you. It was quite obvious a moment ago.”
“You’re lucky, I do.” Sam’s eyes fell on their joined hands. “Uh, congrats, I guess.”
“Yeah, nobody would have known you were a part of it. Instead you attacked – twice. First Sam, then Dean. Not to mention you taunted Dean with Sam’s fate before you assaulted me. ‘Completely innocent’, my ass.”
Dean pushed him away. “Shut up! That’s enough feelings crap for now.” Despite his obvious gruffness, underneath Dean seemed to be sorry about his own ingrained reaction. Well, if Castiel was right, and he profoundly hoped to be right this time, they had their whole lives to work on that. One day Dean would be able to accept praise without the immediate need to talk it down.
“And you’re a child,” Castiel threw back.
With a dread he couldn’t explain his eyes fell back on the computer. Hesitantly, he clicked on the attachment. The document opened and he started to read.
“Dean–,” he pressed out through his teeth, using all his power to keep it together.
“Holy shit! You’re reading
“What the hell?”
... this pencil man and why did you go out in the middle of the night?”
Jack had left them after bringing everyone back. He was eager to put the universe back in order and sort out Chuck’s mess with the help of Amara who was back in her own body. Thankfully. Before he had disappeared, though, Jack had promised to visit. He still felt uneasy to leave two pre-schoolers at the helm of the universe. Hell, Jack was a three year old and Amara might be an ancient being, though technically, she had grown up in this world only a few years ago. And yet, they were the best and only shot they had. Then again, Jack and Amara at least weren’t Chuck. That alone was hell of an improvement. For once, he needed to trust Jack. Trust Cas. It was all they got. With Rowena running Hell, Heaven needed some redirection itself. And Earth? There were still monsters loose. Nothing had changed. Not yet, though Jack was thinking about it.
“Perhaps. Perhaps not. We don’t know.” Cas tilted his head, focussing on the boy.
“Well, Dean, would you consent to me being inside of you?” Cas asked calmly.
Dean hovered somewhere between sleep and wakefulness while Cas carried him to his room where Cas softly laid him down on his bed. Gentle fingers brushed through Dean’s hair and the ghost of a kiss lingered on his temple. Smiling Dean tried to force his eyes open.
His friend looked at him with pleading eyes. There was no way he could resist him, especially since he didn’t want to. There was no need to hide any longer. “Yes,” was all he said.
It seemed that Dean hadn’t heard him opening the screeching door that definitely needed some oil. Dean was too absorbed in his work, and Castiel couldn’t help but stop in his tracks for a minute just to watch his friend. Dean’s flannel was thrown over Baby’s hood and a black t-shirt was hanging from a bar on the wall. Castiel wondered when had been the last time he had seen Dean only clad in an undershirt. However, he abandoned the endeavour in order to have his full attention turned to the man he had secretly loved for such a long time. The undershirt had untangled itself from Dean’s jeans, revealing a patch of skin on Dean’s back right over the waistband.
Claire sat on the couch, watching TV or whatever the kids called it today. She had her feet propped up on the table and Kaia, who was lying next to her on the couch, rested her head in Claire’s lap. Donna smiled when she spotted Claire’s hand buried in Kaia’s hair. The fierce hunter caressed her girlfriend in a way that melted Donna’s heart and lifted her already good mood even further.

“I prefer to leave them here. Look at them.” Dean gestured towards the place where Jack and Sam were still sitting on the floor. “They seem happy here. I think it would be the best. I’m still not sure I’m okay with leaving Sammy behind but Jack is safer here than outside.”
*****
“I love you, too, Dean.”
“In his grief Dean accused me of not caring. He attacked me because I didn’t mourn you as much as he did. And he was right. I didn’t. While I was able to go on with my life, Dean couldn’t. After all, I wasn’t the one who was and still is in love with you. This time it was even worse.”
“What? Hell, no! That would be so fucking wrong on too many levels. But look at them. He’s at peace.”
“Dean.”
As Castiel tried to take in his environment, the scene changed and he was sitting in his usual place on the backseat of the Impala, right next to a twelve-year-old Sam.
How the fuck could Jack know? Nobody knew. Nobody was allowed to know. But if Jack knew… Dean refused to think about the implications. His heart raced. Still coughing, he finally took in his environment.
*****
“Cas? Something happened?”
Cas turned his attention towards everyone around the table. “You want to talk to me?”
Afterwards, John talks about how proud he is of Dean's shooting skills and young Dean vows he'll always try to make his father proud.
Resting their heads together, Dean finally spoke, “Me too. Damn, I love you, Cas. It’s been such a long time. I–” Dean’s voice gave out and tears were falling down his face.
Cas squinted at him. “Since we are still on time there was no reason for me to do so.”
“Pizza delivery,” Dean shouted back. “Open the door, dude. The pizza man is here.”
“Shuddup!” Dean grumbled, but it didn’t stop another wave of laughter from his brother.
“You what?” Dean exclaimed, afraid this would bring them new trouble with the winged bastards. A hand on his thigh calmed him down but agitated him nonetheless when he realised whose hand it was and what he was – or wasn’t – wearing. A quick glance at Cas told him, the bastard knew exactly what he was doing, even though he still looked at Jack.
“Thank you very much.” It didn’t take much to recognize the sarcasm in Dean’s response, even for Castiel.
He came to a stumbling halt, when he saw the black goo creeping over the figure in front of him. The goo changed its form and suddenly a heartless copy of Cas was standing in front of him. The image might be right, though the effigy had absolutely nothing of Cas.
And as if he was fully on board, Dean heard himself planning ahead with Cas. “No. You call him. This is your crazy idea. And he has this telepathic link thing going on. Don’t think it’ll work with me. But with your angel mojo it’ll do for you. And so you know, I totally blame you when anything happens to Sammy.” Dean pointed his finger at Cas. “Or when we return and find out the bunker turned into unicorn sparkle world.” A shudder ran down Dean’s spine. “Scariest crime scene ever.”
*****
“That sounds wonderful, Jack.” Castiel smiled at his son. Getting rid of the ancient hierarchical structures could only improve the ways up there. This version of Heaven sounded reasonable, especially after all the failed attempts of usurping Heaven’s power within the last few years that they had witnessed, and, in his case, were being part of.
don’t deserve
Eventually, he settled down on the step in front of the telescope, his anger still simmering in his chest. But he finally could breathe steadier. For a moment he wondered where Jack was when his phone buzzed.
“Why didn’t you want me to see it?”
“Yeah, sweetheart?” Dean actually had the nerve to drawl.
“And leave Baby behind?”
*****
Until then, I might post something shorter, if editing the fic will leave some time and inspiration.
“Hey,” Dean protested, “I’m holding a knife.”
Cas nodded.
Castiel looked at his friend in agony. All he wanted to do right now was to hold him, show him how much he meant to him. But he was afraid Dean would be freaked out and shut down completely. It already was astonishing that he talked so openly about his fears.
“Are you certain Jody will be able to help? I didn’t know she was into witchcraft. It seems to be a rather complicated spell with the instilled memory loss. Sam’s appearance is not just reduced in years. The spell altered his whole being to a former one from his past. He was transformed back to his self and knowledge of 1987.”
“You two were idiots. Not sure if that has changed now, though,” Claire chimed in, shaking her head.
*****
Dean was out in a moment and Castiel’s heart sank. The hunter had probably spent more hours sleeping or knocked out over the last two days than he usually allowed himself over the span of a week or even more. The sleep was necessary for his recovery and yet seeing Dean this vulnerable and hurt only kindled Castiel’s fears and self-doubts. What if it had all been just a fluke and an illusion? Would Dean still want him when he woke up, when he eventually recovered? Yes, Dean had still flirted with him right now after the incident with Sam. Their evolving relationship still seemed natural and true. What Castiel had learned over the last years he had spent with the Winchesters, though, was that moments of happiness were fleeting.
Gabe went from joking to serious immediately, and Anna sat forward in her seat. “Information we can read?” she asked.
Sam laughed. “I know, I know.” He turned to look at his brother with a smile. “You’ll kill me.”
They got into the car and Dean gave Cas the umbrella to hold while he was driving.
Andrea was on a business trip. She worked in humanitarian aid, bringing blood transfusions and vaccines to areas with poor medical hospitals.
>>From: Cas
“Wait!” Dean hastily got up and walked over to where Cas had gotten to. “Hey Cas, I really mean it when I say thanks. Who knows how long I’d have been up there if you hadn’t come and the person who found me might not have been as sweet, so… thanks a lot, man.” Dean said, punching Cas lightly in the shoulder. He held a hand up in front of Cas. “But if you ever tell anyone about this I will skin you alive.”
He held his hand out. “Ok, so if you would just grab my hand, I’ll hold you up while you jump down to this level.”
~~~~~
She handed Crowley the stone.
Gabe sighed. “Alright, but at least order something if you’re gonna keep taking up counter space.”
Cas squinted at Dean. “It’s supposed to rain. Why wouldn’t I wear my coat?”
“Sammy! What’s up!”
“Ok.”
But Samuel’s biblical importance was not what had Castiel nervous tonight.
“Dean Winchester. I am familiar with him. The loyalist demons will be, too.”
“Get your mind out of the gutter, Sammy! I’m just a gentleman who didn’t want to impose on his boyfriend’s roommate any further. Yup.”
Gabe drummed his knuckles on the table and pointed at Cas. “You got it, bro!”
“See you then.”
“This is,” Cas cleared his throat, making sure to remember the fake name Gabe had thought of. “Loki, the owner. Loki, this is Dean.”
The interviews had all been really emotional. Especially Castiel’s. Apparently Castiel had indeed been a prisoner of Naomi’s before. Dean had had a hard time keeping himself professional while Castiel was retelling his experiences.
“And stocks, right?” Dean said. “Not to be creepy or anything, I just remember your donor file mentioned that’s how you made your fortune.”
A couple days after that, Dean went back to work. Bobby had tried to convince him to “take some time off, take care of yourself, son,” but they had both known from the beginning of the argument that there was no chance in hell that Dean was going to do any such thing.
Gabriel hummed again.
“Cas,” Dean slurred, pointing at his chest. “I like you ‘n all, but ain’t no way you’re driving my baby.
Dean nodded. “Family” he said, understandingly.
“Us angels aren’t that easy. Even cut off from heaven we’re a lot more powerful than any demon, no matter how high ranking. Holy fire is still the only thing that can hold them, and Castiel alone has escaped from at least three rings of holy fire. He’s the lowest ranking of them all.”
“Why indeed.”
“Could I get a ride?”
Gabe appeared next to him. “There’s some blood directly behind the house, like in the front, but no more of that gooey stuff. And there’s nothing else beyond that. I checked all around. Even when I expanded my radius so that it reached the closest nearby house, nothing else.”
A buzz sounded from a box to the left. A bored voice called out. “What, what do you want!”
“Oh no yeah uh. The paper’s fine. I was actually calling for uh… personal reasons?”
Dean seemed to pause, and stared at him for a beat. Cas felt a sinking in his stomach, worried that he’d already blown his cover. Then Dean said, “Yes, Mr. Novak,”
“Oh?” Cas asked.
#####
“Yeah, sorry. It’s Castiel. My parents were… a bit unorthodox in their naming.”
Gabriel and Anna came up and physically supported him.
Dean hung up the phone. Cas’ head was still reeling at what had just occurred. He was going on a date. With Dean Winchester. As much as he was fully aware that this whole proposition could end up blowing up in his face, he was… excited.
Dean let himself cry for a while. He knew he had to let himself feel the emotions, but he couldn’t let himself drown in them. He had to at least keep himself afloat, because if he let himself fall it would be so much harder to get up this time.
“Yeah,” Benny replied. “I wasn’t sure for th-“
“Shut up,” Dean smiled.
“No, no” Dean said, calming the other man down. “I would love to, Cas. Here, I’ll give you my number.” Dean wrote his number on the side of the cup and handed it to Cas. Cas smiled. “Now, you better get back to your brother, it seems like he’s getting bored over there.”
“I- I- You- ,“ Cas could hear himself stammering. It was embarrassing. He could command legions without feeling anxious at all, but for some reason he was faltering now.
Dean got down on his knees and started to kiss the earth in front of him. He let out an appreciative groan. “I have never been so happy to see the grass! I LOVE YOU DIRT! Ohhh! I am ready to accept the ground as my lord and savior!!” Cas rolled his eyes at his childish behavior.
The drawer stared back at him.
Dean paid and made his way over to James. ‘Alright, Winchester. Be cool, be cool,’ he thought to himself. He plopped down in the stool next to him. “Hey, Jimmy! How’s it going?”
He must have taken too long. Dean said “I understand,” sounding defeated. Hearing Dean sound so sad was apparently not something Cas could stand.
Castiel swallowed “Right, well, please, have a seat. I’m sorry to greet you like this,” Cas said as he tried, in vain, to smooth down his hair with his hands. “I wasn’t expecting any visitors today. Would you… uh… like some food?” Cas gave himself a mental high five for not blushing or stammering too much while he said that.
Now more innocent people had been attacked. At another school he attended. It didn’t take a genius to put two and two together. Supernatural creatures making a bold attack on a college campus; they must have been looking for him and the stone tablet again.
“Yeah, um, you fell asleep on me last night. I was gonna wake you, but you looked so…” He cleared his throat. ‘Cute,’ he thought. “…comfortable.”
Now a plan was formulating in Dean’s mind. If Sam’s invitation also came with a plus one, they probably all did…
That’s all he wanted most days. But he couldn’t. It wasn’t safe for her. He wasn’t safe for her.
Castiel gave a meek laugh “It’s been months, I should be able to liberate some prisoners by now. It shouldn’t matter that their hers.”
“I’m on the younger end, but not one of the youngest. If that makes sense. I was born late enough to be considered a ‘baby’ of the family, and to be raised more by my older siblings than any parent. But, I was still looked up to. I still had enough siblings younger than me, and even some older than me, who looked up to me that I was seen as… someone to be respected?” Cas quieted. He wasn’t quite sure where he was going with this.
