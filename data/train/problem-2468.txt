"Fuck you! And tell him yourself. That is if you're not afraid."
“What’s this, a group rated higher than the SEALs? Indeed. The British Special Air Service was created in 1941 as a force which could operate behind German and Italian lines and support resistance movements against the occupation forces. Understandably, the force is made up of British military personnel with the most coming from the airborne forces. Physical requirements are harsh and require a lot of marching with full packa. This culminates in a 40 mile march with a full pack that must be finished in 20 hours. Candidates must also be able to swim two miles in an hour and a half and run four miles in 30 minutes. After this, you get dropped in the jungle to learn survival and navigational skills, after which you endure survival practice. The final test is a 36-hour interrogation session meant to break the candidate’s will. The handful who make it through this get transferred to an operation force for further training. Not convinced this is ‘better’ than the SEALs? It may help you to know that the SAS is also trained by MI5 and MI6 security and intelligence services to undertake counter-espionage operations. It’s like having a SEAL and James Bond all rolled into one.”
Sherlock had had lovers a plenty. In his uni days he had explored. Seeking data and making comparisons. The French were romantic and tender. The Italians were cocky. The Americans even more so. The Spanish talked. A lot. The Brits, were vanilla and reserved. But John Watson The Scotsman well now he was something altogether different. Not just because of his size or his dizzying skill in and out of bed. No it was the fact that Sherlock felt human with John, or at least what he thought being human felt like to every day human beings. Full of light and warmth. Calm. Contented. Sherlock placed a note on the bedside table. He lightly touched the shot cropped blond hair. Sherlock turned and left with the greatest hope he’d see John Watson again.
John stepped into the cool Berlin night air, totally obvious to the old world beauty in front of him. Beauty was behind him, sitting quietly waiting just for him. But he couldn’t expect him to wait six months, most likely more. It was too much to ask of a new...relationship? Was that what this was? The past three days had been unlike any in John’s history. But just because it was beautiful and alien and familiar all at once didn’t make it a full fledged relationship. Did it? In the end it was all just semantics to John. He loved Sherlock, plain and simple. Fuck. So now what? The job was the job, just as it had always been. The problem was he wasn’t the same man. How could he be after...
19. Have you ever been in love?
Sherlock stopped fidgeting, and turned to face is brother. John had told him that trust was essential, not in those exact words but it was implied. Perhaps a bit of trust was needed here.
"Yes, yes of course. Nicked liver, quite a bit of blood loss." Sherlock swayed noticeably on his feet at the words. Lestrade put a steadying hand on his shoulder.
“Can we leave Sherlock out of this? Please.” The smile dropped away as quickly as it had appeared.
Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia
John only too eager to comply, buried his cock to the hilt and nearly came as the blinding pleasure coursed through his body.
“Alright.” But John didn’t take the path lied out in front of him. He had different roads he wanted to follow. “What about you?”
"Ok. Soooo..."
"What shit?" Sherlock asked, with a puzzled look between John and Lestrade.
“He sent you.” Sherlock said wistfully as if anything even remotely connected with John was a source of wonder.  He waited for conformation as Cardinal’s vibrant green eyes appraised him. He didn’t like the scrutiny, or the irony.
Two Months Later
"Thank you Mercy."
I'm fine John.
John watched Sherlock’s ever move and imagined his muscles moving and tensing under his touch.
"What you mean to say is that I'm too feeble to stand in one spot and hold a cocktail because that's essentially what I’ll be doing." Sherlock bothered his cuff.
“For just a second you’d realize...”
"You may need more than names. You may need a snowplow and a helicopter. Or have you forgotten where we are?" Sherlock took a sip, chuckled and ran a hand through his curls, something he rarely did and John couldn't help but wish it was his fingers tangled in the lush blackness.
“Christ you’re perfect...”John groned out the words into Sherlock’s mouth. “Take your clothes off.”
"Why? Why would you do this to me? Do you hate me? Why do you hate me? What did I ever do?"
It was an hour before two sticky bodies with numb limbs started to move. John stayed resting on his back, the sheet pulled just to the top of a nest of dark golden curls. Sherlock propped on his side head resting in his right hand, his left on Johns chest, fingers cataloging his scar.
It was him. He was on the floor in an incredibly small ball. There was no movement. No sound. Still silence. John moved on auto pilot, pushing up his balaclava and pulling off his tactical glove with his teeth ready to do what he'd done thousands of times, check for a pulse, the soft flutter of life flowing just beneath the surface. Please...
"Well yeah." John was too distracted by Sherlock's cock rubbing on his thigh, his lips making a path over his shoulder, his stubble scraped across sensitive skin, to make any kind of plausible denial.
"John, where are we? Some where in the contrary yes, but where I can't place the air. Is it Dorset, or maybe Cornwall. And the bees. There are bees somewhere yes? Why are there bees John?" Sherlock leaned heavily on the door frame, as he peppered John with questions, the short walk depleting what strength he had.
Moriarty paced the aisle between the leather chairs of his private jet clearly agitated. That’s why Sebastian hadn’t said a word since the Maryborough. An agitated Jim was a dangerous Jim, and there wasn’t enough room on this jet for one of their fights.
Mercy who never allowed herself to be pushed gestured for Harbinger to do just that, who was more then happy to oblige.
"So your saying, that your mind felt quiet."
~Burn Your Flyers~
John and his team.
"So then I am correct in my deduction that you or rather your...that is to say you have...ah...a." Sherlock stammered.
"Too real, so beautiful, not fair. I loved you so much. Fuck. Do still." John drank deeply from the bottle he held tight. "You where always so perfect...so beautiful. This hurts too much Sherlock. God I can't even say your name...without it...it just all hurts so much. I can't do this anymore, I want to be with you. Please just let me be with you."
"Not true. And don't upset yourself, it will only make your head worse." John guided Sherlock to his bed by the window and patted the pillow for him to lay back. "I know plenty about you. The infamous Sherlock Holmes." John looked about the little kitchenette for a flannel, wet it and wrang it out. "I know that you're brilliant, and gorgeous and that you fancy me. But you don't trust me. I'll have to work on that. So when did all this happen?" John held the cold cloth to Sherlock's bruised temple and watched his pupils carefully.
Sherlock stood as John talked and took off his suit jacket and rolled up his cuffs before sitting back on the floor just a hair closer to John, now his long drawn out legs rested against John's from calf to thigh with Sherlock's toes occasionally brushing at John's waistband. The first contact make John giggle, the second made him burn. He shuddered to think what the third would do.
"Coming from the man who just dropped five men from a hundred yards out in the dark in less then ten seconds, I'll take that as a compliment."
2. What is your greatest weakness?
Irene had taken over Sherlock’s studio flat on Angel Lane, just to feel closer to her lost friend. She invited John over frequently but he mostly declined. But today he was shipping out and had come to say his goodbyes.
They find each other
John made two calls as he walked back to a bolt hole in Al Jizah. Mercy had been the first. Mycroft was the second.
Location unknown
John pushed up his night vision goggles and looked about his surroundings. He couldn’t help but think he was paid far too much money to creep around in dark alleys. There was a bit more to the job then that but essentially creeping in dark alleys was the gist. John smiled at his thoughts and pulled on his Condor shooters gloves preparing to take the building across the street when a shadow slipped around the corner not three feet in front of him. He would have know that silhouette anywhere.
“I was thinking something along the lines of unbelievable, but yours works too.”
Your brother made it clear that he could have me delt with whenever he felt like it.
John stood at the window and watched Trevor exit the taxi below, he took another sip of scotch and waited. Maybe when he was done here since he had it on good authority that the place was about to become available he'd have Mercy buy the flat and turn it into a London bolt-hole since his future plans where to spend the majority of his time here in London. The faint sound of keys outside pulled John out from his thoughts.
John tilted his head sideways and studied the piece of work in front of him for a moment. He had to admit, Sherlock Holmes was magnificent, and he had more then gotten under John’s skin. “Alright then. Gloves off.” He up ended his glass, and stood.
"That's why I kissed you."
"Done. But I'm sure there will be little to nothing of worth at a drunken game of truth or dare to interest you. It's just that brain of yours over thinking things as usual." They walked side by side at a brisk pace.
“Hello Love.” John didn’t say anymore. Clearly this whole thing was Sherlock’s creation and John wanted to see how it was meant to play out. So he settled back into the cushions of one of the three velvet sofas and waited.
“Why are you here?” His defense were up in an instant.
“I knew who and what you where with every step that I persuaded you.” Sherlock shrugged resigned to what was.
"Sherlock..." John began slowly, still in a fog of desire.
“Ahaha!” John laughed with not one ounce of humor.
"Mycroft. I would ask, to what do I owe the pleasure, but then I'd be lying."  John pulled off his jacket and grabbed a bottle of scotch and a rock glass. "Tea?" He held the bottle out to Mycroft, as he slumped down on the sofa.
“The message reads, ”Don't meddle with things that are outside your purview, Dr. Watson.”
“Two years. So none of them have family. But of course not, that would compromise them." Sherlock pulled a frown and let his words trail off. “Tea?”  He threw the word over his shoulder bounding up from the sofa not waiting for an answer. The gears were turning and John could tell Sherlock had hit on a subject that made him somehow uncomfortable.
John sat forearms resting on bent knees on the ground of a small rise that over looked the military base and the town of Sangin, where scattered columns of black smoke from the nights battles mixed with the pinks and purples of the rising sun. He’d been up since this time yesterday, the fighting had been intense and the casualties steady, so his morning coffee was doing little to keep sleep at bay at this point. He knew he should catch an hour or two before more casualties began to pore in, but the thought of closing his eyes to the monsters of his dreams was a less appealing thought then dropping dead of exhaustion. Most nights his dreams were riddled with broken and bloody screams and he would wake drenched and panting. Those were the nights John welcomed, those horrors were real, and he could lay hands on those demons in the day light and drive them away. It was the other dreams, the ones of eyes the color of winter rain fanned by dark lashes, as a musical swirling baritone uttered “John” that left him shaken and lost. There was no fight against ones own heart. John marveled at the mans grip on him still. He often wondered if he ever crossed that brilliant beautiful mind. The local landscape didn’t help matters much either. The over abundance of tall thin men with dark curls had sent John’s heart rate skyrocketing more times then he’d care to admit. But admit it he did. Six years on and John had had nothing more meaningful then a two night stand. Love was no longer his to give. Nor did he seek it. Because their was only one source that could fill his needs. So he would live his life out in the sun and sand and conflict, doing good where he could and hopeing each day a bullet would fill the hole in his heart.
“I’ll handle it.” John was unfocused and more then a little dazed as if he’d suffered an actual physical blow. What the fuck was happening? He had to get his head around this right fuckin now, the opt ahead was a dangerous one, and he needed to be on point. Fuck if Sherlock Holmes was going to put him off his game. If he wanted it to be...what over? Then so be it. It’s over. Right?The thought stabbed his heart, behind his eyes, in his gut. John rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. Fuck! What the fuck. Why? Why? Why? The question filled John’s head in a cacophony of pain pushing away everything else. Fuck this! John was not some fresh faced school boy who'd never been kissed. What he was was a grown ass man who had NEVER been dumped in this life. And now was not the time for this absolute bullshit! FUCK!
John smiled satisfied that Mercy seemed to realize that to John this was worth all the danger it could bring. “ Thank you Mercy.”
"No? Come on!"
Sherlock gave John a puzzled look.
“Mmm. Yes love?” John was peaceful.
“You’re right. When he dies, fifty years from now, or fifty minutes, I will most certainly be quite broken. And yet...I won’t let that truth *or you*stop me.”
”I need you to tap a phone and track someone.”
"Do you not want me to?"
"That's not him." Said John.
"John has nothing to do with this." Sherlock said softly not wanting to have John tangled up in the ugliness. "And I don't think Thomas is out to physically hurt me. None of the other participants were harmed in that way and I can't see why I would suffer a dissimilar fate."
“Oh, well that’s aces! To have someone who can get past all that history, I mean just the needle use alone is enough to put most people off, let alone the drugs! This guy of yours must really be something. I’d love to met him.”
"Well, ugh." There was clear hesitation in Lestrade's voice. John stopped in mid motion, closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.
"Like I said scared." John gave Greg a hard look and was about to speak when he was cut off. "I know I know, give you a lap."
“What!?” John stood up and reflexively grabbed his L9A1 from the small of his back as if the threat where right in front of him. “What happened...where is he...who has him!?”
John Hamish Watson
"Afraid." Thomas scoffed and turned to leave.
"Ok. Soooo..."
“Oh I don’t know maybe one day more likely then you think. Anyway, down to business you’re here because I’ve got intel. Sherlock’s in danger.”
“But I’ve already met your team, save for Bishop.”
STOP! This chapter had blasphemous overtones. It is not intended to offend, its simply how I see things.
"If you must know John, cousin Brandabas, calls this his shag cabin. Hence the copious amounts of liquor and the unrealistic supply of condoms."
IIEA~
"Then your people swoop in and save the day."
"How could I possibly tell you no."
“No, I got it. Meet you downstairs.”
“Yes you are,” John was fairly certain Sherlock had stomped his foot. “especially since you’re making us go to this foolishness.” Sherlock sulked settling his chin on John’s right shoulder.
“I’m in London for a time. Do you remember me?” Cardinal moved about the sitting room clearly assessing things, vantage points, entry and exit, threat levels and the like.
“Good. Let’s keep this simple then shall we. I want to take this place just like we would any other whore. Hard and fast. Over.”
“If Sherlock can track you on a whim. Others can find you as well.”
“Fuck Sherlock.” John allows his body to adjust and revels in the fullness. Push and slide. Slowly deeper.
"No. Really not that bad at all."  The mood in the room was shifting, good scotch, better company and a surprisingly intimate game. John grinned and moved on to the next question.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Dean Greyson, and Thomas, are trying to root out and get rid of 'my kind', Paul is the link between the two, I'm sure of it."
"Hello J. What's the plan?"
Sherlock paused, on the edge of saying something glib, he wasn’t accustom to being told what to do, and even less so with actually complying.
“You have me.” John’s answer was immediate and wholehearted.
"Yes." John knew that this was a serious topic but he couldn't help a bit of cheek. After all turn about was far play. Sherlock narrowed his eyes. John tried not to chuckle. He failed.
“Will any random set of digits do or are you looking for something specific?”
“But you play the sparrow so well.” Mercy teased.
"Alright then. Let's hear it." John said pulling Sherlock's toes playfully.
~You do recall I fancy girls?~
“Sorry, *just away with the fairies* there for a minute. Yes Sherlock of course you are correct. But there will be a team, my team in place as well as myself at the ready to come and get you, once we know where the uranium is located. So do whatever they say, keep smart ass to a minimum...”
"Yeah, I'll just..." Lestrade, let the words trail off as he went down the stairs. John came to stand in front of Sherlock, in his personal space, John took Sherlock's hand and rubbed his thumb over his knuckles. Sherlock's breath jerked and he closed his eyes.
-Truth or Dare flyer left on my door. Headed there now. Still not talking to you-
Team Caspian-Lamb (Team Leader) Angel, Sunfire, Polaris, Icarus, Ra
The blue eyes narrowed. “I have no idea who you mean.”
“Irrelevant. Why are we here, and not out there hunting the proverbial bad guys?”
Doctors came and went. But Sherlock stayed. Irene convinced him to leave only once.
"Besides, Lestrade, practically ordered us to "sort our shit out" it would be dereliction of duty if we didn't." Sherlock had walked away from John at this point and was waiting at the threshold to his room. "Coming?" He said over his shoulder giving John the most perfect view of his bottom.
“Victor I have someone now.” Sherlock hates the way the unsteady words fall out of his mouth.
"Because I'm afraid." John felt the time for words was over.
"And Shakespeare just rolled over in his grave and flipped you off! Can we please get to the smut?!"
John chuckled despite himself.
“Hello J.”
"Piss off and meet me after class, so we can find out who got flyers this round."
You're basing that on yourself.
"Twat!" John smiled.
"It didn't take much."
As above so below.
Fine. He would just have to go to the shops himself. Fine. Sherlock snatched the door open and was stunned to see a flyer for the next Truth or Dare taped to his door. Oh! The game was on.
“The Darjeeling Opt. It...went south. No survivors.”  Mycroft’s hand stopped mid motion. She waited...”Sir?”
John hesitated at the door for a second. There really wasn't any more damage they could do to each other was there. John opened the door and stepped in.
5. How many blankets do you sleep with?
He hadn’t been held captive long, but these men were skilled torturers (only the best for the best he supposed.) a lesser man, a lesser mind would have given them all that they’d asked for almost instantly. But for Sherlock the pain they inflicted was an excecercise in understanding. And although he didn’t like pain he could at least gain information on how the body reacted and responses  to the different torture methods. Data, data, data.
Sherlock was in the kitchen only slightly bent over the table when John entered to continue their conversation. It was the eye contact this time that was John's undoing, changeable jewels saying all manner of roguish things. Well that and the pure sight of Sherlock standing there in his crisp white shirt cuffs rolled up, his hands splayed flat on the table one knee slightly bent and his bottom hugged in sinfully tailored black trousers. John took him right there on the table Bunsen burner and all. Pushing Sherlock down onto the table and grinding into his plush bottom, while John fumbled to undo the zipper that was keeping him from his desire.
“Consulting dick?! Forensic scientist I’ll have you know, theoretical physicist, a botanist, a chemist and a private detective all in one. I lend assistance, to a Detective Inspector Lestrade, and his woefully inept team of subordinates when their out of their depth. Which is always. Mostly.”
“Watson!” Someone else needed help. John turned to answer right into the path of a bullet. Pain ripped through his body blinding and hot. A black tunnel of confusion sucked John down. Why was he suddenly so cold? Where had the sounds of the battlefield gone? And why was everything...Sherlock? John’s thoughts echoed in his spinning head.
John suppressed a laugh, that died when he read the pain in Sherlock’s face as he tried to move.
"Hadn't planned on it." John said nicely.
“The Golden Tringle. Six months, longer maybe, I never really know.”
“Consulting dick.” John made to change the solemn tone. “Tell me more about what you do.”
His mobile buzzed.
"Dr. Watson." Mycroft, judged the flat to be in the same shabby condition it had been in since the day his little brother had jumped from St. Bart's. He judged John, to be in no better shape.
“I guess I should thank you.”
“Sherlock.” John fixed him with a wolffish deep blue stare that came to rest on Sherlock’s lush mouth. “You are fucking perfection.” John put a hand on Sherlock's jawline cupping his face and slowly rubbing the rough pad of his thumb over Sherlock’s slightly parted plush bottom lip transfixed by the motion as he spoke. “As much as I wish that I could bend you over this seat and fuck you to tears, we have a mission and I need you in full control of that brilliant mind of yours.”  Before John could drop his hand away Sherlock caught the tip of John’s thumb between his lips and sucked gently, John shut his eyes and pulled a hiss like breath through his teeth. Sherlock licked his tongue over the rough digit for good measure. John let his eyes drift open and held Sherlock in his lust filled gaze, a slow half cocked smile set hot butterflies in motion in Sherlock's stomach. The moment was more powerful then Sherlock could bear and he quickly sought to change the mood suddenly fully aware of the fire he’d been playing with.
“Hello Dr. Watson.”
Well that just happened. I wonder if John will visit Sherlock? Is Jim Moriarty ever really out of the picture? And what dose big brother Mycroft have to say about this whole...affair? I do hope you’ll stick with me and see.
"I would hardly call this wilderness Sherlock. Your cousin's cabin is actually nicer than our flat."
Sherlock used his voice to advantage. John groan and very nearly came in Sherlock's hand. John needed to talk but could barely form one word.
John grimaced and turned his head pressing himself against the wall as tight as he could waiting for the hail of bullets tearing the air right in front of his face to subside. Stop. Three seconds, dead silence. John sprinted to Moran’s location, laying down his own steady barrage of bullets as he went sliding into the dirt right next to the down man. John hastily pulled a L109A1 hand grenade from his pocket and tossed it into the windows with whatever terrorist still remained. John’s gaze remained focused on the building in front of him as he groped blindly trying to find a pulse on Moran silently praying to the old Gods that he hadn’t inadvertently killed a psychopaths boyfriend.  What he got for his troubles was his hand smacked away.
See above
Sherlock tried to focus his tired heavy eyes on the ceiling at the over large spider that loomed there, legs seeming to crawl this way and that at odd angles, he must have lay that way fixed for hours before his mind allowed the thing to morphed into the cracked ceiling that it actually was. Through a curtain of gray fog Sherlock recognized not the first time that he was not good. He wasn't well in the head, and that fact shook Sherlock. His mind was bogged down and listless slow to start and difficult to keep going, like a cold engine with not enough petrol.  His body was no better. He couldn't seem to move stiff limbs heavy with a weight that no longer existed because he was practically skeletal, breathing was a tornado of glass shards in his lungs. But the worse part was the rambling around in his mind palace staggering from one dark disheveled room to the next desperately seeking...what? Something was missing something valuable, important, something precious was missing. He'd been here before, cut off from his mind, adrift. But no, not here. Once it had been...peaceful? Now it was penitence. For...what? He wept. Did he? He wanted to. God how he wanted to. But what he wanted wasn't an option, there were consequences here not options. There was only the fog and the cold and the pain and the work. One followed the other over and over unending. The work. Not the work that he loved, but the work they had forced him into here. The work that he only did because they kept him suspended in a stat of leaden compliance. That was the time he was allowed to surface, not much, but just enough to be functional, enough to do what came almost naturally, science and chemical of it all. At times the fog was light enough for brief peeks of sun to melt just the sharp edges of his icy cell. The warm strong sun. He had once loved the sun. And the sun had loved him back.
“That would be...” John looked down shoved one hand in his pocket and rubbed the back of his neck with the other.
"Nooo Sherlo..." John's words died when Sherlock crushed him against the wall with a hungry kiss, that trailed John's jawline and back down to suck deep purple love bites into the crook of John's neck, all the while Sherlock's hands delved into John's waistband tugging at his shirt, belt, button. "Sherlock you're mad! We can't. Molly is in the next room."
“Bait you? No. Bed you? Yes.”
"Not my area. But why? Why is this part of me, this part of my life so important to you? Why do you care?"
“Now I get it. You like it. Me fresh from the field. In the field. Ooh you.” Both John’s hands found Sherlock’s curls now pulling him into a searing kiss coupled with grinding hips and throaty moans that left them both panting and hungry. John pushed away quickly and stood up grabbing his cock through his jeans. Sherlock rolled to his back and reached a hand up to join John’s. John let the wicked fingers work over him for a moment before he backed out of reach. Sherlock looked like a child who’d just had a lolli snatched away.
“Everyone’s a moron to you.” John shifted his hips back.
John reread the letter, and heard the words spoken in the velvet sultry purr that was Sherlock, and he laughed, deep and full of contentment. Ever the enigma his Sherlock. His. Well this was a turn up.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. This chapter that you’ve all waited so long for is very short. For that I am sorry. But I can only write what our boys give me. This felt like a fitting end to a long ride. I do hope you’ve enjoyed it. A thousand times thank you for reading in advance.
The pain that radiated off of John was almost tangible
"Sherlock, why is there a fez in the sitting room?"
"Brilliant work." John cut in and felt a surge of adrenaline, finally! "Send me the coordinates the extra bodies shouldn't be a problem..."
“Is he married?” Sherlock continued.
“Goodbye J.”
Unlike Mycroft, Mercy could hear the angry Gaelic in John’s voice and  knew it was time to give up. And so she did. “Copy that. Good luck J.”
"Jesus Sherlock! I'm on the phone." Sherlock laughed low in his throat, a sound that John loved the instant he'd herd it for the fist time last night.
“I try to stay away from the from the military ones.”
"Thank you Mercy."
Irene stepped back into the cool air of the hotel room, leaving the terrace doors open and the bright dessert sun behind her enjoying the mixture of hot and cold. She accepted the cup of tea that was offered to her and sat down across from her savior.
The breach went off without a hitch. Moran did his part flawlessly taking out five armed men in lass then ten seconds, John doned is balaclava and went to work under cover of total darkness having had Mercy go dark, John gave the order to restore the power and Moran took up position behind him surrounded by the dead John had left in his wake.
"Oh my dear boy you simply being you is exactly why your fate will differ. Thomas has a special type of hatred for you. You were the irresistible force that tugged at his sexuality." Irene took back the cigarette squinted her eyes and pointed a warning finger at Sherlock.
Sherlock woke slowly at first, but the throb in his temple and the harsh damp pavement against his face sent tendrils of recognition screaming through every pore of his body. John! John had been...where? Behind him? Yes. But...that would mean...
"You're bi." Sherlock said slowly more to himself nodding as he took a sip.
John felt his heart constrict. He loved Sherlock so completely and knew just knew that he would love him across all time and space until time folded in on itself and stars turned to dust. John wished he had the power to say fuck straight off to hell for all the wrong reasons. He was hurt and disappointed neither of which outweighed his love and bone deep desire to be with this man forever. But Sherlock needed to know that lack of trust was no basis for a lasting relationship. It was a lesson he had to learn even if it were hell on the both of them.
"You told him you love him? Oh God John, I'm so sorry. He believes that what he's doing is for the best."
“Oh. Hell no. You thought I meant with you? No.” Sally’s mouth dropped open and her eyes began to narrow. “Cause you see that freak over there,” John gestured to Sherlock with a glass in hand. “I plan on letting him fuck me speechless later and I have a feeling you’d just be in the way.”
"Answer the question." Sherlock ignored John's jab.
“Mmm. I’ve followed you this far, a shower could hurt.” Devilish eyes smiled.
“Mercy.”
"AND YOU FEEL LIKE THINGS ARINT OUT OF CONTROL NOW! Mycroft I swear, I swear if I don't get him back in one piece I am coming for you. Now tell me who I need to kill."
"Moran, if you're not up for this..."
“And that’s suppose to be a deterrent? John have you not been paying attention?” Sherlock drawled with a little suggestive sideways grin that John had come to realize ment trouble.
"I don't know what you're talking about." Sherlock took back the cigarette took the last pull and flicked it away with a flippant jut of his chin.
“He needs his rest. Please keep it brief.”
“You’re angry.” Sherlock reached for John who had backed away towards the wall.
"Indeed you did. And I told you, this isn't over." Sherlock said to the man and turned his back to leave. John didn't move.
"Closed? And what makes you think you can make me leave?"
IIEA~
Afghanistan had made John a very light, discerning sleeper. He could tell the difference between the normal sounds of the flat from something out of the ordinary. This was the latter. John disentangled himself from a still sleeping Sherlock, wished he had brought his gun from upstairs, and creeped into the sitting room. The intruder was standing over the desk when John rushed behind him and placed the man in a choke hold. He struggled and sputtered as John increased pressure while trying to decide if he was going to break his neck or not. But John lost that option when the man swung his left elbow into Johns stitches dropping him to the floor. Sherlock had heard the commotion and rushed to the sitting room just in time to catch the man before he made the stairs. Sherlock ducked a blow and swung up into the mans jaw, staggering him backwards. He smacked his head on the table on the way down, knocking him out. Sherlock flipped on the lights to find John on the floor in a hep, bleeding.
“Was this your vision of us all those months ago?” John was curious.
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. So, BAMF John. To fully understand just how bad ass he really is I thought I’d give you some facts. Enjoy.
“Get in I’ll explain on the way.” Sherlock voiced cracked with a residual chuckles.
“I suppose that band of highly specialized killers of yours are no strangers to your brand of holiday cheer.” Sherlock held up a gingerbread man ornament and squinted at the thing incredulously.
“No Sherlock! I don’t want or need your help.” John was exhausted and angry his nerves where still raw, just a few days ago he had finally found Sherlock on the verge of an overdose in a house of death all because Sherlock had believed John couldn't handle his past.
Sherlock listened to the message twice more. Each time filling in the missing words at the end they were right there, so close, he could hear John holding them back. Sherlock whispered his response into the universe.
John forced a breath puffing his cheeks and ran a hand over his face. He admitted to himself that denying his feelings for Sherlock was in no way helping his situation. He sighed and went back to looking through the scope on his sniper rifle. He was going to have to involve Mercy. Fuck.
John chuckled. “No worries kitten neither dose she. Come on, let’s get settled.”
“Copy that. Bishop come in. Over.”
"We're going to be late." Still kissing.
Paul spoke first. “I’m sure you’ve all had a chance to familiarize yourselves with the rules plainly written on the ground here. So let’s waste no time. Who would like to start us off?”
John gave a curt nod, pivoted on his heels and walked out. He made it about halfway down the narrow poorly lit black hall and just stopped, his own harsh words from months back echoing in his ears, and he laughed. No. Just no. He would not get the fuck out. Not now and not ever again. This had gone on long enough, and if one of them didn't let go of their stubborn fuckin pride, they would never find their way back to each other. Because they where both headed headlong for the grave.
“Get out.” Sherlock said from the doorway and gestured for Irene to leave.
"Of course. Whatever you want love. But call if you need me." He stood on tip toe and kissed Sherlock goodbye. Sherlock blushed and left.
“Fine.” Sherlock sprang up. “This way.” He looped his fingers into John’s waistband and tugged him in the direction of the loo. John just grinned and allowed himself to be led. As he trailed behind enjoying the view John realized he would allow this madman anything. John was also not one to give up control, one because it came naturally to him to be in charge and two because it was a rare human who could best him at all. So to feel the reins slip from his hands and not need to grab them back was revealing. This man (as John had thought many times before) was most certainly his undoing. Sherlock started a hot stream of water. “There’s your precious shower.” He turned to leave making it as far as the door.
"Please John. Can we... can I...try again?" It was difficult for Sherlock to say the words but if there was ever a time for him to be humble it was now when this man the only man who would ever matter was about to walk out of his life.
“More saline right here Pope, I can’t see the bleed! Voltaire, I need you to stop fuckin laughing!”
Free ficlet of your choice to the first person to find the TJLC, reference. The updates I've recently made have been at the request of Death_Nonie. No. New content as yet, I just hope this makes reading a bit easier.
"He'll tear me apart. I can't survive John Watson. I can't." Sherlock shoved the flask back in her hand and particularly ran from the field before she could say a word.
“Why did you come here?” John’s anger rising.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade?" A tall doctor called out into the waiting room, both Sherlock and Lestrade, stood as the man came toward them. "And this must be Sherlock Holmes, the great detective." The doctor was chipper Sherlock thought as he looked on in confusion at the mans proffered hand. Obviously this was the doctor who had worked on John, and equally obvious to Sherlock was the fact that he had very little regard for his patients. Lestrade took the doctors hand before things could get awkward and asked after John.
“Momentary...?” John paused, speechless for a split second at the absurdity of Sherlock’s words. “ You know I saw you the day you arrived. Two years ago. You stepped out of the back of something black and wildly expensive. You had a look of complete disdain. I could see a war of confidence and innocence on your face, and right then, right that very second you sucked all the light and sound out of my world. Since then I’ve been living in a vacuum of you. I tried to ignore it. You. You were 19, I was 24. It was indecent. And then it wasn’t. So it’s simple really. There *is* no choice. And no argument.”
“Christ you’re beautiful.” John said the words as his hands and trace over flesh as smooth and white as marble.
"First off you twat, it's not about me being pissed, it's because your not ready, and I'm not willing to risk you again."
"We're running out of time." He may not have said the words but Sherlock's eyes where pleading.
John could hear the rush of relief that he shared with his sister. Voltaire was the type of mad bastard that you can’t help but love, and each one of them did.
"Always your way love. But I swear you're going to be the death of me. Can we please sleep now?"
“You won’t. If you’d planned on saying no, you wouldn’t have come. “
"Captain, my captain!" Three of John's teammates effectively broke the mood.
“Stop. You’re half right. It’s not what I enjoy most. But I do like it, just with the right person.”
"What?! You mean you haven't shagged him senseless yet?"
"I already know. And you don't owe me. You'll never owe me." Sherlock held out his hand.
Our boys had just come off a beautiful and much needed holiday when Victor Trevor, showed up and caused a major upheaval.
High Holborn Street, Covent Gardens London
Also, I'm in the process of trying to find a beta, in the mean time I really need you guys to let me know if I'm being too wordy and I'm boring you all to death. Thanks in advance.
“On occasion. When it suits me.”
"Obviously."
"Their strength. Women tent to be very strong both mentally and emotionally."
“And,” John turned to face Mycroft full on cutting off his attempt at threatening with his own steel conviction “if you send them my way I will send them back to you with their heads in a box! You have no one who can touch me. That’s not a boast, and we both know it. So unless you want me to burn through your people like paper dolls I suggest we cut the bullshit.”
"Now I'm too quiet This morning you said I'd wake the dead."
“Ah, ah, ah. As a rule I don’t generally hit women unless they pick a fight. Are you picking a fight Sgt. Donovan?”
"Hum. And the young man who was outed? Was he upset?"
“My chest hurts, and I’m...hungry. And my shoulder burns.” So this simple admission came as a bit of a shock.
"Copy that J."
"J, There's a convoy headed your way, ETA ten minutes max."
"Really John? This is our starting point." Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his head fall back exasperated.
"You think that's what I'm trying to do? Drink him away? No. Never that. I'm trying to drink me away. Never him. Never. I fucked up. And so I look for redemption in every bottle." John was drinking and talking all in one. His emotions raw.
"And what exactly dose that mean for us?"
"Get me there now." John's voice faltered.
"You don't want to believe me. But you know it's true." Lestrade didn't want to hurt Sherlock, but he needed to know what he was walking into with John.
Sherlock was quiet. Mycroft caring was cringeworthy and put Sherlock very briefly in the awkward position of feeling something close to sympathy for his brothers plight. Sherlock sighed. He glanced out the window and caught sight of that robins egg blue sky that was all wrong.
“Hello there.” A young man, a very young man, early twenties, dark brown eyes, chocolate brown hair, his dicription was plan, the man himself was anything but. His eyes were dark brown yes, but not so brown as to be black these wild eyes were the color of jewel enstatite, and the chocolate hair was shot through with gold, and there was an engery about him that made Sherlock pay attention even more then his looks did. The man Sherlock thought was a spring wound too tight. Thats when it hit him...
"I've got a body that your going to want to take a look at." Lestrade offered.
-Irene, this is the right thing-
"That is their function. And they are trained..."
“Victor I...I...”
“Fine.”
“Do you know, that if I told any member of my team to put a gun in their mouth and pull the trigger they would do it? Do you know why? Because they know as insane as it may seem, that somehow I’ve got them. They trust me."
John just pulled on his jacket and walked out without looking back.
“And what?” John’s conversation (confrontation?) with the elder Holmes had left him more certain then ever that he was going to peruse things with Sherlock. And if the British Government couldn’t deter him then Mercy sure as hell wasn’t going to either.
"I was under the impression that the two of you were done. He's no longer your concern."
During John’s speech he had stood up and gathered himself back together while Sherlock had done the same.
“To catch up on old times, just the two of us. That’s all.” Victor brushed his knuckles a little too hard over Sherlock’s cheek with the most saccharine sweet smile.
It was rare that Mycroft dipped a toe into the primordial ooze of human emotion, but this man in front of him now challenging him with his fake respectful defiance was certainly stirring the very primal urge to choak the hell out of him. This was quite clearly going nowhere. Fine.
"I've got something for you."
The wait was short but agonizing. Sherlock normally looked at death with a clinical detachment, seeing it for the first time so clearly as personal and deeply meaningful was crippling.
“Fine, I have it.”
“Mmm.” Was his only response.
John's body was still screaming with need and he was incredibly uncomfortable. But he knew that Sherlock really did have questions, what had just past between them was no small thing and if Sherlock was willing to address it John wasn't going to be foolish enough to miss the opportunity to make their feelings for each other clear.
"Is she ok? I'll come with you." John sat down the cups and grabbed his trousers.
"Mmm. True, but I can't pull the rest of the team it nearly got us all killed when I left. Kronos has their hands full with Yaponchik..."
“I’m nearly there Bird, but not quite.” John never shy with his comebacks. “Full breach. Voltaire.”
“What?” John was paralyzed his hands occupied and his mind racing.  Was Sherlock going to...
"This." Moran gestured between the two of them. John shot him the finger. "Is just fine with Jim. We have a beautiful new protege at home who's dying to impress Jim, and I think Jim is rather dying to be impressed. To tell the truth I think they couldn't wait till I left."
"Fuck, fuck, fuck. He's not in the park. He's in the revisor. It's a trap Lestrade." John felt his vision swim before his eyes.
“Paris is for lovers J.” Moran held a cigarette between his pearly white teeth hand shoved deep into the pockets of his leather bomber jacket. "Did you have something in mind?” The words were delivered with Sebastian’s signature sly smile.
“Why should I? Why on earth should I?"
"That's what I need you to find out. Contact the rest of Methos and let them know. Priest knows us, how we move, we have to be careful."
“Both are perfect disrciptions, and both are wrong. From the first time you looked at me with that other worldly blue green gold gaze of yours...I’ve been hopelessly falling. Stunningly prepossessing that’s what you are. And that’s what I call you in my head. Now can we stop talking?” John sat his drink down and leaned in.
“La Ville De L’Amour.”
“J, a moment.” The meeting had ended with a ruff plan and Sherlock and Mercy headed their separate ways. Harbingers voice stopped John and he turned back to face her. “Our main objective is to retrieve the uranium. Everything else is secondary. I’m sure Her Majesty, can manage with one less subject at the end of the day.”
“Sherlock.” It was Mycroft's waring tone of a mother hen.
“Good luck J.”
“Et qu’est-ce qui vous fait penser que je n’ai pas?”
We left our boys on the run. This is the run.
“Please John, get stronger.” The words spread warmth.
"Yes John, a friend. From another time." Sherlock was being oddly short and a little evasive.
“Gorgeous.”
John snatched up his go back, gun in hand and gently gathered up his asset. John looked right into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Sherlock...”
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. I know, it’s been far too long. I’ve recently started a new job, and I’m desperately trying to balance work, and the love of our boys. I believe I’ve found a rhythm now that should work. Fingers crossed.
Did he just...?
"Uhuh." John pressed himself slow and deep into Sherlock and stopped. Sherlock bit his lips, squeezing his eyes shut his body trembled against John’s hips. “Not yet love.” John was enveloped in hungry limbs and soft wanton lips. "Let me have you a little longer." John whispered against Sherlocks lip."
"Trying...not...to. Hard." John's eyes drifted open then closed again. Sherlock tried to keep the panic out of his voice as tears clouded his vision and he ached to have the ugly blade out of his perfectly flawed beautiful solider. He wondered briefly when he had decided it was acceptable to think things like that about John outside of his mind palace. Sherlock, pushed the thought aside.
Those words. John could no long hold back. The sight of his cock, slick and wet in and out of Sherlock's body, the thick white cum covering Sherlock's belly and between his fingers as he slowly ran his hand up and down and over the head of his cock still kicking his hips up to bring John's cock flush with his bottom. John came, so hard he thought bones would snap, so completely he felt his heart would stop, so blissfully he was undone. The power of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock looked disapprovingly. “Trying to distract me.”
John reveled in the sharp bit of Sherlock’s pelvic bone grinding into his hips while he stroked Sherlock’s dick bringing him to the brink. Sherlock begs, he pleads for more for John.
“Thank you Mercy.”
So he brought us together and now he seeks to tear us apart.
Sherlock smiled. Maybe John was right.
Sherlock had to bite down on his quivering bottom lip to keep from sobbing.
This next part is very jumbled and disjointed. Don’t worry, I haven’t lost my mind (well I say haven’t) its on purpose. It’s fragmented bits and pieces and if by the end you feel a little fuzzy and confused, then I’ve done my job properly. We are seeing things from a fevered mind, catching snippets in and out of consciousness. I hope it’s not too ambitious.
“Coitus Ensues.” Sherlock leaned over into John’s space just shy of intimate and waited for his confusion.
6. What is your definition of intimate?
"Fuck Sherlock! Where are you?"
"Please." Sherlock could hardly speak or stand and clung to John.
"No. It's fine. I'm fine." Sherlock could see the truth in John's eyes. He pushed deeper, his long fingers finding John's prostate with ease. John huffed and panted with a desperation he hadn't expected. "Jesus Sherlock!" And then there was pain that canceled out everything else. John held his breath and Sherlock made to withdraw. "No." John put his hands on Sherlock's bottom and pushed him forward they both jerked sharply as John's prostate was reached again. Sherlock slid his arms up under John's shoulders and buried his face in John's neck. The friction of Sherlock's body pressed into John's cock coupled with the slick glide of his cock inside him was a combination of sweet beautiful painful madness, that rocketed John to breathless release. Sherlock's whole body trembled and jerked sporadically spilling into John with a near howl.
John tuned and gave Mycroft one of his better smiles continuing to clean his weapon.
"I think I'll just see were she ran off to." Sherlock rolled to his back and began to text.
"Sit with me." Is what John said. What he wanted to say was that he'd missed Sherlock and just wanted him close for awhile.
“Silas J? Are you sure? That’s an awful lot of fire power. Methos, is more then capable...”
“Why would I think that?” Sherlock seemed appalled.
"Well if you're referring to this suit then I wholeheartedly agree..."
“How sweet of you to notice. Now cut the crap! Are you going to see him or not?”
“The doctors say he has a long recovery, but should be back with the team within a year.”
"Not an option. We're all in Ireland working an arms deal with the IRA."
Here was his genius with the most open and genuine, expression, playing across the plans of his face and yet he still tried to hold on to the last shred of arrogance. John couldn't help but smile. He had always wondered quietly in the back of his mind, in his most private times, what this defining moment would be like. Soft, was the word that came to mind. So that's how John approached it.
"J, we have your back in all things."
No. About tomorrow’s weather.
John cut through an ally leading the would be assassin who had been following him for the better part of ten minutes. The streets of Jaipur where still a bit of a tangle for John so it had taken him a moment to find a secluded enough spot for their meeting.
John looked out the window, and saw everything in an instant. Cameras, trip wires, motion detectors. Good. He could relax for a bit. He took a quick nap. After he pulled up the dossier from Mercy.
You may want to hold off on the thanks. How much do you care about Priest?
"You can't answer my question with a question!"
"Remember when Dean Greyson, told me if he could rid the world of my kind it would be a better place?" Sherlock's hair was wind blown and his face pink and he could hardly catch his breath between words.
John, ended the call and pushed the gas pedal of the Land Rover to the floor boards.
"Sounds...interesting. How would it work?" Sherlock held out his  long arm and shook his glass for a refill. John obliged and topped his own off as well.
“Yes J?”
"The flesh is always willing." John smiled. It was all the invitation Sherlock needed. He straddled John in one fluid beautiful move. "But maybe I could just lay here and you do the heavy lifting." Sherlock tilted his head in question. "You once told me that you were no shrinking violet or some milksop afraid of a little pain, the same is true for me. I accepted you're offer that night, now accept mine." Sherlock put his hands gently on John's face, and tried to cover him in a million kisses. Kisses that began as sweet and loving that rapidly turned into passionate and descending. John pressed a bottle of lube into Sherlock's palm, Sherlock cupped his hand squeezed the bottle and made a fist until the lube made a squishing sound in his hand. First gliding up and down John's shaft, then cupping his bollocks, and finally reaching the sensitive ring of muscles and slowly advancing inside. John arched sharply and sucked breath through his teeth. Sherlock made to stop.
They say when you’re dying your life flashes before your eyes. John wasn’t sure that was entirely true. Because not a single thing passed through his minds eye except Sherlock Holmes. But then again perhaps it was. Sherlock had become his life in such a short time. When you find the person you are made to love, time becomes irrelevant. Boundaries fade and whats conventional becomes blurred. Love. Their love. It was the kind of thing that people wrote fluffy unbelievable stories about. Love that lives outside of normal confines. Love that would not conform, would not be put in it’s place. Soul deep and unending.  Till death...
“Not my type.” Sebastian tried to remain stoic, but was losing the fight with Jim moving in just the right rhythm on his lap.
"Where are you off too Adler?" Thomas came up beside her.
"Sherlock!" Johns heart soared he nearly fainted at the sight of his bloody disheveled genius as he slumped down with relief content now to let the paramedics do their job. Sherlock on the other hand could only see a blood covered John seemingly pass out, which caused a bitter cold in his chest that pushed him forward.
Please power through my mistakes, I was in a rush to publish.
"See, still on my game."
“What?! No!” Sherlock protested and moved away a little frantic. John held up a closed fist. His men froze. He went to Sherlock John took his hands and rubbed his thumbs over his knuckles.
Or did it?
Sebastian and Jim
“Yeah.”
“You’re not.” Sherlock cajoled.
“New Scotland Yard. Can I help you with anything else?” Sherlock frowned.
"John I need you to go to that game. I believe it's important that I know everything that takes place from start to finish." Sherlock was urgent.
"You're back sooner then I'd expected."
"John." Sherlock got slowly to his hands and knees, his world spinning as he did so, trying to focus on reaching the crumpled figure a few feet in front of him. Sherlock took a deep breath and righted himself, keeping his head hung low as he staggered toward John. He sunk back down next to him and felt a sickening horror when the full sight of John became clear. Blood ran from Johns body in slow black rivulet, glistening in the moon light, and darkening his jeans to a velvet black color. Sherlock was gripped by a fear and pain the likes of which he'd never known. He whispered as if speaking too loudly may cause further damage.
“You’re late.” Mercy was stern.
"What the bloody hell! Are you blind as well as dumb?" Thomas Shipton snarled in Sherlock's face.
“Forgive me. I love you.”
John found his feet first and edged closer.
If Sherlock weren’t a smart man he would have burst out laughing at the obviously frustrated bear that was John Watson. But a healthy dose of caution and intelligence kept him silent.  Good thing too, because the look John gave him was a calm before the storm if ever Sherlock had seen one.
Sherlock was paralyzed. A bucket of ice water being tossed on him by a purple elephant would have been less shocking.
"Netty Gilmore has been expelled." Sherlock exploded through the door, startling John and Irene, who'd been lazily waiting for him to return.
“Hello Cardinal.” John took the call as he braced against a damp London wind.
"Once you get rid of your moral blinders you may just be pleasantly surprised at what you're alright with Johnny boy."
"Gave us the slip soon as we got here. But the parks not that big, we'll find him."
14. How do you sleep?
"Sherlock love, look at me. Can you hear me?"
“I am, one that I’m surprised you didn’t take it.”
“Text me when you’re done here.” Sherlock tried to sound nonchalant, but after what they’d just shared that was impossible, Sherlock’s voice didn’t have that caviler tone he’d been aiming for. John made to reassure him with his response.
~Goodbyes~
"Not really according to the rule book, but for you I'll bend the rules sure." Hell I'll shatter all the rules of this world for you. John wanted to say. "It's Shakespeare. The whole skull and all."
Sebastian did turn from the window now to give Jim his full attention. Sebastian had known that Jim’s first meeting with Sherlock Holmes was going to leave him in a mood.
John finally looked up the bleachers where Irene and Sherlock were sitting. "I am. Who's asking?" John asked playfully.
Novgorod Safe House
“Then how will we communicate?” John’s voice was gruff and matched the biting kisses that mark every inch of Sherlock’s newly exposed flesh.
"Copy that Sir."
"Forever then. You need to stop that or we'll never get any sleep tonight." John tried not to jut his hips into Sherlock's touch.
Sherlock stood up and began to tuck John back into his black cargo pants kissing him with a hungry passion that John matched. John could taste the acrid bite of his cum on Sherlock’s pretty mouth, and it was everything. This beautiful creature was filthy perfection. Sherlock’s kisses peppered John’s face, before pulling John’s balaclava back down in place, running both hands over John’s now covered cheeks. “Keep your head down.” He kissed John’s lips once more and was gone. Up the alleyway into the light and gone. John felt laughter bubble up in his chest and echo off the close walls of the alley. A body on the ground stirred. John shot twice. Gun fire and laughter mixed in the air.
"So, that was..." Sherlock began, but John, cut in.
"You being angry has nothing to do with me getting back to work."
"There indeed." John raised his glass and offered to refill Sherlock's. He tilted his head in thanks and accepted.
6. What is your definition of intimate?
John moved to the other side of Sherlock’s neck, slender and still white in some places that John hadn’t assulted yet with his teeth or tongue or lips. Kisses and words were one and the same.
"Oh, dear God you're right!" Sherlock's eyes widened, and he took a long drag. Irene continued to chuckled in a gleeful yet maniacal little way. "Go away from me woman. I've got thinking to do." Sherlock shoed her away, as Irene cast an impish smile over her shoulder waving in farewell.  Sherlock walked aimlessly about the campus for who knew how long, analyzing cataloging and shelving each snapshot of his brief conversation with John. Sherlock lingered over the memory of John's roughly calloused thumb with the surprisingly gentle touch. He found himself smiling at the idea of calloused fingers being dragged over soft skin. It had been a long time since Sherlock had allowed himself to have the kind of thoughts he was currently indulging in. Which is most likely why he didn't noticed that he'd wandered into an occupied alcove, nearly bumping into the intertwined couple.
So when the words came tumbling out of Sherlock’s mouth for the very first time in a harsh jurky groan while he was riding John’s cock like the devil, it was in fact perfect.
"I'm just not certain you're ready for field work so soon.” Mycroft fained disinterest as if he really didn't care one way or the other if Sherlock went. In truth, Sherlock could see the sweat beed across the bridge of his nose an obvious sign of his brotherly worry.
“I’ve never been careless on a mission in my life.” John turned back resembling his L9A1, meticulously.
“Mycroft I’m sure whatever you have to say won’t be altered in anyway by weather I sit or stand.”
If I recall our boys were on their way to a men yes.
"Don't do that. It's not your fault that the coroners report was incomplete. You couldn't have spotted that. You knew the man was lying, it just took a moment to put the pieces together." John set about pouring two rock glasses of rich amber liquor.
“Well well well, look who’s grown a backbone. How cute.” Victor walked right into Sherlock’s space and tilted his chin up to him with one finger. “Stop it now. I’m here because I heard about this whole crime solving thing you do and it sounded like you could use some help.”
“Hello Mercy.” Her voice was uncharacteristically heavy the two simple words saying more then they should. “What is it?”
John relflects. Sherlock well he's...ugh...we're not sure.
"Greg, I think I'm in trouble. " John sounded genuinely worried.
Three days later...
The alter was used for worship. Sherlock on his knees in supplication as John cried praise to the heavens. They extolled each other to the edge of the sun needing to have and be had, Sherlock’s body practically wept for John, glistening beads of precum providing much needed lube.
"What about the Sarin?"
Later that night John and Irene talked over the events. Sherlock lay on the bed his fingers steepled resting lightly on his lips, eyes shut, naked feet in John's lap.
"Well I think those people out there came here for a wedding." John said causally.
“We never have to speak again.” Sherlock met him, and was devoured in a hungry hard pressed kiss that quickly sat them on a path with only one destination. They rise to their knees to better get rid of the barrier of clothing.
“Repeating myself. Oh how I’ve missed that. Alright. Then. Such sage advice, how could anything possibly go wrong?”
Trevor scoffed and grinned. He was bigger then John and therefore confident in his persevered advantage. A common mistake, and Trevor's third.
"Yeah. Me neither."
"Now we're stuck here in this God forsaken wilderness..."
"No. Just mates."
"Well I suppose. I didn't notice you'd left." Sherlock's voice was soft and warm. Irene watched the scene in silence.
“Donovan please don’t pretend that what you do in that head of yours passes for though.” Sherlock’s tone was dry.
“I was just suggesting a bit of a cuddle.” John tried to reason more to himself then to the predator approaching.
“Stop trying to spare me Mercy. Who is it?” John could hear her suck in a deep breath before she rushed into the words.
"More then friends." There was a hit of a question to Johns words, that Sherlock did not miss.
John found that in that moment he was more aroused then he had any right to be.
*”At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18—, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library.”*
"Oh please God above tell me you still remember it?!"
“Thank you Mercy.”
"Dangerous?" Sherlock offered.
"You're such an idiot. I didn't leave because I stopped loving you,  I left because I couldn't stop loving you. Never have. Never will."
To Irene John always seemed to be on the verge of tears. In a constant melancholy haze. A pained fake smile his only companion, save for those rare occasions (like this one) when he would allow Irene a moment or two. They would sit together not speaking. There was no real need for words. Pain was the unspoken language they sheared.
"Hello Mercy."
Irene let herself in and stumbled into pitch blackness. She huffed and shut the door behind her. She stood in place and felt in her pocket for her cigarette lighter.  She flicked it creating a small circle of light, lit her cigarette and turned to flick on the lights.
“Hello J.”
"Really John? This is our starting point." Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his head fall back exasperated.
"And so we tell them."
“Look at you Dr. Watson. You cut quite the picture in your tux. Very 007. I’m sure Sherlock would eat alive if he saw you. Where is he by the way?” Jim asked casually enough but it was obviously that had been his burning question.
When Sherlock blinked his eyes open painfully and slowly he could just make out Thomas walking far off across the campus lawn. So he deduce that he hadn't been out very long, and tried to stand. His head screamed with pain and his legs were wobbly. Fighting down the urge to vomit, Sherlock braced himself on the wall and started his trek back to his room. The blood from his nose had dried and he could feel a lump just above his right eye. He knew he must have looked a mass and was glad for the lack of people he encountered. But as fate would have it Sherlock did manage to cross paths with just one person on this struggle home. John Watson. Sherlock could see his building less then a block away he pulled out his keys and kept his focus on his goal. Clutching his coat and scarf tight at the neck and keeping one hand free for balance, he didn't notice the young man run up beside him and clap him on the shoulder until he was nearly knocked to the ground from the force.
John laughed at the sheer ridiculousness of his life.
Oh God yes! Was lovely. We’re planing a whole big thing for the next time.
Time to go to work.
"God damn it Sherlock! I'll tell him myself!" Irene was at her wits end with him.
John's reaction was visceral. The urge to vomit was nearly overwhelming. Unable to speak. Too many emotions rushed through him. First of which was a murderous rage for Thomas Shipton. Second was anger at himself for being blind to the obvious. Third was a fierce determination. Sherlock was precious, and if it took a life time John would make certain he knew it. He smiled to him and started to leave. Irene was confused.
“You’d shoot me?” Sherlock’s baritone echoed off the walls of old windowless building.
“Sherlock is every inch a grown man, and I don’t give two fucks about him being your brother.” John stated calmly but grinned to himself at the mention of inches and placed his gun on the table.
“The waters getting cold.” Sherlock seemed in no rush.
“I thought the plan was to allow myself to be captured? This looks more like a kill box.”
“If you like.” Sebastian answered without taking his eyes from the window.
Sherlock reached out to touch John's left shoulder.
1. What do you find attractive in a woman?
“No worries, these things take time.”
“Weapons grade uranium anyone?” Odin’s deep voice bellowed as he came into view pulling the yellow cake uranium behind him with the rest of the team following close. “Oi. What’s the hold up then?l”
"I should tell you that against your orders, I did not in fact cut all coms for Angus Og, nor did I cut the call sign. I followed a lead and came up with some interesting intel."
But John didn't have to imagine, because that was his reality. When he'd walked back into small dressing room John had planned on kissing the man he loved and never again letting go. Now he was struggling to get him breathing again and call 999.
“You have the power to make it stop. You want me out of Sherlock’s life for his safety. Well the truth of the matter is he wasn’t all that safe before I came along. I am the best at what I do, and I love your brother.”
"Alright then, let's talk about the unrealistic supply of condoms." Now John was the one laughing, and he too took another sip, well on his way to a nice mellow.
“Finland.” John left the window he’d been looking out and brought his asset a bottle of water.
“Sebastian Moran. He was chosen for this particular opt because he speaks...”
“Do you have a timeline?”
“It turned out to be a bit of a rough ride Sir. I thought to spare you.” John spoke without turning away from the window.
Sherlock stood stock still. He hadn't known. He simply hadn't known. What little color was in his face drained away, he felt like he would vomit. The people he had watching John hadn't told him, they (Mycroft and Molly ) had told him that John was doing as well as could be expected. This is what they had expected?Sherlock had felt at the time that this was accurate and hadn't pushed feather. And although he had been concerned for John, Sherlock had to look at the bigger picture. John could endure a small amount of grief if it led to his ultimate safety, even if he didn't yet know it himself. John was a strong man, a soldier. Hurt yes, but broken? Not John. Not his John. He couldn't care that much, could he?
The Hoard.  Four six man teams, each with their own team leader who reports directly back to The Hoard leader. Ard Ri (High King)
“Your team...they are close?” Sherlock approches his words carefully, tentative with down cast eyes. This was ground they had yet to cover and Sherlock was concerned about how John’s team would receive him. The babysitting detail hadn’t given him much of an opportunity to get to know (or deduce) them. This trip to Pairs would be deeply intimate.
"To be perfectly honest. Nothing. I don't generally find woman attractive, admirable, yes but attractive? Not really my area."
This chapter is lovingly dedicated to the always magnificent PatPrecieux...why you may say? If you know Pat you know why. If not well for the sheer joy of putting a smile on her face. Let's hope it works.
"And what if I don't want you to look in on me tomorrow?"
"Right. Come with me?" John layed back down and beckoned to Sherlock who joined him.
"I can't keep you safe here!" Sherlock's voice was frantic and he paced back and forth like a caged panther.
"You broke a mans nose."

Sherlock huffed a laugh.
"Time? It's been three fuckin weeks and they havent been found yet!"

"No. Well yes. But not for the reason you think. I believe that there's more to this game, somethings wrong, you wouldn't understand"
“Did you miss me love?” John approached dropping his spent clip from his Browning and reloading.
4:48 pm
Sherlock frowned and he choked a bit when he spoke again.
“So now I’m yours?” Sherlock was in a playful mood, having been away from John for what felt like a long time, being back in his presence now made Sherlock almost giddy.
“Harbinger wants us back. But I wanted to give you a heads up on the plan. Not only are you not going to like it, you’re going to hate it.”
John took in this information with a nod, and made a mental note to smell his cologne later.
"Nope. I think I'll let you get all of your predictable questions out of the way first."
“I should go.” Sherlock was flushed and a little disheveled and so pretty it hurt.
"And if I say they don't?"
“You...” Sally puffed up and was about to unleash a tirade when John stopped her.
"I have a working theory." Sherlock broke in suddenly and a little too loudly.
"Spot on. In fairness I have to tell you, we're not dealing with uranium. The facility is indeed a lab, but not a nuclear one, a chemical one. There are four scientists total Sherlock among them, their making...Sarin."
"You didn't have to do that." Sherlock tried not to smile, but having John help him felt too good.
“Yes well...” John let his words hang in the air for two reasons. One he wasn’t going to tell Mercy, that since Sherlock Holmes, the thought of being with anyone else seemed...wrong, and two he had just spotted Jim Moriarty across the room and his aptly named Tiger, approaching to John’s left. Why were they here? “Mercy, we may have a problem.”
”Don't take that tone with me.”
“The moon then. So you’re one of those astrology people? Into all that moon and stars stuff.  Did the freak get you into it? I hear he’s into some pretty strange stuff.”
John, made a humorless sound that was once a laugh.
Lestrade looked John over. “Sounds about right. You played a spot of rugby in your day didn’t you?”
"You know my answer." Sherlock remained stoic.
“Is that all?” John felt an unexpected stab at the thought.
Instead of giving John a response, Sherlock held his gaze and continued to shed more clothing.  He didn't trust himself to speak knowing that his time with John was coming to an end. He pulled his button up free from his from his jeans and toed off his shoes.
"It is. And it isn't. Humor me." Bishop pressed on.
-Yours Alone-
"Shut up." The steel, the anger, the force, where unmistakable. John rippped Sherlock out of his Belstaff, and pushed him back into his chair. John heeled out of his shoes and threw off his own jacket, placing a knee in between Sherlock thighs, leaning into a ferocious kiss. Sherlock tried to reach for Johns waist only to have his hands smacked away. John stood, and Sherlock held his breath as he watched John strip, down to his pants.
“Getting you to stop seeing John Watson, obviously. Really Sherlock wheres your mind?” Mycroft was annoyed by all the talking.
(The City of Lights)
"You're right, it's not important finding him and bringing him home is. So...how do we proceed? I have a feeling this is going to be more then a one man job."
"Of corse J."
“Oh Mercy, ever the optimism.”
“We have to be. What we do doesn’t work unless you trust the person beside you implicitly.” John sipped at his tea, and waited. Sherlock was picking through his thought process.
Sherlock's face blanched and his eyes glassed over with unshed tears. "Where did you get that?" Sherlock asked just above a whisper, taking a fraction of a step back. "You where never supposed to see that. Never supposed to know." He said the last so softly John nearly missed it.
“This can’t be what you had in mind as a holiday.” Sherlock murmured turning his face up.
Was it 1800 something? Is that why it’s so cold? Is it cold? John’s fever consumed brain searched for answers.
"Nothing as of yet."
“I said, can you get undressed yourself or do you need my help?”
An announcement broke into the surrounding chatter.
Never.
“Viktor and Rolf ‘Flowerbomb.’ Woman.” Sherlock said as more of a statement then a question as he came around the corner face to face with said woman.
Marijampolės savivaldybė, Lithuania
"Revealed." Sherlock upended his glass, like a man resolved to his fate.
"Tell John..." Thomas spoke in a snarl.
“I’d like that.” John was sincere, he hadn’t played rugby in years but he would love to get out there in the mud.
"Yes I can. I do what I want. And that's why I'll be to look in on you tomorrow. Now sleep." John took Sherlock's cup and sat both on the bedside table, he straightened out his legs crossed them at the ankles, folded his arms and closed his eyes.
"Nope. I think I'll let you get all of your predictable questions out of the way first."
7:02am Sunday
Keep your head down John.
“With you is what I had in mind.” John tilted down to kiss perfect lips.
The young man who’d hurt Sherlock in so many ways was supposedly shipped off to a different school somewhere in Wales. Sherlock was never able to find a record of him. From then on he’d kept his distance with his lovers not that he’d been in any danger of falling for one of them, his lovers had at best been no more then tolerable and none had made any type of lasting impression. John Watson had changed the game entirely. John was the sun. Brilliant and powerful and necessary for life. He made Sherlock’s analytical mind work in poetic ways produced a well spring of emotion Sherlock hadn’t known himself capable of. Lust that distracted and consumed coupled with a beautiful heartache. Yes. John was the Sun. John was beyond Sherlock’s dreams. Sherlock’s dreams? Hell a dreams as grand as John had never even occurred to Sherlock. Now he found himself practically quoting Shakespeare and seriously contemplating a tattoo. Dangerous. Period.
“John.” Sigh. Kiss. “John.” It was a powerful vibrating rumble that resonated in John’s soul. It was the preamble to words that John knew could not bare.
At some point in his speech Sherlock had stood up, and John realized with something akin to elation that Sherlock was taking off his clothes as he spoke. By the time he was done talking he was standing inches away from John, completely utterly beautifully naked.  The fire light danced over the pale canvas touching things John had only dreamt of, and he found that he was quite jealous of the fire light in that moment.
"Yes Sir. She said she can't work like this and walked out."
"Not a very modest one."
"Of course." Sherlock rolled his eyes and gave a crooked smile. "I'll be there.  But only because I owe you for last night."
Working out the working theory.
"Complicated." With a tilt of his head John raised his eyebrows in an unasked question.
“See you in twelve hours Mercy.” She could hear the smile in John’s voice.
Sebastian studied the psychopath in front of him. He had known Jim was insane from the moment they’d met, but to be honest that was half the attraction. It was the epitome of playing with fire. This was the man he loved. The man he killed for, would die for.
"So which one was it this time Watson, the bird or the bloke?" Greg asked as he rounder the pitch after his lap.
“No.”
"Sherlock, why in the hell is there a big blue box at 221b?" John was past the point of surprise with all things Sherlock, but this box was more of a curiosity then usual.
Darkness and unrelenting cold tugged at John’s limbs, begging him to stay.
One Week Later
"I think I like that." John grinned.
"I told you! You fuckin wanker!" The criminal pointed at Sherlock as he yelled. John flinched a bit at the curse, holding back his urge to protect.
"More." The word was a doubles entendre, and John was almost shock by the wickedness that lit Sherlock's eyes just before he swooped in for another kiss. Still soft, but more sure with an urgency, that John found intoxicating. Sherlock was on his knees now, nestled in between Johns, one hand resting high up on Johns left thigh, the other planted dead enter of Johns chest. John tried to keep things slow, but this kiss was building into something else. The hand that had rested on his chest was now a fist full of his button down, where the thumb of Sherlock's other hand slid back and forth over his thigh causing a dangerous reaction.  John moved forward in his chair a bit, parting his legs, settling Sherlock's body against his. And that's when things changed.  The kissing stopped. And Sherlock pulled back just enough to look down at the bulge in Johns trousers. When he looked back up at John his eyes where wide. But not with fear, no more like wonder. His chest was heaving, his lips where a pink John had never seen, and his eyes...god those eyes. John was gripping the arms of his chair with both hands, and his whole body trembled. Slowly, he let himself touch Sherlock's face, brushing his knuckles over his cheekbone, down to the corner of his mouth where Sherlock turned and ghosted a few light kisses to Johns knuckles. Johns breath stopped. This was the most erotic thing he'd ever seen. He buried both his hands in Sherlock's curls, and tugged his head back, hungry exposing the slander bow of his neck, and that one freckle, that one that had taunted and teased him for years, John put his mouth over that spot and sucked. Sherlock jerked, his grasp on John became tighter, their bodies closer now moving against each other. Everything was a frenzy of kiss and motion, and sound. John was suffering the sweetest possible death imaginable, his cock throbbing against the fabric of his pants, it was painful, he wanted it to stop, he never wanted it to stop. But it had to. Didn't it? Wasn't this all moving far too fast for Sherlock? John slowed the kiss to a stop and pulled back, not away, just creating the smallest amount of space.
“Kiss me.” John held out the scotch to Sherlock.
“Don’t be. He’s exposed now. And after tonight I don’t think anyone else will be in danger of being kicked out of Kings, simply because of who they love.” Sherlock kissed John’s red knuckles and ran his thumb lightly over the bruising. “Why did you punch him?”
"You really don't know how relationships work do you?" John shook his head. "Yes I'll help you, in this and in all things. Without question."
"Agreed. I'll have intel for you ASAP."
"Right then. Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes. For now." They shook hands, the man stepped into the blue box, and the door clicked shut behind him.
"John you must try with all your strength not to die. I have..." Sherlock wasn't sure where he was going with this, he just knew he would say or do anything to keep John alive. "A secret...yes I have a secret to tell you which I obviously can not do, if you insist on dying."
No John. I don’t think you *can* lose me. And just because some of the people you and I persue move in the same circles is no need to worry.
"Why would you do that, it's not as if I where going to get up and walk away."
“Copy that Sir. Over” Odin couldn’t keep the laughter from his voice.
"He's a civilian. In our safe house. It wasn't that long ago he was an asset." Bishop sat forward elbows resting on knees.
“MI6.” His voice was low and full of gravel. But there was  something to it, in it. “Spy. No, assassin. Wrong...”
“This isn’t turning out to be the opt we planned.”
"That's what he'll say. But I won't stop, not until he bleeds his life away for me. Just like all the others." That's when he lasted out, messy but quick, catching Sherlock across the chest opening a long gash. Sherlock hissed in pain but was not deterred.
The sound of the mobile was blaring to Johns ears. He had only fallen asleep an hour ago and the sun was barely up even now. Sherlock was like a twenty year old in a cock candy store. He reluctantly turned his face away from the honey scented curls he had been breathing in and gopped for his mobile off Sherlock's nightstand, his voice was ragged.
“I do.” Sherlock’s voice was a little shrill.
Sherlock often found himself regretting the fact that Irene had expertly deduced his attraction to John. She was rather good at spotting the things that people liked. She'd caught Sherlock on more then one occasion stop dead in his tracks just to watch John pass by. She had asked Sherlock countless times to go down to the pitch with her, and each time he had forced himself to decline. But today, in the sprit of truth or dare...
With that said John reached a hand up to the back of Sherlock's neck guiding him down to meet his lips, in what was little more then warmth and texture pressed together for the space of what was no more then three second. John walked away as if this happened everyday. Sherlock blinked after Johns retreating back. He was simply made of questions.
“Leave.”
The Diogenes Club
“Sherlock I really can’t see...”
"Oh John don't be silly, I am happy. I have you." The words where meant to sound causal and lighthearted. But to John they were profound. To John they meant that everything he wanted for Sherlock was right there in him. His mind spun with possibly.  John chose his next question with care.
Sherlock reached his hand down between their bodies and wrapped his hand as best he could around both their cocks, precum creating a beautiful maddening friction. John tried to squeezed his thighs together and pressed his head back into the pillow, rocking his hips into Sherlock's fist. God, he was close. He had to break Sherlock's complete domination over him if he didn't want to cum in Sherlock's hand in the next five seconds. John shifted his hand reluctantly from Sherlock's perfect bottom, to run his middle finger down Sherlock's coccyx, down again to the tight ring of muscles, causing Sherlock's rythme on their cocks to falter just enough for John to gain control. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's narrow frame and flipped him over with ease. Sherlock's breath came out in a rush of surprise. John sat back on his heels and pulled Sherlock into his lap spreading his legs wide. John sucked his middle finger wet and pushed inside Sherlock's wanton quivering body, Sherlock bucked into the pleasure with a long low moan.
John shook his head in the negative. "I still don't understand."
Sarcasm.
John?
"And Hillsten?" The officer jabbed his thumb to the left. "Thank you Collins." Lestrade walked over to the pile of rubble where Hillstan, was nursing his injury as best he could. "So let's have a look at you then." He bent down to have a closer look. "Not too bad. Look someone should have...I should have told you this the day you started. Don't get between those two. We've all learned the hard way, that those two are...like..."
“Holmes the elder. Come to see me off? Give us a kiss.”
John half smiled. "Something like that. And just so you know Bishop, he'd kick your ass if he heard you say that."
“Here? In the church?” Sebastian asked as Jim roughly palmed his cock.
"Say what you mean Mercy."
"Someone is going to know you're face." Mycroft said trying to to give in.
"What about him?"
Tbilisi, Georgia
"Hell no! I'm ass over teakettle for him." John's smile was spread across his face and he ran off without a second glance.
"Oh please God above tell me you still remember it?!"
John just glared at the man unable to form words. He was shaking, his rage was so great.
“Hello Tiger.” The blond spoke in a lazy disinterested way.
"Sherlock." John called through the door.
John sat up a little and Sherlock lay in the crook of John's arm and looked up at him. "You beautiful idiot. I have always been all yours. If this is what you want..."
"And what would you suggest then Mycroft? You send one of your toy soldiers?"
“Sorry Bro. No can do.” Sherlock exited the building.
"Your brains been rattled." Irene giggling and dogged a smack.
Sherlock thought he would cry, his heart beat was desperate. The world stopped, his breath stopped and everything focused into one blinding white hot point of surrender. Ever muscle coiled to the point of snapping he let go. “John, John....oh god fuck John!” Heat erupted between them as his cock spilled across their bellies.
“Nice of you to join us J.” Harbinger offered the words as John took his chair.
"Why are you crying?"
The door to Sherlock’s rooms were slightly open. Odd that. John pulled his weapon, and stepped inside.
"Where exactly?"
John had worked frantically to save his friends life as his own blood  blurred his vision from a gash in his head and stitched up a femoral artery on his knees in the dirt.
“The...The sun. Yes. The sun is wrong. It’s wrong...it’s all....just. It’s not...not right John. Without...”
Lestrade, pulled into the ambulance bay just as the EMTs, where wheeling John around the corner.
“I want to, really I do.” Sherlock sounded like the young and doubtful student of their uni days.
John won’t back down. Sherlock won’t see reason. Who’s will is greater? Please forgive me for taking so very very long to update. Just know that as long as I am able I won’t leave a fic unfinished.
This chapter is dedicated to Snowrabbit, who was looking for a little more John/Sherlock interaction. Now I’m not sure if this is what you had in mind...but this was already in the works when you asked. I hope it fills a need. A thousand times thank you for your request.
“Well you do cut quite the figure in your fatigues. Sherlock would eat you alive!” Irene chuckled.
"Over here!"
"He's a civilian, it took next to nothing to break him."
"I don't know where his is." Johns voice broke the slightest bit. "Fuck you don't know where he is." John closed his eyes and made a sound that could only be called a sob. "Why are you here? Why are you here Mycroft? What the fuck do you want?" John leaned his head back on the sofa, eyes closed his glass resting in his lap, bottle white knuckled in his left hand.
"Finsbury."
"Hello J."
"I need someone tracked and surveilled."
“Why love? It’s not true.” Sherlock said with a nervous chuckle and looked away.
“You were...dead.” Sherlock whispered. It hurt to say the words even in the face of their falsehood. “Mycroft...he...told me...you were...I came here...just to...be with you somehow. John...I thought you were...you were...” It was no use. The tears would have their way and clearly they were not done with him yet. Sherlock buried his face in John’s chest.
"I do. Thank you Elliot." Sherlock extended his hand, Elliot gave it a rueful look, and a firm shake.
"Never."
"I do believe Kronos is in the region."
“Then John John, gets thrown out of Kings, just like all the rest of the freaks and yes, my uncle will make sure that he’s turned away from every other uni in England. And if some how that doesn’t work, so help me god if I have to spend every penny I own I’ll make damn sure of it!”
"Keep the temperature low, we don't want to corrupt any evidence. John." Sherlock walked out into one of the little used back corridors. John close behind. Lestrade went out the front saying he'd be back in an hour. Sherlock practically threw himself against the wall and huffed. John took his place next to him.
"Do you know why I kissed you?" John was straight forward.
“Of course Love.” John’s smile beamed in the dark alley and warmed Sherlock more then his Belstaff ever could.
"How's that for accuracy wanker? Did you follow me here? You did didn't you?"
"I require an answer."  John took a sip and folded his arms.
"John I'm sorry. He's left. He's scared to death. He just needs time to think." Even as Irene said the words she knew that that was the last thing Sherlock needed to do. Given time he would rationalize a million different bullshit reasons to run away. "Sod this. Talk to him. He's a fool John and he's scared."
"Why Sherlock? Why didn't you tell me?" All the heat was gone out of John's voice, now there was just exhaustion.
"John!" John was brought out of his mind by Moran's voice and he realized his hand just hovered, not touching not moving not finding out if Sherlock were alive or dead. Fuck. He reached into the balled up mass to rest two fingers in the hollow of Sherlock's throat. Ice cold, and drenched in sweat. John thanked God. He thanked the old Gods, he thanked all the Gods, he thanked any Gods! He didn’t know or care who was listening or what the price. His soul had been forfeit from the second he and Sherlock had locked eyes.
“Her Majesty sends her thanks, one hell of a lot of money and a final request.”
Needless to say, Sherlock had never been in love. He’d never even come close. The thought of losing his heart to someone had never even entered his mind, because for Sherlock sex and love were in no way related. Sex was a distraction that could sometimes be used as a means to an end. Love was dangerous period. He tried the boyfriend thing in uni. (Hell he’d even tried the girlfriend thing, which he had found out exceedingly quickly was most certainly not his area.) It had all ended badly, leaving Sherlock with scars both visible and emotional. When Mycroft had found him in his dorm room one weekend with a nasty head wound in a pool of his own blood, he had raged at Sherlock for getting sentimental and letting this happen.
John’s control was no better lost to the heart pounding up and down on Sherlock’s cock, edging closer so quickly towards the boiling prostate orgasm. John encircled Sherlock’s throat with one hand, the other hand guided Sherlock’s hand to John’s painfully rock hard dick. John rocked on Sherlock’s shaft no longer up and down but grinding and jutting his hips back and forth his cock slinging in Sherlock’s clenched fist.
"And here I thought the kiss had you rattled." Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, and then snapped it shut, his lips a thin line. He tried again.
“How did you know?” John flat out asked.
"No." John said for the second time.
"They must have."
"Yes John." Sherlock rolled to his side and rested his mostly naked body against John. Jesus this was going to be a long night.
Sebastian looked around and whistled. "That's some impressive shit Watson."
"Good lord man, he offered you tea, not a blowjob. Although one of those would be nice. Sherlock did give the most spine tingling blow jobs."
“Cardinal come in. Over.” John broke radio silence from his hidden position in the tree line.
~Ellora Temple~
“For..a..a long while.” Sherlock’s internal monologue filled to bursting with screaming objections, but for once he kept quite. Not because his better angles had finally won out, no, because the indescribable heartache was swallowing his abliy to speak. Love was as cruel as it was exulted. Sherlock longed to cover John in words of love, but why? They knew. Had known for some time now. There was no need for the soul crushing pain the words would bring.
Jim dropped the binoculars and approached Sebastian single minded.
“John.”  Sherlock’s eyes where pleading. “We should go.”
"Oh fuck, should I be worried?" A look of horror graced John's face.
"Dose everyone in your family have odd names?"
“Alright alright, just will you come?” Lestrade looked as if he were about to make one last attempt and that’s when Sherlock took action, he took the D.I. by the arm and lead him none too gently back down the seventeen steps.
Misunderstandings lead to more misunderstandings.
Well...Mycroft.
No one knew where they'd come from and apparently no one cared. The invitation of the mystery was too tantalizing for any amount of caution. Sherlock thought it was stupid. Who would want to play a game of risk and exposure with people you don't know? Mostly he was turned off by the prospect of people. The other bits where rather interesting if he were honest. But it didn't matter one way or the other because Sherlock wasn't one of the chosen students to receive a flyer on his door. Not the he wanted some idiotic invite to a childish game. Well maybe for the research. Into human behavior. Sherlock did know a couple of the people that had gotten flyers and was relatively certain that he could gain some decent (even if it wasn't completely accurate) information on the whole mystery from one of them. Sherlock took a deep breath and resigned himself to the fact that he was going to have to deal with Irene Adler. He sighed. He and Irene were friends of sorts. He'd known her for the two years he'd been at King's, and they got on well enough. She wasn't a complete moron and even though she continually made useless attempts to get in his trousers (that were by now almost obligatory)she did have a wicked sense of humor and an odd kind of affection for Sherlock and she was always up for a bit of mischief. So Sherlock didn't think it would be to much trouble to convince her to his plan.
“Did you receive the intel?”
December 22nd.
“And if I decline?” Sherlock’s chin jutted up.
"Fine. But we're going to need more scotch." John gestured for Sherlock to go make a new selection. With a raised eyebrow the younger man took off. Sherlock came back with a bottle of Macallan Sherrywood 40 year old single malt scotch that cousin Brandabas was sure to miss. Sherlock sank back down on the floor across from John in the same manner as before. Toes brushing waist band. He pored a rock glass for John one for himself and settled in.
"Because...I just don't want you to be alone. You're a good man Sherlock, you should be happy."
John's hand involuntary moved to grab his own fully swollen erection. Sherlock winced at the gesture as if the two members were one. Sherlock rushed forward, John rose to meet him. Their bodies came together hot and hard, need the driving force. Sherlock wrapped long arms behind John and slid his hands into John's pants, Sherlock's large hands pressed John's firm ass bringing their cocks hard and close together. But not close enough. John let his head fall forward and rest on Sherlock's collar bone, John's teeth soon found sensitive flesh, followed by his lips and tongue Sherlock moaned like a rumble of thunder and rocked and pressed John closer still, working his pants off in the process. All the while John's hands mirrored Sherlock's. Sherlock felt John large and full against his belly now.
“That’s brilliant. And incredibly dangerous. Now I see how you fell into the hands of the Russian’s. I’m shocked as shit I didn’t have to come rescue you sooner. You live a very interesting life Sherlock Holmes.”
"Mmm." Was Sherlock's only answer, John felt it was a solid yes and sat about making two cups.
“The Queens Weapon? Isn’t that a bit I don’t know dramatic?” John looked down at Sherlock’s playful eyes. God he was beautiful.
“Sherlock, please.” John pleaded already so caught up his cock strained painfully against his zipper. “I’m covered in sweat and dirt and..”
“I want to fuck you now.”  Johns voice was a growl and seemed to be tethered to Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock whimpered and reached for John’s cock only to have his wrist firmly clamped down beside him. “Don't. If you touch me with those beautiful delicate hands of yours, I’ll cum so fast, hot and thick between your fingers, and we don’t want that now do we love?" Sherlock’s only answer was the sound of total surrender. John pressed his cock hard into Sherlock’s thigh rutting against him, precum and sweat causing a delicious friction. John quickly moved to position himself between Sherlock’s thighs. John licked his fingers wet and coaxed into Sherlock’s heat. "Open for me." John demanded. Sherlock forgot to breathe bent his knees and let them fall apart, John worked his fingers inside Sherlock and stroked his cock. John bent close and made wet circles with his tongue while sucking at his balls. Sherlock cursed and tugged at shot cropped hair pushing against John’s fingers and mouth. Percum, slicked the length of Sherlock’s cock where John kept his mouth focused. Sherlock rocked and clutched at sheets frantic to reach a destination that John kept vearing away from. John slowed to a stop and rested his hands on the inside of Sherlock’s quivering thighs, moving to press his cock against Sherlock’s slick heat seeking entrance. The mans skin was flushed pink with arousal his cock jerked with each heave of his chest and thump of his heart. The look Sherlock gave John was lust personified, bright eyes, parted lips and tousled curls. Sherlock gave John a sinful smile to top off the look and slid a bottle of lube from under his pillow. “You’re unreal.”
“All true. But Mercy, is my twin.”
"John I need you."  Sherlock's voice raspy, his hands screeching, digging into flesh, thin fingers finding John's satin hot rock hard length. They both jerked at the touch. Sherlock felt his stomach roll and his own cock quiver. "Let me have you." He tugged gently. Possessively.
"To no end."
“How positively magnanimous of you.” Sherlock pulled a face all sass. No anger, the mood was as it had been, warm loving and fun. In a word, Happy.
"What a surprise. I'll just get my coat."
"Nothing. I was mearly saying that had John been here he would have noticed the ligature marks on the wrist and ankles and not have foolishly assumed that five perfectly healthy adults had all suddenly and simultaneously died of natural causes. I mean really George, how stupid is she?"
“Now that I’ve met yours, I’d like you to meet mine.”
“Get off me!”
Where are you?
"Hello." John's voice was soft, his demeanor relaxed and the ocean blue of his eyes was a tranquil sea. "Ready?"
The park was staged as usual. Sherlock stood in the shadows observing the students talking among themselves in hushed excited tones waiting on what they were not sure, but the wait was not long. Thomas and Paul arrived shortly. Sherlock couldn’t help but think how much they looked like a couple, despite all of Thomas’s bluster.
"There was no need for us to do the same. He wasn't some dossier for us to go poking around in. He was mine. Is mine." John breathed a heavy sigh into the phone. "We should have done our due diligence yes, but I knew, I'm a doctor for fuck sake of corse I knew. I just...I just never thought it was important. It's not. Not to me."
“But J, it’s a bomb! I love bombs!”
"Oh come on. When you see a woman and you find her attractive what is it that draws you to her?"
“Yes well one can never be too...” he let the words trail off and waved them away dismissively. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Aren’t you just the bell of the ball. The Russian’s. The Russian’s wanted you. They wanted you very much. How did that feel?”
"No buts! Go back to your flat and sort your shit out! And don't come back to my station house until you do!"

"When we...when I pushed you away all those months ago, from the second you where gone...I wanted you back." John paced slowly in front of Sherlock who sat legs Indian style on the sofa. "I hoped that we would find each other again one day. And if we did, I wanted a fresh start. Away from London. Away from our past, not forever. Just some place quite. If you don't like it...or you'd prefer to stay here alone, I'll understand. "
"You never said I had to be honest."
"Moran."

"I require an answer."  John took a sip and folded his arms.
Did you love him?
"Oh yes well that. A friend asked me to keep it for him for a time." Sherlock answered off handedly.
John turned around to face Sherlock. “And I would let you. If it weren’t still mission critical.  Now keep what I’m sure is a lovely cock in your trousers for me just a little while longer.”Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffed. John nodded and backed away before it was too late.
“Hello J.”
"I was never supposed to know that you loved me as much as I loved you?" John was confused and hurt."Why?"
“And what do these new developments have to do with me?”
"Oh please you lanky git! I'm pissed because you didn't tell me!" Irene smacked Sherlock's arm.
"Marry me?" John was too emotional to say more. He stepped close and looked up into Sherlock's aqua blue green gold eyes.
“It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Ouch! What’s that for?” John rubbed at his assaulted ear.
"More John, oh please God John, more. Yes.yes!" Sherlock brought his knees up level with John's shoulders, reached down and splayed his hands on John's bottom, gripping, grinding, feeling John's muscles work at a feverish pace.
I apologize for the shortness of this chapter, but it's been a while since I updated so I really wanted to put out what I had done.
“Not that easy.” Moran’s voice was choked and betrayed his pain. “Just a little rattled.” The grenade ripped the night air with lethal blinding force.
What happened next was so quick that it was over before anyone had time to react. John came from nowhere and everywhere all at once. I loud crack rent the air and blood exploded from Thomas’s nose. He howled, Paul moved to Thomas’s side and tried to move Thomas’s hands to see the damage.
"And what would that be?" Sherlock asked gathering up his scarf and glover.
In order to kill four grown men in their homes, in their sleep, one needs to be clever. This man was. So much so that he had even managed to send Sherlock a clue through his lackey. Hornsey Wood Reservoir, is what the idiot had said first, when he told Sherlock the meeting place he had later changed it to Finsbury Park. And even though the two where close in distance there was no way for even the foolish to confuse the two. The lackey must have himself met the butcher at Hornsby Wood. That's where Sherlock would find him. Getting away from New Scotland Yards finest, well that was the easy part. Sherlock could be quite the actor when the need called for it. The hard part, had been not responding to Johns text. He knew that John would worry. He knew that John would come after him. But Sherlock had to ignore the guilt? He felt. This monster needed to be dealt with, innocence people where dying and as if that weren't enough, he had hurt John. And that Sherlock would simply not let stand.
