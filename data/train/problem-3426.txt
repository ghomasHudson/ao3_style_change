“That was the first time many of the people we care about met each other,” comments Cas.
“Well, she’s right, but I don’t need to be so angry I can’t talk to you. You want to try maybe tomorrow after we both have a night to sleep on it.”
“You’re too good to me, sweetheart.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A jump back in time to see how Jack's friend got invited to the Christmas break holiday.
should tell her that,”grumbles Sam.
When he joins them, he sees Mary on the couch with Miracle in her lap and Cas in the kitchen getting a pot of coffee going. He goes to sit next to her and give Miracle a pat. “Hey mom. I know we’re all still getting used to time in Heaven, but aren’t you here a bit early for our Game Night?”
Sam's juicer is the Omega Cube Nutrition System Juicer. YES, I KNOW!
“Castiel was the angel of Thursday,”
Kelly asks, “So what makes it a Bloody Viking instead of a Bloody Mary?”
Sam rolls his eyes. “Ha ha. Like we haven’t all gotten tattoos before.”
“Cas, you’re the expert on Mel. What did you think?” Sam asks.
“Bye!”
“Me, too,” says Donna.
Dean, Sam and Jack come down and Jack is immediately surrounded by Kelly, Eileen, Cas and Charlie ready to gush over him. Even Gertie comes up and asks to inspect the design of the knitted sweater. Jeremy gives Jack a wave as a joke, since he’s half-hidden behind so many people.
Patience’s brow crinkles and she asks, “Have you experienced anything psychic?”
“Hey boy, c’mere,”says Jack, reaching out an hand. Miracle looks like he’s about to let Jack get him, and then zooms over to one of the living room couches, where he jumps on, then off again. When Jeremy reaches the foyer, Miracle sees the opportunity to repeat his performance, but by that time Dean has come from one side and Cas from the other.
Jeremy half falls, half rolls out of his tube, and then gets hit with giggles. Kelly is upright and undoing their connectors before Jack is out. Jack attempts to step out, but sinks pretty far into the snow with a laugh. They manage to extricate themselves and drag their tubes behind them. Kelly looks over her shoulder at them with a big smile.
“So you survived making something vegan?” Sam asks Dean.
As they drive in, Dean can tell that the hotel Cas found is about as dog friendly as it gets. The hotel restaurant has a giant dog logo on it, and they’re across the street from a dog park; although, he’s not sure if they’ll have much time to use it. He watches Cas carefully pull Baby into a parking place without any cars around, just as Dean likes, and he thinks about how thoughtful Cas always is.
Gertie looks like she might be about to ask why, but she closes her mouth and motions to a storage bench and pillows. Instead of sitting on the bench, Jeremy sits on the floor with his back to the bench.
“Gabe is a bad influence on you Kelly,” says Sam.
Gertie reclaims her spot on the squashy couch next to her knitting bag.
Jack is pretty used to the door, so he has it unlocked with about the same speed as a key. “So what did you break this time?”
“Is he ok now? He’s not being a dick to you, is he?”
ENG 101 - English Composition I - C+
Claire jumps to attention and rushes to get the ingredients and put them on a paper plate. Jody and Donna pass out the easier to handle hot dog roasters to Claire, Patience, Alex, and Jack while everyone else makes do with skewers created from wire hangers that Donna took wire cutters to. Since Jeremy is trying to take pictures, Jack promises to make him a s’more. He and Claire give the greatest concentration to their tasks and try not to burn the marshmallows to Alex and Charlie’s amusement. Sam holds Eileen’s hand, and they sit next to Jody and Donna and catch up on conversation.
Dean looks up into the rearview mirror to see the back seat. “So how are we doin’? You know…emotionally and all that,” he says.
“This is quite a vehicle Kelly,” comments Dean.
“Jeremy, it was good to meet you. These guys are weirdos, but they’re Good People.”
Several very shocked people exclaim, “What?!”
Jack looks serious as he says, “Dean once told me that
Jeremy shrugs and says, “You and Jack should
“Ok,” says Jody. “You know we’re here for you always.”
“I think I figured that out already,” says Claire softly.
Here’s where I tell myself “Let’s not do THAT again.” THAT equals:
“I think you can go ahead and bring me a to go box. There’s no way I’ll be able to finish all this.”
“We’re making a kid’s table,” Claire says, indicating the group coming from the rec room. “Old people don’t interact!”
Dean picks up. “Jack’s in Lawerence for now, but who knows where he’ll wind up once he decides on a career. And we don’t want to get too far from Sioux Falls, or from Lebanon.”
Cas and Dean get a picture of Miracle in the pink room at the selfie museum, which makes Cas laugh, but they have another gift. They tear open the wrapping on a picture of Cas and Jack in front of the pink angel wings. It’s striking, the size of a small poster, and professional-looking. Kelly says that she wants one, as does Sam. Dean puffs up with pride, and can’t stop looking at it. Cas can tell he’s going to have a hard time getting it out of Dean’s hands, but manages by telling him it has to be carefully wrapped back up so it doesn’t get dented when they pack the car. Dean then immediately wants to find some bubble wrap, so Cas lets Dean do what he wants.
“Ow. My eyes. Let’s skip that one,” says Dean already turning around.
Rowena sighs and says that she needs to go off to do a little work that’s important, but she’ll be sure to be around to see Jeremy off Saturday morning, if not before. Gadreel insists that he should go along, so he’ll return when Rowena does.
Charlie and Gertie both give their congratulations. While Charlie starts a round of hugs, Miracle goes back to sit by Gertie on the couch, and Dean passes the leash to Cas who sits down next to them. Charlie glances down the couch, and seeing her mom looking comfortable petting Miracle, and with Cas admiring her knitting, she settles in for some animated brainstorming with Eileen, Sam, Dean and Kelly about a joint bride-groom shower, and possible stag parties.
“She’ll calm down now that Cas has her,” says Kaia with a fond smile.
“As long her younger brother learned with her,” picks up Jeremy.
Dean is about to say something else when this time Kelly gives him gentler warning press on his foot from the other side, and Kelly glances at Dean, then Jack. Dean wonders if she’s sending angel communication vibes or if he’s getting better reading her, because he understands it to mean that since Jeremy is Jack’s friend, he should let Jack take the lead in responding. Dean glances at Sam who has a hint of a smirk on his face, guessing at the communication going on.
“Since he has a car, it would make sense for us to come to you.”
Jack says, “They were never married.”
Saying goodbye and meeting Jeremy's parents
They do mange to get a few of Jeremy off guard. Cas yelled, “Say story problems,” instead of “say cheese” and Jack started laughing while Jeremy had a confused expression, on par with some Dean has seen from Cas. Dean let Miracle run up and jump on him, which resulted in a smile, and him dropping the crayon. Dean also employed the sneakier strategy of taking pictures with his phone after Cas said they were all done and he had a small relieved smile.
“Maybe
As the brothers hug, Cas turns to Jeremy with a smile and a nod, and they walk over to say hello, too.
Mel tells Nat, “He’s like you.” If Nat felt like responding, he’d ask her to clarify her sentence which is entirely lacking in clear antecedents. Instead he chooses a different response.
“Dean baked them and Cas decorated them.
Dean whispers back, “You heal me everyday, sweetheart.”
Dean laughs, and says, “That must be for you, Cas.”
“That’s what I was afraid of.”
Cas had a faint blush and then a smile. “Yes, Dean.”
“Unfortunately, the greater chaotic energy in the universe means witches may be more powerful. This will require more magic and protection spell training for hunters. There will be more and more civilians who have traces of psychic ability. More people will more likely be able to see auras, or sense feelings from close friends and family.
“Don’t get too excited. It’s a non-alcoholic berry cider, but it’s nice,” says Jeremy.
Kaia gets up and says, “Don’t be stranger,” and gives him a hug.
“About a decade later I realized that if you really had minded me being in your ‘personal space’ all those times, you would have moved backwards instead of making me do it,” says Cas raising an eyebrow.
“You sorted me into Hufflepuff?”
“Who’s coming?” ask both Dean and Cas.
“This is a lovely organizer,” says Cas.
Dean looks bit embarrassed but smiles, and says, “Yeah and I don’t regret it. That was one of the best times we’ve had, but I guess we’re trying to do things the right way now,” and then Dean gets in the driver’s seat with Cas at shotgun.
“Dean, people are allowed not to cook. It’s not a crime,” says Cas.
“Wow. Jack painted you two as the friends who had a child together, right? Just like Jeremy’s parents?”
Jack squeezes by to stand next to Jeremy. “Mom, this is my friend Jeremy.”
The Sunday after Jeremy leaves, Jack and the sisters take over the kitchen, create their own snack concoctions, and head down to the rec room to binge watch some shows. Jack sends Jeremy a supportive, emoji-laden text, but doesn’t try to start a conversation. He knows that Jeremy has a lot going on, and a lot of talking with his parents ahead of him. While the binge watch rolls on, Jack texts Canada, who insists they jump on FaceTime.
“We can draw names, except for the young people. They should still get gifts from all of us,” Rowena says. “They need a few more years of spoiling.”
Dean smiles. “I think he likes you all. Being at the other end of the table, we didn’t talk much.”
“Don’t go on. To be honest, it sounds like a pain in the ass. Better you than me, Executive Director.”
“They sound pretty well off. ”
“Guess,”says Dean with a look at Cas.
“I thought you two might have had a movie night,”says Cas.
Sam says, “With the girls coming today, I know tomorrow morning you’re going to make a heart attack on a plate. You, Eileen, Donna, and Claire could each eat a slab of bacon. Consider this a cleanser.”
“You have plans don’t you?”
“Yeah, that’s fine,” he says quickly looking at Cas for confirmation. Cas simply looks relived that he didn’t have to frantically signal Dean with his eyes to say yes.
“Cryptic. Ok, sure. Sometime.”
Jeremy’s dad is probably just under 6’ tall with a slim build. He’s a perfectly average looking forty-something guy with brown hair that’s like Jack and Kelly’s, but with some grey flecks. He’s wearing sunglasses on a sunny and cold day. When Jeremy goes up to his dad, his dad takes off his sunglasses and pockets them revealing expressive, true grey eyes. His dad doesn’t hug him, but puts his hands on Jeremy’s shoulders and looks him in the eye, letting J see the emotion there, and then touches his son’s face, saying, “I missed you.” Dean recognizes himself in that movement. J looks a bit overwhelmed. His mom gives him a big hug, and says, “Great sweater,” noticing Rowena’s gift, “tell me later.”
“Sam, you’re ruining the mood. Hmm. I might try BBQ over a burger for once.”
Mary sighs. “Forgiving isn’t just about fault. It wasn’t my fault that Jack killed me, but I took a chance that maybe I shouldn’t have.”
“I’m just a bit concerned…”
Everyone laughs and says, “To Sam and Eileen.”
“That make’s Dean’s nickname, squirrel,” says Sam.
“But..uhm, what?” asks Dean.
“I don’t have terms. I’m here to put you to sleep and to make it quiet again. That’s what you want.”
Claire shoves her hip against one of the loveseats to move it closer to a sofa first, then goes to give Jeremy a half hug, half back slap. Claire and Kaia take the loveseat and the rest fill in the sofa.
Cas and Jack come out in much less time than Dean and Jack. Dean helps Jeremy up and gives him a pat on the back. Jack comes over and gives Jeremy a hug, which Jeremy wills himself not to break before Jack does. Being in team competitions, Jeremy’s had half a dozen guys throw themselves at him and squeeze him, while lifting him off the ground and jumping up and down, so hugs aren’t foreign or anything to freak out about. He doesn’t usually hug friends with quiet hugs like this, but apparently, Jack and Cas are determined to make him a hugger, so he’s going to just go with it.
Jeremy just shrugs. “I’ve got aunts and uncles in St. Louis and Chicago.”
“Crazy as it seems, I trust this car with my life. My father had us living on the road. We moved around so much, Baby was the most stable home my brother and I had for years, so I’ve been slow to change her.” Dean looks up in the rear view mirror, and sees Jeremy’s wide eyes. “But I ’m gonna put in shoulder straps for me and Cas once we get back to Lebanon. Anyway, when we get to the cabins, we’ll do any driving around in Sammy’s Subaru, so I hope your parents will feel that you’re safe.” Cas briefly touches Dean’s arm.
“Shit,” says Jeremy again, feeling at a loss. “I shouldn’t have told you I was upset about my parents getting divorced. It’s stupid. They’re not arguing. They’re not mad at each other. They don’t treat me bad. Honestly, I know I’m spoiled. I probably got that car out of divorce guilt. Lots of people have it worse. I’m being an asshole.”
Mel says, “Don’t worry, I brought other things for the rest of us.” She has an enormous bag on her shoulder that she reaches into and pulls out a bottle.
Sam says, “I’m offended by the shade of orange these things are.” Miracle whines and begs for one.
“Come on buddy, you have to let me out of the booth.” Dean places a hand on Cas’ shoulder and gives it a pat. When no movement is immediately forthcoming, he slides it around toward Cas’ back and gives a bit of a push, leaving his hand there. Sam and Cas seem to share a look, and then Sam suddenly becomes very interested in his phone. Cas slides out with Dean right behind, hand still on Cas’ back. “Alright! I know this is gonna be good.” Dean steers Cas over to the case and they find apple, chocolate and pecan pies inside. Dean gives them careful consideration.
“Wow, you two are a tough crowd,” says Charlie shaking her head. “We’re
It’s not just about you — it’s about me, too. And now crazy as it seems, that sweet kid isn’t a kid anymore. He’s God.” The both look down for a minute. Dean finally says, “Have you talked to Jack about this?”
Dean looked down. “Cas of course.”
At the point where Kristin’s character gets framed for shoplifting, Jeremy becomes so agitated that Dean volunteers to teach him some pool shots to give him a break. Cas rolls his eyes at the pun as does Jody, but most of the room misses it. Dean and Jeremy go to the other side of the rec room. Kelly leaves her arm chair and joins Cas and Jack on the couch. Jack continues with the movie, but looks over to the pool table see how things are going from time to time. When it’s apparent that Kristen isn’t ditching her girlfriend for Aubry Plaza, despite great chemistry in a bar scene, Alex goes to join Jeremy and Dean for pool lessons.
Gadreel insists on taking Charlie and Gertie back, and lets everyone know that he’ll stay elsewhere overnight and be back early in the morning ready to drive people to wherever they want. There’s a round of byes, a passing of leftovers, and Cas and Dean walk out with Charlie and Gertie.
“Jody, you look glowing,” says Sam.
“I enjoy seeing a happy customer. Why don’t you boys take a look at the bakery case to pick one out?” She points to a case that had been hidden behind the two men at the table.
Jeremy noticed that Gertie slipped out, and follows to look for her. He goes to the alcove on the top floor and finds her on the first try. She’s in an armchair knitting with Miracle sleeping on her feet.
“Sammy, you’re embarrassing me again” groans Dean. “At least put forth some effort here.”
“What are these?” Jeremy asks holding up a cookie that’s a blob of white frosting with white wings covered in rainbow sprinkles. There’s another one just like it except that the rainbow sprinkles are on black icing, and it has a lot of blue icing dots, too.
Jack walks into the room with Miracle and just catches one of Jeremy’s dramatic annoyed groans, so he asks,“What’s wrong?”
“One last news item, given the change in energies, I will be transitioning into overseeing the chaos and magical energy balances. Next year I will lose my title as Queen of Hell.”
When the love confession happens and the girlfriend comes out as a lesbian to her conservative father, who is mainly concerned with reputation. Alex and Jeremy stand mollified at the pool table, but Charlie and Dean seem deeply affected, with glistening eyes. Dean has shifted over to sit on the arm of Charlie’s chair. Claire turns to Cas and asks, “Do you think my dad would have been like that movie dad?”
Rowen says, “Let’s move on. We anticipate there will be more ghost activity for hunters since we are low on Reapers to guide souls, in addition to the imprecise nature of probability. There should be fewer monsters that prey on humans due to the lack of demonic energy. That spell development I’m working on is to make a way for hunters to bypass the salt and burn and essentially throw a ghost to a reaper to get them on their way.”
“Uh, oh. I nearly forgot,” says Sam as he goes to pull Kelly aside from the group. He whispers a few words and the lights flicker. Dean looks over to see if Cas noticed, and he meets Dean’s eyes gives a slight nod to indicate he has. Dean raises an eyebrow and Cas gives the slightest of shrugs.
“You may not get bored anymore, but you still need some hobbies with human interaction,” says Cas. “Otherwise you’ll start to seem weird.”
“When I was going to separate from Amara, and everyone had to make their choices, she asked me if I wanted to come back as a baby.”
Dean grabs him. “Gotcha! So Jack, wanna help hold him, or want to hold the blow drier? That way your Dad can go change his shirt.”
Thirty minutes later everything translates to containers of Chinese take-out, wings, fries, and a cheese pizza on the coffee table. Another 30 minutes later and the fries are decimated, Jeremy’s finishing a plate of wings, Jack is eating out of Chinese take out cartons, and half the pizza has been declared breakfast food for tomorrow. Jeremy decides to ask a question.
“Maybe we can see that on the trip back to Lawrence,” suggests Jack.
She looks over and sees Dean and Cas still there and
They have a group hug and leave it at that. Patience will decide if she wants to bring up her father again.
“I think Canada might be a little psychic. Or maybe she just guessed you were wearing it because it’s your favorite sweater. I have a psychic cousin — you know, I’ve told you about Patience? — so it wouldn’t be a big deal if she was. You shouldn’t let it bother you that everyone calls it your groutfit. It looks comfortable, and
“That would be great. You’re already used to getting up early.”
Charlie asks, “Dudes, you think there’ll be people from…down there, or upstairs at Sam’s ceremony or even at the reception?”
Jeremy says, “Let’s try out each bedroom — the bunk beds first. We’ll see what you think.”
“Maybe we should start with a tubing hill? And I have no idea about whether skiing or snowboarding would be harder to learn.”
“It’s just from behind,” says Dean.
Sam brings out a little smart speaker for the kitchen, and the family divides between baking and poker. At first Dean rocks out, but he let’s the others send some playlists, too. Kaia and Claire rejoin, with a little teasing from Dean about having a rest, for which Jody gives an uncomfortable look. Then they join in and play a round of poker, too. Despite the scare some of them had, it’s a fun day.
They zip through the happy faces and donuts so other people can use them, but take a little longer at the wall of hearts because Dean and Cas decide to goof off. Dean makes exaggerated heart eyes at Cas who pretends to be annoyed, holding Dean at arms length. Then Cas relents and Dean pulls him as if to dance, and they dance a bit and do a spin. Jack applauds, as do a few spectators, but then Jack tells them to do a serious one. They both roll their eyes and then stand about a foot apart facing each other, and they just look at each other. Jeremy only takes a couple pictures and then says that they should call it a day. There are other people waiting, so they head back the way they came.
“I think living your life and being happy is the best reply to your dad. I haven’t figured out how to stop being angry all the time, but I know that I’m happier when I’m not.”
“Amara is with me. We’re balanced. Chuck hurt her, but with power of the Void of the Empty, she can speak for herself now.” Amara appears and she smiles at Castiel.
Ugh, retrieving phones is the worst, thinks Jeremy. He has to roll over and shove his arm into the space between the bed and the wall without being able to see what’s under there. He feels around hoping there’s nothing grosser than some lint.
Kelly moves over to sit next to Jeremy, since they’re the only ones left in the room. “Don’t worry about the peer pressure on changing,” says Kelly. “The KU royal blue is nice,” indicating Jeremy’s slightly baggy long-sleeved t-shirt, “be warned that once you meet Rowena, you’ll probably wind up getting a sweater or two for Christmas.”
Dean had to stop and laugh at a family of werewolves being the keepers for a Men of Letters bunker, but it seemed fitting somehow. There was more to tell but they had an eternity, and they pulled up to the roadhouse, to find the sun lowering in the sky.
“I had intended to wait until everyone got here, but then I decided that unless I wanted to ask him in front of everyone, I didn’t need to wait. We’ll just announce as folks come, and it’ll be less crazy.”
Jeremy wants to start several different lines of argument, including that safety aside, it’s just gross, but decides on a tactical retreat.
“Hey! J’s here!” yells Alex as they enter the rec room. She’s got two glasses in each hand. “Hug him quick and then grab a glass.”
“It’s going to be the best sweater I own for a while.”
When they finally get back in the car at the end of the day, all the phones ding. Kelly takes over driving, because Dean goes a bit crazy when Rowena sends him a picture of her and Miracle on a sophisticated-looking chaise lounge in front of a log fire surrounded by many good-looking people cooing over them. The text reads, “Took Miracle to see friends in Vail.” Miracle looks suspiciously shiny, and has been styled with bows. Dean suspects the thumb on one side of the image is Gadreel’s. Jack forwards the picture to Jeremy, who replies with a thumbs up emoji. He then sends back a picture of the Flatirons and a text letting Jack know that they didn’t go home and have been tourists in Boulder. Then Alex and Patience’s group chat gets the picture, too.
Sam puts a hand to his head, massaging a sudden headache. ”This is beyond my pay grade, Rowena,” he says a little louder.
“It’s always a bit of of struggle deciding how much it’s safe to interact with strangers, but I knew she’d be sad if I didn’t let her meet you.”
“Really well?”
Cas hears part of the conversation and tells Dean,“I was interested in different things as an angel.”
“Jeremy, will you stop and let me in?” There’s one last louder thud, and then a crash, and a loud, “Shit!”
Since becoming human, Cas is a lot more touchy, so he just says, “Hello Jeremy” and immediately moves in for quick hug. Fortunately Jeremy goes with it, and in fact seems more comfortable with the hug than the handshake. Or maybe it’s being more comfortable with Cas, considers Dean.
“Now that it’s decided, I’m leaving it to him to plan,” says Eileen with a smile.
Cas huffs and gives him a glare. “Maybe.”
“There are more items in the trunk so there will be less sliding than on the backseat.”
Rowena is sitting next to Charlie sharing a drink of something stronger than hot chocolate in their mugs. Making sure they’re not overheard, Rowena tells Charlie a campfire story from her road trip with Charlie’s apocalypse world doppelgänger, and Charlie blushes a little.
“You’re lookin’ good kid,” says Dean indicating Jack’s sweater. It’s a simple, light blue sweater with a dark blue collar and cuffs, but the color matches his eyes and somehow looks classy. “Early Christmas present?”
should be treated, and being brave enough to risk getting hurt and give someone a second chance.”
“Mom…are you ok?”
Everyone breathes a sigh of relief, and Dean breaks out an enormous container of puffed cheese balls as a treat, and hands them to Sam to pass around. Eileen gets a few more sodas to set on the table.
Dean rolls his eyes, “Ok, I’m heading up, too.”
“I was thinking I would get a little house or apartment there as a base. You could drop in whenever you want to get off campus. I expect to pop up to heaven for news and messages, but you wouldn’t even notice I’d gone.”
“Cas and I are old married guys. Sam and Eileen are changing the family business to something positive. Jack gets to be a kid — ok a college kid — but a kid with friends. You’re here. Jody and Donna and the girls are happy. Somehow Rowena manages to be Queen of Hell and still spoil Jack every time we turn our backs. I know Kevin and his mom are out there living their lives, even if they don’t check in that often. And everyone else I care about who isn’t here is in heaven or wherever of their own free will. It don’t get better than that.”
Kelly looks across the table at Gadreel with a hint of suspicion as she pushes a piece of spicy tuna roll onto some wasabi; however, he’s polite and apologetic at every turn. He has to speak at an angle, but Gadreel manages tells Jeremy about himself.
He looks across to Jack who says, “So are you living in an apartment to avoid bunk beds?”
“Sorry, Mel,” says Sam.
Although Cas and Dean suspect Rowena just wants to buy Jack all his clothes through his college career, everyone is willing to go with that plan.
“Thank you for telling me,” says Jeremy.
“Hmm, timing may be a bit tricky, but I’d love to help.”
Bobby gave him a hard eye roll and put his hand to his heart. “Figure it out.” He turned back to Sam. “Eileen is back. She spent a long time with her parents, getting to know them. They’re here, too.” Tears started rolling down Sam’s face, but he had a big smile. He ran in.
“Well, if you’re into that sort of thing it does look pretty badass,” she says.
Alex smiles, “That’s for you to hang on to for next year, in case you get invited to an ugly sweater party.”
Dean shrugs and says, “Who knows?”
“He couldn’t have faith, because he was afraid,” says Donna. Patience gives Donna the darkest look any of the sisters have ever given Donna, but she holds up to it. “I’m not trying to defend him, Patience.”
Mel smiles, but Nat looks a bit unsettled. Neither have anything to ask or say.
“Uh, no. But there is  something last minute. Uhm…”
“Good to know,” Jeremy says. “I’ll miss you, too.”
They go to the other side of the foyer which has a hallway next to stairs. “Let’s go to the basement first — thankfully,
, and we’re asking if you’d be willing to perform the ceremony.”
“You know I wouldn’t have minded,” says Rowena with a wink, “but you wouldn’t want to embarrass the boys.”
“Dean..,”warns Cas looking at him sternly.
Cas holds out his hand and motions Jeremy out of the room with him. They close the door behind them.
Sam watches them leave and head to the stairs. He looks filled with guilt and turns to Eileen once they are out of sight. “Don’t say it.”
“I know that looks rough, but with our adopted moms being sheriffs, we’ve learned a lot of self-defense and martial arts. Jack is the family’s special boy, and he gets protected and spoiled. He likes being able to take care of himself and
Now a guitar starts playing. Why does the music seems so loud all of a sudden, wonders Dean.
“I hadn’t thought about it as being part of a Game Night.”
“Have you not watched the Hallmark Channel lately? For most Christmas movies, there’s always at least one mysterious character who’s really Santa, or an angel, or an elf. You guys are just a little ahead of the curve.”
“Kelly, do you want to shoot some pool with us,” offers Eileen.
“So what did you think, Cas?”
“If you want to crash here, you can take Ajay’s bed. I know he won’t mind. He wants me try to get you to move in with us sophomore year anyway — that way we can ditch Kyle.”
“You know, I just needed a clean drive. I can put files on by myself.”
“Gotcha loud and clear,” Dean says to both Jeremy and Cas.
Gadreel nods. “Maybe not as soon as your uncles, but I hope she’ll be able to travel.”
“What are you laughing at Dean?” Asks Cas.
Heads up: while this is going to be very tame fic, I realize that I can't imagine Dean not swearing some more, and not have some joking about middle-aged sex. So I will bump the rating up to teen when we get there.
“Well, sounds like that’s over,” says Charlie.
They find the bunk bed room, and Jeremy goes to sit on the bottom bunk. “First thing, I’m really going want you to take your shoes off if you’re going to be stepping above me.” At Jack’s slight pout, Jeremy adds, “Please.”
“I may not have had brothers or sisters, but I’ve had people around. Three dads, friends of the dads, my aunt Rowena, my grandmother, Mary, my honorary grandfather, Bobby. They all came and went through our home. And you may not believe it, but I have roughed it — like sleeping on the ground.”
“Alas, Ellen can’t own every restaurant in the United States,” says Cas wryly.
Dean says, “That so? Is it good?”
“I liked the idea of a top bunk.”
“Hey, looks like you’ve all done some damage here,” says Dean walking in with Miracle on a leash for once.
“Jack, aren’t you going to answer the question?” It looks like Castiel and it tilts his head at him.
“Shush,” whispers Cas as he looks over the many packages mentally checking off lists. Dean does his own inventory of the snacks already in the back seat.
“That was my first thought, too. Especially since he’s specifically interested about the non-profit. He is a financial analyst, and from Charlie’s checking, a damn good one. He’s probably consults all around the Midwest.”
“No, I had a flashback about his” — Cas pauses to make quotation marks — “wife. When we first met her she had a special cupcake carrier.”
“This shot is perfect for a Dean approach,” says Jack.
“Cas doesn’t like the angel cookie cutters. He chops off the body and smushes the head down. I think he needs better cookie cutter shapes. Hey, I should have thought of that for Christmas.”
“Handled the past year earthside like a champ. Lots of Netflix binging.” Dean nods looking sad. “Hey Dean, we both know your mom’s situation was different.”
“How does she do that?”
of the time you’re more relaxed when you wear it.”
“That’s ok. There’s always a little chaos when we visit,” says Jody.
“Speaking of our dog,” Dean says as he looks at Miracle lying on his back on the bath mat, “I thought that after dinner, we’d have the boys keep him in their room overnight.”
“Dean…”
“No, just what we’ve already talked about — normal life stuff. They’re actually more disorienting, but definitely less scary.”
“You’re Jeremy, right?” At his nod, she adds, “I’m Charlie Bradbury. Brave of you hanging out with these guys,” she says giving him a light side hug. Jeremy breathes a sigh of relief at not being squeezed too hard or kissed.
Dean smiles back and is about to pull Cas in for a kiss when Miracle starts barking. They both sit up. Then there’s a knock at the door.
“Trust me, it’s not. If you want to talk to people when they aren’t working their current job, or if you want to fly under the radar with their employer, the weekend is a good idea. I goof off plenty on Sam’s time,” she says with a laugh. “After that one meeting, I’m going to spend some time with my mom in town, and then I’ll join you guys in a few days like we planned.”
Kelly speaks. “Lots of angels just want to follow orders, but they do want the orders to make sense and be moral. Hell is the best place for that now. It’s almost all monitoring and reporting.”
“They’re for him to have when we get to Denver. We have candy with nougat in the snacks.”
“Jeremy King, it’s very good to meet you,” Rowena puts a hand out for a handshake and Jeremy suddenly feels like he’s been given a pop quiz. Even as part of him thinks he’s supposed to shake with a firm hand, he takes Rowena’s hand gently, and just holds it more than shakes it. He feels like he’s possibly failed for not bowing and kissing her hand, but he manages to say something.
“What the hell is going on?” he hisses to Cas, who is looking on in shock. Sam looks crushed, expecting the worst. Eileen and Charlie lock eyes looking steely and ready to go get weapons.
“Don’t bother. Besides, he can show off how strong he is,” Dean says, earning a raised eyebrow from Cas — which Dean doesn’t seem to mind in the slightest.
“I’m still on the dreamy guys!” yells Charlie as she goes to give Cas a big hug. “I know better than to kiss you. I might have a revolt of my subject over there,” Charlie jokes as Cas returns her big affectionate squeeze.
“Did you go back to sleep any, Cas?”
“You know, I don’t think we need a video to figure out how cut open pool noodles and tape them to the rungs,” says Jeremy.
“But you didn’t ask me to wipe his feet off when he came in the room. After all, Miracle doesn’t have shoes.”
” and then hits video. Jeremy is used to Jack’s strange emoji and symbol messages, and so he obeys. He might be a little annoyed though. “Brah, you know I hate FaceTime. Why are you torturing me?”
“Are we assholes?” asks Jeremy.
Patience walks up and says, “Donna’s super-cheerful, but don’t feel like you have match her.”
Jack smiles, exceptionally pleased with himself, and runs through his group chats. Carmen says she won’t forgive him if he doesn’t send her pics of his Dads and the gifts she helped him to pick out. He shakes his head. He should also send Canada pics wearing his new sweaters. She says that she’s become invested in his Look and is determined to glow him up. She’s threatening to call his Aunt Rowena, which the Dads would definitely not like. He’s starting to get hungry and pulls a nougat bar out of his backpack. The rustle catches Jeremy’s attention and he surfaces from under the throw. “My aunt sent me a finals present. I’ve got paper in my wallet. Want to order food? It’ll be on me.”
“I confess that I didn’t knit this especially for you. I make things I like when I like and save them to become gifts or donations later. I decided that this scarf suits you. Detailed washing instructions included on the other side. Just realizing that something requiring hand washing isn’t the best gift for a college student, but giving this to you anyway. — Gertie”
Somewhere there’s a smell that’s telling Dean’s brain that he should wake up. Dean opens his eyes and sees a hand with take out coffee in front of him. He inhales what smells like a wonderful dark roast. He blinks a few times and sees Cas already dressed in a grey-blue sweater and jeans, and holding a take out coffee at arms length near his face.
“Oh no, you’re going to become a triathlete, aren’t you?” asks Dean.
“Heaven has new priorities for the angels.”
“Dean, you haven’t even had your dinner yet.”
“Excuse me, club?” Dean asks tensing. Cas pats his knee, but doesn’t look completely easy either. Kelly says, “It will be fine. His friend Canada wants to start taking Jack out dancing with their other friends in the spring. I don’t know how it happened, but Rowena talks to her sometimes. Anyway, I helped on choosing this box, but the next things are pure Rowena.”
A throne appears and the Empty is still in Meg’s form. “Why are you back! Listen to all that noise!” The Empty hisses. Blackness runs out from the Entity and towards Jack. It reaches like a hundred tendrils seeking to move around him. They engulf Jack until they cover him completely, but as soon as that is accomplished, there’s a glow from within and the tendrils snap back. The Empty chooses a new form and sits down.
“What if he wants to eat them on the ride?”
“Sweetheart, if you’re happy, then everything’s good. C’mere.” Dean opens his arms. Cas goes to him, and somehow Dean manages to pull them into one of the bunker’s club chairs with Cas on his lap.
“Carrot and stick. The carrot is that we know what’s going on and they don’t. There are artifacts and spells based on aspects of Chuck’s power that don’t work now, and their monitoring of the demonic shows zilch. They don’t understand and it’s driving them insane. Plus, there’s finding accounts, and then there’s finding out what they did with the money. That last part is the stick. Let’s just say that they don’t need any attention. That’s not how I wanted to handle it, but there’s no court system for suing amoral secret societies.”
“What?!” ask half a dozen concerned voices.
Jeremy hands Jack a wrapped box. “I guess this is from me and your mom, since she bought this when I asked her to. I didn’t have the time to get it.”
“So you can do without pool noodles,”
Jeremy looks at the cookie closely and sees that Cas drew in feathers with thin gold frosting lines over the white wings, so he spent a lot of time on it. If he thinks it’s another weird thing to do if you believe in angels, he keeps it to himself. “For some reason I like these better than typical angel cookies, too.” Jack looks up from giving Miracle a rawhide chew with a big smile.
“What?”
“Pool noodles?” asks everyone, except Eileen who’s already seen them and Jack who asks, “You and Rowena got gifts together?”
“Yeah, that’s about right,” says Jody.
“Sam’s sort of my online running coach. I guess he didn’t mention it to you,” Jack shrugs.
For the coloring book room, Jeremy quickly sets up the camera, adjusts the ring light, and tells Cas what to push on the DSLR. Dean hands them a couple oversized crayons for props, laughs at them, and takes some pics on Jack’s camera, too. He wisely doesn’t say that he’s laughing because Jeremy looks like a storm cloud and Jack looks like a beaming sun.
FIN 101 - Personal Finance - A
“Hmm…I think so, but it’s also about acknowledging what’s there.”
“THE BLUE BEAR!” exclaims Jack.
“I like to remind people of that occasionally. The coyote one is mine.”
“Nope. I’m as good as you deserve.”
“Damn right. Somebody hand me plates,” says Dean.
That makes Jack frown with confusion.
Jeremy exhales, and thinks about it. “I like what I know of them, but they don’t share everything about themselves, and I don’t like
Canada says, “You should make King come to our weekly dinner out,” she pauses and then in her more demanding persona says, “Otherwise he’ll commit you to a study group that messes up our schedule, and have you eating out of a library vending machine. I cannot have that.”
“I hope so. Well, if I get invited sometime.”
Both Jack and Jeremy look a little sad, but then Jack breaks into a soft smile. “Besides, I know we have an angel watching over us.” Jeremy looks surprised at that since Jack has never seemed religious, and even more surprised when Cas turns around and says seriously, “It’s true, but we should take precautions anyway.” Dean just chuckles and says, “Yeah, I wouldn’t want to live down having an accident on… anyone’s watch.”
The waitress comes by, quickly dropping off items, and retreating out of the way, as Charlie comes around to find Dean.
“What are Queen Aunts for?” she says with a smile at Eileen and Rowena. “You’re pretty much adopted, so you have to deal with it.”
“Hey, don’t finish that sentence there are kids in the back!” interrupts Dean with real concern.
“Don’t eyebrow me if you want me to make polite conversation with the kids,” returns Dean with a flirty smile. Cas leans in and they share a kiss, and then they both back up, Cas turning to wave at Jack. Dean looks down at Miracle inside the fence, “Ya ready?” As if in answer Miracle turns around in a circle. Dean opens the fence again and he jumps into Dean’s arms, with Dean having to wiggle a bit to hold him. “You’re gonna need a longer work out. You’re getting too used to getting carried,” Dean says to Miracle who just squirms around and licks his face. Being the best husband in the universe, Cas doesn’t point out that Dean could just stop holding him. Miracle is an average-sized dog, but Dean often carries him around as if he were a teacup poodle.
“Of course it is,” teases Dean. “I mean it looks like a Borg cube, man. Hey, look, a built-in grill on the cooktop.”
Cas and Dean make lightning fast eye contact and it’s decided.
“Ok, I found the switch to shut off the vents. Thanks!” yells Kelly, turning off the hot air to the back row, and maybe making it a little cooler with her own methods.
“You’ve turned Jack into a runner,”accuses Dean.
“At first, but now that I understand it, no.”
as Cas walks in. Dean feels a chill.
“Cookie crumbs are
“I can’t tell you everything anyway, but I know they do love each other. They just aren’t in love romantically. They were never in love that way. There was this time when…I was… I was just with my mom, and we were away from Cas, and we weren’t expecting him. And he came in the house, and he was just so happy to see me that he laughed. And then he saw my mom, and I could see how much he cared about her. He thought he’d let her down but she said I was wonderful, so that meant Cas hadn’t let us down. Then she just hugged him. It meant a lot for me to see them together, but it’s not like him and Dean. It’s ok that my Mom lives far away, because through Cas and Dean and Sam, I have a really big family of amazing people. Most of my aunts and uncles aren’t really related to me. We have a saying that ‘Family don’t end in blood.’” Jack shrugs and smiles.
“Isn’t yours about the same?” asks Jack.
Dean looks to the sidewalk in front of the restaurant building with his heart beating fast. Cas reaches over, and places a hand on Dean’s thigh. From behind, she looks like Mary Winchester. She’s about 5’8” with short, blonde, wavy hair set atop strong, broad shoulders wearing an olive green barn jacket. She turns around, and the illusion shatters. Instead of flannel, Mel is wearing a green t-shirt that reads “
“You taught Sam well, and he probably didn’t see any red flags. Guess we need to start nudging him home.”
“That’s it,” Kelly says moving to a guest chair. “I just topped off your fluids.” At a raise of Gertie’s eyebrows, she says, “Sorry, between Gabe and Dean I’m picking up strange humor. You had a little tear in there and were leaking cerebrospinal fluid. You probably got your headaches when you stood up?”
“Indeed,” says Rowena. “Hell will be renamed soon.”
Stuff to Google if you're curious:
This fic has been an enormous learning experience for me.
“We can help,”pipes up Jack, as Jeremy nods.
He shrugs, but with a rare smile says, “I’ll go watch people.”
“Sam, I had no idea how much you’d come to mean to me, and how much I’d respect you. And now you found someone to share your life and I’m proud and happy. Eileen, you’re amazing. I know you have Sam’s back and he has yours. I love you both. You’re family. And now I’m going to have to think of something better to say at your wedding. To Sam and Eileen.”
“Dude, if you and Cas weren’t already together, it could be a Hallmark movie about love, forgiveness, and helping a kid discover the true meaning of Christmas.”
“It can wait. Once Sam gets his stuff sorted out, we can start working on getting a house to fix up and move out of the bunker. Sam will probably need us to do some work for his organization, so we’ll be busy this time next year. I’m enjoying having time with my husband and my kid.” Cas scoots closer and puts a hand on Dean’s thigh.
Sam calls for everyone to have a break, and most people scoot for the kitchen. Jack and Claire decide it’s time to move on to the cheese balls.
“Shit, I didn’t mean to bring up anything bad. I didn’t think you’d ever had problems with Dean. You’re always so happy when you talk about him.”
“But it sounded like Donna is getting out of policing, and Jody is applying for something more administrative? And I don’t know what sketch things your mom and dads used to do,”at Jack’s shocked look Jeremy rolls his eyes, “but they all seem to be past it now, or about to be, so…”
Mary relocates to the barstools, with Miracle getting underfoot in the kitchen while Cas grates cheese and potatoes, and Dean gets the griddle ready. Zeppelin plays softly, and Mary pours out coffee. Once Dean has the hash browns about to come off, and the eggs on, he asks, “So how’s Dad?”Cas tenses slightly, but doesn’t say anything.
Sam says, “use the side door by the garage, just in case,” since he knows that will be out of view of any windows.
Nat manages a small smile. He says, “I brought Kelly a bottle of akvavit, because she may be the only person I know besides my sister who likes it.” He reaches into a canvas shopping bag and pulls it out.
“Bless you dearie. Speaking of blessings, I am pleased to report that the Balance is achieving what we hoped. Jack can have his own life and not be God. Amara was significantly injured by Chuck, but she should eventually regain her full strength. However, by choice, Michael and Adam will continue to assist her. They should be able to visit earth in a few years. Gabriel is looking forward to being earthside in a couple of months, and he will still be the family’s guardian.
“Yoo hoo! We’re back!” yells Donna as Jody follows behind.
Alex turns back to Claire. “Well, if you wanted to trade…”
“Hey Donna, where are we going?”
After the group of four gets back down to the main level, Dean says, “Screw the luggage for now. I need a beer, or at least a Diet Coke.”
Sam looks at Dean wondering if he’ll have a comment about kilts being too much like skirts.
Kaia goes first, and says, “Glad to see you so soon.”
“Yeah. It’s a definite downside to captain’s seats up front, and spacing like this,” affirms Dean.
“Dean put in seatbelts,” says Jeremy finally.
Jeremy is told that the plan for today is a family dinner, and a slumber party. The party consists of a lesbian holiday rom-com, maybe some holiday specials, s’mores around the fire, and back inside for what Dean called ‘girly stuff’ — which seems to be misnamed, since everyone, including Dean, seems to be taking part — and then the Mandalorian finale. Sam and Eileen have a date night, but they’ll be back in time for s’mores. Tomorrow he gets to sleep in and then meet his parents for late lunch. He’s feeling ok with it, but he’s thinks going to miss Jack’s family more than makes sense.
Cas whispers to Dean, “It’s hard knowing I can’t heal anyone I love.”
“Hey, give me some credit. It’s imitation, not theft. Cas likes your fancy shampoo, too.”
Jeremy looks down. “So what was it like when they got divorced?”
“The best.”
Claire perks up. “For what?”
“Ok, just gotta get Miracle set up then we can head in and get lunch.”
“Don’t worry Jack, I guessed that much. We’ll still like your friend when he’s comfortable enough with us to be annoying. Anyway, it’s so weird having people think they need to be polite around us. We’re that old.”
“Many times,” Sam says.
Sam takes a look at his watch. “Ok, now that you’ve got the gist of how it’s going to work, I’ve got a bombshell for you all.”
When Charlie and Gertie arrive, they bring presents, and everyone realizes that not having a tree may be awkward. They make a pile in the living room and Charlie introduces Gertie. Jeremy finds himself doing a Jack-like wave and blushes slightly at the imitation.The group goes to sit, and Gertie takes out some knitting needles and a project, which keeps her hands occupied and lets her eyes flit back and forth. Dean and
“Really?”
Bunk bed assessment, unexpected problems
“No, it’s fine. I did say something about being flexible and not a control freak.”
“Well, I’ll take getting old over the alternative any day. Get over here Charles!” says Dean with a big smile.
Dean pointed and said, “Thataway!”
“Wait a minute, is this Baby?” Dean holds up one of the larger cookie cutters shaped like a car.
“Cas, I’m not going to run the heater that high, and they’ll slide around.”
Everyone laughs, including Kelly, but then Kelly suddenly stops, goes still and is gone with a whoosh, her mug suspended in air. Dean gingerly grabs it and puts it on the table remembering that case when cartoon rules were in effect. Outside they can hear Miracle barking up a storm, and then the sound stops.
Miracle puts his ears up and makes a questioning whine. Dean just laughs, and takes a minute to put some water in his travel bowl and leaves it on the floor, since it seems as good a place as any.
“I’ve got passes for Copper Mountain, and some other options, so think we’ll have some fun.”
I've decided that I'm going to stick with these guys to narrative Christmas. We're roughly 2 weeks away in the story, and so at this rate, I'm thinking I might finish with Christmas in May. It may have 5-6 more chapters, but I'm leaving it a question mark so far.
Cas gives him a smile and raises an eyebrow. “When you do something other than talk first.”
The Empty throws the globe to the ground and instead of light what looks like Castiel’s physical form is tossed onto what serves as the ground. Castiel grunts and sits up. He’s confused and shocked. “I’m awake.”
“What the hell?”
“Yes, I’ve already moved it there,” adds Gadreel from the other room.
“Personal space is definitely overrated,” says Dean.
“She gave me the choice of tattoos or having this made. I decided to go with tattoos.”
As if perfectly planned, Cas walks in with the boys in tow. He hands Jack Miracle’s leash as he shifts to pull off his coat. Thanking a perfect alignment of the planets, Dean says, “There are the boys, and that man taking off his coat is my husband.” He now has the woman’s attention, as Cas shrugs out of his coat with a stretch, displaying a broad back and firm biceps under a snug long sleeved T-shirt. She takes a look at Dean, and says, “I get you.”
Sam cuts Cas off before he’s gotten his name out, with an enthusiastic “Hey Jeremy, we’re heard so much about you and we’re really glad you came.” He’s clasped Jeremy’s hand for a hearty shake.
“And impressed with you and the foundation,” Kelly counters.
“Not from around here” chortles his friend, pleased at having the proper set up to finish what sounds like an old familiar line. They both have a laugh and share a look as their hands slide together. The movement is just registering in Dean’s brain, when Arlette comes out of the kitchen with an enormous tray.
Charlie says, “Ok, whoever wants to wait can wait, but I think at least these should be opened.” Charlie points to the pile of gifts that are flat and obviously go an a wall. Those are for Kelly and the dads, and get passed out as well as the aunt and uncle gifts. Everyone gets a printed photobook with pictures from the holidays and selfie museum. They all have a different set of pictures, and once everyone realizes that, there’s a lot of passing around. Fortunately the books have names, so they don’t get mixed up. Gertie is surprised that she gets a thumb drive to use to transfer pictures of Charlie taken at the selfie museum to her tablet. There’s even a picture of Jeremy in the scarf that she gave him — heavy on the scarf since Jeremy has it covering most of his face. Gertie laughs.
Patience says sternly, “I’m not interpreting the family. You’ll have to go with your own impressions of people.”
“He’s right behind me.”
“No, don’t say it!” protests Jeremy holding up his hands as a barrier and trying to twist away.
“Oooh, I didn’t know there were still cheese balls. That would be excellent,” says Claire with a bigger smile.
Charlies squeals a long, loud squeal that has Miracle barking in response.
“Text or whatever for a while, and then lay down like you’re going to bed. I’ll lie down here and we’ll see how it goes.” He takes his shoes off and lies down and listens to Jack text for a bit. He considers that the effort to point out the downside of bunk beds may backfire, and he may wind up having to sleep here. It doesn’t sound like Jack is bumping his elbows on the rails, or twisting around to get comfortable, which is what would have happened if he were up there trying to text. These beds seem wider and longer than usual. Maybe he shouldn’t have made a fuss. There’s the typical creaking from the person on top shifting positions, but it’s not that bad.
They do all the corny poses they can think of, including a dumb perspective pic with Jack holding Miracle, and Dean somehow getting the dog to lick so it looks like he’s licking wheat Jesus’ face — or maybe eating it. Given that Jeremy’s found out they all believe in angels, it seems odd to him that they don’t find this sacrilegious. Also, they’re not really at the best angle for any of this, but hopefully they’ll like the results. A few more family shots and finally they’re done. He packs up and sees Dean walking over. “Ok, your turn, kid.”
“The supercharger station there?” At this point, Jeremy and Dean have a map of all the charging stations on I-70 in their heads.
“But you thought they’d be together. You have a right to be upset.”
Jack gives a crooked smile and says, “See, I was right. I said it would be nice.”
I head canon that like Cas, having been an angel/nephilim Jack doesn't really think about gender, so he'd see himself as NB, regardless of how others see him.
“3D printing,” answers Charlie.
“Hey, they got it right in the middle of spring break. You won’t even have to skip anything,” says Jeremy to Jack, who resumes beaming, and goes for a second round of hugs with Eileen and Sam. He steps back clasps his hands together and moves them back and forth. “Awww,”says Eileen. “You did congratulations just right.“
Dean says, “I notice in all this greenery no one thought to bring mistletoe.”
Jack looks a bit sheepish and wiggles his feet to show off his new slippers.
Jack is still smiling and walks over to the foot of the bed to face Jeremy. “I think you have some crumbs.” Jeremy looks down to see crumbs on the top of the bedspread. “You know, some people don’t eat in bed because of crumbs, but you can just brush those off,” Jack says in a knowing tone. Jeremy sees where this is going and responds accordingly.
“Uh, huh,”says Dean as he sits down next to Cas and snitches some hash brown with his fingers.
The Empty rises from the throne. “They deserve to sleep with their regrets for eternity.”
Alex says, “You’re going to medical school.”
Cas hums at that as if considering contradicting Dean, but then asks, “Are you bored?”
“Dean, you should carry Miracle. The website says small dogs are allowed in, so if you carry him in, they’ll think he’s small,” says Jack
Jack still manages to put his hand on Jeremy’s shoulder, turn him around, and look into his eyes and earnestly say, “Let me help.”
“Hi Gertie, I thought I’d see if you needed to be completely alone, or if maybe you wanted company, but less of it.”
“Hi, I’m Donna. I’m so glad we have a few days with you before you head home.”
So I learned a great deal, and I’m hoping the next thing I write will go smoother. I’m working on a season 13 fix-it fic. I won’t start posting until I’ve finished writing, because I hate not knowing how long something will take as much as a reader does. It will be more destiel-focused with a heavy load of Cas’ parental feelings. It will have a different Jack — not college-ready Jack, but just-born, kid-like Jack per 13.01.
“I’m glad I wasn’t looking at the right time to notice that,”says Jack.
Jeremy relents a bit. “Knowing what a pool shark you are, and that your Dads taught you, I
“And having a break from work, huh Donna?” asks Dean.
Jeremy nods to Dean, and then offers Alex the break.
“I think it’s going to be ok, I mean for Jeremy,” says Jack, as if just coming to the realization. He smiles and seems content.
Kelly goes to reclaim and refreshen her mug of hot chocolate, and Cas gets two beers out of the fridge, looking atypically shaky and on the verge of tears.
“Actually yes.”
“I appreciate your remembering that’s plural Jack,”comes from the recliner.
Although they linger, it comes time to go and they form a crowd back outside the building. Nat and Mel keep a bit of distance to give Jeremy some privacy with all the good byes. Sam and Kelly give heartfelt, intense, but quick hugs. Cas gives Jeremy a hug like he was one of his kids with a forehead kiss. Dean comes up and Jeremy asks, “Aren’t you going ask me to watch out for Jack at KU.”
The girl smiles and says hello, then gets shy and buries her face behind her mom’s neck.
Cas leans across and pats Jacks hand sympathetically as the waitress arrives with lunch.
They all shift to the kitchen table. During breakfast they chit chat over what gets called Heaven Gossip, but is really just gossip. Dean smiles over what Cas omits as much as what he shares. It takes away a bit more of his uneasiness. Cas and Mary can really go to town on gossip, and it’s hilarious.
“Yay!” Yells Claire beating out Alex, Kaia, and Patience.
“Whether or not they let you switch, would you want try to take something from Classics for fun? Like take a mythology class together?”
“It was hard, but being a pie, I was able to wrap my head around it. I’d normally hard pass on store-bought crusts, but Kelly went and got them for me, and I didn’t want to make a mistake with vegan ingredients.” Dean sets down a lovely looking pot pie in front of Sam, then heads back to the kitchen.
“That’s right. So again?”
“What?”
Thank you for giving this a read.
“I’m Kaia Nieves. That’s my girlfriend Claire Novak.” They look over and Claire has moved on to jump Dean. Jeremy realizes that Claire was being relatively gentle with Jack, because she smacks her side into Dean with enough velocity for Jeremy to hear the collision and for it to pull a grunt out of Dean. He also manages to twist out of her hold, and he turns her upside down, causing the short-haired woman to yell again.
“Yes! Swirl! A sun color,” she says.
napkin dipped in ice water, as Jack squirms a bit. He can’t help breaking into a smile and a laugh as he motions toward them and looks Charlie with a nod of his head. Charlie glances over and laughs, too.
“Wait a minute, says Dean. “How far is it? Do we have to go into the lodge to get keys, or do you have them?”
Claire gives him something halfway between a side hug and a slap on the back, and says to Jack, “You might need to keep J out of trouble, so keep an eye out for him when you both get back to KU.”
“Jack said something about that before we got here. I guess you know I’m Jeremy.”
“Wow,” Kelly says. “It’s like they can tune everyone out. Oh, is it ok if I finish off this whipped cream? I promise to get you some more tomorrow.”
She gets up and they hold each other for a while.
Amara rolls her eyes, then Jack stands in front of Castiel again. “Would you like to help get Heaven ready for him? For all humans? It needs fixing, and there’s the angels and demons from the Empty we must help. And we can visit my mom.”
“But most of the day I’d be prepared. I’ve lowered the odds that I’ll need to do that,” says Jack, as if it’s a simple fact.
“Ugh, now I’m going to be embarrassed. I thought you’d all open them last night or this morning.”
Jack doesn’t feel he should say much about Jeremy’s family, so he limits it to, “Mom and the Dads went with me to meet Jeremy’s parents for lunch before they left.”
Castiel gives an exasperated huff. “You are the only person in the universe who can look so beautiful pouting and smelling like bacon with a mouth full of food.”
“You’re right. It’s happening.”
Everyone in the car sighs, except Kelly who raises a perfectly arched eyebrow at him. Cas pats Dean on the thigh and says, “Thank you for asking, Dean.”
“Yeah, that was really something,” Dean says and nudges Cas’ ankle with his foot. Cas gives him an enormous smile back.
“Nah, this is Jack-centric,” says Dean.
Cas shakes his head and simply says, “Get down, boy,” and Miracle jumps back to the floor.
Sure enough, Miracle’s light fur makes a good contrast and gives the eye something to rest on. He seems quite happy to pose. Dean is won over, cooing at Miracle to get him to turn his head one way or another at Jeremy’s direction. Jack stands next to Jeremy duplicating some of the shots on Dean’s phone.
Sam pulls the phone away from his chest. “Ok, Rowena we’ll be ready.”
“We just have to pick a state and look for something,” sighs Cas.
Nat gets into the back seat with Jeremy. He says, “I’m sorry I disappointed you.”
They’re about 10 minutes to the restaurant when Dean looks to the backseat. “Sorry, tell me your dad’s name again?”
