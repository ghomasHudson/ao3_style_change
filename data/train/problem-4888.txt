And in that moment, waiting in hard plastic chair next to Tony's fading embers and praying to Mary Magdalene for her watchful eye, that is all he needs.
(Maybe it's the subconscious blind hope that he'll find his soulmate or just the superego that justifies manufacturing and capitalizing weapons of death.)
Heavy drugs, Tony figures, and the good ones, too. There's a disconnect and fading confusion where concern and anxiety should be. He can feel air going through his nose as his takes what he anticipates are deep breaths. There's no sinking weight in his stomach or screwed-in tight chest feeling of disquietude and the muscles Tony can gauge control of attempt to respond.
He feels somewhere is his orphaned and lonely soul the fervor that he needs to  his life to uphold the dream with true loyalty.
Steve shakes his head and smiles worriedly, “No, son. I just want to help. Where are you from? Let's get you cleaned up.” Steve compresses his wings, lays the boy's arm over his shoulders and drags him as they limp out of the alley.
(He won't be taken anymore, he decides. Afghanistan and Howard did that enough. He won't let the world take his soul, no matter how ill fated it already seems.)
(The serum may have enhanced his determination and stubbornness but inflates his will to love. His Ma would be proud, he knows.)
Somewhere beneath the ice for decades, the black of Captain America's wings symbolize Saint Michael, leading the war through hell to salvation.
(In that exact moment, no one catches the beat that Iron Man's arc reactor and Captain America’s heart make.)
Widows and divorcees are incredibly radical for having plastic surgery for removing their wings; it's as blasphemous removing ribs for the sake of being skinny.
Nothing is not darkness and his mind is spinning but not really because there's nothing to spin at a-
“A fucking fairy,” the leader boisterously sneers as his gang of merry thieves snickers. The young boy’s face is bloodied and crumpling. “What a cocksucker.”
Steve's voice is hard and bitter, his mission tone seeping through with anger and his boots hit the floor with a definitive stomp. “Whether or not we tell the public is not your decision, Hill. I know my goddamn rights for Don't Ask, Don’t Tell.”
“I'll ruin you.’ Paranoia paints his tone and there's an anger and fight in his eyes. “I'll destroy your soul and no God will see me as enough. You only want this because of some drug. No one will see us- I mean, me-”
It's not fair how much his mind wanders into what ifs and domestic familiarity for Steve's wellbeing.
Love. It's a strange word and not one Captain America ever associated more than his country and Lord with.
Tony figures as much years before Loki comes to earth and wreaks havoc, viewing and hacking into enough confidential files from the FBI, CIA or other special Intelligence agencies to erase doubts, but to know is entirely different.
How soulless is he in Steve's eyes? Does he believe Tony is worth a world of white? Or will he leave Tony to the wolves, to be dissected and run over, scavenged by vultures and his own inner demons once again?
His soul may not belong to someone, but his spirit belongs to liberty and freedom. What should have broken his resolve to carry on in this world proves his sacrifice to love the cruel world that made him unlovable.
It's still taboo for people to cover their wings with dye or tattoos. It’s less lews for individuals to walk in public without them out. Why banish God’s blessed mark? It’s as similar to a face tattoo, Fury remarks, when Steve first comes out from the ice, floundering and choking on this decade’s air. Maybe Steve is old fashioned but he's not stupid to think humanity's trends would get any smarter.
Only Pepper and Rhodey know of his true wings. Rhodey nearly bursts into tears when he finally sees them; after a week of locking himself in his lab, he forgets to dye them and Rhodey bypasses JARVIS' security. Pepper pinches her nose and lets out a shaky breath when after an argument over schedules and his regular appointments for dyeing.
Steve pushes back on the envy that claws at his soul and throat; he’s Captain America, a war hero with power and a commanding presence, not Steve Rogers, an undoubtedly doomed soul of a hopeless hopeful in the new world.
A boy the locals call ‘zombie’ is laying drugged and dazed, identical feathers sprouting from his wings. Neither child dons a black soulmark until they are terminally infected in the final hours before their death. They mustn't have long now, UNICEF figures.
The mother, Marsha, lights a few candles and speaks in a quiet tone to Steve as she tends to George, attempting to bat her hands away, as Steve eats small pieces of bread. The view of the sky from the window illuminates the eye bags on Steve's face and his furrowed eyebrows.
Steve can’t understand it, the hatred towards a specific kind of people and religion. Steve knows the children being isolated and butchered didn't choose the families they were born into and how they were raised.
And so he fights and in the ruins and cinders of the Chitauri, somewhere lays the Steve Rogers that came out of the ice. Somewhere, the line between Steve Rogers, the boy from Brooklyn, and Captain America, the Sentinel of Liberty, is buried and he can no longer tell them apart.
But when Steve Rogers sees his soulmate nearly die to keep a man out of time around a little longer, his heart violently rots to the same color of his old wings.
When Yinsen asks if he has a soulmate, he responds honestly. Yinsen says, “So you're a man who has everything and nothing”.
He's felt a weak presence, afraid and alone, all day, Tony's lifeform calling for help to Steve's soul.
Steve jumps when she screams and bolts to the only bedroom with a mirror in their dingy apartment. He nearly trips over his own legs and almost bursts into tears.
For days he avoids debrief and the rest of the team, holed up in Tony's hospital room. His mind submerges into confusion and the greater meaning for the both of them. The meaning behind the pair of black wings that can be anything; it can condemn two souls working against fate or serve as an omen, their fates predetermined
(He's not Judas, trading his devotion to the world for some pieces of silver. He's not a harbinger of doom or a traitor.
It's frustrating for Steve to say the least. Stark isn't a soldier and always has an agenda in mind. So, yes, maybe Steve isn't exactly up to date with everything in the 2010s but he knows a predator when he sees one. Despite it all, Steve doesn't feel threatened; just slightly on edge. He can tell Tony is hiding much more than he lets on; like how he flinches at the mention of his wings; or when Thor mentions how soulmates work in Asgard and Tony looks incredibly sad while hearing the god talk; how he walks away when Clint taunts him about making a show of his wings, hiding behind a smirk and an attitude of overconfidence and ableism.
To his left lays the last person he expects; Steve Rogers is curled up on two white plastic chairs, his legs elevated like a makeshift bed. Disheveled doesn't cover his appearance; his stubble is patchy and his skin is sallow. He's wearing a worn leather jacket with an embroidered black and-white American flag with sweatpants. His eyelids are closed and wrinkled,  a butterfly bandage near his cheekbone and small scab with stitches. His left arm is propped at a strange angle in a cast and his blond hair is heavily grimy. It seems he hasn't left the room from his sketchbook on a side table and empty Coca Cola bottles’ dried stains on spruce wood
Tony's been busying himself in his workshop with new suit protocols, the Stark Industries New Year's Eve Gala and Pepper's constant reminders of eat and sleep. He's a somewhat functional human being even if he neglects those things, thank you very much Pepper.
He's overwhelmed and a little burnout at the foreignity of the world, a domain of idolized chagrin and repackaged greed, but Tony makes it home. He's accommodating and sincere. He's lively and intellectual. He's strong and an anchor for Steve to cling to when he's drowning.
Steve has shown he cares when he brings him sandwiches or while he spends that much time in the lab, unintentionally diminishing the mechanic's self loathing. Despite what many people think, he does enjoy harmony and calm, which is exactly what Steve brings to the table every time he hangs out with him. There's an airy waft of order and protection, a shoulder to lean on and a stable person.
He’s lost, he’s afraid and he’s alone. No family or army to lead. There's no hero needed. There's no war to fight right now.
When the dust settles and the battle ends, Steve Rogers looks at the man on the cracked concrete and ash fallingl like rain, without a heart in his chest; the man who he had misjudged the first, second and third time they met, looking at but not actually seeing him.
(In a way, he is Christ, dying for his generation’s sins and returning to believe in a new generations faith and prevent history from rhyming.)
The end of the fight is in view and most of the city is clear. Romanoff is attempting to calm down the Hulk and Iron Man is aiding the military in Doom's arrest for NATO when the comm crackles with tightness.
Steve's never moved so fast in the time he crashed his lips to Tony's. It's everything he's ever dreamed of, fireworks and a sentiment of perfection. The stars are aligning and damned or not, he's clutching Tony's body from jumping like a life preserver in a world of only water.
When he initially arrives at the Tower he sees Banner. Steve wonders how the engineer can be so private, yet convince the doctor who can't be pushed to join them.
The pair has slim odds of beating death, a near miracle, feathers to prove it, and, nonetheless, they breathe, they bleed and their hearts beat for another day. Bruce doesn't grieve for them; this will be the only time they face the prospect of death in their lives. They will live relatively normal lives after today.
When Steve Rogers opens his eyes that day, he sees black. And somewhere, across the expanse of the universe, he begins to believe that it isn't the nature of the damned, but the behaviour of a rebellion brewing against all odds.
He decides then and there that his weapons of mass destruction will never take another soulmate away again.
Abraham Erskine's shine with wonder and pride the night he comes to Steve with a bottle of liquor and a hope of salvation. There's no room for uncertainty, as he sings praises to his soldier.
They need not to be worshiped or prayed for, for they carry out the Lord's orders against Satan's presence and wats.
Media helicopters hover in the distance and military vehicles stand by the perimeter from the Hudson River to the Brooklyn Bridge.
Black. Black like the wormhole or when you close your eyes for too long and small dots cloud your vision. Black wings with peeling flecks of gold rest a top Tony's shoulders, clear as the sun in the sky. A machine that resembles an airbrush is covered with dye the same shade of gold as his sham wings and malfunctioning.
The picture looks soft and ornate, an aura of light and beauty; almost, just almost, emanating element of fondness.
“That's bullshit.” Rhodey says furiously, stalking over trying to get a better look at his wings, clipped and gold dye fading like spray paint.
And he sees his grief and his brokenheartedness and how the odds have always been stacked against him but fuck it, he wants that.
His shadow hits the moonlight so perfectly so it grows intensively behind him as he slowly stalks towards the group.
(Near by, Abraham knows Steve is not Abraham, profiting off blessing and credit. Steve is Issac, the symbol of sacrifice so God may choose to have mercy for human sacrifice, still believing in the will of the Lord.)
“If you value the Avengers’ work under S.H.I.E.L.D., who incidentally seems to avoid mentions of possible end of the world events,” Steve's voice switches from his ‘we’re on the battlefield’ to a tone of exasperation before Tony can stop his mouth from twitching, “you better stop talking and tell your boss to stop. Our relationship is going to be our decision, not some middle-class government employee’s for your benefit. He's my soulmate.”
Steve knows the all too familiar shame of his soul belonging to the Devil, so he doesn't push his inquiry.
Really, Tony's been having flashbacks of the day his wings turned black and the world swallowed him whole.
(Steve is only but the most holy, Job. He is of tested by God and tormented by Satan, suffering calamities and anguish, yet he condemns others as to never curse God; he does not demand but puts his faith in His will. He is man of heroic endurance.)
She says in a clear, melodical voice with watery eyes, “I don't know what this means, but your soulmate is out there, honey.”
He doesn't quite know where he is, and just that, it's unfamiliar territory, beating around dysfunction and a ‘team’ on the brink of turning on each other. He rips it off like a bandaid, cracking his eyes open swiftly and white overcomes his sight, smell and hearing.
He looks at the sleeping form one more time and, not for the first time in his life, three little words make their presence known inside his head. He so ardently wants to say them and not because the man is unnaturally handsome; his kindness, his smile when Tony rants under his breath through failed programming trails, his eyes when he sees something beautiful and his face when he’s drawing something he wants to capture.
There's no time to follow as Steve rushes and kneels near the child. His wings are burnt at the bottom and the neon blue ashy as Steve pats them a frenzy with his handkerchief. He's bruised and covered in grim, but all things considered, doesn't look to need medical aid, Steve decides.
The serum corrects him, alright. His wings becomes stronger and almost as strong as his shield, a steel like material that stands up in battle. The colors of red, white and blue look almost metallic, don't so much as wash him out as the enhance the foreboding and effect of Captain America. He's what the Nazis fear; he’s the Living Legend.
And maybe, he is a little selfish for thinking that way, knowing that Steve probably has a soulmate out there, assured of that same comfort, kindness and warmth that Tony so desperately craves.
He upkeeps the standard color of bright gold before Afghanistan; ostentatious and attention seeking, exactly like a son of Howard Stark.
The gang freezes and one of the henchmen start to retreat slowly into the darkness. Their hands are trembling and they shrink back, paranoid with fear.
In the entire time Steve Rogers fights the Battle of New York, one thing is crystal clear: He'll fight for the preservation of the world, damned or not. He'll die for it again if he has to.
He tries to ask Bruce briefly during their first interaction, whose white wings are spotted deep green from gamma radiation on the very bottom, if there's ever been a case of someone without a soulmate.
The Hulk is suddenly in Tony's eyesight, smashing Doctor Doom into concrete while Captain America is suspiciously quiet.
I still don't have a concrete plan for how our boys find out they're soulmates. I'd love some advice.
Steve who is too scrawny to get up from being kicked down with his wings out without stumbling or fracturing his stem.
It’s weeks after the Blitz begins. Every paper stand is filled with the New York Times and The Daily News, photos of London in turmoil and distress. Steve's stomach churns at the knowledge that England could turn into gas chambers and a faceless mass grave.
He drops Barton off on top of the Rockefeller Center and takes to the skies, battling with an exoskeleton of steel and a heart of war that's constantly bleeding.
And so, he will fight; be it death or judgement or green radioactive monsters or the universe pulling Tony away from him but he will no longer fight love. Because it is a sign.
When Tony Stark sees a room of white, he nearly jumps out of a medbay window, pulls the tubes from his body and runs.
Pepper, Tony's mind supplies hazily, but she's supposed to be in London not babysitting one of his many screw ups. But for all he knows this is it, the last his involvement in the Avengers and a goodbye to a family that was never his.
“You're not Satan.” George says suddenly, smiling proudly. “You're selfless, a saviour. His worst nightmare.”
It physically mimics his face but it's not right. There is no brokenness or Merchant of Death in sight.
He doesn't remember much aside from drinking until he forgets how soulless he might be and J.A.R.V.I.S. disabling most of his machines and projects.
He doesn't think of his soulmate after that. He can't afford to. He has a mission and he has orders. He fights not for himself, his soulmate or his country, but the greater peace illuminating over humanity.
The crusade is draining and lengthy but there aren't many casualties. It's just a scratch in comparison to the cataclysm of the Battle of New York.
It's like dropping and watching in horror a glass break in front of you as Tony eyes his wings from top to bottom.
He doesn’t dare to say it out loud and wonders how long will Steve stay here. He can treasure those few moments for when he’s eventually left alone, like he always has. No one ever sticks around long enough.
(No one knows in that moment how Steve Roger's wings are not hexxed with black, but a combination of every color, a balanced euphony of the universes' best qualities.)
(Somewhere, Elpis, the Greek personification of hope, is ablaze and thriving, kindling her eternal flame with the love from purest of soulmates in a Tower in New York)
Not to mention the likeliness hemodynamically instability and the possibility of developing respiratory failure that keeps his prospects for complete recovery low.
It's not safe and Tony is barely out of the woods and it's all the captain cannot do but run as fast as his legs can carry him past agents and specialist,
To be the supernova in the galaxy. For a supernova is no longer rare in the cosmos when you have a large enough sample size, thus rare things become common.
No matter who he is, as the wormhole swallows him and spits him back out makes him an archangel, redeemed and powerful.
And so, in spite of the rest of the firmament bombarding two condemned black sheep, Ananke ignores her daughters’, The Fates, calls for Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, smiles and waits.)
He doesn’t feel as fearless as he once felt. As much as he wants to run and be Steve Rogers again, a boy without a soulmate and a purpose, this is his time. His time to prove he’s no longer a prop for the war, a hero long gone and forgotten, a dancing monkey for the government. No, it's his duty to serve.
Loud clanking shoes grow quieter as the sound of a door slams shut and Steve's weight sinks to the bottom of the bed. He stays stanstill there for a solid five minutes before shuffling.
But there is the hopeless romantic side of him, fantasising that Cap might have hope for his soul and lack of a heart.
Tony Stark is sprawled across a loveseat, head in the lap of Steve Rogers and wings outstretched lazily.
Though their love is obvious, it doesn't stop the spiral of his abundant breakage. His ego and image can't compare to the lonely, hopeless nights of drinking and the nameless faces with wings that will never be his soulmate.
Unlike the no good punks who pick on him in crowded alleys and push him into chipped brick walls for being a small kid. The ones who tell stories 'round the block about combing the ocean, climbing every mountain and scouring each building across the world to find their one and only.
The remark cuts deeper than Tony will ever admit but Iron Man suddenly lifts fifty feet in the air with Clint in tow, letting out a steady fire of chemically altered arrows exploding in the heads of droids.
When Stane goes down, he says through gritted teeth, “You'll never repent enough to replace your soulmate”.
He shouldn't let the color of the wings beat him. The same way he beats death in the ice and time travelling to the future.
It's from his hairs on his necks to the space in between his toes; not quite a presence but a simmering oncoming. It fades and buzzes pleasantly, fiercely potent and temporary. It's
Heart in his throat and soul on his sleeve, Tony gives in to love and kisses Steve with a frenzy and warmth, a flawless calibration in the planets, the stars and the black holes.
In that moment, they are merely pawns of Puck, dreaming and dreaming into his mischievous plans for fate.)
Ruining something refers to a certain animosity; destroying everything and setting it on fire so the pieces can't picked up and strewn back together;
But really, Iron Man isn't some grandiose delusion or a form of Noah's Ark. Iron Man is Tony's choice to be more than a warmonger’s legacy and more than a tin man without a heart.
He travels the world for Stark Industries, hacks into the Pentagon and the FBI's databases to find something. Something that proves he's not alone. If he's a medical anomaly, he cannot be alone
He has a choice. To impact his reality. To live, actually live, the life he has in front of him or not.
Tony doesn't believe in God, but he damns anyone and everyone that commanded the force of soulmates.
Peggy doesn't have the same pity in her eyes as Bucky, when he stays over at his apartment and small parts of his feathers peak through from carefree happiness. She had a burning strength in her face for the future and the war.
Steve knows what it's like to have an identity that's shamed and to exist without choice. His wings almost jump out at the thought.
Tony's eyes flutter open and he sees a room, lived in and expectant. There's an established relationship, one sided of someone waiting, a bible, sketchbook and blanket spread around like it belongs, the other person empty and vacant. But they compliment each other; they belong.
The feeling can't be described. It's worse than grief or isolation. It's a manifestation of a breakdown, a panic attack plus someone yanking your heart and all hope out at the same time.
“I show not often my thanks, contrition or adoration. I am sorry. You are the Potter, Lord, and I am like clay in your hand. I may not understand your ways, Lord, but I am blessed for finding my other half.”
The more he's around Rogers, the more he's uncomfortably aware how the Captain America façade that he's spited for years is evolving into something more than admiration.
There's just enough street lamp brightness that his face is barely discernible. His frame is barely discernible as he cautiously steps forward.
He's drying his tears and observing Natasha’s uncharacteristic care, handing him a coffee and a fresh shirt to change into when it happens.
Is this it? Steve Rogers taking out a soulless killer and a legacy of shame, a spotlighted antihero for evangelists and believers.
A low hum of Christmas music is playing in the background and on a TV screen, a cheesy Hallmark film is playing.
If God damned him from the start or he sinned so much for the Devil to take notice, it does not matter.
At least his shell gets him to the desert, the military helicarrier and Rhodey. Rhodey, who grasps Tony so tightly, like he's sand slipping through his fingers. Rhodey, who doesn't stop staring at the arc reactor and shrapnel where his sign of humanity should be. Rhodey, whose eyes burn with manic paranoia at Tony's wings.
Steve can't help but let the cynicism of irony fester; a damned soul fights and dies for freedom and awakens to the war in his soul never ceasing.
To come face to face, close enough to feel the Chitauri’s dying breaths; to watch terror grip a planet so divided among petty politics and morals; to see the End Times stretched in front of a hollowed out suit and know that he stands on the tightrope of end or beginning of humanity; to know that he is what stands between salvation and perdition is all a bit much.
There's no more malice that night. Just hope and tears. Tony feels something in his chest, where palladium was but days from taking him from Pepper and Rhodey. From taking Iron Man.
It's like seeing the devil in the mirror every time he opens his eyes and then attempting to forget it.
Steve stares blindly down from his floor's balcony, eyeing downtown Manhattan in a generation of quiet; he watches smoke plumes, electric yellow taxi cabs, bright lights and all.
As Bruce Banner leaves on a fisherman's boat towards the docks of Port Blair, he emits the details of survivors.
Shame boils in his stomach and the ‘what ifs’ of Steve being a fag in the 40s stop him cold in his trust and faith in the universe's power.
Upstate New York is sitting pretty, a landscape from a postcard in another time, undisturbed and ungentrified. The sun is setting, a base of periwinkle, blended with orange, yellow and pink commanding the sky, the shadow of night emerging at the edges of the celestial sphere, acres of dark hunter green oak trees and bright amber, blush and cobalt flora bordering beneath the obscure skyline of New York City. The railing is silver and reinforced; Tony is collapsed at the edge, swaying and crying, as he heaves into the evening light.
“Ma, Bucky, if you're listenin,” His voice is shaky with a twinge of Brooklyn dialect and nervousness. Steve's hand barely brushes his fingernails and all Tony wants to do is grab it and never let it go, “I found him, just like you said. I know you'd love him and he's perfect.” He sounds vulnerable and on the brink of tears, a stark contrast to his earlier conversation with Hill.
Vivid bright colors usually pair with outgoing personalities. Colors are not known to change for anyone. The general belief is that they represent one’s fate.
It's an orchestra, woodwinds and brass, percussion and strings. A cacophony that transforms into an euphony, bells and piano notes, a constant rhythm and melody overtaking his everything.
He's safe but that's not a comfort.  In S.H.I.E.L.D.’s medbay, waiting for something sinister that he can't connect.
Captain America, an undying optimist that should be too perfect to prevail in the 21st century. A man who solves wars instead of creating them. A martyr and a saint that flaunts everything Iron Man will never be.
Sensation abruptly blares through the side of his temples and Tony can discern his entire body. His mind is foggy and there's a forced tranquility.
His Ma says later that the church would use him as proof of the devil. They would shame and hurt him into never loving someone. Stick him on a corner shop behind the glass display or at Ripley's. She would never want Steve to live without love. That's worse than any death, Steve knows.
Perhaps Tony is Atlas, condemned for all eternity to carry all the possible timelines and the world on his shoulders.
What I am not going to point out is how long this chapter took me and how exhausted I am from trying to make that last line make ANY sense.
The formality soon disappears from a soldier in church and back from the war into a young boy, forlornly praying under autumn nights and Brooklyn stars for love.
But then, the battle flashes like a camera shutter behind his eyes, and Steve sees Tony almost die. He sees Tony's moribund figure, impaled and surrounded by a bloody halo.
Because it ruins every ounce of bravado in his twisted core that someone could fuck with his anatomy like this. That he could be a test rat for a drug that S.H.I.E.L.D. is developing to imitate a soulmate. To play on his deepest hopes and fears, secrets so tightly vaulted away that he would never have to worry over again.
There's a loud crash as the young boy is slammed to the garbage tin next to him. He's heavily bruising as the seconds tick by and Steve's vaguely aware his ribs are at least fractured when he sees his wings.
All his life is coated in black; wings, a cave in Afghanistan, the space where his arc reactor lies, a wormhole, the color when he shuts his eyes and the legacy of a Stark.
Before the serum, his wings are in poor condition. He's only 5’4 and his wings are too short, barely extending in width to his wrists and just to his head. Dry from Brooklyn's weather swings and years of cramped suppression, matted and clumped. They constantly look fractured or broken from desuetude, slumped at strange angles and lopsided from his body weighing too little. His ashen and brittle feathers that fall out at the tremble of his immune system failing. The image resembles a bat being scavenged by rats the times he washes them out with water.
Steve isn't the smartest but he knows damn well Tony should be dead. He'd been sick enough to know how small the odds were in the 1930s to make it to 18. Project Rebirth saves Steve's immune system then and there during the war.
Red flags are already going off in his head and his stomach drops about fifty stories down. He hardly inches open the glass door, not wanting to startle the billionaire, when the scent of wing dye invades his enhanced sense of smell.
Azreal is the angel of death. And though he's the Merchant of Death, it doesn't quite fit Tony. Azreal helps people cope with death. Tony just builds it.
J.A.R.V.I.S. is scanning for heat signatures as Tony plunges in front of the disintegrating structure.
The idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together when the world needed them to to fight the battles humans never could.
He's shuffling across the city when he sees a kid, at least 10 years younger than himself, several yards away, cornered by three leeches; they're all a little taller than the poor child in a dim cobblestone alley; they're all huddled behind a smoke store, the boys wings being shoved into a the ground, wings sparked with fire. He's pale and limp, shrinking back at the intensity of slurring pejoratives. Two of the asses are flicking matches towards him.
“I'm no fag!” George blurts out, panicky. The bartender glares at the two boys at counter. “He can't be mine, it's a crime.”
Steve knows what it actually is and what he is ashamed to confront. He's scared. He doesn't know how to love in the twenty-first century.
(With his red, white and blue wings after the serum, he still fights for the little guys. He just fights with more power and confidence in his bones)
The building is coming down fast and Tony doesn't even hesitate as he soars through wreckage, past disintegrating columns and crashing bricks. The fire is burning the suit and he's hysterically screaming into comms, “Steve!”
(The day he wakes up to a cave in Afghanistan hooked up to a car battery and his heart ripped out, he thinks he may be wrong.)
People pick on him for being skinny and short. He gets kicked by idiots that are bigger and broader, with wings that are patterned and stronger.
He asks Yinsen on the day of escape, feeling like he could die ar any moment, point blank if he's ever heard of black wings.
He holds his breath for a few seconds to stave off an oncoming panic attack when he discerns that Steve's chest stops heaving. He goes still and Tony can imagine his heart stop beating through his shirt.
He may be the Wizard of Oz, a fraud and a sham with no real magic, disguising his actions as a solution to problems he invents and an Emerald City, a fabled paradise with shiny glamour serving as a distraction.
When Steve Rogers watches his wings turn black, the world was at war. Maybe that in itself is a sign from the beyond, but regardless, he can't afford to let his fantasy of a soulmate or the possibility of ‘what if” control him anyway. His service to his country.
He knows that Lucifer won't tempt him with the gluttony of hopelessness and burdened wings that scream blasphemy.
Perhaps the Hindus are right and the Christians commit blasphemy every Sunday at Mass. Perhaps the Muslims are being laughed at by the loas of Voodoo. Perhaps, deities are sneering at Buddah and Judaism in their holiness.
“Jerk,” he replies without any malice and a pounding heartbeat. When he pushes out of Bucky's arms, he sees a brother's love. Stuck together and connected, happily or not.
Steve takes in a large, grounding inhale and Tony can feel him hovering over Tony's body, knees pressing the rails and fingers ghosting around his chest.
It gnaws at his core how much he wants that; intimate ease. It blooms in his lungs at the knowledge that he'll ruin Steve if he tries to love him.
Steve breathes out, slightly frustrated, still trying to inspire hope. “We don't choose our soulmate, George. We only follow their mark as guide for our fate. Those punks chose to hurt you, not destiny.”
If the Last Days are the Battle of New York, and being the archangel was proven by flying a nuke into a wormhole and falling back out, then maybe, just maybe, he can believe it.)
Stark men are made of iron, he doesn't need someone who will melt his iron heart with the acid that turns his heart so cold and wings so dark.
Maybe he could choose to be Hercules, hiding in a suit from Medusa, persevering for the greater good, but still in agonizing fear of being turned to a hollowed out, emotionless stone.
It’s around 1.A.M and he’s just wandering around, his wings restless and relentlessly screaming, trapped.
It's a somber and sobering familiarity; he accepts its icy grip and its emptiness, no depth or variation.
Tony ducks in a deep breath. Be professional. He sternly commands through his heartache,  “Cap, we need status upd-”
Steve crashes into the ice and regrets never truly searching for his soulmate. In his gut, he understands something in present time. If he was alive now, perhaps this was God's force, willing him to serve for his duty, to find his other half.
So, darkness is his home. It's not a place where anyone else can break into or destroy it. And after so long, whether it's from bottling emotions or years without someone to call his own, he becomes the darkness.
You want heroes? So be it, for your own comfort, but when the snow falls in the Manhattan celestial skies, they are human.
He doesn't tell anyone except Jarvis who holds that day as he cries in the house of pristine perfection the day before Christ's birthday.
Steve can't help but wonder if he's Calypso by starting to begrudgingly like Tony, trapping others in his own hell and keeping someone who isn't his.
The scent of sugary popped corn mocks his stomach that's never quite full and the mist of the beach revitalizes his nostalgia. He sees stand the swooning couples with wings outstretched, mirroring a chrysalis of matching patterns from the side. Joes in uniform stand with an arm wrapped around dames shoulders at concession stands, they resemble two angels, almost illuminating an aura of serenity.
It's not exactly a letdown in Tony's opinion, moreso a drug trip. He can sense Steve is constantly moving in between punching or interrogating him, keeping everyone in the Tower on their toes. Tony's not exactly conventional and his tower is a little more than some new tricks for an old dog to learn but there is something Tony's missing. Something Steve is getting closer to deciphering the longer he stays in the Tower.
Maybe, the tabloids speculate, he becomes Iron Man to save himself from Gulmira or maybe to repent for his sins of murder. A hero is what keeps faith in mankind, after all.
There's tears cascading onto Tony's perfectly poised arm and a fidgeting, battle scarred soldier pleading into his hands, muffled pleas and mumbled orisons. “I repent for my sins, David, Mary and Jesus. Please forgive me, for I only want to see my other half open his eyes. Amen.”
Fate knows Iron Man and Captain America are twin flames, polar opposites destined to be enemies and perpetually be at each other's throats.
It never stops the feeling of his heart breaking when he sees dames with their boyfriends and husbands embracing and holding onto each other like they can't let go.
The fact that he'll never prove himself enough of an Avenger to Captain America is somewhat shattering,  to say the least.
It's why he's careful letting anyone besides Pepper or Rhodey around him. Pepper, who doesn't entertain his bullshit and calls him out when he's drowning in his own head; Rhodey, who never stops reminding him why he's more than Howard and more than a warmonger.
When Tony Stark opens his eyes that day, he see white. And somewhere, deep in his soul, maybe he believes that white isn't so bad after all and the black on his back isn't as homey as he thinks.
The room is warm and the scent of hot cocoa evokes a peaceful serenity. A Balsam pine tree piled with a variety of presents sits underneath homemade ornaments and a topper that resembles a certain spy's bow and arrow gleams from above.
Tony Stark knows he'll want perfection more if he gets more attached than he already is; it's just a matter of whether he pulls the pin off the grenade or he's in the crossfire.
Bucky later holds his arms around Steve's boney shoulders and says, “You're still the same old guy, punk.”
“After my wings turned black and serum, I didn't want someone. I was afraid, God, of who I may belong to. I was ungrateful because I didn't place my belonging to you or faith in your hands. After  the ice, I didn't think it was even possible for someone to be out there anymore, much less a man.”
(Supernovas are indeed rare but there are billions of galaxies; so if you have a sample size large enough, rare things become common.
He only prays for the God to strike him dead later that night after several bottles of tequila and a conversation with Jarvis about his parents being stuck in France that he won't remeber in the morning. It's only when he receives nothing, he realizes that his heart is never to belong to anyone.
“We all try to get by”. Marsha smiles at Steve. George is half passed out on their table and looks mischievous, as a 10 year old boy should.
(He is not who he feels, King Lear, blinded by ignorance, but Cordelia, the symbol of virtue and mercy in the stark contrast of society's greed)
A young girl, no older than eleven, is staring at him teary-eyed in a makeshift clay hut. She wears pure white wings and a solid black feather on each side, resting at the very bottom. Protectiveness and hesitancy radiate from her towards the figure below her.
When Tony Stark watches the sky open and the Avenger unite, he knows there is nothing more important than that moment.
His heart is so full, but of what he doesn't know. There's so much emotion in his chest and feeling in his body that he begins to cry. Everything is loud. Something in his body is pounding booming like thunder, blinding like lightning.
He's off the coast India a year after New York, with an isolated community too small to consider a town, when he finds it. He's been working with containing an outbreak of a rampaging illness with UNICEF.
Despite it all, he twitches at feeling like the man out of time. He wonders if Loki is right and if he really is anyone without a war.
It's only after Tony has locked himself in his lab on his floor for three whole days when Steve goes down to force him to eat. It's not uncommon for Steve to be considerate for his comrades, despite his internal conflict to outright confront his... emotions about Tony. He sits in Stark's workshop, sketching or reading while intermittently taking mental notes about him.
A door creaks open and Tony holds his posture rigid. If this is his moment for judge, jury and executioner, he's glad it's with Captain America. He might as well be Hades bound to the Underworld, outcasted from Olympus, doomed for all eternity.
The Avengers serve as a good distraction but he's isolated himself in the past few weeks. He gets like this sometimes, so stuck in his own head and self loathing to normally function. Although he feels like he is a burden to the Avengers, he knows a few days will pass and his anxieties flip to the back of his existence.
Jesus, Tony thinks, shielding tourists with their phones and tablets flashing from being burnt to ash, villains aren't getting more original, are they?
Tony hasn't thought of anyone else on the team besides Steve since awakening, while Steve is here neglecting himself to ensure a teammate's health.
But he's afraid to destroy someone's soulmate, alive or dead. Once someone saw the real him, there might be no going back. Is he really that broken?
Maybe Zeus saw his complete soul and, out of fear of its strength, split it in half and turned his wings the color of where his heart would be missing.
Because that's what it's been since the beginning of the end. Blind hope to get through Afghanistan and palladium poisoning; to have remarkable individuals fight the battles the world never could.
The Avengers debrief, Loki is gone and the united part ways. The world returns to its former disarray. Tony invites all the Avengers to stay at the Tower; only Steve takes up the offer soon after. Steve travels some around the country before he truly realises how much the world has changed.
Maybe it's the Manhattan frost of November or the same loneliness he felt at 15, waiting for his parents and crying over a damned soul that's throwing him off.
The boy is incoherently mumbling, teary eyed and crumpled. Steve attempts to help the boy up and he fumbles shakily out, “Are you the Devil?” at Steve's extended wings.
The girl, Chaandra, named after the the word moon in Hindi, and the boy, Rav, the beginning of the Hindi word for the sun, have no family left from the disease and their wings a pulsating in synchronicity.
Steve's heart breaks then and there. Even if his soulmate is dead or unholy, Steve's not being tortured by the universe for a tangible attachment to a bully.
“There is nothing is wrong with you,” Rhodey's voice is strong and decisive, his eyes blazing with something, like pride and love.
Dyeing his wings isn't an aesthetic choice. It's a must. It starts from fear and self consciousness of what people would say. What doctors and research scientists would do.
Money is stringy and he lives frugally. With his list of maladies, he's lucky to make it through the winter with only a broken heater and a broken heart. He can barely afford a cheap bottle of Veno's Cough Cure.
Tony tenses and subtly inches his hand for the remains of an arc reactor prepared for scalding pain when he feels his entire body beat.
His wings are menacing and the little luminosity shines black velvet with an almost red-like flesh in the alley lights. They extend up and out into the air, above his head and Steve becomes the truest image of The End Days.
Tony never searches high and low for his one and only. He figures by the time his parents die that he's damned anyway.
Judas, Icarus or pawns of Hermes they are not. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are only and purely human.
(Somewhere distantly, Tony still feels like Ares, the Greek God of War and destruction, or Narcissus, in love with only himself.)
The universe would never disgrace whoever Captain America's soulmate is, probably a martyr, savior to those in need, beautiful and strong willed.
Whether his soulmate is dead, alive or a sinner, he knows volunteering to be the lamb of sacrifice instead of waiting to win the honor as the lion is his duty.
When Tony wakes up from a heavy hangover days after he's been outside his workshop, the entire Tower is blaring an alarm, red lights like flames as far as he can see. It's a call for the Avengers to assemble.
Seconds before he crashes his bird into the ice, he wonders if this curse on his back sealed his fate or if he chose this path because of it.
Fury attempts to diffuse Rogers’ state of a mental breakdown by lighting a match to a different fuse. The public and missions and the Avengers.
Steve will deny it until his deathbed about how much attention he pays to this ‘teammate’; he notices just how shiny and plastic Tony's wings always are. He wonders at first if they're machines like his suit but notices how defensive he gets when Clint quips, “Your wings are as flashy as your suit, Stark.”
His mind wanders farther into the dark rabbit hole of what Steve Rogers would say if he ever saw his true wings; evidence of the damned. He knows the great Captain America would deem him more than God's abomination.
Black. Pure black, the type your see when you close yours eyes for too long underwater or when your blackout for a moment. From the stem to the edges, a velvety darkness encompasses his wings and furthermore, whatever was left of his soul.
Two men, defying the constant odds of death and struggle, inner strife and outer judgement inundating their providence.
The scent of something strong like rotting feathers causes Steve to reel back out of door and stumble to the floor outside Stark's workshop.
Tony may know that as true as the shrapnel in his body, but he feels he owes the world virtue instead of vice.
Each black wing represents the times that they will face near death and the odds they will be together again.
At first it is because he can't wrap his head around it; why anyone would want to be with someone so… extravagant, vain, selfish or outrageous. The war teaches Steve about selflessness and remaining realistically positive. But seeing Tony lying in Manhattan's remains,  having risked his life for the sake of humanity, he can't stop thinking that Stark- Tony -is some form of noble.. He doesn’t put himself first, but he likes to pretend otherwise. Why? Steve doesn’t know.
Steve's hears the color rumors thousands of times all his life. He memorizes them in hopes that he'll wake up from the nightmare that is his wings and finds a blessing from someone. He wishes some nights for physical proof that he could be a martyr instead of a sinner..
Bucky's wings are a normal off white color, like the color dingy recruitment posters across New York, with dark navy in the center, shaped like a C.
It eliminates the opposite of some twenty years ago, a boy's wings vacantly deemed soulless and a soldier's soul numb in Artic rime. A time of hopeless blind hope, no greater dumb as it is a prayer to gods and deities, titans and saints, or saviours and sinners.
And yet, it is Hades who laughs at the very concept that two men with love and divine purpose so pure could ever belong to the Underworld.)
Steve walks George back home two miles near Midwood and his mother ushers both of them in. She drags George by his ear to their kitchen and shuffles him into a wooden chair.
She is beauty, she is grace, she is not Miss United States because this hoe doesn't know American history. I also don't know anything about Brooklyn, so I'm sorry for location issues.
burying the ashes and building an empire on top so no one will give excavation a second thought. Society will chalk it up to being one of the world's greatest unknowns or a sign of a higher power.
There will always be new wars, Steve reasons, and always be manipulation and fear rhetoric to chase society to make bad decisions, whether it be Doom Bots or bank robbers, people who believe they're soldiers or saviours, and above all.
Most cases of black wings are nothing but rumors and only TV tropes depict black wings on villains. There was even a racist theme during segregation in the 1960s of interracial couples' wings turning black.
He doesn't truly fit in the army. When his parents and Bucky are dead, he wonders if he was ever meant to belong to someone.
It stands that Steve knows he won't find them. The world is too vast and he's too optimistic; his heart break will again before a new war stitches it back together if he's not careful.
Steve doesn't show his wings in public after that. It doesn't stop him from being picked on for being gawky.
He can't afford to dye his wings like those California dames or even wash them every day. He keeps them retracted and hidden. Out of sight, out of mind, he futilely reasons with himself, wide-eyed as he cries shivering at night, knowing his soulmates brand always burns at the back of his neck.
The thought terrifies him and he's intensely aware that Steve can probably feel fear chilling down his body.
When the ice beneath the arctic begins to thaw out, so does whatever feelings surrounds Steve's soul.
He doesn't know in that moment if his soulmate is dead or evil or just a person in the middle of Iowa. But he feels alone. So, so alone. Under his skin is the feeling of dread and self loathing because of course Tony was never going to have a soulmate. It's not like he could ever be loved or worth someone's heart. He's a Stark. He never deserved anything from the world.
He sees Rhodey and Pepper. He sees Natasha and Barton. He sees Thor and Bruce (even though the Hulk is in peripheral vision). He sees Captain America leading the war.
What the fuck is this joke, Tony bristles. It's not real. It's not funny that he's half dead in a undercover base with morons who hate Iron Man and drugs in his system that are making him hallucinate.
So no, Tony concedes, Afghanistan does not ruin him. Now the list that does would be a hell of a memoir and one remembered forgotten night too many.
He continues to let out evenly paced breaths and tries to stay still before Steve whispers out a prayer.
He decides that even if his soulmate rejects him or dies, he won't be the ignition of the End Times. He won't let the symbol of predetermined fate rule him anymore.
He dives into the ice as Steve Rogers, not Captain America; the kid feeling lonely without a soulmate but prideful, never have learned his lessons for fighting for the little guy.
He's righteous and forthright, but unbelievably modest. He's a beacon for American values and annoyingly stubborn. Although he is more of a man than Tony ever feels he will be, Captain America is unexpectedly human. Despite his front of ‘ask what you can do for your country’, his zealous morals and never quite dropping his captain role around the Tower, he's exceedingly average.
So, maybe Steve is an idiot for still believing in God, he can't help but cry and pray the entire day he sees Tony's near lifeless form, paralyzed by tubes and wires working overtime to save him, a hole in his chest where a soul aches from years of neglect.
There's a thick strain before a voice through gritted teeth enunciates, “Stick to your duties, Stark. Don’t get involved here.” Steve's tone is cold and uncharacteristically protective, with no room for Tony's usual ignorance to orders, “Stay where you are.”
Clint's wearing some biohazardous mask and is prominently wearing an assassin’s glare when he asks, “Fashionably late for everything, Tin Man?”
Black. His scraggly and uncoordinated wings that haven't fallen grown in are darker than the view from the balcony at midnight.
Fate sends the Morai to certain souls, perhaps to extinguish their lifelong suffering or to prevent them from the future that looms in the horizon.
Both sets of wings are extended out, one black and the other red, white and blue. Tony can't help but self consciously pick with scarred nails at his feathers. Steve bats away his hand every time, smiles genuinely with devotion and passion in his eyes and continues to run his hands across Tony's wings, memorizing every crevice and corner.
Not so much a memoir more than a eulogy of how the world burnt a prodigal son into a traumatized shell of a man.
He learns the boy's name is George. His father is a baker and he has a younger brother, just 6 years old. Steve feels his heart ache for someone so loved and blessed to be cursed at the same time. The gang’s ringleader is from his school and mocks him everyday, calling him a queer.
Tragic flaws, blind hope and all that, for better or for worse, they simply are glued together though the universe tries to pull them apart.
It really would have been easier if Steve had ripped out Tony's chest before; maybe then, he could be beside himself.
His mother grabs his arm before he leaves and her eyes shine with earnestly and murmurs, “Thank you, dear. God bless you. He may work in mysterious ways, but He brought you as the shepherd to my lamb.”
It's nothing like the carnage of the Chitauri, haphazard and uncoordinated, robots malfunctioning and Dr. Doom looking equal parts villainous as awkward, waiting for an Avenger to interact directly with him.
Steve cannot understand how the same men who sneer at folks in their kippas and women in tallits outside synagogues supposedly want to lay down their lives. He wonders if it's a form of proof for some of the soldiers; that they're manly or strong enough; that they've cunning enough to make it back alive; or perhaps that they're scouting the world for the universe to bring them soulmate as the stars align perfectly.
George stared in disbelief and tilts his head. He asks in a naive voice, inquisitive and unfiltered, “It’s the same as your wings! It shows you're an abomination! A sinner!”
He squints. Everything is uneasily quiet and untouched. An oxygen mask lays over his mouth and nose. There's a soft item huddled around his body like he's fragile and a few tubes rattle as he shuffles in this cocoon. The smell is sterile and overly sanitized it makes Tony's eyes burn with too much. Several machines in his peripheral are wired further than his visions lies on his left. In front of him is his body and guard rails, a wall with a clock and a door. Hospital walls are a blinding white and royal blue curtains frame a wide window and block any sunlight. The ceiling lights remind him of the sun, burning and radiant.
He's hears the talk of studies, beyond his skill level, scientists with needles and a human test subjects; theories if colors are by chance or biology and if it is a matter of constants and variables.
Tony's never heard so Steve demanding or hard. He can picture his expression, definitively defiant and eyebrows furrowed. Maria huffs out an annoyed resignation and says, “Maybe you should see if you two even have a relationship, Captain.”
It's not okay and Tony feels like Papa Legba, loa of fate and Keeper of the Crossroads, is playing tug-of-war with his heart.
All his life with black wings, Steve searches for signs, be it from the devil or God. He searches for meaning and a fight and beliefs to physically attach to his character. Steve fears his entire life until his death that he isn't searching or doing enough and that he isn't enough for Christ to find empathy is humanity's sins.
They call him ‘Winghead’ because of his uniform. Even if it's not meant to be affectionate but he feels like the nickname is written in the stars, regardless of the fact that he's bluffing as the Sentinel of Liberty instead of the son of the Damned.
He can see it behind the mask of iron and gold, a suit harping on the saving grace that is hope. He sees two futures as he flies over New York in rubble. One stands as inconsequent humans, divided by triviality and worshiping false gods, devoting their existences for the universe to tell them they are better than all the rest. The whole of humanity thinking they have an impact on the rest of the galaxy.
(When he hears during the war the rumour that Adolf Hitler's wings are black from the edges in, he nearly drops dead and shrivels back into Steve Rogers, the pint-sized kid from Brooklyn. He realizes after, that people admire Captain America because he's the Sentinel of Liberty not a sign of God's disgrace. His wings will never stop him from being America's son.)
Assassins and soldiers are spread out in the lounge, a Norse god is feasting and scientists are singing.
His asthma and fumbling stops, his confidence grows and his selflessness thrives. His patriotism and sentinel tendencies overcomes his desire to find a soulmate
A small family is huddling outside the ruins, shaken and breathless, when the youngest boy, tears down his face, cries out, “Mommy, where's Captain America?” in anguish.
He wishes his wings would have been rotten from birth in Afghanistan as his dye fades and his feathers fall out.
Maybe he's Icarus, too blinded by his own judgement to notice he's flying straight into the sun, melting his fraud wings of wax.
He thought that after he had woken up in a new century and quite literally had crashed into the ice that he knew loud. It's an overwhelming feeling, one where there's no option of escape or choice. It takes over every sense and drowns logic with existence. And after so long, he becomes the loud and there is nothing else.
Steve who is susceptible to every illness you've never heard of; whether it's scarlet fever, smallpox or polio, asthma attacks from taking the long way home behind store fronts, or nearly breaking every bone in his body to push his way through the crowds of the subway.
It constantly makes Tony feel uneasy when he see its, the image of a happy and loving American dream. As fucking if.
Though in that moment he knows he should feel like at a breeze that may slip away into oblivion at any moment, he feels renewed.
They stumble into the bar; Steve pays for drinks, applying vodka and bandages to the bottom of his wings and washing the boy’s face clear of pain. Steve checks him for a concussion and makes sure he can adequately walk.
He's managed to yank his face mask off in bewilderment after his wings extend when he notices his chest. A hospital gown is full of holes where his rib cage is, IV lines and some sort of electrical cord attached to a machine that resembles a computer.
His wings splay out on the bed and hit the rails; they are stripped of dye and neatly maintained. The feathers that Tony always assumes are coated in the aftermath of dyeing for so many years, bruised and breaking, are somehow more intense with color. It's like his immune system is sending his soulmate a message, pulsing with energy and life.
Tony fumbles like he's been restrained, and a heart monitor beeps faster and louder, when he realizes he's not swaddled with a blanket but his wings.
(And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them. Revelation 9:6)
Not that'd he'd care if someone said it because he does not believe in faith or God or whatever the church spews.
Tony's used to his company in the workshop, a constant presence of responsibility and gentle, unwavering attentiveness. Steve will bring coffee and sandwiches when he's locked up alone for too long, convinces him to shower and sleep and has the power for Tony to go weak at the knees for anything he asks.
Steve's wings turn black a week after he turns 13. His Ma sees it first and screams when she gets home just before she heads out for her morning shift.
But she's seen the Trojan Horse approaching Tony, Steve's facade of wings or fake content with loneliness.
He's been outside on the verge of an asthma attack, avoiding clouds of tobacco and hollering alcoholics in front sketchy bars near Bay Ridge. He ducks his face further into his Pa’s old scarf to avoid any confrontation and any homeless stragglers.
Now he'll surely force Tony to quit the Avengers, his only redemption and family left in the world. He's an Irish-Catholic from the 1940s and the last thing the all nationalist Captain America needs is a commando without a soul.
His metal armor that flies out Gulmira can protect everything except his heart. But it's okay. His heart can handle breaks, the Last Days and a legacy of killers.
Maybe it's the loneliness of being a Stark, knowing people care more about his name than who he truly is. Maybe it’s the feeling of solitude, that no one in the world has black wings like him and knowing that if he has a soulmate, they’re better of without him. Maybe it is just that he doesn’t know how not to feel like he belongs anymore.
Three little words are on the tip of his tongue and spelled out, heart on his sleeve; he knows their truth because he would give his life for that man without a second thought. He would rather be in this state than ever see the world lose the Captain again. He may be damned, but a world without the physical epitome of justice is a world where evil has truly won.
He's 15, in a New York City mansion on winter break from MIT waiting for his parents to call and say they can't make it in time to celebrate again.
White isn't his home. It brings light to problems and flaws; it ruins everything and hurts everyone. Tony hates it and almost retreats back into the darkness and inebriation.
The lab is a mess and his wings are no longer gold. Dye is speckled across his and the scent of expensive gin and fresh paint is overbearing.
He’s marching out of his private elevator before he can second guess himself. He's a Captain and his team won't fall apart on his watch. He stands in front of the workshop’s doors and notices that they aren't locked. J.A.R.V.I.S. is silent and the afternoon sunlight is absent.
A sigh of relief screams from Steve's mouth and Tony can hear him shuffle slightly and the click of a button when heeled, even footsteps begin to approach outside the room, muffled by Steve's shallow breaths.
It's all happening in slow motion and Tony can't handle this, he can't bear the thought of leaving the world without their hero and hope, he can't, he just can't-
After his Ma is buried near Pa, Steve wanders a few times to Mass for guidance. He hears the whispers, slumping his head in the back pews and listening to the sermon on how He is constantly with him.
He wonders while fighting in Europe against Nazis and Red Skull's army, if becoming Captain America and saving millions of lives will ever compensate for never finding his soulmate.
The war is over. They said the Aliies won. But  at what cost? Steve doesn't think the battles are ever truly over.
“Father, forgive me, for I have sinned; envy and wrath have come between my gratitude for your grace and presence.” Tony could never think of Captain America as a deadly sinner or a man beseeching for exoneration. The event is putting him at unease and he feels like he may throw up, knowing of Steve's Ophelia complex.
It's not the bristle of winter coming and the New York Bay's embrace that day that has Steve shaking that night.
Tony's barely manages to tune into comms as Iron Man blasts twenty of the bots from Times Square; the sound is deafening and disorienting as several voices fill his ears.
Captain America sees Hydra’s secret weapon and that history doesn't repeat itself, but that it rhymes; a man who believes himself godly and an obsession with divide and conquer.
Iron Man lands behind of Hawkeye near Madison Square Park as he obliviates a swarm of bots cornering him.
Iron Man blasts Captain America out the window as a steel beam impales into his chest, where his heart should be, and the building buries Tony Stark alive.
But he wouldn't go back. He can't when his soulmate is down a corridor on life support. It wouldn't shock him to learn that he knows Steve is his. Perhaps, it's shame, hate or rejection. Perhaps, it's Tony fighting his belief in God. Perhaps, Steve is better off to keep running.
Shout out to my amazing betas, Lily (LilisBooks) and UniversalPie, for putting up with me. They've made me happier with this fic. You both are amazing, my loves! ♥️♥️♥️
Steve pauses and is choking on tears, “If I am an abomination, Lord, then forgive me. But I take this as your blessing and sign of your watchful eye.”
As the sun sets in the horizon, days of dread and horror impending, Steve clutches Tony, two broken souls that are bound and destined to fix each other.
What makes it concerning to Steve is the gangs ringleader has the exact same pattern, stretched in every exact crevice, but the same color is more of a migraine inducing blue.
He about to sprint and wrench Tony away from the edge when the engineer whips around, reddened eyes and inebriated composure slipping.
Tony thinks in that instant that this is his team; his family and his home. Even if his heart is destined for war, this is his, soulmate or not. The Avengers are dysfunctional and imperfect, sure, but they’ll avenge the world so no one ever doubts the universe's power for good to prevail.
“Hey!” Steve shouts. All four heads whip quickly to their left to see a shadowy figure. “Why not pick on someone your own size, you sons of bitches?”
Panic replaces the peaceful demeanor of the room as he twists his wings, attempting to constrict them away from the world. Grief and woe wash over him and the room is spinning.
The loudness is big. It is all encompassing and without remorse. But so is Captain America, fighting for the world to survive.
Steve sees an entitled man in a tin can with a status complex, an arrogant imposter of Howard carrying the brand name.
He is Captain America; he's never belonged to a person, solely the ideals he represents and defends to his dying breath. He’s Captain America, leader of the Avengers, who need him uncompromised and relentless to put the world first. Tony deserves someone who would treat him as his priority and someone's person.
Tony's wings are a rare, brilliant gold like his suit; bold and eye-catching, but not too flashy or whimsical.
Steve's sketchbook is opened, a page lightly shaded, eraser marks pooled at the sides and edges serrated. On it showcases a man's eyes closed, a serene look and an oxygen mask.
Steve wonders if God damned him from the start or if he is destined to fall, no matter his efforts. Is he apart of a prophecy or can his faith can be rewritten
He read encyclopedias, catches up on history throughout documentaries and deciphers as many classified documents as he can to do avail.
Maybe it's the blind hope that the black that drowns his wings is proof that God needs him to be more true and selfless than anyone. It's why he enlists five times from five different towns.
The workshop is in shambles, broken bottles of alcohol scattered and scraps an Iron Man suit model buried among the wreckage. There’s none of the usual liveliness or energy of the era of technology in the room. There are no small robots whirring around Tony's projects happily or complex machines finishing details for a new Widow's Bite. It's dark and somber and the feeling of despair looms in the air. Tony's back is facing Steve, passed out on a desk and that's when he sees it.
Vaguely, he can tell his eyes aren't even open. There's a ringing in his ears, not from a plethora of sound but abundance of nothing. Time doesn't exist and Tony can't feel any emotions.
When Steve Rogers awakes from seven decades in the ice, he is drowning In loud, from the change that is death to life.
“Love can move mountains. But even with all these things, if I do not have love, then I am nothing. I gain nothing if I do not have love. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud. Love is not rude, is not selfish, and does not get upset with others. Love does not count up wrongs that have been done. Love takes no pleasure in evil but rejoices over the truth. Love patiently accepts all things. It always trusts, always hopes, and always endures. Love never ends.”
(In a way, his wings are not a sign he has forgotten God's grace, but proof he has been in forgotten gods’ graces)
Iron Man sees fear stoking rhetoric and a man with a bigger ego complex than himself obsessed with power and vanity than the earth itself.
It's the final thought that shoves Steve back into the elevator, biting on his fist to stop the tears and barricading himself on his floor for the rest of the day.
He jogs at a slow pace past Brooklyn Museum, past Osbourne and all the crummy neighborhoods for years before his wings change color. Searching for a sign and for patterns to memorize.
(If you believe it, there's a small possibility that it is a sign from Athena, goddess of wisdom and protectress of heroes. She very well knows this is no Trojan War and Ares need not to be defeated.
Tony's in the worst condition Steve's seen; the arc reactor has to be completely dug out of his body and the suit literally has to be torn from his skin, piece by piece. The staff are barely certain he's still alive when they pull him out and send him into surgery. His lungs fully collapse and his body has to endure extensive blood loss. There are more broken bones than Steve can memorize. His nervous system makes slow progress, tediously reconnecting to his brain.
He wildly scans Steve's face as he stares at the portrait of himself, dark hair, eyebrows deliberately precise and all wrinkles smoothed out and pristine.
He's loved the man even before he knew he was alive; he’s wanted him before Steve's wings turned black. It's written in the stars, somehow. Tony's kindness always there to shield him from the horrors of the new century, the uncertainty of waking up in the middle of an entirely new battle and the feeling of loss he carries from the ice.
He knows his appearance represents strength and freedom, but he feels lonely. No admiration from strangers during the USO tour could ever stop the sinking weight in his stomach
Church scene with Steve. It was going to be after Sarah Rogers' funeral and Steve was supposed to second guess his faith (or meant to be in a chapel in hospital while Tony is dying)
Tony dissociates and he knows Steve takes tremulous gasps of air before shuffling out of the room and footsteps descend away from the door.
But right now, he feels more like Icarus than ever, a fraud with fake wings falling deep into the abyssal sea, dragging his twin flame along with him.
It is a symbol of The Great Flood not The End Days. For they are Noah's Ark, hope for humanity and deliverance come hell or high water.
It's only in mid battle that he notices Steve's been ignoring him for a few days; he doesn't entertain the engineer's antics but Tony can feel the tension radiating off of him, replying to none of his typical quips or banter at Tony's sarcasm.
Steve is enhanced in every way, good attributes and beliefs outweighing the bad in society. He fills Tony with hope and motivation to be better. He helps Tony turn buried ashes into diamonds.
Everything inside Tony is frozen and it takes all his willpower to not yank every tube out, punch Rogers in his face and run as far away as possible, crawling back into the same corner of the world that cursed him.
“I love you, Tony,” is whispered like a prophecy, holy and precious, through tears and Tony shaking his head. “I've been damned, unloved and banished my whole life. This is my home; with you. The only thing left that can ruin me is a life without you.”

No one has black wings. Very few have ever said to have black patterns on their wings. People like Hitler or fucking John Wayne Gacy. People that are the purest form of evil.
(When the Battle of New York ends, the dust settles and creates what wasn't there before; an opportunity to rebuild.
He knows he shouldn't get attached. It truly is his worst trait; his undying ability to see the best in people, to care for people who could never love him back. He might have the strength to salvage parts of the broken pieces of humanity and hold it close enough to his soul. So close, that it’s capable of leaving him in pieces. It's how he lost his Ma. It's how he lost Bucky.
My betas LilliBooks and UniversalPie have been such an inspiration and if you fight them, I will come for you.
Maybe, just maybe, Steve thinks, it can save their souls and bond forever. He knows that if he faced Tony, he will crumble and give his heart, mind and soul to the genius, willing to end with a broken heart if it meant his soul could truly belong to Tony.
And the minute that Tony Stark, the man without a soulmate, flies a nuke headed straight for Manhattan into the wormhole that leads to the abundant emptiness and end of humanity, he feels his heart beat.
When he gets pumped full of the super soldier serum and becomes the world's first superhero, his wings turn red, white and blue. Bright red and blue stripes, stark lines vertically on the top half and pure white taking up the other half to the stem. More stubborn, more balanced and stronger than ever, he feels larger than life.
In that moment, despite it being the world that brought him World War 2, his bastardly father, took his mother from his grasp, Afghanistan, the arc reactor, Stane, Vanko and the world's eye constantly waiting for him to break, to crack and to give up, Tony sees it.
If he is son of the devil or reprimanded by God, he'll take it. For once, he'll take it so no one can take the only thing that is guaranteed to be his in the world. He'll suffer and take humiliation to keep his soul. He'll fight for the freedom to hate and love because those are all a young Steve Rogers sacrifices for the greater good. If there's a future for Steve, he wants it now.
(When Steve Rogers sees Iron Man fly a nuclear missile into the wormhole and fall back out, he thinks avenging the world will suffice.)
Iron Man is erratic, narcissistic, spontaneous, anxiety prone, doesn't play well with others and is a (borderline pessimistic) realist.
Steve should resent God if it is his destiny to sin with greed and envy. But he doesn't because his Ma raised him with love and hope for serendipity.
Steve knows Tony never mentions his soulmate. It's curious, but not unheard of. There's always a chance of rejection, although illegal in some countries, or shame.
The trolley tracks are gone, the phone wires are buried underground and the city's evolved. He doesn't really belong in the new century.
It's 11 P.M.,  a week after Thanksgiving Day and Manhattan is being attacked by enhanced Doombots spewing toxic gas and fire. Most of the Avengers are already on scene. Doctor Doom is on top of the Empire State Building and the robots aren't going down without a fight.
Bruce watches Rav stop breathing for a whole fifteen minutes in the shack. Rav's heart stops and so does Chaandra's when Bruce is about to declare him dead and unrevivable. When their pulse comes back moments later and their symptoms of danger begin to fade, their wings turn black before his very eyes.
Captain America follows orders, feels home in high stake battles, is capable of beating the odds, stays calm in the face of lost causes, a team driven leader and stays equally patriotic as he is hopeful.
Not quite enemies or a nemesis, through fighting Loki and the Chitauri, but not exactly twin flames.
Religion or righteousness, true or false, in the end, it doesn't matter if black wings are a devil's kiss. It doesn't matter which group of humans clinging to blind hope in their made-up beliefs are right. It doesn't matter if a higher being is a puppetmaster or a sham Wizard of Oz.
The heart monitor starts beating harder, and he blushes, hating the physical effect that Rogers has on him.
(Somewhere, Hera reminds Zeus that he should fear two halves finding each other, two men with the power of a titan.
(Tony never sees it, but he is Dorothy, wanting to go home to his soulmate and making friends along the way, following the yellow brick road of faith, bridging and aiding his friends’ despair with family. He is simply a traveler making a difference in a world that he has no obligation to.)
Tony's life, has been made of small unseen circumstances and opportunities. Thousands of last minute decisions and high stake events.
Steve is on his back, gasping and bloodied near a window on the seventh floor, trapped under part of a subway car as a 100 ft support beam begins to descend straight for Steve's chest.
His thoughts he suppresses rise until he's suffocating in them. He barely knows Tony but he feels like they've known each other for years. There's a cozy and natural feeling around him; nothing is coerced or fraud. It's a way of life that Steve grows more comfortable with throughout his time in present day Manhattan.
Steve knows Corinthians and trusts the Oracle as he repeats the words of a church that shuns an asthmatic, broken boy.
It's not hopelessness that burns down his spine that day. It's a desire, a dream or a fantasy that could maybe have been. The wonder of what if. A house and children, a wedding and a rocking chair on the porch: a life after war.
He wonders, not for the first time, who his soulmate could be. For a man like Stark, there has to be someone who can truly understand the complexity and mystery that is the man behind the armour. There's an emptiness in his chest and something resembling envy is his mind as Steve breathes through his thoughts.
Tony attempts to remain neutral in his distress when a boiled kettle sound escapes from his mouth. It's half a cry and half cynical scoff.
