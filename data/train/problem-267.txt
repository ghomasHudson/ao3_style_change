I agree with your sentiment on physics. I see no purpose to knowing why and how things fall or if the earth goes around the sun or not. As soon as exams are over, I’m deleting it. I would do so now but the university course I’m interested in taking requires decent grades in all sciences. Chemistry is my favourite of the sciences. It is incredibly useful and the experiments are somewhat enjoyable. In fact, that’s what I want to study at university.
“I seriously doubt that this is what Hippocrates had in mind when he wrote it.” John lowered Sherlock back down onto the pillow anyway. He first kissed his black eye, gentle and affectionate. Then he kissed the cut at Sherlock’s cheekbone, to bruising at his jaw. His mouth found itself at Sherlock’s neck and kissed that too, despite it being (for now) decidedly bruise-less. Sherlock couldn’t complain, now that the kisses were becoming more heated and teasing and wonderfully distracting from the pain.
Although I still believe the concept of soulmates and magic books is unexplainable and therefore ridiculous, I want you to know that I think that we are one of the lucky few couples who are completely, undoubtedly, inexorably successfully matched. And for that, John Hamish Watson, I am grateful.
John shook his head, then reached for the bow tie lying on his bed as he attempted to tie it and forget everything invading his thoughts. Except his hands were still shaken in mind-forged rage. Damn his over-active imagination and jealousy. After many attempts, he looked in the mirror to find that the bow was not in fact tied at all. Not neatly anyway. It just flopped pathetically at his chest. John sighed.
In this lighting - a dark room illuminated only by a few candles - Sherlock's eyes were dark and dilated, the blue-green irises merely a thin ring around his pupils. John had to breathe deeply to prevent himself from audibly sighing at how the light contoured Sherlock's cheekbones and Cupid-bow lips, shined on his black hair. And the fact remained that John was leaning so incredibly close to Sherlock's face. So close.
"Terrible business, this is. But I'm sure it will all work out in the end. It always does around here." Sherlock was sure that last bit wasn't so much addressed at him as herself, but he nodded along anyway.
Hopkins re-entered the room with some of the forensics team and leant against the door frame as she said, “Time’s up. What can you tell us?”
"It was for the greater good!" The man all but screams back, at least confirming Sherlock's theory. "Besides, you're not the police. I can tell. You can't stop me."
Mary's near-constant smile faltered for a second. "I'm not. I was British. Am. Whichever it is." Mary pushed a strand of hair behind her ear and looked up between John and Sherlock (mostly John) with the face of a reluctant martyr. "I grew up with my parents in the UK until I was about six. I don't remember much about my childhood. But I know I was happy.
"Good." John stood on the tips of his toes and kissed Sherlock's forehead - as warm and heavy as the real thing. "Find him. Or her. Them. Whoever is doing this. He won't hesitate to do it again."
I agree that the story is a bit stupid. I think it’s just their way of saying that no one really knows how it works. Except maybe a secret society that hides in caves and kills anyone who dares to try and discover the secret science behind soulmates. Who knows.
Sherlock presses his lips together and shakes his head. John winces at the question - he should have told them about it earlier, to make sure the topic wouldn't come up - and presses his knee against Sherlock's under the table. “No. No pets,” he says finally.
"Yes, obviously. A cult which focuses primarily on preparing for an apocalypse, both in terms of their physical needs and spiritual needs. What I imagine happened is that these three victims left and threatened to tell people about the cult, which most likely had a darker, more criminal side to it, and in response the leader had them killed and the tattoo cut off as a message to the other members."
But Mary was staying over at the Watsons'. She was meeting the family, having dinner and... sharing a room with John.
“Yes. Cambridge, studying chemistry.” Of course. “You studied medicine in…” Sherlock’s blue-green eyes darted across his face. “London?”
19:37 I spent all day with the two of you yesterday planning your wedding. I can assure you there’s nothing to observe. You’re both very happy together. SH
"Consider this as - an incentive. A reward for working so hard for the exam. Just the once, then we can go back to your dull revision sessions. For me. Please?"
Sherlock would have stayed in bed all day, and preferably all his life too - at least until he could completely delete the event from his head - if it weren't for the train leaving Hogwarts today. He looked at his watch: nine o'clock. Five hours until the train leaves.  That's five hours of trying to avoid John and Victor.
is alarmed by sex, the idea of being wanted and wanting in return, being so vulnerable and exposed; but
"So what did the Aurors say when you told them?" John asked. "Are they going to start looking for him?"
Harry slaps his arm playfully. "You're one to talk. I just wanted to meet the guy that has John smiling like a total idiot every day."
John opened his mouth to speak, to find the right word to say, but faltered. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have interfered.”
"Of course not, Mister Literal, Mister Must-Correct-Everyone." John snapped. "You know what, fine. Talk. Ask me questions. Ask me my dick size for all I care. I'm pretty much an open book now."
"I'll be fi - John!" John had grabbed Sherlock's wrist and was now dragging him towards the tree. Sherlock ducked obligingly, rolling his eyes, to get inside the hollowed tree, and was relieved to find that the 'ceiling' was high enough that he could stand up straight without hitting his head. The only issue was that, though the tree was wider than average, it wasn't wide enough to allow both him and John to have some sense of personal space inside it, and Sherlock ended up with bark pressed up against his back and John standing right in front of him, his face almost pressed against Sherlock's chest. Sherlock's heart sped up rapidly from John's presence, even if they were now going out.
“I can’t afford to relax. Moriarty is back. We have to be at least two steps ahead of him if we want any chance of defeating him. He’s quiet, too quiet. We have to be prepared.”
There the conversation ended. John looked around at the boxes above, and just out of the corner of his eye, to his right, he could see Yanovich leaning slightly over his private balcony, seemingly entirely unworried. John supposed that he had been given the assurance that Sherlock Holmes was working on his case, and had the utmost confidence in his abilities. Though John didn't doubt Sherlock's talents, there were many things Sherlock couldn't do, and stop a speeding bullet was not one of them.
"There's no Moriarty. Not for the last three years." Sherlock's face drains of colour. John just feels confused. "He shot his brains, out after all. You of all people should know that."
His exhaustion catches up with him and he falls asleep curled up in the chair, his hand wrapped around John's wrist as the thump, thump, thump of his pulse calms his mind into unconsciousness.
"Patience, dear." Moriarty placed a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear. She resisted the urge to move away, to flinch. "All good things come to those who wait."
"I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it." John kept his eyes fixed on the ground. Sherlock wasn't sure that it was for this necklace they were searching for. "Well I had. I'd thought that maybe we'd - go our separate ways. After we leave Hogwarts. I go into medicine. You set up your detective business. We keep in touch for a while then we just...forget. Move on. That was until we - became boyfriends." The last word lingered in the air for a second, and Sherlock relished it. "Then I never considered what could happen. I just focused on what was happening now, y'know?"
John looked at Sherlock's cheek - the cut had stopped bleeding, leaving small traces of dried blood around it, but it still needed cleaning. "Hold on. I'll be back. Try to stay awake."
“Just subtle things. Like, ‘oh this actor was born in 1967? Coincidentally, that was five years before soulmate journals were legalised between same-sex couples in the UK.’ Or like, ‘you know, I hear that Maurice is a very good movie.’ I haven’t received any responses other than small ‘hmphs’, which I think is progress,” he says optimistically.
And Sherlock, you are dramatic. You are the most dramatic person I know. Only a dramatic person would find plaid shirts so appalling. If you're going to react so strongly to my taste in fashion, be sure to expect me in the ugliest plaid shirt I can find. You're lucky the weather is too hot nowadays for me to wear my jumper. Perhaps I should postpone our first meeting until it gets colder so you can get the chance to see it.
"We would have heard father calling us down for breakfast by now otherwise. Also, I heard them talking about it yesterday." Conveniently loud enough for Sherlock to hear and fully aware of the significance of their last day in the villa together. Mr and Mrs Holmes were cleverer than their sons cared to admit.
"And then one after your shift. The whole experiment is based on the variable of sleep deprivation."
Next to John, Sherlock's eyes widen slightly, like he hadn't prepared at all to be asked this (John supposes that Sherlock spends so much time talking about other people and what he knows about them that he forgets that most people would want to find out about him.) “Well, I’ve been informed that there isn’t very much that John hasn’t already told you.” Sherlock raises an eyebrow at John, who smiles into his pasta dish.
Sherlock gives John A Look. The 'Don't be an idiot' look. "Come on, John. Surely you saw all those actresses and singers and girl groups on her walls?"
Sorry for the last short 'filler' chapter. This one is longer and has lots more plot in so.... Have fun I guess.
“Would you like to come up?” Sherlock asked at the same time, before they both paused, both equally surprised and giddy.
“If you want to get to where they are at now, you have to do exactly as you are told,” the man hissed, “no questions asked. Got that? Say ‘yes, Mr Moriarty.’”
When everyone stood in alphabetical order in silence behind their cauldron, Professor Slughorn gave them the go-ahead, then everyone got to work.
"I can imagine. The great Sherlock Holmes had no idea I was in love with him? You're a disgrace to your name." John was teasing him.
John let go of the bed frame, then slowly, slowly took a step forward. That went well, so he took another. At this point he collapsed, his knee buckling as his arm shot out to the bed frame to keep himself upright. “Fuck!”
He clears his throat. "Sorry my plan fell through. And I didn't get tickets in advance. I know you really wanted this."
After a week of sitting at home, then driving down to Baker Street to drop off Rosie before heading down to work John decides thatm Mary be damned, he will move back in with Sherlock. If anything, logically speaking, it would save him the constant driving from one part of london to another every other day. in reality, it's because the more he continues with his routine, the more he misses Sherlock's company and the excitement of 221b, where routine used to be completely non-existent. Besides, Mycroft predicted that Mary could be out of their lives for the next year or possibly more. He's never wrong.
"Safe from what - oh, I see. Safe from us. From the two boyfriends. From our 'PC bullshit agenda'. Don't want her getting influenced by the wrong sort, right?" John sneers.
"Fine." John and Sherlock get up out of their seats towards the door. As they leave, John vaguely hears his father's voice mutter, "I told you he should have reapplied for a new journal."
John snorted. Just when he thought he wasn't going to stick out as the uncultured plebeian. "Opera glasses. Jesus fucking Christ - "
Suddenly, Sherlock was violently pulled out of dream-land into the real world as a beam of light flashed in front of his closed eyelids. A lumos maxima charm, obviously. He grimaced and, as the light began to fade, shaded his eyes with his hand and attempted to identify the idiot who decided to wake him.
The room of the dead body was lit up by the lights the Yard had brought. The wall paper was peeling and there were dead flies at the one, small windowsill in the room. Sherlock looked down at the body. It was face-down, but he could see enough from where he was standing: female, early forties, married, dressed entirely in the same hideous shade of pink, right down to her painted fingernails. Her hair was messy and slightly damp, weather beaten.
"You mean from Molly attempting to blind us to get our attention? On the one hand, I've stopped seeing spots," Molly and John chuckled, "however, I am ninety-nine per cent sure that you have permanently damaged my corneas, so - "
The man chuckled. "Do? Nothing. Believe it or not, Miss Adams, you are of some use to me. I wish to speak to you."
"You'd be surprised. I'll eat some too if it encourages you." Molly grabbed a chocolate frog and opened the packet, eating the chocolate swiftly and reading the card inside.
John's heart had sunk down into his stomach, but at least he now knew that his feelings were at a dead end.
At first, I have to admit, I wasn't particularly keen on meeting your family. This is in no relation to you, but simply the idea of meeting a family at all. And your friends. It seems like a lot of people to offend, which I may inevitably do.
She hesitates, before admitting, "It did. A guide for parents of same-sex soulmates. It's very educational."
The next few years were a blur for John: he gained his qualification as an army doctor, went through training, continued to date other people, until he was eventually shipped out to Afghanistan. He was kept busy with his work - extracting bullets from wounds, restoring dehydrated soldiers unused to the Afghan heat back to health, making adrenaline-fueled decisions on the spot that kept him calm as he saved the lives of many. There were times where he rarely left the medical tent, swamped under by injuries - though sometimes there wasn't anything worse than particularly infected blisters to deal with. It didn't matter how busy or how exhausted he was, because it meant, for the most part, that he could forget about Sherlock. Yes, there were times where he wondered about him - whether he ever went back to rehab, if he was clean yet, if he had left Victor yet, if he had met someone new and far better for him. He thought about him with a kind of melancholy, but with little regret. As far as he could tell from his letters from Harry, she was still as happy and sober as when he left, and even writing a new play. He planned to get tickets (for free, thank god - his wages didn't always allow for luxuries such as seeing West End Plays all the time) as soon as he'd come home for leave.
"You practically are, though." Sherlock glared at Janine, and she quickly back-pedalled. "Well, maybe not. But still..."
What?! How could you forget to tell me your collarbone was broken?! That is incredibly significant information! If I had known you were in that much pain...Well, I suppose there's not much point in thinking that now. Still, shame on you, John Watson. I hope you update me on your injuries properly from now on.
Attached is a recommended reading list in order to prepare for your studies next year, additional course costs, and a list of accommodation choices with prices, as well as any financial support you may need.
It was a fairly harmless and, Sherlock had thought, obvious statement, but John had a surprised expression and looked in silence at him for several seconds. "You want me to work with you."
If you think I was scared off by you admitting something so simple as you wanting to kiss me and liking kissing me, then you must be even more of an idiot than I had originally thought. No offence.
"Yes, well, I only have a landlady and a detective inspector who only tolerates my presence because I do his job for him without taking credit, though he insists otherwise."
John swallows down his pride and the lump in his throat. They probably won’t remember this tomorrow, anyway. “Yeah. That’s the only reason.”
"No." He heard footsteps creak outside, his father's judging by the heavy trod, so he whispered, "I have to go."
"Oh." Sherlock tried to sound careless, but he felt his nails dig into his palms. "Your parents let you sleep in the same room?"
"I'm not doing it for him. I'm his - tutor. And I'd rather tutor him on something I'm knowledgable on."
He then got the bow from the case then started to play. At first he played the classics off the top of his head: Mozart, Handel, Beethoven. But the cogs were still whirring in his head and when he shut his eyes, trying to appreciate the flowing patterns of notes as they were fed into his ears, he still only saw Mary kissing John, John kissing back and his position in John's life becoming smaller and smaller. So he started improvising; he began with long, melancholy notes which ran smoothly into one another. The tune grew, and soon he added turns and trills which echoed throughout the dorm. He closed his eyes again. This time there was nothing except the piece slowly unfolding in his mind.
"I quite agree. Let's start with the basics, then, shall we?" Sherlock sits down opposite with a dramatic swish of his burgundy dressing gown, which he is wearing over the top of a dress shirt and trousers, John notices with amusement. He crosses one leg over another and takes out his notebook and pen from the night before. "So, John Watson. You got three hours of poor quality sleep last night, interrupted by nightmares. The night before - or rather, day before, before your shift - you got six hours of sleep total, not counting the interruptions every two to three hours when your restlessness and nightmares got the better of you. You are very deprived of sleep and therefore the perfect subject for my experiment. Any questions?"
Sherlock watched John's face morph as he skim-read through the article - from fear to neutral to disgust to anger. "I did not say that!" He shouted eventually.
They got into the train, going off into their, Greg with his friends, Molly with hers, John and Sherlock alone together. Sherlock sat with his head leaning against John's shoulder, his eyes shut as though sleeping.
But as he watched John’s chest rise and fall, the rest of him unmoving, he knew it would be cruel to tear him away from sleep now: heaven knew how little rest John gained while in the army. So as quickly and quietly as he could, he turned off the bathroom light, gently opened his pyjama drawer and put on the first pyjama bottoms he could find.
"Right. So. There's the bathroom. There's Mum and Dad's room - we're not allowed in there, by the way. And there's Harry's room. Done." John gestures towards each door in turn. The door to his parent's room is decorated with lines to indicate his and Harry's growth over the years - John's stopped last year, Harry is somehow still growing and has overtaken him by a meagre but vital centimetre, the source of her gloating for several months now. Harry's room's door has the usual, predictable indicators of belonging to a fourteen-year-old, with a poster of an actress John vaguely remembers seeing on TV, a sign that says 'keep out!', and scuffs from when the door was slammed.
"Good." The boy comes to deliver their coffee, and Sherlock glares daggers at his back as he returns to the counter. John chuckles and reaches across the table, taking Sherlock's hand in his as he says casually, "Well, unfortunately for him, I'm very much taken."
John opens his mouth to say something, anything, to make Sherlock stay longer, but the announcement comes that the train will be leaving in two minutes.
John seems vaguely impressed by even this simple bit of deception. Then again, being surrounded by incompetent humans for millenia, who think it’s a talent to rub their stomachs and pat their heads simultaneously, must put these things into perspective. “God of the underworld, right?”
"Yes. He'll wake up tonight. Hopefully. Maybe. I don't - " Sherlock felt his lower lip wobble and bit down on it to prevent it from doing so further.
John's breath catches in his throat as he takes the sight of Sherlock in. It's nothing he hasn't technically seen before in the pictures Sherlock had sent - dark curls tamed with product, cheekbones, a long, skinny body framed and flattered by a tight purple dress shirt and jeans. Still, to see Sherlock here in the flesh, after months of conversing with one another through nothing but letters and phone calls, it all just feels...surreal. He tries to think of something to say - something witty, something original, something that won't make Sherlock realise how incredibly boring John is compared to him. His brain apparently settles on "Christ, you're tall," then he cringes internally because
Anyway, write back soon. But also take your time with coming up with an answer. As long as it takes less than a week. No pressure.
“I’m not leaving my baby with Mrs Hudson. She’s well into her seventies, she’s got a bad hip, and you very well know about her herbal soothers habit. It’s not that I don’t trust her - “
John followed Kiara into a small room with two seats and a table. They both sat down and the quill and notepad on the table sprang up, to John's surprised, poised and ready to write.
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock scoffs. “Well, I will have a script on me. It’s only fair to you, so I don’t have to keep borrowing it.”
'Are you going to eat that?' John and Sherlock had become experts at unspoken communication over the years.
Don't worry about me 'moving on' too quickly. We're an efficient family, so it was only natural to think about putting things away within the week. I'll be fine soon enough. At least, I hope so.
"But how are these champions selected? Well, starting from the fifth of October, students who wish to compete will put in their names for them to be selected out of this - " with a flick of her wand, The case melted away and was left with a large goblet, with blue flames coming out of the top. The audience ooh'd.
They're both at Baker Street, taking a break and drinking tea in comfortable silence, when Sherlock's phone buzzes.
Jogging to catch up with his friend's long strides, John followed Sherlock through the grounds and up the stairs to the tower.
"I dunno. Something to make up for the fact that I just called you pretty and all but came out to you." He chuckles weakly. "C'mon. The first thing that comes to mind."
(Come to think of it, I doubt you'd appreciate being woken up at 3am regardless of other factors. But moving on - )
I'm also very flattered you would consider me a distraction and a bad influence. The feeling is very much mutual. It's not just the kissing either. I think I just miss you, which is mad, because we only met once, and that was a week ago. But it's true. I'm already looking at my calendar to see when I'm free to come down and see you.
Slumped in their seats, was Yanovich, his wife, and his two children, each with a dart in their neck.
"Three per cent of couples," Sherlock admitted. "Six per cent due to long distance overall. Still far too many. And I don't exactly have the strongest track record of being statistically probable."
When Sherlock would recall that day later on, he would not remember how he sat tensely watching the maze, with only distant voices and flashes of spells giving any indication of what was happening.
"You know," John says once they reach the end of the pictures, "You're not in the last few pictures at all."
Mary and John sat on the coach, while Sherlock talked to Janine. Mary have John advice. "Keep your mind clear. Don't think about anything. Just focus on one thing - something simple." She said.
When Mycroft arrived for the second time with the details of the case, repeating everything word-for-word, it was now decided that they would go in as security, offering them an advantage over being trapped in a seat or backstage with a limited view. It was also decided that there would be at least ten more security guards, despite Mycroft's protests, and they would arrive early enough to check the orchestra's instruments. Sherlock insisted on doing this himself (and with John).
While Sherlock launches into an explanation of how he solved the case, the others listen in awe, all attention focused on him, butting in occasionally with questions. Slowly, he relaxes, his posture becoming less tense and his eyes becoming less defensive. He grins as he came to the climax of his story, when all became revealed, and the audience responds with appropriate enthusiasm. John can do nothing except grin up at him, besotted and proud.
The rehearsal space in question is essentially an empty classroom with the tables and chairs pushed from their shelter in the corner. It is filled with students, standing in clearly defined cliques where people had brought in their friends to fill up the remaining roles. They’re all reading out lines loudly and dramatically, or giggling at the directorial notes Harry and Irene had written into the scripts before emailing them out, or talking animatedly about what role they will be getting.
After half an hour of cutting, dicing, boiling and preparing the ingredients, there was nothing left but to let the potion sit on the fire while stirring and checking the colour regularly. The heat from 45 boiling cauldrons made the unventilated room stifling, to the point where Slughorn gave them permission to take their cloaks and jumpers and ties off and roll their sleeves up. One ravenclaw girl even fainted, and had to be taken out of the room, her practical exam rescheduled. John looked over at Sherlock, and his hair was sticking up and frizzing in the heat, almost creating the same effect as after a session in the Room of Requirement. John looked away and focused his thoughts on the potion.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, sending a ‘kill me now’ look to John, who is biting his lip to stifle a grin. “Be on time.”
"Most likely, yes. Hold on - " In his earpiece, John heard the sound of Sherlock opening a door and a small intake of breath. "John. Get up here."
"We started using the term boyfriend on June 23rd, but I suppose technically we confessed to romantic feelings towards one another a little before that. And we kissed - "
He slips through the crowds of people unseen, into the large building - truly remarkable, the feats of architecture humans are now capable of - and makes his way through the building without an aim or plan. No one stops him, or questions why he’s there or why he has Redbeard with him: one of the many benefits of having the powers of the king of the underworld and the ability to repel mortals.
I keep looking back at what I wrote to see if can spot what made you deduce all that about me but honestly I'm flummoxed. You will tell me right?
"The ministry will be here shortly to take you away," Mycroft said calmly, utterly lacking in any signs of fear: the hand holding his wand was still, his voice was steady and low, he stared Moriarty straight in the eye as he then added, "you and your two cronies are under arrest for murders of multiple persons and attempted murder on a student. You can't escape now."
Sherlock shook his head. "I napped. Not the same thing, apparently." Sherlock raised his eyebrows pointedly, explicitly referring to previous rants on John's half that Sherlock had been hearing for six years.
"Can you not look at a girl without commenting on her looks? And then you boys wonder why we're so self conscious and 'obsessed with our looks' - "
"What always comes, but never arrives?" the eagle said, in a voice barely above a whisper, to which Sherlock snorted and John sighed. He knew that Ravenclaw's password had always been a riddle, which only Ravenclaws could apparently solve, but with one of them drunk and the other a slow Gryffindor...
Once he’s knocked on Mrs Hudson’s door for Rosie and she’s well fed, he starts cooking for him and Sherlock. Almost immediately afterwards, Sherlock emerges from his room as though summoned by the smell, yawning and his eyes still half closed. He’s still dressed in his pyjamas and his curls ruffled and messy from a rare full night’s sleep. As if John needs a reminder of just how much he loves him.
On their seventh session, John actually wins a round at chess. He suspects Sherlock may have let him win, but he's too pleased with himself to put much effort into thinking about it.
“I’m sorry to interrupt,” he says in a - German? - accent. “But I wouldn’t have come if it wasn’t urgent. And the lady downstairs said I could come up.”
He finally arrives at a rundown building that matches the address he’s been given for Sherlock’s hotel.
"I'll leave you two to it," the nurse says, closing the door behind him. Sherlock nods numbly to no one and sits down in the chair next to John.
This was apparently where Sherlock drew the line. His face at first contorted into a sad frown, then as he seemed to recollect himself, he scowled, something that made ice-cold regret land heavily in the pit of John's stomach.
"Are you - are you alright with everything I've just said? It's not made you change your mind about this, has it?"
He changed in the bathroom, as he always did, with haste. John would want him to carry on like normal. And Mycroft. Besides, the other boys were watching. And he could get all his thinking done in pyjamas.
"You don't even have a coat with you, Sherlock." John said, raising his voice above the rain. "You'll get a cold."
John sighed. "Doesn't matter. Either way we're going to end up crossing paths, and it will be  really awkward and she'll either not remember me or be really angry or something..."
"Look, the reason I'm asking about this is because... Well, it's mainly because I was curious. But, also because I want you to know that I'm your friend."
John beams. "You're welcome. Okay," John stood up, putting his hands on his hips and surveying the room. I think we’re done here. People are bringing food later, Sarah and Jonathan have lights, and Darren from across the road is DJing - ”
He walked over to the bed, expecting it to be messy and dishevelled and showing signs of forced removal. How else would a comatose boy not be in his bed? Only, the corner of the quilt was folded neatly and calmly over. John hadn't gotten out in a rush. And he wasn't - at least physically - forced. So how did he get out if he isn't due to wake up until tomorrow..?
They run out of the coffee shop, John quickly turning the 'open' sign around to show 'closed' as he passed through the door. "Police! Freeze!" Sherlock yells, and the man instantly breaks out into a sprint.
Once dressed and clean and prepared with a plan, he went home, climbed into his wardrobe, and cast himself back to yesterday evening, a couple of hours before the play would have started.
"This is all your fault, John Watson," Sherlock growled more than once into his ear, and John responded with a moan and a grin. "Have you any idea what it's been like for me, the past few hours?"
"That's what people DO!" Moriarty yelled the last word out, and it echoed across the room. He shook his head. "Sorry. We'd make a good team, you and I. It's a shame your moral compass is so...ordinary."
"You have to eat. You can't be passing out in the middle of fighting a whatever it is. Besides, you're always telling me off for not eating."
Sherlock frowned in confusion and shook his head with a small smile. "You are a strange man, John Watson, with a strange moral compass."
"So, what did they ask you?" Sherlock asked later as they walked down the library, stopping every so often to grab books.
Kiara shrugged. "If you insists. Next question: are you concerned about the tournament? About how dangerous it is?"
"I know. I suppose I'm rather fond of her as well." Sherlock sips at his tea and hums, satisfied. "What are we watching?"
"It's hardly my fault I'm interested in things beyond house decor." Sherlock puts on his coat - the wool, black one that flows behind him when he walks (and as a bonus, flatters his gangly figure better than any waterproof raincoat would). "Okay, I'm ready. Let's go."
On their second session together the next morning, John doesn't pass out, but he definitely wouldn't have got through it if it weren't for the black coffee Sherlock offers him. He usually goes for coffee with milk, but at that moment he would have chewed raw coffee beans if it meant staying awake for longer so that he won't disappoint Sherlock.
Sherlock takes a deep, calming breath, shuffled closer to John to get a better look at the script (only partially not just an excuse to sit closer to him) focuses himself into the mind of his character (a gay pirate, so it’s not difficult at all) and begins. “Will you stay no lo- ”
"The door in the back alley is guarded by a body guard, who can identify all the cast members and therefore won't let us in. However, this guard will most likely be ex-police force or ex-military, so will have a natural...do-gooder instinct. So what we will do is distract him away from the door."
"He'll be okay, though? I know that muggle stabbing victims have a 40% chance survival, with proper treatment, and that will be greater for wizards, right? More advanced potions, spells and stuff." He was babbling, he realised, but he couldn't stop. "And it was only his side so it probably didn't damage any vital organs. Depending on how big the knife was. I couldn't tell - "
"It's probably bigger on the inside. Besides, only people who want to enter or want to watch the tournament are coming. Even then there was probably a limit to who could come. One hundred, perhaps."
Soon after they finish their meal, which Sherlock consumes the majority of but would never admit to, and part way through Midnight Run, John's phone buzzes with a text inside his pocket. It's from Mary - no one else other than Sherlock and occasionally Harry really texts him these days.
"I'd assume so. Only that line of genetics would say something so completely idiotic." Sherlock spat out the last two words bitterly. "How could he possibly suggest something like that?"
John's fists clench around his cutlery as he addresses his dad, trying his best to rein himself in. "Yes, fine. We kissed. Like boyfriends
"Shush. So later, the sylph appears again and he kisses her. His best friend sees this and runs off to tell Effie, but they don't believe him. At the wedding, the sylph returns and steals the ring that is meant for Effie. James chases her into the forest, leaving his bride-to-be heart broken.
"Good evening, students." Mcgonagall bore the straight face she usually had, but to Sherlock's eye he knew that she was as excited as the rest of the students. "Tonight, three names will be picked from the Goblet of Fire. Those students will become their school's champions, and one will become the winner.
"It's nice to break tradition though, isn't it? Come on, think about it." Sherlock takes John's hands in his. "Nowhere to be, no time limits..."
"He lost a lot of blood because of this." Standing next to the body was Molly, in her Hufflepuff robes, her hair tied back and focused. "But it didn't damage any major arteries. Or organs."
Sherlock steps closer so he can see the baby’s face, but still keeps a respectable distance, as though afraid his mere presence can harm her. It’s adorable.
"That's good. I'm glad." John licked his lips, clearly in deep thought about something. "Where were you at breakfast, anyway?"
"Janine is really not the type. Besides, she likes me and John. She wouldn't do...this." Sherlock stared back down at John. No changes, except his chest had started rising and falling ever so slightly. Despite this all being in Sherlock's mind, he was comforted by this.
Sherlock didn't need to look over at who the man was referring to. Attacking John, controlling him, using him to toy with Sherlock's fears and vulnerabilities like a child with their presents at Christmas was proof enough of whom Moriarty was truly threatening. Moriarty shrugged then walked off back towards Moran and Mary. "Anyway, must be off. People to kill. Crimes to organise. Suits to buy." Moran and Mary followed after him. as ducklings to their mother. "Caoi!"
"I'm sorry the case didn't work out. That Yanovich guy was a bloody idiot to bring his family, but you mustn't use that as an excuse to be angry at yourself. Besides, if we solve the case, and hopefully it isn't an assassin who will actually cause World War Three or something, everything will sort itself out."
"My mum was a mathematics professor at Oxford until she had my brother. My dad works in the civil service too."
In terms of information about myself you somehow haven't already worked out, there's not much to say. I played the clarinet at one point but gave up a couple of years ago to make time for rugby. I think I can still play a few bars of 'in the hall of the mountain king' but honestly don't get your hopes up. I don't have any pets but I'd like a dog someday. I live in North London. Do you live nearby? It would be convenient if you did.
"I acknowledge it. It was a shitty thing to do, and you basically quoted a book at me, but at least you're trying. Can I be expecting any reciting from dad?"
"They won't arrest me. They need me. Besides, are you really going to report your only friend?" John glares at Sherlock, who then accepts defeat. "Fine. I'll tell you what happened."
Sharp fear poked at him slightly as he wondered if Sherlock could possibly know about his gift (and John’s father had been adamant that no one should ever, ever, ever find out about the gift. Ever. The Watson men had been keeping this secret for generations, and the last thing they needed was to get experimented on by some crackhead government officials or to be dishing out favours every day, as he had put it). He covered this up with a flirtatious smile, his eyes roaming up and down Sherlock’s body. “So what secrets am I hiding from you?”
We wish you luck in the next phase of your academic career and thank you to applying for Kings College, Cambridge University.
I will also ignore the rest of your letter. Right now thoughts of parents and interfering elder siblings (who will, by the way, be capable of far more thank 'breaking your leg' should the urge occur, so no pressure on you) are incredibly unimportant.
The next few weeks pass like clockwork as both John and Mary get used to the regular irregularity of taking care of a child. They alternate who wakes up in the night to feed her, who goes to work in the morning, who watches her during the day, with the system only interrupted for the christening, which was rather enjoyable. John got to watch Sherlock vow to protect satan while he repressed the urge to roll his eyes in disgust, and Rosie vomited on the vicar. A good day, all in all.
“I don’t trust him, Lydia. He - oh, I don’t know, gives off this vibe. And his techniques are so unorthodox. Nothing I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been doing this job for nearly a decade now.”
It never got to finish. John yelled out the first spell that came into his head to shut it up - "petrificus totallus!" - and it collapsed onto the ground, frozen in Irene's form, a bitter reminder. Not that it was needed.
"Couple of months. Here, you'll need this. Slow sips." Bill passed John a cup of water with a straw, which John had to restrain himself from drinking all at once. It was cold, almost sweet in his mouth - a vast difference to the water he'd been drinking since he arrived in Afghanistan, which always quickly turned lukewarm under the Afghan sun. He put it down on the table beside him.
"It is." Now it was John's turn to reach his hand across the table and grab Mary's. Somehow this was way, way worse.
“Don’t go into work today. The disappearance of your wife warrants a day off,” Sherlock says from the kitchen.
“Well, I think it’s going to go alright, actually. I’ve sort of been preparing them a bit, you know? Putting them in the right mindset.”
"It's not like Lila will need it. It's fine, I put it back afterwards. And the other victims' phones, after I took them from the evidence room in Scotland Yard."
John's heart hammers as she cocks the gun and points it into the shadows where he is sitting without hesitation. He restrains himself from making a noise, from any kind of movement, following Sherlock's plan. (Always Sherlock's plan.) But God, how much he wants to yell, to scream, to punch the wall and demand why the hell she would try to shoot him - no, try to shoot Sherlock. That's who she thinks is there, sat directly in front of the bullets, obscured by shadows.
"What's there to talk about?" John spat, sitting himself up to face Sherlock. He was standing by the door, fiddling with his hands nervously. "I think everything we have to say is well and truly out in the open."
"I'm interested in him too." The man said in a low, hushed, almost threatening voice. "But he will take extra... persuasion. And I can't help but notice that you're not quite so keen on Sherlock as John Watson is on him. Excuse the double entendre there."
"As well reasoned as your deductions were - " John stammered something out to protest, "they were wrong. But I don't suppose Anderson here knows about you and Felix Middleton?"
"And now he got John," Lestrade told Sherlock. "It wasn't the same person commuting the murders, but it was the same person pulling the strings."
"I find my family too unbearable as it is, without subjecting them to my experiments. I suppose I have Lestrade and the others at Scotland Yard, but I doubt they would agree."
John watched Moran enter the maze through the entrance on his right, utterly calm and showing no sign of nerves. Bastard.
"Oh for Merlin's sake, Sherlock, you're seventeen!" Mycroft's voice rose in a crescendo. "You're barely of age, still in school. You can't possibly think that you are remotely capable of protecting another human life!"
He hated having his personal space invaded as strangers/family members he never knew existed grabbed him and moved him by a centimetre to the left; he hated being put at the front for being short (he was never normally one to be self conscious about his height, but when your junior-by-four-years-cousin is six foot three, you can't help but suppress a scowl); he hated having to shape his facial features into a smile which didn't make him look like a serial killer...
"No - he was very touchy about that comparison. He wants to take over both worlds, without prejudice towards one or the other. In fact, I think he could be more dangerous than Voldemort because of this.
It’s the middle of the night and there’s a frantic knocking at the door. John groans as he rolls out of bed for the third time that night, puts on a dressing gown over his pyjamas, then opens the door with a glare he doesn’t bother to conceal. Then he sees that it’s Sherlock standing there with panic in his eyes and his hair wet from the rain.
Have fun in Scotland with your family and your vile fried mars bars and your...haggis and kilts or whatever. I assure you, you would be no intrusion but a welcome distraction from the board games and sightseeing my parents torture me with on holidays. But if you do insist on travelling up to the cold moors of Scotland instead, then who am I to stop you?
"If you want to be rational, you could just, oh I don't know, accept that I have a boyfriend now? Who also happens to be my soulmate. We're compatible, you know. It's - it's meant to be. How could you possibly argue with that?"
"Good evening, Madam Maxime." John couldn't help but smile at the appropriateness of her name and wonder if it was a coincidence or not. "I hope you and your students had a pleasant flight."
"We can arrange for him to be moved to Saint Mungo's," Mycroft told Sherlock. "He'll be safe there."
"She was gonna shoot you first," John retorts but is cut off by a pained grimace. "Pressure. Put pressure on the wound."
Sherlock shrugs. “I don’t know about divorce, but a man once murdered his wife in cold blood within three weeks of marriage, so I think you did quite well to last as long as you did.”
"No, I won't. Military, remember? I'd just put on a black coat and act like a security guard. We've already been given the earpieces to fit the part."
Then something catches Sherlock’s eye. It’s subtle, very subtle, obviously hidden by years of practice, but just as the doctor digs out the bullet, he waves his hand across the wound, and the room is suddenly filled with - not magic, that inane, puerile word more suited to card tricks of mortals. It’s
John didn’t mind so much because now he could see Sherlock for who he was. A man, skinny from a history of drug abuse, barely out of university, it looked like, and -  holy shit - wearing eyeliner, smudged by sweat from his dancing. Undoubtedly, reassuringly, pleasantly human.
"Did I get her?" John mumbles, trying to ignore the searing pain in his stomach so as not to worry him better.
Over time, the Earth grew and new creatures began to walk the planet, ones created for their intelligence, their empathy, their innovation. New gods appeared too, born from Nature’s power, created to rule over and guide these new creatures. Soon, the universe was swarming with life. It was good. That is, for those able to see it.
It’s totally okay if you don’t want to meet anyone. We could just go to the cinema (legally!!!) and save it for another day, when you feel ready.
John turned again to where Victor was, and exhaled, both out of relief and incredulity - Victor had replaced Sherlock, somehow within the course of a couple of hours, with some other boy. He gritted his teeth. "I'll be right back." He pushed his way through a crowd of Durmstrangs to where Victor was. He tapped him on the shoulder and Victor turned around away from the new boy, concealing a scowl with a forced smile. "John, yes?" Victor said, "I'm afraid that if you want this corner for you and your girlfriend, you'll have to wa - "
“To be honest, I don’t really care what she’s called,” John says quietly. “I - I’ve never really wanted to be a father. And when you told us that Mary was going to have a baby, it didn’t even really sink in. In fact, it wasn’t until the baby arrived that it really hit me that I am a father, and I really, really want this more than anything, no matter what her name is. She could be called bloody… Mackerel Watson for all I care.”
"There," he says. "Mine and Rosie's first day at Baker Street. I think that's something worth remembering."
He briskly walked straight on for a few minutes, feeling his forehead moisten with sweat as the rising temperature clung to his skin. He was surrounded by the stench of damp vegetation and the air thickened, so his breathing grew heavier. The walls of the maze loomed threateningly over him and the cheers of the crowd were lost. He wondered if the audience could see him now, wandering through this terrifying, dark maze as he breathed shakily at the towering hedges. He wondered, as he turned left, then left again, if Sherlock could see him, reduced to a sweaty walking lump of claustrophobia, not knowing what monster could be around every corner.
"Oh, um - " John rubbed the back of his neck and looked down, "The thing is - I had lots of school work - " Lies. " - and I guess I accidentally washed your number off my hand - "
"Of course. But you'll have to compromise on remaining fully clothed and in your chair, for a little while."
"I've been telling him to get a flatmate so he can split the rent. Even with the discount, it's a little too much for him to handle on his own, but he always insists on paying it on his own. Honestly, these trust fund babies, they think that money simply pops out of the ground - "
“Don’t say that. Anyway, I’ve been finding ways to distract myself. Been catching up on shows I’ve missed, working on my cooking skills, getting to eat decent food for once, that I haven’t had to pay for.”
“Maybe. But -” he gives a grunt of frustration. Damn his hands for trembling. Damn his eyes for tearing up and blurring his vision. “What will it take to get you to want to leave?” Selfish, selfish, selfish.
The meeting with Mycroft is gruelling, emotionally exhausting, full of questions with no answers. All they establish is that Mary is definitely missing, possibly from the country, and doesn’t want to be found. Security cameras didn’t pick up any face recognition, suggesting either a very skilled hack into CCTV or a very skilled disguise. Nothing out of the ordinary was detected in the long stream of people buying tickets to get between cities and countries. Everything is calm and normal, and it makes the three of them uneasy.
"Come on, it's pretty obvious. You two are glued by the hip, like, ninety percent of the time. You're both red and sweaty and out of breath - you more than him - and... your hair is all ruffled."
John’s suspicion made itself clear in the pregnant pause that followed. He leaned over to turn the bedside lamp on, and hissed through his teeth when he saw Sherlock’s face and ribs in the bright light. “Oh, love.”
John joining Sherlock on the Family Holiday meant that the two of them had two whole weeks - weeks! Not days! - of each others' company. Two weeks of waking up with John, having breakfast with John, swimming with John, walking with John, sleeping with John. Sherlock’s life was thoroughly consumed. And somehow, in that time, they didn’t fall out even once. Sherlock had expected to become irritated by something at some point - John's gentle snoring which he adamantly denied, his early-bird behaviour every single morning, any reason at all - but it never occurred. John, meanwhile never stopped grinning adoringly at him, even when Sherlock brought back dead crabs and starfish from the beach in a bucket to dissect, and then made their hotel room smell of fish for the next 48 hours.
John wasn't sure how late they arrived at the lake compared to everyone else. All he was aware of was of how everyone was staring at them - including Mcgonagall, with a cold, but mildly amused glare - and that he was probably very red and sweating from the running.
"Mycroft, you're only a year older than Sherlock." Greg pointed out, "Besides, I'm older than you. So stop with the whole 'martyred parent' act."
“First of all,” John begins. “You have to stop this self-flagellation act. I’m fine. I’ve known you for six years now, and the only bad thing that has happened is a slight cut.”
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock, you're soaked through!" Is the first thing John says to him - ever the caring doctor -  as though it had been two days and not two weeks (entirely too long, in Sherlock's opinion) since they last spoke face to face.
"Well, now we do and we're going to be prepared for him and anyone else who comes along." John took Sherlock's hands in his own. "You need people to help you. You can't just push everyone away to protect them, you're just pushing yourself into more danger."
"I don't think so. But the doubt was enough to prevent an attempt at finding Moriarty. The Minister said that there is no point wasting resources and time on a man that leaves no evidence of existing. Not until he emerges again."
“A bit harsh to be honest. The first time was for a fairly dangerous serial killer. The second time you were in hospital because you fell in the bloody Thames.”
"No, but I was taught occumency by - by Beuxbatons." Mary said. "In terms of how to defeat it, just throw whatever you have at it. Spells, jinxes, curses. Whatever works."
Slughorn scowled, then sighed. "Fine. But my students are currently being assessed. Your students can't offer any assistance."
"Yeah. All four of them. They're lucky, though. It seems to me like it was a quick, painless death. Whoever did this, they left no potential for survival. Or witnesses." Except me, John thought to himself bitterly. He should have seen this. How could he have missed the darts flying towards them? It should have been as obvious as anything.
“Yeah, well, I can’t just stay at home in good conscience while you walk right into a trap!” John yells. Sherlock’s eyes narrow in confusion, demanding an explanation, so he continues, “Mary knows we’re here. She’d be expecting us. There’s no way she could have not been aware that someone like Joseph was taking pictures and planning on coming to us. She lured you out here. I'm no genius, but I doubt she'd lure you like this for a pleasant chat.”
"I do 'get out there'. I seem to recall that that's the whole reason we met and you're here now, is it not?" Sherlock replies curtly.
Sherlock nodded, though John could tell it was unwillingly. "My mother's family was French. We can... Converse, if we must."
"I'm saying that I'm choosing a dangerous career path and I'm going to be making a few enemies. I've already made one and because of that you got seriously hurt. I'm not willing to let that happen to you again. We'd be better off - "
With a sigh and an apologetic kiss to Rosie’s forehead, he gets out his phone and rings Mycroft. He’s got a plane to Salzburg to catch.
“Alright then. What did we watch last Thursday? The one with the archeologist and the boulder and the nazis.”
“Nonsense, I treat you with the utmost respect. Now give me another pancake. One less burned, this time.”
"Went to find Sherlock. Victor went and replaced him with some Hogwarts guy. Saw them in the corner together."
Of course, now John was in his sixth year it was all fine. He could dodge the people and see through the smoke emanating from the red train easily. What was a little heat and claustrophobia compared to the relief of being back in the wizarding world?
"Oh, wow." John raised his eyebrows in surprise, but his smile persisted. "Congratulations. I don't suppose I could join you in your celebrations?"
Molly beams and hands over her phone to Greg without a second thought. “Could you give me your number? So we can sort out the finer details. I have a lecture in a minute, so - “
“Don’t trouble yourself, dear. I’m just happy you’re back here for me to take care of.” John gives a weak smile in echo of Mrs Hudson’s as she sorts through the fridge, thankfully free of decaying body parts. The smell of frying egg and bacon (for Sherlock) and vegetarian sausage (for John) fills the flat causing John’s stomach to rumble in appreciation. Sherlock simply moans and turns his face so it’s pressed against the back of the sofa.
He steps in with a sigh, tactfully ignoring the weird smells of the street and the hopefully dead rat lying in the gutter outside. When John asks for Sherlock’s room number, or rather, William Sigerson’s, the man at the desk barely glances away from the tv screen except to look at the list of names, not even asking John why he’s there or who he is. Security is lacking, but given the circumstances, that’s probably for the best. It’s difficult to protect someone several floors away stuck in reception or kicked out onto the streets.
"I know that you lived in Norfolk until the age of 8. I know your parents were infamous death eaters and were responsible for events that occurred during The Dark Lord's take over in the 90's." Mary swallowed down her rising anger and clenched her fist. The man kept going. "You were part of it too. At a young age you were taught to use vanishing cabinets to deliver messages; you could produce a full-body patronus charm by the age of six, along with other spells that your classmates probably wouldn't be able to do if they tried. But after they died in the Battle of Hogwarts and Voldemort was killed, you were moved to live with your muggle-sympathising aunt in France. She was ashamed of you and your family's history, so she changed your name. Your identity. No one knows who you are. Except me. The best part? You miss it." The man's smirk grew, baring a few polished, sharp teeth. Mary shuddered. "You miss being cleverer than everyone. You miss the excitement of working against the law."
All he would remember is the red sparks shooting upwards from the east side of the maze, halfway between the edge of the centre, and praying that it wasn't for John and that if it was, it would just be something trivial. A broken bone, perhaps.
"Freak here isn't the only one with deduction skills. And I deduce," Donovan smirked, "You two were off in some dark corner somewhere, snogging."
"Exactly. So why would some mechanic with no sense of personal hygiene even have a chance against you?"
John can only stare, his jaw dropped and the corner of his mouth quirked up in bewilderment. He is on the verge of responding, something between ‘what the fuck, stalker’ and ‘please take me now’, when he is interrupted by Irene’s voice, barely restraining her irritation. “Act two, scene one. If you two wouldn’t mind staying quiet for one damn minute, that would be super.”
I miss you too. Please let me know when we can next meet. I'm free any time until my family and I go on holiday from 8th of July to the 17th, and even then my parents wouldn't mind me staying a little bit longer. They're very happy I have someone to stay for at all, after sixteen years of concern over my apparent loneliness. In fact, with some convincing, they may let me take you with us. But I'm rambling, thinking too far ahead. We should probably just take this one day at a time, shouldn't we.
He turns the tv off. The film's over and Sherlock is sleeping, allowing himself to rest and recover for the first time in days, so arguably, John has no reason to stay there. He does anyway, taking in the quietude and tranquillity, the sounds of London traffic outside merely white noise, until he himself is ready to drop off, his arm around Sherlock's shoulder's, his head on top of the other man's head.
Sherlock, John noticed, was copying John's actions - tilting his head, moving his jaw ever so slightly, using only the barest hint of tongue as they shared breaths (Sherlock tasted of coffee and mint toothpaste; John could only hope he didn't taste too hideous.) Soon he was kissing back expertly and independently, as though he'd been doing it for years, not minutes. John felt dizzy and held onto Sherlock tighter until Sherlock had come completely off his stool and was practically sitting in John's lap.
Sherlock dared to place his hand around John's wrist. His heart was beating, at least, but it was fast and over-exerting. John was not in control.
"Well, it was your polite charm that attracted me to you in the first place." Sherlock laughed at John's sarcasm.
Molly laughed softly. "Such a drama queen. But John told me about the drinking. I came up here to see how you were. You'll need some water, for the hangover. And some food."
When the play finished, John breathed a sigh of relief as the cheers flooded the theatre and all the actors bowed on the stage. He escaped quickly into the foyer, walking past the audience members who were still wiping away tears and the critics, who stood in a circle murmuring praise for the subtle semantic fields and subtexts and ‘quality of the prose’. But there wasn’t time for John to celebrate.
“Honestly, don’t worry about it,” a man’s voice says, breathless with urgency but still calm. The door swings open and Lydia and a man steps through - likely this mysterious unorthodox doctor they were talking about. He gives Lydia a reassuring smile underneath his surgery mask that makes his eyes crinkle. Usually, this would be downright inappropriate, given that there’s a dying man in the room, but in this case it seems reassuring, professional. “Right. Hand me the equipment there.”
John jumps slightly with a laugh at the voice, looking up with a grin, to see Sherlock smiling back, a beam that crinkles his eyes adorably.
Sherlock nodded and circled his thumb over the back of John's hand, reassuringly. "He'll pull through."
For a moment there’s just silence while Sherlock finishes bounding John’s leg. John doesn’t speak, but Sherlock can hear the cogs whirring in his brain, clicking into place. This is it, he thinks. Our last conversation together as friends will be with John with a gaping wound in his leg. Surprisingly fitting.
And the term 'boyfriend', though nice, seemed odd. In his mind, referring to John as his 'boyfriend' didn't come entirely naturally at first, as he had spent so long seeing him as his best friend and object of his (then) unrequited love.
He truly didn’t. He went through a list of people in his head to be godparents when Mary suggested a christening, and other than Harry and Sherlock, no one really mattered. Besides, Sherlock planned his wedding, encouraged him and Mary to reconcile (somewhat reluctantly, but then again, Mary did shoot him), and John saw his interactions with Archie, so Sherlock clearly at least had a respect for children. Why wouldn’t he want to be the godfather of his and Mary’s child?
"You put me on the spot! I didn't know what else to say." They both giggle at this, laughing until John's cheeks ache and they are both out of breath. When John calms down, he looks back at Sherlock, whose cheeks are flushed and eyes are bright and sparkling merrily.
His eyes dart around John’s face, as though scanning it for any sign of deceit or mockery, then he smiles and holds out his hand. “Sherlock Holmes.”
Thank you so much for all your support. Your comments, kudos, and bookmarks mean the world to me. This has been so much fun to write and I hope you've all enjoyed reading it.
Victor shrugged and John let out a huff of frustration. "I'm going to go and find him." He stormed off before the more primal side of him convinced him to punch Victor, as he deserved.
“Right. Though that’s a bit hypocritical of you, Mr Dolce and Gabbana shirt.” John nodded at the purple shirt straining across Sherlock’s chest. (John wanted to send roses to whoever designed that shirt)
We’re storing Redbeard’s old things in the loft – his bowl, his leash, his bed. Out of sight out of mind, isn’t that what they say? It hasn’t really been working so far but I’ll keep you posted. I’m not sure if it’s more or less unbearable than the idea of leaving Redbeard’s things out as they always have been.
As Sherlock had just started walking away, Janine called out, "Mary is thinking of doing double study-sessions. Me, Mary, John, you."
John looked up, only to catch a glimpse before the carriage and horses disappeared from sight. "What was that?"
Sherlock debated whether to tell Molly this or not. Of course, she already knew about him. His feelings. Apparently everyone did now. But when Janine got involved... what did he get out of being out in the open other than a drunk date and a cut on his cheek?
"Anyone in sixth year and up will be able to enter but the deadline ends on the 12th of October. On the thirteenth, the champions will be selected. Fair warning, though," Mcgonagall glared around the room, "Once you are chosen, you can not go back. Although the danger-level of the tasks have been reduced over the years, it is still dangerous. But the rewards, I'm sure you will all agree, are worth it."
"Yeah. She asked outright, so I told her. I trust her not to tell anyone until I'm ready to tell them."
Stabbed. The word repeats over and over in his head like a tune, a taunting sing-song that makes his stomach twist. God, he’s furious with him. He’s terrified. He hasn’t stopped shaking since he heard John’s cry of pain as he ran after him in the warehouse. It could have been worse, but it was merely luck that the knife didn’t find its place somewhere more dangerous, closer to a major artery or organ. He doesn’t like relying on luck for anything.
"No, indeed you can't." Sherlock turned the object over in his hand, observing it, then twisted he blunt end off like a pen lid, to reveal a sharp, metallic spike hidden underneath, dripping with poison. He raised an eyebrow at the flautist, who turned pale, then quickly turned and fled, pushing past the other players. John ran after him, pursuing up the stairs and into the empty foyer. The man didn't stop, running into the street outside, not caring about the confused stares of passers-by. Fortunately, the criminal classes were rarely so physically fit that John couldn't catch up with them. In the next alley he ran down, John tackled the man to the ground, pressing his knee into his lower back to keep him down and grabbing his wrists behind his back.
The students climbed out one by one - each wearing the same expression of discomfort and cold - until the last one, who John was somehow drawn to, in the sense that she induced a sense of de ja vu. He frowned and studied her short blonde curls, and pale complexion and her stance -
Upon further research, it turns out that Cambridge does not do Chemistry as its own subject, but rather only as part of Natural Sciences or Chemical Engineering, the former of which seems most like what Sherlock would find appealing.
“I have something to tell you. I’ve given it a great deal of thought and now seems as good a time as any to tell you this thing I’ve been considering.”
That’s not to say, however, that I don’t reciprocate every single sentiment you just expressed. Except the notion is ever be bored of you within a month, a year, or any amount of time. Everyone at Cambridge will be dull and I’ll miss you all the more for it. If I really wanted to spend all of my time with intellectuals, I wouldn’t be in a relationship with you.
John breathed out a resigned sigh. "Okay. Fine. We'll go back to the flat and you can ask away. I can't promise I'll answer all of them, though."
"Shame. Well, luckily the next round of the tournament is in two months, so hopefully our study sessions will be back on. Little bit less boredom for you, more of a chance of me surviving the tournament for me." John smiled hopefully at Sherlock. "You interested?"
Sherlock nods frantically, unwrapping his scarf from around his neck and pressing it down firmly on the wound in John's stomach, making him hiss through his teeth. The scarf is beyond repair now, immediately darkening with John's blood. "No," he protests tiredly. "'S'your scarf. You love that scarf."
A team of men in suits with guns in their hands came running into the hall, followed by Mycroft, who sighed and shook his head at the bodies, as though it was a puddle of spilt milk on the floor. "That's that, I suppose. We can handle it from here, gentlemen."
At that point John saw Hufflepuff girl stand up - coincidentally on cue - and attempt (and fail) to cover the newly-appeared large spot on her forehead. John felt a stab of sympathy for her as the Beuxbaton girls laughed cruelly at her.
John felt his cheeks burn further as he frantically smoothed down his hair. "We weren't, I swear - circumstantial evidence - Sherlock?!"
That last letter was incredibly sappy and disgustingly romantic of you. Stop it, you dramatic, sentimental idiot. It’s university, you’re not going to war. Let’s try and keep this as normal as possible, shall we? Save us the misery of over-thinking.
"Ha! Like you two were any better. Like anyone was any better! Sherlock and I want to go out. That's the whole point!"
“Oh dear. Well, be that as it may, you young people need your privacy. You can’t have a baby around all the time. Sometimes I was very thankful that my husband and I didn’t have children. Oh, the things we got up to - “
"I missed you." Sherlock said matter-of-factly. "It feels like ages since we were last alone together."
“Sadly, other than John and Sherlock, that’s what all the guys here have said. So yeah, I’m afraid no one’s safe, particularly you. Who knows? You could be Orsino.”
“How’s he doing?” One of the doctors ask, a man with dark bags under his eyes. They all do. It seems to be as integrated into their uniform as the gloves and hat and blue tunic. The fact that he’s a father of two young toddlers doesn’t help, Sherlock observes.
John grinned, "Oh? You're deducing me so soon into the journey?" The train had only just left the station.
Don't stress about exams. You're moderately intelligent I'm sure you'll do fine. And don't send me a picture of you stressing. My sadistic tendencies don't extend to people I like.
"Now get some rest, Mister Watson. It will lunchtime soon and I'm sure your friends would want to visit you. You need all the strength you can get. You've been very popular the last couple of days I've been here."
(A far more selfish and irrational part of him simply did not want to witness the reunion, to see John's wrath evaporate at the sight of his wife, the mother of his child, as Sherlock's role in his life is quickly displaced. Nevermind John's self-proclaimed wish to stay at Baker Street. Sentiment usually wins over. That's what Sherlock told himself.)
"General briefing. The first round is November 14th. We'll be given uniforms for it." John frowned slightly as they walked to the Gryffindor common room. "Tomorrow at 10 a journalist from the Daily Prophet is coming to interview us."
When Sherlock reminds her that she could get arrested for his murder - a shocking revelation, apparently - she simply tilts her head in agreement, tosses a coin, and shoots a bullet directly through it. There is nothing of her left that could be recognisable - her voice is like steel, her eyes cold and grey as frost, as unpredictable as a storm.
"No. Everything I said before is still true. I'm deeply infatuated with you, you are with me. And right now, I'm literally sat on your lap, and making no effort to move. I imagine if I think about things a lot later I may start to feel regret about what might have been and how much could have been prevented, but right now the only spite I'm feeling is how you got to experience our first time before I did." John grinned with relief, while Sherlock smiled back, uncharacteristically shyly. "So, want to try it again?"
He didn't allow himself the luxury of crying. Instead he breathed slowly in and out and kept his eyes opened and blinking furiously, while he prayed silently to Merlin, to God, to anyone for all he cared, for a convenient meteor to come crashing down and kill everyone in this stupid cruel castle.
Harry: Also because, as Irene and I interpret it, as reluctant as he is to leave Antonio, he also can’t stay with him. He’s an outsider in a dangerous place. Not to mention queer.
medical professional - I can assure you that the experiment is completely unnecessary. The number of espressos you've drunk this evening is disturbing, and lots of recent tests have been done. You don't need to ruin your own sleep schedule to prove that the effects of this are...a bit not good, to say the least."
"He's with me," he replies firmly, ignoring the detective inspector as he looks around the flat, inspecting it with sharp, focused eyes.
John sighs. "That's when he goes back home. Never mind. Thank you, miss." In a vain attempt to gain her sympathies one last time, he takes Sherlock's hand in his as they walk out of the ticket office and cross the road.
"I'm not sure if you're even allowed in here." John said to Sherlock, as Mary went to comfort Janine.
The murder took place at the victim's flat in the suburbs. Between the nice houses and the nearby park perfect for families, John would say that it was a perfectly lovely spot to live in, if it weren't for the police cars, the yellow tape, and the immediate stifling sense that someone died here. Sherlock holds up the tape for John to duck under and they enter the flat, which is full of forensics and detectives in matching blue health and safety suits. A silver-haired detective approaches them and nods at John while addressing Sherlock. 'Who's this?"
Sherlock complied and crossed his legs as he sat up. John sat down in front of him and took out the antibacterial wipes from his kit. "This may sting a little." He said, as he applied the wipes to Sherlock's cut. The boy barely winced. Maybe it was a high tolerance to pain. Maybe the alcohol had numbed his nerves.
John shakes his head. He doesn't need to think about it. Sherlock's life is priceless. More than thirty million or sixty million or any other price. "No. Not in exchange for her godfather's life."
He was just about to enter the bathroom, when he heard someone – female – running up the stairs. He sighed, then returned to the living room then opened the door, to be greeted by – as he predicted – Stella Hopkins, the muggle detective inspector of Scotland Yard, perspiring slightly and breathing heavily (asthma), her black tied back air frizzing and sticking out at the top of her head.
"He came out of surgery at 11," Madam Pomfrey said as she came into the room. Sherlock pulled his eyes away from John to acknowledge her. "He pulled through, recovered well. But it will scar. There wasn't anything we could do."
"Mrs Hudson." Behind her, Sherlock appeared, looking slightly less exhausted than last night, apparently having listened to John's advice, and mildly embarrassed. "This is John Watson. He is not here about the flat. He's just here as my..."
It isn't long before the distance between them shrinks, inching closer and closer, until John's arm has slipped from the back of the sofa to Sherlock's shoulders (later, he will blame it on the slipperiness of the leather), and Sherlock's head is resting on John's shoulders, his curls tickling his cheek (exhaustion and still in recovery is John's excuse for Sherlock's casual physical affection.) Sherlock's breaths become steady, slowing and slowing, until John is certain that his plan worked and Sherlock is finally asleep.
The grief was another thing that was new and could never go away, the heavy, stifling mourning that suffocated the castle, but especially the few in particular who knew Mycroft well, who were close enough to John and Sherlock to be terrified by what happened.
"I'm sorry for the way we treated you," Mrs Watson speaks, getting it out quickly, as though embarrassed.
"It's not the fucking middle ages anymore! We hardly need to be encouraging increasing the population at this point."
"So what else have you used it for?" Sometimes, Sherlock reminded John of a child at Christmas, eager and bright-eyed and constantly asking questions.
At that moment, the heads of houses handed out the lesson schedules for the year. John had barely glanced over his schedule before groaning.
“I see.” Sherlock opens the album. The first few pages are all newspaper clippings of their cases together, with words like ‘anonymous informant’ and ‘help from a nameless source’ circled, from back when Sherlock was hidden from the public eye. The cases soon become more frequent and high end, as Sherlock turns from a faceless help behind the scenes of Scotland Yard to ‘Hat Man’ and ‘Boffin’ and ‘Private Detective’. The picture of the two of them in the hat are in there, as well as the sneaky paparazzi photos John used to pretend to be upset about: them walking together after a case has been solved: Sherlock passing a piece of evidence to him with the camera angled just so so they looked like they were holding hands; them laughing at a private joke as they sat outside at a cafe. Their most private and intimate moments have been captured on camera, published for the world to see, and honestly, John can’t say that he minds. Sherlock doesn't seem too bothered either, but instead peruses the photos with a small smile as he lets nostalgia wash over him.
John transfers her into Sherlock’s arms, and he instantly calms. He’s known her all of five minutes and already he loves her with every fibre of his being as though she were his own, radiating through him almost visibly. Even the baby seems to be comfortable in Sherlock’s presence, gazing up at him curiously with bright blue eyes.
Then John was gone from sight, and Mcgonagall dismissed everyone to their dorm rooms. So Sherlock, instead of going to his dorm, waited outside the chambers for John to leave.
"Okay, then." John doesn't pry further, though god he wants to. John hasn't been up for dating since he got back from Afghanistan, but at least he has the excuse of a cane, PTSD, and a night shift interfering with his personal life (though he knows many invalided soldiers who had a steady love life after getting injured. He supposes it requires patience and a confidence he no longer had.) Sherlock, on the other hand, did not have these disadvantages. He was free and self-employed, beautiful and intelligent, "What about a flatshare?"
"I know you're not, though. And it's true. You never met Redbeard. The whole thing would be incredibly awkward for you. Besides, I think if we do meet - "
I've decided to split what was going to be a super long chapter in two. Chapter 4 should hopefully be up soon!
He stood up on unsteady feet and held his wand out in front of him. The Occamy was starting to fly back to his best, but John hit it with a stinging jinx. It fell to the ground, but got back onto its feet. John watched as it attempted to take off again, only one wing was injured, so as soon as it took off into the air, it fell down after a couple of seconds. It growled in anger. It kept trying, and failing, and growling, then trying again, but each time the Occamy stayed firmly on the ground. John couldn't tell whether this was an improvement or not.
Moriarty's smile was slow moving, like a panther prowling as it creeps up on its prey. "It's a big wide world out there. Bigger than you're aware of. Full of locks and bolts that even your ministry doesn't have the key to."
John giggles. "One kiss and you already want to me to move in? You have to buy me dinner first," he teases, a flirtatious infliction on his voice that makes Sherlock grin with relief.
“Yes, I am, what is it?” John pressed his lips together, deciding to power through and ignore the man’s temper.
The two stared at each other for longer than Sherlock would have liked. He cleared his throat. "Mary. You're - your English is good."
John grins as Sherlock enters the room and climbs into John's bed, and then John follows after. The bed is narrower than Sherlock's, but they don't particularly mind when they curl up into each other, legs tangled and arms resting on the other boy's stomach.
"Piss off," John rolls his eyes, but smiles at Sherlock when he sees the excited, wide-eyed look on his face. "So. Tell me about the play, then."
"It's just dancing, not a group science experiment. But you're right. So, I'll be the one leading, then?"
"Exactly. No one will want to go to some eighteen year old Hogwarts graduate no one has ever really heard of. You'd need to make a name for yourself. By taking any case that people come to you with."
"Evening." John! The voice was monotone, devoid of emotion, of any sign of the smart, funny compassionate boy Sherlock knew and loved, except in the recognisable timbre of his voice. He wasn't sure whether to breathe a sigh of relief or to carry on panicking. Sherlock turned around to the direction of the voice. Sure enough, out of the shadows, John walked slowly and shakily out, meters away from where Sherlock was standing. He came to a standstill, swaying as he stood, his face blank and unreadable. Even his eyes - the usually traitorous, emotional blue eyes that from a distance seemed so dark - held no clue as to why the hell was John out of bed.
She blew the whistle and he took a deep breath, before entering through the maze. He didn't stop to look back at the narrowing entrance. He couldn't afford to waste precious time.
John sat there staring at Sherlock for a second, before he leant over to kiss him. Properly. Sherlock, though he went rigid at first in surprise, soon relaxed and arm travelled to John's shoulders, pulling him closer. John's hands in response rested, one  at Sherlock's waist, the other in Sherlock's hair, the way he had imagined for the last year or so.
"So Moran had you released from the Imperius upon Moriarty's orders, and you collapsed and fell back into your coma. Moriarty talked some more. He said he is working his way up...something. A criminal hierarchy. He's going to be a master criminal, take over."
The other god huffs out an incredulous laugh, scratching the back of his neck. “Wow. Been a while since I’ve seen another one like me. I’m John.” He takes a glove off of his hand and puts it out front of him. Sherlock frowns. What the hell is he supposed to do with this? John smiles patiently. “Shake it. It’s a human custom when you meet a new person. I’ve sort of grown used to it now”
"I don't need paying. I honestly had fun here. I don't get a lot of company other than my therapist and customers - and now you, I suppose. Which sounds very sad now that I think about it," John half-chuckles.
Sherlock crouches down next to John. "Look," he says, pointing at Lila Madison's hand, underneath the stump where her little finger used to be. "See that black mark there? I thought that was ink at first. But it's sort of like a cursive line, so it's intentional. I think it's more like a tattoo, or what's left of it."
This of course is the expected result, but isn’t always the reality. In fact, a mere 70% of matches are considered successful in this sense. Divorce, infidelity, incompatibility are more common than people like to admit. A significant number of murders are committed by unsuccessful matches who would rather kill their partners than go through divorce and face the public shame of being unsuccessful, which is why I find this whole practice rather ridiculous. I believe a large number of lives could be saved if there was less public expectation of falling in love with your soulmate. In fact, if people didn’t have soulmates at all and were free to date, or not date, whoever they wanted, that would be preferable.
"Later, the wedding guests search for him in the forest. James' best friend proposes to Effie, urged on by the witch, and she accepts. The witch later meets James and gives him a scarf that she promises will - oh look, it's starting!"
“Well, for the record, I do rather like Katherine. But I suppose my opinion isn’t quite as important.”
The maze was lit up well enough that he could see about ten feet in front of him, but there was fog ominously circling his feet and blocking his vision beyond a particular point. He got his wand out as he walked, first muttering "lumos", then saying "point me," the spell Molly had taught him to allow him to find his way around the maze. The wand spun around in his palm before pointing north, to his right. This meant, if he was correct, he would have to head left in order to get to the centre of the maze.
"No. You've always solved it. You like the puzzle. I think if I went back and held your hand through everything you'd just end up hating me."
My family also can't seem to comprehend the idea that after three weeks of correspondence we're not romantically involved. They're incredibly conservative and draining to hang around. I can't wait two years to leave them for uni. Maybe if I could convince my school to let me do my a-levels early... No, they'd already refused to let me do my GCSEs early. But then again, that was on account of me nearly blowing up a chemistry lab a couple of weeks earlier. Apparently a slight miscalculation in a simple experiment is that worthy of punishment. Odd. But it's now been two years since any chemical accident at school, so maybe they will agree.
Secondly, Saturday the 18th sounds fine. It's true, I'm not doing much to celebrate, other than a family dinner. I suppose you're right about how being sober and watching drunk people can be entertaining - I find that their true characters are more often revealed through alcohol. For example, it was very interesting when after a couple of glasses of sherry at the local fair, the 'happily' married vicar started to flirt - unsuccessfully - with Michael Morton, a widower. And my normally reserved mother usually starts dancing. That one is more embarrassing than anything to watch. Although I have to say, I would have thought you'd be one of the people drinking, being the popular, sociable rugby captain. Not to reinforce stereotypes or anything. Oh, I see. Your father. I suppose he would be enough to put you off drinking for a good long while, considering how he lost his job, ruined his marriage, etc, etc, due to drunk. Do you think you'll ever drink?
Sherlock makes a show of considering it, pursing his lips as he tilted his head, then smiles back. "I would be delighted."
"Alright, alright!" Greg held his hands up in defence. "I'm sorry I made a comment which expressed an opinion. It didn't mean anything, Mycroft, and Molly: you don't have to turn everything everyone says into a feminist thing!"
Sherlock smiles up at John bashfully. "I just knew from experience that siblings and parents tend to do those things."
"I have this little plan of mine. Not like Voldemort or anything - he was quite amateurish with his schemes, in my opinion. Couldn't even kill a one year old. But I digress. In order for me to complete my overall plan, I need supporters. Employees, if you will. And a girl of your skill set and background would be very valuable to me. And with a little bit of training - "
Sherlock nodded in response, then walked away, to where John could only assume he was going backstage. John joined the flood of audience members and went to take his seat, towards the back, giving him a good view of everyone around him. In front of the stage, the orchestra sat in the pit, obscured from sight. He took the opportunity to look around, see if he could see anyone shifting in their seats, discreetly wiping the sweat off their brow, bearing a steely-eyed expression as they played the waiting game of when the best time to strike was. Unfortunately, John could see no one, except chatting couples and groups of friends and single Shakespeare fanatics.
The next second is a blur that John will struggle to remember correctly later, as he recounts the events to doctors, to Salzburg police, then to Scotland Yard.
"'Only'" John forced out a laugh. "Honestly, I just want to forget all about everything. Just relax. Want a butterbeer at Hogsmeade?"
Checking John's pulse had become all too familiar to him by this point, as had the relief at the steady thrum of life pumping slowly through John's wrist. He was comatose still, now that he no longer had any curses holding him up and opening his eyes.
Harry made a frustrated noise at the back of her throat. “Fine. You want to gossip? Want to see how badly my life is falling apart just because yours has...hit the fan? My writing is a joke. I’m a fraud. I’m drinking most evenings. Clara and I barely speak to each other. We rarely even sleep in the same bed. Happy now?”
"I could talk to him. Not that he'd talk back, but he seemed to understand me. If I was ill or upset when I was younger he used to come up onto my bed and sleep there with me. He was my own live teddy bear. That drools and sheds fur. God, I take back every time I complained - if I had known - "
“Oh, how romantic, a crowded pub full of drunks celebrating the end of quarantine all at the same time. This is why I suggested the hotel room.”
I’m not particularly good at deducing things from a person’s writing yet, a fact my elder brother Mycroft is endlessly smug about. His intelligence is, I have to admit, above mine, and he seems to think that gives him a right to act like an annoying third parent. All I can tell so far is that your father was away for the majority of your childhood on business and during his absence your parents grew apart. Or maybe his behaviour changed. Perhaps he became a drinker. I can also tell that you’re reasonably intelligent, have a decent sense of humour, and you’ve probably had several girlfriends, and maybe a boyfriend, in your adolescence. Nothing long term, as I suppose you’re too dedicated to your studies and your parents’ example may have put you off commitment.
"Sherlock, we should go now." John hugged his arms close to his chest for warmth. "Try again tomorrow."
"Mmh. Good call. Bastards, the lot of them." Mr Watson nods approvingly. (Dinner is already going swimmingly, in John's opinion.)
"You're going to make a lot of enemies one day." Sherlock gave a small grin. "I'll plan your funeral. In the meantime, read Fantastic Beasts. The one at the top."
Punch, blow, kick. Wash, rinse, repeat. He’s becoming quite tired of the whole routine now, and not just with this one man, the Russian drug smuggler and key asset of Moriarty currently beating him up, but with everyone he’s encountered: the American crime syndicate leaders, the human traffickers in New Zealand, the blackmailers in Beijing - one by one, Sherlock found all of them, and they immediately responded with beatings and torture.
"It will take some getting used to, though. I've brought you up with a certain idea of what your future would be like, and it was heartbreaking when I found out it would be different."
And so they became integral to each others' routines, orbiting around each other in easy companionship around the flat, before dashing off to chase criminals down the streets of London, returning with their veins buzzing with adrenaline, eyes wide and bright, hearts beating wildly in their chests while their breaths come out in heavy pants. It satisfied Sherlock's constant need for mental stimulation, and John's addiction to danger. It also meant that John got to witness Sherlock's work first hand, his deductions having improved over time until they came out in a torrent, weaving a picture of a crime taking place, fixing John to his spot and leaving him unable to do anything except exclaim compliments. (John also came to discover that this time, Sherlock was always, without fail, surprised to hear someone appreciating his deductions, his confidence lost over seven years to the abuse heard from Scotland Yard's officers and judgemental clients. Perhaps Victor had had a hand in it too... This was best not to dwell on.)
At most, people normally stay for one, maybe two hours, before getting tired and leaving. But the man continues to remain there until the sky lights up with the first trace of dawn, obscured by grey clouds so that it's not so much the beautiful, orange and golden and rosy sunset John is used to, but the London kind, where the time of day is measured by how grey the sky is. John doesn't pay attention, but only to the man sat at the table in front of the counter, who writes in his notebook every so often - John later figures out that it's on the hour - then switches between looking through the case files and only gets up to ask for refills.
"Christ, no, you think I'm the one doing all the dirty work? All that blood?" The man grimaced. "No. I work...behind the scenes. The director of the play. The author of the novel. Back in the shadows where my Westwood shoes can stay clean and stainless."
So John kisses him. It’s soft and tender, surprisingly so, considering how pumped full of adrenaline they both were a few minutes ago, but it leaves Sherlock’s heart racing beneath his chest. It’s uncertain and tentative on both ends, but growing more assured by the second that this is right, and this is how it’s meant to be. Just the two of them against the rest of the world.
“I tried to sit down and write the final paragraph of my essay and I ended up staring into space for a good five minutes thinking about cuddling you.”
“What’s done is done, John. All we can do now is wait to see what turns up.” Sherlock’s phone beeps with a text and he sighs at the screen. “Mycroft. My presence is requested at the Diogenes club, apparently. Most likely about Mary.”
If there's one thing John Watson could never  get used to, it's how crowded platform nine and three quarters always was. He had been told that there were approximately only three thousand wizards in Britain (which, for a country with a population of forty million, is relatively little) and it felt like they all gathered on this little platform every year on September 1st. For someone who generally preferred smaller crowds, this was always distressing. His chest felt a little tighter, the heat became a little more noticeable, the air felt thin and empty. The worst was in John's first year; scared, alone with no one except his pet owl (his parents and older sister were on the other side of the wall) and hundreds of people constantly bumping into his trolley. Even when he was on the train the eleven year old could feel the heavy stare of other kids over his old scuffed trainers and second-hand jeans and the jumper his mum knitted when he was nine. Eventually, he found a friend. A tall boy with dark curly hair and an ability to know his entire life story through one glance settled the boy's nerves. He didn't feel quite so lost afterwards.
"Sorry. But, in all seriousness, when did you learn to do a patronus?" John crossed his legs to make room for Sherlock as he came to sit next to him.
After that exam though, there was rarely time for them to be alone. For three weeks they switched constantly between lessons, studying, exams, with breaks only for meals or walking around the grounds for fresh air, to the point that John's excitement and touch-cravings had died down so that all was left was pure exhaustion. This was until the last examination: potions practical. The class, Professor Slughorn had told them five weeks before hand, had to make Amortentia on their own, rather in pairs as they had normally practiced. John walked into this exam with more nerves than usual, his stomach tucking and turning in its cage. Because, as his head of year had reminded him last year in one-to-one career discussions last year, potions was the most important subject a healer can be knowledgable in, and this was the one topic that the senior staff at St Percival's Healer School would pay attention to the most. He gave one last nervous and forlorn look at Sherlock as he made his way over to the other side of the classroom. Sherlock returned it with a small smile and a nod, telling him that he had faith in him, that he'd do fine. John forced a smile back, though his hand still shook obstinately.
"Of course. Though there have been some protests at keeping them locked away in safety, it has been promised to us that he will talk to his family and make them stay. Explain it's for their own good."
"Doesn't matter. You can't just use a dead woman's phone. Besides, Lestrade would have a fit if he knew you had stolen that from the crime scene."
Sherlock wondered, not for the first time, what would happen if these rules were broken, if the boundaries were surpassed, if they became... more.
Madam Maxime laughed, a high pitched "ha!" which John swore made the lake ripple slightly. "Indeed. Are ze Durmstrags 'ere?"
"No guarantees, though. I'm starting to think this whole thing you're doing is part of some social experiment."
Regarding Soulmates day, I've never found anything particularly special about it. To me, Soulmates Day just means getting the house to myself as my parents go on a weekend trip away - to Paris or Rome or Brussels, for example - , as long as I don't use the oven or try any potentially dangerous experiments. I'm aware for others it's a special celebration of their love/friendship/the concept of soulmates in general, but I don't really see a need to be so public about it. However, as this is a tradition for you, as eating nothing but sandwiches for meals for an entire weekend is for me, I will go to your soulmate party. It will be as good an opportunity as any to meet your friends, and maybe even try again with your parents.
They rushed down the stairs, putting on their coats, and exited the building onto the busy London road. Sherlock instantly called up a taxi and they hopped in. The taxi drove on.
Sherlock's face was a blank, unreadable. Like he didn't know how he was supposed to respond. John went on, "I wanted to meet you again, you know. I tried. I went back to the same bar a couple of times. And I also started a new jogging route - right near where you were living. It was stupid, I know, but I was hoping we'd - bump into each other, maybe? A kind of meet-cute. It got out of hand, to the point where when we did meet, you assumed I was spying on you for your brother, threatened me, so I undid it to make sure I wouldn't get arrested for stalking."
"Woodwind player in the orchestra. Would be able to hide the darts within the case or the instrument. At the right angle and with a particularly strong blow, a hidden dart would come out and hit Yanovich and his family, piercing the skin with poison. Yes. that's it." Sherlock burst out of his room, determinedly walking past John towards the door. "I have to get back to the theatre. There will be an interval soon, and If I get back before then we can - "
When he comes back to the coffee shop later, now refuelled with food and with a gun stuffed down the back of his trousers, hidden by the loose wool jumper that Sherlock scoffs at whenever he sees John wearing it, the shop is empty, except for Sherlock, who is sat at the table, his legs crossed as he casually sips at his coffee. It's a welcoming sight that makes John smile. He sits opposite him, as he did when they first met.
Sherlock slammed open the door to 221b and immediately stormed towards his room. John followed behind frustratedly. "Sherlock, wait - "
“Relax, I gave you my phone number shortly before you fell asleep. It’s not like we won’t see each other again, or it was just a one night stand.”
“I know.” John chuckles. “I’ve seen you in some of my lectures. John Watson.” He clasps Sherlock’s hand with his, watching with intrigue as his smaller hand becomes enveloped in Sherlock’s far larger hand. They discreetly shake hands, trying to avoid Irene’s glare.
“Alright, just checking. Don’t mind me, just being a considerate boyfriend. Speaking of which, I haven’t really thanked you enough.”
“Understandable, but some sections are rather interesting. For example, in the nineteenth century, before the government acknowledged that two men could be soulmates, men who couldn’t gain access to the black market of unused or illegal journals would acknowledge each other to be soulmates through other means.”
He didn't bother finding Mary. Perhaps out of guilt. Instead, he headed straight to his dorm, took off his robes and fell into a dreamless sleep.
They unpack the boxes upstairs in John’s room, giving Rosie a toy to play with and/or drool over as she lies next to them, and put things in their rightful place. Slowly, the room becomes itself again, as it was three or four years ago. Except now it has a cot in the corner next to the bed, and tiny onesies of white and pink and blue take space in his drawers as well as his own clothes. He wouldn’t change it back for the world.
But John stayed. And, in a bizarre turn of events, he kissed him. Or maybe Sherlock did, as a plea to make him stay, or simply because the temptation was too much to bare. It was glorious and terrifying and definitely nothing like what Sherlock would have wanted a first
“Hey!” Molly runs to catch up with Greg’s longer strides as they leave the building. She never usually does this (neither the running nor the actively seeking conversation with a guy) but for some reason she felt emboldened. Perhaps the topsy-turvy world of Illyria was escaping its pages. (She rolls her eyes in her head at her own romanticism. Calm down, Molly) “Greg Lestrade, right? Congratulations on getting Orsino! That’s a great role to get.”
“Then you told me you loved me.” Sherlock’s face instantly drains of blood. John offers a smile, teasing and self-deprecating, to console him. “While I was dying in your arms. Pretty damn romantic, Sherlock Holmes.”
The heartbroken people are the second most common faction of the people John finds in the coffee shop; the ones kicked out of the flat in the middle of the night, or avoiding their girlfriends as they contemplate whether to break up with them while they drink their latte (or a Whole Latte Love, as the drink is ironically named). The women crying into their phones as they pick at a chocolate muffin, conflicted and upset and with stories gradually less interesting to eavesdrop on as the evening wears on. It gets tiresome listening to sobbing for hours on end, and it gets to a point where John couldn't help but glance at the clock, silently begging it to go faster so he can go back to the flat and sleep for a little while.
John shook his head. "Nothing can be done, Sherlock. I'm alive, I suppose." John forced a small smile, an attempt at comfort. "You solved it though. That should help, right?"
“I know. And chemistry exams would be impossible to do online, seeing as at least two of the questions involve drawing a diagram and then submitting it as a pdf online on a system that’s temperamental on the best of days, let alone when all 200 students taking that exam have to submit it within the same twenty-four hours. Not to mention the other subjects.”
"Oh,it's dull. Mother gave it to me. She says as a half-blood I have a responsibility to choose between the muggle world and the wizarding world." The boy put the book down with an air of disgust, "Can't see why I can't have both. But only the good bits."
Mary smiles, tilting her head condescendingly. "I'll make it simple, then. The broadcast that brought you from exile? That was a fake to get my attention and to bring you back from exile at the same time The photographs sent to Sherlock's door? That was me. And a couple of very talented acquaintances for the photography. I've been planning it for ages, trying to find a way of escaping without causing suspicion, then bringing you right to my front door, so to speak. Now, I have what I want."
“Maybe they should just make it a normal muggle one.” John had replied. “With hula hoops and egg and spoon races and crawling under parachutes. Like in primary school.”
John sat back down on the bed with a sigh. “So that’s it then? You give up, send me on my way to civilian life armed with a cane and dismiss me as an invalid?”
"Shut up. I'm not lonely," he says, as he downs some of his beer. "We'll be speaking on the phone later."
The hours crept pitifully slowly throughout the day. Sherlock was forced to attend lessons, with lips pressed together and meaningless apologies as teachers stopped Sherlock in his tracks from escaping to the infirmary. Or his dorm. Whichever could offer him comfort.
On the day he moves in, John and Sherlock carry up boxes from the delivery van up to 221b. Thankfully, there are only a couple so the trips up and down the stairs are kept to a minimum: John’s clothes, Rosie’s things, including her cot and clothes and toys, and a few essentials he knows Sherlock never remembers to buy, like bleach and kitchen towel.
Janine entered on the second whistle, her right hand clenched into a fist and shaking. She turned back and looked apprehensively at the audience, then turned to John. He nodded and gave a small, encouraging smile before the entrance closed off, leaving John alone in front of his entrance.
John came out of his and Sherlock’s bedroom two minutes and 30 seconds later, dressed in a muggle plaid shirt and jeans, his hair damp and sticking up in all sorts of angles. Not that he or John would ever choose traditional wizard robes, even for ministry cases. But at wizard trials they forced themselves to dress in formal wizard attire.
Sherlock scoffs. "All three of them, all reclusive and have probably never left London in their lives? I doubt it."
"I thought that was established years ago. I'm a person of habit, John, and you've been a part of my work since first year." Sherlock frowned in confusion. "What else would happen?"
John jumps at the deep voice rumbling in his ear, his heart beating double time. Okay. He’s talking to me. Just talk back and make normal conversation. Like you haven’t been semi-stalking him for the last four months. “Actually, rugby season has ended now that the weather is turning warm- hold on.” John frowns. “How do you know I’m rugby captain?”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock pulled away from John, “but since the last tournament in 1994 no one has really trusted it in Hogwarts’ hands. And frankly, neither do I.”
"I know, Sherlock. I know. But we have to move the bodies." John entered the balcony, crouching so he was out of the view of the audience, and bringing out with him Yanovich first. Sherlock was on his phone, texting Mycroft, before going in and getting the other bodies, laying them on the floor beside Yanovich. Sherlock's face was unreadable, stoic, his eyes as calculating as always, though John could see that his hands were shaking.
As long as the thought of their imminent separation was kept at bay, the world was at peace and Sherlock's mind knew nothing but bliss.
"Honestly, I don't understand why you still live here. This place is hateful." Sherlock complains petulantly. "I'm bored simply looking at the colour scheme -
"Fine. I needed you to help me. You have the intelligence and foresight. I just sort of... keep going back, guns blazing, and hope for the best."
"It's hard to tell. My inhibitions were lowered. My memory of it is a little fuzzy. But I'm pretty sure I did." Sherlock felt his eyes burn slightly. Damn the alcohol still in his system.
He says he wants to join the army. As a medic, rather than on the front lines. He’s mad, of course, and I told him that, but he went on about how it’s about doing your part and saving people’s lives, and also that his girlfriend loves men in uniform. More convincing than my Dad ever was on the subject, and he’s spouted every single argument possible at me to get me to join. Before now, I only saw it as a straight path to becoming my Dad - traumatised and angry and drinking to cope. But not everyone does become that, do they?
“So things escalated. Again. We yelled at each other. Again. I stormed out, went to Liam’s house, and he offers for me to stay, so I can keep out of my parents’ way for a while. So yeah, here I am.”
"Oh, shit." John wipes his face quickly and takes a steadying breath, not out of embarrassment, but he is slightly self-conscious of the fact this is the first time he has cried in Sherlock's presence. "I'll just pop out for a bit. Need to rehydrate, probably. Are you alright holding her until I come back in or Mary wakes up?"
John pauses in thought then nods. "Fine. Let's do this." He picks up the scalpel in one hand, then grins at Sherlock. "You're going down, Holmes."
“Also, try to avoid your herbal soothers. If your hip is causing you trouble, ring us and we’ll pick up some painkillers from the clinic and come home - “
"And the way to stay 'balanced' so to speak, was to bring me to a party? In a public situation? With all your friends? When I am most likely to insult or accidentally offend someone?"
"Yes, I am trying, but I don't actually understand rugby. Well, whenever you are successful at whatever it is you do in that sport, your parents pay you. You're saving up for driving lessons, so soon you will be able to drive up to Cardiff and visit your soulmate whenever you like.
Two weeks later, Harry turned up on John’s doorstep, soaked through with the rain and explaining in a strained voice that she had left Clara for good, that they were both better off without each other. She stayed on his sofa while she looked for a place to live, then left her phone as a parting gift, on the table where he couldn’t refuse it.
It wasn't of course. For one, people stared at John and Sherlock more frequently now as they walked down the corridors, hand in hand together; that's the boy who got stabbed, that's the boy whose brother died, they're the cute couple who nearly got killed. It set John on edge, especially when the whispering started, and his jaw ached from grinding and gritting his teeth so often. Sherlock ignored it, knowing full well this would be their reputation for a while. He kept his gaze fixed straight ahead of him and squeezed John's hand for comfort. Merlin knows that's what they both needed.
Though I appreciate the thought, I'd rather you didn't get arrested for punching all my classmates and teachers and extended family in succession.
Lestrade gives a long-suffering sigh. "Fine. I don't know why I bloody put up with this. Put on a suit and go in."
She was suddenly silent. Pacing the stage in an attempt to seem like she was in control of the situation for far longer than John could remember in the rehearsals. Quickly grabbing a bit of cardboard next to him and the pen from an earlier scene, he scribbled down a few keywords he remembered her saying in her speech: butterfly, bend, sprinkle, tomato, easy, river. He didn’t even know what the speech was actually about, but somehow it encouraged Cassandra, as she launched into her own monologue.
Kiara smiled condescendingly. "Whatever I ask you, Mister... Moran. But if you're nervous, I could start with someone else. How about you, Miss Hawkins?"
Sherlock leaves soon after and the flat falls silent except for Rosie’s quiet babbling. John distractedly plays with her, making her smile and giggle, but even that doesn’t soothe the sharp, pressing discomfort in his gut that something isn’t quite right.
"Okay. That's good. If you want to talk again, don't hesitate. Tell me when you find Redbeard, yeah?"
"Can I get the - ugh," he grimaces, now noticing the names of the drinks on the board. John can't blame his reaction, but he chuckles anyway in the sadistic way most people do at the knowledge that someone else hates a bad joke. "The espresso, please."
"Well, in case you didn't notice, we can't exactly sit in the audience," Sherlock whispers back, "Thanks to your poor planning."
Sherlock laughed, and kissed him. “Completely unnecessary. You could wear your most horrific corduroy trousers and ugly knitted jumper, and it would still ‘do it for me.’ Even without the eight-month absence. That being said -” he smirked, his forehead pressed to John’s, as his hand traced a path down John’s spine, to the waistband of his pants, the fingers dipping underneath them just enough to make his intentions clear. “ - You do look very fetching in red.” John’s eyes darkened. “So, do you think you’re awake enough now?”
With that, Sherlock took only a few strides towards him then grabbed John’s arm, twisting it behind his back as he pressed him against the brick walls of the apartment building. John cried out in shock and pain (though he had hoped at one point to be pinned up against a wall, he didn't think it would be with the added risk of a sprained arm.) “Then who are you working for?” Sherlock growled. “I doubt anyone else would be so intent on watching my every move.”
Write back soon. And maybe tell me a bit about yourself? There must be more to you than depressing statistics, murders and science.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned so his back was facing Mycroft, while John suppressed a snigger at the sight. Mycroft then turned to John, obviously only reminded of his existence by the sound of the stifled chuckle. "John, do convince you, won't you? You've seen enough of the battlefield to know the damaging effects of war." At this, John's eyes hardened into a glare, but Mycroft continued nonetheless, "And believe me when I say that I do not exaggerate - the failure to solve this case will lead to war. And I would so hate seeing you enlisted -"
"Good luck, John." Mary hugged John quickly, and kissed his cheek, before leaving the tent. Sherlock turned to leave too, before John caught him by the arm and turned him around.
John ignores the flattering connotation that Sherlock has his shifts memorised, and replies, "I'm really sorry, but the manager just texted. I'll take another cab back to the coffee shop."
“You’re two thousand years too late. Besides, I’m far too busy for guests. People are dying by the millions, these days. Honestly, is there no one in charge of population control?”
“Oh. Okay.” He takes a deep breath, only a slight shakiness betraying his nervousness at being confronted by this new part - John can’t blame him, he would be as well - and he begins. “Right. Uh.
Sorry this took so long to update. There were exams, then other stuff too, causing serious writers block. And general losing enthusiasm for this fanfiction. That happened.
"Now now, boys, let's not start the rivalry before the tournament even begins." Kiara walked back in with Janine. "Mister Watson, it's your turn."
Harry: By the time Sebastian and Antonio reunite again, several misunderstandings have occurred, so that by the end Antonio is arrested and alone, Sebastian has reunited with his sister, who will marry the count, and is married to Olivia.
“I’d like to see you try it one day. See if you can travel via fireplace without breaking something.” John knelt down to kiss Sherlock anyway, as was routine whenever he came back from work. Sherlock leaned up to receive it compliantly. “Get anything done today?” John asked, stroking Sherlock’s  hair. The contented hums and purrs Sherlock would make from this action irresistibly reminded John of a cat, as he endlessly teased.
"Yes, that's because you like watching me deduce you. Really, John, I'd have thought you'd be bored of it by now."
John offers a weak smile. "Thanks. Oh, and I'm sorry for telling you to shut up. That was uncalled for."
Thank you for calling the other day. enjoyed talking to you and I look forward to talking more at some point. However, with exams less than a month away I find it increasingly difficult to find time to write to you, let alone come up with something to say. Very little is happening in my life right now, other than constant reminders from parents and teachers to revise, which I doubt you want to know about. I feel like I'm drowning in flash cards and past papers and highlighters. My parents insist on flinging these things at me no matter how many times I tell them that they're not needed, that it's all in my head already and it doesn't matter anyway as I'm deleting all of it as soon as I can.
It's the first time John has had a shift that is remotely busy, or with another person. The other barista is young, a film student at uni who doesn't stop talking about the awfulness of modern cinema and the genius of Hitchcock, and how having these opinions makes him superior to everyone else. He makes John feel old and miserable and exhausted within the first hour of his shift.
"Dragon, Kappa and Occamy." Mary cut in. "In terms of how to beat them: get the kappa to bow, so the water will pour out of its head;  aim for the eye if you're fighting the dragon; and just throw whatever you've got at the Occamy."
John complied, pressing him gently against the wall. The kiss was soft and slow, relieving him of post-exam stress. He broke apart from him smiling. "What was that for?"
Sherlock’s eyebrows climbed towards his hairline. He suppressed the glow of excitement threatening to make itself known and nodded steadily. “Fine. John and I will follow behind later in a cab.”
"I meant what I said, and I still stand by it; caring is not an advantage. Like most things, has advantages and disadvantages. But I think that in your case with John, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages."
"When. When we meet, it would be in London. There's nothing to do here except go to Woolsworth and the local supermarket."
“Well, good luck, John. Try not to, y’know, get lost or anything.” Greg clapped him on the back light-heartedly.
"Don't worry about me, John. Just go in there, get in your seat, and keep an eye out for any disturbances. There are opera glasses you can get for a pound in there to help."
"Serial killer. All the victims unconnected, except for that they have a little finger missing." Sherlock's face lightens and he even does a small twirl as he puts on his coat to leave. "Oh, it's Christmas."
“Ah, well, then. I live in Sussex. I play the violin. I will be taking chemistry, biology, music, and French at A levels. I have an older brother called Mycroft. He’s seven years older than me and works...in the civil service.” It's almost laughable how script-like it sounds, as Sherlock lists the most basic of facts about himself, as though it was for a speaking assessment in French, or when a teacher asks for a paragraph about yourself at the beginning of the year they will never read.
"I'm told it's customary for a compliment to be returned with another compliment of a similar nature. As I don't really know what you look like, I can't compliment you on your looks, so voice it is."
"Now would be a pretty good time to tell me anything the Milverssen will pick up on. Don't want any surprises if he reveals you...killed a man, or something."
P.S. Though you giving me permission to go out with other people is appreciated, it's probably not necessary. Most people are too busy with their own soulmates or schoolwork to want to start going out with anyone at the moment. But the same applies to you. You can go out with people if you want.
“We got married fairly quickly. Probably not the best decision. I don’t think we even knew each other very well. She was always… disappearing. Visiting friends I’d never met. Going off to book clubs I wasn’t entirely sure existed.” Definitely familiar. The deja vu turns into full on nausea.
"Please, you completely were. Unless you happen to just be curious about the relationship status of every person you meet, then point out how you're both single and how
"Yes." No point beating around the bush, he thought. Although, hearing him and Sherlock referred to as a 'couple' still sounded odd in his ears, and he had to fight to conceal the ill-timed smile which crept onto his face.
The door knocks and snaps John out of his panicked thoughts as he goes to open the door. The anxiety must be showing on his face because the first thing Sherlock says when he comes in is “sit down. I’ll make tea.”
"Miss, you sit down on the chair here. You, stand there. You stand there. Very good. Don't slouch please, lad. Now, say 'cheese'!"
"Yes, but you're yet to explain to me why you suspect the orchestra," Mycroft insisted. "They've all been security checked,  along with other members of the cast and crew. They've all been part of the production for at least six months, and none of them has any known affiliation with any government, terrorist group or otherwise."
The eagle's eye shined brighter and seemed to glare right through John, analytical, judgemental. Like Sherlock, he thought to himself. Despite the feeling of discomfort and self-consciousnesses in his throat, John clenched his fist and kept eye contact with the door knocker. Eventually the door opened, and John breathed a sigh of relief. "Thanks." He said
Sherlock: But not because of John. Because I’m a good friend who will support you in your directorial debut
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply with a sarcastic comment, when Professor Slughorn walked in and greeted the room.
"Lost track of time, sorry. You look great, by the way. Nice dress." John nodded to the long, purple dress Mary was wearing.
You really needn't worry about giving me permission - rather a waste of ink I think. In case you have somehow already forgotten, not many people like me, let alone are attracted to me. And don't do your old but 'I like you! you're a nice person on the inside!' et cetera, et cetera. It's a basic, indisputable fact. You're the exception that proves the rule apparently.
"That's easy for you to say. You're not the one crushed by someone lying on top of them. Budge up a bit so I can breathe, yeah?"
This is the first time Sherlock has spoken of it so bluntly, of the damage his years aways still causes him today.
“Nothing a bit of soap and water can’t fix afterwards.” John kissed his husband of four years softly, yet allowing for enough teasing movements and touches to promise for more and send a thrill down Sherlock's spine, then pulled away and walked towards the bathroom. Sherlock’s heart rate had increased immensely, and he felt tangibly the loss of John’s body heat. Two can play at that game, the detective thought to himself smugly as he waited a few minutes, knowing John would be getting impatient soon too.
