John nods and gets to his feet. Tugs on his jacket. Turns back.
“Fuck technically!” she hisses, and her arms go around him even more tightly. “Not a word of it is true, and I don’t even know why I said it now, because
, is like a little death, sending white sheets of lightning sparking across my eyes, and I am crying out more or less continuously now, jerking and spasming around him with more pleasure than a mortal body could survive.
“Technically-”
, Mycroft. Please,” Sherlock bites out, and Mycroft sighs again.
“Did you know Sherlock kept a diary?” she asks instead of answering, and no, John had not known that. “I found it under the desk last week. I’d dropped a slide and…”
“Hmm, indeed,” Mycroft says, and I can hear the little smirk in his voice. My fist begins to itch. It’s Pavlovian at this point – hear Mycroft smirking, want to punch Mycroft in his pointy face. Woof bloody woof, arsehole. “Sherlock is actually a girl’s name? That was the best you could come up with?”
“So, Violet. She’s new,” John says. Sherlock raises an eyebrow at him. “I mean, I haven’t met her…before.”
confused, because she’s talking as though it’s the most ridiculous thing she’s ever heard and John, personally, doesn’t think it’s that ridiculous of an idea. Not when you’ve seen someone come out of someone else’s bedroom wearing their things, anyway.
“It was my pleasure,” Sherlock says, and escorts her to the door, where she rises on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek as he helps her with her coat.
“John, trust me on this. Sherlock Holmes is so gay he fell off the other end of the rainbow, okay?” Claire says, giving him a little shove.
, ruined and undone by the touch of John’s hands, by his skin against mine. It’s the best high I have ever experienced, better than cocaine, better than heroin, and I can’t imagine ever not needing this with every fibre of my being, now that I’ve had it.
And then he tells her about the way that Sherlock had baby-proofed 221B, had moved his experiments to 221C, had bought a cot and a highchair and a pram, had learned how to play lullabies on the violin. He tells her how, when they had first moved into 221B with Sherlock - when John and Rosie were still sharing the upstairs bedroom - he would wake up in the morning to find Rosie asleep on Sherlock’s chest in the living room. How when she took her first steps it was into Sherlock’s arms. He reminds her of violin lessons and painting each other’s toenails, and the way Sherlock would read to her for hours when she was fussy, or recite entire plays.
The word spread from there. If you’re in trouble, if your date is not taking no for an answer, if your drink tastes funny or you’re not sure where your feet have gone,
“It’d be a disaster,” Sherlock mutters.
!” Rosie protests, and she’s pacing in front of the bench now, her hands in her golden hair. “That’s stupid! She got herself killed, how could he blame himself for that? How could
Claire sighs.
“Morning,” she says, and her voice – husky and sweetly low – goes perfectly with the frankly spectacular combination of eyes, mouth, and body. “You must be John. Tea?”
“I take it you two sorted it out, then?” he asks.
So there they are, dressed to the nines – Mycroft sent John a suit via faceless minion for the occasion, and John didn’t even bother to argue, while Sherlock is wearing that fucking purple shirt that makes his skin look like cream, and a suit that caresses his body in a way that John, personally, finds very upsetting. And when they walk into the room, it’s like the weirdest sort of Brownian motion.
He walks straight for a table near the windows, where a gorgeous blonde is sitting opposite someone. John can’t follow the conversation – he resolves to learn how to lip read – but Sherlock says something, the woman says something…
for? I’m almost overcome by the urge to march in there and shake Sherlock until a name falls out, and then find whoever he has been pining for and drag them back to 221B, in chains if need be. Or leave them on his doorstep wrapped in a red ribbon, like a cat, except I’d probably not disembowel them first. I could bring Sherlock presents, if I was a cat. Dead mice and so on, he’d probably like that. He’d do experiments on them.
“When we discovered what Eurus had done,” Mycroft begins, and Sherlock stiffens almost imperceptably. Mycroft continues, implacable. “We did not immediately understand the full import. A child should not have been capable of what she did to you - there are people who train for years and are not capable of doing what she did to you. When I told you that you erased your memory of Eurus, that…was not entirely true.”
I’m not entirely surprised when John gently shoulders open the door after a few minutes, both his hands on a tray. On the tray, there are the elegant lines of a decanter, and a single large glass winking rainbow reflections from its cut-glass facets. He doesn’t speak, as he sets the tray down on the counter, as he pours the ruby-winking blood into the glass for me. He smiles, as I reach out a languid hand to accept it, and there’s something mischievous in his eyes that I don’t
Your friend thinks you sleep with women!”
“Well,” John says quietly, “that’s probably how it felt to him.”
And then he wets a washcloth and doesn’t speak as he runs it down my body, and it’s as though the heat from the water has taken up residence in my very core. I drain the glass, he pours me another, and I drain that too. I can feel him settling into my body, reactivating my quiescent cells with his essence, I can feel him bringing me to life even as his hands move over my slow-warming skin, the palest hint of a blush staining my skin now. So it begins.
A few weeks after the Orgy Incident, John and Sherlock are on a case when Sherlock gets a text. He’s busy at his microscope and John gets it for him, but the text does not make any actual sense.
but…okay, he might be a bit jealous. He finds the fact that he’s not sure whether he’s more jealous of Sherlock or Claire more than a little distressing. He may be bi, but Sherlock is clearly a fan of the ladies, and having those kinds of thoughts about straight guys is a road to pain and humiliation and sad lonely wanking.
“But-”
“No, not by then. I’m sorry, Bee.”
“Where…where did you hear that?” he asks.
And every word sinks into John’s chest like a punch from an angry stranger, and he makes a strangled sound almost like a sob.
The cabbie is about to pull away, but John taps the glass and shakes his head.
“Sit down. You’ve hurt Sherlock, hurt him badly, and I’m not letting you anywhere near him until you know enough to understand exactly what you’ve done. So sit down, and listen.”
“I did too!” Sherlock cries. “I said women aren’t my area, what more do you want?”
And maybe it’s time he admits it.
“Oh right, let’s try for hope shall we?” Sherlock says. “What do you want me to do, Mycroft? Walk up to him one day and say “John, I’m really rather desperately in love with you? I’m afraid I’ve deleted most of what I knew about sex except for what’s useful for cases but I think I’d quite like to lick you all over? I want to run experiments to compare the taste of your mouth after every meal, and when you glare at me I want to go on my knees for you? I want to wake up next to you and go to sleep next to you and watch crap telly and drink bad wine, and I want to learn dead languages so I can tell you how much I love you because no language currently existing has the words for it?” Should I tell him that his hands make me come over all wobbly and that when the world gets too loud I want to hide my face in his jumpers because I’m not sure why but I think it might help? Is
“Oh, Sherlock,” he says. “Oh, brother mine, there you are.”
If possible, John is now
The system now is pretty efficient, actually. If your date turns out to be a creeper, you tap an app. The app signals Sherlock, provides him with a location, and Sherlock…shows up. According to Grace, Sherlock has proposed to her no less than eight times (she has awful taste in men), every time a beautifully acted, tearful scene of reconciliation that, on two occasions, had the restaurant applauding their reunion. He keeps an engagement ring in his dresser for occasions like that.
“Nice to see some things don’t change,” someone says beside him, and Sherlock turns to find Claire standing next to him.
Sherlock’s head jerks up and he’s out of the chair and into his coat, John on his heels, a moment later. Sherlock snaps at the cabby to take them to the address from the text and fumbles in his pockets for something that’s clearly not there.
In the echoing silence after, Sherlock almost runs back to the flat, dialling Mycroft as he goes.
Sherlock nods sullenly.
“Can you see that, Sherlock?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to say something, he doesn’t know what (it will probably be something witty and self-deprecating though) but Rosie speaks before he can.
, and he looks up from the petri dishes at a flash of motion in the corner of his eye to watch as a stack of books (which he’d really meant to pack away) topples in slow-motion horror onto Rosie’s head.
“I picked the lock,” she says, holding up a hairpin. She’s been crying, and she looks strangely awkward, standing there with a hairpin in one hand, her shoulders hunched and her hair wind-blown. “I’m so sorry for what I said.”
“Mycroft,” he says. “Something’s wrong with me.”
blame him for that?”
?” he finds himself asking, and Sherlock flinches away from him. When John takes a step closer Sherlock actually
“If I could delete anything about you, Mycroft, I would have deleted you entirely,” Sherlock snaps.
They’ll sort it out. They always do. Sometimes his geniuses just need a little push.
Sherlock is almost crawling up the back of his chair, staring at the table in horror.
John doesn’t bother to be offended about being offered tea in his own damn kitchen because honestly, she’s brightening the place up enormously, so he sits down and moment later finds himself presented with a perfect cuppa.
He doesn’t get much further, because John is crowding into his space and kissing him and kissing him and kissing him.
John is about halfway with his tea when he hears the shower turn on and Sherlock emerges from his bedroom wearing his other dressing gown and clutching the tea like it’s a lifesaver. He squints at John for a moment, then heads straight for the toaster.
Claire is back to laughing now, though, and she’s sort of hanging off of John because from the looks of things, she’s laughing so hard that she can’t actually stand.
oh god. I moan as his flavours spread out on my tongue, warmsafeteagun
Mycroft finds himself on his knees beside Sherlock’s chair, wrapping his hands around Sherlock’s, and he isn’t entirely sure but he thinks he may be crying.
” he says, and makes his way over to where John and Claire are standing.
Sherlock looks at him like he’s lost his mind and Mycroft shakes his head, asking for a moment without words. Sherlock untangles one hand and places it gingerly on Mycroft’s head, as though he’s not entirely sure what to do with all this emotion.
“And the…sleeping, thing?” John asks, awed. “How does that happen?”
It’s different now, now that there is John. Now, I can hardly wait to finish the case so that I can feed. I can wait, though. I make myself wait.
When she’s gone Sherlock returns to his bedroom without a word, and sleeps for two hours before emerging to sprawl on the couch for the rest of the day.
Sherlock looks like he’s crying for a moment, his hands reaching out toward her. Her dinner companion looks enormously offended, which is a not-unusual reaction to Sherlock and John can certainly sympathise.
. Sherlock actually
“You’re a wizard, Sherlock.”
The first time it happens, Sherlock is watching Rosie. Well, he’s supposed to be watching Rosie, but the toenails have started fizzing, which they’re not supposed to do
And then comes the morning John comes down the stairs in his dressing gown (having combed his hair just in case) and Sherlock’s door opens and out comes Anne, Grace, Sally, Claire, and three or four other women he doesn’t know. Three of them are wearing Sherlock’s dressing gowns, two of them are wrapped in bedsheets, one is wrapped up in the duvet, and one is wearing what he’s almost certain is Sherlock’s shirt. Her panties are…tiny. And pink. John makes them tea and they smile at him and ruffle his hair disappear one at a time into the bathroom to emerge flawlessly put together and still smiling.
There’s a lump in his throat, but he manages it. “Of course. Of course I forgive you, Bee.” he murmurs, and drops a kiss on her head. “Sometimes people hurt each other.”
what you want me to tell John Watson?”
“Sherlock,” Claire asks. “Did you actually tell John that you’re gay?”
All too soon, we will need to get up. John needs a shower – I need a shower, come to think of it. The sheets will need to be…quite possibly burned. Again. There are things to do, important things, but right now? With John in my arms, warm against my skin, his beating heart sounding in my ears?
“Hmm?”
“Did he have my coat with him?”
“Roger that.” John adjusted the FLIR cameras and saw a mass of red and yellow moving across the blue. It had snowed here recently, so the mass of…something was very obvious. Dogs. He felt a stab of sheer relief, “Good eye, Sherlock! That’s them!”
“The writing is on the wall.” He couldn’t help it, he
“We probably should. She’s showing symptoms of an overdose, she shouldn’t be conscious right now with the volume of drugs in her system right now.”
“Yes, he does.”
“You?! You two?”
“Not much.”
“Ta.” He took the offered hand and heaved himself to his feet. A pair of constables hustled Lachey to his feet and got him bundled into the back of the marked squad-car after making sure he didn’t need an ambulance.
“No opening strange doors. You don’t know where they’ll take you. Turn around, leave, and go home.” She talked to herself, trying to talk herself
“Do you want me to help you?”
“Sure.” John honestly didn’t care where they went. Greg did the driving, and they were looking for parking twenty minutes later along Francis Street. Finding an empty spot, Greg took it for himself. John paid for the parking and they went into the pub. It was remarkably busy for a Thursday night, but that made sense.
“Redbeard was never a real dog, John.”
it was. John had been waiting for those questions to come up.
“Get off me!”
“Oh, Christ. Unlikely!” John rolled his eyes. “Like Hell he misses me, I’ve only been gone for a week! If you know
, son, it’s all over you. Lucky girl you’ve got, son.”
“Pongo. He’s the sire of the last fifteen puppies that were stolen from the Radcliffes.”
“Well, here’s my number. Call for any reason, I’m usually around.” Lestrade passed her a card, printed with his information, “And I mean any reason. Case-work, Sherlock being an arse, hell, call me for a pint if you want!”
“Here, drink this.” A bottle of water was pressed into his hands as he got settled, and John made sure his seatbelt was buckled. It had been one of Greg’s rules, if you were riding with him you always wore your seatbelt. Sherlock had hated that, and usually refused to wear his. John took a gulp of the water and tried to steady himself.
“Not yet.”
“John, please. It’s fine.”
“Sherlock, don’t. Whatever this Wilkes bloke did to you, it’s unforgivable. It’s
was shaking. “I don’t even … I swear I didn’t do anything!”
“How does anyone meet Mycroft Holmes?”
“I’m sorry? Did you…say something?”
A break in the action. But it's not quite peaceful. Then it's back to routine.
“A bit of a, erm, retirement present, if you will.” Q just grinned at him, all unruly dark curls, dimples, and iridescent hazel eyes that shone behind practical, functional glasses with thick black frames that should have been gaudy but were quite stylish. At least, they were on the youthful man who ran the division once overseen by Geoffrey Boothroyd.
“Thanks.” Greg pushed her into the house ahead of him, “Saw your lights on. Everything good here?”
When they reached the Morgue, they located an empty office, but it wasn’t hard to find Doctor Hooper. She was in the intake area, they found her by following the sound of her voice.
do, and they have four children.”
“What happened?”
“That’s good to hear.” Greg took a gulp of coffee and looked at the clock.
“Yeah, I’ll say it did!” She was thinking of the people who had died in the flat-block explosion. And Jefferson Hope’s victims.
, you’d tapped out with an honorable discharge after you kept refusing to be promoted!”
“Mmhm. We’ll see about that.” Pushing the door open with her foot, she stepped into the living-room. “Step out, please, and don’t cause a scene.”
“What was
“I’m fine, Sherlock.” John looked at him, obviously not completely fine. “I promise.”
Greg called up the officers waiting outside and they had Hope transferred down to the station. As he was bundled into the waiting car, he had one more thing to say to Greg.
was almost too tame.
“I’m not drunk.”
“How far?” She looked up from packing. Most of what they’d been packing was for
“Oh no.”
“Q, how did you ... ?” John trailed off, lost for words. “Christ, she’s perfect. Looks like new!”
Behind them, Judith unlocked the cuff on Sherlock’s left hand and transferred it to John’s left wrist, chaining the boys together and collecting the hand-cuffs they had used to restrain John until they could get him to the street. Sherlock looked over his shoulder, watching what she was doing and where they were standing as she hooked the hand-cuffs to her duty-belt and pocketed that cuff-key.
“Not that I know of. I’m kind of hoping he does something stupid so you can lay him out.”
“Will you talk to me at Scotland Yard, or will you only talk to me here?” This was almost too easy, she was a bit concerned.
“Yes, dear?”
“Vauxhall Arches last week. Worked his way north towards Baker Street, spotted around Regent’s Park two days ago.”
“I know.” The cabbie turned his head to glance over his shoulder at the flashing lights reflecting on the window pane. A siren whooped outside, just once.
“Please?” He sniffled. The coat in question belonged to John Watson and Sherlock had slept with it every night since Watson had given it to him out of a kindness because it smelled like the Fey. He was some manner of Cù-Sìth, but Sherlock wasn’t sure what. He’d have said Werewolf, but he didn’t think that was quite right, either. There was a soft rustling and he was aware of Mycroft lifting him from the floor and setting him on the couch, covering him with something.
“What on earth happened to you? You look terrible!”
“Shall I send your coat for cleaning, Sir?” Anthea asked quietly.
since he’d flown, but like riding a bike, it was something you never really forgot how to do. And this particular model was one he had plenty of flight-time in. He and Sherlock were given flight-suits to wear over their clothes and micc’ed helmets after he got a quick tour of familiar controls.
“That’s a nice word for it!”
of them!”
“Breakfast. I’ll cook.”
“Sherlock?” Oh, Christ, I think he was ... seventeen? Eighteen? Absolutely brilliant, he just ... he just ... ”
“My name is not important, my willingness to pull the trigger before you can blink again, however.” He said. “Down, Lachey. Right now.”
It was her brother.
Mycroft Holmes.” Barrymore sneered, completely unaware of Judith’s presence on-base. This might actually be a bit of fun.
“Is that a problem?”
“No. Retired.”
“Doubt his name is that understated.” John took the license back and looked at the familiar face. “Never twins. It’s
“Planning to. Didn’t drive over, took the train, of course.”
“Why did your mother leave, John?”
“I want you to see something. If you can’t drive, we can get a cab.”
“Oi.” He bit gently on John’s left ear to scold him. The body under his paws trembled and he realized John was laughing.
“Hard to when you’re on the streets.” He cleared his throat and picked up his glasses and biro again.
“Oh, Christ.” She folded her hands against her mouth, tapping her lips with her fingertips. A pair of MI6 suits, it looked like. This could be just about anything, but she didn’t think it was another inspection, there had been no word.
“We’re not exactly typical siblings, and less what people expect of two doctors. For god’s sake, I’m a police-officer!”
“Would you like to see something?”
“You have such a beautiful name. Your parents wanted another son, were a bit disappointed when they got you.”
“Your wi-fi password.” Strange grinned at her, “We’re not complete savages at Kamar-Taj, Judith. Sleep well.”
“Oh, and Watson?”
“Alright, you’ve been like this all week. What’s wrong?”
“You can be such a spoil-sport sometimes.”
She hung up with Mycroft and pulled up her email server. There was one email from Mycroft, which she opened and downloaded right away. Once the email had downloaded, she touched base with Greg, who told them to find a place to bunk down and get some rest. If he needed them, they would know. Judith decided to head for Baker Street, Sally had no opposition to that idea.
them. If Judith hadn’t gotten between Sherlock Holmes and a pack of bullies on her way home from school that one day, an entire lifetime ago for them, it was unlikely they would have met each other any time soon enough to make a difference in each other’s lives. But because he had befriended the loner genius when no one else wanted to be around him, John had been there for Sherlock in some of his darkest times and still hadn’t turned his back on the other boy.
“Of course, 008.” She glanced up and made brief eye-contact as he went into the office beyond. “Good luck in the outside.”
“What happened, Sherlock?” He set the tray down carefully. “You alright?”
he? He had to be somewhere nearby, he wouldn’t sit this out from the side-lines. Someone like Jim Moriarty would want to be front and centre of the final spectacle. At least, she assumed it would be the last spectacle. She hoped. Time to go hunting.
“I’ve been on your website loads of times. You are brilliant.”
When the row ended with Holmes turning his back on Doctor Hooper and storming out, John simply stepped out of the way and watched him go.
“I told you why I don’t go all the way.” She looked over her shoulder, “I like dictating my own hours and it lets me keep eyes on the boys when they need it.”
“Only you would think that’s exciting, Sherlock Holmes. Bloody poncy git, too damn useful.” He shook his head and headed for the scene.
?” He gasped.
Judith sighed and hung up with Moran. This could end well or poorly, and she wasn’t really sure who had control anymore.
“You’re not a mad driver, are you?”
“Don’t I
“This way, please, Mr Holmes!”She said brightly, collecting two menus before leading them into the dining-room. She kept up polite chit-chat as they were seen to their reserved table, extra place-settings were removed once they were seated and John did not miss how they both sat backs to the wall once seated. Their server appeared moments later, as was standard for this place. He was young, just out of university or … no, still working his way through, clean-cut and professional, but John saw a peek of ink on his forearms.
“Sherlock!” John scolded as Lestrade chuckled.
“Oh my goodness!”
giddy all over again. He fished the box from his pocket, and snapped a quick picture that he sent to John, and Sherlock for good measure because he knew he’d hear about it if he didn’t.
“What’s up, Greg?”
“Dogs are smart. I heard the Barking Chain the last couple of days, so I know word got where it needed to.” John smiled and squeezed Mrs Radcliffe’s hand, “They have channels of communication just like we do.”
you!” Moriarty was standing, his companion was seated, and he was practically radiating fury and dominance. John frowned and carefully removed himself. He was downstairs helping stack glasses at the bar when Moriarty appeared.
good at her job, and was well on her way to solving a string of suicides that had plagued the city since last October by herself, but the promotion still came as a bit of a shock to him and the rest of their family. It wasn’t
“Interesting place.” Donovan murmured, looking around the restaurant. Mycroft did not miss how Donovan, Lestrade, and Hughes all staking out the area, and at least two of them had eyes on the main entrance. Lestrade faced towards the kitchen, busy keeping tabs on the wait-staff and customers coming and going from that part of the restaurant while Donovan and Hughes took care of the other angles. Not that Maroush was a dangerous place, but old habits died hard and he appreciated their watchfulness.
“Very good. Some say one of the best.”
“You can’t make that promise, Seb.”
“No, no, no. I’m smarter than that, more clever.” He smiled at John, “I take the cases no one else will bother with and I help The Met when they need me. Which is always, as they’re all a bunch of idiots.”
!” She radioed Sally, told her to stay with Sherlock.
“Yeah, pretty much. There’s not really a filter there, you know?” She sighed, “He doesn’t hate you, he just doesn’t fly at the same altitude the rest of us do.”
“Thought as much. Of course you would.”
“Two, three nights ago?”
“God damn it, Sherlock!” he muttered, looking around. He’d lost the man on Suffolk Place and had to double-back. Retracing his steps, he managed to pick up the trail on Haymarket and broke into a run. Taking a sharp right onto Orange Street, he cut left again at Oxendon Street and skidded. The street was packed with people and he cursed under his breath. Of course, this was the after-theatre crowd. Then, over by the entrance to the parking garage directly across from the theatre, John spotted a familiar tall figure going inside.
!” Sally rolled her eyes and tapped her radio.
“Come along, I’m a friend.” Smelling the jerky, and probably figuring out that John was a dog-lover, the sire came up to him and sniffed.
Mycroft had memorized their medical records and all relevant information shortly after coming into a position where he could access those records, and wondered if having similar fingerprints had ever been an issue for them. Without much of a history of trouble with the law, it was unlikely, but it would no doubt raise a few eyebrows when people figured out that they shared the same DNA and the fingerprint on the index and thumb of their left hands. By some luck of genetics, the Watson twins had ducked a common condition among mirror twins known as situs inversus and were two of the healthiest people he knew of, John’s discharge injury aside. And even that hadn’t
“Precisely!” He finished his business in the bathroom, took one good look at his reflection, and groaned. “Oh Lord.”
“I've got him, Jude.” Sally came over to help.
“You know where to put them, my love!” The tune of the music changed as she reached the top of the stairs. She looked at her brother and rolled her eyes.
“Oh grow up, 008.” Q rolled his eyes as he took the pen back and disarmed it.
“Not really. And you don’t give me any trouble.”
“So what now?” John murmured as they finally stepped out of sight of the gathered personnel.
“No kidding!” Donovan rolled her eyes, “And I
“It’s in your room, dear. You’ve slept with it every night. Shall I get it for you?”
“Harry Watson: clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man’s gadget.
“Sorry, Lestrade. Yes. As I was saying.” And he launched back into his tirade. Until: “Fantastic.”
“No, thank you.”
“But why?”
“No one else gets to call you an idiot. No matter what. You can’t go off and get yourself into trouble without me, ever.”
“Did you
“The loyalty of the Watsons is not to be underestimated. Do so at your own peril, and prepare to be met with hackles and teeth if you dare.” Mycroft smiled a bit crookedly, “I was aware of the kidnapping, but I suspected if it had come to grave danger, I would have heard from either John or Judith regarding your final fate, little brother.” Sherlock just hissed at Mycroft as he looked at the three of them, unbothered by his brother’s little tantrum.
“You’re smiling.”
“Right, childhood. You saved him from bullies.” Moran smiled and rubbed his thumb along her cheek, “You’ve always followed me without question, and I swore I would never lead you astray. I never did, I never will.”
“Interesting people, mostly.” Moriarty explained with a casual shrug.
Running the water as hot as he could stand it, John took a brief shower. He didn’t want to waste any unnecessary time, so he didn’t linger. Already aroused from the brief workout earlier, his body had reacted with shameful predictability to the sight of his naked young flat-mate, but John still didn’t bother with more than a stroke or two. Finishing up with his shower, he dried off quickly with a towel and wrapped it around his waist.
“221B Baker Street, to mine. You need a new place to live, we both need a flat-mate. Next?”
Greg caught her on the first-floor landing and dragged her to a halt. She didn’t get a chance to ask him what he was doing, because he went ahead and did it. It was a good thing her back was to the wall, but that didn’t stop her from grabbing the front of his NATO jumper. Subtle touches while out in public and cuddling at home was pretty much the order of the day, but they’d never gone further in kissing than innocent kisses on the cheek or forehead before bed or in the morning. Greg pinned her to the wall with one knee between her legs, and one hand on her shoulder. The other was free to touch.
“You caught him good, though. He really does like you.” Moran stroked her hair, “I’ll make sure you and your boys are safe in this mad little game of his. Who matters to you, besides John?”
“Christ.” Judith rested on her haunches after discerning the victim’s state, “We need Homicide. Call Dispatch.”
found me, didn’t you?”
“Oh, that was an awful day! And I don’t regret doing that, by the way, I really don’t. If I’d been of the mind, I probably would have decked that bitch for swinging at you like that.”
.” John rolled his eyes, “Last time that happened, you showed up in a bloody

“It’s home enough.” Sherlock closed the door behind him with a bit more force than John thought was necessary, nearly slamming it. “Mrs Hudson!”
“Since I realized it was
her, Seb!” Moran’s companion wouldn't stop smiling, “You say she was one of your best?”
Once he had the ad in the papers, all he could do was wait. And it was a gut-wrenching wait of nearly two weeks past his initial submission to the papers before anything happened. Timing was everything and the first time he took a caller that day, it was Moriarty.

I also used some dialogue from The Abominable Bride in this chapter! Modified for my purposes, of course, but can I just say that TAB John Watson is a sassy bastard and I love him so dearly?
“Yeah, sure. Word had it you’ve been on the streets these past few weeks?”
“That will make things easier.” John watched the tall man move around collecting things from different drawers. Not to mention
“Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas — an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know, he is a decent fellow.”
“Are you alright?”
“Good,” John said briskly. One of the constables went ahead of them and held the door of Lestrade’s car for them. Didn’t say anything, didn’t look John in the eye.

“First day on the job, Constable?”
“Couple of hours. Make any headway?”

“Well, it’s … uh, it’s good to see you.”
The line clicked dead and she watched the phone drop from Sherlock’s hand.
“My trusted partner on the outside.” She took a deep breath, “You’re not my brother, or his boyfriend, you’re not my fiancé, you’re…something completely different.”
“Somebody’s awfully excited.” Greg teased as she headed for the wrap-around veranda once she had changed, “Where are
me, you know? Kind of my job you’re meddling with.” She glared at Mycroft, “This has been sitting on your desk for two weeks, Mycroft!”
“What?” Greg was lost,
“It’s not excusing him, but he
“Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me,” Roben said derisively, rolling his eyes as John turned towards him. “Often are, these vigilante types.” He had been looking around the living room but caught John staring at him.
Using a sling-portal, Judith travelled from London to New York. It was early morning in New York, roughly seven am, and she was desperately hoping that she wouldn’t be giving Stephen Strange a rude awakening. She hadn’t raised any alarms coming in and went to see if the Master of New York was awake yet or if she was about to give him a rude wake-up call. She
“What is this?”
As soon as he was on his way, she stood on the kerb and debated going home to Kensington or to Baker Street. She sighed and set off with no real direction in mind, and walked for what seemed like hours. No one bothered her, and she wondered if anyone actually noticed her, or if she just
“Get me to drop-altitude! Now!” She barked at the pilot as she suited up.
“Oi!”
“Stamford?” John tilted his head as they shook hands. “Mike Stamford?”
“Y’know. There’s whispers around that Sherlock ‘Olmes is back from the dead. Rose like Lazarus from his grave, right.” The soft voice, thick with a Highland accent, startled him. Sherlock stopped dead and looked over.
“Sorry. No, I’m…fine.” He cleared his throat and looked up at the constable, “It’s fine.”
“But I would know you in any crowd, John.” He looked over, “I’m trying to decide what it is you’ve done with your hair and why you did it.”
Seeing an opportunity, Judith rushed forward and slammed her full weight against Jim’s back, wrapping one arm around his neck and the other around his chest. Sherlock backed up a step in surprise but kept the pistol raised and aimed at Jim.
“Which one do you think? Which one’s the good pill? Come on. I know you’ve got a theory.” Sherlock raised his gaze and the two men locked eyes.
“John. I’m … so sorry. I didn’t mean to.” Sherlock spoke up first, “I didn’t … I’m
in the man’s presence, as if all he need do was ask him and he would protect Sherlock from everything. He clearly respected Moriarty, but Sherlock had the feeling John Watson would have no problem at all standing up to the púca.
“Take care of yourselves, boys.”
Judith smiled and sent off that last text. Setting her alarm for her usual time, she set her phone on the bed-side table and tugged on the covers, sliding into the warm cocoon. Almost as soon as she was settled, a weight landed on her shoulder and she grunted.
“No. It’s.
“You and the other two?”
“All of Lieutenant-Colonel Watson’s things are inside in the first upstairs bedroom, Inspector. Mr. Holmes sends his regards and asks that you remember the arrangement.”
“Oh, Jesus.”
“And, there he goes.” John chuckled and followed Sherlock. They found the bullet in the bathroom sink, surrounded by broken glass. It had passed through the wall and smashed into the mirror above the sink before dropping into the basin. Using a piece of tissue, they collected the projectile and handed it over to Hutchison.
“I’m off today, well, I’m supposed to be anyway. But tomorrow, I’ll go back on the streets.”
“Rather good at it, never mind my brother’s injury. We took it easy, yeah, but it felt damn good to lay our grievances to the pavement.” She sighed, “God, we came so
“Come on, you, let’s go face the vultures.” He winked and took Sherlock’s hand as Mrs Hudson opened the door for them. He stepped out first, completely ignoring the small army of reporters with their cameras, phones, and dictatapes. People still
I forgot!”
“Well, not exactly.”
“Hmm?”
After finishing the coffee, which really did help wake him up, Greg headed for Judith’s room. He knew without question that the man sitting at her bedside was no one to be trifled with. The way he dressed was outlandish, almost like something out of a fairy-tale. There was something about him that reminded Greg of Sherlock, but he wasn’t sure what it was, exactly. He let the door close quietly behind him and leaned against the door to observe. It was quiet for a few minutes, the tense silence only broken by the beeping of the monitors and the soft murmuring of the man at Judith’s bedside.
After paying the bill, which John was not allowed to see, Mycroft took him home and made him promise to at least
“You’re awful, Sherlock Holmes, but God bless you for stepping in for Sally Donovan.”
“No, I can feel it. You’re all…foggy.” She rolled so she was on top and leaned in to kiss him, “You need to sleep more.”
“Neurosurgery. Worked out of Metro-General Hospital until…this.” Strange wiggled his fingers for emphasis.
“Leave it!” He pulled, “That’s Judith! She’ll pick it up! Keep going!” He shoved John down a side alley as the police car raced straight across the junction. They ran down the alleyway and reached high railings blocking their way. They got separated for a minute until they figured out how to get John over the railings.
“West.”
“And Moriarty?”
“Selfless bit of good. What’s her name?”
“I was just curious.”
“Watson!” Lestrade called warningly from off to their right. Judith turned her head to him.
. Hold still.” He scolded as he carefully turned her over onto her stomach. She rolled her eyes and pulled the pillow under her chest to support her head as he carefully stripped away her pyjama bottoms to get full access to the point of interest.
.” He gestured with the memory stick, obtained for them by John Watson, then began to turn in a slow circle while he waited for a response. He had terms for this exchange. The pen-drive for Judith Watson’s safety. Wherever she was, he held the ransom-price in his hand. And he would settle for nothing less than her safe return, in exchange for those plans. If she had been harmed, the deal was off.
“God, I thought I’d lost you again. Did Mycroft and Greg know?”
“He’s with me.”
“I wish I believed you, Hutch. Wish I believed you.” John sighed and covered his face for a minute. A hand on his arm got his attention and he looked up to see Hutchison holding something out to him. It was a photograph. He took it and studied it.
take our assistance.”
She still lived in Greg’s flat over in Kensington, which made getting her car in the mornings
John looked at the twins next.
“Can you...where did I put the green parka from the other day?”
“Real piece of work, runs a fashion-house in London. Name of DeVil.” He ducked into the taxi and gave the address for Baker Street. “Uh, 221B Baker Street, please.”
Yes, Moriarty's goons took Judith! No, he is NOT pleased, and neither is Judith. Come to think of it, I doubt ANYONE is thrilled about it. Wrong Watson, you morons! But, that was a dummy-vest, so maybe not too bad? But then we get a reminder that Jim Moriarty is always going to be a charming, sick, twisted psychopath no matter how fond of someone he might be.
“No. We walked from Baker Street.”
“It’s April 11th, you went out on April 1st.”
“All good things, Lucifer, don’t worry.”
“Really really. I’ve got enough on my plate with this case, I can wait a bit to get your statements. Just don’t forget, Sherlock.”
“It was ugly. Three days before John shipped out he was hauling Sherlock out of a drug-den in the West End before the cops busted the place wide open. Last he knew, it was off to rehab for Sherlock.” She dropped into the passenger seat of a marked car, “We didn’t hear from or see the Holmes brothers until the two of them dropped in on Camp Bastion in 2005 while I was posted there. Then it was on-again off-again for a few more years until just a few days ago when Sherlock dropped retirement orders on my desk in Afghanistan and I got shipped home.”
“Upstairs. Can’t make heads or tails of it, I was kind of hoping you might be able to.” Lestrade showed them where the bodies had been found and gave them everything he already had on it.   Sherlock did a bit of his usual showing off, and about halfway through a rant about how it was both a double-homicide and a murder-suicide (and oh boy did Lestrade give him a look for that one), he was distracted by a soft exclamation from off to his left.
“John?”
“Who on earth would bother?”
“Hmm. Lucky you.” Iridescent blue eyes the colour of the sky at dawn right at the horizon just after the sun rose rolled and water splashed as Sherlock flicked two fingers in disdain.
“Am I supposed to be impressed?”
“I can take care of myself.” She smiled and pulled away from the scene.
“Literally?” He grinned at her, “Don’t let me get in your way, Captain. You have an important job to do.”
“Good evening, Sherlock. Good evening, Judith, John.” Mycroft was polite, at least.
“Daddy, Daddy! Uncle Sherlock!”
“So you think it’s a woman, too?”
“Sorry, can you…say that again?”
“Dim sum. My treat.”
“I can be nice. These people lost their puppies, John, that’s serious business.” Sherlock batted snow from his coat, “Do you really think it was DeVil?”
“Never leave without it.” She promised. She hadn’t left home without her sling-ring or her Browning. Experience in both worlds had taught her to be prepared for everything. Violence of any kind was unlikely where she was going, but it was better to be prepared than caught off-guard.
“I don’t think so, which is a bit of a shame. I’d remember you for sure.”
rachamaid sios, thugnamaid sios;
like in his Other Form. The fur was longer than standard, incredibly soft, and it smelled just the way John did, but stronger. It was pleasant and safe.
Here we meet Mary, for the VERY brief time she's part of the story. I honestly don't have a clue what happens to her, I just know she's "taken care of" before she causes trouble for the boys. Obviously, they haven't gone public with Sherlock's return from the dead, but that's coming. There's two cases here, the first one's pretty quickly solved, it's the second one I spend time with. This is where the crossover with 101 Dalmatians begins, so pay attention here.
!” Claudia snarled, turning on Sally like a snake, “And you!”
“Why would you need to apologise?”
“Word got to us you’re cleared to fly one of these! Come with me!” The man grinned and tossed off a salute. John wondered who in hell’s name had dug up
“Are you all right, sir?” A nearby constable asked, concerned for the Chief Superintendent’s safety.
“What if I was to shoot you now – right now?”
“Any victims?”
“And I die in disgrace.” He was staring across the street.
“Uh, h-how did you know my name?”
Sally came out a bit later and hopped into the car.
“Not at all.”
“I suppose we can learn together. I can’t be away for long.”
“Fucking mother of Christ! Is that
“John, stop that.”
“Boring.”
She clicked off and looked at Greg, who was checking his side-arm.
“No real plans. You think you’ll stay out after the test?”
“Jennifer Wilson. She’s with Western Mail & South Wales Echo.” Judith caught her breath, “Found her down in Brixton.”
Quiet nights when they got off at reasonable hours, take-away and bad telly, snuggling with each other on the couch, making room for the cats when they got sick of being ignored. Long nights when they didn’t even leave the office, working to close a case that just wouldn’t work itself out properly. And proper nights out when they could go to Angelo’s for dinner, or he got a chance to unwind at Maroush and watch her work her magic for crowds of appreciative patrons, all while knowing she was all his, and he was the lucky son of a bitch who got to take Judith Watson home at the end of the night.
“Who? Holmes?”
“Oh, I could tell you, but it’s … classified.” John smirked.
“Maybe I did.” He snickered, “Such a shame the sheet didn’t fall off.”
“Hey! No! That’s
of trouble and out of crime-scenes they’re not welcome at!”
“Right now? Not much. I wouldn't worry about him until you have to.”
“Run!” She growled, looking over his shoulder at them. “Just
“I need an assistant for the work I do in London, outside of my work for MI6, of course. But if that’s your sort of thing, I could probably work a security-clearance for you, too.” His smile turned into a cheeky grin and she raised an eyebrow at him. “If…top-secret, deep-cover fieldwork, I’d-have-to-kill-you-if-I-told-you work is your kind of thing, that is?”
“We must. Come along!” he headed for the bathroom, knowing Sherlock would follow. They had both bathed prior, so it wasn’t a very long shower, just enough to clean up after their fun, and John headed into the kitchen to do something about breakfast after getting dressed. Sherlock complained the whole time about how he wasn’t hungry and weren’t there better things to do with their time and John rolled his eyes. Turning from the cook-top where he was busy with eggs and toast, he went to Sherlock’s chair and leaned over the back of it.
one of those sorcerers! Useful trick that is.” The medic looked at her as he placed the line, “Yep, that’ll do the trick. You’ll feel better in a bit.”
“May I have a kiss before you leave?”
“You would know.” John rolled his eyes and tucked Sherlock’s shirt into his trousers. For once, his friend and partner had not elected for his usual bespoke-tailored suit and dress-shirt. Instead, he wore a well-tailored pair of denims, white dress-shirt, and a black brocade waistcoat, casual yet still classy. Going upstairs, John found shoes and trotted back downstairs to sit on the bottom riser and put them on. Sherlock was standing by the door, waiting for him with their coats. John took the green parka with a raised eyebrow. There was history to this coat, important history. Shrugging, he took it and headed down the stairs. Sherlock was right behind him, focused on his phone in one hand. As he held the door for Sherlock, he looked at his watch. It was barely gone seven. He raised an eyebrow, he seemed to be doing that a lot this morning.

“Nah. Not enough of a people-person for
“Morning.”
After solving the taxi-cab murders, Judith settles into a routine at The Met in Criminal Investigation Division, reporting to work every morning at eight, and returning home whenever she gets a chance. But she knows the quiet never lasts very long, it's just a question of who, how, and where. She should know better than to ask a question she may not really want to be answered.
“So?”
“I’m sorry, sir. A little parched.”
“A moment, sir.” She turned to another page, “Interesting. I didn’t think I’d gotten anyone’s attention quite that high on the chain of command, but that’s that.”
“Well, no, that’s not how it works around here. I
“Of course, we have work to do.” He handed her a slip of paper and left. She looked at what was written on the paper and made a face.
“Oh. Yeah.” She coughed, draining the rest of her tea. It had been spiked with
“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes — it approaches cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of a vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness.”
him!” Gary set another three pints on the bar-top, guessing rightly that they might do well with a refill.
, when he suddenly disappeared for a month and nine days. Judith spent more time than ever learning temporal spells, watched over by Stephen Strange. She wasn’t sure what was going to happen to Sherlock, but if she could keep him from doing something outrageous, she would be happy to do it blind-folded.
“Why?”
She looked into the back seat of her car as they arrived at the hospital. Getting through the gate separating the hospital from the street was simple and Greg warned them to be alert. So far as he was aware, they were the only Met presence at the hospital and he would try to keep it that way. “We’ll be in touch, yeah?”
“Not a clue. Haven’t heard anything.” He shrugged, “Trust me, if they’d snagged her, we would have heard about it.” One of the constables took a call on his radio and his eyebrows went up.
“Yes, I was.” The woman looked uncomfortable, “Tea?”
“You are
Seb sounded a bit tense, almost sad, if she had to put a word to it.
“Thank you so much, Mrs Hudson.”
“See you later, Locket!” Moriarty said cheerfully as he left Sherlock on his knees, hating himself, gone as quickly as he’d arrived. It wasn’t long before he heard footsteps again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because you had to find me like
“Thank God. Who?”
can’t, but I know someone who
“You know, I’m not sure. He’s in the government, minor position is what he says, but he spends too much time in Whitehall and Vauxhall Cross for that to be true.”
“Wait for him to strike again.” Mycroft came back from the kitchen, “You know he’s going to.”
“I forgave you a long time ago, Sherlock.” John pulled a tee-shirt over his head and smiled at Sherlock, “And really, I’m just glad you’re alive.”
“Here.” Came the reply from the bedroom that had been empty earlier. John just smiled and slid open the frosted-glass door.
“Disrespectful little brat.” He growled, bending his head to nip at the soft, pale skin. Sherlock just whined and John felt the sharp relief of fingernails digging into his shoulders. Thin, scarred fingers found their way into John’ hair and tightened.
“Oh, Q, did you have to?” He looked at the poor mannequin, blown to bits from the waist up.
“Yes! Please, please come in!” Sherlock let the stocky veteran into his house.
“Ask for Doctor Stamford when you get there. He knows Jude. He’ll make sure she’s well taken care of.” John said grimly. That was the last she heard of them, the door were shut and they got underway. She dozed off along the way, and didn’t wake up again for several hours.
After a surprisingly restful night’s sleep, John woke at his usual time and lay in bed for a minute longer before deciding he might as well start his day. He knew he had slept well just by the way he felt this morning, despite a few expected aches, and sat on the edge of the mattress, not missing how his feet didn’t quite reach the floor. It wasn’t that the bed was abnormally high, of course, John just happened to be a bit shorter than most men. It had never really bothered him, there were far bigger problems in the world, but he did take issue if someone made a point of bringing up his stature. Now, in his defence, living with someone so much taller than him was not a problem. He didn’t actually care about that, it didn’t
“Dimmock’s kid has the flu, apparently.”
“Yes’m.”
With Sherlock Holmes in tow, Judith walked out of her office for the last time, or one of the last times. She walked back to her barracks-room and went through her shelves and drawers, packing up everything into a few bags. She tossed uniform pieces into the bags, wondering what kind of future awaited her in London with Sherlock Holmes. While she packed, Sherlock stripped her bunk and stacked fresh linens on the mattress.
The Hound of Baskerville takes front and centre. It goes about as well as any case can, with the boys getting into plenty of trouble with the wrong sorts of people and out of it again with some help.
“I can, but I’m not going to, unless you ask me to.” She listened to his heartbeat, “You’re taking this well.”
“How?”
“I haven’t heard from them.” She narrowed her eyes, “I can find out fairly quickly, though.” She checked the time and sent a quick text to Robert’s phone. She’d had it for months, couldn’t remember when she’d gotten it or why he’d given it to her. What mattered right now is that she got a response from him.
He sounded a bit irate,
“Sir, if you’re willing, I’d be happy to accompany you back to the party. I have a couple of the lads on standby.”
“Yes.”
“What are you doing over here?” John had noticed his distraction, but he didn’t sound upset that he had been ignored, more like he was curious to know what had gotten Sherlock’s attention so completely.
like Jim Moriarty. Just as Sally pulled up the comparison-images, he caught sight of her car and came to a startled halt. Time to see if she was right about this. She stayed where she was and looked at the images Sally had pulled up.
“No, sir.” She shook her head, well-aware of the look Kendrick was giving her, “None at all.” The dark-haired one, the brother, snorted. These two weren't stupid. She narrowed her eyes and glanced sideways at Kendrick. Picking up on her reluctance to speak her mind, the dark-haired inspector turned to Kendrick.
“Just checking in.” He chuckled, remembering that conversation, “I guess they haven’t blown up Baker Street yet.”
He really wasn’t all that sure how long he had spent crying over Sherlock that first night. He just knew that he hadn’t returned to the Hounslow house for almost a week. It should have been a sign that something wasn’t quite right that Mary never called looking for him or really bothered to comfort him. When he finally did return home, she had asked, he had explained. Mary had declared that he would move on in time, he had a family to worry about. And now he wouldn’t be going back and forth from London so often.
“You were always the kindest child, John.” Alexandra smiled as she stroked her son’s hair and tilted his face so she could look at him properly, “Let me see you. Oh, you grew up so handsome.” Sherlock didn’t miss the way John blushed, even through his tears, and found it in himself to smile. Alexandra pulled her son against her, and as John settled into her embrace, she looked over his head at Sherlock and her smile grew a bit.
“That is Christopher Lachey. He’s Bexany Ranger’s father.”
“Early start, Holmes?”
“Oh, don’t worry, they’re not suffering for money too badly. He gets a pension every month from Mycroft out of the trust-fund until he turns thirty. Part of a deal they made in an attempt to get Sherlock clean.”
“Oh, I wish.” He rolled his eyes. “You know, there’s a good fucking reason your brother pulled me in.”
“Used to say somethin’ to the lot of ‘em, all the coppers.” The Homeless man raised his head and Sherlock finally got a look at his face. Slightly gaunt, pale, a short, trim beard of two months’ growth or so, thin wire-rim glasses, high-cut hair more grey than blonde from what he could see under a knit cap. The man wore a grey hoodie and ratty jeans, both were recently laundered but worn many, many times. Behind the glasses, his eyes were an alarming and intriguing blend of grey, brown, blue, and green.
“Oh! Yes, right! Of course!” Kendrick seemed a bit alarmed by the polite but blunt request, “Certainly! Just don’t let her talk out of turn, will you? That one’s got a mouth on her fit to burn a man if he’s not careful.” The unspoken “Don’t say do anything stupid.” was very clear. Judith clenched one hand in a fist behind her back and ground her teeth together, well-aware of the flush in her cheeks that didn’t come from the abominable heat of this hellish place.
It was quiet as they drove back to base, and she got Brook booked into holding. If anyone was surprised to see him, they didn’t say anything. Once Brook was secure, she went to help Sally book in a very confrontational Kitty Riley, who didn’t seem to realize or care how much trouble she was actually in.
“Allow me.” Sherlock just smiled, kissed him one last time, and made his way south again. John was a little ashamed that he wasn’t quite in top shape, middle age and parenthood had joined forces and conspired against him to keep him a bit softer in the middle than he generally liked.
“Jesus. How old was he?”
“Naah. You talk big. Naah.” Jim shook his head slowly, “You’re ordinary. You’re
“Those spots look like Dalmatian spots.” John handed the rendering to Sherlock, “She wants a Dalmatian coat and she’s stolen…what is it now, ninety-nine puppies to do it?”
With his window open just enough to let in a bit of breeze and the night-sounds of London, John fell asleep in a new bed in a new flat, and slept very well. He thought he heard something downstairs around two or three, but he couldn’t be arsed to go investigate. There were no explosions, the alarms didn’t go off, and there was no shouting. Just Sherlock up to whatever harmless nocturnal pursuits interested him, no doubt.
closely.” She shrugged and zipped up her hi-vis jacket over her SAB vest and fleece. Instead of the typical bowler hat, she wore a black knit-cap that did a better job of keeping her ears warm in the weather they were having.
“I live around here, I was on my way home.”
“Where you off to?”
“I pulled these yesterday before I left the office.” She looked up the stairs, “Sherlock! Got something for ya!”
“Was?”
to say it.
“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes. Uses a riding crop for it, I think.”
“You don’t have the time or resources to look after me all the time, Mycroft, I can take care of myself.”
“Well, he knows what he’s talking about, and ... he’s not rude about it?”
“Ah, and you couldn’t bear to be anywhere else. That’s not the John Watson I know.”
?!” Judith straightened, “Which direction?”
“Be careful with that, please.”
Serbian
“If I felt like giving someone a heart attack? Maybe!” John set his fork down to take a sip of his tea.  Mycroft just gave him a look that usually meant some sort of trouble. Not for him, specifically, but for someone else. He returned the look with a level, slightly disinterested one of his own. They were used to playing this game, it had just … been a while.
When Judith heard the sound of gunfire above them, she skidded to a halt and looked up. Grabbing her brother, she pulled him out of the way. They watched, horrified, as both Sherlock
“Well, I think that’ll do it, Molls. Sorry about the extra work.” Lestrade lifted the biro to double-check what he’d written already and nodded.
“Of course, yes.” A faint waiver, a sharp inhale, “Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.” Sherlock leant in until he could almost see himself reflected in John’s eyes, certainly in his glasses, and smirked.
Going upstairs, she peeked into the upstairs reception-room where Greg did paperwork sometimes. A fire burned low in the fireplace, and she smiled at the sight of her flat-mate passed out on the couch. Case-files littered the coffee-table and desk, and two empty beer-cans heralded how he’d gotten to where he was right now. Judith chuckled and went to stir the fire a bit. After she had banked the coals, Judith went over to the couch and stood over Greg, who slept half on his side, as if he’d fallen over from a sitting position. He probably had. Shaking her head, she reached down and woke him up.
“How did you…know about Afghanistan?” A hint of defiance, a flash of the old John Watson. What in God’s name had happened to him?
“Always a few trusted partners on the outside you can turn to.” His smile was soft, wistful almost. If she had to put a word to it, wistful was a good one. Judith tugged on the collar of his surcoat and pulled him down until they were a breath apart.
“That was quick.” Sherlock seemed impressed by the speedy response.
“Maybe.” He scrubbed out the dog-end of the cigarette and tossed it onto the wet sand below as Greg came up, “Let’s go. And don’t say anything to Greg.”
“Are you sure, sir?”
“Something like that.”
“Did John tell you?”
“Bexany Ranger?”
“For what?”
“Hold up.”
“Oh. Well, I don’t know what we can possibly tell you, but you might as well come in.” She invited them into the house and closed the door behind them, “I’m sorry that Roger and Anita aren’t here.”
“Not precisely.” Q shrugged as he held the door for John. The Quartermaster went beyond seeing him out of the division and walked with him to the car-park. There, he discovered that Q was hell-bent on spoiling him before he bid Section Six farewell.
“Well done, Q!” John patted Q on the shoulder, “But I thought Q-Branch didn’t go for that anymore?”
“Making trouble, or getting into it.” Moriarty chuckled, “No, no, don’t worry about us.”
“Not interested in better.” She reached up and ruffled his hair, still damp from the shower, “Not even close to interested in better. Too much to like here. Ah, there’s a smile.” She’d gotten a slight grin out of him. He snorted, which turned into a snicker, into a chuckle.
from?!”
“Oh my god! Really?!” Greg was shocked, that was serious, “That’s…terrible!”
“What?” He gasped, effectively startled.
She looked at the unusual gathering of people in the room.
decisions now!”
“I take it he hasn’t followed the family business?”
She demanded.
“Hmm?”
.” Judith eyed the glowing portal.
She made a face,
. But one thing she insisted on, even though they were away from London, was their morning routine. It was glorious to run to the top of Great Hill and Gorda Peak to watch the sunrise, even though trail-running was quite a bit different from what they were used to, they adapted quickly. There was a certain tranquillity to the way of things on the island, and he wasn’t really looking forward to returning to the madness of London.
“Not that I had any idea at the time.” John looked at Mycroft, who just smiled. “All I knew was that the pompous government lackey had gotten himself captured on my watch and it was going to be a
“There’s a name no-one says, an’ I’m not gonna say it either.” Sheer defiance, not that Sherlock had expected anything else, “Now, enough chatter.”
“Really, what do you think? Can you beat me?”
“Yes, Detective?”
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean he gets to take off with evidence from a crime-scene without saying anything.” Greg narrowed his eyes, “You’re driving.”
Returning to Dartmoor the following afternoon, she caught up with John and Sherlock laying out their plans with Greg to find out once and for all what was running around the moors after dark. Those plans were cut a bit short when Doctor Mortimer called in a panic to tell them that Henry Knight had taken his pistol and disappeared. She was afraid he was going to try to kill himself or someone else. They tracked Henry to Dewer’s Hollow, where they managed to talk him down from killing himself, but found themselves in serious trouble when the Hound appeared to them.
“What about London Sanctum? Kaecilius destroyed it.”
“Hello? Met Police, is anyone here?” Getting no response, and feeling very much like this was some weird out-of-body experience, Judith climbed the impressive staircase that led to the first floor. She still didn’t encounter anyone, but this house reminded her of a museum. A very
“Not today. These are the same people that tore you to shreds three years ago and killed my reputation, I don’t want to come across as “friendly” today.” John flicked a piece of lint from his smock and brushed off the buckle of the stable-belt secured at his waist. For the occasion of showing themselves to the world publicly for the first time in three years, John had found a new, properly fitted and starched Temperate Combat Dress uniform hanging in his closet and suspected he should be grateful Mycroft hadn’t insisted on a dress-uniform. He hadn’t worn a uniform for much since leaving the Army, maybe a couple of cases when they got themselves involved with a military case and it was prudent to blend or on special occasions, but it felt a bit strange just at the moment.
about visiting Saint Bart’s.
“What? What is it?”
“But…Jude, we can’t control temporal magic like that!” John wiped tears from his cheek, leaving a streak of red against his skin.
“Oh. Thank you, Mrs Hudson.” He wasn’t sure what made her think they
“Yeah, I was.” John made a face. “Six years ago.”
“You’re a cat-person, Sherlock?”
“Doctor Watson! Is it true that Sherlock Holmes is alive? That he was never actually
“Wait, who’s this? What’s he doing here?”
As soon as it was only the three of them in their train-car, and they were underway again, she waited for answers. The dark-haired business-man, if that’s what he was, just smiled at her. It was an alarmingly friendly smile, very pleasant and open.
“Thirsty boy, Locket?” Moriarty raised an eyebrow over his wine-glass.
“I was wearing a red vest under my uniform, most of the medics did, and it wasn’t really obvious under the shirt and two more layers of clothing and an armour vest that I was actively and profusely bleeding.”

“Was it Timo?”
the alcohol. This was something else, something bigger. Judith stood in the doorway, observing. There had been something a bit off about him most of the week, even her brother had noticed when they worked cases together. And Greg had been calling them on more cases over the last six days than in the past month alone. Most of them were solved within an hour or less of handing the files over, but even Sherlock had noticed something wasn’t quite on with the DI, and was nice about his deductions. Judith sighed and pushed away from the door.
When they paused on Earls Court Road to catch their breath, the smell of hot food tickled his nose and Greg leaned his head back. “How many miles was that?”

“And you would not be too far wrong, Mrs Hudson.” Sherlock sighed. “Just…not
like his drinking.”
“Really, all you’d have to do is give ‘em that look and they’d behave, I think,” Stamford said with a chuckle.
“Right. Go-time.” He muttered and crossed the street. Getting into the parking garage was simple, and he followed Sherlock carefully. He was far enough behind that by the time he caught
know John’s not as stupid as he likes to play.”
“Yes, how did...”
where!” Greg tapped glasses with him, drained his, and got to his feet. John showed him on a map roughly where he’d seen the lights out on the moor. While Greg went in search of flashing lights, John went to charm Louise Mortimer. With any luck,
“Thirty-four, with…how many years of service to the British Army? Fifteen years? You were seventeen when you entered service, weren’t you?”
“Yes, actually, and no. Absolutely not.” Sherlock was prepared to blow her off, despite the well-aimed barb.
“Oh no! Oh that’s worse! That’s terrible! I am so sorry!”
“And there’s the bit of you that screams Holmes to me.” He rolled his eyes, “You know, you don’t
“Yes, sir. Holmes and Watson. Picked up this case two months ago and followed it here.”
“Stay…forever.”
“Solve this and I’ll keep you in cold-case work for six months, Sherlock.” She muttered, jingling her keys irritably. Her irritation was short-lived as she felt a tug on her boot-laces and tiny, sharp claws digging into her combat-trousers.
“Sure.” He knew Lestrade was trying to change the subject, knew why, and let him. Another round was promptly ordered, Lestrade paid for this one. The conversation moved on from how John and Mycroft had met to how Lestrade and Mycroft had met, which was a far more entertaining story.
“Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.”
O, athraichean, rachamaid sios,
When Mycroft Holmes arrived at Maroush Edgeware Road, he was only coming for one reason. At the moment, he was alone, but he knew better than to think it would remain that way for the evening and had reserved a table for himself and any one of a small circle of friends and acquaintances who would trickle in over the course of the next several hours as their work-schedules allowed. He shook the rain from his coat and umbrella, passing both off to a waiting server, who disappeared after handing him a ticket, which he put in his pocket as he looked around. The current number came to its end as he took his seat. As another song began, he paid attention to the dancers. They were all very pretty and of all body-types and racial heritage. They got along, he knew by the way they moved together among the tables.
She signed off and accessed her shift-logs, remotely clocking out with several hours of overtime on her chart for tonight.
“John?”
“I’m all ears if you think you have something worth my time.” He took a bite of his starter, which was delicious.
“Is your hair...
“Didn’t think so. And I
“Don’t you even think about it, you fuzzy little menace.” He muttered. Mrs Hudson came upstairs a few minutes later with a stack of papers for John, accepting the cup of tea he handed her in exchange.
“Right, that.” He let out a slow breath, “So,
“The lads picked you out, John, I
“Second trailer on the right, back of the lot.” She rubbed her nose, “I’ll figure out what to do with the kittens later.”
“Who’d sponsor a serial killer?”
“Very well, Mr Holmes.” Another notation was made and Bryan gave them a smile. “I’ll get your drinks in! Shall I bring bread for the table?”
“Uh, just…coffee I think, Mary. Ta.”
people?” Judith leaned forward against the table, “You have a sponsor.”
She heard footsteps to her right and felt Moran nudge her in the side,
“I know you’ve got a brother, but you’re not on speaking terms with him. Your decision or his?”
“Oh?”
“I don’t care. You can’t do that without warning someone!”
“Hmm, yes, that did occur to me.” That smile slipped a bit into something more genuine, “And in your division particularly. Do you take issue with inspectors, Captain Watson?” Ah, he preferred to address her as “Captain”, not “Doctor”. A bit of respect she didn’t get very often, she appreciated the courtesy.
“So, you ... uh, you put this kid in irons and stash him in the back of somebody’s car while you try to find a point of contact because he won’t stop carrying on about how you’re going after the wrong person and instead of the apparent suspect, it’s
“Well, that’s interesting.”
“Lycan.”
“He’s about to get a really nasty surprise.”
“Of all the places and all the people in the world, Saint Bart’s Hospital and you.” Greg had to shake his head in wonder. “From medicine to magic. What a trip!”
“Bloody mind-reader. Don’t do that, Sherlock, not nice.” She rolled her eyes at him, “Where do you expect me to sleep? Upstairs in John’s old room?”
“You were in Pakistan on a surveillance mission, you must have been. Just keep eyes on, but licensed to act if necessary.” He remembered that particular mission of his, and the constant nagging feeling that he was being followed. But he had never noticed anything out of the ordinary or managed to make his tail. There had been one or two times he’d
“I would say I’m sorry, but that would be a lie. I do apologize for embarrassing you, however.”
“A bit behind, actually, until tonight.” She shrugged, “We haven’t gone public with the theory, there’s enough concern on the streets without us actually saying the words.”
“What’s going on?”
. He would be just fine friends-only with the handsome young detective, but John would be lying to himself if he said he wasn’t
“Mm. Even the smartest detectives need help.” She smiled and rocked on her heels while another wave passed.
“Jesus, sorry! You didn’t hit your head going down, did you?”
“You could have
“That one stormed out of here ten minutes ago without so much as a by your leave, could be anywhere in the building or in London,” John said carefully.
know that someone it didn’t approve of was coming up on their flank. He’d be an idiot in hell if he didn’t think the Watsons hadn’t already seen him. With one hand out as he would approach a stray, frightened dog, Greg came up alongside Strange, running his hand along the fabric of the cloak and smiling as it ruffled and settled calm again, wrapping around his hand for a minute. The damn thing
“Lucky
“Well, usually I’m not lucky enough to be on the receiving end of things like this.” She leaned against him, stretching up on tip-toe to steal another kiss. Not that Greg was
“Where?”
Taking a deep breath, and nearly a hundred-percent convinced the family knew she was coming, or at least someone was coming, Judith knocked on the door.
Sherlock shoved him further back, now holding him over the edge. Jim whooped almost triumphantly and gazed back at him with no fear in his eyes, holding his hands out wide and committing himself to Sherlock’s grasp. This man was completely mad!

“There’s Greg.” She murmured as they parked behind the BMW. Making sure she had her Browning and her handcuffs, she waited for Sally. They joined Greg, who looked like he hadn’t slept at all since the show-down at Baker Street, and approached the house.
“You’d be surprised.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t know who you are, or what’s on the other side of that…
“You heard me. Stay out of trouble while I’m gone, will you?”
“How did you…?”
Mycroft, all the man would admit to was handing over the letter of promotion written from somewhere inside MI6. John didn’t think James Bond had the pull to effect something this big, but M certainly did. Had their grandmother, who had always been there for them but had never stepped in on their lives unwanted or unasked for, finally gotten sick of sitting on the sidelines and done something about Judith’s career with The Met? God bless her if she had, that was a risky thing to do without warning any of them. Of course, John was intimately familiar with the level of outrageous miracles M and Mycroft were capable of pulling off both together and single-handedly.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson.” He would look through the contracts tomorrow, but he did take the time to read and sign the pet agreement for Kitty. Who had apparently decided that Sherlock was worth a second chance and wound between his feet, making soft noises and occasionally lifting her front paws off the floor to rub against him. For a while, he ignored her, but as John knew she would, she didn’t much like that and eventually took matters into her own paws and got up on her back legs, front paws resting on Sherlock’s left knee. She looked right at him and made a loud noise to get his attention.
“While we were on vacation. He didn’t plan it at all, really, but it was the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen him do. He went for so long married to a woman who didn’t love him, and the divorce almost ruined him.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” He asked in what he hoped was a conversational tone of voice.
A bit of OOCness, but I think I can be forgiven. Yes, I made Strange a bit of a flirt, but I am NOT sorry! If Judith Watson can pull anyone she wants, who's to say Strange can't do likewise?
At one point, he caught her eye and hefted the bag with her change of clothes in it. She brightened up and excused herself from the cluster of students she had been chatting with. He kept his left hand in his pocket as he passed the bag to her.
“Good night, Mr Moriarty!” He called politely.
“Well, that’s just it, then, isn’t it?” Mycroft shook his head and looked at the image frozen on his screen, unable to help a smile. “I suppose I shall have to once again get him out of difficulties.” He would give John a few hours to cool his head before springing him from Holding, and wondered for a moment if his husband had even recognized John. The two had met once, years ago, but he wasn’t certain if either had recognized the other tonight. Not likely, judging by the footage.
“Have a
“I’m fine.” She whispered as Greg continued tugging at the jacket and vest. It was hard for him to catch his breath. He’d seen the worst of his nightmares tonight, and they had somehow survived the madness.
“Why?”
““The Science of Deduction.” Now
“Who are you? What do you do?”
“That explains why you weren’t bothered by the blood. You just left a war-zone, for Christ’s sake!”
“Oh. Interesting.” The cabbie looked at the pill with interest but his voice gave nothing away as he spoke. Well, nothing a
“Everything good out here?”
“It pays the bills and keeps me off the streets. I’m too honest.”
“Yes.” She waved dismally at the room they were in, “Obviously? I’m not here for fun.”
“Yeah, figured I might as well own up to the name I was born with and give my bitch of a mother the middle finger at the same time.” John shrugged, “It’s good to see you, Seb. It’s been too long.”
When they reached the residence kept by DeVil out in Hampstead Heath, they joined a small army of Met personnel. DeVil, as suspected, was

“No, I don’t suppose she would be.” Mrs Hudson shrugged, “I do like her, so she is quite welcome to come back any time.”
“Do you need them?” She blinked. He pointed at the bomb-vest and parka. She sighed, wishing her hands weren’t shaking.
“It’s alright, Mama.” She sighed, “Just getting my head on straight.” She looked over at the fence surrounding the build-site, “Wonder if I’ll find anything in there, yeah?” Shrugging, she put the mother back in the box, cracked her windows, and locked her car while she went back into the build-site to see if she could find anything.
After a late lunch, Judith said goodbye to Christine, who had to go back to work, and spent the rest of her afternoon with Stephen. They visited Kamar-Taj and practised a bit, Stephen worked her on temporal spells. The manipulation of time could be very handy in certain circumstances, as they had seen at Hong Kong, but he did tell her to feel free to call on him if she didn’t feel comfortable executing a spell like that on her own. And it was the kind of spell she would only know if it had worked when she executed it. She was afraid to practice that kind of spell without a reason to do so. It was a kind of magic she wasn’t comfortable using, especially without the Time Stone, and generally steered away from any practice of it without the guidance of a Master.
