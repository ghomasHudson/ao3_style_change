With slow moves, John tilted his head forward, his chin almost over his chest, he smiled against his will, he suddenly felt the urge to laugh out loud, he was nervous as hell, his mind running through every possible scenario with the man behind him. But then he felt Sherlock's hands trembling against his chest, those hands, the ones that were so secure, the hands that held chemical supplies in the most delicate way, those were the hands that were shaking. But at the same time, the touch over his chest was secure, manly, with the faintest of pressures.
John smirked and nodded silently, eyes fixed in the detective who looked for a couple of seconds like a little, lost child. The expression in Sherlock's eyes – not the rest of his face – was pretty similar to the one he had that time in the pool. John's stomach had a knot inside as he remembered and looked around the lab trying to distract himself. When his gaze landed on Sherlock's face again the detective was completely composed, his face and eyes back to the normal emptiness that it had held before and John, the good doctor, felt this inexplicable rage inside him again.
He wrapped himself back in the sheet and took a newspaper.
', but he couldn't. He knew what Sherlock meant. He just... knew. There was no possible way he would be mad about it. Following his example, John took another piece of cloth he had in the bowl and cleaned Sherlock's jaw, right below his ear, with hard movements. There was a disturbing little spot of red lipstick there. Sherlock's brows darted up, but he let John do that.
"Sherlock." John heard panting at the other side of the phone, he quickly supported himself on an elbow, frowning. "What is it, everything okay?"
He walked quietly from one side of the room to the other, his military training never lost, noticing how the curtains moved when he passed close to them. He walked to the opposite corner of the room, in which he found five medium-sized boxes of a brand he had seen before - but couldn’t recall where - and a convenient hiding spot behind them just in case.
“Bathroom.”

"Ah, that one... yeah, I was running with a bloke over my shoulders and a bomb exploded. I fell over that rock, it wasn't even that big but with the weight I got that scar."
Click.
“Mr Holmes…” She made a pause, gave a short laugh and a sigh. “I never thought you… I mean… I never thought it was going to be case-related, so I…”
Molly had to step out from her trance. Sherlock was fascinating to look at; his quick movements, his eyes which never looked where she wanted them to, his lips that moved in a lovely way as he spoke.
he snapped at himself mentally
John eyed Jack quickly but his eyes moved automatically to look over at Sherlock again. He and the young woman were dangerously close. She even had tilted her face in front of him, with an adoring expression. His eyes were still locked on hers. She had placed the margarita on the table, now her hand was grabbing Sherlock's scarf; her other hand was still nailing his jaw. Her thumbnail ghosted over Sherlock's lower lip, but he never stopped his talking.

John stood up and walked to the detective who just lifted his glance to look at him. John was smiling. His smile didn't fade when he leaned towards Sherlock's face. The detective didn't change his expression, his lips parted slowly, welcoming the kiss. It was a soft kiss, John let his tongue dart into Sherlock's mouth, the doctor felt a strong grip behind his neck as Sherlock deepened the kiss, tilting his head, closing his eyes, moving his tongue along John's. It was the first kiss after all of that, and John couldn't help the desire to wash over him, like a cold fire growing inside his chest. He felt Sherlock moving his hand to his waist, a silent question to which John answered placing his hand above Sherlock's, sliding it up until it was pressing against his racing heart, his other hand moved behind Sherlock's neck, it crawled under the collar of his shirt.
, " he pointed to the card Sherlock was playing with between his fingers "is my member card, it has my number."
Instead, he took the empty cups and moved them away to fill the kettle and put it back on. Sherlock’s breathing was far from hyperventilation, so John stayed with his back to him as he fixed chamomile and honey for Sherlock and waited for his breathing to go back to normal.
to calm down.
"What do you mean, John. Everything I do is completely necessary." Sherlock turned the telly on, flipped through the channels, sulking again.
"You go first, Sherlock. Why did Lestrade need you in the Yard? You said something about a black market's…?"
Laughs again. "Seriously, you can't sit down?" John asked still with a smile, still convulsing with laughter. Sherlock just glared humorously at him.
Sherlock's smell, hands, warmth...
"I presume you're aware why I called you here today..."
"What!" Sherlock was already by the exit door when a young lady entered the room with a folder in her hands searching for Lestrade.
“Ah? No, I’m pretty sure
“I think I do, let me check! Come in,” she said as she went into her kitchen, John following and nearly throwing himself on the chair next to the door. “How was the rest of your day?”
John breathed through his nose a few times and closed the distance he had previously put between them. He was aware he must look as if he was mad or angry, but he was counting on Sherlock to notice how nervous he was and how this was - as he was learning to recognise - his default response to a stressful situation. He swallowed hard, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s.
John moved both of his hands to Sherlock’s chest; the heartbeat he found there was so fast it was a bit alarming. They were so close together they were sweating and their hips had found a rhythm so natural it was almost like a dance against the table.
The twitch of his penis did move the precariously placed towel, this time. The head was left exposed to the room.
"Armand."
“Oh,” Sherlock muttered. Several seconds of silence followed again.
"She burned the drug, obviously. Else that wouldn't have been fun." He answered with a shrug.
John snorted. “I appreciate the offer but no, I have had enough of that these past few days.” He thought for a while and then asked, “What about the products, though? I am looking for that cannabis soother, is it legal?”
"Show me your arm again, Sherlock... it seemed better so now I will just clean it and-"
He tried the table first, his nose inches from where he and John had been the morning before. He waited for a few moments trying very hard not to think about yesterday’s activities. He sat down and thought about the chemical components of aloe, of possible products he could make with a leaf and calculating quantities and components.
"Yeah. The alley's stuff." John never lifted his eyes off his food, moving it with his fork. He heard Sherlock clearing his throat. Obviously, it was the first time for Sherlock being in this situation:
He took it and saw the facility planes, the dates John had wrote down that time, his suspicions were confirmed. "So it was a set up."
Sherlock lifted his brows. "No, I'm fine." He said stopping, his face completely deadpan. John did his best not to show any emotions on his face or to burst into laughter right there.
"John! You are home early." Sherlock stated casually, not bothering about lifting his eyes from the screen.
"No... no... I just wanted to ask you something."
"Does it bother you?"
None of them wanted to break the silence and that strange intimate moment. In the flat only their breathings were heard at the proximity and some of the noises from the street.
“I’m going to serve that tea,” he murmured walking back to the kitchen; Sherlock could hear the smile on his face.
"About what?" Sherlock sipped his cup, never changing his expression.
prohibited in Europe in the ’40s.”
And he needed Mycroft. Financially, conveniently and, even if he didn't want to admit it, emotionally. His last name being a big advantage for him, bringing so many upside downs to Mycroft's life as he
“It’s fine.” John saw Sherlock taking the shirt from the table and putting it back on quickly. John thought about stopping him, but it was way too much now, so he let him. John was rooted to the spot, he couldn’t get up if his life depended on it. The scars weren’t extremely dreadful but it was the story John could see in there the first time all those years ago; a story of torture, infection, neglect.
“She’s the oldest of four brothers. What else would you expect?” Sherlock smirked, also fully himself now, the pitch of his voice lowering. John would never stop at being amazed by that. He dropped his voice to a whisper and added, “But I think she’s getting suspicious.”
' moved and was replaced by several others, not one of them being more important than the other.
“Oh, boys!” Abby returned with green tea oil and other supplies in a basket and handed them to John. “You’re making me blush, here,” She turned to John. “Are you on schedule?”
As Sherlock spoke, John observed his lips in trance; his cupid bow made a lovely shape when saying
"I thought you said you didn't have an ongoing case..."
Sherlock frowned at this and John cleared his throat. They both snickered and Sherlock asked, “Are there any special products for these… services?”
Sherlock clenched his jaw, "he was a good ally, I know nothing about him now though." He couldn't help a little sad tone under his voice, down casting as the words left his lips.
kind of expression. The detective continued, turning to Lestrade now, "… of course, that wouldn't have been much for the old man's heart, but the little amount of heroin helped to build the scenario we all already know."
"What are you doing?"
"Aw... you lovely little bald thing, I do need you. I don't like getting my hands dirty and since you're used to it, we can have our little share, I get Sherlock, you get Mycroft. It's fair, don't you think?" There was a pause, none of them talked until James cut the silence again. "Do you have everything ready? Remember you have to convince Rufus to let Sherlock to look after his boys."
"No, that would be all... and Sherlock!" he stopped in his tracks just with the hand on the door handle, not looking back "You may use help from Doctor Watson if you like, but don't let him write about it... everybody here knows about the blog. Don't let him write about the Netherland case either."
After a couple of minutes, a girl was coming his way. Sherlock didn't realise until she was almost over him. She was on her late twenties; she wore a short, tight, leather mini skirt and a tight corset. The woman was beautiful, even Jack had his eyes fixed on her as she danced her way to Sherlock's table, following the beat of the loud music. She had a margarita in her right hand, dark hair waving around her. A large amount of skin was exposed below her neck; bare shoulders and almost bare chest.
, yes. Two previous cases. The first was documented in 2008 and the second in 2010, both in America,” Sherlock checked his phone. “We are leaving in an hour.”
There were scrambled eggs and bacon, orange juice, toasts, tea, coffee... half of the table was completely in order, and the other half had all of Sherlock's experimentation devices. And a few meters farther, there was Armand, sitting in the same chair he was last night, his elbows over his knees and his chin over his hands, staring intently to a deeply asleep Sherlock.
, since Sherlock was still wrapped in his sheet. He had informed John about an experiment he ran in the afternoon, but then avoided the topic the rest of the night. He also told him that he had been asking some cases' request from his mail, and had resolved three cases online. Everything was...
“I don’t see anything.”
100%. “Yes!” Craig whispered.
Sherlock swallowed silently a sudden lump he felt in his throat. Armand didn't miss this detail, but he ignored it, returning his attention to the detective and the doctor.
"Me."
"... a bit cockier than usual." He said tossing the phone back to Sherlock, who just caught it and saved it in his jacket's pocket.
"No, thank you." Armand sensed how, even if the last lines were friendly, the tone was completely different. "I am going to see Xavier", he added.
Rapidly shaking his head, Sherlock threw himself over the sofa, his torso bent further over the back of the furniture, as if looking for something there. John took the hint quickly and said, loudly enough for anyone there to listen, probably was Mrs. Hudson anyway.
Once alone in his office, Mycroft placed his head between his hands over his large desk. He needed something sweet, he was anxious. Diet forgotten, he opened one of his drawers and took a fine, expensive little chocolate wrapped in gold. The taste was bitter sweet and for some reason, it was a glimpse to the future. He knew what he had to do; he had to talk to John. At least if John was so protective with Sherlock, John
99%. “Come on, come on!” Craig was still chanting, like a prayer.
John’s face turned crimson but his eyes rested on Sherlock without hesitancy, he nodded. “I think I noticed.”
"Liar."
"The only rambling Lestrade was able to give me…" Sherlock supported his chin on his palm, his elbow on the table, fingertips tapping his upper lip... all of his posture suggested boredom. "At the end… all they had was ramble."
Mycroft clenched his jaw and lifted his brows tilting his head to the side a bit. "Three. Are we doing this again?"
"Really, John. Try to concentrate." Sherlock had to speak louder now if he wanted to be heard by John. Then he moved his teasing fingers in a slower way, "If you do, it can come really in handy. If there's any case of pain, for example, to be able to control your body with your mind. Breathe!"
"How...?"
"Oh, like the detective?" the man asked, and Sherlock scowled, confused. Soon he heard a little laugh at the other side of the phone "I read that blog, do you? Don't tell me... are you him?"
“Doctor Watson,” Martin said as he drove, looking at him in the rear-view mirror, “do you think you’re going to continue in the therapy business? I have a friend who is looking for a therapist. The payment is higher than Slaney’s was, and I assure you, it’s completely legal and no drugs are involved.”
When he had realized that fact this morning, after a lot of deep thoughts, and many rounds inside his palace, when all of the pieces finally fitted... Sherlock felt a stab right through his soul. There was no use for making the Queen – Mycroft – to fall, since the Queen alone never includes the jack mate. It was a privilege only meant for the king. He remembered the time when they were in Buckingham Palace; he said Mycroft was, apparently, the queen. He had disguised it as a joke, but his mind had come quickly to that because he always had seen things that way. Mycroft, being such a big part of the government, was finally what he represented, the very heart of the British nation: The Queen.
“Oh!” Recognition. Excellent. “Dr Watson is on duty at the moment. You’re a bit early.”
“How long?” Sherlock whispered, his eyes trained on the door. “Thirty seconds!” Craig answered as he wrote something on a black screen.
[General]
And in his head, John's image was glued as well as John's voice.
How long has it been since John had looked at him like that?
Instead, he just answered, his voice deep and a bit raw, “Everything’s okay.”
"Sorry to interrupt, boys..." Lestrade lifted his brows looking at John, who had closed his eyes and thinned his lips, in an attempt to regain his patience back. "I didn't know you had a fixation in your flatmate's sleeping habits!"
A text came into Sherlock's phone and his grin changed into a wide smirk.
The night had been a revelation to Sherlock; John had hugged him and he had hugged John back as if clinging for dear life… he even asked to stay in the same position for a little longer.
' Sherlock noticed how John tried to keep his voice calm and under control, but the desperation was obvious in it as well.
"Oh for God's sake, Sherl-" John breathed out, tired. "Shut the fuck up, will yah..."
"Why? Last night, what did you do?"
The noises downstairs were those of Mrs Hudson getting ready for the day, she was probably going to bring tea and check if they needed something else to eat.
John seemed indifferently; he kept on eating just eyeing Sherlock a couple of times. The detective knew John was paying attention anyway. Armand was still immobile. Sherlock was waiting for an answer from any of the two.
**..**
"Okay... can you promise to answer with the truth and nothing but the truth?"
"And that would be?"
"Yeah?"
"Good..." John cleared his throat since his voice didn't come out the way he wanted and repeated "... good thing we found a use for the lotion."
Sherlock got surprised how, even when he was aware of the ministrations of the younger man, he didn't feel anything. Of course he felt the hot lips, the hot breathing, the ticklish feeling on his ear, but nothing he could even compare to the data he held of sexual arousal. The touch was just a touch, the breathing was just a hot blow that could be easily compared to a hair dryer.
They walked then, chatting friendly and had dinner in an Italian ristorante for a change. Sherlock was trying to stay focused on the conversation. John was letting him know he had a shift in the hospital next week, they should stop by the store for milk, they were out of tea and… lots of flatmate's stuff. Sherlock's mind was elsewhere, though. Usually, when he needed to think, he found other people’s talking – or thinking – annoying... but John's voice lulled him, it encouraged him to keep going. He wanted to hear John's voice, so he kept on asking about the most trivial things, following the conversation.
A couple of months later, with the case solved, John sat in his armchair with his laptop over his knees, determined to write the final details about The Woman's case. It was only a little past ten in the morning and the fireplace was on in the living room.
“John, I think that -”
to be evaluated. No diabetes, no HIV, no glaucoma, no lupus and no hypertension… Hamish, can I count on you to follow through a patient evaluation? I know you wanted a break from medical treatments, but this is really important for us, one of our star-products. It is still a thing about aesthetic, though.”
John thought, he didn't want to bring Sherlock into the conversation.
Thanks to my lovely
made its way inside his skull somehow, but he discarded it quickly. The problem was, as soon as he hardly got rid of that thought, he heard the first word Sherlock's lips pronounced once he was awake. And the problem? Yes; he was delighted by it:
John startled, his heart skipped a beat. He lifted his head quickly and saw Sherlock staring at him with a curious expression. Their gazes locked; John's chest moved up and down in a steady rhythm, visibly flustered in contrast with Sherlock's calmed presence.
“You… brilliant man,” John said. Even in the dark, he could see Sherlock’s head snapping to frown at him in surprise and his mouth opening in a small and silent gasp.
At first on the roof top, he started to cry as usual; it was a fake cry, fake tears. It was easy actually, to make his voice tremble, to contort his face in pain, it was all incredibly easy, rehearsed.
"I have to decipher the code."
"John?" Sherlock didn't have to take his hand off of his eyes to know John was looking at him.
"Your data, John. I also wanted to try about the psychology books I read... the REM state..."
He cursed his own body that wasn't letting him have a good night's sleep. He stroked himself for a few seconds and stopped. He felt like an arse, almost as if he were defiling Sherlock's friendship. He almost felt as if he were imposing on the other man. Again, two voices were nagging inside his head; one telling him Sherlock was his friend and he shouldn't do this; it's not right to wank whilst thinking about your male best friend. The other telling him, to hell with it, who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but his body had needs and he might as well satisfy them.
"What about the girl… Amanda." The doctor asked trying to change the subject.
"Do it."
Sherlock shrugged in his mind.
There, at the inn, Sherlock had made clear John was his only friend. Even when John had been angry – and he had the right to be – he was incredibly happy. The feeling was mutual, and he knew it for sure at last. Now about the other feeling…
John moved to the other bicep and Sherlock felt as if John’s fingers burned his skin. John massaged dangerously close to his shoulder below the vest, his hands passing casually under the shirt with the circular movement he was using. Sherlock was completely tensed up and because of this, his arm looked muscular, masculine. He wondered if that did something for John. In his mind, Sholto immediately appeared, his defined and masculine body, the line of Sholto’s mouth right in front of John’s forehead as they spoke. The soft smile he had for John Watson. Were they ever close like this? Did John ever massage Sholto after a hard day of war? Just because he wanted, not under the pressure of a case?
After minutes and minutes of panting, Sherlock rolled over to his side.
"But we are still talking, aren't we?" The comment and the tenderness of his voice made John look up and stare into Sherlock's clear eyes. The white glow from the window at his right gave him a phantasmal aura; his eyes were too shiny and... he really had to stop staring.
"Am I?" John asked, surprised again at how soft and calmed his voice sounded, a little raspy though, "may I ask what the hell am I stimulating...? Is it your body, your mind?"
“Hargreave. Why would a man in his seventies care so much for a woman that’s not even his daughter? He left everything in the States to come here and protect her?”
John moved his hips against Sherlock’s, his own hardness pressing against the other’s hip. “Tell me.”
"Armand."
With still a firm grip, Sherlock rubbed his hands up and down all the way from John's shoulders to his elbows. John didn't know where to put his hands, but when he realized about them, they were clenching and relaxing at his sides in an absent nervous gesture.
"All of them."
They were panting hard but as the steps got closer, they both held their breaths. John saw over Sherlock's shoulder as the man searched frantically, when he saw nothing, he kept on running down the path they should have taken. After a couple of seconds, when they heard the steps getting farer away, John exhaled deeply and began to recover his breath as Sherlock did the same.
(See the end of the chapter for
– stopping the music abruptly. Armand got closer to the detective. There John noted Armand and Sherlock were almost the same height; Sherlock being taller for less than an inch. Why he noted such a detail, he didn't know. Armand's forehead could be placed right in front of Sherlock's brow. "We know the hot line company has three facilities, you gave a paper to John. Which one are you in?"
of informers, I can have mine as well, don't you agree?"
He smiled despite himself; this situation was...
"No, remember he has his doctor."
Another pause. "I don't."
Lestrade placed both laptops on the kitchen table and snorted at the detective and the resigned face of the doctor helping him out. He walked back to help John to put a talking Sherlock back in bed.
"No, no... it's okay, I just got here too early." Sherlock smiled at her. Molly never took her eyes out of Sherlock's. Deep inside, very deep inside, and not like she would acknowledge openly, she was waiting for him to look at her... to really look at her. She had hoped for him to stare at her exposed skin, she hoped for him to lower his glance from her eyes to other parts of her. She knew she was pretty, she knew, if Sherlock was any other man, she would surely have a chance with little effort.
But he wished it could be a process as simple as that, just to say
"Sherlock..." John couldn't help a surprised smile; he tried to catch how Sherlock had come to that conclusion. So that's what Mycroft was talking about. Why was it so hard to follow. "What about the homeless gang?"
not believe me. I suspected it at first, by observing how she talks about her daughter. Even though, these books are very clear. There are some parents blinded by the love they profess to their children. They won't believe anything out of place their child do, so in order to her to acknowledge it's her daughter, the girl has to tell her herself or... the mother has to see the proof with her own eyes. And! If she fits this profile..." Sherlock lifted a book with an open page and handed it to John, "...even that way, she still wouldn't believe me."
John was biting the inside of his cheek. He was clearly a bit nervous now, but apparently, he couldn’t take his eyes off Sherlock’s.
John ceased what he was doing and his jaw worked slowly as he lifted his eyes to Sherlock’s face and swallowed once. “Of course. Why wouldn’t we be?”
"Hm?" was all he managed as an answer.
John took his jacket off and moved closer to Sherlock, making the taller man face him, he carefully raised his hands around his neck and wrapped him in a tender hug.
He laughed at the outburst.
“Oh, my God, yes.” Her tone was tired. She stretched her back. “How often do you get massages for that?”
John's lips curved up and went down back just as quickly. He gulped the beer he ordered before Sherlock arrived.
"Look, they know the Yard called Sherlock Holmes, they need proofs we don't have. It's a tedious work to try to explain them how we knew the painting was there, it would mean that even the Yard could be involved since we were the only ones there and you know it's not quite true. And besides, the case about the facility can't be exposed to the Yard. Sherlock is the only proof we've got."
"My face hurts... do something 'boured." [My cheek hurts... do something about it.] Sherlock said. He was spilling out the words but it was still understandable.
"You okay?" the doctor questioned from the sofa after half an hour of imperturbable silence. He observed Sherlock, who just played with the item sitting on his usual chair.
Later in the privacy of his room, he clenched his fists and teeth so hard he thought he was going to break either a finger or a tooth.
"How could I! Inside a bloody cab! With an old... cabbie staring at us, getting off at our-!"
"Shh... John, just listen."
. And then another one – very polite – from Elsie asking him to please charge the fees of his work to her account and not Chloe’s. An apology was received two minutes later from the same number. A
"I uh…
"Right." It was John's turn to claim the shower.
His hand moved back to the front of his jeans, teasing the button as his eyes closed again, his now intense panting moistening his shirt; more and he would hyperventilate. He set the button free and was about to open his flies when he heard steps on the stairs, not John – impossible – and he had left the door to the flat open, like he always did when John was not home yet. His mind supplied three situations of immediate danger and Rosie was sleeping upstairs. His feet and instinct were faster than the reasoning that it would be pretty much awkward opening the door with all of the obvious signs of being caught in the middle of a wank.
"Now, I am supposed to get somewhat
"I am awake on the couch." John heard a throaty chuckle and soon he followed. Taking a little gulp of air, he continued.
They both laughed again.
"Yes, Greg brought them..." John saw how Mycroft lifted the device, stared at it for a while and then typed a few numbers, unlocking it. John's brows went up with surprise. Sherlock usually did the same when trying to figure out his laptop password. He saw how Mycroft browsed a couple of folders, then took his phone and sent over a couple of files by Bluetooth. He typed a few more things on the little computer and then shut it closed.
Sherlock woke up with a strangled sound coming from his throat, panting and gasping; his breath caught in his throat as his fine ear got the last bits of "Stayin' Alive", Bee Gees' version, coming in from the bedroom window. The neighbours, apparently, they loved the Bee Gees. He coughed and noticed he had his own hand wrapping his erection under the sheet.
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked over at John; the doctor was sleeping into a position Sherlock knew it was going to be hell for his back and neck later.
"It wasn't me… you know, she didn't try to get physical with me. It was…" Sherlock made a disgusted face, wrinkling his nose.
"Hello there!" the voice was friendly; it made Sherlock's frown disappear almost instantly. The voice wasn't deep but wasn't high either. It reminded Sherlock of those infomercials with a friendly man with a friendly, smiling voice, telling you to buy a product, not those deep voices, but definitely masculine. "What can I do for you?" he asked.
"So, you're the man that came today into our flat," Sherlock stated, staring at the guy and then looking somewhere else. He didn't miss the expression of adoration on the man's handsome features, "you're the man working at the hot line, you came today to present your case whilst I was gone... you're being chased by the company, because somehow they knew you talked with us. You should know, that people usually know where we live, so if you were planning in looking for shelter I wouldn't hold onto much hope."
"Sorry, do you have any tape?" he asked the waitress that brought his apple pie. He ate it to such speed that when she came back with it the plate was almost empty.
"In your mind palace... rrrright." John said, lifting a brow and furrowing his lips to a side. Sherlock looked at him with a light frown.
received at 12:05.
Louis took a deep breath; eyes fixed on the detective in front and asked with a strong voice "What?"
**..**
John didn’t move that much. He took a step back, seriously doubting his own intentions and disentangling his arms from Sherlock. There was a voice nagging at the back of his head telling him what if it was the aphrodisiac making him do all this, making him feel tachycardic and bothered? Because Sherlock’s sweat was making him crazy, he wanted to touch, to smell, to bite, to lick.
"That will do, as always, you're a big help Mr. Groundsel."
"I'm not." Sherlock said, closing his eyes and supporting his neck at the back of the sofa.
"Of course he is Armand."
John thought.
When they got to Angelo's, John noticed how the Italian man didn't tease him for being Sherlock's
as they ran escaping from the police. He recalled the security in Sherlock's eyes when they were at Miss Riley's house, waiting for her to appear to demand answers. He also recalled the fear, the terror in Sherlock's eyes when Moriarty said he was just an actor called Richard Brook hired by Sherlock to
"Good. Now I have a little DVD to record. Do you like fairy tales, Mr. Smith?"
"I could be doing that as well." John giggled, he found this situation amusing if not a little frustrating, infuriating, as the man himself; he didn't know if Sherlock was being serious, but he still wanted to play along. Sherlock had made his point there, though. "But I did notice how hard you were, in the alley." He couldn't just let this opportunity pass so easily.
Somehow, Sherlock's legs managed to stay in place, John's left one was bent on the knee and dangling from the sofa.
"John?" Sarah asked. She sat in front of him with her tray of food. He was with this stupid grin all over his face.
John smiled at that, he knew it was a bittersweet smile. Sherlock wasn’t looking at him.
"Thank you Mrs. Hudson," he repeated. "You're a saint."
“For the first time in my life.” Sherlock’s voice was soft against John’s neck. “I was really aware of another person's body, of another person's smell. We had… We have our arms around each other.” Sherlock tightened their embrace and pressed his face closer, if possible, to John’s neck. “It’s like holding some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird in my hand which I had miraculously happened to find. I am very frightened and I’m… I’m sure you’re frightened, too.” He moved his hips again, pressing his hardness against John’s hip once more.
He felt like throwing up. The figure speaking was now in front of him.
"I did it again." Sherlock's voice was shaking with emotion. John felt Sherlock's breath over his nose and could smell the beer they'd had before. There was something very intimate about the way Sherlock was speaking, but then again, there was a little sadness behind the words.
"Of course it is, John." He opened his eyes and added defiantly "Want to prove it?" John threw Sherlock a very grave expression and prepared to stand up.
After a couple of seconds of sweet self-torture, he brushed a bit more Sherlock's lips, giving a soft kiss over the detective's upper lip. He moved back a little and couldn't help a little sigh "Sherlock..."
"What do you mean, too much at stake?" John asked quietly as they walked.
"Well I am... aroused."
look like Elsie…” John frowned at the photos, and after a moment’s thought, his eyes sparked up. “Oh,” he said, “she has a stick man necklace, too…” he added, eyeing the picture of the kiss.
"No, no, let me finish. It was almost as if I was touching myself when I was touching you... your taste, your fluids-"
"But you know what the real problem is?" The voice echoed in the walls again, far from him. There were some steps circling him and he felt the weight of a finger at the top of his head; it felt exceptionally heavy, "the real problem is Sherlock, that you love him. You allowed yourself to open for him, and that my dear, will be your doom."
After last night, the detective had
"I'm sorry."
Sherlock collected samples here and there and walked around the apartment, his eyes taking in everything and his mind working full speed. Anderson waited outside with an exasperated expression whilst chatting with Sally. Lestrade eyed the pair, but his mind remained focused on Sherlock; the way he followed every smell, every trace on the carpet, and the mental notes the detective was muttering in the process.
"On the website, yes." John tossed his phone to his companion as he sat next to him. The detective immediately dialled the numbers the mysterious man gave him earlier. He called the hot line, feeling a little sense of déjà vu.
"No, I just deciphered the logic of the code when I was
"John and Sherlock."
Sighing, John tried to put a little order around the kitchen; lifting the cups Sherlock had left on different places and doing the dishes.
Sherlock nodded and walked outside.
"Sherlock," John said, coughing silently, "if you want... when we get home I can check what's wrong with your spine. It wouldn't be surprising if we hear that ugly sound again. Especially if you were in that bloody lab all day long."
"Yes? I just hope it works for me as well, don't we?"
"You're making that up."

"Why, I'm just massaging your neck... you said yourself it was sore."
John sighed. He needed a glass of warm milk. After that, he would wake Sherlock up and make both of them go to sleep.
a change.”
"What are you imagining now, John?"
The DI explained to both of them about a couple vehicles they had found; they had no documents and the plate number was gone. The methods they had to find the owners were ineffective, erasing every trace of what was done in the vehicle or whom it had belonged to.
"Oh, nothing." John cleared his throat still with a grin and quickly took the last bite of his sandwich, to make time and think about a lie. Sarah still looked curious. "Just got a text... it's just a stupid comment about a case he's working on right now, nothing important."
It read “
“You’ll probably feel something later,” Sherlock started to say, trying to sound casual through his heavy breathing, his knees straightening up as if to put some distance between them with his full height. “But it’s not going to be so strong as this one. I told you my coat had some of the liquid, which was a concentrate. You probably inhaled or touched some of it in the car. It’s going to be-”
"Well, this is done, then." Sherlock said lifting himself from the leaning position on the other's doorframe.
He tried to move again, to lose himself from the grip, but his body was unresponsive.

"What." Sherlock asked with a comical frown.
"John..." Mycroft said quietly and John's expression deepened. The man in front sighed and placed both arms in the armrests of the chair. He threw his head back and sighed again.
John saw when Sherlock's lips stopped moving and thinned. He was waiting. She started to move back, slowly, she withdrew her foot from Sherlock's thigh – she had moved it very close to his private area – and she also released the scarf. She took her margarita and stood up, looking down at Sherlock who now was looking at John, an indescribable look on his face. His
"My body... doesn't follow my mind's commands when I'm with you. I think I'm going to lose control. I've never before..."
John sighed then, since he really needed this night out, needed to clear his mind. Away from 221b. Away from Sherlock.
"Save it, Greg. Meet me in one hour. 221B, Baker Street." John hung up, still this smirk on his face.
"Imagine now... my lips touching your neck delicately. I am going to kiss you there, going to

Ever loyal, Louis had just smiled and nodded before getting lost with his gang.
“I start tomorrow, they uh… they’ll give me a small induction in the morning and we open at three.”
“Let’s see,” Mrs Hudson showed no signs of wanting to get up from John’s chair. “I take five slides and hide them before passing them to John. I ask for a green tea-based antioxidant massage for my feet. Then I leave the slides with Jo-" Sherlock frowned in warning. "Hamish.”
"No... no, it's not that." Sherlock didn't have to fake anything here, he remembered all of those nights when he really
There was no need for more words, John noticed how his own breathing was hard now, but he was also silent. He felt Sherlock taking his hand out of his erection, his fingers squeezing his, both hands being washed with the spray of water above them.
“Ah. No. That’s settled. Never again.”
"John."
With a frown, Mycroft took his phone, he browsed a couple of files and placed it over the desk, the screen glowing white. "See for yourself."
"He killed for you the second day, you know..." the psychotic tone of voice from earlier was now replaced with a lower, calmer one, "are you familiar with that sensation, Sherlock? Have you ever killed anyone?"
"Whatever you want to do to me is fine, John." Sherlock felt something in his stomach as soon as the name escaped his lips.
“Well, you were right,” John said, taking cups of tea, empty trays and everything back to the kitchen. “She
"Are you sure..." Sherlock insisted in the same tone "I was told this was the best hot line 'cause you have all sort of... kinky fantasies..." John was open mouthed. There were some words that coming from Sherlock's lips sounded incredibly awkward.
"No, no... You're right. I've been willing to say that too, but you know... I'm a lady." She eyed the place and whispered. "But that
“You are thinking really hard,” Sherlock said, completely ignoring how a simple word caused him to blush. He placed his hands on the table behind him for support. John didn’t say anything but took off his jumper and threw it on Sherlock’s pile of clothes. He looked at Sherlock almost defiantly. He was panting a bit, his body trying to catch up with the drumming of his heart.
“Sometimes I miss your music.”
"I can't reach to any conclusion." Sherlock said and smiled at the worried face of the man. "I need him at the police station, he has no ID. My name can't be involved."
"That's happening to you a lot lately." She stated looking at him, he lifted his gaze and they both smiled. "Is this about your flatmate again?"

needed to sleep.
"Yes. Your seminal liquid, it tastes-"
Mycroft walked to the door, giving one last quick look to John and then he concentrated on his brother, who maintained the same position. "Now, as a brother, Sherlock: take care of yourself. Abandon the case, let the Yard do their job. Forget it, Sherlock. No spaces." Giving one last nod to both of them, he stepped outside and closed the door.

After a couple of seconds, John felt a known heaviness on his lap and he allowed his hands to rest over the new welcomed weight over his thighs. This time, he found curls around his fingers and he noticed Sherlock had switched his position. John was taken aback by his companion's unusual action, but he was almost sleeping now, so he just restrained himself to stroke the soft hair with his right hand, and rested the left one someplace over Sherlock's chest. Last thing he heard was a soft groan, a whisper forming his name and then chilly fingers over his left hand.
The way it was said was a painfully, throaty moan. That single word echoed the room and into his stomach, going dangerously down his belly.
There was something about John’s voice that clearly affected Sherlock’s erection a bit more, since he had gone from partially to fully erect in two minutes, if the countdown on the screen was to be believed.
"Oh." Sherlock moved quickly and walked to the bathroom, taking one of the messy sheets and throwing it over his shoulders.
"Don't. Turn."
Lestrade hung up and mentally prepared himself to enter the room and find... whatever he was going to find. But he stopped with his hand resting on the door handle.
"It's alright Sherlock." John showed him the cloth with a faint stain of red, Sherlock smiled. "Please. It's alright. I
Sherlock just sighed and chuckled lowly and shortly, it reminded Armand to those antagonists of the kid's movies. "Oh... John and his blog..." the detective added in a husky tone.
"You did?" Sherlock asked in disbelief.
Shaking a bit his head, Lestrade took his phone from his pocket and dialled, sighing deeply as he waited to the other person on the line.
"Yes... Armand?"
His lips clenched and his frown went down but soon his expression changed, his lips curved in a smile, he bit the lower one childishly and his eyes smiled. "We're doing it."
"Maybe the word you're looking for is romantic, idealistic..."
Last night John was feeling devastated. Of course, Sherlock never failed in comforting him, on his own way. Just being next to the detective was good and enough. He knew that.
With a sigh, Sherlock found himself going slowly to the doctor's room. There was no snoring and Sherlock smiled, finally putting his thoughts about Mycroft, Moriarty and the case aside. At least trying to, as his mind focused completely on the soft breathing inside John's room.
he was frightened too, and we shut our eyes."
“Shut up,” he said through a mouthful of sandwich.
, Sherlock... I've gone through things you can't even fathom to imagine. You have no idea of what I used to dream of, no idea of what I wanted..."
“Hold still.” Sherlock took Martin’s wrist from John’s hand and rubbed the slide around Martin’s palm like putting butter onto a piece of bread. John sat back down to look at the process. Martin’s eyes were glued to the concentrated face inches from his own, but flicking back to the scientific process that was going on around his and Sherlock’s hands.
Martin nodded with a fake pout, but still in very good spirits. “I see. Okay. If you ever change your mind, though…” And he winked. John noticed because the door of the microwave had a reflection, of course he was going to see it. He also saw Sherlock smiling and wanted to make gag noises.
He sat on a bench next to a very large tree, supported his elbows on his knees and stretched his back a little, moving his shoulder blades forward, a little groan escaping his throat as he did that. A homeless sat at the other corner of the bench, completely covered in a blanket.
John didn't want to ask about the case but Amanda, yet it seemed it had something to do with it, so he followed the proper order of things. Sherlock stood in front of him, not as close as before, but close enough so they could hear each other over the street noise without yelling.
"Indeed..." Mycroft's voice was calmed and slow, Sherlock listened patiently.
He wanted to say thank you, but it was not even close to enough. He needed to give Sherlock something back for now. He wanted to ease that insecurity he had learnt to detect. He schooled his face to neutral when he noticed how deep of a frown he was sporting.
"We can't know if we have to go out in the middle of the night." He said browsing something on the internet.
’ Because even in his Mental Palace he liked to exasperate his brother (the
Sherlock nodded as well and continued, "Well, he started his politics career when he was very young, so I guess he was a good prospect. I used to look up at him. One day, I entered the living room in our house and there was this girl all over him. He was almost giving in."
Why was he like this? He couldn't explain. He remembered the nightmare, the words...
to talk about it with Sherlock than the other Holmes...
“We wait.” Sherlock stood up and stretched his spine and his arms above his head. “We need to see who is poisoning Hilton. She wants to know if Elsie is doing anything differently but she doesn’t want to suspect her partner.”
Those last days had been odd; he allowed his mind go through a few moments shared with Sherlock after the case that kept repeating in his head;
if her own partner hasn’t noticed…”
. Detective Inspector Lestrade had come in to take the notebooks away, just after Sherlock had changed the password to both of them.
"Come... John!" Sherlock growled out as he moved his finger further, pressing John's entrance, never stopping the movement of his hips.
"Oh."
"So, you can't imagine me, John, with anyone? You think I'm incapable of any kind of sexual activity?"
It took him a while to catch his breath. He felt heavy, his eyes and mind were shutting down inevitably. Carelessly, he wiped himself with the sheet and just threw a duvet back over him. All of his life, being so clean and correct, he could slip this once. His mind was racing, again. One rational part tried to talk aloud, but John shut it up with a pillow over his head.
John's eyes widened quickly, looking at the pale face above him with a surprised frown.
His eyes travelled further down, he noticed the height difference as Sherlock's ankles were much further away than his own, his knees were bending a bit, which probably caused John's left leg to fall from the sofa and his smile just widened. Then he followed the detective's hand under his own jumper and the soft grip in his shirt.
, and was very well acclimatized to uncomfortable spaces... he didn't like the idea of being secluded in there, for who knows how long. Not in a confined space with Sherlock.
With a smirk for making his brother fall into a stupid childish game to distract him, he continued with what he wanted to ask "Doing what?"
“Lust and love are
Sherlock hesitated and then firmly said, “Mycroft, Anthea, my father, Mary. Rosie too, probably.”
In Christine's house, a couple of beeps could be heard from Sherlock's pocket. He just kept on talking to her, not paying attention to his phone.
"Dr. Watson!" he said in a whisper. He lifted himself from the chair carefully and walked to John, he entered the kitchen with a smile on his face "I'm really sorry, I took the liberty to make you guys breakfast... I spent the night on the couch. You guys have been so considerate..." he smiled embarrassed. "I went out and bought a couple of things..." he gestured to the table with his thumb over his shoulder, "I just didn't know how to repay you..."

"John..." Sherlock sat in the bed with a fast movement, taking John's hands in his and placing them over his chest. The heartbeat was crazy. John stared at his own hands feeling the muscles there. He was still, he didn't dare to move. Sherlock was waiting for him.
“Yep,” Sherlock leaned in his chair to point one of the names on the paper. “This one, it was the hallway camera, with this, the letters were, in order: A-R-D-E-I-P. Turn them and you get

Sherlock returned with the dummy, sitting it carefully on a chair. Mrs. Hudson grinned to it. "I'm glad you're experimenting on a dummy now," she waved her hand to the fridge. John laughed.
When John placed the cups aside, he saw Sherlock pacing to the couch. The detective lay down on his stomach and tried to get himself comfortable. He tossed a little and had a battle to death with a cushion. Apparently, he decided he couldn't get comfortable there, so he stood up and walked away.
"Wha- How- Again?"
"And so responsive! It's... amazing, really. You loved his face when he was coming, didn't you. His eyes closed..."
"Oh, so now he is Armand." John added with a surprised smile.
because it had more visits than his.
"Yes! A date; you and I. Problem?" Sherlock didn't wait for an answer and ran downstairs, leaving the door open, sure John would follow. The doctor stood still for a couple of seconds in the flat, his brows down and his lips furrowed to a side. But as predicted, soon he was following Sherlock, who was waiting for him outside. John noticed Sherlock's tone. It was
And the other option was to…
“Sherlock…”
"Seriously... next time, wake me up, yeah?"

“Hm?”
"I told you, Mycroft, I have nothing to do with the painting." An almost bald man spoke from a chair in front of the politician's desk.
“I want you to show them to me.” The words were out before John could control them. He saw how Sherlock’s eyes immediately focused on him – really
“Hm.”
"What?"
“Calm down, Watson!” That was Sherlock’s voice again. A pause and then, calmer, “He’s going to come up, let’s…” The rest of the sentence was lost again, and then, “Smell this, what do you think?”

"Sherlock, you're not obliged to do anything, there are no rules between us. We don't have to go and tell everybody we're a couple because nothing has changed between us..."
“Hm?” Sherlock noticed that he was just about to enter his Mind Palace and his body was completely tensed up. Almost automatic response to arousal when he couldn’t engage in it. “Oh, I’m fine.”
happen? Maybe John would know, he's a doctor after all.
“How are you explaining what you wanted to do with Elsie and Chloe, then?” John asked. Surprisingly, Abby looked at Sherlock as if waiting for his permission, he nodded.
"I have never held a grudge to them. I've heard some from the homeless and of course, I have to fit in and tag along when I'm in disguise. Sexual jokes don't alarm me the slightest, John. I can even tell you a few."
“I helped Wilson to put Hudson and Patrick behind bars. Both were condemned to a death sentence. Mrs Patrick died of a heart attack when she was 38. Her daughter Elsie was around 17. She started to study due to a benefit but then her father’s past caught up with her… long story short, her father left debts, very dirty business with mafia.”
"Talk to
"Sorry, John. But you weren't sleeping. I hate to repeat myself. Are you all right?" At the question, John closed his eyes in the dark and sighed yet again.
"A... book." John repeated, after a few seconds he chuckled lightly and closed his eyes at the light. “What kind of book?"
Sherlock thought it through. Very good. He didn't want John to be with this utter insecurity. But then again, John was a soldier. He had nerves of steel. John never faltered. But he had been captive once and they had almost died because of that.
Lestrade released his arm, making a frustrated sound in his throat. Sherlock made his way out, following John into the chilly night air. The lights were on, and there were just few people walking by. John put his hands inside his pockets and started to pace, Sherlock walked next to him on his left.
“Goldfish,” Sherlock murmured as John went to hug his daughter. He frowned, it wasn’t the first time hearing that but he had never asked. Sherlock and Mycroft’s communication was something to be left to experts, in his opinion.
It wasn't frenzy as the other times before; it was slow, sensual, Sherlock's soft moans filled the room as he moved over John, his erection moved down and it rocked a bit around John's entrance and the doctor lost it, he groaned around a kiss he was planting on Sherlock's neck and Sherlock pushed further. It was a bit clumsy but John let Sherlock to do whatever he wanted. Sherlock straightened his back and his length was pressed below John's scrotum, he took John's into his hand and began to pump him, slowly, John circled Sherlock's waist applying pressure on his own entrance with the base of Sherlock's length.
a coward, I wanted- I still want to know, what he told me, and I didn't tell him that I really, really wanted to know. Why didn't I? Oh, because I'm stupid, a coward."
"Sherlock." The tone was worried now. The detective turned his head to look at their surroundings, they were being encircled by a gang of homeless, Sherlock smirked.
"I had another sample."
"He was one of the men in the gang this afternoon, one of the gang that stabbed my arm."
Following his instinct, John brushed his knuckles over Sherlock's cheek, the detective's lips seemed to calm at the touch. The rapid movements of his pupils were reduced, and the eyelids, which were visibly fighting between staying up or shut down, now blinked slowly. John smiled satisfied. He sat to the left of Sherlock on the couch trying to find a comfortable position; he moved his arm under the other's neck and Sherlock's head tilted a bit to him, the action made the detective's head to fall over his shoulder.
"Yeah, the hot line works under departments, the exotic one has women and men, most of them only girls tho'. They are usually from different countries... they talk with an accent. It's all good as long as you have an accent."
"John..." Sherlock called quietly. The doctor didn't move. "John...!"
When Chloe Hilton closed the door to leave John and Sherlock with a bottle and two glasses full of water on a side table, Sherlock hurried to the bathroom and took a glass of water with him while fussing on his phone. John, familiar with Sherlock’s ways, stood silent next to the big window for a few moments, looking at the room.
“The label of the spa just said lemon and ginger, why does it have grass?” John said with a frown, serving rice on three plates and spreading beans on top of each.
"Drugs." Sherlock interrupted. "It's a whole new group of drugs dealers... a big one, John." John nodded and Sherlock continued. "They are trying to go undercover and they were deliberately changing the drugs in the hospitals. Now the drugs are the usual ones though, but they lowered the price to rise up suspicions from the dealers, so they can lower their facade when they start to look for the guilty that is selling the

"No!"
Never parting the kiss, John grabbed a handful of Sherlock's hair and, with all the delicacy this action allowed, he threw Sherlock's head back. His other hand was still on his nape supporting him. He kissed slowly but firmly the other man's jaw and neck. The kneeling position over the bed allowed him to move up or down at will. He lifted himself a little to draw a pattern with his tongue and lips all the way to Sherlock's ear. The detective was panting, his eyes were clenched and his grip on John's clothe was firm. Growling lightly, John moved then to his collarbone, he travelled all the way up by his neck. He stopped when he found his Adam's apple in the middle of it and circled his tongue over the little bulge. He was delighted with the moan that escaped Sherlock's mouth when he did that. He kissed and licked his chin and then found Sherlock's open mouth again, he played with the tongue he found inside and, quickly, withdrew from the detective's face and let go the handful of curls. John had a surprised expression on his features. He couldn't believe how animalistic he had become. And that he was capable of...
“You okay?” John asked as soon as he saw Sherlock.
"Did you enjoy it, John?" he said, faking a light panting.
John heard the water of the sink running; a little smile crossed his lips as he placed one hand over his forehead. "Oh God..." he whispered.
. He was used to his friend's stare already, sometimes himself even would be staring back at John with no apparent reason. But by his peripheral view, he saw John's eyes dancing from his toes to his head and that made his mind fly back to that night. That intimate night. The Night that didn't want to be erased from his mind palace.
When Sherlock returned, he was fully dressed again, his blue robe –
"I assume this is significant enough for you not signing an email... but you didn't go to the flat, so it's not rushed enough either." Sherlock put his hands in his pockets as he walked into Lestrade's office.
"Lestrade, we're on our way now, there is nothing more to do here. I give you the lead and you follow it as usual. Do not mix family interest here, tell my brother he can stop worrying now, would you?" he said to the DI as he walked away nonchalantly, followed by a confused John.
He HAD to appear. JUST HAD. I'm sorry!
Sherlock made a sarcastic grin with a snort.
"That's a good thing, isn't?" John asked. Mycroft paused and opened one eye to look at him.
"I'm not sleepy, John." Sherlock said, his voice was almost teary and broken. John sighed deeply and Lestrade passed a hand over his face, confused.
"And what happened to this little company?"
"What." Sherlock turned and stopped, his face back to normal, John battled internally with himself. What could he say? Distracted? No, definitely not distracted. Alert? Sherlock was always alert.
"And what happened to his face?" she asked, concerned.
"John!" Sherlock called, but there was no sign of the doctor. Sherlock wanted to get to the other room to get more information from the woman, but Lestrade stopped him pulling at his arm.
"This case was never our division to begin with. We've been told off. So we're doing it as requested."
"You need to tell John." Was the first phrase from Louis. He kept driving, he was also dressed like the staff from St. Bartholomew's Hospital.
"I don't think so... I know the bloke at the financial department. They were even thinking about expanding!" Armand brushed his fingertips to his lips, thinking, remembering, "There was a little company they wanted to buy, so they could merge them together. The rumour was strong among us, workers. And soon Xavier confirmed it to me. Oh, by the way, Xavier is the financials' headmaster I was talking to you about before…"
"Fuck, Sherlock..." he moaned out, grabbing Sherlock's hair, oh God how he loved to do that, he saw the detective's eyes roll back in his head and he couldn't stop himself. He supported his torso with one of his elbows as the other hand gently tilted Sherlock's head back, the detective nearly lost his balance, but his palms still supported him. John kissed roughly his neck, his ear, he traced the shell of it with his tongue earning an incredible sound from the detective, who started to rock his hips in a rhythmic slow but hard movement over him; still their erections trapped between their bodies. John had his eyes open; he didn't want to miss anything about the man above him, nor an expression, nor a sound.
But tonight, everything was different. He was very aware of what he felt and was still feeling. And he also realised that the feeling wasn't going to go away easily.
"Sherlock, you barely eat whilst on a case..."
She was obviously affected. She had tissues with her and her eyes were rimmed with red. As they talked every now and then a tear would escape her eye. She was trying very hard not to collapse. John felt awfully sorry for her.
“No. I’m just…”
John snorted and tilted his head back on the couch.
Sherlock felt how John's leg returned to his original position next to his. Their knees brushed again, he heard a loud sigh coming from John. All of this time he couldn't drink his beer because of a knot in his throat... and inside his stomach as well. With John being this close, it was enough to put his mind at ease. It was clear as water to him, last night, that John didn't have a date today. So Sherlock had been a little worried – not that he would ever admit it - thinking about what John was really up to. He had been working with Lestrade all day long, but his mind was thinking about his friend the entire time.
"I knew you would come. You didn't disappoint us…! You're as good as they say." She said slowly. Her voice was very high pitched.
Sherlock stilled as his climax hit him with force, painting the sink and part of the mirror with gushes of white. John was breathing hard, harder than he should have. He quickly put his phone in his pocket to avoid it getting messed up and pressed two fingers against Sherlock’s neck. Their reflections met again but now John’s eyes were serious and concerned.
"How is your arm?" John asked, trying to sound unimpressed, also trying not to be disturbed by Sherlock's little knowingly snicker.
"I need to make a call and mine is-"

"Hiding at plain sight, I have to leave without being suspicious, so I am going through the front door. Louis is driving the fake ambulance now and..." Sherlock stopped talking, swallowing a lump in his throat as he heard John talking outside. '
Earlier this evening, John couldn't hold it that much and all of this started there, he recalled the events, he recalled Sherlock dropping the gun, surprised perhaps at his attempt at humour when saying sarcastically, after Sherlock told him to take his handcuffed hand, that people now
"Yeah."

When they reached the first floor, Armand turned at John again, he took John's hand with both of his and shook it with a firm grip, the army doctor returned the gesture.
John turned completely to face Sherlock and the other man lifted his eyes finally. They both locked their gazes. There was no readable expression on neither of them. The moment wasn't long, but wasn't normally short either. John felt a little burning in his chest.
After that, the consulting detective sat on his chair, knees over his chest, toes tapping the leather. Now and then John would look over at the concentrated expression he had. Sherlock was thinking, and he was thinking hard. He had a frown over his features and, except for his toes, he was immobile, one could think he wasn't even breathing.
"First two digits:
, instead." John gave him a small smile and returned his attention to the window and to the outside, but he still felt the heavy stare of his companion at his back.
“Yes.”
– shade of silver-gold of his hair. He was using the cheap shampoo again, the one that smelled like almonds. Sherlock had to fight the urge of clearing his throat.
“I’ll explain more when we arrive.”
Then everything in his mind just fitted.
There was a loud deafening noise and James had to take his headphones off in one swift, fluid movement. "Ouch! That wasn't nice!"
At that very moment, the girl who took the order arrived. She brought a familiar sized pizza; it seemed neat and appetizing. She placed it on the table with two forks, a black coffee for Sherlock. When the woman walked away, Sherlock snorted when he saw John's alienated expression. Big eyes blinked at the huge plate in front.
And most importantly, he recalled the desperation as he ran to talk to Mycroft, he recalled his own voice, his racing heart, far too evident in front of Sherlock's brother as he scolded him, his hands clenching rapidly as he fought the need to just take the shit out of the man right there, his composure almost completely gone as he talked to the man who claimed to have a

Lestrade made his way throughout the people firing in front of them. Getting far from the facility, passing the alley they were at before. There was the rental car Lestrade had arrived in, parked at the other side of the crack in the wall from which the DI had appeared. They got out of the vehicle and John ran to open the door to check on Sherlock, who was still lying alongside the backseat.
situations. He eyed everyone very quick and then looked somewhere else. Then, he tried to remember what he had caught with the quick scan. He found out one of the doctors had a big admiration for Sarah. He was peeping her way all the time. He also observed two of them having the same shirt than yesterday and, oddly enough, they were sharing the same cologne. John shook his head and stood up, dismissing himself politely under the excuse of having patients waiting for him.
“Inspector Martin,” Sherlock said in a staged whisper, “I recommend you to lower your voice.”
“Okay, I know better than trying  to...” There was a sigh on the other side of the phone. “Ah yes! Miller reported that he’s taking you to Ridling Thorpe now. Why?”
“Oh, you’re not talking about the case, now.” John wondered aloud. He was back to taking photos of various works in the new small room.
"Sherlock, listen." He said quietly. "I know this is uncomfortable for you, but you need to keep warm and your body heat is very poor now. I know your mind is working fine, so relax." At that, the growls faded slowly, Sherlock's breathing was still laboured. John continued talking with a firm but soothing voice, "I'm going to wrap you in this blanket," he moved the blanket to cover his shoulders, "and we're going to keep you warm, okay?" John started to draw a circular pattern on the back of Sherlock's neck with his fingers, then he moved his hand up and stroked his scalp. His other hand moved up and down Sherlock's shoulder, trying to warm him up.
"Hm?" He asked still a little of breath.
"And what do you think killed these people? They're suicides, according to Lestrade."
"Oh but you like it, Sherlock... you love it when you see him. Oh well!" there was a pause and then only breathing. "It's normal you know," the voice continued, "when you own a pet, you are happy just when you see it moving its tail, don't you think?"
"It's alright, Sherlock..." John said out loud. Sherlock supported his elbows on the table, his eyes fixated on the beer between his hands. John mimicked his position; his right arm and Sherlock's left one were lined up, glued together. "I just had a little chat with him yesterday... I needed to uh... clear up my mind a bit."
"Yeah. Were you asleep? I heard at the Yard what happened to you... are you alright?"
"Yes, Lestrade, I need to know only the location of the vehicle I described, but please, don't send incompetents; all I need is to know where it is, then leave the rest to us."
"I can't see why it affects you so much... it wasn't
a posh spa…”
"Where were you, by the way?" John cleared his throat. "Aren't you cold?"
his mind screamed. He dried a little his dripping curls with a towel, pulled the shirt back on and turned back to look at himself in the mirror. As soon as he locked his stare with his own eyes, he tried to stop the forming frown. Then he saw how his curls were facing everywhere, he placed them back carelessly with his fingers, the mirror got splashed by water droplets.
in the army for god's sake; guys making out in the rooms or tents. But at the moment, nothing was bad enough to disturb him. His mind was blocked-up then, leaving emotions completely out of it. But
"Yes. Yes... sorry to greet you like this, but we were working late night on a case..."
"Shhh... let me." John's voice came out in the form of a firm whisper; it made Sherlock go tense in a matter of seconds. John worked with his thumbs slowly, drawing little circles, applying the faintest of pressures at Sherlock's nape. John noticed, delighted, how little hairs there rose under his touch. He also noticed a shiver running up Sherlock's back as he dragged his fingers in between his shoulder blades. "Is it there where it hurts?" John applied a little pressure with his thumbs and was rewarded with a soft sigh through Sherlock's nose.
Sherlock's head was thrown back, long neck exposed, lips carefully apart looking silently for air. His right hand was pressed over his erection and the left grabbed one of the cushions John was sleeping on earlier. His shirt was opened three buttons at the chest, and John could see how it was plastered to his skin thanks to the sweat. The robe – dressing gown – was completely open.
The taller man's eyeballs rolled back in his head, eyes still closed, he felt himself shivering at the contact of the hand in his hair, he felt how John's fingers moved near the back of one his ears and then to his nape, massaging there with the thumb and index finger. The sensation was marvellous when being still in his palace. Sherlock had long noticed how strong he felt when John did that and of course, the doctor also knew how soothing the effect of this was for the other man, hence he had found himself doing that often the last few weeks. Even though now, with the closeness that neither of them seemed to mind now, Sherlock's body reaction were a little further than a simple soothing effect, and John noticed this too of course, since the detective's hand on the armrest next to his head was replaced by his elbow when the arm started to shake, making the face of the detective fall back to the area of John's shoulder and neck.
In the cafeteria, Molly waited nervously sitting in the nearest table by the door. She had applied light makeup on, knowing deep inside Sherlock would notice it and it would make her even more nervous. She would ending up cleaning it off anyways... but she didn't care. It was the first time Sherlock had accepted an invitation to any contact outside Bart’s, by himself at least.
John noticed Sherlock sighing deeply and giving Rosie a small smile. He said something that sounded important – everything Sherlock said sounded important – but he didn’t hear it. There was that irrational anger again, this time pointed at Sherlock. If Rosie ever called Sherlock
His movements were confined to the small space he had between the table and the chair and, when Sherlock’s first arm came free from the dressing gown, he looked at it for a couple of seconds as if following a vein right from the wrist to the inside of the elbow. The marks from the past drug abuse were almost completely faded now. John had seen those; they had been awful a year ago. But at least those
“When?”
"Check that out," he yelled, "your friend always does that same thing..." Jack shook his head, amused, but still had this smirk on his face.
“Have you considered the possibility that she might be having sex with someone else?” Sherlock asked and then bit the inside of his lips when he saw, out the corner of his eyes, John’s eyes grow large and his jaw drop down, looking at him with obvious disapproval.
“I don’t know what they’re doing up there!” she said, waving her hands and going to the pantry again, “Sherlock has been requesting chocolate, lemon, almond’s scent – I had to go and buy that last one! – and…” She thought for a while, then quickly turned and finished, “oregano.”
Sherlock pressed one.
"Don't let John in. You have to convince him. He can't see me. He can't see my corpse."
"John?"
“I’m used to that by now, with undercover work.”
John’s smile was tight but genuine, silently grateful for his friend and his insights.
"I'm going to contact you when I need you."
The older Holmes let out a soft chuckle. Armand frowned at that. This man in front displayed an emotional jumble; not even
"God- Sherl-"
Armand's lips barely touched the cup in his hand, his eyes were fixed on the detective sitting in front. John was really enjoying the breakfast, eating pieces of everything on his plate. Sherlock's coffee remained intact and the toasts Armand presented on a plate in front, untouched.
He heard the door opening and the steps ended there. Sherlock had stopped for a reason. John didn't want to move or speak. Then there was a little rustle of clothes, surely he was shrugging off his coat... and John finally heard the familiar call.
Good. Normal-John it is. He sent another text.
Mycroft frowned. Really, what Phillip was talking about almost made no sense and was irrelevant, the man in front was clearly trying to avoid any matter about the real important one.
Sherlock sighed. "Oh, John..." he said in a breathy tired tone, John's stomach stirred completely at it; it was ignored. “How I would love to live in that little mind of yours... so naive..."
fond of sexual related jokes?"
Silence.
John separated his fingers and opened his palms, they shook in the air when he spoke, raising his voice "Well, deduce
“Yeah. Alright.” He set to work, then. He cleaned Sherlock’s arms with a warm damp white towel; all the way from shoulders to the tips of the fingers.
"You don't have to." John placed his hand over Sherlock's thigh and squeezed. "Don't do that... Sherlock. Please."

"Sherlock?"

“Ah.” John turned to put some plates on the table. He cleared his throat. “Not madness, then?”
“Oh my God…” She huffed a laugh. “In the mornings. She usually has a horrible temper when she wakes up, but now she’s... let’s say her mood has improved which in turn improves mine if you catch my drift.”
The car ride was spent with Martin chatting about the water waste and how the majority of it came from Elsie Patrick’s cosmetic chemistry. He also told Sherlock how the analysis he’d helped with had accelerated the process so they could file it under Abby Slaney’s threat, leaving Elsie Patrick without blame in the case of the water waste.
"True." Added Sherlock with a throaty chuckle.
John lifted himself quickly off the bed and went downstairs wearing his pyjama pants and a sweatshirt. When he got to the kitchen, the view almost gave him a heart attack.
**..**
“John,” Sherlock spoke for the first time in a while. “It’s fine. I appreciate your concern, but you don’t –”
The countdown on the screen ticked three times.
"You..." Sherlock took a gulp of air, "...you tried to kill me. I tried to stop you and somebody shot your back. You..." he took another gulp of air, this one sounded shaky, "...you fell over me, bleeding everywhere..." at this point, John's throat was a knot, listening to Sherlock talk like that made him want to get inside the phone and hug him. "When I tried to wake you, you just put your hand on my face and said you were sorry."
The first time he'd imagined that, his captors poured ice-cold water over his head. He'd never truly believed in God, but in that state of mind, he'd believed it to be a sign; a voice in the shape of cold water telling him to stop thinking stupidly, that it couldn’t be possible. The second time his mind palace showed him that reality, he'd seen himself in his coat like a shadow, getting closer to a lovely little house, a big garden, John in the middle of it smiling to a small blonde child and hugging a faceless woman from behind, laughter and laughter until it turned into the laughter of his current captors.
"It's easy to deduce, John. You
"Yes, Sherlock. Do whatever you need." the DI said despite the glare it earned from Donovan, he simply shrugged in response.
"Fine, actually... everything's okay..."
Sherlock though
Perhaps that little notepad was his nicotine patch after all. His own paper-palace.
“Uh-hu.”
"I was just looking for money, sir. My wife and my-!"
"Did they find it?" John asked, his laughter subsiding slowly.
"Jesus!" Sherlock almost threw the cup away, but realised it was a fake almost, almost immediately. A real one should have moved,
"You admit it!" the tone John used was high pitched, clearly surprised again.
"Yes you do."
A text from John told him he was going to be home around 2 pm so they were due for a late lunch. Excellent.
"You, thinking about John Watson all the time... I assume that little red mark below your ear is-"
"Seriously, you can be so stupid sometimes... now there. Don't do anything unnecessary until this is completely recovered, yeah?"
But he was also sobering. He thought about the aphrodisiacs and cursed internally. If he kissed Sherlock now there was no coming back. A kiss was a seal and, going by Sherlock’s solemn face, he knew Sherlock felt it that way, too. He felt a thrill of panic and adrenaline so strong his torso gave a little shudder and Sherlock, observant as he was, noticed. The hand on John’s neck jerked away abruptly and the hand on the lower back moved to the safer territory of John’s shoulder.

"I would never."

“Back to business, then,” he started, his voice soft. “I found the lead we were looking for. We need to go to Elsie Patrick’s house tonight.”
"I'm listening..."
John laughed. “Yeah. I suppose you are.”
…?" he muttered, his tongue seemed asleep, his eyes were shutting down. His arm moved to reach something at his back, but instead it looked like some weird kind of dance.
"Are you alright?" He asked taking his hands from his pockets and pulling off his gloves. His deep voice resonated softly in the flat after John's desperate cry.
“I’m a doctor,” John said, and even if it sounded completely out of the blue, it seemed to put Chloe at ease.
’, too.
“The cameras never triggered because she does it
Sherlock frowned a bit and, after a quick scan to the other's posture, he questioned "Was the driver talking on his phone? Was the driver drunk?"
"About?" John gave Sherlock his cup, who sipped immediately on it, making a face as he burned his tongue.
The first person to enter the room was Detective Greg Lestrade, followed by Detective Martin, then constable Miller and Wilson Hargreave, now free.
John’s face went scarlet when, even with the commotion, he remembered what that hand had done earlier in the night.
Sherlock's expression changed quickly from sleepy to confused noticing the position they were. John watched attentive every move of his companion above, how his eyes were wide open and the expression of total perplexity on his face, he saw how his eyes clenched shut for a couple of seconds and frowned. He moved the arm that was beneath John and the cushions to the side of John's face, supporting himself further away from the doctor, like noticing he was almost crashing on top of him, his right fisted hand making little pressure on the doctor's chest. The movement was very fast, and finally he lowered his gaze to the man beneath, like seeking for an explanation.
“Sherlock? Sherlock!”
As always, thanks to my wonderful beta
That only meant Sherlock trusted him enough and had the same faith John had in him, right?
As the guy kept on speaking on the phone, Sherlock answered automatically with the faked aroused voice. In his ears, his own voice was unexciting, the words were worthless. A little sensations of disgust formed slowly, materialising in a misplacement of sensations inside his stomach.
“What?” More panting.
"I told you,
, it could be his as well, right? He was also asking for Sherlock's laptop, even if he knew the password was going to be hell to decipher.
But he regretted it immediately. He didn't want other people to know how Sherlock could open himself up like that; he felt it was too personal for the blog; classified for John alone. But even so, there were things he wanted everyone to know. He wanted to show the world that Sherlock was human after all. That Sherlock was
"Just because." Sherlock purred the words in his ear now. He lifted his left hand and ghosted his fingertips in the back of John's neck, he toyed with the collar of his shirt. He noted how John's breathing had become a little laboured now. "You're nearly hyperventilating."
“Don’t tell me you can’t recognise those noises.”
“Are you okay, Miss Hanson?” Abby’s voice sounded concerned.
“The nervous state in which I had been these last days rendered me ever so much the more excitable.”
Original text from Oscar Wilde's Dorian Grey is:
There was a sigh from the detective and John separated a bit his cheek from Sherlock's hair, Sherlock lifted a bit his face to look at the doctor and, quickly, little white letters floated around him:
"John! Look at the screen! Look at the dates! One of them is tomorrow." Sherlock tried to grab a pencil and John rolled his eyes. He knew this was an urgent matter judging by the dates in the file, even if he didn't know what they meant.
Sherlock just pressed his lips. “She’s fighting,” he pointed out. “Look.”
received at 19:03.
"Yes, keep going." Sherlock's face fell back to the pillow, but this time he kept his eyes on John. The doctor made more pressure as he lifted himself with both knees over the bed. He bent a little and then, supporting his palm over Sherlock's shoulder blade, he moved his face closer to his ear.

John walked back to his laptop and began to type down the case of
"Why?" John asked finally.
John opened his mouth to ask but Sherlock's stopped him.
“What else, Sherlock?” John asked as he read some receipts from inside the drawers.
"Yes?"
But he never anticipated the need he was going to feel as soon as he was close to the other man. It seemed that after having had a taste of John’s skin and smell, he was never going to have enough. He distracted himself by grabbing plates and cups to put them in the cabinets, moving the photos on the table to the side, some of himself on awful green and red on display. He felt his cheeks turn pink. The leaf of aloe vera was something he didn’t even want to look at.
John smiled again and moved his hands to Sherlock's chest, grabbing the shirt with both hands; he tilted this head down and pressed his forehead below Sherlock's neck.
, if you know what I mean..." at this point, John couldn't decide if laughing, crying out loud, or just to knock out the younger detective next to him, who was now reaching to grab his hand. But he also knew Sherlock had his motives, so he just kept on with this dreamy grin on his face. "So I don't want there to be a chance of..."
"John... Armand is easily readable, a trustworthy ally, I dare to say. He is idealistic, yes; but he also pursues his goals and that, as much as I understand over the matter, is a good thing. It is only in our benefit."
the British government.
"You okay?"
With a deep sigh and his eyes over the coffee machine, he asked in a throaty voice "How many, Mycroft...?"
"Wait- What?"
“Sniffing around.”
John moved his fingers around Sherlock's hair, still pulling, grabbing, moving Sherlock's head to his own will, kissing every inch of the detective mouth and Sherlock let himself be guided by those rough hands, by the nails digging into the flesh at the back of his neck, loosing himself in the sensation of extreme anxiety and wanting. He felt John's legs sneaking around his waist and he also felt how his hips started to grind against him. John's whole body was moving against Sherlock's and soon Sherlock understood it was because he was moving over John as well, his whole body was sliding against John's as they kissed.
"You?" the tone was genuinely surprised; John wanted to tilt his head to look at Sherlock but stopped halfway.
“He gets
"Okay." She said finally, placing both hands on the desk in front of him, a somewhat submissive gesture, "what do you want us to do?"
When she looked at Sherlock, Martin yanked at the handcuffs she was in and dragged her out of the room.
"Really? Awesome!" the face of the handsome man lit up again. You could easily say John had injected adrenaline right into his veins with that phrase. He lifted himself from his chair almost with a jump and took a couple of papers from his jacket. He handed it to the doctor. "This is my phone and my address. My complete name is in there. There are also the addresses of every facility the company owns; Xavier gave them to me. Do you think you are going to need anything else from me?"
Sherlock remained under the door frame with a confused expression. She continued, "I mean, since John isn't here, I thought... maybe... you would like some company?" She smiled and toyed with her fingers.
driving a giant truck." He replied absentmindedly, she gave him a cautious look "Sorry." He offered in a smaller voice.
Why was that so vivid inside Sherlock's brain? John blinked a couple of times, at lost. He could feel the soft breathing of his companion, somewhere in between his neck and hair. The position made John feel embarrassed, but at the same time, it gave him a weird sense of security, to know Sherlock actually cared so much.
"Are you not feeling well?" he asked politely, a squeeze on the arm.
And his stimulated mind could perfectly invoke a much-wanted mouth, right there on his neck, panting. If so, John’s nose would be pressed against his jaw, and his own nose would be pressed against a cheek. He could easily make his way to John’s nose with his own.
As always many, many thanks to my beta
“Maybe I phrased it wrong, John. I meant to ask…” He came a step closer as he hesitantly continued. “Are
Hope you liked this chapter!
"I need coffee!"
But Sherlock knew what John meant, he knew it clearly, he could see it written all over John's face, posture, his eyes, the way he looked at him impatiently, the way his eyes seemed like two magnets attracted to Sherlock each opportunity they had. Sherlock knew, but even if it hurts, all he could do was to keep himself in track, his mind clear to deal with Moriarty's problem when the time comes.
John rolled his eyes and saw the detective putting his socks and shoes in order to be ready, jacket and all ornaments. At the time, by the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw John with his thumb over his phone.
“Well…” Sherlock tried to sound normal, a bit amused at this tacit game of theirs. “You know, the usual, lots of programming, lots of codes, lots of staring at a computer screen…”
"Do you think he has something to do with the brick this morning? Maybe it wasn't an accident after all..." he said pensive.
“So, the flat is clear.”
"Oh Molly! She's a lovely girl, isn't she?" she said with a grin, the corner of her eyes furrowed with the gesture. Mrs. Hudson always tried to cheer John up, whenever he was in this kind of introspection. At least John would talk to her, she knew he wasn't a very talkative man... except maybe with Sherlock. "I always liked her so much." She continued, "Not like the other woman... what happened to her? Sherlock never tells me anything... that pretty woman with wavy long hair?"
"Oh. She’s sleeping with her boss."
“I suspected.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “Some of them are pretty graphic, even if you can barely notice who is there, so I am going to have to ask you that only you and Greg have access to them. Until the case is closed, at least.” He finished with a flourish of his hand in Martin’s direction and had to close his eyes tightly when the fabric of his shirt grazed his chest at the movement. John’s touch was immediately conjured.
John turned as he left the kettle to boil and raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock remembered the aloe leaf. “He would have to be an idiot if he ever chose to ignore the power of nature.” He smiled. “So many powerful poisons in a flower or a simple cactus.” He stopped and frowned, just now realising what she had said. “When you say considering… considering what, exactly?”
"I know... I know, Sherlock. I don't expect you to imagine my pain, I grew up with them, I grew up admiring them... I feel as if I'm part of this too." Armand sniffled silently and passed the coffee to the man in front, who still didn't have any expression on his face. "Dr. Watson is right." He stated.
But even after eating, his body was still restless. He closed his eyes to calm down, but John’s hands were a constant ghost on his back, his shoulders, his neck and his thighs. He searched his mind for something to calm his treacherous body, but he found himself thinking about John again and the reaction he was going to witness as soon as John crossed the threshold: what would it be, angry-John? Indifferent-John? Regretful-John? I’m-not-gay-John?
"Yes." He cleared his throat. "Through a computer." He rubbed his neck once more.
John kept his gaze locked on Sherlock's eyes for a moment, but the detective broke the stare to look down at the violin in his hands. Silence was good with Sherlock. Those peaceful moments they had after a case were not the kind of awkward silence, but a nice, comfortable silence. John knew this time it was different though. Several times he had caught Sherlock re-reading Irene's phone, and seen Sherlock with a lost look in his eyes more than once, and the weirdest of it all: looking at him, as if searching for something.
“It has nothing to do with friendship,” Sherlock said drily. “Things happen, John. And sometimes things that happen are… shit.”
“We’ll have to get creative.” Sherlock took a good look at the position they were in. He was seated on the stretcher, it was high so his feet barely touched the floor. John was standing in front of him, his forehead almost at eye level with Sherlock’s nose. He took John’s hand and led him to the V between his legs. “Come closer.”
Sherlock blinked a couple of times at the now unlocked and bright screen. It had planes of the abandoned factory they had been in the morning and a file full of dates and vehicles' plate numbers. When John saw Sherlock's confused face, he got closer and looked at the screen.
"I presume you made your decision, then." Mycroft lifted a bit his chin as he spoke.
.” Sherlock’s hips moved closer to John’s in a movement so forceful that John lost a bit of his balance. His left hand grasped the edge of the stretcher, Sherlock supporting the small of his back there.
“Right,” John stood behind Sherlock and placed his hands on his shoulders, massaging lightly. “I thought I was shite at this.”
Thank you to my wonderful beta, Lita Kelly!!
"Anything you need. I am still here. You can call me."
.' Molly was right, it was a bit hard to change his expression as John scrutinized him, still a bit asleep. He didn't say a word.
**..**
"Sherlock..."
He supported himself with his left hand at the edge of the open door and touched the front of his jeans with his right. It felt so electric he nearly confused the ping of his phone with the jump of his heart.
"I told you, you're huggable."
"Do you want me to move?" Sherlock asked with a little frown and tilting his head a bit.
“You okay?” John asked from outside the half-closed bathroom, his voice timid.
had done God knows how many times before, when I was playing with him or when he
Sherlock frowned but soon his brows darted up. "Seems fair enough." He said with a shrug.
He barely answered the last text one-handed, put the phone back in his pocket, and his right hand seemed to have a life of its own as it roamed from the pocket to the front again, the rough fabric of the jeans was too much against the sensitised skin of his crotch, and
He moved the fabric down, sliding it slowly and carefully, pants and trousers together. He had to remove himself from the bed to slide them completely from John's body.
Sherlock didn't reply, a loud sigh from the younger one was heard and soon the air was filled with the smell of fresh coffee. Mycroft handed him a steaming cup and soon Sherlock was grimacing as he burned his tongue.
and your job, but I will never approve the way you practice your... your...
"I doubt it..." John answered, "I'm surprised he can even think enough to form a phrase, though... when will the results be ready?"
"… and Sarah told me, that maybe I could fill the doctor’s shift next week... seriously though, being a paediatrician doesn't suit me, but again... we have to pay the rent and it would be for only a couple of days, a week, at most."
Phillip smiled and dialled. He waited patiently and he only said, not even greeting. "Sebastian, show is about to begin. Take care of the cars."
He wanted to turn off the telly so, looking for the remote, he passed his arm over Sherlock's stomach and felt something weird about it: it was tense. John eyed Sherlock’s face again, but it was still relaxed.

“Okay, all set. There are several new products today,” John said as he opened a bottle, wrote something on the label of the slide, opened it, took a small amount of product and closed it. All with great efficiency. Sherlock observed the process with a smile.
“Okay, then,” John turned in the middle of his way back to Abby’s office when the woman passed him and put a hand on his forearm, stopping him. Craig was still inside with Sherlock.
he lifted his brows at him but soon discarded the thought as Sherlock walked to the closet.
"I know that, John... oh I know that." Sherlock's reply went out shaky, in a nervous sigh. Oh yes, if there were something he was certain of, was just that.
, don’t you see?” Sherlock waved the photo of the kiss and pointed at the necklace. “She had said that it was a family relic but she

"No." John felt kicked in the stomach.
"I hope I never do" Was the throaty answer. They both smiled to themselves.
Sherlock's mind raced with a lot of cases involving people's black market; usually those led to drug's market, and even maybe to organ trading. Thinking about all this, he took his phone from his pocket and dialled a number, for much John and Lestrade's astonishment.
“Aloe provides help for collagen to develop below the dermis,” John said, completely taking Sherlock away from his mind. “It mitigates scars tissue over time.” John squeezed more product into his hand and continued his ministration on Sherlock’s back. “You know…” John paused and took a breath, “Mrs Hudson has this aloe plant she never uses and it’s huge. I’m… thinking about massaging you with the substance from the leaves. At home.” John knew he was blabbing. He cleared his throat and went on, “At least once a week, or…”
to do. "No. Drink this. You'll listen to me. You told me I counted and I am going to make it worth it."

"Why is it important?"
**..**
He smiled to himself when he thought about nicotine patches. He looked at the little note pad and moved to pages from previous cases.
"If you like." Sherlock heard the other man giggle again.
“Yes! Come on in, Hamish. I’m sorry, boys, I won’t be a minute.” She stood up and walked to a cupboard to retrieve the supplies.
"Explain."
Sherlock needed.
**..**
“Oh, I’m fine, dear. I’m just so sorry for the china.”
It was new, this. To be almost caught in an intimate position. John and Sherlock shared a look, both of them breathing a bit heavily through their noses, both had a weird expression between seriousness and a smile, surprised at their action.
"You told us the dimensions of the painting, I observed a bulge near the window we escaped from with similar dimensions. It's in a box, well preserved, same proportions. We all know the painting disappeared at least three weeks ago. It all fits, the dates," Sherlock gestured with his hands, "the boats, Phillip Smith's sister and her disappearance, everything! Why can't you people just think!"
"Sherlock! Stop! Stop it! You can't stand!"
Sherlock removed his coat and scarf, sat in front of John's armchair bringing his knees to his chest and stayed there. His mind started like an engine once again today.
"Just be... whoever you want to be, you don't need to do much, anyway. I will talk to you."
"Morning. Did you sleep well?"
“Never better.”
“Is a hug not enough?” Sherlock sounded genuinely puzzled. “You already have the slides, just put them
back for him.
John only heard a murmur over the phone and Mycroft's quick replies "Who? Philip Smith?", "Oh God...", "Right, if Armand is with Xavier at the Yard, you can only retain the later for forty-eight hours...", "Don't tell Philip", "No, Armand is not going to be interrogated", "Don't allow Philip to get in touch with her."
“Miss Eldridge, you don’t have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court,” Sherlock said, panting.
He remembered, on one conversation he and Mycroft held, how the older Holmes seemed convinced to ask for John's advice when dealing with anything that had to do with Sherlock's sentiments.
"Sherlock..." there was a warning in John's voice.
"How does the Yard know about this?"
"Behind you!"
"Sherlock... you need to sleep, okay?" the soft tone of the doctor brought the DI back to reality in Sherlock's room.
"If I answer him now... will he remember later?" Lestrade asked. He had this big grin on his face as he watched the-always-composed Sherlock being in such an awkward state.
, right above her left buttock a fresh wet stain of..."
“You see, I really need a chemist in the opiates’ area. I didn’t want to open any vacancies without trying to cajole you first. If you want the stable job it’s one of the best paid in our division and I really need someone trustworthy and brutally honest to work with me. And the second,” Martin smiled and looked around but he held himself confident. “I’ve been working on this and I know body reactions pertaining drugs. If you want to change the masseur, I could help with your investigation too, from here on.”
John's eyes snapped open at the question. It was difficult to find his voice back. "Uhm… sure, yeah, why not." He opened his arms to welcome Sherlock and the detective hugged him slowly, circling his arms around the doctor's neck and shoulders, taking his time adjusting to the embrace. He inhaled deeply, smelling John's aftershave. Even with the awkwardness of the unusual action, it was still a friendly hug; both were smiling in the other's shoulder.
The pillow on his face turned into a toned and salty shoulder. His hand clenching the abused fabric would have been right between two shoulder blades. If it went down it would have touched the small of a back shorter than his and – who was he trying to fool, anyway – he would be touching John’s buttock, now, pressing on it so his groin would be right next to Sherlock’s.
“Holmes.” That was Captain Watson’s voice. Sherlock’s spine straightened up.
“Are you going to think about my proposal?”
