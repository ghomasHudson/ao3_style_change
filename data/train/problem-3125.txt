Scott swallowed. “I... I dunno. Me and my friends were just messing around. One of them found this creepy old book at an antique store, and they brought it over, and, you know.”
Cas probably senses some of that nervousness, because his voice softens a little. “There are some things that are fairly simple, and don’t require anything except the proper paperwork. Balthazar and Jody take care of that, for the most part – they’ll have already sent the initial request through. Once it’s approved, we can start to send in the rest of the paperwork.”
Castiel swallows. “What if he only wants me there because of this heat? When it’s over, he could hate me for seeing him like that. For
“He looked better than I expected,” Pamela says briskly, tossing her bag onto the table. She looks at him with a knowing sort of air. “He tugged you into his nest in about three seconds flat, didn’t he?”
The collar hits the ground with a dull, nearly soundless thud. And it’s so loud that Castiel will hear it in his dreams for years to come.
out. Because before now, Dean’s never once been happy to share a bed with an alpha man, and has never once wanted to wake up next to one.
Dean clears his throat, thinking back to Balthazar’s second visit to Cas’s house. “Uh. Yeah. He’s got a talent for it.”
“But – he’s an alpha,” Kevin says blankly, glancing down at Dean’s tags – he’s probably wondering if Dean’s insane. “I thought…”
Dean fiddles with his zipper, frowning at the fluttering papers. “What’s the stuff that ain’t so easy?”
Mentions of Dean's treatment under Alastair, including the rape. It's nothing graphic, but it is stated pretty bluntly. If you don't want to read about that, skip from "This is the man who..." to "This is not a man."
His friend snorts. “Not like you think. He’s gonna have to sort through some of that on his own, and he’s still getting used to you. He’s not gonna trust you with anything that deep yet.” He half laughs. “Hell, you’re probably a mystery to him. You’re a little weird, mate, no offense.”
As soon as his touch leaves the omega’s shoulder, he scrambles out of the bed. Lands with a dull, sick
Cas speaks up from across the room, his voice low and soft. “Perhaps we should hold off on that, just for a while,” he says gently. To Dean, it’s a genuine suggestion – something the alpha is saying because he cares about Dean and can see that he’s already past his limit for just about everything today. But, to Sam, it obviously sounds like a thinly veiled order.
Benny’s voice is careful now. He’s undoubtedly sensed the tension in Castiel’s voice. “Sure, brother.” He pauses again. “Or we could just do this now.”
happy that he is so close to the alpha - even if he's still sitting on the floor where he shouldn't be.
Dean glanced around – luckily, the attendant was still outside. “Scott, keep your voice down, dude–”
The omega’s face doesn’t so much as twitch – Castiel had been hoping, he thinks, for some sliver of amusement to ease the choking tension in the room. He gets none. “And the second night?”
There was a time when Dean might have thought that anger was directed at him – fury for all the punishments he’s earned over the years. But he knows better, now. He recognizes the mama bear rage in the older woman, and he’s grateful for it.
His throat tightens at the meekness in the omega’s voice. “Yes, of course you are. You don’t ever have to ask me permission for that – use it as often as you like. That goes for the shower as well. The upstairs bathroom belongs to you, though you’re welcome to use the downstairs one if you wish.”
If he had a shred of pride or shame left inside himself, he would have opened the car door and jumped out as soon as he let himself acknowledge it. But Dean’s too much of a coward for even

though,” Castiel continues, “instead of at the main campus where Balthazar and Pamela work – we recently took in a large number of omegas, and the law states that a property can only house so many slaves at any given time. We were going to be over-capacity at the facility, which would put all of those omegas at risk of being repossessed.” Dean nods, and, encouraged that he at least understands the basics of slave-law, Cas continues. “Normally, our staff and network of fosterers take any excess residents into their homes temporarily, but we’re over-full even there right now because of the recent bombings.”
They are standing in the courtyard outside of the facility, face to face, the sun bright and warm above them, the wind rustling through the trees that ring the wide open patch of grass and tables. He and Balthazar had discussed it – it seemed best to have their initial meeting outside, rather than in the confined space of an office. The omega himself has been leaning against the wall, his arms crossed. He hadn’t even looked up when Castiel had rounded the corner, his eyes trained on Sam as if he expected him to take off running at any moment.
Dean sits there, frozen for a long time, before he draws in a tight breath. “I don’t understand,” he blurts, and his voice is small and afraid. “I… I’m not acting right.”
, his scent curling and shuddering with shame and pain, something dangerous and broken there. Something bordering on hopelessness, the kind of numb sadness that was past even tears.
He hardly feels his knee, hardly feels the cold. He just knows that if he stops, he’s going to freak the fuck out, and he
Dean studies her. She looks… tired. Worn down, even more than the last time he saw her – and considering she was actively crying at that point, that’s not a good sign. “Hey, Claire?” She looks up. “You okay?”
Cas’s eyes are soft, when he manages to look back up at them. “I just mean, thanks for being you, I guess,” he finishes lamely, blushing when he hears how childish he sounds. But he means it.
– I had no fucking clue what was happening! It was all black, and – and I thought I was gonna freeze to death – then there was
The tip had made Castiel terrified to look through the most recent entries into his file, but the documentation had, for the most part, dropped off. After his last purchase, the only notes on Dean were brief, clinical records from slave doctors, haphazardly paperclipped and folded in. Even the most superficial injuries listed had made his stomach turn, so he’d skimmed, and looked for patterns. And he’d found one.
as he scrambles to his feet and follows Castiel down the stairs. The alpha doesn’t look back, confident that he’s following behind. He resolves for the hundredth time that he’s going to do
They drive up closer, filing past a few dozen cars in the lot, until Cas is right up close to the front entrance. The parking space he chooses, despite being quite close to the door, is the only one empty for several rows. Dean looks at him incredulously.
Dean looks at him for a long moment, searching for something that Castiel doesn’t understand. Whatever it is, he must find it, because eventually his gaze softens. “Okay,” he whispers.
“Why don’t you pick something to watch while I pop a few bags?” he suggests, gesturing to the remote.
“I don’t know,” he whispers. Ashamed to admit that he has no idea how long he’s been in Hell. The days had blended together enough that he doesn’t even know for sure what
So he pushes away the agony at the thought of a Dean-shaped hole in his life, and clears his throat. “Once we start the process, it usually takes a few months at the very least. There’s all kinds of tests you’ll need to pass, evaluations you’ll need to score highly on.”
Sam sits up straighter, his heart starting to pound. “Oh my God. You mean I can–” He stands up. “Charlie, I can
cry about the magnitude of that – of an alpha being repulsed by the scent of his agony, instead of excited by it.
There are immediately tears in his eyes that he has to blink away before Dean notices. The fact that he trusts him enough to let him into his safe space… it makes something inside of him
Balthazar is openly staring at him, tense. It is very obvious that he’s waiting. The longer Castiel goes without moving, the more his hackles drop, and some of the wary notes in his scent – just barely detectable over the
that Sam will be disgusted with what he sees. That he’ll take one look at Dean and prefer the memory of what he used to be – a protector, a big brother, a
Vision swimming, he stumbles out of the shower, searching for… something. For alpha. He wants alpha.
Castiel’s eyebrows draw together. He rubs his face for a few seconds as he digests that. “I was… quite tired.”
Bobby sounds a lot calmer when he finally breaks the silence. “How far’d you make it before the old gal broke down?”
When he finally stumbles into the bathroom, he gently sets Dean down in the tub, clothes and all. The omega protests with a sharp, panicked noise when he tries to pull away, his hands catching in Castiel’s shirt and holding on tight, eyes screwed shut and chest heaving.
Castiel takes pity and makes the choice for him, pulling him closer and wrapping his arm around his shoulders.
sort of treatment from an alpha. It may very well be the first time that he’s felt this sort of primal safety in his life
Castiel doesn’t hesitate. He nods, just once. Squeezes Dean’s hand and sits on the edge of the mattress, leaving a careful foot of space between them. “I will.”
him to stop. If he was being honest, it wasn’t the touch that was tearing his heart in two; it was the knowledge that this would end eventually. That this would likely never happen again.
Cas just smiles back at him, his hair every which way and his eyes soft, and Dean can’t help but roll his eyes so that he can squirm away from his feelings. He nudges a plate closer to the alpha, his heart fluttering. “Go on, Cas. Don’t just

Before he can ask for clarification, though, the sound of Balthazar snoring saws through the line. He bites the inside of his cheek and hangs up, stuffing his phone in his pocket.
but the kid didn’t push it. His brain only seemed to restart once Scott had shut the door to their room behind them.
Slowly, he reaches out again to take Dean’s hand in his own, pulling it gently away from the tight grip he has on his hair. He squeezes it. “I’m sorry.” He waits for Dean to breathe again, his eyes still closed, his hand shaking in Castiel’s grip as he tries desperately to keep his emotions in check. “But you do not belong to him anymore. There is
“Your hand,” Dean said, flashing him a quick, reassuring smile – the expression made his heart do a little tumble in his chest, which did not help with his nerves at
Sorry this one was not out as soon as I'd hoped. I faced a HUGE stint of writer's block with it, and had kind of a troubling week besides, so it's not really up to my usual standards. I may go back later and fix this monstrosity, but I figured many of  you would want to see it even if it's not quite what I want it to be yet. It's also quite a long chapter, so that may make up for some of its mediocrity.
This chapter is one of my favorites. I hope you all enjoy - it's a long one, so it will probably be a few days before I post another.
When Castiel opens his eyes, he’s afraid that Dean will look crestfallen. Forlorn, or rejected. But the man is sitting back on his knees with a rueful, slightly embarrassed smile on his face, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, clutching a pillow to his middle with the other. He’s flushed all the way down to his neck, and Castiel doesn’t need his nose to know that he’s not the only one who’s aroused.
“You don’t actually have to wait for my permission. Just so you know,” Castiel rumbles. He takes another bite, giving Dean time to formulate a reply of some sort, but he can’t think of anything to say that won’t sound either contrary or pathetic.
“Not that it is necessary. We definitely do not need to take that step tonight. Or ever. I just mean that it’s an-”
in that way. But the small attempts he’s made at telling Dean what to do, if only to ease his anxiety, have felt distressingly… easy. Natural.
to human beings. He hopes for a day where he will be able to help slaves without buying them, but today isn’t that day, and it probably won’t be for a long time.
When his master is gone, Pamela turns back to look at him and pats his arm. “You can say no, you know.” Dean blinks at her. “I won’t tell him, if that’s what you’re worried about. Doctor-patient confidentiality.”
That, however, seemed to be exactly Cas’s plan. He reached a hand down and took hold of Dean’s balls, gently rolling and tugging. Dean pressed his head back, trying to gather his torrential thoughts, but to no avail. Between one moment and the next, he tipped closer and closer to the edge.
Dean watches, bewildered, as he does just that, moving a little too quickly. Pamela offers her hand to help him down from the island. He stands uncertainly, legs shaky. “I’ll need to see it to treat it,” she explains, and he swallows when he understands what she means.
Dean blinks, sure he didn’t hear that right. After a moment, he leans back, staring at the alpha incredulously. “You think
knocks him out of his self-deprecating spiral. “It matters to Balthazar! It matters to all the omegas you’ve helped, all the ones who get to wake up at night and feel safe – some of them for the first time in their fucking
“Can you pause it?” Dean asked, and the man obligingly tapped the space bar. “Back up a little. Little more.” He leaned in closer, wondering if he was seeing things right. “What in the hell…?”
later, Sam still walks into a room and checks all four corners first, still angles himself so that his back is never toward open air.
And then suddenly he’s moving because Cas is getting up and Dean is in his arms like he’s a little kid, and before he understands what’s happening he’s up in the bed with the alpha curled around him protectively, the blanket warm and heavy over them both. Cas strokes his fingers through his hair with one hand, the movement calm and sure, and tucks his chin over his head. His other hand splays across Dean’s lower back and holds him close.
Hell, he’s already taking advantage of it; normally, he picks out his clothes before he showers, so that he doesn’t have to make even the short trek back to his room in nothing but a towel. He’d been too freaked out to do so last night, but it hadn’t made a difference, in the end – Cas hadn’t done anything except blush furiously at his semi-nudity. This morning, Dean steps out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist with a degree of confidence he never imagined possible.
Eventually, Castiel has done all he can safely do. For a while, he just rests, slowly moving his thumb up and down Dean’s nape. They both need a moment, he thinks. Dean seems quite happy to stay right where he is – he turns his head slightly and presses his cheek to Castiel’s chest, nosing against the damp fabric. He might even fall asleep – Castiel can’t really tell.
Dean glances around, even going so far as to check inside the console and contort his body to peer under the seats. But there’s no sign of the fancy gold card he’d seen Cas flash at Hannah’s shop.
She nods at that and pulls a few more bottles from her bag. “These are for possible infection and these are to deal with any STIs – your paperwork from the auction-house says you don’t have any, but I think we’re better off safe than sorry, especially because there’s no specific mention of your abdominal scarring on it. I want you to take one of each every day with a full meal.”
Dean scowls down at the book, but he has to admit that Benny is right. It can’t hurt anything but his pride, and that’s in smithereens anyway. “Fine.”
He tightens the towel around himself self consciously, and, as though he’s just remembered that’s all he’s wearing, he blushes. “They’ll get all gross anyway,” he mumbles, shame in the words, and Castiel can’t have that.
‘Cause Dean shouldn’t either, right? The very idea of Cas’s bite on his neck should disgust him. Should make him feel like
She drops her hand and takes a step back. There’s something hard in her eyes, something murderous, so he ducks his head, hands clenching around his neck even as he pleads. “Sorry,
and if he doesn’t calm him down soon there’s a real possibility that the younger Winchester might actually try to murder him.
when he isn’t. Castiel is not exactly upset by this, considering how comfortable he feels at Dean’s side. The warm, content satisfaction he gets every time the omega nuzzles into him or holds him has not faded in the slightest – if anything, he’s worried that he’s going to have a difficult time adjusting back to how they were
The words should surprise him. Most people don’t think like Benny does – in the eyes of the law, he’s property. If he belongs to someone, they have the right to treat him however they want. If his master wants to fuck him, or
He can't help the huff of laughter at the thought. The alpha turns and looks up at him curiously, his eyes earnest, but Dean just shakes his head. “Nah, Cas. Don’t care what color.”
“Here. Drink that,” he orders, albeit gently. Dean looks relieved to have something to do, some direction to follow. He lifts the cup to his mouth and sips it with only a faint grimace at the taste.
Once he’s fully clothed, he clears his throat, and Cas turns back around. Dean can see tense little lines around the alpha’s eyes, can sense his worry.
Castiel furrows his brow. “Of course. Where we sleep matters very little to me, Dean. I’m comfortable regardless. But I know it matters to you.”
to, because it was right. He should have known Dean would be suspicious, should have anticipated that he’d need proof. He realizes that, foolishly, he’d expected Dean to be so relieved that he was no longer being mistreated that he wouldn’t question anything.

His uncle just hugs him a little tighter. He doesn’t bring up false hopes, doesn’t tell Sam that one day Dean will be here again. He doesn’t lie to Sam about those kinds of things – never has.
He deletes them without even looking, going so far as to cover half the screen with his hand. And it makes his heart ache to send away the first message, but he taps the little trashcan anyway.
When he draws up the courage to follow Dean into the kitchen, he starts to pull out the chair across from him. But the omega is perched on the edge of his seat like it’s going to bite him, back ram-rod straight, hands gripping the edges. His eyes are glazed, face pale, and when he looks up at Castiel it’s like he’s been caught doing something wrong.
He can feel his jaw working. “I guess.” It doesn’t matter that he’s here, though. It’s clear that being up off the ground like a
The screen door knocks open behind them, and they both look up to see Pam with her hand on her hip, leaning in the doorway. She looks a little exasperated, but not
Castiel pauses. He’d very much hoped that this particular conversation could wait. He’s not sure how much he’s supposed to tell Sam – how much he should prepare him for what Dean’s been through, and how much he should keep private for Dean’s sake. Sam’s mouth presses into a thin line, his voice tight. “He was – he was always good with cars,” the younger man explains, hope laced through in his words, even though they both know it is unfounded. Castiel winces.
like this; the crawling, skittering feeling of being hollow, of missing some vital piece of himself. Of feeling like there’s a hook in his sternum, pulling him toward the sleeping alpha downstairs.
“That’s okay. Thank you for telling me,” he says, and Dean relaxes a little more. “One of my goals is to help you be less afraid.” He’s hoping this is the right direction to take, hoping that he can frame the truth inside of a context that Dean can understand. “So if I’m scaring you, I need to know. I’m not very good at avoiding that,” he admits, and Dean confirms it, quivering under his hand but saying nothing at all to agree.
Over and over again, he’s simply given Dean what he thought he wanted. His hand, when Dean had tugged at it. His reassuring touch when Dean had shifted in place one time too many. He’d moved obligingly out of the way when Dean had started to tug the mugs out of the cabinet to rearrange them. Hadn’t even blinked when Dean had changed the song playing from his phone six times in a row, unhappy with them all.
The thought makes bile rise, but he clasps his hands over his mouth and swallows, refusing to waste the first good food he’s had in far too long by puking it up. He’s been to the training centers more times than he can remember, sent back there after every escape attempt and every time a master returned him when he became more trouble than he was worth. The handlers had always known he’d been a repeat customer, had seen it in his file, and each time he’d gone back they’d been more than eager to remind him of his place. He knows, too, that the duration of his stays there had dwindled to the point where there’d been no real reason to go at all – he’d gone from being able to hold out for a month to barely lasting a few days before caving. Before begging and presenting and acting like the bitch
“I’d say he’s ass over teakettle for you,” Claire argues conversationally, taking a sip of her water. “Personally.”
And he’s worried, based on the tense silence, that he’s crossed a line that they’re not going to be able to come back from. This is it, he figures. This is the moment when Cas shoots him down, irrevocably and firmly. When he makes it absolutely clear that he’s as close to Dean as he’s willing to get.
“They’re probably not that worried,” Scott said glumly, fidgeting with the little packets of sugar on the table.
But then, yet again, Castiel is at eye level with him on the ground. He looks up with a nervous swallow, taking in the alpha in front of him with a surprisingly low level of dread. Maybe it has something to do with how Castiel is sending out those same calming pheromones, or maybe it’s because the man hasn’t laid a hand on him except to help him, or
Sam breaks off. Feels Charlie’s infectious joy inside of him dim as he watches fat drops of rain gather together and slide off of the windshield. “He, uh. He was at first. But I… I made a real ass of myself.”
camping trip and pried what had happened out of John, Dean had already been gone for a week. And by the time he made it to
Dean looks up from his bowl in surprise. Cas had opted for a simple breakfast, claiming that he didn’t want Dean to have to wash yet another pan. Dean’s just as happy with the cheerios as anything else. He’s nowhere near the point where he’s going to start being picky with food, bell peppers aside. His stomach is still unsettled after his and Balthazar’s discussion, anyway – this bland food is a blessing. Castiel munches his portion silently, waiting for Dean to respond with trademark patience.
Filled with a tenderness so soft it’s almost foreign to him, Dean reaches out and cups his hand to Cas’s cheek. The alpha’s eyes slowly drift open; cloudy blue. Awareness creeps in sluggishly, like Dean has found it always does before his coffee. His skin is stubbled and cool under Dean’s touch. The alpha leans into his hand with a small sigh, closing his eyes again.
is like – get skirted around in a skittish, almost nervous way. The only reason that doesn’t make Sam sick to his stomach is that Dean’s muteness doesn’t seem to be borne of fear. It seems more like his brother is unsure of how to fill the silence.
“A bonding clause,” she repeats casually, tossing the ball up and catching it in her opposite hand. When he doesn’t respond, she looks up. Her expression sharpens. “You don’t know what that is?”
on feelings. The instant he hadn’t needed to hide them from Cas anymore, they’d come pouring out of him, blood from a gash.
Wildly, he searches the room for the bandana, but it’s in Dean’s hand and balled up before the alpha can reach it. Dean holds it to his chest defiantly, raising his chin in a blatant challenge, and Cas stares at him like he’s certifiably insane. “What are you
The omega’s face is nothing short of bewildered when he gives him the pillow he’d abandoned in the study, and he has to look away when something cracks in Dean’s expression. He holds the pillow to his stomach slowly, like he’s not sure if he’s allowed. “I… thank you,” he says quietly, the words loaded with emotion that neither of them want to dig into any further.
The inside of Balthazar’s office is spacious and warm, with a large window and a comfortable couch that looks like it folds out. There’s a soft, cable knit blanket draped over the back, and a scattering of pillows down the length of it. There are framed paintings on the walls, little eccentric odds and ends here and there, plenty of books and a few filing cabinets. A framed photograph points away from Sam on his broad, wooden desk, next to a sleek looking monitor and a corded office phone.
The omega’s eyes linger on Castiel – somewhere around his shins, he thinks – before he nods jerkily. The fork shakes when he lifts it and stabs it into the casserole, and only half of what’s on it makes it to his mouth. But when he chews and swallows the relief on his face is enough to make Castiel’s chest ache with sympathy, and, as Dean releases a quiet sigh, the sharp sizzle of hunger fades ever so slightly from the air.
Cas’s low voice startles him a little, and he jumps. “It’s warm – be careful,” he says, handing Dean a mug. It’s got a goose with an honest to God bow-tie on it, like the old lady dishes he used to find in droves at the thrift store. It makes him grin.
Firmly, Castiel pushes away quickly simmering anger – all these little signs of abuse and mistreatment are sparking a protective sort of rage inside him. But it is a rage that Dean does not need to deal with that right now. So, instead, he tucks this away for safekeeping with all the other tidbits that Dean has dropped about his father. Castiel cannot fight his ghosts, no matter how much he wants to.
Alarm bells ringing, Castiel gets up slowly, and takes an equally slow step to the side, putting the desk between them. He holds his hands up. “Now, Sam…”
“Do you want… I don’t want to presume,” he says awkwardly, carefully outside the perimeter of Dean’s newly constructed den. This is the first time he’s shown any inclination to create comfort for himself, at least in a way that is this visible. It’s sad that it took a heat for him to give in to the urge, but Castiel knows better than to mention it now.
Dean swallows. He puts the phone down, then turns it over for good measure. And before he has to think about it, before he has to make any sort of choice, Cas turns on the morning news downstairs and gives him the perfect excuse not to.
The word trembles just a little, but Dean just holds his head a little higher when Cas stares at him, taken aback. “No, Cas. It’s been off most’a the night and you didn’t do anything.”
Cas’s frown deepens. There’s no one in the hall, though he can hear people in the rooms off to either side. In moments, they will no longer be alone, and Dean needs to get his shit together before he embarrasses himself
Dean knows he should probably let go. Should try and figure out why a man he thought might hate him is clinging to his shirt instead, like he’s afraid Dean might try and pull away.
He’d dragged him to a room that Dean had never been in before. Something small, and dark, far away from the beds for the customers. Slowly, almost
“I don’t think so, either, but we should get a baseline set anyway,” she explains. “An MRI too, but we can leave that for another day.” Dean just shrugs, willing to do what she wants. An x-ray, from what he remembers, doesn’t hurt.
What Castiel wants from him is still a mystery. Dean’s willing, whatever it is – he admits that freely to himself. Forget whatever’s left of his dignity, forget fighting. Fuck that. He just wants to go a month, a week, a
instead. Kneeling at Dean’s feet, a picture of vulnerability despite his furious attitude. Dean didn’t know what he’d done to deserve ending up like this, but he
Predictably, the omega rolls his eyes, muttering something about him being ridiculous. Castiel isn’t quite done, though – he lightly grips Dean’s chin and tilts his head until he can’t look away.
The alpha moves forward, reaches out, and it’s a damn near thing but Dean manages not to flinch. But instead of slapping him to remind him of his place, Cas hovers his hand above Dean’s shoulder. And he waits.
Sam feels his throat tighten. The omega is unabashedly watching him, his eyes narrowed as he waits to see how Sam will react. This is a test. It
Balthazar is silent for a long, tense moment. Finally though, he sighs. Drops himself down on the porch step next to Sam, his elbows on his knees.
“He’s a virgo,” Charlie deadpans. There’s a few more seconds of silence, and then, “Looks like he owns two properties in the state. One’s residential and one’s a…”
He goes into the living room, sure that they’ve fallen out on the couch while he was sleeping, but they aren’t there either. He can hear the shower shut off – that’s where Dean has gone. The omega’s abrupt departure is starting to make an awful sort of sense.
Dean closes his eyes. Skittish as a damn colt. He can feel something sharp and angry in his chest when he nods, jaw clenched so tight it feels like he’s going to break it.
“And you… trust him?” he asks carefully, thinking of the expressionless eyes of the alpha. He hadn’t been actively threatening, but still. Dean has got to imagine that he’s not the only one that’s nervous around him. “He doesn’t make you…”
Dean winces, pulling the phone away from his ear. Claire smirks, getting up to throw her trash away. “Claire caught me pretty good with an elbow jab,” he explains, eyes following the young omega across the cafeteria toward a trash can. “I’m fine.”
Dean shrugs, a smile tugging at the edges of his mouth. “Well, not really. Didn’t really matter what I did. Nothing made any difference,” he adds, and he can tell that bums Cas out because of the way his scent gets all melancholy and the way he slows his movements. But he pushes forward – this isn’t supposed to be a sob story about his shitty childhood. “Tasted like shit, anyway. This is better.”
Dean reaches up to fiddle with his tags again, his eyes cutting away. He looks even smaller than he had before. “Right.”
Dean’s eyes catch his again for a beat, long enough for Castiel to see that they’re wet.  His words are soft when he replies. “I want to believe you.”
He scowls again, but Balthazar just laughs. He gestures at the door, effectively ending their conversation before Castiel can turn it into an argument. “Come on. As bent out of shape as you are, you definitely didn’t eat breakfast, and it’s well past noon.”
He abandons his chair, aligns himself in front of Dean to ground him, get him back in the present. Dean doesn’t react in the slightest to his proximity – he is stiff, frozen, eyes too wide and breath too shallow.
Dean huffs out a little laugh, and the shock of that – of sharing a joke with his brother – is almost painful in its simple goodness. “You mean he ain’t retired?”
“I’m afraid my boss has taken a shine to him,” Balthazar says, his mouth twitching as if he’s suppressing a smile. He types yet another set of
A breath he didn’t know he was holding hostage bursts out of him. He takes a shaky, hungry gulp of the cold air. Fights back a wave of something feral and furious, a chill crawling up his spine. The woods are spinning around him.
when he has a plate of food in his hands, choosing to question someone he’s terrified of – but he doesn’t know what the problem is and he doesn’t think it would be fair to the omega to ask him to explain himself. “Yes. That’s food for you.” He’s not sure how else to communicate that, so he reluctantly changes his suggestion into an order. A gentle one, but an order nonetheless. “Please, eat it.”
lied about waking him up. It had been nearly eight by the time Cas had given in, anyway, and Dean figured the alpha needed all the sleep he could get.
“Thanks for – you know,” Dean says awkwardly, swallowing. “You definitely kept me from having a total melt-down, just then. In the elevator.”
somehow, that he’s not being told what to do. More choices, instead of orders. He hasn’t had to make this many decisions in years. The mental gymnastics are exhausting – should he put himself out of sight and mind? Should he be attentive to Castiel’s needs, like he’d been trained to do so long ago? Which does the alpha want? Which is safer? Which will keep him here, away from another training center or whorehouse like Hell?
me to sleep,” he tries tentatively. He’s trying to make sense of Castiel’s words, which clearly don’t at all fit into how he’s learned the world works. It’s like he’s waiting for Castiel to rip the rug out from under him, to laugh in his face.
Sam nodded, writing down something on his notepad. Dean couldn’t tell if he was just doodling, or if his nerd of a brother was actually taking notes. “You said there was security footage of the suspect this time, right?” Sam asked, glancing up at the man with his eyebrows raised expectantly.
It’s a response he’d heard hundreds if not thousands of times from slaves who behave themselves, so he thinks it’s safe to use here. Instantly, though, he knows he’s fucked up, because Castiel shakes his head almost violently.
It sends a bolt of anxiety through Dean. It’s never good when they smile. He holds the blanket in his hands like a shield, like it can protect him from whatever his master has planned.
“They simply seem... troubled,” Cas said, frowning at the wall – supposedly, in the direction of the kid’s room. “They are not sleeping.”
Dean looks up at him out of the corner of his eye, nodding uneasily when Castiel doesn’t add anything else. He ends up putting the cup down on the tile within his reach rather than handing it to him. A thought occurs to him – has Dean only been drinking water when Castiel has given it to him? The omega never asked for a glass, and Castiel highly doubts that he came down in the night to get one. The image of him cupping water in his hands to drink out of the sink or shower makes his stomach twist. He’s
you. I’m so sorry for how much it has hurt you,” Cas says, tightening his hold on Dean for a moment, his voice breaking. “But you are
He gestures to the couch in the small room, but Sam ignores him, standing there stiffly with his arms crossed against his chest. He sighs.
This time, there’s no debating. No going back and forth in his head as to whether or not this is right, whether or not he’s allowed. He’s got his cock in his hand in a heartbeat, desperate for relief from the heat and the
Dean stares down at the little device in his hands. He’d known that phones had changed a lot since he last had one. He knows they can video stuff and take pictures that don’t look like shit, he knows they can play music. That’s all stuff he’s seen his masters do. But this – the idea that he has unlimited access to information – floors him.
They go down to the gym in utter silence. Claire takes the stairs without a word, not even glancing at the elevator as they pass it. It’s a relief, but it also makes him wonder what kind of crap the kid has been through.
“I don’t understand,” Dean finally allows himself to say. It’s a dangerous thing to do, questioning his master, but he can’t take not knowing. The thought that at any moment Castiel might send him off to someone new scares him more than being punished for disrespect, so he locks his eyes on the alpha’s throat. “Why does that matter to you?”
The words should probably hit him hard; he knows that. But they blast around him like a strong wind, powerful but not really touching him. He doesn’t understand what Castiel is saying to him because it doesn’t make sense. How the fuck is he
Dean takes a breath. Closes his eyes, and settles into the warmth of the alpha underneath him. He can feel Cas slowly relaxing, can feel the tension bleed from him as he takes in Dean’s intentionally calm, content scent. He'd like to reach up to Cas's neck, would like to rub his own against the alpha's and scent him as Cas has done so many times. He doesn't, though, because the mere thought makes his heart pound a little harder.
he can think about is Cas. Cas’s touch and his smell and his kindness, the calm control in his eyes, the gentle and sure way he acts and walks and talks. His flushed cheeks that morning that he’d woken up with a problem of his own. His face when he’s
And while Dean’s nod isn’t quite fervent, it’s close. Close enough that Castiel knows distance is what Dean really wants right now, and what he deserves after what Castiel’s put him through.
It’s dizzying to consider. In such a short amount of time, Dean’s whole life has been flipped upside down. Before, any hint of pleasure, any

The orgasm hits him like a kick to the chest. He gasps, pleasure rushing through him for a few clean seconds before the fear slinks back in. He puts both hands on the wall of the shower as he drags in breath after breath, his legs shaking.
It takes a few seconds for the thoughts to actually sink in, a few more for Dean to believe them. But he does, eventually. Cas is

he pleads; an unspoken, hopeless blank at the end of that sentence. They both know what he needs, and they both know that Castiel cannot give it to him. Not now, not under these circumstances, where the line of his consent is blurred in more ways than one.
Cas stops in his tracks, his eyes flicking around Dean like he’s trying to figure out some sort of math equation. His pupils are still too large when he rips his eyes away and stares at the ceiling instead, swallowing. “Right. Apologies. You’re right, of course.”
The thing about omegas that people tended to forget was that they needed to be in ideal conditions to have natural heats – needed to be

alpha, but the smell of Dean’s fear and pain has awakened something in him that has long lain dormant.
feels. It’s taken him most of the morning to nail the source of his unease down, but he thinks he’s figured it out:
“Got it?” Balthazar asks, a weak voice from the speaker of his phone, no longer held to his ear. Cas shuffles his way back over and finally has the presence of mind to hit the speaker button.
“Sit down, now,” Balthazar all but orders. The commanding words from the omega shouldn’t have much of an effect on him, but Castiel finds himself on the cold floor instantly.  It takes a moment before he realizes he is utterly naked on the cold tile, and another few for him to think to tug his towel off the rack and drape it over his middle. He’s somehow managed to keep the phone to his ear, something he doesn’t realize till Balthazar's voice makes him jerk in surprise.
Eventually, he pulls himself from the sofa, stretches his arms over his head, and pads upstairs for a shower. He expertly avoids his reflection as he undresses – same thing he’s done every day since the first night he was here – and hops in, the warm water cascading over his shoulders and head. He scrubs up without really looking down at himself, still unprepared to see what his body looks like in the bright bathroom light. At least the bruises from the cane are gone. Nothing but a bad memory now.
“I… ” he begins, and Dean notices that he’s fiddling with a carrot, spinning it in his fingers. He looks strangely nervous. “I need you to know that this is not a tit-for-tat situation. I am not doing any of this because I want you to feel like you owe me, or as though you need to repay me in some way. I’m doing this simply because it is right, and far too many people have done you wrong.”
Cas reached back again, caught a handful, and ripped. This time a little gasp of pain escaped, but he ignored his traitorous brain, screaming at him that if he continued, there was no way in Heaven he’d be able to fly. Not without any feathers. He let the clump fall to the ground, bit his lip and reached behind him again.

them. Had been so incredibly relieved to get on suppressants – and he knows John had been relieved too, since he hadn’t bothered to ask why Dean’s heats had suddenly stopped.
“Anything,” Cas answered simply, because it was true. Whatever Dean wanted, whatever he needed, Castiel would go to the ends of the
Dean sighed. How convenient for Sam that he could sleep like the dead through a herd of damn elephants running through the room, while Dean would wake up at the sound of dust settling. “Great.”
Dean, of course, picks up on his guilt. He squeezes Castiel a little harder, mumbles, “S’not your fault, Cas. I shouldn't've been
Dean swallows. “Strawberries?” he says, mostly at random. Castiel nods like he’s said something meaningful and serious. He pulls the carton out of the fridge, rinses them in a colander, and begins deftly cubing them up.
Balthazar’s mouth twists. “He trusts you. And you have to understand that the trust of a person who has been through what
“Woah,” Dean said loudly. It was only then that he realized he had been splashing again, scrambling away from Dean, further into the depths of the lake. Dean must have followed him, must have reached out to him, because the hand on his elbow made him still. Made his racing thoughts slow and his racing heart speed up.
“Dean, I think Sam would be happy for even a single shard of you, if you insist on thinking of yourself that way. I… don’t see you as broken. And honestly, I doubt he would either.” The dismissive noise Dean makes tells him he doesn’t believe a word. “But,” Castiel continues, “If

Balthazar scoffs. “I think he’d have a goddamn mental breakdown.” He takes a long breath in through his nose, audibly trying to calm himself down. “Why the bloody hell didn’t you
“Maybe you do when you’re awake,” Castiel says softly. “But when you’re asleep, your mind is unguarded. More susceptible.”
“But, that’s the thing, Dean,” Sam said, wandering down the little alley behind the house and turning toward yet
And there really isn’t. He knows better than most the kinds of demons that Balthazar battles on a daily basis. It’s not a surprise to him that Dean’s heat would hit close to home for the man, and he can’t blame him for his defensive behavior.
Hoooo boy. Uh... yeah. Didn't watch the finale myself, but I gather it was pretty much the worst case scenario...
“Bal,” he pleads, but he has nothing else – his brain is screaming at him to get a grip, to find a towel, to stop shivering and bleeding and feeling like he’s going to puke any second.
Makes sense that he’d want you to care about them, too.” Balthazar’s mouth twists a bit. “Also makes sense that he wouldn’t want to reach out if he thought there was a chance you

His friend is right in the middle of swearing like a sailor; there’s a loud, sharp scuffling, and a few more muffled words, before, “No – for fuck’s sake, sit
“Home, please,” he requests, and Cas’s eyes soften when they look at him. He still looks confused, but he doesn’t ask Dean what’s gotten into him. Doesn’t make him explain.
He breaks off. Takes in a deep, shuddering breath, clearly a moment away from losing it completely. Castiel feels something inside of himself twist and ache at the sight – the obvious, devastating grief from the young man.
And then... the alpha’s hand is moving down from his hair, and down further, and then it stops. He’s
Castiel is very glad they had – Dean’s lingering heat scent had been nearly overwhelming when they’d returned, and he can only imagine how that might have played out had Sam been walking in the door behind them. He doesn’t
Sam comes to a sharp halt in the middle of his room. “Is that…” He clears his throat. “Is that what it sounds like?”
Castiel gives him a small smile, and Dean lets out a breath because that was clearly the right choice.
Dean stares at him for a moment, and some of what he’s feeling must translate to his face because the alpha’s expression softens. “Sounds like you’ve seen this before,” Dean says eventually.
He relaxes slightly, but he still doesn’t understand. “Well, I don’t want you to be on the floor either. When you’re ready to sit with me on the couch, we can
Dean sputters. “Be– Because! He’d never hurt me,” he says confidently. There’s not a hint of fear in his scent. Not a hint of doubt.
He misses Sam every time his heart beats. For years, he’s tried to shove his past life, his brother, into a safe little box, only to be pulled out when he had no other choice. No other way to keep going. But somehow, digging up that memory – a story about his brother’s kindness and stubborn love, about his own mistakes and faults – it hasn’t made it worse. It hurts like a wound, and it always will. But the ache of finally telling Castiel... it’s like stitches, instead of another slice.
“If… if you don’t, that’s okay,” Cas is saying. “You can have as much time as you need. I… you weren’t answering, and it worried me. So I came home to check on you. But I can go back. And sleep overnight at the center. Or for even longer than that if you –”
Dean shrugs again. He takes a deep breath, and gives himself a firm kick in the ass. “Y’took good care of me,” he mumbles, cheeks burning.
again, and hops right into his lap, circling and kneading into his slacks until she’s comfortable. Plopping down, she begins to purr – loud, rumbling vibrations.
He shifts on the carpet and wonders again how Dean is able to kneel and sit here day after day. He sniffs the air cautiously. There’s still that sour fear scent in the air, a little stronger than it had been, and he frowns at the extra layer that hadn’t been there yesterday. “Are you still feeling ill?”
Cas is silent for several more agonizing seconds. “I understand,” he finally says, his voice soft. There’s hurt there that Dean doesn’t get – isn’t Cas the one rejecting
I’m coming back here. See you guys tomorrow,” he said, flipping Dean the bird. “You two have a blast. I’ll be on the
“There’s a lock on the door, which I want you to use if you feel so inclined,” his master rushes to say, and Dean doesn’t even have the chance to be surprised before the man steps back and away from him. “Please try and get some sleep, Dean. I’ll do my best to clarify things for you tomorrow, but I think we’ve both had more than enough tonight.”
He tries, and fails, to ignore the little voice in the back of his head that tells him Cas doesn’t even want him
“Balthazar is fine,” he says evenly. “I’m afraid Mr. Novak is otherwise occupied today – but not to worry! Your appointment will be kept,” he says pleasantly, giving no hint that he thinks Sam might be lying. “Just, with me instead. Sound good?”
“A what?” Dean finally asks, trying to keep the suspicion out of his voice. He can feel himself getting tense already.
He flips to the correct page eagerly, and is promptly blindsided with the approximate force of a brick to the temple.
“Stress cooking,” he agrees. “Luckily, that means we’ll have plenty of leftovers for the next few days. When I called Pam to update her, she reminded me that you’ll need plenty of protein.”
Bal is quiet for a long time. When he does speak, his words are razor thin. “I don’t know if I’ve ever been more angry, to be frank. But there’s no point in adding on to your bloody guilt complex.”
Cas had picked through the bloody mess piece by piece. Knitted bones, nerves, skin, back together. When Dean was more or less a whole man, he woke, already feral with anger and a will to fight. When he’d touched Dean to subdue him, the half formed man had fallen unconscious in his arms, able to rest for the first time in years… Castiel had already known what needed to be done.
“Scott, I don’t know about you,” Dean said, brushing past the whole thing before it made his head explode, “but
Castiel just smiles. He scoots a bit, tugging Dean closer until he’s satisfied, his chin nudging the back of Dean’s neck, their legs folded together with nothing but their clothes between them. The omega hums, barely awake, and squeezes his hand.
with no memory of how he’d been caught and hauled back. About the agony of the punishments he’d suffered for his trouble.
“Let’s get you cooled down,” he says softly. Dean doesn’t so much as twitch. Castiel’s not sure he’s heard a word.
“That’s normal, boss.” He can hear Benny cracking his knuckles, and imagines him leaning back in his padded leather office chair. “Just biology. Nothing to be concerned about.”
His voice cracks a little; there goes that cool and collected thing he was going for.  "I don’t think I’ve
The sadness that pierces Cas’s scent does so with all the subtlety of a broadsword. His jaw stiffens, and he puts his own hand over Dean’s, holding it tightly. “I’m sorry it took me so long.”
God, his face feels like it’s on fire. He fiddles with a blanket, unable to meet her eyes. “I… uh, I don’t have…”
Shorter (bonus!) chapter because I felt just oh so bad about that last cliffhanger 😈 Enjoy some extra fluff this morning with a side of Sam's crisis mode.
The omega looks up, focuses his gaze on the opposite wall. There’s a weak sort of acceptance in his eyes, a familiar resignation that makes Castiel’s heart tighten. “You don’t need to apologize for that.”
When he can breathe without feeling like there’s a stick lodged in his ribcage, he leans back and laughs again, disgusted with himself.
He looks up, blinks back confused, frustrated tears, and tells himself he’s relieved. Tells himself that it’s good that the urge has passed. ‘Cause no matter how nice Cas is, Dean’s still not allowed to touch himself. That’s a cardinal fucking rule, one of the first things they beat into him at the training center, long before he ever got to Alastair and actually believed it: his body is not his own. He controls nothing, least of all things that make him feel
“I suppose I wouldn’t mind being able to actually find the book I’m looking for,” Castiel says lightly, smiling a little.  He eyes Dean knowingly. “It’s a task that is going to occupy you for a long while, I’d imagine. If it will bring you some peace of mind, I would certainly appreciate it.”
Sure enough, the screen flashes white and little logos and words start to appear, and Dean stares transfixed as Castiel moves through the set-up options that do nothing but baffle him. He shows Dean how to “unlock” the thing, how to navigate to the little green box down at the bottom left corner that will allow him to call people. It seems absurdly small in relation to the rest of the screen, considering it’s a friggin’
A little laugh bursts out of him, and if it sounds a little wet Charlie doesn’t call him on it. “Second, if you show up there with your big bad alpha self and it
For all his earlier impatience, Cas seemed to have all the time in the world right now. His strokes were even. Methodical. Like he had a destination and knew he’d get there eventually. Like nothing could stop him.
Benny raises his eyebrows, angles his face down so he can stare at Dean above his glasses. He holds up a hand and begins to count off on his fingers. “Well, partner, shall we name a few things?”
Dean nods, and they roll up his pant leg together so that she can take a look. He’d avoided looking at it this morning, but now he can see that it’s dark and bruised.
1) Sorry for the cliffhanger - the bonus of posting the chapter hellishly late is that there'll be less time between this one and the next!
“Cool it with that, Amelia Earhart,” Dean interrupted quickly, not wanting to freak Scott out even more. “What do you say, kid?”
he doesn’t. He’d tried to find the words to explain that. Had tried to get out the reassurances that Dean so desperately needed to hear. But there’d been something stuck in his chest, lodged in the way of his voice. Something awful keeping him mute.
Tucking his chin closer to his chest, he inhales and closes his eyes. His master’s scent washes over him again, warm and soothing. His shoulders relax.
away from what he ever would have allowed. If it were truly up to him, Dean would never again lay in anything but the softest, sweetest smelling nest of feathers. He would never again get bloody, bruised, tired. He would never feel anything except safe and cared for. And here he was.
back on his feet, glaring down at him. Castiel has the presence of mind to carefully slide his chair back and put some space between them, his heart beginning to pound a little harder in his chest. “Are you... alright?”
too hot – instead, he feels like he’s cooled down enough to want to be near it, as though Dean is a furnace on a winter day.
Benny takes a long, deep breath. He chews on his words for a moment – it seems like this man never says anything without thinking it through, first. Dean should try that sometime, he thinks.
Thank you so much to those of you who are reviewing! You always make my day when I read them before I go into work. Bless y'all T-T
He believes Cas when the alpha tells him he won’t let his former master anywhere near him. Believes that he could never fuck up
Castiel says more insistently, turning the phone so the man can see. But the omega is stiff as a board. In fact, Dean has very literally stopped
Dean can feel himself blushing. “Y’know. Just. Can you–” He gestures between himself and Cas vaguely, as if that’ll explain.
His eyes flicker to hers, and slowly, letting loose a sigh, he relaxes his hands. “Wouldn’t recommend it,” he mutters, and Hannah looks at him in confusion for a moment more before her expression abruptly clears, settling into something that resembles a dawning and dangerous fury.
Most of the time, he’s able to shove that desire to the side and ignore it. He’s done it a dozen times today alone. But this time, as though he can sense it, Dean locks his eyes onto Castiel’s own. He probably
“Does he have to wear that stupid mask?” he asks, half distracted by his own thoughts – he nearly misses it when Pam looks at him wryly.
Castiel closes his eyes. Another wave of nausea ripples through him, but it just makes him shudder. “I messed up.”
But his master doesn’t slap him for his insolence. He doesn’t even look offended. Instead, he scrubs at his face with his hand and sighs. “I’m not going to punish you for spilling the coffee, Dean.”
When they break apart, Cas is already fired up again. He takes Dean by the hand. Hauls him up, and launches into action.
The last message sounds like nothing more than static, at first. Sam goes to delete it, his finger hovering over the button – but something stops him. The recording is long – several minutes long, in fact. He can hear what sounds like faint breathing on one end, if he strains.
Still, he’d made himself linger downstairs for a while, fixing himself a cup of tea so he could calm down and center himself. He needed to be Dean’s rock, his safe harbor, and he couldn’t do that if he was anxious himself. It had been a good plan, right up until Dean had shot downstairs and barreled toward him like a homing pigeon.
Dean clears his throat, breaking the ringing silence. He picks up the sandwiches and peeks inside of them both, and asks Novak, “You want ham, or roast beef?”
He hadn’t been nearly convincing enough. The longer he’d lain there, the worse the hollow feeling in his chest had gotten. He’d folded in on himself and had breathed through his mouth, had squeezed his eyes shut against the lingering scent of Cas in his room. Had tried his level best to ignore the twisting emptiness inside of him, had tried to control the full body shivers that had wracked his frame.
Dean swallows. “You can, um,” he tries, and finds that the words have left him. He can’t make himself say it, but he
still turns heads, and to add the scent and sight of an unfamiliar, agitated alpha on top of that… It's a recipe for disaster.
Castiel leans back from his computer, rolling back his chair until he can see the man clearly. The omega has been leaning against the side of his desk for close to an hour, quietly relaxing and absorbing the sunshine that pours into his office from a window he’s never been more grateful for. Now, though, Dean is looking up at him with a determined expression that is quickly becoming familiar, some combination of nervous insecurity and stubborn bravery that never fails to make his heart ache.
Instead, Dean’s voice was gentle, and more understanding than Cas might have thought him capable of being. Dean had always been nearly...obsessively neat. With his car, with his room, with the scant belongings he had accumulated. The fact that Dean didn’t mind seeing him like this, that he wasn’t ashamed to be near him, made something uncoil in Cas’s chest. Allowed him to breathe a little easier.
It makes no sense. They’ve been together most of the day. But Castiel knows what he means. Going abruptly from non-stop contact to a carefully maintained distance had been… difficult. Even more so than he’d anticipated. So, this – this gentle warmth and weight of Dean on his chest, his rhythmic breathing falling in line with Castiel’s own, his scent curling into something content and relaxed – it feels right. Feels like coming home, more than walking through his own front door ever has.
The words are vulnerable enough that his walls have crumbled to the ground by the time he’s finished speaking, and in the wreckage, Dean looks more than a little lost. Dean’s scent becomes sharper, more agitated – and Castiel isn’t sure who Dean is upset with.
His father had done all he could to popularize the chips in the trade, and he’d been so good at it that they’d become standard government issue. Every collar that goes around a new slave’s neck is another drop in his family’s immense wealth – so, of course, quite a bit of their resources are poured into making sure the trade never ends. Into making sure that every slave that runs gets caught.
“I don’t have a license, Dean,” Scott replied with an eye roll, and Dean nudged them as they plopped down together in the grass.
“I’m Samandriel. Or – most people call me Alfie,” he amends, looking a little flustered and very young in his oversized button-down, almost comical in a red and white striped tie. His eyes keep raking Dean up and down, like he’s trying to figure something out. Dean doesn’t like it, and he feels himself tense up under the man’s gaze. “I’m Castiel’s assistant,” he adds, when Dean says nothing.
But Cas talks right over him, his voice slightly louder than normal. “The best option would be another mattress in your room – I believe there’s space on the other side, if we move the chair–”
– and those are more than enough proof that John will never see reason, will never prioritize his children over himself.
Then, it clicks. Cas sets his plate down, mulling over the request. “You want me to give you an order.” He studies Dean carefully, his eyes searching. “A
“Of course,” Cas says, sounding for all the world as if he doesn’t think this is patently insane. “You can program in the numbers that Balthazar and Pamela gave to you, along with mine. If you wish, that is.”
Squeezing his eyes closed, Dean curls tighter into himself. The thick mattress and the blankets make it so that all he can hear is his own stupid, weak sniffling and hitching breath.
When he realizes the seconds of staring have turned into minutes, he shakes himself. If he's going to move forward from what happened last night, he needs to act friggin'
Gritting his teeth, he yanks himself out of the stupid squeaky chair and pushes open the grimy glass door, breathing in and relishing the fact that he’s at least getting a
The clock on the oven reads 6:04 when he creeps downstairs and looks around for something to do. Castiel is not awake yet. The tile is cool under his bare feet, and outside the large kitchen window he can see the sky just beginning to lose the darkness of night, the clouds gray and heavy and low, full of snow. He shivers a little, but the house is warm enough that he doesn’t think too much about what the snow might feel like on him instead.
Castiel just scoffs, like he genuinely doesn’t think that any of that impossible stuff qualifies as kindness. He
Benny chuckles. “You look like you’d have trouble fighting your way out of a wet paper sack, kid. The stare-down probably isn’t the technique you want to go for.”
When he finally pulls away, Cas unboxes the cushions with exacting precision, in the same methodical way he seems to do everything. There’s two; one a dark green that looks too much like the pillow he still sometimes carts around to be a coincidence, and another that's a similar shade of blue.
but Charlie beats him to the punch. “Look,” she continues, sounding a little bit nervous all of a sudden. “I didn’t want to tell you this because I didn’t want to… I don’t know, set you off on a self-destructive spiral or something,” she half jokes. “But I figure it’s better than you driving out there. I found a number for the place.”
“I’ve only spoken in person to your brother a few times,” he says slowly. “So I don’t know him all that well. But Castiel does, and he tells me enough. And you know what one of the few things I
He knows that he’s staring at her and knows he probably looks like a scared rabbit. She studies him. “Would you prefer to lay down on the island, or–”
for telling him what to do. “It… it helped. So, you know. I’ll let it slide, this time,” he jokes, though it comes out strained, and he knows he’s probably red to the tips of his ears.
Dean sits back on the coffee table slowly, his back to Cas. Picks up the small, beaded chain and cups it in his palm. It must have fallen out of the alpha’s pocket.
that he doesn’t understand. It’s heady, invigorating. He feels like the world around him has narrowed to just this; just Dean. His soft breathing. The rhythmic stroke of Castiel’s thumb against his nape. The very scent of him, heady and intoxicating; vanilla and apples and flaky, sweet pastries.
But Dean’s jaw just tenses further, the revulsion and terror in his scent far from the calm, gentle fragrance Castiel wreathed himself in before going to sleep. And, despite that fear, Dean doesn’t pull away. Doesn’t apologize or plead. He doesn’t even cover his neck, like he’s done so often in the past. That scares Castiel more than anything.
Across from them, Cas relaxes very slightly, the soft notes of warning that had started to creep into his scent fading. Dean shoots him a grateful look, and Cas nods back at him, his expression strained but his eyes gentle as always.
Dean blinks, the bright flame of his anger extinguishing. He hadn’t exactly expected an apology, but the kid sounds genuine. She worries at the hem of her shirt, jaw tight. “Just. You know. Sometimes, alphas ain’t what they say they are. Sometimes they promise you the world, and then they…”
something you have any control over. It will be over in a few days, and we will get through it just fine.” He smooths a hand through Dean’s hair and adds, “Nothing between us is going to change, Dean. Not because of this.”
Without a word, Balthazar abruptly stands up and goes to the car. For a wild moment, Sam thinks he’s about to leave – instead, he slings open the passenger door and pulls out the cat carrier. Sam realizes, with a guilty start, that he’d forgotten the thing was even
and then he’s surging up to press his nose on Castiel’s scent gland just behind his ear, his breath hot against the sensitive spot. It makes him shiver, something curling at the base of his spine.
Balthazar holds his gaze for a few more seconds before he finally breaks his scalding glare away, rubbing at his temples with a frustrated huff.
Dumb of him, to think he’d get to enjoy himself without being punished for it. Dean should know better than to pretend he deserves anything less. He knows he’d done the wrong thing, but before John had walked in the door he’d just about managed to convince himself otherwise.
He takes a steadying breath and regrets it immediately, the lingering scent of his master’s anger still thick in the air. Dizzy, he closes his eyes and wraps his arms around himself.
For just a moment, the robotic mask he’s wearing wavers. “Breakfast,” he answers, voice more raw than it has been all morning. The clarity lasts for only a moment, because in the next, Dean’s hands tighten into fists and his mask slams back down like a floodgate closing.
He’s lucky John hadn’t been able to smell those alphas on him, because the beating he’d have received would probably have killed him. No son of
When they’d finally stumbled into the house, Dean had reached out and squeezed his arm – a silent plea to be put down. So he’d gently lowered him to the floor, had steadied him as he’d found his balance. And Dean had stepped away from him, arms limp at his sides, his gait a little stumbling.
Sam opens his mouth to tell her just that. Really, he does. But all that comes out is a half aborted little sound, so small that it’s a wonder she even hears it.
“Married, huh?” he said, aiming for joking and coming off as more strangled than anything. “Wonder what gave the kid that idea.”
Cas frowns at the lack of enthusiasm in his voice, but he visibly decides to let his question go without it being asked or answered. “The grounds around the house are extensive,” he says, needlessly. Dean has not seen any signs of life other than birds and squirrels since he arrived here – it’s obvious that they’re secluded, and he’s been grateful for it. “It’s been a while since I’ve been out and about on my usual trails. We could do some exploring later, but I figured we’d stick to the lake for now.”
“What about other symptoms?” Cas asks, his voice rumbling and serious. Dean half wonders if he’s going to start taking notes.
For the first time since arriving, he’s alone in the den and not choking on his own terror or passed out from exhaustion. He takes the opportunity to look around. The place is… nice. Warm and dark and spacious, shelves of books all over the place. Aside from that, though, the room is largely empty. There are no pictures on the walls, no art, none of the personal detritus and bric-a-brac that usually makes up a person’s home.
He moves slowly so that Dean isn’t surprised when he drapes the blanket over his shoulders – though he does jump a little when he sets the pillow in front of him. After a moment, the omega lets out a long breath and picks it up with a little hitching motion.
Cas gets a clue somewhere in the middle of his hysterical giggle, the expression on his face clearing into something apologetic. “I didn’t know he’d be an alpha,” he says guiltily.
he reacted like that, logically – knows that this is the first time he’s been around an unfamiliar alpha since that creep in the parking garage. Knows that his body isn’t used to it, anymore, and that the only thing he’s built to expect from alpha men
about the comfort of the residents. The little stalls next to the piles have some pretty obvious utility, too; he steps inside of one and locks the door before he changes.
He’s quiet for so long that Castiel thinks he’s fallen asleep – he himself is well on his way – but Dean’s soft words startle him back awake.

Dean’s hand on his wing startled him. He jumped, whipping to the side just in time to see the man pull back, an alarmed look on his face.
runaway slaves don’t always make it through recapture, let alone ones that are as emaciated and weak – and likely injured – as Dean is. Not to mention the fact that Dean is barefoot, and it’s snowing, and the tracker in his collar will get him caught in no time at all even though Castiel wouldn’t report him missing.
“I very much doubt he’s planning on going anywhere,” Castiel replies. He presses his closed lips to the crown of Dean’s head, and the omega hums happily; Castiel can’t find the will to feel guilty about that even with Dean’s brother less than a dozen feet away. “Should I invite him to stay with us?”
Dean feels his world narrow to a pinprick as he takes in the alpha in the doorway, gripping the frame. He takes another stumbling step away from them both, then another, till he’s in the middle of the room. His chest is heaving.
wants him to, because he wants to be better for Sam and for Bobby. But he’s pretty damn sure he’s beyond fixing, no matter what Cas says.
He pulls his phone out of his front pocket. Miraculously, it still has a charge. He presses it into Dean’s slightly trembling hand. Castiel wants to reassure him further, to
tags, Dean. Metal, embossed tags, on a chain. Completely removable, when they aren’t needed. You can take them off whenever you want.”
Castiel had tried to reassure him tells him that the kid’s reaction is his fault. He’s doing an awful job at making the omega feel safe and secure.
As glad as he is that Dean has finally decided to try out therapy, Castiel is concerned about his motivations. He thinks he understands, to an extent, how the man’s brain works – understands that Dean is far more easily motivated to do things for other people than he is to do them for himself. But hearing him state it so plainly – that he was only willing to go because it would be helping Castiel, would be helping his
So, naturally, there’d been a flood of slaves on the local market. Novak Rehabilitation and Reintegration had purchased every one they could, pushing their resources to the limit. They’d gone
Cas’s mouth drops open in protest, and he sits up straighter and gets a little more into Dean’s space with his wild dark hair and intense eyes, and Dean
The omega rests his chin against his knees. He’s silent for a long time. “How come you’re sitting on the floor?”
Castiel might have nixed the idea right there and then. Might have gently explained that he was under no obligation to do this. Might have chased Dean back to his own bed and sat on the floor next to him instead, offering his presence
Dean closes his eyes, another arc of fear ripping through him, just strong enough to touch him through the distance. “I’m sorry.”
Cas winces. “A… a danger to anyone else. They have to be sure that you won’t... ” he swallows, eyes flicking away, “That you aren’t planning to…”
“I can see he didn’t tell you,” he observes needlessly. He doesn’t know if he’s irritated with his friend, or pleased. On the one hand, the tale could have been a good way to earn the kid’s trust – on the other, he’s grateful his life story isn’t being paraded around without his permission.
“Oh, please,” Balthazar says snidely, his anger really starting to seep through. “You thought you’d be able to watch him at every moment? You thought you’d be enough? Did you
There were so many other slaves with him in that auction house, just in the little hall his cell had been in. He’d heard them. Heard the crying – the wailing, desperate sobs of the new slaves, the hitching and muffled tears of the old ones. The yelling and threatening of the ones still in denial about their fate and the broken pleading of the ones who knew better than to think they’d receive any mercy. So many who needed help, so many that could actually have a
he has to warn John before it’s too late. If they catch his dad off guard, Dean’s honestly not sure who will win – his dad is a mean
He shakes his head, mouth twisting to the side in a sad little smile. “I have lived on my own for a very long time. I think I am capable of caring for myself, should the need arise.”
The alpha blinks for a moment, but he eventually does. His shoulders relax a little, and he leans back into the couch cushions almost forcefully.
“Yeah, well,” Dean said eloquently, linking arms with the angel as they started climbing the hill at a much slower pace. “I gather their home life ain’t exactly a dream.”
After they’re both done, Dean feels like he could sleep for a week. Cas looks like he could do the same.
He trails his fingers over his neck, up and down in a self soothing motion. And his fucking hand is shaking.
isn’t enough, that the other omegas Castiel has worked to help aren’t important to him. And he’s ashamed to say he’s never thought of it that way before. That’s not how he feels – he knows that every life is precious, knows that every soul is valuable.
Cas just lets himself be moved, unprotesting, though he looks extremely confused. “I will see you tomorrow, Samandriel,” he calls out before the door closes behind them. “Please don’t forget to help Jody with intake when she arrives.”
Novak. You’re taking that black sheep thing seriously, huh? The Morningstar fam’ know anything about this?”
want to be doing this, he’s here anyway. Because this is not about him. This is about the enslaved man that has had his life cut apart, excised, and documented coldly on the paper in the file next to him.
Dean steps forward, muscles taut, and he hates himself for his fear. He’s afraid to sleep in a fucking
alpha-omega pair. Doesn’t add that, from an outside perspective, it would appear that they were in a relationship based on this conversation alone.
at the implication that he would ever do something so heinous. He’d been outraged that anyone could think that of him, let alone

his sleeves rolled up over his forearms, his shirt partially unbuttoned, his hair perfectly styled, even in the light breeze. It’s only the lemon-sharp scent of his lingering distress that gives away just how good of an actor he is.
Castiel’s heart drops at the word. He swallows. There’s no way of knowing what’s going on inside Dean’s head right now, but it can’t be anything pleasant. Not with the way fear has rapidly begun to poison his scent completely. Selfishly, he hopes that Dean is seeing someone
“I will wash them,” Castiel says firmly, and Dean swallows thickly at the sound of his tone, still slipping into
Dean’s shoulders slump. There’s no point in being angry – he knows better than that by now. He doesn’t have a choice, as per usual, and this isn’t even a big deal anyway. He shouldn’t have said a word. He takes a breath, and waits for the next blow.
Dean’s brain skittered to a halt. “What do you mean?” he asked slowly, feeling only a hair less guilty.
He’s known Cas well enough to understand that for a while, now, and Dean hates himself for never being brave enough to acknowledge it. Hates himself for being, somehow,
Dean stiffens. He turns around, already glaring, and Balthazar has to suppress a grin. “That’s got nothing to do with Cas,” he snaps.
without stuttering. He flushes, embarrassment and self hatred growing like weeds inside of him, greedy and hungry, ready to suffocate him at a moment’s notice. But Cas’s cool palm drops from his head to his cheek, and rests there until he opens his eyes again.
Dean doesn’t smile at his weak attempt at humor, but his shoulders do relax a little more. Castiel counts that as a victory.
intentionally neglected to mention it, perhaps he’d been right to do so. Castiel had instantly – and apparently, predictably – overreacted.
Now, more than ever, he’s glad that Jody, Balthazar, Benny, and Pamela are the ones who actually run the place while he sits in the background and handles the finances. Glad that he’s never had to do this before, glad that no omega has had to suffer under his care before Dean.
That’s the only thing that Castiel can comprehend when the handlers lead him forward, a collar and leash around his neck like he’s actually going to try to run. As if the concrete walls and locked metal doors all over this God-forsaken place would afford him
Dean could happily spend the rest of his days just like this. After all, it’s the happiest he’s been in years, the
All he knows is that it makes him edge closer, makes him kneel carefully in front of the alpha. A scant few inches from Cas’s face, he stays there for a good long while. He even leans and tips over till he’s sitting, instead of kneeling, and rests his chin on the couch cushions.
his distant father was in the business of slavery, known exactly how he made his money. And of course, as a child, he hadn’t really cared. There’d been no slaves where he was raised – only paid employees to clean and cook and raise him. So it had been a distant problem, something that he knew, in the back of his mind, was wrong, but didn’t care much about because it hadn’t affected him.
skilled in. He hasn’t looked at Dean in that way even once, from what he can tell. Hasn’t touched him other than the one time, hasn’t groped or grabbed or slapped. Hasn’t ordered him to his knees or pointed to his own zipper with a smirk or held him down with careless, heavy hands. Hasn’t even touched himself while looking, something lots of alphas that hadn’t even owned him had done in the past.
“In the kitchen, Dean,” Cassie says. His voice has taken on a subtle, soothing tone. “Balthazar is here, too.”
He realizes that he’s been silent for way too long, and clears his throat. He’s gambling, but he figures that Cas might want him within earshot when he
Embarrassed, Sam follows him up the creaking porch steps with his armload of groceries, trying not to trip and fall on his face. The omega slips a key into the lock with practiced ease, not even bothering to knock on the door, and strides inside and straight to the kitchen. It’s obvious he’s familiar with the place. Obviously, he’s been here many times – he moves out of the kitchen as Sam sets down his own bags, confident and sure of himself.
“I’m always in pain,” he blurts, scared, suddenly, that he’s going to go back to that awful period of limbo from before, where all he could do was trail Cas around the house and sleep. “Always a little, at least. That’s
Balthazar glances at him. “Oh, you know. This and that,” he says vaguely. “I’m afraid you won’t be able to see most of the facility right now – alphas make the residents nervous. You understand.”
Dean nods. He stumbles to his feet, nearly losing his balance, and Castiel physically restrains himself from lunging forward to grab him – he doesn’t want a repeat of what happened out in the yard. Dean finds his bearings and holds his plate and fork and cup against his chest with one hand, looking around for the sink. “Don’t worry about that,” Castiel says quickly. “Just leave them on the table.”
“Because you shouldn’t have to wear it,” Castiel says quietly, very careful to be still, to keep his tone even. “Because you’re a person, not an animal, and you shouldn’t have to be constantly reminded of your circumstances. Because you don’t deserve it,” he finishes, and his voice breaks a little despite his effort for it not to.
The omegas at the center have no singular owner – they are purchased as company slaves, owned by the organization as a whole. So it had, once Bal had explained it to him, made sense that they would be nervous about their security, anxious to let others know that they were owned by
It takes a moment for Castiel to understand what Dean is talking about. He stares at him for a second until it clicks into place, and all the while, Dean munches calmly, sprawled out in a comfortable heap. It is an image that is sharply juxtaposed with his memory of Balthazar, still bright after all these years – the hatred in his eyes, the cold press of steel against his throat.
Cas inhales and exhales a few times. It’s slow. Even. It makes Dean feel a little bit less like he’s going to suffocate. “Okay. That’s okay,” he says. “You don’t have to be alright.”
don’t apologize to omegas. But Cas does, and he clearly means it. So Dean nods, picks his fork back up, and ignores how fast his heart is beating as he finishes his breakfast.
It’s hard to speak past whatever is squeezing his throat. When he does open his mouth, he realizes that he can’t find the words to express how much that means to him, and at the same time how scared he is that Dean feels so strongly. How scared he is that those feelings are not even real, and are the product of some hormonal drive that neither of them can really control.
That it took time and effort, and that there was no such thing as a snapped-finger, magic moment where you found the one for you.
Sam has nothing to say to that. He pushes his hands into his pockets, and follows Castiel out of the gym silently, his mouth pressed into a thin line.
The omega snorts, shaking his head. “That’s a Christmas movie, Cas.” At his blank stare, he tacks on, “It’s
“He did. Or,” he hesitates, “I mean. I think he did. He got through most of it, but I might have missed some stuff.” His phone lights up on the table in front of him as he speaks, and of course it’s Cas. Probably wondering if he’s still alive, or if Claire has eaten him.
Dean interrupted. “Take it from me, okay? You can’t start thinking like that. That demon did what demons
way to get him out. Now, ten years later, Cas couldn’t exactly bring himself to regret the decision of permanently tying himself to a human. To Dean. He didn’t regret it, except when it came to his wings.
Just wants to be left alone, and he’ll do anything to get that, anything he has to, anything his master wants.
Castiel’s heart aches for him, a pang so deep that it feels like a dagger in his chest. Dean so desperately wants to believe he’s safe, and so clearly cannot, and it’s tearing him apart. Even now, he’s hyperventilating, his hands fisted in Castiel’s shirt, his head pressed to his chest while his body jumps and shivers at the contact, waiting for pain that isn’t going to come.
“Yes,” Castiel replies gently, and his failure to rise to Dean’s bait pisses him off and embarrasses him in equal measure. “Nesting is a very basic omega instinct, one you should be quite familiar with at this point in your life. The fact that you aren’t isn’t your fault,” he adds, when Dean
It had taken him about thirty seconds to realize he couldn’t do it. To realize that killing Castiel – a truly
he should want. And, all at once, he decides he isn’t going to let Dean deny himself the help that he so tentatively requested only a few short hours ago.
For once, it’s not unpleasant. It’s soft, and it’s warm, and it smells like a thunderstorm and honeysuckle, and he can only half recall what exactly he’d been dreaming about. Whatever it was, it’s nice enough that he drifts into consciousness with a smile on his face, a pleasant sort of tingling running through him.
that’s not appropriate,” he adds, voice a little strangled, “but it’s the truth, and I don’t want to lie to you.”
“Huh,” Bobby says, not looking up from his paper. “They must’a called twice, then. I answered the second time. They did the same thing to me.”
The whole time, Cas kept his eyes fixed on Dean, who, for his part, didn’t know what to look at. He wanted it all. To see the arousal flashing in Cas’s eyes. To watch as he writhed under his own attention. To see his tongue dart out and swipe across his bottom lip. He wanted
He shuffles to his feet and Dean flinches back again despite himself, curling down over his stomach to protect it like he’s done a million times in the past. But his master doesn’t kick him, doesn’t reach down and yank on his collar to put him exactly where he wants. He doesn’t even
But he doesn’t say any of that. Instead, he retrieves a plate from the cabinet and silently splits the frankly enormous stack of flapjacks, smiling as he hands Dean his portion. “Lucky for us, you made more than enough for two. They look delicious.”
There’s a short dock that extends out into the water, far enough outside the tree cover that it’s completely in the sunshine.
It really shouldn’t surprise him, he thinks. There is nothing about Dean that isn’t deserving of love. He is kind, and brave, and selfless, and he’s beautiful inside and out. He’s strong, and that strength… it fills Castiel with longing, with something aching and wonderful and bright, every time he looks at Dean and sees it in his eyes. He doesn’t know how he could know Dean and
Dean has not actually laid down, he’s realizing. In fact, he feels more tense than he had before he’d given up and gone downstairs. He’s not sure why that is, exactly, only that he–
Somehow, he hadn’t really thought that far. He’d assumed that Dean wouldn’t be capable of deciding much of
“Just want to be sure all your equipment is up and running, kiddo,” she says patiently, smiling – he decides that Cas couldn’t have said anything, because she’d probably be using kiddy-gloves if he had. “It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Things like that are completely natural.”
his shaking fingers causing him to have to backspace and edit his search twice. Castiel is frozen with anticipation, excited to
Castiel winces. Traditionally, they tend not to tell omegas that their ultimate goal is freedom right away. That hadn’t been his decision – he’d been ready to tell them from day one. But at the urging of both Balthazar and Benny, he’d changed that particular policy. Omegas at the center only learn they are there to be freed when they are comfortable. When they trust the staff. It usually takes upwards of a couple of weeks, sometimes three.
“And you’ll call me with updates twice a day,” Pamela adds, clearly not asking. “I think he’s strong enough physically to get through this, but if he starts to take a turn, I need to know ASAP.”
And I’ve got no doubt he’s going to struggle with his libidio as much as you are – if not more. He likes you. That’s pretty damn obvious.”
Eventually, he starts to relax. He leans against the side of the desk, resting his temple on it, as out of proper position as he’ll allow himself to get. He can just barely see Castiel’s legs from here, and it’s a relief to be out of the man’s direct line of sight even if he’s still very close to him.
It’s that thought that makes him get up, finally. Makes him traipse down the stairs to hide the evidence of his disobedience, scraping his food into the trash. Watching the uneaten sandwich tumble into the garbage makes him feel a little hysterical.
he slides out of Dean’s grasp. The omega makes an unhappy noise when he pulls away, but he doesn’t wake. Instead, he curls into himself, tightening his arms around his chest. Mindful of the doctor’s eyes on him, he tugs a blanket around Dean’s shoulders, smoothing his hair back from his face in a gentle movement that Dean leans into, even in his sleep. He lets out a small sigh that makes Cas’s heart ache fiercely.
Castiel feels tears pricking in his own eyes, but he ignores them, pressing one hand to Dean’s shoulder and the other to the back of his head, holding him close. He shakes his head. “There is nothing to apologize for.” And he means it, whether Dean is apologizing for toppling the bookshelf or for forgetting he is safe or for needing reassurance. “Nothing at all.”
He can’t scent any lust on the man, but that doesn’t mean shit. He can’t smell much of anything over the acrid stench of his own terror – hell, even the achingly familiar scent of coffee is hardly filtering in. He realizes that his master has not said anything and he clenches his fists. He’s already done enough that’s wrong, clearly, and now the alpha is probably sizing up how best to kick the shit out of him and teach him his place, how he wants to remind Dean of how
All the while, Dean reaches out. Touches, nearly constantly – brushes a hand here, leans against him there. And though he is, at first, silent more often than he was before, he soon begins to joke. Begins to try and find his footing.
“Come on, you know him,” Sam insists, and though he’s so much older, the mischief in his eyes looks exactly the same. “He thinks retirement’s a dirty word. Still works too hard, never takes enough breaks.”
The woman’s expression does not change – Sam feels his stomach sink down to somewhere near the footwell. “Of
Dean shakes his head. Somehow, he keeps forgetting that Cas grew up with money - probably because he doesn't
struggles to believe he’s capable, so how can he begrudge doubt to anyone else? If he’s concerned about how defensive he’d been over Dean, how can Castiel fault him for that either?
Those words hit a little too close, make him feel a little too vulnerable. It sort of feels like he’s been slapped, but not in an unpleasant way; a blush is starting to spread across his cheeks.
Claire grins sharply at him, feinting to the side – Dean just barely catches the trick and ducks in the right direction, avoiding the sweeping kick that probably would have taken his legs out from under him. At this point, he’s not thinking about anything that Gadreel had asked them to do. He’s running on instinct, on training that was beaten into him – literally and figuratively – when he was just a kid by a rightfully paranoid father. He dances to the side a few more times, and the more he dodges the more frantic Claire’s punches seem to become.
all his attention  focused instantly on Dean instead. The rage vanishes from his expression like someone flipped a switch, and in its place is something so raw and hopeful that it’s painful to look at. Like the sun.
Benny tips his head to the side when Dean stays silent. “We don’t need to talk about that right now, if you don’t want to.”
Castiel can’t help but blink harshly at that. Can’t help but feel a dizzying degree of relief that he’d been there, that he hadn’t been completely spineless and elected not to go to the auction house after all. Where would Dean be now, if he had? The possibility frightens him more than he can say.
Dean finally seems to realize that his food has arrived. He snaps out of his concentrated focus on his nest, a small grin springing to his face. “I’m being crazy,” he announces as he picks up his plate.
Dean opens his mouth to make a quip about how he’s just mainlined about a pot and a half of Castiel’s jet fuel, so it ain’t a
“I’m sorry,” Cas says after a while. His voice has lost its rigidity. “I shouldn’t have taken that tone with you, especially right now.”
Castiel laughs a little, but he complies; after a moment’s hesitation, he maneuvers Dean until he’s got his arm wrapped around his shoulders. Dean’s a big fan – no doubt about it – but he needs a little more, so he just slumps until he’s pretty much horizontal, his body still wrapped in the blanket enough that he’s got a flimsy barrier between himself and Cas. When he drops his cheek against Cas’s thigh, facing away, the alpha just rests his arm against Dean’s chest and holds his hand, the long line of it warm against his ribs. He can’t suppress a pleasant shiver when his other hand reaches up to card through his hair.
If there had been any other path to try, Castiel never would have risked this with Dean. But something inside of him had
was, but he hadn’t asked any questions. Not even when Dean had another dizzy spell and nearly fell out of the car – Cas just caught him, his brow furrowed when Dean had laughed it off.
Defeated. They feel like a punch to the heart. Dean’s voice trembles. “I shouldn’t have said anything – I didn’t mean to. I told myself I wouldn’t, but – fuck, I didn’t
Dean blinked. Scott looked away from him, but not before Dean could see their lower lip trembling. He stayed quiet, just waiting the kid out.
Dean flushes scarlet, dropping his eyes to the floor. Even from all the way over there, the other omega can apparently scent his fear. He hates it, hates how little control he seems to have over his emotions and his scent these days.
Dean half laughs. It's a nice thought, but even if he hadn’t signed himself over, he wouldn’t have been able to avoid being hurt – his dad had been doing it long before anyone had paid to. But he doesn’t want to talk about that, and he thinks the alpha has an idea of some of the shit his dad had done anyway, so he pushes those thoughts away.
He settles down against the couch, already more at ease with Cas’s scent curling around him. Eyes drooping, he relaxes, listening to the faint noises of Cas bumbling around in the kitchen, the low murmur of the television in front of him, nearly inaudible.
Shit. He’s supposed to be eating more, and he’s already failed miserably. How will his master punish him for that? He has no idea what he’ll default to – maybe a whip? He hasn’t seen one, but that doesn’t mean anything. He swallows.
Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Your wings needed some straightening out, and I helped because it seemed like you were okay with me helping. You didn’t take shit from me. I’m here because I want to be.”
asking, and his hands only shake a little as he feels the phantom weight of the alpha’s gaze on him.
Heart aching, Castiel looks across the couch at the man he loves. Watches as his chest heaves, as his fists clench at his sides. As exhausted as he is, Dean still has the wherewithal to defend his brother. Even just the memory of him.
He’s twelve. In the Impala, with his dad. Dean hasn’t hit much of a growth spurt – hasn’t hit puberty. He’s not an
By the time he returns with their food, Dean has made himself comfortable – or, as comfortable as he’s willing to be – next to the sofa, leaning against it as he’d done on the desk. He straightens when Castiel enters the room, confusion palpable when he passes right by the couch to go into his office.
Some of that anger must translate to his scent, because Dean leans away from him, a faint whiff of nervousness twisting through the room. The trace of his smile evaporates.
But the thought of being so exposed, of putting every mark and scar and fucked up part of him on display… it makes a wave of nausea wash over him, leaving an unpleasant chill in its wake. He takes a deep breath. Wraps his arms around himself.
Relief pulses from Dean like a wave, and his expression crumples like a dry sandcastle. He doesn’t hesitate before picking up his green pillow and joining Castiel across the room.
He pushes away the certainty that he is not cut out for this and tries to focus. Thirty seconds of picking through Dean’s file had been enough to convince him to swallow his discomfort and misgivings about being responsible for someone so fragile – he’d given in to Jody’s attempts to sway him far before her steam had run out. The photo of Dean taped into the documentation from the latest auction house had hit him like a kick to the chest, and he tries to keep that photo in his mind’s eye now.
But Dean just chokes out a miserable laugh, his composure beginning to fray in earnest. And Castiel regrets that. As much as he needs to make this clear to Dean, he hates that he also seems to be taking away the serenity that had settled on the omega’s shoulders after going down. He wishes that hormonal high could last a little longer. That Dean’s life could be uncomplicated.
young, even though the haunted look in his eyes is enough to tell Castiel that Dean has suffered enough for a hundred of his lifetimes.
“You mean… I can read?” He stares at Castiel, and Castiel stares back, so he clarifies. “Like, I can… You would let me touch your books?”
And it is. Dean brings it everywhere, the thought of going back to kneeling on the unforgiving ground unthinkable once he has a taste for softness. He sits on his little pillow, trying not to feel like a prized pet, while Cas works or cooks or watches the news, and at the end of the day he and Cas go up to their room together and sleep. It’s easily the most comfortable he’s ever been, and not nearly as embarrassing as he anticipated.
into the complicated green of his eyes. Dean… trusted him. Without really thinking about it, Cas pulled his wings up and partially out of the water. They dripped, sopping wet, and the water droplets made little plinking sounds as they joined the lake again. One wing stretched out and bumped against Dean’s arm. The arm with the scar of a handprint on the shoulder.
he scolds, though there’s no real weight to it. More like he’s mortified by being caught having some not-so-saintly thoughts.
Dean isn’t asleep – not exactly. But he might as well be in a coma for how responsive he is. Castiel is careful to keep still, to keep his breathing even and calm even though he suspects that a train could barrel past the house and Dean would remain undisturbed. Eyes half-closed, one hand curled loosely into Castiel’s shirt, the other still cupping the back of his neck. He is, quite simply,
I thought about dividing this chapter into two, but I couldn't find a split I was happy with. So... enjoy a slightly longer than normal chapter, slightly earlier than usual!
“I know,” Dean reassures him, knocking his shoulder into Cas’s. He rests his head on the man’s shoulder, snuggling a little deeper into his jacket and sighing contentedly at the smell and warmth of familiar comfort. “I know, Cas.”
Cas smiles. “I’ll go and get ready.” He pauses, frowns. “My shoes will be large on you, I think, but they’ll do until we can find something in your size.” Then he hesitates, looking at Dean carefully. “I also have a pair of jeans that may just fit you, at least with a belt, and a winter jacket. They’re both freshly washed, but…”
It took a moment for Dean to realize the kid was crying with soft, hitching sobs. He said something, but it was too quiet to understand.
Castiel finds himself blinking rapidly, finds that his eyes suddenly sting. He finally reaches out and holds Dean’s hand in turn, cupping his palm between his own. Dean says it so easily, an edge of self-conscious laughter in his voice – he clearly sees nothing wrong with what Castiel has done, other than that it seems to embarrass him. The intensity of the hope inside him is shocking, but he can’t assume Dean truly understands.
It’s only the sharp blast of the whistle that makes her falter. They both look up at Gadreel across the gym, gasping for air as sweat drips down their faces.
Castiel curses himself for his careless comment. Dean’s pleas to not be left outdoors make perfect, sickening sense – what he’s describing had clearly not been the first time he’d been hurt in that way,
“I guess,” he finally says, instead of the argument he wants to have. “But, you know. Jo’s alright. A pistol, like always.”
He lies horizontally on the couch, resting his head on the armrest and a small, square pillow. From the opposite end, Dean looks at him with an exhausted sort of bemusement. “C’mere,” Castiel coaxes, and, still slightly hesitant, Dean does.
Dean leaned back against the empty desk across from the man, letting his eyes drift to Cas again as Sam did all the work. Sue him for being a little distracted – it was rare that Cas stuck around into the daytime, and Dean found that he’d missed him and his dorky shoes.
Dean blinks harshly. “You can’t… don’t do it for me,” he says desperately, praying to God Cas knows what he means. “I don’t want you to do that just for me.” Because he
He trails off. Takes a breath. “My mother was an accidental conquest, I believe. An affair. I don’t actually know, because she was not around either – I was told that she passed away shortly after I was born. I think that he felt responsible for me financially because he was my sire, and because the media had gotten wind of the affair, but past that he wasn’t interested in raising me – nor was his wife, understandably. So I lived with nannies and tutors and grew up away from my half siblings.”
Dean has spent over a decade living with the weight of those choices. With the guilt of them. He’s held it in his chest; radioactive material that has slowly eaten through him. He’d accepted the consequences of his mistakes a long time ago – had been prepared to die for them, if he’s being honest with himself.
been in danger of something like that. Alastair had liked to taunt him, had liked to scrape his teeth over the soft skin of Dean’s neck and threaten to bite down hard enough to draw blood. It would have been the ultimate way to control him, the ultimate way to make sure that Dean could
Dean swallows, nods, and Pamela’s face softens into something even more gentle. She doesn’t need to remind him not to lie – it’s all he can fucking think about. He’d gone back and forth in his head in the hours before her arrival about whether it would be better to keep his weaknesses to himself, or come clean. But telling the truth will show his master he
But he’s going to have to suck it up, if he’s going to play this part. So he pushes forward, trying to pass his hesitance off as simple embarrassment. “Uh, well. You know. I’m a bachelor, and I’m pretty busy at work.”
Heat rises in his cheeks. He’s glad Balthazar can’t see him. “It’s the first time he’s done anything like that,” he says quickly. “It surprised me.”
to play with – he’d been isolated from everyone but those sick alphas completely. Instead of an off-duty slave passing out his portion of food, he’d had Alastair tossing down his bowl; instead of two or three other omegas to rest with and commiserate with, he’d had only himself and his demons, if not a
Without answering his question, Balthazar steps a bit closer. Confused, Castiel watches as the omega leans forward and takes a cautious sniff. It’s not until he narrows his eyes, looking up into his with a hard, suspicious stare, that he understands
Dean cocks his head to the side, brow furrowed, but as smart as he is it doesn’t take him long to put two and two together. And rather than the fear or the disgust or the
Castiel has to blink back tears, at that. It’s a relief to hear. But when he opens his mouth to say something – to thank Dean, to reassure him further – the omega is already asleep.
Dean can’t help the burning pressure in the back of his eyes, the tears that threaten to escape him at that. He stares up at the ceiling, tries furiously to keep it together. He’d never doubted that Sam had loved him, but he’d also, somewhere
like he had all those weeks ago, like he’s sure Castiel is one step away from grabbing him and forcing him to–
when he walks back inside, even though it should have dissipated. It makes Castiel’s head spin more than a little. Makes him
With a growl, he dug his fingers into a matted, dusty clump, and yanked. The pain was immediate and stinging, but also, somehow, allowed him to finally breathe. Allowed the cool library air to wash over the newly exposed skin like a balm.
Dean dug his phone out of his pocket, tapping the screen to show off the date. Scott looked, searchingly, as if they were hoping to see that it was all a prank. “How long have you been AWOL, kid?”
When they finally make it to his room, they stand in front of the bed for a moment. Dean stares at the mattress like it’s a live crocodile.
It makes something like anger flicker to life in him even now. Makes something like grief claw at his chest. Tear him to shreds from the inside out. Dean has never, not once in his
he’s angry. Even now, in the midst of it, he suspects it’s because he’d be crying if he wasn’t. “Just – don’t, Cas.”
Claire snorts. “Some. Some I already knew. Used to get into a lot of fights as a kid,” she says, the shadow of a hungry expression on her face. Dean has no problem imagining her as a trouble-maker, with her dark eyeliner and savage smile. Her take-no-shit attitude. “But, yeah. He taught me some tricks.”
He picks the phone back up and unlocks it, and, after a slight moment more of hesitation, Dean takes it. His eyes fly over the text as he scrolls, and when he gets to the end of the article, he just stares at the screen.
The older omega breathes a long suffering sigh and makes a face, rolling his eyes as the doors open to the elevator. “Good luck with all that,” he says vaguely, waving them off as he walks away. “You two are disastrous.”
The looming concrete building of the auction house has all the sterile, brutal indifference of any government facility of its ilk, and Castiel finds the hair on the back of his neck standing at attention as he passes through the barbed wire fencing on the way in – a barrier that is not meant to keep people out, but keep people
He’d managed to forget that he’s got his arm wrapped around the alpha up until this moment, when Cas shifts and lets out a soft sigh. He doesn’t let go, even though instinct tells him he maybe should, and he knows he made the right choice when Cas nuzzles down into his hair with a soft noise of contentment.
Dean’s eyes flash, the anger returning to his scent like the lash of a whip. And Castiel is prepared to deal with it, to work with it, but the anger isn’t directed at him. Dean seems to be livid with
but the sticky, gross feeling all over him spurns him on – as does the new flood of slick between his legs that had come at the sound of the alpha’s warning rumble.
YO! Back at it again with the late chapter y'all, but this one's extra long to make up for it. Many thanks to HD, as per usual 💖
“I don’t think it’s broken,” he protests, frowning. He’d know. He’s plenty familiar with what broken bones feel like.
wanted the juice. So… I said water,” he finishes, something like a laugh slipping out at the end. It sounds too self deprecating to be genuine. “Thought to myself, y’know. Better safe than sorry.”
“I’m.” He chokes on his words, presses his fists down into his thighs to control himself. “God. Cas, I’m so sor–”
Blinking a little harshly, Dean nods. Chews on the inside of his cheek. The blanket stays in his hands – becomes twisted around them, in fact, while he struggles to calm himself down.
He wants Cas to pin him with those cool, steady hands. Wants to feel that grip around his wrists again, around his waist. Wants the alpha’s weight pressed down on top of him, keeping him still, keeping him
Around lunch, Dean stumbles off the couch and disappears upstairs for a shower. When he’s done, he takes one sniff of the air and eyes Castiel suspiciously. “We should eat,” he says pointedly. Castiel takes the hint.
Castiel says bluntly. Sam stops in his tracks. He tries to soften his voice again, tries to be patient. “He
legit?” she all but shouts, the excitement in her voice returning full force. “He – he’s there? Sam! You
“What sort of skill set were you hoping for?” he asks, looking up briefly. There’s a faint smirk on his face.
His scent hits like a metal bat against a windshield. It takes everything in Dean not to gag – it’s metallic, sharp as battery acid, and instantly he knows that this alpha is not here to offer him a friendly hand up or an innocuous greeting. He’s here to
“... Guess not,” the kid admitted reluctantly, wiping his dripping nose on the sleeve of his sweatshirt.
Balthazar’s cavalier tone would bother Castiel if he didn’t know firsthand that it was all bluster. Though he’s a little prickly, Bal is easily the best resource he has in terms of relating to omegas. He cares, and cares deeply, and Castiel knows it. So he takes the man’s words as the reassurance they are and allows some of the unease to trickle out of his chest, and replies in the same light tone.
“Sorry for the birthday suit,” he says, a half-cocked smile on his face, and Cas huffs out a little laugh.
The question is quiet, but frustrated, and Dean’s looking away again. His arms tighten around his knees.
abused the man’s trust by ordering him to do something he hadn’t wanted to do, regardless of how good his intentions had been at the time.
He unlocked their room and stepped inside, trusting that, despite Dean’s best efforts to scare him off, Cas would both follow and lock the door behind them. He tossed his bag onto the only chair and stretched, shoulders popping with the movement, and finally turned to look at the angel.
for a few cycles, at least until your body gets itself back into balance. It should have happened years ago, but…”
He knows basically nothing about the dude. The realization has come over him slowly, over the past few days. Now that he’s not in danger all the time, now that he has time to
He poked his head out of the bathroom, a sassy retort ready on his tongue, but then he just smirked. “He does,” he said cheekily, gesturing behind Sam with his chin.
“The truth, Dean. I’ve no shortage of food and no shortage of funds with which to buy more. It is important to me that you feel secure that you will not ever go hungry.”
Luckily, the older omega just rolls his eyes instead of calling him on his disrespect. “Were you not listening to the rehabilitation part, kid?”
“It…” he clears his throat. “It strengthens our emotional… tether. Meaning that you can sense my mood swings much more clearly than you could otherwise.” He looks up. “I can also sense yours,” he says carefully, watching Dean’s face for any sort of reaction. “And our moods affect each other.”
Slowly, more dizzy than he’d like, Dean sits up. He grimaces at how stiff and sore his muscles feel. Cas, of course, is lying next to him, still dead to the world – he’s splayed out with one of his too long legs thrown over the side of the bed, starfished and taking up the majority of the space on the two combined mattresses, his head turned to the side. Dean doesn’t really mind. He’s been content nestled up in the space that was left, dozing the day away.

He flicks his eyes back at his friend, and says carefully, “Through… feelings of comfort? Familiarity?”
to. That it was his fault, really, for being a temptation – his fault for corrupting otherwise decent people with the scent of his heat. He should have known that it was just another bit of propaganda.
Castiel aches Dean’s confusion, his heart hurting for the young man who has been abused so badly he cannot recognize kindness for what it is.
Dean grimaces. Cuts off the thought. But it makes something warm glow inside of Castiel, makes his heart grow a little bigger in his chest. “I understand.”
Heartbeat thudding in his ears, he doesn’t realize he’s stopped in his tracks until Balthazar eyes him, a slightly wary expression on his face. “Cassie–”
Balthazar hums. “I’m not so sure. Might cause more harm than good to separate you two now.” After a moment, he adds, “More harm to
So when Castiel reaches out to touch him, he jerks back and sucks in an instinctual breath, too wired to stop his knee jerk reaction, and shouts, “Just because
(If you're on a second read through, (excited screeching) don't panic if there are a few changes. I'm slowly going through and fixing typos and such.)
Apparently oblivious to his inner monologue, Benny continues his list. “Four, you agreed to talk to me. In fact, just now, you overcame a considerable, gut-instinct
Dean scoffs. “Believe me, I know,” he says, and though it’s angry, it’s not accusatory. “You’re preaching to the choir. But you have to let that shit go, man,” he continues, shaking his head. “You do too much friggin’ good to keep beating yourself up for something you can’t change.”
It’s yet more evidence that something has fundamentally shifted inside of Dean. The way that he brightens as an alpha that
Distantly, he recognizes how fucking sad that is. But he doesn’t care. Doesn’t have the energy to care. Not anymore.
He’s not sure how Dean will react to him trying to sit next to him on the ground after what happened last night, so he doesn’t do that either.
A pang of guilt manages to reach him through the fog. Cas doesn’t know where he is, he realizes. He’d left the house without so much as a note, and he’s starting to realize that he’s been listening to the phone ring for a long time. He can’t imagine how bad that must have been screwing with the alpha – had he thought Dean had run away?
a place that legitimately helps omegas, they’re not gonna let you within fifty yards of the building.”
Dean nods – he remembers those things, at least, from childhood tv shows and movies. True to her word, there’s no pain, though she frowns at the numbers she sees. When she helps him down from the counter to weigh him on a little scale she pulls from her bag, she shakes her head. “Really have to get some meat on those bones, kid,” she mutters.
Wants to stay with these books and these soft rugs and these warm blankets, wants to stay with Castiel’s safe scent and gentle silence and strange kindness.
As far as Sam knows, everything that’s happening here is against his will. It’s Dean’s job to convince him otherwise.
Dean laughs, the sound soft and breathy against the quiet of the room. Rubbing his hand on his jaw, he’s silent for a long time. Long enough that Castiel feels guilt try and make a nest inside his chest so that it can multiply. But when Dean does speak, his words are not accusatory. Not angry, not even a little.
He pushes open a side door, and they step inside. Skeptical, Sam looks around the recreation wing, studying the various doors that lead into the locker rooms and gyms. It’s clear he doesn’t buy it. Not yet. Castiel is starting to wonder if persistent suspicion is a Winchester genetic trait.
Balthazar says it flatly, nearly no emotion in his tone. But Dean looks up anyway – keen as he is, there’s no way he’s going to miss what that implies. “You?”
Dean makes a dismissive noise. Castiel can see his walls starting to go up, can see him put on his defensive shields. “Not something I
Still bent over on his knees, he shakily pulls his palm into his lap and rips more toilet paper off of the roll to press into his still bleeding mess. Balthazar, mercifully, is silent as he tries to rake his shattered composure back together.
“They… when I was working, they kept them on.” He hopes she won’t ask why, and he doesn’t mention that he was pretty much always “working”. Doesn’t mention that even when the chain was off, the shackles stayed on his wrists; heavy, unwelcome reminders of his place.
It’s obvious that he doesn’t trust Castiel enough to tell him what he wants. Clear that he expects to be treated like a slave even though Castiel has no intention of doing so, that he expects Castiel to twist his desires around to hurt or punish him in some way.
