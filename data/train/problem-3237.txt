“Sounds like an excellent plan,” he answered, leaning into her side in support before they both stood to get back to work.
Unimpressed with this sudden descent into melodrama, Cas whacked Dean on the arm. “You’re not homeless, Dean. You just said, you’re about to go home to see your parents. You know they’d let you stay if you wanted.”
On its face, it was a beautiful night— a beautiful week, really. Romantic uncertainties aside, it felt so good to be trusted in this way, Archangel, to be relied upon for advice, to have my opinions desired and welcomed. But with each confession from Dean my guilt also compounded. He has now shared things with me that no other soul knows, as far as I can tell, and yet here I sit still lying to him. As far as he knows, I grew up with an aunt— I have painted an unadjusted picture of Naomi for him, but still I have claimed her as my own in a way she would no doubt despise. And you, Archangel— with you I have done the same. You who I have dubbed my Distant Uncle of Means, kind enough to fund my studies unseen. Despite the open and vulnerable state Dean has allowed me to witness, still I cannot stand to show him my deepest shame. How can I? This brilliant, tender, strong man has deigned to take me into his confidence— how can I tell him how unworthy I am of such welcome? How utterly alone I am in this world? How little I have to offer him even as a friend, let alone anything more intimate?
Castiel turned away from the door and pulled the quilt up to his chin. As he reached over to turn off the bedside lamp, he couldn’t help but wonder about his own part in their separation. It was true that Dean shouldn’t have abandoned their friendship over a lover—it wasn’t the Middle Ages, moving away did not eliminate the possibility of consistent conversation. And yes, Cas deserved friends who cared enough to keep current on his life, whatever his inner demons might claim. But was that really so different from how Cas had responded to his friend’s absence? He, too, had looked up from his work one day to realize he hadn’t spoken to Dean in nearly a year. And as soon as he came to that realization, as soon as he had realized that Dean hadn’t been in touch either, he was so blinded by betrayal that he’d stayed silent out of spite.
Cas couldn’t decide if this was pain or ecstasy. Most likely both. And either way, it was raising tears in his throat.
The owner of this breathtaking property is one Dr. Charles Shurley. He inherited the estate from a rich father, as I understand it, and immediately locked himself inside to write his first set of novels. Now that I have seen where he wrote that series, I must say that the creeping paranormal quality of the story makes perfect sense. If I were living here alone, I too would come to believe in deadly flesh-eating spirits. I also might come out of the experience, like Chuck, behaving in a manner that is just a tad…let’s say “scattered”. He’s certainly what Hannah would diplomatically call “a character”. But I’m looking forward to learning from his method, if simply as a roadmap to locate inspiration within a world of utter chaos.
“‘Course it does, Cas,” he disagreed, a self-deprecating gleam in his eye. “I’d had an embarrassing crush on you for, like, three years, and I was jealous as fuck.”
Rather amused by this particular turn of events, Castiel raised a teasing eyebrow. “How did I write about him, exactly?”
“Cheryl – er, Lisa’s mom. She’s super immunocompromised. So I keep my distance from Lis and Ben, and just drop stuff off on the back porch for them sometimes if I’ve been at the store. Hence the socially distant babysitting routine tonight.”
Castiel wasn’t sure he was fooled, but he took pity on the man. “That was very thoughtful, Dean. Thank you.”
“One does not, no,” Dean agrees, immensely amused. “But, then, one doesn’t expect to see a lot of things around here that turn out to be very true.”
And thus, the Winchester boys came to spend much of their childhoods in East Jordan, Michigan. John would come and go, but with the Harvelle’s and their friends watching over them, both boys were able to lead at least a stable life, if not a “normal” one. Dean worked at the Roadhouse through high school, then got a full ride scholarship to study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, and Sam graduated valedictorian of his high school, with his eyes set on a law degree. He received a scholarship of his own, and went off to Stanford University to seek his fortunes.
There was no mail slot. Only a small box mounted to the wall with the word “welcome. This envelope would definitively not fit in the mailbox.
Dean winced, but conceded with a guilty expression. “Only barely. I got kinda sad-drunk this past weekend and spilled it all to her, finally. She didn’t know before that, though. And she kicked my ass appropriately hard for being such an idiot all this time.”
“We should get some sleep,” he said, patting Dean once on the thigh before pulling back the covers on his own bed. “Lots to do tomorrow, from what I hear.”
The moment froze as they both sat in the wake of this revelation, Castiel in shock, Dean exuding contrition through his very breath, both of them barely keeping their cool.
Shortly after that fateful poetry reading, I made the mistake of mentioning to Bela that I only owned a single suit, originally purchased off the rack at Kohls, which she proclaimed a “cardinal sin, given the beauty of my physique”. She then teamed up with Meg and Krissy to kidnap me a few weeks ago, and we took a little trip to Gaylord to not only shop for 3 new suits, but then to visit a tailor’s shop as well to have them personally fitted. It was quite a day, let me tell you. And I never thought I’d say this, being largely uninterested in fashion, but when I stepped in front of the mirror in a freshly tailored suit for the first time, I felt rather exceptional. All the ladies were quick to tell me I looked “sharp” (and even “hotter than hell”, in Meg’s case), but more even than that I felt very adult. Even “normal” in a way I never truly achieved in my early life. Something about striding out of the fitting room in a three-piece suit made the future I face, full of publishers and backers and possibly even press interaction, seem much more achievable. Silly, of course – clothes cannot manufacture success, I’m perfectly aware. But I found I could draw a measure of strength from the well-shaped fabric, and I imagine I’ll need that strength as I continue on my way in the autumn.
Understanding the distinction now, Dean let out a huff of disagreement. “You didn’t have to tell me anything, Cas. That was your business.”
In the end, it had all worked out perfectly. Professor Moseley’s granddaughter was an actual professional wedding photographer, and Cas had been able to at least lend his skills to the cause by looking at her portfolio and assuring Sam that her work was top notch. They had hired her the next day, and Cas was happy to relax into the wedding itself, leaving the art making to the professionals.
I, who want so desperately to have someone with whom I might share my life, but have only an address and a lie with which to correspond. Or, rather, at whom to write.
I expect you find it bit shocking, Archangel, that this was such a new experience for me? Or, if not shocking, then slightly sad. I expect (or, certainly, hope) that you experience this sort of thing with regularity, reuniting with the friends and family you’ve accumulated over your years of school, work, and life out there in the world. For most, this reception appears to be a normal experience, even ordinary, expected, assumed. Imagine my surprise to encounter it first at 22.
I will, however, tell you that of the finished pieces I shared, Jody’s declared favorite was the same that inspired your sponsorship of my place here. So, clearly you are in good company.
Castiel bolts again, retreating to his room so he can curl up in a pitiful blanket ball and contemplate the fact that Dean Winchester is teaching a boy of about 10 how to throw a baseball.
On the basic level, it’s a fun and comfortable feeling in the yard. They chat amiably through the opening credits. Then they watch the movie, which all three of them have clearly seen before. Dean appears to have it largely memorized, and Ben gently ribs him about his love for the franchise throughout. They have a playful relationship, but they make every effort to include Cas in their banter, which he appreciates.
Laughing, Cas turned off the music and followed Dean inside, shutting out the sound of Rufus’s snores with the sliding glass door. As silently as possible, they moved the night stand out from between their beds, and slid them together. There wasn’t much to be done about the individual bed linens without waking the rest of the house, but it was still an improvement, anyway.
Cas blinks. “Oh,” he ejects, ever a wordsmith. That…was not what he was expecting to hear. “I’m sorry. For your loss, I mean.”
Castiel just blinks at him, very confused. Dean stares back, perplexed in his own right, apparently by this reaction. After a drawn out moment, he clarifies.
And on that supremely inadequate final note, he rolls onto his side to let the tears soothe his worry to sleep.
“I really am sorry, Mom,” Dean offered, contrite. “I just didn’t want to make this weekend about me.”
In any case, however ridiculous, this is Castiel’s state of mind as he enters week two of newly-back-in-town quarantine, waking for the day around noon and stumbling to the front window of his half of the house. Gabriel has a day shift today – not that they can safely see each other in person these days anyway with Gabe’s job to worry about, despite living under the same general roof – so he is alone and unwatched. Well, apart from Bela, his small striped cat, who is staring up at him through her whiskers from the armchair. But she’s no more judgmental than she was back when he had a job and a home and a life, so at least there’s that.
I’ve also been toying around with a joint project with Krissy over the past few days. We think there’s potential for some kind of YA-style bildungsroman starring a kid in the US foster system, so we’ve been brainstorming all kinds of wild directions that could go. Perhaps it’s an almost campy, tongue-in-cheek tale, a la
As Cas started up his car, a movement caught his eye. Dean, in his own car, was making a rather outdated but no less clear “roll down your window” motion. Cas complied as Dean started to back out toward the road, and laughed as he heard Dean cheerily belting out the lyrics to an old Billy Joel song along with his blaring speakers.
I realize now how presumptuous that was, and how inherently foolish. Perhaps you have enjoyed my letters more than is usual, but maybe this is just your way. Perhaps in the nearly 15 years this scholarship has been awarded you have offered continued funding to a number of students, or even to all of them. I do not, I must remind myself, actually know you.
“Yeah, exactly.” There was a brief silence, then, full of music and chewing. Cas wasn’t as tense, here alone in the dark with Dean, as he had expected to be. Whatever would be would be.
In the meantime, the more creative side of my career has seen some developments as well. My story in McSweeny’s received a very positive reception, and my contact there has asked me to keep in touch when new stories are ready. Plus, one of the print publishers I submitted to earlier in the year has been in touch about working with me. Ms. Blake, my contact at the publisher’s office, has one of my stories in mind for a short story anthology she’s working on, and has expressed an interest in a compilation of my own short stories somewhere down the line, as well. In light of this news, Pam has helped me get set up with an agent by the name of Missouri Mosley, who is exactly the blend of generous and formidable that I want on my side in this business. We have only met by phone and Skype thus far, given how far Up North I am at present, but I can see exactly why Pam trusts her so completely. It’s all a bit of a whirlwind, honestly, but I feel much safer in this storm with Miss Mosley as my anchor.
“Yes, that’s mine.” Lord, Cas wants to just sprint across the street and pretend this isn’t happening. But he does have
“Sorry, Mom,” Dean said, turning back to Cas. “I’m just pissed I wasn’t here to greet you properly, man.”
Well, silly me for trusting Bela’s estimation of her relations, because Dean Winchester proved to be anything but unpleasant.
The afternoon slid into a breezy evening in bliss around him. Guests wandered the grounds of the property, some even venturing to the lake to snap pictures of the sunset. They cut the cake at dusk, lit from the trees and the mosquito lamps, and for the second time that day, Sam Winchester went off to remove white goop from his luxurious hair – this time in the form of buttercream frosting. Jess looked exceptionally pleased with herself.
Then it dawned on Cas what Dean must have inferred from earlier in the evening. “Oh, Zeke. No, he wasn’t an actual skydiver. He just went skydiving the one time. But whenever he had any weed or liquor in his system, you could not get him to stop talking about it. How ‘flying transformed him’. He was a good guy, on the whole— still is, I’m sure— but a little too intent on being ‘deep’ for my taste.”
Castiel spent much of the evening meeting and engaging with the various other guests. But, as always, his gaze did wander to Dean now and again. The man seemed to be in his element tonight, showing off his easy charm to the young and old alike, walking the perfect line between “fun” and “acceptable to Baby Boomer sensibilities” that he pulled out so seamlessly in mixed company and professional settings. Apart from one moment where Grandma Deanna (Dean’s namesake) appeared to be interrogating him about something or other, the man seemed largely at ease.
Addison giggled and whispered, “Kinda.” Then she tilted her head again but before she could add more she had been scooped up by a tall blonde woman.
My vaguely ridiculous Gabriel-the-asshole-angel story is being published! I think I told you that I had submitted some work to a few publications (largely online) just on the off chance? Well, moments ago I received word that the website McSweeny’s wants to publish my story in their quarterly publication coming up. It’s possible I’m in a mild state of shock. (And it is also possible that Meg is currently scouring the Estate for a bottle of champagne, but that’s neither here nor there.) I’m very excited, Archangel, and I simply had to share with you.
Things progressed more predictably from there, though still with the unique flair of this bride and groom deeply ingrained. Dean gave an excellent speech, complete with AV support from Ash (the infamous Jar Jar Binks impression was even funnier when projected across the entire south wall of the barn) and a beautiful admission of his respect for his baby brother and brand-new sister-in-law. Ellie and Laurie, who had been named Jess’s “co-Best-Women”, gave a joint speech of their own to great hilarity, during which they jumped on the projector bandwagon to treat the guests to a variety of embarrassing photos of Jess throughout her life. John got up to give an unexpectedly emotional speech about how inspiring his son was to him, and Jan stood after to speak of the light Jess had always brought to everyone around her. And once it was clear there wasn’t a dry eye left on the property, Aaron invited the couple of the hour to the floor for their first dance.
After a tiny pause, Dean bursts out laughing. “Shit, sorry. No. It’s got an apartment up on top. Like a Mother-in-Law Suite, but not so fancy. I live up there.” Finally at least following the logic of the conversation, Castiel leans his head back and joins in with Dean’s laughter. When they both finally manage to calm back down to light chuckles, Dean asks, “Did you think I just hang around here all the time doing lawn work?!”
But now, if Dean wanted to move somewhere new without offending his father’s pride, he would need to come in to the conversation with a clear plan. John had always been something of a strategic thinker, a quiet presence with a mind constantly planning and adjusting. And he could get so wrapped around an idea sometimes that the merest question of the plan could feel like a personal attack. But if Dean could get in with a clear, rational idea of what was next before John got his heart set on his own set of outcomes, perhaps they could both emerge without hurt feelings or broken promises.
So, despite your not knowing any of these people, allow me to tell you about all the projects! (Please, allow me? I’m fascinated and excited, and I have no one else to share all this with who will remotely care…)
That said, I’ve written something I’m quite pleased with, and as I work on polishing it up for submission to Jody, I can already tell this story will have a life far beyond the Garden’s boundaries.
Startled, he turns around. And there, in all his plaid flannel glory, is Dean fucking Winchester, hair gleaming in the sun, eyes crinkling around a pair of aviators, looking straight at Castiel and smiling.
Sure enough, Sam’s howl of “Dammit, Dean!” rang out a moment later, and the Groom once again chased his Best Man out toward the woods.
The first thing that struck me was that he was remarkably unassuming, sitting in the corner of the café in a warn leather jacket and jeans, drumming his fingers on the table as if in time to a spirited silent song. Don’t get me wrong: he is quite a handsome man. But I suppose, given his connection to the Talbots, I was expecting an over-polished gentleman, the sort who exudes status and positively drips money wherever he goes. Needless to say, the relaxed man we met was nothing of the kind.
The lake house was, predictably, built on the shore of a lake, so the last twenty minutes or so of the trip were rife with glimpses of sun-golden water through patches of Midwestern forest. It was calming, just as Castiel imagined Bill Harvelle had intended when he secretly purchased the property years ago. When he died so suddenly shortly after finishing the renovations, Ellen had been ready to sell it right off--they hadn't even managed to take a family trip there before Bill's passing, and she couldn't bear to dive into the "could have beens" that she envisioned haunting its rooms. She once told a teenaged Cas, when he had asked why she ultimately kept the property, that this final stretch of road along the lake had been a significant factor in her decision. Its beauty had soothed her shattered heart some, so that by the time she made the final turn down the long drive and caught a glimpse of the house, she felt revived. It was as if, she told Cas, she could see a way forward for the first time since Bill's death, and the shadows of maybes felt less like despair and more like love.
“Definitely.” And Castiel feels a little vindicated about his assumptions given the proud parent twist to Dean’s mouth when he pronounces the word. They’re obviously close, even if they’re not related, either biologically or familially. “He’s been great through all the chaos of the last few months, too. Hell, I can’t go in the house to make him go to bed on time tonight, but I’d place bets he’ll still be in there with the lights off ready to sleep exactly when I told him to. What kid does that?”
Thanks to Castiel’s restraint, Dean makes an unexpected offer. “You wanna come watch a movie? Me and Ben here are gonna do a socially distant watch in the backyard and get takeout.” He’s indicating the kid, who has followed Dean down toward the curb to join the conversation. “We were thinkin’ burgers and
“I think Dad will want me to,” Dean admitted. “He’s been trying to persuade me to bring my expertise back to work with him and Bobby since I finished my degree. He’s fairly subtle, but he’s relentless.”
.” Dean’s head shot up with the word, tone vehement, almost fearful. “No. You answered her ad yourself, remember? And she accepted you at face value. None of them had any idea we knew each other beyond the time I ambushed you and Bela in Charlevoix. No one knew, I swear.”
? I certainly didn’t ‘til this glorious weirdo stormed into my life. Honestly, just the other night, totally off the cuff, he starts reciting this ode to my ass that was just…
To mark the completion of the program this month, Chuck is holding a ceremony here at the Estate— a graduation, of sorts, where our certificates will be distributed and a small reception will be held for friends and family.
Jody very pointedly wants to help Meg work on breaking her own prejudices to open up horizons. Meg is a fierce woman, as I’m sure I’ve implied, and has strong opinions about the relative values of ideas and genres and styles and such. So, naturally, Jody is suggesting she take one or two of these tropes that she despises and lean into it. She wants Meg to write in that hated trope honestly, without parody or finger pointing, to see if she can find something new in there that changes her mind. (Since Meg has been struggling some with the concept of a redemption story, I suspect Jody is hoping that redeeming a trope will also serve as some kind of springboard for that deeper psychological battle at play. But perhaps I’m projecting my own hope onto Jody.)
When no response came, Mary continued, color rising even as her voice remained hushed. “It’s a good thing Ellen was thinking on her feet, at least. Because that was quite a shock to try to cover up, let me tell you. Especially since I was just about to tell her how sad we were to hear that Lisa’s grandmother might be dying. I was about ten seconds from making a complete ass of myself in front of my son’s brand-new mother-in-law, and I do not like to think what would have happened if Ellen hadn’t saved me with photos of Garth’s new nephew.”
The thing is, Archangel, I should know better! Femininity is not a requirement for queerness in a cisgender man— I learned this young, by my own research, and I explained this very truth to several of the kids who came through Angel Farm during my tenure. And yet, when presented with a tall, broadly built man with a deep voice and a muscle car and an apparent flannel obsession, I fully assumed any degree of queerness was off the table. Perhaps I was just so relieved that this lovely man, clearly dropped to Earth from an LL Bean catalogue, was actually an ally to my community that it seemed too much to think him an actual member thereof. But whatever I assumed, I was wrong. On his second night at the Roadhouse he casually mentioned his “ex-boyfriend Aaron” on the periphery of a conversation and just barreled on to finish the story. I cannot remember how the tale ended, truthfully. My mind was stuck, and our entire relationship to date was bouncing off the walls of my brain like memory ping pong.
To be fair, I think the expected elements—the place and the program—play a major role in casting this spell. There is a stunning beauty in peace and space and nature here that even Angel Farm could not quite capture. The silences are rich and full here, simply dripping in muses. Stories seem to drift in every breeze, and I’m catching as much as I can manage in my little butterfly net, filling scrap pages with fragmented thoughts and unborn ideas for a rainy day. It’s almost overwhelming, really.
If he was thinking rationally, he probably would have admitted that Dean’s little invitation was a definite factor in the choice to come here. Yes, he was in town, but Ann Arbor was not tiny. Sarah’s office was on the other side of the main campus, and getting from there to here had involved a rather alarming volume of slow traffic and wild undergrads sprinting for the bus. But he was so twisted up about what the next day would bring – when he did, he felt, have to confess to Dean or risk imploding with anxiety – that he barreled on toward the nearest source of comfort.
In a sense, Dean and I were on an island apart, free to explore the town on our own whenever my tutoring sessions with Jo were complete. And that is exactly what we did. Dean took me around this community that had housed the better parts of his childhood; the quietest lake spot for lounging, unbothered, on a summer afternoon; the best pie joint in the county that the tourists hadn’t ruined yet; the secret hilltop clearing where he had once shot off illegal fireworks for two hours before the telltale flash of police lights had broken the distant road. He walked me through his best memories, Archangel, welcomed me into those corners of himself unprompted and unashamed. He even took me to an honest-to-goodness drive-in movie theatre one night, to lay on the hood of his pristine classic car and eat popcorn to the sounds of a cartoon battle. It was like something out of a film, Archangel, and it took everything in me to remember that (despite the structural similarities) these were not, in fact, dates.
feel to it— a world where supernatural monsters exist but most people still don’t believe in them. The concept was a suave, almost James-Bond-like character who secretly hunted monsters by pretending to be a government agent, and in this instance the hunt was focused on the ghost of a dragon haunting a castle. Even for a seasoned ghost hunter, my thought was that a dragon-sized ghost (who would still, presumably, be able to breathe fire) would pose a new challenge.
In a perfect world, this weekend would be heavenly as well. Sam had wanted to get married at the lake house, and Ellen had been happy to make that happen, despite his rather brief engagement. They would all be there again, together at the scene of so many beloved memories, inviting some wonderful new people into their large, lively clan and celebrating two brilliant young people in love. Most of Cas was thrilled. If only that deep nagging voice in his head would stop trying to ruin it all with weird thoughts about Dean.
Dusk slipped through evening in relaxed, musical bliss. The Moores were a delight, and seemed highly entertained by the others’ ‘family band’-style traditions. Laurie turned out to have a hell of a voice, complete with an impressively accurate Janis Joplin impression, and Jess’s stepdad, Rick, even took a turn on the guitar for a couple Beatles covers that had everyone singing through laughter.
“I— yeah. Yeah, I think…I think from what you’ve told me—” Dean visibly swallowed, but continued, dispensing with the game in favor of a real answer. “I think it sounds like he’s pretty gone on you but doesn’t know how to tell you.”
So, there Krissy and I sat, in front of a crackling fire, contemplating the enormous void in our childhood experience, when our savior arrived! His name, dear Archangel, was Garth Fitzgerald IV.
Cas had barely connected his phone charger to the wall when he heard Dean sigh and plop down on his own bed. “Is it that obvious?”
Sam released him more quickly than the others, but his smile was no less warm. “I’m so glad you were able to come in today! The drive wasn’t too bad?”
The front door was set back a bit on the right edge of the porch, so Castiel stowed his last glimmers of apprehension, climbed the trio of stairs up from the path, and approached.
“What? Uh…” Cautiously, Dean took the envelope, his eyes glancing up at Castiel repeatedly as if waiting to be reprimanded. When no such response came, he finally opened it up, pulled out the small stack of cash, and immediately looked exasperated. “Cas – “
Pushing his luck but too curious to stop, Cas asks, “Is Ben your son? I know you and Lisa dated back in high school, but I sort of missed everything after graduation.”
“Great,” Dean replied, deflating with clear relief, and with one last vague gesture toward the living room, he headed back the way he had come.
They all did their best to keep Sam laughing, as he fretted over whether he had adequately memorized his vows, but when Mary materialized on the porch, clad in a gorgeous floral sundress, the need for distraction evaporated. Sam was just as tearful as his proud Mother, and it was time to start the ceremony. They headed downstairs, past the crowd of guests who had been ushered toward their seats by Charlie and Sonya, and took their positions to begin the ceremony.
And then there’s the arrival of the food. The delivery person comes right to the back yard, for some reason, rather than going to the front door, and is greeted by name by both Ben and Dean. Aaron, who looks to be a little younger than Dean and Castiel, is cordial with them in the way of old friends, and even makes vaguely playful (or perhaps flirty?) conversation with Cas once they’ve been introduced. But before he can untangle that reality, the food has been dispersed, and Aaron is gone.
Shaking his head with a smirk, Dean gets up to follow. “Okay, lover boy. Let’s aim to head out by noon.”
Cas snapped his eyes shut as he heard Dean pad back toward their room. He could feel decisions shifting inside himself, and he needed to think before he faced more conversation. With the door softly closed and the lights extinguished, Cas thought he heard Dean pause before getting into bed. Was he watching Cas feign sleep, wondering if he should say goodnight again? After nearly a minute of Cas feeling guilty while trying to keep his breathing convincingly steady, Dean crawled into his bed and settled into stillness. Cas’s muscles uncoiled. He was being ridiculous. Dean had probably just been checking his phone. Cas was the one with the unrequited crush and the penchant for staring.
Finally, Dean seemed to relax out of ‘convince at all costs’ mode. “Yep. And Mom’ll probably kill me. But I’ll take a couple ass-kickings over Sam’s sad puppy eyes any day.”
If I were feeling particularly poetic, which I am sure Cain would appreciate as a firm believer of the divinity of poetry, I would say that the name of this place refers to more than the lovely grounds themselves. We are a little collective of gardeners here, with instructors offering their expertise to help us come together with all manner of tools to prune and plant, to take stories we assumed to be weeds and fertilize them into flowering. Or perhaps our inner writers are the plants in this scenario, which must be coaxed and nourished into letting stories bloom. Or perhaps I’ve already stretched this metaphor well past the breaking point. In any case, even as winter approaches, I can already see where the buds will form.
Castiel nodded. “The first draft manuscript. I was in town with Missouri today to sign the paperwork for a publishing deal. They gave me a generous advance, so that money won’t set me back, really. Sarah and her team will be going through that draft with her people, and I’m sure it’ll get ripped to shreds, but I wanted you to have it.”
When I started writing this note, I was all set to send the phone right back to you again. But I was interrupted only a sentence and a half ago. Jo popped into my booth because Dean was on the phone, and she handed the call off to me (just like that! With no warning!! I’ve met this man ONCE, and I’m not great with people at the best of times, but I tried to converse in a normal fashion as best I could). So, I talked with Dean, (and survived!) for a bit, and he asked for my phone number. When I told him about this smartphone debacle (a version of it, anyway—in my tale you were a wealthy relative I haven’t seen in a decade) he tried to talk me down. “Think of it as an investment,” he said when I explained my hesitation. “You know, in your career. When agents and publishers are beating down your door, they’re gonna need a way to reach you. And if this uncle or whatever wants to fund your communication for a while, you should let him! He’s like a patron of the arts or something, right?” (I might have said you were my uncle. My apologies for the presumption, but I was very nervous.)
Dean gave a disjointed headshake from his place on Cas’s chest, as though shaking off an insect. “It's not even really them, or the wedding. I'm not regretting what Lis and I decided, or thinking about getting back together with her or anything like that. I don't even really wish she was here, frankly. I just... people keep giving me that knowing look and saying it'll be my wedding next, and I just feel like I've failed, somehow.”
“I’m sorry.” He didn’t know what else to say. His insides seemed to be bouncing back and forth between joyful back flips and sympathy heartache. Dean just shrugged. “When?”
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean asked, his voice slightly muffled by the comforter onto which he had just plopped.
Krissy, our resident Queen of YA, is being given a style change project, but with a twist. Jody, unlike many academics, very much sees the value of YA in the literary world, and does not wish to discourage Krissy from the genre itself. However, she does see the potential for Krissy to transcend the formula of many other YA pieces, so she crafted this idea to promote a stylistic expansion. She encourages Krissy to take YA ideas (old or new) and write them (or offshoots of them) in wildly different styles— poetry, Dickensian English, Greek dramatic tragedy, Shakespearean verse— anything classic or incongruous or out of the box that she can think of, to see how perhaps themes or ideas can be incorporated into the genre in new ways.
Cas shook himself as we watched Sam catch his brother midway across the lawn to deliver a well-deserved noogie.
Cas routinely wondered if any of the others were as saddened by this as he was, but it was just too personal a topic to broach with them. And, anyway, Dean was probably keeping up with them all just fine—Cas suspected he was the only one that had fallen completely out of touch with the man.
“Yeah. I mean, there were some great people in that shop, but if I’m honest it was always meant to be just a starting place. I never wanted it to be my endgame. I learned a helluva lot from Jesse, but I’ve always been aiming to work on classics, take lost causes and make ‘em shine.” He leaned forward conspiratorially, finally looking a bit more relaxed. “I hate to be a snob, but if I never have to investigate another ‘weird sound’ in a brand-new Prius it’ll be too soon.”
Garth, alternatively, is a naturally cheery person, whose writing is pretty consistent with his hopeful and positive personality. Jody has suggested he play a bit with the idea of his audience, perhaps writing without one in mind for a change. She recommended starting off with journaling, the sort that isn’t intended to be read by anyone (even Jody), to see what honesty can bubble up when there is no one at the other end to please or cheer up or risk disappointing. Then, perhaps, he can take themes from that journaling practice and expand or fully translate into something fictional (or non-fiction, if he wants – no requirements either way) in a new way, without intentionally rounding the edges or brightening the shadows.
There was a weight to Dean’s words, something deeply important hiding under the guise of a repeated conversation. “And I neglected you right back,” Cas reminded him, trying to be forceful. “Largely out of spite.”
Hoping to remove the rising anxiety from Mary’s tone, Cas interjected. “Well, does the attic room still have two beds? Cause I don’t mind sharing a room, if it helps.” The room, inexplicably, had contained two twin beds since Ellen first inherited the place, and was a big enough space to fit two grown adults quite comfortably.
Cas nearly flinched. He had known they were out of touch, clearly, but it was still jarring to realize Dean wasn’t even sure which state Cas was currently inhabiting.
Should you still be in search of alternative lodging over this month’s holiday break, Mr. Smith would like to recommend an available place in East Jordan, Michigan. The proprietor of a popular pub in town has a room available for a tenant during the time in question, and she has been known to provide excellent accommodations for young artists in the past. She offers a small apartment above her restaurant for a very minimal fee, which Mr. Smith would consider included within the scope of your existing scholarship. Another rental car could easily be hired for you as well, should you need transportation to East Jordan.
There was a silence as Cas’s question hung in the scant few inches of air between them. Then Dean turned his head toward Cas with a grimace. “Would you believe me if I said I just really needed a hug?”
“You know,” Cas offered the little girl, “My mom used to call me a little monster, too. Which was especially strange since she named me after an angel.”
Castiel could have held that stare for centuries, lost in fields of emotion too thick to navigate. But just as Dean took in a shaky breath to speak, the next song started playing.
We’re really back into the swing of things now, Archangel. After about two weeks back from the holiday break, it’s becoming clear that our second semester is going to have a slightly different “vibe” in comparison to the first. Things in the autumn were fairly divided, different professors asking us to bring in work in to be examined through their various areas of expertise, working on it with us one at a time, even in group sessions.
“Fine, fine,” Mary conceded. Then she added, somewhat grumpily, “You know, you could send me to the store, if you’re so worried about your precious biscuits.”
To be honest, the final goodbye affected me far more acutely than I anticipated. I’m generally a rather level-headed being, at least in action. I find heightened, dramatic displays of emotion uncomfortable and counterproductive, and public displays of affection generally baffle me in the worst possible way. I prefer to observe the world with calm; to take it in, analyze and process, and channel the results (after careful study) into the written word or quiet discourse. Feeling myself momentarily overwhelmed with a rush of emotion as I drove off down the freeway was an altogether bewildering experience.
“No one?” Castiel asked, skeptical of the logistics of such secrecy in a life as full of friends as Dean’s. “It sure seems like Charlie had an inkling.”
“Nothing,” Sam rushes to reply, eyes wide. He heads for the door with a little spring in his step. “I’ll go pack.”
When it eventually came to him, as they pulled into the bunker’s garage, he felt like he’d been punched in the face all over again.
Castiel, never having figured out how to respond to compliments such as these even in the best of times, took the easiest way out. He picked up his water glass from the coffee table and drained half of it, flailing around for a different angle.
“Oh,” Dean says, and Cas works quite hard not to read anything in the tone of that syllable. “Yeah, you too. See you around, Castiel.”
Castiel walks for way longer than anticipated. It’s nice here. Quiet enough without being creepy. He’s got a soothing breeze blowing his hair into an even bigger mess, a podcast in his ear to help him zone out, and truly nowhere to be. After a while, Cas even takes off his face mask. Gabe had told him that he could, that the neighborhood had been operating under the rule that you could go mask-less outdoors as long as you crossed the street to make room for others. It was a quiet enough area that this wasn’t a hardship, and once Cas had confirmed that Gabe hadn’t been wrong (or lying) about this behavior, he opted to shed his mask as well.
, and there was nothing to be done about it. I had no expectation that this absurd dream notation would turn into some sort of handwritten therapy session, but there you have it. As I’ve said before, the writer and the writing are definitely linked, even if they don’t know it.
“Yeah, she was bummed. But her grandma’s pretty sick, and she really needed to be there with the family, just in case things take a turn for the worse, you know? Better to be safe.”
I know, it’s all very Disney’s Cinderella, isn’t it? (Minus the evil step-sisters – my foster siblings are perfectly lovely). But thanks to you, the melodrama ends there. I shall make the journey Up North next month for three semesters of writing and nature and freedom, and Naomi Novak no longer has to endure the burden of my presence. No one loses here.
“Wow, thanks, man,” Dean returns, eyebrows raised but tone impressed. At least he isn’t openly teasing Cas for his general dork-like behaviors. Gabe would be six jokes deep by this point. In the end, he points at the plain old white granulated sugar. “Just this one is perfect.”
Gabe, being an avid baker when he isn’t working seven days a week, has many kinds of sugar. Hoping to get this interaction over with as soon as humanly possible so that he can spend the rest of his evening wallowing in shame and embarrassment, Castiel brings all the sugars.
, he thought. There was nothing for it: he was going to have to start coming clean now. “I simply wanted to share some news with them that they might appreciate. They provided me with a scholarship…”
“I see,” Castiel replied, aiming for serious but rather too entranced by the curve of Dean’s lower lip. “Well, I’ll take that under advisement, then, thank you.”
“I wasn’t sure which kind of sugar you needed,” Castiel offers apologetically as he shows off each of the labelled plastic containers in turn.
So, yes. Everyone at the Roadhouse is still wonderful and welcoming, and I was very happy to be back. And yet— and this is what I’ve been struggling to understand— there was something else as well, something other than happiness churning in my chest. I felt no less joy at being in East Jordan, but within hours of my arrival the joy itself seemed to ache, a physical thing settling deep in my chest, adjusting its depth in fits and at odd moments, smelling like love while tasting like tears. It was, at the time, baffling. There was nowhere on Earth I’d rather be, so why was I saturated with this unprovoked melancholy?
First, Dean pulls him into a huge hug. He holds it tight, even though Cas has regressed to his wooden soldier act within Dean’s arms. Then he realizes he hasn’t even spoken yet, so he whispers, “Heya, Cas.” Next, he pulls back, looks the angel over to make sure he’s in one piece, and punches him lightly on the arm.
It felt like a sign. This phrase meant nothing! I must make it something! The spirit of a deceased motivational speaker had just possessed the body of my surliest professor to tell me so!
So, I shall let my glee flow (internally, so as not to make Mrs. Novak suspicious that I might be too happy for my own good), and prepare to embark on the next chapter of my life (aha, the writing puns begin!) with newfound hope.
Claire, on the other hand, is more like a surlier teenage version of Jody. She’s only been with her Moms for a little over a year, so residual behavior from her time in the foster system hasn’t really worn off. She’s unsurprisingly wary, but seems to be beginning to entertain the idea that this might be the permanent home Jody and Donna assure her it is. She’s snappish and a bit obdurate, but more in the way of average teenagers than of a hurting child acting out. We’ve not started into actual tutoring yet, but I can already report she is very bright behind her cool façade. Once I manage to catch her up on some of the finer points she missed while being shuffled from school to school, I’m fairly certain she will pull even beyond the standard curriculum. We seem to understand each other, I think: I know how much she cares about making her Moms proud despite how little she’s willing to show it, and she knows I’m going to treat her like a Real Person both in spite of and because of her history. It seems like a good start, at any rate.
So. Like I said, it’s a hell of a story. And clearly still an open wound for Dean, seeing as even Bela didn’t mention Sam Winchester to any of us. She isn’t exactly known for her tact, so I suppose it’s possible she doesn’t know about Dean’s family beyond what Henry might have told her. But I’m certainly not going to bring it up with her unless I’ve ensured it isn’t secret information. I do hope you won’t tell either, Archangel. It’s not my tale to share, in truth, and I only open it to you with the understanding of anonymity for all involved. Please don’t prove me naïve for trusting you thus.
When Dean leans back, just enough but still blissfully close, he has the distinct pleasure of studying whatever it is Cas is doing with his face in response to the surprise romantic assault. The expression is really quite something - a hilarious mix of confusion, panic, and ascendant bliss. Dean
He thanked her, refusing to let her unquestioning acceptance choke him up again. He should be used to it by now, probably, but it never seemed to touch him any less than the first time.
Mary tilted her head, eyebrows raised in the unmistakable expression of a mother who is beyond done with her children’s bullshit. “What is going on, Dean? Where is Lisa?”
The day rolled on at an impressive pace from there. The Moores rolled up shortly after Cas had finished eating, and set to work with Mary planning out the day and divvying up tasks. Jess’s bridal party filled out as the day wore on, with her college roommate Kat arriving around noon, and her “certified BFF” Grant rushing in an hour or so later with apologies for unforeseen traffic. They were both quickly set down in the dining room with Trish, Sonya, and Laurie to roll silverware for the reception, dividing up a mountain of tiny wildflowers between the rolls for a bit of rustic flair.
A week or so ago I awoke to find these words scribbled on the notepad next to my bed, the apparent mid-night scrawl of a man with a Very Important Idea.
I suppose you’ll be curious how things are going with your extravagant Christmas gift? If that’s what you’re silently asking me from afar, then I will have to answer, “quite well, thank you”.
“Still. I trusted my Dean implicitly by the end of that ski trip. And yet all through the next six months I was still too afraid and ashamed to tell the truth.”
The idea Cas had begun to foster before Mary’s interruption returned to the forefront of his mind. It might be the tiniest bit selfish of him to even think of it, but—well, maybe that was okay. Maybe everyone could win, this time. He resolved to at least put it out there. Give Dean an option, and accept whatever came next with grace. No matter what happened, he would not lose touch with Dean again. On that point, he was resolute.
Ordinarily, in an effort to establish casual discourse, I would take a stab at first names, but that feels unspeakably rude. We have not met, and I have been led to believe that I should never expect to meet you, or even receive return correspondence. (As we have already established, though, I possess an immense quantity of hope, and as such will keep my fingers crossed for a change of heart on that score, someday.) “Michael” is unacceptable, let alone “Mike” or some other business-casual derivative. Even I, impetuous youth though I may be, would not presume quite that much. So? Is there something else I can call you?
“Actually,” Cas said slowly, aiming for nonchalance as Dean smirked. “That won’t be necessary. But thank you.”
“I didn’t know that, though, did I?” Castiel shot back, anxious for Dean to understand. “It never once occurred to me that I was writing to you. I thought Archangel was a snooty old white man with no hair and too much money.”
So, somehow, I started writing a story of two young adults fighting, largely alone, against the monsters of lore. My brother and sister team live in motels and have spanned the country several times over, saving lives under the radar from a young age, heedless of the truth that this fight should never have fallen on the shoulders of children. They do it because it is what they know and what they are best at, and by the time we meet them in my story, they think they’ve seen it all.
Castiel takes a long time to decide if he’s going to respond to this, push the cryptic statement a bit to see if it was meant to elicit his curiosity as it so thoroughly has. But, then, he’s embarrassed himself in front of this man several times tonight and that really just resulted in them laughing together. Fuck it. It’s been a shitty year – how much worse could a little push make it?
Dean and Cas, only a year apart, had connected immediately. Even at 8, Dean had a way of engaging and exciting anyone around him, and that energy kept Cas above water while Mama spent those 2 years in and out of the hospital. After the cancer finally took her, the Winchesters kept Cas and his dad close, inviting them to dinner at least twice a week, helping herd Cas to after school activities when Chuck was “in the zone” with his work, and even bringing the Novaks along on their family vacations.
First order of business: thank you very much for sending the first installment of my stipend so early. It will be a great help as I make my way Up North at the end of the month. I was beginning to consider hitchhiking to the campus to save some extra money, and I don’t think that would have ended well. Hannah tells me I somehow simultaneously give off a “creepy intense vibe” and have “distressingly kissable lips”, either of which would surely spell my demise as a hitchhiker. (Hannah being my closest friend from college, who you have never met and therefore do not know. Apologies. This is what I get for writing my letters by hand “like a hipster”.) Thanks to your kindness, I now plan to rent my own car for the journey, instead, which will be far safer. And, I expect, far less pungent.
Mary pursed her lips in annoyance. “I’m not gonna burn down the house just by touching the oven, Ellen.”
Then another voice joined in the confusion, as the sound of footsteps began to emanate from a nearby hallway. “Char, you forgot your…”
But I need you to know that this simple little 2x3 card holds within itself so much meaning, despite its ease and brevity. Archangel, it tells me that you read my letters. Not only that, but given your quick response, it tells me you must read them as soon as they arrive. Perhaps that seems like a small truth to you. But in a succinct little world like my own, to have my silliest thoughts met at the mailbox with anticipation, as though they might matter? It means more than you can know.
“Anything to drink?” Ben is tapping around on the tablet, apparently adding Cas’ burger to their order. “A pop or something?”
“Uhh,” Cas was jarred. This conversation was giving him whiplash. “You said that you two decided it had run its course.”
We did not sleep at all (as you can probably tell from my decadent metaphors). We laid aside most of our usual teasing and sarcasm in favor of naked fascination and an open forum. Krissy and I shared with the group at large our experiences, and some shared with us by our various temporary siblings, catching them up on the highs and lows of life as a foster. They, in turn, began to open up about themselves (and I hope I can count on your discretion as I weave this narrative).
“All I’m saying,” Dean continued, “is you earned everything you got out of the scholarship, Cas. It came because of your writing, not my feelings. And your writing got you published with that hilarious piece in McSweeny’s, and it impressed all your professors at the Garden, and it got you that agent. Archangel didn’t do any of that. You did. That’s— that’s why I offered to keep up the sponsorship this year, too. ‘Cause I couldn’t stand the idea of you working a bunch of shitty jobs and being too tired to do anything else. I did that in high school, and it was hell. You deserve better, and I’m really glad you found it with Jody.”
It would be a beautiful death, he thought idly, to drown in green eyes and sunlight. Well worth the trouble.
Castiel had finally decided to go for a walk a bit before dusk, and he’s approaching home on his side of the street when he notices movement at the Braedens’ again. Lisa is coming down the front walk with a small duffle in one hand, and a bottle of wine in the other. She looks real sharp, like maybe she dressed up a bit, and as she turns on to the sidewalk Cas can hear her call, “Have fun, you two,” back toward the house.
“Tomorrow.” That thought elicited a sad laugh from Castiel. Oh, how he had worried about tomorrow, all for nothing. “And here I thought it was a date.”
“Well, that sounds awesome, Cas,” Dean said. “Tell your friend with the couch that I’m definitely interested.”
“Hey Castiel. Uh, this is going to sound unbelievably cliché, but,” he hesitates for a second, rubbing the back of his neck as he looks apologetically at Cas. “Could I, uh… borrow some sugar?”
P.S. An Update: Bela rolled her eyes at me quite dramatically, and informed me that it was not a Cotillion, it was a “Coming Out Ball”, and that she “looked perfectly marvelous, thank you”. That certainly made my own more metaphorical coming out much smoother once Meg, Krissy and I had finished cackling.
Castiel was determined to enjoy this weekend despite the problem of Dean, at least for Sam’s sake. Despite the fact that he had barely heard a word from his once-best-friend in the last several years. Despite the fact that he couldn’t see any place for himself in Dean’s world of oncoming domestic bliss, even in this age of connecting technologies. Cas didn’t want to be a mess this weekend, no matter how much he missed Dean in his life. He wanted to enjoy himself.
Dean has set up three chairs, all facing the side wall of the garage, where a projector is taking advantage of the large blank canvas it provides. Cas is motioned over toward one of the chairs, where he settles in as Dean starts the movie.
I honestly can’t remember what I’ve told you about Krissy’s situation, so I suppose I should clarify. Like me, Krissy is an orphan, but she didn’t come to be in that lonely club until she was 13. At that point, she was plunged into the Foster System in a more transient way than my own experience afforded, moving from place to place until she managed to graduate high school at 16, have herself emancipated from the system, and go off to college on scholarship. She’s what Meg refers to as a “subtle but exquisite badass”.
Castiel thought he might be having a heart attack, but nothing could have felt less relevant. Because Dean was talking about things that Cas thought lived only in the depths of his heart. Words were nowhere near enough. But he should probably say some. “That was quite a speech.”
Oddly, the next morning when Castiel comes down the stairs, he doesn’t sprint for the kitchen. He’s somehow calmer, as if the burning disappointment of realizing that Dean is apparently married to Lisa and a father to her child somehow alleviates Castiel’s own responsibility to be impressive should he be spotted through the window.
As time went by, though, the differences in the relationships really showed. Cas blamed it on proximity, at first, the way Jess integrated into the family immediately while Lisa, and by extension Dean, were relegated to the periphery of family life. They lived in Florida, whereas Sam and Jess could have dinner with Mary and John nightly, if they wanted. But even if it started there, the family bond with Jess became deeper fairly quickly. From that first Christmas, she felt like a sister to Cas. They went to each other for advice and chat, independent, even, of Sam. Lisa was great, but she was always a guest at family events, from what Cas could see. Even if his feelings for Dean made him an unreliable observer on that front, Dean’s gradual withdrawal seemed to prove him (annoyingly) right. The elder Winchester was still family to them all, but he wasn’t in the thick of things any more.
Anyway. Throughout the break I could feel all this boiling below the surface layers of my skin, vibrating confusedly no matter how much I tried to ignore it. And then, a few days into my stay, Dean arrived and threw my heart for yet another loop.
The difficulty is that this trip wasn’t like before. Past visits with Dean have also included Meg and Bela— and more recently Charlie— and have occurred in places of leisure and pleasure, unencumbered by additional obligations and outside influences. Our correspondences between these meetings have been casual and pleasantly pedestrian— texts and emails about everyday amusements and frivolous fancies. But this… Dean and I were both on vacation, but those around us were not. For the Harvelle’s and their clan, this was an ordinary week with guests floating around the edges of their daily responsibilities.
”? Who knows. We might split up at some point to write our own pulls from this joint brainstorm, but for now we’re having a great time sharing the process. I’ll keep you updated if anything dramatic happens, Archangel, I promise.
“No point,” Ben replies, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Just making an observation. It’s good to see.”
Castiel spends the two days after the lawn mower incident studiously avoiding the front of the house entirely. This is not overly difficult, given that he spends most of his time in his childhood bedroom, which is in the back of his half of the house. But when he does need to venture into the kitchen – the one space he and Gabriel are forced to alternate using – it’s possible Castiel makes an excessively dramatic dash from the stairs to the kitchen doorway in order to lessen the chances of being spotted from across the street.
And the fact of the matter was that when Dean had walked away from the longest and most significant romantic relationship of his life, he hadn’t felt comfortable calling to confide in Cas. Rather, he had decided that there was no one with whom he could share his burden. It made Castiel wonder how he would have reacted if Dean had suddenly called for a shoulder to cry on. Would his resentment have made him respond with cruelty? Would he have even answered the phone? What kind of friend did that make him? No, this wasn’t all Dean’s fault. It was unfair to expect the man to know Cas was hurting without ever bothering to tell him.
The first thing I outlined was somewhere between a police procedural and a horror story. It had a sort of
Oh, Archangel, I wish you could advise me! I am sure the vast experience of your long life would yield the guidance I so desperately seek. But, in the absence of wise words, I will at least try to take solace in the bits of clarity I have formed while writing this letter. You do more than you know, simply by existing, Archangel.
So.  This weekend might turn out to be Cas’s own private disaster, but he truly was delighted for Sam, the incandescently happy couple of the moment. As long as he could focus back on the bride and groom, he could definitely get through this in one piece.
“You’re one to talk about surprises,” he finally says, trying desperately to keep his voice relatively even. “Imagine my surprise to find out my high school crush who lives across the street is not only the sexiest man alive, but also miraculously is not married to his gorgeous landlady. Wonders have just been piling up on my doorstep for a while now.”
