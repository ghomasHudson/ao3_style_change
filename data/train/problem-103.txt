"What I'm trying to say is, I'm sorry. When you left, Mary was pretty much the only thing that kept me from putting a gun in my mouth and I couldn't just threw her away like trash just because you'd come back. Then she put a bullet in you and I found out who she really was. And it was over there and then. I should have left but I stayed, I had to stay because there was a child, an innocent baby and I couldn't abandon her, none of it was that baby's fault. And then everything got too complicated. I was angry with Mary and with myself but I took it all out on you and it was so wrong."
“Sherlock!” she yelled and ran towards him, but she was too late and his body seemed to be lifeless by the time she got to him. She tried to take his pulse and check his breathing and then his other vitals. As a doctor, Joan clearly knew that she mustn't panic, but she just couldn't help it. They hadn’t prepared her for these kinds of situations in medical school or in the army.
"No. If you really want to… help me, don't call anyone. They can't help me."
"Fun?"
"Sophia-"
"So could it be the bond that lead us to everything that's happened?"
"No. I'm still at Baker street. Why? What's wrong?"
"No, but what if you really are my companion? What if it's not a lie at all? What will happen?"
"Oh God… Sherlock, look at this," She walked over to him after they'd searched the flat for twenty minutes in
Joan knew that there would be a punishment for her later and yet she couldn't help but wonder what it was going to be. Despite her curiosity, she refrained from asking further questions and went upstairs.
Joan jumped towards the table and smashed down the glass, then picked up the biggest shard that she could see. She tried to act as fast as she possibly could but before she could finish what she'd started, he grabbed her by the arms.
4: Each of them is obligated to be accessible through their phones. If not, they're supposed to get in touch as soon as possible.
He shrugged before he sat on his black leather armchair. "Well, I think you already know what I am. Don't you?" he stated as if it was the most common thing in the world to say.
“The muffins here are good,” The blonde said but Sherlock shook his head.
“Mhh, I suppose it is, he claims it was self-defence,” Sherlock added, “Which fits with the fact that two men clearly had been fighting at the crime scene.”.
“Okay, good to know,” John murmured, the words making Sherlock’s head spin. Good to know? What did that mean?
“You need to be my boyfriend tonight.”
“It’s okay, we don’t have to do anything,” John answered tenderly.
“What are you on?” John asked quietly, anger slowly boiling in his belly.
“Next weekend?” John asked and Sherlock smiled widely. Was it a date? Or was he just being friendly?
“Are you going to call her?” Sherlock asked him, his eyes flickering to the deep blue ones.
The door opened a couple of hours later, and John looked up, expecting it to Murray coming back. He had gone out at some point to get the pizza they had ordered. Instead, a head full of dark brown curls wandered in. The boy didn’t say anything, just went over and sat down at his desk and looked into his microscope. John cleared his throat carefully and looked over at the boy who was now staring back at him.
“It’s the…” He muttered and then looked up at John with wide-eyed.
“You’re…” There was a short pause as the boy across from him thought. Probably about how he could make an excuse to leave. “Gay?” John ended his question and cocked his head at him. Sherlock’s eyes searched his face. He didn’t find anything else but the crumbs from the muffin in the corner of his mouth. No signs that he was going to leave then. He was safe.
“Yes,” He answered. Right, people usually knew who was on their school's rugby team, especially if the school was somewhat known for the sport.
“What?” He questioned him.
“Whenever they are out of their depth, which is always, they call me,” Sherlock tried once more.
“I was thinking about something,” John said and looked up at Sherlock.
“Why can’t you just stay in her room?” John asked and looked over at his roommate who was lying in his bed, watching something on his computer.
He was going to spend the night at a gay club as Sherlock’s boyfriend. Great. He had been to a gay club before. He wasn’t straight after all. He sighed before he opened his closet to find some clothes he could wear.
(See the end of the chapter for
John sighed dramatically at his roommate Mike. Why did he have to have his girlfriend over tonight? They had been meant to spend this night with eating pizza and staying up late to watch the new season of ‘Stranger things’. But no, no Mike had forgotten and had invited his girlfriend over to stay. So unless he wanted to fall asleep while listening to the other bed creaking all night, he’d have to find someplace to stay for the night. He got up from his bed and went over to his closet to pack his pyjamas.
“I’ve corrected some of your notes, they should be correct now,” He said as he got up from the bed and tossed the ice pack out and went to leave.
They stayed like this for some time. Sherlock correcting the notes in John’s book and the crime scene almost, forgotten. John was interesting.
“I am,” He said before they both turned their head as the door opened again and Murray stepped inside.
“I see you’ve met Sherlock,” He said and gave them both a friendly smile.
“God, you have to look where you’re going Sherlock,” He said with wide eyes as he looked at the brunette.
"Well, dinner's ready soon, just make yourself at home," Melanie said softly and John nodded with a small smile, glancing over at Sherlock again.
"Hmm... reminds me of you." I smile at him.
"Because my job requires me to."
Sophia had given the detective Benjamin's address and he had searched every hiding place a vampire could use near that house. It took almost twelve (exhausting/frustrating) hours of endlessly sneaking around London's streets but finally Sherlock finds Sebastian's hiding place. No doubt Sebastian would have been on the lookout for a chance to get in.
"Of course," She looked down and sniffed. "I met him as a customer ten years ago when I was working as a banker. At first I thought nothing of it but his visits became more frequent and I heard that he's been asking around about me. I had enough of it one day and confronted him but he told me that I'd misunderstood his intentions and he promised to explain it all if I allowed him to. I was curious and he wasn't an easy man to say no to so we sat down together in some quiet cafe. He told me he was a vampire and wanted me to become his companion. I decided to accept it eventually after thinking about it long and hard for days. He had nothing but respect and understanding for me ever since that day until he died." Her voice broke down at the end.
"What is?"
"I want my bag returned to me. I want my stuff too as you insist on me living here and I want to be able to return to my job."
"You're not well. You can't just walk away and pretend that you're not injured. You're gonna bleed out," She shook her head in protest and tried to ease him onto his back again.
"Then I need you to tell me everything you can about him. Any detail, however small might prove essential to solving this case."
They had started to share Sherlock's bedroom a few months ago but now it felt like they'd been sharing it since forever. Sherlock walked out on tiptoe to make as little sound as possible.
There was a tray on the nightstand next  to her bed, containing a bowl of soup, a glass of water, a loaf of bread and some pills. Sherlock had also left her a note: "I've ordered out some food for you. Don't be stubborn. Finish the soup and take those pills. We've already agreed that you won't kill yourself, and that includes starvation."
"Who is he?" Joan asked as she looked up at Sherlock.
"No. I just didn't think you'd feel comfortable with sharing such a fact with somebody else."
"That won't happen," Joan reassured her.
She swallowed visibly and stopped. "Just get it over with, go ahead," she'd found her voice now but it was shaking, "No need to prolong the misery,"
"How did Sebastian come into everything?" Sherlock asked.
Greg nudges John with a grin on his face. " you know, you guys are a pretty beautiful family."
"He'll be fine by tomorrow morning," Mycroft said, "He's very lucky you were the one to find him in such a state and not someone else."
"You know what? It's actually exactly the right time. Moriarty and his people are extremely dangerous. You can't take them down if you aren't at full capacity. It's plain suicide, Sherlock. We both know it."
"All I need is why you were killing vampires and what is that you were looking for and then you'll be convicted by Venenum for life. This is the end for you, Sebastian. I suggest you cooperate."
Silence fell over the flat for a short while before he replied,"Fine. If this is what's necessary to put your mind at ease, so be it." She would be the making of Sherlock, or make him worse than ever, Mycroft wasn't yet sure which one it would be.
She instantly knew where this would lead. "N… no. No way! You just said that there'll be vampires in that bar, Sherlock. Need I remind you that one of them attacked me just recently and tried to kill me?" She was angry at the memory and scared of the threat of its repeat all at once.
"I…I think I am," he looked at her, worried he'd hurt her.
"Hmm.... Not always so easy."
"Alright. I promise."
"That's sweet of you, doctor; it really is. But I don't need your help. In fact, It's probably the other way around. I think you're the one who's in need of my help."
“No,” Sherlock answered, smirking back at him.
“I love you,” John whispered and looked up at him, completely vulnerable from his orgasm.
“So did you figure out more about the stabbing?” John asked as he counted the money.
“I am in good shape,” John protested giggling and his eyes met Sherlock’s and he noticed the small crinkles around them as he smiled widely.

When both of them were seated in the cab, the taller boy leant forward and gave an address to the driver. John narrowed his eyes and looked over at him when he leant back again.
John reached a hand up to press down on the doorbell and he took a step back, biting down on his lip. He took a deep breath as he looked at the door leading inside of the big Holmes house. Dressed in a white shirt and a pair of dark blue jeans and with a present in his hands.
“You can have the rest, I’m not really hungry,” John said, his lips formed into a subtle smile.
“I don’t see why you can’t?” Sherlock argued.
The taller boy pushed past John in the doorway. John glanced up at the apparently desperate boy, who quickly made his way inside of the room, and disappeared again just as fast. What the hell had gotten into him? He hadn’t acted like that at Harrods? Thoughts and worries flew around in his head. Had he done anything wrong? Was he supposed to leave? He didn’t even notice Bill sitting on his bed as John went over to sit down on Sherlock’s bed.
A blonde woman walked out right in front of the blond and he only just avoided colliding with her. Why couldn’t they just look where they were going? It was hard enough trying to keep up with the brunet in the long black coat. How did they expect him to keep an eye on all of the other people here too? It was impossible! And now he was sweating, how could he be sweating? It was freezing! Sherlock’s deep voice was still going through his head: “Remember, he has a knife.”. It was scary, not that he minded. Running after a criminal on an otherwise boring Christmas day was a nice change. John watched as Sherlock turned a corner and he followed, not far behind.
“What do you want to watch?” John asked as he had turned on his computer and was holding out one earphone to him. Sherlock grabbed it and shuffled a bit around on the small bed. Their sides pressed together as John placed the laptop between them. One part of the computer on Sherlock’s thigh and the other part on John’s thigh.
“You’re… in love with me?” He asked quietly, looking up at him. Only now realising just how close they actually were standing, lips only centimetres apart.
"Who was it darling?"  Sherlock's mum asked and Sherlock pulled him into the kitchen where his mum was standing.
“Right, I’ll be at Bill’s, so you two can get finished,” Mike said and winked over at John, who was beet red in his face. The two boys glanced at each other as Mike turned around to leave the room again before John collapsed against Sherlock, giggling. It was a wonderful sound, and Sherlock felt a warmth spreading through his body and his lips curled up into a smile as he once again breathed in John’s scent.
“Yes, the stabbed man’s brother, do keep up John. So, he went to the brother and tried to stab him, but we found him before he had a chance to do anything,” Sherlock finished his explaining and looked up at Lestrade with a small smile.
“A black coffee,” Sherlock said, looking down at his phone as he ordered to the person behind the counter. It wasn’t until he heard the familiar voice of a certain blonde boy he looked up.
“I did, yes, I found the man who stabbed him,” Sherlock said and he saw John’s face light up.
"No, not just a friend," The brunet agreed and looked at John with a shy smile on his lips before he laced their fingers together again and pulled him along.
The blond looked up as the doorknob was turned down and he took another deep breath. Everything was going to be fine. He could do this. His lips curled up into a shy smile, as dark curls could be seen peeking through the door.
John raised his eyebrows again before his own eyes meet Sherlock’s. Since when did he visit clubs? Of course they had a case, but that one was new. A club? A gay club? Okay. John stood up from his chair before he, without another word, made his way to his bedroom.
“Sherlock, no, I have to go,” The blonde tried again, this time turning and their eyes met.
“So what do you need me to do?”
“The scarf you looked at, yes,” John finished with a soft smile and he bit down on his lip.
The brunet hit the wall with a thump and John pressed himself up against him. Their tongues sliding against each other in a desperate attempt to gain control over the other. Sherlock felt the rugby player’s fingers in his hair, clenching around the auburn curls and he couldn’t help the soft whimper that escaped his lips and immediately was swallowed by John. Sherlock reached down to place a hand on John’s arse, giving it a soft squeeze and then it was John’s turn to let out a low groan.
“Were there any witnesses?” He asked and Sherlock shrugged.
Finally, chapter 4 is out!
John was the one to pull away. Both men were panting hard as the looked at each other. A firm hand was placed on Sherlock’s arse, and soon a pair of lips were placed on his neck, licking and sucking. Definitely leaving a mark.
"So, boys, you don't have to keep sitting here if you're finished," Melanie Said softly and she looked over at Sherlock. "I'm sure, there are other things you'd much rather be doing," She hummed and smiled over at John, who felt his cheeks burn. There were a lot of things he'd much rather be doing. But this was nice too. Sherlock was the one to decide that they had had enough and he reached down to grab John's hand and tugged at it. He was clearly tired of sitting there. Sherlock was looking over at Mycroft and the red-haired man was looking right back at him with one side of his mouth curled up into a knowing smirk.
“What?” Sherlock asked him confused.
“What?” John asked him as he probably noticed his confusion and Sherlock shook his head.
“So, what about that crime scene you had a look at?” John finally asked to break the somewhat awkward silence that had filled the room.
“Why won’t you just leave me alone?!” John yelled at him. Sherlock’s eyes flickered to the floor and he swallowed down the lump that had gathered in his throat.
“We wait for Lestrade and his team, they should be here soon,” Sherlock answered and looked at the blond-haired boy.
Before the blonde had the chance to tell him off, his lips were pressed against John’s. The movements were hungry and desperate, and John responded by kissing back, running his tongue over his lower lip. Sherlock parted his lips inviting John to explore and taste all he would like.
“But you’re not denying it,” John almost sing-sang before he went back to Bill’s bed, hearing Sherlock groan behind him.
“Where’s the body?” Sherlock asked, not wanting to waste any more time, and Lestrade followed him through the house to the kitchen. A few pictures had been knocked over in the hallway, and in the kitchen, a flower was lying on the floor beside the man. His shirt had been coloured red with blood. He would have bled to death then.
“Ready?” He asked, and John looked at the screen and nodded.
A tissue was handed to him, and John told him to blow gently into it so all of the blood clots would loosen up. All while John told him that the nosebleed might worsen as he did so, but Sherlock obeyed him. It hurt, but he did it.
John’s excitement fell immediately and was replaced by a frown, “But…” He started before he shook his head.
For once he didn’t say anything. He didn’t even open his mouth to object about what the teacher was teaching them about. He wasn’t listening to what was being said. It wasn’t important. His eyes were on John the whole time. He was important. Sherlock watched him as he time after time put his hand in the air to ask questions, or to answer the teacher. Not once did the blonde boy turn around to look at him. He had to have done something wrong, right? He had probably said something to offend him. It had been a bad idea in the first place. Getting involved. But for some reason, he couldn’t just walk away again. He couldn’t make himself leave him.
So, that's a wrap. (With an extra long chapter, because it's Christmas)
Thank you all for reading and commenting, it has been so amazing :D
The chair scrambled again as John got up and Sherlock followed him with his eyes. Watching him as he went out of the door and came back with the signs that had been standing outside. He closed the door and turned the key before he hurried over to the cash register and began counting up the money.
“Your turn,” He hummed as he reached down and swiftly pulled the shirt over Sherlock’s head. Then it was his turn to explore and touch. He wanted to touch everything, he wanted to know how Sherlock’s skin felt underneath his fingers, and what sounds he would make if he just brushed his thumb over his nipples. Sherlock let out a choked moan and a shiver ran down John’s spine. What a beautiful sound.
Thank you so much for reading, it means a lot :D
“The police needed my help,” The brunette replied, and he could see the confusion on John’s face. He’d have to elaborate.
Once the doctor felt satisfied he glanced into the mirror. A tight, black, V-neck t-shirt showed his muscular neck and was fitted tightly around his biceps, black skinny jeans hugged his figure perfectly and a hint of glitter could be seen on his jaw and neck. He ran a hand through he hair, applying some of the glitter already on his hands to the blonde locks.
“Not hungry,” He said and turned a page in his book.
Sherlock blinked at him, everything slowly began to make sense in his mind.
“Don’t worry about him, he does that sometimes,” Bill explained.
“I know what you’re thinking, doesn’t matter though, he doesn’t eat,” Bill whispered to him and John shook his head. He could try at least, right? He grabbed the pizza box and got up from the bed. The brunette didn’t even look up as John sat down next to him.
"Yes, thanks. Mycroft, don't eat too much," Sherlock said before he turned around, pulling John along with him.
“And who did you bring home this time?” Mike teased the blonde and Sherlock blushed.
It's Christmas and there may or may not be smut involved. (My guess would be the first ;P)
“Yes, I would like that,” Sherlock answered him and smiled.
“Just wait and see,” He answered secretly, almost acting like a little child, and John shook his head.
“How’s your nose?” John didn’t realise he had said anything before he heard himself and saw the corner of Sherlock’s mouth turn upwards. Stupid. John looked down and had almost given up the hope of getting a response when the brunette spoke.
John’s body shivered as he slowly tried to come down from his high. Sherlock was kissing his temple before their lips found each other and Sherlock gently licked into John’s mouth. When he finally regained his senses, he rolled them around so Sherlock was atop of him and he reached up to wrap a stray, damp curl around his finger. Like this, biology definitely wasn’t boring.
John reached a hand up to press down on the doorbell and he took a step back, biting down on his lip. He took a deep breath as he looked at the door leading inside of the big Holmes house. Dressed in a white shirt and a pair of dark blue jeans and with a present in his hands. The Holmes had hung lights in the trees in the front yard and everything looked so big. Much bigger than what John was used to. He chewed on his lower lip as he waited for someone to open the door, nervous about actually meeting Sherlock's parents, and brother, for the first time. What if they didn't like him? What if he didn't come from a good enough family?
“I know, just hear me out,” Sherlock said, desperate to hear what had caused John to act like this.
“How did you learn to do that?” John asked him, and Sherlock gave an exasperated sigh.
“Sorry, Sherlock need my help!” He called back with an apologetic smile.
“Is it okay?” Sherlock asked him in his deep voice.
“Are you okay?” The blonde asked him again, and Sherlock nodded and turned to leave again. The only thing on his mind was that crime scene, and getting there before any of the idiots from the yard would tamper with it. But the blonde held onto his arm and looked up at him.
“You’re staring,” Sherlock commented, looking at him, his smile faltering a bit.
When they had left the room the two boys looked at each other and broke out in giggles for the second time that day. John leaned against Sherlock as he put his head on his shoulder and snickered. That had been ridiculous, kissing in front of Sherlock’s whole family. At the dinner table, nonetheless. Sherlock was giggling too, his shoulders moving up and down as he did so.
“But then it’s a good thing that I have such an amazing roommate, right?” He added, and John could hear the smile on his face.
Analysing every little moment of their date last week. Had it even been a date? He tried to figure out why John hadn’t spoken to him the past week and when everything had gone wrong. Maybe he had just gotten tired of him? Or maybe because Sherlock had dragged him to Harrods? Or maybe John had just been pitying him and he didn’t actually want to spend time with him? That thought hurt. He liked John. He had to figure out what he had done wrong, and most importantly, how to fix things again. Maybe he would even apologise if he had done something wrong?
“Now?” He asked confusedly and Sherlock rolled his eyes and let out an impatient sigh.
“I’m sorry?” Sherlock answered him. The whole class broke out into giggles and Sherlock frowned. He hadn’t said anything funny, had he? His eyes found John’s. He was looking at him and he wasn’t giggling, just staring.
“You can’t possibly know all that, you’ve seen it before,” He said with narrow eyes and Sherlock shook his head. His brown curls bouncing around.
“Mr Holmes?” The sound of his name made him snap out of his train of thoughts and he realised he hadn’t heard a word of what the teacher had said.
“Yes, I heard you the first time Einstein,” John said and Sherlock noticed his hands clenching at his sides. Maybe he should leave?
“Why are you even reading about serial killers?” John asked him and leaned back in Sherlock’s bed.
Both of their confidences built as they stood there with John’s back pressed against the wall. His hands quickly settling in Sherlock’s curls, wanting him closer, wanting more. Sherlock let out a breathless moan that John caught against his mouth. He took the opportunity to deepen the kiss and stepped forward. Sherlock would have to take a step back or else he would lose his balance and take both of them with him in the fall.
“You’re the least irritating person I could think of, so maybe, you’d want to have a look at it?” He finally asked, and John smirked at him.
“Thanks for the help,” He hummed and opened the door, but not before he winked at the blonde boy and closed the door just in time to see his bewildered face.
“Hello there,” John hummed softly to him before he felt Sherlock’s lips on his, and he pressed himself against him. Sherlock’s hands found their place on John’s hips as they kissed. Slowly, softly at first but it soon evolved into a more passionate kiss, filled with need and want.
“No, I want to,” Sherlock said after a while and he finally looked up at John, meeting his gaze with a small smile as he sat back down on the bed.
John leant back in, wrapping his fingers around the base of his cock as he began pressing wet kisses along the entire length of him, leaving the brunet panting and pushing against him, wanting more. Sherlock grabbed the sheets, his knuckles were all white from the tight grip. John wrapped his lips around the head, letting his tongue just tease at the glans and Sherlock whimpered, clenching his hands in John’s hair instead of the sheets.
Once again the blonde was almost choking on his tea. What the hell? Boyfriend? He raised an eyebrow at the brunette who was still deeply concentrated on his microscope. “Sorry, I need to be your boyfriend?” He repeated still shocked.
“What the hell are you doing here?” John’s voice filled the room. It wasn’t warm and soft like it usually were. This time it had an edge to it, he was angry. Not good then.
How far could he take this? He downed the rest of the cold beer and glanced over at John. He leant down, lips right beside his ear, close enough so John could feel his breath. “Let’s dance.” He purred into his ear, earning a raised eyebrow from John.
“And he practically confessed to stabbing him, but then the idiot Anderson interrupted us,” He groaned and let his arm fall to his side, way to dramatically, as a cab stopped.
When Sherlock had finished the last slices in the box, John smiled triumphantly, and Sherlock glared at him.
Once again thank you to whathappenedtomypreviousblog on Tumblr for actually making me write this :)
“That’s not… that’s not what people normally say,” He admitted, and he saw how John smiled at him, and Sherlock looked down until he was reprimanded by John who told him to keep his head up.
“They’re going to rob the house. Money gets killed by the man. So does the other boy, but not before they get chased around the house and finds a woman in the basement. He takes Rocky as a prisoner after they kill the girl down there. At the end, Rocky escapes after killing the blind man and goes to California,” Sherlock said quickly, not able to stop himself. John looked up at him with a raised eyebrow.
“I… I want to touch you,” Sherlock got out and looked down at John with deeply flushed cheeks.
“Oh come on, it’s pizza!” John said and looked over at him, but the boy didn’t look away from his book. He had an idea. He raised an eyebrow and snatched his book. He heard the brunette growl at him, and John only rolled his eyes.
“Not yet,” He admitted, and John could feel himself smirking at him.
“Oh come on John it’s for a case.”
“Woah, what did I miss?” He asked them, and when Sherlock opened his eyes to look at him, he saw him smirking from ear to ear and he felt his cheeks burn. Both him and John stayed quiet, not quite sure of what to say.
“Do you think this would be okay?” Sherlock asked him as he inspected the shirt.
“What are you two still doing here? Go home and get ready for Christmas,” Lestrade said with a warm smile and Sherlock opened his mouth to protest but the man held up a hand.
“Lie down,” John ordered, but Sherlock was already moving and John wriggled out of his lap as Sherlock dragged himself to the head of the bed and lay down. John crawled after him. The brunet scrambled around on the bed and John tried to avoid his arms that were swinging in every direction until he couldn’t anymore and Sherlock’s elbow collided with John’s right eyebrow.
“Shouldn’t you be helping the other customers?” Sherlock asked him with narrow eyes and John looked around.
“Interested in biology, are you?” He asked him, and Sherlock shook his head.
At last, there was only one present lying under the tree. Sherlock had to have saved that for last. It didn’t look like anything special, it was just a small and soft present. But it was the one John had brought. Sherlock sat down on the floor in the middle of everything as he began unwrapping it, and tossed the paper aside. When he looked down again John saw him freeze before he carefully reached out to touch the tasselled ends of the dark blue cashmere, that made out a scarf. The corners of his mouth turned upwards in a soft smile.
“I was starting to think you wouldn’t show up,” John said to him, and he saw Sherlock’s lips curling up into a shy smile.
As always thank for reading, it means so much!
“What are you thinking about?” The other boy asked, and John shrugged at him.
When he finally managed to get his shirt off, he tossed it aside and gazed softly at Sherlock as he felt his warm hands caressing everything within his reach. John’s cheeks felt hot as the brunet was looking at him as if he had to catalogue and save every tiny little detail of his body. He bit down on his lip before he wriggled a bit and then reached out for Sherlock’s shirt.
“Morning,” He hummed, his voice hoarse from sleep and he reached up to carve his fingers through the auburn curls he adored so much.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John!” Sherlock called as the classroom emptied and people went out in the busy hallways again. The blonde didn’t even flinch as he walked out of the door. He had to follow. When he finally caught up with him he reached out and wrapped his long fingers around his arm.
“Where are we going?”
“Is it because you secretly are a serial killer and you’re trying to figure out how not to get caught?” John asked him again and moved closer.
”Why were you in such rush?” The blonde boy looked over at him as he asked and Sherlock turned his head, their eyes met.
“I love you too,” Sherlock answered quietly, meeting his eyes before he reached up to cup his face and began pressing ever so soft kisses to his face, until both of their eyes seemed too heavy to keep open and they both drifted off in a mess of limbs.
“I know, but they’re a bit expensive.” Sherlock sighed annoyed and his lower lip pushed out in a pout.
“What a gentleman you are,” John teased him, trying to forget how nervous he was about this. They were literally breaking into the morgue. The smell of death hit John as he stepped inside. He was going to puke, he was sure of it. Sherlock followed him inside before he went over to the freezer and opened one of the doors. He seemed almost used to this. John was called over as Sherlock pulled the white sheet away from the body.
“Hey John,” A new boy greeted him from inside of the room and John looked over at him.
Before the taller man had time to react John had turned his back to him and a pair of hands were pulling the smaller man close, hands that weren’t Sherlock’s. And John was grinding against the man, allowing him to touch and feel. That should have been Sherlock’s hands and he almost growled at the nameless man.
“Oh, hello John” Sherlock’s voice was calm and raspy as he spoke and he had turned his head against the blonde.
“I should…” He started, but paused again, unsure of what to do. “I should go check on him,” He decided and turned his head towards the bathroom door. It had been quiet for a while, and he was worried. What if he had done something stupid? If he had fallen, and couldn’t get up? John reached up and knocked on the door. Maybe he had just wanted some privacy? When no one answered from the other side of the door, he pushed the knob down.
“I know,” John hummed softly and he broke out grinning as Sherlock looked down, trying to hide the blush that was spreading across his cheeks. He was gorgeous like that. Smiling and blushing. When he didn’t quite know what to do with himself. John’s lips curled upwards as he felt Sherlock’s hand in his and he gave it a soft squeeze as Lestrade came over to them.
“They’re nice,” John replied and looked up at him with a small smile.
“For the last time John, yes, it’s necessary,” Sherlock answered him and pushed the handle on the door down and it opened. John glanced down at his feet and fiddled with the hem of his shirt before he heard Sherlock’s deep voice.
“You’re on the rugby team,” Sherlock commented, and he saw how the blonde raised an eyebrow.

“Well, we were going Christmas shopping, weren’t we?” The brunette asked, and John kept looking back and forth between the building and Sherlock.
“Fuck, sorry,” Sherlock said with an adorable rosy colour painting his cheeks and John chuckled.

“Okay?” John asked him as his eyes scanning Sherlock’s face. He was blushing, his lips were plump from kissing and his pupils were darkened. He looked absolutely gorgeous.
The blonde man in the kitchen nearly chocked on his tea. Had he heard it right? Had his flatmate just said that? He shook his head softly as he tried to make any sense of that sentence. “Uhm?” John glanced at the brunette with a frown.
“I can’t afford anything in there,” John said, and Sherlock shrugged at him. A moment later John felt a warm hand in his own, and he was tugged along the brunette, none of them realising what had happened before Sherlock looked down at their hands and his cheeks turned beet red.
“Maybe? I don’t know, she looked nice, don’t you think?” John muttered and glanced back at the door.
“John!” Bill’s deep voice sounded once again in the small room, and John looked over at him, something told him that this wasn’t the first time he had tried to get his attention.
“Mmh yes, I think so?” John said and leant back against one of the tables with clothes on as he saw Sherlock going over to an employee.
“Why not?” The brunette asked him with a furrowed brow.
The two boys sat on the bed for a while, none of them saying a word. Nor when John handed Sherlock, the ice pack and he held it to his nose. It didn’t hurt as much now. Sherlock moved from the bed to get a book before he sat back down with the blonde and began reading in his book. Boring. Biology was boring. He felt the bed move as John scooted closer to him and peered over his shoulder.
“Lestrade” He greeted, and the other man nodded at him.
"For me? Why?"
"War: that's what existed before this. And yes, if I'm forced to choose, I actually do prefer the peace arrangement. Humans don't get murdered by vampires in millions and vampires don't starve and go mad. This is a very small price to pay for the peace we all have now, if you ask me. It's much better this way."
"A subconscious bond? You mean like a mental one?"
"Years ago, I fell in love with Jim, and I knew exactly what he was. At some point, I wanted to leave; to put him behind me and run away but I couldn't, something just kept pulling me back towards him, like an invisible thread. And then I realised that I was meant to be by his side. And that's exactly where you stand right now. You love Sherlock but you can't admit it, not even to yourself. So you want to run with all your strength and never look back. But you don't. You're still here. Because something keeps bringing you back to him."
Joan's dead body was at the bottom of the grave. Her neck was ripped open and her eyes were shut. The blood had turned her golden hair red and the white nightgown she was wearing was stained with blood almost everywhere.
"I wouldn't expect you to do so. Your instinct to protect your companion is completely understandable," Oleander's lips curled up into a smirk.
"That's what he'll tell me himself. I just need you to give me his address if you have it."
He went over to the kitchen and came back with a food delivery bag and handed it to her. "Here; your breakfast."
"Gay? I'm not. I'm bi." This time I can't bring myself to look into his (beautiful) eyes. "Christ. I don't even know if you date men. I just ruined everything, didn't I? I'm sorry, Sherlock. Forget I ever said that, ok?"
"Your attacker would have killed you. I had to stop him. And you've met Venenum now. You've seen how stubborn and dangerous they are."
"How did I end up with someone like you?"
"After I disobeyed you, you must want to kill me, at the very least in order to get rid of me. So get it done."
"Let's just say you got lucky." He beamed and gave Sherlock a quick kiss. "But so did I. Come on, you better get ready. We have the whole day to ourselves. Then we'll dine at Angelo's."
Sebastian was being kept in a mostly dark cell-like room under heavy chains and locks."Joan Watson… what a surprise," He looked up once she opened the door. "To what do I owe the pleasure?" he asked curiously with a grin.
She looked at her shoulder and noticed them."You really do live up to your reputation," she chuckled a little.
"You come to my house and accuse me of murder?"
"I'm fine. Just busy with a case."
"You're the one who turned him? Into a vampire, I mean," she stated. The words hung in the air as if they would stay there forever.
"Oh, Sherlock..." Mycroft sighed and shook his head in disappointment.
"I have to. You've been stabbed. This can kill you. You need to be treated in a hospital," she argued.
I'm shaking with excitement. He's sitting in front of me while we're dining at Angelo's.
Her first instinct was to call an ambulance but Sherlock is a vampire and there's nothing a hospital could do for him. Plus, the night they'd met, he'd refused an ambulance so she dismissed the thought entirely.
"Why did you meet her here?" Joan asked.
"There are actual human lives at stake, Sherlock. Just so I know, do you care about that at all?"
"What?!"
"Is it normal for companions to have relationships and get engaged while being a companion?" Joan asked Sherlock in a whisper. Vampires seemed to be possessive creatures as far as she knew.
Joan sighed but nodded. "Fine. I'll just go and have a shower then, shall I?"
"Because you're the only one who can protect her in case I can't."
"And what If I can't stop you?"
"Alright then. Tell me, Were you expecting something like this to happen to you or were you just taking precautions after the night you were attacked?"
"Sophia's life is in danger. Sebastian tried to kill her. Tell us everything from the beginning or this will get so much worse. A lot of people died because of him and more still may, including Sofia."
We get home and he plays his violin while I make two mugs of hot chocolate. Again he'd deny this if asked but he has a sweet tooth and loves chocolate.
"I don't want to talk about this," he got up to leave but she blocked his way.
Throughout this fic, I will put in a few OCs (chapters that are made up by me); they're not gonna be overly important to the story if I'm being honest but they'll be side characters.
"Alright. I'll be there soon."
Joan's sentence, however simple and unimportant it may seem to an outsider, managed to put a smile on Sherlock's lips. Hearing Joan address herself like that made him feel strangely and unexplainably... happy.
"John?"
"Yes. I will tell YOU how I think all of this happened."
I can't help but laugh. "Ok. Ok. You're right."
"Remember what?"
She looked up at him, hoping to make him see the situation from her perspective somehow. "I won't stop, Sherlock. You can't lock me up in a flat and expect me to do nothing. I am not a slave or a hostage. So you either have to let me go or kill me. I'm not going to apologise for wanting to be free."
Sherlock's eyes widened in surprise; why would a human save a vampire's life? Joan had already saved his life once and he had imprisoned her afterwards, why would she do it again?
Sherlock looks at John and smiles , " I've already got my wish." He says and blows the candles. Everyone claps, even Rosie and John Watson is the happiest man alive in that moment.
"By the way, your companion - what are you going to do about her?"
He took a few printed photos out of the file in his hand and spread them on the table in front of her. They were photographs of a woman lying dead in some dirty looking living room. She looked up at him in shock, he sighed and rolled his eyes." Oh perhaps I should mention. I didn't kill her."
"That's absurd. No one owns anyone." He frowned.
"Your reputation precedes you, Mr Holmes," She nodded.
"But if the cause of death really is poisoning, wouldn't autopsy pick that up?"
Her right palm was bleeding...
Joan returned from work at 4:15 P.M the next day. As she stepped into the living room, she saw piles of evidence and papers.
"What is that?"
"About what?"
Where he was going or the fact that he was soaking wet by now didn't really matter to Sherlock. All he cared about was that his head felt less heavy and the gentle breeze in the air and the rain had somewhat cooled down his skin. In London, he never even needed to have an actual destination as he knew the city like the back of his hand. He could simply find his way back when he was ready to return.
"She's at my flat." He replied simply and shortly. Venenum was seriously trying his patience now.
"But you do?”
"You poisoned those two vampires because Moriarty ordered you to do so. There was a third target but when you and Moriarty found out Benjamin had something that you wanted, you chose him as the next target instead. But he was a step ahead of you and had already left everything to Sophia. You wanted to steal what you were looking for but she saw you. You'd rather kill her than let her get away but you had strict orders not to do anything to reveal the secret of our kind's existence. So you fled from the scene and talked to Moriarty afterwards. Then you two agreed that Sophia was a witness and a great risk so she had to be eliminated. Nothing- not even your own life mattered more than what Benjamin had left to her so you kept on chasing her."
"Three days."
"I thought I'd warned you not to try and trick me. You really should have known better than this," he growled under his breath but still remained unabated.
"I am sorry, Sherlock, but as far as I can see, you're one of the main suspects in this scenario."
“I thought you had a right to know. You are one side of this bond after all."
"But I've already told you that it's ok. I did deserve it. I'm not angry with you."
He looks down and his expression is impossible to read. "I was tortured."
"And you said he left everything he owned to you?"
"Want to see some more?"
"I never meant for her to get hurt. I loved her-" he looked at Sophia and continued, "but I wasn't blind. I knew you were cheating on me with him, Sophia."
"Vampires have existed for a very long time. In the old days; when they'd write a contract or any written form of a promise or a deal, they'd sign it with a drop of their own blood as a gesture of good faith."
"Look, I have to say something to you and it may destroy our friendship but you deserve to know it nonetheless."
"Look, I am content to be your companion but I think we need to set some boundaries. This has to be based on mutual trust. And I can't trust you on this matter if I can't have at least some extent of freedom."
"What?!"
"What happened to me?" Sherlock asked with a sleepy voice.
"Every time I held you, that's when. I'd ask you about it indirectly but you'd never reply. He would text you in the middle of the night and you'd just go. You'd always go to him, you'd never say no, not even once. You introduced him to me as your cousin but I didn't buy it. Despite all of that, I still stood by you. After we got engaged, it just got worse so I did some digging. I found out what he really was. When you told me you were pregnant, I couldn't take it anymore, I flipped and then left. But I still loved you."
"I don't have to tell you anything at all."
He pulled on his hair in frustration. "Why don't you understand?! Look, There's a council of ten vampires out there who have set some laws a long time ago and make sure that everyone obeys them and their laws. If you leave, you'll reveal my secret. Do you know what will happen after that? The members of this said council will find you and they'll behead you and then they'll come after me and kill me," he paused and breathed heavily, "They're called 'Venenum'; It's the Latin word for poison. No one knows who they are; they've changed their names to the names of poisonous plants to conceal their true identities. They're powerful and ancient and they won't stop at anything to keep the existence of vampires a secret in order to keep the peace we all presently have."
"Bit of friendly advice? Do yourself a favour and run. Run and don't look back. Sherlock will shed blood sooner than later, he will kill; every vampire eventually does and despite what you believe, he's no exception. If you don't want to share the guilt of the blood that will be on his hands, then run away while you still have the chance. I was fine with this aspect of being a companion and I still am. I was a sniper before I met Jim and in a way, I'm still a sniper of sorts. Not much has changed for me after I became a companion. But I can see that you're struggling with it. You want to think that there's an out for me and therefore for you. That companions aren't affected as much as you fear by the vamps. Let me be clear, you're wrong. You're not cut out for being a companion and the guilt will eat you up if you don't put an end to it very soon."
“After you,” He said and John glanced up, realising the brunette was holding the door for him.
“Are you coming?” Sherlock asked and the blonde boy frowned.
“Not hungry,” He mumbled and John rolled his eyes. He paid for his coffee and grabbed two sugars before he sat down in the empty shop. With his phone in his hand, he pretended to look at something important, while he secretly kept throwing glances over at John, who suddenly had disappeared from his sight.
The beat was beating in the brunette’s ears, and the smell of sweat and alcohol filled the air as they entered the club. His eyes scanned the room quickly. It should be an interesting night. A pair of men was having a make-out session besides them and he glanced at John.
“I thought you were a genius.” He didn’t even attempt stopping the comment from coming out of his mouth, but the brunette just gave a small huff.
John nodded desperately in return. “Yes, god, yes, it’s perfect,” He panted against his skin.
“You did an interrogation?” He asked him surprised, and he saw Sherlock shrugging before he raised an arm to hail down a cab.
“Easy, you texted that you had let him go, it wasn’t hard to figure out that he would go to his brother,” Sherlock said and John frowned.
“No.”
“Do you see other costumers?” John asked him with a cheeky smile and Sherlock shook his head. They both went silent and the only sound was John fiddling with the paper around his muffin and the noise from outside.
“And you’re a medical student. You don’t have a lot of money, so you’re here on a scholarship. Otherwise, you couldn’t afford going here.” He added and cocked his head at him as the other boy stayed silent, just looking at him with slightly parted lips. This could only have one outcome. It was only a matter of time before he would get kicked out of the room and told to ‘Fuck off’. But it didn’t come. He wasn’t getting kicked out. Instead, he was with another minute of silence.
Sherlock allowed himself to sit down by the bar, observing John’s reaction to being here. He seemed to… enjoy it? Mr ‘I’m not gay’ Watson, was enjoying being at a gay club. He wasn’t appalled by the men snogging and he was ogling the dancers. Definitely not bothered by being at a gay bar.
“I didn’t ‘learn’ that, I simply observe, John.”.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” He said as the two boys crawled away from the man and pulled the man up from the ground. Sherlock put his hands behind his back as he stood back and let Lestrade take the man over to the car where a few other police officers were standing. “You’re welcome,” Sherlock said and sighed dramatically.
He could tell the blonde boy was looking at him. Trying hard to get it through his little, (but gorgeous) head, what Sherlock had just tried to tell him. He didn’t look up, he knew how people usually reacted, this could be worse. A warm and friendly voice caught him off guard and made him look over at John again.
(See the end of the chapter for
At some point in the night, Bill got up from where he had been lying for the past three episodes with the excuse of having to go to the loo. With that, he left the room and John and Sherlock were alone again. John paused the episode they were watching and looked over at Sherlock. He had put the book down long ago and was now doing an experiment in the corner. As soon as the door closed behind Bill, the brunette looked over at John, almost hesitantly. John’s eyes flickered to Sherlock’s, and he tilted his head.
“Kiss me,” Sherlock ordered him and he felt John looking up at him. His eyes scanning his face, before he felt his calloused hands coming up to the nape of his neck and pulled him down ever so gently. His eyes fluttered closed as he dipped his head, putting his hands on John’s hips and their lips brushed together. It was barely enough to call a kiss as John pulled back again and Sherlock looked at him, noticing his cheeks had turned into a lovely pink colour. He pulled the blonde closer and pressed their lips together again.
“Don’t care, helps me think,” Sherlock mumbled quietly.
“Someone has been killed, and because the yard is complete idiots they need someone clever, so they call me,” He explained, but he didn’t see any change in John’s expression.
“None of your business,” Sherlock answered him and opened the book again.
“Can I have this in the biggest size available?” The brunette asked her seriously, and John raised his hand to his mouth to stop himself from giggling at Sherlock’s comment.
John’s head fell back on Sherlock’s shoulder again as he tried to catch his breath again, but his head was tipped back as Sherlock pulled his hair and he began kissing his neck.
John looked up at his boyfriend before he began pressing open-mouthed kisses down over his ribs and belly before he nibbled cheekily at one of his hip bones. He reached up and began working on Sherlock’s trousers. When he finally got them open he tugged at them. Sherlock lifted his hips, making it easier for John to get the trousers and pants off and then toss them aside with the rest of their clothing. John was seated between Sherlock’s long legs with his hands resting softly on his knees as he watched Sherlock in front of him.
“We need to talk. You have been avoiding me all week, when I texted, you didn’t answer. I showed up in class today and you only looked at me once, when all of the other people were laughing, which I don’t understand why? I didn’t do anything funny.  And when I tried to talk to you afterwards you kept claiming you had to go and that you wanted me to leave you alone, though you were lying, you don’t want me to leave, so I think we have to talk,” Sherlock said quickly, looking up at the blonde boy who was standing with crossed arms. When he finally moved he was glaring at him.
Sherlock lifted the yellow police tape and went inside of the little white house. The façade could have tricked everyone. No one would think that someone would have been killed in there. But people did strange things sometimes. The brunette was immediately met by the dark haired man he had come to know over the time they had worked together.
And a special thanks to eggskiegg-godesend :D
“I asked you if that was all?” John repeated and looked up at him with a tired smile on his lips.
“Not particularly, it’s boring,” He answered flatly as he turned a page in the book. The next page was filled with pictures of the nervous system, and besides, it was a lot of sloppy notes written with a pencil. Sherlock’s lips curled up into a small smile as he asked for a pen and started correcting the notes that had been written.

“And who did you bring home this time?” Mike teased the blonde and Sherlock blushed.
“Or dinner?” John suggested with a shy smile and Sherlock nodded.
“You can be a gentleman too I see,” Sherlock teased him and John grinned at him. It was a wonderful sight. The brunette looked around in the room, everything looked almost like the first time he had been here. Clothes were still tossed on the ground and a bag with rugby gear was placed at the bottom of the bed.
Soon after Sherlock found himself crouching in front of John’s room, trying to pick the lock. Mike wasn’t there and John was still at Rugby practice, or he would be in the showers by now. All sweaty and filthy. Sherlock flushed as he realised where his thoughts were going and he shook his head. He had to focus on getting the door open and getting inside.
“You’re no fun then,” John complained, and he could almost see Sherlock’s irritation when he didn’t give him his book back.
“Shh, they’re going to hear you!” He giggled and Sherlock blushed and bit down on his lip to quiet down the following moans.
“So, do you want a bite?” The blonde asked him. Sherlock didn’t get to answer before a piece of the muffin was held in front of his mouth. He pursed his lips together and looked over at John who only sighed at him and kept holding the piece of muffin up until the brunette finally took it.
“Are you not going to buy anything?” He asked him with a small frown, and John almost laughed.
"Thanks," He muttered and he felt Sherlock taking his hand and his finger's curled around the much larger hand.
Once they were both seated in a cab on their way back to Sherlock’s room, John glanced over at him.
Why would there be so many people on the street right now? It was Christmas day for god’s sake! People should be at home, preparing for tomorrow. Not out here in the snow, where they would just be in the way.
Sherlock’s hand just stayed there, he didn’t do anything, almost as if he was scared to do something wrong. John had to help then. He pressed his lips to Sherlock’s neck and began pushing into his hand and slowly Sherlock’s fingers curled around him. It felt amazing. He felt a heat going through his veins as he kept pushing into Sherlock’s hand and mouthed at his neck and shoulder.
Sherlock must have looked confused since John chuckled at him, but he didn’t explain what he had meant. Was it that obvious? Sherlock reached over the table and took a piece of John’s muffin, just to do something else.
“So, the man didn’t die,” John said as the movie ended and he looked up at Sherlock.
Their tongues danced together, fighting each other, trying to get control over the other’s tongue. Sherlock released John’s hands and they were immediately placed on his body, pulling him closer. A moan slipped out between his lips as he pushed his hips forward and into the smaller man’s body.
“Yes, but not in bloody Harrods?!”
“Of course,” John replied.
“You were about to walk out in front of a car. Do you have a death wish?” John questioned.
The pizza was placed in Bill’s bed, and both him and John gather around it. John is finding a pair of scissors to cut out the pizza, while Bill is setting up his computer and logging onto Netflix. There were only a few minutes until the new season would be released, and John couldn’t be more excited. He glanced over at the brunette boy on the other side of the room. He had gone back to examining whatever was under his microscope and ignoring both John and Bill completely. John couldn’t help but feel a little sting in his chest over it. What was so interesting that he couldn’t maybe try to join in on their conversation? And why couldn’t he just leave that microscope alone for a minute? He could be interesting too. Bill pulled him out of his thoughts as he put a hand on his arm and smiled up at him.
"Oh yeah?"
"How so?"
She rubbed her forehead, "I had this bad feeling all day but I kept ignoring it. I should have noticed something was wrong with him."
"So that means it's really true."
"So your solution is to starve yourself?"
She giggles again and reaches out for him and Sherlock holds her as if she's his own.
"It's the formula of the antidote. After Julia and David's deaths, Benjamin was the only one left who had the formula to stop the poison and these killings."
"When he confronted me about what happened and I had to tell him about you, he said that's exactly how I'm supposed to feel about my companion. It was as if he'd been expecting this to happen for a while."
"What?! Why?"
"Many say they are often the same thing," Joan shrugged.
"How long have you known about this?" He asked.
"Try to remain calm. I'm on my way," Mycroft abruptly ended the call.
Sherlock froze, John wasn't even sure if he was even breathing.
She sighed; "Alright. You want to talk? Fine. Go ahead. I'm all ears." Joan was still tense but deep down she was also curious to hear what he had to say.
"You know who he is?" Sophia asked, looking between the two of them.
What happened after that was foggy and blurry in Sherlock's memory. He could only remember the taste of blood taking over all his other senses. It was unlike anything he'd ever experienced before. The thirst he had been feeling up until now was like having each of his veins on fire and drinking her blood felt like extinguishing that fire with clear cool water.
"Vampires tend to see themselves superior to their companions so no, it's unusual; except for a few vampires who wish to support and protect their companions financially even after their own death but I don't think Sophia would need Benjamin's money."
“Mike, this is Sherlock, my friend. Sherlock, this is Mike, my roommate,” John said and Sherlock nodded at the boy.
“I don’t have any money for this,” Sherlock spat as he took down a dark blue scarf and looked over at John.
"I... I didn't know what to wear, so..." John started before he was cut off by Sherlock as he kissed him softly.
Even his voice seemed deeper than normal. John could only nod as an answer to his question. He turned around in the door and started making his way out of the flat, Sherlock following him closely.
And Happy Holidays to all of you :D
The blond felt Sherlock’s lips on his earlobe, sucking on it and ever so gently letting his teeth brush over the skin there and John moaned.
”John I need you.”
“What do you want to get him?” He asked him as his eyes flickered over to him. Suddenly Sherlock was running off for the umpteenth time that day. John followed him as fast as he could, and he saw the younger boy stopping as he held out a plain white button-down and looked over at John.
“It’s okay, don’t worry love,” He said and kissed his inner this once more.
“Oh, and I’m John, John Watson,” The boy, John, said and Sherlock nodded.
“I want my book back now,” Sherlock said, and John sighed deeply.
“Don’t know, haven’t talked to him yet, Lestrade won’t let me,” He said and sighed dramatically, to which John rolled his eyes and closed the cash register.
There had been a stabbing. Lestrade had texted him in the middle of a biology class which he naturally hadn’t been attending. He knew the stuff anyway, and the teachers didn’t like him seeing as he always ended up correcting them. So, of course, he had to go and see what the yard needed help to now. Even if it ended up being a simple crime, anything would be better than having to listen to his teachers.
Sherlock got up from the floor and wrapped his arms around him tightly. “Thank you, it’s perfect,” He hummed into his neck before he pulled away and looked up at him with regret in his eyes.
Once again, the blonde glanced at his phone. Maybe Sherlock had actually forgotten? And had just taken a cab back again? But it wouldn’t seem like Sherlock to forget a thing like this, he had seemed to look forward to it the past week and kept reminding John every time they had talked, but now he was starting to doubt it. They had planned to meet half an hour ago, and he was freezing his arse off.
“Sherlock,” He muttered and sat down on the bed he had been shown to.
“What do you think of these?” Sherlock asked him and handed him the black shoes.
A few moments later a pair of hands were put on John’s shoulders, and he turned his head to see the familiar brunette behind him.
“You really do have a death wish,” The blonde said before he slammed the door to the bathroom and stormed out in the halls again, his nails digging into his palm.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered quietly, still looking at him. He saw the blonde’s lips curl up into a kind smile as he gave a few nods.
“Right,” John answered slightly out of breath and he kept his eyes on the man beneath them.
“Like the muffin?” The blonde asked him as he stuffed the piece into his mouth, and he shrugged. Sherlock looked down at the table as John pushed the rest of the muffin over to him and smiled.
John looked around in the hallway with wide eyes. A lovely smell from the kitchen hit him and he sighed contently.
“You’re disgusting,” He laughed and Sherlock froze before he saw the glint in his eyes. He hadn’t meant it as a bad thing then.
“The medical student was easy. Your books say everything I need to know. That your family doesn’t have a lot of money, I got from your shoes. They’re worn out, people would have bought new ones by now, but you haven’t. Also, you don’t have a lot of (extra things? Nips) which indicates that your family can’t afford this, but since you play rugby and you’re here you must have some sort of scholarship.” He explained quickly, almost stumbling over the words and he took in a deep breath at the end.
“Well hello to you too John,” Bill muttered from his side of the room and John snapped back to reality and looked over at him.
“Is it really that obvious?” John asked, sounding almost hopelessly, and Bill nodded with a smug smile.
The dinner went okay. Sherlock's mum had endless questions for John, and Sherlock too. She asked them about for how long they had known each other, how they had met and why Sherlock hadn't brought him over before. Every time John answered a question and Sherlock thought the topic was getting too boring, he interrupted him with a new snarky comment that made John giggle. Especially the ones about his brother were though to sit through while trying not to laugh. The two boys kept throwing glances at each other whenever the topic landed on politics. Which it often did because of the older Holmes' brother, who according to Sherlock was the entire British government. Not that John believed that. One person couldn't have that much power, could he?
“How could I forget about this?” He replied, and John got up from the bench and smiled at him.
“Because I just can’t!” John answered him, his hands clenched at his sides again.
“Yeah, I figured that much,” Sherlock said and John chuckled at him.
Well, or so he thought.  “Oi! You alright there?” He heard a boy call, and he turned his head to see the blonde boy running towards him. Why did this happen to him? Now, this boy would take up his time, and he wouldn’t be able to go and see the crime scene. He sighed as the boy came over and put a hand on his shoulder.
John’s warm fingers were placed in Sherlock’s as they got up, and the brunette pulled the smaller man out on the dance floor with him. Suddenly they were facing each other, pressed close by the other people, and moving in sync with the beat.
“Everyone out!” He heard Lestrade order behind him, and he sat down next to the body.
“Why not?”
“Oh. Hi John,” He said, and John looked at him in confusion. Oh right. Sherlock. The clever boy he had helped with a nosebleed.
“Did I do something?” Sherlock asked quietly. He had to know. He wanted to fix what had happened between them. He missed him. The past week had been agony.
Sherlock noticed that John had lifted an eyebrow as he looked at him. A challenge. The detective cocked his head slightly before he stepped closer to the doctor. Dancing closer. Almost touching. Skin brushing against skin. Jesus this was heaven and hell at the same time.
“Right, thank you,” Lestrade said as he cuffed the man.
Sherlock pushed past the crowd of people on the pavement. Did everyone have to be out, right this moment? Right when he craved something to calm his mind, to help him think. He manoeuvred past the crowd of people walking around him. Girls in way too short dresses and showing way too much cleavage. Not that he cared. He couldn’t care less about them.
“God, you’re so beautiful like this John,” Sherlock breathed and John only could pant his name as a response. John kept pushing his hips into the brunet’s hand and it only took a few more thrusts before Sherlock’s name spilled over his lips and he went completely pliant atop of him and a sticky white mess spread between them.
John looked at the lovely boy before him and he crawled up on the bed, straddling his thighs and he reached up to cup his cheeks. John took one last look at the brunet before he leaned forward again and kissed him again. They wouldn’t get very far like this, while they were still sitting on the edge of the bed. But it was enough for now. The blond enjoyed the feeling of Sherlock melting beneath him. He broke their lips apart again and began pressing his lips to his jaw. Sherlock tilted his head back, giving him more room to work on as he kissed him softly.
Sherlock stepped back and they stumbled around on the floor for a while. John kept stepping forward, trying to steer the brunet back against the bed, without making one of them lose their balance. It was a lot harder than it looked in the movies. When Sherlock’s knees finally hit the edge of the bed both of them opened their eyes and Sherlock pulled back with a tiny gasp. As if he hadn’t expected this.
“Sorry?” Sherlock muttered as he hadn’t heard what John had asked him about and his cheeks flushed so he glanced away again.
John leant down to kiss Sherlock’s knee and he let his hands move over the soft skin of his inner thighs. He glanced up at him once more before he set to kissing a soft trail along the inside of his thigh before he found himself with his lips parted around the hard flesh. Sherlock moaned loudly above him and John pulled off.
“The interrogation was interesting,” He mumbled as some kind of excuse, and the blonde’s eyes widened.
Sherlock squirmed on the bed as he tried to make out an answer. “I… I don’t know,” He finally got out and John only shifted to his right nipple.
Sherlock glanced down. John was smirking? God he wanted to tear that smirk off his face. The brunette man pushed the smaller man up against the nearest wall, pinning his hands above his head. God he looked gorgeous like this.
“It’s just not like you to be late,” John pointed out, and Sherlock shook his head.
He was sweet, and handsome, and was this a date? The thought hit him hard, and he bit down on his lip. Did he want this to be a date? He glanced down at his watch to cover the shy smile on his lips. They had spent hours in here already. Sherlock pulled him out from his thoughts with a sharp voice,
“Because you have been ignoring me all week and-“
“Just leave, will you?” John said, his voice exasperated.
John opened the door for Sherlock and smirked up at him.
“Can we go home now? I need something.” He said and began pulling John out on the street.
“Let’s do it.”
“That you worry about him? Yes, most definitely,” Bill answered him and the blonde boy felt his cheeks burn.
“Thanks,” Sherlock answered around a new mouthful of muffin and he smiled over at him. Sherlock could hear John laugh.
“It’s okay, I’m fine,” John assured him before he scrambled around for a bit, trying to find a comfortable position between Sherlock’s legs.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John,” Sherlock said with a sigh.
“Yes. All fine. I just… I’ve never….” He mumbled quickly. His eyes were nailed to the floor as he spoke.
“Yes, but not in bloody Harrods?!”
“Why won’t you just tell me what I did?” He answered with a shaky voice. He simply couldn’t lose him. Not now. He watched as John turned around and reached up to rub his face. Sherlock stood up from the bed, he should go. Give him some time maybe? When he turned around again they were much closer than they had been before.
“Because her roommate wouldn’t leave,” Mike explained and looked over at him.
“So, what can I do for you?” Murray asked him, and John placed his bag on the floor.
“I would hardly have died if that car hit me, it was driving way too slow,” Sherlock informed him as he carried on walking.
“What part? Kissing me, or getting caught by Mike?” John asked him as he uncurled from his arms.
“Hey John,” A new boy greeted him from inside of the room and John looked over at him.
“Because I’m in love with you…” John said, “I’m in love with you and you’re an addict and it’s bloody confusing!” He continued and his eyes flickered to Sherlock’s.  “And I can’t just stand here and watch you ruin yourself!” The blonde said.
“Yes, now? When else?” He asked with an exasperated voice. John glanced back at the computer on Murray’s bed. He could go with Sherlock, right? Surely Bill wouldn’t mind that. With that, he got up from the bed and grabbed his own jacket before he followed the taller boy outside. John spotted Murray longer down the hall and he heard him call his name after him.
The brunette had to think for a few seconds for an answer. Right his excuse. The case. He settled for a smug smile and a challenging, raised eyebrow as he grabbed his hand, dragging him up to the bar.
He finally found a place when Sherlock spread his legs a bit. Experimentally Sherlock rolled his hips up against John’s and the blond let his head fall down against Sherlock’s chest with a quiet groan. Even through the two layers of trousers, he could clearly feel Sherlock through them. John answered Sherlock’s roll with his hips by rocking ever so softly back and forth between his legs. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed and his lips parted in a soft string of moans and he pushed back against him, desperately seeking more.
“Sorry, Sorry,” Sherlock said brokenly as he looked down at John, who had tears in his eyes.
"Not just a friend I see," Sherlock's mum said after someone, (None of them was quite sure of who it was), clearing their throat and both John and Sherlock looked over at her with flushed cheeks.
And a special thanks to my favourite Serb eggskiegg-godesend :D
“The stabbed man’s brother?” He asked and Sherlock sighed.
“That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” John said as they leant back against the wall and tried to get their breaths back.
“You’re getting your book about…” He checked the front page, “Serial killers, back when you have eaten at least one slice,” John ordered and looked over at him. Sherlock stared back at him as he sat up and reached out to take one of the slices in the box and reluctantly took a bite of the slice.
“You can’t be right about all that,” John said and Sherlock shrugged, but kept watching the movie.
“You took me to Harrods?” John asked, staring at the building. It was only when Sherlock spoke that he looked away again.
“After you,” He said and Sherlock glanced over at him with a small smile.
“I have practice,” John said, not turning around as he tried to pull his arm away from him again.
Another customer came into the shop and John left his chair to make the young woman a coffee to go. Sherlock’s eyes didn’t leave the blonde this time, and he noticed John checking her out. He looked at her just a tad too long and was obviously flirting with her. He wasn’t surprised when the girl left her number on the bill. Though he was surprised when John came over and sat down next to him again.
Suddenly the ground seemed much more interesting to look at, and he hoped that the blonde hadn’t been able to see him blush. When he looked up again, it was too late, and he collided with a pole. Who had been so stupid and placed that pole there? People were supposed to be walking there! He glanced over at the blonde boy, who had luckily disappeared and therefore hadn’t seen him walk into the pole. And he wouldn’t see his now completely beet red cheeks.
He slammed the door to his room behind him. Why couldn’t he figure out what had gone wrong? It was frustrating, especially when he so desperately wanted to change it. He had to. He wasn’t sure how he could be by himself again and not get involved. He went straight to his bed and flopped down on it with a dramatic sigh. Bill wasn’t there, he had classes and practice. With John. He curled together on his bed, putting his head in his hands and slowly began drifting off into his own world.
Hi again
“Wow… amazing” John commented after a moment of stunned silence.
“And now you’re staring,” John commented and Sherlock could feel his cheeks turn pink and he looked down, trying to hide his blush. “I mean, I know I’m handsome,” The blonde added and winked at him, making Sherlock go even redder.
“Well, I’m glad to see you two finally cut the crap,” He hummed.
“What do you think about when you…” He asked him.
The reaction he got from John was close to non-existent. He didn’t mind the men snogging right beside them. Their fingers brushed together and he noted John’s body go stiff for a second before relaxing again.
“Too many clothes,” He breathed and John pulled back and his shirt was pulled up. It caught by his arms and John’s couldn’t help but giggle and he heard Sherlock huff and grumble over the stuck shirt.
I promise it'll be okay again ;)
“What about it?” The other boy asked, and he was looking over at John.
"No need to be so formal, just call me Melanie," She said with a soft smile and she glanced over at Sherlock.
"What?" Sherlock asked him and turned to look at him and John kept staring at the plant hanging above them.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” John asked the brunette who was crouching in front of the door to the morgue.
Sherlock looked up at the faces of the people around him, trying to figure out who could have anything that might be useful. No one seemed to fit the criteria. His ice-blue eyes looked around him. A coffee would have to do then. He crossed the road, not looking to his sides and went into an empty coffee shop.
“Here, let me,” John chuckled as he began working his arms free, wriggling atop of the other boy. As he did so, Sherlock’s hands resumed their careful exploration of the newly exposed skin in front of him.
“I’m not trying to be fun, can I have my book now?” He asked again, and John sighed.
“What the hell Sherlock!”
“Look at that, he speaks!” John said looking up at him, and the brunette could see the cheeky glint in his eyes. He responded with a roll of his eyes. He could have been at the crime scene now. If the boy – John – Hadn’t been distracting him.
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll do more ridiculous things in the future,” Sherlock hummed and John could feel him looking at him. John turned his head and met his eyes with a shy smile.
“So, you were on your way to a crime scene?” John asked him, and the brunette gave a relieved sigh. He understood then. Sherlock nodded before he handed John the book.
“So, as usual, the youngest starts,” Melanie hummed and everyone looked over at Sherlock who rolled his eyes and went over to grab the biggest present he could find for himself.
The taller boy was looking back at John with a look filled with self-consciousness and John bit down on his lip. He let his eyes wander down over his chest and belly, that was quickly rising and falling with each breath Sherlock took. He allowed himself to look at the trail of dark curly hair that went from his navel and down into a denser nest around his cock that was lying against his belly, flushed and erect.
“It’s fine, it doesn’t matter,” He hummed and reached out for his hand, giving it a small squeeze.
“You did?! That’s great!” He said all excitedly.
Oh. Yes, sure a case. How could he not have figured that out? Of course it was a case. John looked down at his tea again with s shy smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. The taller man by his side got up and he felt the icy blue eyes running over his body, scanning him.
John looked around in the gigantic building with his lips slightly parted. When he looked to where the taller boy had been standing just a couple of seconds ago, he couldn’t see him again. With his brows drawn together, he looked around, trying to find him amongst all of the other people that had gone Christmas shopping. He finally spotted him holding up some black oxford shoes and shook his head. How could he even afford that? They had to cost like 2 or 3 months’ pay! Nevertheless, the blonde boy went over to him, and the brunette smiled shyly at him.
John slowly blinked his eyes open as the first rays of sunshine began to shine through the curtains. His forehead wrinkled as he looked around in the room, not quite sure of where he was until Sherlock poked his head through the door with his lips curled up into a smile. The brunet crawled onto the bed and scrambled up pushing himself up against John’s still naked body. The blond could feel the smile against his shoulder.
“Lestrade keeps insisting that I get someone else’s opinion on the crime scene,” The brunette started, still looking over at him.
“Ready to go?”
“Did you figure out what had happened?” John asked him and tilted his head curiously. He saw Sherlock looking down at the ground for a second before his azure blue eyes were on him again.
“So how did you catch him?” Lestrade asked as the man was seated in the car and Lestrade looked over at him.
“I don’t have any money, I told you already,” He said, and Sherlock looked down and mumbled something about deleting something. When he looked up again his eyes were wide as he kept holding the scarf in his hands. John leant back against the wall behind him and smiled softly at the brunette.
“You’re impossible,” The blonde sighed, but a fond smile was playing on his lips as he looked over at him. He glanced over at the brunette as he looked out of the window, watching the city as they drove through it. Silence fell, and the driver turned the volume on the radio up a bit before he pulled over at a giant, posh looking building. Sherlock paid the driver before they crawled out and John looked up at the building with wide eyes.
“I’m sure you can find a way to make up for that,” He teased him as he pulled him close again and grinned up at him, knowing that he would never find anyone like Sherlock again, so he’d better hold on tight.
"Oh, you must be John," She said with a wide smile as they entered and John nodded.
"We're standing under the mistletoe," He almost whispered. He glanced over at Sherlock as he let out a small 'oh' and dipped his head and his lips brushed against the blonds quickly. John closed his eyes and reached up to put a hand in his dark curls and pulled him down again to kiss him again.
A chair was pulled out from across Sherlock and he looked up with his brows drawn together in confusion. Why would anyone sit there? He saw John sitting down on the chair at the table with a muffin in one hand and a hot chocolate in the other.
They stayed like that, clinging to each other, pressing their bodies closer. John pushing his knee in between Sherlock’s legs, revealing his growing interest. Sherlock didn’t pull away from him. He wanted this. Badly. When John parted their lips, the brunette let out an unhappy whine. Though it quickly changed to a content hum as the blonde instead moved to press his lips against Sherlock’s long neck. His lips were chapped from being outside too much, Sherlock noticed as he let his head fall back against the wall. He let John do what he wanted as he pressed open-mouthed kisses to the pale skin.
John took a deep breath before he opened the door to move downstairs again. Was this too much? Had he gone to far with dressing up? He shook his head, getting rid of the thoughts before walking over to Sherlock’s bedroom and opened the door.
“Let’s find out,” The brunet answered him, taking on the challenge as he grabbed his hand and tugged at it. John had to take the stairs two steps at a time to keep up with the taller boy and they ran down the hall before Sherlock turned and pulled John into his room.
“John!” Sherlock called as the classroom emptied and people went out in the busy hallways again. The blonde didn’t even flinch as he walked out of the door. He had to follow. When he finally caught up with him he reached out and wrapped his long fingers around his arm.
When he finally succeeded he let out a relieved sigh and he walked inside, and directly over to John’s bed. The pillow smelled like him. Sweet and spicy like the biscuits he liked to eat, there was a hint of tea too. The brunet reached down and clutched the pillow to his chest and breathed in the scent of John. When he closed his eyes, he could almost imagine John there too. He didn’t open his eyes when he heard the door open. Maybe this had been a bad idea?
"Ready?" Sherlock asked him softly and John nodded.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in confusion. John wasn’t gay? Then why had he taken all this so calmly? Why didn’t grinding up against another man repulse him? The stranger’s hands found piece when they suddenly rested on John’s hips, and the brunette couldn’t keep the growl on anymore.
“I didn’t, I didn’t get you anything,” He mumbled quietly and the blond gave him a wry smile.
"Pleasure to meet you, Mrs Holmes," John said and reached his hand out as Mrs Holmes wiped her hands on her apron and then went over and enveloped John in a warm hug.
Soon after Sherlock found himself following the blonde out on the street. The number of people had, thankfully, been reduced. They could actually walk side by side, without bumping into other people. They walked in silence, just listening to the sounds of the cars driving past and the people talking around them. It was awful. Nothing was happening. Everything was so utterly boring!. He snapped out of his thoughts once he felt John’s warm hand around his own, and he was pulled back. He frowned as he looked over at the smaller man, who had now let go of his hand again.
John reached up to press his lips to Sherlock’s again, wanting to taste the lovely sounds Sherlock made. He let his hand travel down over Sherlock’s chest, accidentally running his finger’s over the hard nubs once more and down over the soft skin of his belly before he met the dark hair travelling from his navel and down below the waistline of his trousers. He waited for something to change, Sherlock pulling away perhaps? He didn’t. On the contrary, he pushed back up against him and his breathing become more ragged.
"It's nice to finally meet a friend of Sherlock's, he has talked so much about you," She said and John glanced to Sherlock who had pink cheeks and was looking down at his feet.
“Are you asking for help?” He teased, and Sherlock quickly shook his head.
“Hey, let me take a look at that,” he said, and Sherlock frowned at him. Take a look at what? He moved a hand up to his nose, which was hurting a bit now that he thought about it. When he looked at his hand again, there was blood on it. Great.
They sat like that for some time. Sherlock looking at whatever he was studying, and John sitting on Murray’s bed, waiting for his friend to come back.
At least he could ask Murray if he could stay there. Maybe he could even get him to watch a couple of episodes of Stranger things with him? And they could order a pizza! Maybe staying there wouldn’t be as bad as he had first thought. He stood in front of the door with his bag in one hand as he knocked on the door and he heard Bill telling him that he could come in. John opened the door and stepped inside. As usual, one side of the room was almost empty, besides a bed, some clothes and some sort of weird experiment sat up, and the boy living there wasn’t anywhere to be seen. The other looked like a typical boy’s room. Clothes were tossed over the back of a chair and in the foot of the bed while a ginger boy occupied the rest of the bed.
"What do you mean?"
"Do go on," he urged her with a wave of his hand.
"But-" Before she could react or say anything, he was gone; and had locked the front door on the outside.
"I'm so sorry, John. Forgive me. I didn't know it would cause you so much pain," he whispers. Through the moonlight, I see honesty in his expression, and the sadness of realizing what he's done is clear in those beautiful eyes.
"I can," a male voice replied, and everyone turned around to see Mycroft Holmes walk through the entrance of the hall. A relatively tall man dressed in an expensive grey suit, his dark hair combed to one side and his piercing black eyes set on Oleander. He wasn't thin or particularly muscular but there was an air of authority and power to him. He walked calmly with high confidence until he arrived to stand next to Sherlock; "As the representative of the British government, I asked my brother not to share what this information except with those who are present here at this moment."
"No. I'm going to meet the Venenum. I'll be back in an hour, more or less." He sprang to his feet and moved towards the door but Joan quickly blocked his way.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's the point. You didn't deserve that. And I'm angry with myself and I will always be. I'll never forgive myself for that. Mary's death isn't your fault but it was easier to blame you than to admit that I screwed up my relationship with her as well."
"Don't!" He yelled and reached out to stop her but this sudden movement made him wince in pain and he had to lie down again."Don't do... that," he protested, the words coming out of his mouth in bits and pieces due to the sharp pain and he was breathing in small gasps.
He simply nodded. "Fine but let me do the talking."
"Well; for one, I know you've had a long day so you naturally must be exhausted. And two, you'll find it in your best interest not to defy me."
"But you're not well enough yet; you can't go out alone. "
After she finished her dinner, he looked at his watch. "You better start to get ready. We'll have to leave soon."
She nodded in understanding.
"I don't want you to be here because you feel obligated to look after me or because you feel responsible for my health."
"No, leave him alone! " Another two men tried to get her out of the way, "Get off me!" She tried to shrug them off and push them away.
Sherlock nodded and walked over to examine the body. The victim had been poisoned just like the others. He also had a companion which fit the pattern. Sherlock didn't find out much more about the victim which frustrated him.
"Feeling better?" Sherlock asked, busy with one of his experiments.
"Very good." She replied, memories of war flashing before her eyes.
"Goodbye Mycroft." Sherlock hung up as Joan started to regain her consciousness.
His body was urging him on to drink it, each cell was screaming and itching with the need for the warm liquid in front of him. He could smell it before and it was already difficult for him to keep his composure around her but now? This was a whole different matter. He wndered if he had ever craved a human's blood more and he couldn't recall having such a strong need before.
"It was Afghanistan by the way, if you're really so eager to know."
"The police don't consult amateurs." Suddenly she frowned. "Why would the police even accept help from a civilian?"
"That doesn't matter. I just want to be able to make my own choices, Sherlock!"
"I told you before - because that was the only thing that would make him stop. And I did owe you one after all."
"I instantly had a very strong instinct to protect you. I didn't think twice about rushing over to help you. When you were passed out, I had this feeling that our paths were meant to cross, and Oleander..." he trailed off.
He scoffed and waved her off. "The Scotland yard is full of morons. Fortunately Lestrade isn't one of them. He's at least tolerable and not entirely an idiot. He can understand things if I go a bit slow and he knows that he's in need of my advice far more than I need the distraction of his cases. London would be much more of a dangerous place if Lestrade was as idiotic as the people who work for him."
Once they were back in Baker street, Joan could tell that he was upset; and it wasn't difficult for her to find the cause. She sighed and began to speak in a gentle voice; "I'm sorry, Sherlock.  You told me to let you do the talking and I didn't listen. I was impulsive and reckless and I shouldn't have jumped in-"
"Yes. THE knife. Obviously your security is corrupt," he emphasised as if he's talking to a 3 years old.
'Conditions of the contract between Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson:
"No, Sherlock. I'm serious. I already screwed up so much between us. And I know I can't fix what's already happened but I'm gonna try anyway."
"Hold on a second, I don't understand. Why do you have crime scene photos in the first place?"
"I trust you on this, Mr. Holmes. If anyone can bring justice to Benjamin's case, it's you."
"Oh for God's sake, John. Spill it out. You've been hiding something all day."
"What kind of a fool do you take me for?! I saw the bruises on your body, bite marks, things like that."
"I didn't know vampires sleep too," she was naturally curious so this question didn't shock Sherlock.
"Just let... me... get up..." It took all of his energy and doubled up the pain, but he eventually managed to stand upright. At this point, she couldn't really stop him, no matter how hard she tried to do so. Even wounded, he was (physically) much stronger than her.
"What? What's going on?"
"Why...? Because they were going to hurt you."
"Yes?"
"I know..." She had already disobeyed him once and had suffered for it. She wasn't very keen on repeating such a thing.
"What is?" He asked, finally turning away from the living room window to look at her.
"Are you going alone?" she asked with something akin to concern in her voice.
After she finished reading, she looked up at him. "I Just want to add one more thing. Is that ok?"
"About your... situation."
He took some time to consider it; "I won't lie to you. Lies break trust and I want you to trust me so I'll always be honest with you. You just simply can't leave this flat for now. You'll just have to accept this fact as it is."
with your life exactly anyway?"
They both laughed and shrugged. "Can't be helped."
"He IS the british government when he's not too busy being the British Secret Services or the CIA on a freelance basis."
Joan put her hand on Sophia's shoulder. "I don't think that's a good idea. Sherlock can handle it by himself."
It's awkward between Sherlock and Joan for the next couple of days. Sherlock thinks he never should have fed on her blood, though he knows it's an absurd regret because she was absolutely right about everything that she'd said to him and he'd stopped in the perfect instant and therefore she's perfectly fine.
“I can’t trust you unless you allow me to do my job which is helping people and saving lives. I could be useful to the case, more so than if I was locked up in here. And I can’t trust anyone who would prioritise locking me up like some common criminal over helping others. So now the real question is, do you really want me to trust you?"
"He's practically Moriarty's toy. He has Sebastian completely under his control. They are also a couple; always have been."
Joan sighed softly and their eyes locked once more. "You." Sherlock frowned in confusion. "The first night I was in this flat; you told me lies break trust so you wouldn't lie to me because you wanted me to trust you."
"If you're looking for your handbag, I'm not returning it anytime soon," he warned. He had already thought this through, she didn't have a way out. Joan froze and tears stung her eyes at the hopelessness of her situation.
Sherlock asked a few more minor questions from Sophia but Joan was too distracted to notice. It was sort of a shock to her to see a companion talk so kindly and sweetly about a vampire, to see that Sophia missed Benjamin and even mourned his death.
"Yes. And?"
"Oh John, you're such a romantic. "
"Stop this! Stop it at once!" His voice suddenly had turned so harsh that it sent chills all over her. He yanked the shard away from her hand with an immeasurable force and as he did so, a sharp pain shot through her body which made her wince; and when she looked down at it;
"Doctor Watson?" Sherlock asked again, this time a bit irritated.
"I didn't think talking about a vampire triple homicide in a police station would be appropriate."
"The fact that we're even talking about this... that you're seriously considering this is ridiculous."
He confirmed this with a nod but wasn't sure where she was going with it.
"Sherlock Holmes isn't allowed to have any other companion or to lend his to other vampires under any conditions."
"So you think it's a vampire/companion?" Sophie asked, looking between Sherlock and Joan again.
"Ah. Of course. I see it now. The solider. Always protecting others."
"You've examined the bodies yourself?"
"I never said you did."
"We can't make him drink it. His body will go into shock if we give him a lot of blood at once. So we'll have to set him up with an IV to slow it down," he said, and picked up one of Sherlock's blood bags from the counter.
"I won't," he promises,"it's alright. I'm here, I'm home."
Terror filled her heart as she looked up from her now bleeding palm to Sherlock, knowing exactly what the blood was doing to him and also that she had absolutely no chance of surviving through this situation now. Any tiny piece of hope she had of getting out of his flat alive disappeared. The smell of blood filled the air between them and they both froze for a moment, her eyes were fixed on him, and his on her bleeding hand.
"I think you should leave my property,
It's ironic that I lose him where I'd first found him.
It's Sherlock's birthday two days later. Molly insists that they all have cake. Sherlock protests at first but he's smiling once he finds eveyone he loves around him.
"I want to give you my first present of the day."
"Hi. I'm sorry, you probably don't know who I am but-"
"That's Benjamin's address and those photos are from his house."
It was a typical early April evening in London; dark, cloudy and of course a bit chilly. Doctor Joan Watson walked out of the hospital that she works in. She had sandy hair, slightly tanned skin, a height of 170 centimetres with bright blue eyes. She was wearing a black top with black trousers and brown rust boots with a matching coat.
All the vampires vacated the bar almost immediately in the fear that whether their companions or themselves would be the next target. After informing his brother about the matter (who would ensure that no human, not even the police or the press, would be involved with this incident), Sherlock started to analyse the murders on the way back to Baker street.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What for? There are hospital’s full of people dying, Doctor. Why don’t you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them?"
"Ok?"
"The population of vampires is pretty small. Quite a few will be in that bar so I rely on the balance of probability here. A human couldn't have killed a vampire, let alone two. I think the murderer likes to make a scene. That's the frailty of genius, Joan-  it needs an audience."
"She is almost three years old now but I won't ever let you see her. She'll always have my last name and she'll never know you. She'll always know Benjamin as her father because he was a better father to her than you can ever be." She was angry and at the edge of tears. Jackson looked completely shattered but Sherlock forced himself to remain silent. "You could have just talked to me, you could avoid all this. You could have called, you could even just bloody answer the phone or open the door when I tried to reach out to you. But above all, you should have been there for your daughter. I would have allowed you; I'd really want that actually but after what you did, I don't want you either around myself or around my daughter. You got the one single person in my life and in hers who had shown either of us any kindness killed just because of your arrogance. I knew Benjamin long before I met you, he was like family to me but I don't see the man I used to love in front of me anymore. I don't trust you now, I can't. You are a murderer, how can you be expected to be a good father?"
He pretended to be looking somewhere else but answered her in a low voice; "Sebastian Moran."
"Of course it was. It was quite extraordinary."
Oleander tilted his head to one side as a sign of disappointment for being underestimated. "Sherlock, you are unique in your mental powers, beyond the shadow of a doubt but we're not blind, nor stupid," he looked at his friends who silently agreed.
His hands take mine. "I'm rude, obnoxious and arrogant," I chuckle and he smiles, "but do you really think I destroy criminal webs for just anyone?"
"Older than you can imagine."
"I assume you already know who I am?" He asked.
He was overwhelmed, he didn't know what to do and having a mind like his certainly didn't help it. Joan was right and he knew it but still, something felt wrong about this whole thing. Tasting her blood was one of the most pleasing experiences in his entire life and there was no denying that but it was also one of the most terrifying ones. He had stopped this time but would he manage it if he feed on her again? Frankly, he wasn't unfamiliar with the picture, the vampire would crave blood more and more, their thirst never truly satisfied and the human would soon turn into a lifeless corpse. It would be the easiest thing in the world for a vampire to get lost in their thirst for blood, carried away by their constant desire for more blood...
"I'm fine, Joan," He replied reassuringly but she shot him a sceptical look, "really, I'm ok."
"Hmm..." he confirmed.
"Nice to meet you as well. " Lestrade said but as he sat down next to Sherlock, he asked him;" Who is this?"
"Yeah, that's one word for it, I suppose."
"I'll be... fine. I simply... need some… time… and rest,"  he muttered as he tried to get himself into a sitting position between groans and gasps.
"And you thought leaving me to grieve was the better choice?"
"Nothing solid yet but I feel like I'm very close to it," she merely nodded. He was silent for a second before he continued, "You told her that you're my companion."
"But Sophia and Emily need somewhere safe to stay." Joan sighed and affectionately stroked the baby's head who was still asleep in her arms. Sherlock could clearly see that she felt bad for the little girl.
"What happened?"
Sebastian looked up as Sherlock stepped into the sight. He certainly wasn't expecting to be caught at that moment but it was as if he had seen it coming eventually. Two of Venenum's people grabbed him and restrained him.
Her heart raced and the sense of terror quickly filled her entire being. She ran towards the door on fight or flight instinct but found it to be locked.
The whole conversation replayed in Joan's mind over and over like a song that's been put on repeat but it made no sense. Did Sherlock really care about her safety? If so, why? Why didn't he trust Venenum? Who was this ‘Mycroft’ that he trusted so much? Joan decided not to mention anything about it to Sherlock. She just simply didn't know how to ask the questions she had in mind without sounding awkward or inappropriate.
She nodded, "I would have alredy lost my mind by now if it wasn't for Emily."
"Because the answer is yes?"
"She?" It was Sherlock's turn to be surprised.
"I just told you."
He sighed and rolled his eyes in annoyance. "And what were you doing
"Joan is struggling. She's resilient, a free spirit. But I think she'll come around to understand it all eventually. Actually she's an additional reason that I wanted to see you."
'Scientific, artistic and antique; just like himself,' she thought.
"He was ok with it. He told me to fill blood bags for him in certain intervals after I found out I was pregnant so that me and the baby would be safe. We both had to be very careful but he always looked out for me," Sophia explained.
"What do you mean?"
He has tears coming down his face now. It feels bitter but good. He is finally letting it all out. Sherlock may never want to see him again but he doesn't care anymore. They've shared something beautiful over the years and it means too much to him. He can't continue like this. He won't look at Sherlock and hide everything anymore.
"Having fun."
He seemed to be weighing his options for a moment. "Look, tomorrow night, there'll be a party at a bar. It's famous amongst my kind as it's one of the very rare places that vampires are free and allowed to show who they truly are. I think the next target will be someone from the guests."
"Sebastian Moran killed Benjamin and threatened Sophia's life. I saw your texts. You gave him Benjamin's address," Sherlock said with an accusing tone.
"Your time abroad as an army doctor - where were you: Afghanistan or Iraq?"
"Better but not 100% yet."
"Nice mind game, I'll give you that. Good strategy."
"Out of place?" He looked at her as he finished her sentence for her.
'Instinct'... the word echoed in her mind.  Joan had to take a second to think about it before she could continue their conversation. "You told me when a vampire meets their companion, they just instinctively know that it's the right person; yes?"
The door wasn’t locked. John opened the door, and the first thing his eyes fell to was those long, slender legs lying across the floor. John pushed the door further open to reveal the pale boy who was leaning against the wall, his legs spread and his head tilted back in a euphoric expression. It wasn’t until a few seconds later his eyes fell to the mess on the floor, the little bottle with a clear liquid inside and a small dark green box. His eyes wandered to Sherlock and ended on his arm where he had bound a white elastic around, and a syringe pressed into a vein. John wanted to close the door and forget what he saw. He didn’t want to remember the sight of the brunette with a syringe in his arm.
“Well, we were going Christmas shopping, weren’t we?” The brunette asked, and John kept looking back and forth between the building and Sherlock.
“Yes,” John answered quietly, almost shyly, neither of them broke the eye contact. Sherlock noticed his tongue darting out to wet his lips and swallowed. His eyes flickered to John’s again, he was still looking at his lips.
He grabbed his Belstaff (not because he was cold but simply because he didn't wish to draw even more attention to himself by not wearing enough warm clothes on a cold day like this one) and walked out of 221B, ignoring the first droplets of a very heavy rain falling down from the London sky.
She could see the question in his eyes and shook her head. "I'm fine. It only stings a little, I promise."
"Find the cause of death, I suppose." She shrugged, unsure.
"Don't call… an ambulance."
He nodded, "Any good?"
"Yes."
He nodded in confirmation. "It's like an engine, racing out of control, tearing itself to pieces. I can't switch it off and on but I can direct my focus onto something else, put it into a different path."
"And what might your job be?"
How will Joan & Sherlock face these murders? Will Sherlock be able to solve this mystery? Will they need help?
"Why do you think companions are considered as properties, Sherlock? On our side, there's the power of owning and on theirs, the security and comfort of being owned, being protected. It's not a shock that you want to protect what's yours; at least 'yours' in a sense."
"Do you really think so?" He asked, doubtful.
Speak of the devil... There he was, standing in front of the large living room window with a violin in his left hand and a bow in his right, his fingers easily danced on the neck of the instrument. Despite the endearing action of playing a violin, there was something bitter about him. He was like an unbreakable statue made out of stone, an iceberg: cold, sharp and bound to destroy anything in his path. She could see that coldness even in the depths of his eyes. They were frozen... dead even, without even a trace of emotion in them to be seen.
Joan was frozen with shock and glued to the spot as he disappeared into the dark night. Something invisible held her there, preventing her from doing what her mind and medical instincts screamed at her to do. When he was completely out of her sight a moment later, Joan started to doubt her own sanity.
"You ok? I think you were having a nightmare."
"I didn't mean to-"
She was truly amazed and enchanted. Once she'd followed his train of reasoning, it had all become crystal clear. She could see the flame of wisdom burning behind his eyes now and wondered what it's like to see the world through a keen mind like his, "That was brilliant."
"But how?" A male voice replied but she didn't know this man.
"Always am."
That must have been the weirdest sight she'd ever seen in her entire life! The club was crowded, some were dancing to the music, some others were talking to each other while drinking… And some of the vampires were feeding on... humans!
"You haven't gone to bed yet.” The words were out of Sherlock's mouth before he could stop them.
They met Sophia in the old building which Venenum owned. Sophia was pale and scared and her hands which were holding a small child shook visibly.
He looked away from her."I had no choice. We'd discussed this, Joan. If I set you free, both of us will die. Why can't you see that I had to do it, not only for myself but for you as well?"
“Any sign of struggle? Forced entry?"
"Don't you doubt him even once?"
"Nice to meet you."
"We've been informed that you've been attacked a few days ago."
"You told my attacker that I'm your companion to scare him off. You'd revealed your secret to save me and you kidnapped me so that I wouldn't get either of us killed because of what I'd seen. Then you told Venenum I'm your companion. None of that adds up to what you just said."
"There's really no way that you will set me free, is there?" She asked hopefully (and desperately) but she knew the answer to that question already.
"The truth. Why did you kill three vampires and chased down a companion?"
"Is he really your brother?"
"You still working on the case then?"
*'Sophia, If you're reading this, it means that you're seeking out my secret which in turn means that I'm dead. So you should know that I've left you all my belongings in my will. You may ask why. To be honest with you, I'm scared; I'm scared of what might happen to you and Emily. Please be very careful. I'm writing this to let you know something very important. There's a poison for vamps like me, a dangerous one. Julia and David are working on an antidote. They've asked me for help. Not everyone wants the antidote to be found, though. And some of these people are very dangerous. And if you're reading this, it means they've got me. Run away, start afresh. Make yourself a new life with Emily somewhere far away from London. You're both very dear to me and always will be. Benjamin '*
"Boredom?"
"It's not possible for you to leave so you really should stop asking that." It was true, in a way, but Sherlock knew that deep down, he didn't even want her to leave. There was something different and unique about her that drew him to her and yet he couldn't begin to comprehend what it was.
"Why should I ever listen to you? You're a creepy stranger who's kidnapped me. I don't even know your name!"
Remembering how nasty his wound had been, she couldn't help her next question. "How did you survive that horrible wound anyway? More importantly, how did he even manage to hurt you if you're a vampire? I don't think vampires can get hurt by the things that injure humans."
"Emoticons blunt my mental abilities. I've chosen to use my intellect to save lives instead of mourning for those that are already lost or worry for those that are in danger."
Sherlock's hands raised to cover his mouth in an automatic reflex, (most likely to silence his own cries) but that was when his fingertips became red with more blood on his lips...
"Yes, but that's only one of their many reasons for keeping human companions."
As Joan was busy trying to stop the bleeding, she suddenly noticed that the man had stopped squirming and didn't groan anymore like he did a few short moments ago; his hands didn't move anymore either. When she looked up at him, his eyelids were shut.
"You've set emergency contacts on your phone. For a vampire, I just found it a bit odd; unless, well… if you were expecting something really bad to happen to you and felt under threat."
"What do you mean?"
"Alright, I'm ready," she said and he turned around to look at her. This time, there was something different in his gaze, something that she couldn't quite put her finger on. His eyes had changed colour; now they reminded Joan of sunset at a seaside; calm, deep and inviting. For the first time, she didn't find any fear in herself when she looked at him.
"If you've heard me and Mycroft talking, then you know that there's a good chance I might not be able to control myself if I feed on you."
"Not if I'm careful enough about it, no. Plus, I also take clients and a few private detectives come to me for help as well. Gregson, Lestrade, Jones, Dimmock, Hopkins; they all seek my help, although I don't think Donovan and Anderson like the fact that their boss works with me. I solve whatever mystery that dazzles them."
"For a genius, you're really dumb sometimes, you know that?" Sherlock just blinks at him so John sighs and continues, "I'm not here because I feel like I have to. I'm here because I want to, because I care about you."
"Well, can I help with anything?"
"That'll be for the best," Sherlock agreed.
"Things aren't so... simple with Sherlock and I. There is too much history between us, old scores… resentment. He sees me as an enemy."
"Sophia thinks she's seen the murderer. She's been on the run but she thinks that he's been following her," he said as he picked up his jacket.
Having no alternative, she reluctantly followed him to the upper floor which consisted of a small bathroom and a single bedroom, furnished with a few pieces of furniture: a bed next to a large window, a wooden closet and a matching nightstand. It was obvious that this room hadn't been used frequently or even recently.
"I simply want to give you a word of warning. What you've just done - I'm afraid it might not end very well."
"But just like you said; I don't know anything about this," Sophia said, visibly surprised.
"What?! Why?"
"You're not like that. Benjamin wasn't like that. A lot of vampires at the bar we went to weren't like that," she said firmly, shaking her head in disagreement.
Sherlock texted Sophia and asked her to meet him in half an hour. After she texted back that she would, he dialled Joan's number.
He nodded approvingly. "Go on," he pointed to the photos and she picked them up.
"Dead? They are. I'll leave you to your deductions about Mycroft though."
"John... must you do this? You have a daughter who needs you. I think I'm fine enough now to be left unsupervised."
However, destiny had different plans for her.
"Maybe. But I intended to save your life by keeping Moriarty away from you. Not to endanger it even more by dragging you into a fight against him."
"And why not?"
"I wanted to. But no deducing the presents. That's just mean, Sherlock."
"There's only one explanation. Benjamin had something that Sebastian wants but he wasn't sure that Benjamin still had it in his possession until after the first murder. He might have thought that Benjamin had handed it over to someone else. Then Benjamin left everything to Sophia so he wanted her to have whatever it was, he felt threatened but he didn't know where it would lead so he didn't tell her anything. Then he left everything, rather than just that one specific thing to her so that she could figure it out but only if there was a need. Sebastian went to the house to take what he wanted before Sophia could figure things out but he was caught red-handed."
She slowly re-opened her eyes at his words but didn't yet dare to look up at him. "Then what is it that you want from me? Why don't you let me go?"
"What I did... back in the hospital. Sherlock, you didn't deserve any of it. I was just so angry and I took it all on you because I'm an idiot and anything was easier than accepting what really happened. I don't deserve your forgiveness or even being here after what I did. But as long as you let me, I'm gonna try and make it up to you."
help? What could he do for them?"
"Well, one present didn't really feel enough."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why should I answer that? You wouldn't understand it anyhow."
"I won't say anything to anyone. No one will know your secret," she pleaded.
"Is that so?" She crossed her arms.
"I'm a vampire and I also work with the police. I think it'd be in your best interest if you tell us the truth," Sherlock stepped closer.
"But he said he's a representative of the British government."
For the next half an hour, Joan ate her breakfast silently in the kitchen as Sherlock went over every clue he had about the case. He wanted to drown himself in work so that his mind wouldn't have the space to think about the nightmare. By the time she'd finished her breakfast and came back to the living room, the coffee table was filled with pictures and pieces of paper about the case.
"Yes. Who are you?" The man frowned.
Vampires don't interfere with one another's feedings; it's one of their very strict rules, but this was very different. Putting aside the personal reason that Sherlock's thoughts had been about little else except for that specific young woman in the past forty-eight hours, that vicious vampire was about to feed on a human in PUBLIC . The rules ban vampires from feeding out in the open. It's too risky and can expose the
"Take me with you," she suggested and he looked at her with widened eyes.
"John?! What are you doing home? I could have shot you. You were up all night on shift anyways. Did you even sleep at all?"
"A contract. Isn't that how everyone does deals? It'll help clear things about how this will work."
"It's not my story to tell. It wouldn't be right. I think you should ask him yourself when he wakes up if you really want to find out," he looked at his brother's sleeping form, "Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars. But when you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield. You’ve seen it already, haven’t you?"
"Do you really think I'm gonna tell you anything about that? Come on, you must be smarter than this if your reputation is anything to go by," he smirked.
"Then I'll continue not to make that mistake."
"What do you think you're doing?"
Sherlock's lips turned into a thin line but he nodded and reached for a pen and paper. "Alright but remember that if you try to trick me, you'll face consequences."
Sherlock nodded. "Unfortunately. "
Next year, we get married with a small ceremony. Neither of us cares for big celebrations anyway. I've managed to have a small snowflake engraved into the inside of Sherlock's ring a week before. When I'm about to slip it onto his finger, he notices it and looks at me but waits until the quests are gone to ask me about it.
He's in my nightmare again that night. I wake up in tears to my own screaming but this time, he's by my bed, looking concerned.
"Do you really think you have a choice right now?"
He was deep in thought for a moment."There's no other way. I'll have to risk it and get into the party," he said as he analysed the situation at hand over and over inside his head.
She was suddenly reminded of the bullet holes on the living room's wallpaper." Ah! I see. Of course. I should have known. Your brain is self destructive when there's nothing for it to work on."
“Oh! You scared me.” She was startled and inhaled deeply. When he didn’t move or reply, she frowned. “Hey… are you alright?”
He finds Sherlock looking at him and he's holding John's hand a minute later. He squeezes Sherlock's hand and smiles back when Rosie pulls on his trousers.
"Oh, I'm afraid I can't."
Could vampires have babies?
It begins to snow outside the living room window when his lips touch mine for the first time.
"Well, if it isn't Sherlock Holmes himself," one of the members greeted him whom he knew as Oleander, a tall black haired man with deep black eyes who was neatly dressed in a tailored suit. He seemed 30 to 35 years old but Sherlock knew that he was in fact much older.
"I sure hope so, Mr Holmes," She said and got up. "I'll have to leave now, I'm afraid but please contact me if you have more questions or if you had any news for me."
"I know and I'm so happy. I never thought I'd smile again after I lost you."
It's a miracle, my head spins just trying to wrap itself around the fact that Sherlock Holmes (of all people) is in love with me.
"Oh good. You're awake." John said smiling as he continued to set the kitchen table.
"Why do you ask that?"
"I know. But we need every bit of information we can get."
"Look, as you said you'll be honest with me, I will be honest with you in return. What you're doing to me is worse than death. You took everything I had: my ability to make choices, my job, my life-"
"Hey, it's ok. Calm down," Joan said softly, trying to reassure her. She wasn't sure if Sophia had the strength to hold the child anymore so she gently took the sleeping baby into her own arms.
"I'm gonna tell you one thing. Moriarty will find out that you've imprisoned his companion and he won't react well to that news. You will pay for this very soon and you'll pay in blood. And when that happens, you're gonna wish that you'd never found me," Sebastian stared at him with a threatening and daring gaze.
This answer confused her even more. How could a vampire consider solving crime as 'having fun'? "Why are you taking cold cases, Sherlock? Shouldn't you be working on the vampire homicides case?"
Where did Sherlock go? Who texted him? And what will Joan do while he's away? This is gonna be a wild chapter!
He chuckled. "Then correct me, doctor."
"You vampires can all piss off. That bastard already took Sophia from me. I'm done with all of you."
"Not as much as humans. We don't really need sleep like humans do. It just serves as a restart button for us to be honest."
"Because I told your attacker that you're my companion."
"Good. I'm glad to hear that you have the situation at least partly under control." Oleander paused for a second, measuring his next words. "And the attacker?"
"You are. You know, we're actually more
She allowed a moment to pass in silence before she spoke again. "Well that's certainly a first."
She looked towards the man and then suddenly everything that had happened earlier came back to her; how she'd been attacked, how this man had come to her aid and what she'd seen afterwards... She jolted up and started to back away from him. "I saw your eyes... They were red and you had... fangs! I saw it while you were fighting with the guy who attacked me. You're not human. I know that. And neither was he. So what are you?!" She backed away further, still keeping her guard up.
