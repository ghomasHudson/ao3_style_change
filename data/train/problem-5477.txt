“Oh, I’m sorry baby,” Steve apologized after he heard Tony whining, clearly annoyed because he had stopped reading. “… his heart sank faster than he'd just dived…” he continued.
“Today,” Steve had told Tony when he kissed him goodbye before leaving for SHIELD’s headquarters. Tony still didn’t understand why Steve insisted on updating Clint’s mission reports, nor how Clint had managed to fall
“Yes?” Phil answered, looking up at the roof as he raised an eyebrow in confusion. JARVIS hardly ever spoke to him.
Twenty-five spanks. That was it. He was never delivered with more than twenty-five. And that was more than enough, Steve might not spank him with all his strength, but he didn’t go light on him either. By the time it finished, tears were falling freely on his face and he was breathing heavily. The captain helped him to stand, pulling his pants up right away and placing him between his legs to prevent him from trying to get away.
“What is it, Tony? Has the cat got your tongue?” Steve teased, and that childish questions made Tony wonder if he really didn’t know what he was going to say.
“What? ...Oh,” Steve expressed, even though that information wasn’t surprising at all – quite the opposite, actually. A sight escaped from his lips as he let go of Tony’s ankle to press his thumb and middle finger into his temples, attempting to fight off the headache that threatened to start and he somehow knew it had nothing to do with his injured state.
No more feeding, no more bathing, no more reading a story to bed, nothing that could be considered childish in the slightest. Nothing that could give an indication that Steve was still trying to get him into age playing. Not even the topic had been brought up. Steve had respected Tony’s decision of not wanting to give it a try, and Tony was more than fine with that.
Steve had apologized thousands of times, he had pampered his baby as much as possible, and he had been all over his boyfriend doing everything he could to make up to him for what had happened, everything that was necessary to lighten the burden of guilt off his shoulders. For the next couple of weeks, there wasn’t anyone else other than Tony for Steve.
“I-I… I wa-want… want da-daddy,” Clint stuttered out, pulling the front of his t-shirt as much as he could, trying to cover his diaper.
“As tempting as that idea sounds,” Steve managed to say during the lapses Tony let his mouth free, “the only thing you’re going to do tonight is to eat, to take a shower and to sleep,” he informed.
The worst thing you can do to your friends is telling them your secrets, because that automatically involves them even if any of the parties wants to. Steve remembered reading or hearing that somewhere, and he felt that phrase described best what had happened. Without the bad connotation, of course.
There it was, without beating around the bush. If Tony wasn’t really paying attention to him, he was now. Steve had considered cushioning the blow, but he thought nothing good would come out of doing that. Sometimes it was better to catch Tony off guard, otherwise, he would have enough time to come up with something that could get him out of the uncomfortable situation he was in. He was very good at that.
But there was nothing Steve could do except waiting patiently, otherwise Tony would never come around.
“Well, you could tell him about it yourself this time, and explain him why you want you guys to give it a try,” Phil suggested.
Little or big, Steve was trying to make Tony get use to ingest something nutritious before eating junk food. Tony wasn’t very fond of the idea, though he hadn’t really refused to it either. As long as the quantity of healthy food wasn’t more than the junk food, there were no complains. Clint, on the other hand, would have definitely protested if Steve had told him he had to eat some salad before the pizza. That was why Steve had refrained himself from even proposing the idea, he didn’t want to give Clint more reasons to want to leave.
“Hey, hey, hey, what do you think you’re doing?” Steve asked Tony when he was halfway through sitting at the table.
All of a sudden, Tony stood up fast and made a beeline to his desk, vanishing any idea Steve might have had of him willing leave the workshop. He tried to pick up whatever he had been working on before dozing off, just an excuse to turn his back on him, he really didn’t want to face him right now.
Sorry for taking too much time to update. I've been having too much work, and a couple of days ago was my brithday and some friends insisted on going out to celebrate, which I appreciate, but socializing does drain my energy. Right now I'm supposed to be getting ready to go and have lunch with some friends who just gratuated, but I really don't feel like going out, so I sat down in front of my computer and finish this chapter.
“Steve?”  Tony repeated as he sat up and yawned behind his hand. Perhaps Steve had gone to the bathroom. Tony went as quiet as possible so he could hear any sound coming from the bathroom, unconsciously hugging his teddy bear to his chest when the silence told him there was nobody else in the room but him.
“All done,” Steve announced, patting Tony’s left thigh a couple of times as he leaned further over to kiss his tummy before helping him to sit up. “I bet you feel more comfortable now, don’t you baby boy?”
“It doesn’t. And even if it did, it tastes good. When have I given you something that had a bad taste?”
Steve would have liked to stand up immediately and get them both ready to bed, but when he tried to move, Tony groaned. So, he just stayed there for a little while, enjoying the moment, cooing him and rubbing his back waiting for him to stop calm down. Steve was sure Tony would throw another tantrum when he saw the diaper and bottle he would pull out from the drawers, but this would be more like a fuss than a tantrum, much easier to deal with. And it would totally be worthy when he placed him on his lap one more time and Tony fell asleep after being feed with some warm milk.
Tony had been in shock and in complete unease that night. If that hadn’t worked, now the only thing left to do – besides quitting this role-play he had trouble believing he liked that much – was to do what Steve had requested from the beginning.
Carefully and tenderly, Steve settled Tony on the bed and proceeded to diaper him and put him in a set of footie pajamas. Although it hadn’t taken a lot of time, by the time he was done, Tony was already dozing off again. With no effort, Steve lifted him and placed him on his lap, wrapping an arm protectively around his shoulder and another around his waist, rubbing his tummy affectionately. Tony fell asleep almost immediately, listening to his caregiver’s heartbeat.
“Coming to bed two days in a row? Something very bad must’ve happened,” Steve pointed out when Tony entered their room. “You either burned your brain due to overuse and an unhealthy lifestyle, or you burned down your workshop during one of your experiments. And because you forbade Dummy using any extinguishers, he couldn’t put out the fire and now you have no place to hide,” Steve speculated.
“It’s okay, baby, daddy’s only going to change your diaper,” Steve soothed. Tony had gotten a little startled when Steve lifted him enough to slip a changing pad under his bottom. Apparently, he had wasted no time and had gone back to sleep while Steve gathered all the supplies needed.
The more Steve thought about it, the more it seemed that was the reason and the more enthusiastic he became. Even so, he didn't dare to do anything about it. No matter how much he wished to reach for Tony and sat him on his lap to ask him and clear his doubts, he didn't. What if everything was a product of his imagination? What if his desire for babying Tony was making him see things that weren't really there? Tony would undoubtedly get livid if that was the case and he brought the topic up, and Steve was afraid another fight would have more serious consequences after what had happened.
I promise there will be some actual age play in the next chapter n_n''''. Sorry if it's going a bit slow, but I don't want to rush things, if I do, I think it wouldn't be believable.
I leave?” Steve asked, his voice still expressing how bewildered he was, and the fact that Tony just nodded didn’t help at all. “Okay Tony, I do need some clarification, because you totally lost me here,” he said as he pushed the baby slightly away from him so he could look at him. Tony resisted a little, and he whined when he saw he no longer could hide his face against Steve’s chest. “No, sweety, I need to know why you said
Well, I know what Tony was doing wasn't really correct, but he's a human being after all and he can err too.
“Well, he was feeling littler than normal, so I didn’t want him to have an accident and pull-ups can’t hold as much as diapers do.” Phil answered, although his explanation only managed to baffled Steve more.
“You… you were taking too l-long,” Clint pointed out, sounding insecure. He sure knew no excuses were valid to Phil.
Little? What did Steve mean by ‘little’? Unlike Clint, Tony had never felt ‘little’, he didn't know how to. It was true he felt sort of small when he was around Steve, but who wouldn't? Steve was a tall broad man after all, Tony had gotten that feeling even before all the age play thing started. Nonetheless, feeling small and ‘little’ were two totally different things, at least in this context.
“Yes you are!” Steve said, as he hurried to grab him by the arm before Tony could lock himself in the bathroom. It was obvious that doors wouldn’t stop him from retrieving Tony, but destroying things unnecessarily wasn’t something he liked to do.
So now, Tony couldn’t help wondering to what extent Steve was involved in the whole thing. Did Steve found out by accident? Did he interact with Clint when he was age playing or was it something just between Clint and Phil? Did he look after Clint? Did he play with him? Did he read Clint to sleep? There were some many things Tony liked to know, and he hated that, because that meant he hadn’t really gotten rid of the idea of giving it a try like he was supposed to. There still was a part of him that was curious about it, and his curiosity grew bigger every time Steve went to look for Clint.
“Yes! You know you’re not allowed to climb into the vents when you’re little!” Phil pointed out as he put his hands on his hips.
“Why did you decide that?” Steve insisted as he rested his chin on his baby’s head. Tony’s fingers curled into the fabric of his t-shirt.
Why had Tony automatically referred to Steve as daddy? He only used that word when they were age playing and after Steve’s constant encouragement. They weren’t having a play date in his moment, they hadn’t in a few days, so there was no reason for Tony to have made use of that word. He didn't even know if Steve was home! He could pay attention to what JARVIS was reciting in the background and find out where Steve was – since the A.I. usually told him his whereabouts as well as everyone else’s so help him to ease his mind after waking up from a bad dream – but how would that help? Besides, Tony hadn’t been able to get hold of himself yet, and distinguishing the words JARVIS was saying was proving to be rather difficult.
“Why are you still mad at me?” Steve asked, and when he got a shrug for an answer, he didn’t hesitate to land his hand again on his partner’s butt, who yelped. “I told you I want verbal answers.”
"Tony, if you don't want me to look after him, you can tell me, I won't get mad or anything," Steve promised, trying to sound as sincere as possible. “Would you mind if I look after Clint?” Tony squirmed, but he didn't attempt to move away. “So?”
Tony did. It would definitely take much more to finish Steve off for good. Getting smashed the way he had been was probably the equivalent of a normal person breaking a leg or an arm: serious but nothing to panic about. If Tony was pacing a hole in the floor, worried and full of guilt, it wasn’t only because Steve had gotten hurt, but also because it had been his fault.
What?? Two chapters in just one week??? That's a miracle XD. Though it's not really long, maybe that was why I could finish it.
“You haven’t washed your hands,” Steve scolded. Tony rolled his eyes. “C’mon, you’re not eating if you don’t wash them.”
“Oh, c’mon, don’t look so surprised, we both know that’s what you want,” Phil assured, bending his head a little and looking up at him.
Dragging his feet, Tony walked towards the sink and turned the faucet on. What was the big deal about not washing his hands before eating? What was the worst that could happen? Getting a stomachache? How was he supposed to produce antibodies if he didn’t give his body the chance to have some germs once in a while?
, before it burst. Tony could stand up, maybe if he was in the position he always was whenever he peed, he could fool his brain. It made a lot of sense, Tony never went while being laid down nor seated – those few times he actually did didn’t count, he had been too drunk to stay on his feet – so that might actually help.
“You ever lie to me like that or try to manipulate me the way you did, and we’re done,” Tony threatened, the expression on his face showing how serious that promise was.
“Yay!” Clint exclaimed, making Steve smile. It was still astounding how Clint could change his mood at the drop of a hat when he was little.
Steve had apologized thousands of times, and he had meant every single apology. He got it, he knew it had been his fault, he knew he should have never lied to Tony that way, he knew the way of proceeding he had chosen hadn’t be the best one, and he understood perfectly well why Tony had gotten angry. Tony had accepted his apology, though it had been obvious he was going to need more time to eliminate all trace of the feelings of resentment he was experiencing towards him. In spite of himself, Steve had given him more space, all his whole being aching with longing for Tony whenever he saw him leaving a room Steve had just walked into, paring with someone else during a battle or failing to show in their room yet one more night.
Flopping down on the bed, Tony unblocked the tablet and started looking for the thing that had him searching for the gadget for more than thirty minutes – yes, he knew he should have asked JARVIS for its whereabouts way before – some sketches of an idea he had had in the middle of the night who knew when and he had forgotten to save. Good thing Steve never closed any apps Tony had left opened.
Without any warning, Tony felt how Steve slid his hands under his armpits and lifted him, and before he could register what was happening to do something about it, Steve had put him inside a box and close it. And Tony was the one who played dirty!
“Would you go back to the bed so we can get done with this? I’m getting kind of hungry,” And frustrated, but Steve didn’t say that out loud.
“Jeez, I don’t think he’ll be mad because you found out, but I think he would’ve preferred to tell you himself in that case. So, perhaps you might want to say nothing about it?” Phil proposed.
“More,” Tony insisted, the frown on his face indicating he wasn’t going to take a ‘no’ for an answer. Steve sighed while he shook his head in disapproval, but stood up and went to the kitchen anyway.
going to have a good night’s sleep this time, and he was going to show his brain that way that all this was pure nonsense.
“Oh, so you know the difference. Now, tell me why you seem to need them, ‘cause this is exactly what I need now, a son who can’t even control his bladder!” he said, as he threw the package against the wall.
“Of course you are, sweetpea, you spent all afternoon making and cleaning up a mess,” Steve chuckled, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Actually, the reason why I went down to your workshop was to ask you if you wanted to go out and grab some lunch. I guess it’ll have to be dinner now,” he acknowledged, tightening his embrace after Tony snuggled closer to him. He shouldn’t be sitting down on Steve’s lap, he only did that when they were age playing, and they weren’t, not really. But if Steve didn’t mind, neither did Tony.
And even though Tony didn’t really seem to be angry at him, Steve’s mind wasn’t at ease. Because not having been there when Tony slipped into his little headspace wasn’t the only reason why Steve felt guilty, but also the fact that he had somehow liked how things had turned out after that.
“Do me a favor champ, go to the kitchen and get as many nuggets as you want, they’re on the counter,” Steve instructed.
“I’m sorry to interrupt you Agent, but your presence is needed in Sir’s and Captain Roger’s room,” JARVIS informed.
Before Tony could hold onto it Steve reached for the pillow, pulled it away and put it under one of his legs where it wouldn’t be easy to be snatched away. Tony grunted once more as he curled in on himself and hid his face against his knees, clearly not wanting to face Steve.
“I’m happy you want to, sweetheart, daddy pretty much would like to play too,” Steve stated with a grin from ear to ear. “Would you let me hold you?” he asked.
“I know, peanut. Daddy will snuggle with you in bed and read you a story as soon as I make sure Tony’s okay,” Phil promised as he made a beeline to Tony’s and Steve’s bedroom, hastening his steps when his ears perceived the sound of someone sobbing.
Steve felt awful. Little Clint might be mischievous, but he had never handled been scolded very well. Hurrying to his side, Steve lifted him off the chair without hesitation and placed him on his lap once he had sat on a chair that wasn’t wet. Clint wriggled a little, but an arm around his waist was enough to keep him in place. “It’s okay kiddo, it was an accident,” he soothed.
“NO!” Tony hurried to say, too abruptly and horrified that it made Steve feel all warm inside. It was great to know Tony was so averse to separate from him. Certainly, the feeling was mutual.
That shouldn’t be a big deal. Steve had been more than happy to end their day having a play date, and Tony couldn’t deny it had been a pleasant afternoon. The thing was that Tony still couldn’t figure out what sent him into that mindset, and not being able to control it led him to the second problem he had with all this: what if one day he felt little and Steve wasn’t anywhere around?
“What I want to say is that Clint doesn’t need to wear diapers, he doesn’t even like wearing pull-ups, he doesn’t need you to feed him or carry him, and he doesn’t need to sleep in a crib. You and I know he behaves a bit younger than he is every now and then, but even during those occasions he doesn’t like to be treated like a baby,” Phil explained.
Ten minutes later, Steve was glad he kept insisting, because Tony got up from his lap and waddled towards the corner of the room where Clint was. Two minutes more, and Steve wished he hadn't done that. Of all the things he could have imagined Tony doing, snatching the Lego bricks bucket Clint was about to begin playing with was absolutely not one of them.
“So, how are you feeling?” Steve repeated, placing his right hand on Tony’s upper arm and rubbing his thumb against it. Tony’s body stiffened slightly, but he didn’t try to get away from the touch.
Pouts, those Phil could deal with, as long as Tony didn’t decide to run away one more time, there wouldn’t be no problem. What Phil hadn’t been expecting was to hear Tony starting to cry again all of a sudden for no apparent reason. That had certainly made Phil uneasy, because he was afraid there was nothing he could do about it; if he tried to sit Tony on his lap in order to soothe him just as he usually did with Clint, Tony would surely refuse. And the fact that Tony was calling for Steve, sometimes saying his name and sometimes saying
Only twenty minutes later, Tony started that adorable fluttering of his eyes where they remained closed for far longer than open, undeniable signal that soon he’d fall asleep. Taking into account how little he must have slept over the last days and how mortifying all this situation had to be for him, it was no surprise. Steve only needed to keep reading and rocking him for a bit while longer till his baby was finally sound asleep, though keeping him like that proved to be harder than foreseen.
One thing had been to be allowed to put a fresh diaper on him, and a different thing was to be allowed to change a diaper that had already been used. It had taken Tony quite a while to be comfortable with the idea of relieving himself in them, and even after it became something habitual in their age play sessions, he’d never failed to look fairly distressed afterwards. If Tony decided it was too embarrassing and he wanted to deal with diapers changes himself, Steve was more than willing to go along with it.
"But right now I'm ordering you something else, and my suits are not anyone!" Tony fumed, how come nothing work out the way he wanted lately? Had he broken a mirror and he hadn’t even noticed about it or what?
No, Steve wasn't going to take action. He couldn't. If it turned out Tony had changed his mind, Steve would have to wait until he said so himself.
Fortunately, Tony didn’t head for anyplace outside his floor. Phil felt a bit relief when he saw him entering one of the guest rooms. If Tony had gone to his workshop, it would have certainly been more difficult to get him out of there. JARVIS granted Steve permission to go inside despite Tony’s orders, but Phil doubted the A.I. would do the same for him.
That was good, because Phil couldn’t wait any more time, he had already wasted around half an hour waiting for Clint to come down, and he had to get to Tony’s room as soon as possible. JARVIS hadn’t exactly said Tony was in trouble or anything like that, the A.I. hadn’t even specified if Tony was feeling little or not, but Phil figured his assistance wouldn’t be needed if Tony was in his adult mindset.
Had Tony made that decision because of something Steve had done? Something Tony had disliked? If that was the case, Steve wanted to know what it had been, maybe they could set some other rules and boundaries and work this whole situation out. Steve was aware of the fact that he sometimes made Tony do things they hadn’t exactly agreed to, though the only reason he did that was because of Tony’s lack of courage to go and get the things he desired but thought he didn’t deserve or shouldn’t have. Not for nothing had Steve been the one who took the first step in their relationship, and not the other way around as everybody seemed to think. Steve had had a hard time getting through Tony’s head that he was much more than good enough for Captain America.
“Just this time, I promise,” Steve insisted, Clint shook his head vigorously as he kept trying to kick Steve away. “Look, if you’re a good boy, Uncle Steve’s going to buy pizza for lunch, how about that?” he proposed, and he would have laughed at the way Clint instantly stopped, eyes wide open in disbelief. Phil rarely allowed him to eat junk food while he was in his little headspace, arguing adult Clint already ate too much of it. So, junk food always came in handy when blackmailing Clint into behaving.
A little gracelessly, as the splint obliged him to move clumsily, Steve scooted over right beside Tony. Closeness always did wonders for him, especially when he was this anxious. Tony’s body stiffened so hard that there was a moment when Steve thought he was going to try to run away once more, but he stayed right where he was, only tightening his hold on the pillow. Perhaps he wanted to resolve this matter as much as Steve did.
Deciding there was no point on staying in his workshop when he felt too uncomfortable to concentrate, Tony asked JARVIS to save the progress and shut down everything. There was a time when Tony denied being sick and continued working, only taking short breaks until the discomfort he felt was too much to stand it. And even then, the only thing he did to mitigate the pain was lie down for a little while on the sofa he had right there in his workshop.
He had felt how his bladder had been practically crying out for release before losing control of it, however, standing up and going to the bathroom hadn’t seemed to be a priority until it had been too late. He had understood why Phil had refused to leave him alone – and he had been sure it would’ve been worse if Phil actually had – nonetheless, Tony had insisted on kicking him out and running away from him when given the opportunity. He had been able to see how clumsy his movements became and how there had been some things that had proved difficult for him to perform because of that; even so, he had rejected Phil’s help emphatically.
It wasn’t until certain piece of furniture started to show slight discrepancies that Steve’s suspicions aroused, because the crib was something Clint avoided like the plague and, therefore, he couldn’t be the one who was moving things around.
“You were the one who punch me!” Steve defended himself, a little bit shocked because of what just happened.
“I won’t have an accident, I promise,” Clint said. Steve doubted it. This was one of the rare occasions when Clint was behaving littler than usual, and when that happened, it was almost impossible for him to control his bladder. Steve didn’t want to deal with a fussy and cranky Clint for having wet his pants, especially when he still hadn’t figured out what he was going to do once Tony woke up.
So, here it is, I apologize in advance for any mistakes you may run into, I'm pretty sure there are some as I really had some problems trying to express in English what I would have said in my own language, and I did a lot of research trying to find the correct expression, but I'm not sure I nailed it.
Of course, Tony wouldn’t have been that absent-minded during the battle if Steve hadn’t told him they needed to talk right before taking off and heading for Central Park. Who in his right mind would say such a thing minutes before having to fight with a freaking oversized lizard? Tony couldn’t help paying more attention to the little voice inside his head, which was trying to figure out what on earth Steve had meant by that, than to Steve’s orders.
“Actually, I’m just starting the last chapter, I’ll lend you the book as soon as I’m done,” Steve promised.
“Uncle Steve,” Clint called, appearing in front of him out of nowhere. Was Steve dozing off that badly?
“Why don’t you give it a try? I promise I won’t make you eat it if you don’t like it,” Phil proposed once Clint was standing in front of him, between his legs.
Steve sighed heavily when Tony’s eyes began to fill up with tears. Not once had Tony demanded for a sippy cup, not even when they had just started age playing, so why did he have to want one precisely today?
Determined to finish once and for all, Tony opened his eyes, but his sight was a little blurry. Maybe a nap wasn’t such a bad idea, it might clear his mind and let him see the root of those glitches. Nevertheless, napping on a sofa wasn’t an appealing idea. Contrary to popular believe, it wasn’t easy for him to fall asleep just anywhere, he was a millionaire for God’s sake, his body was more than used to sleeping on the finest mattresses. If he ever did, it was just because the fatigue had caused his body to shut down, and right now he wasn’t that exhausted, not yet. Perhaps if he had his ted… He shook his head angrily to get rid of that thought, clearly Anthony Stark didn’t need that, didn’t want that. He would stay there and try to doze for some minutes, just enough time to clear his mind and…
Allowing himself to slip into his little headspace and going to look for Steve would've been an easy solution – surely the man wouldn't refuse to play his daddy role if he saw Tony was already Little – if only Tony had been able to do that. Whether it had been because he unconsciously knew that would’ve been playing unfairly (as much as Tony would’ve liked to deny it, he knew Steve’s reasons weren’t at all flawed) or because he’d indeed been too stressed and that had somehow blocked his ability to drop into headspace, Tony hadn’t been sure; but he’d tried not put too much thought into it. The day he craved for a play date really badly, he’d simply summon up enough courage to tell Steve.
“Then tell me what you feel like eating, I’ll cook whatever you want,” Steve offered, voice as tender as he could manage.
By the sixteenth time, the food had gone cold and Steve had already lost his patient. He tried to cool off by breathing slowly, and, not even bothering to drag him anymore, he put an arm around the other man’s waist and lifted him just a bit to carry him to the table. Tony surely wasn’t quiet or still during the process, but he certainly couldn’t do anything against Steve’s unnatural strength.
“Tony, sweetheart, would you please lend your lego bricks to Clint? He promises to be careful with them,” Steve asked, voice as tender as possible, Tony shook his head fervently. Of course he did, Clint wasn’t the only one who had been refusing to any proposal Steve had been making, otherwise Steve wouldn’t be in this predicament. “Baby, Clint’s our guest, we have to treat him well.”
“You want to help me? You want to help me?!! There’s no way I’m going to deal with fucking psychologists again! I already know this is so fucked up, I don’t need a bunch of strangers telling me how disgusting I am, how abnormal this is! So, you can take your help and shove it up your ass!! I don’t need it!” Tony snapped, shrugging Steve’s hand from his shoulder not gently.
Fury had been more than furious, and he would have kicked Iron man out of the team if he had known what had really happened. Bruce had been devastated when he saw the result of transformation and had stopped talking to Tony for more than a month. Tony had felt worse than crap. And Steve, well, that was when Tony found out Steve would not hesitate to put him over his knee and stop him from sitting comfortable for a week at least. And at the end, Tony had slipped into his Little mindset anyway. So, everything had been incredibly futile.
After his parents’ deaths, Tony finally had the chance to be who he was, but the feeling of being and doing something wrong never left him. It wasn’t until after the kidnapping when he could no longer resist slipping into his Little headspace anymore. And even then, the only things he allowed himself to do werewas suck his thumb and play with some legos he had asked JARVIS to purchase for him online. Nobody could know his dirty little secret. There was already a lot of bad press all over the world about him and his one night stands, but nothing related to this infantile side of him. Well, nobody but JARVIS, but that was totally different.
"Look at me," Steve ordered gently, hands holding Tony's wrists. "C'mon Tony, look at me," he repeated. Tony hesitated a bit before turning his eyes up, his head still down. "There's nothing wrong with not knowing what you want, OK? I asked you just in case you have something in particular in mind, but it's OK if you don't," Tony said nothing, "we can figure out together what suit us better, don't you think?" Steve questioned, and gave Tony a slight squeeze with his legs to let him know he wanted an answer. Tony nodded. "So, please take it easy, this is supposed to be relaxing, you shouldn’t stress out," Tony nodded one more time. "Can I hug you?" Steve asked, though Tony found himself being pulled into a hug before he could reply, half-sitting on Steve’s lap.
Only this time Steve didn’t place him on his chair, he went directly to his and sat down, placing Tony on his lap and keeping his arm around his waist to avoid him to leave.
Steve felt Tony’s body tensed one more time, and even if his face was half-hidden against his chest, Steve could tell Tony had gone crimson.
Without knowing how or when, Tony had noticed JARVIS had acquired an eerie ability to know when he was slipping into his little headspace. Tony wasn’t thrilled about it, because if JARVIS knew, chances were Steve would too, and he would show up soon, making it impossible for Tony to stay big.
"Can we talk now?" The blond one asked, getting no answer because Tony was more focus on cleaning the tears with the back of his hand. "I asked you something, Tony." this time he got a nod as an answer. "I'd like a verbal answer, please." And this was the part Tony hated the most when he wasn't lectured while being spanked, because like that he could take the situation as an excuse for not giving answers and not facing him at all, but a lecture after the spanking meant that Steve wanted him to pay complete attention, and that was so difficult when he just wanted to curl on a corner and ignore reality for a little while.
That mental image of him chasing Tony while he giggled uncontrollably still looked agonizingly far. Nonetheless, having his baby melted into his embrace while he rocked him back and forth to make him fall asleep helped Steve realize that, even if it took Tony a long time to arrive to the stage Steve wanted him to be, he would undoubtedly enjoy the process.
The rocking started to make Tony sleepy again, and Steve’s heartbeats were making even harder to focus on staying awake – when the hell had he leaned his head on Steve’s chest? Bit by bit, Tony’s yearning to leave faded, and all vestige of anger completely vanished when he looked up and his eyes caught the sight of Steve: his head was leaning on the back of the rocker, his eyes closed, his Adam’s apple moving to the rhythm of the lullaby and his expression showed complete peace.
Well, I do have a lot of things to do, but I love procrastination, so I ended up writing a little instead of clearing up my desk from all the paperwork I have accumulated (which is the thing that stressed me in the first place and made me want to write, so, no regrets XD)
“I… I can’t.” Tony whispered. And it was truth. Tony had to admit that he could get a bit childish, but he had never completely slipped into his Little mindset in front of anybody. Never. And just the thought of doing it made him nauseous and uneasy. The feeling of being doing something incorrect took over him without being able to do something about it. Steve sighed deeply.
Tony’s hand twisted nervously into the sheets, unsure of what to do. Why had he shouted like that? What was he supposed to do now? Should he tell Steve what was really going on inside his head, or should he keep hoping Steve eventually get what his intentions were? He couldn’t, not right now. Besides the fact he hadn’t really thought about what to say, Steve had to go and check on Clint.
“Does it really bother you that much the fact that I want to express my affection by looking after you? By coddling you?” Steve asked, voice serious. Yes, he wanted Tony to agree to age play, he wanted to show him how things could be, but what Steve didn’t want was doing something that Tony wasn’t comfortable with. Even if Tony had argued several times that Steve shouldn’t, he will always put Tony’s needs before his.
The bed and the crib might be parallel in some ways, though the most evident dissimilarity was the thing that was causing all this turmoil inside Tony’s head. The sides surrounding the crib, instead of triggering some sort of claustrophobia or feeling of confinement as logic dictated, caused an unusual sense of protection and coziness that Tony couldn’t understand. Somehow, his mind had linked that unique characteristic of the crib to the fact that that night, where he ended up there accidentally, Tony had slept better than he had in a long time; he had woken up well-rested, calm – or as calm as it had been possible taking into account the hangover and the initial consternation, which were inevitable giving the circumstances – and, best of all, without having experienced nightmares.
While Phil attempted to soothe Tony – without good results – Clint had an accident, and soon Phil had to deal with two crying littles.
This was another kind of intimacy, a much deeper one; one that Steve truly appreciated and understood.  Tony might be a little too carefree about who he shared the bed with when he wasn’t in a committed relationship, but this, well, under no circumstance would Tony share this with anyone. It would leave him too vulnerable, too exposed, and someone like him simply couldn’t afford to do that. Allowing Steve to see him in such state just told him how much trust Tony had put in him.
“Don't forget to wash your hands!” Steve said as he rolled the diaper he just took off from Tony. Even if it wasn't wet, Steve liked to use a fresh one when he re-diapered him. He might as well avoid the trouble and change to pull-ups until Tony decided he was ready to make the transition – if he ever did – it would be certainly save Steve time and effort, but he figured it would just discourage Tony more. The more realistic everything was, the better.
“No, seriously, what happened?” Steve asked as Tony sat down on the bed next to him, voice a bit worried, “are you sick or something?” he placed a hand on Tony’s forehead which Tony pushed away almost immediately.
"JARVIS, send me one of my suits please." A smirk showing on his face as Tony ordered that. He might not be a worthy opponent while being just Tony, but when he was Iron man, well, that was a different story.
One corner of Steve’s mouth twitched slightly.  “Yes, Tony, you are. You don’t make decisions out of nowhere. I know you, and you’re not as impulsive as you claim you are. Your decisions, no matter how reckless they seem, are very premeditated. Even when you go against my orders in the battlefield, I know you’ve already calculated and foreseen every possible outcome.”
. There was no way Tony was going to call it anything else. Because it sure as hell wasn’t a nursery. An adult man couldn’t have a nursery. An adult man shouldn’t have a nursery.
“Anthony!” Steve yelled, interrupting him again, he really didn’t want to know what the proposal was going to be. “Would you please stop changing the topic?! OK, I get it, I know you don’t want to talk about what happened the other day, and again, I’m really sorry, I shouldn’t have gone inside without knocking or something, I assure you it won’t happen again. I just wanted to talk to you to tell you it’s OK. I already knew about that.”
“Rocking chair, one, Raawry, two,” Steve recalled as he showed his index and middle finger to emphasize the quantity, “you see, two and the deal were three. Which one is the third one?” he asked, and he couldn’t help feeling more confused when Tony limited himself to slam the rail of the crib with his free hand, his lower lip pushed out even more.
“I know, and before you imply it, I’m not trying to get you into playing today. I really feel like watching a movie that doesn’t have guns, violence or a complex dialogue in it,” Steve assured, trying that the expression on his face looked as honest as possible. It was true that sometimes he helped Tony to go into his littlespace by making us of childish things, like watching animated movies, but that wasn’t something he had planned on doing right now.
However, even if Tony doubted Steve would make him wear the diaper if he refused, its presence meant Steve wanted him to wear it. How could he refuse now after the fiasco of the bath toys? Tony couldn’t. Another disappointed look on Steve’s face would be too much.
Needless to say he never really allowed himself to use that room or any of the items there, but his mind calmed down just a little by knowing the nursery was there, and that was enough. Well, he didn’t used it, at least not until Steve came into the picture. And even then, it wasn’t very often.
“Is there something wrong?” Steve asked when their eyes met. Tony said nothing, but he turned his head towards where the bath toys laid in the now empty bathtub. That gesture had been enough for Steve to understand his mortification, “Hey, baby, it’s OK, if you didn’t like them, we can go shopping together and buy something you like,” he suggested.
He grabbed the chair and smashed it into the window. Tiredness didn’t let him realize either how obvious it was that the glass wasn’t a weak one, being the Avengers and having a lot of enemies who wanted to kill them meant that he had gotten the tower built with the most resilient materials that ever existed. His anger just increased, and even if it wasn’t going to work, he kept smashing the door with the chair, until it broke.
Sorry for the long wait, besides the fact that I've been busy and my mind has been a total mess over the last weeks, I experienced some sort of writer's block with this story in particular. I guess you'll be able to tell just by seeing how short this chapter was.
“If he ever jokes about it, I’m gonna stop talking to you,” Clint assured, folding his arms over his chest and kicking him one more time.
“Sir, this is the second time I have to ask Dr. Banner to use to stairs instead,” JARVIS informed, and Tony could’ve sworn there was a hint of amusement in his voice, “if I have to deny him the access to the elevator for a third time, he might think it’s broken and come looking for you, which would only ruin your plans for the afternoon.”
What the hell was wrong with him? Did he really feel like crying just because Steve was leaving? Yes, he had come upstairs because the urge to be comforted by daddy had become unbearable, but that didn’t mean he had stopped considering that idea irrational or stupid. If Steve had already something to do, he shouldn’t cancel it because Tony felt like getting some cuddles. It was just not right. Age playing shouldn’t interfere with their activities, that had been something both of them had agreed on.
Sighing deeply, Phil decided it wasn’t such a good idea to contradict Tony, at least not for the time being, “okay, let’s go to your room and see if none of your jeans fit.” It would actually be great if one pair did, that way Phil wouldn’t have to deal with a grumpy little for the rest of the afternoon. “C’mon.”
Why did he have to feel this anxious? It wasn’t unusual for him to wake up and find the other side of the bed empty. Steve’s and his schedule hardly ever matched, Steve was a morning person and preferred to go to bed early, and Tony, on the contrary, liked to work well into the night and sleep during all morning – if he ever went to bed. Therefore, Tony should be used to it.
Sucking his thumb became a way to soothe himself whenever stress started to be too much, JARVIS had to call his attention once because Tony was about to put a greasy finger in his mouth. Hugging his dinosaur stuffie helped him to fall asleep more easily on those nights when he’d decided to go to bed and Steve was away on a mission. Hanging out in the nursery for a while reduced his anxiety, especially if he got JARVIS to play in the background one of the recordings there were of the times Steve had read him to bed.
And how had Steve managed to get Tony to clean up? That was something not even Tony could explain. One minute he was staring at Steve with a ‘I’m-not-buying-it’ expression on his face while the latter pretended putting away the boxes was fun, and the next minute Tony was trying to gather more boxes than Steve, turning the whole thing into a competition without realizing it. Trying to beat Steve somehow gave Tony a rush of adrenaline, and the look on his face when Tony had dared to knock his pile down had been priceless.
“First tell me why you decided that. Why did you say you didn’t want to do this anymore?” Steve conditioned, without having the intention of letting Tony go. Chances were his baby didn’t even need to release his bladder and he was using that just as an excuse to avoid the conversation. Steve could clearly picture him running off as soon as he had the opportunity. “Huh?”
With that in mind, Steve turned the stove off and poured some milk in a bottle after retrieving it from over the counter. It was a bit too hot, but by the time Steve fed Tony with it, the milk would be cool enough. After adding a little honey, he twisted the nipple into place and headed back to the living room with the bottle in his hands, leaving the pot to be washed later.
It wasn’t like Tony didn’t have the ability to drive Steve out of his mind – because he definitely did and he definitely had – though this was something that would never bring out a feeling of anger or resentment in Steve. If anything, the only thing he was feeling now was a rush of determination clawing through him. Determination to show his baby that he wouldn’t turn out to be like everyone else, that he was going all in with their relationship, that tough times wouldn’t make him back out, that he would work hard on becoming someone completely reliable no mattered how long it took. As long as Tony wanted him around – and even if he stopped doing so, there was going to be some sort of resistance until proven to be the right choice – Steve would be there.
Because of that, Tony felt there was no need for him to pretend he was perfectly healthy anymore – Steve wouldn’t allow it anyway. He would never admit it, but he secretly loved being nursed back to health. If he had started hiding the fact that he was sick, it had only been because, after Jarvis had passed away, there was nobody who would take the trouble to look after him. Rhodey and Pepper had certainly cared for him a few times, but it wasn’t always possible due to their busy lives. And if Steve was willing to do it, well, Tony might as well enjoy it.
Pushing Tony’s plate aside, Steve reached for the bottle in front of them and lowered Tony back a little so his back could be entirely supported by his arm. A more comfortable position to drink from a bottle. Futile, because Tony turned his face away when Steve offered the nipple of the bottle.
And If that hadn’t been enough, when it was time to change Tony, he had refused too. Clint might not mind getting changed in front of Tony, but Tony did.
"We are already here Tony. C'mon, at least give it a try, if you don't feel comfortable or you don't like it, we'll stop and that's it," Steve urged.
With long and hasty strides, Steve walked into the tower and stepped into the elevator, and he couldn’t help feeling a bit perplexed when it started going up instead of down when he asked JARVIS to take him where Tony was. Why wasn’t he heading for the workshop? That was Tony’s favorite hideout, wasn’t it?
“I’m sorry honey, but daddy doesn’t want you to get all cranky because you’re not able to fall asleep tonight.”
“I know you said you weren’t feeling little right now, but, how about taking a nap with your daddy? I promise I won’t stop you from going to your workshop when you wake up,” Steve suggested, suddenly in the mood of hanging with little Tony.
Sadly, Steve had decided to wait for Tony to initiate anything related to age play (though every passing day it became harder to remember why he’d chosen to do such thing) and he was firmly resolved to be true to his word. It was necessary and vital for Steve to confirm what his baby liked from this role-play, but also for Tony to finally acknowledge all that himself; otherwise, he wouldn’t really be able to make the most of the whole experience. It’d certainly take Tony quite some time to come around, he was too stubborn for his own good sometimes, but Steve was anything but patient.
Sitting down fast, he took out his thumb and cleaned the dried drool that was on the corner of his mouth. Damn it! Why was this happening again?
“Sorry, baby, but it’s dinner time,” Steve said, leaning down and managing to slide his hands under Tony’s armpits so he could scoop Tony up off the bed.
“No! I was just trying to set them as an example, which I really shouldn’t have,” Steve promised, running his hands though his hair as a sign of frustration. “Please, let’s sit down, let me explain you,” Steve pleaded when he saw Tony standing up in a brusque way.
“Yes. Well, unless you’d used my tablet before. When you use it, all the pop-ups usually show me advertising of painting tools and things like that,” Tony informed, turning a bit around to he could lean his arm on the back of the sofa, facing him. “So, I was intrigued when the ads showed me something different today, because there was no doubt they had to do something with the last things that were browsed in here," Tony said, raising the tablet so Steve could see what the screen displayed.
“Well, excuse me, but someone has to bring home the beacon,” Tony said sarcastically, looking falsely offended, “if I don’t meet my deadlines, Pepper won’t pay me.”
But as he grew older, things started to get weird. Abnormal. Often Tony would find himself sucking his thumb without even realizing it – thank God that happened when no one was around, kids could be really mean at that age. There were other times when he just didn’t feel like himself, he felt so vulnerable and fragile that all he wanted was to be held and cuddled. Sometimes he fantasized about one of his admired teachers holding him on his lap and just comforting him, but obviously that would never happen – could never happen – not to mention that those thoughts were very odd. And it was on those days, when he was feeling kind of off, that Tony was afraid of going to bed, because on those nights especially he would wake up in the middle of the night with wet sheets and pajama bottoms stuck to his skin. Not only was it humiliating, but dealing with soiled sheets was a pain when living in a boarding school.
Moving closer to him in slow motion, to give him the chance to back away just in case Tony decided to change his mind, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, pressing him against his chest as much as possible. His hands clung to Tony’s muscle shirt almost with desperation as he took a deep breath so he could inhale his scent – a combination of coffee and sweat that was so characteristic in him after spending many days in his workshop – realization of how much he had missed Tony hitting him hard.
“Don’t go, I don’t want you to go with Clint,” Tony admitted, slurring and talking so softly he was sure Steve couldn’t have heard him if he had been someone else.
“Of course not, I never get sick,” Tony assured. Steve rolled his eyes at him. It was obvious that Steve wished to refute that statement, but he refrained himself from doing so. That topic never led to anything good.
Steve tiptoed out of the room to avoid waking Tony up, Pepper had come very early and had dragged Tony to some meetings he was supposed to attend to, which meant Tony hadn’t gotten much sleep. Normally, Steve made sure Tony went to bed early the night before a meeting – getting him out of bed when he had barely slept a couple of hours was an odyssey – but Tony had totally forgotten about said meetings and Steve had never been notified about them.
“So?” Steve prompted His baby screwed his eyes closed and curled into himself as if he didn’t want to be there when the inevitable response was enunciated. “What made you assume I’d leave?”
Clint had been in a horrible mood when he arrived home. Catching up on reports tended to have that effect on him, and since Fury found out that Steve was writing Clint’s reports for him, he had forbidden it. Now, Fury made sure Clint had definitely been the one who had made the report, and if he failed to hand three reports in a row, he was called into the headquarters and wouldn’t be allowed to leave until he updated everything. Today had been one of those days.
"Phil made me promise not to tell you anything about it," Steve informed when Clint brought the topic up.
Although what caught Tony’s attention was not the way Clint had acted, but the way Steve had. How patiently he had treated Clint. How lovingly. How he hadn’t reacted in a bad way when Clint refused to sit down at the table. How he had managed get Clint to help him clearing the table by turning the task into a competition.  How he had entertained Clint until Phil finally showed up. How he had put up with Clint’s bratty behavior without looking frustrated or annoyed in the slightest. How natural this seemed to be for Steve. How this daddy role suited him.
How to tell Tony about the Age Play? That had been the only thought in Steve’s mind for weeks, and he still hadn’t been able to come up with an answer.
“Leave it to you to always manage to hurt yourself in your own house,” Steve commented, standing up and holding out his hand to help Tony get up. Tony didn’t hesitate to accept it.
This was the fourth time they had a play date, and Steve was still finding it hard to believe it. After the fight they had had when Tony found out about his interest in Age Play, Steve had truly believed that had been it, and he was more than willing to forget about the matter if that was what Tony wanted. It had been such a big surprise when Tony admitted he was curious about it too.
“Hey, I only grabbed the book because your cell phone was more interesting to you than me a couple of hours ago,” Steve excused himself. “If my memory serves me correctly, I tried to make conversation and you just blew me off and continued with whatever you were doing,” he reminded Tony. The latter opened his mouth clearly trying to argued, but no words were pronounced, accepting this way that Steve hadn’t been mistaken.
Steve stared at him for a while, as he started to rocking them both back and forward, until Tony couldn’t stand his sight and hid his face against his chest, snuggling closer. Steve chuckled before he began to hum, tightening his grip. His heart always melted whenever he saw Tony trying to hide, still feeling too ashamed about this whole situation. Letting his eyes closed, Steve kept rocking and rubbing Tony’s tummy with his thumb, enjoying the moment of serenity.
“And second,” Steve proceeded, ignoring Tony’s last comment, “A lot of people give teddy bears on Valentine’s Day, it’s like a very typical present,” Steve indicated.
Needless to say that the captain wasn't expecting to see something good, but what he saw when he got inside the room wasn't anything he had ever imagined. He got a little scared when he saw Tony curled against a wall, clearly panicking, images of somebody breaking in floated through his mind as he got close to him. But then JARVIS told him what had happened, and well, that sounded very much like Tony.
For a thousandth of second, he turned his head towards Tony, glaring. And before the latter could react, he approached him and dragged him to the living room, sitting down on the sofa and placing him over his lap.
Too bad his mind was going to play tricks on him once more, and now, every time Steve remembered what had happened that night, it would be Tony and not Clint the one who snuggled on his lap.
“Then just lie down with me for a while, you do need to rest,” Steve said as he stood up with Tony in his arms. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and his legs around his waist instantly, showing Steve that way that he certainly didn’t mind spending some time as little. “But first let’s change you into something more comfortable,” he announced, earning a grunt from Tony. He knew for sure what items of clothing Steve thought as comfortable.
Everything he had tried to do to make Steve realize he had changed his mind about the Age Play had been nothing but abortive attempts. Steve hadn’t gotten any of the hints. Tony hadn’t been read to bed, he hadn’t been fed, he hadn’t gotten Steve to play with him with some drones he had especially built for the sole purpose of playing, and even the time Tony had tried to get Steve to bath him, they had ended up having shower sex. It wasn’t that he was complaining about that, but that was definitely not what he had had in mind when he sneaked in the bathroom seconds before Steve.
What did Tony expect to see? Steve bottle feeding Clint? It wasn’t even a fact that Steve was a part of Clint’s Age Play! Though Tony’s brain didn’t seem to be able to understand that, and a couple of days later, he broke his own promise, getting JARVIS to display the images of what those two were up to once more. And another time after that one. And some others more.
“Yes you do! And you’re going to tell me this instant because now I have to deal with your teacher, otherwise she’ll be a pain in my ass!” Howard yelled, putting slamming down the glass not in a nicely way.
Steve couldn't help chuckling. “I'm not naked,” he assured, opening the door of the nursery so Tony and he could step inside.
There, Steve had to manage to heat up the dinner using only one hand, since the other one was supporting Tony, who refused to let go during the process.
“And you won’t make go to bed early, or eat disgusting food, or limit my time with the TV and videogames, and wear stupid pull-ups!” Clint slurred, obviously trying to take advantage of the fact that Steve was agreeing to everything.
With the intention of following JARVIS’s advice, Steve put down the sheets and left the nursery, and he would have gone to Tony’s workshop and talked to him to settle this issue once and for all if the alarm to assemble hadn’t gone off at that very moment.
The following morning, his mind was a total mess. In the first minutes after Tony woke up, before he was fully conscious, he curled into a small ball and allowed himself to enjoy the sensation of complete safety and comfort that surrounded him. Unfortunately, only a few minutes later, an awful headache started pulsing at his temples – because, okay, he’d had way too much alcohol and his body wasn’t as resilient to the substance as it had been twenty years ago – and all that feeling of peace vanished in a flash, his heart skipping a beat when he got a glimpse of the bars around him.
The idea of complaining crossed Tony’s mind but he immediately discarded it, and instead nodded slowly. He’d decided he’d do this correctly no matter what, so he’d man up and suck it up. Besides, there was a part of him which didn’t want to disappoint his daddy.
“Or why don’t you build a nice big castle with your Legos? You like playing with Legos, don’t you, sweety?” Steve continued, hoping one of his suggestions ended up interesting Tony.
I'm really sorry for making you wait this long. I won't say I'll try to update sooner because I really don't know if I will, but I do promise that I'm gonna try.
The problem had been Tony. Specifically, Tony’s little self. If he hadn’t been able to calm down was because Steve’s absence had really affected him. He had missed Steve in a way his adult self had never. It had been nothing like what he felt when he woke up and found out that Steve was long gone; or when he hadn’t seen him for days because their responsibilities had kept them apart, or when he had to go to meetings on the other side of the world and Steve couldn’t come along; or when he found himself suddenly aroused, desperate for Steve’s touch, and he couldn’t find him anywhere around. No, what he felt during those moments didn’t compare to how wrecked he had felt that day, to how desperately his little side had needed Steve.
“Whut?” Tony raised his head a bit to look around, and slumped back down onto the mattress when he realized where they were. “Ohgodfuckme,” he grumbled, groping around for a pillow and hiding his head under it. If Steve wasn’t sure about which Tony he was dealing with, that curse made it clear. A familiar pang of disappointment took its place, though Steve did his best to ignore it. As much as he would’ve liked to have some more time with his baby, he knew it’d be easier to reason with Tony about everything that had happened yesterday if he was in his adult mindset. And, oh boy, did they need to talk!
Phil smiled sympathetically as he placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “I’m sure it won’t, but won’t you feel more relaxed knowing you have some protection just in case?” Tony shook his head, and Phil bit his lips, unsure of what to do.
Steve’s presence always kept those irrational thoughts at bay. Daddy’s presence always kept bad guys at bay. Daddy’s arms around him could protect him from anything. Daddy would never let anything bad happen to him. The problem was, daddy was nowhere around.
On the first day, Tony had been extremely fussy. He had gotten a mild fever once again and his throat had started to hurt more, for which Steve had had to be comforting him all day – as well as coaxing him into taking some medication. Yet, on the second and third day, Tony had felt better, and he had behaved pretty cutely, in Steve’s opinion. He had wanted to be carried all the time, he hadn’t hesitated to call him daddy, he hadn’t looked embarrassed when he was spoon-fed or changed, he had giggled when Steve tickled him, and he hadn’t seemed uncomfortable when Steve played with him.
The good thing was that Tony didn’t give up easily, and if he put his mind into it, he could always figure out how to get what he wanted the way he wanted. If he couldn’t really relax into his little headspace and wasn’t willing to follow Steve’s terms – at least not yet – there had to be another way, right? Perhaps if he behaved childishly, Steve would feel tempted to let it slip and take the initiative one more time, giving Tony a bit more time to get used to the idea that he sooner or later would have to abide Steve’s demands.
“Are you going to let your teddy down? You know he doesn’t like when you don’t listen to me,” Steve recalled as he grabbed the said Teddy bear – which had been bought not long ago – and placed it on Tony’s chest.
“If it’s about how to make your hair soft and silky as mine, ask Thor, I already told you he made me promise not to tell anyone,” Tony warned, fighting back a grin. Steve shook his head slightly in disapproval.
"Because you deserve it," Steve felt a stinging sensation in his chest when he saw Tony's disbelief expression. He squatted in front of Tony, placing his hands on Tony’s arms, leaning a little to be right in front of Tony, forcing him to look directly at his eyes. "People may say a lot of bad things about you, you may think a lot of bad things about yourself, and I regret it now, but at the beginning I thought those bad things were truth. Now I'm completely sure they're not. You're such a great person Tony, behind that façade you insist to hide yourself, there's a man who's always more concerned about the others than his own self. You always try to give us whatever we need, want and desire, no matter how difficult, expensive or dumb it is. But when it's about getting what you need and want, you refrained yourself? That's just not fair."
“No, I told you I don’t want to do this anymore, so leave,” Tony demanded, but the order didn’t sound like one due to the nervousness in his voice.
“Says the one who kicks me out of the workshop whenever I go with an invitation to do something,” Steve argued, turning his head so he could see Tony out of the corner of his eye. Tony took advantage of it and pressed a quick kiss on his lips.
want it, but I’m not sure I’ll like it once I try it, I don’t even know if you still want to, maybe you don’t even want to anymore, or you do and I try it and I don’t like it, so everything might be just worthless, so it may be not a good idea to give it a try, but I don’t really want to be left wondering how it would’ve been like,” Tony managed to babble all in one breath.
But then, Phil had fetched one diapers from the drawers – the guest room ended up being the room Steve was turning into a nursery, the same one Clint had told him about with a delighted expression on his face, as he had never seen so many toys – and that was enough to upset Tony once more. He had tried to run off the room, though Phil had been able to react rapidly this time and blocked his way. He had also stopped him from locking himself inside the bathroom or the closet too. So, feeling trapped, Tony had curled up into a small ball on the furthest corner of the room, and he had stayed there for the last twenty minutes.
“Let’s go to the kitchen,” Steve suggested, putting the now folded changing mat and the other supplies on the corner of the couch, just in case he needed them later. He turned his head around and tried not to smile when he saw Clint pulling his t-shirt down as much as he could to cover the diaper, but it wasn’t long enough.
It took less than two minutes to go from his workshop to the living room in his floor; nevertheless, it’d been exactly fifty-eight minutes since Tony had decided to go and look for Steve, and he still hadn’t made it past the elevator.
Nevertheless, Tony lived in a universe where everything he planned seemed to be impossible to achieved, and instead of getting the scene he had visualized, he ended up with a plate filled with that damn salad, and an upset Steve. Tony was not going to finish what he had just been served, and Steve felt strongly about wasting food.
“Knock harder,” Tony ordered a bit grouchily, not knowing exactly why he felt moody all out of the blue.
Steve smiled sympathetically, kissed Tony on the forehead and pushed him gently to the bed until Tony lay down on it. Of course Tony would be embarrassed to be changed in front of Clint, but what other choice did Steve have? Sending Clint away was definitely not an option, Clint never lost the opportunity to make a mischief when he was left alone. And not diapering Tony seemed like a bad idea too; Steve was sure Tony still used the diapers at will, but what if today was the day when he had an accident for the first time? He was sure it would be more mortifying for Tony to wet his pants in front of Clint instead of wearing a diaper.
And maybe, just maybe, Tony wouldn’t have disliked it that much if he had had the opportunity to give it a try – he hadn’t exactly dreaded the pampering, though things like bottles and diapers were something Tony couldn’t really picture himself trying.
Tony wasn’t sure whether he liked that or not. There was no doubt that Steve would try to be there for him no matter what, though what truly scared Tony was how much his little side seemed to need Steve. It was like Tony couldn’t satisfy his need of him. Thanks to a weird turn of events, Tony had acquired a worthy daddy, and that idea was wonderful as well as terrifying.
Lost in thought, Tony realized they had reached the bedroom until Steve was putting him down on the bed. And just when Tony was thinking about loosing up a little, his body stiffened abruptly upon seeing what was laying right beside him: a diaper. A cars patterned diaper that looked too big to fit a child.
“OK, that’s enough for now,” Steve informed, pressing a kiss on Tony’s temple at the same time he reached for the fork he had put away minutes ago. “Open up,” he ordered as he held it up in front of his face once more.
Without being able to say how or when it had happened, Steve knew Tony had made that transition, he had passed from pretending to be little to genuinely be one.
Steve nodded, a comprehensive smile on his face. “Okay, that’s something you should be sorry for and I’m happy you are, Clint didn’t deserve to be treated like that, he wasn’t doing anything wrong. But I didn’t ask for an apology, you’ll apologize to him in due course. What I asked is for a reason. Why did you push Clint like that?” he repeated, thumb caressing Tony’s ankle soothingly. Tony shrugged.  “I need a verbal answer, Tony.”
“Tony, eat, please.” The last word wasn’t necessarily pronounced politely. “And stop with the swearing once for all.” And the tone of his voice should have been taken as a warning, for the soldier was very patient, but his patience wasn’t limitless.
“Jesus, Tony, are you OK?” Steve hurried and squatted down in front of him, scanning his body looking for injuries.
To Clint’s credit, it had really been an accident. After his demand had been heard, he stopped fussing and got back to eating, telling Steve all about a new video game that was going to be released–and that he obviously wanted either Phil or Steve to buy it for him–even if Steve asked him a few times not to talk with food in his mouth. The problem had been that Little Clint tended to use a lot of hand gestures when talking, especially if he was excited about the topic at issue, so when he explained Steve about how some characters from the video game burst, he extended his arms all of a sudden without paying attention to what he had close to him.
“Again, I’m so sorry to bother you. But you know how mischievous Clint can get when he’s not in the right mood and there’s not an adult around,” Phil apologized once more, though Steve didn’t think it was necessary. Besides the fact that Phil had just saved him from an afternoon of doing nothing – Steve had never really enjoyed being idle – it had been a long time since he’d gotten the chance to look after Little Clint–or any Little, for that matter–therefore, in Steve’s opinion, it was Phil the one who was doing him a favor and not the other way around.
Steve’s heart skipped a beat at that. He already suspected Tony hung out in the nursery when he wasn’t around, though the fact that Tony was there right now, after the incident at SHIELD hospital wing, was a proof that there was something amiss.
If Tony was asked to describe what a little headspace was like, one of the first words that would come to his mind would be ‘disconcerting’.
Steve didn’t insist, and Tony couldn’t be more grateful for that. He wasn’t sure how, but he would have to find a way to live with his face pressed into the pillow, because there was no way he could take it off. There he was, laying on a bed completely naked except for a diaper his boyfriend had put on him. Just the thought of it made his face feel on fire all over again.
Steve scratched his right temple, a thoughtful expression on his face. It was no secret for Clint and Phil that Tony had ended up agreeing to age play with him, and Tony was aware of the fact that they both knew. Even though, Steve doubted Tony would be thrilled if either of them showed up in their private floor while he was currently in bed, wearing only a diaper and a onesie.
"You will, but first I need to finish showering you, and I won't be able to do that if you keep moving," Phil argued. There was no way he was going to let Clint lie down on the bed while he was still covered in milk. And chocolate syrup. And cookies. And marshmallows. And sprinkles. And whipped cream. And cherries. And who knows what else Clint had put in the milkshake he had tried to make.
When he had the Stark Tower built, he made sure to include a spare room on his floor, which remained empty for a long time.
Drawing his knees up to his chest, Tony tried to control himself. He was in the tower, in his workshop, and there was no threat nearby – the alarm to assemble hadn’t gone off – so there was no reason to be as afraid as he was. If he had gone to bed when JARVIS had informed him he had been awake for more than thirty-nine hours, this wouldn’t be happening. He would have woken up in his bed this morning, and if he had still had a nightmare, daddy would have been there next to him ready to comfort him.
Steve leaned over to kiss Tony on the forehead before pulling him gently towards the sofa. “What do you feel like watching?” he questioned, sitting down and guiding Tony to do the same. Tony shrugged his shoulders, squinting his eyes at Steve when he took the mug from his hands and placed it on the coffee table.
Steve drew a breathless sigh, too tired himself to continue pushing Tony. “okay, okay, you little blackmailer,” he consented as he dropped a kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose, “but only because you were such a good and brave boy today,” he praised. Tony’s face crinkled in confusion. “Yes, you were. It takes a lot of courage to speak up the way you just did. Daddy’s so proud of you, sweetheart. But don’t think you’ve gotten out of this one,” he hurried to clarify when a small mischievous smile crossed Tony’s face. “we’re gonna go back to sleep, and when we wake up, daddy’s gonna do nothing but pamper you. But the next time we play, I expect my baby to tell me what he’s really liked so far.”
“Come here, let me help you with that,” Steve ordered, beckoning Clint to walk closer. He did, and Steve hurried to try to undo the buckles, but Clint’s constant jumping and squirming was not helping at all, “please stop moving,” he asked even if he knew Clint was doing that as a way to avoid losing control of his bladder.
“Yes, young agent, pizza,” the A.I. confirmed. Clint got up from the floor instantaneously and ran to the door as he warbled ‘pizza’.
“Would you just shut up?” Steve interrupted him, trying to sound polite but the frustration in his face gave him away. “You know exactly what I want to talk about, stop playing dumb on me.”
“Because you couldn’t, but not for the lack of trying… but anyway, that’s not the point now. The point is, why do you always have to make me do this? Why do we have to end up like this?” Steve asked, putting his hands on Tony’s hips in order to keep him in balance, because Tony’s legs were supporting less and less of his weight, and he was sure he wasn’t even realizing it.
So, Tony figured it would be easier if he waited until his bladder couldn't take it anymore, but it also proved to be more painful. Why did this have to be that hard? Clint had used a diaper twice that day without even realizing it. Why couldn’t Tony do the same? Why did he have to be so self-conscious about it?
The mortifying thing was that, besides the understandable amount of embarrassment that entailed, Tony felt alright.
“Okay. But don’t forget that daddy wouldn’t care if you’re a baby, toddler or kid, I’d enjoy taking care of you no matter what,” Steve stated, “and if you ever see me doing something with Clint that you’ll like to try yourself, don’t hesitate to let me know, nobody says babies can’t run, or play big boys games.” Tony nodded.
Hesitantly, Tony opened his mouth. He was already wearing a diaper, so drinking from a bottle wasn’t any better or worse. Shortly, a silicone teat settled on his tongue, but Tony didn’t suck until Steve gave him an encouraging squish. His taste buds detected delicious strawberry flavored milk, unconsciously making him continue sucking and swallowing. Some milk spilled down his chin at first when he sucked harder than necessary, but soon he got the hang of it. Tony didn’t know whether to feel proud or mortify about that.
“Correction, I haven’t gone to bed when you’ve been in it,” Tony remarked, releasing Steve from his embrace and straightening. “How do you know I haven’t been there when you’re training, spending time with Clint or out in the street?” he reasoned, walking around the sofa to stand in front of him.
The flight back to the tower was a blur; if JARVIS hadn’t activated the autopilot mode, Tony would have probably crashed into a building or something. By the time his brain started to register what was happening, Tony had already landed on the rooftop and was hurrying inside the tower while his robots struggle to remove the suit.
“Sweety, Clint’s not even paying attention to us,” Steve had assured. “Look, he’s there minding his own business,” he pointed out. Said business consisted on trying to unsnap his onesie, because without the overalls the onesie didn’t look like a t-shirt anymore, and Clint loathed wearing clothes for babies.
Steve rotated onto his rear leg to dodge the punch Clint had thrown at him, holding his fists up in case he decided to attack again.
It felt really nice to be able to hold Tony, his baby, like this after such a long time. It wasn’t like they hadn’t had any kind of intimacy over the last weeks; once the issue had died down, once Steve had decided it was better not to bring up the topic about Age Play for the time being, Tony had stopped avoiding him and things had apparently gone back to normal. Though it had just not been the same.
Tony snapped awake, sitting up abruptly while gasping desperately for air, the sensation of choking on water still too present, almost tangible. One hand clutched the sheets tightly as the other reached his neck, clasping it, needing to verify there was nothing surrounding it, wanting to make sure no one would dunk his head in a barrel full of water all of a sudden, demanding his lungs to take in as much oxygen as possible just in case that happened again, anxiety increasing when his lungs refused to cooperate, as if they had forgotten how to function correctly.
It hadn't been the first time Steve's departure went unnoticed by Tony, the mission hadn't been a life-threatening one – not as far as Tony knew – and it was only going to Steve a day to go back home; yet, Tony hadn't been able to cease the crying. The scene of him sobbing hard as he called for his daddy while Phil tried to soothe him was utterly ridiculous. Phil shouldn’t have had to explain him that Steve couldn’t go back yet. Tony should have calmed down and waited patiently for him, without making the fuss he had made; but his brain had refused to listen to reasoning, and the only thing he had been able to focus was on the fact that his daddy wasn’t there.
But then, there were the other things Tony couldn’t stand. Like how Steve seemed to not understand how difficult it was for him to slip into his Little mindset, how anxious, uneasy and panic stricken he felt – it was no wonder really, after all, Tony had spent a lot of years believing this was completely incorrect – and trying to help him with this transition would just make him moody and angry. But Steve thought that going on Daddy mode when Tony was in his adult mindset was a good idea to help him. It wasn’t. At all. That just made Tony feel much moodier and angrier. Didn't Steve know Tony was a busy man? Didn't he know he had a business to run? Inventions to develop? A world to save? Updates to make? Couldn’t he understand he did need to be an adult? Couldn't Steve just leave him alone? Couldn't he just leave him sulk and struggle with his headspaces in peace? Why did Steve have to be all over him, paying attention to any hint that told him Tony was starting to get caught between his two mindsets?
“If you spill the juice, I’m not cleaning it up,” Steve warned, already having given up. Little Clint was very stubborn, and if Steve didn’t want to spend the rest of the afternoon in the kitchen, he might as well let him drink from a glass.
“I see. Don’t worry, I’m more than happy to look after him,” Steve offered, already getting up from the couch.
“What are you eating?” Tony questioned several minutes after they both had sat at the table and started to eat. He felt a bit stupid when Steve raised an eyebrow in confusion. He had already told him what he his menu was.
“People are wrong when they say zombies are not possible. I have one as a boyfriend,” Steve joked when Tony stepped out of the elevator and entered the living room, dragging his feet as he clutched a mug to his chest like if it was the most precious thing in his life.
“Hey,” Clint greeted as the doors opened, hands stuffed in his pockets. “I was wondering if you wanted to hang out,” he proposed, “I’m kind of bored.”
Clint did nothing to avoid the kick. Steve had told him several times that tactic of his of receiving a blow just to get a better aim always fell on deaf ears, though that had somehow made him blows-resistant. Steve raised his arms more as he closed his eyes unconsciously, hoping his forearms stopped the punch Clint would surely throw now, but he opened them again when he heard something hitting the floor with a thud.
There was just one reason why Phil would call Steve at that hour: checking on Clint. And If Phil wanted Steve to do that was because Clint was in his Little mindset, and even if Phil would like to be the one when Clint slipped into that headspace, a mission or a SHIELD matter had to be preventing him from arriving home. Steve wouldn’t leave Clint alone if that was the case, he would stay with him during the rest of the night to look after him, and wouldn’t return to their bedroom until Phil came back.
That didn’t mean Tony had gotten angry at Steve, not at all. Steve hadn’t done anything wrong. If he had known that Tony had slipped into his Little headspace, he would have done everything in his power to get out of the mission and go back to the Tower, though he hadn’t.
“Well, if you’re not gonna attack, I will,” Steve informed as he pivoted on his left foot and swung his rear leg forward, directly to Clint’s waist.
“I’m sorry sweety,” Steve apologized. Tony always winced when the baby wipes came into contact with his skin, “I’m almost done,” he promised.
Yes, Phil was right. Steve wanted to try that so badly. The problem was he didn’t know if Tony would like it. Because, even if in Tony’s mind things looked the other way around, he was the type who needed to be looked after. Needless to say Tony wasn’t very keen of the idea, all the times Steve had tried to persuade him to do something to take better care of himself had already left a bad taste in his mouth. And Steve would feel very disappointed if he was turned down when he finally decided to tell Tony about the Age Play.
They had talked, of course they had talk, they never went without speaking to each other for more than five days. Steve was positive that that was the time required to cool off and waiting more would make things worse.
The proof was in the way Tony behaved during their last play dates, which wasn’t all that different from before to be honest, but it was in the details where Steve could tell nothing was he same. Like the way Tony pronounced the word ‘daddy’, it didn’t sound unnatural or forced anymore, it sounded as if the word had stopped feeling weird on Tony’s lips and now its pronunciation was full of love and adoration. Or the way Tony reached for him, he no longer waited for Steve to be the one who took the first step; Tony lifted his arms whenever he wanted to be picked up, he sat down on his lap on his own accord when it was time to eat, he snuggled into him when he wanted Steve to rock him to sleep.
Taking an arm out from under the sheets, Tony groped for his cell phone on the nightstand that laid next to his side of the bed and grunted when he found it and didn’t feel it vibrating even if he could clearly hear the ringtone. Although, now that he thought about it, that wasn’t his ringtone. That was Steve’s ringtone. Who the hell was calling Steve at this hour?
“I know sport, but hang in there a little bit more, please. Just let me convince Tony to get out of there, and I promise we’ll go downstairs and I’ll make you a milkshake so you can drink it while I read you a story. How does it sound?” Phil proposed, and he smiled sympathetically when Clint nodded enthusiastically, or at least as enthusiastically as he could, taking into consideration how exhausted he seemed to be feeling. “You’re such a good boy.”
Carelessly, Tony proceeded to soap up his hands and washed them, wondering what Steve would do if he found out Tony hadn’t washed up correctly. Would he let it pass or would he do something about it? Would Steve stand behind him and take his hands in his to show him how he was supposed to wash them? Because that was what parents did when children didn’t do it correctly, wasn’t it? And Steve, unlike Howard, would surely be the kind of father who explained and showed patiently how everything is done. It would be nice to have a father like that, even if it was just pretend.
“Don’t you want to find out why this book caught my attention?” Steve asked while he placed the book on Tony’s lap in a way both of them could see it, looking for the page he had been reading before getting distracted.
“Is… is that the book about that military genius kid who’s training by playing with video games?” Tony recalled. That had been the book Steve had read to him before bed for a few nights. Their dispute happened before Tony got to know how it ended. Perhaps Steve would continue reading it to him if Tony pretended to be really curious about it.
“I’m almost done,” Steve informed, and Tony wished he wouldn’t. It wasn’t really necessary, not when he was well aware of everything that was happening, not when he could perfectly feel how his thighs were gently pushed apart so the diaper could be pulled up and smoothed in place. “All done,” Steve said, patting the side of his now diaper covered bottom. Tony felt like crawling under a rock and die. “Can you look at me, please, sweetpea?” he asked. Tony shook his head in a way Steve could see the motion even if his face was still hidden behind the pillow.
“Be quiet,” Phil asked, his index finger on his mouth gesturing silence. Though Steve couldn’t really think of anything to say to break the silence. He just stood there, next to the doorframe, trying to make sense of what he was watching. “He had a hard time trying to fall asleep,” he commented whispering, his hand stroking Clint’s hair gently.
“You know, couples tend to start acting like each other after some time,” Phil commented, his eyes holding a disapproving look. Steve felt a flush prickled his skin, and he hurried to put in the leg he had already swung out of the window.
Tony hadn’t left the bed during his nap, otherwise JARVIS would have informed him about it – Steve might not stay with Tony while he slept, though he always had JARVIS monitor just in case something bad happened – which meant that Tony was getting more and more comfortable using his diapers, as he didn’t have to stand up anymore to empty his bladder. That was a huge progress. Tony had certainly progressed a lot lately.
This time, Tony did whine, and he would’ve hidden his face behind Raawry if Steve hadn’t stopped him from doing so.
"No?" Steve echoed, a confused look on his face. "Is there something wrong?" Tony shook his head effusively. "Why did you say
That had changed when Steve’s attempts to get Tony into Age Play started. In the couple of times Tony had fallen asleep there during that period, Steve had scooped him off the couch and balanced him on his hip like if Tony was a child. Tony had been more asleep than awake those times so he wasn’t completely sure, but he swore Steve had even bounced him a little before putting him down on the bed.
What the actual hell? How could Tony be frightened if he didn’t even know what he had been dreaming about? It was stupid. After all he had been through, being unnerved because of a dream sounded illogical.
"Tony, if you don't tell me what's wrong, I'm gonna have to call a doctor. Your daddy will kill me if this turns out to be something serious and I didn’t do anything about it,” Phil cautioned, biting his lip to hold back a smile caused by how Tony’s eyes snapped wide open at the mention of the word ‘doctor’. “Then tell me where you have pain?” he insisted. Tony hesitated a little before taking his hand to his throat.
“Don’t worry sweetheart, Clint’s not going to laugh, he’s wearing a diaper too,” Steve whispered in Tony’s ear, stroking his stomach affectionately. Tony let out another sob and pull back up his jeans when Steve tried to pull them down.
“Nothing is broken Tony, but you sure hurt your hand,” Steve informed as he placed the ice on Tony’s hand, making him flinch. “How on earth did you think hitting me was a good idea?” Steve asked as he wrap an arm around Tony’s waist.
“Good job out there, guys. Let’s hit the showers and we’ll meet in an hour in the kitchen for dinner,” Steve said in his commander voice. “Bruce, I know today is your turn to choose the dish, but I’m too tired to cook, so I guess pizza will have to do tonight,” he apologized.
“You see, I told you that you were going to spill it,” Steve said, maybe a bit harsher than he had intended, because even if Clint looked upset when he realized the spilled water had reached his lap, his eyes welled up until Steve uttered that scolding.
“Well, your deduction skills seem to be getting a little bit rusted. If you don’t stop this bullshit once and for all, you will end up hit by a lot of more things. Considered yourself warned,” Tony threatened, folding his arms against his chest, almost pouting.
“I don’t like it!” Clint whined, flopping down on the floor a bit too dramatically, hands still struggling with the straps. Steve sighed deeply, and he decided it was not worth the trouble. Clint wouldn’t be able to unbuckle it and Steve was actually glad of that. The last time he had babysat him, Clint had thought it would be funny to get undressed and run naked all around the living room. Phil hadn’t found that funny at all.
Learn how to play, that was what Tony was resolute to do. How could he be little if he didn’t even know how to play? That day, Clint had looked like he was really having fun with the race cars tracks he began to play with once the movie was over, and somehow, Tony’s mind had started to believe that if Clint could do something, so could he.
“Ted… Ted…” Tony just couldn’t give a straight answer, not when he was evidently trying to stop crying and he just couldn’t. Steve had no idea what he was trying to say.
After taking a deep and steadying breath, Tony crept into the living room and made a beeline for the couch, feeling extremely relieved for having reached it without tripping over. He’d been able to feel Steve’s gaze on him every step of the way, and even though that would’ve made Tony swagger a little bit in other circumstances, right now it was just making him more anxious than he already was.
When Steve removed his hands from Tony’s shoulders and walked past him towards the door, Tony felt an inexplicable lump in his throat, as if a sob was trying to escape from it.
It had been at around midnight when Steve finally managed to undress Tony, give him a scrub down with a wash cloth – there was no way Steve was going to venture to give him a bath, besides the fact that it would have been a very difficult task giving the circumstances, there had been a voice in his head that screamed ‘bad idea!” when he thought about getting Tony near water – put a diaper on him, and settle him down barely enough to try to make him get some sleep.
So, instead of making any changes to the nursery, Steve kept it intact, and he began spending more time there to assuage his remorse of owning a room that was going to waste. It was true that the nursery made him feel very nostalgic, but it also brought a sense of peace and calm he couldn’t describe. Whenever he was stressed out or in a bad mood – which lately seemed to happen pretty often – he would take one of his sketchbooks, go inside that room, settle in the reading corner and start drawing in order to ease his mind, imagining he was just there to kill time while Tony napped in his crib. Some other times he only hung out there, or tidied the room up, or even spent the night there sporadically, when Tony was going to be away.
“Aren’t you hungry, baby?” Steve asked so close to his ear that Tony couldn’t help shuddering slightly. Tony shook his head as his fingers curled harder into the fabric of Steve’s t-shirt, just in case the latter decided to stand up despite Tony’s negation. “That’s not possible. I’m sure you didn’t have anything for lunch, you must be hungry,” he claimed, his embraced tightening.
So, if Clint dealt with stress by pretending he was a kid, it was alright for Steve. Because that had been exactly how it had felt cradling Clint in his arms, alright.
Anyway, thank you for your comments and kudos, it makes me very happy to know there are people out there who enjoy reading this. ♥
“Only when I make sure it’s not really necessary,” Steve conceded, making Clint’s eyes snapped open as he was clearly not expecting him to agree to such request.
"I’m touched by your concern, but don’t worry, I won't die of starvation." Steve chuckled as he sat down on the floor in front of the door. Tony glared at him.
Before Steve got the chance to finish that sentence, an illegible thud interrupted him. He turned his head around looking for Clint right away, noises caused by him were never a good sign, and his suspicions increased when his eyes met Clint’s. They were teary. Steve stood with Tony in his arms and approached the kitchen island, leaning out to see what was on the other side of it. How on earth had Clint managed to end up with the rest of the pizza on his feet? Steve had no clue.
If Tony had felt happy about seeing Steve again after a week, that smile reminded him why he shouldn’t be glad of his return. Why he was mad at him. Why he didn’t want to be in the same room with him right now.
A sob coming from the other side of the kitchen island stopped Steve from going to look for him somewhere else. Steve walked around it and his eyebrows furrowed in confusion when he saw Clint sitting on the floor with the jar of cookies that Steve had hidden in the highest spot of the cabinets in front of him. Sometimes it was very easy to forget that Clint wasn’t a real toddler and he could reach for and find things very easily. But if Clint had found what he wanted, why was he crying?
"What’s the matter sweetheart? Didn't you like the toys Daddy picked up for you?" Steve questioned, pushing a rubber duck closer to him. Tony stared at it, not really knowing what to answer.
A nightmare. Of course there had to be a nightmare. Of course the only way to finish a crappy day was by having a nightmare. Of course he had to have a nightmare on that particular day, where he was feeling awfully and involuntarily Little. Of course he was 'lucky' that way.
And if Steve also added the other details he had observed, everything turned even weirder. Like Tony's sudden interest in what Steve read or ate, whether he was taking a shower or a bath, where he was heading whenever he left the room where they both were, and so on. Tony had never verbalized any interest in what Steve did. With that Steve didn’t mean Tony pay no attention to him, quite the opposite actually, Steve was sure Tony knew even the things Steve wasn’t aware of himself. Although Tony’s mind was always too busy dealing with the thousands of thoughts that occurred to him that Steve was used to put up with a bit of disregard every now and then.
Could Steve be in the kitchen? Maybe he had gotten hungry and had gone to fix himself a sandwich of something, or a bottle for him. Should he go and look for Steve, or should he stay on the bed and wait for him to return? Tony stared at the door for several minutes, and couldn’t help feeling a bit mortified. What was the matter with him? Why couldn’t he make up his mind whether to leave the room or not? The kitchen was just some feet away, he could perfectly get out of the bed and walk there.
At the begining I thought going straight to diapers and bottles would be too rushed, but then I figured Steve had been wanting this for a while, and he certainly wants Tony to be a baby, not a toddler, so, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't hesitate to go for what he wants. And Tony being OK with that? Well, if Steve had asked for his opinion, Tony might not have agreed to diapers and bottles just out of shame, but besides the fact that he does want to please Steve, deep down he enjoys those things too. It would take him a little while to figure that out, though.
Phil had taken a look at Tony's throat and nothing seemed wrong with it, though the fever indicated an infection could develop, so Phil figured it was better to have Tony rest as much as possible. Persuading Tony to stay in bed wasn't easy, especially when Clint kept insisting on going downstairs to get the unfinished book Phil had promised to read him. Tony had make it clear that he was willing to go with them, just an excuse for not remaining lie down. In the middle of the argument, JARVIS offered to get a digital version of it and transferred it to his phone, and Phil could have kissed him for doing that if it had been possible. Phil was able to keep both Clint and Tony entertained with the story for some time, until Tony’s fever got worse.
Concerned, Phil stood by the door trying to decide what to do next. Experience indicated him he should pretend that what had just happened lacked importance at the same time he was comforting, though Phil wasn’t sure Tony would allow that. In his adult mindset, Tony always gave the impression that he was the kind of person who liked to deal with things on his own, and disliked when someone seemed to meddle. Phil wasn’t sure how much of that trait remained in Tony now that he was clearly in a different mindset.
Without further delay, he kneeled down in front of Clint and pull him carefully into a hug. The least he wanted was to cause him more pain. Clint resisted for a moment before throwing his arms around Steve, hiding his face in the crook of his neck, choking back sobs.
There was no way he was going to leave this floor until Steve made sure he had something in his stomach and at least five hours of sleep. Maybe Tony should take advantage of this and rest. He hated to admit it, but he obviously needed it. Even if he achieved to escape and go back to his workshop, he wouldn’t be able to finish what he was working on, and it was rather frustrating that he couldn’t have been able to remember what that was yet.
Tony might not have fussed about wearing diapers, using them, on the other hand, was a totally different story. First of all, his play dates never last too much, they began late in the evening and everything went back to normal by the following morning, so Tony didn’t spend too much time diapered. And if Tony needed to empty his bladder, he would inform Steve so he took the diaper off and Tony could pee in the toilet, ignoring any comment Steve said about how perfectly okay it was to use the diapers the way they were meant to. Steve remained positive anyway, at least Tony didn't remove it by himself without telling him.
The following days were awful. Tony had been taken out of his Little mindset all of a sudden, which made him cranky. On top of that, somebody had seen him, somebody had discovered his most embarrassing secret, which made him much crankier. He must have pissed someone up there, because it was just very bad luck that that somebody had been Steve. Of all the people, why had it had to be Steve? Even if they had been smoothing things over between them for the sake of the team, Tony was sure they would never really stand each other, and Steve’s recent friendliness was just a façade.
Steve squinted his eyes at Tony, then he remembered Tony couldn’t see him. “You weren’t signing anything when I went for you, you were working on your suit,” he accused.
Carefully, to avoid startling Tony, Steve pushed the door open and he felt his heart fill with sorrow at the sight in front of him. Tony was curled up into a small ball on the floor right in the middle of the room, face hidden and body shaking with every choked sob that he was clearly trying to hold back but managed to escape his lips anyway. He looked so fragile, so vulnerable, that it made Steve ached even more badly than he already was.
“How could I leave knowing my baby boy needs me?” Steve interrupted him, “No, I couldn’t do that. I’ll explain Phil later what happened, but right now I’m going to help you change into something more comfortable and we’re going to bed. You need to sleep,” he said, causing Tony to blush. He didn’t have to be a genius to know what kind of clothes Steve considered comfortable in a situation like this one.
Kids weren’t supposed to build things that impeccable. Yes, there were kids that were bright and perfectionist, and they could surely construct something similar to what Tony just had, but there was also the fact that Tony hadn’t exactly have fun while doing it. He had gotten engrossed in the task and had managed to entertain himself for a few hours, but that wasn’t the same as having fun. And that was the whole point of playing, wasn’t it? To have fun. That was why kids played. If a game or a toy weren’t fun, they just didn’t play with them.
“No!” Clint refused from the floor where he was lying on face down. “You lied! You promised me chocolate chips cookies!”
“That you should give him some space if he doesn’t want to be around you.” Okay, Steve had heard correctly.
Steve proceeded to remove Clint's diaper, or that was what the sound of the tabs being unfasten informed Tony, because he wasn’t really looking. Steve had spread his changing mat on the floor next to the sofa where he was currently seated on, but his eyes were fixed on the TV. If he couldn’t stop hiding behind a pillow when he was being diapered, looking someone else during the same process was kind of weird. Besides, Tony didn’t want to exchange glances with Steve. He was mad at him for pushing him away even if Tony had made clear with his whines that he didn’t want to be detached from him.
Tony’s flush deepened as he wiggled his hips. That was all Steve needed to understand what the problem was.
That was the problem. Tony had no idea what he wanted to do exactly. He didn’t even know what age he would pretend to be. A kid didn’t seem like the right fit for him, though he felt a bit uneasy when he imagined himself as a baby. Perhaps a toddler like Clint?
Yes, if Tony hadn’t seen that morning scene, he would undoubtedly come to think his jealousy was the kind one experienced when it was suspected one’s boyfriend might be romantically involved with someone else. But that wasn't Tony's case.
night – Tony would never change that habit of his of locking himself in his workshop for days in a row – but he did try to come upstairs at least a couple of days a week.
Confusion took over Steve, taken aback by Clint’s reaction, his brain unable to process what was going on. That wasn’t the first time he had hit Clint during a training session, and it was certainly not the hardest kick he had ever delivered either, so Clint’s sobbing made no sense.
But, of all the possible scenarios Steve could have encountered when going into Clint’s living room, the one that appeared in front of his eyes was one he would have never imagined.
After hesitating for a moment, Steve bridged the distance between them with quiet light steps. He considered making his presence known first, but ended up deciding against it. What if Tony bolted as he had earlier? Besides the fact that Steve was in no condition to chase him all around the tower, he didn’t want to wait any longer to settle this. Tony needed to be consoled, and then, they needed to have a very serious conversation.
“Give me a good reason why you don’t want to answer. That’s all I’m asking Tony. Give me that and you will be able to go then,” Steve reasoned, trying remain calmed.
“Jeez, you take me by surprise,” Steve expressed as he rubbed the back of his neck, “I won’t deny I’ve done those things, but it’s not like I’ve forced him or anything, they just happened. And he’s never seemed to mind, to be honest,” he excused himself, and he truly thought so.
Without losing any time, Phil’s mind began to think about the places Clint liked to use as hideouts, though he got distracted by a sudden noise which echoed down the hallway. The noise was so familiar, and yet, Phil’s brain didn’t seem to be able to identify it. It sounded like…
"Thirsty," Tony hurried to lie. If Steve thought he was thirsty, he would go and get him some water and Tony would have more time to come to terms with the fact that he had just wet himself.
“No, and with that endless list I assure you I won’t be watching any movie twice, at least not any time soon,” Steve emphasized. He took one more gaze at Tony before fixing his eyes on the screen again, something Tony was grateful for.
“Well, I don’t have my cell phone anymore. Are you ready to put aside your book and pay attention to me?” Tony asked a bit crankily.
Kneeling down gracefully, Steve leaned over enough to be able to kiss his baby on the temple as he placed a hand on his tummy. Tony scrunched up his face a bit before slowly slitting his eyes open, blinking several times and yawning as he slowly came to his senses.
“Oh, sorry baby, daddy got a little distracted,” Steve apologized after pressing a kiss to his forehead. “You’re such a good boy, you almost finished all your salad!” he praised, making Tony blush, “one more bite, and you can eat pizza, how about that? You want pizza, don’t you?” Tony nodded slightly, “Of course you do, you little –”
“Everything is okay Agent, but I’m afraid Sir’s in need of your assistance,” JARVIS said, and Phil could bet there was certain concern in the A.I.’s voice even if that wasn’t technically possible.
“That’s it! I’m out of here! I have better things to do than sitting down and playing this stupid staring contest with you!” Tony exclaimed as he stood up, walking with determination toward the door. “Move!”
“Ha, ha, ha.” Tony faked a laugh, throwing a pillow to Steve’s face, but the latter caught it before it hit him. Damn super soldier reflexes.
Tony couldn't help rolling his eyes. Steve was always doing research, he took it very seriously when someone recommended him to see or listen to something that would help him catch up with the twentieth century. If his memory served him right, Tony could even swear Steve had needed another notepad to write down every recommendation.
Tony would never be able to explore his little side like Clint did if he continued with that behavior. Because, contrary to what Tony believed, Steve was sure Tony could achieve that little mindset too. If Tony didn’t slip into it may be due to unwillingness or lack of knowledge of how to do it, Steve couldn’t really tell. The only thing Steve was sure of was that, as long as Tony continued getting practically inert as a result of his embarrassment, he wouldn’t enjoy their play dates as he was supposed to.
Tony just wished this whole thing were easy. He just wanted to go with the flow. He wished his father had never found out. He wished he had never been forced to deal with all the psychologists who made him believe this was inappropriate. But apparently nothing was going to be easy for him, never, having an incredible brain and a huge wealth didn’t help him at all this time.
Clint was rubbing his eyes while he yawned, and Phil knew it was only a matter of minutes before he fell asleep. That wouldn’t be so bad, after all, Phil had already intended to send Clint to bed. The thing was, Phil wanted to have some quality time with Clint before he went to sleep, otherwise, the chances of Clint waking up even grumpier would increase. He couldn’t really afford to deal with a fussy toddler when he had already to deal with a fussy baby.
“Oh, don’t worry baby, I don’t mind at all,” Steve reassured. “I wouldn’t trade an afternoon playing with my baby boy for nothing.” He brushed another kiss now over the top of his head.
Clint hesitated a little before standing up and walking towards them, dragging his feet as a way to show how much he disliked being made to do something he didn’t want to. Once he was next to Phil, he flopped down on the floor grumpily and leaned forward as much as he could, surely trying to get as close as possible to the TV without disobeying Phil. Testing boundaries. Phil rolled his eyes, not liking the challenging behavior, but turned the TV on anyway.
Running wouldn’t be a good idea either, besides the fact that Steve was much faster than him, Tony was so tired he would probably end up falling flat on his face. Asking help to one of the others was out of the question too, what would he say? “Please, help me to hide so Steve doesn’t put me on a diaper”? No fucking way.
“Well young man, I wouldn’t have to do it if you took better care of yourself,” Steve alleged, reaching out for Tony’s wrist. The latter shrieked when Steve grabbed him and pulled him towards him, making him fall on his lap.
“Sir has access to everything and everywhere in this tower, there’s no need for him to inform you, Captain, where he goes or doesn’t go,” JARVIS informed, clearly dodging his question.
“Tony, please open up,” Phil asked, holding a thermometer in front of Tony’s face, though it seemed as if Phil had asked the exact opposite, because Tony closed his mouth more tightly. “C’mon buddy, I need to take your temperature, I’m afraid you’re running a fever.” Tony shook his head as he sank further into the bed. “You know how adults need to take little kids’ temperature when they refused to take it orally, don’t you?” he warned, and he would have laughed at Tony’s expression of pure horror if he hadn’t been so worried. “That’s a good boy,” he praised when Tony opened his mouth and allowed him to put the tip of the thermometer under his tongue.
“The water’s getting cold,” Steve announced after he plunged a hand into the bathtub. “Let’s get you out of here or you’re gonna end up getting sick.”
“I guess this means you’ve missed me too,” Steve said, a smile edging his mouth. Tony continued without saying a single word, though he clung to him even more tightly.
Standing in the middle of the remains, Tony surveyed the damage he had wrought. He pulled the hidden catch at his wrist to rid himself of his armor, the pieces clattering to the floor around him. It seemed like too much energy to order JARVIS to send it back to his workshop. Yeah, the nursery was not a nursery anymore. All that was left before him was a pile of useless debris. Regardless of what that little voice was whispering inside his head, Tony didn’t need all those things. He didn’t want them. He had a perfectly normal, luxurious, and comfortable room not far from here, and that was all he needed.
“M’tired, wanna sleep,” Tony announced, rubbing his eyes, as to prove his point, before looking up to give Steve those huge puppy eyes which would make him conquer the world without thinking it twice and gift wrap it for Tony if that was what his baby wanted.
Sorry for taking too long to update. I was kind of busy during Christmas vacation (I really didn't get as many days off as I had planned) and I started the year with too much work.
"Tony..." Steve sighed, without being able to hide the hurt in his voice. "Do you really want me to stop?"
There was no worse thing than having to think being moody, exhausted, sore, hungry and during a battle against his own mind, and just because he couldn’t decide which of his two headspaces should let take over, just because his reason and his desire couldn’t come to an agreement. Half of him wanted to get out of this, while the other half wanted to stand up and snuggle against Steve.
They had been sparring for more than two hours, and even if Clint was in perfect shape, his heavy breathing indicated he was already getting exhausted. Steve, on the other hand, was just starting to warm up. The serum could be considered a big advantage during battles, but it was in situations like these ones when it was also a disadvantage, no one could ever keep up with him.
The first time Tony tried to prevent Steve from pushing him into his Little headspace, he had done something inconceivable. His logic and common sense tended to fail when he was trapped between his adult and Little mindset, and his despair didn’t let him realize that. Tony had had the terrific idea of provoking Bruce to Hulk out to get Steve distracted. In spite of Bruce’s attempts to remain calm, it had worked. Hulk had destroyed many rooms of the Tower, and when he decided the Tower was boring, he had gone outside. Then, the Hulk had destroyed some buildings around the block and terrorized half of the population – fortunately, there hadn’t been any casualties, but still.
Steve’s heart melted when that shy smile appeared one more time on Tony’s face. It showed him how Tony was enjoying this even if he was still struggling with the idea whether this was something he was supposed to enjoy or not.
That caused another sigh, Steve was getting a little bit frustrated. Though he shouldn’t be, not really, Tony refusing to separate from him and to eat wasn’t even close to a worst-case scenario.
In other circumstances, Steve would go back to the living room to find out where Tony had gone to – Tony wasn’t the only one who experienced anxiety due to separation – but not this time. Besides rubbing his eyes and yawning, Tony had also been squirming, so imperceptibly that Steve wouldn't had noticed if he hadn't been paying close attention to him. That squirming told Steve that Tony was heading to the furthest corner of the room now, and he would stand kind of awkwardly there for a moment. Just as he had been doing lately every time he needed to pee.
They had been age-playing for a while now, but Tony wasn’t comfortable with it yet. On the one hand, he did enjoy some things, he wasn’t going to deny that – although that didn’t mean he was going to shout it from the roof tops either. On the other hand, there were some other things Tony loathed, things that got into his nerves in a way nothing had ever done.
It took Tony around twenty minutes to gain consciousness, during which time Steve took advantage to stroke his hair in a reassuring way as he hummed; anything that helped him to prevent a flare-up so early in the morning was good. It apparently worked, because Steve saw a slight smile flicker across Tony’s face before confusion washed over his features.
Up until that point, Tony had thought that that sensation of smallness he began experiencing every time Steve and he age played was what a Little headspace felt like, and even if feeling little was certainly a characteristic of the headspace, on that day, Tony learned it went way beyond that. He wasn’t sure if he was comfortable with everything it entailed.
“B-but I-I wann-na pla-ay with th-that,” Clint said in between sobs, pointing at the bucket Tony kept pressed against his chest, hugging it tightly.
“Look, maybe I went too far a couple of minutes ago, but I don’t give a shit about that, I mean, I’ve never heard anything about age playing, and I do think is kind of odd, but it’s far from the worse thing I know people like to do,” Tony confessed, turning around to see him.
Over time, Steve had gotten to know Tony fairly well, to the point where he could assure he understood how Tony’s mind worked most of the time. Given how things had gone during the battle, there was no doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony would blame himself for what had happened to him; therefore, as soon as Steve regained consciousness, he began scheming how he’d make Tony realized it hadn’t been his fault. It wouldn’t be easy, and Steve could already imagine Tony’s reaction: he would probably refuse to believe him, feel remorseful anyway, hide from him and get mad at him if Steve insisted on contradicting him. Tony pushing Clint the way he had was something Steve would have never envisioned him doing.
“Yes, even if he’s still in his little headspace when he wakes up, I’m pretty sure he’ll snap out of it when he realizes he’s in a hospital,” Phil reassured as he waved Steve off.
Clint’s sobs died out as if by magic. “Pizza?” he questioned, sitting up and looking at the roof as if he was searching for JARVIS.
“No, you know you’re not allowed to leave a floor without an adult.” Phil reminded, turning back his attention to Tony right after the thermometer indicated with a beep that the temperature had been taken. Phil removed it and his mouth tugged into a disapproving frown when he saw the numbers displayed. 101 F, nothing to be too alarmed, but Tony was definitely sick. “You have a fever, kiddo,” he announced, looking down at Tony, “why didn’t you tell me that you weren’t feeling okay?” he questioned.
His eyes lied on Tony, who continued kicking the door stubbornly. Come on, he was to one who built it, he surely knew he wasn’t capable of destroying it with some simple kicks. If stares could kill, he would be already dead, because Tony glared at him when he chuckled after hearing a whimper made his way out of his throat. The door felt even harder when punched.
"So, how do you feel about me knowing?" Steve asked, truly wanting to know the answer. If Clint wanted him to pretend he knew nothing, that would be fine by him. He didn't want to make Clint uncomfortable in any way.
Steve felt fairly relieved when he pulled up Clint’s t-shirt and the area where he had been kicked was just slightly reddened, almost imperceptible. Clint was resilient indeed. The reason why he kept crying could be due to the fact he was feeling little and Phil wasn’t around – if Phil had been, Steve was sure Clint would have told on him to Phil as soon as he kicked him – so Steve stayed right there and waited patiently for him to calm down.
Accepting Steve as a caregiver definitely had its perks. Tony loved being Steve's center of attention, the man could completely shut everything out and just focused on his needs. Tony liked how Steve could sit down with him for hours, playing with his Hot Wheels and Legos like if he was actually having fun too, making awesome noises whenever there was a crash in the toy highway or something destroyed the buildings they had built out of Legos. Tony enjoyed baking with Steve, because he actually let him help, not caring at all if Tony spilled something by accident or got his hands and clothes all dirty with the ingredients. Tony did enjoy being carried or being placed on Steve's lap, it turned out it was very comfortable snuggling against his chest, and his body emanated a very soothing warmth that made Tony feel safe and in peace. Tony was grateful for having someone there to comfort him, instead of telling him to man up, every time he woke up because of a nightmare, strong and firm hands and arms contrasting with the tenderness and kindness of his hugs and caresses.
“Yes, Tony. It was,” Steve remarked as he squeezed Tony’s arm gently. “I won’t let you blame yourself for something that was definitely not your fault.”
His eyes snapped open and his breathing stopped. This wasn’t his bed. This wasn’t any bed. This was the crib he had built no long ago. How the hell did he end up here? Nobody new about this room, about his nursery, the door was hidden somewhere in his closet. And even if somebody find it, JARVIS was the only one who could unlock it, and nobody but Tony was allowed to get inside. Oh, he was so going to disable the A.I.
The problem was Tony couldn’t be with daddy if they weren’t age playing. Steve was the one who usually decided when to have a play date, and Tony just went along with it. Whether that was because Steve tended to choose the moment when Tony was too overtired and overworked to fight back, or because Tony was starting to enjoy it, Tony couldn’t tell yet. The only thing he knew was that it was somehow easier to let Steve make that decision. It was easier for his mind to believe someone else was prompting him to do something he still wasn’t sure he should do or not. He should like or not.
“What?” He repeated the question, a light shade of red showing up on his face when Steve smiled at him, undoubtedly revealing what thoughts were crossing his mind right in that moment.
“Not talking about anyone or anything anymore,” Tony said as he tried to stand up, but Steve pulled him down.
“I don’t know you, but I think you’ve been a pretty good and brave boy today,” Steve praised. He felt tempted to bend over and pick his baby up in order to give him some well-deserved cuddles, but he opened his arms instead. Tony went a little dazed by that action at first, though, in a matter of seconds, Steve had him curled again his chest. “I think you’ve earned a prize for being so well-behaved. What about if we have pizza for lunch? We can make if from scratch. You can help Daddy mix the dough.”
Well, what I tried with this chapter (counting the last two, because I planned them to be just one chapter, but then it got longer than I thought so I ended up splitting it) is to show that Tony is not the only one who's gotta get used to it, Steve too. He might have all that fatherly love whitin him, but taking care or littles can be tough regardless of how attached you feel to them :p.
"That's what I've been fucking telling you all this time! It's obvious the serum didn't improve your understanding ability!" Tony exclaimed before pushing Steve away from him. Steve let it happen.
“And I told you not to tell anyone,” Clint said, kicking him in the leg with his bare foot from the other side of the couch.
What time was it? He stared at the window while trying to figure out why there wasn’t any light outside when just some minutes ago there was daylight. Oh yeah, keeping track of the time wasn’t one of his skills when he was working himself until exhaustion.
“Yeah, because everybody goes around kicking doors, breaking windows and running away from the table.” Steve let himself chuckle this time.
"Come on, sweetheart, open up," Steve pleaded, moving closer the fork he was holding up in front of Tony's face. Tony shook his head, and hid his face against Steve’s chest. "They're chicken nuggets, you like chicken nuggets, don't you?" Tony shook his head once more, lying.
That was weird indeed. Tony didn't cry often, not even when he was Little. He could get clingy, moody, fussy, even playful, but not teary. Not really. Maybe after a spanking he kind of did, but hey, it was a spanking. Steve asked him one more time what had happened, becoming more worried when his Little sobbed a tiny bit louder this time.
Leaving behind everything related to Age Play turned out to be more difficult than expected. Tony had thought that once he had made up his mind, things would gradually get back to normal, and the only thing he would have to deal with would be Steve’s reluctance to stop. Everything had been Steve’s idea after all, and even if Tony had come to like it, age playing wasn’t something indispensable for him. He didn’t need to be fed, bathed, comforted, put to bed or looked after, and he certainly didn’t need to wear diapers, suck on a pacifier, drink from a bottle or hug a stuffed animal.
Steve raised a confused eyebrow, “No, sweetheart, you’ve only chosen two, and Daddy said three,” he explained. If Tony thought he could get out of this by feigning obliviousness, he had another thing coming.
"Aha!" Tony exclaimed when he found his tablet. "Under the bed? Really? Really?" He said to no one, shocked by where Steve had left his tablet. Tony was already visualizing the conversation he would have with Steve to complain about how careless he had been with his things, when he remembered why it had ended there. A couple of days ago, it had been a pretty wild night. A dork smile appeared on Tony’s face as he remembered it. Well, Tony would let it pass just this time.
Anyway, I went to Comicx some days ago (a restaurant with a comic-book theme) and I just was so happy eating in a place like that (I had Ironman and Dummy behind me XD) and I just felt like writing again.
“Wait for me here, buddy,” Phil ordered as he pushed Clint gently to the bed until he sat down on it. A huge pout appeared on Clint's face, but Phil couldn't sense any intention of disobeying.
The chest toys, the reading corner as well as the changing table were still there, but now there was a crib instead of a bed – with a dinosaur mobile over it –  a teddy bear bigger than him next to it, a playpen in lieu of the foam mat and a highchair in the middle of the room which Steve planned on taking to the kitchen only when Tony used it. Steve had even purchased a car-shape bed for Clint, just in case it was necessary to babysit him.
When Steve removed the towel and made him lay down, Tony felt the blood rushing to his cheeks. It was stupid, Steve had seen him naked hundreds of times, Tony was even sure Steve knew some parts of his body better than himself, so he couldn’t understand why he was feeling this embarrassed. Even so, Tony groped for a pillow and buried his face into it as soon as he found it. He just couldn’t face Steve right now, not when he was busy unfolding the diaper that he would soon put on him.
His breath hitched on a sob, and Tony reached for daddy’s pillow, pressed his face into it and curled into a little ball before he began crying freely, JARVIS’ reassurances going almost unnoticed.
Carefully, Steve pushed him back to the bed, pulling the covers up once Tony’s was lying down. “Try to go back to sleep,” Steve suggested, leaning over to press a kiss on his forehead before getting up from the bed, leaving Tony with a strange but somehow comforting tingling feeling in his stomach.
“Yes, you do. He’s very open-minded, I think he’ll give it a try at least if you ask,” Phil commented when Steve failed to say anything, ruffling Clint’s hair, making him whine.
Tony irrationally wanted daddy to hug him right now, to comfort him, to help him get rid of that annoying fear and anxiety which refused to leave him alone. He didn’t want Steve to stay, but he wanted daddy to stay. That didn’t make any sense, what the hell was wrong with him?
“Bathroom,” Clint said, and that word was all Steve needed to become completely awake. Clint jumped from site to site, hands struggling to unfasten the overalls. Tony whined when Steve sat up to reach for Clint, and Steve had to pushed his hands away because Tony pulled his sleeves, as an attempt to get him to continue hugging him.
It was very likely that Clint was somehow taking advantage of the situation, and even if Steve knew he should do something about it, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Besides the fact that Steve didn’t want to risk driving Clint away, after his conversation with Phil earlier that day, he felt a bit guilty for not even realizing how he had been making Clint uncomfortable. And the worse part was that Steve would have never become aware of the way he was treating Clint if Phil hadn’t pointed it out.
Needless to say, Steve never backed away in this situations, and Tony should have known this better than anybody else. He was about to turn around again to avoid his gaze, when he felt an arm being put around his waist and lift him with no effort at all. A whimper escaped from his mouth unintentionally, and before he could hold to anything, the blond man had already set him up on his shoulder, giving him a clear view of his rear, his hand kept firmly around his waist to prevent him from moving or falling.
“What you and Clint do, but you and me,” Tony blurted, eyes fixed on the floor like if it was the most marvelous thing he had ever seen. He didn’t want to see Steve’s reaction. Any sign Steve showed, no matter how insignificant it was, that he wasn’t willing to try Age Play out anymore was going to increased his embarrassment greatly.
“I told you not to watch the TV so closely,” Phil scolded, “come and sit down over here, or I’m not turning it on again,” he warned, his voice serious.
Steve was a dead man, he had gone too far. Tony was going to suit up and beat the hell out of him. Literally. He would break his shield into pieces and then he would punch him, kick him, shot him, and everything that was necessary to finish him.
There was a part of him, his naïve side, that made him believe the more time he spent time in the nursery, the highest the possibility there would be that, one day, Tony would have no other choice but to go inside, looking for him, and that somehow the room would cause him the same feeling of longing and harmony it caused to Steve, provoking him rethink things. And maybe, just maybe, Tony would change his mind.
“That’s not what I meant, JARVIS, and you know it,” Steve argued. Even though JARVIS had told on Tony a few times before, it didn’t mean the A.I. did it all the time. There was certain information Tony forbade to share no matter what, and Steve was afraid this fell into that category. “Has Tony been sleeping in this room? In the crib?”
Every time Tony fell asleep in the workshop at night, and he was extremely tired to complain, Steve took him to their bedroom. At the beginning of their relationship, Steve woke him up and walk him to the room, Tony’s arm slung around Steve’s shoulder while Steve’s arm surrounded his waist so he could support half of his weight. Then, when their relationship became more stable, Steve began carrying him bridal style, which Tony didn’t quite like, but he couldn’t deny that was better than having to walk when the only thing he wanted to do was going back to sleep so he could wake up early the next day and continue working on whatever it was that had kept him awake for several days.
“Well, it’s your choice kiddo, no mac and cheese, no cookies.” Phil gave him an ultimatum before eating a couple of bites of his own lunch.
“I don’t have an expression for that!” Steve defended himself. He might be dying to stretch out his arms and pull Tony into a hug, but he did not have a face for that.
“Bathroom,” Tony said with a tiny voice. Even if the lights were off, Steve would tell Tony was getting embarrassed again by the way his hands were fidgeting under the covers.
"Are you sure?" he questioned, just in case. His baby's blush intensified slightly as he nodded almost imperceptibly. "Okay. But remember, if you stop feeling comfortable, you can always change, Daddy wouldn’t mind, okay, baby?" Tony nodded once more.
Tony sighed in relief, he didn’t feel comfortable lying to Steve, especially when he was feeling little, but it was kind of necessary right now. Unfortunately, Tony didn’t remember that things never turned out as he expected, and when he was leaning forward to get back to bed, Steve moved closer to him and hefted him up with ease.
“You were taking forever,” Steve justified himself as he adjusted his clothes nervously. His worry might have altered his perception of time, though he decided to keep that information to himself. Phil bridged the distance between them and closed the window.
It was not surprising that Tony got hooked by the story, up to the point of asking Steve to keep reading way pass the chapter he was initially going to read. Tony even got angry when Steve proposed stopping to get to sleep, so he continued reading it several minutes after Tony’s breathing evened out and went completely limp, asleep.
Tony grunted loudly as he collapsed onto the couch. It was no use. No matter how much he had tried, Steve just didn’t get it.
“I guess not,” Tony hesitated as he squinted at him, not completely convinced of what Steve had said.
However, Tony was still determined to please Steve by giving a try to whatever he proposed. Therefore, Tony ended up drinking from it, being internally thankful that, at least, Steve hadn’t gotten him a bottle.
“OK, pasta it is. Yeah, I’m in a mood for pasta” Yeah, monologues were very common when Tony started to have arguments with his creations.
And why were they piling up the boxes? Well, they were just not going to throw them away. Steve was a recycling freak. He recycled
It must have been a fluke, another way life found to mess up with his head, because it seemed illogical to think a crib could keep the nightmares away when nothing and nobody else had, not even Steve’s presence had managed to do that, at least not entirely. Chances were that Tony wouldn’t have dreamed that night regardless of where he had slept, perhaps the alcohol had prevented his brain to create bad dreams, or maybe he’d slept too deeply to be able to dream at all. Everything had been a random and unlucky turn of events, a cruel joke of destiny, and Tony was going to prove that to himself. He was going to sleep in the freaking crib once more, he was
Steve pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head before getting off the couch, tilting his chin to the kitchen when Tony turned to look at him questionably. Tony opened his mouth as if to protest, but after a few seconds of obvious internal struggle, he fixed his eyes again on the screen in front of them and said nothing. That surprised Steve a little, even if he wasn’t going to go far or for long, Tony had shown reluctance to separate from him during a play date. However, Steve got the feeling he knew the reason of Tony’s behavior, so he decided not to brood over that and made a beeline to the kitchen.
After being finally able to put on some clothes on Clint, Phil dragged him back to the nursery, only to find out that Tony had lost control of his bladder once more, and this time it took Phil almost an hour to coax him out of under the bed.
Hum, I tried to update sooner, though my working hours increased and I just find it hard to get around to writing. And on weekends I'm so fed up I literally want to do nothing.
“Then, what’s the problem?” Steve questioned. Shyly, Tony looked back at him, brown big eyes imploring him to stop prying. A shame that wasn’t going to happen. “Tony, we can’t continue like this, so I’m gonna ask you something, and I want you to give me an honest answer, please,” he warned, a note of firmness in his voice. “Do you want me to be your daddy again?” Tony remained silent, this time holding Steve’s eyes instead of looking away, still silently imploring to give it a rest. “You know, I wouldn’t mind at all. I’d love to, actually. I don’t know about you, but I really, really miss my baby.”
In a universe where everything worked out the way Tony wanted, Steve would have approached him to pull him off the chair and made him sit down on his lap. Tony would have stayed there happily and allowed Steve feed him with some of his salad, even if he really didn’t like the taste of steamed vegetables.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you JARVIS, I don’t think Tony wants to get the glass replaced for the sixth time” Again, Captain America never backed away when he wanted something, especially when that something was making him leave the workshop. Tony hadn’t found a glass resilient enough to take one of the cap’s hit with his shield.
“Hey, hey, take it easy Tony, it’s okay,” Steve soothed, voice a little shocked, embrace tightening.
“Hey, there,” Steve greeted when two half-lidded brown eyes peeked back at him. Tony blinked sleepily a few times before closing his eyes again, making Steve chuckle. For someone who was always so reluctant to go to sleep, Tony sure had a hard time waking up.
For a couple of days, Tony avoided Steve, turning to his favorite way of escape: hiding in his workshop and claiming he had too much work to do. Steve let him be, but this morning he had cornered Tony when he had gone upstairs to get some coffee, and Tony was unable to make a getaway – not for the lack of trying, of course.
“Have you ever wondered why all the pop-up ads seem to show you just things that you could really be interested in?” Tony questioned, head still lowered, but his eyes finally looking up at him.
So, Steve kept doing all this little things and Tony kept lying to himself, playing oblivious and secretly enjoying them. It wasn’t until Steve placed a sippy cup in front of him, one day when they were alone during breakfast, that Tony lost it. As Steve turned around to approach the counter and fetch the other plates, he felt something hitting the back of his head, followed by the sensation of a liquid wetting his back.
“Can you look at me sweetheart?” Steve asked once he was done, and couldn’t help feeling a bit shocked when it only take Tony a couple of minutes to peek over the teddy. "C'mere, daddy's gonna help you get back to sleep," he said, arms wide open.
“I won’t!” Clint repeated cheerfully, reaching for the glass in such a hasty way that it swung hazardously for a few seconds before Clint could steady it. Steve squinted his eyes at him at the same time he crossed his arms over his chest, but he his exasperation faded considerably when Clint gave him a puppy-dog look.
“What?” Steve asked confused, surprised to see Clint on the floor. Was he really that exhausted, or was that just a trick? “Let’s call it a day,” he proposed, remaining alert in case Clint decided it was still too soon to stop.
“I’m sorry baby, but I can’t let you go to bed with an empty stomach, you have to eat something,” Steve apologized.
And for a thousandth second, Steve was sure he had gotten into Tony. But the moment was so brief, so fleeting, he later doubted it even happened.
But what if Steve was right and Tony was feeling ‘little’ for real? He had read everything there was about headspaces on the Internet, though he didn't pretend to know what a little headspace was like. Perhaps he was starting to feel ‘little’ without realizing it. That would certainly explain the meltdown he had just had, the unfounded fear he had experienced and the tremendous need of having Steve around. That would certainly give sense to everything.
"Kiddo, are you ever going to let yourself go without doing all these things?" He used the word "things" in order to avoid saying "tantrums.". He didn't want to distress him more. "Why didn't you come and look for me if you were feeling like this? I've asked you many times to come and look for me when you feel like doing something this... extreme.".
“But I’m telling you I don’t want to. I changed my mind. Let go of me!” Tony mentally cursed the serum, why did Steve have to be so strong? Tony couldn’t even move an inch away from him, especially now that Steve had put the diaper aside with the intention of using both hands to handle him.
“Tony?” Phil called. He stood very close to the door but he didn't open it, afraid that only caused another attempt to escape from Tony.  "Tony, are you okay?" he asked, receiving no answer. He pressed his ear against the door, and the only thing he could hear was Tony's heavy breathing, so uneven that there was no doubt he was trying not to cry, but he was failing miserably. “Tony, please, answer to me, I just wanna know if you're okay,” he insisted.
Day in day out, Tony sneaked out in his own house. He spent no time in the communal rooms, he hid all day in his workshop, and the time the Avengers were assembled to deal with some robots that wanted to destroy the city, he made sure to leave as soon as the problem was taken care of in order to avoid running into Steve. Yes, more of his not-so-mature behavior, but it was better than the alternative. And of course Steve had been looking for him, wanting to talk to him. JARVIS had informed Tony a lot of times that the captain tried to get in touch, but Tony wouldn’t do it. He didn’t want to do it. He couldn’t do it.
It was time to look for another exit, Tony decided, kicking and hitting the door clearly wasn’t working. Damn Steve for dragging him all of a sudden, he hadn’t been able to take his Iron Man remote, otherwise he would have destroyed the door very easily. He looked around and cursed himself for not having any other exit built, but how would he have known that he would end up being locked in here. Not even in his craziest dreams he’d imagine this situation happening. But good thing he was a genius, he just had to focus on finding another route of escape. A shame that his concentration was failing amazingly for the last previous hours.
“I’m warning you, Jarvis, you’re not gonna like to be the answering machine of the Avenger’s phone line.”
Against all the odds, Tony had slipped into his little headspace while Steve was away, and to make things worse, he had been sick too. When Steve arrived home, on the following day, he had been surprised to find Phil in the playroom diapering Tony – or trying to do it, because Tony had been squirming and pushing him away so badly that Phil hadn’t been really achieving it. As soon as Tony spotted him, he ran towards him, threw himself into his arms, and he hadn’t let go for the next three days. Literally. He would cry if Steve got away from him for more than a couple of minutes.
“So, are we good then? Are you sure you wanna be my sweet little baby again?” Steve wanted to verify before he moved the conversation to what hopefully would be the last part. Weariness was slowly crawling up on him and he would much like to catnap before he had to go find Bruce so he could check his injuries; besides, the signs that Tony was slipping deeper into his headspace were becoming more obvious, and Steve had no desire of delaying his much-needed Little time any longer.
In less than a few minutes, Steve was already lifting Tony’s hips to slide the diaper under his butt and pulling it up to smooth the straps into place after a quick dusting of baby powder between his thighs. He smiled at the pattern of the diaper, baby dinosaurs, and wonder which of them would disappear once Tony made use of it.
“No,” Tony said, though he was dying to say the opposite. It was never a good idea to call someone who was on a mission, as that could literally get him or her killed. Besides, chances were that Steve didn’t even have his phone with him. “When did he say he’s coming back?”
Toddling slightly more resolute than before, Tony moved to the other side of the room, right where the crib was. Unfortunately, before Steve could get excited over the fact that that particular piece of furniture was a must-keep item, Tony stood on his toes and leaned over the railing to be able to clasp his hand around Raawry’s tail. Of course that stuffed dinosaur would be one of the selected objects. Regardless of how much he denied it, Tony found that plush toy very comforting.
Tony sat down on the floor, glaring at Steve, who just look back at him, kind of smiling. Why on earth had he agreed to do this? What had he been thinking? How the hell had Steve managed to convince him into doing such a thing? The captain might not be as good as him at talking people into doing whatever he wanted, but Steve sure had some aces up on his sleeve too. Although, even if Tony didn’t want to acknowledge it, Steve might not have gotten him to do anything, Tony might have agreed willingly.
Tony would have liked to explain him that hadn’t been the issue, but Steve had pulled him into a hug right after, and Tony couldn’t help to melt into his body. Steve’s touch had always had the power to calm him down almost immediately. Maybe later Tony would confess Steve he didn’t know how to play.
And Steve had given Tony that look just because Tony had taken his thumb to his mouth unconsciously, intending to suck it. How could Steve have even noticed? It had been a hesitancy that lasted just a millisecond, almost imperceptible for the human eye! Tony had to think about something fast, something that would excuse him as soon as they reach the Tower. An excuse, a lie, a blackmail, a threat, anything. He still had more than ten minutes before landing. Ten minutes where he would be saved, since Steve would never try to do anything in front of everybody.
Steve sighed deeply, and he hoped Clint didn’t burn down the kitchen while being there. There was a reason why Phil never took his eyes off of him, when Clint was little, he tended to be more mischievous than normal. Once, Steve had put him down for a nap, or at least he had thought he had done that, because twenty minutes later when Steve had gone to his room to check on him, he had found Clint sitting on the floor in front of the wall, painting on it with some crayons.
“Tony… Tony… hey, wake up.” Tony came to reality slowly as he felt a hand on his shoulder, shaking it carefully.
Yes, that sounded very unlike Steve, since he was the only one in the Tower who usually tried to respect everyone in all possible ways – privacy included – but Clint was the one whom Steve usually hung out with when he didn’t feel like being alone and Tony refused to leave the workshop – something that happened too frequently to Steve’s liking – and Steve had gotten used to just making himself at home in Clint’s floor without any invitation.
When Steve was finally able to soothe Clint enough to stop calling for his daddy, Clint refused to be changed on the changing table. Steve had to go and retrieve the changing mat to avoid Clint getting more upset than he already was, and convincing him to wear another diaper wasn’t easy either. Steve had to promise to give him a complete box of cookies, and not put back on the overalls – Steve couldn’t refute that, if Clint hadn’t been wearing them, he might have been able to make it to the bathroom.
“Where do you think you’re going?” Steve asked, catching Tony by the ankle as a measure to prevent another escape attempt. Tony shook his leg a few times to try to release it from Steve’s hand, but the grasp was firm and steady and wouldn’t allow it to happen.
Without knowing what to do, Tony started to hyperventilate, too deep in his Little headspace to be able to come up with a clever excuse to get away with the situation without having to explain anything. He couldn’t quite make out Steve’s expression, since he was either laughing or frowning like Tony expected him to do. Nothing. Steve just stood there, wearing a blank expression – slight curiosity, at the most. That made Tony feel even much uneasier.
“Yeah?” Steve expressed, not knowing what else to say as he didn’t know where this conversation was going.
At the beginning, Tony doubted he would be able to get into such a state of mind, but the more Steve and he age played, the more Tony wondered if he was already slipping into a ‘little headspace’ without realizing it. There were certain clues that made Tony believe that, like the fact he felt inexplicably small when Steve began using terms of endearment and baby talk; or he didn’t feel like talking and preferred to use signs and gestures to communicate; or that he was more than okay with letting Steve do most things for him when he usually preferred to be self-sufficient. Also, there was the fact that Tony experienced an inexplicable uneasiness when he woke up and Steve was nowhere to be seen.
Steve wasn’t going to deny there was a small part of him that was thrilled to find Tony in this particular room, but it was also true that he would’ve liked this to happen under very different circumstances.
“I’m okay!” Clint yell from the kitchen. Steve should have gone with him to make sure he didn’t do anything naughty, but if he stood up, Tony would latch to him again and it had been very difficult to coax him into letting go enough to try to feed him. Something that wasn’t going very well either. “Come on baby, I know you’re hungry, your tummy is rumbling.” Steve returned his attention to Tony, pressing the nugget stabbed with the fork against Tony’s corner of his lips. Tony shook his head one more time. “You need to eat something, sweetheart,” he insisted.
Board games were the first toys Tony set aside. The instructions said it was possible to play by oneself, though most of them did recommend two or more players. Tony didn’t see the point on trying to play with them if he didn’t have anyone to play with. Video game consoles were pretty much the same. So, the first thing Tony tried were the RC toys, and even if he couldn’t deny they were quite entertaining, playing with them felt pretty similar to what he already did with his own robots. One car even got Dum-E’s ‘dunce cap’ because it kept crashing into everything even if Tony moved the joystick of the remote control towards a different direction.
Tony didn't want that to happen. He understood why Steve would do that, but he didn't want him to anyway. He wanted Steve to stay and look after him the way he looked after Clint. He wanted Steve to realize once and for all how much he craved for that kind of attention. It was selfish and unreasonable, Tony wasn’t going to deny that. Clint was Steve’s friend, as well as his, and he needed Steve. They were not going to do anything bad, so there was no valid reason for Tony to want to stop Steve from going downstairs to Clint’s floor.
Anxiously, Tony looked around, trying to identify the place where he currently was. He couldn’t remember falling asleep, which meant exhaustion had been the one to blame for his loss of consciousness. When that happened, Tony could find himself anywhere – he wasn’t that twenty-year old young man who could stay awake for days in a row without repercussions. Now his body seemed to switch off out of the blue when all his energy had been burned out. Once, Tony had woken up in the shower where he had apparently fallen asleep before he had the chance to take a shower; Steve had scolded him endlessly when he found him. Thankfully, that didn’t seem to be the case this time. Tony was happy to find out he was on the sofa in his workshop.
After lunch, they moved back to the nursery. Now that his baby was a bit more relaxed and with a full tummy, choosing what else he wanted to keep didn’t take as much time as it had before. He still complained when Steve informed him he had to pick four items now, but he hadn’t tried to get out of the task. The bookshelf, the changing table, the playpen and the mobile (okay, the last one had been a little tricky as it could have easily been taken as a part of the crib, but Steve had decided to let it slip) were the things Tony ended up selecting.
“You should tell him,” Phil said out of the blue. Or maybe he had been talking about something in particular and Steve had been the one who hadn’t been paying attention, too lost in thought.
“No, I haven’t. At least not more than I usually do,” Steve stated, enjoying how Tony bit his earlobe and played with it.
“I’m so proud of you, kiddo. Thank you for agreeing to this,” Steve praised as he leaned forward and kissed Tony on the forehead, making him squirm a little, but his eyes couldn’t hide the light of gratitude that overwhelmed him.
That made Tony feel more anxious, because he could clearly picture Steve doing that, and Tony had no idea how he was supposed to act if there was actually a playground. Would he be able to have fun and play on the swings and other equipment Steve had assembled, or would he feel too self-conscious of the fact he wasn’t a real kid and he shouldn’t be acting like one? Would Steve get disappointed if the latter happened?
“Tony. You should tell Tony,” Phil replied as he raised the remote and pointed it at the TV, turning it off.
“Now,” Steve said, placing the three items on his lap so Tony could get a good look at them, “it’s going to be the same with these, baby. You can pick what you want to wear, and it doesn’t have to be the definitive choice,” he reminded as he smiled fondly at his apprehensive baby.
And what to say about the technology? For a long time, Steve had stayed away from any gadget and the only ones he used were the TV, a cell phone – though only for phone calls – and appliances. It hadn’t been that he didn’t know how to use them – it was a complete misconception that Steve couldn’t handle electronic devices because he came from a different era and he couldn’t understand them, he was a smart guy and he surely could – it had been that he hadn’t wanted to, a bit against how people seemed to be obsessed with them.
Just a couple of weeks later, Phil called him in the dead of the night to ask him to go and check on Clint. Apparently, Phil had JARVIS inform him whenever Clint wasn’t doing OK so he could always go and help him deal with whatever Clint was struggling with. Though that night Phil had been very far away from New York and he soonest he could arrive to the Tower was until next morning. He didn’t want Clint to be all alone until then, not when he was feeling little.
"Why don’t we take advantage of the fact that you’re already awake and come to the kitchen with daddy, sweetheart? You can tell me what you'd like to drink," Steve proposed, palming his behind a couple of times. Tony froze, and his stomach twisted when he felt Steve squishing his butt. "Did you… did you use your diaper?" he questioned, sounding too enthusiastic for Tony's like. "You did, didn't you? Oh baby, that's great!" he expressed, placing his hands on Tony's sides and holding him out and up as he spun, a gleam in his eyes telling Tony how pleased he was. "Daddy's so proud of you!" Tony blushed more furiously, and the way his diaper swayed didn't help at all. "Let's get you out of that icky diaper, we don't want you to get a rash, do we, baby?" he expressed as he lowered him on the bed.
