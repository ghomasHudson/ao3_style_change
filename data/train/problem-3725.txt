Sam barely noticed when Dean returned.
The pair raised their hands in defeat as the Woman in White and her posse closed in. Sam’s heart was beating out of his chest, flashes of Jessica and his life back in Stanford going through his mind. Dean could feel the Beta energy coming from her, but something about it was wrong. Wild and twisted like a tumbleweed of razors. As he focused, he realized with a wrench of his gut what was wrong. Her Beta levels weren’t natural. It seemed she was one of those that had taken too much apple weed.
Following his lead, I took out Sam’s from my duffel bag and called over to the slightly pale looking mortician, “You should get some rest too.”
.” The voice hissed. “
Castiel and Sam were waiting down in the kitchen when I staggered in, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Sam lay on Cas’ lap, head resting comfortably on his knees. When I entered, Sam’s ears perked up and he opened his eyes.
I pleaded in my head, missing the days when he had enough power to pluck the thoughts directly from my mind without having to touch me.
“Dean,” Cas called, setting the glass down as he sat on the bed. “Wake up.”
Sam is a 'good boy', what will Dean do now?
Setting Dean back, the angel took a swig of the water, determined to get the human to drink something. In one swift move, he placed his hands on either side of Dean’s head, leaned down and pressed their lips together. Dimly, Cas noted that Dean’s mouth tasted like whiskey and peanuts as he pushed his lips apart and slowly fed him the water. For a moment, Dean struggled weakly, his clumsy hands pushing against Cas’ chest. But once his brain caught up with what was happening, his fingers curled around Castiel’s coat and he started swallowing.
“I missed you too.”
Dean stumbled into the room, clutching his side. He winced in pain as his eyes fell on Gertie lying dead. Looking between me and her, I realized why he had an ‘oh shit’ face. She was my ticket to getting changed back. Now that she was dead…
“When I wasn’t helping Jack, I would take her out for drives and listen to the mixtape you made.”
When Castiel felt Dean’s lips move slightly against his own, his first instinct was to pull away. He had kissed before, so he recognized what the hunter was doing. And he understood too that Dean was drunk and therefore impressionable. Cas thought he may be mistaking his lips for a beautiful woman’s. But he found himself stopped by one of Dean’s hands snaking up and curling around the base of his neck, trapping him there. Only when the water was gone did they pull apart.
He was giving me one of those unreadable looks of his that I still struggled with even after knowing him for years. Without a word, he took the trash can and set it on the ground. I still couldn’t meet his gaze. But when his fingers reached out and caught the edge of my shirt, I couldn’t help but look up. He noted that I jerked away slightly and paused.
“Everything.” I said seriously, trying to convey how important it was for me to hear a full and honest account.
She got to her feet slowly, eyes never leaving Jack’s as an air of deadly seriousness fell between them. “The angel grace will stay behind with me. He will go directly to heaven, no mortal plane, no collecting two hundred dollars, no passing go. And he will
“Jack,” I grabbed him by the shoulders and squeezed them gently. “You can talk to me.”
in your own car!”
He stood in front of me picking at his cuticles with his head down.
Dean tried to act cocky, but no one there thought much of his act. It was clear what he was. As they picked him up and hauled him off to the jailhouse, Dean hoped silently that his little brother hadn’t lost too much of his hunting skills while at Stanford.
Squinting through the din, more features came into focus: a hand, a tuft of hair, a leg. There was almost a dozen of them. It seemed that this was where the Tikbalang was keeping the people it had taken. I swallowed hard and adjusted the grip on my pistol.
As I sat on the worn leather seat and situated myself behind the wheel, I heard the crackle of radio static coming from the backseat.
“Always loved this song.”
I could hear chanting. Whatever she had planned for Maggie, it was happening now. I had to do something. Craning my neck, I started biting at the plant trapping me. From out of the corner of my eye a flash of white and beige went toward the voice. Castiel! I chewed faster.
It didn’t take long for Sam to find a young woman standing outside the general store mournfully hanging up missing posters that read:
“Deputy Hein!” the Sherriff barked angrily.
“Is he okay?” came a small voice from the doorway.
In answer the other Deputy ground her boot into Dean’s back as she cuffed his hands together. Tossing the pouch of plumb weed to her associate she commented wryly, “Our ne’er do well got himself some contraband.”
“Spring break. We all go to Western Washington University over in Bellingham. All of us live on campus and didn’t have enough money to make trips back home before the new semester, so we decided to take Greg’s van on a road trip out here and camp for a few days.” Arush explained shakily, gesturing to the guy over by Eddie that I assumed was Greg. “Thought it would be fun…”
“Not likely. Her mom, Tonya, has been comatose for the last three years.” Ivan answered.
“I guess that just means more for us to enjoy.”
About an hour later we got to Helena’s house. The lights inside were on, glowing clear and bright against the impending night. My gut once again twisted as I thought of Sam. Glancing down the street to make sure we hadn’t been followed, the pair of us knocked on the front door and waited. Helena opened it with enough force to send the wild curls around her face dancing.
Dean seemed satisfied enough. He turned back to the hissing bacon.
The plastic case on my phone rattled against the concrete floor. Numbly, I picked it up and turned it over. Sam was calling. Where was my voice?
“I’m alright, Sam.”
“I wish I had an answer, Cas. I really do.”
It didn’t take long to get to the morgue. About a ten-minute drive in the opposite direction Cas went. My hands felt clammy and slipped along the leather wrapped around the steering wheel as dark thoughts welled up. I tried remembering that he was a capable Angel of the Lord, but then my nightmare engulfed in fire would flash through my mind.
Wiping at my running nose, I staggered over to the edges of the camp and started rooting around for some more wood to throw on the coals. As I searched, I subconsciously went over the evidence in my head, so when I briefly smelled the heady aroma of tobacco, I thought it was just a trick of my sleep-dazed mind. But just as it dissipated, I realized it was real and tensed.
“Now listen here: people are in danger. Two innocent kids are missing, possibly dead. And they have nothing to do with your Company Town politics. If you want to continue on your crusade later, that’s perfectly fine, but right now we need to ask you some questions.”
a rare thing now. Disease and the general unforgiving nature of the ‘wild west’ had decimated their numbers. Usually only Alphas and high-ranking Betas could find and lay claim on an Omega mate. Just another reason for Sam to feel worried about presenting.
“I think the Reflector Bar down the road has Wi-Fi. We can go there tomorrow and get some research done.”
The duo shared a look before mounting up and heading over to the bridge. When they were in sight of the lawmen, they dismounted respectfully and strode over to where they stood gathered around a slaughtered horse. As they stood with their hands on their hips, one of the men called over the edge of the bridge to the river below and hollered, “Find anything?”
Tugging at his jacket, he pulled it back enough to reveal the fake badge pinned there. The flash of metal seemed to placate Joseph because he continued, “Askin’ me all sorts of questions about my wife Constance. Where she was buried. Improper things...”
“I do. When we got you out of the Empty, I wanted to tell you then, but that didn’t really work out.” I huffed. “I’ve waited thirty-eight years to tell you that I – no, wait, longer. Hold on…crap, whatever.”
“That’s beautiful, Dean but I don’t – “
Blood. Blood everywhere. Splashed across the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Every surface of the sitting room was drenched in red. As the doors yawned open, the smell intensified, hitting him like a blow to the face. Sam pressed his hand to his nose instinctively, but the scent was already burned into his olfactory senses. Staggering forward, his boots slipping along the wood, Sam found that he could not tear his eyes away from the horror that was the far western wall. Every square inch was covered in dismembered body parts that had been nailed in a sickeningly beautiful pattern around the fireplace.
“Sammy!” Dean choked out as soon as he heard me whimper again.
Sam nodded hollowly, not trusting his voice at the moment.
“Check in when you’re done with the family.”
We lay in silence.
Stepping closer she said, “Your law classes start next week, you can’t leave now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You think there’s a chance she’s still human?” Dean asked.
“Remember that desperado in Amherst? Or the train robber in Clifton?” Sam asked, rolling his eyes. “He
“That’s what I was thinking,” I smirked half-heartedly.
Staring right into his eyes I said, “I’m here, okay? Talk to me.”
Prodding the tender flesh, he glanced nervously around for whoever or whatever had been screaming or causing the screaming and then tested the joint. Muttering an apology, he slowly rotated my foot. Not gonna lie: it hurt like a bitch.
“Okay…” Dean coughed, turning so Castiel wouldn’t see the splotchy heat spreading from his cheeks down his neck.
“No time!” Dean jerked his head in the direction the druid went and cried, “Help Cas!”
“I’m…I’m afraid. All the time.”
“I thought I smelled somethin’ good,” one of the posse called out, earning some laughs and whoops of approval. “Seems like we got ourselves an Omega in heat!”
“Definitely. Where do you want us to meet you?”
He shoved Cas’ shoulder, telling him silently to get on his side. Then, he slid up behind, pressing chest to back and let out a shaky sigh into the crook of the dark-haired man’s neck. He folded one of his arms across Castiel’s chest, and wound the other under Castiel’s neck.
Forcing my face into one of neutrality, I strode over to the others. Two guys, twins, with matching haircuts and clothing and a girl that was wearing a ditch into the dirt with the amount of pacing she was doing.
It was the other residents of the boarding house. All of their heads lined the mantelpiece. Some still looked like they were screaming in pain. Above them was something that would haunt Sam’s nightmares until the day he died.
Taking the reins and swinging up into his saddle, the taller of the two muttered, “We got work to do.”
“Nice of you to finally show up.”
It didn’t take much for his orgasm to roar to the surface. Hot, long strings of cum shot across the dirt next to his bedroll, one after the other until he was spent. He wasn’t sure how loud he was being, but in the moment he didn’t care. It felt too good. When it was all done, Dean let out a shaking breath and opened his eyes.
As we got to the edge of town, Dean pulled out his gun and checked to make sure he had a bullet chambered. We could see Officer Oblonsky’s car down the road from the one-story ranch house that Gertie and her mom lived in. Before we got any closer, Dean muttered, “Hold up.”
“You’re out of practice.” Dean smirked, slowly releasing his hold on Sam.
He didn’t have much opportunity to ponder further. Constance’s foot collided with his side. She missed his ribs, but it still hurt like hell. Rolling away from her, Sam coughed and wheezed. She kicked again, this time her foot connecting with the middle of his back. A series of crazed screams and laughs erupted from the small woman as she started beating the younger Winchester.
Castiel decided that riding with me would be the easier option rather than both of us taking separate cars. I tried arguing against it, but in the end didn’t really have anything to back that up. He sat in the passenger seat, quietly gazing out the window as we headed north and east to South Dakota.
“I’m sorry…Cas –”
“Actin’ real out of it. Distracted. That wasn’t like him. Bastard is attentive to a fault.”
She snarled, but was cut off by the Sherriff. He rounded on her, giving her a warning of his own. To show that she wasn’t trying to challenge him, she lowered her head and let out a bitter whine. Feeling like they may be overstaying their welcome, Sam and Dean silently decided to hit the road.
Thanks to all of you that commented! It's so nice feeling like I'm not shouting into the void. (What's up Cmccle01? :D)
Noticing the quirk of the corner of his brother’s mouth, Sam nodded and laughed, relieved that Dean wasn’t one for grudges when it came to family. Still smiling and shaking his head as Dean slipped out into the hall, Sam turned back to the room. A familiar black and white photograph caught his eye and he strode over to it. Tugging it from under a pile of other papers Sam realized it was a photo of John Winchester looking about 15 years younger. Child Dean stood at his side; one hand posed on his father’s shoulder. Child Sam sat on his father’s lap. All had identical blank expressions on their faces.
Sam chanced getting shot by his own brother in order to move forward. Constance hadn’t been expecting that. Blood covered her teeth and her eyes flashed with wild Beta power. It was all Sam saw as she rushed him, snapping her jaws wildly in an attempt to get at his neck. They fell together, a tangle of limbs and adrenaline. The breath was knocked from his lungs just as his gun went spiraling away from his hand as their bodies slammed into the dirt.
” A familiar voice called, making my blood run cold. My brother whipped around, face going white as a sheet as he looked to me. He could hear it too. “
Cas nodded in satisfaction, reaching down and gently shaking Helena by the shoulders. She came awake with a start and a sharp intake of air. I stood and explained, “We should get some sleep.”
“Sleep.” He commanded softly.
“We’re sorry for your loss Mr. Waithe,” Sam said, noting my sudden quiet. “We’ll be out of here as quick as possible. Did your son have any new acquaintances?”
Suddenly, the quiet night air was interrupted by the sound of my phone's ringtone going off at full volume. I jumped. How was I getting reception? I hadn't had any since arriving. Tugging the offending machine out of my pocket, I glanced and saw that the caller ID was unknown.
Dean shot him a nasty glare before spitting, “I don’t need looking after, Sam.”
Confusion registered across Mr. Waithe’s face for a moment before he asked in a voice barely louder than a whisper, “FBI?”
I glanced over my shoulder worriedly and met Castiel’s intense blue eyes. His brows had drawn together worriedly.
Ignoring his pitying eyes, I took another drink, albeit a smaller sip this time, and asked with over-the-top boisterous frivolity, “Care to join me? The night is young and so are we. I mean, in angel terms you can’t be that – “
. Instantly Sam’s defensiveness doubled. A low growl came from deep in his throat as his hand went instinctually to the gun at his side. The prostitute noticed and immediately fell back; hands held up non-threateningly.
Leaning against the hood of the Impala with my arms over my chest I called, “You’d think these crunchy granola types would be out here slumming it instead of in a house to get the full experience.”
Sniffling and rubbing at her nose, Helena shook her head and said thickly, “I’m not sure. Ivan…I mean, Officer Oblonsky was the first to respond. I think he said something about an anonymous tip.”
He knew.
Warmth spreads across my chest as I look around at the hunters. Sam’s gaze catches my attention and I see a genuine smile spread across his face. He didn’t need to – I knew he would come with me – but he also called out, “For family.”
Sam grunted, trying to pull free but she was a presented Beta. What could he do? Perhaps he could appeal to her?
I flashed her my most charming smile and replied, “Once everyone is here, I’ll explain.”
A thud at his feet answered him.
As Sam studied the graves, Dean stood rooted to the spot. He’d just caught a whiff of the scent his brother was giving off. It was fading now, but unmistakably unnatural. It sent a shiver of terror down Dean’s spine. And he wasn’t one to get frightened easily.
Sam raised up a blood smeared hand toward his brother. Dean's dark blonde brows furrowed as he shook his head in question.
The Empty loosened her grip on my throat enough for me to gulp down a small bit of air. I craned to look and saw Sam standing with Eileen and Garth. I was surprised at Garth. He had a family to get back to, why was he risking so much?
After an hour of strenuous sweating and muscle cramping, we finally found their campsite. Set on the far eastern side of the small valley between the mountains. Their tents were untouched, and aside from their sleeping bags and a couple other items looking like they’d been tossed aside as they woke up in a rush, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
Dark blood pooled around his body from a wound I couldn’t find. Frantically I searched, hoping to stop the bleeding. But it was too late. His chest grew still.
My brows drew together in question as I struggled to come up with a reason for why that made any sense. Voice faltering slightly, I asked, “But, aren’t dams supposed to be like…better for the environment than other things?”
“Yes. I’m also sorry about that. It was wrong of them to manipulate you.”
Castiel took in a startled breath as he felt Dean’s tongue slip expertly into his mouth. Once again, the urge to pull away surfaced, but he was powerless to act on it. Not with Dean holding on to him and doing what he was doing with his mouth. After a moment though, Dean unlocked their lips. He pulled Castiel close enough that their foreheads touched and he breathed, “I don’t know when I started wanting you. But I do. Every day.”
Trying to blink away his unsteadiness, Dean slowly drew his six-shooter from the holster on his hip. He did it without hesitating, feeling her Beta power pulse through his body. Making sure to show her that he wasn’t going to try anything, he tossed it into the dirt and put his arms up, thinking that if she got close enough, he could try a cheap shot and make a run for it. Cautiously, the Deputy stepped closer.
Sam was a dog.
Does anyone know how to get rid of the second set of notes on the chapters? I thought that was only for the first chapter? Sorry for being such a noob lol
, that much was certain. I owed him that.
“We should go together. Better if there’s two if the dog-loving psychopath shows up.”
“When I saw you dead, I–”
As I stepped over the threshold into the oppressive nothing, I took in a deep, steadying breath and then sprinted forward. After a minute or so I stopped and hollered out, “I wanna talk!”
sure as hell aren’t.” Sam grumbled. “You’d probably break a breathalyzer...”
I scoffed.
I made a sad sound.
After peering once more at his brother and then at Breelyn who had taken up a new pacing spot, he muttered unsurely, “It’s going to sound crazy…”
“What about Cas?” I asked, looking up at Jack as my hands stilled in the long fur.
After a little less than a minute of fiddling, the door swung open with a subtle creek.
Closing her eyes as if the memory pained her to recall, she continued, “I managed to get one of ‘em on the radio that’d gotten separated from the others. I-I tried gettin’ him out but…but he wasn’t makin’ any sense. Kept sayin’ he was in a maze…”
“He loves us like family,” Sam muttered, gripping the steering wheel tightly. “I’m not going to shut him out.”
Satisfied, Brady turned to Sam, and threw a chummy arm around his shoulder, “To our late-bloomer, Mr. Winchester! Congratulations on making it through to the
He released me, practically throwing my head back. It lolled on my neck before I was able to get control of my muscles. I followed his slow walk around me, noting the bloody gashes where his wings used to be.
After a moment, the flash of coin passed between them and the mysterious man strode purposefully toward the saloon. The younger Winchester was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice.
Castiel nodded then asked, “Where?”
The windows of the house were dark. Sam’s boots crunched on the loose dirt under his feet as he begrudgingly walked toward it in front of the Woman in White and three of her posse. Their horses stopped. Sam looked back at the bandits and saw them staring at Constance with sadness in their eyes. So, they knew what Sam found out from Joseph.
“He walked me back home, then rode off on his horse…said he’d come back in the morning to take me to market, but…never showed up.”
“What in the hell are you doing here?” Sam asked.
Rocks scraped the palms of his hands as the taller of the two brothers scrambled to the tree line. The pair ducked behind separate trees just as returning fire exploded against the trunks, sending chunks of splintered wood into the air.
“I’m not in the mood for a talent show.” The Empty hissed snidely. “Get out before I rip that pretty hair off your head.”
Jack shook his head, “I don’t know how Chuck got Lucifer out of there. Amara isn’t sure either.”
I grunted in agreement.
“What the hell happened?”
Finally, she asked in a quiet voice, “Kids…?”
Her voice in my head was loud, clear, and very surprising. As soon as her eyes landed on me, recognition flashed through them.
This added to Sam’s anxieties about presenting late. If he ended up as an Omega, he would lose her. Omegas can only be part of the same pack if the leaders of said pack brought them together. If he was a Beta, then he could mate with Jessica and start his own pack, just like his father did with his mother. Then they could find land somewhere and start a family of their own.
“How is she?” I asked.
Glowering up at me she whispered, “Whatever is out there…tried to use my little sister against me. I will never forgive that. And if you don’t find it and stop it, then I will.”
“That and anything else that comes to mind.” Sam said, nodding to her as a silent sign of support.
Castiel’s limp body was no longer in my lap.
Sam breathed heavily through his nose in disbelief at the voice. The light from the gas lamps fell over one half of his attacker’s face, illuminating a familiar set of green eyes and freckles.
Meeting Sam on the front porch, our mutual expressions of disappointment were enough that words were not needed. Silently we made our way to the car and headed off in the direction of the visitor center, which by the way was annoyingly twenty minutes back the way we came from in Newhalem. When we did get there, the parking lot was surprisingly full. Multiple groups of tourists and hikers were jammed inside, asking about the trails and history of the area. An attractive red-head wearing the shortest of shorts (impractical but oh so sexy) looked me up and down as we passed through the glass doors at the front. I smirked and waggled my brows victoriously at Sam (to which he rolled his eyes).
“Sammy?!” I turned, rushing over.
Glancing at Castiel in the passenger seat, I saw him nodding in understanding before mumbling distractedly, “Dean does have immense difficulty expressing himself.”
“He working on a story?”
“No,” Sam muttered, more to himself than his brother. “A lawful life.”
Castiel’s mind cleared. He groaned, hips stuttering as he pulled out and shot his load all across the Omega’s back. For all of ten seconds his orgasm felt amazing. And then he came back to reality. The Omega was starting to complain. Castiel reached down and put his hand over the Omega’s mouth and leaned in so his lips were close to the other’s ear.
“Morning,” I grumbled.
“Weirder how?”
Shaking his head, he continued, “We picked up some last-minute stuff at the gas station in Newhalem. Carly saw her old roommate there and held us up for a while catching up before Gavin went over and pulled her away. After that we headed to the trailhead. But…Carly didn’t seem right. She wasn’t herself. Kept tweaking out.”
“And this isn’t really a dog?”
Sam’s arms were around my shoulders in an instant. My tears soaked into the front of his shirt as he pressed my head to his chest. I gripped the fabric tightly, reliving the moment of Cas’ lips forming the words ‘I love you’ over and over again.
“Don’t you talk about him.”
“Alright, so I’m going to get these kids back to Diablo. You staying here to check out the area?”
Both could see the glint of badges in the late morning light. They hopped down from their horses and pulled them off to the side. Wiping at his sweating brow, Sam asked, “Think we can ask them what’s going on? Looks like whoever Pa is after might have done this.”
I was a bit envious that Cas got to go in Ivan’s car. For some reason the thought of riding along and smelling all those smells out of an open window sounded amazing. But a walk through the town would be okay too. I trotted along next to Dean, excitedly sniffing at the air as we went. Everything seemed alive and ten times tastier smelling than normal.
. Still looking like he was itching to pull his gun, he looked to Castiel and said, “Agent Dion, I’m going to need you to explain what the hell I just heard.”
Castiel shook his head, “If they went back to their sacred site and replenished power and supplies, they’ve probably already changed her.”
Picking my head up, I perked my ears, noting how weird it was that they sort of flopped around my face.
“Floyd Rees? My name is Ranger Plant. You mind if I ask you a few questions?” I asked, holding up my badge for his scrutinizing eyes.
“I’m going to change.” I said, not looking forward to avoiding another confrontation with him. “We’ll talk about a game plan when we come out.”
Ivan didn’t reply right away. And when he did, he did so with a pointed glare in my direction, “Just look out for Helena until I can make it back.”
. Sam defended silently.
“I hope you find them.” She called forlornly after our retreating backs.
Castiel adjusted his position so he could look directly into my eyes. For a moment we stared at each other. He shook his head and held up his hands to do overly emphasized air quotes, “Something in the spell is ‘scrambling the signal’, so to speak.”
I couldn’t see his face because I refused to break eye contact with the road. Had to admit that I didn’t really have a stomach for this kind of conversation. My great gift from dear old Dad.
“There’s nothing to talk about. She’s gone. Has been for a long time.”
Picking our way down the side of the mountain was not easy. I felt my leg muscles straining in an effort to keep me upright. There were a couple times where I had to slide down directly on my ass. But once we were a comfortable distance away from the tower I asked, “Did you get anything out of Marina?”
“Well, you don’t really
Whispers as faint and indistinct as a breeze reached my ears. It didn’t seem to come from anywhere in particular, and yet it was all around me. I whipped around; gun ready. A chill swept down my spine like someone or something had run their finger along its length. I stiffened, waiting for the inevitable attack. Instead, something warm and wet plopped onto my cheek. Startled, I reached up. Pulling my fingers away I saw blood.
My fist collided with my attacker who hadn’t moved after bludgeoning me. Their small frame went staggering back, crashing into a worktable. The random contents scattered across the ground. Before I could get another hit in, or tackle them, they threw out their hand and uttered a string of guttural words. It sounded familiar, but the sudden tearing of flesh on my forehead sent me doubling over in surprise and pain. In the next instant blood flowed down my face, blinding one eye.
. Dean thought.
Birds chirped lazily as the morning sun slowly lit up the sky. A thick blanket of fog settled over the damp earth, making the forest feel even deeper than it had before. My ankle ached as I sat staring vacantly through the dense foliage, chin resting on my fist.
Cas remembered Sam telling him to give his brother water, so he went and got a full glass from the kitchen. Dean hadn’t moved, but Castiel immediately spotted the crease of worry and light sheen of sweat on his brow. He was having a nightmare.
“To staying a respectful distance from people’s business.” Dean offered, raising his glass.
Turning back around a small gush of air rushed out of my constricting throat. Cas stood, locked in place by the pointed tips of the Tikbalang’s dagger-like fingers hooked under his chin. I watched helplessly as the points threatened to dig into the skin of his neck.
Understandable I supposed. After dragging my inconsolable ass off the mountain and back to Diablo, I fell into shock. I refused to talk, or eat, or move. Sam stuffed me into the back seat of the Impala, packed up all our gear, and took me out of there. The first motel we stayed at was in Sedro-Woolley, a town about an hour and a half from Diablo. When he couldn’t get me to do much besides sleep, he moved me to Bellingham so he could check on the college kids.
Without a word, he slipped his arm around my shoulder, pulling me onto the bed beside him. For half a second, I moved to push him away. But then his voice rumbled in his chest, close to my ear, “I’ve got you, Dean.”
Could dogs roll their eyes? This one did. It was such a human gesture…
The strength and cheer that had been fueling my facial expression before seeped away quickly. He didn’t comment. Didn’t say anything really, just stared at me. Like he already knew what I was going to say; what I was thinking. It twisted my insides. Pursing my lips, I turned my body away from him unconsciously. Or consciously. Who the hell knew? Rubbing at my jaw with my free hand I glanced to the angel to see if he’d noticed my weird behavior.
~ 0 ~
Holding up my hands as a sign of peace, I called, “Hey, whoa there. Just…just let him go. I’m the one you want.”
Clapping my hands together after a brief pause, I stood and thanked him for the coffee. He followed after me to the doors and said as I stepped out onto the narrow front porch, “I hope you find them. May not like them, but it’s not right to wish harm on another person.”
“I was scared,” I answered, every delirious blink of my eyes lasting for what felt like minutes. “Of a lot of things.”
“You don’t forget stuff like that.” I continued. “That’s why my family does what we do. To save people like you, like Maggie. Please...help us now.”
“Right, so back in the day, my Dad helped out a family in Peoria, Illinois with a poltergeist problem.” I explained, watching Cas’ sad expression slowly neutralize as I did. “The family’s oldest daughter Helena was the one who called. She just took the mortician position in Ashland. Said that a couple bodies were brought in that, according to her, are ‘our kind of weird’.”
Smirking in mock disbelief he shook his head and held up a free hand. I tossed the keys at him which he caught deftly. As he got into the driver’s seat, I let my own smile fall.
"Don't-...Dean?"
Sammy turned in quickly, zipping up the entrance to his tent and snoring softly after a few minutes. There were too many thoughts racing around in my head for me to sleep though, despite how worn out I was from hiking around all day. Sinking in to my fold out chair by the low burning fire I found myself worrying about those college kids.
Knowing Sam, he most likely wanted to argue.
He licked his chapped lips and continued leading the drunk man.
I felt him lean toward my lower half and I flipped over in a panic, but he just gave me a confused look before reaching for my leg. Hovering his palm over my ankle, I watched as an intense light brightened his palm. Small granules of what looked like molten pearls drifted down and gradually, the pain dissipated. When he was done, I pushed myself into a sitting position and tested it. I relished the absence of the aching pain that had been there before.
“He’s a squirrely one!” one of the men hollered, wiping at the fresh cut on his lip that Dean bequeathed him. “That aint normal for an Omega in heat.”
Castiel couldn’t think. He let his vessel’s natural instincts kick in as his desire blossomed like a flame. This time he was the one to initiate the kiss. Dean’s hips gyrated, rutting against the solid form of the angel. Their breathing became labored; hot and wanting. Castiel lifted himself enough to angle away from Dean, leaving room for him to run his palm greedily down Dean’s taught chest toward his belt.
I huffed agitatedly from where I lay on the passenger seat, shooting my brother a look that said,
Impressively, the Sherriff didn’t rise to the jab. Instead he closed John’s journal, set it on the desk and said dangerously, “What do the numbers mean? And mind yer cussin’,
“On our way. Over.” Sam said, turning to me.
Sam turned to look at Castiel and the two shared a smug look. I rolled my eyes.
He nodded, sighing like he definitely understood. Rubbing at a spot on his temple he mumbled, “So I suppose you want to know about when I last saw Jacob?”
” It said, moving faster than my eyes could track to just out of my range. Castiel grimaced, pawing uselessly at the hand holding him as the sharp points stuck into his skin once more.
Ever since Sam could remember, their Pa had drilled them with survival, fighting, and the notion that a person’s worth was found in what they presented as. Sam and Dean were expected to be Betas. The best of all of them. That’s what John Winchester was. Anything less was dangerously vulnerable. It was what Pa blamed for Mama’s death, second only to the bastard that killed her.
His brother’s voice sounded so small. Sam wasn’t even sure Dean realized. It made the taller of the two pause and think about the people trying to survive in the wild country. Lawmen were few and far between out there. And of the ones there were, more than half were crooked.
“Your boyfriends fine.” I huffed, shouldering my way past her.
“Like the banshee that took away my hearing when I was a baby or something like that.” She said, her hands signing excitedly.
“Cas,” his name still felt natural to say. “I missed you.”
The pair went through the alleyway, silent and brooding. When they reached the other side, Sam noticed the beautiful black mare hitched and waiting. That was Pa’s old horse, Baby. He’d gotten a good deal from a rancher they’d helped with a bandit problem and raised her from a foal. Sam never thought he’d see the day that his father entrusted his precious horse to someone else, even someone like Dean who loved her as much, if not more.
I noticed that Castiel didn’t quite meet my gaze as I came in. Probably wondering if I was going to give him shit for going behind my back and healing me.
Wiping at her dripping nose, she glanced up and asked unsurely, “You mean the workers at the dam disappearing?”
“You’re here,” she commented, sounding relieved. “Sam’s in the living room.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“C’mon,” I muttered. “Let’s go check.”
Cold air ghosted over my exposed skin, chilling me. I cracked open my eyes in confusion and looked around the room. The pastel blue walls of Helena’s guestroom were gone. I wasn’t even in a room anymore. Thick tree trunks surrounded the clearing, disappearing into the inky black. My breathing picked up as I spun around. I was in the forest back in Washington.
Without speaking, Dean bent and snatched up the long, menacing knife from the dead woman’s belt. One foot after the other, he made it to the man’s side, knelt, and stuck him through the heart. The man’s eyes widened a moment before slowly closing.
Her body temperature rose again as she let out a small whimper of desire. Despite wanting nothing more than to take her right then and there, Sam couldn’t help but think about his brother waiting. The quicker he found his father, the quicker he could come back and put his life as a bounty hunter behind him once more. Reluctantly, he pulled away.
My eyelids stuck together like tacky, half dried glue. Or at least my drunk mind thought so. Okay…
Wrestling the gun out from my waistband, I stepped away from the light of the flames and peered into the darkness.
So, my brother
he considered his best friend. The kind of mind-blowing sex that lived in legends and changed everything. His mind flashed to the brief thought he’d had earlier. Dean pictured Castiel between his legs, pressing his dick inside. He’d overheard people mentioning that it hurt, but in this fantasy it didn’t. It was incredible.
Life seemed to go by in a haze after that. The last monster I’d heard of was a vamp about five years back. Cancer took Eileen. Sam came to live with me, like old times. Miracle III had a litter, but this time I didn’t keep one for myself. Little Dean took up the tradition of keeping a Miracle around. I gave him the Impala the next year.
“Damn right.”
“Obviously not enough if you’re still getting on my bad side.”
“Yes, sir. We were hoping to ask you some questions about your son’s death.”
“Nothing to be afraid of?” Dean countered, pushing away from the wall to face Sam squarely. “Of course, you should be afraid, you know who’s out there.”
I shook my head and turned to look in the direction Cas had gone. And there she was, my baby. Looking better than the last time I’d seen her. I whistled appreciatively and headed for the driver’s side. As the pair of us got in, I looked over at Cas and asked, “Is this how you’ve been getting around without your wings?”
“I mean, I heard about those people disappearing. Sometimes I go up to the dam to see what kind of new damage has been done, but they run me off pretty quickly…I don’t…” she said, voice constricting as she grew more and more upset.
“You don’t have to do this!” I begged, locking eyes with Cas who looked like he was trying to tell me to run. “Isadora is controlling you. If I can get the spine back – “
Castiel obliged, tossing the shirt away.
“The skeletal structure presents like that of an animal. As soon as I realized I was dealing with something…supernatural, I called you.”
There were two bars in town but Dean wasn’t at either of them. Next, we checked the local diner, but still nothing. A heavy knot of worry started up in my gut. My brother wouldn’t be stupid enough to go and hurt himself directly. He would find others to do the punishing for him. With that in mind we checked every shady looking place, which were few in numbers considering how small this place was. But still he was nowhere in sight.
“So, what exactly is the plan?” Charlie asked, quirking her brow in my direction. “And what’s with the random junk?”
A solid knock on the door startled me out of my trance. I looked up just as Helena stood and moved to open it. It was Ivan. He looked tired but glad that the crazy ordeal seemed to be over. Helena gathered him up in a sudden hug, squeezing him tightly and burying her face in his shoulder. A deep red blush colored his entire face, making him look like a school boy. A wild departure from the normally uptight officer of the law.
“Cas,” Dean breathed, chest heaving. “I don’t know what I’m ready for.”
Tapping at his horse’s sides with the heels of his boots, he let the stallion trail after Dean’s mare while he opened the letter and read the smudged – slightly water damaged – familiar scrawl that was John Winchester’s handwriting:
The cool touch of iron against his temple caused Sam’s body to freeze on instinct. All hopes of protecting his vulnerable brother were dashed as the Woman in White repeated, “Take me home.”
Sliding into the driver’s seat of the Impala, I took out my phone from my pocket and pulled up the messages. Nothing new from Castiel, which could be a good or a bad thing. Hoping it was the former, I shot him a quick text updating him about our plans.
“Yeah, well, breaking out of jail isn’t as easy as it sounds.” Dean called, emerging from the darkness.
“Dean?”
“Yeah…just a bad dream.” I answered, not intentionally wanting to sound unsure, but it came out that way. Trying to cover the fact that I, Dean Winchester had been rattled by a nightmare, laughed shakily, “We gotta stop bonding over barf.”
Rubbing at my eyes I laughed and asked, “Who’re we picking up?”
, Cas said silently.
Mouth falling open, Sam choked out, “Dean?”
“Right,” Sam muttered, taking the key the man had placed on the counter. “He staying here or something?”
As soon as he’d spoken to her husband Joseph, Sam deduced that that was how she chose her victims. Those that spurned their loved ones for another. It was the only thing that explained the randomness of the killings.
Castiel moved so he was more securely between Dean’s legs and rolled his hips. This time Dean could not hold back from moaning. Something about Castiel taking charge was turning him on more than he thought it would. Cas continued playing with Dean’s now pert nipples before pulling back to admire the sight below him. He still couldn’t quite believe what was happening.
She snarled, eyes flashing with Beta power as she pulled a pair of handcuffs from her side. Dean shuddered at the sight, surprising himself. He took the root earlier, so her influence shouldn’t have such an effect on him, unless…
“What?”
To Sam’s frustration, he caught sight of Dean glowering in response. His brother stuffed his hands in his jacket and took a few steps further into the dark of the alley. The younger of the two watched as he disappeared into the shadows. He knew that Dean wanted him to follow. He almost did out of instinct. But he stopped, thinking of Jessica waiting for him. He needed to let Dean know that he wasn’t going; plainly.
Sensing my guilt, he placed his hand on my shoulder and said, “I was happy to help.”
The question kind of came out. Sam regretted saying anything as soon as he felt the sting of the handle of her pistol slam against the side of his head. He fell to the dirt with a grunt of pain and didn’t have time to clear the stars from his eyes before Constance was on top of him, holding him down with more strength than she looked like she possessed.
“Give me your matches, Dean.” Sam repeated, his voice commanding. Neither paid much attention to how the words trembled a little.
As soon as he’d seen her, Sam knew that he wanted to mate with her. She was beautiful, smart, funny, kind; everything that someone would want in a pack partner. Jessica said she felt the same. They’d started courting only three months after Sam moved in to the boarding house.
Again, Castiel’s voice came as a comfort as he said gently, “Don’t worry. He’ll be fine.”
Eyes turned once again to me. Clearing my throat, I looked away from Sam. I thought of Cas and his words that were constantly bouncing around in my head.
While Dean talked, Sam continued pouring over the documents their father had collected. Two in particular that caught his eye mentioned the fact that the murderess was going by the name Woman in White, the other mentioned that a Woman in White ghost was traditionally one that died tragically and haunted their spouse if they were unfaithful. Nearby was one last article that talked about the unfortunate drowning at a local pond that claimed the lives of the two young Welch children.
me. There was no mistaking the meaning. I could feel it deep in my bones. But…
The woman’s expression grew dark as she said, “Yes sir. Planning on mating and starting a pack of their own in three months’ time.”
"I guess that explains why there are such tiny-ass towns in the ass-crack of nowhere," I said thoughtfully, removing the pump from the gas intake. Screwing in the cap, I continued, “Okay, so the only thing we got is a handful of recently missing people. We should head to the motel in Diablo and get our research in order before questioning the locals.”
been worried about me. Enough to call Cas.
“What, you mean like a cigarette?”
Sam rolled his eyes.
“I swore that I was done, Dean.”
, I huffed, shooting him a disapproving look.
“Fine.” I gasped, trying to get the continuous roiling of my stomach under control. “It’s nothing.”
“I understand,” Sam replied, hunching his shoulders under his older brother’s intense gaze. “But after Mama was killed – the way Pa brought us up – Dean, he was a man obsessed.”
“I’ll go.” Cas nodded.
“D-Don’t say that Breelyn…” the other twin whispered in horror, looking as if he were about to burst into tears at any moment.
Did we not defeat the Tikbalang? Were we still trapped on the mountain?
“Cas…I’m sorry,” I mumbled thickly.
“Dean!” the familiar gravelly voice came from behind.
Plucking at Dean’s jacket sleeve he rumbled, “It’s been a while since I got to spend any
Shooting a worried look at Castiel, Dean asked, “Can you heal him?”
“Shut up!” the officer cut in. I squinted and saw the name badge on his chest that read
Letting out a frustrated groan, Sam relented, “Fine.”
“Happy marriage?”
When he was gone, Sam reached into his pocket and withdrew the ring he'd planned on giving Jessica. He stared in angry desperation down at the small velvet box, unable to bring himself to open it and look upon the simple gold band he'd painstakingly chosen and saved for. It would have been beautiful sitting plainly on Jessica's delicate finger. She would have made it shine. Sam could imagine her face; what it would have been like when he got down on one knee. She would have smiled in disbelief before holding it close, like it was the most precious thing in all the world.
I flashed back to my conversation with Arush about the events leading up to going into the woods and remembered that he’d mentioned Carly had stopped to catch up with someone before Gavin pulled her away. A part of me wanted to keep her on our suspect list but watching her now I couldn’t believe that any longer. She was really broken up about Carly, and not in a ‘I’m poorly acting false emotions cause I’m a bad guy’ kind of way. It was genuine.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Baton Rouge.”
I moved my lips, carefully opening them against his. It felt right.
He pulled her in close, one hand curling around the small of her back. Leaning down, he pressed his nose into the crook of her neck, right where she dabbed her perfume in the mornings and right where her Omega scent would be strongest. It smelled like peonies and honeysuckle warmed in the heat of a summer’s day. Sam imagined that that was what her Omega scent was like. Jess trembled against him, but not in fear. She tilted her head to give him better access and clung to his solid frame like she would tumble away without him.
Still looking confused but sobering up quickly, Sam glanced from me to Cas in quick succession and asked, “You feeling better?”
“Morning,” Sam greeted, opening his suit jacket and reaching in to pull out his badge.
“You – ha ha,” the man smiled. When my expression didn’t change and I made no indication of moving the subject along, he mumbled, “Oh, you’re serious…um well, there’s legend of the spirit of a Native American Dog Soldier that appears once every so often to punish the white man. Other than that, I mean, some rumors of a Wendigo pop up when we find body parts but it’s usually because a wolf or cougar gets a little opportunistic when it finds some poor bastard that fell off the trail and killed himself.”
Rain pelted the Impala. A chill ran up my body as a faint breeze ghosted over. I crossed my arms tightly over my chest in an effort to conserve heat. Nestling my head into the space where the car seat met with the window, I muttered for Sam to turn up the heat. Silence. Not just Sam’s lack of response, but the Impala wasn’t running. My eyes shot open.
Jack, he’s just sorta –”
Gail too worked for one of the plays in town. She was at the Cabaret Theater as a sound designer. Her family was immensely proud that she’d managed to get such a good position so soon after graduating from Southern Oregon University. None of them could recall her ever having known Thomas Waithe. She didn’t have any known enemies or previous grudges. No significant other. Just a hard-working young woman. Her mom had been the one to report her missing when she didn’t come home.
The older man heard the truth in Dean’s words and relaxed. After a moment Dean hollered over to the bartender for a round of whiskeys for the table. Joseph nodded his head in appreciation. Neither spoke while they waited for their drinks. When she poured Dean’s, he muttered for her to leave the bottle and handed her another dollar. Mildly surprised, she pocketed the money obligingly.
I was halfway done unbuttoning my shirt when I caught sight of his blue eyes watching me. I froze, realizing that I was standing half naked in front of Castiel, who was looking at me more intensely than a friend should. He didn’t seem to care that I noticed.
Castiel shrugged.
The drive was uneventful, filled with the usual dulcet tones of the greats. While I drove, Sam fiddled with his laptop, going over all of the details that he’d managed to download before we left the motel. Somewhere on the edge of western Montana, his computer finally died and he pulled out some of the books on monsters that were our tried and true over the years. As he reached back to the rear seat to grab a stray volume, I caught a look at the back of his hair. It was all tangled and matted, like he’d slept on it rough and didn’t bother maintaining it like he normally did.
“Are you alright, Mr. Winchester?” Jessica asked, suddenly appearing at the tall man’s side. “You look like you’re a thousand miles away.”
“Two druids? Don’t like the sound of that.” Dean grumbled.
Dean’s eyes widened as he looked to me for confirmation.
Lifting Cas so only his toes brushed the ground, the Tikbalang rubbed the side of its face against his struggling form. White hot anger boiled up and I started toward them, not sure what I would do, but unwilling to back down.
“It’s okay, Sammy.” He said, coming to my side and patting my head. “We’ll figure it out. We always do.”
“That creature was wrong,” he said earnestly, blue eyes seeking out my own. “The people who choose to help you, do it willingly.”
A shudder passed down Dean’s spine, but he managed to shake it off before anyone caught on. Clearing his throat, he put on the best uncaring swagger he could and flashed the badge on his jacket. The cocky action seemed to amuse the burly Sherriff and he calmed slightly.
“Hey, you think you can try and get those off now that Gertie’s dead?” I asked, pausing in the doorway and nodding to Castiel. When Maggie and Sam were side by side and I saw the runes on their collars I got the idea. “I mean, now that she’s gone, her magic should be weakened right?”
Dean quirked his brow.
An awkward silence fell between the three of us as the seriousness of this situation fell like a hammer on an anvil. Clearing my throat, I rubbed at my dripping nose and gestured toward the handful of kids a few yards away and asked, “How did they find you?”
“C’mon,” I muttered, heading to the Impala.
Dean watched Joseph carefully for any tells. If they’d been playing Texas hold ‘em, Dean could have swept the rug out from under him. Every twitch was filled with guilt.
A soft whine came up from my throat.
“Thomas and I…we didn’t really talk much in the end.”
“Get up Sammy!” he hollered, shooting a few more rounds at the bandits as they hurried to find cover.
He really hadn’t changed in all the time Sam had been away. Even now that he was Omega. Sam let out a sigh. After all, he supposed he hadn’t really changed that much either. Or at least…he hoped he hadn’t.
“I don’t know about that, but – “
Castiel’s deep voice rose up, breaking through the static that I’d surrounded myself in for the last few hours. I blinked. The windows behind him were black. How late was it? I looked around and saw Helena slumped over the table next to us, head in her arms, breathing deeply in sleep.
Castiel explained to Maggie that we weren’t the bad guys and that she was safe now. Sam tried communicating with her too, but didn’t seem to be having much luck. It took a while but eventually she calmed down. Well…as much as one could after getting told you were stuck as a dog for the time being.
Over the next few weeks, my throat healed up, Eileen moved in, and Sam and I made the decision to make the bunker open to all hunters. There were still monsters out there that needed to be taken care of after all. Sam asked me if I was alright at one point, and for the first time in my life I didn’t try to lessen the impact of how everything turned out. I told him I missed Cas. Every day. But that I was happy being with my family here.
“Anything from Cas?” Sam asked trying really hard to sound casual.
Soon others step forward and echo, “For family.”
Tense silence fell again. Internally I ordered myself to open my mouth and talk. So much of this angsty bull shit could be solved with a bit of communication, I knew. But I felt powerless. All I had was my dad’s voice in my head drilling me to: act like a man, look after Sammy, save people. Even if that meant I couldn’t save myself.
He was the new God. What could be frightening to him? It seemed he knew what I was thinking.
“This is so fucked.” I muttered, rubbing at my temples.
“Don’t be a dick! Show your face!”
“The Stetattle Creek Trail Head in about an hour and a half.”
“What the –”
The man didn’t acknowledge our departure, just continued staring blankly at the glass in his hand. All I could think about was how similar this man was to my own father.
A cold hand suddenly clamped down on my forearm, tugging me closer. I fought weakly as I looked into Sam’s face as he said, “
**Edit: Thank you emmy250 for the help!!! Figured it out after a while!!! <3
“Nothing good,” I grumbled, feeling a wave of sleepiness come over me as I settled. How much sleep had I gotten over the last few days? Couldn’t remember.
Sam headed further into the alley, to keep away from prying eyes and ears, but he stopped when he noticed Dean had stilled.
I let out a wet laugh. It hurt but it didn’t matter at that moment.
As he stood, hands shaking at his sides, Sam felt as if flames radiated from his skin. Dean noticed and took a step back on instinct, not fully understanding why. Sam followed, reaching out to grasp at his brother possessively.
After the first thrust, his full lips parted. One of his hands rose, running over his sweating face and into his hair, fisting it as though he felt like he needed something to ground himself as his orgasm overwhelmed him. His eyes were screwed shut. After the second thrust, his whole body convulsed and the first strand of white cum shot out, coating Castiel’s fingers. The third thrust, slicked by hot cum, elicited the most amazing moan. Dean’s load shot furthest at this moment, coating Castiel’s stomach in white.
Despite it being his right as an Alpha, Cas fought the urge to mark the beautiful exposed skin of the Omega. Instead, he shut his eyes and thrust, burying his member in warm, pliant heat. The power behind his movements slowed as he felt his climax build. The hole he was buried in clenched in anticipation, willing him to fill it with his seed. Every fiber of his being wanted him to do so. The thought of Zachariah’s watching eyes triggered Cas’ Alpha powers to flare in defiance. This was wrong.
“It’s the holidays…Scrooge.”
His deep voice was so soothing, the effect it had on me was immediate. Slowly, in disbelief, I lifted my head and caught sight of a familiar trench coat. Castiel. As I looked into his quizzical face, I was reminded that I could always trust him to have my back.
I didn’t say anything.
He smiled nervously.
He grunted again, brows furrowing.
Both Jack and Sam got out their phones, riding on the high of the excitement that I was giving off. I slammed my foot on the gas, causing the tires to spin and squeal. Passersby around us shot dirty looks in our direction, but I didn’t care. They were soon small blurs in the rearview mirror as the Impala raced down the road heading west. Toward the bunker. Toward home.
Not being able to see his face was helping, but I still couldn’t find the words I needed. He didn’t speak, waiting for me to continue. The words felt like they burned as they came out of my dry throat, “You don’t…you don’t have to deal with…
Dean’s gaze finally locked on to the beautiful woman over Sam’s shoulder. Remembering that Jessica was still there, Sam turned and caught sight of her warry expression. Offering her a weak smile, Sam explained, “Miss Jessica Moore, let me introduce my brother, Dean Winchester.”
“That’s why I’m going to knock back some pain pills, get some sleep, and bandage up.”
I raised my brow and glanced over at him. He was being serious. His blue eyes, now as bright as gems in the light, flicked up to meet my own.
Dean’s eyes looked clearer now that he’d ingested some non-alcoholic fluids, but he was obviously still drunk considering his words were slightly slurred.
Sam didn’t even need to smell it to know what it was, Plumb Weed. Not its scientific name of course. He’d seen pictures and read accounts of it in one of his classes back at Stanford. Its original purpose was to dampen the scent of those who wished their heats to be less intense. And was outlawed quickly when people used it to trick weaker opponents into duels or mate battles. Contrarywise there was Apple Weed. Usually Alphas or dominant Betas would use it to heighten their scents and make them stronger which gave them an edge over other mates. Trouble was that some went too far and ended up taking too much, poisoning themselves. Some couldn’t recover and ended up going mad.
“I know.”
“It wasn’t your fault Isadora.” Sam said, brows drawn together in concern.
“How’d she pass?” Dean asked, careful to keep his excited curiosity out of his voice. “If you don’t mind me asking?”
with this,” Cas chastised softly. “I’m helping a friend.”
Stepping out of the Impala, it felt like I was in a dream. I probably was. Chuck was still around. Who’s to say he wasn’t pulling the puppet strings? Sam and Jack glanced at me curiously, but seemed more concerned with the fact that everyone on the planet was gone. They asked what happened and all I could say was that Cas was taken by the Empty.
“Son of a bitch,” he grumbled under his breath.
Pointing at the bottom corner of the shot, Castiel said, “But Sam’s encounter did give us something.”
Sam shot me a disapproving look and kept inspecting the area. I took the time to stretch and catch my breath. Sitting on a rotting fallen log I took in the state of the clearing. The occasional beer can. Lots of footprints. And…something high up on a moss-covered tree. Squinting, I went over to get a closer look. From there it seemed almost like a hand print. Hard to distinguish from the thick layer of lichen coating the bark, and also because it was twice the size of a normal hand and not something probable.
“No! Jess! Jessica!” Sam cried, fighting weakly.
“Okay, so let’s pack up. We could get there in about a day if we take shifts driving.”
Subtly, Dean bit his bottom lip. After a moment he continued pointedly, “Pa went on a
This wasn’t his mate. This wasn’t his anything. This was some random Omega from some backwater town in some shabby saloon that Zachariah ordered him to breed. Why? Didn’t matter why. It was a show of loyalty.
My heart stuttered and sank. But I wasn’t about to take no for an answer.
“Aw, he’s so cute!” the other dog’s owner crooned. “What kind of dog is he?”
“Hey, so I just met this crazy girl carrying around an antler.”
“Why don’t you two go to the morgue.” I said nonchalantly, scratching agitatedly at the back of my neck. I could see the refusal on his lips so I continued, “I mean, you were the one that talked with that chick on the phone, Sammy. You got a rep going.”
“Huh, well that would explain why the Tikbalang has suddenly become homicidal. Someone must have gotten the spine.”
“Wait,” Sam called, going after her and catching her by the elbow. “Whatever you came to say, you can say in front of Miss Moore.”
Despite the Plumb Weed in his system, Dean could still feel the urge to cower away from the ferociousness behind the man’s words. Taking in a steadying breath, he waited a beat for the feeling to pass before saying, “No, sir. I only intended to share in your…pain.”
“No!” I cried, springing forward. I blinked and, in that brief second, I felt a spray of warm blood across my face. Two of its spines were driven through the pale flesh of Cas’ neck easily coming out the opposite side like a needle through fabric. His mouth worked soundlessly, crimson trickling down the corners as it filled.
The Omega shuddered, nodding hurriedly. His whine was stifled in Castiel’s hand as the Alpha finished cleaning up.
Less than an hour passed before the brothers were reunited. Sam sat anxiously in his saddle waiting for Dean a little way off the road. He was close to three miles out of town to the south at a point they’d designated before getting into Jericho. Baby snuffled agitatedly as the crickets around them grew louder. Adjusting his grip on her reigns he mumbled, “I know…he should have gotten here by now.”
“Matches.”
“Uh…yeah.”
It was then that the full impact of what just happened hit us. We stood out there, foreheads pressed together, laughing and crying for what felt like ages.
“And they came here to Oregon?”
Somehow, I managed to haul myself upright, but it felt like standing on broken glass. Whimpering, I staggered over to Maggie still lying unconscious on the ground. I pawed at her face. Still no reaction. I couldn’t reach the door handle and I didn’t have much time before the witch came back. Despite it killing me to do so, I decided to leave Maggie and find a place to hide.
His hand stilled and retracted, leaving Dean panting, chasing the feeling that was suddenly withdrawn from him. Their eyes met, and Castiel saw the silent question there. In answer, he reached up and pressed two fingers against Dean’s forehead. In a second, angelic power chased through the human’s body and removed the alcohol from his system. Castiel held his breath as he watched the clarity return to Dean’s eyes.
“Shut up,” I mumbled angrily, trying desperately not to think about the argument I’d had with Sam back at the campsite. “He and I are a team! We always will be!”
“Yeah…how did you know?”
Wondering what had gotten Constance so distracted during their fight, Sam looked around. Two grave markers about ten feet away sat unevenly in the ground.
Sam’s chin trembled as he struggled not to break down. Fresh tears of my own prickled at the corner of my eyes.
He moved quicker than I could see. Suddenly, my back slammed against the wall behind me, flames making quick work of my clothes and searing my skin. I couldn’t even scream in agony, his hand clamped around my throat cut it short.
Perhaps I had a look on my face that telegraphed just how uncomfortable her signs made me, because just as we passed by, the glower on her face told me that she thought I specifically was the scum of the earth for being so glib about the fate of the world. Shaking my head, I hopped Baby onto the ‘2’ and took us back to Gorge Lake Campground.
Giving Dean a cursory glance, Joseph grumbled, “Yeah. Who’s asking?”
Trying not to be put off by Castiel standing further away from me than normal, I turned my attention on Sam. He’d just proposed that we split up. Which didn’t sound like a bad idea so long as I got to be alone. That of course wasn’t in my cards. Not with the look Sam was giving me. I could see in his forehead wrinkles that having me on my own was the last thing he wanted.
“I thought about it,” I answered softly, turning my eyes up to look at the stars.
The pair froze. Sam’s brows drew together in confusion as he struggled to process what had just been said. What Omega? Dean’s jaw dropped open in abject horror. The prostitute, smirking, pushed off the wall and slunk over to the shorter of the two and leaned in, testing the air around his neck curiously.
?” I scoffed debating whether or not I should laugh.
Sorry this update took a while. I realized I hated the direction I was going in, so I re-did like thirty pages of the story. But, lesson learned. I am going to write out each part in whole before posting. That's what I did with the first part in Diablo and I think it just works better for me. Anyhoo, because of that I will round out this second part, but I might not update again for a while after that. I will be working on it though!!
My brother huffed. If I could laugh I would. I trotted to his side and pawed at his leg, urging him to take the officer up on his offer. He shot me an annoyed look before sighing again and saying grumpily, “Fine, but you don’t do anything without our say-so.”
Numbly, I looked up. I sat in a shallow puddle of rainwater in the middle of a clearing. Rain fell into my eyes as I looked up numbly. Another loud thud came from my right and as I slowly turned my head, I saw an equally soaked Sam straddling a flailing monster as he continuously stabbed it. I noted the puncture wound in my brother's arm and the inside out shirt on his torso.
Again, he was giving me that Sam look. The one that even as a dog very clearly said, ‘
.’ Of course, she knew he would return. He promised after all.
Everyone held their breaths.
When he went and saw the “widower” while Dean was indisposed in jail, the younger Winchester was able to get the man to confess after a bit of threatening. He’d cheated on Constance and she took too much apple weed trying to “be better”. She killed her children. Drowned them in the pond nearby. When she came down from her high to find her mortified husband and what she had done, she went to the bridge and threw herself in the water. She survived, but her mind was shattered.
Getting to my feet, I nodded at Jack’s chest and asked, “So, she’s in there?”
By the time Sam reached the stables, the Stanford nightlife was just starting to get into full swing. One saloon that he passed had a pair of drunken brawlers in the center of a circle of spectators. Judging from the lack of Beta power coming from them, he surmised that the fight was more for sport than dominance. Thankfully no one paid much mind to the tall man skirting their group, and he was able to make it to where Dean waited.
Of course, we agreed. Greg, Marina, and Sai were all compliant. Arush was more than happy to get on, and held his brother close as a fresh wave of relieved sobs emerged. Breelyn was a little harder to convince. I heard her arguing with Sam, so I went over to see what the matter was. It seemed paranoia was making her angry and irrational.
A soft sob convulsed in my chest. I tried holding it back. There was still the matter of God after all. But no matter how hard I tried to will it away, sadness reigned. A small whimper escaped at first, but gradually evolved into stuttering gasps for air. My chest burned with how fierce it ached.
“This isn’t you…Cas…please…”
I could have let my mind spiral into darker and darker places, but I reminded myself that we had a job to do.
The Empty’s eyes cast around at the nothing around us worriedly.
Dean’s entire body shivered. Despite his heat being on the down turn, something in the tone of his brother’s voice had an obvious effect. He wanted to bare his neck in apology on instinct. It was similar to what he’d scented off of Sam back in Jericho. That should have bothered him more, but the direness of the situation was still mounting. Silently willing himself to man up, he hauled his little brother to his feet so they faced each other.
"Exactly."
“Nothin’ much,” the man shrugged. “More curiosity on my part.”
“Hey man, you didn’t know this was going to happen. Like you said, she was spazzing. Hard to tell if that crap is genuine.”
Amy ducked her head, fresh tears coursing down her face. Rachel put her arm around her shoulders and tugged her friend in close. Sam caught the dismissive glance from Rachel and decided to take his leave quietly.
Groaning, I sank down. "No wonder it was so damn fast."
“That’s my brother Sam.”
“Sleep,” he commanded softly.
I did, just in time to feel the bite of a dagger’s edge slice into my side. I hissed through gritted teeth. Jerking away reminded me of my charred back. The cold, wet air seeped through the burnt flesh to my core, making my body shiver uncontrollably. As he listened to the clinking sound Castiel laughed.
Green eyes met blue. For a second, Dean hesitated. Castiel could see him struggling with his vulnerability and immediately regretted pushing. To make sure he didn’t slip too far into self-doubt, Cas caught his mouth and kissed him slowly and tenderly. As apology, Castiel moved his hand from around Dean’s shaft to the edge of the blonde’s shirt and pushed it up, exposing midriff and then chest. Dean watched warily as Castiel lowered his head to one of the exposed nipples.
I paused. Cas knew Dean almost as well as I did. He knew the answer to that question. All three of us were experts when it came to getting the job done regardless of what was going on personally. Castiel locked eyes with me and I could see the silent question there; the real one.
Still looking unsteady on his feet, Eddie came over to the pair of us and said,
Trying not to choke while laughing at the look on my brother's face, I finished off my food and started gathering up our t-shirts, flannels and guns. We hit the asphalt less than thirty minutes after I woke up. Which might have been a mistake considering how much I stunk of beer and sweat. Should have showered first, but as I told Sam, if the windows were rolled down it wouldn’t be too noticeable. And besides, it was a warm June, and even if we were going to the perpetually chilly Pacific Northwest, keeping them open overnight would still feel refreshing.
“Dean…” she started; voice thick with held back emotion.
She looked spooked. Afraid that pushing her to answer might do more harm than good, Sam and I shared a look before letting it go. We rode back to the firewatch tower, reaching it just as the sunset sky started to explode with a symphony of brilliant colors. Isadora looked less shaken up as we emerged from the wilderness.
I had to live with what I’d done.
“Off the horse.” A man with grimy teeth ordered from Sam’s other side, motioning with his pistol.
Thinking back to the car ride, I thought of all that time spent digging into old reports from the area and said, “Right, so disappearances go back almost eighty years. First one in what, 1934? A, uh – a Donald Vankeaulin?”
That was a bit easier to swallow. At least we knew her and she knew something weird was going on. A wave of exhaustion rolled over me as I woofed a weak ‘yes’. Dean’s grip on the steering wheel loosened a bit, but his eyes still screamed ‘worry’.
Couldn’t really escape Sam though. Even as I pressed my forehead harder and harder against the cool glass of the window to will myself asleep, I could sense the questions building up between us. The car was silent aside from the familiar hum of the engine as we headed south. Hours passed. Somewhere around Olympia, Washington my brother finally worked up the courage to ask softly, “Seriously, what happened back in Diablo?”
The eldest Winchester watched morosely as his brother faded into the shadows of the night with the Woman in White and three goons in tow. Dean glanced from face to face at the bandits surrounding him. One, a woman, shoved a nearby compatriot and called, “I get him first, then y’all can breed him however you like!”
Sam rolled his eyes. Typical of his big brother to test him. Snatching the tools, Sam bent over and grumbled, “Keep a look out.”
goes missing, Dean…and he’s
“You think this was senseless murder and not a mate duel?” Sherriff asked carefully, circling the horse opposite the Winchesters. “If you think there’s a killer threatening my town, I have a right to know.”
“Sorry to hear that, partner.” Dean said, not wanting to push his luck. “I’ll leave you to your business, but…you happen to know where that story-spinner went after giving you a hard time?”
Sam’s tail drooped as he turned and gave me a look that said, ‘
“Perhaps the local pet store is cursed?” Cas offered. I could see dozens of options running through his mind, each one more far-fetched than the last.
“She left,” Mr. Waithe croaked, gazing listlessly about the room. “Packed up just after we identified Thomas’ body.”
“What?” I asked, clearing my throat. My numb mind was still struggling with pulling my head out of the research hole I’d been in.
He said that after I disappeared, he himself had wandered through a maze until he came upon Isadora. She monologued about the Tikbalang. How she’d found it last winter in the Philippines and smuggled it back to Diablo. After the site manager, Jacob broke up with her, she started using the creature to get back at all the people who wronged her. Eventually that evolved into who she deemed unfit to go on living: bastards, flighty party animal college kids, adulterers, abusers, etc. He was held at gun point the whole time, waiting until she was distracted by her own story that he could manage to muscle it away from her. She tried coming at him with a knife in a desperate, last ditch effort, and he shot her dead.
“There’s no ‘we’,” I cut him off, “I need you to take care of Sam. I’ve got this one.”
. When was the last time he had a heat? A thin sheen of sweat developed on his brow and he became acutely aware of the sun beating down on his shoulders.
Looking hopeful, Sam tilted his head toward Cas.
Meeting my gaze Dean said, “Looks like it stays on for now.”
When no answer came, I nodded to Sam over my shoulder as a signal to open the door. It did with a loud creak and I rushed in, checking all the corners for anyone waiting to spring on us as I did. Nothing. Sam tried the light switch but found that the power was dead. We switched on flashlights and started poking around for any clues. Not a whole lot besides tattered novels, a typewriter, small table, kitchenette, twin extra long bed. It was like a crappy apartment the size of a small hotel room.
The tip of his dagger slid into my gut, enough to be painful, but not enough to do any real damage. I whimpered as his grip tightened and he hissed, “
“There may be connections,” Sam answered evasively.
My cheeks heated angrily. It felt like he was chastising me like a kid. But before I could fire back, I bit my lip. He was right. Sam was down for the count. I couldn’t afford to burn out. Bitterly, I rubbed at my eyes once again, hoping that would give me a second wind. When that didn’t help, I grumbled, “Fine.”
He gave me a look as he took a step back like he was evaluating me for the first time since showing up. Putting up my hands in a show of peace I explained that there were reports around the town of Diablo of people smelling tobacco smoke and acting strangely.
Rubbing at my nose I cleared my throat and asked, “You got any new leads? I wouldn’t mind putting this town as far in the rearview mirror as we can by tonight.”
“Traditionally, druids only turn those that wrong them into animals or stones. It’s curious that none of the victims so far have had any enemies.” Cas answered. More to himself than us.
“Cas, you see something?” Dean asked, echoing what I was saying in my head.
I waited a moment after she left to see if Cas was going to continue worrying about Dean. He let out a defeated sigh before motioning to my laptop and asking, “What’s the case?”
Suddenly I was alone. No Sam, no blood, no Dad, no Adam. Only oppressive silence to torment me. Slowly the eerie calls of faceless beasts rose up, circling me. I couldn’t stop crying. It was pathetic and weak. Everything they were saying about me was right.
“You alright?” Dean croaked; cheek still pressed against Cas’ shoulder.
I glanced at Sam out of the corner of my eye. His brows were drawn together in such a way that I could practically see his thoughts written on them. He wanted to ask me more about what happened.
“I can only imagine.” I muttered, earning a glare from Sam.
“He wasn’t in there either.”
A high-pitched whine reached my ears. I snapped my gun and flashlight in the direction of the sound and noted the trail of blood that went in the same direction. Ready for a trap, I slowly made my way toward it. When I came around the corner, the light illuminated a shelving unit full of crates and other knickknacks, and stuffed between a replica crown and a box full of pulleys was a Cocker Spaniel, trembling.
“Dean…?” Castiel asked.
Speaking was difficult. The words felt thick and stupid on my tongue.
She remained lax and unresponsive. I noted the bowl of crushed herbs and other mystery ingredients at Maggie’s side. Definitely a witch, then. And whoever they were they weren’t around. I stowed my gun, reaching down to pick up Maggie and carry her to safety. I’d just gotten my hands on the woman’s arms when an explosion of pain erupted from the back of my head. My vision whited out for just a moment before I was able to push up from the ground and whirl around.
That was all Castiel needed. In a flash his lips were attached to the exposed skin on Dean’s neck, sucking as his hand went back to its previous place. Dean’s breath hitched and once again his back arched. Castiel noted how much more reserved the hunter was now that he was aware of his actions. The angel took it as a challenge.
With that she stormed off to the trailer to sit next to her friends.
Sam caught sight of Dean emerging from the woods close by, two pistols raised. His clothes were a mess and covered in fresh blood. Despite walking like he was drunk, there was a fire in his eyes.
“Don’t rightly know the real one. She goes by Moonchild.”
My eyes widened.
My tail started wagging in thanks. Noticing, Dean scoffed, “Yeah, whatever. If this starts going sideways, then you turn tail and run. Pun
“You okay?”
“You wouldn’t want me to do that Dean your…your eyes would burn out of their sockets.” He said, brows creasing in confusion and worry. “You know that.”
“He’s part of the investigation.” Dean cut in, shooting her a dangerous look that said ‘try me’.
” Sam said, kneeling down opposite Cas’ body from me. “
I felt nervous sweat drip from my temple as I held my breath.
He tucked me in like I was a kid, but I didn’t mind. The last person to do it had been mom. I let my body sink into the mattress as the blanket settled over my body. Sitting on the edge next to me, Cas pressed his warm hand to my chest. That’s what I liked about him. He was a master at communicating quietly. Every gesture, no matter how small, was genuine and meant something. I’d seen it when we’d first met. I think that was how I could tell he was one of the good guys.
“Awesome.” I grumbled, quickly looking down at Sam in my arms.
Castiel was right on my heels. We hopped into the Impala and headed to the motel where his car was. After that, he followed me out of town. About fifteen minutes later, I found a row of low-lying pine trees that would be perfect. I stashed Baby and hopped into the passenger seat of Cas’ car. We drove around for another twenty or so minutes before finding another spot. It was west, close to the ocean, and near enough to town that walking back wasn’t too big a deal.
I’d had it with her. Sure, she just went through something awful, but damnit she was pissing me off.
Lots of love! <3
. Whatever’s going on you need to talk about it. I mean, didn’t Cas-”
I watched as the smaller man’s eyes softened slightly around the edges. I noted his hand slowly forming a fist at his side, but he stayed quiet. Now he was giving me the silent treatment too? I thought I was going to be able to keep my nose out of it like I figured Dean would want, but seeing this, there's no way that was an option anymore.
Pushing the Deputy to the side, the Sherriff opened the journal and slammed it up where Dean’s face had been moments before. Breathing heavily, Dean peered at the worn pages and saw his name clearly written next to a series of numbers: 39 104. The blonde was careful to keep his expression neutral.
This time though, as I saw the inky black swallow my best friend, I knew it was different. He’d said as much himself. That self-sacrificing dumbass had made a deal and didn’t bother telling anyone about it until it was too late. Anger, confusion and disbelief rendered me mute as he vanished before my eyes.
Sighing, the younger Winchester hoisted his rucksack higher on his shoulder before opening the door to the boarding house. The lights were on, but it was quiet. There was no sign of anyone.
Edit: I updated this chapter, and had a hard time matching up the formatting of the new with the old. Sorry if it's distracting!
That was, of course, too much to ask for. Catching my arm, he said, "Hold on, Dean. You don't get to point your gun at my face and then walk away."
Sam nodded, face serious. Dean took the lead. The first door they checked was occupied by two people arguing. Loudly. Seemed like one of them had just made a poor deal on some cattle. The next door was quiet when they pressed ears to it. Dean knocked experimentally but no one answered. As Dean reached into his coat pocket, Sam angled his large body to block the view of what he was about to do from the hallway. Withdrawing his small packet of lockpicking tools, Dean took one look at his brother before shoving it into his chest with a smirk.
Blinking, Castiel looked at Dean and grinned, “Sorry.”
Sam peered down at Dean lightly snoring and muttered, “He’s been acting weird lately. I think I’m going to give him some space. Don’t worry, Cas. I’ll be back.”
, I thought, eyes scanning the moonlit foliage for any signs of movement. I waited, holding my breath as much as I could to better hear, but nothing happened. After a moment I wondered if it had just been another camper. There were two RVs parked across the way. Backing up suspiciously, I went to the fire and instead of getting more wood on it, I kicked dirt onto the coals and snuffed it out. Figured I should just get some more shut eye if I was imagining things.
“Damnit…” I mumbled thickly, covering my eyes with my arm as the dreaded prickling started in the corners.
Giving him a nod, I turned and started toward the Impala. As I put my hand into my pocket to pull out my keys, my cell phone started ringing. Pulling that out instead, I saw that it was Sam.
He fought back, but was no match for her strength or unpredictability.
"Fuck me, seriously?"
I watched uneasily as Helena shakily tended to my brother. All the while my mind raced. I wondered what kind of spell could not only transmute a living human into an animal, but also scramble an angel’s powers. Seems Cas had the same thoughts as he came up by my side.
Her almond shaped brown eyes glistened unexpectedly with tears. Letting her hands and the supplies fall onto the counter, her shoulders shuddered. She was trying so hard not to freak out. It reminded me of a time when I used to get overwhelmed. Back when a simple ghost had been one of the most terrifying things I could imagine.
Before I could stop myself, I licked his fingers. I meant it to be the same kind of sentiment as a pat on the shoulder or back pat. Both of us froze before he grinned stupidly, “Gross.”
Those unknown horrors that I’d fought against my whole life were finally going to get me. I wanted to see Mom. The overwhelming sound of her dying scream rose up from the darkness around me to bounce around in my head. I dropped to my knees, pressing my palms against my ears in an effort to shut it out as I curled inward like a child. I wanted to tell her how sorry I was.
Looks of confusion rippled through the crowd, but when I pulled Jack into my arms in a grateful embrace, that changed. Soon the sound of cheering and laughter bounced off the walls of the garage. In that moment I didn’t care if everyone saw. I sobbed. Cas was free. He was free just like all of us.
I pulled away from him, trying to get some distance. But his arm trapped me against his side. After a moment, the mattress shifted and my heart doubled its pace. His chest pressed against my back as he re-secured his arm. His hand gripped my shoulder above the mark he’d left pulling me out of Hell and mumbled into my ear thoughtfully, “We have not wandered the same paths, but I think there is understanding between us.”
Taking in the laptop and random papers, Dean glanced between us and asked, “So what’s the case?”
“Not everything is your fault, Dean. What happened to Sam –”
“Shut it, Cleetus and grab him!” the woman snarled, eyes flaring with Beta energy.
He sauntered off back to his wall. The others started chiming in, but all Sam wanted was to get Dean away so he could get some answers. Gripping his brother by the elbow, Sam strode purposefully to the end of the porch and made a sharp right into the nearby alley. Whoops and hollers followed after them, clearly thinking Sam was about to assert his authority over his Omega after getting riled up by jealousy. They looped around back so no one could hear them.
Taking off in a limping run again, I wound my way through the maze like a rat. Doppelganger Dad was waiting around every corner. It spoke of every painful memory that I kept locked away, hurling them at me alongside its deadly spines. I was getting tired physically and emotionally. But I could handle it. At least I thought so until I found myself in a grassy clearing.
Cas’ blue eyes suddenly locked onto my own. “I have been practicing.”
Worry clamped down on my stomach and I instinctually stepped in front of him. When I felt his hand on my arm though, I looked back and saw the look on his face. Silently, he told me it was alright and stepped around me and Sam to face the Empty.
Jack’s gap-toothed grin widened. Miracle barked from inside the Impala. Sam ran his hands through his hair, unable to stop a smile of his own from turning up the corners of his mouth in disbelief.
“Okay, we’ll work as fast as we can.”
“Don’t talk to him like that.” The first twin snapped, shooting her an intense glare.
Moving so Arush could see my face I urged, “Listen, I’m going to do everything I can to find your friends. But first I need you to tell me what happened out there.”
After that, he searched for me, using his nose to close in on the smell of tobacco. At some point he remembered to flip his shirt inside out. And it worked. He was able to pass unnoticed and snuck in behind the Tikbalang. Using the spine that had skewered his arm earlier, he stabbed the creature through the heart.
What he saw made him double over and retch.
I met his gaze again and saw the subtle line of concern that had developed between his eyebrows. It hadn’t been a question. Or a command. More of a statement.
Sam was eyeing the substantial first aid kit belted onto the back of our vehicle. I could hear him worrying. Knocking him with my elbow, he jolted to attention, eyes finding my own. Tipping my chin at our rides, I sauntered over to it and called, “I call dibs on driving!”
“You got partners; we know that.” The Deputy chimed in, her eyes slowly roaming over Dean’s trembling body. “One of ‘em’s an older feller. The other one’s the sasquatch.”
I could see the thoughts raging through Sam’s head already as he asked, “Why do you say that?”
He nodded, running his hand along the dashboard affectionately.
“Dean you don’t have to –”
The man fidgeted with the door, clearly wondering if he could shut the door on us. Once the brief thought passed, he said, “I’ve already talked with the police…”
His shoulders tensed for a moment before he stepped back and motioned silently for me to go inside. The living room dining room and kitchen were all part of one 20x10ft box. Very open concept. If a little cramped. Floyd brushed by asking quietly if I wanted something to drink and motioned for me to take a seat on the dated ‘70s couch. It smelled faintly of mothballs and pot roast.
It was at that moment that I realized we’d been sitting in the shadow of the Roadhouse. But all that fell away as I focused on my heart pounding in my ears. Slowly, I turned and caught sight of the person I’d waited so long to see. He looked exactly how I remembered him, trench coat and all, but somehow better. His blue eyes caught the light even from here. He smiled stoically.
As he gently sat me down and guided my head toward the pillow, I grumbled his name sleepily. He came close, close enough for me to smell his naturally clean scent; something like faded aftershave. Speaking quietly, he asked, “Yes, Dean?”
“With a strong scent like that, how did you get stuck in this Podunk town?” the Winchester asked, slightly breathless. “You fuck the wrong person or something?”
“Never mind,” I mumbled. Trying to change the subject I continued hurriedly, “So, back to his behavior before he ran off. Was Jacob saying or doing something in particular that struck you as out of the ordinary?”
I revved the engine, shot Cas a look of pure joy, cranked the volume and took off down the dirt road in front of us. We didn’t need wings. Baby flew just fine on her own.
Suddenly I ran straight into a solid wall of leaves that hadn’t been there a brief second before. The sharp scent of juniper assaulted my nose as I fell flat on my ass. Groaning and rubbing the spot on the back of my head that collided with the hard earth, I rolled over and glanced up at the offending shrubbery. Looking around I found that what looked like a hedge maze had sprung up around me. I was trapped.
“Gertie Fraiser, thirty-seven, works as a seamstress for a number of theaters in town.” Ivan answered with a small huff. “Two of which are the Cabaret and Allen Elizabethan Theaters where the victims disappeared from.”
Her sign nearly grazed my cheek as she raised it up. Which pissed me off. Ignoring Sam’s warning, I reached up and snatched the sign out of her hands. Hackles raising, she turned on me. I didn’t give her a chance to speak however.
He grinned, hugging me quickly one last time before jogging in the direction the others had gone. I shook my head, smiling as I followed him.
I cast around for any reason to say no, but came up with nothing. Waving at the door that led back into the bunker, I told them to go.
Their horses’ hooves became muffled as they reached the last of the cobblestone streets. Only a dusty dirt road was ahead of them now. Sam shot his brother an annoyed look, silently telling him to get along with explaining.
Without a word or a touch, he and my brother left. When they were gone, I opened my eyes, staring up at the ceiling as my hand tested my ribs. He’d healed me enough that the sharpness had been taken out of the pain. Like I’d just spent a week in bed resting properly. Now it only ached.
She seemed to want to say more, but couldn’t quite figure out how to say it. I could tell though that she was eager for this whole thing to be over and done with so she could get back to her quiet life of cutting up normal dead people.
The pistol had most likely been relieved from one of the bandits that stayed back to assault Dean. Sam didn’t want to think about what happened. He was sure Dean didn’t want to either. Checking the number of bullets, Sam waited for Dean to start returning fire again before sprinting off. As he passed his brother he said, “Hold them off. I’m going to circle around.”
“Supposedly she’s come back to get vengeance.”
Swinging down from his saddle, Dean grunted, “This is about as far as I got before.”
Taking in a deep, shuddering breath, I started slowly, “Billie had us cornered in the storage room behind some warding. I really thought we were done for. But Cas…Cas made a deal with the Empty. Before. To save Jack.”
Thankfully it seemed to work, and the people following them lost interest and dispersed. None in their group seemed to notice Sam’s sudden bristling. The sanctity of the evening had been preserved. After a beat, one of the other men in the small group caught Sam’s eye as they approached the saloon doors and waggled his eyebrows. Heat rose into Sam’s cheeks, but he smiled back all the same. Of course, Brady noticed; they were good friends after all.
The angel felt clumsy. He kept getting distracted by every noise and movement that the hunter clutching onto him was making. He knew exactly what to do with the green-eyed hunter. He had witnessed thousands of years of fornication of all kinds. The problem was that it was Dean. Everything he did was unique and new.
Fear shot through my body like a bullet. Instantly I was kneeling, prodding his side experimentally. He whimpered, then snapped at my hand. I yanked my fingers clear just in time. I could tell by the literal puppy-dog look on his face that he didn’t mean to. I shook my head, silently telling him there was nothing to forgive.
Just as the blanket slipped from his shoulders, the woman lurched toward him. His reflexes were dulled by his heat, but his stubborn determination was enough to sidestep her grasping fingers. Dean’s fist collided with her abdomen, earning him a soft grunt of pain. It wasn’t a powerful blow. His strength was fading by the second. Blinking in an effort to clear his eyes and mind, Dean staggered back from another hand trying to snatch the collar of his shirt.
“Is this about your father?” she asked, voice quiet with concern. “Is he alright?”
He could have pushed past me easily. But his large blue eyes turned to me in question. I shook my head, silently telling him we would do more harm than good if we were to go out there right now. I could see that it pained Cas, but reluctantly he turned and headed back toward the Impala. I stood for a moment, worry knitting my brows together. Something really was wrong if Dean wasn’t trying to pick a fight or get stupid drunk.
Sam and Maggie were completely distracted by Claire. She’d managed to dig out a worn tennis ball from somewhere and was currently throwing it for them to chase after and compete over in the backyard. It was a little worrisome that he was delving so deep into his newfound canine side, but I couldn’t do much about it. Not with a new case and no idea how to reverse the spell.
Working quickly, the three of them started fastening their gun belts to their hips. Glancing at Dean the Sherriff asked, “You gotta use the pot?”
When Joel suggested we split up, my initial reaction was to say ‘no’.  I started to turn away from the rows of set design items to do just that, but caught sight of a puddle on the cement almost obscured behind one of the stored set pieces. It looked like coffee.
He lobbed the lantern over his head, roaring in pain and anguish. The scream tore at his throat as glass smashed against the body parts littering the wood floor, exploding oil and flames. The bodies ignited. Angrily, the fire swelled, moving to engulf the base of the wall to climb higher.
Patting me one last time on the head, Castiel turned to Ivan and Helena and asked, “What do you know about Gertie?”
“Right, weird question, know anything about interesting folklore for the area?” I cut in.
For a moment, his statement had the desired effect of surprise. And then I remembered the girl from Bellingham that Floyd had spoken about.
We watched my brother’s sweat-soaked back in silence as he stalked away. Turning to Castiel I gave him an apologetic look. Ignoring that, he asked, “What happened?”
For a moment, the angel didn’t move. Dean shifted awkwardly under the unbroken gaze, glancing around before settling once again on the intense blue of Castiel’s eyes. Still without speaking, the dark-haired man calmly strode across the room, and laid his jackets at the foot of the bed. Then, he strode around to the other side and pulled down the covers.
“Cas?” I asked after a moment, realizing that he'd fallen silent.
Her hands immediately released. She blinked as if she wasn’t sure what just came over her. Dean held back the urge to whine as the heat from her hands vanished. He immediately scolded himself for wanting to submit to his Omega instincts in this kind of a situation, but it didn’t change the fact that he was semi hard.
"Sammy and I are tracking down a Tikbalang. You know anything about them?"
“Okay,” he waved his hand, clearing his throat and thinking about how he was going to communicate with me. “Sorry. How about one bark for yes, two for no?”
The hands at her side curled into fists as her shoulders hunched. I could see her muscling through the urge to cry. Sammy would say that it wasn’t healthy and she needed to let it out, but when I saw something like that, I thought of how strong someone had to be because that’s exactly what I do. It wasn’t easy. And a part of me admired her for that stupid courage and made me feel validated, like I wasn’t so out of line doing it myself.
“Yeah,” Sam answered softly.
“Talk and then I’ll put down my gun.”
his family was so intricately woven into was dangerous. One of the last hunts that Sam went on before leaving, Dean had gotten hurt pretty bad. A stray bullet caught him in the shoulder. A few more inches down and it would have hit his heart and he would have been dead before he hit the ground.
“Maxine. Maxine Byers.” She huffed. Faintly, I could pick up another voice in the background that sounded annoyed. After a moment she continued, “You and I worked that witch doctor case in New Orleans.”
“Thanks, Cas…” I muttered, fingers gripping the door frame I stood next to tightly.
“No, but I bet once we get back, we can use what the kids told us to narrow it down.”
As soon as the angel’s fingers touched the leather though, he recoiled in pain.
She started at the sound of my voice, as if she'd forgotten we were there. Turning her large brown eyes on us she stuttered, "S-sorry, I think my...my eyes are playing tricks on me."
“What does that mean?”
The brunette did as he was told, still keeping his hands up. When he was on the ground, the same bandit tugged Sam’s own pistol from its holster. The others closest to Dean grabbed fistfuls of the blanket around the blonde’s shoulders and dragged him unceremoniously from Baby. Sam made a move to go to him, but was once again stopped by a pistol in the face.
Thankfully the ride to the first victim’s house was quiet. I let out a happy sigh as we emerged from the Impala and headed up to the front porch. The pair of us stood before the navy-blue door while the bell echoed through the house, announcing our presence. A middle-aged man, small in stature, opened the door. Mr. Waithe. His small pale eyes were rimmed with red and moved sluggishly as he looked us over. We held up our badges in unison while Sam performed introductions.
Once inside, he set Dean down and guided his head back onto the pillow. Soft snores rose up as Castiel stepped away, studying him. He looked younger, less troubled when he slept. The angel liked seeing him like this.
I glanced down at the woman. Under her trembling arms and the blood, I could spot some deep gashes running across her abdomen. She had the traumatized thousand-yard stare I’d seen on so many others. Patting Eddie on the shoulder in a comforting manner I mumbled, “Good job, we’ll take it from here.”
At some point I woke up enough that I noticed healing energy pulsing familiarly through my ribs. Cas had pulled off onto the shoulder so he could reach back to where I lay. I didn’t move or say anything. Pleased with the small bit he accomplished, he waited for Sam to crawl back and curl up with me before pulling back out onto the highway. I shouldn’t be so stubborn about getting help. I knew that. I should thank him. But it was hard.
“You mean you saw what the Tikbalang made him see?” I asked, going back to that night and wondering if Castiel knew that Dean had been clutching a vision of his dead body in the end.

He collapsed, gasping, as shouts rose up from the other bandits. Constance staggered in their direction, clutching her shoulder.
The overwhelming heat, the roar of flames, the pressure of Castiel’s powerful grip on my throat, all vanished. My eyes shot open and I found myself back in the clearing I’d started in. Castiel was still there, glaring at me from only a few inches away. But something else was restraining me. Stabbing pain came from both my hands and feet. Glancing over I saw a thick metal rings piercing straight through my palms. Blood trickled slowly from the holes. It was attached to a chain that extended up into the canopy and out of sight.
