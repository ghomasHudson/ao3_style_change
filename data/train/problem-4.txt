Sherlock in return hinted at a smile, before laying his eyes again on Hamish’s face, undecided on whether to keep him in his arms or whether to place him in the wicker basket.
-He asked me to start working with you again" Greg explained.
Okay, maybe the tremor was also because he was there on the dancefloor with Sherlock Holmes, the last person he would have believed interested in dance.
Sherlock was sitting in his usual seat around the table, Misha sitting on his lap, a hard-plastic plate filled with half of the baby's breakfast and a cup of coffee for the adult not far away.
But now he was tired of fighting... Above all, he didn't see the point.
-Mycroft may be a bastard, I agree, but he would never have done something like that, especially not today.
Harry chuckled.
Returning to his steps, he opened it and found inside the necessary to change Hamish, with a clean diaper wet wipes and a tube of Vaseline cream, a spare onesie and a bottle with what surely at the time of leaving the house was boiling water and a scoop of powdered milk placed hermetically under the latex teat.
I wanna thank every reader that left kudos, a comment and simply read this fiction; as always you are STARS!
Sherlock nodded briefly.
Greg shook his head, lowering his gaze.
-Long. Tomorrow will be even longer...-simply said the other man.
John breathed deeply a couple of times and concluded: there could only be one person behind what was going on.
"Of course I want you" Sherlock said, accompanying every word with a kiss, making John smile.
"You're going to be all mine" said John, standing up and approaching the detective, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
John nodded, then a silhouette caught his eye, causing him to clench his jaw in a harsh expression.
-Why is this woman suddenly important?
, her mother used to say.
Before John could find an appropriate answer, Sherlock was again in front of him, in his personal space, the muscular body pressed against him from his chest to his hips, both hands against the door at the height of the doctor's blonde head.
Sherlock had never had the slightest doubt that John would be an exceptional father, but he had estimated that a longer period of adjustment would be necessary, but he had to think again.
As every morning, John made his way to the kitchen to put the kettle on, surprised to find it already hot and ready; turning his head slightly, he glanced at the detective who deliberately avoided meeting his gaze.
The man nodded.
This Web Page was Built with PageBreeze
Trying to help his brother, Harry had begun the recovery program to stop drinking and had pushed John to do the same, turning it into a competition.
The worst part is that I miss him so much...
"Let me go" he said on that angry note that had accompanied their entire conversation.
John sighed.
-As far as I know he might as well be here...-
Several times he had drawn upon himself the incredulous, sometimes horrified, gaze of passers-by who had heard him talk about murders with a newborn, but as always he had answered that look carelessly: Hamish was his son, he understood perfectly why he was telling those stories and given the lack of complaints, Sherlock could say quietly that Hamish loved those stories almost as much as he did.
So he had walked the streets of London, finally free, without having to look over his shoulder every moment in search of snipers or assassins who might be on his trail.
John lay down on his side, his elbow folded to support the weight of his body and observed Hamish and how he accompanied his every move with a continuous mumble, almost a commentary of his actions for those around him, so that his actions were clear and easily understandable to all.
There was no other explanation.
Sherlock remained silent, torn between having new information and asking him the next question; fortunately, John made the decision for him.
The man had listened to him in silence and thanks to the nervous pulsing of the vein on his neck, Sherlock knew he was right.
"DAD!" Hamish exclaimed as he stood up from the bench and ran to him to be caught in his arms.
I packed my bag and came here- said pouring himself a double whiskey.
When he finally managed to see the long silhouette of the detective in the crowd of children, nannies, parents and tourists who crowded the main entrance of the Zoo a smile automatically stretched out John’s lips.
"Don't waste the second chance you've been given" she said, walking to  the door-Turn off the lights when you leave” she said before leaving the morgue.
His brother had stopped by the apartment just long enough to leave him everything he had left behind at the Watson's house and put Hamish in his crib.
John was certain that if he checked under the mattress, he would still find the pornographic magazines he used to hide there as a teenager.
That morning, after leaving Harry's apartment, the doctor had phoned Mrs. Hudson to have the certainty that Sherlock had already left, so that he could return to Baker Street to wear a new pair of jeans, combined with a clean shirt and sweater.
Felling much better, Sherlock placed his lips on the blonde's neck, determined to show him his gratitude and love, laying small kisses that relaxed John and enticed him to move his head slightly to show more of his neck.
If you want I can...-reply the waiter, watching helplessly as the trio settled around the table.
I wanted to be in a punk rock band, like the Sex Pistols- he confessed, remembering that naive childhood dream.
"Are you sure you have time for tea before you leave?" asked Sherlock, the kettle in one hand.
John laughed and put his forehead against the detective's shoulder, feeling the vibrations of Sherlock's low laugh, trembling pleasantly when a hand caressed his short hair and back.
-Who am I to deny you this wish? -
It takes a while to come to terms with this news- said Greg trying to make him understand.
-John this is Daniel, Dan this is the friend I told you about- Greg said making the introductions.
-Okay. If you can really get the machine, then you can do the exam-granted Boss.
Unable to take his eyes off the couple, Greg lingered with his eyes for a few moments, wondering why the universe was ganging up on him like that, putting in front of his eyes a concrete evidence that his partner would be a perfect father, just as his head continued to wreak havoc because of that unexpected and forbidden desire.
So, he had carried on with his life as if nothing had happened.
"I'm waiting for you outside" he said, turning his back on the two of them and heading for the door.
An incredulous expression instantly appeared on Molly's face as the woman sat in a stiffer position on the sofa, as if it had been her posture that made him discover her secret.
A hinted smile and the defensive attitude that Mycroft had taken so far almost magically disappeared.
- I could pretend to be your partner, so at least the reporters would stop asking you questions about you and Sherlock, or at least about a possible relationship between you two-explained Jack.
Then the affair and the divorce had come and for a long time in his life there had been only work.

(See the end of the chapter for
This time John's laughter was louder, echoing for a few moments in the restaurant.
Will he have to wait any longer?
-Be good, eat your vegetables, brush your teeth and get out of the shower when Uncle John asks me, don't stay up late...- said the little girl as if it were a song.
Personally I was bored and I think he was worried because his plans were progressing slowly: it had been almost two years since his Fall and he expected to have almost completed his task, while he was still halfway.
The feeling of being observed that had accompanied him in those last days, in that moment was amplified: the complete attention of the two Holmes brothers was focused on him and that conversation.
John swallowed and then met his eyes.
I get so emotional, baby
For a moment he lingered with his finger on the doorbell of the apartment now occupied only by John: was it still broken, or had the doctor in the meantime bothered to have it fixed?
Mrs. Hudson nodded.
This time it was the woman’s turn to sigh in frustration.
It was unthinkable that the dear and unassuming John Watson had become impossible to decipher.
Anthea again turned to him with her small smile and, without saying anything, turned and walked toward the elevators, forcing Greg to hurry up to narrow the distance between them.
John's face opened into an amused smile.
Emma shrugged.
Without dissolving their stare, Sherlock drank the rest of the whiskey, swallowing slowly and observing the blush spreading over John's cheeks.
"I can see your secretary is not nosy at all...” Jack said ironic.
"Okay, I need to control your blood pressure, so I need silence for a few moments.”
-Has there been anything unsual in the last few weeks? - asked John professionally, pointing the light into the girl's right and then left eye.
Only once had he had a similar experience, with an opponent he considered his equal and who over time had proved fundamental to his fight.
As Jack had told him the day before, many of the boys approached John and offered to pay him a drink, and the man had a smile and a kind word for everyone.
"Oh, shut up, I'm trying to make you part of my life" his sister scolded him.
"Apparently you're even more stupid than I thought" said Sherlock, unable to accept those words.
I wanted your trust.
And guilt reappeared back to the pit of his stomach, as overbearing and fierce as during the first year.
The blonde kissed him slowly, enjoying that moment before pulling away and smiling at him.
"It's Lestrade" John said a little breathless.
But those three years had fostered so many changes that made it impossible to hide behind that lie.
He wasn't ready to go home yet.
This is the last chapter of this Fiction... I hope you had fun reading it, as much as I had fun writing it and traslating it.
Jealous of that smile that had not been caused by his deductions or his mere presence, but by two perfect strangers who had nothing to do with him and John.
) that stopped right in front of the landing of the apartment.
Upon their arrival they were greeted by a housekeeper, whom Sherlock called Myrtle and from whom he was called Lock, despite being in his forties, causing an amused smile on John and Emma’s lips and causing the detective to turn a pretty shade of pink.
You went on to travel the world solving the biggest puzzle I'd ever seen without stopping for a moment to think of the poor idiots you had left behind...-he shouted at him.
John smiled: it was well known that Sherlock had no idea how attractive he was.
And then there was Irene.
_____________________________
-Ice cream or popcorn, it’s your choice-answered the man.
An answer that once again demonstrated how ignorant his brother could be in the matters of the heart.
Nothing would have given him back those three years; nothing would diminish the anger, guilt or all the feelings that stirred within him at the mere thought of Sherlock.
Hi, Jack…-
Something had happened, something that had upset Lestrade and clearly had something to do with Emma... not with Emma, with children in general.
"Isn't it slightly inappropriate?"asked Tommy, looking at John whose face was red in anger.
Now for the first time he could take his time and observe every little detail of
John chuckled in turn, before recomposing.
How could he do that to him? How could he have been so cruel disregarding completely his feelings?
"What is it?" he asked.
Baby Girl smiled again, happy to be able to enjoy those little displays of affection exclusively for a few more weeks before having to share them with the rest of the world.
They would take my little girl away from me- she answered promptly.
Beneath him, the black-haired man moved in his sleep, unconsciously moving his arm until it rested around John's shoulders, and once sure it wasn't a dream, he rubbed a cheek against the doctor's hair.
-I know, we're the boring ones- John commented without acrimony.
-My…-John said to him before he cleared his throat. -My exes always found it revolting, so I always hid it- he explained, avoiding his gaze.
She too, like John, at first glance had been attracted to the child starting to speaking with him in the usual child talk, but once she realized John's absence from the apartment and became aware of the child’s genetic heritage, her expression had turned into a total disapproval.
The girl nodded, her eyes shiny again, before casting one last look at the monitor.
But how could he know?
-Would you like to go with me? - John asked him.
Suddenly a small laugh rang out in the living room, prevailing in John's ears over the deafening noise of his own heartbeat; the doctor ended the kiss and, with confused eyes turned and looked around for the origin of the noise, meeting Hamish sitting a few yards from them.
Irene smiled almost softened by his words.
"I would never do that!" Baby Girl replied almost hysterically.
"The other times?"- John interrupted him.
-What does that mean? -
"Someone has to be" said John, trying not to focus too much on the first part of the talk.
But we have created a life that reassures us and adapts to our needs... Without which we have shown that we are lost or able to barely function-
And there in that room, in the midst of a crowd of men engaged in dancing or exchanging foreplay, John gave him his special smile, the one that was only for him, before canceling the slightest distance between them by touching with the tip of his nose the clean-shaved cheek of the detective, his nose, to finally join their lips.
"I don't even know if we're a couple now... - he murmured.
"Do you always ask the same questions?" Greg asked. -It's late, it's freezing, and I have a feeling that you have a long night ahead of you.
John lowered his head slightly, enjoying the thrill that that single word had unleashed along his back, before encountering Sherlock’s gaze again.
-Today Emma and I were supposed to spend the day together: Mary is busy with a Japanese delegation and had given me an extra day to be with Emma; we had planned all day, but I was called back to work...-explained the man.
The two brothers returned to the living room and sat opposite each other on the couch, sipping their tea in the silence of the room for a few moments.
He walked to the small staff room and made himself a tea, pulling his cell phone out of his pocket.
-Oh God... I need a whiskey! -
Sherlock remained silent, after all it was something Mycroft and Molly had already told him in other contexts.
Clearly intrigued, John leaned to the middle of the table still clear of plates at the moment and met Sherlock’s gaze almost daring him to read the small and insignificant elements that were "obvious" on his face and on his clothes and to list his deductions.
Have I ever backed down in the face of danger? - John asked him.
-He continued to live in Baker Street despite Greg and Harry offering him a place to stay, just because that apartment is the only connection he has with you.
-Is that so?
John nodded.
Sherlock, clearly too lost in his own thoughts and jealousy to notice any difference, slightly tilted his head to the right, as if he were considering John's words.
Letting himself be guided by the rhythm, Sherlock lowered his head and stroked the curve of his neck with the tip of his nose, breathing deeply the scent of sandalwood, oil and disinfectant that he had always connected to John, feeling a shiver running down John's back, followed the next moment by a strong callous hand that rose upwards to get lost in his black curls, sinking his hand as he had done the night before in a more private atmosphere.
Just thinking of the detective's name reminded him of the presence of the scarf in the right pocket of his jacket and led him to turn around again and take the few steps that separated him from Greg, who observed him surprised.
"There's something else in the box" Jack said.
-Do you see all those people who are walking down the street? They are all going home after a day's work; fifty per cent of them will find a spouse waiting for them, twenty per cent a partner, ten per cent a roommate and another ten per cent a pet and the rest just an empty apartment.
-I don't know why you came here before you went to Baker Street, but you're not here to congratulate me on my wedding.
John sighed.
-The park? Do you mean Bletchely Park? -John interrupted her in disbelief - Your husband was a war hero! -he exclaimed in disbelief.
We had prepared an elaborate plan not to be discovered, but when we came face to face with her, Irene knew perfectly well who we were and welcomed us completely naked, trying to make Sherlock uncomfortable.
The man arched an eyebrow at those words, sinking his hands into the pockets of the corduroy pants.
____________________________
-But...- tried to replicate the detective.
The smile on John's face grew bigger, before giving Sherlock another quick kiss, stroking the inside of his upper lip with the tip of his tongue.
Sherlock paid the cab driver and waited for John to join him again before heading down a side street until he stopped in front of a restaurant.
The young waiter nodded his head and turned his back on them, clearly headed to the kitchens in search of Angelo.
-Well, at least we took a step forward-John commented temporarily bringing their attention to the waiter who at that moment stopped at their table.
"-Did you ever tell her about me? -he decided to ask.
-Sergeant... - greeted the man.
The week that had just begun would be difficult, he was aware of it, but now he could not hold back: the next day there will be the press conference to announce the return to the world of living of Sherlock Holmes and a few days later there would be John’s ceremony.
"If this is your London home, I can only imagine what the Mansion is like" he said.
Overwhelmed by Sherlock’s charm, John swallowed closing his eyes as his fingers gripped the detective's black hair to prevent him from pulling his face away, just as silence fell.
-Sherlock-greeted him in return, trying to keep the tone of his voice neutral.
The two men continued to walk in silence until they reached Albert Bridge, one of the few English bridges whose passage was reserved exclusively for pedestrians and public transport.
You both suffered because of the feelings you had for me and the same happened to Irene: she tried to use me to achieve her purpose, to gain some advantage against my brother, but her feeling towards me was her undoing-
“Well, the knuckleheads are two...” John commented, handing a sweet cracker to Hope before looking at his friend.
"I'm so angry with you right now" John said in a whisper before caressing Sherlock’s earlobe with the tip of his tongue.
Mycroft gave him a small and awkward smile and took off his coat and shoes, placing them neatly at the entrance alongside the briefcase.
He understood what had caused that nagging sensation at the base of the neck that had tormented him all morning.
"Come inside" she said, stepping aside.
"Are you telling me it's clearly written on my face that I'm a cop?" asked Greg.
Sherlock heard Molly smile and turned his head towards her, meeting her gaze.
-I got all the cameras on the Vauxhall Bridge.
"Nice to meet you" John said, continuing to smile. "Can I take a look at your eye?" John asked him kindly.
"Because, luckily for you, you didn't meet our interesting boyfriends" he replied with a smile.
_______________________________________
Every morning, as he entered the kitchen to make his breakfast before going to work, John found Sherlock sitting in his chair or slouched on the couch.
A stunned expression appeared on the face of the man who in shock,  dropped his mobile phone to the ground.
-I'm not sorry-
He recalled the peculiar smell he had smelled in Sherlock's inexplicably fluffy hair, and how he understood his responsibility to that child for the first time, the need to protect him and keep him safe at all costs.
-Perfect. I’ll call Jack. Eight o’clock? - John asked.
_______________________________________
For now, I can only thank you one more time each one of you that read, left kudos and a comment to this story... You are shining stars! <3
John nodded slowly, unable to speak for a few moments, taking a new sip from his glass and focusing on his own food before giving her a friendly smile.
The vibration of his mobile phone on the mahogany desktop pulled him away from his thoughts and led him to cast a glance on the iPhone screen.
"When it comes to normal relationships, yes, but it's the first time I’m with   a genius" he said.
-Don't be nervous, see how this date goes, do your best to make it unforgettable and most importantly have fun.
During that long speech John had remained silent, his gaze fixed on the other man face, interrupting the monologue only a few times to get more information or to voice his indignation at the villainousness shown by the detective on some occasion.
The other looked at him with an arched eyebrow, concentrating in that one gesture all his sarcasm.
I was the one who forced him to eat, to sleep, to help him overcome his nightmares, who slept with him and who sometimes went to clubs with him, but he was always careful not to show too much or expose too much of himself.
-Ok, why don't we all calm down?- John interrupted them turning to Greg and looking for his friend's gaze. - Why don't you go out and smoke a cigarette?- he proposed.
I was a very good cicerone! I also managed to get the London Eye open after closing time just for us.
What had impressed him the most was the wall above the sofa.
Did Micheals wanted to make him realize that John had move on? To make him understand the attraction and complicity that the two men had?
Do you have any idea what I had to put up with the journalists, the lies and my miserable life?
The woman held on to that look for a few moments before deciding to speak again.
"He is fun" Emma promptly replied.
They had not made any changes to fit each other, there had been no bargaining (except of course the one in Bart's lab when they met) ... They had simply slipped into each other's lives, fitting together perfectly.
Why did you kept all my stuff, all my clothes, but you refused to say my name all these years? - "
For the first time since returning home, Sherlock thought back on that day when he stood on the roof ledge of Barts Hospital looking down at John for the last time before launching himself into the void and leaving behind everything important in his life.
I spent the last three years of my life with the regret that I didn't do enough to convince you to come down, to join me outside, for not understanding what was going on, for calling you a machine the last time we spoke.
John didn't give him that honor.
-If I am not a complete failure with this procedure, in thirteen weeks you will have a little girl-John said to her in a reassuring tone, aware of all the difficulties that Baby Girl would have to face immediately after giving birth.
"Would you like a cup of tea?" asked Sherlock, promptly heading to the kitchen.
-I could put him in foster care.
-I think your ideas are terribly interesting, but maybe it's better to wait for Hamish to be asleep- John commented.
-Long story short, the bullet damaged some nerves in the right shoulder and the fifteen minutes of stand by brought severe blood loss and as a result, favored septicaemia.
The waiter appeared at their table delaying Irene's response for a few moments during which the woman poured herself a cup of tea and added two teaspoons of sugar, not at all annoyed by the silence that dropped between them and John's piercing gaze fixed on her.
"John…" he whispered, trying to cling to that one certainty as the world around him quickly vanished.
"What a shame" she said a little bit sad.
Greg rubbed his face with one hand and called himself an idiot for the umpteenth time.
-Mycroft.
Life at 221B Baker Street returned to normal.
Despite the signs that years of alcohol abuse had left on her face and, surely, on her body, Harriet Watson hadn't touched a drop of alcohol in almost two years.
-Not yet. You are the first person I see in London, if we exclude my brother-
Once again, the two men looked at each other and in that brief moment, as a thousand silent words and a thousand silent promises were uttered, Sherlock had no doubt: John Watson would still take a bullet for him to be sure of having him still by his side.
Once in their bedroom, John pushed lightly on Sherlock's shoulders until the man was seated on the edge of the bed; but before John could make any move, Sherlock's lips rested on the doctor's abs, mouthing the rib line, biting the soft skin of his navel before sinking his tongue into it.
Three days after closing the case of the modern Romeo and Juliet, John was sitting on the couch in his pajamas, laptop on his lap, busy writing a new blog post about the case of the two lovers.
They had only taken a couple of steps when a sudden thought crossed John's mind.
-No, I don't think so... My roommate didn't send me any text all night, that may mean that everything is fine or that my apartment exploded in an attempt to fight boredom, but I think I can stay out a little longer" he said, smiling wryly at Sherlock.
Gaining more confidence, he sat down and took Hamish in his arms, sitting him on his crossed legs, supporting his back with one hand, immediately encountering the gaze of the child who did not seem intent on abandoning him.
In an almost incorporeal gesture, John raised a hand and moved it behind Sherlock's neck, bringing the man's face closer to his own, bringing their lips together in a violent kiss.
John shook his head and turned that small smile at the detective, sure that it would be enough to reassure him.
"You don't know how nice it is to see your ugly face" said John, standing up and hugging his friend.
It was the same that transpired, sometimes, in John's voice, thought Jack letting go of an ironic smile.
On a first look, he was a boring and ordinary person, a man grow older ahead of time with his cardigans, his ugly sweaters and his loafers.
"Did you think no one would miss you?"asked his mother again.
Sherlock moved quickly into the living room, approaching the door, grabbing his own coat and John's.
-If that was your goal, then why aren't you with him? -
Was he supposed to close five years, no eighteen months of life in common, now that he was one step away from getting everything he wanted?
-John-.
"However, Alastair saw something in me, something that convinced him to help me with my studies and later led him to encourage me to continue my career, despite having two children and we were both two very busy people”
-Do you think I can finally ask him a few questions? - Jack asked, ripping him out of his thoughts.
-Usually muscle irritations are an impediment during sexual intercourse-said Sherlock, interrupting the silence.
He had thought carefully about the chasm that had opened within himself when he discovered John's drug-addicted past, his suicide attempts, and the real possibility of not finding him upon his return.
-Why doesn't Sherlock ever talk about his father? Or you? -asked John, unable to curb his own curiosity.
Mr. Watson sighed and stared at John for a few seconds before speaking.
Sherlock allowed himself a slight smile before making a small bow with his head.
Every time that thought ran through his mind, John couldn’t hold back a  sad smile: how could he be grieving?
But if he was honest with himself, Sherlock knew that what brought him there was those stupid conversations and teases of which he had been subjected over the last few days.
Emma chuckled at those words, letting herself go under the water's surface for a few moments before re-emerging as if she were a fish.
I've stolen three years of your life; all I can offer you in return is time-
It was the first time Sherlock had referred to Molly as a "
Sherlock stood in front of the window, his shoulders at the two men, obviously focused on his brother's words.
-SHERLOCK SHUT UP! STOP IT! -  exclaimed John unable to hold back further.
Those words had hurt him more than he even wanted to admit to himself.
-These are household names - he answered her at the end.
It would have been easy, and reckless, to throw oneself headlong into that new adventure, but to face a relationship without first laying the groundwork or talking extensively about what they expected from each other, would have led only to a painful break-up.
-So, Mr. Holmes... You haven't answered my question before.
Once again Irene had managed to turn their lives upside down.
More compliant.
And instead he had stood there, staring at that ledge to watch him die, almost as guilty as Moriarty.
Sherlock merely nodded.
In silence, John sustained the icy-blue look of his partner sitting in front of him.
Was it a kick or a quick movement in your belly? - John asked her in a professional tone, but with his warm, affable voice.
After taking his mug from the cabinet and putting in a bag of English Breakfast tea, John poured in the boiling water and left the drink infused, focusing on preparing the second part of his breakfast.
-R-really? -
"It's because I love you that I'm trying to help you" he said.
Only an idiot would apply the rules of feelings to a man like Sherlock Holmes who, by his own definition, considered feelings "useless and superfluous".
"You have to work on your pickup lines" Daniel said, breaking the silence as soon as the waiter walked away.
-You've gained a few pounds since the last time we saw each other and you're usually not the kind of person who tends to gain weight easily, your eyes twinkle every time you look at Hamish, probably imagining your baby, and to conclude I can see from your open bag a recipe for vitamins that are prescribed only during pregnancy- Sherlock explained all in one breath, as usual.
Mycroft met his gaze for the second time since entering the apartment.
Certainly not for me that I spent two years dealing with car thefts and burglaries, for you that had to travel the world becoming a killer, or for John...-
Before Sherlock could retort, Emma followed her father into the apartment, taking the detective by surprise (
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
-This woman is even dumber than the first one... Sherlock commented.
"I think his absence is a very good answer to your question" Sherlock said without looking at her.
-It's addressed to you John.
It was actions like this one that left John speechless and showed him how far the detective had come from their first meeting in an analysis lab at Bart's Hospital.
-When I met Alastair, I was a student and he was a professor of biology and chemistry, the kind of courses women were not allowed to attend, because they were deemed useless for our future as mothers and family wives...-commented with a sarcastic grimace that so many times the doctor had seen on Sherlock's face.
____________________________
Sherlock nodded.
He knew that something like this could happen during his absence.
You said you'd be gone for a few more days and... I'm happy to see you again- Greg said, quickly covering the distance between them and sitting next to his man on the couch.
"What do you think you’re doing?" Greg asked, holding Sherlock’s gaze despite the obvious difference in height.
-Oh John... You're so English sometimes-commented Sherlock snorting amused.
Sherlock nodded his head, taking a few steps in that still so familiar environment despite years of absence.
Feeling observed, the detective looked in his direction and their eyes met for a few moments, before the doctor returned to the screen where Amy and Rory were fleeing from a horde of Weeping Angels.
I know I'm going to have to start split my time again between the clinic and being your assistant, but if I've managed to do it in the past, I think I can do it again.
The boy stared at him for a few moments, looking for another answer in his face.
At that moment he hated everything and everyone... He just wanted to be home, in his own bed and sleep for ten hours straight.
Mycroft let out a small sigh from his disclosed lips.
"I thought I heard the doorbell" he said, welcoming Jack with a smile.
It had only happened a few times and he was not proud of it...
Did the man with whom he had seriously considered spending the rest of his life really consider him capable of cheating?
"They have to find something to do, since Kate decided to stay at the palace this week" said Jack.
“I will Dad”
"Ah Sherlock, that's really petty" Greg scolded him, looking back at the detective.
"You don't believe me, do you?" he asked, his gaze fixed on the man on the other side of the desk staring at him silently for a few moments.
-No... I don't think it works like that-
The tense atmosphere that had descended for a few moments in the apartment seemed to dissolve instantly, allowing Greg and John to resume breathing normally.
Not when there was a perfectly functioning and empty room upstairs.
Jack stared at him for a few moments before nodding, hinting a smile.
An idea immediately sprang to his mind, but he drove it away insistently.
-I'm sorry about the mug, but my mother was a fan of the Queen Mother-said John, looking at the two cups on which the elderly Queen's placid, smiling face was painted.
"How many times has he managed to find your bugs?" he asked curiously.
-I got two tickets to see Les Miserables.
Molly looked up from the folder she was examining and stared at the detective, still intent on studying the sample.
-I don't think it's ideal for lunch, but maybe I can think about it, if someone will behave well...-replied John.
Sherlock nodded, observing how the man's face instantly calmed himself at the mere certainty of walking away from that room and the talk they would have.
Instantly recomposing his armor, Sherlock erased any trace of disturbance from his face, and with a fluid and elegant move he stood up, leaving his plate half full on the table, moving toward the living room.
-You knew I was coming, and you can always kick me out by 00 Agents anyway.
"Wow" he said, making Scotland Yard officers open their mouths in shocked surprise.
It came from a different angle, completely unexpected, and I was so focused on my patient...
Especially after Sherlock's words.
Mr. Hubbert, the owner of the hardware store recognized him almost immediately, engaging him in a conversation that kept him busy for ten minutes going back over all the major stages of his adolescence and giving him news of Samantha, his daughter, one of John's conquests, before asking him what he was doing in his shop.
-In the kitchen... God forbid we get blood on the couch-Greg said making way for the two men.
"It's a good thing you didn't want to brag about it" John said snickering.
Without even realizing it, his feet had led him to Baker Street and, after a few moments of groping in which he searched his pockets pointlessly for his keys, he found himself forced to knock on the door.
If it was Mike who died suddenly, perhaps attempting suicide, John would have been sorry, he would have missed him, but he would not have come to destroy himself physically and psychologically as he had done with Sherlock's suicide.
"I've got to go out for a while" he said, facing the detective's back.
Sherlock sank his hands into the deep pockets of the Belstaff and nodded.
"Ready to join the parade again?” John asked turning towards Greg and Hope.
-Harry-said Jack.
Moving with unexpected gentleness, Sherlock let himself go backwards until his head was again on the pillow, John's hot body against him, despite the sticky proof of his pleasure that was fast cooling between them.
He wrapped his arm around Hamish's back pressing him lightly against himself and brought his gaze to the baby's face, once again encountering his icy-blue eyes that looked at him serene and confident: how could he trust him so completely even though he had met him just an hour ago?
"Is it official then? “asked John, his voice slightly broken, his forehead against Sherlock's.
And he also has a more than a valid explanation for this trick...
They weren't friends, not yet, but that day had shown that with a little goodwill from both, they could be friends again.
-You're a man that people love from the first meeting and who cares about others: me, Hamish, Lestrade, your colleagues at the clinic... You even care about  my brother, for some strange and inexplicable reason- Sherlock said, making John smile. - After the birth you'll be even more worried about the fate of Baby Girl and her baby-added.
In that kiss there was the promise of nights spent together, in each other’s arms, of hours spent exploring each other’s body until there were no more secret, until he knew every scar, every slight imperfection as if it were imprinted on his own skin.
The expression that was initially serious, prepared for the worst on John's face, had slowly turned into an incredulous expression as Sherlock went on.
Sherlock turned to Greg and rolled his eyes, clearly bored, his hands in his Belstaff pockets and a wry expression in his face.
He looked up, encountering Jack’s gaze, and remained silent, not knowing how to respond.
Sherlock remained silent, observing the man in front of him who once again, just under his gaze, had turned into something completely different, totally alien to the John he had known and loved for years.
"I'd love to, but I still have to go over some files and make a couple of phone calls before I come to bed" Mycroft said serious.
The woman shook her head, minimizing the incident as usual.
-But if I keep going like this, I'm never going to be able to build a relationship with him, so tomorrow I want to spend a whole day with you and Hamish.
-While your colleague, he says that sometimes you are "incredibly ignorant" when it comes to some topics...-added John with a wry smile.
Studied at Cambridge and graduated in Economics before being dragged into the dirty work that has always been Politics.
-Will you pay? -
He needed to know, but at the same time he was disgusted by what he might find out... What could he deduce from that brief analysis?
John went back to look at him, an amused smile on his lips.
Then she showed him how to dry and hydrate Hamish’s skin with the Vaseline cream and above all, she showed him how to put a diaper on, but without closing it completely, letting him have a try.
It was then that Sherlock remembered one of the many reasons he fell in love so deeply with John all these years ago.
John cleared his throat, trying not to be overwhelmed by embarrassment.
-I had a cup of tea with John this afternoon...-
-Why shouldn't we? - John asked him about it.
There was something different about his voice, something that led Greg to tilt his head to intercept his friend's gaze to try to figure out what was going through his head at the time, what memories Sherlock’s words had brought back.
Fighting the need to lay his gaze on the door, Sherlock turned another smile to the little girl.
The movement of his pelvis against his hips had made his legs shake like jelly a couple of times...
-To grow a pair! -
"I apologize for the hour boys...-began Mrs. Hudson- Sherlock darling, is not appropriate looking out the window in your dressing gown" she said an instant later, fondly scolding the detective.
It's true, there's been something that has bothered me in the last few days.
Sherlock had told John that sex with Irene had no meaning to him, what else did he want to hear?
Greg arched a curious eyebrow.
-Okay, let me see what happened. I’ll try to be quick; I promise!- John said to him, standing up and walking fast to the kitchen table where he had left his cell phone.
His surprise was therefore enormous when he was confronted by a man in a three-piece suit accompanied by his customary umbrella.
Mycroft answered him with a little ironic smile.
-That you and John were roommates and co-workers and that you had become friends from day one.
-It was just a kiss. And we were kissing in front of you because when he wants, Sherlock can be more stubborn than usual- he retorted.
Sherlock pulled back and met John’s ocean-blue eyes, clearly reading in his gaze the thoughts that plagued the doctor, his forehead against John’s.
John had convinced himself that he had a few more days before the man told him that he had made a misjudgment, that their situation was irreparable, and that John would be better off looking for another flat.
Besides, she knew I was alive-ended Sherlock in a pragmatic tone.
Who has the chance to have a Holmes all to himself does not let it get away...-he commented, arching an eyebrow in an ironic way.
"Remember the rest of the way?" she asked, looking up from her cell phone screen for a moment.
________________________________
What would be left of you if you didn't take this chance?" he asked, trying to make John think.
Sherlock shook his head.
He wasn't ready yet, he didn't have time to come to terms with what had   happened... He needed to be alone!
- Jack, Emma this is Lady Violet Holmes, Sherlock's mom.
"So, you healed him?" she asked him, leaning slightly towards him.
She's been talking about this musical since she saw the movie, so I thought I'd take her to see it.
All your questions have been answered, unless you also want the details, so what else prevents you from returning to your man and live happily with him? -asked Irene in a rational tone.
"I'm going to be completely honest" the detective promised him.
-Don't forget to tell Sally-John added.
-If you think about it, it's not.
A smile appeared on Jack's face.
John approached the tomb until he could place his left hand over the tombstone, a sudden sadness closing his throat.
"I don't know" he said, sincere.  "I don't know."
"He was also his partner; he was cooperating with you in the investigation" said another.
Sherlock returned to look at Hamish, slightly tilting the bottle to make things easier for him.
-That we were going to fight and you'd leave slamming the door... Oh! -Sherlock recalled, leaving the sentence in half when he understood what John wanted to make him understand.
-THIS IS YOUR HOME! -exploded Sherlock, arms wide open to indicate the living room and all the objects in it- Your things are still here, your clothes, your precious RAMC mug, you just have to look around to notice your presence in every room of this apartment.
Trying to fight against the effect that the low voice and the warm breath against his ear united with Sherlock's long-limbed body against him, had on his body and mind, John swallowed and moved the tip of his tongue over his inexplicably dry lips.
The woman nodded and pressed a button, causing the elevator doors to close between them.
I've always stood by your side, even though the situation became more and more dangerous.
-What happened instead? -
The next moment his eyes met those of the detective and the two men stared in silence, while John eagerly looked at the other's face, as if he wanted to imprint him in the memory: his eyes quickly caressed the cheekbones pronounced that had always fascinated him, his nose as straight as a sword and that mouth so perfect that it seemed drawn.
-It's different! We couldn’t talk about it, it was all wrapped in silence, but now I can make fun of it as much as I want.
"Come on Lestrade, you know you need me" said Sherlock, hearing his voice ring out in the room completely silent, even though it was full of people sitting at the desks.
His interactions with children of that age had not been the happiest, more than reasonable reason to delete them from his mental palace, and the last time he had come face to face with a child, the kid had started screaming with all the breath he had in body.
-What do I... Oh, a lot of things: football, Doc... -started Greg.
-Uncle John! -exclaimed the little girl, moving swiftly towards the drawing-room.
-I don't need it. I have everything you've been looking for-
The other nodded slowly, meeting his partner’s gaze.
- If I was lucky enough to meet you when we were younger, even before your tour in Ireland, I wouldn't have allowed anything and no one to take you away from me.
Always a fan of the show, John had recorded the last episodes aired to see them at every opportunity and that night the choice fell on the episode "
"Ask away darling," Jack encouraged her.
-If not with me, with whom?
If that's really what you want...- added Sherlock staring at John's face.
-Miss Hopper... or sorry, Mrs. Dimmock was crucial for the success of the operation-answered Sherlock for her.
There were also two armchairs and a sofa, but while those in his living room told a story, with various acid burns or tea stains, these seemed to have just come out of the furniture store.
"John..."said Sherlock in a low voice, finding himself speechless, unable to give voice to the turmoil that was stirring within himself.
"That explains why you're a genius and we're just mere mortals" Greg said.
The road was still fenced off, prompting the attention of passers-by, and Greg noticed some daredevils approaching the black and yellow stripes, stretching out their neck to look for some more information than those that immediately caught the eye, but as soon as they saw him enter the fenced area they hurried away like frightened mice.
Molly turned to look at him for a few moments then smiled.
"It was time for someone to really tell her how things were" said the man deliberately cryptic.
"Did he tell you that after the first time it was him that kept coming back to me?" Irene asked.
-John Watson what happened to your romantic heart? To your adventurous spirit? -asked Jack.
"You wanted to talk" John said without looking at Sherlock.
John remained silent for a few moments, thinking back to the memories of those years he usually kept hidden in a dark ravine of his mind, rethinking the negative and positive things of his years in the Army.
A battle was about to begin and Mycroft Holmes needed all the information he could get about his rival.
-Yes, Emma? -
So they didn't see each other for a couple of weeks, until Mrs. Hudson contacted Greg worried about John: it was a couple of days that she heard no noise coming from the apartment-continued Molly.
John took a deep breath, once again wondering how his perfect evening with Sherlock had turn into that uncontrolled chaos, only to bring his eyes back on Daniel and smile reassuringly at him.
But the doctor felt he had to be at least as sincere as Sherlock had been with him: he had told him a part of himself that he kept hidden and which he clearly was ashamed of, and now it was time to show him that, despite everything, John trusted him completely.
The living room floor and coffee table not far from the sofa, usually hidden by newspapers and piles of Scotland Yard  files, had become Hamish's playing territory, with much of the walking ground covered with soft and noisy toys that amused the child whenever his attention was focused on them.
"So it's over?" Mycroft found himself asking unable to hide the tremor that shook his voice.
"I don't want to talk about it" he said.
"I was sure you'd be able to keep up with the program" he said in return.
Okay, tell me about this date-said Jack settling more comfortable in the chair and taking his own cup in his hands.
The detective had left the choice to him, it was clear from his words that he would wait years if John would ask him.
He had then taken off his jacket and entered the kitchen putting the kettle on.
Sherlock looked at John and noticed that the man's face had returned serene, followed by a slight nod.
Did you forget what you were like when you were six years old Sherlock? -asked Mycroft, clearly determined not to lose that battle.
- That's why I'm worried: ever since Boss contacted me to take care of her, I've never been able to convince them to come to the clinic for a more thorough examination, for her fear of being seen by someone she knew before , or the possibility of Social Services locking her up in some care centre and then taking away her baby immediately after birth.
When the two women had separated, contrary to the common convention, John sided with Clara, using his intercontinental phone call a week during the first few months to prove to her that despite being in the middle of the desert he was on her side during the messy divorce and  that he still loved her.
"I wouldn't be able to recognize the difference, you know that" John said, with an amused smile that soon covered the other man lips’ too.
For the first time in many years, John felt lighter, finally free of a burden that had accompanied him since his return to Afghanistan.
He thought back several times to the unpleasant conversation he had had with Gregory, trying to take a detached view of the matter, as if he were a stranger who had found himself witnessing the bickering between two lovers.
"Don’t worry, I'll take care of it" Greg reassured him.
He stood up and looked up at the woman one last time.
Emma sighed, slightly frustrated.
-It’s my mother's house, not mine-
-Yes, of course. You must have felt very lonely in this big empty house- Mycroft commented.
-You e Mr. Watson…-
The expression of a man who lost everything.
Finally, what he had hoped for, desired, even banished from his own mind, was within reach and John would do anything to avoid missing that opportunity.
How could he have done such a thing?
He turned away from those thoughts and dropped the bag next to the couch, meeting his father's gaze again.
Sherlock looked at the detective with a confused expression and frown.
Call me if you need anything or if there are any changes, okay? -  Greg said meeting Daniel’s uncertain gaze.
The detective merely nodded, still clearly surprised, but his tapered fingers relaxed around John's small ones without making any mention of breaking that brief connecting point.
John focused on that kiss, his eyes fixed momentarily in the icy-blue ones,  stroking Sherlock’s upper lip with the tip of his tongue, biting the bottom one gently, until his tongue got involved in a dance with his twin and, again overwhelmed with passion, John closed his eyes,  his arms clasped around the detective's hips, his skinny chest pressed against his own still covered by the sweater.
When did that transformation happen?
John smiled back, before bringing the cup closer to his mouth.
"They met in a gay bar" he said.
John would have had all the time in the world... He had stolen three years of his life, the only thing he could offer him was time.
"Besides, I think I owe you an apology" Greg began.
Looking for the perfect family, which would look after him with love and he would not miss anything, making sure he will grow up like a normal child.
Sherlock smiled and his lips teased more of John’s neck till the doctor turned his head and pulled Sherlock face closer as their lips met.
-That's right-
-Why will she do that? Aldershot is an hour and a half from London-
During the train journey that would take him to London, John reflected lengthy on the conversation he had with his father, bringing back to the surface a memory he had tried to bury in the meanderings of his mind, bound to a dark period of his existence, when nothing made sense anymore and everything around him reminded him of the one person he needed, but who at the same time he had lost forever.
"Ah, really?" John asked, charging his voice with disbelief, hoping with all of himself that he had managed to hide the turmoil of emotions that was stirring within himself.
Dropping back into the chair, he wondered again what made John Watson special.
Sherlock merely nodded, even though he had not come any closer to solving the puzzle.
It was easier said than done...
-Drunk in Love- Beyonce & Jay-Z
Don't look at me like that! I can be romantic I want to, it's not my fault that you weren't impressed with it" he exclaimed as an answer to John's incredulous gaze.
Emma's gaze was still fixed on his face when, clutching her fingers around his right sleeve, she pulled him down towards her to place a kiss on his right cheek, leaving Sherlock in disbelief.
It was the same John had no doubts.
- It is a pleasure to know you-added in a courteous tone.
-If I remember correctly, you've already done it... With all your ex-girlfriends- he pointed out by raising an eyebrow in a cheeky manner.
-I do! Stop! Stop it now! -John intruded, conveying all his anger in the low tone of his voice.
-Okay, are we ready for the museum? The last thing I want is to spend all morning in a queue- he told her.
-And you have become friends-concluded Emma with an air of purpose.
-You can't talk about this in front of Misha! It's not an appropriate conversation - the blond scolded him.
How many mornings, especially during the first few weeks, had his mind offered him that long muscled body there on the couch?
-Would you rather wheeze on the side of the road because of a punctured lung?- John asked him in his firm voice that he used whenever Sherlock behaved in a childish manner.
For a moment in his mind returned the image of a tormented John struggling with his ghosts, unable to let go despite wanting Sherlock with everything in himself... He would give and do anything to never see such an anguished John again.
Even now Greg couldn't decide what bothered him the most.
Don't you want him to come back too? - he asked, lowering his gaze to intercept Hamish’s eyes again, but the boy’s attention was totally focused on his blue robe.
He gave a quick glance at the screen and made his way into the kitchen looking for some privacy.
I can only assume what Mycroft told you about me but knowing him I am sure he will have been extremely thorough" he said sincere.
-Oh come on John, don’t make fun of both of us!
What human being willingly inflicted the suffering John had to endure only to protect himself, to carry out his mission?
"I mean, if you had any peculiar interest, then Harry was the person you had to turn to" Daniel simply replied.
"Isn't that what's happening to you and John?" asked the inspector, turning back to the other man.
Sitting on the couch watching the morning talk shows and basking in your problems? - asked the old man with a wry smile.
Ever since they had begun to contemplate the idea of a possible relationship between them, the detective had never hidden his feelings, surprising him every time and leaving him speechless, leading him to wonder how it was possible that such a rude and verbally crude man with the rest of the population could be so sweet and sensitive with him.
"Ah, one last thing" Sherlock said, drawing John's attention back to himself.
-I've never seen her and yet she's the best thing that's ever happened to me, despite all the problems I've overcome in my pregnancy.
Mycroft allowed himself to be guided to the living room trying not to give much importance to the detective's words and to see them for what they really were: the attempts of a cheater to distract the partner's attention from their betrayals.
I also want to give you and heads up: the story is almost over, but I still need to translate the last 3 chapters, and I'm not sure when I'll be able  to do it with the holidays and the exams in January...
-She was... beautiful.
In the space of an instant, John was standing still by the fireplace, again far from the detective, struggling with all his might not to let go of his anger.
Sherlock remained silent for a few moments, pushing almost unconsciously against John's hand still placed in his hair, for it to resume the caresses.
Unable to breathe normally for a couple of minutes, Sherlock had been lulled by John's caresses and the small kisses that the man had placed on his jaw.
Is it possible that it wasn't just a dream?
I was a horrible person back then and she had the worst of me-answered Harry earnest.
"Where is he?" John asked.
I don't know if this time I'll be able to go back-
In the end, the film fully confirmed their expectations: John was fascinated by the wonderful landscapes and slightly confused by the twisted plot and without a true logical thread almost as much as a novel by Joyce or Virginia Woolf and strengthened in the doctor the belief that Sherlock would have hated every moment of that film, ruining the show to the many spectators.
"When are you going to tell him that you're aware of their relationship?" he asked.
-Mycroft could help us- mumbled Sherlock, making his friend smile again.
Sometimes men of a certain status have these kinds of impulses, if we want to call them that...
"What's a Wonderwall?
Baby Girl looked away from the screen and stared at the man in disbelief.
Emma let her mother hug her and put a kiss on both her cheeks.
At those words John's heart inexplicably increased his beats, impressed by the simplicity of his reasoning and the total honesty in Sherlock's voice.
-I'm not the one who spends hours in front of the closet looking for the beigest sweater - Sherlock teased him.
"Once again because of Irene?" asked Mycroft, listening carelessly.
The British official was clearly uncomfortable, not because of yet another intemperance of Sherlock, but because of what had happened in front of him a few seconds earlier.
But Gregory was different: he was at the same time his strength and his weakness, and although in those days Mycroft had tried to imagine a possible life without the detective, he had noticed that at the mere thought he felt breathless.
But that belief had faltered when he heard John speak on the phone with Greg.
"My price?" he asked.
"John what's going on?" asked Jack, clearly worried.
What if it wasn’t Dr. Sawyer?
Sherlock found himself alone once again, shrouded in silence as his mind quickly reflected on the long conversation he had with Molly.
-Daniel- finally answered the boy.
His father had been by his side during the days spent staring at the wallpaper as if it was hiding a coded message between the brown shades and during the nights were nightmares will wake him up in the middle of the night.
That night, a text arrived on John's cell phone.
-They've become lovers- concluded Sherlock.
John shrugged.
"It's really a shame that that knucklehead decided not to come" Greg said when a couple of hours later they stopped by a bench to allow the kids to have a snack.
Mycroft rose with grace and speed and made his way to the living room but did not let his anxiety and relief shine through when the inspector returned home.
- What's your limit tonight? -
"I don't understand why you're taking it so hard" Sherlock said.
He had found someone with whom he had more in common and had shifted his loyalty to someone more deserving.
But this time the challenge was shaping up to be rather difficult considering that the fantastic genius was in that state because of John.
Sherlock was back.
His mother left him in my apartment and disappeared-
It would have made your coverage even more real" he muttered, thinking back how many times he had come close to that goal.
I know you're not really a couple: there's nothing in your attitude, your movements or your mood that confirms a physical relationship between you two.
A subdued groan escaped from Sherlock's lips, taking him by surprise when, as if they had their own life, his arms clung more against John's waist, luring him against his body, making their bodies connect from chest to hips.
"I guess you've illustrated the beauties of our city in great detail" said John, a wry smile printed on his face.
I wanted him so bad, but I kept thinking about him and that woman... – John confessed.
Irene had acted behind his back, had turned his life upside down once again, just now that everything seemed to be going well, but Sherlock could clearly see the pattern behind that choice: the desire  to give Hamish the best tools to become a great man, as any mother would have done.
A slight hope made room in Sherlock to those words: despite the qualms and limitations, John was willing to stay, he would abandon the absurd idea of looking for another apartment.
-No, not really.
Every tiny cell of Moriarty’s web had fallen: deceased or in a high-security cell in some remote prison.
You can't really get over the fact that we slept together- she added, slightly amused.
She was a kind and petite woman, more or less my height, but when it was necessary she was able to show a fistful of iron and a strong temper- John added, raising his face to meet Baby Girl's attentive gaze and give her a sweet smile.
I'll be back next week, and I'll see right away if you've broken your promise-
He was mathematically certain that Sherlock had already captured much of the information he needed to understand the nature of their conversation, but John could still do his best to maintain a semblance of privacy.
-It's the best place in England to look after bees and grow honey.
I think his name is also on some marble slab somewhere with some other pompous donors as he-commented the detective, causing a slight smile in the other.
-What are you talking about?- Sherlock asked getting frustrated.
Sherlock in turn gave her a small smile and then remained silent for a few moments.
Throughout their friendship, John had never mentioned a possible homosexual or bisexual attraction, given the constant turnover of women with whom he accompanied.
In response Sherlock increased the squeeze.
-Sherlock William Holmes! Open this door this instant! - ordered a female voice.
As long as you...-added Greg caught by a sudden thought that Mycroft hastened to disprove.
John swallowed visibly, impressed by those words, finding himself the next moment fighting the desire to annul the distance between them, to make that small gesture that would take them into Sherlock’s personal space, to turn those fantasies that from days crowded his mind real.
-Don't forget about Mummy, Sherlock... I think she waited long enough- Mycroft reminded him without turning around.
Take my number and promise me that if you need anything, you'll call me- repeated Greg more firmly.
Unfortunately, he had not yet come to any solution when, still in his studio, the noise of the front door opening came to his ears.
-He and Lestrade were the maid of honor at Miss Hopper and Detective Dimmock wedding - continued Mycroft unperturbed, as if he had not heard the question from his brother. -Also reconnected with Sarah Sawyer, his colleague at the clinic and ex-girlfriend - added.
The detective nodded.
After shaking it a couple of times, John moved the bottle close to Hamish’s face who, hungry, quickly brought it to his mouth, starting to suck with voracity.
- Have fun and be good! -said Jack to Emma before heading to the door.
Moments or minutes later, the tip of Sherlock's tongue touched John’s upper lip, asking for more, and John did not hesitate to open his mouth and meet the detective's tongue, inviting him into a rhythmic dance that left both breathless in a short time.
Nothing else.
And I'm going to go back to fucking the half of London's gay population that I haven’t slept with yet" John said with a shrug.
Despite Anthea's differences and obvious distrust of mankind, apart from Mycroft, Greg and Anthea had managed to create a convivial relationship; they would never become friends, they would almost certainly never spend an evening at the pub telling each other the most hidden secrets of their souls or funny stories about Mycroft, but at least it was nice to know that they were able to stay in the same room without slit their throats.
One has achieved the goal, the other has not. End of story-he said in a bored voice.
Tomorrow I will have a work commitment and showing up with a hangover is certainly unprofessional - Jack replied by hanging his jacket on the pegs next to the door.
-I can’t stop thinking about everything I want to do to you, John. Ever since you came back, I can't stop thinking about you... Every time I look at you, a new idea comes to my mind...-
"It's nice to meet you" said Sherlock with merely a nod.
-Ok, I'm sorry. So, you asked John out on a date.
-At least now you can admit your feelings... It’s a shame it took you three years- !
Upon entering the living room, Sherlock was confronted by Jack, who returned Robert's gaze with a particularly concerned one, until he noticed Sherlock's presence.
A full and sincere laugh rumbled through the empty rooms, leading John to lower his head, as if he were ashamed of his own laughter.
I have carefully analyzed every moment spent together in the last few days, but I cannot understand what went wrong- Mycroft said in an honest tone.
The two men remained silent for a few moments, both with an important question to ask the other.
-Good morning.
He distractedly wiped himself with one of the various white towels available and looked into the small mirror above the sink, recognising himself for the first time in months; he performed  the morning ablutions, brushing his teeth and carefully shaving and come out of the bathroom, pausing a few moments in front of the two-door closet that occupied part of the bedroom.
When he was ready, John sat in his armchair and, with his cup of tea not far away, lost himself in his paperback.
That simple word brought him back to reality, ripping him away from his Mind Palace and his theories.
Around him the forensics team was finishing collecting the last evidences, while Sally and Greg were on the right side of the bed, the left side empty, giving Sherlock and John space to analyze the body.
-Can I have a pound? -asked the little girl turning to John, who patiently handed her the coin.
Moments later, ready to go to work after their meeting, Jack sat in front of him.
-Tea? -
Once he would not have had the slightest doubt, but now seeing how their complicated relationship was he no longer had that security.
"Are you sorry?" she asked curious.
In the seven years of their friendship, Sherlock Holmes had repeatedly accused him of being an idiot, yet it took him a moment to put the pieces together.
A light came from a shed not far away, and in the distance, Sherlock heard voices.
Boss nodded.
Unable to stand idle and in need of information, he had called Jack Micheals and asked if he could go to John's office and make sure that the man was okay.
The man shook his head slowly.
-Did you tell me everything? He asked.
-Do you want to come with us? -asked the little girl without taking her eyes off Sherlock.
Baby Girl made to speak, a distressed expression on her face, but John shook her head gently, giving her a reassuring smile.
John shook his head trying to dispel the fog that seemed to have taken hold of his brain and strangely, that simple gesture seemed to work, because one thing immediately became clear to him.
"I haven't trained for three years" said Sherlock, while placing the instrument against my shoulder.
Later, John would blame the closeness, the unexpected statement, the voluntary separation to which he had subjected both of them in the last week, but at that moment the only thought that crossed his mind was: why not?
With that new consideration in mind, John reached out on the table and clasped his fingers around Sherlock’s pale and elongated fingers, seizing the brief tension that crossed Sherlock's muscles at that unexpected gesture.
-What? I didn't do anything wrong! -retorted the boy, preparing to escape.
Why had this "sex beast" been content with mutual masturbation and hadn't slammed him on the bed so that they could fully and mutually enjoy their bodies?
John, quietly continuing to eat, met his gaze and gave him at a little smile.
John chuckled.
Daniel shook his head.
"Absolutely not!"retorted Mycroft vehemently, personally insulted by the idea.
More than once, Sherlock was on the verge of interrupting her and asking her to keep quiet, or at least talking about less boring topics, but he managed each time to stop himself knowing that John would not appreciate it and that, surprisingly, the doctor seemed to appreciate the nonsense tales of the little girl.
He was going home.
There had been occasions in the past, before The Fall, when he and Sherlock had shared the bed, but it was always emergency situations or booking mistakes.
Before he could continue, the bathroom door opened and Jack entered the kitchen again, sitting on one of the stools without giving the couple more than one look.
Thank you for helping me keep a roof over my head and forcing me to eat-said addressing the group of people in the second row, leading Mrs. Hudson and Sarah to wipe their eyes with a handkerchief- Without you I wouldn't be here- added John.
Sitting at the kitchen table, a half-empty cup of tea in front of himself, John stared at his phone for a few minutes, looking for the right words to start the conversation; their relationship, thanks to Sherlock's songs was not as cold as at first, but they had not yet returned to being "John & Sherlock", so how would he deal with the issue?
Sherlock merely groaned.
Sherlock hinted a smile, lacing an arm around the man's waist, pulling John more against himself: he needed to feel John as close to him as possible, and John seemed to feel the same as he tied his arms around Sherlock’s neck, his chest against that of the black-haired man.
Why had John's face lit up when he heard her name?
-Typical of Irene... She may have interpreted it as a joke because of the animosity that has always accompanied Moriarty's relationship with John- Mycroft said.
If I were to rate his performance I'd say he deserves a 6, and I'm been generous- Irene said before a mischievous smile was painted on her painted lips- But I'm sure he'd give his best with you-
When the front door of the Marylebone’s house opened again it was now evening.
-Victor found me interesting and was not bothered by my deductions, he actually found them brilliant.
Sherlock slightly moved away from the doctor, as much as he needed to meet his gaze again, sinking into John’s blue ocean eyes.
Sherlock giggled.
He sighed, shrugging off those negative thoughts, and walked to the secondary entrance to the morgue, where three years earlier he had been led in a stretcher by a group of fake nurses.
"She seems to appreciate the company of your brother, who would have thought of that…" said Greg, looking at the little girl.
Or would he go up to the apartment to take the rest of his clothes and then go back to Harry?
After all, it wasn't the first time in their relationship: Mycroft made a mistake, Gregory was angry, he held a grudge for a few hours (or for a few days), but then they always fixed it all.
On a day considered moderately stressful for the average English man, Mycroft Holmes' cellphone receives a minimum of seventy texts and fifty phone calls, wherever in the world he is.
With his hands planted on both sides of Sherlock's shoulders, John moved his hips, rubbing his body against Sherlock’s mighty and muscular one; the friction of his bare skin against Sherlock's was perfect, but never as the man below him: his black hair were unruly on the white pillow, his perfect lips were swollen for their kisses, and his face was flushed with desire; finally Sherlock’s long and naked body, in spite of their differences, seemed to fit perfectly to John’s.
"Sometimes they act like children" he said.
He took off his raincoat and left his shoes at the entrance, next to another pair of painted shoes, considerably more expensive and in perfect condition.
Sherlock looked down; a little bit annoyed.
"I don't need your gratitude" John said, before turning his back on her and heading for the restaurant door.
That's when he noticed the white envelope on the coffee table.
Sherlock remained silent, clearly awaiting further information.
-Thank you... For keeping quiet and for everything you've done-
-You were right.
-Here you are... Our mysterious guest-Mycroft said to him with a smile of circumstance.
John stared for a few moments at his boyfriend before breathing deeply.
"I'd remember it otherwise" the woman retorted.
- And when we’ll be too old, we'll retire in  our cottage in Surrey where we can continue to be two grumpy old men that people will look at suspiciously for our past and my ugly character.
The only other member admitted will obviously be Hamish-said Sherlock serious.
In those days, the detective had tormented Mycroft with phone calls, clamoring to know what had been hidden from him until now, but Mycroft had made himself unreachable.
-Gregory- called Mycroft's voice.
He had been pulled away by the man in the photographs and had only given him one last look before walking away with him.
thought John hinting at a smile and clutching the fingers of his left hand around the glass.
-What can I say? A lady never leaves a party without first making sure she has spoken to the most important people" she replied.
Traffic, a busy road, a female voice recorded.
Hamish shook his head.
Was he able to contact Irene and returned Hamish to her, like a postal parcel?
-It was pointed out to me that since I invited you, I could not use my acquaintances to get a free dinner, because on a date, the one who made the proposal, in this case me, must pay the bill.
Gregory appeared in the living room and, for the second time that day, was surprised to find Mycroft there; but if that morning an affectionate smile had stretched out on the man's lips, now the weary face of the detective remained tense and closed.
-How about Angelo’s? - Sherlock proposed John.
John's smile in that picture was beautiful... Just as he remembered it.
ever after ", but John was certain that a bit of "boring normality" would be good for them too.
Sherlock's back stiffened further at those words, while his mind was furiously searching for a sarcastic and stinging response that would silence the boy and reduce him to a cluster of nerves, but Tommy had already brought his attention back to John.
He had done his part several times, he had tried to put the pieces back together so many times that at the end of that fantastic relationship that had brought him back to life after his return from Afghanistan there were only crumbs left.
Because of your parents of course: you were the eldest son ergo all the expectations fell on you.
An evolved version, complicated and incomprehensible to the poor mere mortals, which perfectly suited our needs.
-You've decided it... – Sherlock mumbled.
-I have other plans. That include neither visiting Mummy nor reviewing the last three years of my life with your MI6 lackeys- he said making his priorities clear.
He was certain that Mommy would find nothing wrong with John, that she would understand immediately that the man was his perfect match and would give them her blessing.
-Me and the rest of the world.
-You know I'm a gentleman, and I'm definitely going to be hungry after the movie.
Otherwise, Sherlock would still continue to live his life with John by his side, but this would lead to a drastic change in his relationship with his family.
"What are you doing here Sherlock?" asked John, in a patient voice, but from whom he could see the vein of rage that flowed underneath.
"But it's all so boring" repeated Sherlock for the umpteenth time.
-Yeah-
-She had a little surgery. A clogged artery almost caused her a stroke.
The one in your blog or what we see in your colleague's posts? -asked John sincerely curious.
Sherlock reflected a few minutes on his words before sighing and nodding; meeting his gaze Greg nodded as well, glad that his advice had not been labeled as trivial or useless.
-Why would I? Because we have this wonderful relationship without secrets? Or because you become an expert on the joys of fatherhood thanks to Hamish? -John asked him biting.
In the meantime, he had thrown himself into work, especially working to recover an ultrasound machine for the visit he had promised Baby Girl and making the usual medical examination on the homeless people, finding that peace that in other aspects of his life were completely lacking.
No other marks were evident around the neck and there were no obvious bruises on the man’s face.
-Emma will spend the day with us.
-Baby Girl, I know you're doing everything you can to make sure the baby has the best once he’s born.
He was just making two cups of tea and at the same time checking the food content of their refrigerator, when two arms wrapped around his waist causing him to jolt.
His father merely shrugged his shoulders, holding John’s stare.
-You do know “Doctor Who”, right? -Emma asked him clearly surprised.
Sherlock turned to the woman and, after raising his eyes again to the sky, dedicated his attention to her.
John nodded slowly.
"Did you have any doubts?" heasked her to tease her.
Two minutes earlier he had to remind himself that his relationship with Sherlock was over, that this meeting was futile, and now there he was planning for the future to prevent "Maleficent" from interfering again, ruining their lives for the umpteenth time.
Sherlock shrugged.
"It's a feeling I can understand" he said.
Not to mention what the clothes covered from sight: various scars marked his body, relics of the private war that he had fought to take his life back.
Without all those problems their newborn relationship would have been idyllic: at the beginning of a relationship two people can’t seem to take their hands off each other longer than the time it takes to eat or take a shower (when it is not done together) or sleep.
Jack smiled and shook his head.
And just as the detective had predicted a few moments earlier, those few words took on new meaning and completely changed the lives of the three men in the apartment.
-Sergeant Donovan just called.
Typical. Trivial. Another proof that feelings were a waste of time and a hassle.
He needed to know before he could focus on the rest...
It was after that experience, after the drugs and during the rehabilitation that he built that armor of indifference that he wears every day and that keeps everyone away.
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
Sherlock's attention focused on the phone call as soon as he heard that name, leading him to stare intently at the inspector's back.
My house is Baker Street- answered Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded again.
_______________________________
-You should have talked to me! As I did when I had my doubts about our story... But no, you decided to step over me and make the decision by yourself for both of us.
"Really?" asked Jack, surprised.
An ironic grin curved Sherlock’s plump lip.
More distant than ever.
The black-haired man held his gaze for a few seconds before letting go of a frustrated sigh, moving his eyes now on Boss now on Baby Girl, who followed the conversation carefully.
-When did you realize... - Sherlock started.
He wasn't ready for that fight yet. He had sought-after that moment for the last three years, yet now after all the information he received he had concluded that he had to collect all the possible data about the man before meeting him.
At those words Sherlock opened his eyes wide, his breath stuck in his lungs.
I couldn't stop those images in my mind and for a while I seriously thought I'd go crazy- Sherlock recounted.
She kept telling me that she was the oldest, that she didn't need my macho attitude, that she was capable to defend herself... But it was my sister and I would have done anything to protect her from those idiots-
"Tomorrow I’ll have a guest overnight" he said.
-Maybe next time-
John was ninety percent sure that the second person was Irene, especially after Hamish's arrive at Baker Street, but what the detective had said about the woman during their dinner was anything but a declaration of love...
"I'd better go too" said Mrs. Holmes, standing up and stopping in front of the doctor- I'd be a terrible hostess if my guests arrive before me- she added with a smile that John had seen several times on Sherlock's face.
John, standing on the threshold, shook his head, his gaze fixed on the living room to catch every slight change that occurred during his absence,  noticing  the obvious action that took place in a few days: what was initially called the  "den" of two bachelor men, which then turned  into Sherlock Holmes' In Memoriam Museum, had undergone a further transformation, becoming a baby-proof apartment.
"That's not what I remember” said John, a voice high enough to hear over the sound of music.
-What can I say... I live a dangerous life.
What were they hoping to achieve? A passionate love confession?
-Isn't that obvious? Even Mycroft has to explain to you every little thing? -he asked, the first hints of impatience in the voice.
We were in Berlin when it first happened... It was Irene who came on to me" the detective replied.
After all, he didn't need an anniversary to miss Sherlock... Not when everything in his apartment reminded him of his former roommate.
John chuckled, and even Sherlock let himself go to an amused sneer.
"Obviously Sherlock’s good manners are already rubbing off on you…" said Jack, an amused smile on his lips.
-Lestrade.
Now I'm numb, I've become unreal
I've just been caught off guard, it's the first time I go on a date with a single father -John said.
Sherlock stared at her for a few more moments before deciding to answer.
John laughed and shook his head before returning to settle down against the Sherlock’s side.
-I didn't say anything, mostly not to scare the baby.
He then walked to Greek Street, his hands in his pockets, trying not to draw attention to himself, despite the nagging feeling that it was obvious where he was headed and what his intentions were.
He avoided asking her what her plans were for that day and promised her that he would do everything he could to stop by to Baker Street even just for a greeting or a cup of tea.
"You and Mycroft don't look alike at all" she said.
-Yes, it's true.
-Does she know who I am? - the detective asked him.
-There was a murder. Vauxhall Bridge...-she informed Greg, stealing a quick glance at Sherlock.
It's just that life gets complicated with Sherlock, for him normality is boring...- John commented.
-No! Of course not... I can see that you care about that boy.
Especially if, as you said, it was a club specifically for wealthy members-
The doctor nodded.
"Does this mean that the problem was not important?" asked Mycroft, clearly trying to fully understand the situation.
-John- whispered Sherlock not knowing what to say next.
Two men with our responsibilities, with the risks that our work entails, can't really get carried off with this absurdity of having a family.
-I don't understand why you're so surprised, my dear.
-Fair point-
-John? Is it you? - Greg answered.
Suddenly John turned and looked at him, starting to walk backwards and hinting at a mischievous smile.
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
Jack smiled back and waved to him.
Baby Girl, I know it's not pleasant to hear it and even less to think about it, but you have to start considering your options, having in mind what is best for her and not what you would like.
-They say she's going to make it, even though she's still in critical condition for now.
) kept asking questions, spurring him to seize that moment, aware that such an opportunity would never come back.
Before long they had become roommates, inseparable friends, they had started sharing a bank account without either of them finding it strange and if they now took the final step, granting his intimacy to Sherlock (as he had been longing for years), he was certain that Sherlock would not have half measures, asking once again for his 100%.
