"Not at all, Detective Inspector. I have learned a great deal about the cross-pollination methods of Orchidaceae in quite a short time."
, Detective Inspector," he said wearily. "Please. Enjoy your day with your son. You played well and you won. You've no retribution to fear from me."
"Right," John said a little roughly. He cleared his throat, conscious of the warmth spreading through his chest. "Well. Good thing we're experimenting, then."
The staff treated him as they always did—like an oddity. An oddity who paid their generous salaries. An oddity whose abilities they respected, perhaps even admired, but an oddity nonetheless. It helped, actually. It reminded him of his place: Sherlock Holmes was
Sherlock flickered him a considering look. "I was in this particular instance referring to the ceremony."
"Then we'll keep working," Lyons said firmly, and pressed a kiss against Henry's bare shoulder. "We'll work it out. Okay? We'll work it out."
Sherlock frowned at him. Whether it was for speaking out of turn or for his admittedly feeble attempt at humor, John wasn't sure. "There is no volcano."
anything. But, bloody hell, he was an adult now and he knew perfectly well all dogs weren't terrifying, malevolent beasts.
a party planner. " John pursed his lips and eyed Laughing Boy's tipped champagne flute and tangled lei.
"Yeah," John grinned. "I know." He closed the door behind him and headed out. It was a beautiful day on the island.
John slid the arch of his foot over Sherlock's ankle. The sheet covering their entwined bodies rustled softly at the shift in position, and John echoed the sound with a contented sigh.
"See?" Archie crowed to Molly after one look at Mycroft's and Lestrade's faces when they arrived back at the dock. "I told you."
Sholto's arm tensed, but he didn't withdraw it. "And I've missed you, Watson." He looked down. The late afternoon sun caught his pale lashes. "John."
If the breeze wasn't playing with Sherlock's curls, John might have thought Sherlock had actually frozen in time, he had gone so still, with the same faraway look in his eyes he'd had when John had told him he loved him.
"Yes, of course," said Sherlock, bringing up an app with the local tram schedules. On the night route, if he'd timed it properly, Czerny could have slipped into either the church or—Sherlock rolled his eyes—of course there was a Starbucks.
John shifted his water glass to one side so he had a better view across the table of Sherlock's notebook. He raised his eyebrows. "Waterfall sex? Is that something I'm going to need to look up online?"
"Well. You know."  He shifted against the growing tightness of his trousers, eyes drifting helplessly toward the dais. "Sexual."
"But what if I can't?" Henry's palm played over the back of Lyons' neck. "Will, you…you work with dogs."
Sherlock, curls damp around his neck, was leaning casually against the door jamb, one leg crossed over the other at the ankle. Completely naked.
Sherlock's smile curled, slow and smug, as he turned and walked away, writing carefully in his notebook. "Interesting."

An art gallery owner comes to Sherlock with the dream of unveiling the lost work of a great master. John gets his first glimpse of how things on the island are run.
? Did being noble always make people feel like they wanted to throw everything they owned across the room just to see it
"I see." Mycroft did a quick mental sift through the Bruce-Partington case file. Lestrade. He knew the name, of course. The officer in charge of investigating West's murder for New Scotland Yard, insignificant. He'd never bothered to look at the face. An omission based on conceit and one he would clearly have to remedy in future. He narrowed his eyes. "I'm impressed."
"Smiles, everyone!" Sherlock barked at the staff assembling at the lagoon. Several of them flashed nervous looks at him, as though he might be behaving strangely. More strangely than usual, that is. Sherlock glared back at them and they scurried, bright smiles plastered across their faces. If he was being especially demanding this particular morning, which he
Which is when he turned around to find Sherlock standing directly behind him, grave-faced and once again impeccably-groomed.
If Sherlock didn't understand that kind of pain, John was glad of it. The mockery underlying Sherlock's performance, even if John was the only one who heard it, he wasn't so glad of.
Henry looked down at the hand in his and huffed a breathless laugh. His throat felt hot. His jeans felt tight. He thought he could hear waves crashing on the nearby beach. "Will."
"For being unable to fulfill your fantasy. It is the first time I have failed a client. And although I cannot pretend to be…regretful…on this particular occasion for…personal reasons, I nevertheless believe I do owe you an apology as your host."
At Sherlock's request, John saw James Sholto to his villa, just across the courtyard from John's own bungalow.
. He wasn't so bad at observation and deduction himself, now was he? And he'd only needed to witness two fantasies to see it. First, Paul and Ravi's wedding and reception, and now Radka and Raz's new relationship.
Soo Lin looked at him solemnly for a long moment, then nodded. "That's absolutely right. So don't do it. Don't keep me behind glass."
"Oi! Down from there!" Holmes's Prussian-eyed assistant shouted, surging into motion as they rounded the corner into a little enclave of poorly maintained buildings made of concrete, brick, and steel instead of bamboo and palm leaves. He took the cross-bar of the scaffolding nestled against a white-painted wall in one quick, determined step up and caught the man clinging to one of the vertical bars by the back of his t-shirt collar. A can of spray paint rolled into the sandy soil at the base of the building, a former church from the look of it, pristine but for a slash of black paint beside one arched window.
Sherlock's gaze flicked down John's body, taking in his awkward, arousal-hiding stance. He lifted an eyebrow.
"Yeah, come on," Lyons nodded encouragement and sent Ushi into the other room with a quick hand signal. "I've been in the army. I'm used to a command voice," he grinned.
Molly gave her server Camilla's arm a friendly squeeze of thanks for the flower-free vodka tonic, delighted she'd remembered Molly's preference, and settled down onto one of the garden benches to watch the other guests. Aunt Sissy's extended family, both blood kin and found, was a large and eclectic group along with their assorted partners and the plus ones, twos, and threes they'd brought along to the island. Molly of course had cousins and friends among the party to catch up with as well, but there was no rush.
"Doctor Watson?" A young man in one of the island's trademark sarongs appeared at John's side. "Mr. Holmes requests a moment of your time, if you please, in his offices at the cottage."
He had admitted defeat, and that rankled. He knew Sherlock's hand was in this, but it was Lestrade who had outplayed him, Lestrade who had carried out the plan perfectly. Seduced him to gain access to his files, taken advantage of his tropical island lassitude. If there was one thing Mycroft Holmes knew, however, it was how to turn any situation—even a defeat—to his advantage.
," he pronounced the words distastefully, mockingly, "is lacking certain significant detail. For example, there is no mention of your alcoholic sister. Harriet, I believe she's called. Nor of the shoulder wound that ended your military career. Sniper."
"I have listened to your stories about Sherlock Holmes all day. Really listened. And I have spoken to him at length myself when we arranged this visit. How often, in our association, have I misjudged people?"
since the planning began, all snip and scowl, with none of his usual sly smiles. And John had only made the
Sherlock placed the tray carefully in front of the rumpled, brown-haired, brown-eyed mop of a young man sat next to John at the small, round table—the séance table, they were apparently calling it—in the center of the room. Andy Galbraith's face was soft but set in the flickering light.
"Well, hello there, Ushi," Mrs. Hudson beamed. She introduced herself to the white and black-spotted dog and then pointed up at John and Sherlock. "And this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Captain John Watson."
"Yeah?" John twisted a little, looking himself over. "Not too…I don't know…waiter? Cruise director?"
"Such defeatism. That's not very piratical of you. How do you expect to plunder the high seas with that sort of attitude?"
"Sherlock, do I have to hold you down for details?" John threatened, completely cheerfully, because Sherlock was smiling again and everyone had left
Radka looked up instead of down, looked at the paintings, the sculptures, the vases. Fruit and flowers, waterfalls and forests, dogs and dragons, silky falls of fabric and bared breasts. This was theirs. It was hers, all the wide world of freedom in this room, and the shouts of the protestors in the Square sounded much farther away. She touched the dirty sole of Mikolas' shoe with one fingertip. He was hers, too.
," Molly said. "Devil's foot, it's called. And then before that, there was a man who'd been stung by a jellyfish—"
The "cottage" turned out to be an enormous and ornate, white-painted, red-trimmed, rambling Queen Anne style villa with a tall bell tower jutting up near the center. Inside Sherlock's private offices, however, the island aesthetic fell away, replaced by an actually slightly shabby, completely disorganized, cluttered and curiously homey space. Sherlock was sat in a modern leather desk chair, which he turned to face John as John walked in. Sherlock's island aesthetic had fallen away, too. He was wearing a simple, fitted, plum-colored button-up, not a trace of white. He rested his elbows on his desk and tented his fingers in front of his chin.
Mycroft shoved file folders brimming with sensitive government information off the coffee table and then shoved the man with his big hands all over Mycroft's arse down onto the sofa and climbed on top of him.
"I see," he said. "Hey, Archie, see over there where they have those meat and fruit things on sticks? Why don't you run and fetch a couple for us whilst I say hello to your new friend?"
"Which you might bother yourself now and then to check in on, for Mrs. Hudson's sake," John frowned. What
"I'll…just get you a towel and some water," Mycroft said, turning towards the bathroom, "before you go."
Powder Blue slid to the ground with a sigh in front of Sherlock as though he'd simply decided to have a nice little sleep in the grass.
It was awkward in her slim skirt, but Radka knelt and then lay down on her back on the cool floor, stretching her legs out in front of her. She kicked off her shoes and sighed, transported.
"So, yes, I'm looking for love." Janine's eyes went distant, dreamy. "The kind that feels like it'll burn up all in one night, and also the kind that feels like it will look at thirty years like it was thirty seconds. I want the diamond nights out, dining and dancing, but I also want to snuggle up in a blanket under the stars. I want someone to laugh with so loud it wakes up the neighbors…and someone to do a few other things with so loud it wakes up the neighbors…but I also want someone who'll just hold me quietly. Someone strong. Someone soft. Someone fun. Someone sexy. Someone solid. I know what you're all thinking, right? I want it all!"
, had happened between them. He just seemed distracted. "So he was the client you mentioned yesterday?"
John pushed the heels of his hands into Sherlock's upper trapezius muscles, dragged his thumbs down both sides of Sherlock's spine. "It's all connected," he said.
," Sholto repeated gravely, "your Mr. Holmes and I. We simply wear our scars in different places. And I…if
There had been precious few island-related tasks requested of him, though, and in spite of Mrs. Hudson's bolstering company John was feeling lonely. How he wished he'd just kept his infatuated mouth shut. Because the thing was, even if Sherlock didn't "wade into the pit," John
"All right, Janine, love? I'm called Fletcher, and I run a sort of…tourism business in the beautiful, picturesque, you'd-love-it village of Grimpon. Devon, right? My own business, self-employed. I'm enterprising. I'm creative. I'm fit. I'm a good bet. And Janine?"
"Someone had best bloody well be dying here, Sherlock," John dropped his bag on the floor so he could start peeling his way out of the wet cling film his jacket had become, "or I swear to God I will—"
Sherlock's gaze wandered along the far side of the placid, palm-shaded lagoon before them, waiting. "Client arrives. Fantasy. I amaze everyone by demonstrating basic powers of observation and deduction."
"Sherlock," John gave Sherlock a searching look, "just…help a bloke out here. I can't read it the way you do. I don't actually know what you…like."
John flinched, thinking immediately of his every stray glance at Sherlock's mouth, his hands, his beautifully-fitted trousers. "But I didn't come here for a fantasy."
"That confirmation, incidentally, really wasn't necessary." Sherlock smirked. "I was actually already impressed by what you can do."
gently, and he was really doing his best to be abrasive, damn the woman. "Is it the same with John as it was with Molly, Sherlock? Do you want him to leave?"
"I don't know," John looked around the deck and tried not to sound doubtful. "We'll just need to use a little extra imagination."
you a relationship, you would never need to go looking for one. Do you see? You wouldn't need to go…anywhere else…for what you want."
"It's astonishingly simple to read what people want." Sherlock looked John up and down and smiled again, like he'd just learned everything about John he'd ever need to know. "You're all so transparent."
It was big Paul's voice that was soft and shaky, thick with emotion. Ravi had delivered his vows in a clear, unwavering tone, eyes shining with conviction. They made a handsome pair, Ravi in a classic black tuxedo and Paul in a blue and grey tartan kilt.
"That won't be necessary." Sherlock flicked a glance over the private first class compartment. Leather seat, wide table. Adequate. "I'll be working."
. He needed to get out of here right now. "No problem. It's all fine. But I do think I'll just…be going."
The plane rumbled up to the narrow, flower-festooned gangplank connecting the lagoon to the garden and cut its engines.
"It's 'John,' please." He liked Mrs. Hudson already. She reminded him a bit of Mrs. Turner. An alarming thought occurred as he pictured Mrs. Turner at Paul and Ravi's wedding reception. "Most of the arrangements? Including, the, erm…"
"That wasn't even on the list, was it?" John turned into Sherlock's arms, pressed up for a kiss. "Oversight."
The music, a sort of hip-hop/island fusion, heavy on the throbbing drums, was louder as John emerged from the tree-covered pathway to the reception area. Multi-colored lights were strung amongst the trees and torchlight flickered closer to the ground, but the grounds were almost empty of people, except for—John smirked—a fair number of athletic-looking men and women with two-way radios and staff shirts patrolling the perimeters.
A man stepped out onto the dock, standing tall and stern. The morning light brought out the gold in his hair, as well.
It was simpler, easier, once they switched to business mode. Mycroft's defenses were admittedly more difficult to summon outside his familiar environment and attire, his ready armor, but they were firmly back in place now. He had much to chastise himself for in allowing himself to get so sloppy. Literally as well as metaphorically. There would be time for self-recrimination, though. This was the time for mitigation.
He couldn't tell Lestrade everything, obviously, but Mycroft explained what he could about the Bruce-Partington case, given what Lestrade would know from having seen the file now as well as the information from his own investigation. Lestrade was thorough, listening intently to every detail and challenging Mycroft on point after point.
all in one horrible day. James Sholto had lost much more, including every eager new soldier under his command.
"You knew they'd…get together. Somehow. Change her plans for her gallery. And…and give Raz a place to show his art."
Sherlock was waiting on the lawn, slim and neat in his white suit, and he turned and smiled as John approached. John swallowed down the breath that caught in his throat. Really, those curls shouldn't be allowed exposure to golden morning sunlight or gentle breezes. It wasn't really fair.
John didn't bother reading the last cards. Amidst the din of applause, he made his way around the spontaneous group snog and off stage.
Sherlock scowled and shuffled some papers. Dramatically. People were often distracted random fluttering, he'd found. "I'm not
"To make me feel so very good, Janine need only tell me what she wants." Kate's voice went a little breathless. "Exactly how she wants it. Her pleasure is my pleasure.
"Will you just fucking give that to me?" John snatched the jacket away from Sherlock, who was curling his lip at it critically. "If a woman was murdered—"
It's not *really* a ghost story, but this felt like a special Halloween episode to me! Kin and Kind will pick up next week. Happy Halloween!
There was color everywhere, painted on the walls, the floor, the ceiling, the furniture, bright and bold, jagged lines and sensuous curves. There were landscapes and figures and clouds and eyes. It was Prague, all spires and spikes. It was London in the rain. It was a tropical island, flamboyant and lush. It was tanks and war and anger. It was peace in the parks and the sky. It was passion. It was life. Dogs and dragons.
caught in his throat so he could speak again. "Soo Lin?" It came out in a miserable sort of squeak. He wanted to be a lion for her, but he was just a mouse.
"Give me another half hour or so and, by God, you're going to feel it again. You can write that in your notes right now."
John turned his attention from the biplane bobbing in the lagoon. It was just Mrs. Hudson and himself there to farewell the guests. Sherlock had returned to his habit of leaving it to them, off doing whatever he did in his private office.
"Soo Lin Yao." Sherlock intoned, bowing his head. "We are here this night to bid you: speak! Speak to this man who crosses sea and storm to seek you out in the great beyond. To find the one who
"How could it not be obvious?" Sherlock tugged his jacket down crisply and jerked his chin up. "I've told you, John. Keep up."
"All right, Sebastian, it sounds like you're ready to speak up next," John said, and got a low snicker out of the audience.
"You see?" John nodded. "Brilliant. Well...that's said, so I'll just…let you get back to whatever you're doing, there."
"Have left the few you had in Afghanistan behind. Your injuries, both physical and psychosomatic, along with the tedious sympathetic expressions you are subjected to on a daily basis have eroded your confidence. Your army pension is inadequate to maintain a life in London without immediate supplement. In short, you are at a personal, functional, and financial loss with very little to return to in London." Sherlock paused for a breath and looked at John, waiting, perked up like he was expecting a pat on the head or a saucer of milk. "Am I right?"
John glanced at Sherlock's profile. He had turned his attention back to the still lagoon, but a smile played at the corners of his mouth. "Why?"
There was a haughty sniff that must be Sebastian. "Janine, you would have everything you could possibly need. A nurse to tend to your every discomfort. A masseur to ease your pains. Even a chef to prepare your soup. And, naturally, your doting Sebastian by your side."
"An absence of interruptions would be lovely." Sherlock scooped the fluffy white blanket and pillow off his chair and shoved them into her arms to take away.
"Ushi, bed!" ordered a man's voice, and the great, fanged muscled creature ambled amiably through the door into the other room.

"Yeah," John pointed at Sherlock's face. "Mostly it's been a lot of that. Not that, you know, I'm expecting some sort of declaration. Just because I said…what I said. I don't even know if you want—"
"Was it good?" Even though Andy couldn't hear them, John felt like he should whisper in the silence Sherlock was keeping. It made him a little angry with himself, but angry as Sherlock made him, John still wanted his approval.
"I'm glad you're here now," John said with all the warmth and acceptance he could put into the few words.
you? Fucking hell, you're the most incredible—" Henry blurted out before could think, and then his eyes widened in shock. "I mean…"
"Yeah, brothers." John shook his head, looking between the two woefully wilted men. "I'm seeing it now."
The back of Sherlock's knees hit his chair and he flopped down into the leather, a hot chill shivering down his belly, and
John sniffed and swiped at his nose with the back of one hand, waving at the prone revelers with the other. "Were they so transparent you didn't see them coming, then?"
Soo Lin laughed, the gauzy covering stretching over her face where a mouth would open. Another pulse of blood bloomed over her heart. "Why would
"Oh. Well, it's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Hudson." John glanced back and forth between them. "And…what do you do here?"
"Then…what?" John licked his lips. There had been staff moving through the gardens, birds singing, distant music, but now it felt like there was no one there but the two of them and all John could hear was the sound of the sea. "What do I want, Sherlock?"
"The living ones tend to move about a bit more," Molly murmured, grinning into her drink at the boy's macabre enthusiasm. And, frankly, it was gratifying for someone to show such approval for her job. Archie couldn't be more than ten, though, and she really shouldn't encourage his fascination…
"Is there a problem, Detective Inspector?" Mycroft asked coolly. "Apart from your apparently having immediately informed everyone in your acquaintance of your top secret employment?"
The man did something with his face John might have described as a smile, if it had been one. "That is, in essence, my question for you, Doctor Watson. Who are you?"
"I wish he had warned me about you," Sherlock sighed. It was already too late, though. His arms had broken out in gooseflesh. His whole body felt hot. He was ready to run. And he wanted, even more than to find a body, to hear
She stepped down off her dais, and her breast was no longer bloody and her skin was no longer white. The palm she pressed to his cheek was gentle. "I'm sorry," she said again. "That was cruel and I'm sorry. I was afraid."
Mycroft felt his face heat, betraying what he knew was a perfectly-composed cold exterior, and what burned was the knowledge that he had been outplayed. Lestrade had used his attraction, his
Having said his goodbyes already, John stood back on the lawn and watched Sherlock embrace first Molly and then Mrs. Hudson, bringing them both to tears with whatever words of farewell he had chosen. And they looked like
Andy nodded and picked up his tea cup with a face like he was about to walk hot coals. "It's bitter," he murmured after his first sip.
He heard a skittering sound behind him and spun. The white iron corner brackets in the doorway arch looked like lacy cobwebs. There was nothing beyond the door but darkness.
Henry's eyes shot to Lyons' face to see if he was having a laugh at him, but he looked perfectly serious. "Whenever you're not wound up about the dog, that
"I hope I'm not interrupting you," the man said, eyelids fluttering closed for a moment as he exhaled smoke.
noble. This Sholto business served Sherlock just as much as it served John. More, really. After all, it was Sherlock who had the most to lose.
They stood there on the beach like that for a long moment, John's fingers curled into the fabric of Sherlock's shirt, toes pushing into the sand, barely even kissing, barely even moving.
connections he could remember, he'd picked up a piece of paper off the floor that meant he had to end that connection. And because he fancied he could still feel the pressure where long fingers had grasped his thighs, and now those long fingers were resting gently on the curved handle of an umbrella right in front of him.
"No!" Janine laid the back of her hand dramatically over her brow. "I feel a bit flushed. I think I might be coming down with a little something this very moment!"
So you may have noticed I'm a week behind my posted schedule. Sorry!! I'm catching up as quickly as I can!
"Don't pretend you aren't excited for the next client." John looped his tie around his neck. "And we'll have plenty of time. Always."
"Then I suppose…" Lyons said slowly. His voice sounded deeper than it had a moment before. "That makes it even better practice."

John leaned in close and lowered his voice, even though they were all alone at the lagoon now that the plane had borne Sholto away. "Well, today," John ran his finger along the edge of Sherlock's lapel, noting with satisfaction the way Sherlock's attention was caught by the touch, "you're a client. This island is dedicated to
"This way, Mr. Holmes." The blue-uniformed flight attendant motioned him to his seat. "We've made every effort, per our instructions, to make your flight as comfortable as possible. The in-flight entertainment system is—"
"You're attempting to compliment me. Flirtation? Hardly necessary. Is this part of the experiment?" Sherlock gave John an assessing look and readied his pen over his notebook.
Sherlock pulled his hand away and took Andy by the shoulders. "We have you. You're back with us now."
"Why go out when we can stay in? The first date should set the precedent, don't you think? We'd start the evening in elegance, with champagne and strawberries by the firelight. And we'd end the night in silk sheets," Kate purred, "and then let the elegance go."
Lestrade put his hand back on the boy's shoulder and smiled. "We're here on holiday," he said brightly.
Preparations for Mrs. Hudson's family reunion had been running the entire staff of the island ragged, John in particular, setting up venues and arranging activities. He felt as exhausted as he had ever been since taking on this job, and it wasn't even for a proper
Radka watched as he walked away, and when she looked back at Sherlock her expression changed. She looked almost reverent. "How did you know?" she whispered.
Sherlock's room was done in muted green-patterned wallpaper, soft earthy tones. He had shelves crammed full of books and artifacts that looked like they'd come from all around the world. Framed certificates, maps, scientific charts, photos. Layers of intricacy and depth tucked away in the center of the big white villa, just like Sherlock was tucked away under that pristine white suit. A whole city and desert and sky for John to explore and explore and explore. His fingers mapped the topography of Sherlock's back.
something, you know? I think…" Molly bit her lip thoughtfully. "I think that may have been the hardest part of leaving, actually. Now that I think about it. Here, working with Sherlock, I felt like I was part of something
"Sorry," Lestrade apologized when he and Molly caught up, "I think we're a little…excited to be flying out. "
Andy would know her voice anywhere. His heart swelled with love and pain, but he was afraid to look. He hadn't seen her, after. He'd only read the report in the newspaper and imagined. Couldn't stop imagining.
John raised his eyebrows. "So you were…pleased with Sherlock's," he glanced cautiously at Mrs. Turner, "enhancements to the reception."
Sherlock's arms tightened around him. "I wish we'd had more time," he pouted. "Two days, not enough. I haven't even finished compiling my notes."
Radka frowned. She should turn on her heel this very moment and walk away from this absurd farce. But there was something…that cocky look. He wasn't afraid of her, and a young man like him absolutely
"I would introduce you to your new friends, of course, but since we're skipping the pleasantries…" Holmes's smile was sharper this time. He gestured so politely as to seem mocking past the fountain toward a path through the tall palms. "This way, Miss Wenceslas. I'll take you to your forger."
From his podium, John's view of Janine's potential suitors was blocked by the same panel that blocked her view, so he had no idea if anyone was actually over there. He breathed a little sigh of relief when someone responded.

At the time it started, it hadn't felt so silly. That dog, that enormous snarling animal, had bitten his father badly while little Henry cowered behind a tree, screaming and crying and unable to
Finally, Sherlock was out of distractions. The sun was low in the sky and the island quiet as he made his way back to his villa. He had not heard from John all day. Not that he had expected to. John's attention, he was sure, was otherwise engaged. It was a good match, John Watson and James Sholto. A common past. Mutual understanding and affection. Sholto was, despite the public view of the doomed mission in which he'd sustained his injuries, a good man.
A whimsical, little nude figure of a man had been painted on the brick next to the base of the door, where a sliver of light from within lit the cheeky leer in his green eyes. Like he knew something. Something about her. Radka bit the inside of her lip.
, so soft and sweet it was almost swallowed up by the sound of the sea, but to John's heart it was as loud as a breaker crashing against a cliff.
The man just tapped a finger on the handle of his umbrella and smirked, his voice soft, "I think I have my answer."
want to apologize. I'm the kind of man who apologizes. I'm sorry that you thought I was…a dick. Because I really, really…had a wonderful time. So…there it is. You were impressed that I'm a manipulative liar. Some kind of operative. But I'm just…a bloke who thought you were hot. As fuck. And…still do, actually. Probably more now."
"Sherlock? Is he here?" John twisted around in his seat, scanning the bar, the tree line for a white suit.
Sherlock's eyes, cool and amused, shifted back to John. "Ah, yes. Science can seem like magic to a primitive mind."
Sherlock looked thoughtful, but what he was thinking John couldn't even begin to guess. "Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade."
"True." John touched his tongue to the corner of his mouth and gave Sherlock a cheeky grin. "And happy to demonstrate them all. Even…" he looked back down at the list, "er, does that one say
John flushed happily, blowing out the breath he hadn't noticed holding. "Okay. Good start. No, that wasn't obvious, but I'm very pleased to hear it."
"Good evening, Doctor Watson. I think you'll find you aren't carrying the weapon you're reaching for, but I assure you it's hardly necessary. I'm only here to talk."
"Just a coffee," Sherlock sighed sadly as he shrugged into his jacket, but it was obvious theatricality. He
"My poor Janine," Kate said huskily. "I would be the soft hand on your fevered brow. I would be any soothing…or sensual…touch your body required to feel better. And afterward, I would bathe you in scented water, brush your hair, and read to you until you drifted off to sleep."
John chewed on his bottom lip for a moment. The back of his hand where Sherlock's thumb had touched his skin felt different from the rest of his body. Like it might be glowing. He glanced down. It wasn't. Sherlock had given no further indication anything unusual, anything

Radka's lip curled as she stepped up to the studio and, rapping the red door with one of her heavy gold rings, called Raz's name.
"The point, John, is that the sooner Andy Galbraith gives up this futile, idiotic idea, the better off he will be. Convincing him he does not, in fact, feel as deeply for this woman as he thinks he does will

"Oh! No!" Molly shook her had vigorously. "It was me. I mean. Not. It's just, I work in a morgue, you see, and I think he, er…was interested."
A bright, puffy little yellow and white twin-engine plane appeared around a break of trees at the edge of the lagoon, splashing and puttering its way across the clear water.
Mycroft blinked away a pang of memory as Archie ran off, all curls and confidence. The similarity with Sherlock-that-was, his beloved little brother, was almost painfully obvious, and he tried not to be thrown by it. "You…know Molly Hooper?"
Lyons' hand felt warm under his as he guided Henry closer until finally Lyons' hand was flat on Ushi's belly, and Henry's hand flat atop his.
The man huffed a laugh. "No," he said, his voice gone gravelly. "No, you…were a little…quicker about it than I might have been but…no. You've, er, got it exactly right."
Laughing Boy had subsided into hiccuping giggles and taken a seat in a truly unfortunate spot next to the bougainvillea.
"But," Sherlock tilted his head and narrowed his eyes, looking at John as though he'd said something incredibly puzzling, "why?"
After watching John gaze at Sholto like some sort of adoring puppy (clasped hands, warm eyes), Sherlock wanted nothing more than to retreat to the privacy of his own villa as soon as he could, but there was
"Smile, John! We want our guest to feel welcome!" Sherlock gave a sort of salute in the direction of the lagoon and fluttered his lashes as he broke out a pineapple-sweet smile. "Miss Wenclesas. Welcome to Fantasy Island."
John spared a quick glance for Sherlock, who was standing beside him like a statue, stone-faced and unmoving, before he gave Mrs. Hudson an encouraging little smile. He would be nervous, too, addressing so many people.
"Don't be tedious," Sherlock snapped. "Captain Watson, if you're in charge of this aircraft, you are acquainted with the man who arranged this flight."
want to put it that way." Sherlock's muscles shifted under the slippery press of John's palms. "You are the medical expert, after all."
"I suppose I'm just a bit…restless," the man shrugged. He looked at Mycroft's mouth and looked away again quickly.
working for a gang of international smugglers." Sherlock waved his hand at Andy. "He wouldn't stand a chance."
"Of course there are notes." Sherlock's gaze flicked to John's face and then quickly away. "But you can't read those."
"Ahh," he nodded. "I see. That sounds like Archie. He's had a bit of a fascination with death ever since…well, ever since his mother died."
They stood in the Jade Villa's open front doorway, watching the rain in circle of light cast by the porch light. John had his still-soggy jacket draped over his still-damp shirt sleeve. "I think Andy's going to be okay," he hazarded at last.
"This is Ushi," Ushi's owner smiled. He set his suitcase down beside him as the plane pulled away from the landing behind him and turned back into the lagoon.
Sherlock shambled around his desk as sullenly as he could and gave Mrs. Hudson a very, very long hug.
"You've certainly got everyone on their toes this morning," John said when he reached Sherlock's side. He had that partly-inquisitive, partly-amused look on his face that always made Sherlock want to come up with new ways to impress him at the same time he was wondering what John thought was so funny about him. John's face did that a lot: two emotions at once. It was confusing. Sherlock didn't like feeling confused.
"Okay…" Lyons scratched his chin for a moment. "How about this, then? You can practice on me first."
"Miss Hooper," Lestrade said, delighted, as Molly met them on the path that led toward the lagoon. "Are you on the same plane back as us?"
"Sherlock, he's not a bloody video player. And if you've hypnotized him or whatever, why did you need the drug?"
John's mind summoned up was not Janine-shaped. Taller, for one thing. Far bigger hands. "No, that's not…why would you say that?"
"You knew about this?" John pulled Sherlock down by the arm so he could hiss right into his ear. "From the start?"
Sherlock's eyes went wide and then dropped to John's mouth. The sun-warmed breeze ruffled the curls that fell across his forehead. "Yes," he whispered.
"No. I don't know who that is. I'm Archie." Archie hopped up on the bench beside her. "I'm here with my dad."
"Thank you all so very much for coming," Mrs. Hudson said in a rather tremulous voice from the stage John had directed the staff to set up in the main garden. "You all mean so much to me."
"I just feel…so ridiculous," Henry confessed with a sigh. How hard would it be, just to reach out and touch one of those soft-looking black-tipped ears. He looked at Lyons' black hair, soft in the sunlight filtering in through the curtained window.
"My employer's in the news industry, but I'm ready to start making headlines myself…in love, that is. So I'm here to give you all my exposé. And you can make that one as naughty as you'd like," she winked.
"That reminds me," Sherlock pulled his mobile out of his pocket and pressed a key to dial. "Mrs. Hudson! You'll probably want to set the fountain up in the courtyard of Ms. Hawkins's bungalow. Yes, the
Mycroft's smile was tight and smug and not at all affected by the appreciative glint in Lestrade's eyes as he offered his hand on the agreement. "Shall we settle the details, then, Detective Inspector Lestrade?"
"No, really," Henry put his hand on Lyons' arm. "That's really nice. That's…a good thing to do. I'm…really impressed."
"No!" Andy shouted, rushing forward, hand outstretched toward her heart. He didn't care. He didn't care what she said. She was beautiful. She used to be so beautiful. So kind. "Soo Lin,
"I could go on, but I trust I've made my point. There is only one question I wish you to answer: What is your relationship with Sherlock Holmes?"
Sherlock looked up from his desk when John walked into his office, and his expression immediately went wary.
. And you present me with this…this…" she gestured at Raz, at a loss for a word that sufficiently expressed her outrage.
." John scowled and gestured to the garish, pink-and-purple lit stage. Beyond the lights, an audience of shadowy faces murmured anticipation.
She called out and Ravi turned and waved, detaching himself from Paul to come over and give her a hug.
John was starting to notice that the more manipulative Sherlock was about to be, the more likely his sentences were to start with John's name. Just because it tended to
"Mr. Holmes. I…" Lestrade cleared his throat, shook his head, and glanced at the window. The sky was growing brighter. "I should go. I…have to go get my son."
And he had, hadn't he? Oh, yeah. John had got it wrong. "So…just a game show, then," he said softly, on a wry little half-laugh.
John did. In fact, he took a very deep breath. "So now I've…said that. And…Sherlock…are you alright?"
Molly looked around. A boy with big eyes and a tumbled mess of dark curls stood beside her bench, regarding her gravely. "Hello," she said back.
John opened his eyes. Sherlock was on the far side of the room, his back against the wall by the mantel. He was staring at John, firelight flickering across his face, unearthly, and lighting his white suit gold. John cleared his throat. He felt a little uncertain. A little…exposed. "Well? Do you think…was that enough?"
Lestrade followed Archie's pointing finger across the lawn, where Mycroft Holmes stood stiff and straight by the dock, squinting into the sunlight. He was wearing that snug little three-piece suit again and he had an umbrella hooked over one arm. "He's not a salesman, Archie. And he's not my friend. Exactly."
Lestrade looked Mycroft up and down, pursing his lips. "Yeah, maybe that's a good idea. She should be—"
"Everything. Everything about you. The way you're so quiet…but so strong. The…the way you can look like you're laughing and sad at the same time. The way you see beauty in the simplest, smallest things. And I should have told you. I should have told you when I still had the chance."
"She's a pit-beagle mix actually," he told Henry, smiling fondly. "I found her when she was just a puppy. Abandoned in a field near the base. There were
Major James Sholto had been one of the mostremarkable military men John had ever served with. Efficient. Intelligent. Confident. He'd earned John's respect and admiration quickly. Their friendship had taken longer to develop, but gradually John began to see the man beneath the Major, the dry sense of humor, and a sort of curious wistfulness that had drawn John even closer. John had liked that man, James, his friend.
"Finally," Sherlock murmured, tracing a finger over the route from the British Embassy to the Embassy of Japan. Obvious, really, where the documents were most likely to be found—there were only three possible locations that Czerny could have stashed them. And the guard's body, of course.
"Excellent. Come here, read with me." John scooted his chair over beside Sherlock's so they could read side-by-side and dropped a hand onto Sherlock's thigh for good measure. Because he could do that now. He glanced up at Sherlock, who was watching him with a satisfied little smile. Yes, John could absolutely do that now. He smiled back and looked down at Sherlock's list. And blinked. "Oh."
The trainer shook his head. "That's on me, Henry. That was all on me. I hadn't realized…it was that bad."
John slipped around behind Sherlock, who was just finishing his morning shave in the steamed mirror, and rested his hand briefly on Sherlock's towel-slung hip in passing. "Fantasy?"
"Hi, Mycroft! You make a lovely melon!" John said loudly, since there was clearly no reason for him to bother staying modestly quiet.
The door opened and Mycroft's gaze dropped from where he was expecting to see Lestrade's face to a head of unruly dark curls and a pair of dark brown eyes. Eyes like his father's.
"I still can't eat my eggs without a layer of Tabasco," John chuckled, and glanced up at Sherlock, "and I sometimes find myself walking in step with people."
The tile under John's feet trembled as a rumble of thunder swept the island. Sherlock always texted.
Mycroft adjusted his tie, checked his tie pin, checked that his watch was properly situated in his waistcoat pocket. He'd put himself together, but he hadn't slept yet, and he hadn't been able to leave the thought of Detective Inspector Lestrade alone.
He stood there for a long time after John left, and even though he was by himself, the villa didn't feel empty anymore.
Mrs. Hudson took a deep breath and opened her mouth to speak, then closed it again. She gave him a long, thoughtful look and then said, carefully, "He wants to care for someone."
"This isn't the response I was anticipating," Sherlock said, voice muffled by his pillow. "And it wasn't a complaint. And those aren't my thighs."
It was bittersweet, returning to Fantasy Island, although time had indeed eased much of her heartache. The breeze was still warm and fragrant. The flowers were still brightly vibrant, the trees still rustled sighs. It still felt like she belonged here.
After a moment, Raz sat down beside her, watching her. He looked like he actually understood what she was doing, there on the floor.
"You left me such a nice canvas. This her, then?" the young man…Raz…jerked his head at Radka, looking her up and down.
By the time he came, rocking into the man's hand and biting his lip almost bloody, eyes squeezed shut so tightly he saw stars, his trousers were around his thighs and his shirt was on the floor. His handsome companion was similarly mussed and manhandled, silver hair sticking out wildly in all directions.
hoping you might go a little deeper, Sherlock. If I'm to be of, you know, service in this job it would help to know what you actually need me to—"
"Henry Knight is a wealthy man," Sherlock explained, smiling into a sip of his tea. "A very wealthy man."
A dance floor, dining tables, fire pit, and a thatch-roofed outdoor bar all showed signs of heavy use, but aside from a few lingering drinkers and dark-corner nuzzlers, no one was around.
"Goodbye, sir," said Flight Attendant Sarah a bit too brightly. "We hope you've had a pleasant flight."
John was headed back to his bungalow when he heard the scuffle just off the path, and of course he didn't hesitate.
John pushed his tea cup aside. Galbraith took a deep, shaky breath. His hand in John's was ice cold, damp. Sherlock's was hot and dry. The disparity was strangely disconcerting, like he really was touching two worlds, caught in the middle. The room was completely dark now but for the licks of firelight. John hadn't noticed the overhead light dimming.
and I could make a difference and I…I promise not to, you know, hump your leg in staff meetings or anything and I…fuck." He slapped his hands over his face and dragged them down. "This is the worst interview I've ever given."
"Mr. Holmes, John Watson gave me the impression you paid careful attention to the phrasing of your clients' requests."
Our broadcast signal was weak overseas, but we are back from our short post-pilot hiatus, with new episodes weekly!
"Oh." John looked after Mrs. Hudson and Lyons, just disappearing around a turn in the tree-lined walkway to the guest quarters. "Yeah, er, I can see it."
John turned and then paused in the doorway of Sherlock's office. "I just wanted to, you know, stop by and tell you. That I still think what you do is amazing." He smiled. "That you're really amazing."
Faced with an ultimatum, a man comes to the island to confront his fear of dogs. John focuses on the work, because the work is what matters. Guest starring: Henry Knight
His guest was fully dressed. He was standing. He was frowning. And he was holding the Bruce-Partington folder. "This is yours?" he asked Mycroft quietly.
"Erm," Molly said. "Are you one of Aunt Sissy…I mean, Mrs. Hudson's family? I don't remember seeing you before."
"Hello, Mr. Holmes." The man's smile was calmer than his eyes, his voice pleasant. "I'm Captain John Watson. And I've requested all passengers turn off their mobile devices."
Sherlock shook his head gravely. "She would speak only to you. Did she tell you? Did she name her killer?"
"Well, before I choose, it's really only fair to ask…" Janine spoke towards the dividing panel, "what do
"You aren't a polite person." Sherlock glanced down the captain's body. "You're a person who's going to be bored waiting around for a return flight. And you're ex-military. And you're a doctor. And you're wasted shuttling passengers and hot towels back and forth for my brother."
"So." John adjusted his new white blazer as he took what he hoped was his expected place at Sherlock's side in the reception garden. He was bristling with curiosity. First real day on the job. First real day behind the scenes. He was eager for details, eager to prove his worth. "How does this all work?"
Sherlock scowled. "There may have been a…slight miscalculation regarding the inebriation timetable."
"One of the events was a sleepover for the kids." The man scuffed his battered sneaker over one of the gazebo floorboards, smiling down fondly. "Archie wanted to go."
The trees were thrashing. The wind howled. John's face was slick with rain and his clothes sodden. He'd made certain all Mrs. Hudson's reunion guests were safely on their way to dry cover in their bungalows before he left the gardens. A pair of last stragglers amongst the staff ran past him, shrieking and laughing, then were swallowed up by the darkness. John hunched his shoulders and shivered.
Sherlock turned just a little pink at the tips of his ears, clearly pleased with himself. "Here, then." He pushed the notebook over to John.
"So leave." Sherlock turned back to his desk with a dramatic flounce and straightened a random stack of papers. "Bye-bye. Lovely visit. See you next year."
"And that such a man's passenger would be entitled to certain concessions due to the nature and importance of the work your transport facilitates." Sherlock rose from his seat, holding his palm out expectantly. "Need I carry this line of reasoning to its conclusion for you, Captain?"
"What does that mean?" Janine asked, looking alarmed. "Of course I have to pick someone. I'm certainly not going home with
, really, that Jack had forced his hand. Learn to be around dogs, learn to be around Jack's dog Maggie in particular, or it was over between them. It was a good thing. He really
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he pressed a few keys on his phone. He was still flushed at the hollow of his throat and his hair was a complete disaster thanks to John's rather desperate attentions.
"I've prepared a special blend for you in Soo Lin's teapot." Sherlock poured a cup of tea from a russet brown clay pot. His movements were slow and graceful, exaggeratedly so, like his hands were floating.  "And I sensed you might enjoy the Earl Grey this evening, John." He lifted a second white stoneware pot.
Sherlock smiles and speaks, "Our brother is a bit eccentric and in his teenage years, he developed a love for dance and the human body, and well that translated for him into, stripping and sex clubs." John stares at Sherlock in shock, Sherlock's smile widens,
"Right!" Peter exclaimed clapping his hands together and smiling at Sherlock who was towering over him, though he was only stood in front of him, "top off then". Sherlock didn't hesitate and with a clinical look he went on unbuttoning his shirt. John tried not to stare as more and more of his slender but muscular frame was revealed, his skin is creamy and reminds john of milk, its not like John hadn't seen Sherlock naked before but there was something so mesmerising about it and where they were didn't help.
I would love to get some constructive criticism and also excuse any spelling mistakes or punctuation errors I have dyslexia so it can be easy for me to miss them.
The door opens and a man shorter than John must be about 5,5' stands there blocking the entry. He had grey eyes, that looked like a dark red in the red glow of the lights, looking further at the mans face, john noticed he had some facial hair, neatly trimmed into a goatee. John also noticed both of his ears had stretcher tunnels in them, and he had a lot more piercings on both ears, his nose was also pierced on the septum and had been stretched as the bar was a lot chunkier than the normal sized bar. Roaming his eyes down to his body, he was muscular all over, every inch of him was defined and when he moved his weight from one leg to the other, John could see every muscle in his body flex and move too, he was army ready and could quite easily take John on and have a fair chance of winning. He had a lot of body hair like Marcus but it was neatly trimmed like his beard.
"And so that's all I know really. My workers leave the same time they do every night and then never come back" Marcus places his head in his hands and ruins his fingers threw the thick mop of hair on his head. John looks at the man, who not only two hours ago, could have lit up any room he walked into with just his presents, who now seemed to be a dying light. Sherlock's face, which while his brother was telling the story, had slipped back into the detective's normal calculating look, had grown soft again, something John had rarely seen and that has only ever directed towards Mrs Hudson.
"Our brothers name is Marcus Conan Holmes, though he goes by Marcus or Mark, that's all you need to know for now, Good luck" and with that Mycroft grabs his umbrella and walks out the door.
John was quickly becoming more confused and over whelmed by the second, he had to say something, "Alright boys, stop, so you have a brother, who you never talk about because he was disgraced by your family, he took up a "
" that you wont talk about and he needs help but you wont let Sherlock help him, what kind of brother are you?" John looks at Mycroft hoping he had got it all right so he could better understand the situation and help Sherlock. "yes..." Mycroft says slowly, "But you have to understand that he's...
Without muttering a word, John untied the leash from the floor and tugged. Sherlock stumbled to his feet with the jerk at his neck, but he resolutely wouldn’t move and folded his arms in a clear not happening gesture.
The youngest Holmes pointed a shaking finger at Irene. "Take her to my office and make sure she stays there. Don't let her touch anything!"
“Go where?” John asked wearily, the light pouring in through the window suggested it was an acceptable hour to be awake, even if it was an unusual awakening.
Before anyone realised what was going on, Finn had given John the slip from the gallery and charged into the room, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s legs.
Sighing softly to himself, he quickly slipped into his shirt and waist coat, leaving his jacket on the hanger. Content he looked presentable enough, he headed up the stairs, tucking his tie into the waist coat.
“Obviously, but what next? You would no doubt break it in your attempt to remove it. How did you intend to get past me without it and without me noticing the lack of cage around your cock?”
“Do you want to look at that case now?” John offered, knowing he needed to distract his boy for a while.
John turned back to Greg, his height at a disadvantage seeing the few steps he had already taken on his route down. “I do apologise for the rudeness and abruptness of my sub, Greg.”
John had screwed his face up behind the younger man and poked his tongue out. When Sherlock turned around John acted completely normal, that seemed to help bring the boy out of his corner as he laughed.
Sherlock glanced at the folder and the few papers that were sprawled out across the coffee table and Mycroft’s lap.
John hadn’t stopped searching for the brat for the last few hours, everywhere Sherlock knew in his house he had checked. He hadn’t been outside, the attic window hadn’t been touched and the alarm hadn’t been triggered. With Mycroft’s assurances that Sherlock couldn’t hack into the alarm system without at least some equipment he didn’t have access to, John knew he was still in the house. Somewhere. It was just a matter of finding him, the problem was he was beginning to get concerned now, it had been a number of hours, and he was hungry so he knew his sub must be too. He was contemplating ringing his sub’s older brother for help.
He rushed over and removed the skillet from the hob and set it aside. The whole time, he kept his eyes on Sherlock. "Get away from that thing." He wasn't entirely convinced that the thing wasn't his uncle.
Sherlock grinned, the earlier thought of subspace long forgotten. He jumped up and spun on his toe, but put his other foot out to steady himself as he remembered where he was.
John had warned him to behave, and the clamps attached to his nipples forced him to remain upright and not lift his head too high.
"Oh, darling, it did, but then you kept texting me leading me on. What was a girl to think? Then you dumped me for your doctor friend!"
The doctor stared at them for a moment, wondering if Sherlock deserved them, but when the kneeling man began struggling John decided he did.
“Yes, sir,” he offered and turned to leave, he didn’t miss the look of the younger woman, it was a mixture of shock and disapproval. Why was there disapproval? He didn’t pause to ask though, that would be futile.
When Irene realised that Eurus had left once again, she laughed. "It seems you're talking from experience."
John gave him a moment to collect himself and then helped him up and onto the sofa so he could lay his head in his lap.
Mycroft looked towards his brother, trying to work out if he could blame him or not. At the look on his face, the two Doms laughed.
"Hi." The little boy felt more confident in Sherlock’s arms. He looked at the two girls with curiosity. They didn't seem very scary. He wiggled, wanting down.
Siger had overheard and he laughed. “You’re kidding right? I brought the boys’ with me,” he patted his own rucksack. “You can't go in dressed like that though.”
If Eurus had been paying attention to her 'girlfriend' she would have noticed the disgusted look on her face. Instead Eurus was watching Mycroft, who was hanging heavily in the chains.
The sub closed his eyes and hummed as he swayed. Despite everything, he was so relaxed he could actually have gone to sleep like this, almost had.
"Don't be a brat, babe," John said, raking his fingers through the sub's hair. "Come on, give me a smile."
Mycroft crawled over and stopped in front of the Superintendent. Greg had produced a damp flannel from somewhere. "Stand up, pet. Let me clean you off." He wiped down his boy's knees, legs and feet so that he was clean. "Back on your knees, now."
“So you know DI Lestrade?” the doctor carried on as if the small interruption with his sub hadn’t happened.
“Well as long as you abide by my rules that I have set you and you do not remove your collar, Greg is more than aware of the situation and my rules and he will enforce them. Should you slip up, he’ll let me know.” Sherlock nodded and the Dom moved to cup his cheek. “You already knew all that, pet.”
Sherlock enjoyed the moment, letting himself be held. He rested his head against the doctor’s."I love you too." He was now doubly happy with his decision. “But this can't just be for Finn. If I have to adopt him as a single parent, I will.”
Mycroft sighed, but grabbed his coat; his Dom was right, worrying about Sherlock all the time didn't help anything.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You’re nearly 4. That means you have another whole year before you have to go to school.”
It was a further 10 minutes when John seemed to be finished with his paper. He stood silently and walked to the door, shortening the leeway in the leash and forcing Sherlock to shuffle that little bit faster to match his pace and not get choked.
The Homes brothers weren't happy with how things were going. But if Sherlock was honest with himself, his feelings for Irene Adler had left when he had fallen in love with John. And they'd rather she have to stay here than someone innocent. He was starting to tire and from the look on Microsoft's face, his brother knew it.
"The other one is scared of you." Mr. Holmes glanced meaningfully at his eldest son, causing Mrs. Hudson to titter.
“Well it’s clearly from your brother given the engraving.” He cut off. “I mean an engraving from your brother, that’s a bit weird don’t you think?”
The government official turned around in his seat and looked at his brother. "I thought we were going on holiday because I was having trouble behaving. Now you're starting up?" Mycroft watched him carefully for his response.
The detective blinked, seemingly just working out where they were and then he smiled apologetically. “Sorry, sir.” He was speaking to John but looking at the DI.
He still wanted to touch his Dom. Tentatively, he reached out and placed his hands on John's hips. Just that bit of contact felt wonderful.
When he was satisfied with his appearance, he walked straight to Sherlock and hauled him to his knees by his curls, not even pausing to let the boy wake up.
"Just a small one. Empty him out, but don't untie him. You can always fill him back up if he starts giving you more trouble."
The detective’s eyes fell on the paper on the unit that Mrs. Hudson had left lying around and John had commandeered from the coffee table the day before. “Let me guess...” he read the front cover. WINDOWS SMASHED AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE. “Broken windows?”
John was glad he had mentioned his past without a direct order or question, it was showing resemblances of trust. But he didn’t want to ruin it so changed the subject. “What way?”
John reached over and once again checked his arms but he was content he had done the binder up to a suitable tightness, it certainly had Sherlock in the palm of his hand, even if it was only for the moment.
“Sherlock knows where all the private ones are too. I swear, he used to walk around all the time noting this sort of thing in that Mind Palace of his.”
He located lube and began working him open as slowly as he could manage. He was angry, but he wasn't about to hurt the brat. That was against everything he stood for. A second finger quickly followed the first as did a third. It wasn't long at all until the Dom was trying to work in a butt plug. It was wide, specifically at the base, but the plug itself was narrow.
Eurus dragged Sherlock across the room. He scrambled, trying to get his feet under him, but didn't succeed before he was thrown down on the floor again. His knees hit the floor with a thud.
Sherlock spent the next three days relaxing. He never expected to be at a place like this, i.e. with a professional Dom and be able to relax, not with the data he had collected on Doms. John Watson had completely changed his opinions on what Doms were like and what they stood for. He had just been unlucky enough to come across a couple of ‘morons’ as John called them. The facilities John had installed in the lab were just as good as the facilities at Barts and Sherlock really did appreciate it. Between the lab and sleeping, he didn’t feel like he was at some sub learning camp. He couldn’t draw himself away from the doctor for very long in order to have full use of the amenities that were available.
"Even if what you had counted as normal, the point still stands. My little brother is as far from normal on social situations as you can get. Worse than me. Look at his relationships… what are they all built on? Anything surrounding the Work. But you…"
The government official got to his feet and paced the cell for a moment, before coming to a halt. “Moriarty.”
"Strip," John hissed. He hadn’t ordered it earlier, knowing someone (he had assumed Mycroft’s men) was going to drop off his bag.
The Superintendent removed one of the nipple clamps and smiled as the sub kicked the floor with tiny little kicks, then he removed the other one. He watched as Sherlock scowled at the wall and then reached forward to replace one of them.
Mycroft made sure he was comfortable before switching off the telly and turning off the bedside lamp.
John pushed his head down so it was ducked submissively, then just stared at his sub for a while. It was rather intoxicating, watching Sherlock knelt so obediently for a change. He thought he could watch it for hours, but doubted his boy could manage it for that long. Still, he would watch him for as long as he could. When he saw Sherlock beginning to ache he'd move on.
John looked on fondly. "How can one man be so very child like at times and so very, very not at others. I mean, looking at him right now, would you image what we were up to earlier today?"
Knowing there wasn't anything he could do, even if he wasn't trussed up like a turkey, Sherlock closed his eyes.
The detective sighed, resigned. “I had a Dom in university. I finished early because I did my degree in 2 years rather than 4. It had absolutely nothing to do with the meltdown in the chemistry wing at Oxford. When I left I met Victor.”
“Good boy,” John soothed as he eased his cock into the cage. He had decided against using a sound, he didn’t want the boy in more discomfort than was needed right now, not seeing as the cage wasn’t the punishment... in a way it was to prevent further punishment that coming without permission would bring.
“I will uncuff you. When I do, your hands go straight to the back of your neck. Nowhere else. If I can't trust you now, you are well aware that your punishment could be made worse.”
Reluctantly, the little boy climbed up in his chair. He was almost too excited to eat, but it was a waffle with chocolate chips after all, so he managed.
Finn started stuffing everything into his mouth, hoping to hurry things along. It was Sherlock who placed a hand on the little boy’s arm and urged him to slow down. “If you choke, we won't get to go to the beach at all. Don't be in such a hurry.” The detective was pleased, however. Finn was a far cry from the little boy they had brought home who was afraid to eat for fear he would get in trouble.
John sighed as he waited for Sherlock to join him for breakfast. He had been let off the punishment after the debacle a few days ago, but now it was blindingly obvious - without a punishment hanging over his head - Sherlock was bored.
"But I threatened them to within an inch of their lives if they mentioned any of this to anybody that wasn't working on it."
"We are going to have a discussion. About what you think you do and should be getting out of this arrangement and your plans for the future. We will also discuss my expectations as you seem to have forgotten them."
“I did, didn't I? What was that for?” He was being obvious, but he didn't care, he'd get his answers he was sure.
Sherlock sat in his chair and Mycroft took John's. For several moments, there was nothing but silence. Finn looked from one brother to the other, completely confused. Then he got off Mycroft’s lap where he'd been sat and ran into the kitchen where he knew John was.
John looked on, amused. He felt the most relaxed he had in months. He would be content to just sit there and watch the others play for hours. He glanced down at his phone. "Mycroft and Greg are on their way. They'll be here in 15 minutes."
John shook his head, “no. No arguments. You’ll write 1000 lines ‘I will not be rude to my landlady’ and they will be done before I consider letting you off punishment. You’ll also apologise to her. What else?”
Mycroft sat in the dog bed with his back against the cell wall. He settled his brother's head in his lap and smoothed down his hair.
He let his eyebrow raise, stopping the smirk he knew was usual at this point in their... communications. He didn’t think it would be welcome right now. "Learning lessons, Sherlock?" He asked sarcastically.
? He had done it earlier when apologising, but that was under rather strict guidance from his Dom. Judging by Sherlock looking away awkwardly, he hadn’t responded, just had that entire conversation with himself in his head. “Sure,” he said for nothing better to say, after all, to those puppy dog eyes, he couldn’t say no.
Mycroft tried to nod, but couldn't. "Yes, sir." He breathed a small sigh of relief when his Dom released his grip on his hair.
He had apologised, hoping the older man would still leave again; ‘Come back down’ meant he was going upstairs, with his limp that gave him loads of time. He watched until the doctor had completely disappeared and the footsteps were dying out on the stairs.
The sub’s eyes widened at the voice and he took an unconscious step back so he was more than partially hidden by his Dom.
Sherlock closed his eyes, knowing that feeling far too well. “Mummy's not here. And she's never going to be again.” He helped undress his son and then lifted him into his arms to hold him tight for a moment. “See, I'm not mad.”
"More than alright. Thank you, sir." When John pulled his arms around behind him and cuffed his wrists there, he was completely relaxed and ready for the position.
But Sherlock stayed on his knees, trailing behind the Dom as he walked towards the bathroom. John poked his head into the shower checking that it would be big enough for the both of them and then began to strip out of his suit, hanging it all on a hanger that Sherlock seemed to have made appear from nowhere.
He watched the blond set himself up in the corner and began moving around the lab to gather his tools.
Sherlock knelt in front of his Dom, his head bowed slightly lower than he would have liked, but he didn’t take his eyes off the doctor’s shoes.
The detective sucked his lip in protectively, but chewed on it himself for a moment before begging, "Please, sir, don't. And don't leave me. I... I want to spend the day with you."
When he was within reach, Greg reached over and snagged his sub's hair. "Cuffs," he demanded, holding out his free hand.
Greg did, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around the younger man. It had been up and down the last few days. They’d made assumptions that Sherlock had returned to normal only to find him still this new version that refused to breathe out of place.
He could hear John and Irene talking to each other, but he hadn't tuned into what they were saying and he hadn't even noticed the coffees arriving on the table.
Finn got a 4 and moved his counter forward 4 squares. The grownups were still talking so he tugged at Sherlock’s trousers. "It's your go, Daddy."
“Um…” he struggled for an explanation that would explain his misdeeds. He doubted he could come up with one good enough at all, let alone in a matter of seconds.
John found Sherlock knelt where he had been told. His hands were behind his head rather than behind his back, which was more than slightly surprising, but he didn’t know whether the boy had done it on purpose or had done it by accident and had merely forgotten.
The Superintendent reached over and spun Mycroft around so he could see the view. "Your brother is damned hot, isn't he, pet? Just think of the people who would pay to see this."
Sherlock turned and kicked the hated chest of toys over, sending it flying. "Don't. Don't compare my feelings for her to my feelings for John."
John turned to gape at his friend, suddenly suspicious of where the conversation was going. “Greg, you can't seriously-”
“Hey,” Sherlock was on his feet and beside him immediately. Not caring about the expensive clothes he wore, he picked Finn up and started towards the bathroom. "No need for tears. It was an accident and accidents happen."
"You should have chosen me, Sherlock." She went to the chest and came back with a posture collar and karabiner. She buckled it around his neck and attached it to the cross, keeping his head back and upright.
Sherlock glanced at the door, thinking hard. John didn’t miss the flash of light that brightened the detective’s features, even for a moment.
He thought his glance at the door was subtle but John snagged him by a loop on his collar before he could begin to contemplate leaving the room.
The government official moved his hand around in front of him and grinned. In it was John's stick. The stick he had taken to the restaurant. The stick he had left in the restaurant for a casual race across the rooftops of London.
Sherlock managed a smile around the dildo in his mouth. Anything he could do to piss Irene off was good by him.
Sherlock was off guard the moment they entered the familiar room. Why weren’t they heading upstairs? Wasn’t he overdue a beating by now? Or at least a ‘paddling’ as this Dom preferred. He knew it would be worse than the first day. There was no way he would halve the amount of times the paddle would fall this time. This was also the second time he had broken out. A second offence so close to the first would mean a more intense punishment. When thinking this through last night he had thought through all the likely consequences he would face and he was sure it would be 40 with the paddle, twice the amount it should have been the other day, instead he was knelt in the kitchen. Again.
“A few weeks ago, back when Wilkes got in back at home, Greg was genuinely concerned. Not just for Mycroft, but for you as well.”
When they had both finished in the bathroom, the older sub set about making Sherlock comfy, with plenty of pillows up against the back of the bed and raising his leg up too.
Earlier, he had gone down to the lab for a bit, placing the cartilage Mycroft had picked up from Molly and dropped off for him a few days ago into a mortar and began crushing it into dust. He’d planned on comparing it to other substances John had accumulated from somewhere, but, before he could put it on the slide to analyse it properly, he found that he couldn’t be bothered and headed back upstairs to find John.
"Yes, it is." John grinned, proud that he hadn't had to tell his fiancé that fact. “But he was there when I proposed the first time.”
John followed the detective over to the body laid prone on the floor, he watched his boy crouch down and then lowered himself to one knee, grimacing as he did, he missed Sherlock’s concerned glanced and pushed his stick out of the way.
"Thank you." The Dominatrix looked over her shoulder at the object of her desires. "Maybe Mycroft will let us get on with things." She turned to look at the youngest Holmes. "Do you have Tiger Balm on this island?"
“I have a client today Sherlock,” John started from beside him. The Dom's voice startled the younger man who had been intently focused on the picture in front of him. “I am not getting rid of her because you have been causing trouble.”
"Good boy." The doctor ran his hand through his boy's curls, then he kissed him on the neck, sucking a bruise there. "I've missed you being like this." He tightened the grip on his sub's hair and pulled him around to kneel in front of him.
He spun and pointed at the women’s neck. “Her collar. Ten years old, at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her collar. State of her relationship right there. The inside of her collar is nearly as new as the outside, she has it off as much as she has it on. It cant be for work because she’s wearing it in public and she’s in the media as I had already deduced. So what or rather who does she remove her collar for? Clearly not one Dom. She would never sustain the fiction of being an untrained sub for so long so clearly a string of them. Simple.”
"We can... go back to holding hands if you want. Anything. Just let me figure out what's going on in my head." He didn't care if he had just contradicted himself. He couldn't lose John.
Sherlock’s breath hitched again and John moved on. He leant forward and placed a kiss on his forehead. “Go under, Sherlock, it’s ok.”
Greg matched his smile, spreading his mouth wide around the Dom. It wasn't just for his own benefit, though. The sub used those sounds to help gauge how good a job he was doing. Soon, he could tell he had John right on the brink, so he eased off, not wanting to make him come too soon.
“Good boy.” He sat on the bed beside him and raised his hand to cup his cheek. He smiled when the sub didn’t flinch or pull away through annoyance. “I’ll offer you a compromise. Think about whether you want to sleep with me or not and we will discuss it tomorrow after your punishment.”
The first thing he noticed when the door was open was the empty hall, the second thing he noticed was his sub's leash hanging from the banister; no Sherlock attached to the other end. He untied it, wrapped it around his hand and shoved it in his pocket.
Seeing the confusion on the doctor’s face, trying to work out what the connection was between his sub and this new Dom, he interrupted before the detective got the chance to answer to the clipped ear.
It happened about 10 minutes later. Sherlock had pulled a stool over and was stood on it, his hard leaking prick rammed into John's mouth.
“Well, you’d better get upstairs. Your room is the first on the right, and you’ll stay out of the last on the left. You have done yourself out of a tour tonight because of your attitude and you can unpack on your own. You will put on what is on the bed and only that. The clothes you are wearing now will go in the hamper. Now leave.”
The doctor had his stick resting up against the chair as he folded his arms, looking highly unimpressed. “I wasn’t going to, no. I was going to offer you a cuddle and a little relax before we need to get ready, but after that attitude, I think I will. Go and kneel in the corner.”
“I’m not desperate though. I can wait until you get off your high horse,” the lie came easily to the sub.
The sub did his best to accommodate the Dom's thrusting without gagging. Sherlock laughed when he felt John give up, his legs strained and the older man sank down onto the chair until his arse was flush with the base.
The younger man wanted to complain but couldn’t. He just grumbled behind the gag as he picked up the iron. John made a point to stand beside him, arms folded, watching his every move.
Greg held his finger to his lips and then pointed at the kneeling sub. Mycroft had curled into his Dom’s leg and had fallen fast asleep.
Sherlock moved across the room to his brother and glanced at the cuffs. "I can't get them off you, they are too tight now."
Sherlock shook his head. "No, sir," he answered quickly. "Mycie's just being- ow!" He yelped, stamping his foot as Mycroft twisted his arm a little more.
“You earn the right to be called pet and in return you kneel more comfortably.” He used this system a lot. He was sure it would work with Sherlock like it had with so many people before.
Greg, watching his sub, could tell what he was thinking. “I can allow you to speak with your brother, Mycroft, but no more. They'll be no persuading people to let him off, ok? Let me try and sort all of this out legally.”
"You better pick some toppings, pet," John encouraged, making his tone slightly harder and hoping it would get a response. Sherlock just pointed to the bottom of the list.
It was another few minutes before John was finished. He’d kept his hand in his curls and Sherlock listened to the soft breathing of his Dom.
Greg and Mycroft had stayed for lunch, but not much longer. The government official had meetings that afternoon as did John. It was only supposed to be a quick catch up after the case a few days previous.
Sherlock wriggled his arse trying to dislodge the nozzle, but it was too well seated. All he got for his trouble was a smack on the arse. He should have known it wouldn't work. Apart from that smack on the arse, he had no idea who else was still in the room.
“Both Mycroft and I did. We had no choice. Mycroft had a choice... father insisted he be allowed to choose his own path, but when... when she started doing things to me, I had no choice, father insisted I go.”
John took a hard look at the expression on Mycroft's face. The sub looked quite chastened, but still determined to look out for his little brother.
Mycroft appeared with the posture collar and a cock cage. John had to stifle a laugh. The elder Holmes brother certainly knew Sherlock quite well.
He was sure it had been at least an hour by now and he was beginning to fidget. He didn’t want to fidget and he certainly didn’t want to get caught fidgeting, especially not with how strict John was becoming. He had noticed before... before they had even discussed it, he had almost seen the changes. He supposed it made sense, in a training perspective at least.
John's eyes snapped open and he glanced down at his cock, dribbling precome. There was absolutely no way he would do anymore than that without Sherlock's intervention. Every time he lowered himself onto the dick he knew there would be a time he couldn't lift himself back up again, he knew that was probably what the Dom was waiting for, for him to involuntarily fill himself with more of the dildo than he thought possible.
Mycroft let his head fall back against the cross. This was all they needed, their little sister and Eurus becoming best friends, pals, mates. He looked over at his brother, hoping to see Sherlock pulling a Houdini.
Sherlock sighed once John had disappeared through the door again. He wiggled slightly; not enough to be called struggling, but enough to test his situation more thoroughly than the first time he had tried it.
"Yes! No." Sherlock looked frustrated. "Not yet. But given enough time, I'm sure I'll figure it out."
Even though Sherlock tried to ignore what Irene was doing, he couldn't help letting out a groan when she settled on a ball stretcher, at least that's what he deduced it was. He couldn't see anything and she had hidden it on her approach.
The boy whimpered as he was freed. “I wouldn’t get your hopes up, boy. It won’t be for long.” John could see his hands itching to roam downwards, but forbidden to do so. Somehow, from somewhere came the strength to make him obey and continue obeying. “Good boy.” John leant forward so there was less than an inch between their faces.
The sub just glared for a moment before he looked around the room, disinterested. He sniffed, before dropping back onto the couch, slouching once again with a rather obvious attempt at ignoring the doctor.
As soon as the water was at the perfect temperature, John took his boy's hands and helped him to his feet. They stepped into the shower together, the hot water washing over them both.
"He's a good boy," Mrs. Hudson said, smiling. She patted John’s shoulder as she passed him, headed down the stairs.
“Ok...” Sherlock mumbled watching it closely. Was he meant to be scared? He knew he probably should be, but he found himself not really caring. Too much had happened these last few days at the hand of one man.
John nodded his head once, then looked away. He let Sherlock wipe his mouth with a cloth then told him to turn around and put his hands behind his back.
It was a few minutes, but eventually Mycroft took over Finn duty and Sherlock came back up the beach.
Greg watched the government official lick his spoon. It was far more obscene and arousing than it should have been. He kicked Mycroft under the table. "Stop that, Myc. It's doing all sorts of things to me."
"Talk to me, Sherlock." Mycroft was concerned that his brother was taking to long to wake up. Sherlock had an unfortunate tolerance for many drugs and the fact he wasn't fully awake yet was worrisome.
He shrugged off his jacket and draped it around his brother's shoulders, then he wrapped his arm around him.
“He just got in the cab,” John told them. “He actually got in the cab.” He could not bloody believe his submissive.
Irene started to object, but thought better of it. She nodded. "Of course, Eurus, whatever you wish."
Eurus tilted his head back further until he nearly overbalanced. "There's something in your eyes that I don't like."
This Dom also used a tally rather than throwing him over his lap at every opportunity. It was a lot better than it used to be, but now he had to wait for the punishment in the evening. It was also loads better than living in constant fear as to when he might be hit next; it had always been when he least expected it.
With a last glare at the heap on his living room floor, he slid across the carpet on his knees and grabbed Sherlock, tugging his body into him and rocking him gently. “Shh, pet. Shh. It’s alright. He’s stopped. He won’t touch you again.” He was careful not to touch him in too many places. He would need medical treatment, but they would hopefully both benefit from this. John in a way that let him know his sub was safe back in his arms and Sherlock in a way that let him know the attack was over. He just had to convince him it never should have happened in the first place.
Sherlock glanced out of the window. It was more like a mini bus than a car. Having a brother in the British government helped with some matters.
John blinked a couple of times at his boyfriend. "I suppose... I thought we would teach him here. It seemed like the kind of thing you would want to do." He looked at the peacefully sleeping boy. "But he does need to learn to make friends. He's had precious little opportunity for that."
As Mycroft marched him along, Sherlock turned his head to look over his shoulder. "Is there something wrong with us?"
John pulled Greg onto the sofa between his legs and wrapped his right arm around him, then he used his right hand to move the fleshlight at a slow, rhythmic pace.
John slicked up the dildo and put it at his boy's entrance. He played with it for a while, pushing it in just an inch, then pulling it back out. He did that several times, before thrusting it in with a single, smooth glide.
“You're most likely correct,” the Superintendent said with a laugh. “I only hope you finally make an impression on him. I know it’s a lot to ask but please remain… hard on him. He’s heard the warning now. I want to know if he breaks it.”
“I know you are likely to get up and run tonight despite the warning I’ve given you about all the ways in and out, so I’ll make it easier for you to obey me.”
"Good boy," John paused momentarily to watch the kneeling sub. This definitely wasn't the same boy who he'd brought home a few days before. This boy was even calmer than the one he had spoken to.
“I've already deduced the menu, sir,” he said, tilting his head on one side. “I knew you would like the carbonara.”
“Before you ask, yes, these little holes are everywhere.” He used his control box to activate the magnet and the leash pulled taught.
Greg squeezed his eyes shut, feeling overwhelmed for a moment. "You've been spending too much time with those two, sir. You're starting to become like them."
“What do you want to know? Sir?” Sherlock added the honorific just quick enough for John not to add to the tally, but it was clearly an open rebellion.
Greg had done them both a favour, however, by leaving behind a few more cold cases for the young detective. It should hopefully keep him out of trouble and make the DI's crime figures shoot down.
Sherlock laughed and dropped down to the floor. There was a choice between reading here, on the floor or walking what felt like miles to the kitchen or the study that he wasn’t allowed in. clear winner. He swivelled around on his stomach and laid the files out in front of him, managing to take up the majority of the room.
"I can't work out what his problem is," John said, speaking to the Superintendent over top of the suspended brat.
The detective frowned up at the Dom who had perched himself on the edge of the bed, one hand on his belly. “Sir?”
“Jackson, here now!” Greg barked. He held John steady as the terrified PC helped cuff him. Then together, they manhandled him back to the lift.
Grabbing a handful of hair, Irene shoved a mouthful of oatmeal into his mouth. He swallowed the flavourless mess without complaint.
Mycroft followed him at Greg’s order. He wanted to shake some sense into his brother. Why couldn't Sherlock see what he was doing wasn't going to work?
“Sir,” he moaned, brokenly, how had it all become too much too quickly? He knew he needed to regain control over himself. But was struggling, he didn't want to come… well he did, but with John's permission. From now on, always with John's permission.
Greg grabbed the doctor by the arm when he tried going back to Sherlock. "He will learn one day. Come to bed."
John sighed. "That is disappointing, boy." He walked around in front of his sub and looked at him, shaking his head.
“That’s at 7, pet. You can get dressed at half 6. It’s 3 o’clock now. Do you fancy a cup of tea in the den?”
“So what do you want as your first reward?” It was obviously going to be his violin, but Sherlock needed to feel responsible for that choice. What happened next surprised the doctor and made him realise the lack of respect he had received so far wasn’t without good reason.
Slowly, painfully, Sherlock straightened, the back of his legs protesting at any movement as well as his no doubt bruised arse.
Mycroft watched him cautiously, as if the gag would jump out and bite his ass. He realised pretty quickly, Greg was more likely to do that. Not that he would entirety object to that even though he had irritated his Dom.
John... where was he? Was this some sort of test? A test he knew if he was left much longer he would fail.
The detective's eyes widened. He clearly wanted to argue, but was restraining himself. The doctor nodded once at the lack of argument and confrontational behaviour.
The doctor barked a laugh. "I know the truth as well as you do, but I still find him adorable. And insufferable," he added. He paused for a moment then looked up in confusion. "Are you scared of me, Superintendent?"
"Before you do anything, tie this to it," Greg said holding the rope up that was attached to Sherlock's bollocks.
The older man grinned and winked. He was, but only from time as a child, Greg never had reason to do it to him now.
Irene walked over to Sherlock and grabbed him by the handcuffs and dragged him to the centre of the room. "Guards! I want this man recuffed so that he's hanging from the ceiling."
John nodded once and turned his attention back to the older sub, he wasn’t concerned about Sherlock right now, his Panic had been successfully avoided, but he would keep an eye on him.
“No, sir,” Sherlock’s voice was quiet. He wasn’t near subspace, but he was miles away from Panic which John loved. He didn’t like the way it presented itself in any sub, but with Sherlock... it seemed to hit him far harder. He supposed it ran in the family, Mycroft destroyed things when he was in that deep dark place.
John smiled. He had half expected the detective to turn down the offer just to keep what he thought was the moral high ground. He was obviously angrier than he looked with himself and wanted to put things right. The “Thank you sir” had come as a bit of a shock. A good shock, but one all the same.
"I know what you are thinking, boy. But don't. If you do I will lock it up in a cage and give the key to your PA."
“Now, I have given you an order. What do you say in response to that?” John ploughed on when there was only silence. “C’mon, pet, you know the answer to that now.”
“You'll stay upright, boy. I want you focused on pleasing me, nothing else.” He pushed his head away and watched with amusement as his boy straightened himself back up again.
John stared after him… how can someone that ate so little and didn’t sleep much more have so much energy?
As a Dom Mycroft had privately contracted, John had promised to make sure Sherlock ate as he had been informed that he preferred to play truant when food was concerned, but right now, he still needed to be punished and the best way of punishing the wayward boy was leaving him alone for a while - not too long - he didn’t want it to be like what his previous Doms had done, the door wasn’t locked for the sake of emergencies and Sherlock could say anything and John would be straight there, despite his anger.
John took his hand. "The two of you were talking. It looked rather intense. Anything I should know?"
Sherlock sniffed, “Yes, sir.” He was practically empty and the plug he had inside him was useless, but on top of that, John was going to cane him.
John grabbed his boy by the curls. He looked over at the Superintendent. "For fuck's sake. Greg, would you fetch me a gag? I should have known better than to remove it in the first place."
Some of the colour that had left Mycroft's face at Sherlock's revelation returned. "I can't believe you met him and didn't- Nevermind. I'm glad you are still here."
The Sergeant closed his eyes and stared at the latch for a moment. “I'll see to it,” came a well known female voice from up the corridor. He hadn't been expecting that and by the look on the guys face outside the cell, he hadn't either.
Sherlock had also noticed the Dom back in his full suit again, rather than the more relaxed attire he’d become accustomed to.
Mycroft's eyes flicked up to meet his Dom's. They were full of confused arousal, his pupils blown wide and his erection hadn't offered to flag. "Yes, sir," he replied in a voice gone rough.
Greg snorted as his sub pouted like a toddler. “Fine, you can finish your coffee first. I’m going to go and run the shower.”
Mycroft looked down at his hands. "Well, I would prefer to put it in you, but I knew John would never give his permission for that. Pity."
"Take them to their cell, make them comfortable," Eurus ordered, leaning against the desk and folding her arms.
Sherlock knelt on his usual cushion when John ordered him to. The staff brought in their meal and placed it on the table, retreating quietly. Sherlock just stared at the floor, he'd made the whole situation worse, he had been getting off rather lightly.
Sherlock ducked his head. He knew he hadn't deserved an orgasm, as frustrating as that was. "No, sir."
“Do not run down the stairs!” John yelled after them, he turned to the rest of the room. “Well that was a pleasant surprise.”
Despite his own aches, Mycroft thrashed against the cross as the two woman used Sherlock's balls as if they were ping pong balls.
The doctor reached between the seats and grabbed Mycroft's ear, then pulled his head back through and pointed at his sub's feet that were stamping. "He can do that too."
Everything else fell away from his awareness but the cock in his mouth and the sounds the Dom made. Greg loved those sounds and he wanted to hear more of them.
Sherlock let himself be carried across the room. He loved being in John's arms, but didn't complain as he was put down to the floor. He kept his eyes to the front, despite wanting to watch what his Dom was doing. He wasn't going to ruin things now.
John didn't know what it was that ran through him when Sherlock was perfectly presentable in his suit. Yes he did, he grabbed the boy by the scruff if his neck and pushed him into the wall, before pressing his own lips to Sherlock's.
For the majority of you, thank you for your comments! They've allowed me to be spurred on to write this chapter faster than usual.
Irene's face burned bright red. She stalked over to one of the guards who was holding a riding crop and ripped it from his grasp. "No one makes a fool of me."
He grabbed Sherlock's hand as he went to lift it. Using it as leverage, he spun him enough to grab his other wrist. Sherlock knew there was no point fighting, he trusted the doctor and yesterday had proven that, but now-
Greg laughed and knocked the peg off again, then he turned to Sherlock and picked a peg, twisting it.
Eurus walked in, her hands clasped behind her back and her face eerily blank. She walked over to Irene and slapped her.
Eurus stood and hugged Irene from behind. "I don't know if he'd make a good servant. I still fancy him more as a work of art."
Sherlock obeyed despite wanting to stay with John. It took everything he had in him not to look over his shoulder to see what the Dom was doing.
John yanked off Sherlock's trousers and pants. Now his boy was properly exposed, but he was still sporting an ill temper. The Dom grabbed a leather binder and, together, he and Greg got it around Sherlock's arms. It wrapped around them from wrists to elbows, binding his arms together behind his back.
"Not. Yours." Sherlock hissed back. He brought his foot up and kicked her away from him, grinning as she went sprawling on the floor. Sherlock burst out laughing at her, and Mycroft was clearly smirking around the gag that wedged his mouth open.
"What about them?" The doctor made sure to keep feeding the kneeling sub as they talked, maybe multitasking was the best way to keep Sherlock on track.
Sherlock sighed. “Yes, sir, but I haven’t been fishing before. Mycroft does, I think, with Greg.” He had stumbled over his brother’s name. It was the first time he had mentioned him since the other couple had gone home. He hadn’t spoken when he’d returned a few hours later with some of the things from Molly.
The way John casually mentioned what the punishment was for his misjudgment added frustration to Sherlock's shoulders, however he was calm enough from the prolonged bondage that it seemed not to effect him the way it could have done.
Sherlock pouted. "I don't wanna be a good boy!" He tried to pushing Mycroft away, squirming and wiggling.
The sub flinched, he had angered his Dom and now he needed to face the consequences, he didn’t have to like it though. “Under the bed,” he muttered petulantly.
“Why are you… helping? I don’t… I-” Sherlock hid his face in the pillow. John screwed the lid back on the tub and clambered on the bed next to Sherlock. He laid parallel to him and put his hand gently in his hair. The younger man pulled away and John tightened his grip. “No boy. You’re mine, if I want to touch your body I will and you will not stop me. Now put your head in my lap.”
He untied the leash from the table leg and held his hand out. He was pleasantly surprised when Sherlock took it to pull himself to his feet.
Mycroft stood at the door, looking worried. As he watched on, John tore off a bite of toast and ate it himself. The next bite was offered to Sherlock who accepted it after a moment's hesitation.
"Up, pet," the Dom ordered, reaching down and tugging Sherlock's hand from behind his back and pulling him to his feet. He reached over and cupped his caged cock, giving it a shake. "No complaints that this little fella has stayed locked up?"
“We could put him out of his misery.” The doctor stared at Greg, his face deliberately blank. He didn't want to give away their answer too soon and watched as Greg went back to talking to the girls who had completely disappeared in their hole, sand didn't even come out anymore.
The boy let his head hang in defeat, he couldn’t struggle, not with the rope around his cock. Which was clearly the idea.
“You could have warned me, brother dear.” He glared at the government official who just raised an eyebrow in response.
"Thanks," John said as he examined his fingers. Sherlock hadn't broken the skin, but they hurt like hell.
Sherlock grunted, thrashing in his restraints. He was clearly feeling the need to anger the Doms even more.
He ducked his head as the shorter man raised his hand and ruffled his curls. “Wrong country. Good alibi.”
John snorted at the look on the boy’s face, but didn’t say anything. Sherlock needed to learn that what John said, happened. Whether the sub liked it, disliked it, wanted it or didn’t want it. And it especially happened if the sub found it embarrassing, humiliating or boring.
“Er…” she seemed to recognise the Dom’s obvious dissatisfaction with the younger man and felt the need to point out what a good sub would do, so she held up the tape for him. “Try the main road.”
Trussed up as he was, Sherlock felt calm. Calmer than he had been in a while. He couldn't work out why but he had no qualms about John leaving him there. That wasn't to say if he was left too long he wouldn't change his mind.
But much to the two brothers surprise, Eurus turned into the hug and wrapped her arms around the Woman.
The fun ended when Sherrinford came into sight. Mycroft's expression went from happy to blank in a heartbeat.
"Good morning, beautiful. I have to say I wondered what was under those suits of yours." Irene gave his cock a twist, causing him to cry out.
As they pulled up at the front of the manor, John noticed Sherlock's eyes were squeezed shut where his head pressed against the window. Rather than ask again what was wrong to get a rubbish answer, John clambered out the car where George had opened the door for him and raced around the boot. He opened the door, making sure to catch Sherlock when he inevitably fell out.
The guards had done what they were told and Mycroft’s feet were now chained to the floor as Irene whacked his cock with no repercussions.
“What?” He stammered thinking it was police. Thinking they had suddenly become non imbecilic to know where to find him.
The women left the cell and a guard entered. He didn't offer to help Mycroft get Sherlock to the dog beds.
John must have seen something of that on his expression. He stepped in close and kissed Sherlock's temple. "I can't believe I get to play with you like this." He tipped his boy's head back and kissed the corner of his mouth even as his other hand sought out his nipple and pinched it hard. A huff came out through the gag and John smiled. "Good boy." He stepped back and turned to look at Greg, he was nudging Mycroft's cock from between his legs.
“There’s always groups we can go to,” John added. “So you can meet other boys and girls that will be 5 too?”
Sherlock had a few words he could use around about now but he kept his mouth shut. His eyes sought out John's and he nodded slightly – he was fine, just shaken up a little. There was no immediate rush.
“Yes, sir.” Sherlock stared at the floor, wanting to be anywhere but here. Wanting the ground to open and swallow him up.
“No. Ice cream.” He pushed the table away with far too much anger for a 3 year old, it nearly rocked onto its side.
John grinned, “Of course, beautiful,” and then added a very quiet, “I’ll never let you out of my sight again.”
“Yes, sir,” he sniffled, grateful that John was pulling a t-shirt over his head and letting him wear some trousers. Mycroft would deduce, but at least his dignity would remain a little.
“You’ve lost your name again, I will refer to you as boy. You will remain naked for the foreseeable future. You will limit yourself to one word answers and only when I’ve addressed you directly. You will eat with me once again. You will ask me to do anything. Again. If I think you’re getting too rude or abrupt I will spank you on the spot, rather than wait until the evening.” He picked up a small wooden paddle and slid it into the pocket of his trousers so that the kneeling sub saw him do it.
“When me and uncle Mycroft were little Mummy used to force us to eat them. And cabbage and trees. All of those horrible things.”
"Anything odd draws his attention," Mycroft said, frowning. "However, you may be right." He stood and straightened his jacket. "I shall leave you in John's capable hands."
When it became clear his detective wasn’t going to ask for such simple comfort as a cushion – though this time he was sure it was through fear rather than sheer stubbornness - John reached over behind the sofa where he had a collection of proper kneeling pads, each one tailored to something different. He attempted to encourage Sherlock up, but just received a head shake in return.
John caught sight of Sherlock lounging back against the headboard of his bed, one of his long legs stretched over the other. All of his stuff was still in suitcases, the two or three he had brought with him scattered across the room. The Dom pushed the door the rest of the way open, allowing it to slam back into the wall. Sherlock resolutely ignored him, running his index finger along the patterns of the duvet cover.
He smiled shakily. “I didn’t mean to be rude, sir, honest I didn’t. I don’t know what came over me.”
Deciding that perhaps he needed to try a different approach, he pointed to his pants that were on the floor beside the detective.
Sherlock kept his mouth shut as John dragged him around. He didn't want to screw up, and knew if he did try and speak it would come out as impertinence.
"What do you think if your little brother's games, hmm?" She removed the gag and dropped it beside the kneeling man.
John had been angry when he had stepped into the room, he had few rules, but the ones he did have he expected to be obeyed, he had intended on letting the brat sleep in here with him in the near future and had been more than disappointed when he found him in here without permission only hours before he would have been allowed.
Before Greg or even Mycroft had reacted, Sherlock was pressed face down on the desk, one arm up his back, uncomfortably close to his shoulder blades.
At the knock on the door, Sherlock jerked in surprise, realising he’d been drifting away. John moved to answer it, shooting a glance in the corner, ensuring his brat remained still.
"The contract getting extended. Is it causing a problem? Because it's a rolling weekly. You can be out of it on Sunday."
"John..." Mycroft's gaze drifted to the doctor, "would you consider having him microchipped? It would ease my mind considerably."
He thought about Irene and the needle she had jabbed into him. He sincerely hoped she wasn't planning on doing something like that to them. He didn't want to lose control like that around her.
Irene smiled. "Yes, it certainly did." She approached Sherlock with the parachute. "Do you want to do the honours or shall I?" she asked.
The lounge door swung open softly and Sherlock jumped to his feet, it was the Dom. He wore a smart 3 piece suit, except for the tie, and looked remarkably like Mycroft at that particular moment. Had the two of them been sharing their wardrobes? Sherlock shook the thought from his head. That was just what he needed, a mini-Mycroft.
The pair of them ignored him. It was clear what Mycroft was trying to do, but they weren't going to fall for it. He would have the same attention Sherlock had. Nothing more, nothing less.
John watched him for a moment before reaching for a chunk of fruit. Sherlock took it without complaint and chewed. He made sure to watch to make sure Sherlock didn't struggle but there didn't seem to be a problem.
"Irene, you are completely useless," Eurus said, rolling her eyes. "Guards, put her with the idiots."
When the Dom returned he held a notepad, a pencil and a lap tray. He propped his sub up on the arm of the chair - his leg still propped up on pillows - and set the tray over him.
Mycroft set the tea tray next to John as quietly as he could. He didn't want to disturb the obviously deep bonding time the couple was enjoying. It made him feel ridiculous for how he had been acting. Biting his lip, he looked at Greg hopefully.
John smiled. “It’s not just that. It’s like everything that’s happened led to this. Led to us finding Finn.”
“I should have known you'd escape,” he whispered, pulling the kneeling Holmes to his chest as he crouched down beside him. He felt that if he let Sherlock go he wouldn't see him again.
Greg's retort was cut off when Mycroft shifted and made a soft sound. Both Dom's froze and waited for him to settle, then they crept from the room.
This chapter could be triggery, so I give you fair warning, and please please please do not leave negative comments about it, it was hard enough to write as it is!
He glanced down at his caged cock and nodded. He had thought that had been a dream. The whole caged again thing.
The sub obeyed and whimpered pitifully when his sensitive skin was tugged and stretched. He dropped his head to hide his face as he bit his lip to stop from crying out.
The Dom proceeded as fast as he could through the spanking and then picked up the strap and hefted it. "Count them, boy."
Sherlock looked away, but John tightened his grip in his hair. “When Mycroft found out, the sod ran, and at the time his position within the government wasn’t quite as strong as it is now… He couldn’t find him.”
“No, sir, I um… I’m not really sure where it came from.” That sentence just made John laugh even more.
Mycroft doubled over and grunted, yelling out when his cuffs caught and for the first time he realised his wrists were now chained to the floor. "I don't particularly want to talk to you either," Mycroft hissed.
Sherlock ducked his head - all he wanted to do was phone Lestrade, why was John making this so difficult? “I’m sorry, sir.”
Letting out a sigh of relief, the sub lifted his hands to behind his neck. To his surprise the Dom placed his stick to the side and knelt down in front of him. He began to unbutton his shirt and Sherlock whimpered. “Shh.” He lowered his hands to help and John smacked them away making a tutting noise. “I told you to put them behind your head, that was an order.”
"Double scoops, then." Sherlock bounced on his toes. He spun around. "We can eat it together. All of us."
“The same Mycroft who stood by you at the trial? The same Mycroft who made sure Finn got to stay with us?”
It was the last thing Sherlock remembered John yelling. Now he was surrounded by armed police with nowhere to go and no idea why. He needed a few minutes for his brain to catch up with the rest of the day… He had spent the last several hours with an Irishman he didn't know.
When there was no response John shifted his grip so only one of his hands gripped both of his sub’s arms behind his back and he used his now free hand to grip Sherlock’s curls again.
John realised that since he knew what had sent Sherlock into Panic, there was no reason to dig up the past further. At least, not yet.
Irene slapped him before the youngest Holmes had a chance to do so herself, causing Eurus to frown, though her face cleared quickly. "'Brainwashed' is such a harsh term, little big brother. I prefer cajoled."
“I thought as much.” He grabbed the collar of his sub's suit and shoved him towards the door, using the scruff of his neck to control him. “Upstairs.”
Sherlock stopped himself from laughing, but gave her a little shrug. He shouldn't have, he knew, but he couldn't resist.
“Am I forgiven, sir?” He asked after a while, he found he didn’t like this Dom being mad with him he
He sat, tapping his foot on the step, thinking of something he could do to forestall the boredom when there was a knock on the door. It came as a surprise. It could only be for Mrs. Hudson as nobody inside 221B had moved to answer it.
"Hands behind your heads." Eurus huffed annoyed when the pair of them obeyed immediately once again. "No, no, no," she said, stomping her foot. "Irene, make them be interesting. Do something to my big brother."
John sighed, but was still glad to see that defiance he had grown to love in his pet. “Who’s in charge?”
Once Sherlock was laid out on the bed, John began to untie him from the collection of ropes. He released one leg first, then the other, lowering them both slowly down to the bed and massaging his thighs that had taken the brunt of the strain.
Sherlock immediately thrusted against the chains pinning him to the bench. A reaction to something new. An unusual feeling.
“Thank you, sir,” he said his voice full of gratitude. “For letting me have it today I mean, sir,” he clarified.
Sherlock had initially played his violin in the study sat alongside him and John had revelled in some of the beautiful tunes he managed to pull from the instrument.
Mycroft took a moment to compose himself in the sitting room before he followed his own Dom to the den.
The doctor unpacked the shopping, buying twice as many teabags as he would normally, because Sherlock was like a drain when it came to the stuff and just as much fruit, because Sherlock refused to eat toast from the Dom’s fingers every morning. John couldn’t blame him, he, himself got bored of toast and he did end up eating the same thing as Sherlock just to save the argument that would occur if he spotted him eating something different.
He couldn’t order Sherlock to make it like he had said he would earlier. He still doubted whether his sub could form a sentence, let alone make lunch, especially if he wasn’t very good at it like he claimed. He wouldn’t enjoy it enough for it to bring him out of subspace and it would likely put him into a deep subdrop.
John should have been offended but he just laughed, sipping his coffee. "You don't have to stick around Mycroft. I'm a pretty good babysitter. And anyway, nothing is there to suggest this has anything to do with the blue box guy."
Sherlock let out a low whine, but the government official ignored it. Mycroft sucked on his Dom's fingers and licked them, looking up at Greg through his lashes.
The Dom contemplated cuffing him, but thought with the amount of compliance he was getting, there was no need, at least until he came out of Panic fully. Sherlock’s head remained on John’s lap as he ate bite after bite without complaining.
John shook his head. Kneeling seemed to be keeping the younger man out of Panic. If kneeling was what was doing it, he would keep him there. “Don’t worry, pet,” he said calmly, keeping his leash pulled down so he couldn’t rise. He leant forward for one agonisingly long second and the sub thought he was handing the leash over to the other Dom who had yet to speak to him again. This was it. This would confirm his suspicions. Instead, John opened up a familiar looking hole in the floor and locked the end of the leash there tightly. Sherlock didn’t know whether to be comforted by that or worried.
“Shush!” He ordered sharply. “I have already made you well aware of speaking out of turn. Or was I not clear enough for you?”
After 10 minutes, Finn began to fidget, kicking his legs out. After 15 minutes, Sherlock began to fidget, doing much the same.
Sherlock was still glaring at the older man. "Bored," he tried to proclaim around his gag for no reason as he struggled slightly in his confines.
He swung the door open with much more ferocity than he had on the way in and snatched his brat by the collar, hauling him back into the restaurant.
Greg had stopped stripping at his pants but he'd ordered Mycroft to take his off too. John did the same, and got Sherlock to strip down to nothing.
John let the three blows fall in quick succession, not allowing the younger man to acclimatise or get used to the new feeling.
"Stop it!" Greg's voice was incredibly stern. "You not only exploded your little lab, you disobeyed John to do it."
“Neither was you charging off after a serial killer just to prove you are clever!” His tone had risen and Sherlock rightly fell quiet.
"That's better." He looked over at John who was helping Mycroft. "See, you can be a good boy." Greg smoothed back Sherlock's hair, running his hands down to the clasp on the posture collar. He unfastened it and set it to the side, then massaged the sub's neck.
Marcus had showed them to the main club area, after agreeing to John's offer. Sherlock had threw all of this, had been sneaking glances at John, Though John wasn't sure why, he assumed it was because he had offered to help his brother, in a way Sherlock would not have expected and so John payed little attention to it.
"you have been reading the papers haven't you John?" Sherlock questions raising a brow, knowing for a fact John has, "what has recently being happening that could cause me to have to go to my brothers club?" Sherlock drawled, John thought back to the papers over the last couple of weeks, ah right, the strippers that have been going missing only to have turned up dead a few days later. The murders had been brutal and as Sherlock liked to put it, "
Peter's shoulders relaxed and he smiled back, "Can you turn around and sit on the chair please, Sherlock", Sherlock instantly does as he is told but avoids Peters eyes, Peters expression clouds over as he try's to get the man to look at him. John barely had enough time to register Peters facial expression before Peter exploded, "LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU!", Sherlock raped his fingers around the leather strap on Peters chest and pulled him up so they where at eye level, Sherlock looked him dead in the eyes and said, "You are not the man I want", He lets go of Peter, but Peters expression isn't angry or upset, he's smirking. Peter looks at John, "Have you ever wondered how to tame a brat John", and with one swift move, the spins Sherlock over onto all fours and kneels next to him pulling his head back by grabbing a fist full of black curly hair in his hand.
at this command and did as he was told, no sharp remark, nothing. John frowned wondering how Peter did it, and more to the point did Sherlock like this? John watched as Peter moved so his pelvis was lined up with Sherlock's arse and Peter adjusted Sherlock's hip position, pushing Sherlock's back so it arched more, "Like this, keep it like this" Peter spoke quietly.
", he was kicked out and left on the streets to build his own life, moving to London with what little money he had and some of his belongings he tried to get a job." Sherlock paused, blank expression returning to his face and then carried on "After proving that he could dance to the liking of one of the strip clubs in Soho, he made a living and got to stay at the club. Soon enough he have enough money and had a good enough reputation, he took over the strip club from the original owner and made "The Holmes Club" not very catchy is it? though he was not as smart as us he was still smart enough to know that if he made it as inconspicuous as possible, with a name that sounded like a pub in a way, he could get away with having a brothel and cover it up as a normal strip club" he finished and looked at John with a smug look, John couldn't believe what he had just said.
"why didn't you tell him what was going to happen Sherlock", peter asks as he cowers away from the gun,
Marcus's smile never leaves his face as he turns to John, " you must be Captain John Watson", he offers out his hand for John to sake. John take it and shakes it firmly "Yes I am, but please call me John", Marcus smiles, "well John, Sherlock has told me a lot about you, not to mention I read your blog, its nice to see what my brother is doing", John is slightly taken back, Sherlock talks about him, not to mention to his brother that John didn't know existed till earlier this morning.
Once Mycroft left, Sherlock turned to look at John. His eyes seemed to be staring right into Johns soul, like in that one moment Sherlock knew everything about him, which to be fair, he probably did. John shifted in his chair a bit, not knowing how to feel about the all knowing eyes that where upon him.
When the cab pulled up on a long busy looking street, Sherlock hopped out, quickly sticking his head back in and looking at John, "once you have payed John, wait here for me, I wont be long" and with that he disappeared down into an alley, John sighed and payed the cabby. Once the cab driver left John waited for Sherlock to come back.
"You allow your pet to slouch in public, do you not care what others think of you?" Irene spoke, glaring daggers at the younger submissive.
“Seeing as you’ve had Dom’s before and you are not a virgin, I know you have been penetrated before.”
John shook his head, sadly, so much anger still in the boy wasn’t good, but it didn’t make a difference.
"I'm sorry, Irene," he continued, becoming more and more concerned, his coffee forgotten, "but we really should be going, it seems my submissive is getting tired."
He spluttered and rolled over, defiance and anger flashing through his eyes. “What the bloody hell was that for?”
“But, sir- I'm not a murderer! I was nowhere near-” If he could just clarify things to his Dom maybe things would be easier. Or at least seem it.
He dragged him away from the front of the building, there was still a lot of officers going in and out as well as Anderson’s team. John didn’t want to show the detective up in front of people that clearly didn’t know the first thing about him or how to understand him.
15 minutes on the dot, John entered his sub’s room. He was staring down, whether it be at the floor, his knees or his caged cock it didn’t matter. What did matter was the fact that his hands were still behind his head and he hadn’t struggled or fought the leash this time. John found himself feeling bad for the boy… almost. He would have done the same with any other sub. Sherlock had over-stepped the line too many times whilst he’d been knelt at the top of the stairs. It had been uncalled for. But he still felt sorry for the boy. It appeared he hadn’t realised what he had been doing and if he had, he hadn’t realised he was being rude. John was back to thinking about Sherlock wanting to submit, but not wanting to want to. He had known from the first time he had met him that things would have to be different to how he worked with other subs. There would be a lot more patience needed, less routine because he was easily bored and therefore distracted and more second chances.
Irene had begun to push the plug into his hole and paused to stop when he began to have a tantrum. "You know this little show won't stop or change anything, right?"
The doctor nodded once, in relief more than anything else. “You've never heard of her? At all? And know if you lie to me I will punish you.” He meant it. And the punishment would be bloody harsh as well.
“Sherlock?” he rested his hand on his shoulder, the previous anger that he had felt at his boy had begun dwindling over the few hours he had spent looking for the younger man but the remaining part completely evaporated at the sight of him. He had punished himself enough. He quickly found Mycroft’s number and punched a text out to let the older Holmes know his baby brother was alright.
“I bloody well can and I bloody well will.” John snapped a leash to Sherlock’s collar and forced him across the room to the quilt he had set up on the floor. “You’re lucky you’re getting this much comfort. Am I wrong in thinking the last few Doms of yours wouldn’t have made such an effort?”
He sighed heavily. He couldn’t think! This flat was boring now! Boring without John and John was out doing whatever it was John did when he wasn’t with him.
“Don't look at me like that, Sherlock. I'm furious with you!” His sub clearly didn't realise it so it needed saying.
When Irene sauntered back over to Sherlock, she still had the taser in hand. "There are all sorts of places I could use this on your frankly gorgeous body." She reached out and grasped his cock. "Here, for instance, unless you cooperate."
Soon enough, though, a low burn set in. It felt like an itching at first, then it rapidly grew in intensity. It wasn't long before he was shifting about for an entirely different reason.
Greg had explained what the girls needed to do when Finn returned to the room, Amy just smiled at him, almost shyly as well and Beth held up the half made spaceship.
The doctor cupped his pet's bollocks in his hand, weighing them, then he gave them a tug. "If Mycroft wasn't otherwise occupied, I'd ask Greg to let him suck on these."
The doctor was just glad he'd got to him in time and that he was safe in his arms once again. He didn't know what he would have done, had he have been too late.
That only served to make John more suspicious of his fiance. He wanted to point out that just naming two vegetables wasn't a specific answer, but he was shocked he had received an answer at all, so he tried to think back to the last thing they'd had with peas and carrots.
With a smile, John ran the pinwheel over Sherlock's lips. His use of the device was expert. He used enough pressure to be arousing, but not enough to hurt. The sub's eye went wide in disbelief.
The look on the doctor's face clearly said he knew what Greg was thinking. "You're a Dom yourself, pet. You know the games."
With a loud deliberate sigh, Sherlock dropped to his knees, for once not making John repeat himself.
“I don’t doubt that you do. What I do doubt is your ability to do so. I believe after today’s events, it is not much of a leap that you will fancy a wander at half past 4 and believe you can leave.”
“Oh, of course, I know that,” he tried to convey his reassurance in his tone of voice, the elder generation of submissives were all the same. They had a much more… built in level of respect for Dominants. “And it’s John, please.”
The Dom took his time, tightening every strap he could as tight as he could, even joining it to his collar by the buckle at the top. It forced Sherlock to remain completely still, with the posture collar the way it was. John knew that as he removed the cuffs and added the fingerless gloves to the bottom.
"Look how excited he is, John." Greg pointed to a spot on the floor next to Sherlock. "Come over here by your brother."
Mycroft glanced from the Dominatrix to his brother with a worried frown. He didn't like the way Irene looked. She was far too cold and self-contained. "What did Eurus do to you?"
This may seem harsh but I will remind you guys that this is a D/s universe and this a common punishment for Dom to do in this situation. Sherlock had plenty of warning
"Come on, pet," John urged. "Let me hear how I make you feel. Let me feel your body react." He licked a stripe up Sherlock's neck and this time the sub moaned and tilted his head to the side to give his Dom better access. The doctor knew he had been right: complete and direct orders were what was called for now.
Finn yawned and stretched, then he abruptly noticed everyone was looking at him. "What did I do?" he asked, voice tiny.
The boy lowered himself to the floor without a word of complaint, but he looked thoroughly hurt and confused. He cuffed his hands in front of him, forcing the boy to push up on his toes so they weren’t crushed beneath him like they could have been earlier and then he cuffed his feet. Sherlock growled silently. This Dom was clever.
He sighed heavily again and rolled over, staring into the wall hoping it's blankness would give him some inspiration.
Greg had snuck up on Mycroft with a Wartenburgh Wheel in hand. Without warning, he ran it along the length of his boy's spine, the little spikes pricking lightly at the government official's flesh. Mycroft gave a shudder, his cock attempting to fill out in its cage.
He brought it down again, gentler this time. Sherlock’s yelps had long since died down to muffled moans as he tired, but John needed to finish this, not just for himself, but his sub too.
John knew this method would be more effective, not just in gaining his trust, but punishing him also.
Sherlock just sat back and laughed. If his brother could trust him to fly the helicopter, then the least he could do was return that courtesy.
"Good." The doctor slid across the seat so he could lift Sherlock's head onto his lap. "Greg, we never said thank you for inviting us along on holiday, so thanks."
“No, boy! You haven't answered my question yet.” He loved that debauched look on the younger man's face. It suited him far too well, and he didn't get to see it enough. He would enjoy it - revel in it - for as long as he could.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, getting to his feet. “They’re stupid bloody things anyway! I didn’t ask for them. They don’t matter,” he repeated.
“I can't,” the government official inclined his head, feeling genuinely sorry for the situation. “I'm sorry, little brother.”
He huffed pointedly, not really surprised. “Greg, would the station know where all the cameras are?”
The praise went straight to Sherlock’s head and he smiled slightly against the leather he was leant against.
"Oh it's you two," Greg said with a small chuckle. "I thought it was Sally." Almost subtly, he reached out a hand, snagged Mycroft by the scruff of the neck and dropped him to his knees on the cushion he kicked out from under the desk.
The Superintendent stepped between Mycroft and the other couple. "I don't believe I told you to watch them."
The switch didn't argue, determined to conduct himself better whilst they were on holiday. He put his hands behind his back and waited for what would come next. He wasn't surprised when his wrists were cuffed there.
The younger Holmes jerked the door open to glare at his brother, wearing nothing more than a towel. "Why are you here?"
“I'm assuming she ran straight to him when I kicked her out the car telling him how close to the case I am.”
“Me too,” the doctor made them both some drinks before settling into the seat Sherlock was knelt upright beside. He was proud of the way Sherlock had deduced his favourite spot in the flat and he hadn't even boasted about that fact.
Sherlock was aware that if he wasn't cuffed it would be his 'boy' position not his 'pet' position. The knowledge of that fact made his heart swell with guilt. He lowered his head.
"John knows you too well," Greg growled in the detective's ear. He held his feet still while Mycroft began to tie his feet.
“Because you came in.” Wasn’t the answer obvious? He wasn’t playing hide and seek with himself as the doctor carried out his shopping.
“Hello,” Sherlock whispered. Feeling ridiculous, as an emotion he had never experienced before became prominent; shyness.
Irene didn't answer, she paced towards the detective and reached down, snagging his curls in her hand. "Worry about yourself, Sherlock." She said as she pulled his head back uncomfortably. "I have my instructions." At that, she made a frustrated expression.
John tried hard not to sigh. "I actually like the idea of walking along the shore myself." He didn't say that it was because Sherlock enjoyed it.
Sherlock tried to move his head away, but it was something that wasn't worth fighting with the amount of his energy that had depleted over night.
“No, sir. Please,” his voice was almost a beg, he hated that blasted chair, if he never saw it again it would be too bloody soon.
It took all of his willpower for the Superintendent to keep his hips still. He had to bite his lip from crying out as well. Finally, thankfully, John left his finger inside him and added a second finger beside it.
Greg smiled and took his hand. “It doesn’t have to. It can slow things down until you calm yourself enough to see what you are doing to John.”
Sherlock had expected to be forced to eat breakfast. He had been expecting to be dragged downwards not upwards so he was in slight shock when the Dom forced him to his knees outside the playroom door.
“Enough!” The Dom barked, shoving him forwards. “You're bored, I get it, but you come to me. You do not act out. I had thought you'd grown out of the need for that.” He had the urge to yell
Each drop of the paddle blew fire through his arse, made worse by the fact he'd had nearly a dozen that hadn't counted. That had been wasted. He would be done by now if he had gotten his priorities right.
“You misunderstand, pet,” John interrupted him. He saw the worry on Sherlock’s face and reached down to cup his cheek. “Look at me, Sherlock,” he ordered. Tense, but unwilling to ignore the Dom, Sherlock met his eyes. “I was talking about subspace, not me.”
The detective obeyed, but swooned slightly and ended up grabbing onto the arm of the chair. “Sherlock? What is it?” The doctor’s immediate concern just made Sherlock feel worse. He dropped back to his knees and turned, head as low as possible, in the direction of his Dom.
"Mycroft, you may walk to breakfast. Junior, you get the pleasure of crawling." She turned and started out the door, dragging Sherlock behind her.
“Suitcase, yes.” Sherlock seemed to dismiss the older men’s confusion. “She’s contracted with the same Dom for at least ten years, but not happily.” He looked around for a moment. “She’s had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was in a contract.”
“Wow. A lot younger than Finn.” John thought of her being alone in the world with no one to look after her, no one to care. It was such a contrast to Finn who was so happy now. “Well, fuck.” His face changed in an instant when Finn had spotted the ice cream and came racing up the beach.
“Sir… you… you o-overstimulated my c-cock, sir,” he had to fight himself from closing his eyes, the usual blush flushing across his chest and up his neck as he spoke in such a way. It wasn't something he was accustomed too, although not entirely adverse.
"Better," the younger man praised, smacking Mycroft's arse again, then he dropped onto the bed, sitting beside his boy's prone form. "I'm trying to decide what I want to do with you today."
It almost physically hurt to turn around and go back into the living room, but the detective managed it. He didn't notice the way both John and Siger looked at him, full of pride. He set the stopwatch on his phone but paused when he heard the creaking of a floorboard. He turned back and took Finn by the hand, taking him back to the stairs. “I’m going to restart the timer, Finn.”
The doctor sighed heavily and Sherlock looked up in worry, realising he'd made a mistake when he saw what was in John's hand.
The worse part was not knowing John wasn’t there but not only that… when he had gone. This was bad. Very bad. How long ago did he disappear? They had been running… together, away from the cab and suddenly he was running on his own.
Greg reached out and grabbed his own sub by the hair, dragging him into the room. "Pick something," Greg ordered.
“The cabbie is your serial killer,” John offered. Of course, Sherlock knew that. Bollocks. That's just made this even worse. He won't touch the ground.
"Gregory, sir," the government official whinged, "please." He wriggled and writhed trying to get the other man to pay attention to his other nipple.
At that, the detective let out a small smile, digging into the Hawaiian that was now on his lap. He could handle pineapple on pizza. He couldn't handle mushrooms.
John made sure to feed him another mouthful before the boy realised what his plan was with distracting him.
“Yes, sir.” The word felt weird on Sherlock’s tongue, a word he hadn’t used in a very long time. “I consent to my punishment.”
He had no idea what or who his brother had spoken about, the way things were going he wouldn't get to know either. He used to love being on his own, but now... now he just missed John, in a way he had promised himself would never happen.
“I’ve been with you forever,” the detective complained. “I’m used to you, despite what I’ve said, and you still leave even though you know that.”
If John didn't know any better he would have said he heard a contented sigh from the kneeling man. He took a seat and ran his hands through Sherlock's hair again.
Greg treasured the sharp pull of his hair and focused on pleasing John far more than the others had.
“But it's obvious he set me up!” Sherlock snapped. Why couldn't anyone else see it? Why were they all blind and dumb and too slow to make a difference.
When he looked up and saw who it was, he pushed himself off the bunk and to his knees with a heavy thud. The action itself made him seem defeated. “Sir, I'm sorry.”
"Wha-" The sub shut his mouth before he could get in trouble. The next thing he knew, his erection was being fed into a fleshlight.
The Dom shifted slightly so he could lean over but still pet his boy’s curls with one hand. He managed to pour Sherlock’s tea before leaving the pot to steep a little longer for his own.
“You will do what you are told!” John snapped, but he didn’t raise his voice, he never did. “Or do I have to start adding to your already incredibly large tally?”
Mycroft's eyes had gone glassy and Greg smiled, he loved his boy so much more than he ever had before in that moment. He leant forward and kissed his pet, biting roughly at his bottom lip.
Sherlock picked him up. “Don’t worry. Uncle Myc is good for something. We'll have those papers completed and signed by the end of the week. Now, let's go get ready for the beach.”
Irene frowned, confused internally because she was the youngest of the three, but she correctly guessed it was Mycroft she was talking about. She stepped up to him and slapped him hard, then she shoved him over onto his side and stood over him.
John jerked in surprise, he'd been waiting for Sherlock to blurt that out, knowing he loved it, but instead it had been Mycroft. Greg agreed immediately and still the detective hadn't said a word about it. "What about you, Sherlock? Would you like some ice cream as well?"
“Of course. Once you learn to address me correctly all the time and are well on your way to becoming the submissive you should be, I shouldn’t have to worry about controlling that part of you. You should just let me. Now, yesterday when I left you alone, albeit momentarily, you tried to run. Though your cuffs will ensure you don’t get anywhere, you need to learn to keep still when I tell you to.”
He shook his head. “No, sir.” his voice was quiet and John realised his yelling had probably caused his throat to feel quite raw, although he did deserve it. He had admitted he was in the wrong and therefore was feeling guilty and ready to earn forgiveness.
He put his hand in the waist line of his trousers and pulled him upright. He undid the button and ordered him to step out of them.
Sherlock held his tongue until Irene had delivered a further three strikes. The fact he couldn't see his brother made things worse. He finally gave in. "Mistress, please."
“And what does your Dom think of you staying here, you’ve been with him just over a month and how many times have you attempted to escape?”
He had taken it surprisingly well, remembering to count off individually each stroke as it had landed. They had proceeded to cuddle for the remainder of the evening, the sub curled up on his lap sipping tea whenever John brought the cup near him.
John continued to stroke his hands through his curls as he tried to word what he wanted to ask. “You’re not going into Panic. You're not even on the edge, why not?”
John walked into the bedroom and stood at the doorway, a tray in his hand. Sherlock was sat on the bed, staring at his feet that dangled over the side. The Dom didn’t know if he had noticed or not. So rather than jumping to the wrong conclusion he cleared his throat.
Sherlock growled and kicked the floor with his foot. All he had wanted was an interesting morning and to avoid boredom. All he seemed to have managed was to wake up ridiculously early and piss his Dom off twice in as many hours.
John tapped Sherlock on the shoulder, having brought him a cup of coffee. "I know you don't feel like eating, but you can at least drink this."
He could just picture the man that looked over his shoulder in the driver's seat of the cab the day before. The way he had spotted the detective at the door to Angelo's and just calmly driven away.
Sherlock found himself being pulled to his feet and dragged to the stage, he didn’t fight it, there was no point, if he did and Benjamin got hurt he would be in trouble for assaulting a copper, and with a witness… John wouldn’t be impressed, he might leave him there… his face hit the stage floor as he was bent over it as his trousers were tugged roughly.
Sherlock extricated himself from him and rolled out of bed. He went straight to the kitchen and put coffee on for John.
He walked in normally, like the door was always open and went straight to his chest of drawers where he proceeded to empty his bag of clothes, he had asked his boy if he wanted anything, but the brat had had his head over his microscope and had done nothing but absently grunt in his direction. John had just rolled his eyes and made his way out, setting the alarm as he went.
He shook his head vigorously, no, he deserved to be on the floor, he had no need to be on the chair, this was where he was supposed to be. If he sat on the seat then it would feel like further defeat and disappointment.
John half wondered if the detective would pause to grab some clothes. He smirked when he reached the kitchen and found him still naked. Naked and kneeling. The Dom sat in the chair nearest his kneeling boy. "Can I get a waffle with chocolate sauce for Sherlock? He actually deserves it for once."
"No reason at all." John removed his boy's gag, just to see if he would say anything. Sherlock didn't, he just kept making the little humming noises that had started when John had stopped smacking his arse. He tossed the gag onto a nearby table. "Boy, Sherlock, can you hear me?"
“I've told you before, I'll not have you acting embarrassed when I ask you a question.” The doctor's voice was void of emotion as he spoke, his boy would behave. And he'd do it soon.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock responded quietly. He just wanted this over with. The quicker it was, the quicker tomorrow would come and he would get his violin back.
Their responses were on completely opposite sides of the scale. Mycroft looked furious, Eurus found it hilarious.
“I was under the impression, boy, that you were meant to be counting, or do they not teach those basic skills at the private school you no doubt attended?”
Sherlock took a few deep breaths, his hair still in John's grasp. “Are you going to milk me again today, sir?” He didn't feel as ashamed as he thought he would at asking that question. He braced himself for the answer, sure he wasn't going to like it, but he needed to know.
"As for the lying..." He began, watching as the boy's head snapped up to look at him again. "You seem to think lying in order to cover up the pain you are in is a valid reason. But it's not, pet. In fact, it's the worst possible time for you to lie to me. I need to know when something is wrong. I have to. There is no negotiation on this, Sherlock, do you understand me?"
Mycroft ignored the Dominatrix and the grip she had on him and instead turned his attention on his sister. "Since when do you call me Ice Man?"
“There’s no kisses, no ‘I love you’ just simple words, so it’s a gift. This phone is 5… 6 years old, about the same time you came home from Afghanistan, and I’m guessing when you met my brother and got into this line of work?”
“Try anything tonight boy and you’ll find yourself cuffed tomorrow night.” The doctor finished what he was doing and ruffled the younger man’s hair, caught off guard he didn’t have a chance to pull away and John smiled.
“In there,” he pointed, deciding to change the subject, he knew the answer to his unasked question was likely to ruin what had just happened if he began quizzing the sub. He turned to John when the detective moved into the room. They followed him. “Mycroft said you’d likely tag along if I got him involved.” He nodded at Sherlock who was crouched over the body on the floor. “This has been bugging me for weeks and I talked it through with him first, Dom or not, he comes first when it comes to his little brother.”
When he was done, he knelt silently beside his Dom, his knees cold and sore on the hard, unforgiving floor.
Irene smiled and moved her chair around the table, settling so Mycroft was between her and the youngest Holmes.
“I do apologise for my sub,” John offered as he reentered the sitting room where Greg and Mycroft were.
“You have one more chance to ask me your question properly. Without 'you know' in the middle of it.” That was unexpected, maybe there was the beginnings of forgiveness in his tone? It was all Sherlock could hope for.
Sherlock glanced at his solicitor, knowing he had no alibi to present. “I honestly don't know.” Maybe the truth would be enough? He hadn't know where he had been or who he was with beyond that... Moriarty.
