John married her and they are expecting a child.
I have dissected every word he said to me at the airfield but they do not make sense. Has he left me after all? Did I lose him because I shut him off again? What is the difference between protecting someone and shutting him off? Is caring not an advantage?
Molly stopped talking because she realised she was alone in the lab. That is, she and a box full of cupcakes.
“But you don’t understand, Molly …"
And then, after a flash of inspiration, he started digging in the back of his wardrobe until he found a T-shirt that had sneaked its way into the tumble-dryer and had never been the same. He had only kept it on the off chance that one day he might be required to pose as a … anyway. He held it up. Nice colour, the same as one of his favourite shirts. And the material was elastic, no problem there. And so it went into the suitcase.
It was as if someone had emptied a bucket of ice water over John’s head. He had to lean against the door, his breath going heavily. What in hell had happened over the last few minutes? He had asked Sherlock a small favour, something a stranger or any neighbour would do for him and now he was out of a flat? Had lost his home? He looked at his watch.
“You don’t forget anything, do you?“ said Sherlock quietly.
True, I sometimes thought that something was missing, that there was no real passion on his side, that he was more in love with the concept of marriage than with Mary as a person but he never gave me any reason to believe that he … well, there was the one blurry evening, the disastrous stag night, and I dimly remember him touching my knee and saying he did not mind and us sitting together on the sofa - something we had never done before, it was always the table or the chairs - of my arm thrown casually over the backrest, nearly - or actually? - touching his neck. And then came Tessa. And the wedding.
“Well, we both had to make our own beds.” Sherlock pulled the sheet taut across the bed. “My individual tasks included straightening up the sitting room, dusting, and taking care of Redbeard.”
John kisses Penny’s head as she starts to quiet. She curls up against John’s chest, her tiny hand grasping his shirt. He lets out the kind of contented sigh only his daughter can draw from him and leans against Sherlock. The other man stiffens before relaxing.
“No,” John said. “I asked you here.”
Human error, he supposed. He once mocked Irene Adler for falling prey to it. It was ironic that the same thing that caused him to panic just three days after their visit to Baker Street. Because he had gotten too comfortable, too caught up in his feelings that he forgot something massively important.
“You lost focus for nearly a minute, which tells me that you were thinking about something that has been consuming your thoughts for a long time. When I asked you about your reasoning for talking about my sister, you were immediately defensive and responded with something that is only partially true.”
“Let’s hope nothing of the sort happens,” said Sherlock roughly. “Rosamund needs her father.”
Instead, he found Sherlock, standing in the sitting room, looking astonished.
“If he dies,” said John, his voice scarily calm, “I will never forgive you. And I will make your life hell.”
“Oh. I just assumed you were from London. You don’t seem like the country type.”
He shuffled to the kitchen to switch his lukewarm tea out for some water. His eyes jumped to the cupboard above the oven, where his scotch was still stashed. He hadn’t brought it out since Sherlock had moved in, primarily because he didn’t feel the need to have it. Sherlock had a way of silencing the thoughts inside his head that he wanted to dull with alcohol. It was like his superpower, one he didn’t even know he had. John was grateful for it.
His whole body ached, and his hands shook so much he had trouble unbuttoning his trousers that night. It was quite obvious what was happening, but he steadfastly refused to admit it. He wasn’t an addict; he was completely fine.
“If I do,” Sherlock says, “you have to promise it won’t change anything.”
Sherlock and John parted, gazing into each other’s eyes. They silently agreed to continue things later before turning to their daughter.
seeing Sherlock hold his daughter so tenderly and carefully, all John wants to do was kiss him until he can’t breathe.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I never sound pleasant. What do you want?”
John shoved the sickening thought away and focused again on his surroundings. He was in hospital, and he was alive. Both good things to know. The room he was in seemed quiet, but if strained his ears enough he thought he could make out the occasional sigh.
“What?”
“Sh’lock?” His tongue was heavy in his mouth, and his throat was still impossibly dry. This time, he managed to open his eyes wider, and once his vision cleared, he could see Sherlock sitting beside the bed. He was clean-shaven once more, though the rest of his appearance spoke of the recent health crisis he’d been through. His face was too pale, the bags under his eyes too dark. His skin still seemed tight around his bones.
“And we’re going out?” Sherlock asked, stepping away from John. John nodded and snatched Sherlock’s coat off its hook. He shoved it into Sherlock’s arms.
John hesitated before answering. Somehow,
He turns on his heel and walks straight out of the sitting room. Up the stairs, into his bedroom, over to the cot in the corner where he gently lays Penny down. Makes a quick stop at his nightstand to pick up the baby monitor sitting there before returning downstairs.
John alternated between eating his dinner and feeding Rosie. Sherlock watched with keen eyes, and in any other situation, his attentiveness would have felt awkward. Instead, it made John inexplicably happy.
“Mm, clearly,” Sherlock said, eyes never leaving the file. “Hence why you’re here seeking my assistance.”
His fingers twitched at his side. One couldn’t hurt…
Upstairs, there was a sudden pounding of feet. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at the clock once more. 7:00. It was time.
John grabbed his arm. “But who will keep
Sherlock wished he could’ve known her. “She sounds wonderful.”
“Molly. I didn’t realize you were coming over.”
And now,
“Yeah, but you never do. I always did the shopping. You did it maybe five times.”
“They’ve been a bloody couple for years,” Greg declared. “They’re just the only ones who don’t know. Something tells me they’ll figure it out soon though.”
Sherlock eventually fell silent, but John wasn’t able to fall asleep. Instead, he found himself reaching for the monitor and tucking it under his pillow.
, golden boy cared about him and he barely knew him. How? Sherlock was insufferable, obnoxious, arrogant, practically a sociopath. How on earth could John care for someone like
he thought.
Was he in love with Sherlock? It was easy to dismiss, but the second he did it he wondered if he was wrong in doing so.
“Yes,” Sherlock whispered. John’s eyes crinkled with sympathy.
“You were a bit busy,” Lestrade snapped. “And I’m capable of solving a case on my own, thanks.”
“You’ve made her upset,” he said. “I hope you’re happy.”
Rosie snuffled in his arms, and John’s eyes jumped down to her. His expression became wistful.
“And… you still consider me to be your best friend?”
John’s expression shifted, and now he looked devastated. Sherlock’s heart clenched at the sight. Why was it he couldn’t stop causing this man pain?
“You bastard,” John managed. “You cut me off!”
Sherlock sped through the rest of his list and steered them to the checkout line, desperate to be out of this godforsaken store. When deciding to get the shopping done early, he had planned to draw it out for a long as possible so that he could put off going back to John’s house, but he underestimated how much he despised it. The people, the endless amounts of foods, the
“Watson,” he said, keeping his voice low once he reached the nursery. “You’ll wake your father up with your crying.”
“It’s not what you think. I believe you’ll approve of this.”
John’s stomach turned. He stood abruptly from the couch and picked up the cupcake. Walking into the kitchen made the ache in his body grow even more when he saw the remains of their dinner on the table. He had refrained from cleaning up in favor of skipping ahead to the part where he got to sit close to Sherlock on the couch.
Sherlock wasn’t looking at him, his gaze firmly fixed on his long fingers, which were smoothing out an invisible crease in his gray trousers. It was as though he wasn’t used to all this genuine praise. Sure, his mind was complimented frequently by all who beheld it (most often by John), but few people spoke to his kindness and compassion. That was most likely because few people saw it, but even those who knew it was there didn’t always speak up. It made John quite sad.
John stood rooted in the spot while Sherlock was walking away. Something was off since they had got here. He remembered when in the Caffè Florian Sherlock had mentioned romance, being his old distant and cool self. Romance, but not for me, was the implication. And John had felt rejected, which was ridiculous, but he could not shake off the feeling.
John swallows. He told her about the drugs so this is not what she is getting at. But what else could it be?
There is something he cannot put his finger on, something nagging at him while he watches her disappearing from the hospital lobby.
And then they suddenly stood in the street that was dark and deserted, Sherlock with blood on his white dress shirt, John in a dirty dinner suit.
Instant recognition of skip code.
Sherlock relented and followed John upstairs to his room. “Have you ever heard of Travelonymous?“
"But what is it then?"
When the warm drops hit John‘s face his mouth turns into a smile. Then his eyes close, his head dropping to the side.
Sherlock grabbed the keys and dragged John after him toward the stairs.
He remembered sitting in Ella’s consulting room, unable to express how he felt about losing Sherlock. Even alone at the grave he had struggled to find the right words. And in the tube carriage, expecting to die with Sherlock, he had only managed to gasp out some completely insufficient words. And then there was that intense moment in the hallway before meeting the press. All he had wanted to say was “I'm glad you’re back. I missed you.“ And again his mouth had refused to form the words.
For a moment he allows himself to think that he might say it now, before it is too late, before he will never be able to say it. And stops. He stops before the words leave his mouth and goes for a joke. Tries to leave John with a laugh on his face.
- now that the horse has bolted.
A small smile steals over her face. ”Well, Mr Holmes, the operation was difficult. You lost a lot of blood, needed several transfusions, we had to execute a median sternotomy which, as your own personal doctor already told you, will take a long time to heal. There will be physiotherapy as soon as you are well enough. And probably withdrawal symptoms from the morphine. Was that clear enough?“
John rolled his eyes. “For Heaven’s sake, yes. Don’t put me on the rack.“
John put the box of cupcakes on the counter.
Mary is brought to a high-security facility where they save her life thereby ensuring her lifelong imprisonment. Mycroft tells me when he meets me at the hospital.
“Including …?“
Before John found him bleeding out on a floor. Again.
”You don‘t say.“
”But why?“ It seems he truly does not know.
The thought somehow brings back his earlier sadness. Sherlock tries to distract himself by entering a bakery, buying a small
He opens a drawer in the intricately decorated filing cabinet and takes out his book of lists. He likes making lists. He has one about the shortcomings of his own mother and he also kept the one of people who hated Mary – he really should have seen it coming – and now he looks at a new one, captioned:
"No."
Stuck in a clean little cell with nothing to stimulate his brain, not even drugs – although he might give it a try, tell the warden with the Financial Times in his pocket about that big upcoming Government contract for this IT company in exchange for a little favour –
“What?“ she asked breathlessly, wiping some crumbs from her mouth.
Moriarty throwing the stick into the pool. Moriarty putting the gun into his mouth and pulling the trigger.
When he is finished, she leans back. ‘I see. So what you are telling me is this: Sherlock pretended to commit suicide and left London for two years in order to dismantle a criminal network. He came back and found his former life had irrevocably changed. You had moved out of the flat you shared, taken on a job in a surgery, and met a woman. You married this woman. Sherlock was your best man and did everything in order to ensure you had an unforgettable wedding. On the evening of the same wedding, he left without saying a word. You did not see him for the weeks that followed, until you found him in a drug den, on the morning of the day he was shot in the chest during an investigation. Is this the gist of it?’
”No.“ His voice sounds strangely choked and I finally look at him. ”It is about the thrill of being with you. Of seeing you at work. Of you being brilliant, of you helping people even if you pretend it is just for the sake of the game. Of snatching the tiny moments in which you let me see … behind the facade.“
John can’t really argue with that, but it still somehow feels like a defeat.
“You know what I mean.” John shifted uncomfortably under the prospect having upset his friend, thus drawing attention to the fact that said friend still held him close and secure. The hand above his stomach calmed him, with its warm weight.
John felt his face fall and tried his best to mask the growing uneasiness making him nauseous.  He put on a pained smile when Lestrade approached him, eyes never leaving the now delighted giggling Rosie who was scooped up in his partner’s arms.
“Sherlock?” John queried, getting nervous. “Is everything okay?” he searched his partners face for any clues. “Who did you piss off today?”
Low whispers of agreement; the atmosphere in the car shifts momentarily, as they all reminiscent of how hard it must be to lose a loved one so unexpectedly.
John rushed to the kindergarten as soon as his early shift had ended, and cursed himself mentally for thinking they could have a quiet family day. They all longed for one, the last week had been cramped with cases and surgery shifts. Of course, John was disappointed that Sherlock wasn’t there,
Lovely atmosphere in the Watson-Holmes household.
Like their flat, where they would share occasional kisses and hugs- touches that came so surprising and sweet, they left John feeling breathless and giddy at the same time. He was in love.
Mycroft went off to the bathroom area to dress in a more appropriate attire, meaning a suit that wasn’t as expensive and made of lighter material. John remarked he still looked quite fancy nonetheless, especially compared to Greg’s band t-shirt and cut-off-at-the-knee jeans look. Before the politician could educate them on the “highest requirement when standing in her majesty’s service, which is to always dress impeccable, thank you very much”, Greg placed his obnoxiously large sunhat on Mycroft’s, quote, “pretty little ginger head” and shushed him away, to go play with Sherlock and Rosie.
Still, it was sort of surprising. John’s right hand was wandering from thumbing a perk nipple softly, to Sherlock’s hip, daringly lower- while he kissed the younger man’s neck with vigor he hadn’t felt in a long time; while he scratched his friend’s sensitive scalp with skilled movements- lower still, until…
“He is sulking, I’m presuming?” He motioned to Sherlock’s closed bedroom door with his teacup. Glad to have a conversation starter, John latched right in: “He’s in a mood”
God, did he know.
an attractive man, mate. If I wasn’t married, I’d totally tap that!”
He gets it because he knows this look so well, and he knows how this look feels like. He’s no stranger to self-doubt and has, over the years, become attuned to it when Sherlock allowed him to glimpse past his armor of arrogance and intellect.
“Lestrade, I DEMAND you to let go of me AT ONCE-“
“Now don’t you be daft. I’ve deduced that ages ago.”
The other man just smiles and listens; in all his short time with John Watson he had never heard the man talking so freely and animatedly as he is now. Karamo thinks idly to himself about just how much is gained when we tear down the walls we built around ourselves.
. And he feels good, too. Better, in fact, then he had in months. He tells Tan as much.
~ A little while later~
He didn’t know where this strike of caretaking came from, but he was grateful for it. If he actually tried to solve this problem with logic, his head might explode. Or his heart shattered a little more. This conversation was much too big to hold it so early in the morning. They weren’t ready. Hell, they’d probably never be. But, that wasn’t the point. The only point was to give John the feeling that he was cared for. That he wouldn’t be left alone again. That Sherlock was
They held hands during the whole cab ride back to Baker Street. Neither of them felt the need to speak or look at the other; the silent presence was ensured by their tightly clasped hands. John was still angry. Angry about the whole fucked-up situation.
Sherlock snorted.
“That’s the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard, I am Sherlock Holmes, I don’t crush on actors like some kind of- “
The tipsy detective turned at the sound of his name, and the glance he threw in John’s direction was enough for the doctor to sober up completely. There was a fight in those eyes. But also vulnerability, carefully masked by Sherlock’s usual cocky behavior.
Sometimes, when it was six am and Sherlock wasn’t in bed with him, when he buried his nose in the cold pillow to smell fancy body wash and rain and
“Gentle breaths, yeah? Everything’s fine” Sherlock had started, as he belatedly and to his annoyance realized, to hyperventilate a little bit.
“’His side’?! C’mon, we both know that’s absurd”
Yet everything didn’t matter, everything faded away, when he heard two words, hastily mumbled: “Thank you”.
“I see, then take care my little scientists”. John leaned in and gave Rosie a soundful kiss, the kind of tickly, sweet Daddy-kisses she liked best, on her smiling mouth. He the brushed Sherlock’s arm in an affectionate gesture (They grew more and more acuminated to physical touch, and John had to admit that he was more than a little happy about it; Sherlock’s hugs were the best kind of hugs), and tipped his head slightly upwards to thank Sherlock for his babysitting, when something happened that John had not been ready for.
Greg swallowed around the lump in his throat. Yep, here goes nothing. “Sherlock, listen. When you were gone-“ the young man made a face, but the DI dismissed any snide remarks with a sharp glare. “John was…… not fine” Well, that was the understatement of the century. “He had a hard time…. Getting over you. We all had, but John…” Some unwilling memories pushed themselves into his mind.
“Enough of that,” Sherlock interrupted. John heard rather than saw him getting out some food, most likely for Rosie. He sniffed and moved out of the way, still keeping his back to Sherlock. “I’ve forgiven you. We can’t keep letting the past drown us. Moving forward is our only option. It’s the only way we’ll get better.”
“Is it so absurd,” Sherlock ventured, “to believe I thoroughly enjoy my time here and do not particularly relish the idea of ending it?
He licked his lips. Shuffled a bit closer. Sherlock’s eyes widened ever so slightly as John began to lean in. He was nearly there when Sherlock said, “Wait.”
Panic starting to rise within him, he shoves his covers off and hurries to Penny’s cot, situated in the corner of his bedroom. His heart leaps to his throat when he sees she isn’t there. Her favorite stuffed animal – a puppy – lies forgotten.
"Yeah, I got that, but you said you could solve your crimes without the cocaine.”
“Dinner is really good,” he said. “I’m impressed.”
Sherlock hummed and gently swirled his wine. “Either when Mycroft made himself sick on Christmas, or when I got to dress up as a pirate on Halloween.”
“I don’t know,” he responded truthfully. “We’ll just have to see.”
“Only because I had finally found her,” Sherlock answered. “It’s complicated, and I’ll tell you all of it, I promise. But I haven’t slept in days, and I would really like to now. And I should probably shower.”
“I don’t.”
John suddenly wished he hadn’t washed out his glass, but he was already feeling rather light-headed. He’d wanted to take the edge off of his suffocating emotions, and the whiskey had done the trick. But it also made his tongue looser than he would’ve liked.
For those who have stuck around and been patient, thank you SO MUCH! I'm so grateful for you guys. I promise I won't let things go this long again. And I promise this story won't be left unfinished.
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock said immediately. “Sherlock is fine.”
Sherlock’s heart broke a little. That was unacceptable. John deserved to hold his daughter as much as he wanted.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he dragged one corner of the fitted sheet over the mattress. John felt a bit guilty for doubting him, but it was true. He’d spent countless hours berating Sherlock for his laziness over the years, and he could recall multiple instances of him telling the genius to clean his dishes or pick up his books, only to discover a short while later that he’d done none of it.
They walked in silence for a few minutes. Far off, kids could be heard shouting as they played football, and up above birds chirped. Sherlock kicked a rock and watched it skidder down the path.
get in there and
John shook his head as he pulled out mugs for his and Sherlock’s tea. “You can’t just say she’s smart because she listens to you. If anything, that would make her the opposite of smart.”
“Because you’ve
he realized, his thoughts sounding foggy and distant.
With a sigh, John continued, “After you… jumped… I was a mess. Worse than before you met me, barely living.” Sherlock suddenly regretted what he said. It hurt to hear John say this. “Mary made things bearable. She made me feel more like a person. Like I could live for something. But the way she made me happy… it wasn’t the happiest I’ve ever been. I know how happy I can be, what absolute happiness feels like, and I didn’t have that with her.”
Rosie let loose a stream of garbled sounds that was probably an affirmative. After John confirmed Molly would be completely fine and that yes, she would call if she needed to, he stepped outside to help load everything into Molly’s car. Right before she followed him, Molly turned and looked at Sherlock.
“I mean,” she said finally, a bit hesitant. “You’ve already lived together. It can’t be that bad, can it?”
He brushed a stray blonde curl back behind her ear. “I’m afraid not. At least, not last night.”
Something flickered across Sherlock’s face. Relief? Happiness? It looked like one of those things. It made John smile, though he had a feeling it looked rather dopey. Everything about him was muddled.
he reminded himself as he got dressed the following morning.
A human that wasn’t Sherlock.
“No you don’t.”
"Because it’s the right thing to do. Because people
“Then I’m going with you.”
<3 Thanks to everyone who has stuck with this!! I love you all and appreciate you guys!!
Sherlock shook his head. “Rosie needs you.”
“Including sending him on a two-year mission around Eastern Europe where he was beaten within an inch of his life?” John knew he was being unfair, but he couldn’t help it. He was stressed. “Or sending him on another mission where he most definitely would have died? Or sending him on
"Alcohol,” he replied. “It’s gone on for two years now.”
Sherlock shifted in his chair and pulled his shirt back on. John could breathe easier when the scars were hidden from him. “Yes,” said Sherlock, focusing intently on his buttons. “Just like I suspect your shoulder haunts you.”
“Careful,” John says, his voice taking on a teasing lilt that will hopefully hide its shakiness. “If people hear you say that, they might think you’re her father.”
“I don’t –” Sherlock cleared his throat. “I don’t understand.”
“Please, Sherlock,” he whispered. “Tell me.”
“Shut up, I’m just –” Sherlock sagged a bit against the couch. “You really want that? With me?”
you, and she’s
John was easy to spot. He’d kicked his blankets off, and his face was turned upwards, so Sherlock could see him through the darkness. Stepping as lightly as he could, Sherlock moved to the side of John’s bed and knelt down.
“These things are classified –”
“Four days ago.”
"Hello?” he ventured. “Anyone home?”
This time, it was John’s phone that was ringing.
“Alright,” Lestrade said. “Tell me what’s going on.”
John realized that. Despite his incredible observational skills, Sherlock didn’t see what was right in front of him. It both astounded and frustrated John to no end. He never knew he was the cause of Sherlock’s heartbreak because he never knew the depth of Sherlock’s feelings for him, but now that he knew, he hated himself more than ever before. His therapist would tell him that was too much self-loathing for one person. He would just laugh and shrug, as if to say,
“We’re going for a walk,” clarified John. “Is that alright?”
“Oh my God, are you flirting now?”
There was no judgement in the question. Sherlock let his grip loosen.
one had to make. It was all hateful, and Sherlock wanted to be done with it. Facing John was a better choice than spending another moment there.
“You scared us half to death, Greg,” John said.
Sherlock flipped to the next page. “Something that you’ve been aware of for ages. How fascinating.”
Sherlock sucked in a breath. John waited, his eyes tracing every single scar that marred that perfect body.
John fell asleep with Sherlock stroking his hair, and when he woke up again several hours later, he couldn’t remember if it was a dream or not.
He couldn’t go on a case. He had to help take care of Rosie. He was a bit disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to get out and investigate, but not as much as he usually would be. There was something about spending the day with Rosie and John that almost seemed preferable to working.
“Why wouldn’t I be comfortable with it? I know we have stuff to work through, but this could be a good way to do it.”
like that anymore.”
Without thinking, he let his fingers stroke Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock inhaled sharply. John withdrew his hand immediately.
“Careful, this idiot is supplying you with food for three weeks.”
, but he couldn’t figure out how. It was the worst feeling in the world.
“Goodness,” Sherlock remarked as he picked her up and settled her against his hip. “And here I was, worried you wouldn’t recognize me.” He spoke flippantly, though there was a deep ache in his chest that he was worried might end up choking him. He kissed Rosie’s head and set about changing her nappy. Amazingly, Rosie didn’t fuss once, instead staring at him with her massive eyes while she grabbed her feet.
He was disappointed, yes, and more than a little heartbroken. By this point, he thought they would be past all the drama and hurt. His love for Sherlock, still so new, left him choked up. And under it all, there was still a sense of desperation that he had to finalize things between them
John shrugged, chewing his food thoughtfully. “Yeah, okay. If you want.” He looked at Sherlock. “Thank you.”
John make a choked sound and closed his eyes. He leaned forward and pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s.
Sherlock lifted John’s hand up to his mouth and kissed his palm. John’s eyes had gone wide, and when Sherlock’s lips made contact with his skin, he let out an “Oh” of his own.
Sherlock wiped Rosie’s mouth with a damp cloth. Silence had settled over the kitchen, but it wasn’t awkward or oppressive. It was the opposite, in fact. There was a certain level of domesticity they had achieved in the recent days, and it was, quite frankly, delightful. Domestic life had never appealed to Sherlock, but the past week was making him rethink it.
“Shhh…” Lestrade murmured, cradling Sherlock as he sobbed. “It’s alright. It’s okay. You’re okay. You’re okay, Sherlock.”
And he returned downstairs to carry on.
But when Rosie was born, all those fears went away. Well, most of them had. He still worried about his ability to be a good father, and he feared his strained relationship with Mary would impact things. But he didn’t want to run from it anymore. He wanted to give all he could to his daughter and be the best person he could be for her. It was easier said than done, as the recent months had proven, but he was trying. He liked to think he was getting better.
John swallowed and glanced toward the stairs. He could hear faint splashing and giggling. “Yeah, well, that’s actually the reason I’m calling.”
” John’s tone made Sherlock snap his mouth shut. “Her death was not your fault. I should not have blamed you for it. I was hurt and angry and guilty, and I needed a scapegoat. You were it, and that wasn’t fair.”
“You said that already.”
“Not tonight,” replied John, feigning nonchalance. Sherlock’s brows furrowed. “I just need to take care of something.”
<><><>
“I know,” Sherlock said, trying for some levity. It got John to give a small, wry smile. Then he looked back at the scars.
John’s brows furrowed a bit. He couldn’t help but feel like there was another reason behind his words, a reason bigger than him just feeling bad for taking Rosie without John’s permission. It was in the way he spoke.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock said quietly. “You were distraught. I probably deserved it.”
to. Depression and fatigue are two of the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal.”
“Really?”
“Go away,” a lumpy shape at the far end of the cabin said. “You have no right to bother me right now.”
Sherlock waited for more, and when John said nothing, he replied, “Yes.”
Sherlock’s brows furrowed. “Why?”
They clearly had a lot to work on.
“Look at her,” John said. “Do you really think we could wrangle her into her car seat? You couldn’t even get into the pushchair.”
“John,” Sherlock murmured. He tightened his left arm around Rosie so he could reach out with his right and smooth out John’s fist. “You are nothing like him.”
“Yep. She sought me out, and we started texting each other. I didn’t actually know she was related to him, though.”
“What do you think?” John held out the spoon. “You try. She listens to you.”
The spatula froze in Sherlock’s hand. He stared at the eggs, not comprehending that they were probably on the verge of burning. His whole body was tense.
“He’s fine,” John said quickly. “At least, I think so. I hope so. I need him to be. He promised he’d – oh, God…” Panic rose up in him as he confronted the fact that he had absolutely no clue where Sherlock was or if he was okay. He didn’t know a damn thing.
Sherlock tapped John’s wrist. “I’m coming back, aren’t I?”
Sherlock had requested to be put on the rotation schedule after John had woken up. On that day, after John had fallen asleep once more, Sherlock had left the hospital and gone straight to John’s house. For the first time in weeks, he got to see his goddaughter, who had somehow gotten even more perfect since the last time he had seen her. Molly had been reluctant to hand her over, but a pleading look from Sherlock had quenched her fears.
He stared into the depths of his coffee. It was the morning of the eleventh day Sherlock had been gone, and John was losing his mind. He’d known dealing with Eurus would take some time, but he didn’t think it would go on for this long. If Mycroft had already known where she was and what needed to be done to stop her, the mission should already be over. Sherlock should be home.
How could he have been so stupid?
John glanced over and saw Sherlock was looking down at Rosie with the fondest expression he had ever seen. It made his mouth go dry.
“It took a few hours,” Sherlock began as he unbuttoned his shirt, “but I eventually constructed a profile of the killer. All of the previous victims would frequent support groups, but never the same ones, which made it hard to find connections. The killer would attend a new support group each week and pick her prey.”
John paused to consider, then shrugged. “Honestly, that sounds fair. It feels more… serious now. More real.”
“No,” John snapped. “Don’t even try to justify this. You told me he was alive, but you don’t even know for sure, do you? How can you, if he hasn’t made contact in days?”
Sherlock blinked, then blinked again, his eyes fixed on the tiny flames atop the two white candlesticks. He was suddenly reminded of a night, many years ago, when they were just barely acquaintances. A night that would change their lives.
“You heard your father,” he said. “You’re going to be okay, Miss Rosamund. Isn’t that wonderful? You will make a full recovery. How could you not, with the best doctor in the world as your dad?”
“I am capable of going out and buying food myself.”
upset that Sherlock was wasting the very opportunity John so desperately wanted. Although upset didn’t seem like the right word. Angry. Angry was good.
Only he couldn’t. This was Sherlock’s area of expertise. Not to say John couldn’t usually come up with his own rescue plan, but he could hardly think past the crippling fear he felt for his daughter and the sadness he felt about Sherlock and the
His words had their intended effect, as John laughed. Sherlock smiled, feeling a lightness spread through him. John was happy with
“It’s more personal.”
He was beginning to wonder if inviting Sherlock to stay was a bad idea.
John waited for him to continue, and when he didn’t, he prompted him. “So…”
”Yes,” whispered Sherlock. John closed his eyes.
But now,
“You need to do the airplane,” Sherlock said, walking straight to the kettle. “She likes that.”
“I’m sorry,” he says roughly, looking at anything but the still-seated genius. “I just – I thought -”
John turned his head and looked him in the eye. He was grinning. “Not bloody likely.”
But things had been so
Sherlock had looked so…
~~~~~~
“I’m already holding her! That’s half the battle!”
“I got everything else I wanted,” she continued, never looking away from the doorway. “So he’s going to be here soon.”
He could practically hear Mycroft rolling his eyes. “By staying with the Watsons, you are putting them in danger. Now might be a good time to return to Baker Street.”
"You’re here for two reasons,” Sherlock said bluntly. “The first is you want to be a doctor when you grow up, so you figure this is a good place to start training. And of course, it’ll look good on uni applications, and considering where you grew up, you need all the help you can get. The second is a far more personal reason. You have a sibling here, a sister. She’s here because of you, because you looked into it and convinced your mother to send her here. Your mother followed your suggestion because you’re the only man in the house, your father having died a few years ago, and she doesn’t know how to handle your sister’s habit. You came to watch over her progress, though it must be annoying to not have direct access to her. Even if you did, I doubt she’d talk to you. She rather hates you right now.”
Rosie made her whining noise again. Sherlock wiped his hands on a dish towel and picked her up. She beamed, happy to be the center of someone’s attention again. He bobbed her up and down, and John had to look away.
He had been sincere when he told John he had nothing to be guilty for. Texts were harmless. He could have done something far worse, and then Sherlock didn’t know how he would’ve reacted. Thankfully, however, the affair had been kept within the confines of a tiny electronic device.
He wasn’t like Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly, and he opened his mouth to reply when he was cut off by a voice from the other side of the door.
And that was when John knew. He wasn’t falling for Sherlock.
“What? Why?”
“Yeah,” John murmured. “I think I just wanted you to know. No. I
He rarely slept, so it wasn’t a huge inconvenience, but it was still frustrating because he was actually
“Oh, I just thought we’d order takeout, or something.” He looked longingly toward the pile of takeout menus by the phone. Pad Thai sounded delightful.
“Yeah, alright,” John replied, a little delayed. He’d been watching Sherlock, getting caught up in the way he was so focused on his phone. So focused on planning the next day for the three of them. The constantly-thrumming happiness in his belly seemed to increase.
The past tense, while appropriate, hurt him. Sherlock looked away, turning back to their breakfast.
John is madly in love with him.
“That’s almost exactly what I said.”
John wasn’t sure if he was supposed to laugh or cry. Laugh because the idea of Sherlock cooking seemed ridiculous, cry because
“You think so?” he asked, his voice lightly teasing.
"There’s nothing to tell,” he said finally. He expected John to drop it, or maybe give a half-hearted insistence that Sherlock not be afraid to speak his mind. Instead, John laughed.
John was silent beside him. Sherlock almost wondered if he’d fallen asleep. Then John shifted, sitting up straighter, and Sherlock continued with his story.
The laughter that bubbled up in John was unfamiliar, but welcome. He couldn’t recall the last time he’d genuinely laughed.
John grasps Sherlock’s hand, both smeared with blood. “Of course I do. I’ve felt that way since the moment I met you, you madman.”
But the whole reason he was there circled back to why he had to leave. His deranged sister had resurfaced, harmed his best friend, and would likely harm everyone who stood between her and him. He couldn’t put John and Rosie at risk. He loved them too much for that.
“Were you and your sister close?” he finally asked. It wasn’t what he was most curious about, but it was a start. A way to ease John in.
Sherlock noticed it the minute he came downstairs with Rosie. Over the past two – approaching three – weeks, they had established a bit of a routine. They both usually woke up around the time Rosie would, though Sherlock sometimes was up earlier. John would go downstairs to get the coffee going, and Sherlock would go to Rosie and change her diaper (He’d gotten quite good at it, something he was begrudgingly proud of). It always made him smile to see a steaming mug waiting for him on the kitchen table when he and Rosie made it downstairs. Another domestic touch he would miss when his time at the Watson house was up.
“I’ll call him tomorrow,” he said hesitantly. Molly smiled encouragingly at him.
“Take Rosamund,” said Sherlock, rising from the couch in one fluid motion, “and go out the back door.”
“Help with…?”
Somehow, that made Lestrade angrier. “I never took you to be a homophobe.”
“I just wanted to say how beautiful your daughter is.” Her eyes twinkled sweetly, like her very words hadn’t just punched Sherlock in the stomach.
John leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs out as far as possible. He wished he could just melt into it and disappear from the world. It seemed easier than existing. “I can assure you it’s very, very possible. I’m not perfect, Molly. God knows he deserves to get angry with me, after everything I’ve done to him.”
he says it. ‘I’m a user, not an addict.’ He’s obnoxious!”
“That’s what I feel…” Sherlock says. “For you.”
It’s the second time Sherlock has been shot, and he decides he doesn’t really like the sensation. Not that it matters, he doubts he’ll experience it again.
“So do this now!” John taps Sherlock’s face. “Keep your eyes open, okay? Keep them open, love.”
Sherlock still did not look away, his face blank and cool. “It doesn’t matter what you wanted, because it didn’t happen. You didn’t cheat on Mary. You have no reason to be guilty.”
John shook his head. “It’s just, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you make your bed. Or do any housework, for that matter.”
A loud clattering noise had both men jumping. Rosie, apparently done with being ignored, had flung her sippy cup onto the ground. She kicked her little legs around, making a whining noise that meant she wanted to be held.
<><><>
John kicked the water, sending a cold spray up in the air. Sherlock flinched.
“Did you steal that from him?” he asked teasingly, tapping her nose. Rosie giggled.
Because of course he couldn’t just go to bed when Sherlock was out on a case, possibly getting himself injured or worse (John didn’t want to consider worse). Back in the old days, in those rare times when he didn’t accompany Sherlock on a case, he would have no qualms about going to bed if he had an early shift the next morning or if he was just exhausted. Now, though, he doubted he would’ve been able to sleep even if he tried to. His stomach was roiling with anxiety, and he kept checking his phone for any new texts or calls.
It took him a second too long to realize Sherlock was now looking at him too. With a click, he locked his phone and set it aside.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said. “We can talk more once you’ve rested.”
“Didn’t you hear me? I said I have an idea.”
“Slower?” Sherlock looks so timid and unsure, and John just wants to wrap him in his arms and kiss his fears away. “You’d be okay with that?”
Things weren’t awkward between them, Sherlock wouldn’t go that far. But whatever ease they had between them thanks to the cover of night was gone in the morning sunlight. It was like last night had been the dream, and now they were in reality. Their communication skills had certainly improved during the time Sherlock had stayed with John, but now, for a fleeting moment, he worried they were about to return to those early days when they still stumbled over their words and skirted around each other.
Sherlock dug the toe of his shoe into the ground. “It’s better than school.”
“What about me?” Sherlock kept his voice casual, but John saw the slight tension in his expression.
“Once I deduced all that, Lestrade sent out several officers to different groups around the city. He and I went to one for gambling addictions. It was tedious, but it was the right one. I worked out who it was within three minutes. She looked far too happy to be there, and her shoes and necklace were too nice for someone who allegedly lost all her money gambling.”
Sherlock thought.
As if Sherlock wanted to be anywhere else.
“She’s a smart girl,” said Sherlock, continuing to feed her. “I’ve always known it.”
Sherlock muttered something under his breath and stood up. He picked her sippy cup off the ground and set it on the counter before gathering his and John’s plates. His was mostly full, while John’s was nearly empty. The plates disappeared into the sink after being scraped off, and Sherlock turned the faucet on to begin washing them. John watched the whole time, the cold feeling in his chest nearly suffocating him.
“There’s something you’re not telling me,” Sherlock said. John swallowed harshly and tried to look casual.
“What about you?” Greg asked. “What’s your story?”
safe?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t used to talking about his feelings, but he had to admit he felt a bit lighter now that he had. Lestrade seemed appeased for the moment, and possibly even a little touched that Sherlock had deemed him worthy enough to open up to him. As if Sherlock would go to anyone else. Considering how he couldn’t really talk to John about it, Lestrade was his best option.
Sherlock sighed and adjusted his hold on her. “Bringing Daddy home is different than getting presents.”
“No no,” said Lestrade, rubbing his eyes. Sherlock deduced he hadn’t gotten more than three hours of sleep in two – no, three – days. “I need his help. I’m really sorry to be doing this with everything going on, but if the pattern holds, we’ll have another body by tomorrow morning.”
John believed he was the source of his happiness. It didn’t matter that John only thought of him as a friend; this was more than he could have ever hoped for.
“But I –”
he thought.
<><><>
“Past wounds tend to do that.” John bit his lip and touched Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock’s hands stilled on his buttons. “The key is not letting them define you.”
Sherlock’s lips parted, his eyes growing sad. John’s heart ached painfully at the realization that came with his words.
Lestrade laughed. “John, I’m pretty sure the only people who didn’t know were you and Sherlock. You’re both brilliant, but you’re incredibly thick when it comes to each other.”
“That’s none of your bloody business.”
he thought when Lestrade arrived at John’s designated time. He dropped his eyes back down to the book he had open in his lap, though he didn’t read a single word.
It took him another minute or so to find the right words and to pluck up the courage. Thankfully, Sherlock didn’t speak once, and John felt a gentle warmth in his stomach.
“Oh,” Sherlock said again. John smiled sadly.
“Oi.” John lightly thumped him on the back of his head, and Sherlock made an undignified noise in response. “I would never do that.”
He was nearly at the last bed – Sherlock’s bed – so he moved forward the last few steps to stand at the foot of it. Sherlock had drawn all the blankets around himself, despite it being sweltering outside. The only part of him that John could see was a riot of dark curls and a flash of white skin underneath it.
Though, he was a little afraid to see what would happen once they were no longer in the same household.
Molly had studied him for a moment before agreeing. Sherlock had been all too eager to return his attention to Rosie, who was smiling up at him like she was just as pleased as he was.
"Your hands are still shaking,” he said.
Sherlock felt his lips curve into a little smile. On the telly, the man was belting out a particularly powerful note, and distantly Sherlock could concede that he had a decent voice. Of course he was John’s favorite.
John had been trying to imagine a tiny Sherlock doing housework when he realized he didn’t know how to. Picturing Sherlock as a child seemed impossible. It had crossed his mind a few times, sure. One didn’t meet someone like him and not wonder how he came to be. His life was surely a psychologist’s dream case study. However, John could honestly say he didn’t know a thing about Sherlock’s childhood, and filling in the blanks himself was impossible.
He knew, of course he knew, but he had to confirm it. “Me?”
Their conversation was stopped by the reappearance of their waiter, poised to take their food orders. Sherlock rattled his off dutifully while knotting his napkin. Lestrade’s eyes were still on him.
Sherlock gripped John’s hand tightly, and John did the same.
“Whatever’s going on,” John said after what felt like an eternity, “don’t go.”
John stood up from his chair and started pacing the kitchen. Every time he passed, the fridge, he tried not to stare at the pinned note. He wished, not for the first time, that his right arm was stuck in the sling. He wanted to stretch.
“Thank you,” John said softly, his eyes flicking up to him before looking back at his daughter. Sherlock watched them for a moment, his heart stuttering, before quickly moving away. They deserved a moment to themselves.
“What’s going on?” Sherlock blurted out. John froze next to his chair and looked at Sherlock. He hadn’t meant to ask that question, but he felt like he was going mad.
Mycroft sighed. “You still don’t understand.”
And yet, it never rang. At least, not with the call he was waiting for.
Sherlock's withdrawals got worse the second week, but after several days of John sitting with him, he was able to muster enough strength to leave the cabin. After that, he got better with each passing day, though he still had what John had started calling “Danger Days,” when his symptoms where truly bad and his arm ached for the pressure of a needle.
Rosie beamed and continued through the last of her presents. There were a few children’s books, a new doll, a stuffed dog, and one of those machines that could project constellations on the ceiling. She reacted to each one with great enthusiasm, her smile brighter than any of the lights on the tree.
to make things better. He’d allowed himself to be filled with hope, only to be left with bitter disappointment.
Repeatedly.
Pleased with himself, John turned onto his left side and settled in to sleep. And if he dreamt of a certain curly-haired genius, it only made his night better.
"How long have you been a counselor here?” John asked.
“Well, now that we’ve gotten that out of the way,” said Sherlock, resolutely pushing on. “What comes next?”
The thought of talking to Sherlock about everything – and he was certain they would need to talk about
Sherlock gave him a tiny, but still genuine smile. “You didn’t hide.”
He had gotten used to sleeping alone again, finally, but he would be lying if he said he hadn’t been hoping that he would get a new sleeping partner that night. He had no expectations, no dreams of sex. He merely wanted to sleep beside Sherlock and relax in his warmth.
(See the end of the chapter for
~~~~~~
“What?” He looked up to see John staring at him in awe. At least, he thought it was awe. John’s eyes had widened ever so slightly, and his mouth had fallen open. Behind him, Molly was closing the door, smiling and carrying a bag of John’s things.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It’s not like we’re mates or anything. She mentioned you yesterday, said you’re the reason she’s here. And on the first day, she talked about your dad.”
It takes John several seconds to realize Sherlock has turned away, separating their lips. John tries to connect them once more, but Sherlock jerks his head back, sending a pang of fear and sadness through John. He lets his hands fall from Sherlock’s hair and pulls himself up from his lap.
John had an almost-affair. With his sister. The sister he’d forgotten he had. The sister who shot John, the only man Sherlock had ever loved. The man Sherlock loved, who had been so dissatisfied with his marriage that he sought a connection with a woman he barely knew. (The key word being
“She’s
you to know.”
Then the reality of the situation hit him completely, and he was bombarded with a million other questions.  They made his head spin. One seemed louder than all the rest.
John nodded, unable to stop the small smile that was spreading. “I do.” Sherlock’s answering smile was all he needed to know they were going to be okay, as long as they both put in a little work.
“Good?”
It’s never been their wedding before. That’s a new one. Most of the time it’s their first date, or first kiss. Once before he’s seen John proposing, but they’ve never gotten further than that. Sherlock supposes it’s a good thing it hasn’t happened before, because he doesn’t know if he could handle the sadness he’s feeling now if it was a recurring thing.
John made his way over and lowered himself down, wincing a bit as he jostled his shoulder. Sherlock walked over, pressing a quick kiss to Rosie’s head without thinking about it.
. And if you, for one second, think you’re like them, then you truly know nothing about yourself.”
John shook his head right away. “No, no, I’m not upset…” He desperately needed Sherlock to know it was okay, he wasn’t angry with him. He still cared about Sherlock with every fiber of his being. But the words wouldn’t come. He was still sluggish from the surgery, and his shoulder hurt an awful lot. He looked around in search of his morphine drip. Sherlock seemed to understand, for he reached over a turned it up a bit.
“You got her to nap?” Sherlock looked impressed. “Well done. We thought for sure she wouldn’t want one today.”
Like the volume had been turned back up, John could hear Rosie throwing a tantrum downstairs. A second later, Mrs. Hudson called their names. Their private moment was gone.
from up above. Rosie whimpered and pressed herself closer to him. John’s expression softened in concern, and he stretched his left hand out to rub her back.
John cleared up after they were done, and as he walked to the sink, he pecked both Rosie and Sherlock’s heads. There had been a slight hesitation in John’s step right before he did it for Sherlock, and Sherlock had to actively work not to drop his teacup.
John met Sherlock’s eyes, and Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat. There was a nervousness in John’s gaze, but there was a bit of hopefulness too that took Sherlock by surprise. John looked terrified, but certain.
Buying all the presents had been harder than Sherlock thought it would be. John managed to send him an extensive list of things to get for their daughter, and Sherlock did his very best to get everything. In the end, he only deduced seven people to tears in order to get what he wanted, and he managed to do it all with a week to spare. If his little girl couldn’t get the number one thing on her Christmas list, she was damn well going to get everything else.
“Listen, I’m not trying to tell you how to live your life. You don’t
Sherlock had grown more sensitive to the fragility of John’s mental state and made sure to make the doctor comfortable with himself. He helped John
“If it’s about bees-“
"Because I care" (He vowed against it). "And I think it's a bloody brilliant idea" Pushed forward chin. Fumbling with his dress buttons. John lied. He really didn’t think it was a brilliant idea. Sherlock could see it on the tip of his nose. Considering the idea involved a call to his brother, Sherlock didn't beg to differ. He needed to have a word or two with John regarding the decisions of bowl movements.
"You might be a professional but, let me ask you Doctor- he glanced down at the small name-tag on John's clipboard- "Watson. Do you have any children?"
Actually, he should have seen it coming (He was Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes didn't get surprised). He didn't (Now, what an inconvenience). He was extraordinarily stubborn and annoyingly shortsighted when it came to his own reaction to sentiment. But really, something like this had never happened before. The ludicrous feelings he occasionally had to acknowledge never, never interfered with The Work. He kept them well hidden under the surface, allowing himself to face them only in the quiet moments at 221B Baker Street. He couldn't take people seeing him this raw, this
“Well, I didn’t ask him to save me, did I?!” John stopped his lecture to look at the younger man in disbelieve. The detective, by the time sulking and looking away, thought himself victorious when he was met with silence. However, Sherlock realized his mistake the second he met his friend’s eyes. There was a momentary flicker of an emotion Sherlock couldn’t quite place, before the doctor narrowed them to thin slits. How much Sherlock would adore the display of sentiment on the canvas of John’s face, not knowing what it meant, alarmed him more than he’d liked. It alarmed him so much, that he forgot to sulk for a second. He watched his friend take some deep, shaky breaths – a method to regain his composure – before his blogger closed his eyes and turned away from him.

not to watch him fondly but fails. Years have gone by where Sherlock declared himself an untouchable sociopath and now he was throwing good-bye kisses at little baby girls, while letting said baby-girls tuck at his curls happily. (John thought he heard a “oh, so SHE gets to touch them,” muttered under a breath, but maybe he was just imagining things.)

Antoni’s face has grown ashen and the poor guy looks like he might faint any minute. Karamo takes a precarious step forward, just to make sure.
"I have to hang up now" John mumbled, while he combed his fingers through the wild nest of hair affectionately. "See you in a bit".
He closed his eyes, tried to stop breathing through his nose, but he found himself sucking in the smell greedily. The sound of his own elevated breathing was unpleasantly loud in his own ears, he silently hoped that John wouldn’t notice. He almost jumped when a warm hand touched his thigh. John noticed.
"Mental illness and psychopathy develops early" he noted, careful to keep his voice soft and professional; but the woman wept none the less when he addressed the elephant in the room. "You should have had her tested at the first signs of... abnormal behavior"

eavesdropping, especially when Sherlock was the culprit), but watched with growing interest none the less. How could John possibly be calling?
But he did not waste any time on self-pity (there was enough time to ponder about his error once John was fast asleep during the night), but inched closer to the huddled-over, shaken form.
“Really, Sherlock? Really? Fine. You were doing fucking fine…” He took a deep breath, willing his temper to calm down the slightest bit. Screaming at the younger man wouldn’t change a thing. John had the habit of getting loud rather quickly, Sherlock was used to this vocal outburst of tempter. John wanted to give him something he wasn’t ready for, something to get through his thick scull. When the blogger spoke again, his voice was quiet, but deadly. An involuntary shiver ripped through Sherlock’s body.
“I know” A pause. “He knows, too”
share. At the very least you’ll get a king-sized bed out of it, so everybody wins.”
The smell of cheap laundry detergent and tea cleared the fog over his senses enough to register that, indeed, John was there alive and well, and the scream indeed belonged to him. Only it wasn't a scream and more of a choked cry, muffled and raw with tears (When did he start crying? Sherlock Holmes didn't cry). Slowly, the blackness started to fade back into color, blurred edges once again became sharp corners and rooms, neatly organized mind-palace rooms. The white noise ceased more and more, until there was nothing but his own heartbeat in his ears.
When he passes Hair Guy- Jonathan, he reminds himself- the usually bubbly man glances at him thoughtfully. “There’s no shame in being whatever you are, darling. All that toxic heterosexuality will only make you unhappy.”
“Is that a yes, or…?” he asked timidly, just to make sure.
With all of the fussing over Rosie, they don’t notice him at first. When they do, it’s really Jonathan, and he almost squeals. Karamo notices the gleam in his friend’s eyes and know that now, Jonny’s a man on a mission.
“He was… look, I probably shouldn’t tell you that, but since you two seem so incredibly ignorant when it comes to talking about things which are actually important… we did all that we can…to stop him from…following you”
“You look scared, don’t be scared!” Karamo tries to soothe him.
The younger man stopped pulling due to John’s protests but didn’t let go of his sleeve. He gave John
“I have seen and tried my fair share of coping mechanisms, and you’re telling me you’re getting a crisis over your attachment to human affection? Right, John, the desire to sleep next to me, and hug me, and for me to make you happy is truly and utterly disgusting. For shame, John Watson, for shame!”
Everything about Sherlock in those moments was so careful and loving, that John wanted to cry. Nobody had ever cared for him like that. Most of the time, he didn’t think that he deserved this care that Sherlock lavished upon him. But it felt so
John stays silent because he doesn’t really know what to say. All of his life he had assumed (and other people assumed for him) that all he really needed in life was a happy marriage with a beautiful wife and fantastic kids.
“I-I’m…” the younger man swallowed, clearly struggling with whatever information he was about to share. John massaged circles around the small of Sherlock’s back and his hips, in what was he hoped was a soothing gesture. He couldn’t help noticing how smooth and warm Sherlock’s skin was right there, or how his fingertips left a wage of goosebumps.
“Everything’s fine, mate. We’re doing alright”
To celebrate the fact that
? Sherlock managed to work himself in a state of disbelieving shock, so much so that he didn’t even register the term of endearment.
Sherlock did stay up long after the rest of the Lestrade-Holmes-Watson family turned in for the night. He was eager to collect some rare plants he knew could best found in darkness, and John let him, with the promise that he would return before the sun was up again.
Sighing, he finally laid down, since he had to get up early in the morning. He swallowed the lump in his throat and gave Sherlock a small kiss against the sleep-warm lips.
But it’s late. And they’ve had more than enough emotional upheaval for the day. There’s no rush with these things. Especially since he has no idea what the hell they’re doing right now; what even
After another 20 minutes of successfully talking himself into the idea, John felt confident enough to bring his plans into action. What was the worst that could happen, after all?
To be honest, he just didn’t give it a title, because he
to Sherlock's presence, the adrenalin, their life in 221B Backer Street. When he first joined the army, he had had dreams. Delusional, romanticized dreams to do good in his life, devote his talents to a higher good. Safe the world, so to speak.
Mycroft was leaning comfortably against Greg, allowing himself to relax enough to give up his usual distance when it came to public displays of affection. This wasn’t public. This was family. He could be himself here, he could snuggle into his partner as much as he wanted, basking in the warmth and security of loving and being loved in return.
John smiled, and it felt like the first honest smile he had given Sherlock in the last three months.

, kitchen. The detective yelped, and grabbed his doctor’s shoulders to keep his balance, but couldn’t stop to join in his laughter as well.
Yet, he couldn’t stop it, he realized as he turned to his side and viewed the crumbled pillow where John had been lying hours prior with a sense of longing he couldn’t quite comprehend. What he wanted was… childish and…below his intellect but… still. He wanted it.
In the end, he said neither of those things. In the end, he suddenly understood.
And now Sherlock looks at him, with a small storm brewing in his eyes, but it’s not threatening- only wild and powerful, making them glow; almost radiant.

“Don’t play daft on me now, Sherlock” Lestrade, not very keen on having a domestic taken place over his worktable, urged, gently but persistently, for them to maybe take this home to discuss. Sherlock dismissed him with another one of those damn condescending waves.
And how beautiful it is to see John Watson without his walls as the proud, strong, amazing father that he is.
'Sherlock also never cuddles' his mind reminded him. 'Yet here we were'.
There’s some more cluttering and a low thud, before the door is pulled open to reveal a very disheveled looking John Watson. A John Watson, who very much wasn’t prepared for five random guys plus two cameras to be staring him in the face (he vaguely remembers Greg’s off-handed comment that he nominated him for a make-over show and he vaguely remembers reading and discussing the production’s letter with Sherlock). Still, he wasn’t prepared for them catching him thoroughly unprepared. He would have combed his hair had he known he would be filmed that morning. Or shaven. Or
John parted them after some seconds, only to smile and whisper hoarsely against the younger man’s lips: “Thank you. God, Sherlock, thank you so much” His voice broke at the last syllable, as a he laughed like he hadn’t laughed in months, while tears streamed down his face. In a surge of joy, he hugged the lanky detective against his chest tightly, covering his whole face with butterfly kisses.
” pass over his lips. An emotion he couldn’t quite place flashed in the taller man’s eyes before he drew John I again, to kiss him more forceful this time, as if he urged to pour all of his emotions into one single touch. Once they would be nestled together on the sofa, hours after the current moment, John would suddenly understand that his phrasing evoked the strong emotional reaction out of his partner. The last time Sherlock had heard them uttered out of John’s mouth, he was hiding in the shadows of a weeping willow while the doctor looked down at his gravestone. Ever since then, the verb “miss” was only placed in past tense, since there was no longer any need for this kind of sentiment. John didn’t need to miss Sherlock anymore, technically. Still, he couldn’t help but do, sometimes. Sherlock got easily lost between cases and experiments and being amazing; leaving John behind; soppy old John Watson to be nothing more than subtext, white noise in the background.
Talking with another parent about the struggles he faces settles John’s anxiety about the whole thing a tiny little bit. He had, time and time again, vowed himself to talk with Greg about it- because Greg isn’t only single-handedly the best father John knows, but also his best mate- but had never brought up the courage to do so. It’s easier when the other person doesn’t know the pre-parenthood you. Paradoxically, he feels like Greg knows him almost too well, that he can’t really open up to him about his insecurities.

before. It may take a while to break the shell of a Holmes, but the reward of getting a glimpse into their ‘human’ side was worth it.
Maybe he had been brooding over the wrong approach all the time. Evidently, he was the cause of John’s distress. But, instead of closing himself in and lamenting about changing the past, he should have made an effort to change the future. To actually
Carefully, he tried opening one sore eye and cherished the harsh evening sunlight that greeted his sensitive pupils. Tears embarrassingly streamed down his clenching face, but even Sherlock's ego suffered such a great shock that he momentarily forget to care about his pride. He hid his face in the crook of John's neck and inhaled deeply (wool jumper, old leather jacket, Earl Grey, Tesco soap, sweat, and

John Watson. His best friend. His …. Bow slipped at the sudden change of thought, distort the note. John laughed gently; and just like that the intense moment was gone. Sherlock cleared his throat, to overplay the lack of concentration.
Obviously overwhelmed with this amount of affection directed at him, Sherlock buried his face against the soft cotton fabric of John’s t-shirt. The doctor was achingly hard now, but he’d be dammed if he broke the intensity of this moment (he would sneak out later, when Sherlock was fast asleep, to have an intense wank over the fucking erotic display he was blessed to witness that night). There was plenty of time for exploration of this new, exciting aspect of their relationship. He was content to just hold Sherlock, for now. Everything about them was fragile, but intoxicating, so fucking beautiful.
Mycroft grumbled about being pushed around by deceiving partners but complied; leaning forward and giving his boyfriend a quick kiss against his stubble.
“’Lock”.
Not only has he showered, oh no, he also donned on the least hideous (Sherlock’s opinion) jumper he owns.
John wasn't stupid (against Sherlockian believe) he knew that Sherlock normally didn't do touch. But that he had been allowed to fulfill this scarce need of encouragement, of adoration – to bring warmth to the attention-starved parts of Sherlock's psyche- was bliss in itself.
John, bless his heart, interrupted the Sherlockian triad, skillfully trapping the detective’s animatedly waving hands in a firm, warm grasp.
"Sherlock?" John asked, while eyeing a especially cheeky curl on the detective's forehead. "You don't have to answer, but ... it is...it would be important that you're honest with me. Can you do that for me, Sherlock?" A small nod against his skin. John took a deep breath before he addressed the elephant in the room: "The crime scene trigged some memories, right? It was about

if he ever needed to say it out loud.
The flock moves from Rosie to Sherlock, a tumble of compliments and exclamations of excitement. Karamo tries to engage Sherlock in one of this patented “So tell me about your friend”- conversations, but Sherlock dodges it smoothly. Instead, he holds John’s gaze steadily and quirks his lips into the shadow of a smirk, which never fails to make John a teeny-tiny bit flustered (it’s just that he’s never seen Sherlock look at anyone else that way before. It’s something special and uniquely them. That shouldn’t make him flustered, though, but he can’t help himself). John pretends to be unaffected and feeds some more oatmeal to Rosie. Kitchen Guy is the only one not fussing over Sherlock and fixes him with a slightly surprised look that slowly morphs into a grin.
“I really don’t.”
"That was… amazing.”
“I don’t want to talk about this,” Sherlock said. “Yes, I know there’s nothing wrong with me, I know romance would change my life, blah blah blah. Thanks for coming, thanks for the birthday wishes, how very kind of you, do say hello to Rosie for me.” At the end of this, he walked over to the door and gestured out it. John could feel his anger pricking up again.
The genius stopped abruptly in the doorframe, suddenly sheepish and shy; with his cheeks flushed rosy from running and his hair mussed from running his hands through it in a jerky fashion. The doctor faced the door, but stayed in his sitting position, just eying his partner over for a long minute. Sherlock’s chest heaved heavily with effort, his whole frame radiating nervous energy. The silence stretched awkwardly, neither of them knowing where to begin or how.

to know?
Something so incredibly unlikely that he would have laughed at anyone who suggested it. Something… he had never admitted himself he longed for until the moment that it happened. The moment when Sherlock – mad genius, world’s only consulting detective, insufferable bastard, assistant-parent, John Watson’s Sherlock – brushed his lips softly against John’s.
He had to smile, despite the situation, for his heart clenched in the best kind of ways. He had never felt like this before. This connection. This selflessness. This utter devotion towards another human being. Gently, he cupped John’s wet and hot cheek, which caused his friend to finally look up. Despite their red, puffy, and slightly swollen state, the doctor’s eyes held a mosaic of emotions.
It was nothing either of them felt the need to discuss, it just sort of happened. At first, the detective just quietly slipped into John’s bed when he thought the doctor was fast asleep, to curl up behind him, sometimes fisting his hand in John’s shirt. They doctor pretended not to notice, pretended to be asleep (although he was 98% sure Sherlock knew that he was just faking it), pretended that his heart wasn’t beating in his throat every time they shared some casual touches.
When he found the inseparable pair, the sight before him made him forget about mopping for some seconds. The lake was gorgeous; rich blue water, as clear as a crystal, with a small beach-like area surrounding it. There was a small breeze there, that mingled the earthy smell of pine trees with the rich aroma of natural water.
“I’m sorry” came the wet reply against his skin, voice heavy with a strong emotion that made John’s pulse pick up speed. “I’m so sorry”
Not ever, and ever means ever since he had known this madman, had he heard him speak with such an amount of vulnerability and regret. John swallowed around the lump that suddenly formed in his throat. He couldn’t help but feel like this wasn’t only about the comment anymore.
) were immediately ingrained on his hard drive. He’d probably never get rid of the sight of John Watson-
“Hey John, did you know that the common wild bee-“
“You…what?”
He lost himself a little bit in the feeling, John would admit later, but after all; you don’t get to kiss the man you’ve been in love with for years all that often. So, it came as a small surprise when Sherlock pulled away slightly, to catch a much needed breath.
. Immediately, his brain provided countless definitions of the term, analyzing everything that it entailed; while something constantly screamed faintly in the background- out of panic, joy, or confusion, Sherlock himself wasn’t even sure (all three, most likely).
, to get everything back under
about John Watson- annoyed by his inability to put his emotions into words that weren’t sounding tremendously childish.
“Would you excuse us for a moment?” he asked, while he pushed Sherlock towards the small hallway leading to the toilets.
John allowed himself some moments to compose himself when he was alone in the kitchen. The unlikeliness of Sherlock's behavior worried him. Never in his wildest dreams had he ever thought that Sherlock Holmes would seek bodily comfort (Sherlock didn't do touch), from him of all people. He exhaled loudly when the kettle beeped and rubbed his temples. His phone made a small sound, indicating a message from Lestrade. John unlocked the device with one hand and filled two mugs with the other (turns out he COULD make tea onehanded, after all). The message consisted of two words, probably typed in a hurry between paperwork.
Luckily, he wasn’t left with much of a choice, because Sherlock tightened his strong grip around the doctor’s shoulders; in return drawing John even closer until the older man’s nose bumped against the soft folds of Sherlock’s collar. The softness of the obscenely expensive shirt and the smell of Sherlock’s 50-quid cologne against his throat reminded the doctor so much of the quiet afternoons they sometimes allowed themselves (when no case was on and no experiment required Sherlock’s undisturbed attention) that he actually felt himself relax a little bit. Sherlock was here, after all. Sherlock was here, with him, right now. There was no warranty that the detective wouldn’t be neglecting their relationship the next time Lestrade came calling with a case; but what did it matter now? ‘Live the moment, Watson.’ Nobody can promise forever. But Sherlock could promise tonight- would that be enough? John inhaled and exhaled slowly, relishing the moment so close to the very alive, very warm body of his partner. It would be enough. This… this would always be enough.
Rosie eyed him suspicious for a second, before – finally! – she gave into her need for comfort. John saw it as a tiny triumph when she shyly buried her face in his dark blue shirt and let out a quivering breath. At least she wasn’t pouting anymore. At least, she let him in. Soothing, he massaged her scalp in circles – a technique that worked wonders even when she had been just a little baby. They stayed like this a little while, until the quiet sobs, evidence of the mood the toddler had worked herself into, lessened. Just when John thought he might never get his answer and proceeded to feel helplessly empty and at the mercy of a god of chance he didn’t believe in, Rosie, indeed, used her words. Or, one word, to be precise. One word, uttered quietly, but uttered with tones of great despair and need.
John’s mind returned to the core of the problem – Sherlock’s absence – and felt another small pang of anger in his guts. So, he had said it wasn’t a problem that The Work was top priority. But his family, for fuck’s sake
The doctor's heart ached a little at the feeble, broken tone of Sherlock's request, but he kept a straight face. Instead, his system filled with protectiveness and affection.

Standing in the dark bedroom, he did
For a second or two the detective was shocked into a state of numbness. Never, not
When John finished brewing the detective's favorite blend, he entered the living room to find a very disorientated-looking Sherlock draped in his chair. He looked strangely out of place, all long limps in a dressing gown, and tousled hair, and wide eyes. He seemed startled by the soft sound of a mug colliding with the wooden surface of their table. It would take a piece of work to get Sherlock fully back to normal, John then realized. But he was up for the challenge, because he knew that Sherlock needed him to. The detective had lost control and his vulnerable side surfaced, so he needed someone to rely on; someone to help him figure this new situation out; someone like John.
“Don’t.“
John let out a quiet ‘uff’ sound that was mostly for show, before he closed his arms securely around his daughter. He blinked up at his partner drowsily, and snorted when he realized the condition the Holmes brothers were in.
Sure enough, the Holmes brother in question appeared in the doorway, billowing coat and all even if it was June, looking entirely too expensive to go on a camping trip. He also carried no bag, which was presumably just the snobbish high-class attitude that brought John in such a state of mild annoyance.
“You look ridiculous.”
was becoming impossible these days.
“It’s been a while, though, hasn’t it?” Kitchen Guy asks with a sympathetic puppy dog expression which makes him look like a sad supermodel.
There was something about him- something that made the usually stoic detective breathless and emotional, something that made him want to fall onto his knees and promise the world to this wonderful human being.
Sherlock’s brows furrowed. “I told you it is quite alright, didn’t I?”
?! The detective had straightened his back again, looking as smug as ever, as if he didn’t just change the rules of the whole fucking universe. Rosie, oblivious to the wonder she had just witnessed, babbled a hurried “Bye Daddy”, eager to get back to her legos, and wriggled out of Sherlock’s hold, ready to start the second princess castle of the day. “I’ll be there in a sec”, the detective whispered into her curls before he put her down and she was off to the livingroom.
When the DI returned with two steaming mugs of terrible coffee, Sherlock abandoned his position on the couch and the case files in favour of pacing the room in long strides; muttering to himself while absent-mindedly rubbing the sleeve of his left arm (old habits die hard, Greg supposed). He looked frantic, panicked even, and Greg just knew an outbreak was inevitable.
There. Out in the open. Exposed.
John is happy for the momentary distraction from his gloomy thoughts and spends the rest of the drive telling Tan about some of the funny stories that have happened to him and Sherlock (and Rosie) over the years. He feels at ease around the other man, a feeling that doesn’t come easy to him.
“As soon as I can, love” John felt a tiny bit daring, throwing around endearments ten minutes into this new relationship, but the smile that lid up his best friend’s whole face at the praise was definitely worth it. John couldn’t help himself, he placed another kiss on this cupid bow, first appointment be damned, before he dashed out of the door. When he had jogged down the flight of 17 stairs, he hesitated at the front door, and turned around one last time.
“So, Sherlock,” Antoni casually starts, and John almost drops his cup. He hurriedly tries to overplay his sudden flustered state (Antoni’s not buying the bullshit he’s selling, though) while wondering if Antoni somehow is a mind-reader, too.
“Excuse me?” Sherlock waved with his hand, but he felt his focus shift away from the case to matters of to heart, and to his argument with John.
In the mornings he would chide himself for thinking this coldly about his Sherlock, especially when he was greeted with a small peck on the lips, or a quick side-hug. But still. John always had been doubtful in nature; and the past events only enforced him in his believe that it wasn’t wise to wear your heart on your sleeve. It could easily be broken like this. Sherlock broke his heart, once. The stiches he applied afterwards were still too fresh, the wound was still healing. John just didn’t want to take any risks, that’s all.
The world was going insane. And he was going to a wedding. With John. Like,
“I don’t like it when you downgrade yourself like that, John. It’s awfully mundane and stupid. We both know you’re above that.”
During their first year of sharing a flat, Sherlock acquired a vast knowledge about how to behave around people suffering from PTSD: No quick movements. Always stay in eyesight. Physical contact can trigger a panic attack.
I'm sorry that this took forever!!!!
“I’m sure Sherlock will love it, too,” Tan remarks with an air of pretense nonchalance, when they’re back in the car. He doesn’t miss the slight flush John quickly tries to hide under his collar and smirks to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
And John didn’t. Or did he? Sherlock shook his head, confused. His thoughts kept getting in disorder, due to the pounding of his own heart in his ears and the constant nagging in the back of his mind, and a nauseating sickness that had gripped his stomach. What if John wanted to
“You’re nothing like him,” Sherlock said, feeling the need to repeat what he said before. “He was full of hate and anger, and you have nothing but good inside of you. Your daughter won’t grow up to fear you. She’ll love you with her whole heart. You have to know that.”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twists up. “Except for that.”
Sherlock chose not to say it aloud.
Mycroft met his eyes. John wasn’t expecting a response, and he didn’t get one. Figuring their meeting was over, he stood and picked up Rosie. He tucked her back into her carrier and headed for the door.
John watched Sherlock take in the room. He didn’t have many decorations, and Mary had been the one who outfitted it. He wasn’t sure what Sherlock would think of it, but Sherlock merely gave a little nod. It was clear he was still nervous.
Pulling his coat tighter around him, he walked over to the door, where Molly was still waiting. He was nearly there when he thought of something to say.
Sherlock didn’t want to admit that Lestrade was probably definitely right. “Doesn’t matter. We’ve got something on today.”
John frowned and walked closer to him. Sherlock watched him wearily, the note still clutched in his fist. That, plus the tense set of his jaw, made John ache to touch him in some way, but he couldn’t even if he was allowed.
“Why? You won’t need me,” Sherlock said, his brows furrowing just slightly. John wanted to smooth them out. He wanted to tell Sherlock that
They would find their way back to each other in the end.
John’s face softened at that, and he laid a hand on Sherlock’s arm. Lestrade coughed and averted his gaze. “That’s sweet of you, really, but I’ll be okay. My shoulder doesn’t hurt all that much anymore, so I can manage Rosie. And if I need help, I’ll call Molly.” He squeezed Sherlock’s arm gently. “You’re needed elsewhere today.”
Sherlock’s panic spiked. “Why wouldn’t she be breathing okay?”
Sherlock glared at him for a full thirty seconds before he looked away with an overdramatic groan. “You’re infuriating. Truly.”
“What would Sherlock say about this, hm?” he asked. Rosie didn’t look at him. He sighed. “Good, yeah. Great.”
and not have some kind of story behind it. How’d your parents even come up with that anyway? I’ve never heard it before.”
“No,” Sherlock said. “Not now. It can wait.”
“Just trust me,” said Lestrade.
he thought.
“That’s – That’s actually not a terrible idea,” John said. Now it was Sherlock’s turn to appear surprised.
John’s brows furrowed ever so slightly. “That’s not necessary.”
John raised his eyebrows. “You can’t seriously tell me you’d rather stay here all day than go solve these murders. The world may be ending if you do.”
“It’s okay,” John said, shifting Rosie in his arm. “I figured she was with you.” He left out the part where he’d had a massive panic beforehand. Sherlock didn’t need the guilt.
John looked at him, and his eyes lit up with his smile.
“Right,” John said, uncomfortable. “You’re right. It’s a terrible thing to happen to someone.”
“Well,” said John. “That’s a dead end.” Rosie ran for the stairs just then, and Sherlock jumped up to grab her before she could start climbing them. John pinched the bridge of his nose.
“You can’t honestly tell me you don’t have stories to tell. For one thing, everyone at this camp has a story, whether they want to admit it or not.” John looked at him fully, grinning. “And you can’t have a name like
“Don’t repeat things I know you’ve heard, you know I dislike that.”
It was almost as though – dare he think it – John
“What’s wrong, Rosamund?” he murmured, stroking her back. “You haven’t woken like this in over a week.”
Sherlock pulled his knees up to his chest, a defensive position if there ever was one. “Of course I cared. I just learned to cope with it.”
couldn’t be kept out of his voice. John glanced at him and gave a curt nod. Molly tugged on his sleeve, and he finally allowed himself to leave.
Sherlock looked down at his mug. His lower lip jutted out just a little. “I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.”
“Has there ever been anyone you’ve loved?”
“I’m sorry,” he said.
These are dangerous thoughts though. He can dream in this moment that he and Sherlock are together, that Sherlock is Penny’s father too, and that when Sherlock puts her back to bed, he and John will retire to the same bed in the same room. But that’s not what will happen, and any dream John concocts that suggests it would is false and will only hurt him in the end.
That way, if Sherlock ended up talking again in the middle of the night, he’d hear it.
“Things are going… well,” Sherlock admitted. “We’re doing much better.”
He wondered if that would have been less painful. At least he would know Sherlock was safe.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It doesn’t matter what I’d rather be doing. I came here to help you, and that is what I am going to do.” Though he hadn’t been on a proper case in ages, and he was desperate to go on this one, even if he wouldn’t have his faithful partner by his side.
“Sherlock?” John prompted when a solid minute went by. “Did you hear me?”
(It was a day that was approaching faster than he wanted it too. That was another thing he didn’t want to dwell upon.)
This was new territory for him. He didn’t know the first thing about being a camp counselor, and he especially didn’t know how to deal with wayward teenagers. It scared him more than he cared to admit, though he already had a small idea of what to expect after living with Harry. He was prepared to endure vicious insults and stubborn demeanors, but he didn’t know how to properly address them.
The days continued to pass by until only twelve hours remained. At eleven o’clock the following morning, Mycroft would pick Sherlock up and bring him back home. He’d ask lots dull questions about Sherlock’s time away while deducing whether or not Sherlock had been fixed. They would arrive at the family home in Sussex, and Sherlock would be reintroduced to the monotony of his life.
use them as a way to get me to do your bidding. That’s low, even for you.”
This was all a terrible idea. He had hoped that having Sherlock so close would help them repair their friendship, but at that moment it was doing the exact opposite. They had been doing so well before John started to pry into Sherlock’s life and chose to reveal one of his own dark secrets that actually only ended up breaking Sherlock’s heart more.
“You’re so warm,” he said. “Like you’ve got a fever.”
“Oh?” John quirked an eyebrow. “And why’s that?”
Sherlock didn’t touch his cold tea, and Lestrade made him another cup. The little gesture touched Sherlock and prompted him open his mouth.
“I’m just saying,” he said, his words lame even to himself.
Lestrade seemed pleased he’d gotten John to accept it. John would need to take him out for a pint or twenty once this was all finished. “Just sit and talk with him. That’s what he needs most right now, and I’m pretty sure it’s what you need too.”
he thought.
John thought, his stomach clenching at the thought.
Now John looked around at the place where he once lived, the first place in his whole life where he had truly felt content. Remembered the lazy nights in front of the telly, the early mornings making tea, the days where he’d come home to find Sherlock in the middle of an experiment, or playing the violin, or lying on the couch, his curls all mussed and his long fingers pressed against his lips…
<><><>
“Yes.”
The thought made him unbearably sad, so he pushed it down. With a kiss to her cheek, he turned her back around so she was facing Sherlock.
“This feels like we’re making a pact, or something,” said John, attempting to lighten the mood. It worked, for Sherlock’s lips quirked up.
“You need a change, don’t you?”
He could hear Rosie babbling behind him, eager to get out too. Turning, he saw Sherlock had guided the pushchair to the side of the walkway and was in the middle of picking her up. She gazed at Sherlock with such adoration that John had to look away, his throat tight.
“What do you mean?” he asked, even though he knew perfectly well what Sherlock was talking about. This wasn’t a conversation he wanted to have, but he couldn’t avoid it now.
“What’s the matter?” he murmured, rocking back and forth with her. “Did you have a bad dream?”
“Sorry,” John said. “I don’t like to assume things about people. It’s not fair to them. I hate it when people do it to me.”
“Tea?” asked John, still looking at Sherlock. A moment later, he seemed to remember he had another guest and looked to Molly.
“Sherlock –” John shoved himself up, scowling at how difficult it was to do with one hand and bad knees. “I’m not leaving you alone.”
“Daddy didn’t come home?”
Sherlock shook his head as if to physically erase the thoughts from his mind and focused again on his reflection. Same weird eyes, same alien face. At least the facial hair was gone.
“Your sister is one of the campers, right?” Greg Lestrade asked him as they unpacked their things in the counselors’ cabin. John stilled in the process of putting his sheets on his bed.
he had said. He’d said it many times. It technically wasn’t a lie, as he did fancy women. But he knew the implication those words had, and he hid behind it for years. He let Sherlock believe he was straight, and he couldn’t help but think that if he had only told Sherlock the truth all those years ago, they could have avoided a great deal of pain.
“You don’t have to talk about it,” Sherlock said, a bit reluctant. John looked at him, and he seemed almost surprised. He set his jaw and shook his head. He leaned forward and set his tea on the coffee table.
“She’s a good godmother.” John’s brow furrowed, and he studied Sherlock. “You came as soon as you heard?”
“No, it’s fine,” he said. “Thank you for getting it all.”
“Wait.” Sherlock’s voice stops him when he’s in the doorway. John rolls his shoulders back and turns around. Sherlock is standing now, his fingers twisting together as he tries to piece together a sentence. John waits, resisting the urge to flee upstairs.
But. Plans.
John didn’t know what to do with himself. He had already folded the laundry and put it away. Dinner would need to be prepared soon, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to get up from the couch just yet.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw John’s hand drift towards his. Without hesitating, he reached over and met John halfway. Their hands linked together and rested on the dock between them. John’s thumb stroked Sherlock’s knuckles.
“Knowing you,” Sherlock says, “has been the greatest part of my life.
“No,” Sherlock replies. “She was an angel, as usual.”
“You really do have the worst self-esteem, don’t you?” He skillfully navigated the pushchair around someone’s trash bins. “I thought we discussed this the other day. You’re not a bad person, John, and you’re certainly not a bad father.”
John felt a flicker of disappointment. He probably shouldn’t have expected anything different. Sherlock had been away for a while and probably wanted to rest by himself. And as far as John knew, Sherlock had never been intimate with a person to the point of sharing a bed. Perhaps he was uncomfortable. It was nothing against John.
Well, the plan succeeded.
“I…I’m sorry I hurt you... I’m so sorry…I..I…” John kissed the crown of the younger man’s head, suddenly getting what the whole turmoil seemed to be about. He took a shaking breath
me’), but the outburst of temper usually didn’t last long enough to ruin his mood for the rest of the day. It was true, John was mostly contend with his life. He had a job he liked, a daughter whom he loved, and a partner who made him ridiculously happy; what could possibly make him upset enough to have a bad day?
“Because I love you”
And presumptuous.
“Culturally constructed niceties; useless acts of sentiment,
“Sherlock, I’m sorry about the whole ‘I’m not gay’-thing. There’s…. I haven’ been very honest to myself about that. Or to you-“
(See the end of the chapter for
He hadn’t thought much about it, to be honest.
Sherlock stopped firing deductions at an instance as soon as he noticed his little family standing sheepishly by the door. Honestly, John almost felt a tiny bit stupid. Missing his other half enough to wander in the middle of a crime scene he knew nothing about and where he was no help at all. Sentiment. Sentiment always made a fool of him. With a graceful turn, Sherlock faced John with a small twinkle in his eyes (John gave a small smile in return), and focused his attention instantly on the little girl by the doctor’s side. His demeanour changed at an instant; the superior air around him disappearing in favour of the bright smile he had solely reserved for Rosie. A reliving rush of belonging warmed John’s insides. It was almost enough to forget his insecurities. Almost.
Ps: Please leave a comment and kudos; let me know how you enjoy this story so far. I already have a pretty straight plan where I want to go with it; and I'm happy for every single one who's joining on the way.
When John paused in between stories, to take a sip of tea out of the flask Greg had prepared ours ago, Sherlock didn’t waste a second and pressed their lips together. It was short, but heartfelt and conveyed enough emotion to make the doctor a little bit breathless.
Sensing his decision, Sherlock tightened his embrace for a tiny second and then let go altogether. Before John had time to mourn the loss of Sherlock against his skin, the detective met him with another soft kiss on the lips. “Come home soon” his new lover (?), partner (?), soulmate (?), all of the above (?) mumbled very low and John’s heart swelled so much that he feared it would break the expanse of his ribcage (Not literarily, of course. He had a medical degree for a reason, thank you very much. But John Watson tends to be poetic when flooded with endorphins). The doctor rested his forehead against the detective’s for a small second, breathed a tiny laugh about this fucking glorious turn of events, and tangled a shaky hand in a nest of mahagony curls.
“Ha ha. Very funny.”
“I don’t know, because you’ve got a goddaughter?” With any other tone, John’s words might have been disapproving or harsh, but he was teasing instead. “It’s okay. It’ll most likely go away in a few days. Until then, we just have to keep her hydrated and make sure she can breathe okay.”
Tomorrow they would be going their separate ways. The next time they’d see each other would be uncertain. But at that moment, under the moon and the stars, it didn’t matter.
“Okay, now you’ve got to tell me something about you,” John said. “You know too much about me.”
Lestrade’s next words knocked the breath from his lungs. “Because neither of you can live without the other.”
Sherlock felt his cheeks grow hot. “You think I’m special?”
Sherlock frowned, his eyebrows furrowing. “Why is that hard to believe?”
“I’m so sorry,” Sherlock said, feeling like he should say
John clenched his jaw. “I don’t hate him.”
For one second, John had let himself hope that Sherlock would say those famous three words. It almost seemed like he would, and John would finally be allowed to let go and reveal all. But he didn’t, and John had to continue to keep everything inside.
he felt that Sherlock was
for Irene Adler. She is the last person I would ever be interested in.”
Two days had passed since John went to Mycroft’s office.
The sound of his ringing mobile pulled him from his self-deprecating thoughts. Pulling it from the pocket of his sweatpants, he answered the call without checking to see who it was. Thankfully, it wasn’t the person he was dreading speaking to.
“It’s not really –”
There was a slight temptation creeping up on him. He still had some bottles of liquor tucked away in the cabinets downstairs. He could pour himself a glass or two. They might make sleeping easier, which really was all he wanted.
He moved around the chair and knelt before her. His thumb caught the first tear to slip out, and Rosie’s chin wobbled as she tried to hold the rest in. He deftly took the photo album from her and set it aside.
“Don’t try to speak,” John orders. “Just focus on staying alive.”
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest. “Try to.”
“You better drink that,” Lestrade said. “John instructed me to make sure you eat and drink something.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tightening his arms around her, Sherlock proceeded to lecture Rosie on the cause of thunder. When he finished that, he moved onto lightning. The sky still lit up and the house still shook, but as he spoke, Rosie appeared to be less concerned with what was happening outside and more enthralled by what Sherlock was saying. Her blue eyes were fixated on him, her mouth hanging open slightly. Sherlock began to find it harder to speak, because his throat was getting tight.
“You do,” he insisted. He sounded delirious, but he didn’t care. Sherlock needed to know. “She shot me. Your sister.”
Lestrade cocked an eyebrow. “Then why don’t you help me?”
It was the exact opposite of a relief.
John looked like a mixture of amused and ashamed. “I’ve lived with you before. I’d just be living with you again. Nothing’s changed.”
He expected John to become frantic with concern, just like he was, but instead John just joined him in the middle of the room and examined his daughter. He put his left hand to her forehead, much like Sherlock had, and hummed.
“I just thought that perhaps – if you wanted – since I’m here to help out – I could make dinner.”
But he had, and everything felt right with the world. Better than just right, really. Everything felt absolutely perfect.
“I want to thank you for everything you’ve done by making you dinner,” he said. “And it’ll just be easier for you if you don’t have to travel back to Baker Street.”
“How would you know?” John rubbed his forehead. “You’ve never been involved with children before her.” He tried to hand Rosie her dog back, and she batted it away with a shriek. Sherlock winced.
Sherlock pressed his lips together and set his mug down. He slid off the couch and waded through the wrapping paper graveyard to get to his daughter. Scooping her up in his arms, he settled her on his lap and cradled her to his chest.
If he stood there for another two minutes watching her, he would never tell.
Again, he should have known this. It was the only logical solution. And yet, despite Sherlock’s strong belief in all things logical, he hated the idea and wanted another one. His heart ached at the mere thought.
His stomach swoops. “What if I want it to change?”
“And how long does it usually take him to get to the next place?”
“Together,” Sherlock affirmed.
“Yes.”
Frowning, Sherlock adjusted her so he could see her face. Her cheeks were flushed with an unnatural color. He lifted a hand to her forehead, not realizing it had begun to shake ever so slightly.
echoes through the streets, and the smoke clears, there’s only one person on the ground. It’s not John.
He barely had time to prepare himself for the tiny body launching itself out of the chair, but he managed to catch her before she fell to the ground. She cried against his shoulder, and he rubbed her back as he shushed her.
Rosie frowned, confused. “Maybe? But there aren’t any more presents to open.”
Rosie made one of her babbling noises and kicked his leg. With slightly shaking hands, John pulled her out of the carrier and set her on the floor so she could crawl around. He needed the brief distraction, and the faint look of displeasure on Mycroft’s face made it worth it.
*gasps* Could it really be another chapter? Finally?
That nearly rendered Sherlock speechless, as simple and – quite frankly – ridiculous as it was. “That’s hardly true,” he managed. “There’s – Mrs. Hudson.”
Little did he know, John had woken up from the same dream.
“We didn’t have much money,” John was saying, “which is why I ended up in the army. My mum was proud of me for enlisting. She died during my first tour.”
“Look, Sherlock,” he said. “You know you’re not broken-”
“I can’t,” replied Sherlock. He pulled plates down from the cabinets. John stood up from the table and joined him, indicating he could portion the eggs while Sherlock was on the phone. Sherlock nodded gratefully and held the pan steady for him.
“No one deserves happiness more than you guys.” John smiled at that. “After all you’ve been through, you two need some rest.”
he decided, excitement bubbling in his stomach as he got ready for bed.
Sherlock could read the hidden meaning behind John’s words, and he carefully turned his attention back to the eggs.
His hands shook as he tried to take a sip of tea, but he was unable to keep the cup perfectly still and ended up with a line of brown liquid falling down his chin. He wiped it away, scowling a bit at the feeling of his growing beard. He hated facial hair. It made him feel unkempt. Yet, he was unable to do anything about it for the exact same reason he’d just spilled his tea.
It was like the world around them had slowed to a stop. Even out in the suburbs, where John lived, there was always some kind of noise that would remind them that other people existed. In that moment, however, it was like they were the only two people in the world. Just as Sherlock had always wanted it to be.
“But see, if you eat breakfast now, you get a snack later. And you love snacks, don’t you?”
“So,” Greg said, “you use cocaine to solve crimes.” A few people snickered. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John’s expression was an odd mixture of shocked and – dare Sherlock think it – amazed. His mouth had fallen open ever so slightly, and Sherlock endeavored not to look at it so much.
“We have so much to talk about,” John said.
There was something achingly domestic about this whole exchange that had Sherlock feeling wistful. The look on John’s face suggested he was thinking the same thing. He let his hand fall from Sherlock’s arm and stepped back.
In the near-darkness, he could’ve sworn he saw a sliver of pale skin as a head turned in his direction. “Doesn’t matter. I don’t want to talk to you or Greg or anyone. I’m completely fine, and I don’t need anybody’s help. So you might as well leave and find another poor sod to save.”
He said it lightly, like it didn’t even bother him. Sherlock softened. “Well, we match there.”
Sherlock’s dream resurfaces, and his throat feels too tight. He falls back against the couch pillow and presses the heels of his hands to his eyes.
He tries (unsuccessfully) to put it from his mind as he gets ready for the day. If it were anything else, he is certain he wouldn’t have any difficulties doing so. But all he can think about when he gets dressed is how John looked in his tux. When he eats a paltry breakfast, he wonders what they would’ve served at their reception. Would they have had a reception? It doesn’t matter, because it isn’t real.
A common misconception was that Sherlock hated everyone. That wasn’t true. While he had plenty of people he did hate, what he felt for most of humanity was simply apathy. If they didn’t irritate or offend him, he didn’t care.
“I had no idea where you were,” John said, keeping his voice soft. It felt wrong to speak any louder. “Mycroft said you were late in checking in –”
“It’s not important.”
Thoughts of the previous night flashed in his mind. Sherlock jabbed the eggs with his spatula. “I’d say so.”
“You weren’t ready,” said Sherlock. It surprised him just then to realize that, despite how wretched he had felt after his feelings for John were dragged out into the open, he’d made peace with how it happened. Sure, he would have liked to tell John under far better circumstances, but somehow, it had led them to where they were now.
“Thank you,” John said. Then he left the room and pulled out his cell phone. He needed some assistance.
“Let me just change,” Sherlock said, and headed upstairs to get dressed. When he was halfway up the stairs, he heard Lestrade say, “I’ll look after him.”
“He’d be here if he could,” Lestrade said, clearly trying to be helpful. Sherlock gripped his teacup harder. “You know he would.”
“I’m honored, then.” John’s voice was low, and he wondered why he couldn’t get himself to speak louder. “Truly. It means a lot to me that you’d tell me.”
“It’s alright. There’s so much I can’t do right now with her, so I’ll take what I can get.” He held up Rosie’s spoon and waited for her to open her mouth. She did, and John grinned as he fed her. “That’s my girl.”
“Oh, Christ,” was John’s reply.
“Go on.”
John stared at him, his eyes narrowing slightly as if he was assessing Sherlock. “You do,” he said after a moment. “You really do. It’s almost like –”
“It wasn’t difficult,” he said. “Anyone could’ve worked it out.”
“My mother was a strong believer in giving us our own chores.” Sherlock walked around the bed as he spoke so he could pull the fitted sheet to the other side. “She said it gave us responsibility. And character.”
“No, there isn’t.” He heard the rustle of papers, indicating John had turned another page.
Sherlock looked up, surprised. “What?”
John felt a little ache in his chest. He knew the adult Sherlock faced critics and bullies frequently, but he hadn’t really considered the same for the kid Sherlock. It would make sense, especially with his personality.
Sherlock felt his hatred for John’s father spike.
Hope.
” he spat, feeling sobs bubbling up. “You were
“We are,” John allowed. “But there are some things that define you that can’t just be erased. I’d say this is one of those things.”
“Uh,” John said. “You know how to cook?”
There’s a crack in Sherlock’s perfect mask. His eyes flicker, looking downward. It makes John’s heartbeat speed up.
“Talk to who?”
“But it’s bothering you.”
He turned back to Rosie then, and Sherlock saw that is his cue to leave. “Of course. If you… need anything, don’t be afraid to call.” The silent
“Okay,” Sherlock said, scrolling through the list he’d hastily typed up on his phone. “Next we need milk, tea, and bread. And possibly some kind of vegetables.” He looked down at Rosie. “Does your father like vegetables? And if so, what kind?”
He was facing straight ahead, but he still saw John give him a sidelong glance. “Your hands are still a bit shaky.”
“I’ve got plans.” This earned him a raised eyebrow from John, which he ignored.
Sherlock finally lifted his eyes from Rosie to John. They were unreadable, which frustrated John.
Sherlock still seemed uncertain, but his shoulders drooped ever so slightly. John gave him a little smile, hoping he would calm down even further. When he didn’t, John prepared to say something else, but once again, Sherlock beat him to it.
But he was tired. So very tired.
The kitchen table was set, two plates on either side with the still steaming shepherd’s pie at the center. Next to each plate was a glass of red wine. Sherlock already knew it would compliment the food perfectly.
“We made contact with her,” said Mycroft. “She will only speak to you.”
After all the tossing and turning of the previous night, he decided to keep things to himself and wait to see if anything changed. He wasn’t going to rush into this and mess it up. Sherlock was too important to him for that.
Wait,” John said slowly, feeling hopelessly lost and not liking it. “So he’s not in your group anymore?”
Sherlock huffed out a breath. “I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry I wasn’t more careful and I’m sorry I worried you.”
“Well,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms and leaning back against the counter. “That’s roughly the age I was when I had my last friend, so perhaps my ideas of friendship are a bit outdated.”
with me. Right before he left, I divulged some very private information, and in return he left without talking to me about it and asked you to come today in his stead because he cannot bear to face me.” He hated that his voice cracked ever so slightly on the last few words, and he knew Lestrade caught it too from the way his lips parted.
Sherlock huffed and adjusted his hold on Rosie. There was another deafening
“My what?”
Sherlock exhaled harshly and looked away. The sky was overcast, which made sense because he felt like the sun was in his chest instead.
“Christ,” he whispered aloud, rubbing his face. The past was supposed to stay in the past, as he and Sherlock promised, but that didn’t mean he did a good job of keeping it there.
“Yeah, okay, you prat,” he said.
“I mean, yes, it was, but – mentally, I wasn’t here. Not always." He tore his gaze away from Sherlock and looked down at Rosie, still gnawing on Sherlock’s precious scarf. Sherlock took a step back. “I was a terrible husband, and a terrible father. I didn’t deserve them. I still don’t.”
John looked startled for a second, then sad. “These weren’t the circumstances I had in mind. But –”
room – having just gotten dressed. The steady good mood he’d been in for several days had evaporated at the sight of his older brother’s name on his phone, and it only got worse as the conversation continued.
“It’s alright,” John rasped as he wiped his eyes. “I just – I love you so bloody much.”
The next thing to cross his mind was how late it was. His mobile told him it was 8:34 AM. Even before Rosie, he never slept that late. The only times he could ever sleep past seven where right after cases that required long nights and few breaks.
“Stop. You could’ve gotten yourself killed, Sherlock. You need to be more careful.” Most of the blood on his side seemed to be dry, so he was able to wipe it away easily. John peered at the gash. “How deep did the knife go? It doesn’t seem too bad.”
But then John continued to talk about his childhood, and Sherlock remembered there were far more important things going on.
“Oh my God,” he said, rubbing his eyes. “I’m so sorry. So – that was dreadful. Shit.”
Sherlock turned his body so he was facing John. “You don’t understand. You’ve done
As it turned out, navigating a cart through a supermarket with a baby strapped to one’s chest was quite difficult. Sherlock had already bumped into several shelves and a few fellow shoppers, most of whom must have been mindful of Rosie’s presence and chose not to shout at him. It had only taken him two and a half minutes to decide he absolutely loathed grocery shopping and prayed he would never have to do it again. Of course, he knew that the odds of him returning to this very store in a week’s time were very likely, and it only made his bad mood worse.
Sherlock still felt like he was a bit at a loss; his mind was racing through a million different responses, but none of them seemed right. Finally, he blurted out, “If it helps, it took me some time to work it out too.”
“But I should have known,” insisted John. “It’s always been there, somewhere deep in my heart. If I’d figured it out sooner, I wouldn’t have hurt you.”
His gut twisted at the thought of going back. There was a chance he was making a big deal out of nothing, but he didn’t really think he was. After the way things had gone the night before, there was no way there wouldn’t be some residual awkwardness in the air. He just wasn’t ready to confront it. Every time things got tense between them, he feared it would be the end. The end of the only thing he held dear.
Around two in the morning, John startled awake.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, not pushing it at all. John appreciated it greatly. Leaving John where he was, Sherlock went back to his chair and retrieved his violin. John wiped away the last bit of moisture that stuck to his lashes.
“I just… can’t stop fucking up.” He winced. “Sorry. Pardon the language.”
“I told you girlfriends weren’t my area,” Sherlock said, his voice quiet as he placed his mug in the sink. John forgot to be proud of him for it. “On that first night.”
He was rewarded with a pleased smile from Sherlock, and that honestly made eating the same dinner two nights in a row worth it. The fact that Sherlock might cock it up didn’t occur to him for another five minutes, and by that point it was too late. Though if it did, it wouldn’t be too disappointing. John was used to not eating dinner.
For the first time since Rosie had gone to bed, Sherlock smiled. It was small, but it still made John sag with relief.
<><><>
Far away, sirens can be heard. Someone nearby must’ve called it in. It’s too late now. Sherlock’s breathing is slowing, and it’s getting harder and harder to keep his eyes open.
Sherlock was only a little bit confused. John’s explanation for having him stay an additional night made sense, but it didn’t explain the obvious anxiety he had been feeling when he asked. John probably thought he was being inconspicuous, but Sherlock knew how to read him. He could see the tension in his shoulders and left hand, and the way his eyes were resolutely focused on Sherlock’s, like he was forcing himself not to look away.
“A good solution,” repeated Sherlock. “Right. Of course. How very kind of you.”
“Stop.” Sherlock was firm, and almost angry. “I don’t want to cause you any more pain. I don’t want to
Rosie brightened a little. “So he might come home later today?”
. There were very few people John was willing to call for help, and that list was rapidly shrinking. Mrs. Hudson had just gone out of town, too. The only name left was…
Relieved.
He supposed he should have expected it. Since Mary’s death, his and John’s relationship had been carefully restrained at best, and that was only recently. Sherlock still bore the bruises and cuts John’s fists had bestowed upon him. They had only just been on the verge of some kind of reparation before Sherlock’s deepest, darkest secret was flung out into the open.
Greg stood up and clapped John on the shoulder. “You’re a good man, John Watson.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Something not unlike electricity shot through Sherlock’s body, and for a second he didn’t think he could do it. He couldn’t leave this man behind.
as much as this one did. He didn’t understand why this one was making more of an impact, and he was afraid to figure it out.
Sherlock sighed. “Eurus wants me for whatever reason. She will find me wherever I am. As I am currently residing in your house, she will most likely come here. As she has proven already, she is dangerous. She will not hesitate to hurt anyone who stands between us. That would include you and Rosamund. Therefore, it is only logical that I take my leave.”
Sherlock’s mind was still whirling the next morning.
Except they don’t make it back to Baker Street.
“Want to grab lunch then? Say around one?”
with him. Thinking about it now, as he laid in bed staring at the ceiling, it all made perfect sense. The strong desire to touch Sherlock in any way possible while they made breakfast in the mornings. The rush of affection he would feel during quiet nights in front of the telly, when he would look over and see Sherlock relaxed and unguarded. The pain he felt whenever Sherlock brushed off their closeness. Hell, he even finally understood his feelings toward Irene Adler and why she bothered him so much.
Sherlock hid his sheepish grin behind his wineglass. “Mummy stopped me after the third.”
John held his gaze for a moment more before nodding. “Okay. Okay, yeah. Fine. Tell him thanks.”
It felt like an eternity, but John finally swiveled his head to look at Sherlock. Even from a distance, Sherlock could see the pain in his eyes. They were shining in that telltale way that meant Sherlock would be shattered in a moment.
Based on the look on Sherlock’s face, he clearly had not been expecting that. “I mentioned that
Sherlock licked his lips. “Great.”
"I can deduce things,” Sherlock said. “I could tell it’s your first year as a counselor because you’ve come out of your way to help someone who isn’t one of your charges. Older counselors don’t do that. Also, your tone of voice when you came in suggested that you had no idea what you were doing. And your shirt is brand new.”
“Are you going to stand there all night?” John asked. “Or are you going to give your husband a kiss?”
All the way across the lawn, John could see Harry sitting with a group of girls. Occasionally he could hear a peal of laughter, and Harry would throw her head back. He could tell she was smiling. It left a bittersweet taste in his mouth.
“Merry Christmas, Rosie my love,” John said, his voice thick. “I’m so sorry I wasn’t here earlier.”
There was something about John that compelled Sherlock to give in, to admit what he’d always known but never wanted to say. Maybe it was his earnest expression, or his damn sparkling eyes, or his quiet, sweet voice. Sherlock didn’t know. And that alone was an incredible thing. Sherlock didn’t
“Have you been here the whole time?”
he thought, halfway to sitting up,
Just the night before, they had been in front of the telly watching some godawful singing competition that John said he’d developed a bit of an attachment to not long after Mary’s death. Sherlock had tensed at the mention of Mary, but John said nothing more about it. Instead, he merely sent Sherlock a small smile and turned back to the show. It had taken Sherlock another two minutes before he could relax, but once he did, the night had been quite enjoyable.
he thought. Hadn’t Lestrade just told him roughly the same thing a week ago? Hadn’t he told Lestrade he would go speak to Sherlock and fix things? Sherlock had been standing in his home hours ago, his eyes begging for John to speak to him, and John had let him go without a fight.
