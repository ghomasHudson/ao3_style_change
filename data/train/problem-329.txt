We were not perfect. We both knew how to throw barbs that hooked under each other’s skin and tore. We were not always happy. But we were as happy as we knew how to be – me, a crippled veteran who would never again work as a soldier or a surgeon, and him, an orphaned consulting detective with an opiate dependence, who understood one another better than most husbands ever understand their wives.
“You are insufferable,” I managed to gasp.
“What do you say, my dear Watson?” he asked. “A few days in Lausanne, relaxing at the Hotel National and chasing up a few leads. Do you feel well enough to undertake a small solo expedition?”
It was not until he had taken me, slowly and unusually tenderly, his nails digging into my shoulders in the dark as his climax followed fast on the heels of my own, that I thought to ask what he was doing there.
At that I had to turn my face away and Holmes, usually sensitive to my mood, stood up and went to file away the offending magazine among his papers.
At this the attendant stepped forward, his eyes on Holmes, and took hold of me by the arm, beginning to tug me towards the door, which was hanging askew from one hinge.
“You did nothing of the kind,” I expostulated, tightening my fingers in his hair. “It was I who threw myself into the path of danger – against your express instructions, in case you have forgotten – because I was unjustifiably angry with you and wished to indulge my ego. Had you not figured out where to find me, I would not be lying here with you. I would be in the ground.”
“It was too bad to spring it on you like this, but Watson here will tell you that I never can resists a touch of the dramatic,” he said, as Phelps seized his hand and kissed it fervently, nothing but gratitude in his touch.
“Damn you man, I’ll have the truth from you yet,” I said to Holmes, whose face had resumed the exhausted, vacant expression of the old beggar I had found in Swandam Lane.
“What of the rest of the household?” I cried, squeezing a shout into a whisper. “What if someone from the village should sneak onto his land? It is a beautiful day – the village children might take it into their heads to take a swim in the lake. What on earth has come over you to take such a risk?”
I was very glad, then, that he could not see my face. I had my answer, and Holmes would never know how much it pained me to learn that he considered all that we had shared the previous night to be nothing more than a passing interlude.
By the time Sherlock’s thoughts starts up again, to his immense relief, flowing along at their usual speed, John is sliding between the sheets. He turns his back on Sherlock and yanks the duvet up, tucking it around his hunched shoulders.
The more immersed I became in Holmes’ strange business, the more tolerable I found the times when I was left to myself, with nothing but my memories, my nightmares and my increasingly wayward fantasies. I ceased drinking in the mornings, though I still availed myself of a medicinal draft at night, for my nightmares had not ceased, although they had lessened somewhat, perhaps as a result of our mental and physical exertions, which often left me in a state of extreme exhaustion at the end of each day.
“You were always so distant,” he said, sinking down to sit upon his heels and looking up at me. “You were so careful whenever we were together. I could see that there were things behind your eyes that you took pains never to say. You never stayed in my bed after our encounters – you left as soon as you reasonably could, preferring to sleep alone than in my arms. You were disgusted by my drug use and angry about my absences and hurt by my appalling manner when I lashed out at you, as I so often do. I knew that you were still recovering from your experiences in the war. Being with me is the closest thing you found in London to being a soldier – I knew that too, even if you did not. But I always assumed that once you regained your equilibrium you would leave me. When you went back to work last week, I knew that the time was close at hand.”
He smiled me, his eyes dancing.
“His fiancée is an interesting woman. Of quite a different temperament than your friend. He seems to be of a most delicate disposition and his physical state is hardly more robust. He is as slender as a rake. But perhaps his slight build accentuates his frailty in the wake of his unfortunate illness.”
At a loss for words, I took several deep breaths, attempting to clear my mind as I had learned to do during my time on the frontlines when panic threatened to overwhelm me. I was still a doctor, I reminded myself. Resisting the urge to keep shaking him, I placed two fingers on his cool throat. His pulse was slow but steady. The colour was already coming back into his face and his lips were no longer blue. He was only half dressed, and his shirt, open at the neck, revealed a slice of smooth, pallid skin. He looked like a waxwork rendering of himself, but he no longer resembled a corpse.
“What?”
“I know you do.”
“Come on,” John sighs and takes his hand.
“When you’re worried about me you get angry, and when you get angry you –”
Sherlock runs through twenty three possible explanations for his own illogical reaction and checks his mind palace for anything relevant that he might have indexed on sex and sentiment and John. None of it clarifies anything. By the time Sherlock decides that it can’t hurt to allow himself two to four hours of sleep before he begins the search for a new case, he is no closer to solving the puzzle. He needs more data. Easy enough. He’ll just make John say it again.
“I did not know anything of your whereabouts or of the threat facing Whitney,” I admitted. “His wife came to Baker Street and asked me to bring him home. I have never been so shocked as I was to see you at that window. But I still do not understand why you were in disguise or why you allowed Wainwright to arrest you.”
“Minimal. I’m the bloody doctor, Sherlock. Not you. There’s always a margin of error.”
“You – Sherlock bloody Holmes – are saying sorry.”
He nipped my lower lip playfully as he pulled away from me, eliciting a small moan of protest, but then his long fingers were gently loosening the knot of my tie and I pushed aside the urgency that had begun to build within me, resolving to let Holmes set the pace and to relish every moment of the experiment he had gone to such lengths to arrange. It still filled me with sorrow to know that he had hidden such an essential part of himself from me for so long. I was still discovering the extent to which my lover, who I had so often dismissed as cold and mechanical, was in fact capable of unguarded warmth.
“Veno –”
He sighed beneath me and reached restlessly for his shirt and I knew that our fragile moment of peace was over.
Holmes stared at me as though I had gone mad.
“Of that I am well aware, my dear fellow. No doubt you are as unaware of the effect you had on Phelps and as he was of his own effect on Harrison.”
“All of it,” I admitted, and he laughed softly.
“It’s obviously not fine.”
“Do not allow yourself to indulge yourself in false hope, Mr Phelps. The affair is a very tangled one,” he said in parting, and I saw my old friend’s face fall, but he rallied admirably and thanked Holmes most earnestly for his help.
By that late summer afternoon, Holmes had taken me more times than I could count, but there in the sunlight, under the dappled shade of the oak tree, with the hay-scented breeze blowing over us and the sound of birdsong in the air, the deed felt unaccountably solemn. The act of physically joining our bodies seemed in that moment to symbolise something indescribable and profound, encapsulating a union that I already knew would shape the remainder of my life. I do not know if Holmes felt as I did or whether it was simply the novelty of our surroundings that drew out his passion to a greater extent than ever, but he was whispering broken endearments into my ear as I sank my nails into his back, muffling my own cries in the curve of his shoulder. He found his release first, biting my name into the thick muscles of my shoulder, and the sight of him experiencing his paroxysm, all control relinquished, triggered my own convulsions, though he had not touched me.
Holmes asked a few desultory questions about Phelps’ people at the foreign office and then lapsed once again into silence. His eyes were still closed.
My heart was beating treacherously fast in the darkness and my heightened emotions seemed to amplify every tiny aspect of Holmes' touch as he reached around me and began to undo the fastening of my trousers with one hand. The other slid through the short sensitive hairs at the nape of my neck and then wrapped itself gently around my throat, just as he reached inside my trousers and grasped the swollen evidence of my arousal firmly in his fist. Holmes' careful, implacable grip on my throat did not restrict my breathing – at least not much – but I knew the strength of those hands. To my surprise and shame, I found the delicate pressure of his fingers wrapped around my windpipe almost unbearably arousing. In his usual dictatorial manner, he silently demanded that I submit myself utterly to his control, caressing me with expert fingers as a fine layer of sweat sprang out on my brow. He hissed through his teeth as I bucked in his arms, thrusting into his fist. Then the hand with which I had been pleasuring myself was gone, leaving me aching and bereft in the dark. Holmes retained his careful grip on my throat as I felt him fumbling behind me and then something wet and smooth and cold was probing the most intimate part of me. I felt a throbbing burst of excitement as I realised it was the rounded metal handle of his hunting crop. I gasped and swore as he eased the tip of the implement inside me, feeling him smile against my cheek as he did so. Only once he had reduced me to a state of boneless incoherence did he remove the crop and replace it with one of his long, clever fingers. I fought to remain still and silent as he brought my arousal to a fever pitch. By the time he withdrew his finger and placed the tip of himself at my entrance, I was utterly lost in the feel of him, pressing my shoulders forward to increase the pressure of his hand at my throat and my hips backward as I silently begged him to take me, fighting desperately to keep my hands braced on the crate in front of me, despite the ache in my neglected member.
“When I saw you enter the den, I assumed you had come in search of me,” said Holmes. “I knew that the inspector would recognise you and that there was a chance that your presence would threaten my disguise. So I withdrew to the room upstairs where you would not catch sight of me. I watched from the window as you left with Whitney but then I saw Wainwright approaching and cried out, intending to warn you. I did not think that he would attempt to harm you out in the open, but he is a ruthless man and a desperate one. It is our great luck that Wainwright chose to follow you back into the den and not to do away with Whitney while he was unguarded and out of his wits.”
“I don't either! Not anymore.”
For perhaps the first time since I had known him, Holmes seemed lost for words. His eyes raked my face, from my ears to my cheeks, then down to my jaw and my lips. I felt the weight of his gaze like a caress. But still he said nothing.
“It is not the same thing,” I said, driven to sudden anger. “My accompanying you was an attempt to ensure that you did not face a dangerous situation alone – whatever form that danger might take. Your decision to keep from me the nature of the peril only ensured that I was in no position to help you when the time came. Why allow me to accompany you at all if you intended to prevent me from being of use?”
“There is this man,” said the inspector, pointing a dramatic finger at Holmes. “He was in the room the entire time, as the locked door attests.”
“What, Sherlock? What do I do?”
“Why did you not honour my wish that you remain behind?”
I awoke gently, coming back to life slowly and sweetly, as I had used to do before the war. The sun was already high in the sky and I was utterly disoriented. For a moment or two I lay still, struggling to make sense of why the window was not in the right place and wondering how I had managed to pass a whole night without a nightmare. Then I registered the lean, distinctly masculine arm wrapped loosely around my abdomen. In the morning light, a smattering of fine black hair stood out starkly against the pale skin. In a moment, the events of the night came back to me and I froze, heat pooling in my stomach as I registered that I was lying naked beside my friend, who, if memory served, must be equally unclothed. No wonder I had not dreamed. We could have been asleep for no more than an hour or two, I realised, recalling that the first blush of dawn had already begun to appear behind the curtains when at last I had fallen into an exhausted sleep.
Sherlock is always aware of time passing. The counting off of seconds, minutes, hours, is something that happens in one small part of his brain. It is as boring – and as unconscious – as breathing. But he isn’t sure how many seconds have passed when he realises that John has stopped talking and is gripping him by the left arm, iron fingers digging into the flesh just above his bicep. Despite his anger, Sherlock notes that John is using his right hand – his non-dominant hand – careful, even in his anger, to touch the side of Sherlock’s body that isn’t bruised.
She sank gracefully onto the sofa, without waiting for an invitation, folding her delicate hands in her lap.
“In that respect, I was successful. She knew that I had some plan, but she could not have guessed the nature it would take. When you cried out and she saw the smoke, she gave herself away. The photograph is behind a sliding panel above the fireplace. And yet the knowledge is useless to me. She took great delight in letting me know that she had identified me. I have scarcely ever been so surprised as I was when she whispered my name in my ear.”
“It would seem that she is not,” he responded. “Once she revealed that she knew who I was, she admitted that the whole marriage was a sham staged for my benefit. The man was her cousin, who agreed to play the role of the groom, and the officiant was no more a member of the clergy than I am. She had been warned about me, you see, and recognised me outside her home. When she saw me return, yesterday morning, she put her plan into action. She hoped that if I thought her happily married and no longer in need of the photograph, I would give up the case.”
“We thought we'd lost you, Dr Watson,” said Lestrade, who was kneading my shoulder firmly, as though unaware of what his hands were doing. He glanced anxiously at Holmes, who was stony faced and unreadable.
“Which part?” he enquired languidly, running his fingers idly through the hair on my chest. Unlike his own, which was fine and sparse, as soft as the down on a woman's legs, mine was thick and springy and redder than the hair on my head.
“What is it?”
“Do you know, Watson,” he said, his face ghostly and indistinct in the gathering darkness. “I really have some scruples as to taking you tonight.”
“I fear that your friend may have been dealt a mischief,” the inspector said, turning back to me.
I felt Holmes’ warm hand clasp my shoulder in silent approval as we left the inspector to process his catch and turned our steps towards Baker Street.
The weight of having been once again left in the dark by the man I trusted above all others was still sitting, curdled and ugly, in my chest, but I took a deep breath and made an effort to consider the matter from as dispassionate a position as Holmes would in my place. Infuriating though his habit of concealment was, I had never known him to lie. If he said that Lady Carfax’s life was in danger, it assuredly was. If he said that he needed my help, I could only assume that he did. After all, I reasoned, he had not been forced to confess that he had been in Montpellier for days. He must have known the effect his admission would have on me.
Sherlock drops his eyes again but he moves forward a little into the press of John’s hand, which has migrated to the side of his neck, warm and steady.
“Sherlock, please, don’t do this. I love you too much. You can’t die. You can’t. Don’t you dare... Jesus. Just. Hold on, okay?”
“My dear fellow,” I interrupted him, “I am sorry for creating a version of you that was cold and imperious and stripped of the qualities that I most admire. I can only excuse it by saying that it helped me to manage the fact that what I felt for you –”
“These words exactly: What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out, Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come,” Sherlock instructed. John looked up worriedly.
“Doctor Watson, what do you think?” Sherlock ignored Lestrade and looked at John.
“Got anything?” Lestrade asks.
“Yes, well, as I was saying, dull,” Sherlock replied as he rolled his eyes. A pang of dismay hit John’s heart. It shouldn’t surprise him that Sherlock doesn’t care about relationships or soul mates, given what he has seen of the man so far.
“Likewise, John, please call me Mycroft,” the posh man said with a smirk.
“Of course, yeah – but what mistake?!” Lestrade yelled after him. Sherlock came back and yelled, “PINK!” before walking away quickly. Lestrade sighed as he started to organize his people. John looked around and wondered what he is supposed to do. He started walking down the stairs when the DI stopped him.
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes and saw that John was still asleep. Soft snores from the man filled the air. Sherlock didn’t move away from the bed in case John woke up and just started to play with John’s hair in order to calm himself down. This caused John to hum in content. Sherlock smiled softly.
Sherlock thought in reply. John looked at the detective in surprise again.
“Well, maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it fell out somewhere,” Lestrade supplied. Sherlock raised an incredulous eyebrow at that.
John thought as his heart skipped a beat.
Sherlock tuned him out and continued to text, although he couldn’t ignore the warm feeling in his chest. John didn’t seem to notice it and so, Sherlock didn’t disturb him.
“No, Donovan. I warned you a lot of times already and you still haven’t listened to me. Now, you were being unprofessional and insulted a man without being provoked in front of civilians,” Lestrade said. Donovan looked angry and insulted as she walked away with Lestrade shaking his head disappointedly at her.
“Why?” she responded haughtily
“What does that mean?” John implored.
“Rachel is not a name,” Sherlock said to Lestrade.
John asked. Sherlock turned towards John and saw him looking at the mark on his shoulder.
“Right. Detective Inspector Lestrade?” John implored.
“Why a taxi? Oh, that's clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?” Sherlock continued to muse.
“Don't bother,” he retorted. John never liked being bribed.
, John thought as he shakes his head. Minutes went by, and the pain and fear continued to increase. His heart felt like it was trying to jump out of his chest. His wounded shoulder throbbed painfully and his left leg was jittery. A sound from the laptop brought him out of his thoughts and relayed the new directions to the cabbie.
“This one did. Will you come?” the man requested.
“You agreed, John. I was against it from the start,” Sherlock whined.
“Sorry, it’s in my coat,” Mike said apologetically-although, he doesn’t sound so apologetic to John. Wanting a chance to talk to the man, John offered his phone. The man looked at him in surprise and then, his blue-green eyes –
“As I said before, you two have a weird relationship,”
“Why do you keep saying suitcase?” Sherlock’s attention was back to Lestrade.
“Have you done it?”
“It’s an old friend of mine, John Watson,” Mike introduced. The man carefully took the phone without touching John. John felt a bit disappointed that he wasn’t able to touch the beautiful man.
*****
“Why would I do that?”
“You said I had a therapist,” John probed.
“Keep looking, guys,” Lestrade ordered. “Or you could help us properly and I'll stand them down,” Lestrade said to Sherlock.
“You offered? You don’t like people, Sherlock. You think we are all idiots,” the DI said in disbelief. Sherlock rolled his eyes in exasperation.
*****
“That’s one way of putting it, yes,”
“Yeah,” Sherlock affirmed.
it?” John clarified as he glared at the woman.
“Of the message?” John clarified.
“Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade,” Sherlock answered. John nodded.
Sherlock sent to John.
He turned and saw a slightly obese and familiar-looking man walking towards him.
“While they’re doing that, why don’t you join me at the pub, John?” Greg asked. John smiled and nodded.
Sherlock thought to John. John smiled proudly and without hesitation, answered
Sherlock was sat on his chair in his pajamas and his blue silk robe while John was cooking breakfast. His mind was buzzing and noisy as it usually is. Most importantly, he was bored.
Sherlock replied to his brother.  John came down and walked up to Sherlock.
“We are here,” the cabbie informed them. Sherlock got out and waited for John as he paid the cabbie.
“That’s because he is a freak,” she explained. John raised a condescending eyebrow at her.
“John!”
“And if I do this, you will provide me information about Moriarty?”
“I got shot,” John replied flatly. He tightened his hold on his cane. A tense silence filled the air.
“What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to get me if there wasn't something different,” Sherlock said.
“Lestrade, this is Doctor John Watson. John, the Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Sherlock introduced the two men to each other. John nodded his head in greeting. The DI gave him a curious look.
“Sherlock, I would like you to accompany me after dinner,” Mycroft said, breaking the silence.
“How do you know she had a suitcase?” Lestrade asked again.
John thought in disbelief. Sherlock nodded, amused. John continued to look around in amazement.
“I can’t afford London on an army pension,” John replied sadly.  Mike nodded understandingly.
“Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you,” the man said as he took the cup from her. “What happened to the lipstick?” The woman smiled sadly.
“Hey, where-where did you get this?” John asked as he looks at Sherlock’s hand, not making a move to touch him. Sherlock carefully handed the ID to John. John read it with perplexity.
“Rachel,” John answered quietly. Sherlock turned to look at John in surprise.
“I can take care of myself, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, annoyed.
“I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational,” John said to Lestrade.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” the man asked while still typing on John’s phone. John’s eyes were widening in surprise.
Sherlock thought. John just chuckled and turned towards Mycroft and Lestrade. He noticed that they were standing too closely to each other. Remembering Mycroft’s mark on his left wrist, he started to wonder if Lestrade was Mycroft’s soul mate. He felt the evident joy coming from Sherlock.
“Yeah,” Sherlock lied. “Everything all right?”
, John thought sadly
“What are you to him?” Lestrade asks as the woman from earlier walked up to them and stood beside her boss. John gave him a look of confusion.
“Well, he won't be your assistant,” the man said, looking like he expected this response from Sherlock. This made John curios about how long the man has known Sherlock.
“What about your taxi?” Mrs. Hudson asked quietly. Sherlock’s control snapped.
“Relax, you're doing fine,” Sherlock smiled. “Well?”
“Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?”  John asked, trying to sound unconcerned.
John thought, still sounding surprised. Sherlock frowned.
“Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything,” Sherlock said truthfully.
“Then what is it?” Lestrade asked the detective. John moved towards the pink case before Sherlock told him to. Sherlock called out his name as he opened his laptop. Before Sherlock could say anything else, John responded with, “jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.”
“Where are you going, John?”
“You know, I've got a phone,” John said as he limped his way towards the posh stranger, “I mean, very clever and all that, but er... you could just phone me- on my phone. “  The two men stood facing each other and sizing each other up. John noticed that the man had similar features to Sherlock.
*****
“Seen a lot of injuries too, then; violent deaths,” Sherlock continued. John nodded again in agreement.
There was just something about the man that John found so intriguing. He was clearly a smart and clever man to be able to know all those things about John. He just wanted to know how the man did it. He was curious. Also, something about the man screamed danger and excitement that made John’s heart race with adrenaline. He couldn’t wait to meet Sherlock tomorrow.
Sherlock replied. John sighed and looked at the pair across them. The two were waiting, although Mycroft seemed to be trying to keep his impatience from showing.
“You don't have anyone special, then?” John asked carefully.
“Sorry. Obvious?” John asked confused- this seemed to be his normal state of mind when dealing with Sherlock.
“Did he offer you money to spy on me?” Sherlock asked conspiratorially.
“In real life. There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn't happen,” John clarified.
“Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. On the house, for you and for your date,” the man offered generously. Sherlock sat back down and looked at John.
“Sorry!”
John shakes his head.
“Yes,”
“No, that's... that's not right. How? Why would she do that? Why?” Sherlock questioned.
“Yes,” Mycroft nodded. “They are likely from the terrorist group that I wanted you to investigate.”
“I'm breaking every rule letting you in here,” Lestrade elucidated as he tried to get Sherlock to understand the ‘rules’.
“Never mind that. We found the case,” Anderson injected rudely. “According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favorite psychopath.” John frowned angrily at the forensic officer’s statement, unaware that Lestrade was watching him.
“Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much,” John replied trying and failing to keep the excitement from showing on his face.
John smiled warmly at the detective. Sherlock, suddenly, looked serious;
“I'm not his date!” John called out after him.
Sherlock whined in his head. John looked at him firmly and Sherlock could feel John’s displeasure.
“So should I call you a freak too? Since you’re an officer and you also like these kinds of stuff,” John said. The woman gave him a shocked look.
“Why?”
John smiled as he read the text. He didn’t know how the man got his number but he shouldn’t be all that surprised. The man apparently has numerous talents and John found that enthralling.
“What, An- Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?” Sherlock exclaimed in disbelief.
“So I'm basically filling in for your skull?” John asked blankly.
“Yes, that’s correct to some extent. You are right in a sense that if the wrong people find out then that could be problematic but I don’t doubt that some of them already know or more specifically, those criminals with enough power and influence are already keeping track as much as they can about Mycroft’s movements. I know Mycroft has already prepared countless safety measures should he be compromised. Also for the common people, well, they would certainly cause a fuss about it and it would be harder for public figures to keep face, so to speak,” Sherlock explained. John frowned in concern.
“I was asking Sherlock about how he did it,”
John thought with disdain.
“It’s a crime scene. I don’t want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?” the man ordered conceitedly. John’s previous anger returned.
John thought in relief.
“Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you're looking for a flatshare – you wouldn't waste money on this. It's a gift, then. Scratches, not one, many over time. It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. Next bit's easy. You know it already,” Sherlock said expectantly.
“Give and take, five years,” Sherlock answered, “Is there any reason you’re asking me these questions?”
John nodded in agreement, “That’s true. However, we have plenty of time for that tomorrow. For now, just sleep.” John lay back down.
“Are you still at Bart’s, then?” John asked.
“Sister!” Sherlock exclaimed, very irritated. John fought off a smile from creeping into his face.
“Your deodorant told me that,” Sherlock replied.
“What? Yeah, yeah.  I-I'm fine,” the detective answered quietly. John stayed quiet as he continued to watch the detective. Sherlock, then, started heading towards the door.
, John thought as he looked at the detective in the eye.
“How do you feel about the violin?” the man asked. His attention was back to John.
“I was invited,” Sherlock said indifferently but John could see the hurt on the man’s face.
“What can you tell me about him?”
“If you do move into, um... two hundred and twenty-one B Baker Street, I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way,” the man said instead.
“I am better and much faster, obviously, and he could just get the information he needs from Lestrade,”
*****
“I was right? Right about what?” John asks, confused.
“Found your website, The Science of Deduction,”
Sherlock could feel John crying and he tightened his hold on the man. They stood there for what felt like hours until John calmed down. The doctor pulled away and smiled at Sherlock with such adoration it made Sherlock’s heart speed up.
, John thought.
“That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?” the man continued. “The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street,” the man smiled and winked at John. John felt his heart jump at the action.
“It's Anderson,” the man replied. Sherlock frowned in distaste as he looked out the window.
“Says the man at the door,” Sherlock’s smirk never leaving his face as he gestured towards the door. Just then, there was a knock at the door. John opened the door to find Angelo standing there.
“No, but I have a suspicion he knows that I do,” Sherlock said as he slowly stood up and walked around the flat. He sensed John following him.
“Well, I can’t say I’m surprised. Although, I’m surprised at the color since a gold-colored bond is beyond rare,” the DI said. Sherlock stayed silent as he looked away. At the back of his mind, John felt Sherlock’s surprise and annoyance. He turned to his mate and saw that he finally noticed his brother.
“Say that again,” he ordered. John looks on confused, his normal reaction to Sherlock it seems.
“Mrs. Hudson took my skull,” Sherlock informed him.
“Cardiff?” Lestrade asked.
! John thought with a smile.
“John! John Watson!”
“Have a seat, John,” the man gestured towards the chair. John looked unimpressed.
Sherlock thought loudly. John sighed in defeat and looked at Sherlock. Stormy blue eyes stared back at him.  He completely opened his mind and showed Sherlock the memory.
“Sorry, are you guys the police?” the man asked confused.
Sherlock replied.  Then, Sherlock focused on his surroundings once more. The car he was in was still moving to their destination and the atmosphere in the car is tense. Both men on either side of Sherlock were alert and tense.
“Anderson won't work with me,” Sherlock said as he continued to frown.
“Yes, thank you for your input,” Sherlock cut him off as he slammed the door to the man’s face, not once looking up from his phone.
“You and your brother sure do have a weird relationship, Sherlock,” John said as he watches Sherlock work.
“Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments?! Yup – sociopath, I'm seeing it now,” Anderson replied sarcastically as he rolled his eyes mockingly at the detective.
Sherlock replied and continued to text another client.
John thought back. Before Sherlock could say anymore, John turned towards the other pair.
“This man got me off a murder charge,” the man said with genuine gratitude laced in his voice.
John thought, amazed.
John thought in amazement. The huge telly was paused on John’s face.  John walked up to it and pick up the remote and pressed play. Both detective and doctor sat down and continued to watch the clips. Sherlock could feel warmth starting to spread towards his cheeks and he did all he could to stop it. John, however, didn’t care and his cheeks started to blush bright red. When the tape ended, John turned off the telly and turned to face Sherlock, who has a black expression on his face.
“I like company when I go out and I think better when I talk aloud. The skull just attracts attention, so...” Sherlock trailed off as he saw the look on John’s face, “problem?”
“Doctor Watson,” Sherlock called him again, a hidden order in his eyes. John hummed in acknowledgment, trying to spare Lestrade from even more stress.
“Yeah, well, this is more fun,” Sherlock smirked shrewdly.
“Well, it seems you’re a match for my foolish little brother. Someone’s got to keep an eye on him,” the man said nonchalantly. “My name is Mycroft and it seems I was right.” John immediately blushed and looked away, tried to block his thoughts from Sherlock. Sherlock was confused and a little jealous and John can still feel that through their bond. He thought about all sorts of things just to keep that certain memory from Sherlock. The detective’s annoyance grew.
“Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for fourteen years. Technically she was never alive. Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, fourteen years ago,” Lestrade informed Sherlock, seemingly confused as well. Sherlock looked puzzled. John could practically see deductions going around Sherlock’s head.
“I have time right now. Also, I’ve witnessed a very interesting conversation between you and John,”
“I’d say private detective…” John trailed off.
“Sorry... what are we doing? Did I just text a murderer?! What good will that do?” John asked confused.
“What gives you the right to call this man a freak?” John clarified for her. The woman’s face hardened.
“How can you possibly know about the drinking?” John said a bit unnerved.
“Just met a friend of yours,” he replied.
“You're very loyal, very quickly,”
“Sherlock, what have you done?” She said with worry.
“Someone special? No, not really my area,” Sherlock said uncaringly. John’s heart throbs painfully at the detective’s words
John frowned as the search ended and called Sherlock. He was ignored, however, as Sherlock continued his conversation with the DI.
“Fun? There's a woman lying dead,” John responded flatly.
“Like a government official?” John probed further. Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked at John.
“That wasn't just me,” John replied. “Why aren't we back at the restaurant?”
Sherlock finally sent to John. Satisfied that Sherlock finally told him what he wanted, John placed both of their orders. John turned to Sherlock and asked, “How did you do that?”
“No, you didn't. It’s how you get your kicks, isn't it? You risk your life to prove you're clever,” John told Sherlock annoyed. Sherlock tilted his head to the side.
“Yeah, I’m not the John Watson…” John stopped and his whole body radiated tension.
“My clothes are upstairs though,”
“What's the address?” John asked as he typed the text as quickly as possible.
“Any good?” Sherlock asked.
“People are idiots,” Sherlock said. John cleared his throat. Sherlock looked at him for a moment. “Most of them, anyway.” Lestrade’s eyes widened. John just looked confused.
“So why are you talking to me?”
“Four,” Sherlock said quietly. “There’s been a fourth and there’s something different this time.”
Sherlock thought to John as he was being moved and pushed roughly inside a vehicle.
“Is this how the officers in New Scotland Yard behave?” John asked the woman using his captain voice. The woman turned to him in surprise as if she just noticed him and Sherlock looks at him with both surprise and intrigue.
, John thought amusedly.
That was all John could feel at the moment as he got in a cab and instructed the driver where to go. Fear that something might happen to that brilliant yet idiotic man. The all-consuming fear gripped his heart making it impossible to breath. What would he do if he was too late? The thought made him gasp in unbearable pain.
“Leaving your toys around my flat again?” Sherlock asked flatly with a hint of annoyance.
“I said is this how the officers in New Scotland Yard behave?” John repeated more firmly this time.
“Shut up, Mycroft,” Sherlock grumbled in irritation and causing John to laugh. That’s when the door opened and Greg walked in.
“Did I get anything wrong?” Sherlock asked out of the blue. John smirked.
“Damn it!” John exclaimed as he followed after the consulting detective. As they walked out the street, he wondered if he could ask Sherlock about his opinion on soul mates. While John was thinking about how to brooch the subject of soul mates to Sherlock, he didn’t notice Sherlock looking at him with a gentle smile. A couple in their late teens walked passed them and John noticed a purple mark on the woman’s wrist. John was immediately filled with envy. He longed to find his soul mate but it seemed that he was destined to be alone. John sighed and turned to look at Sherlock, who by then was observing their surroundings.
“I don't even smoke,” Sherlock said as he showed off his forearm where the nicotine patches were. Lestrade showed off his own forearm. There were nicotine patches there too.
John thought a reply.
“Sorry,” John apologized sheepishly.
“Look at you, all happy. It’s not decent,” Mrs. Hudson said with fondness.
“Well, this is unpleasant,” Sherlock said unnecessarily. Mycroft rolled his eyes. Trust Sherlock to be unafraid when they were outnumbered by men with guns.
“It doesn’t matter, John,”
John praised. Sherlock blushed lightly at the praise. Sherlock watched fondly as John continued to look around. A few seconds later, John noticed Sherlock staring at him fondly and said,
“No. No, I'm just curious. That’s all,” John interrupted. “I'm just saying, it's all fine.”
“Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim,” Lestrade ordered his officers. John, who was watching the detective, noticed him standing still like he’s in shock.
“Do you really think so?” Sherlock asked quietly. John looked at him confused. Sherlock smiled shyly.
“Sherlock, there was no case!” Lestrade said as he tried to calm the eccentric man.
As an idea popped into his head, John sat up and went to fetch his laptop. Opening up the search bar, John typed in
, John thought with awe.
“Upstairs,” the DI replied still looking surprised. “I can give you two minutes. Her name's Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards. We're running them now for contact details. Hasn't been here long. Some kids found her.”
A few minutes later and they found themselves leaning against the wall in the hallways.
“Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together,” The man said patiently. John’s face lit up with recognition. How could he forget? Mike used to be a good friend of his back in the day.
“It's an experiment,” Sherlock explained, frustrated.
“Couldn’t Harry help?” Mike asked after a while. John snorted.
“Because you're an idiot,” Sherlock answered frankly. John gave him a disbelieving look.
“’Trust issues,’ it says here,” the man said, reading a small notepad.
“Mrs. Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?” Sherlock responded sarcastically as he stood up. Without thinking, John sat down on the seat Sherlock vacated.
“I see that Sherlock already told you about me,” the man said with an eyebrow raised. John shakes his head and says, “Nope, I figured it out by myself.”
“Oh, do as he says. Help yourself,” the DI said tiredly as he turned towards the door. “Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes.”
“Are there other things you two can do?” Mycroft asked, looking very much interested. John looked conflicted about whether he should tell them or not.
“In exchange for what?” John asked.
“I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now, here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t a difficult leap,” he answered in a confident voice as he put on his coat.
“I’ve heard about him, Sherlock, but there’s only so much I can do about a criminal mastermind. There was speculation, however, that suspect his involvement,”
“Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight. That's the frailty of genius, John, it needs an audience,” Sherlock answered, sounding very much like he experienced it himself.
Sherlock smiled and nodded. He let go of his hand and gently picked up John’s right wrist with his left hand. When their marks touched, a pleasant shiver ran up their spines. The mark consisted of two hands cradling a heart with a crown on top. The hands wrapped around their wrists. The outlines were a darker shade of gold, so the symbol could be seen perfectly. It was beautiful.
“John,” Sherlock said quietly. John stiffened. Sherlock was getting angry.
“Crime scene. Next?” Sherlock answered.
“Oh? And what did he do to upset you, John?” Mycroft asked with a hint of amusement on his face.
“Haven't the faintest. Hungry?” Sherlock asked as they entered a small Italian restaurant. “Thank you, Billy,” said the consulting detective as a waiter opened the door and led them to a table by the window. Both men sat down facing each other. John opened the menu and scanned it while Sherlock looked out the window.
“You've met him. How many 'friends' do you imagine he has? I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having,” the man said.
“There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase,” Lestrade repeated and clarified.
“Come on, who’d want me for a flatmate?” John said with a humorless smile. Mike was smiling knowingly. His eyes lit up with mischief. John’s eyebrows crossed together in confusion.
“Nicotine patch. Helps me think,” Sherlock exhaled deeply. “Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.” John frowned.
A few minutes later, Sherlock opened his eyes and saw John sitting on the table and smiling down at him softly. There was a faint blush on the doctor’s face.
“If it won’t be too much trouble, officer, we would like to proceed to the crime scene as requested by the Detective Inspector,” John continued. The woman wordlessly lifted the tape and informed the DI of Sherlock’s arrival as she walked ahead of them. The two men started walking towards the building.
“Fine,” Sherlock said with a frown. John smiled at him and gestured towards the table. Sherlock sat down sulkily. He felt a hand ruffle his curls soothingly.
“The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention – particularly a man, which is statistically more likely. So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it- wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realize his mistake. I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed- took me less than an hour to find the right skip,” Sherlock explained smugly.
John just laughed and the thought,
John thought with fear and disbelief.
John Watson has always been fascinated by his mark. It was two beautifully designed curved swords crossed together to form an X. It was black in color just like everyone else who hasn’t found their soul mate yet. It was located on his left forearm. He would often spend hours just watching his mark and trying to memorize every part of it. He always dreamed of meeting his soul mate and imagining what they look like and what their mark consisted of. He imagined what color it was going to be when they touched and what their new mark was going to be. His mum and dad have an infinity symbol on their wrist in a lovely blue color. It always looked beautiful to John.  He couldn’t wait to meet his other half! Harry had already met hers. It was a girl named Clara and their marks turned blue too. Their new mark was a rose filled with thorns. John had a bad feeling when he first saw it. The ominous feeling he got made him think that their relationship wasn’t going to be smooth sailing. Now, at 18, he still hasn’t met his soul mate and he felt lonely since most of his friends met theirs already- their marks turning mostly to greens and blue. Since he always wanted to help others, he decided to become a doctor and join the army. He studied and trained hard for the next few years. All the while wishing and waiting for his other half. When he was about to go on his first tour, he spent his last night having dinner with his family and, later, staring at his mark. It looks as fascinating as ever. He always wondered what it meant. Marks are supposed to represent your soul and he always wondered what his meant. Two swords forming an X have to mean something other than fighting. Thinking about his mark made him think about his soul mate and end up missing someone he never met. John sighed and went to sleep.
“Have you talked to the police?” John asked as he twisted on his couch to look at the man.
A few minutes, john found himself standing outside the police tape as he waited for Sherlock to come out. He didn’t have to wait long as both the DI and Sherlock came out followed by Sergeant Donovan and the body of the dead serial killer. He watched as Lestrade and Sherlock talked. Sherlock looks annoyed as a paramedic keeps putting an orange blanket on Sherlock’s shoulders. Then he saw Sherlock walked towards him. John couldn’t help but ran his eyes over Sherlock’s body for any signs of injury. From the corner of his eyes, he saw a black car parked by the road and Sherlock’s brother standing beside it. When Sherlock was in front of him, they stared at each other in silence. John was starting to feel angry. How dare this man put him through that?
Frustrated, John turned off his laptop and went back to bed.
“Sherlock and I better get going. We can give our statements tomorrow, Lestrade. It was nice meeting you again, Mr. Holmes.” John said. Lestrade smiled knowingly and said, “I’m sure you’re both tired. I’ll stop by tomorrow and, John, you can call me Greg.” John smiled and nodded.
John thought. John continued walking and when a phone rang, he went inside the booth and answered it.
“It's a drugs bust, Mrs. Hudson,” John answered her when it became clear that Sherlock wasn’t going to.
“Oh, for God's sake!” Anderson cried out in anger.
“What's wrong with my hand?”
“...Okay,” John responded uncertainly. Then, a big man with long slightly curly hair and a huge smile came up to their table.
“No, I'm not. I'm just not interested,” John countered, trying to keep the warmth from spreading to his cheeks.
“Because he gets off on these kinds of stuff. He likes it,” she explained.
John thought to Sherlock.
“Well, what do you call this then?” Sherlock asked as he gestured towards the room.
“You are skilled at infiltration and data gathering, Sherlock, as well as hand-to-hand combat and weaponry. Also, with your intellect and proficiency in numerous languages, you were the perfect person for the job. It was a last resort, I assure you. You know perfectly well I hate putting you in dangerous situations if I could help it,” Mycroft said quietly as he observed the situation outside.
“You’re both leaving?” she asked. Sherlock stopped to look at her and then, walks up to her and grabs her shoulders gently.
“Ah,” John was speechless for a moment, “Er, thank you. Thank you,” John said as he closed the door. John turned to face Sherlock with a look of amazement. Before either man could say something, Mrs. Hudson walked out the door with a worried look on her otherwise gentle face.
“Is that it?” John asked seriously. The man stopped and turned to look at him.
“Wait, no, we have a whole team right outside,” Lestrade said, trying to stop John from going near the dead body.
“Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed,” John said. Sherlock smiled.
“No, I think he's brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They're always so desperate to get caught,” Sherlock said with a bit of excitement.
John thought horrified. He, quickly, turned away from the window and grabbed the laptop and his coat. He ran towards the door. Just before he reached it, a hand grabbed his uninjured shoulder. He turned and saw Lestrade looking at him confused.
Sherlock smiled widely before returning his attention back towards John’s soul mark. He gently ran his thumb across it.
John wondered. Sherlock blushed lightly,
Sherlock frowned.
“What about her?” Sherlock looked at him curiously.
“No, seriously, what am I doing here?” John asked again and was once again ignored.
“Are these human eyes?” she asked.
“But how?” Lestrade inquired. John’s eyebrows furrowed in thought.
“Are we done?” John asked impatiently.
, Sherlock thought.
“Now look, whatever you're trying to imply...” The man started to explain.
“Not the murderer,”
“Yes,”
“Sherlock?” John said, worried.
The text from Mycroft said. Sherlock frowned. Before he could decline the invite from his overbearing brother, John sent his opinion.
“This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go,” Sherlock deduced. “Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?” he continued oratorically.
“Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas!” Sherlock said excitedly as he prepared to go out. Mrs. Hudson smiled motherly at him as she went downstairs. Sherlock suddenly stopped and looked at John. John looked at him in return with one eyebrow raised in question.
“That’s funny because I was there when your boss, DI Lestrade, came to get Sherlock,” John said with a smirk. The woman’s face fell.
“Nothing, just... ‘Welcome to London’,” John chuckled, Sherlock let a laugh. John watched, amazed. Sherlock’s unguarded smile was beautiful. His eyes twinkled with mirth. John felt his heart flutter with pride for being able to make Sherlock smile like this, so unlike his empty smiles.
“Yes, yes, I think so. My thought precisely,” Sherlock responded. Looking around some more, John noticed bits and pieces of personal items around the flat.
Sherlock smiled, amused.
. Numerous links appeared and on top of the list was a website called The Science of Deduction. Intrigued, John clicked the link. As he read the articles, John’s curiosity about the man grew. Could he really do all these? How, though? Continuing his research, John opened other links but he couldn’t find anything else worth reading.
“Yeah, I wasn’t really thinking about the menu but on what Sherlock might like to eat. While I was thinking that, Sherlock used my eyes to pick something from the menu since I was looking at it but like I said I wasn’t thinking about it,” John tried to explain to the DI. Greg frowned in confusion.
“Well, of course, it's for men! I'm wearing it!” The man said, looking very insulted.
“I cannot make any promises. I am a busy man,” I responded, which, to my surprise and delight, elicited the first wink I had ever seen Sherlock Holmes give.
“It was certainly a most unexpected one,” he replied. He was laughing as he proceeded to tell me how, watching outside Miss Adler’s house, he had seen her jump into a landau and make haste towards the Church of Saint Monica.
“Not if you didn’t want to. I know how you feel about me. I also know that you’re smart. I knew you’d get there without my help.”
Before he could reply, I was kissing my way down his chest, brushing my lips teasingly over the muscles of his abdomen. I paused when I drew close to my goal, teasing him with hot breath, licking down into the dip carved out by his external oblique muscles and then stilling with my mouth hovering just an inch from where he wanted me. I waited until he groaned and then allowed myself to smile, blowing warm air over him until he shivered and twitched towards me.
“I don’t have a death wish,” he says at last, quietly. “I don’t want to go anywhere you can’t come with me.”
A hand touches his chin and exerts gentle pressure. Against his better judgement, he allows John to angle his face upwards until their eyes meet.
Both of us moaned when Holmes finally pushed inside me and then his lips were at my ear and he was whispering to me as he thrust in slow, maddening circles, gripping me tightly by the hip.
“Now wait a moment,” the inspector said, to my surprise. “You’ll forgive me if I take the word of an army man over that of an opium peddler.”
John wriggles a little bit until Sherlock resumes running his fingers across the smooth skin of his back, feeling the shift in texture where the bullet exited his body, just missing his left scapula.
Wordlessly, he held up the photograph. It was a portrait of the opera singer, arrayed regally in a dark evening gown, her black hair loose around her shoulders. She looked as beautiful and as proud and as dangerous as a queen from a fairy tale. The King of Bohemia was nowhere to be seen.
Wainwright leaned forward and began to tug at the pile of fabric that lay atop my friend, still partially concealing his form. What I had taken to be a pile of rags revealed itself to be a heap of men’s clothing, stained and dirty and torn but originally of fine quality.
“You see, I am not as infallible a logician as you make me out to be,” he said, when at last he pulled away, his cheeks faintly flushed in a way I could now freely acknowledge to myself that I adored. “This is exactly why it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has all the data. In this case, I may have twisted the facts to suit my theories, instead of the theories to suit the facts.”
I felt myself flush at his words.
“Holmes,” I ventured, into the darkness. “Have you really known for months that I desired you?”
He laughed, and, still laughing, came quickly across the room and kissed me on the mouth. Moments of unguarded, straight-forward affection such as these between us were rare, particularly when Holmes was distracted by a case, and I felt my heart leap within my chest at the sensation.
“There is a distinct element of danger."
“If we should agree on a song."
But in the end, I believe, it was the complete and total absence of light that gave me the courage to speak. Surrounded by velvety darkness and the hot, metallic smell of the shielded lantern, listening to the sound of our mingled breaths, I finally found the words to broach the topic that had been foremost in my mind ever since Holmes had spoken of it that morning.
Holmes had already developed a theory to explain the bizarre story that Mr Wilson had shared with us, I learned, when he invited me to accompany him that night on one of his mysterious errands. As he did not see fit to share with me either his theory or the intent of our outing, I spent the evening in a state of nerves as he smoked his pipe on the sofa, refusing to partake of his supper. When he asked me to bring my revolver, I knew that he anticipated a run-in of an unusually dangerous kind. I had not had a drink in nearly 24 hours and the fatigue of the sleepless night was beginning to catch up with me. After dressing warmly for the night ahead and stashing my revolver in my greatcoat, I swiftly drained a medicinal draft of whiskey to settle my nerves and ensure that I should be ready to act swiftly, should any danger arise. Thus fortified, I felt ready to face whatever new surprises the night should bring.
“Forgive me for burdening you, my friend, but I did not know whether or not I could confide these details in Mr Holmes,” he said, with a quick sideways look when I made no response to his story. “I thought that you might be able to advise me in his stead.”
“What made you so sure?”
“What must we do?”
“Indeed,” I said at length, willing him to look at me. “What do you make of it, Holmes? Harrison’s behaviour seems most inexplicable. Why push Phelps into his sister’s arms and then try to tear him out of them? Why act as though he regretted their liaison and then speak of love? And what can he have intended by attempting to break into Phelps’ sickroom?”
“You saw a friend at the window and so you forced your way inside and broke down the door?” the man said incredulously. I could not fault his suspicion.
I laughed aloud and smoothed my cheek over his, feeling the catch of the first rough growth overlaying his warm skin.
I did not sleep much that night. My mind kept replaying the moment when Holmes had taken hold of Miss Adler's arm, drawing her close to him as imperiously as he sometimes did me, when he was about to begin kissing me or depriving me of my clothing. She was beautiful. She was intelligent. And she was not married. I had never imaged Holmes as a family man. Marriage did not seem an institution either fitting or desirable to a man of his temperament and talents. But Miss Adler seemed to have awoken something within him, the existence of which I had never suspected.
“What the fuck were you thinking?” John finally manages and Sherlock rewards him for successfully vocalising a whole sentence by actually answering.
My relief when a hansom drew up outside shortly after eight the next morning and I heard Holmes bounding up the stairs can scarcely be described. It was all I could do to restrain myself from running to him when I saw that his face was grim and his hand wrapped in a bandage. Knowing that he would not wish me to fuss over him, I forced myself to remain standing by the fireplace. It was Phelps, reclining weakly upon the sofa, who enquired as to the wound. Holmes brushed the matter aside and I could see from his movements that the injury was not hurting him excessively, so I contented myself with the thought that I would clean and dress it myself later.
It’s a brilliant case. Sherlock gets to do a night-time stake out and there’s a mad plastic surgeon with a poker and a paralytic designed to mimic the effects of snake venom. The bit with the snake doesn’t go quite as planned, admittedly. But in the end, Sherlock’s lying on the floor clutching the twin puncture marks on his ankle and groaning with pain that’s only partly feigned and John is crouching over him, fingers pressed to his throat so hard it hurts as he tries to take Sherlock’s pulse while speaking so frantically that Sherlock’s certain he can’t possibly be counting at the same time.
He sounded as lost as the little boy he had been when he had stumbled across his dying mother. Every instinct screamed for me to say something, to comfort him, to respond to his unprecedented confession with kindness. Afraid that my voice would break were I to attempt speech, like a coward I remained silent.
Holmes never took his eyes from her face as he accepted the proffered envelope and set it aside. Going over to his desk, he drew a small bag from the drawer and handed it to her. She smiled brilliantly at him as she made ready to quit the room.
“Thank you,” he said, softly. Then he turned to express his gratitude to me, his eyes shining in his thin face. Glowing with hope and new resolution, he reminded me of the boy I had once known and I had a sudden premonition of how he would look on his wedding day, once again healthy and happy, as he pledged himself to the woman he loved.
“Drink that and then call Lestrade,” John says, as he picks up the thriller he’s left on the arm of his chair, its splayed pages putting unacceptable strain on the spine. Sherlock would remind him what an abominable way that is to treat a book were the novel not complete drivel. Unworthy of the paper it’s written on. Detective novels. How can John stand to read them? And why does Sherlock find his interest in them strangely appealing?
His words, combined with his touch, were threatening to end matters more precipitously than I wished. Unwilling to waste this rare and precious chance to be with him outside the well-secured confines of a locked room, I grasped him by the wrist, stilling his hand where it was still wrapped around both our lengths.
John had stepped out of the shower and gotten dressed before picking a chair by the television, wringing his hands together nervously as distant eyes stared at Sherlock’s shoes. He opened and closed his mouth, trying to find the words to describe his relationship with Sam Fraiser, an American born Staff Sergeant. But Sherlock spoke first, hands folded in his lap as he looked at the man across from him. “You loved him.” He said quietly, eyes landing on the duffel bag next to the door where the tags lay hidden.
"Like help a group of vigilantes escape into the night while the cops are chasing them?" Mycroft asked with a short burst of laughter, a hand pressed over his chest. Sherlock looked away and down to the floor as he cursed under his breath. The blush never fading from his cheeks.
Sherlock blushed furiously as he saw the Captain's entire face, God he was... Handsome. Even with an unkempt beard and a thin layer of dirt on his face, the Captain was, oh God he was stunning. John looked up as he sipped his tea, noticing the expression on Sherlock's face.
"Possibly, I have a very nosey brother. But if you are to dress in a disguise and arrive at my place, my brother may just assume you are a client with a late-night case for me."
After the Captain's late-night announcement, he goes to 221B to stay for a few nights.
"What?" John asked, looking behind himself and then back at the Detective. "What's the matter?" Sherlock looked away, his blushing only worsening.
Sally's face dropped, she looked defeated. "How on Earth do you expect us to do that? This bastard won't talk for anything and you know it!" She said with an irritated growl, dropping her arms to her side as a car door shut quietly behind her.
The announcement aired at midnight over everyone's television in London, England. "Tonight I would like to make an announcement, one that none of you would expect to hear from me, I am sure." John started, a smile on his face below the mask he wore to hide his identity. "I am going to be taking three days off to work on my health." He stated. "I am not sure if the camera is picking it up, but I am wheezing quite a fair bit." He held up his hand as if to calm everyone's nerves, the smile never leaving his face. "Don't worry about me, I am sure that is nothing but the cold air getting to me. As for the patients that I see on regular nights and days, my platoon will be checking in on you along with some help that I have... Let's say hired. They will be coming around with medicine, blankets and food for all of you. You will not go without in my absence, I have made sure of that. As for the criminals in London, do not think for one moment that this means you are safe. You aren't, you will never be safe working within London. My team is still out there looking for you and they will stop you." He said seriously, that trademark smile fading into a serious scowl. He raised his head then, nodding towards the camera to an unknown individual that was operating it. The feed clicked off after the brief words of the Captain, everyone's reflections staring back at them from their television screens.
“Because I did not want you there,” he snarled suddenly, as vicious as I had ever heard him. “I did not want you, and you knew I did not want you, and yet you insisted on following me. Your constant need to accompany me everywhere I go is beginning to pall, Watson.”
John says it again when Sherlock is almost too far gone to hear him, his head thrown back, mind carefully focused on nothing but the slow drag of John around him. John is above him, rocking gently, looking down at Sherlock’s face, hands tangled in his hair, and he whispers it again and again as he moves, sending ripples of pleasure through Sherlock’s body until the sound of John’s voice and the feel of him become one and Sherlock gasps and bucks upwards into John’s warmth. The sharp bolt of pain as his stiches tighten and pull only seems to intensify his orgasm as he comes in great spasms that shake his whole body. John keeps murmuring as the hand he’s using to stroke himself speeds up. His words muddle up and jumble together until all Sherlock can make out is “love” and his own name as John clenches hard around Sherlock's softening cock and comes with a groan that sounds as much like pain as pleasure, striping warm semen across Sherlock’s bare chest.
“If you believe us not to have been equals it is because you are the one who creates a distinction,” Holmes spat. I saw with satisfaction that I had at last broken his unnatural calm. His face was flushed, and his hands, always so certain, betrayed a faint tremor. I looked away, unable to stomach seeing his splintered nails and his long, pale fingers torn and stained with drying blood.
“Thank you, Dr Watson,” she said. “I have heard of you from Miss Morstan, who told me of the help that you and Mr Holmes were able to provide in the case of her missing father. I see now that you are just as kind as she said.”
Holmes was standing by the fireplace, still in his frock coat and hat. He was staring at me as if I were a stranger.
It was several hours later that Holmes, as clean and well-fed as I had ever seen him, slid onto the sofa, where I sat staring pensively at the fire. His hair was combed straight back over his regal forehead and he was wrapped in his familiar soft blue dressing gown.
“I was thinking it would probably be better to catch him before he killed someone else.”
“Ready to go?”
Lestrade coughed and continued.
“Wake up, you idiot!” my voice was shaking. “Tell me how much you took. You could have killed yourself. You still might, if you do not wake up and tell me exactly what was in that syringe.”
“Are you saying you did not wish to be undressed?” Holmes inquired silkily. “I don’t recall you objecting. In fact, I seem to remember you attempting to tear my shirt off my body. I do not know how I will ever find all the buttons.”
“I’m glad that my total incompetence has proved so fruitful,” I hissed, sliding out from under his weight and, somewhat childishly, turning my back on him. “Now return to your own room, wherever that may be, would you not? I believe I have succumbed to your manipulations enough for one week and I have an early train to catch.”
“No doubt the man who wrote it has an enviable imagination,” I responded, “but you can hardly credit his assertion that he is able to read minds and uncover secrets with the power of his eyes alone. His theories are all very well, but I should like to see him put them into action.”
“And who is this Doctor John Watson?”
Back at Baker Street, Holmes had retired immediately to his bedroom. When he came out, he was dressed more smartly than was habitual. He left the flat immediately and did not come back until very late that night. I had already given up and retired when I heard his tread on the stairs below. Sometime later, I heard the mournful strains of his violin. I knew from the sound that attempting conversation would be futile. He was still playing when I fell into a fitful sleep and when I awoke, some hours later, drenched in sweat and shaking, my throat hoarse from shouting. If the nightmare had been as loud as I feared, he must have heard me. I lay stiffly for some minutes, listening for his tread on the stairs, but it never came. In the days since, he had spent much of his time from home, returning only sporadically to eat or sleep. I did not know if he had a case, for he had barely spoken two words to me, and I found myself loathe to begin a conversation that he so evidently wished to avoid. Prior to our bitter argument he had rarely spent time away from his books and experiments during daylight hours. Even at night, he often forewent sleep altogether or dozed fitfully on the sofa or in his chair, ready to spring into action should a case beckon. Now he spent what few hours he passed at Baker Street shut away.
John thought in question.
“No, he is the British Government,” Sherlock repeated. John just continued to look confused.
“It's a start!”
“Did you tell Lestrade about a Moriarty though?”
“Of the body. You're a medical man,” Sherlock responded. Lestrade looked at Sherlock sharply.
John contemplated.
, John thought in wonder.
Sherlock felt a presence in his mind and when he felt anger and fear that wasn’t his, well, he knew John knew that situation he was currently in.
“No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is,” Sherlock waved him off. “Now, look. Do you see what's missing?”
“Okay,” John said and looked at Sherlock, who was still sending texts to his client. “Well, I could enter Sherlock’s mind.” Both men’s eyes widened at that.
“Jennifer Wilson's only daughter,” Lestrade answered. Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion at the answer and said, “Her daughter? Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?”
*****
Sherlock thought seriously. His eyes were intense and heated. John’s heart speeds up. Warmth started to spread all over his body as he smiled adoringly at the man.
“Text, yes. The number on my desk,” Sherlock repeated as he turned to face John with an annoyed look on his face. That’s when he noticed John looking out the window. “What's wrong?” He asked John, concerned.
“I-I don’t understand,” she stuttered.
“I didn't order a taxi. Go away,” Sherlock said, as he waved a hand at her dismissively. Mrs. Hudson didn’t appear to be offended and just looked around the flat.
“There was no hurry,” Sherlock answered indifferently, seemingly oblivious of John’s disbelief. John sighed and handed the man his phone.
“I’m afraid that’s confidential information, brother dear,”
“Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper,” Sherlock said and John sighed in defeat but couldn’t help feeling proud that Sherlock acknowledges his skills.
“Oh, thank you,” the man said. John had to marvel at how deep and baritone the man’s voice is.
“As they go,”
, John thought dejectedly,
Disclaimer: I don’t own Sherlock.
“You don't seem very afraid,” the man stated.
“But sir-,” Donovan tried to protest. Lestrade put up his hand to stop her protests.
“Sherlock!” the man greeted happily, shaking Sherlock’s hand with enthusiasm. Sherlock returned the sentiment with a small smile on his face as he shakes the man’s hand.
“What point?” John asked, interested.
John thought to Sherlock. The consulting detective frowned deeper.
“What do you mean?” John asked Lestrade, who had a knowing look on his face.
“Yeah. I pickpocket him when he's annoying. You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat,” Sherlock stated indifferently. John looked at him funny.
, Sherlock thought curiously. He took that tape and walked towards the telly and turned it on. He placed the tape in the player and sat down on the sofa. The video played and Sherlock was stunned. The tape was a compilation of all the deductions Sherlock told John and John’s reactions to them. Sherlock stopped the video and stood up.
“Because you're not a wealthy man,” the man replied.
Warm hands started stroking Sherlock’s back and a soft humming sound reached his ears.
“I thought we will be needing two bedrooms,” John said.
“Oh come on, John, I know you’re smarter than that!” Sherlock exclaimed exasperated as he listened to John’s thoughts.
“I am clean!” Sherlock cried out in frustration. John’s heart throbs at the detective’s discomfort. He hates it. He hates seeing Sherlock like this.
“Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?” the man asked again impatiently as he looked up at John.
“But how come I’ve never heard of him?” John asked. Sherlock raised an eyebrow expectantly. John frowned before his eyes widened.
“Oh, don't pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that,” the man said dismissively. John had a feeling the bloke was going to be embarrassed real soon.
“What else?” John asked out loud. Sherlock chuckled before saying, “I’m curious as to what our bond can do. A gold color bond does happen only once every century.”
“Harry Watson, clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man's gadget. Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who's Clara? Three kisses say it's a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says soul mate, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently, this model's only six months old. Trouble in paradise then – six months on he's just given it away. If she'd left him, he would have kept it. People do. Sentiment, but no, he wanted to get rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You're looking for cheap accommodation, but you're not going to your brother for help. That says you've got problems with him. Maybe you liked his soul mate; maybe you don't like his drinking,” Sherlock further explained.
“People don't have arch-enemies,” John said quietly as his meal arrived, unsure about how to start the conversation. Sherlock turned to face him.
Sherlock thought in despair as he was overwhelmed by the feelings and memories.
“I agree with you, John. I also think Sherlock is brilliant. I just find him difficult to deal with sometimes due to all his quirks and eccentricities. I also agree that Donovan doesn’t have the right to call him names,” Lestrade said. Donovan looked at the DI sharply. Lestrade just looked right back at her. “I told you numerous times not to call Sherlock a freak-you and Anderson both. The next time I hear either of you insult Sherlock again without any provocation from the man; I’ll suspend you.” The detective inspector finished firmly.
“Just a minute!” Kaitlyn called, turning her attention back to the men below her. “Sherlock come on. It will be okay, I promise. Just take my hands and we will get you back home, okay?”
"You will need to know where he is first."  She said with a smile as they walked, the landlady stepped aside as she opened her door and let the Detective in. "You aren't the only Detective in London tonight, have you checked 'the' Twitter, darling? People are looking out their windows and are on the streets looking to meet this man, they've nicknamed him 'London's Batman'. Look." She turned her laptop towards the Detective, the feed with the hashtag 'The Captain' was going crazy. Tweet after tweet was coming in of mostly nonsense and false sightings, London was throwing Scotland Yard off this man's tail. Some were dressed in camouflage and face masks, just as the Captain been wearing tonight. It made Sherlock smile. Brilliant.
"You should go through and type them out on the computer, it would be much easier to file them and sort them under categories. Though it is always good to have paper documents, you can take them to court when a suspect you bring in goes to jail." John said happily, rubbing his chilled hands together. Sherlock nodded, that would make things much easier. Suddenly there was a whimper from John's duffel bag, making the Captain gasp lightly. "I'm sorry little guy! Did you want to meet Sherlock and Mrs.Hudson too?" He asked, setting down his canvas bag and unzipping it. Sherlock tilted his head, curiosity washing over him.
"This is Gladstone!" John beamed, cuddling the puppy close and blowing warm air against the puppy's fur and little ears. "I have been training him as a military service animal, he is such a good boy. He knows so many commands already!" Sherlock blinked, he had never seen the Captain with the puppy before on the live stream. This must be a new addition. "Is it alright that I have him here? I forgot to mention him to you at The Hub, I found him in a box outside of a grocery store in the cold. I couldn't just leave him there to freeze to death, I brought him a few tins of dog food as well. He has been staying with Staff Sargent Briars while I work."
“It’s alright Briars, it is always to be safe than sorry.” John said with a smile, rubbing Sherlock’s knuckle with his thumb gently. “I hope that this new information doesn’t upset you but…” John sighed, a smile on his face as he looked to the ground. “I am going to be moving in with Sherlock and passing off the mantle to you and Hughes. I think it is time that I leave the platoon and go help Bart’s hospital where my surgical skill will be put to good use.”
He was busy, he was always busy. He walked down alleyways and through the shadiest areas of London looking for anyone that needed medical attention. He wore a black surgical mask and civilian clothes to blend in better, especially after the day before. Cops were out looking for him, they were on his tail, looking for him like he was some wild animal loose in the city. He shook his head and smiled, he was just a man, a man who wanted to help others. That was the reason he became a doctor and joined the military, to help people. That's where his heart belonged. This is where he belonged.
“Yes you can.” John reassured him. “For me.”
Sherlock nodded, exhaling softly, thankful that he was not cheating with the Captain but now focused on what Colonel Moran may pull. “It seems I will be competing with a stalker of sorts.” He winked, making John and Kaitlyn laugh.
"I get that a lot." Sherlock admitted, rubbing his shoulder as John ate his meal and drank his tea.
Sherlock went to speak, to say something to shut Mycroft up, but Lestrade opened the door to the interrogation room. A look of surprise on his face. "Mycroft, someone is here to pay Sherlock's bail."
"I am already here, join me when you are ready."
Sherlock was out of breath as he exited the alleyway of Rupert Court and onto Wardour Street, his curls plastered to the sides of his head despite the cold December air chilling him to the bones. He leaned against Hung's Chinese Restaurant as he tried to fix his ringlets and waves with his fingers, huffing to himself about needing to work on cardio. That's when he heard several loud thuds followed by shouting, he looked to his right towards the gate that connected the streets Wardour and Lisle. "Fucking move! Get out of here!" Came the familiar voice of the Captain, the silhouette of a short, but stocky man standing before the gate. "Alpha go right! Tango go left! Split up! Go!" He yelled, standing still in the middle of Wardour as the sounds of sirens moved in.
"Apologise about the mess, those are from previous cases. I like to keep them around as notes, I don't exactly have anywhere to keep them at the moment." Sherlock mumbled, suddenly becoming very self-conscious about the state of his flat. But John shook his head, smiling at Sherlock.
"Soho! He is in Soho!" Sherlock yelled as he went to dash out the door again, leaving Mrs.Hudson standing there as he took off on foot towards Soho. "He is near the Chinatown Gate!" He screamed to himself in his excitement, not knowing Mycroft was watching him on the CCTV.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, huffing as he rested his hands on the table. The metal from the handcuffs rattled lightly against the metal. "I just believe that this Captain is doing a better job at serving London than Scotland Yard ever has. Hell, he is doing a better job than I ever have. I may solve peoples' murders, but he is saving their lives." Sherlock said seriously, leaning back in his chair as he looked at his brother. Mycroft looked confused at first, then his eyes widened, a smile spreading across his face.
Sherlock chucked. "Let Scotland Yard deal with it for a few nights, you need to recover. I am sure they can handle London for three days." Sherlock said as he stood from the table, John had finished his meal. He offered his hand to the man once more. "It was nice meeting you, Captain Watson."
“I don’t have a mobile.” Kaitlyn said as Hughes kneeled to raise her into the vent. “Can you pass your badge in through the opening?” She pleaded with a worried tone.
Sherlock nodded slowly, examining the photograph passed to him carefully. The person in the picture was admittedly stunning, long blonde hair, fair skin, and deep blue eyes. A kiss of a tan from the Afghanistan sun that only made their blue eyes more magnificent. “You all reconnected as adults?” The Detective asked as he passed the phone back, John stared longingly at the photograph for a moment before closing his phone.
Sherlock went to speak, but for once in his life, he couldn't find the words to express the emotions he was feeling. "Sick? No." He muttered to himself, squinting down at his hand that was held gently by his landlady. "When we shook hands, the Captain and I, I felt something. Energy, like electricity." He whispered, head cocking to the side as he tried to turn inward and study himself. "Like I was greeting an old friend, a friend that I have known my whole life. A friend that I..." He stopped himself, the words leaving his lips in a soft exhale.
