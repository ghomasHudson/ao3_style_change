Sherlock gasped, struggling, writhing for air, his curls sloshing this way and that but John held him down by his wrists with alpha strength. Sherlock somehow pulled his left wrist free, and John realized his entire left arm was useless, and it hit him like a tonne of bricks. He'd been shot. The fire raged above them, and it was an inhuman choice- to drown or to burn.
"MYCROFT! MUMMY! PLEASE! SOMEBODY HELP ME!" He pound weakly against the door, screaming at the top of his tiny lungs, tears pouring down his face at the sheer
"Something's wrong with you, Holmes, tell me." The Commander said, her voice still solid and unyielding, and her shoulders broad. Sherlock swallowed and looked up, her eyes were soft and her jaw was firm.
"I'm coming in, Sherlock," Martin wasn't very strong- elderly, and an omega, but the scent of an omega child in distress filled him with strength as he shoved his weight onto the door, the lock snapping and the door swinging open on it's hinges. The sight that awaited him was sickening, and Martin gagged at the crimson blood that covered Sherlock from the waist down. The scissors slipped from Sherlock's fingers, clanking against the porcelain, dripping with blood. Martin rushed to his side, eyes wide and unbelieving as he took Sherlock's pulse. Weak, but there. The scissors, the blood, the mirror, it wasn't hard to deduce what Sherlock had tried to do. Martin pulled him from the tub, bridal style, calling for help before looking down at the unconscious child in his arms. He tucked a stray curl behind Sherlock's ears, tears running down the older omega's cheeks.
"Holmes, fear makes us do strange things, things we don't want to do, things we would never do otherwise." She said firmly, squeezing his shoulders, "You were afraid. Janine could've done the same thing,"
"Shh, shh, it's alright, darling, I'm right here," Greg whispered, bouncing her on his hip. Nanny had thursdays off, not that Greg minded. She wasn't nearly as much of a troublemaker as the criminal classes of London. Emelia wailed, her face a deep flush of red, cheeks streaked with tear tracks and snot dribbling down her chin. Greg's head was splitting, skin a dull grey and thick bags under his eyes.
“Why would I do that? You’re not rotten, darling,” Sherlock was so upset the change in John’s voice went over his head, but John was feeling terribly guilty. He hadn’t really thought this through- of course Sherlock was scared! Some drunken officer flirting with him, what was John thinking leaving him alone? John cursed himself for getting angry, for letting Sherlock believe that he might hurt him, or leave him. What kind of daddy was he? He bent down and planted a kiss on his baby boy's curly mop. “You’re not rotten at all.”
His emergency kit. He rustled through the inside pocket and pulled out his syringe, along with the small glass vial he'd set aside for this. Dear God, he hoped it would work, he'd snatched it from Mycroft's medicine cabinet. What Mycroft would want with an omega tranquilizer, Sherlock did not want to know. He slipped it into his pocket and closed the case, replacing it and pulling closed the floor board. He wondered if he'd ever see it again.
"You- you have to get the bullet out, Sherl," John mumbled, eyes blinking as he came into consciousness again and Sherlock swallowed.
He shared a look with the lanky omega, who seemed to acknowledge the truce that it was. Sherlock dropped his hand and went to the decanter to pour himself something. Mummy tutted disapprovingly but Mycroft gave her a sharp glare. A little alcohol might cool Sherlock off a bit.
"But, if I am, I want it, I want this, because," Sherlock furrowed his brows, unsure of what to say, the words tripping up inside of his chest. He sucked in a breath and collapsed his head into John's shoulder. "because you want it, and I love you."
For some god forsaken reason, the thought made his tummy flutter, and he pulled his bottom lip between his teeth nervously. It was not quite evening, and golden sun shone through the tall windows, casting big square shapes of light on the floor of the party. Somebody had put flowers and banners everywhere, which was strange. Dying plant carcasses had a rather macabre form of beauty, he supposed, but he doubted that's how most people saw it. Sherlock didn't know most of these people, and he kept his eyes down. He didn't want to know them. He didn't want to speak to any of them, these people who were celebrating his shame.
"The cabinet office is going to pledge our support of Poland tomorrow, if Germany should attempt their sovereignty, we will be at war." Mycroft stated, bringing his cigar to his lips and pulling in a puff, coughing a bit through his nose.
the only one, I was wrong and- I let myself forget how special you are, and how lucky I am to have you,"
Sherlock nervously stood in the washroom, staring at his reflection, fidgeting nervously. He was, quite naked, save for his knickers and the red strappy harness that dug lightly into his chest, back and around his thighs. Around his neck was a matching red collar lined with silver jingle bells. His wrists and ankles had red leather cuffs as well, each with a silver bell. His hair was fluffy and his curls fell in loose ringlets of chocolate around his forehead. He slipped on the antler headband and blushed. He turned a bit, looking at his own arse, and the fluffy white tail attached to his harness right above it. He eyed the door nervously before fishing his eyeliner pencil, mascara and the tiny tin of blush from the bathroom cabinet. He applied the mascara carefully, he was likely to poke his eye out with all this shivering. He popped the cap off the eyeliner and drew on some freckles on his cheeks, flushing with embarrassment at his own childishness. He glanced down at the rouge and looked himself in the eyes. Fuck it. He could do to have a little bit more fun. It
"Careful you don't fill out, Sherlock, we have a few parties to attend in London next month, and you'll want to be thin." Mummy chided from across the table and Sherlock flushed. He looked down at himself- he wasn't fat, was he? He grit his teeth and put his toast down again, crossing his arms and looking over at Mycroft before grabbing part of the paper. Mummy rubbed her temples and Mycroft gave him a look. Screw them! Sherlock thumbed it open and began to read intently. It wasn't that he was interested at all with growing tensions in Poland, or the expansion of the Japanese Empire, or who was prime minister or any of it. Just the simple rebellion of reading the paper like an Alpha was enough.
“Good morning, Sweetheart,” Sherlock’s nose scrunched sillily at the name before he came to rest at John’s feet, already finding it his favourite place to be. John chuckled and ruffled his hair. “Sleep good?”
"Nothing to be sorry for," John smiled, breathing in deep gulps of the omega's tantalizingly lovely smell, honey and mint, with hints of sweet ripe blackberries. Sherlock hiccuped, flushing bright red, feeling quite silly being held like this. John's strong, rough hands were delicately carding through Sherlock's hair. "I'm here now, aren't I?"
John Watson's left hand was steady as he buttoned his jacket, pulling his belt around and buckling it tight around his stomach. He smiled at Sherlock, who knelt at his feet and helped him into his boots. He didn't have to do it, he just did. John pressed a kiss to his forehead when he stood, the omega's nose pressed into his neck, reaching up and wrapping his arms around his shoulders and holding tight, as if John might vaporize in any moment.
and in the fear of God. Into this holy estate these persons present now come to be joined. Who gives this child to be married?"
Sherlock grumbled, hiding his head under the covers. The door creaked open anyways, and his brother stepped across the room, not even mentioning the mess of papers and the microscope which sat proudly on his desk. The alpha paused, admiring the little tuft of midnight curls that poked out from beneath the covers, before sitting on the side of the bed, reaching out to pet it, but stopping himself and placing his hand on his thigh.
thank you for reading! I promise there is more on the way!! Comments and suggestions are always appreciated <3
"Just a minute daddy!" Sherlock quickly popped open the tin and rubbed a finger of the red makeup on his nose. He giggled at his reflection, wiggled his tail a bit before dashing out the door and into the hall, standing quite literally like a deer in headlights, daddy sitting powerfully before him in his armchair, sipping his drink, clad in his white dress shirt, dinner jacket and bow-tie quite forgotten. Something soft and Christmas-y was on the record player and the fireplace crackled. Daddy's eyes raked over him, licking his lips and widening his eyes.
Daddy’s eyes flashed genuine concern, his hands clasping around Sherlock's bony wrists, pulling his fist away from his head.
"I sent you something, I thought it would be there by now," Sherlock's eyes widened and he grabbed the base of the phone in one hand, tucking the handle under his chin and yanking the cord attached to the wall, dragging the phone into the corridor and looking by the door.
Sherlock growled, suddenly quite angry with the pale blue floral wall paper, with it's feminine cornflower pattern.
"Do you want me to bring up some dinner for you, later, or maybe some tablets to help with the pain? I've got a sister." Sherlock shook his head dramatically, horribly drunk, and collapsed as soon as they were at the top of the stairs. "Oh my, alright," Greg scooped him up and carried him the rest of the way, stopping and biting his lip at the black metal door and deadbolt.
"Feeling warmer, darling?" John grinned and wrapped their arms together, putting his hat on. Sherlock squinted his eyes and scrunched up his face.
Sherlock did, in fact, wait up. His microscope had found it's new place on the kitchen bench, and Sherlock found his place behind it. He had a...
, a completely useless defense against a line of German tanks, and it was appalling the damage being done. Warsaw still fought back, but it wouldn't last long, the only unoccupied city in Poland, with the Germans to the west and the Soviets to the east...
"I've sent Mrs. Hudson to her sisters'," John smiled, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's cheek, a flutter in his heart at the sweet virgin smell of his neck, lapping his tongue at his scent gland. Sherlock shivered, standing straight and still. John squeezed his waist and pulled away, stepping off the kerb and loading the cases into the boot of the car.
They say that omegas have the best sense of smell. Sherlock could definitely smell something different about Esther. He sniffed the air, eyeing her suspiciously as she tugged the comb through his sensitive strands.
“Daddy!” Sherlock squealed and blushed feverishly, wrapping hands around to cover his backside, “what’re we gonna do today daddy?” He bit his lip and looked up at John innocently.
He picked up the pace to a punishing speed, his Alpha completely at the wheel as he rut, pummeling the weak and trembling omega. Each thrust sent Sherlock's head backwards, drunk and bleary with his needs.
"I don't sleep with much regularity so I couldn't make a fair analysis," Sherlock mumbled and John laughed, warm and low and deep and it sent Sherlock's heart into a dizzying race.
“S-sussex,” John hmmed appreciatively and patted Sherlock’s cheek, planting a chaste kiss on his lips. Sherlock whimpered as a length of rope was placed just below his shoulders, John tying his arms to his sides, forming a pattern up his back, more lines criss-crossing across his chest, all tied into a fulcrum at his wrists, his hands forced together tight. He squirmed, his torso completely immobilized, and he was shocked that it felt so good. To be so not in control, to know that he could not move, that John was watching him intently, admiring his handiwork. Soon John’s muscled hands began to trace along the lines of dark silk rope, checking Sherlock’s circulation and testing the tightness of each knot. Sherlock let out a breathy keen, John gently brushing through his hair.
“Alright, Sherlock, I’ll, I’ll think about it,” The idea of collaring his flatmate and best friend was still uneasy on his stomach. Sherlock was so desperate, vulnerable, it shook John to the core. That such a beautiful and enigmatic creature would wish to submit to him, it was strange and dreamlike. John continued to pet Sherlock’s hair, fingers grazing against his nape. “Why don’t you make us some tea, alright Sherlock?” The taller man nodded furiously and scampered to the kitchen. John sighed and scrubbed his face. Not that it wasn’t unwanted. Hell, Sherlock was more than
"Sherlock, you're alright," John said firmly as Sherlock trembled, reaching out to take his omega's hand, "I'm here, love, and nothing bad can happen when I'm here."
"Come on ladies, it's time to go," Moran smiled at Sherlock and Janine, and the omega stood, Sherlock pulling up his knee socks as their unit followed him, a silent march along the beach to the pier, which was almost enitrely destroyed, but still manageable. Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed deep the salty air, the wood creaking beneath their feet as they stepped over gaping holes in the wood, blood stains on the white paint just barely visable in the twilight. Sherlock flinched, the hum and unmusical remainder of metal and pipes filling his ears, pressing crescent shaped marks into his fists. Janine looked up and smiled.
“I might just actually.” He looked up once more into those cosmic silver eyes. A thousand tiny colors never seen before. Marty rubbed his head against Stephen’s legs and they both looked down and laughed as he wrapped his tail around both their calves.
John laughed, eyebrows raised and his lips turned into a smile. Sherlock only turned a deeper shade of crimson, tucking his hair behind his ears as John stood, his chair squeaking along the polished floor. Greg and John shook hands before John pulled the detective in for a hug.
"Well go on then," Sherlock's tongue went numb and his stomach felt tight and fuzzy and tumbly and so many other horrid things as he carefully tore open the paper, the box smelling so wonderfully of John. He gasped, pulling off the lid and revealing the contents.
"So the King is dead, that's new," Sherlock said absently, sipping his tea. Mycroft sighed and Mummy laughed.
"Oh, you would if you were married to her. Jesus Christ, she's horrible. I don't see why you're doing this, it's
"Sherlock, are you alright?" Greg asked worriedly, holding a somehow even paler Sherlock by the shoulder. The omega's eyes refocused and he looked up nodding slowly. Greg pat his arm and gave him a smile, pulling a white silk shirt over his shoulders, buttoning it down the front.
"We're coming, lad," Came the sweet older voice, "Willie, throw him the rope!" Sherlock gasped as a rope landed beside him, pulling into his hands before tying it around John's middle with a precise and practised knot. The unconscious alpha groaned and Sherlock beamed, holding on to the rope as they were pulled to safety.
"Right," He tucked his hands into his pockets, suddenly very aware of the silver band on his third finger. "Are you on triage as well, Nurse...?" He smirked, eyes glittering.
"Seasick, Captain?" Came a feminine voice and John's eyes looked to the blonde, sweet looking nurse that stood not so far away in her pressed white uniform and cap, her feet crossed as she smiled.
"How'd you get the mud so thick?" She cried, scrubbing intensely, the brown dirt chipping off of and revealing the chocolately black below.
"Sherlock you've got to let go of me," The doctor whispered, reaching with his good hand to wipe the petrol from Sherlock's beautiful cheekbones, and to let his fingers touch his petal skin once more. Sherlock's eyes were a brilliant pale ice as he panted, leg muscles quivering at the exertion.
"A-tention," Sherlock sucked in a breath through his nose and turned, finding his place in the row and looking ahead, his eyes glassy. The commander gave them all a rough nod before placing her hands behind her back. "I know you probably didn't expect to lose sisters in combat, and I doubt anyone can be prepared for it, but you have to move on."
"Now, My, please, don't say anything you don't mean," Greg said softly, placing a gentle hand on his arm, eyes wide and soothing. Mycroft huffed and shoved Greg off, glaring at his little brother.
"You have to relax, love, just let go and trust me, I won't let you drown," John soothed into his ear as he tread water, holding the both of them upright in the water.
“Ross! Hurry up, she’ll be here soon!” Shuri grabbed his sleeve and pulled him in. He was barely looked at by most of the guests, who he assumed were Wakandan officials, and he was slightly jealous of how fashionable everyone was. Color, texture, afro-futrism, it was a feast for the eyes and his plain bespoke suit felt quite un-fashionable in comparison. She grabbed his present and tossed it on a pile. There were beautiful floral decorations everywhere, and a spread of the most delicious food Ross had ever seen. “No cake?”
Sherlock scrunched his nose at his own predictability before the footfalls of an angry Mycroft could be heard down the corridor, and Sherlock hunched back in a vain attempt to not be seen.
"I shave everyday." John smiled, splashing his face with water and toweling off. He patted himself with aftershave and Sherlock's nose went crazy, sniffing the air to understand the strong scent. Sherlock reached out hesitantly, and the Alpha seemed to understand, offering his face forward for Sherlock to examine.
Sherlock shook his head and headed downstairs. The man waiting for him was a god. Blonde hair and tanned skin and kind eyes, and underneath the layer of clothes Sherlock deduced he was strong. Really strong. He blushed when they made eye contact and he stammered out, “Hi,”
"I want to speak with you, Sherlock," Mycroft's voice was, wrong, all wrong. Soft and weak and almost pleading. Pleading with
indicated the fountain pen had been held by someone left-handed. That was a bit rare- most schools would make you use your right.
Greg's feet were solid ice as he sat in the presinct, hands folded on his desk, head drooping on is neck. What kind of father was he? What kind of parents were him and Mycroft? Sending Emmy away, when they should've been
Sherlock bit his knuckles, eyes closed, pressed into the corner of the washroom, ducked under the washbasin and curled into a ball. Sobs wracked through his body but he couldn't make any noise. He was so fucking weak.
He leaned his forehead against the window of the Rols, watching the people that blurred together in lines of color and skin and hair along the buildings and pavement. The car slowed to a stop at a traffic light and Sherlock watched with intense fascination as a group of schoolboys walked by, laughing and clapping shoulders and kicking a football beneath their feet. Sherlock crumpled in on himself, a deep horrific jealousy filling him to the brim, threatening to make him cry some more.
Sherlock clenched his fist, his fingers shaking horribly. It had been a week since the incident, but her face still haunted him every time he closed his eyes. She was hurting, she was alone. If only Sherlock wasn't so, whatever he was, if he wasn't broken, he could help. If he was an alpha, he could help. But he wasn't was he? He'd never be anything but this- weak and powerless creature that stared back at him as he stood in front of the washroom mirror, reminded of a certain time years ago and a pair of scissors. There was a knock.
Mycroft was left to the empty hallway, knuckles white as he gripped his umbrella's handle- feeling just a tiny sliver of what might have been regret, before shaking it off and turning back to his study. Long night's work would do him good- he could really get lost in it, and there was so much to be done these days.
John looked round in a potted plant on the step, pulling out a set of keys and opening the large white double doors. He pushed open the door, flicking on the lights and pulling Sherlock along into the empty dance hall, still stale from second-hand smoke and snuck-in booze. The floor was sprinkled with paper pieces, banners running along the ceiling.
"Alright...step back a bit, stand up straight," Sherlock instructed, looking intently into the viewfinder. "Salute!" John grinned and raised his hand. Sherlock snapped the photograph and looked up with a smile. John strode over, placing the camera on the vanity and pulling Sherlock into a kiss. It was warm and soft and wonderful and Sherlock whined as he pulled away.
Warm sunlight shone through the tall windows of their bedroom, cool whispers of spring sunlight billowing through the curtains and casting the bedroom in a sepia glow. John Watson was already awake. Quite so. Some things stayed the same, even when one was on leave. He took a deep, long breath, the sweet smell of his omega back once again. He smiled and turned his chin to look at the gangly ivory boy that lay atop his chest, floof of midnight curls splayed across John's golden skin, mouth slightly open as he slept. Face sweet and innocent, and John gently traced across his cheekbones, adoring the little flinches beneath his fingers as he slept. John could stay here, right here, forever, with
John sighed, checking his watch as he made his way up the pavement. Stamford hadn't minded him on the sofa, if only sharing some sort of sympathy, as if Sherlock had sent him to the dog house. His watch read 9:45. He approached the door, taking deep breaths, ready as he'd be to deal with a sulking and pouty omega after their fight.
"I'd say it gets easier but then I'd be lying," Sherlock nodded, smiling to himself as they walked, tucking his hand into his pocket, slipping on the ring that he kept there and feeling it- cool and silver and perfectly fit, with the initials
Why did it upset him? He'd never in his life wanted anything to do with himself, with the hateful, delicate flower of a thing that he was- who would want him like that? Who would expect him to be anything more than a bumbling little mother and bond mate, making breakfasts and scrubbing floors, looking the way he had before.
"It's Dr. Watson," Sherlock leapt to his feet, heart racing, cheeks flushing, before stopping. He paused, standing on his tip toes, counting to 1-2-3-4-5-oh screw it! He pushed open his door and came down the corridor, leaning over the rail and feigning indifference.
"a baby, John," Sherlock finished for him, sitting up and putting a hand on his stomach before realizing he'd done that, his hand snapping back to hold his knees, his throat filling with bile.
"Don't say that!" Sherlock gasped, flopping upwards and throwing a leg over John, palms on his chest and sweet little nose oh-so-close to John's, "It won't be a long while at all Jawn, it'll all be over soon, and then you can be a doctor and I can be a scientist and we can live here, together and we can forget this whole war. I don't fancy it, John.
"Sherlock, my father served in the war, he commanded an air squadron." John adjusted his collar, his throat tight at the thought of his father, with his horrible grey beard and that goddamn pipe.
“They aren’t for school, daddy, there was an anomaly in one of Molly’s  speci- wait, you- you mean a christmas tree?” He gasped. His eyes were saucers, brilliant and shimmering green. John chuckled, sitting back against the arm of his chair and Sherlock shuffled his papers about.
them tomorrow. NO. FUCKING. WAY. They have no right to ask!” Sherlock shouted angrily, curling in on himself and heaving the duvet over his head. John sighed and came over to sit by his side as Sherlock grit his teeth.
“Agent Ross!” Nakia said as she came up to him later in the party, looking hot and badass as ever, “It’s so good to see you!” She eyed Dr. Strange and they shared a look of some kind.
"Sherlock, I really don't like this, she's such a cute little thing," Mrs. Hudson cooed and booped the bunny's wriggling nose, speaking in a high pitched baby voice, "I'll go get you a carrot, sweetheart."
fought, you were brave. Braver than me, braver than any of us. If I wasn't-" Sherlock bit his lip and tucked his nose down, tears rushing down his cheeks. Jesus, why was he being so fucking emotional?
His husband was busily writing something, a letter, using a book as a table on his leg, scribbling with a fountain pen. John bit his lip at his tan shorts and blazer, his neat collar and tie, small cap resting on John's bedside table. His hair, once like waves of inky water, now cropped and neat beside his ears, still a complete floof. Different. Not bad, just, different.
John growled his affirmation and pushed to the hilt. Sherlock writhed as he found his prostate once again. John slowly began to buck his hips in and out, growling low and gripping tight bruises onto Sherlock's hips. Sherlock wept, desperately trying to hold onto his orgasm, rutting against the sheets. John grasped a handful of chocolaty locks and tugged sharply, his baser instincts growling and snarling.
"Shh," John mumbled into the soft warm skin, eyes inspecting every bony joint with care, as if he were memorizing it. He rubbed a firm circle into Sherlock's palm and looked over to his omega, eyes swirling blue like choppy sea. "We'll have them when we're ready, love, both of us."
"Ah," John pressed a second and third kiss to Sherlock's head. He knew the feeling. Every moment like this, ever milometer of smooth petal skin he could grasp was heaven. His aching, throbbing leg had dulled. "It might be a very long while again, darling,"
“N-no thank you, excuse me,” Sherlock stepped forward but the man put his other arm down and flashed a sly smile. Sherlock could feel his heart thumping in his chest, his palms sweating, and he swallowed. He tried to analyze the best plan but his mind was frozen. Frozen solid, even as the man leaned in and whispered, breath hot in his ears.
"Shh, Shh, darling, you're alright, daddy's here, sweet boy, that's it, just let it out," Daddy pulled him off the bench and onto his hip, Sherlock gripping onto his neck as he carried him to the armchair, sitting and pulling him onto his lap, their chests pressed together, Sherlock's knees on either side of John's thighs. Daddy carded through his hair some more and held him close, "tell me what's in that brilliant head of yours,"
"Yeah, Clara's the one who's horrible. Tell that to the bruises on her face. Fell down the stairs again, right?" John snarled, adjusting his tie for the tenth time. Harry growled in response, the two alpha's scents filling the room with conflict.
“Ah, praise-kink huh?” John chuckled and Sherlock looked down embarrassedly. “No shame in that, darling, it’s all fine.” John took a deep breath, stabilizing himself to continue. “Is that what you want Sherlock, to be
“It snowed again last night, daddy, I made a snowman on the roof!” John pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to cool off, not to overreact.
he was in a hallway, and being attacked by a pack of rabid animals. The Napoleon Complex was not new to him and hardly required any further evidence(*cough* JOHN!), but these compact cattle hearding beasts were the icing on the cake to shove down Mycroft's throat. A gaggle of corgis were assaulting him, one nipping at his heel, the other two tugging hard at the sheet wrapped around his waist. He stood barefoot on the plush, ornate carpet and this was really
"You're too beautiful to pull off the lie for long," He said nonchallantly, as if this were obvious and unimportant, "besides, what about your...time?" Sherlock almost rolled his eyes. Heat suppressants were older than synthetic insulin, most certainly never available for the public, but there were medical and professional exceptions.
Sherlock had presented- he dismissed this archaic biological explanation, pinning it to his subconscious deducing what his conscious mind could not. He turned to Mummy, swallowing and looking at her meaningfully. His little brother was an Omega. Meek, timid creatures which needed protection, guidance, affection. He grimaced, looking down at his feet and shoving hands in his pockets.
"Why's that?" John's brows furrowed, sipping his brandy. The party was over, Sherlock and Gregory had since gone up to bed, and the alphas were still smoking.
"Love, y'alright?" The words fuzzily echoed in his ringing ears and Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but he was frozen, his whole body was frozen, his mind sealed shut. "You can let go love, why don't we get you some tea?"
Greg really didn't like having her here in the morgue, dead mother and brother not ten metres away, but nobody in the precinct had volunteered for the job of babysitting, and besides, Greg was having the time of his life playing daddy. Her Alpha had been called, Mr. Smith, and he sounded almost like he didn't know he
But it was futile. John pulled him up onto his hip as he carried their things up the sand and up the path to the street. A french man was standing at the top leaning against a motorcar and smoking,  his nose twitched instantly as they approached and he put out his cigarette. Sherlock was still unbounded, virgin and fresh and delicious. The man was clearly a beta, and he pulled off his hat, eyes wide as John flashed his teeth in a possessive gesture, arm tightening around Sherlock.
Sherlock's lips turned slightly down, looking back to Janine and swallowing thickly, before three wretched words fell from his mouth.
How lucky he was, Mycroft had said, to be allowed to learn. Most Alphas would not be so lenient. Holding this glare was painful, his biology
"Young love, not much to be done I s'pose." Greg smirked, approaching his husband before wrapping his arms round his shoulders, pulling him in for a sloppy and well-practiced kiss.
“Yes, I’m sorry, I’m just really nervous. He’s taking me out tonight, I don’t want to disappoint him.” Grace cocked an eyebrow.
“Right.” Ross said slowly, crossing his arms and looking the man up and down. “Heard of me before then?”
"I only meant, if, something should go wrong, and he-" Sherlock bit his lip to stop it from quivering. His arms felt chilly, goose flesh all up his skin, his stomach clenched in a knot.
”What are you doing here?” Sherlock growled, still standing, glaring down at Mycroft. The Alpha flashed his teeth in a smile that sent shivers down Sherlock’s back.
speak of me that way. ever. again." He slapped his arse harsher, his own palm begining to sting something nasty. Sherlock shrieked, sobbing, trembling, his chest pressed tight against John's thigh. His eyes glistened with tears that spilt over down his cheeks, and John spanked him again and again, the sharp slaps echoing through the room. "Do I make myself clear?"
"Sherlock? Almost done?" Daddy called from the sitting room, and Sherlock dropped the tin in a fit of nervousness.
"Woah there, Sherlock, you're safe, you're alright, you can't move, love, you'll hurt yourself," He soothed, tucking his chin over Sherlock's head.
"Easy for you to say. You're not being sold tomorrow." Mycroft swallowed, hands clenching into fists. He opened his mouth to speak, but swallowed whatever it was he had intended to say, instead resting a hand on his brother's blanketed knee, still not looking at him.
Five minutes and forty seven seconds latter, Sherlock wiped the pencil dust from the paper and stood, his own chair making an equally horrific squeak, Turing's eyes immediately looking up.
"Martin, why am I dressed so funny?" Sherlock gaped at the valet with intense curiosity, gesturing to his quite girlish frilly outfit. "I look like I'm getting christened again." Martin bit his lip and pushed a golden ring onto Sherlock's finger, but it slipped off, bouncing off the floor and rolling under the bed. "I'll get it!" Sherlock dropped to his tummy and began to crawl before Martin could stop him.
"You're pregnant." Sherlock said obviously, looking at her in the mirror. She only blushed and smiled, nodding a bit, continuing her assault on his scalp. Sherlock winced as she pulled on a particularly troublesome knot.
blushing. Simply the cold weather, that's why his cheeks flushed with crimson and his heart beat faster than a train. He swallowed nervously and placed the card to the side, fingers resting on it's front, as if he were making sure it wouldn't disappear.
"We're going through!" Violet announced across the room, and the rest of the party headed through the door to the dining room. Sherlock looked away for a moment, and Greg watched as Victor poured a splash of a smaller bottle into his drink. He furrowed his brow and cocked his head a bit. Victor's beady eyes flicked over to Greg, and he moved to put the bottle in his coat pocket, but instead placed it back amongst the other decanted liquors. Greg shook his head. Seeing what he did all day, he was being paranoid. He followed Mycroft into the dining room, and Sherlock snatched his drink from Mr. Trevor.
“That’s a good boy, Sherlock,” Sherlock let his breath out, his whole body trembling with endorphins and oxytocin. He leaned his cheek against John’s knee. “You can wear my dog tags when we go out, alright pet?” Sherlock was slightly disappointed, the pride of being
Sherlock squeaked, cursing his bloody omega for his stupidity, and slowly made his way across the tiled floor, clicking open the lock and crawling back to his spot. John pushed open the door, almost gagging at the scent of an omega in distress- fear and anxiety that seeped into his skin. He felt like the worst man in the world. Sherlock refused to look at him, so John sat, back against the claw foot tub, hands clasped in front of his knees.
, I only had invited Mr. Trevor over last week," She paused and bit her lip, giving Mycroft a look, something secret passing between them. "Should I really cancel on him? After he's just come out of mourning his father?" Mycroft sighed, glancing at Sherlock quickly before shaking his head.
"Ready, love?" John smiled in the mirror and Sherlock nodded. They made their way out of the flat, hand in hand, fingers interlaced as they approached the pavement. John hailed a cab and they made their way to the train station, thighs touching subtly, John's hand clenched around his, rubbing a circle there every so often, as if his mind were wandering and finding it's focus once again on their interlocked fingers.
"He?" John scoffed, looking up from his patient. This was their fourth round of evacuees. He took in a deep breath and his heart sank in an instant, like a stone thrown into a lake. Through a tangle of limbs and uniforms he smelled it. Sweet blackberries and honey that filled his lungs as he took in a shaky breath. "
There was shouting on the other side of the door, and Sherlock nervously tapped on the door, clutching his papers tight, looking them over once again with an anxious turn of his stomach. The door swung open to reveal an alpha with cropped brown hair and an exasperated smile.
"I killed her," He whispered, just barely keeping himself from growling, "She- tried to get out but I kicked her and I- she's dead," He bit his lip after the shameful words were spoken, wishing with all his might he could beat himself bloody, he was so angry. Janine was his friend. One of his only friends. And now she was gone and it didn't make sense. He looked to the commander with worry. Would he be chastised, discharged, arrested? Isn't that what you did to murderers?
Alan's face wrinkled in distaste at this, and Sherlock's eyebrows raised, "Good for you, but surely you
"I want to learn everything, your routines, what products you use, do you wear makeup? Do you curl your hair? Do you prefer to bathe at night or in the morning, I must know every little thing about you. I find it all so very fascinating." John whispered into his ear, Sherlock's lips turned into a shy smile, meeting his dark blue eyes in the mirror.
"Esther, how did you get those marks?" Sherlock tucked Emilia's head into his neck, pointing to her wrists as she held the kettle under the tap. Her cheeks flushed, and she rolled down her sleeves, setting the kettle on the stove.
"And so you decided to fill my head with fanciful nonsense of an omega detective to make me feel better after someone drugged me and induced me into heat? Really, you're doing so well at this brother-in-law affair," Sherlock snapped bitterly.
Sherlock smiled, setting the letter down neatly on the floor before sneaking over to bed. The mattress screeched as he crawled atop it, after 4 straight days of, well, you know, the bed seemed to have broken somehow, and had become rather creaky. John's eyes fluttered open against the pillow, his mouth resting in a puddle of spit. He smiled at the icy eyes and midnight locks that stared down at him and he rolled over onto his back, quite chuffed with himself.
"But he said, he said if I didn't want to marry him-" Sherlock sniffled, lying on beneath his raging Alpha brother, whose pheromones were strong enough to knock him to the floor.
"Of course John, of course I will," Sherlock said quickly as the train's horn blared as it pulled up to the platform, a cloud of mist forming around their feet, filling the world with haze as John's eyes found his, two deep cavernous oceans that Sherlock was liable to lose himself in. His boyish grin faded for a moment and he whispered.
"I'm not tired, Mycroft!" Sherlock hissed, covering the mouthpiece of the phone, but Mycroft only raised his eyebrows and outstretched his hand. "I have to go, John, goodbye." Sherlock hung up, tossing the phone back into it's cradle, and shoving the whole thing towards Mycroft.
Sherlock bit his lip hard, flinching at each thud of John's feet down the stairs. The front door slammed shut, reverberating through the floor. Sherlock pulled his feet up onto the smooth leather, hugging his knees to his chest. He wasn't crying. He wasn't.
“We have matters to discuss and telling you here and now would only confuse you.” The Sorcerer Supreme held out a card, “177a Bleecker Street, tomorrow, 12 o’clock.”
"Thank you, Greggory, his heat room is just upstairs, down the hall and to the left, can't miss it." Greg nodded and lugged the delirious omega down the hall towards the stairs.
Esther Smith gripped tight to the pudgy hand of her son, her daughter securely on her hip. She shakily inhaled the night air, her hands shaking slightly. Arthur was passed out on the sofa, sated and drunk, but he wouldn't be asleep for long.
"I know what you mean," The beta said lightly, rubbing her palm across his shoulders. "You can always write to us, you know? We'll be here for you," She smiled, apple cheeks and golden hair like something from a fairy tale. Sherlock's lips turned upwards slightly, his pallor beginning to dissipate.
Sherlock’s heart stopped dead in its tracks and his eyes widened. A shiver crawled up his spine and he felt himself start to, um, harden, at the notion.
"Let's go see your uncle Sherlock, Goldie-locks," Greg smiled to the baby, who only gurgled nonsensically around her bottle.
7 oclock came so quickly. Sherlock had showered twice, fixed up his hair and even considered using the tube of mascara that was hiding in the bottom of his drawer. No, no, stupid Sherlock, stop being a girl. He dressed in his best shirt and trousers, carefully tying his dressiest shoes and rubbing his hands down his legs. Get it together Sherlock, get it together. His hands shook terribly, so he popped three little green pills and swallowed them dry. The buzzer rang and Calphurnia, Grace’s wife, opened the door to his room and gave him an encouraging nod. “Knock his socks off, Sherlock Holmes,”
John scrubbed his face and leaned on his knees. He was the Alpha, it was his right to punish Sherlock for this. Keeping the wife and pups in line was an Alpha's job. Right?
"I must warn you, the man on the spearhead of the project is, rather a queer sort, and won't work with you only on recommendation, with your merit still to prove.
going to visit you John." He said sternly, chaneling his inner-Mycroft. "And you are going to like it or lump it."
He pushed himself up and steadied, in his mind's eye remembering John's solider posture, squaring his shoulders and setting his jaw, feeling like a little boy again, with bloody scissors in the bottom of the bath.
Sherlock couldn't sleep. Not that he would want to. Not when he had...he paused and looked up at the clock...6 hours until he had to say goodbye. Sherlock wasn't sure what he was feeling, not that he ever was, but this was so foreign he could barely find the words. His tongue was heavy in his mouth, everything tasted foul, and his heart was racing every time he thought about it. He slowly sat up, the covers bunching at his knees as he pushed himself up and looked down at his Alpha.
"Sherl, what's wrong?" Janine knelt in front of him, giving the soldiers nearby them an apologetic toothy smile.
"I have to go." Sherlock said abruptly, turning away and sprinting down the corridor, face still burning hot with embarrassment and oh dear god, some other unearthly feeling he could not describe. Suddenly, strong tan fingers grasped his hand as he left, pulling him back. Sherlock's eyes went wide and he tried to tug away, before this baser creature inside him did anything stupid. The Alpha's sweet aroma made him wobbly, and he made only meek attempts to escape as a second hand came back to rest on his chin, turning his head to the side once more.
“N-never, never got to pick a tree before daddy,” He whispered dolefully, his heart achingly heavy in his chest. Christmas meant a stuffy posh outfit and church and mummy and daddy fighting and he always ended up alone in his room, presents opened and tucked into his closet by the maid. He whimpered and John shushed him gently, pulling him into his lap. Sherlock’s curls brushed against his face and his nostrils filled with Sherlock’s sweet minty smell.
Once aboard, they were shuffled into a crowd, thick and hot and pulled into a door and down below decks, where the air was warm with breath and tea and the smell of jam and kind voices and Sherlock could almost smile.The steps were clanging metal, and Sherlock let his feet fall, someone slung a white lifejacket over his shoulders, and he followed Janine, but suddenly Sherlock was dizzy, his head spinning, his bond bite sharply aching, like a pulsating icy hot that stung through his neck. He was reeling, his vision blurry and he stumbled, grasping the rail and barely making it to the last step.
"The problem with the evacuation of France is that we don't have the resources to transport so many troops ready, sir, especially without a deep-water port," Mycroft gave the low ranking minister a glare.
The flesh was warm beneath his fingers as he pushed in past John's thick skin, his Alpha keening at the pain, and Sherlock shushed him gently, his fingers digging through warm, plushing crimson flesh, his stomach churning at the coppery smell.
"No, no you must stop that at once, no wonder you seem ill. You'll have those days off, I will see to it." Alan said quickly, looking back down to his drawings as if nothing had been said.
"Darling, we're in France, it's 1939, what did you expect?" John sighed and examined them himself. "Safety precaution, I imagine. Come on, let's go to the house and settle in," Sherlock nodded, eyes doleful as he tucked his ear to John's shoulder.
war. Reckless. Dangerous. Stupid. Beautiful. Pregnant Sherlock. Pups. Kin. Family.  John growled and snarled, his Alpha pulling at him.
“Shower and be waiting upstairs, you have 5 minutes.” John said cooly, not a slip of emotion in his voice- which devastated Sherlock. He obeyed quickly, taking the stairs two at a time as Master went to chat with Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock stripped quickly, balling up his clothes and throwing them in the direction of the basket before jumping into the shower. John's dog tags dangled off his neck as he turned the taps. Sherlock cried out, white spots in his eyes as the scalding hot water slashed at his back. He grit his teeth together and scrubbed harshly at his skin. He was dirty, disobedient, he deserved whatever pain came his way.
"I think you're right John," Sherlock said drowsily, reaching a hand down to grab at his aching stomach. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock's waist and pulled him, back to chest, the omega leaning his head back against John, and his scent grew stronger and stronger. He pulled them both up onto the dock. He pulled Sherlock up into his arms, Sherlock's legs wrapped around his middle as he walked back to the shore. He sat Sherlock down and wrapped the blanket around his shoulders. Sherlock's skin itched and burned, the beading water of his skin beginning to mix with sweat, but he kept it on, his mind still present enough to know that they couldn't walk all the way back with him halfway dressed.
He hit the heel of his palm against his forehead, the voices getting louder and louder. Shut up, Sherlock,
"He's on blockers, he shouldn't be, and he doesn't smell like it," Janine supplied and grasped his hand tight.
"Sherlock," He said, standing, buttoning his suit jacket, taking a delicate hand in his own, kissing the knuckles softly while finding those icy slate blue eyes. Sherlock's cheeks and neck glowed crimson before he pulled his hand away, holding it close to his chest, looking to Greg for help. Ah, shy boy huh?
"It's up to you, darling," John acquiesced, sighing and rubbing his eyes. Sherlock grinned and nuzzled his Alphas' cheek tenderly.
"But he was wrong, wasn't he?" John said, breaths heaving as his rut began, and Sherlock's hips bucked upwards, trying to find his Alpha's cock in a wave of pure lust.
"You're just like your uncle, Emmy, I remember when he was even smaller than you," Mycroft said sadly, face falling into a frown before Emmy pat his face with her tiny hand, grabbing at his chin and nose and giggling. "I used to read him stories when he couldn't sleep, why don't we try for that?"
"Please, help me, I need - need my brother, I'm, sweaty," The Beta female's eyes widened to saucers, gripping him tight by the hand, dragging him through the house silently, putting a finger to her lips. Sherlock obeyed, his mind fuzzy as she pulled him down the hall, his sluggish feet tripping and falling behind. She scooped him into her arms, rushing up flights of stairs, tucking his head of sweaty curls into her neck, speaking in hushed tones to one of the footmen, carrying Sherlock to a room he'd never seen before. His eyelashes fluttered drowsily as she pulled open the bolt of the strong metal door, carrying Sherlock into a sparsely decorated room, just a bed and table, an en suite attached as well as the cool stream of air conditioning.
"Mauled by an animal," Came a soft female voice, and three heads turned to look at the small brunette lab tech, who stepped forward to point to the body. "Bites, pretty obviously made before death," Sherlock watched her incredulously, eyes wide and mouth opened into a small 'o'.
"What if I'm a hindrance? What if I'm-" He sputtered, and pulled tight his trembling hands his fists, "useless?" Mrs. Hudson knit her brows and shook her head at this doleful boy in her house, his eyes glowing with self-hatred.
The phone rang and Emelia only screamed, and Greg sighed, laying her in her crib in a last-ditch effort, to which she jumped up and began to clamber up over. He flapped a blanket over the top of her crib and raced to the hallway just as it reached the third ring.
"You've grown a bit since we met before," Victor smiled, and Sherlock only continued to poke through the glass bottles to find something that would do.
"Clearly not, Sherlock. I will not accept this pity job from your brother because I am afraid. That would make me a deserter, to my men and to my country."
“Are you sure you’re alright?” Sherlock nodded and sipped at his water. The waitress came with menus, and Sherlock gave John an affirming smile.
"It's empty," Sherlock said obviously, looking round, pressing a lone piece of confetti between his fingers. John smirked, walking over to the phonograph, cranking the handle and putting the needle down, the large amplifier twirling out into the empty room. Soon the silence was softened by a crackling melody of
"With what?" Sherlock huffed, and Greg flipped his folded newspaper towards him, flicking the pencil in his fingers and offering it. Sherlock looked down at the white and black boxes half filled with penciled letters.
Sometimes Sherlock was afraid that John might come back different. Sometimes Sherlock was afraid that John might not come back at all.
"Christ, Sherlock, what's going on?!" John shouted, and Sherlock only caved in on himself, tears slipping out from his eyes and down his cheeks. John growled, anger bubbling inside of him, and he reached out and grabbed Sherlock by the arm and pulled him up, and Sherlock whined as his back muscles spasmed. The Doctor in John was now
"I-" Sherlock bit his lip, the thought of telling this man to bugger off was suddenly not so appealing. Maybe this one's different...he is awful pretty...
His baby brother stood in the solid oak doorway, knuckles white gripping the knob. His brows were furrowed in anger, shirt untucked, one knee sock halfway up his calf, the other drooping around his ankle. His hair was a wild jungle of frizzy curls. Mycroft smiled and ignored his brother's strop, patting his knee and rolling his chair from his desk. The gangly boy moved to crawl into his lap, but stopped himself, squaring his shoulders and looking up at Mycroft with determination.
"Well doesn't somebody look smart?!" Came the familiar voice down the street and Sherlock gasped, eyes wide and caught as he watched a very familiar Sargent approaching.
"Important," Sherlock assured, eyes never leaving the page. Mrs. Hudson tutted and clapped the book closed, tucking it under her arm.
Then, the worst came. He sat back onto the carpet, only to hear his trousers make an appalling squealch beneath him. He gasped, hands grasping down around his bum. He was soaking! He must've peed himself, he figured, stripping off his trousers and pants to give to Nanny to wash. But it wasn't urine. It was clear, whitish sticky stuff, it was seeping from his bum and running in rivers down his legs. Sherlock was petrified at this new symptom of his condition.
“Sherlock! You’re bloody freezing, get off!” John gasped and shoved the frozen boy off him, Sherlock erupting in giggles. John sat up quickly, eyes hazy with sleep, silvery hair whisked up on his head. He was instantly more concerned than annoyed with his icy morning snuggle,  “Why’re y’so cold, love?” He opened his eyes fully to see a blustery-cheeked Sherlock, hair flecked with snowflakes.
"Mykie, I need you to invite another guest for dinner tonight, I don't care who as long as they can use their fork properly and can make any sort of noise so replicating of conversation." Mycroft looked up from his work and nodded slowly, not caring to bother his distressed mother with questions. She nodded and turned quickly, ascending the stairs. Yes, she needed a rest. A rest and a Valium and Violet Holmes would be just fine.
"Good morning, gorgeous," John yawned, opening his arms wide, and Sherlock immediately crawled into them, curling up against his chest, and John's eyes closed again. Sherlock curled a few of John's chest hairs in his fingers, face awash with shame- the silence ringing in his ears.
“I think we need to talk, baby,” John murmured, pulling Sherlock out of bed, “go wash up and get dressed, your clothes are clean and folded in the washroom.” Sherlock nodded and headed to the bathroom, washing his face and brushing his teeth with the brand new bamboo toothbrush. He dressed quickly, feeling strange in his dressy outfit from the restaurant. He unbuttoned his shirt and pulled daddy's t-shirt back on, breathing in the calming scent. He quickly exited to the sitting room, smelling something yummy.
How the hell could he be happy, cooped up in some mansion breeding out some horrid, brutish Alpha's pups? Why were things so messed up! He had his own mind, so did Esther, and Martin, and Mummy too he supposed. He looked over at his clothes. A white cotton button down with short sleeves, with a peter pan collar that was getting popular these days, high-waisted trousers, and his tailored tweed jacket. Esther had laid out a flowered square scarf, which made Sherlock smile. Esther had worn one similar last Friday and Sherlock had mentioned it was pretty. He smiled sadly and stripped of his pyjamas, slipping into the clothes and wrapping the scarf up in his hair like he'd seen women in the village doing, knowing the lower-class style would drive Mycroft mad.
"Got any offers yet?" Sherlock huffed, pulling his cigarette from his lips in a cloud of smoke. Greg only shook his head, amused, sighing and nursing his scotch. He was interrupted by a tall, ginger alpha, with freckled cheeks and sharp green eyes that devoured Sherlock. He couldn't be younger than 40. Sherlock was 16.
“Of course, Sherlock, you’ve been good, haven’t you?” Sherlock nodded vigorously, tucking his nose back into John’s scarf, his ear grazing across his stubbled chin. John hoisted the tree into the back of the Land Rover, rubbing Sherlock’s back gently.
Sure, the lovely girls that came around sometimes as dinner guests, and Martin of course, and Mummy (although Martin and Mummy were both well past the age of having any sort of scent or markers at all). But he'd never seen an omega boy before. Not one that didn't like frilly clothes or painting or stuffy romantic novels. None that snuck into their brother's study to read his University textbooks late at night when Nanny had fallen asleep. None that tried to cut out their own organs in order to be something,
"Could you give us a moment, Mrs. H?" She nodded and toodled off, holding her purse like her life depended on it, searching inside of it for her hankercheif. Sherlock looked up dolefully, tears brimming and lip wobbling as he stepped closer. John only gave him a soft smile, carresing his cheekbone with a single callused finger before pressing a kiss to his forehead.
“You poor little thing, we’ll have to start with the classics, hm?” John clicked through Netflix and settled on The Grinch. Sherlock sighed and rolled over in daddy’s lap, staring up at his bearded chin longingly.
"H-hi, Santa," Sherlock blushed and eyed him amorously, legs crossing a bit as he stood innocently, tail fluttering as he shivered. He fiddled with his fingers, looking down quickly and rubbing a spot on the floor with his toe. Daddy growled and pat his thigh. Sherlock obeyed instantly, scampering over, collar jingling and perched delicately on his knee, hands still folded in his lap
"J-Jawn," Sherlock sobbed, nose tucked into John's neck, his chest heaving. John only shushed him, pulling him onto his lap and rubbing his back.
"It's- I-" Sherlock's words fizzled away as he admired it, fingers grazing over the metal. Tears welled in his eyes, hot and scratching at the back of his throat, a sob rising in his chest. "It's perfect, I've never- no one's ever- it's
definitely something he wanted to show off, but nodded obediently. He was shivering uncontrollably, his whole body floating. John’s touch was grounding, the only thing he could cling to as his thoughts drifted from him. He was empty, so helplessly beautifully empty, his mind palace washed clean and pure. He came to in the bath, surrounded by bubbles, calming hands washing him, cleansing him of all these horrible thoughts. He shakily breathed in the scent of
"Oh, ta, Harry," John snapped, removing his kit and changing back into trousers. "Oh, I'm bringing Greg along tonight, is that a problem?" He added, zipping himself up with a little jump before sitting to lace up his oxfords.
"Shoo! I'm trying to use the phone, please stop consummating in the hallway." Sherlock growled, turning and leaning into the phone.
"Oh, well, it's nice to have something to rely on," Sherlock smiled gently, reaching to curl a lock around his finger but stopping when he touched the wet curls, still just a bit oily. His stomach dropped and he swallowed thickly. "I've been reassigned, again, I'll be just a touch further away, maybe when we have days off-"
"Sir?" The dark haired corporal approached him, standing to the side and looking up where his superior's gaze was fixed.
“I-I uh,” Sherlock’s voice was soft, choked with emotion, and it made John uneasy to see him like this. “I want this, sir, I want to be yours.” John’s eyebrows raised and he took the collar from Sherlock, skimming over the leather, jingling on the tag. It still had his last subs name engraved on it, his contact info on the back.
"Sherlock!" Mycroft scowled, "I hope someday you will be mature enough to understand that I cannot make exceptions, for any reason, if not especially because he is my brother-in-law."
"Sherlock. Now please." Sherlock wiped his eyes with the back of his sleeves and stepped into it, swallowing thickly and looking at the floor- tracing the ornate fabric with his eyes. Clara clicked the locks in place, buckling the straps and giving his thigh a soft pat, turning the key before stepping away with forlorn eyes. She placed the keys in Greg's palm, and Sherlock snatched his trousers from the back of a chair and slipped them on quickly, glaring daggers at Lestrade
"I didn't mind." Sherlock snapped, voice icy and aloof, engrossed in his experiments. John's heart sank in his chest, dropping his hands from his lover's shoulders and stuffing his hands into his pockets.
"Love, I'll have pups to look after, I don't know if I'd have the energy, let alone the time, to look after you," She chuckled, his wet hair now slightly combed. Sherlock's lips parted, his face desperate.
"It's alright, Sherlock, it was an accident." He said gently into his ear, rubbing a circle into the soft skin of Sherlock's front. Sherlock's throat caught with a sob, but he only nodded.
John snarled, teeth embedded in Sherlock's flesh, hips still bucking, the knot quite sealed. He let go and began to painstakingly clean the nasty mark, lapping at the drops of blood at the purpling bite.
"But I'm comfy, John," He mumbled, nuzzling at the collar of John's jacket. John shook his head and stood, stretching his arms a bit before holding his hand out for Sherlock, who groaned, but took it anyways. They stepped out along with another couple, and Sherlock immediately recoiled from the sun.
"Oh, yes, I've heard about him, that's for sure," Louise raised her eyebrow inquizitively, "You know how the Alphas get with them," She bit back a laugh and sipped her tea.
The solution to his frightful independence had been Miss Adler- an Alpha, with an bonded omega of her own, and a very firm hand. Miss Adler was hateful. He'd
"Get out of my house. Now." Mycroft seethed, flashing his own set of teeth, snarling at Victor, stepping between him and Greg. "And don't come near my family. ever. again."
"Right, catch of the day, let's take our pick," She said into Sherlock's ear and he knit his brows incredulously as she evaluated them, "I think I'll take the ginger in the corner," Sherlock looked at the indicated solider, who was a bit on the short side but had a pretty face, before turning to speak into her ear.
"f-fine," He whispered, his powers of spoken word quite gone. Sherlock was still shaking, and Captain Watson had a bit of concern still on his face as he watched him intently. His sharp gaze pinned Sherlock, his heart racing. What the hell was going on? He needed to get in control. Now. His omega was begging him, to do something, kiss this man, anything for those hands to touch his skin once more.
"You're alright, Sherlock, everyone is so very proud of you, sport," Rudy smiled and wiped away his tears, pulling him to his wobbly feet and wrapping Sherlock's arm around his own. placing calm and affirming hands over Sherlock's, guiding him down the aisle. Unconventional maybe, a presenting omega usually entered alone, but nobody seemed to mind as the older beta man gently brought Sherlock to his brother. Sherlock whimpered, eyes flickering around the church, quite embarrassed. He made eye contact with a tan, blonde boy, Mycroft's age, who smiled at him and gave him an encouraging thumbs up. Sherlock blushed and continued until he made it to the small stool that was waiting for him. Rudy pat his hand and let him go, quickly finding his seat once again. The organ stopped it's tune and silence fell. Sherlock nervously knelt, the stool creaking beneath his knees, just like Martin had said, but instead of bowing his head he looked fearfully up to his older brother, nose snotty and tears still drying on his cheeks. Mycroft gave him a firm nod as the priest began the ceremony.
," Sherlock waved the card in the air, even though he really only wanted to tuck it into his breast pocket, feel it next to his heart, breathe in that safe, warm, musky smell... "I don't ever want to be married." Sherlock declared, letting the card find it's place next to his plate. Greg's lips quirked into a sad smile, and gave Mycroft a pinch, as if to say
Sherlock only mumbled an incoherent reply, words a slurred mess as a second wave of need rippling through him, shuddering and bucking his hips back as John slowly pulled out and in again, hand gripped around Sherlock's hip, the other planted firmly on the small of his back.
omega, and he would not be that. Never. The card fell from his fingers back into the box, and he stood, knees weak, falling forward, grasping a post of his bed to stay vertical in a haze of dizzying pheromones. Tears blurred in his eyes- the rushes of chemical emotion leaving him a trembling mess.
"He had lots of money, and when I- when I did, the bad things," Sherlock pulled back to show daddy his arms as evidence, John nodded in understanding, "He, left me there, in the bad places, he said-" Sherlock paused, taking a shaky breath to continue, "said, said I wasn't worth the effort of fixing, cut me off from mummy, an- and I lived on the street for a while after that, then i got the job at the cafe and I, I did good on my exams, and they let me into university, a-and then I m-met y-you, d-addy," Sherlock's lips pressed closed, his eyes squeezing shut at the bad memories that filled him to the brim, sloshing over the edges and spilling down his cheeks.
‘I know Greg..I…was away for a week, and I left London that I was angry with Sherlock, trying to relax for some days,..but the honeymoon was terrible and when I come back here trying to fix things up with Sherlock I realize that I neither understand him anymore.’
Sherlock sighs heavily, gaze transfixed on the computer screen. He jots notes down into black moleskin book.
‘How do you feel my dear?’ Mrs. Hudson grasps his left arm, and turns him toward her. ‘How’s the leg?’
Sherlock turns looking at John and smiles at him ‘Hi John’ then he quickly takes his phone and the jacket
"Si beau! Si beau!" (So handsome!!) She cried, pulling Sherlock by the hand and giggling. He returned a small smile as John came, cases tucked under his arms.
John Watson's heart raced, thumping in his chest like a drum, loud and fast and it thrummed through every vein. He swallowed thickly and grasped the rings out of his sporran, holding them out in his hand to examine. The abbey was abuzz, and John tried not to look anyone in the eyes. He smiled at his housekeeper, who gave him a thumbs up from the first row. He could laugh at how pathetically empty his side of the church was. He looked down the aisle, where Greg was rushing as he strode, smiling wide with hands tucked in his pockets. John smiled, and they shook hands.
"Well you've seen me, haven't you?" Sherlock grumbled dangerously low, locking eyes with John, his baby blues shimmering with excitement. John licked his lips, eyes raking over Sherlock's lean and athletic form.
"I hope this doesn't put a damper on the dinner tonight," She said sadly, folding her hands in her lap.
"It's no problem," Sherlock smiled genuinely, to which Greg gave an approving nod. John had asked that Clara be one of his bridesmaids, and well, Greg didn't really count anyways, and Sherlock didn't have anyone else anyway.
"Your tan, you've been in the sun, but your tan is only below your wrists and above your neck. You're only 25 or so, and I doubt you enlisted at 18, so you've risen ranks rather quickly. Where can a British army doctor get some sun these days and attain a nice post of Empire? India or Australia." Sherlock bit his lip and looked up nervously, icy blue eyes twinkling with flecks of green.
"Well, the curls are natural, and I don't usually wear any makeup," He said softly, twisting open a tin of moisturizer and dotting it on his drier skin.
"Sure about that? You look rather naughty to me sweetheart..." daddy unclasped his cuff links slowly, dangerously, sending jolts of electric nerves through the younger boy on his lap.
ago. Sherlock was far more intelligent, far more human than plenty of them. He stopped, tremor stronger than ever and sighed. He'd kill for Sherlock, die for Sherlock. Any day of the week.
"Do you understand why I have to do this, Sherlock?" John cocked his head, his face emotionless, his Captain's Voice in full affect, low and dangerous. He slowly undid his belt, pulling it off loop by loop, Sherlock's lip quivering at the rattle of the buckle.
" Sherlock shakily let go, eyes pressed closed, and John pulled his hands out from beneath him, and Sherlock bit his lip. "See love, you're alright, I'm right here," John smiled as Sherlock tensed and wrapped around him again. John frowned and pressed a hand to Sherlock's forehead.
"Hello, Mr. Watson," John smiled, pressing a kiss to his shoulder and sucking in a lungful of his sweet honeying pheremones. "Are you feeling better, darling?"
"My mother only let me do this to meet men," She looked sad, "My ex was a real bastard, and to think I almost married him!" She huffed and Sherlock swallowed nervously, looking down at his ring and clenching his hand.
"Yes, exactly like that," Mycroft paused again, turning towards the door, doing his damn hardest not to salivate at the sweet sugary scent of a fertile omega. "This is wonderful news Sherlock, I promise," Mycroft fought the tears that welled in his eyes. "I promise."
Sherlock clambered up into the civilian craft, being pulled up by two sets of hands. He immediately turned, making sure they pulled John gently, and the alpha flopped against the decks, the crowd of evacuees moving to make room.
“Um, friend of mine at Shield, he’s off on missions all the time so I’m kind of like his foster owner, his name's Goose but I call him Marty. What do you mean he’s not a cat?”
is this terribly boring?? I'm not good at slow-burn, but I wanted to set some things up slower before I let John in and things go crazy.
Sherlock shuddered and wrapped his duvet around himself tighter, feeling so small and so alone. He was brave. He'd find a way. He'd block it out, he'd get into his mind palace and let John have whatever he wanted, wait until he was finished to come back out. Or he could kill himself before he had the chance.
Hudson?" Sherlock looked up, his eyes glowing with seriousness, and something passed between them, a silent shared solidarity. Beta females and omegas weren't so different, he thought.
their room, curls riotous and fluffed up, eyes glowy and soft. His collar still rested on his neck, dark leather contrasting something gorgeous with his milky white skin. He didn’t sleep often, but when he did he went hard. It was 10 or so in the morning, and John smiled at him sweetly.
"You did spoil that surprise for me, Sherlock, so piss off for that." Greg looked out across the moor and sighed. "Truly, I'm on your side, Sherl, I think it's all horribly unfair." Sherlock looked up slightly, biting his lip. "Not getting a voice, not getting a vote, married off at 13, bloody awful business."
Sherlock bit his lip and nodded, looking up at John with wide eyes, “Jawn?” John continued typing his blog, painfully pecking the keys one at a time.
He accented the stairs to hear shuffles and shouts, both Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson, pausing midway, frowning at the upset omega pheromones that met him. His boy was displeased it seemed, hopefully he'd be in a good mood when he saw John.
"If you see fit to waste yourself in the Territorial Service fixing cars and plugging in wires, be my guest, but if you wish to have a crack at enigma, you are to report to Bletchley on Monday."
"I'm ready, John, I am, I'm ready, please," Sherlock's eyes were clear and he looked at John with a steady, stubborn strength. "I want them,"
omega leaning against the window glass, eyes the colour of Antarctica as he looked out into the dampened street. John's heart raced, placing his hand on Sherlock's knee, fingers tracing a light circle over the trouser fabric. Sherlock only tensed beneath him.
“You sure?” Sherlock’s eyes glowed with seriousness, his whole being itching for this tree. Lone, forgotten,
"Don't be stupid, Sherlock, does John know?" Mycroft's fist tightened around the wooden handle and he knit his brows together.
WARNING: this author is delicate and needs criticism to be kind and constructive bc he is a sensitive bean <3
“Brilliant,” John chuckled. Sherlock blushed. That wasn’t so impressive. “What are you studying at school, love?”
Sherlock placed it gently on top of the bed, looking into the box. Matching leather cuffs, a Scottish tawse, a riding crop, lengths of rope. Sherlock bit his lip. This was a sexual thing. He really should have deduced this hobby by now, but the idea of John sexually was one he had hidden deep down in his mind palace, locked behind a steel door to keep it from escaping. A subject to be avoided at all cost, risk he make a mistake and ruin everything. He was always ruining things.
"Continue pressure and I'll stitch him closed, you did good," There was a pat on his back from one of the onlookers and Sherlock pocketed the bullet before pressing down again, his stained hands leaving bloody marks all over the torn shirt of the Captain.
"Would you like to come into my nest?" Sherlock said with a giggle, pulling open a slot in the duvet and John obliged once his boots were off and discarded to the floor. Sherlock immediately wrapped himself over his Alpha like a sea anenome, his legs locked around his abdomen and his nose pressed to his neck, sucking down breath after delcious breath of pheromones, warm and spicy and soothing. "You're my husband, Jawn," The omega whispered, lapping at the older man's neck delicately.
Sherlock took a shaky breath, stepping to the large clawfoot bath tub, positioning the handheld mirror between his legs, giving him a view of his hateful, disgusting genetalia. He trembled as he brought the scissors to his entrance, gritting his teeth. He paused, gliding the open blade across his inner thigh, just to test it's sharpness. A plume of red pulsed out of the cut and Sherlock watched with fascination as the crimson liquid dribbled down his leg into the tub and circled the drain. He cut once more on the other leg, the pain from the first incision hitting him in a dizzying wave. Time to get to work.
‘Oh Hey! I almost forgot why I called! I found the suit!' A smile breaches the tone of his voice, singing through the phone.
(From his bedroom) ‘In fact…that’s what I’m going to do’ ….. ‘Having some rest’ He opens the door and look at both of them ‘Away from Alcatraz’ shutting the door.
‘See!’ Sherlock hollers, as Mycroft breaches through the front door of his flat, ‘Not on drugs – and I’m not disappointed that John’s getting married. I’m happy, so very happy! Can’t you tell?’ Continuing boisterously, Sherlock paints a pleasant smile upon his visage, ‘I’m not disappointed in the least. I knew – wait…Lestrade told you everything.’
Victor freezes up, stepping back, panting. His eyes wide open, his hand on his mouth, shocked. He's trembling. Still panting and shivering,...he mutters: “....Mary...."
John looks at her, mouth gaping, not sure about her intentions. Then cracks a nervous laugh ‘You…you can’t ask me this…right?’
he thought. Holmes jumped out of bed and exited his room to go find Watson. Oddly enough, his friend wasn’t downstairs in the bar either. Holmes paced the length of the bar, growing ever more impatient with each step. After a few minutes of thinking, he let out a frustrated sigh.
He thought with a nervous chuckle as he slowly moved it back and forth. His tail was quite long, almost touching the ground when held limp. He looked at his tail for a bit, then stood to go back to the stream. This time he didn’t hesitate to look at his reflection. His ears were large and pointed, like most wild canines. A long, pointy muzzle protruded from his face. Watson lifted his lips, baring his teeth, his canines were razor-sharp. He lowered his lips, slightly unnerved at the sight of his own teeth. One thing hadn’t changed though, and those were his eyes. They were the same bright blue as before turning into a wild creature.
He started to make his way through the partially crowded pub, when suddenly a young boy barged through the door. The boy, approximately 14 years of age, laid his eyes on Holmes and exclaimed, “Are you Mr. Holmes, sir?” Holmes nodded.
"It is just Watson you fool, and he needs your help!" Holmes whispered to himself. He then stood and took off his long coat, and draped it over Watson's body, it was quite chilly in the dark forest. He leaned over and whispered into Watson's ear, "Hold on old boy, I will get you home. Your secret is safe with me." With this he stood and gathered the two tethered horses to head back to the little town.
Sherlock walks out his room, closing the door and pressing the alarm’s code. Then takes the coat and scarf in the living room and checks the program on his pc, and quickly leaves.
‘Well, think about it, Sherlock..fear, after all, is our real enemy. Fear is taking over our world. Fear is being used as a tool of manipulation in our society.’
‘So…Jane’ Sherlock gets out, drying his hair with a towel, talking to Mycroft ‘Do you still want to know if I had sex with the ‘French friend’ (looking at Greg) or not?’
"I can't find her! Her phone is off, yesterday she looked scared and worried...she's helping me, you know.. since you left me alone...I had to find someone else...I've been looking for her for hours...her flat is empty. I'm afraid something happened to her, Sherlock."
Mary smiles. “Yes,...I know about Daniel, I know he's your son, and..I would like to know if he got in contact with you in the last few days.”
‘No. Thank you, but I can take care of him.’ Mycroft turns back to the bedroom, intending to leave them and them in return to vacate the flat.
‘I know it, I already know this Greg, what are you talking me about?’ John cracks a laugh, a bit surprised, not understanding Greg’s intentions.
Mary is pacing rapidly between the door and the window, looking repeatedly at the phone on the bed. Suddenly she gets a call. She peers at the number, trying to figure out who it belongs to, painting, biting her nails. She takes the phone and goes toward the window's curtain, hiding behind it, and looking out the street to see if anybody is out.
‘You know John....what I asked to Victor when I saw him the first time after many years the day after Sherlock’s flat was attacked by bombs?’
“Same reaction as mine” John comments, sarcastically, holding a glass of whisky. He takes the phone and stands up, staggering and sipping once more before putting the glass on the bedside table and taking his jacket.
“Professor Trevor, I want to thank you for everything you’ve done for us. We are all shocked, and we know you don’t have any fault in the case, we hope Sarah and Daniel will come back home soon.”
‘Greg, you don’t need to fake it anymore, I mean….you could just say you had a quarrel with her and now you solved it.’
Anderson feels the tension and tries to change subject ‘So, did you all know what to sing when Greg walks in? Let's try again, Molly, you sing the first part, repeat after me: HAAAPPPY Birthhhday. HAAAPPYYY Birthhhdayyy'
‘Greg, I don’t really talk to Sherlock … I….I’ve never really had a talk with him since we came back together, I saw him at St James’s Park the morning before going away and he was completely insane with me….he….it was like he blew off steam he had had inside for so long…..’ ‘…..I didn’t know he could be so affected…. he was right, I didn’t really see……we just kept spying on him and then stayed with him the day after as nothing happened, it’s not right, that’s not how….a friendship works…’
Victor ‘Daniel, one of my student...I was at the bar talking with Sarah, his friend..she told me he didn’t come back home and now his family is worried, she wanted my help to find him’
But is cut off as Greg arrives, grabs his phone out of John’s hand and shouts, ‘What in the hell are you two doing?’
‘Oh my fucking god. Oh my fucking god. Myke is going to kill me, he’ll kill me.’ Greg mutters to himself.
Sherlock feels his heart dropping, but not replying, trying to look calm. "wh--" he mutters "when are you leaving?"
‘You’re seriously in peril and you can’t even see it. Somebody walked inside your house without being noticed by anybody and assembled a net under the pavement, filling it up with mines and he’s been generous with you.’
‘This is bullshit, you’re getting nowhere, I was so close to solve the case yesterday, the truth was right there, but somebody is misleading us, that’s why we got shot in the taxi, it already happened, Victor has nothing to do with Moran’
‘What you’re telling me now. You never know what answer he would have given to you. How he would have reacted. And what if he felt the same? What if those gestures for him were enough, too? Enough to be happy with you?’
John’s feet patter, as he waltzes along Baker Street, opposite the house. He drops his foot to the road, intending to cross over the street to the front door. However, a man exits. Eyeglasses on, some shaggy books on his left hand, vacates the house. He shuts the front door firmly behind himself. John frowns, as a vague recognition latches onto the hairs of arms. They stand tall, as the man crosses the street an approaches. As their gazes clash, the acquaintance smiles broadly at John. They each exchange polite greetings, the man waving his free hand as he passes John’s fossilized form.
‘When John was shot I lost it, I couldn’t find it, I don’t know where it is, probably it’s still in the taxi or on the street, I couldn’t care about it,..John was shot, I didn’t take it’ Sherlock looks away, embarrassed.
John smiles widely at the clearly wasted detective, ‘This night’s going much better than I expected.’
John and Greg look at each other uncertainly, but disregard the hardness of Mycroft’s attitude and take the inhabiting the living room. John takes up his place in a familiar armchair, as Greg lounges on the sofa. Staring at the floor, eyes peeled back, John nervously clenches his hands together. Still, he is shocked. Thinking made him all the more terrified, but as a silence dominated the flat, thinking was all he could manage to do.
Sherlock, you're so perfect," John thundered as his hips began to cant, thick muscular hands wrapped around Sherlock's hips, bruises sure to form there in the morning. Sherlock was beyond words at this point, his shoulders shaking with silent sobs, cheeks stained with tears of relief. Completely torn apart and shaking. The Alpha grinned, licking his lips as he his eyes raked over Sherlock's pert little nipples and miles of porcelain skin.
"Sherlock," He said, "we had a deal. It's been two years of you growling and nipping at every Alpha you see. And now, I've met Dr. Watson a few times, he's an upright bloke, and I think you could love him, if you'd stop being so stubborn. I've sat back and let you ignore all advances, but not anymore."
"Miss. Scott, we'll need to have these two buildings done before you report back, we have an exercise at 1800"
"Please. Help me, Mycroft, I can't lose him, I can't, I-" Sherlock sounded positively desperate, it was upsetting Mycroft, even if Sherlock was no longer his concern.
"God, I haven't been this happy in-" John realized suddenly that he'd never been as happy as he was, right now, in the middle of a fucking war, "a long while,"
"Why are you watching me?" Sherlock said, heart thumping in his chest as John came up behind him, wrapping his arms around his shoulders and kissing his neck. It felt, warm and soft and wet and he wanted to faint.
Sherlock sat in shock, he was practically catatonic. Lestrade furrowed his eyebrows in concern. There was a tense silence. London? Was this  a joke? The alpha part he'd negotiate later- hell, London? A thousand places to run to in London.
"I don't need help! I don't need you! I'm not helpless, I'm not meek, and I don't want to help you with any murders, please leave me alone," Greg's mouth hung open and Sherlock angrily pinned up some socks, teeth grit and stomach churning.
"I'm sorry, I understand," Sherlock turned his chin and looked away. John's eyes remained on the letter, his fist against the wood of the desk. He scrubbed his face and sighed.
"He'll be just fine, Sherlock, now let's get you some tea, you'll feel awfully better when you have some tea." Sherlock could only nod mutely and let her tug him along, turning once more to watch the little dot on the horizon.
“No, baby, you’re not. You’re my beautiful, clever, sweet boy, nothing can change that. I’m so sorry you had a scare tonight, I should’ve been watching you. I should’ve kept my calm, but I let you down, and I’m sorry.”
"You'd make a great detective, you know?" Sherlock raised his eyebrows and let out another puff. "You're clever as all hell- you know everything about people just from looking at them."
"No harm done, love," John smiled, the flat beginning to be less ashy. He put his hands in his pockets and stood with his feet wide, Sherlock blushing at his posture, holding tight around his knees on the rug. "Besides," He mumbled, standing over his now very bashful husband, "maybe I like being treated like a god,"
"for better for worse, for richer for poorer," John smirked and the priest grumbled, Sherlock completely unaware he'd skipped ahead.
breeding centres- the ones you made up to scare me! Well you can't. I'm not afraid of you. Of any of you lot, snarling and reeking of pheromones," Sherlock growled and pushed his brother, shoving him forward barely an inch before Mycroft grabbed him by the wrists to stop him.
“So I thought we’d go over the rules this morning, does that sound alright?” Sherlock nodded, eyes on his plate, prodding at strawberries. “Hey, y’alright, baby?”
"Till death us do part," Sherlock looked up fearfully, barely choking the words out as he looked to John.
The room was silent, save for some humming from Emilia. Sherlock noticed the quiet and turned to his shocked audience.
Sherlock swallowed nervously, fixing his scarf into his hair, pulling a single curl out to rest on his forehead, adjusting his jacket sleeves. The cottage was not what he expected- mossy, craggling stone, with a sagging black roof that ached under the weight of years of heavy rain. The stone path was littered with abandoned toys, and Sherlock smiled and picked up a small bear with musty brown fur and black button eyes. Greg didn't seem bothered by the state of the house, so Sherlock stiffened his upper lip and went on, knocking at the door, flinching at the sound of a wailing child. There was scuttling before the door swung open.
"No, 'course I bloody well do," Greg pressed a chaste kiss to his lips and took his hands in his, rubbing circles over his tense knuckles, "I only meant, you're so rough with Sherlock, he's just a kid you know? I remember being a bit sulky when I was his age,"
"It'll be fun, I promise," Sherlock only nodded shyly as John pulled him up, leading him by the hand downstairs, giving Sherlock the basket "Bye, Marie!" He called as they pushed open the front door.
," Sherlock's neck bristled when he heard a whistle behind them and approaching footsteps. He turned to see two men coming, looking rather pleased with themselves.
“The intruder didn’t take anything,” Lestrade argued, “It wasn’t a break-in,” Sherlock rolled his eyes and pressed fingers to his temples.
"Don't we? Isn't that what you're purchasing? The rare male omega and his fabled fertility. Have you and Mycroft discussed breeding positions yet? Must be sure to have as many alphas as possible, right? King and Country and all that."
"Hey! Be nice! Or I'll report you!" Vanecia glared at them in the mirror with her best impression of the commander and everyone laughed, everyone except Sherlock, who looked out the back of the van, watching the street as it rolled beneath them, stone after stone after stone, the conversation fading away from his ears, just the hum of the engine beneath him, the jostle of his ankles as they went over the practically ancient street. He closed his eyes and bit his lip, his stomach wretching with guilt and pain as he leaned his head back against the metal of the bench. John, god, where was John? What was he doing? Acting as if John hadn't saved him, as if John didn't complete him.
"N-no!" Sherlock cried, slurring his words as blood continued to pulse out of his wounds, he slowly pushed the tip of the scissors inside of himself, keening in pain.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered open as he awoke, popping his head from out beneath his duvet, his hive of tangled curls flopping about as he sat up. Squares of winter sunlights cast over his room, plumes of dust set alight. Esther was pulling open the blinds, setting out his clothes. Martin had died a few years ago, and now the upstairs housemaids looked after him. Sherlock liked her- now that Nanny had been dismissed, she treated him like a grownup- besides the fact she dressed him like a paper doll. Sherlock slipped out of bed and pulled on his dressing gown, stre-e-etching his arms before collapsing back on top of the rumpled bed covers. Esther gave him a pat.
Watson rested for the next day, and he took the bandages off his midsection when he woke that evening. His battle wounds had completely healed, and he felt more like himself. With a nasty hankering for some tea and biscuits, he decided it was time to come out of his room and stretch his legs a bit. He swung his legs out of bed and slowly walked out to the sitting area. He was expecting Holmes to be there, but his nose told him otherwise.  As he was standing there testing the scent of the room, another familiar smell wafted up the stairs with the sound of light steps. “Oh hello Dr. Watson!” A bright voice chirped. “ I brought some tea, dear. You must be starved! Come and sit, you need to rest.” She chided. He couldn’t explain the scent of Mrs. Hudson, he just knew she smelled like
He thought as his mouth watered at the thought of anything to put into his stomach. “Where is Holmes?” He asked as he sipped the hot perfection.  “He left early this morning. He didn’t say anything, other than to not wake you.” Watson shook his head, and his stomach growled loudly. Mrs. Hudson chuckled lightly and said; “Don’t fret about Holmes dear, he’ll come back eventually. You stay here and enjoy your tea, I’ll go make you something to eat.” He nodded and thanked her. He sat in his chair and looked out the window as he listened to Mrs. Hudson head downstairs.
The boy lead Holmes from the pub to the Denvir Family Farm. The walk was long, and the sun was just starting to rise when they made it to the property. Holmes acknowledged the dark forest on the edge of the farm, with the woods following the road for who knows how far. “They are back here, sir.” The boy led Holmes to a small livestock shed, where two men stood waiting with saddled horses. “Mr. Holmes, I presume.” The oldest man said with a small bow. “We know why you are here in the countryside, the beast is real. Our cattle have been the victim of it many times.” “We will see about that.” Holmes snipped. The older man huffed, but handed the reins of a dun mare to him. “We heard something earlier this evening, deep in the woods. Screaming, and gunshots. I know the beast is out there, and his second victim is out there too.” The old farmer climbed onto his horse with a glare and started towards the forest. The second man, probably the son of the eldest farmer, didn’t say a word and trotted his horse to catch up.
He jumped into a thicket and watched through the branches, the voices were coming right towards him. Only a few moments later, he saw four horses break through the trees and down to the creek for a drink. He lifted his nose to the air and inhaled. His chest filled with excitement and longing at the scent being brought to him by the morning breeze. He shuffled closer to the edge of the bush to get a better view of the men. He instantly recognized the scowl being worn by one of them. Holmes.
“Careful, Sherlock, it’s hot!” His eyes grew wide as he looked down fearfully at his cup, blowing harshly at the sweet liquid, a few drops dribbling over the side. Sherlock very cautiously sipped at the cocoa, finding it was indeed quite hot. He set it down despondently, blowing at it impatiently. “Would you like me to get a piece of ice?” daddy said with a laugh, rubbing Sherlock’s back. He nodded and daddy fetched a cube that plopped into his mug, floating like an iceberg in his beverage. He poked it with his finger, watching it dissolve in a puff of steam. He poked his finger into the cocoa and found it alright to drink.
"My god, 1 in a million, literally," He chuckled, and Sherlock's eyes widened at his blithe indifference, the Alpha looking at him like he were some freak of nature. Sherlock couldn't decide if that was better than an object of desire. "But I don't understand, why are you hiding? when you have no reason to?" Alan said curtly, turning and sitting back at his desk.
Sherlock was a whimpering mess, hair dripping with sweat and skin clammy and moist. He panted and gasped but his lungs just couldn't get enough air and each thrust sent big blots of colour in front of his eyes. He groaned and grasped at the fabric of the chair, knuckles white as John hit that certain bunch of nerves inside of him. He keened in a sound that couldn't be recognized as any form of lingual communication and yowled as his own cock searched for release, his hips bucking into the chair. He gasped, coming all over himself, clear bodily fluid that drenched the chair and was dripping down his front.
“I feel like I’m inside out.” He hated these stupid human feelings that were pouring in, too many too fast. He needed something simple. Submission was simple, straightforward. He looked up at his Master, who was eyeing him carefully. “Like my nerves are on the outside sir,” He shook his head at how idiotic it sounded. But John didn’t laugh at him or sigh or glare. He ran fingers through the hair on the back of his head, twirling a curl in his fingers.
"Ah, yes, nothing wrong with it. I say it's always better to be prepared than to leave family high and dry. What was your wife's name?"
“My disgusting excuse for a blood relative-my brother,” Sherlock growled like a lion who did not yet know how to roar. “And I hate them and I don’t want to see them and I won’t!”
Mycroft Holmes hadn't been home in a solid week. Things were too busy, he couldn't rest even for a moment, he had to be on call. Greg understood, he really did, he knew what they were up against, he read the papers. Germany was waiting to get Italy in line before they attacked Poland, which could be any day now. Emelia, did not know any of that, and was very upset to not have her papa nearby.
When a rainsoaked Sherlock was finally brought home, wrapped in a certain constable's coat, shivering terribly, there was a distraught blonde army captain waiting on the steps.
Sherlock listened with intent, holding his fingers to his headphones, scribbling out the messages tapping through with his pencil, frowning as the words formed and pulling his headset off. His pencil clattered to the floor as he pushed back his chair and strode down the row of radio transmitters, girls in headphones with a variety of colours of pinned curls before finding his commander. He tapped on her shoulder, his eyes glowing with purpose.
Even with an early morning sun, the tall canopy of the forest created a dark atmosphere. The air seemed more chilled, and the forest held little sound other than the hooves of 4 horses. “How large is this forest?” Holmes asked after minutes of silence. “No one knows for sure, we don’t enter the woods unless we have too.” The middle-aged man said. Holmes nodded. He was suddenly very unnerved by the thought of not being in the presence of Watson. “Did you see a man walk down the road last night?” He asked anxiously. The men shook their heads, but the boy cleared his throat, “I saw a gentleman walking down the lane earlier this evening. He waved at me while I was pulling water out of the well.” Holmes’s blood suddenly ran cold, his mind a flurry of worry. Watson always carriers his revolver, and he enjoys going for his evening strolls.
"It was a wedding present from your dearest brother." He muttered sarcastically and Sherlock momentarily frowned, even if it was
"No, no, I think it's g-going to skip, n-no J-John, but it's punishing me first," He barely choked out before his bondbite screamed like it was on fire. He keened and leaned forward, crashing his nose into Mrs. Hudson shoulder and grasping her tight. She only cooed and rubbed his back, carding through his hair and rocking them. Soon it began to fade, and Sherlock whimpered, tear tracks drying on his cheeks. Mrs. Hudson only soothed him and pat his shoulder. "I'm sorry I made a mess," Sherlock whispered and she only chuckled.
The whole room smelt of alcohol, sweat and something warm that Sherlock couldn't identify, and his senses were under attack as music, laughter, glassware clinking, whistling, all filled his ears and he gasped.
"Close your eyes!" John cried from the doorway, hands behind his back, grinning with a chuffed smile. Sherlock grumbled but shut his eyes anyways, holding out his hands expentantly. Suddenly John was kissing him and Sherlock opened his eyes immediately.
"I'm Thomas," The Alpha whispered harshly in his ear, pulling him close with a hand low on his back as the music started up again. Sherlock's skin flushed, and Thomas's nose trailed along his neck, breathing in gulps of Sherlock's sweet, fertile smell. "You smell divine, princess, how's a sweet thing like you still not found a mate?" Sherlock gagged at this repulsively old man that was far too close. Far too close.
Sherlock tensed and John rubbed a circle in his back. Those two were going to be harder for him, John knew that.
"You're right, back to your post," She turned on her heel and Sherlock watched her as she approached the captain, frozen in his place as he saw his eyebrows furrow as well. He swallowed and turned to retreat to his workstation, slumping down and holding his headphones in his hands, still watching his superiors discussion in the corner of his eye.
Sherlock nodded, eyes still locked on Alan. Alpha, clearly, but not acting like one. Only child, public school, Cambridge. No, wait,
"France? I want to go, please John, I've never been, I don't care about stupid politics, please can't we go?" Sherlock sounded so young, hell he was
Sherlock gasped, eyes wide as he pulled out a dark leather collar, fit for a large dog or a person. The buckle was silver and the leather was worn. Sherlock sniffed the inside, it smelled like women’s perfume, hints of men’s deodorant as well. Not John’s. Someone (someones) else wore this. Sherlock was trembling as he ran his fingers over it, the implications overwhelming. He tentatively put it around his neck, testing it. It fit on the third buckle, but his stomach churned at the idea of putting it on himself. This was John’s collar. Not something to be taken lightly.
"Oh," Sherlock breathed, realizing he was wrapped in the superior officers coat. "I'm sorry, I think I'm going back, I shouldn't have come," He shrugged off the tan woolen thing and stepped before a strong dry hand held his shoulder and pulled him back.
John cleared his throat, and Sherlock only looked down, frozen solid under their sharp eyes. He rubbed a spot on the floor with his shoe, it really was quite shiny.
"How can I not be? Aren't you worried?" Mycroft tensed, his eyebrows raising in defeat and he slid into the armchair opposite.
