“Can’t believe you haven’t stargazed before, how could anyone pass up the opportunity to have as a cosmological guide, I bet I’ll find science extremely interesting if you’re the one talking about it,” he smirked, “it’s a shame my high school science teachers weren’t as pretty as you I’d have definitely paid more attention,” he joked gently ribbing Tony.
“Meat isn’t like the only way to get buff. I used protein shakes after the gym. Easy to get buff as a vegetarian--harder to get buff as a vegan. But still doable. It’s all about smart eating so you make the most of your workouts.” Steve answered Tony’s question quite easily.
“Obviously, I did, but it’s been a while. Tom ended our thing almost two years ago when he got a girlfriend and I can’t very well ask for hugs from interns. Rhodey’ll cuddle me, but he’s been on a lot of long-term assignments recently.” Tony wrapped a hand around the back of Steve’s neck for some skin contact and smiled. “And yes. I think I definitely am with my soulmate and there are very few situations in which I’ll turn down all night cuddling. Here, I’ll show you the bedrooms.” He pulled away just enough to take his hands and pull him along, then briefly showed him the sitting room, study, and guest bedrooms and bathrooms on the way to his own. “What do you think?” The bedroom was painted a pale grey with blue, black and white, and glass and metal furniture and decorations. One wall was all glass windows and the door to the closet wasn’t so much a door as a frosted glass privacy wall in front of it. The bedframe wasn’t designed for bondage, but he was sure Steve would be able to see just how well it would work for it anyways.
“That sounds like a lovely way to relax,” Steve agreed, similarly buckling in and starting the car.  Reversing, he hummed.  “Having a shower usually helps calm my heart rate and I’m guessing you meant showering with me? That sounds really sweet.  Just washing one another.  Taking care of each other.” He nodded.  “You’re full of bright ideas--I can see why you have three doctorate degrees.” He smiled, smoothing over their rocky experience as he headed out onto the road.
Tony leaned forward a little at the press of Steve’s hands to his back, wanting to feel properly surrounded by it. He smirked back at him, though. “I like that you’re not afraid to call a man beautiful, Rogers.” He hummed when the touches got a bit less exploratory and he settled his own hands against Steve’s waist and let them stay there. “And that’s definitely a good thing, since I think having your arms around me is my new favorite thing.”
“Elementary school,” Tony interrupted, not quite sure how to deal with the unfamiliar dynamic of this group.  “That’s how small I was thinking.  Steve?” He tilted his head back to meet his eyes seriously.  “I think that’s adorable.  I heard way worse things at MIT, I promise.  So much worse.  But I was looking for something more along the lines of called the teacher mom eight times or lost a library book and made up an increasingly unbelievable lie to cover it until it eventually got to the point where if the lie was true, the universe would explode.  Y'know.  Something more appropriate for talking to his soulmate.” Sure, he kind of liked these guys, but that was mean, and he honestly didn’t care if they hated him so long as Steve liked him and knew that he liked him too.  He sipped at his beer, then rested his head on Steve’s shoulder possessively.
“It was… Some kind of shock, I guess,” he finally explained. “You’ve been touching me so much that to have it taken away was harder than it normally would’ve been. I didn’t expect that to happen.”
“See, if we cuddle this way, then it’s just like your favorite cuddle position and easier for us both to enjoy,” he suggested, looking down at Tony with a grin on his face. His smile slowly faltered, “do you need some TLC first? That was quite a deep getting to know each other session? Are you sure you don’t wanna cuddle and watch the original trilogy or something?” Steve asked, “you’ve already wooed me, you don’t have to keep impressing me. I already think you’re really rad.” Steve joked, moving forward to nose boop Tony with his own nose.
He’d dodged his driver too, grumpily opting for a taxi. He got out of the car and immediately bumped into some unfairly enormous guy, nearly falling over. “Dude, what the hell? Watch where you’re walking!”
Steve snorted, oven mitts on as he pulled the lasagna out of the oven. Putting the baking tray down on the wooden, heat resistant surface, he then served it up with a side of rocket leaves, tomato and mozzarella - traditional Italian garnish. He’d tried to be romantic and researched for it.
“I’m sorry if that upset you. I didn’t intend to do that.” Steve spoke softly, nudging the shell of Tony’s ear. “Maybe we shouldn’t meet my friends today. If you want, we can go to an art and craft store instead and I can start work on that portrait I promised you? Leaves you some time to work from home, too.” He suggested, “I wanna say both of us are a little too raw to entertain company after that,”
‘Baby’ twice in two sentences? Tony melted happily, taking Steve’s hand without any sign of complaint.  “Can I wash you too, Master?” The term made him shiver happily.  He couldn’t quite believe what he’d gotten himself into but he wanted to curl up in it and stay forever.
Tony hadn’t expected this to be so intense. He probably should have, since Steve had set up safewords, but it wasn’t something he’d really ever experienced before–someone’s whole attention being focused on just touching him like this. He could definitely feel how serious this was. “Steve? Where’d you learn to do this? It’s… Really nice. A lot. Doesn’t seem like it should be, but here it is.”
“I would. I can get into art.” He left that there for a second, then asked, “Have you ever gotten into the BDSM community, or is your experience with power exchange a bit more casual?” He couldn’t now, but maybe in the future… Steve might be his soulmate. And if he was, who could he possibly trust more?
“I didn’t learn this anywhere. Touch has always been important to my sex life. Combining that with the knowledge you enjoy full skin contact… It was easy to come up with this. I already have so many things in my head I want to try from the things you’ve told me. This is what an attentive sexual partner does, Tony.” Steve explained, his hands running up and over Tony’s ribs as he softly squeezed Tony’s body beneath his hands.
Cap smiled again at Stark's back before seeming to get a hold of himself and go back to pre-mission preparations.
Steve wanted to push him off but felt pinned in place by Tony’s gaze. He could smell the stench of alcohol more potently with Tony's face so close to his. He watched as Tony licked his own lips.
It may have been nothing, just Steve looking out for his teammate, but the knowing look in this Steve's eyes had him doubting himself.
He desperately wished he had some whiskey to numb what he was feeling, but he wouldn't betray Steve like that. Steve had always objected to his drinking. Besides, he deserved to suffer for what had happened.
He had tried to get himself killed by avenging Steve's death and taking on Fisk's men, but he couldn't even seem to do that right.
Steve sat down next to him but didn't speak for a moment, not wanting to spur another fight with Tony by saying the wrong thing.
“You’re part of my team. I’m always gonna worry about you.” Steve said, surprising himself at just how easy it was to voice those words.
Tony cocked his head, studying him for a moment before he shrugged and walked over. Tony nearly tripped over his own feet but managed to sit down with no incident.
He felt the pressure lift off his shoulder before gentle hands turned his face upwards. Tony opened his eyes to see bright blue ones staring back at him.
(Tony ended up buying Steve a ring the very next day. It was identical to the one he had bought for Tony but it was in white gold. When it glinted in the light the color of it reminded him of Tony's armor. Steve absolutely loved it.)
Natasha immediately stiffened from where she was standing. “No. I don't drink.” She said evenly before handing Tony his coke and sitting down without another word.
Tony felt his eyes grow heavier as they continued to watch. Portal hopping really took a lot of you, who knew?
It took a Herculean effort to put distance between them but he did with a smile. Tony smiled back with a nod, face mirroring what Steve felt and the two of them went back down to the lab to initiate the Bifrost and get back home.
Natasha let him go and turned to the portal platform to make sure everything was all set for dimensional travel while Tony turned to Steve.
Tony nodded, eyes drooping closed as he let his head fall back against Steve's chest. He didn't stir again as Steve laid him down on the bed and he felt a pang at that.
Rogers didn't retort for a long moment. “Don't be a dick, Tony. Of course I fucking care.” Rogers admitted in a lower tone.
“We should have a big wedding. The biggest wedding of the century. Oh, that'd make Greg jealous for sure.” Tony said, eyes burning brightly as he envisioned it. He paused, pursuing his lips and seeming to sober for a moment. “But then again, after my last fiasco of an engagement, maybe something smaller and more... intimate would be better.”
Steve took a deep breath and resisted the urge to punch a wall. Jan was a touchy subject for him. “We’re not together.”
Thor was keeping an eye on his brother to make sure he didn't cause any mischief and the others had retired after a while, sensing the need for Steve and Tony to have some space.
Tony was prepared to give Steve a friendly handshake and a brief goodbye but the man had other ideas and Tony was suddenly enveloped in a warm hug.
Steve guided Tony toward his room and Tony groaned happily as he caught sight of his bathroom. “God, I've dreamed about running water for weeks.” Then Tony's face lit up as his eyes landed on the counter. “And my razor. I've needed a shave so bad.”
He’s fine, though.  So his runs may be slightly longer than usual, and he may hit the bag a little bit harder than he probably should.  Everything’s fantastic.  It’s not like he’s pining or anything.
.  Total fantasy films, but you’ll understand so much more of what’s going on around you when you get the in jokes.”  In a way, he’s sort of envious of Steve, getting to experience those franchises all at once.  Though on second thought...
.  Smash hit of 1997, the start of Leo and Kate’s respective film careers, and an impressive eleven Academy Award wins.  You’ve got lots of great one liners in this one: look Jack, I’m flying, draw me like one of your French girls, never let go.  The thing’s full of solid need-to-know info.  Word of warning though, you’re allowed one and only one free pass on the song.  If I catch you singing, humming, or quoting the damn thing more than once, I will not be responsible for my actions.”
“Be careful down there, Iron Man. We’ll be there as soon as we can,” Steve said as he knocked two agents out with one carefully aimed kick. Admittedly, this was a great way to deal with his sexual frustration.
“Nope.” Tony popped the ‘p.’ “You wouldn’t. Wanna know why? Because you’re supersoldier. Supersoldiers don’t deal with this bullshit. I’m just human.”
He heard the Hulk’s roar and he twisted around in time to see a lone HYDRA agent pointing a gun right at Tony and the Iron Man suit was too far, goddammit—
One particularly hard thrust knocked all the air out of his lungs and he collapsed entirely into Natasha’s arms, no longer able to hold himself up. Steve held him steady at his waist, his breaths turning ragged as he poured all of himself into Tony. At last, Steve groaned a desperate “Tony,” and Tony felt him spill his release inside.
Steve smiled brilliantly, relief so clearly on his face, and Tony felt bad for even considering saying ‘no.’ Steve unbuckled his jeans and pulled them down, freeing his aching cock.
“You should talk to him,” Bruce said. “He’s taking things the wrong way. And he’s even more restless than I thought he would be.”
The call came in at 11 in the morning and the Avengers assembled. They were briefed on the situation at SHIELD quickly before boarding the quinjet and headed to Illinois of all places.
Tony moved quickly, squeezing in between Steve’s large form and the wall. He was so close to the exit, and he promised himself that once he was out of there, he wouldn't play with fire (at least this kind of fire) again.
Steve looked around and saw the speakers – giant and looking ridiculously overpriced – sitting in a corner. He swiftly unplugged them and blessed silence filled the air.
“Ah, fuck, Steve,” he gasped into the mattress. He tried to move his hips against the mattress for some friction against his dick, but Steve held him firmly up against his mouth, not allowing him to get any relief. His tongue buried into Tony, forcing him to open up, thrusting in and out in mimicry of what he planned to do. Soon after, two fingers pushed into Tony, and the stretch burned deliciously. He whimpered and undulated his hips in the air, wordlessly begging Steve to get on with it.
“Okay?” Steve wondered, not for the first time, if Tony had lost his mind, watching him continue to wheeze like a dying man. “Are you sure you’re fine?”
“Tony, have you read my email on that new article by Dr. Richards? I was hoping I could hear your thoughts on it,” Bruce said, shuffling into the room. He paused when he saw Tony’s flushed and anxious face staring at him. “Why are you sweating?”
Tony laughed hysterically. “My feelings? What am I, a teenaged girl? ‘Not that hot,’ Jesus fucking Christ.”
“Steve,” Tony whined, but whatever else was going to follow was interrupted by another hard smack on his ass. He jolted forward and took the opportunity to rub his cock against the granite before being pulled back again.
Tony moaned weakly when he felt Steve’s hand circle around his cock. All it took was one sharp tug for his climax and he barely reacted to it, shaking in Natasha’s arms, his mind turning to mush. He could feel Steve slowly pull out of him and he thought about protesting. He wanted to keep Steve inside him always.
It was another fifteen minutes as Bruce looked over every single bone and muscle of each hand. As Bruce finally sighed and nodded, Tony launched himself out of his seat and grabbed Steve to drag him away. Steve managed to thank the doctor before Tony slammed the door of the lab.
He didn’t know what he was doing here. It was fine when it was just him and Steve and Clint, but Natasha’s entrance reminded him that this wasn’t just a fun, one-off event. The Avengers will be expecting him to be with them now, completely, not just on a part-time basis as before. They will be expecting not just Iron Man but Tony Stark too, open with no hesitation in being part of this union. But it will only end badly. Tony had managed to ruin nearly every good thing in his life and he did not want to be the man who ruined the Avengers.
Steve wrapped a hand around the base of his neck and drew him back in, tilting his head to fully settle his lips against Tony’s. There, that was better.
“Imagine, having everything all at once, where I can take you apart, slowly, until all you can think about is how good I’m making you feel. You’d be so lost in the pleasure you’d forget your own name.”
“Good, it’s settled,” Steve said brightly, pecking Tony on his lips before stepping back towards his meal. “We have leftovers from curry last night, you want some?”
“You don’t have to acknowledge him, you know. If you’d ignore him, he’d eventually go away,” Tony piqued up, attention still focused on the holograph of his suit.
At last, Steve surfaced for air and threw Tony a lazy grin. Clint buckled up his pants and shifted to sit at the counter while Steve took his prior place.
If Steve had to be honest with himself, the fact was that he did think Tony was rather attractive. Which annoyed him even more. Insomniacs who cared for no one but themselves and their work shouldn’t be so handsome.
“Are you fucking serious?” he groaned when he saw that damned blown up picture of Steve sitting on his bed. “Are you—Dummy!”
“For the first time ever, Rhodey’s wrong. Because he can’t possibly be—” Tony peered at Steve, as if he had finally realized that Steve was actually here and wasn’t a hallucination.
If it wasn't for Clint’s other arm wrapped around his middle, Tony would have toppled over by now. He moaned and moved between the two of them desperately, the sensations rapidly building, but he didn't want this to be over. He wanted everything they could give him.
His eyes wandered the room and focused on a rather innocently-looking gift bag that sat on top of his dresser. It showed up a week ago; Natasha must have washed the toy for him and situated it where he can see it every time he entered his bedroom. He’d like to say he completely forgot its existence.
Tony’s expression darkened. “Fine, go have fun with your super-secret boy band. I don’t care.” And he stormed off like he was doing so often these days.
Silence. Tony frowned. Oh no, what has he got up to now? For a scary moment, Tony’s brain conjured up the worst scenarios, that the robot fell into the elevator shaft, that he got short-circuited, that his whole personality got wiped—
Steve rolled his eyes. He pressed his fingers to Tony’s entrance, pressing one in lightly, circling the rim. He could hear Tony’s breath hitch. After wetting the outside, he pushed one finger inside slowly, stretching him as carefully as he can. The last thing he wanted was to hurt Tony.
“You tried, didn’t you?” Steve folded his arms across his chest in a pose he knew looked authoritative.
Steve’s own hand was wrapping around his very interested prick and after only a few short strokes he was spilling over his fist. Steve sighed and leaned his forehead against the steamed glass door.
Of course, none of this information succeeded in deterring the robot that was slowly sneaking into the living room.
Tony’s head bobbed up, startled, but he started to grin when he saw Steve. “You know, I’m really thankful for your aversion to shirts.”
“You don’t seem all right. Is something wrong?” He moved closer to him but Tony ducked out of the way so fast that Steve blinked in confusion. “Um—”
“For me it is.” Tony’s eyes narrowed, trying to focus his gaze directly on Steve and failing. He settled the bottle carefully down before flopping onto his back. “Just imagine what I can get done if I was. Maybe How—” He shut up and did his best to ignore Steve.
Tony moaned in surprise which Steve took advantage of, dipping his tongue in briefly before retreating, as if promising more pleasure to come. Steve broke the kiss and leaned back, smirking down at Tony’s shocked expression. “Turns out Rhodey was right.”
“I would if you bothered to show up,” Cap retorted. He glared at him through the reflection but Tony didn’t stop fixing his outfit. He had a very important charity gala tonight, thanks to Pepper’s threatening email reminder, and he didn’t have the time or energy to deal with Captain Stick-up-his-ass.
It was an awkward kiss. Steve’s head wasn’t tilted down enough and so Tony’s lips had landed on his bottom lip and the skin above his chin. They were both too stiff and both of their eyes were open. Tony jerked back after a few seconds.
When Pepper left, he was almost relieved. The suspense was gone. Now it was just him and his ‘what-if’s.
Once Tony was gone, Natasha popped her head out into the hall. Of course the superspy had overheard everything. She said, “In ten minutes my nails will be dry. Then you and me are going to spar. And don’t even think of fucking up my nails.”
Tony moaned again and, to his disappointment, Steve withdrew from his mouth. Before he could complain, strings of come landed over his open mouth and cheeks. Tony gasped in surprise and looked up to see Steve fisting his still hard erection.
Apparently Rogers took an entire 24 hours to ruminate and then came back to the workshop, walking in like he was preparing to go to war, his shoulder squared and all.
Steve shrugged. “Drawing is what I do when I want to remember something good. Make it permanent so I can go look it over again and remember.”
Bucky turned towards the cubicle next to his, where their coworker was trying to ignore their conversation and get some actual work done. “Hey, Sammy, what do you think?”
Tony reluctantly stepped away from Steve and headed towards his closet, patting Dummy on his way. Dummy beeped happily.
Rogers’ face fell. That steady and self-assured way he carried himself disappeared and he folded in on himself. And now it felt like Tony was the one towering over him.
He turned off the plug and stood up to stretch, wondering idly if Bruce had figured it out or if he was just being paranoid.
At those words, Steve’s rocking sped up, his cock aiming at his sweet spot. Tony gasped wetly, tears still streaming, but Natasha held onto him, murmuring words of praise. Tony caught some of the words, like “good boy” and “so pretty,” but he focused on the quickening thrusts inside him, doubts scattering from his mind.
The floor was pretty empty, mostly just storage spaces for the useless inventions he makes when he goes on an engineering binge. He found the maintenance closet quickly, pulling the door open and readying to tease Dummy.
Steve leaned over to kiss his neck and jerked his hips, rubbing fully against that spot inside. Tony hissed and gasped once Steve began to thrust long, hard strokes. Tony twisted his head to the side, eyes shut, letting out soft groans with every thrust. And this was perfect, Steve thought. Seeing Tony like this, face flushed, his sweaty hair sticking up, his mouth formed in a little ‘o.’ Completely open and vulnerable. Only for Steve.
“Yes?” Personally, Steve didn’t think doughnuts warranted that kind of disbelief, but Tony was always rather strange.
There was no fifth. In fact, instead of a fifth, in defiance of a fifth date, Tony sauntered into the kitchen and announced, “Steve, you need to take me to your bed. Now.”
“Now’s not the time, J. If it’s a meeting, reschedule,” Tony said as he walked across the penthouse, heading towards his bedroom.
Steve can appreciate the aesthetic of all sorts of things; he used to be in art school after all. Even when Tony and he were still antagonistic towards each other, Steve noticed and appreciated the beauty of Tony’s hands. The slender fingers and the callused palms, how they moved gracefully, whether he was working on his inventions or gesturing excessively when he ranted, moving as though they were dancing in the air. It caused Steve to notice everyone else’s hands, their shapes and their movements. It made him stare at his own, noting the wide palms and the visible veins wrapped around his knuckles. He compared them all to Tony’s and found Tony’s hands to be the most beautiful. They were like a pianist’s hands.
Right. Of course there must be a perfectly logical explanation as to why there was a huge picture of himself on Tony’s bed, surrounded by rose petals. And why there were more photos on his bedside tables along with white candles. And why there was a video of himself projected on the far wall. A video that was currently showing an unknown intruder entering Steve’s bedroom, zooming in on his unaware and unconscious body.
Tony was late for everything. It was like one of those laws of science, where it was expected to be true every time and if it wasn’t, there was something seriously wrong with the space-time continuum. He was late to shareholders’ meetings, to R&D meetings, to legal consultations, to PR conferences, to charity galas—even his own. It was to the point that Pepper had to lie to him about the time, swearing up and down it would start three hours earlier, and he would still be late.
“Brucie, if I was seriously sick, I would tell you. I promise. I’m being honest that I’m perfectly fine right now.”
Steve laughed. “Tony, when you were avoiding me, I was so worried that I thought I said something terrible to you, something that made you hate me all over again. I spent days trying to figure out how I’ve hurt you. This seems so insignificant in comparison.”
It was still early though. Tony wasn’t fully awake until he got at least two cups of coffee in him. And he was hungover. A few more hours.
“Next thing you know Iowa will be mass-producing asshole archers. Who would have thought?” Tony said. Clint glared at him.
“Well, yes. Otherwise we would be in the bedroom right now.” Tony did a double take. Steve had a very good poker face.
“Uh, never mind.” He bit at his bottom lip and Steve’s eyes tracked the movement. Tony muttered something too low to hear and then gestured at his monitor. “Right now I’m doing the coding for a new OS.”
Which was how Tony found himself drinking imported Italian espresso with Steve Rogers at four in the morning. And while he was still wary, he thought this wasn’t so bad. Just someone’s presence, not even talking but physically being there, it was like a balm. For the first time since the Chitauri happened, he felt himself relaxed. And this…
The AI said, “You told Captain Rogers, ‘I know I must be ugly to look at now,’ in reference to your hands being injured.”
“Stop. This self-pity thing is getting old and it’s my thing, I copyrighted it, I’ll sue you.” It was hard for something with no face to look so pathetic, but Dummy somehow managed to achieve it. Tony rolled his eyes and patted his strut. “Go play a board game with Butterfingers—not You, he gets too competitive. Go, shoo.” He watched as Dummy grabbed Life from the game shelf, smiling a little to himself. He picked up his soldering iron and went right back to work.
Tony waited for the coolness of lubed fingers to open him up, but instead he felt a hot breath before his spread cheeks, and then a firm wetness prodding at his entrance. He gasped and clenched at the sheets, squirming as the tongue licked at his furled opening.
“Ah. You should go think about it then.” He tried to edge past him but then Rogers placed a hand on his shoulder.
Besides he wasn’t truly alone. He had the bots and JARVIS to keep him company. And that was all he needed anyway. People aren’t dependable.
Steve sighed. “I don’t want to accidentally hurt you, Tony, if I get too into it and not realize what I’m doing.”
Tony clenched his hole and was pleased when he was awarded with a sharp gasp. Clint’s hand gripped his hair and pulled his head back, exposing Tony’s neck to Steve’s gaze. Tony struggled to keep his eyes open on Steve, fighting against the impulse to close them. Steve was smiling softly at him, an expression completely at odds with how his pants were open, his hand stroking his exposed dick.
Tony blinked up at him. “…ow.” His hands were still outstretched but were angled in a way that looked unnatural. Steve grabbed them and Tony hissed. “Doubly ‘ow.’”
Steve smiled. “Because they’re you. They helped you create the suit and escape from captivity. ‘Cause they help you every day in your genius. ‘Cause they’re so beautiful and elegant.”
Steve nodded dumbly, wondering if this wasn’t just a dream. But Tony was hot underneath him, writhing against him, pressing his length against Steve’s, and Steve shivered.
Barely a minute after they left, You knocked the board off the table and Butterfingers beeped angrily at him. They both moved away from the table and to the center of the workshop, where they communicated in increasingly louder noises and eventually ended up knocking their struts against the other. This continued for a few minutes until the glass door slid open and Dummy rolled in, the camera still perched on top of his arm. He rolled over to the others bots and waved the camera at them, making enthusiastic sounds.
Tony stared. He was silent for a long time, looking completely flabbergasted. “Wha…? What, what would make you think that? Of course you did nothing wrong!”
The robot made a negative sounding beep. His wheels were creaking slightly as he rolled down a hall and towards the master bedroom, the camera attached to his strut zooming in on the ajar door.
“Yeah, well.” Tony waved a hand lazily in Dummy’s direction before grinning at Steve. “Wow, Rogers, didn’t expect you to be giving a free show,” he said, leering at Steve’s bare chest.
“Hey, did you forget? You don't get to come,” Clint growled into his ear. His rocking quickened into brutal thrusts. From the way Clint clutched at him, Tony knew he was close.
Oh no. Did Tony get hurt while working in the lab? He had a tendency to ignore his injuries, even if they were severe, and several times the team had to coerce him to be checked out by at least Bruce. “JARVIS, am I allowed to go to Tony’s floor?”
Tony slipped away from Steve’s view a few hours after they arrived at home and Steve knew where to find him. A hiding spot was only useful if nobody knew where it was after all.
“Somehow they got some of my old weapons. I thought I’d destroyed them all but—” His whole frame was stiff and his eyes were refusing to look directly at him. Steve placed a gentle hand on his shoulder and he relaxed slightly.
Focusing purely on the physical sensations, it didn’t take long until he was two fingers in, gasping. He pulled out and grabbed the plug, quickly coating it before lining in up with his entrance and—
“And I also figured out that you have a habit of trying to mislead a person during conversation, which I’ll admit you’re very good at. You also have like a roadmap to all of the best ways to anger me.”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony cried out. With the relentless pounding and the slight friction on his cock, he could feel himself tumbling closer to the edge. “Ah, baby, I’m so close.”
Tony whistled. “These guys got some major funding,” he said as JARVIS effortlessly shut down the building’s stealth protocols. “Most of the heat signatures are below ground. Typical.”
“Tony, I don’t understand. I’m not doing anything.” Steve supposed that Tony would lose it eventually, he just didn’t figure it’d be this soon.
“Tony, Bruce said you can cause permanent damage if you don’t let them heal properly. Isn’t six weeks better than a lifetime?”
“Yeah, about that.” Tony smiled sheepishly at him. “Turns out I can’t focus and work as well without music. It’s been taking me a long time and you know about projects’ deadlines. Sorry, honey, looks like you have to take one for the team.”
“No, it isn’t. You always keep the temperature in here at 64 degrees.” Bruce shifted his glasses, considering him. “Don’t tell me you have a fever. I thought JARVIS constantly monitored your vitals and made sure you take care of yourself.” Before Tony could insist that he was fine, perfectly healthy, his straining cock being an example of how perfectly healthy he was right now, Bruce asked JARVIS for his vitals.
So Tony had been avoiding him. Which was fine, you know, it was Tony’s decision. If Tony didn’t want to be friends with him anymore, then Steve needed to respect that. Boundaries. Besides he had probably been annoying Tony too much. Tony was always working and he just took up residence in the workshop, not caring if he was a distraction. Really, Steve should have realized this. Just because they weren’t at each other’s throats like back at the helicarrier didn’t mean that they were the best of friends.
Tony could hear a short exchange on the other end of the line, muted as Jim must have been talking to a fellow officer. After a pause, Rhodey said in a regretful tone of voice, “I have to cut this short. Sorry, something’s come up.”
A few days later it was Movie Night and the Avengers ordered in from their favorite Chinese place. They gathered in the communal TV room to watch the Indiana Jones movies.
The one-story base was hidden in a rural part of the state, its location cloaked and invisible to radar and plain eyes.
“We managed to escape,” came another voice and shit, Tony really did have the worst luck. Steve sauntered into the room and grabbed an apple from the fruit arrangement, because of course he did, that all-American boy. Probably believed that adage about keeping the doctor away. Steve smiled at Tony as he cleaned the fruit with his shirt, lifting the fabric just enough that Tony could see his clearly defined abs.
“What, he has a porn dungeon now?” Tony laughed, imagining Dummy with magazines of scantily clad women. He exited his workshop and went into the elevator, wondering what Dummy got up to in his spare time.
He steered Tony towards the couch where Steve would usually sit and draw, and forced him to lie back and get settled. Tony drifted off to sleep soon enough, snoring softly. Steve smiled and took his sketchbook from a side drawer, flipping it open to a fresh page.
“But Steve, specifically? While he was asleep? Unless he’s been doing this to the other Avengers.” Though Tony would love to see Dummy try to record Natasha. Did that spy assassin honey trap ever sleep? Of course, if Dummy had been trying to record her, he’d be dead already and Tony would have to avenge the dumb bot. Or something.
“I will. I’m a man of my word.” Tony smiled one last time before shutting the door. Steve stayed there until the music finally faded away, and then shuffled towards his own apartment.
Well then. That wasn’t what Tony was expecting. As soon as he was aware that his mouth was open and he was staring, he schooled his expression into a sneer. “Okay. And? What, did you think I spent these months agonizing over your lack of apology?”
But just as Tony was about to move, he heard a familiar voice call out cheerfully and viciously swore inside the safe confines of his mind. Of all times, this was when he'd get interrupted?!
Instead of replying, Steve gripped the back of Tony’s head as he kissed him passionately. He let go to look back down again, resting his forehead against Tony’s. Steve moved carefully in the lax grip, groaning when Tony pressed against the slit. The sensations were building, and Steve knew if he didn’t hurry this along, this would be over before it properly started.
When Steve looked back at him, he frowned. “How hard is it to get undressed?” He reached over to rip the rest of Tony’s dress shirt, and, when Tony gasped at the brute display, he tore down his pants and shoes until Tony was left in only his red panties.
With a shrug he began to undress, figuring that it was unlikely the spy would find out what he did in the privacy of his room. No matter how good she was, she wasn’t psychic. He tossed the contents of the bag onto his bed and grabbed the barely used bottle of lube that came along with the toy. He lay down in the center of the bed and felt suddenly self-conscious.
JARVIS’ voice sounded exhausted, as if the last thing he wanted was to have this conversation right now. “Dummy has been taking inspiration from television on how to profess love to someone.”
It wasn’t every day where you went looking for your best friend, only to find said best friend in his room with his bots surrounded by images of yourself. Yeah, it was that kind of day.
“This is bullshit,” Tony declared when Steve entered the workshop. He was sitting at a workbench, glaring at a piece of armor that Dummy was trying to work on. Emphasis on trying. “My hands are clumsier than his.” He gestured at Dummy and the bot let out a miserable sounding beep.
Steve hummed in agreement, rubbing right beneath the head, watching Tony shudder. He pulled back from biting at Tony’s middle and yanked the jeans and underwear all the way. Tony followed his lead, taking off his own shirt, before pouting at Steve. “You’re still wearing clothes,” he whined.
“Rhodey’s always right,” Tony replied, as if on reflex. His eyes were wide and hopeful and darkened with lust. “I’m really bad with emotions, which is why I’ve waited until now, but I honestly really like you.”
“Oh.” Tony straightened up, wincing as he felt the plug shift inside. He tried to give Bruce a careless smirk and was pretty sure he failed at it. “It’s kind of hot in here.” He flapped his hand in front of his face to illustrate his point.
Their second was watching really bad, cheaply made sci-fi movies, because Steve had not yet been exposed to that horror of this time. Their popcorn got spilled everywhere and Steve had wrestled Tony into the couch in the middle of a tickling war. They stopped, realized how close they were, and ended up making out and ignoring the movie completely.
“If I may, sir, Dummy really did mean this as a way to show you how much you matter to him,” JARVIS said.
Iron Man zoomed past the agents, too fast for them to do much but try and fail to shoot him, and flew down the emergency stairwell.
“Dummy!” The AI’s voice went quieter but no less harsh; in fact if any of the Avengers were present, they’d worry that he was going Skynet, judging by the vitriol in his British-accented voice. “Leave. Now. The Captain will visit the workshop later, and you can see him then. Do not proceed—”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, right when Tony had made it through. Tony forced himself to stop, knowing how weird and awkward it would look it he'd just book it. “You know I can hear it, right?”
Steve couldn’t help but feel disappointed at that. “Hey, Tony, you look like you actually got some sleep.”
“So are you going to talk or are you going to keep brooding?” Natasha said as she checked over her hand for any imperfections.
Little gasps fell out of Tony’s mouth, in time with Steve’s thrusts, but just as Tony was getting ready to tell him to really give it to him, Steve thrust so hard it made Tony’s toes curl. Steve curled one hand around the back of Tony’s neck and pushed him further down into the mattress, causing Tony’s cries to get muffled. He ground his hips, circling inside Tony until Tony startled at a new sensation.
“Oh jesus I’m love.” Steve spoke dramatically. “I love that type of stuff? I mean I’m really into American Chopper style motorbike refurbishment and design, but anything to do with a beautiful looking car as well…” he paused nodding. “Just yes.” He grinned down at Tony, “also the fact you play the violin is quite frankly amazing. I would love to listen to you. If you’d honor me with a performance…” he paused mid-sentence. “Hang on - rewind. Did you say you work on AI technology?” Steve asked incredulously. “For real?”
Steve hadn’t realized that his shock might have caused Tony to panic about Steve pulling away and abandoning him.
“I’m good baby, maybe not too much of that tonight? Just while I’m around?” he asked as politely as he could. “I don’t feel comfortable around people if they’re visibly drunk you know? I care for you but I’m not about to be your carer after our first date.” He established his boundaries, as much as he was prepared to help Tony he needed those boundaries for his own personal self-care.
“I’m not going to be able to share passions with you for a while. I want you to know that. It’s… There’s history for that, but I just can’t. It’ll take time.” He reached over to squeeze his hand again at a red light. “I like someone who’s willing to wait, but also takes the initiative. I like competence. A lot. And I like someone to be bigger than me and kind of soft. Not a requirement, but cuddling is nice that way.” He shot him a little smile, since they’d already discovered how well Steve dwarfed him in a hug. “And I like having attention completely on me when we’re together. Cute accents don’t hurt. Do you like being in control? Taking control? Don’t try to hedge around or lie about this one. I know it’s approaching kink territory, but I just want to know.”
“It would definitely help,” he answered quickly, he was glad to hear that Tony knew it wasn’t him.  “I’m sorry I should have known better than to not let him know I was bringing you home.  It would have gone so much smoother, but I just forgot.” He paused, sighing.  “Bucky’s OCD can get really bad and I’m really shit at remembering things that would make it easier for him.  And I never react well when he tries to make me feel the same way he does.  That’s what the stories were about - he’s just upset.” He ran his hands through his hair, sitting up against the back of the driver seat.
When Tony was in his lap, Steve’s hands instantly skimmed up Tony’s back. He felt the planes of Tony’s muscles and his shoulder blades, he could feel the roughage of Tony’s scars but he was careful not to linger. Moving his palms back downwards Steve began to rub lovingly over the small of Tony’s back.
“Sure you can, so long as you let me cook food for you later, when you’ve finished working. We can have a nice date, in your kitchen and I promise no tears,” he kissed Tony’s cheek.
“Steve, can’t believe you tried to sneak him away from us!” Natasha gushed before hugging Tony--without prior warning or permission.  “Nice to meet you! I thought that damn timer was painted on his arm,” she laughed.  “He didn’t stop talking about you yesterday.” She winked conspiratorially.
“I appreciate you being as accommodating as you can be for me,” he stated. “I’m fine with it on your breath, and with you doing it in front of me. It’ll be really bad for you to think you have to hide your habit from me. I would just prefer if you don’t get drunk around me. Mainly for consent reasons, I am uncomfortable being around a partner if I’m sober and they’re under the influence, even one drink could affect judgement or inhibitions and if you’re needing it around me maybe it would be best to talk to me about why,” he added, with a concerned tinge to his eyes.
“Wanna see all of it,” he responded seriously. “All of it.” Creating worlds… That was so far beyond impressive. “That doesn’t count as a question because it’s yes or no. Boring. Ask another one?” He couldn’t wait to show Steve his house. The holograms and JARVIS and… Fuck, it sounded like he’d love all of it.
“Come to my bedroom, honey, and I’ll change for you.” He stood up, then took both of Steve’s hands. “As long as you’re okay with this?”
“Cheeseburgers and bad Chinese or everything green smoothies and dried fruit. It varies widely. Mostly, I eat whatever’s there.” He really didn’t want to talk about his trust issues or the very real possibility that he’d be subbing for Steve in their future for any longer and he was glad for the change of subject to grasp onto. He might’ve also been making a concentrated effort to drive Steve away though, since he chose to share another bit of personal information most people didn’t like to deal with. “Bipolar disorder’ll do that to you. It’s okay if you’re a health freak. Maybe it’ll rub off on me.” He smiled and took a slice of the pizza to bite into.
“Yeah ‘course I am.  And if Obie yells at you I’ll kick him in the face,” Steve replied, blissfully unaware of who the fuck this person was but still equally sure that Tony was not going to be facing any nasty repercussions for helping out this evening.  Steve tangled a hand in Tony’s drying hair, twirling it as he thought about how happy he felt.  He drifted off without really realizing he hadn’t finished the conversation.
“Oh yeah? Like anyone would believe you had a girlfriend with me on your arm all the time.” He laughed again and squirmed a little away from the poking fingers. “You really want to have your soulmate’s name spelled wrong on your body forever? And it should be daffodils. I really love daffodils.”
“I think that might be your trust issues talking to me there. But I’m not about to invalidate your opinion just because my experiences tell me otherwise. How I see it first is you have to have the confidence in your partner to care for you first. From there, you build up how to care for each other. But giving your partner that trust before you start is crucial. A lot of people mistrust at that stage or don’t trust fully and then it can all fall apart,” Steve explained, “BDSM can bring you and your partner closer or help pull you both apart.”
“Whisper to me in another language,” Steve demanded, his hands falling down to rub the small of Tony’s back lips and tongue nibbling and sucking against the soft and sensitive parts of his neck. “Can’t talk about belonging to me in a language I understand – it’s too big a thing for me to tease me with.” He informed Tony clearly.
.  If anything, Tony shown him that Tony knew what was best for him and that was so very special.  And so very rare.
“Aww, honey.” Tony desperately wanted to just stay in bed with Steve, but his poor sleepy soulmate didn’t deserve to deal with Pepper coming in just because he didn’t go out to meet her. But it
“Nope, you’re doing good. If it helps, his camera is here.” That was the closest thing the bots had to eyes. Tony let Steve toss the ball and then chatted with JARVIS a bit, using Steve to help him get used to differences in voices and speech patterns. Then, eventually, he moved closer to throw his legs over Steve’s lap and kissed his cheek. “Come cuddle with me upstairs?”
“Of course we can work baby,” Steve reassured him. “I promise I’ll always try my best to make sure any arguments are resolved. If anything, the fact we’re both still here, calm, and waiting to enjoy breakfast is evidence we can do this. We’ve been going at break-neck speed, even some couples who’ve been together years couldn’t handle being this intense so soon. I’m really not… aiming for that - it’s just happening. We have some new level kind of chemistry I’ve never experienced before, so we’ll do what you said, open communications and just roll with it. I’m sure we can do it. I don’t give up on anyone easily either. Mistakes will happen; I’m not going to judge you for them,” Steve held Tony’s hand tightly giving it a gentle squeeze in return. At that point, the waitress returned their drinks and food. Steve handed Tony his before tucking into his own.
“I promise, first night you stay with me at my house? I’ll spend all night dedicated recreating your beauty in my personal sketchbooks.”
“I’m surprised you’re a dude, I’ll be honest.” Steve answered bluntly, the sincere and soulful gaze felt like it pierced through every steady nerve Steve had. “Why wouldn’t I want it to be you? You have this whole scruffy cute thing going on,” Steve tried to compliment Tony, a soft blush dusting his cheeks.
Steve laughed at Tony’s disgust in his choice of language. “Why don’t we do all of them.” Steve smirked. “That’s if you want me to stay late?” There was a shy smile on his lips. He nuzzled along Tony’s cheekbone. “‘We’ll move when you’ve had a little rest,” Steve moved his hand to pet Tony’s hair, inhaling deeply, taking in the soft scent of Tony’s shampoo, cologne and laundry soap. He hung on tightly to Tony, keeping him close.
“I didn’t even consider treating you any differently, sweetheart.” He continued, “I don’t think you don’t understand yourself at all because your limits were pushed. And I’m 100% okay with you never sceneing with me, let alone taking time and I would have been before I knew this too, promise. I’m shocked. That’s all. And mad that it happened to you. You’re mine, baby, I don’t like the idea of anyone treating you that way,” he cuddled Tony close, his arms protectively embracing any amount of Tony’s body they could grab.
Steve laughed. “Sure baby, I’m easy. Whatever you wanna do. Shall I text you my address so you’re not any later than you need to be?” Steve asked, a smirk playing on his lips. He felt elated, he must have made a good impression for Tony to call back so soon. Since Steve’s clothes weren’t ideal for a meal, he figured he would need to change - again. Refresh, definitely.
“I mean. That wasn’t the intention, but I love them anyways.” They were the pure ones. He was pretty sure his face could be seen from space at this point. Steve could probably feel the heat coming off of him. But he just chewed the inside of his cheek and pulled back onto the road. “You’re… How did you become so amazing? I can’t… I’m not even sure that I care if you’re playing me right now because you’re doing it so damn well and… I meant it. About giving you whatever you want. I don’t care how incredibly reckless that is. I want to keep you.”
Tony looked down at his phone when the call went silent and then shoved it into his pocket. He had to focus on this expo thing for at least an hour.
“Oh god no!” Steve replied hugging Tony close. “I’m not about to run away from you because someone else was a shithead.” Steve tried his best to reassure Tony. “I’m just so angry someone treated you that way, I’m so sorry if that came across as being mad at you. I’m not mad at you at all,” he nuzzled Tony’s temple, kissing it softly.
“No! No team ups!” He did squirm and giggle and he batted Steve’s hands away from the sensitive spots.
Steve chuckled.  “Mmm, don’t you start with that shit again, it’s all fine when we can run to your bedroom equipped with en suite.  Do I gotta start carrying a cock ring around in my car in case you start getting the urge to speak to me in five different languages, huh?”
Steve smiled, “I always feel humbled when looking up at the sky, it’s the sense of perspective I find incredibly soothing. But you’re right, there’s a lot of danger out there,” he snuggled closer to Tony.
“Gluten free is medical, naturally.” He smiled, “recently got the chance to get a diagnosis. Vegetarian is because I’m not a huge fan of meat for protein, I use other substitutes that are healthier. It took a long time to get control over my body so now I take good care of it. Not a health freak or anything, it’s just nice to be on top of my health for once. What about you? Do you have a favorite cuisine?”
Steve had great difficulty getting dummy to model. In the end, he took a reference picture instead, and took a 30 minute break to play catch with him. Steve had recorded a few bloopers on video to show Tony later. He knew he’d have to delete them right away because of the NDA he signed, but he just knew Tony would want to see his bots being adorable.
Steve shrugged “it’s more like - I’m seeing how obvious it is in language that everyone equates sexual fulfilment to happiness, that’s all.” He hummed, “I mean you catch me being all heteronormative - not that I am, but I could pass as it if I was with a girl. But yeah, if I was that in people’s faces they’d get annoyed - why should I treat asexuality any different? I’m genuinely curious,” he asked as they walked towards the section with all the classic cars parked and gleaming.
Once Tony had changed Steve couldn’t help but lick his lips. Tony looked so incredibly gorgeous, almost like a dream. “It’s like Aphrodite themself has appeared before me,” Steve spoke, barely aware of his words. “Come sit on my lap, lemme worship that beautiful body of yours,” he garbled desperate to run his hands over Tony’s skin. He’d undressed himself so he was just in jeans and socks, similar to the previous evening together.
Steve laughed again, he couldn’t help but adore this sweet nature Tony had. It had blossomed out of nowhere but Tony was clearly so loving. It was sad to think anyone had ever invalidated that part of him.
Tony leaned back more so he could turn and kiss Steve’s cheek, then asked gleefully, “This is one of the most romantic moments of your life?” He brushed Steve’s hair out of his face and traced the edge of his ear with one finger.  “That’s so so sweet.”
“I’m free later for you,” Steve stated confidently, “I don’t have any allergies but I am gluten free, real sweet of you to check in with me, baby,” he emphasized the pet name, chuckling a little.
Steve went a little more red. Not that he outwardly looked uncomfortable - the bluntness was probably what took him by surprise. “Yes I have and am in the BDSM community,” he responded, “but I don’t - I have strange attitudes towards it. I don’t think it’s something for new partners to indulge with. To be safe to the best of your ability you need to trust completely first. And you need to give that trust consensually, not coerced or forced into doing so. I take it… control and power over another human very seriously and I see a lot of other people being careless and abusive with it which unsettles me deeply. I think… you know, its a way of going deeper. Once the relationship has gotten well established.” He tried to be careful with his articulation. “You need to have formed boundaries together before you can identify what they are,” he shrugged a little.
At Tony’s protest Steve winced, “I see it baby, don’t worry.  You’re safe with me, remember.” Steve slowed the car as they waited in the red light before turning off onto the freeway.
“Like what? Cuddling you? I trust you. I know that probably doesn’t make this better for you, but I trust you and I’m… Not worried about you pressuring me into anything. And it is about you. It’s as much about you as it is me because both of us are here. But I won’t ask you to take care of me when I’m drunk, honey. Not ever if you’re uncomfortable with it.” He leaned forward and pressed a quick kiss to Steve’s lips. “You haven’t upset me. Worried me a little, maybe. But that’s okay. We’ll figure it out.”
“I’d be responsible for your safety. I need to know how to make scenes so they’re enjoyable for you.” He paused. “It sounds like you’ve been so unsafe with yourself…” He looked at the blush on Tony’s cheeks. “That’s not a bad thing, but no one should have been so cruel to take advantage, this isn’t your faul--it’s your partner’s faults. They should have checked like I am checking now. It’s disgusting not one of your sexual partners has done this,” he looked shocked, he felt a little sick to his stomach. “You need to be sure of your boundaries, and if you’re unsure you need the appropriate help to test what you want, what you like, to find those boundaries.” He shook his head a little in disbelief.
Tony twisted and panted beneath him as Steve opened him up, his fingers tangling in the bed sheets. It wasn't long before Tony was urging him on, telling Steve he was ready.
Steve knew a dismissal when he heard one but he steeled his shoulders and made no move to go. “I'm not leaving.”
It was only a moment before Tony succumbed to sleep but Steve didn’t dare move an inch for fear of Tony pulling away and out of his arms. Tony got little sleep as it was and Steve would be damned if he hindered Tony in that endeavor.
He was about to roll over in favor of going back to sleep when he heard the low whine of a repulsor above him and his eyes shot open. There was a striking woman in a three piece suit with black hair and bright blue eyes standing over him. The gauntleted hand was steady and aimed at his head.
“Tony. I said that I love your hands.” He caressed the left hand before pulling back. “Apparently I was more obvious than I thought I was, because you’ve noticed me staring before.” Tony was giving a wide-eyed, terrified look, like he was a rabbit waiting for its demise. “I had been planning on telling you the day we had our last HYDRA mission. And I was going to tell you after, but it didn’t seem like the right time and I didn’t want to stress you out even more.”
He grabbed the near empty bottle and took it over to a cabinet where the liquor stock was kept. When his back turned, he heard a soft murmur that would have been inaudible if not for the serum.
“Then why don’t you stay here for a bit? I have Chinese takeout in fridge, or at least I did a few days ago. It might still be there. You know, if you’re hungry. Midnight snack.” Tony shrugged in a faux-casual way and Steve realized for the first time that his presence made Tony nervous. Huh.
“What am I supposed to say? ‘Hey, looks like my robots and my AI have a crush on you because they learned from watching me drool over your abs and it made me realize how much I fucking love you?’ How is that remotely okay?”
As Tony struggled out of his shirt and jacket, Steve opened his bedside drawer to grab the half-empty bottle of lube. Tony warmed at the sight, at the undeniable evidence that Steve wanted inside him, and he shivered in anticipation.
Dummy gestured at the ceiling and then to the bed, where Tony noticed a small device not unlike a tablet was sitting next to the picture, propped up on the pillows. “Yes, Dummy,” came JARVIS’ weary tone and a hologram appeared at the far wall. And because someone must hate Tony, it was playing that fucking video that Dummy made.
Just when Tony thought they were reaching the apex, his thighs shaking with the strength of Steve’s thrusts, Steve stopped abruptly. He ran his hands soothingly down Tony’s back and into his hair, but he stopped giving Tony what he needed. Tony was shaking with the force of his release being denied once again, eyes watering, but Steve ignored it all, holding entirely still inside him.
“Well… yes.” Tony groaned again and slumped in his chair. “That is how adults would normally act in these situations.”
The toy was still moving inside him, and though he felt sore, it wasn’t entirely unpleasant. He reached the control with a shaky hand and turned it off.
“But that’s mean.” Steve took a quick whiff of the drink before settling it down farther away than before. “He’s just trying to be helpful.”
“You know,” Buck said, “I’d let you sleep at my place. But the truth is Nat and I would definitely keep you up with all our noise.”
Rogers was standing by him a moment later, leaning against a table, arms loose by his side, like he was trying not to cross them over his chest and now they were hanging there all awkward. “Stark, we haven’t seen you all week.”
One of Rogers’ most admirable and annoying qualities was that the guy just won’t quit. He was possibly the most stubborn person Tony had ever met, which was quite a feat when you consider the company Tony kept.
Tony moaned and sank down into the bed, only his hips being held up by Steve’s tight grip. Steve filled him up, bottoming out, and held for a few moments for Tony to adjust before rocking slowly.
Tony was too busy staring at Steve’s hands and didn’t answer until Steve repeated the question. “Uh… I don’t know. A week or so after you started hanging out here… Why do you like them?”
Natasha turned to give him a sharp look. After a moment she chuckled almost silently. As always it seemed Natasha knew something he didn’t. “Maybe you should just talk to him,” she said.
You let out an irritated-sounding beep and Tony ignored him. He stood from his chair and pointed at the bots. He said, “All right, you two, go make sure Dummy takes down that shrine. I
“Appreciate!” Tony spluttered. “I’m not a stalker like you, Dummy, what the hell were you thinking? Why’d you give candles to You? Was You supposed to light them afterwards because I swear to God—”
“Tony,” her voice called softly. When he didn’t respond, he felt her hands curl around his jaw and force his head up. “Please, look at me.”
Clint leaned in to stare at Tony’s hands. “Wow, they look so grody. Man they’re gonna be so swollen, they’re gonna look like Mickey Mouse gloves.”
A short silence fell in the room before Clint broke it. “He must really be frustrated that he can’t masturbate anymore.”
Except now Tony didn’t look hurt. In fact Tony looked completely fine, except for the fact he looked completely terrified like he was expecting Steve to hit him.
For example: no mention of Dummy’s creepy obsession with him. At all. Steve seemed to think Tony’s a great guy, and he’d like to keep it that way. If Steve knew, he’d move out of the tower immediately and find a little cottage in Iceland or something.
Dummy was making his way over, his stupid camera still attached. The bot tapped Tony’s shoulder and whined. “What do you want?”
This was his chance though. While Clint appeared impenetrable, it looked like Steve let his guard down enough that Tony could get through and run down to his shop. They couldn't disturb him if he went into lockdown.
And then Steve complained about Tony for another 15 minutes, the end of which his rant drifted off into silence as Steve noticed Bucky’s grin was slowly widening.
Rose petals? While Steve was aware that Dummy favored him a great deal, rose petals were not what he was expecting. Nor that heart-shaped balloon. He said, “Is Dummy trying to make romantic gestures towards me?”
“Right.” Steve was trying hard not to grin. So far he was failing. “Let me distract you from that no doubt very important toilet. I still have some leftover pancakes. If we hurry, maybe Thor and Clint haven’t eaten them all.”
He leaned against the door frame and leered at Steve. “Well, hello there. Am I being invited to the gun show?”
“Hey, Cap, you’re looking very good, very healthy. All that cardio.” He reached out for Steve’s bicep before remembering himself and pulling back. “Uh, science! Right. I need to go do science now!”
“After that god-awful Sandra Bullock movie?” Tony gasped. “You aren’t mine, I can’t have possibly created you.”
Tony turned to give him a sort of terrified look and Steve wondered what he’d done to make Tony look at him like that. “Why would we need to talk? I thought everything was… peachy keen?”
Tony stopped, exhaling harshly. He reached down and gripped himself at the base of his cock. He wanted this to
“Am I supposed to automatically accept your apology? Is that why I’m an asshole? You’re not any better than me. I know you probably tell yourself that every time we interact, but just ‘cause you wear a flag it doesn’t mean you’re morally superior to me.”
Steve straightened, quickly pulling off his own clothes, and raised an eyebrow at Tony. “Better now?”
“Steve.” Tony grasped the side of Steve’s face and turned him to look him in the eye. He offered a reassuring smile. “I want to focus on the here and now. We can talk about what happened before later, but I’m sober now and I want you. I really do.”
There was a pause before JARVIS said, with a hint of reluctance in his voice, “He’s in the maintenance closet one floor below you.”
“Do you want it?” Steve asked again, seriously. And Tony knew that if he said no, they’d all finally leave him alone and would never bring it up again, and Tony could lock himself up in the shop and work in peace.
“Really, I’m good, everything’s good. Just not used to waking up at this time, you know how it is, and why are you wearing a sweater in the middle of summer?”
“Let me live in my delusion in peace, seriously. You know, he’s probably straight anyway, he’d punch me in the face if I proposition him. He’d be really offended if I implied that he might be—”
Tony could feel Steve moving closer and then his large, warm hand found the curve of his ass again. Tony braced himself just as the hand came down, hard, enough that he knew his skin was bright red. The hand paused long enough to grope his cheek, before spanking him again.
“Sure, I… guess.” Maybe that was Rogers being polite. Maybe he wanted to talk to Tony about the new upgrades to the suit. Maybe the material wasn’t as light and flexible as he thought.
Steve laid him out in his bed and kissed him before returning to the kitchen to help Clint make food for when Tony woke up. Tony shivered, missing the body heat, but Natasha, wonderful Natasha, wrapped him in a soft blanket and spooned him, brushing his hair back.
As Bruce had predicted, Tony’s left wrist was broken, with several smaller fractures in the bones of his fingers and palms. His right wasn’t broken but there was damage to the tendons and muscles. Soon after Tony was admitted to medical and the X-rays confirmed the damage, he was admitted into surgery.
After a moment of basking in post coital contentment, Steve withdrew and tied the condom, leaving the bed for the bathroom. He came back with a warm, wet cloth and wiped the come from Tony’s abdomen. “So what was that about me not delivering?”
Tony gave him a withering look. “You really expect me to do nothing for six weeks? I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but my hands are everything to me.”
Tony groaned and leaned back in his chair. Most of the lights in the workshop were turned off except for the one in the hallway. All his computers were in standby mode and his projects were tucked away for the time being. His arc reactor illuminated the space in front of him in a light, calming blue. He was literally sitting in the dark and pining miserably.
“It’s okay, buddy, I’m not mad, just surprised,” he murmured, rubbing his hand over Dummy’s arm. Dummy relaxed, leaning into the touch. “Yeah, no more rom-coms for you. Come on, let’s go work on something together, me and you.”
And Tony just stared. At the huge picture of Steve. At the table covered with a dozen candles. At the sweat-dampened T-shirts littered on the floor. At the Captain America merchandise.
“So what do you expect?” Tony said, his voice hoarse and weak. “You think I’m just going to tell you everything. You’re going to be my therapist now? Prescribe me some Valium? Don’t worry, I got the self-medication part down.” Then he winced. That sounded weak and pathetic, even for him.
Right now Dummy was rounding the bed, moving closer. He focused on the drool, the bedhead, the naked back, the long blond eyelashes. His wheels rolled to the left while the camera took a long shot over Steve’s entire body. The camera then zoomed in on the lower half, on the backside covered by thin pajama pants.
Tony’s hands come up and clench in his hair, fingers grasping tight against the already messy strands.  He lets out a harsh sigh, and then turns to face Steve.  “Sorry, that was...that was out of line.  It’s just been a rough day.”
But that answer will not get him assigned to field work, so he answers dispassionately. “I’m fine. I would tell you if anything was seriously wrong.”
For a moment, he thinks it’s going to work.  The blue light emitting from the reactor prototype glows brightly, casting the surrounding area in an iridescent sheen and reflecting off the metallic surfaces scattered around the room.  A steady buzz fills the air as a
To say Steve is surprised would be an understatement.  They’ve always kept their interactions to the lab, mainly because that’s where Tony spends most of his time, so he’s never really experienced all that much of the rest of Stark Tower.  He’s certainly never been inside what looks to be Tony’s bedroom.
Clint quickly catches sight of them and motions for the group to follow, and Thor’s deep bass opens the conversation.
Whatever Tony sees in his face settles something, because one he’s staring into Steve’s eyes with a question, and the next he’s pulling Steve toward him.  Their lips meet with a quasi-violent crash, but once Tony has a moment to adjust…
Tony breaks first.  “She’s not wrong,” he concedes.  “We sort of have been, just not the type of dating that I have any experience with but possibly might like, considering how everything has gone so far even though I still don’t know if that counts as
Tony has no frame of reference for this, and thus it’s not entirely his fault that his brain can’t send a viable message to his mouth.   His thoughts are still buffering.
“Nope, that’s not going to work.”  Stark’s speaks quickly and assuredly, and Steve looks up in surprise at his unexpected statement.  “Look, I know all about being benched, and it sucks.  I haven’t exactly appreciated you stalking my every move for the past few weeks, but that doesn’t mean I want to sentence you to
Oh, shit.  Yup, that could be…bad.  Although he’d like to think that a sentient Iron Man statue could hold his own.  He very nearly gets into the mental conundrum how an animated statue Iron Man would match up against the real deal, when he finally takes stock of what Steve said.  Steve didn’t specify himself or Thor or Hulk as the greatest threat.  He pinpointed…
He catches Natasha and Clint standing near the promised van with a few other agents he doesn’t recognize.  Drawing the bike to a quick stop, he hops off, jumps into the empty van, and quickly starts changing into the uniform.
“Be that as it may,” Steve replies, “SHIELD is still our best deterrent if something like this occurs again.  Are you really going to leave them unequipped when the next catastrophe occurs?”
Steve winces as he thinks to the plethora of statues dotting the park.  If memory serves, there’s a statue of the 107th Infantry near the south end of the park.  The soldiers have bayonets.
“Yeah, but I haven’t ever seen a model like this.  SHIELD must’ve gone all out for you, you lucky dog.”
Tony pulls out from behind the barrier the moment that Steve finishes counting.  He doesn’t even bother to glance at Steve, since Cap’s going to skewer that thing or die trying.  Instead, he waits for the telltale flash of brown wood, using that as his signal to fly forward and grab the crazy stupid electro-thing that he still has no idea why they’re fighting.
for texture.  The entire spray is wrapped in some sort of florist’s tissue, which crinkles as Steve extends his arm.  That visual does nothing to explain the presence of said florals.
It all comes bursting out in one sustained rush.  “You get to have someone that knows both sides of you, the hero and the human and accepts them both. None of the stuff that we do is going to take Natasha by surprise. She’s a part of it. Hell, she’s behind most of it. So if you’ve found someone doesn’t just tolerate what we do but
“What are you, some sort of indie director?” Tony muttered, ignoring the camera lens shoved into his face. This new hobby of Dummy was irritating but at least he wasn’t going trigger-happy with the fire extinguisher. Though this was easier when Steve was the subject of Dummy’s new art project. “The least you could do is give me some coffee. I don’t even know why I keep you here; should’ve kept you in storage.” The camera was thrust even further into Tony’s space before he slapped it away. “Hey, I’m working here!”
“Not in the way that you think. Dummy holds you in high regard and wished to make some sort of gesture. He appears to have taken inspiration from TV shows and films on how to apologize to a loved one.”
“You’re so desperate for it,” Steve said, in a tone of voice that would be better suited to talking about the weather. He pressed Tony back down to the hard surface, running a light hand from the base of his spine to his head, curling his fingers into his locks. Tony whined again but Steve shushed him. “Don’t worry, I’ll give you what you need.”
Clint guided him over to the counter and directed him to bend over, presenting himself to both of them. Tony twisted in time to see Steve standing up and reaching into his own pocket, passing it over to Clint. The entire time Clint didn't stop moving the toy inside Tony. Now, Clint stopped the vibration and pulled the plug completely out of him, leaving him achingly empty.
Tony licked his lips, his eyes moving restlessly from Steve, to their position, to Steve’s crotch and back again. “So are you just going to stare at me or…”
“That works for me,” Steve said. He knew he probably looked stupidly happy, and that this was simply two friends eating together, totally platonic, totally not a date, but he couldn’t help it.
Since the whole Chitauri business, Hulk had become incredibly protective of both Iron Man and Tony. If they’re in a mission and Hulk cannot see Iron Man at any given moment, his anxiety builds and the Hulk loses focus of the enemy. Right now Hulk had stopped in the middle of battle and his wild green eyes met Steve’s steady blues.
“Hulk, you did good by protecting Tony,” Steve said. “But maybe next time don’t push him so hard? He is delicate.” Tony scoffed.
He realized it was even more arousing to be outside of his private rooms, on the communal floor, engaging in this dirty wrong thing in the places where the team hung out. Like this kitchen, for example. No one could ever be alone in the kitchen for long, someone else always wandered in search of food, at all hours of the day. And though he knew no one else but him would be here for the day, there was still that anxiety that someone would intrude unexpectedly, see Tony with his back to the refrigerator, rutting his hips back--
“That’s the plan.” Steve pushed Tony onto the bed, hovering over him. “Do have any idea how long I’ve wanted this? How I’ve fantasized about this?” Then he hesitated. “Are you sure your hands are all right?”
The robot had recently developed a (fairly distressing, according to Tony) hobby that JARVIS can’t help but blame Captain Rogers for. One day, about a month ago, while Tony was busy working on a new prototype bow for Clint, Steve was sketching with his charcoal. Dummy was by his side, having brought a now-forgotten smoothie (which the Captain politely took a sip). The robot had let out a series of questioning beeps that pulled Steve out of his work.
After thrusting it in a few times, he pushed until his skin met the base. With a pleased sigh, he reached for the control and inspected it. It had only a few buttons, one being the power button and the other with a rather mysterious symbol. He turned it on and the plug came to life with a gentle vibration. He pressed the other button and the vibration increased, along with alternating pulses.
In response, Steve let go of his cock and curved his fingers until they were touching that spot. Tony moaned, his hips jolting.
Steve peered over the table to see Tony lounging against it with a bottle of scotch in his lap. “Tony, what are you doing?”
“If I was braver, I’d done this when I first met you. Throw you on a table, in front of SHIELD and the Avengers, and had my way with you. Make you and everyone know you’re mine.”
Steve settled down on the floor across from him. He gave him an assessing look. “Tony, I know it must be awful for you. Hell, I’d probably be angrier than you are—”
“You know,” Tony said with a sort of fake cheery casualness, “that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting to get a different result.”
Steve looked amused at the sight. “Were you hoping to go home with someone tonight? I doubt you wore these for me.” Steve caressed the lace that covered Tony’s cock with a gentleness that was uncharacteristic of him thus far. “I appreciate the view anyway.” He leered at Tony, no doubt staring at the smeared semen still on Tony’s face.
Steve hesitated when he saw Tony was staring at the opposite wall. Looks like Project Sweep Tony Off His Feet was postponed once again.
It didn’t happen every night, but it happened often enough. Steve was beginning to seriously think about wearing earbuds to bed, which pissed him off to no end.
“Well yeah. When I walked in here and saw your bed, I thought you were getting ready for a self-loving session. And I got jealous of my own photo.”
With an exaggerated sigh, Tony turned back to his floor-length mirror, fixing his bow tie in the reflection. “I really don’t have time for your macho posturing,” he said. “Why don’t you save that for the debriefs?”
The time period between Pepper leaving and the Avengers moving in was too short though. He should be happy that he was no longer drifting in such a large, empty space. It was strange, to wander into the kitchen at midnight and find another person being similarly kept awake by nightmares. That silent empathy and understanding. It really shouldn’t come as a surprise that he stopped venturing outside of his workshop, only interacting with the team when it came to missions and debriefings.
He shook his head as he pulled the sweater on. It’d probably got mixed up into Thor’s laundry again; it’s happened before.
Tony tensed immediately again. His eyes glanced to the side and Steve knew he was going to lie, so he added, “Why don’t you skip the bullshit and tell me the truth?”
Clint snorted. “Yeah, I don't know how you thought you could lie to him. By the way, Nat’s very pleased.”
“Now, what do we have here?” Natasha grinned as she slinked in, still in her uniform and effortlessly beautiful as always.
It was approximately four days of Tony locked in his workshop and two weeks of Tony’s hands in casts, and Steve was entirely sick of it all. Instead of trying to plead with JARVIS like he had the other times, he marched in with his shield and broke the glass partition that was darkened so not even Steve could look inside.
“Could’ve been worse,” Nat said. “You could’ve broken your spine and been lying here paralyzed and unable to talk.” She paused. “Actually that doesn’t sound that bad.”
And as for Tony’s feelings, well, he could lie and bluff and deflect like he normally would in embarrassing situations, but the thing was he wanted it. He wanted Steve. He wanted to be in a relationship with the guy and do all those corny, lovey-dovey things couples do. After his failed relationship with Pepper, he figured he’d never have a shot at real love again. But Steve actually liked him for some weird reason, and he would laugh at all of Tony’s dumb jokes like they were the funniest shit he’d ever heard. And sometimes Steve would look at Tony with his blue eyes and Tony would think that maybe he feels it too.
Two weeks passed and Steve’s frustration tapered off into weariness. When he was awoken again, by Glenn Danzig this time, he didn’t bother with the indignation and instead went to Tony’s place again. He let himself in, figuring knocking would be useless, and found that the door was unlocked.
“No, I know you now. It seems like something dumb you would do.” Steve reached out and wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling him closer. They fit together perfectly and Steve leaned in to steal a quick kiss. This thing between them was new and fragile and Steve was thankful, thankful that he was getting to know and understand this wonderful man. Tony was smiling shyly up at him, as if he knew what Steve was thinking and was in full agreement. “How about you leave the music to daytime hours?”
“Excuse you,” Tony said, waving a screwdriver at Steve’s amused expression. “In case you forgot, I’m in charge of a multi-million dollar company that’s the leading research in clean energy, along with being in this little superhero club and having to update all of your gear and weapons while still working on my new armor and—”
Tony glanced up once Steve entered his workspace – his expression brightened instantly and he greeted Steve with a grin. He leaned towards his desktop and lowered the volume of the speakers enough so they wouldn’t have to shout at each other.
Hulk leapt forward and pushed Tony away from the gun before pouncing on the agent. The agent had no time to react and was defeated with no bullet discharged.
He could see Steve approaching him slowly, like how one approaches a skittish animal, and yet he stayed rooted to the spot. Steve stopped, way too close to him, and gave him another endearing smile. And without warning, his arm reached around Tony and caressed his ass, feeling the plug through his jeans. His fingers traced the base and moved over his plump cheeks. Before Tony could even think of relaxing, Steve smacked him hard, right against the plug.
the first date. All right, you’re giving me a dangerous case of blue balls, I might be hospitalized, you need to fuck me before that happens.” Tony moved closer and fluttered his long eyelashes. “Save me, Captain.”
The coffee supply in the workshop was running out, even the iced drinks in his mini-fridge that he saved for emergencies. It meant he actually had to resurface from his hole and grab more from the kitchen. Since the team moved in, Tony conducted a series of experiments to conclude which were the best times to go to the kitchen with a low chance of coming across his teammates. The answer was that there were no best times. He had to pop in randomly and pray to a higher power.
He placed a tentative hand around Steve’s shaft and leaned in to lick at the head. He stroked the base of Steve's cock and licked the head again.
“Yeah?” Steve grunted. He squeezed his hand around Tony’s neck and Tony gasped, feeling light-headed. “You look perfect like this, sweetheart. You’re gripping me so good, so tight.”
It was hard to look at him in those too blue eyes, in the face of all that righteous fury, but Tony forced himself to. He won’t be bullied that easily.
By the end of this, I had realized that Dummy is a stevetony shipper who was very happy to see his two favorite persons together and that his meatball-dorito photo collection was well and thriving. I expect he got his own tumblr after this with the help of his brother JARVIS.
For the first time since Rogers came in, Tony turned to look at him fully. Rogers’ eyebrows were furrowed in all his patriotic concern, the edges of his mouth creased and his jaw clenched. As if he picked the short end of the straw and had to come and coax the resident genius into playing family with the rest of the Avengers. Tony scoffed. “One, you don’t know me. We’ve known each for how long? Three months? Two, don’t bother trying to play the considerate captain and save yourself the energy.”
After that Steve had to deal with an irate Tony coming out of anesthesia and before the pain meds kicked in.
Steve added some lines of details to the background before noticing the time on his watch. “Have to go, Tony. I promised Nat a sparring session today.”
One afternoon had him sitting on a stool at a workbench in his shop, grinding his hips against the seat, staring at the blueprints JARVIS had projected for him. He was trying and failing to focus, his cock hard and leaking, and he was considering whether to get himself off then or prolong the sweet torture. He steepled his fingers against his temple, breathing slowly.
.” Tony crossed the room in seconds and grasped Steve’s biceps tightly. “Yes, there is a problem. There are lots of problems but this here is a problem, a problem I don’t know how to – Steve, let me ask you. Why are you here?”
Tony shakily inhaled at the thought.  He had only ever experimented with the toy; he'd never actually had someone inside him. And though he was nervous, he wanted it. He wanted it badly.
He swept all the photos into a container with a handle, where he’ll take them to be recycled. He settled the framed photo against the wall, with the back facing the room, so that maybe his creator will be less creeped out. The tablet went back into the table drawer. He gripped the container’s handle firmly and picked it up.
“You used to love them.” Steve stared at Tony in shock, but Tony wasn’t looking at him. Or rather he was refusing to look at him. “I noticed, y’know. In the shop. Or when we’re relaxing in the kitchen. You stare at them all the time. And it really confused me, but, I don’t know, you liked them so…” He shrugged. “And now they’re ruined.”
Bruce stopped, giving Tony a piercing look. Tony held his gaze in what he hoped was a neutral expression; the low vibration was still going on in the plug and his cock hadn’t flagged at all. “All right,” Bruce said at last, his countenance turning from suspicious to downright cheerful. “I see you’re busy right now. Read that article I sent you and we can talk about it over lunch.”
“Come on, let me help.” Steve wrapped one arm around Tony’s middle and stretched one useless arm over his own shoulders. “Don’t worry, Tony, there’s a nice, comfy bed at SHIELD medical with your name on it.”
It was about four in the afternoon when Steve realized that it didn’t look like Tony was going to address last night any time soon.
“Don’t worry about it. It’s not like I was drunk every single time I had sex. Well, I was drunk every time I was with a guy, but whatever, that’s past and – Steve? Steve, babe, you okay?”
“No. That first night I honestly didn’t know what time it was. But then you came by to complain and, well.”
“Tony!” For a scary moment, Steve wondered if Tony had overheard him and Natasha. But judging by how fidgety Tony was, and how it looked like he was trying to figure out a way to leave the situation politely, Tony was probably too focused on avoiding Steve to realize what they were talking about.
Hulk was hovering close by. With the HYDRA agent dealt with, Big Green was standing there deflated with eyes downcast.
Steve knocked on the door and, when that didn’t get him the desired result, banged his fist down. And he kept banging the door until his neighbor opened it.
“That’s where you’re wrong.” He stepped closer to Rogers, leaning right into his space, ignoring the fact that he had to look up to meet his eyes. “Everyone wants something from someone else. You want me to spend more time with the team since you’re the captain and think that makes you responsible for everyone. You feel guilty over the fact that I’m now a recluse. You want to rectify it. You don’t actually give a
“Come on, Steve,” Natasha gently chided. “What did I tell you about learning to share? We’re all getting turns.”
“Tones, I can’t just drop everything over here ‘cause you say so,” Jim replied, his voice warm despite the admonishment.
“Listen, I have very important work to do. Like unbelievably important, like shit that’s going to revolutionize the way people use technology for generations. And my music helps facilitate it, keeps me focused. Now that you know that, are you really trying to destroy humanity’s future?”
Once most of the agents were handled, Steve nodded at Natasha. “Widow, take care of things here? I’m going to check on Iron Man and Hulk.”
He headed back to his floor for a shower, even though he was not sparring long enough to work up sweat. And while his showers were short and quick, he lingered. As Nat would say, he was compromised, even when Tony wasn’t in the room. And it all started with his hands.
“Tony.” Steve even directed one of his signature ‘I am Captain America and I am disapproving of this’ looks at him.
Sparring was a welcome distraction from his current dilemma. And he did not doubt for one second that Nat could see something consuming him. Nat was scary like that; she probably knew about Steve’s problem before he realized it himself. Fifteen minutes later he found himself on his back with the famous Black Widow hovering over him, glaring at him. “Not your best,” she said and then gave him a meaningful look. Of course, Nat, message received. She got off him and let him stand to his feet.
And that was that, really. Steve didn’t see much of Tony for the next week or so. Not that he wanted to see him, of course. The guy was a complete dick and was too full of himself. It didn’t matter if he was very handsome with a full, luscious mouth that was just begging to be… No, there was no point in entertaining those kinds of thoughts. They were two neighbors with different lives going their separate ways. They were probably never going to interact with each other anyway.
“Seriously, you’re making me depressed.” Dummy lifted his arm up to look over at Tony. “Don’t give me that. All right, I miss him too, but he’s got SHIELD work, he’ll be back in another week. Damn needy robot.”
As Steve later found out, when he confronted his landlord, Tony had paid a rather hefty “noise fee” and so now Mr. Kennedy was willing to look the other way. And the rest of tenants had suddenly quieted down their own complaints, though Steve thought he had a pretty good idea as to why.
“Eh,” Tony said, still trying to catch his breath. “I’ll give you a 7.5 for technique, 8.1 for effort.”
Steve grabbed Tony by the lapels of his outfit and threw him into the bed. “Get undressed.” When Tony stared at him in shock, unmoving, Steve snapped, “Now, Stark.”
Steve blinked and relaxed when he saw it was only the robot. “Dummy?” he asked in a surprised tone. “What are you doing here?” Dummy began to roll back and forth frantically. Steve watched for a minute before looking at the ceiling. “JARVIS, why is Dummy in my room?”
“Take care.” When the call ended, Tony pulled off the headset and set it and his empty drink on a table. He was free for the afternoon: he signed all the paperwork Pepper emailed him, he visited R&D and scared the newest recruits, and he managed to finish the schematics for an updated SHIELD body armor. He had earned a well-deserved break.
It was Thursday, also known as Avengers movie night. As was typical for this night and most others, Tony was busy with new schematics, all the noise in his head quieted and focused on his R&D work for the company. A new Starkphone model, intent on ruining the other competition with its new innovative user interface, intuitive and futuristic. Pepper would love it.
“No, I’ve believed the bone to be fully healed now.” When Tony looked ready to escape the room, Bruce added, “Of course, it couldn’t hurt to take more X-rays to make sure everything is in place.”
Being freed sent Tony into a coughing fit, but just as he finished luxuriating in his breaths, he was pushed back onto the cock. These thrusts were kept shallow but Tony knew that Steve was aiming to get back into his throat. While he anticipated that, he sucked at the cock, laving his tongue over the head, humming along the entire length, pulling all the stops he knew. He was ready this time when Steve pushed down his throat. He moaned at the heavy, hot weight in his mouth and grounded eagerly into his hand.
There was a beat of silence and Tony said, “I know this looks bad, but this isn’t what it looks like.”
“Yeah. I figured they just got mixed up with Thor’s again. Weird thing is it’s just my shirts. My pants are all there.” He shrugged. “It’s all right though, I’m not that hot.”
“Do you remember what we talked about last night?” There. That was a good way to ease into the topic.
After an uncharacteristic pause, the AI said, “It seems Dummy became inspired by Captain Rogers’ art and wished to emulate it in a different medium.”
The weirdest thing was that the AI seemed evasive and uncomfortable when he answered. “He is… in his bedroom, Captain.”
“I’m sick of your bullshit, Stark. You always do whatever you want, never caring about anyone but yourself. I think it’s about time you learn your lesson.” Steve’s tone was even and almost neutral, if it wasn’t for the blazing fire in his eyes. His grip was firm but not tight enough to leave bruises, and Tony almost wished that he would lose control for once.
“Just keep it down,” Steve grumbled. He strode stiffly out of the apartment and refused to acknowledge the snickering behind him.
“Isn’t that a meme? No, wait, you’re doing it again.” Rogers rubbed his temple with one hand while the other one was still firmly planted on Tony. “You don’t owe me anything, Tony, I know that. But I also know that you put this front where you pretend everything’s all right. I want to start over, and I really do worry about you…. I know you have nightmares.”
Natasha was next to him, painting her nails dark blue while watching a documentary about bears. She barely acknowledged when he sat down next to her with his book. In fact, this was how most of his time spent with Natasha went. Sitting down and quietly enjoying each other’s company. It was rather calming.
They’d spend sleepless nights like that, and Steve would sometimes go straight to Tony’s apartment after work. Tony would work and Steve would lounge in another chair with his sketchbook and charcoals. It became routine, something that Steve looked forward to every day.
Tony Stark simultaneously hated and craved solitude. It was a contradiction, like many other aspects of his personality. He was full of himself and yet thought he was the worst person alive, no better than a cockroach. He thought himself a genius, yet knew that he really knew nothing beyond algebraic formulas.
What? “What?” Steve said out loud. He turned back to see Tony had his eyes closed, chin tipped up towards the ceiling. “Tony, I heard that. Don’t act like you said nothing.”
“Didn't think you wanted me there,” Tony gasped. What was once a pleasantly mild sensation morphed into an intense vibe, pulsing quickly. It was hard to think with the sight of Steve looking up at him, licking his lips.
“Seriously?” Tony sank further into his cot, staring at the ceiling. “You guys are supposed to be on my side.”
“Do you want us, Tony?” Steve said, as he lowered himself to his knees. He reached in Tony’s pocket and grabbed the remote before he could react. He handed it silently to Clint, who didn't tear his eyes off Tony. “Because we want you. Desperately. We all do. We all waited for you to join us, but you never did.”
“This is wholly unnecessary,” Tony said, glaring at the splints his hands were in. “I’ve had broken wrists before. And I was able to work just fine. But you’re telling me I have to wait at least six weeks?”
“First, Clint’s going to fuck you. And once he's done, I'm going to fuck you.” Steve kept stroking him, lightly, not enough to get off. “You're not allowed to come until we’ve both finished.”
The first time it happened Steve was more confused and frustrated than angry. He thumped his head against the pillow, staring blearily up at the ceiling as the loud, fast-paced music pulsed throughout his bedroom. For a moment he thought his alarm clock was lying and that it was six in the afternoon, because why else would one of his neighbors be playing Metallica at full volume right now? He groaned as he sat up, running a hand through his bedhead hair. It must be the new neighbor – a few days he noticed a moving truck parked in front of the apartment complex when he went to get his mail. No one else in the apartment building was enough of an asshole to wake everyone up at two in the morning.
“Seriously, Steve. You are too sympathetic to him, you know he’s just a robot, right? Not even a good one.”
“Tony,” Steve said, “We can handle it without you, don’t worry. If we really need Iron Man’s help, then have JARVIS pilot the suit. But I won’t let you get yourself injured intentionally.”
“Uh…” Dummy continued to beep excitedly. “Well, I like it. I find it soothing…” Steve looked down at his drawing. It was Tony, bent over his work table, tongue sticking out, focusing on his holographic schematics. “And it helps me keep good memories.”
It wasn’t like Tony was lonely, not like he used to be. He now had a team, which was taking some getting used to, and he knew if he wanted company he could take the elevator down to the communal floor and seek a teammate out. (Though he often felt a bit flat-footed, especially with the arrangement the team now had.)
Tony laughed. “Seriously? What do you want to hear? That I—I’m so pathetically in love with you that my robot noticed and adopted that behavior in a way less subtle way? That it’s not just Dummy, but Butterfingers and You and even JARVIS that are fond of you? That JARVIS has been on my back all week to put a move on you and that’s why I’ve been avoiding you this whole time? Dummy set all this up because he knows I’m an absolute goner for you and he wanted to give me something nice for taking care of him because for some reason that’s the way his stupid programming works.” Tony’s eyes were anxious as they scrutinized his face. “Look, if you’re going to punch me, just do it.”
And Steve was frustrated, so very much. It wasn’t like he could just pack all of his things and move out; not to mention that the idea that
Butterfingers and You forgot their quarrel and gathered round Dummy, as he connected the camera to Tony’s main computer and a holographic interface popped up. It showed a blue-tinged video of Steve in the gym, pounding away at a punching bag; he paused momentarily to glance at the camera. “Hey, Dummy, how are you?” He patted the top of the camera before moving his attention back to his exercise.
“He’s mine,” Steve said. He suddenly ground his cock deeply into Tony, against his prostate, and Tony stiffened back up and moaned at the wonderful sensation. “I wanted him longer than either of you two.”
And there he was. Shirtless, on his stomach, mouth open, a fine line of drool lingering on the corner of his lips and ending on the pillow. Dummy made a soft, high beep before focusing his camera on the sleeping man.
“I was actually f-fine,” Tony said, wondering if he can sneak his hand into his pocket to where the remote was without drawing attention. If Steve could hear anything, he gave no indication. “Uh, I was actually going to back to my workshop, get started on that new SHIELD contract.”
He tapped his arc reactor absently. “You know, it was easier with Pepper. It wasn’t this constant anxiousness when I was around her.”
“And it’s not past tense. I still love them.” Steve moved closer to reach out and take the right one, the one with the exposed fingers, and cradled it. “I guess I was being really unsubtle, huh? How long did you know?”
Instead of responding, Steve pushed Tony’s shirt up, latching his mouth to the skin of his abdomen, his fingers unbuttoning his jeans. He moved the pants and boxers down and grasped Tony in his hand. And Tony was responding beautifully, arching underneath him when Steve gave a long, firm pull.
“What are you talking about? You know how comfortable the sofas are? It’s like resting your ass on a cloud.”
Steve woke up promptly at six and left the tower for his morning jog. When he returned to his room, wiping the light sweat from his temple, JARVIS said, “Captain, I have prepared a bath for you with comfortably warm water.”
It was dark on this particular floor of the tower, complete silence, and for once its resident was asleep, instead of spending his hours punishing a punching bag. He was even snoring.
Tony didn’t say anything for a long time. He stared at Steve, his mouth opening and closing like a fish would. At last he said, “W-with me?”
“And I won’t lie: Dummy has been creeping me out lately.” They both looked at the bot, who was so overjoyed at this latest development that he missed the disapproving stares aimed at him. “How did he get the idea for all of this?”
“Quiet,” Steve snapped and the two complied. The team probably thought he was on edge over the mission. And he was but not as much as they figured. This wasn’t the first time the team infiltrated a HYDRA base. Besides, just before the call, he was readying Tony’s breakfast, planning on making the resident genius eat before confessing. He had the ensuing conversation all planned out too. Tomorrow, he thought miserably.
Steve bobbed his head a few agonizing times before he leaned back, letting the head of the cock rest just inside his mouth, before pulling off entirely. He gripped Tony tightly, and Tony moaned as his orgasm was staved off, unsure whether to feel relieved or disappointed. Clint kept moving the toy inside him, angling it away from where Tony really wanted it.
. “Want to know what I think? I think you're afraid of us, of this. I think that you believe you don't deserve this. That you’ll be what ruined us. That's not true. We don't want you to be alone anymore. Tony.”
“Think you can put your mouth to better use,” Steve said evenly, before shoving Tony down to his knees. Tony stared, dumbfounded, as Steve zipped down his pants and took himself out, stroking his cock in anticipation. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
He wasn’t too sure how he was going to explain his odd behavior to Steve. Sure, he could lie like always, but Steve didn’t deserve that. Steve deserved the truth—a very abridged version of the truth, but the truth nonetheless.
“Dummy, this is the first time in weeks Captain Rogers has slept so soundly. Go back to the workshop, Sir is going to want a cup of coffee soon.”
Tony wound a hand into Steve’s hair to pull him back down to his mouth. The elevator doors opened to the penthouse and they stumbled out, never letting go of each other. Steve cupped Tony’s ass with both hands and pulled him even closer, grinding their lower bodies together. Tony groaned into his lips and walked backwards in direction of his bedroom, taking Steve with him.
“How are you?” Steve whispered, his hand running through Tony’s hair. Steve was always thoughtful and considerate, worrying about everyone, even Tony, even when he was being a jackass.
Steve chuckled, turning back towards the extravagant tub that had ample room for a super soldier. “JARVIS, that’s cheating.”
“No underwear,” Clint noted, as Steve took him into his mouth in one smooth motion. Tony gasped. “I don't know which would be hotter, you wearing nothing, or maybe a nice pair of lacy panties. Red,” he said with a grin as he moved behind Tony. “Definitely red.”
“Me? What? Never better. Peachy keen. Actually, you know I’ve always wondered who would say ‘peachy keen,’ I mean I guess you would, like that would be your thing, but what’s so keen about peaches?”
Steve was tempted to shove his way inside the apartment and break the speakers, politeness be damned. “Can you turn it down, like way down, or put on some headphones?”
He could feel saliva beginning to escape the corners of his mouth and tears well up in his eyes, but he focused on the weight of Steve and moaned around him. He crowed internally when that resulted in Steve’s breathing turning harsh and quick, and just when he was getting woozy from the lack of oxygen, Steve let him go from his death grip on his hair.
The next morning when Tony woke up hungover, he grumbled and muttered lots of nonsensical things that Steve was fairly certain were gibberish. He nodded dazedly at Steve, who was still sitting in the chair next to the couch, and moved towards the elevators to get to his room. And later Tony showed up to the kitchen with sunglasses on, still muttering and glaring at Clint, who was threatening to consume the rest of the coffee just to fuck with Stark. Tony finished his breakfast, flashed a quiet grin in Steve’s direction, and returned to the workshop.
Tony blinked after him and the workshop door swished close. That was a complete 180 than from what he expected.
Steve was about to say more, but saw Tony’s eyes were blinking often and slowly, as if trying to hold out on sleep as long as he could. “I think we should continue this conversation when you’re sober.”
“Well, that was before this whole weird obsession thing was going on. And You has anger issues, like seriously, what’s his problem with ice cube trays?” Tony shook his head. “God, worse than Bruce, at least Bruce has a reason to be angry.”
They did get that fifth date. And a sixth, a seventh. And honestly, it was driving Steve crazy, having to force himself to pull back every time their kisses became too urgent, too purposeful. Tony would paw at Steve’s crotch, his hands useless, and it would have been funny if it wasn’t so frustrating. Steve would be half-attempted to just agree with Tony’s proposal of an “appetizer.” But the fact was he had been fantasizing about their first time for so long, he refused to let it be some quickie. That would be later.
At the no doubt dejected expression on Steve’s face, Tony hurriedly added, “If you give me a few hours, I can finish it up and we can have some dinner?”
“It’s not about that. You need to listen and follow the rest of the team, not go out and do your own thing and leave everyone in the dark,” Steve said.
had to leave, he who had been a perfect tenant, who was responsible and considerate to others. And now he had to face sleepless nights and dozing off at work the next day. None of this was fair.
“If you’re done with your caveman routine, can you help me take him to his room?” Natasha said, pressing soft kisses to Tony’s mouth. Tony groaned but couldn’t find the energy to kiss back, too exhausted and too floaty to make the effort. Natasha didn’t seem to take it personally; she only smiled at him.
Afterwards, when the two Avengers were gone, Dummy was cleaning up Tony’s room. His brothers had gone back down to the workshop and JARVIS was not nagging him for once. He left the rose petals and the candles, figuring that later that night his creator might find use for them, like in the movies.
Tony kept his promise and finished the schematics for R&D five minutes to seven. He just needed to change into something that wasn’t a holey Slayer shirt and ripped jeans, fix his hair a little, maybe some cologne, and he’d be totally ready for his not-date. Because this was a platonic outing between two best friends. Totally.
Okay. Okay, Steve can work with that. Because at least that meant that Tony didn’t hate him. He smiled. “Maybe we can go out to eat and figure it out together? I’ve barely seen you all week.”
“Never better.” And that set off a whole new round of giggles. Then Tony left the kitchen, without his coffee, leaving Steve incredibly perplexed.
He wanted to resist, but couldn’t deny ignoring the request of her sweet voice. He blinked blearily at her, finally letting his tears escape down his face. Her face blurred in his vision.
With that, Tony turned back to his bed, scanning his nightstand for his favorite pair of sunglasses. Of course, by the time he arrived fashionably late, the sky would have darkened enough that the use of sunglasses would be unnecessary, but he wouldn’t let that stop him. He hoped that the venue would be serving caviar and not supplying boring finger sandwiches or that would be all that the guests be complaining about—
“See, that’s the problem!” Tony let go of him and spread his arms to indicate the room. “This is all a big problem and I don’t understand why you’re here. You’re a smart guy, Steve, so what are you doing?”
That was the best thing about doing these scenes together, Tony thought. While Tony absolutely loved the roughness, the hard fucking and the edging into pain, his favorite part was always after when Steve treated him like something precious, acting so protective and nurturing. It was when he felt the most vulnerable, never wanting to act like he needed the attention by always craving it.
. He wanted to go to the living room, sit down where he was last time, touch himself and imagine the whole team there, watching him,
Tony flapped his hand in the direction of the night table to the right. Steve managed to find the bottle and a condom and was squirting the lube in his fingers when he froze. “Wait, you have done this before, right?”
One day Steve arrived at the apartment with a box of assorted doughnuts from Tony’s favorite shop. The crooning vocals of Sebastian Bach were yearning for his love and how he’d die for her kiss. It was a rather different mood of music than Tony would usually play. Steve set the box down and headed to the fridge for a beer.
Huge floral arrangements sat on both bedside tables, extravagant, the kind rich people would buy for 200 dollars. There were multiple balloons tethered to his bedpost, one of which a big red heart with the words I LOVE YOU printed on the side.
Their fourth was Tony modeling for Steve’s sketches, which very nearly turned into a reenactment of that one scene in Titanic. (They got interrupted by a red-faced Bruce who had accidentally walked in. Then again the two should know better than to get frisky on the communal floor.)
“Fucked my face?” Tony supplied cheerfully. “Nope. And don’t give me that look, I know you enjoyed it.”
Steve looked up from his sketchbook. He had been down here in the past hour or so, waiting patiently for the conversation that never came. Tony was talking to JARVIS, verbally describing additions to the holographic schematics in front of him. Steve took a deep breath and stood up, walking over to sit next to Tony on the other stool. It took a few minutes, but Tony became aware of his presence and turned towards him.
“You don’t… have to rub it in my face,” Tony managed to say, squeezing his eyes shut. He was so red he could feel his ears were hot. Steve soothingly rubbed at his tensing shoulder, still rocking steadily with a perfect rhythm. Tony barely registered it, though, becoming wrapped up in his thoughts again.
The restless thoughts that previously occupied Tony’s head were quieted. He only felt floaty and grounded, as Steve rested his weight carefully on his back. After another moment, Steve leaned back up, releasing his grip on Steve and caressing the bruises that began to form on his skin.
The guy’s expressive brown eyes blinked slowly at him, as if he was surprised to see Steve standing there. He looked to be in his early 20s, with unruly dark hair and a grin that could charm anyone he wanted. He wore a baggy shirt that hung off his slender build, exposing his neck and collarbone. Steve tried his best to ignore his own thoughts, which were urging him to consider other
The tower was quiet and serene, and Tony was enjoying a peaceful late morning in the kitchen without Clint to annoy him. Some days had passed since Bruce nearly caught him, and today Tony was the only Avenger currently in the tower: somehow, at the same time, everyone else was occupied. Thor was visiting Dr. Foster (apparently they were still dating, though they both liked to sleep around, which was cool, more power to them) and Bruce had left for Stanford for the weekend for some national radiation research conference. Natasha, Steve, and Clint were all at SHIELD for some super spy bullshit, Tony didn't really know, he wasn't listening when Steve was talking. That wasn't what was important.
It had crossed Tony’s mind that he was playing with fire by wandering around the tower with the toy in. Despite his college days, he wasn’t actually much of an exhibitionist. But he couldn’t help the little thrill he got by working in his shop, or even talking to an employee, with one hand in his pocket on the remote. He kept the vibrations to a tease most of the time, but increased it occasionally, wondering if he could come in front of someone without them realizing it. He’d always get too nervous about it in the end, but it was fun to fantasize.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted. “It’s fine. It’s not that big of a deal. Just, I don’t know, that’s weird even for him.”
The mission was much the last two times they’ve dealt with HYDRA. Get in, destroy their weapons stockpile, retrieve any information from their computers, and eliminate the base. They stormed the first floor to find two dozen HYDRA agents waiting for them, alert from the moment the stealth protocols were shut down.
He leaned over to the nightstand to grab the lubricant and slicked up his fingers. Tony kept whining, trying to urge Steve to hurry, to stop teasing, you cock tease. A single finger plunged into his entrance shut him up pretty quick.
He took a shuddering breath and straightened up, a bit wobbly. The living room would be the next stop.
“Aww, come on, Tones,” Clint said, moving into the room. He stopped at the opposite wall from Steve, at the other side of the island, blocking off Tony’s escape route. “We left so we can spend time with you.”
Tony reached up with grabby hands and pouted exaggeratedly when Steve made a quick detour instead to the bathroom. He returned with a damp washcloth and tenderly cleaned Tony’s groin and buttocks, but before he could pull away, Tony pulled him down into his arms.
“Don’t deliver, huh?” He bottomed out and stopped again, checking for any signs of pain. Tony only looked irritated, so he guessed it was fine. He withdrew a bit and pushed back in, pleased to find Tony not as tight. “That works,” he said, almost conversationally. Then he gave a hard thrust that made Tony keen.
Steve entered the bathroom, tugging his clothes off, hoping this time they wouldn’t disappear (his shirts have gained the distressing habit of disappearing, he should probably look into that). He reached inside the shower for the handles, but the water didn’t pour out.
Steve did. At those powerful hands that have taken such abuse. From what he could see peeking out from under the casts, they were swollen and still bruised a light yellow color. They were stiff and the four fingers uncovered by casts looked tired by the way they limped. He wanted to grasp them in his hands and rub them and kiss them better.
The day came when Bruce summoned Tony into his lab and Steve tagged along. Tony was waiting impatiently, his leg bouncing, while Bruce took off one splint and turned the wrist carefully. “It’s stiff,” Bruce commented. “You’re going to need to do daily stretches with your hands. I’m sure JARVIS can find instructional videos.” He pulled gently at the fingers, massaging the muscles as he went.
Tony didn’t reply. He managed to grip the fork enough, but when he reached for the food his grip fumbled and the fork fell to floor. He pushed the takeout box into Steve’s hands and stormed out of the room.
It seemed as if every time Steve entered a room and Tony was there, Tony made quick excuses to leave. Like “oh I just remembered I have a huge stack of legal documents to sign and Pepper will castrate me if I don’t get them done.” Or “I need to prepare for this very important shareholders’ meeting, you know how it is running a corporation.” Basically any task Tony hated doing and would avoid like the plague. Yet Tony would rather do them than spend time with Steve.
Once the captain was gone, Tony turned his table back up and with fake casualness asked JARVIS, “So, why was Dummy recording Capsicle while he was having his beauty sleep?”
The wheels kept rolling until it hit the bedside table. The wood shook, an old picture frame fell over, and the lamp crashed to the floor.
Steve nodded and moved to the other end of the room where most crates were situated. They worked in silence and Steve felt almost relieved. Maybe he won’t wait until tomorrow to tell Tony. Maybe he’ll do it right after debriefing and it’d be better that way, really, and—
