Even with his own ass in the crosshairs, Dean still jumps away from research like he’s allergic. He’s not sure he’s even surprised anymore.
He loses the better part of an hour or two carefully scrutinizing the records they’d found so far. Aside from one or two magically imbued objects documented in surprising detail, many of the others barely had a line or two explaining anything beyond when it had been acquired.
“You just did,” Kevin says, just as he’s reached the door. Sam stops in front of the hall, fists clenched.
Dean chokes, coughing as he tries to dislodge the food that went down the wrong pipe. He thumps a fist against his chest a couple of times, eyes watering.
Dean groans even as his ears heat up. “Man, I've told you before that you can’t use that word to describe other guys, or me for that matter.”
For a guy who’s happily survived on frozen food and takeout and had no qualms about the people around him doing the same (Kevin’s own diet had suffered as much as other college-aged kids’ would, minus the college part), this sudden explosion of cooking is weird, to put it mildly.
The brothers glance at each other, silently communicating. Well, more scowling from Dean and exasperated tiredness communicated through eyebrows and pinched lips from Sam. It’s more boring than amusing, honestly.
Dean's in the middle of searching the living room for hex bags or spellbooks, so far finding a fat load of nada, when he notices the sound of music coming from the other end of the house. Giving the room a quick once-over, he adjusts his grip on his gun and follows the soft strains of music towards their source, which turns out to be the kitchen. The witch in question is there, humming along to the radio while washing dishes.
“Good afternoon,” the guy rumbles back, and whoa, that’s a gravelly voice. Did the dude have rocks and wood chips for breakfast? “And no thank you,” the guy continues, “I’ll manage.”
“Guess you guys finally talked things out,” Sam says awkwardly, making Dean stiffen up. He can’t seem to decide whether to shove Cas back like it’d erase the last few minutes from Sam’s memory or just keep holding on to him since they’re already busted, and ends up doing a hilariously twitchy mix of both. Cas, for his part, slowly turns to look at Sam evenly, though the nice little rosy hue on his cheeks doesn’t help with his attempt to look unaffected. The slightly husky quality to his voice (and god, Sam is actively trying to not think about why his voice is at a lowered timbre) doesn’t help either as he says, “Something like that.”
“I see,” Castiel replies, mostly to the floor. He needs- he needs space, to think, or what he doesn’t know yet. He takes a few steps backwards, bumping into the shelf behind him.  Sam winces. “Wait, Cas-”
“I wouldn’t blame you if you were mad, y’know,” Sam says, leaning against the door and watching Cas’ back. He watches Cas’ shoulders rise and fall as he takes a measured breath. “Pretty sure Dean and I deserve it.”
“Alright. But no running off, okay?” Sam tells him. Dean nods enthusiastically, holding onto Sam’s arms as he’s hoisted out of the cart. He wanders off immediately, flitting from shelf to rack, but manages to stay within sight. After a few minutes, he comes bounding back to Sam excitedly, narrowly avoiding tripping and falling flat on his face in his excitement.
“Well, I’m beat,” Dean says, faking a yawn and a stretch. “Don’t forget to clean up and feed Crowley.”
And that’s why it can’t happen, why he can’t breathe a word about it to Cas. He’ll repress it deep down with all the other shit he’s repressed until it kills him or he dies.
Sam’s steps slow as he wanders into the war room. Cas, who’s been following a few feet behind him, weaves around him to take his usual seat at the map table.
He’s disappointed but mostly unsurprised when Cas shakes his head. “Sam mentioned taking a break today since we’ve been making good progress.”
“Come in,” Sam says, moving aside to let him in. Cas does, idly glancing around at the room as Sam closed the door behind him. It’s about as sparsely decorated as the other rooms in the bunker, so there’s not much to see. Sam knows an avoidance tactic when he sees one.
Castiel nods, feeling a sort of humorless amusement at the statement. He watches Dean relax infinitesimally at the gesture.
He manages to succeed in keeping that thought process internal even with Cas turning to squint at him like he can read his mind.
On the off-chance that they weren’t, Rick himself would be willing to try his luck… if his friend wasn’t around to catch him trying. He does
He’s not too deep in his wallowing to not notice when Jack suddenly hunches over a few feet away, hands to his head. They’re both far enough away from the small crowd that Dean’s the only one who’s noticed Jack’s reaction.
“What?” Dean says, loudly. Castiel looks up at the interruption, taking in the confusion on his features. “I dunno what she did playing with your noggin, Cas, but you never killed me.”
Dean runs both hands through his hair, yanking at the short strands. “This is- this is absolutely fucking useless. I’m out.”
“Yeah well, I haven’t changed that much over the years, so you can quit tryin’ to refresh your memory. ‘Sides, I’m not much to look at,” Dean mutters, losing the battle of maintaining eye contact with Cas.
“Merry Christmas, Cas,” Dean says, loud enough that only Cas hears it. Cas’ smile at that is smaller but no less happy, the crinkles around his eyes deepening as he stares at Dean.
Dean’s busy texting Sam for updates on the survivor relocation efforts when there’s a sudden palpable shift to the room.
“Yes, you are.” Castiel says, earnest in a way only he can be for such a stupid conversation. The blush that had been fading away comes back with a vengeance. Dean has no clue how to respond to that really; he could try telling Cas he isn't supposed to be saying stuff like that to other guys, but it wasn't exactly inappropriate, just stupidly genuine like he’s prone to being.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for that to happen,” Castiel says sincerely and a little awkwardly, trying to meet Dean’s eyes. His expression is wary still, even as his arms uncross, his closed fists resting against the counter.
He feels pulled along with the music, socked feet sliding him across the room, book in hand. He deposits it on the shelf he stops in front of, turning back around with a smile playing on his lips.
“You bet. I’m the reigning queen of Moondor. And you-” she says, leaning forward to tap him on the nose, “were my handmaiden.”
“Dean can’t have any ice cream until after his throat infection is gone,” Sam reminds him. Cas doesn't stop frowning, though he’s at least toned down the glare a few notches. “I promise we’ll take him out for ice cream once he’s better, okay?”
“You’ve got no experience with kids,” Kevin points out, just in case Sam had forgotten, “so I’m just covering my bases. Figure you’ll learn something out of it before we get them back to normal.”
Sam inclines his head in a half-nod. “That’s what I was texting you about earlier. It’s a bit of a reach since there’s not a lot of lore on it out there, but the hand mirror you guys found
Being in a relationship was the closest thing in their lives that could resemble ‘normal’ and it’s never worked out for Dean whenever he’d tried. Trying to give up the hunting life didn’t really change anything, so it stands to reason that Dean himself was the deciding factor. If he did try again with Cas against his better judgment, it’s bound to fail. And that’s assuming Cas wants it too.
Sam watches, amused, as Dean seems torn between preening or blustering and waving off the compliment. Instead of responding, he decides on gulping down half his beer and digging into his own dinner.
“Did you find some records that said that’ll work?” Sam asks patiently, knowing what the actual answer was likely to be. As expected, Dean doesn’t respond, lips pressed thin into a pout, and drops his hand with a quiet
The memories of those ‘trial runs’ churn Castiel’s stomach unpleasantly, the faces of those dead puppets superimposing over the present Dean’s face far too easily, making Castiel look away. “She made facsimiles of you and had me… practice, until she was sure I could kill you without hesitation.”
As much as he hated witches, Cas needed to start getting some practical experience on how to handle them. Escaping Purgatory had taken a pretty big toll on the guy, tearing apart at his grace and leaving him a step or two up from being human. And seeing as he didn't seem to be in any hurry to go along on his merry way to make a nice little cookie-cutter life for himself (Dean's grateful that Cas is staying, he really is, even if no one knows it), it meant that they needed to build up his hunting skills.
“This weather sucks,” Kevin says the following day, frowning up at the rain pelting against the bunker’s high windows. “Seriously. We managed to get maybe two days since last week
“As much as I’ve been enjoying this quasi-domestic situation, there’s some irony at playing roommates with the two of you, well, four of you I suppose. I assume you can guess where I’m going with this?”
Of course, that didn't mean that he didn't enjoy cases where they had to track down a witch or a coven. Being magically choked or thrown into walls aside, it gave him a chance to rid the world of a few of those damn magical menaces to society.
Cas takes the breather as an opportunity to do more, inching his hand down to squeeze at Dean’s butt and pull him closer. The very, very tiny part of Sam’s brain that hasn’t blue-screened in horror manages to be a little surprised at the forwardness of the gesture; they’d slow-burned themselves through their pining for literal years and apparently that meant slamming forward from zero to a hundred now. Still completely unaware of their accidental audience, Dean groans at the touch, and oh god no, this is reaching brain bleach territory now.
Kevin stares at the kids for a moment, before turning to Sam, brows raised. “Okay, sickeningly cute interactions aside:
“It’s the Empty,” Cas says tightly, not looking away as he slowly backs up, knowing Dean’s doing the same.
“I’m gonna try, but I know my brother; I won’t be able to get anywhere without a plan,” Sam replies. He wasn’t about to tell Kevin that he’d actually tried to the other day. Unsurprisingly, Dean had kicked up a huge fuss at the suggestion. It went down something along the lines of:
Dean’s proud of how well he’s taken care of her over the years for her to still purr as smoothly as she does when he takes her out on the road. But times like these, when there’s nothing really requiring him to be elbow deep in her guts beyond a perfunctory check to make sure everything’s as it’s supposed to be, he learns he can stand to be a little annoyed at himself for his efficiency.
do that again, Dean,” Cas says, lower lip quivering in an effort to hold back whatever emotion was warring inside him.
“Any plans for tonight, darling?” Balthazar asks, brewing up a cafe latte and a frappuccino for the two young ladies chattering away at the counter.
. Almost too good actually; distantly, he kind of understands now why Meg was so dazed after her liplock with Cas.
. Which does nothing to comfort Kevin about his own lifespan. But, more importantly right now, he needs his coffee.
When Sam reaches the unlit kitchen, he sighs. Apparently he’d managed to wake up before Dean today. Switching the lights on, he starts the coffee machine up, setting his mug down next to it.
Cas moves closer to the passenger-side window, squinting. “I can see foxglove and wolfsbane from here.”
Well, what a lovely opportunity to be placed in his lap today. He leans forward slightly, smirking. “Pray tell, Squirrel, is there anything you’re itching to get off your chest?”
“I don’t really have a good answer for that,” Sam admits. “I didn’t even know about it till Dean told me. I didn’t entirely believe him at first, and by the time we confirmed it we’d already been dragging it out.”
“Indeed I am,” Gabriel says, grinning. Castiel isn't entirely sure if that bodes well or not for Dean’s brother.
Dean and Cas share an ice cream sundae between them that they cheerfully demolish, faces smeared with whipped cream and caramel by the time they’re done. Sam pulls out his phone, sneakily taking a few photos before the kids catch on.
Dean immediately reassesses his earlier thought and decides he should’ve never bothered to answer. There’s no right answer anymore. To make matters worse, the waitress takes that moment to materialize at their table, looking somewhere between amused, curious, and maybe a little weirded out. Dean’s not entirely sure since he’s busy wishing that he could turn invisible, or sink into his seat and be forgotten. Anything. Maybe someone in the diner could have some kindness and give him a mercy killing.
Dean nods excitedly, hard enough that he looks like a mini bobblehead. Sam smothers a laugh. “Alright,” he says, moving to take it from him when he sees the edges of another one peeking out from behind it.
Just in case it's not super clear, the season 8 finale didn't quite happen the same way here as it did in the show. So, no Naomi hunting Metatron down or proclaiming death for our dear Sam, and no secret double agendas from our weasely little scribe. Everything's as above-board as you'd expect/hope for dimension locking trials (or whatever you'd like to call it) and the boys just really need a vacation (though this is not that fic unfortunately).
“I needed space,” he admits, looking off to the left of Cas. “It’s not like I’ve been spending all this time being mad at you for that shit. Like I said, I'm over it."
“I can’t make it any more simple than that, man,” Dean says a little plaintively. He just wants this conversation to be over; answering Cas was supposed to end this, not keep it going.
Sam sighs, rubbing a hand over his face, glaring weakly at the book in front of him. “I thought I’d finally friggin’ found something, and-” he trails off angrily.
“I remember,” Cas replies. Dean wasn't entirely sure if he was imagining that hint of smugness in his tone or not.
He leans back, fiddling with the beer bottle label as he darts a glance in Cas’ direction. He looks more awake now if still a little tired as he goes back to his reading. Sensing Dean’s gaze, Cas looks up and meets his eyes, brow raised in silent question.
He picks up the ring box to take a closer look at it. “This, however, is just a trinket, albeit a genuinely old one. Decent craftsmanship. Haven’t seen one like it in a good while.”
When he realizes Sam’s made no move to join them, Dean comes to an abrupt halt. Cas stops short just in time to avoid bumping into him.
It takes a few minutes before a disgruntled reply comes back from the hall at the far end of the library, followed closely by the sound of approaching footsteps. “There’s no need to shout, jeez. Tablet reading is enough of a headache without you screaming my head off.”
Dean sulks a bit as they wander back over, new toy in hand. Cas doesn’t miss his expression; he looks down at the stuffed bee before looking back up at Dean. “I’ll share it with you,” he offers solemnly.
“I like to think so.” Kevin huffs. “You go give them a shower; I’ll clean up the mud you guys are tracking around.” He closes the book he was reading and heads off to get some cleaning supplies.
Castiel’s foot taps along to the beat as he keeps on re-shelving books, nodding along to the tune. The singer’s voice is quite pleasant and he finds he enjoys the song and its upbeat pace.
“I get it. But I survived, so we’ll deal and readjust like we always do. And you’re here too, it helps.”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas says, deadpan. “Just because I was made to ‘binge’ on them by Famine’s influence in the past doesn’t mean it’s made me entirely averse to them.” He looks thoughtful for a moment. “Though it has taught me the wisdom of moderation.”
“Well, at least this explains the fried chicken,” He says glibly, taking a sip of his drink. He turns to Sam, a hint of a pout tugging at his lips. “Does this mean I’m not going to be an uncle?”
As it plays on, his fingers start tapping along to the rhythm onto whichever book is in his hand. When it gets to the chorus, his shoulders start twitching. It’s not exactly dancing but as the song goes on he finds he can’t stay still, feeling compelled to move to the rhythm.
But it doesn’t matter. Cas’ entire ‘Cas-ness’ was just how the dude was. He wasn’t interested in Dean that way.
Crowley hums thoughtfully. “There’s a number of spells or incantations to choose from, depending on efficiency or the intention of suffering for the truth-teller.”
“Listen, Kev, we have a situation. It’s…” He trails off, glancing back at the kids through the rearview mirror. “It’s not good. Call me back as soon as you get this.”
Damn it, this was a stupid idea after all, but he’d let it slip out so easily that he doubts he’d have been able to keep it secret for long anyway. Saying it at some unforeseen point in the future would be better than this fucking nerve-wracking waiting for Cas to just do
Before Kevin can decide whether or not to give a retort to that, Sam asks, “How’s the research going?”
He falters, bumping into a chair as he feels the blood rush up to color his cheeks. He’s not sure why, but he feels embarrassed at being caught.
“Swallow before you talk, unless you wanna choke,” Kevin replies, not looking back. Dean stares at the back of his head wide-eyed for a second before swallowing and mumbling a quiet ‘sorry’.
“Hey Dean-o! Happy Valentine's Day!" Gabriel says cheerily. He steamrolls over Dean's confused, "Uh thanks, you too?" to ask, "So! Any special plans for this special day? Any special lady or lad?”
Instead of bringing up how Dean had been absent at lunch, Sam makes a show of looking around the kitchen. “There some other reason you look like you’re practicing to go on a cooking show?”
He gets abruptly jolted back to reality when someone knocks impatiently at the door. Leveling another glare at his reflection, he points an accusatory finger at it. “Keep your shit together, Winchester.”
“Still works though!” Sam shouts back, laughing as Dean marches away faster. He turns to Charlie, inclining his head in the direction of the kitchen. “Let’s go put all this away.”
“If we’re done with the sharing and caring handouts, can we please have breakfast now? I’m starving.”
He all but jumps off of the chair when the egg timer rings, and starts rooting around in the drawers for a knife. He's just managed to find one when he hears the sound of the front door opening and someone shuffling around in the entryway.
Sam gets all of a few moments to root around in the cupboard for his healthy, tasteless excuse for cereal before Dean rounds on him.
Sam. He’s gonna kick his ass first before he kills the both of them, and then move to the other side of the country for good measure.
“Didn’t expect to find you here,” Sam offers carefully, setting the artifact boxes down. He drags a nearby stool closer, taking a seat across from Dean.
“The feather has some traces of it as well, much less potent than whatever’s on the mirror, of course.”
“I-” Dean pauses. He’d been about to brush it off, play it as some kind of last favor thing for helping get his ass out of Purgatory, but the words don’t seem to want to come out of his mouth. He clears his throat roughly and tries again.
“You actual asshole.” Dean sniffs, trying to rein himself in, before pulling back just enough to glare at Cas. “Don’t even
“Oh.” Cas blinks. “Okay then.” He follows after Dean, watching as he squats down and sticks his fingers right into the mud, bringing up a handful that he carefully deposits a little away from the edge of the puddle. He squats across from Dean, digging up a large mound of semi-solid mud from the edge and sets it down next to Dean’s little mud pile. “Like this?”
children was not an easy task. By the end of the hour, he’s got a handful of clothes, a pair of shoes each, and little else. He almost buys them car seats, but he’s attempting to be optimistic that the situation will be resolved quickly enough so that he won’t need them.
look. Dean’s not sure if he actually complies because they start talking about something that sounds equally nerdy to what he’d interrupted. Cas listens intently, chiming in with his own comments every so often, leaving Dean and Kevin to drink in peaceful silence.
If this was one of the sappy stories Sam loved to read, Sam would be telling him that Cas’ actions and intentions mirror Dean’s. That he’d be an idiot not to take a chance on this. But this isn’t a story, and he’s terrified to work on hypotheticals. Because what if he’s wrong, and he ruins things and loses his best friend? That instead Cas is actually afraid of Dean blowing up at him for accidentally uncorking the emotional constipation he had bottled away for years in front of the last person he’d want seeing or hearing it.
The two little kids in question just stand and stare at him, all wide-eyed and quiet, while he’s trying to not let his inner panic become outer panic.
He grunts in surprise at the impact, which distracts Cas and sends his shot wild, sinking the cue ball instead of whatever he’d been aiming at.
“No,” Cas replies, looking up from his book. “He said he was going to talk to you. He wants to play.”
Two months later, and Dean's ire was finally starting to thaw. In a bid to maintain the fragile peace, and still actively avoid each other, Sam had left to run errands while Dean was busy tinkering around in the garage, leaving Castiel to putter around with nothing to do and only himself and his imagination for entertainment.
“Oh. Thank you, Dean,” he says, brushing the flour off onto his apron. Before Dean can enquire into Cas’ curiously messy state, his attention is grabbed by the smell of baked goods lingering in the air.
“You got a pen?” Dean asks abruptly instead of answering. Wordlessly, Castiel hands a pen over to Dean, watching curiously as he scribbles something down onto his receipt.
Crowley raises a brow. “Much as I’m sure you’d like to continue appreciating my visage, I’m rather certain that’s not why you’re here.”
Sam hesitates even though the act clearly causes him some discomfort. Castiel waits, refraining from prompting the answer, his last attempt had seemed to make things worse. Sam would have to answer eventually.
“Was gonna ask you what you wanted to have for dinner,” Dean says offhandedly, attention caught by the box in Cas’ lap. He edges closer to take a better look at its contents. “What’s that?”
“Surprise?” Sam says innocently. Dean pins him with a look as he dumps the groceries onto the nearest table. He turns to Sam, arms crossed. “Wanna tell me what’s going on, Sammy?”
Once inside, he makes a beeline for the shopping carts and deposits Dean in the kid seat. After making sure that he’s properly seated, they make their way over to the kids' clothes section. There was no telling how long the two of them were gonna be stuck like this so he figures it’s best to get them a few changes of clothes at least. His eyes wander down to Cas who’s walking next to him, clutching onto his pant leg and staring at everything curiously. His eyes go lower and,
Sam’s trying, and failing, to not let the panic get to him. Cas was already well past that, looking about ready to have a meltdown if they didn't find Dean soon.
Sam’s expression screws up tighter before he blurts out, “Because he’s trying to avoid you.” He slaps a hand over his mouth.
“The cashier was male,” Cas corrects. “He said I had eyes blue enough to drown in. I assumed he was being friendly.”
“Here,” Dean says, thrusting the paper at Castiel. “I dunno if I can make it tonight what with Sammy in town and all, but uh, call me and we can figure something out.”
“What?” Sam asks, knowing he’s mostly failing at not sounding ridiculously interested. “What did he say?”
“So, ‘bee mine’?” He asks, raising his cup to show the incriminating words, as if Castiel could forget writing it.
“You need to make sure it doesn't become worse,” Cas says in what he considers a serious ‘doctor’ voice. Sam nods solemnly, trying to hide his smile.
By the time Cas finally peels away the paper Dean’s had half a dozen internal debates with himself trying to decide whether he should tear the wrapping off himself or if he should snatch it right back before Cas can see what’s inside.
Either this is Dean’s attempt at an apology (to which of them Sam’s not sure) for how he’s been behaving or he’s been replaced with a Stepford clone while they weren’t looking. He’s not sure which he’d prefer.
He can’t afford to be sidetracked, being as short for time as he is, so he decides to do a thorough cleanup once everything is done. He hurries on, quickly rolling out a new crust and setting it in the tin.
He digs into his now-cold burger to underscore the point, feeling Cas’s eyes on him but resolutely ignoring it. He relaxes fractionally when Cas’ gaze eventually slides away from him to people-watch the other diner-goers.
He slows when he reaches the kitchen, looming in the entryway, watching Dean prod at something on the stove while the nearby radio belts out some vaguely familiar-sounding rock song. Sam surveys the now-familiar sight of the mess of ingredients scattered around the kitchen with a frown.
“- it’s that you don’t risk your life pointlessly because of me. I don’t want that to be the last thing I see.”
Dean stares down at the clean if inevitably sticky floor with a mildly frustrated sigh as he waves Cas off to eat. So much for making a pie.
“Merry Christmas, Kev,” She says, handing him a small flat package and watches as he rips apart the wrapping.
“Come now, Cassie, it’ll be fun. You don’t want to leave me all on my lonesome, do you?” He says, bringing Castiel’s wandering mind back to the present.
“Pretty sure he’s the one pilfering the leftovers when no one’s looking, so no need to worry your pretty little head, Sammy. ‘Sides, not like Crowley needs to know that Kev’s still moody enough about him being here to go all hermit-y. We just lean on the fact that he knows the guy isn’t a fan of his, and what he could do if we weren’t holding him back.” Dean shrugs easily. “Should give him some motivation to behave."
Abruptly he wonders if there’s a  small possibility he’s grossly underestimating his capability to survive mostly on energy drinks and snack foods until someone remembers to feed him. Maybe it’s a new prophet ability.
“But it didn’t,” Sam counters, shutting the fridge door and leaning against it. “And sure, recovery sucks, but it’s actually
Cas glances away, gaze landing on the open book in front of him. He cocks his head slightly. When he speaks, it’s slow and thoughtful. “Vampire… pirates.”
Dean sees red. Completely ignorant to the impending explosion of Dean’s powder-keg brain, Cas responds, “I’m too old for you.” Like that was the only reason to turn him down.
“Yeah,” Sam answers, tensing up briefly in expectation of the spell going into effect. When it doesn’t, he relaxes, relieved that that was apparently enough. He’s been going over their interactions the last day or two and he thinks he’s figured out the little bit of leeway it allows and decides to take advantage of it. “Guess I’m a little restless still.”
Sam hesitates before settling back against the wall, arms crossed. “You’re sure there’s nothing else we can do to cancel out the spell?”
. This level of sappiness has been heretofore unprecedented in his brother, but hell if finding out about it doesn’t tickle Sam’s funny bone something major. He’s definitely going to store this up as blackmail material for years if only to watch Dean squirm.
He leans back with a sigh, rubbing at his jaw. “Seeing as these old codgers have a grand load of bupkis on what to actually do now, any bright ideas? The truth ain’t pretty and no one's gonna like the stuff I’ll end up saying, least of all me,” Dean says.
Dean’s already sitting at the dining table, pizzas laid out in the center and a few slices in front of him when Sam and Cas enter the kitchen. He’d been distractedly fiddling with his phone, but Sam catches the aborted glance in their direction that he covers for by immediately shoving a slice of pizza into his mouth. He rolls his eyes as he takes a seat across from Dean, watching as his brother tries not to show his obvious relief when Cas takes the empty seat at what passes for the head of the table instead of the one beside him.
Sam sighs the long-suffering sigh of a younger brother, familiar with exactly what his older brother is capable of. “And
restless, but it’s more from sitting around uselessly and not even being able to go on a damn jog while he recovers. Lying now is to preemptively cover his ass before Cas can question why. He doesn’t like having to do it, but he’s already dug himself deep enough that he’s hoping it’ll help hold back the mess once he has to climb back out.
He wonders if Sam feels similarly bereft, having grown up in close proximity to Dean for most of his life. Sam’s offer to talk had extended beyond the talk of ill dreams, so it feels worth broaching.
He dances along to the song best as he can, mouthing along with the chorus’s simple catchy lines as he moves around the room.
“So, nothing interesting happened while you were out?” Sam asks once he realizes Cas is apparently done talking.
Sam drags the book closer, brows furrowing as he tries to make sense of the text. After a few unsuccessful minutes of trying to make heads or tails of the script and only managing to make sense of the occasional word, he turns the page to read the ingredient list, muttering under his breath as he tries to read it.
“You said you needed proof, right Cas?” Sam says, half-turned to look at Cas. He nods at the front yard.
Reopening the fridge and grabbing the nearest water bottle, he hears Cas say, “I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
to get them out of the house without looking like he’s some kind of creepy kidnapper or child molester.
Sam forces himself to wait in the library, managing to stay there for around ten minutes before he gives up and heads off to find Dean. He decides to check Dean’s room first, figuring it’d be the most likely place he’d end up. Unfortunately, the only person in there is Cas, busy reading a book.
Frowning in confusion, he sets the book aside and goes to answer the door. He blinks in surprise when he sees Cas on the other side.
I do not in fact know how 4 year old kids talk (nor do I have any that young around to observe their speech patterns) though I did do some research and they have a pretty decent vocab and can struggle with some words until it evens out at about age 5 or 6. In this case, Dean has problems with hard 'r's from time to time
"Oh." Castiel says slowly. He stares at Dean for a moment, thoughtful. “Though I don’t have much to compare it to, I believe you dance quite well. You looked like you were having fun.”
“Mm-hmm.” Jody hums, amused. “Gabe, where are those peanut butter and banana muffins you promised me?”
They barely stop to dump their stuff at the nearest motel once they’re in Bennett before splitting up to do a little sleuthing. Cas tags along with Sam to question the victims, while Dean goes to meet the sheriff.
While the guy roots around in his pockets for change, Rick decides to take the opportunity he’s been handed to get a better, up-close look at him.
he was Grumpy Male Model dude’s friend. Possibly even the same guy who’d been with him the other day.
, its a little uncomfortable. But not because-" he breaks off with a huff. "Look, I'm just used to Sammy teasing the crap outta me if he ever catches me letting loose. Which is hilarious, considering him dancing is basically just flailing his gargantuan limbs.”
Cas makes a face at that which Kevin decides to interpret as a cross between annoyed, confused, and vaguely offended that Kevin decides to lump him in with what would be considered normal company for Dean. Or it could be something else entirely; dude’s face is hard to read on a good day.
“Sam,” Cas replies shortly. Sam winces slightly at the tone. Didn’t sound like he’d cooled down much in the last hour or so. Not that Sam could blame him.
“A lil past seven,” She responds, ignoring Dean’s groan as he falls back into bed. “But more importantly, it’s Christmas!”
He plucks at the sleeves of the long-sleeved henley he’s wearing, staring at the hems as it stretches with the light tugs. “I couldn’t risk Naomi taking control again and trying to hurt you or Sam if I stayed. She’d already made me kill you hundreds of times before-”
Cas just stares at him for a long moment. Uncertainly, he finally asks, “Was this why you were avoiding me?”
Cas’ squint changes marginally, like he’s wondering why Sam was giving such things merit and was debating actually asking. Before he can sideline a discussion he doesn’t really have answers for, Dean wanders up to them with a loud, “Alright, nerds, time for a break.”
Dean huffs, glancing away as he mutters quietly to himself, “Dunno if this is worse than actual therapy.”
Kevin looks up at the sound of squelching footsteps coming down the stairs, brow raised. “You fall into a river while you were in town?”
Dean and Cas are fast asleep, curled towards one another with Buzzy in the middle, both of them holding on to it loosely in their sleep. Sam manages to bite back the noise he almost made at the adorable sight and quietly takes a few pictures of them on his phone before slipping out of the room.
“Kid?” Dean says warily. When he reaches out for him, Jack stiffens up at the touch. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
“Night guys.” Sam walks out of the room, switching the lights off as he leaves. He doesn’t close the door behind him, leaving it ajar to let a little light into the room. Kevin’s waiting outside, waving at him to move away from the door. At Sam’s questioning look, he raises a finger to his mouth.
“Most of the solutions I found online agreed with your suggestion to stay hydrated. The pain medication also helps.” At Sam’s curiously amused look, he adds assuringly, “It was mild.”
Crowley offers up the now empty plate in response. Sam accepts it with a quiet sigh. “Thanks for the help, I guess.”
He moves to make the drink before Castiel has a chance to harass him to get back to work. Castiel stays at the counter and quickly rings up Sam’s order, hoping to avoid giving Gabriel any more opportunities to advance his flirtations into outright propositioning him.
“Way to go, Casanova!” Gabriel praises, slapping him on the back – hard enough to almost propel him into the counter. He ignores the glare Castiel sends his way and pretends to wipe away fake tears. “My little bro is growing up so fast. It’s only a matter of time before I’ll be walking you down the aisle and giving you away to Dean to live in glorious gay matrimony together.”
They stare at each other with goofy, love-struck smiles on their face for some unknown period of time before Cas speaks.
“We should’ve said it before,” Sam says, one corner of his mouth twisting into a frown. He meets Cas’ eyes and his frown softens. “I’ll say it again once we’ve fixed everything, but you deserve to hear it now, too. Thank you, Cas. Not just for looking out for us, but,” he glances away with a shrug, “for deciding we were worth sticking with.”
“What I’ve found so far’s entirely guesswork, in case you forgot. I could ask Cas if he remembers what he set off-”
Sam wanders into the empty library in the afternoon with a mind to actually get somewhere with his research. He takes a seat at one of the desks, stretching his legs, only to be met with a yell of, “Don’t kick Buzzy!”
Mirth still humming in his mind, he hesitates for all of a few seconds before he picks up his phone and opens up a search page, typing in a few keywords. It doesn’t take much scrolling to find exactly what he’s looking for. Choking back another chuckle at the similarity, he saves it to his phone before opening his chat with Dean.
They walk in peaceable silence for a few more minutes, before Cas suddenly asks, “How are you supposed to react if someone flirts with you?”
“Surprise?” Dean says, faux innocently to Sam as he passes by him, intent on making the best Christmas pancakes anyone’s ever tasted. Sam’s obviously trying his best to frown but he can’t fight against the way his lips keep twitching into a smile.
He stares at Dean, wide-eyed and nervous, unable to figure out if his expression means he’s going to – optimistically –  get a date with the man he’s been crushing on for months, or – realistically and most likely –  receive a customer harassment complaint. The blood rushing in his ears is so loud he barely hears Dean’s question.
Cas tilts his head, unblinking. Sam’s never wondered what Cas would look like as a kid, never had any need to, and well - technically this was Jimmy’s body so that line of thought was useless. Not that he’d had any doubts this was Cas, but his bird-like head-tilt was comfortingly familiar.
Kevin glances between the two of them with dawning understanding, lips pressed into a thin line. He closes his book forcefully, grabbing the attention of the other two occupants in the room. “Where’ve you guys looked so far?”
It explains a lot about the last few days. He’d been convincing himself that he was reading too much into things, but apparently he’d been reading a few chapters behind everyone else.
They hobble down the hall, Cas bearing the brunt of Dean’s weight as he struggles to walk from the pain.
Once that’s done, he moves on to mix up the pie filling. He’d used up most of the blueberries in his earlier attempts, there’s just barely enough left for one more try. He pours the filling into the tin and carefully lays out the strips of crust over it, crimping the edges like he’s been told he’s supposed to do.
Dean concedes with a sigh and a roll of his eyes, raising his arms up in a stretch. “Fine. God, I can’t wait for this to be over.”
Castiel thinks. It’s liable to go down as well as the first time he’d tried that apology. They haven’t talked about it since, but he’s known Dean to hold onto his grievances before. He just hopes that maybe this time he’ll be allowed to do some penance.
“I don’t understand why humans prefer interactions in a roundabout manner as opposed to saying things directly. It’s harder to gauge their intentions this way.”
Part of Dean wants to object at that, say something about him not being alone as long as he and Sam are around, but he can't seem to find his voice to do it. He realizes after a moment that it's about more than being human or permanently stuck in a human body without getting a choice in the matter; he's cut off from heaven and his family in a way he's never been before, one that's more final than anything in the past. There's nothing Dean can say in light of that.
“I really need to get paid for doing this sh- crap,” Kevin mutters, eyes still closed. He takes another sip. “I’m guessing you two haven’t eaten yet?”
“Holy sh- crap!” Kevin bites back a curse, backpedaling away. “My clothes aren't food! Shoo! Get lost!”
When Cas doesn’t say anything for a long minute, he hesitantly squints his eyes open to see his reaction. Whatever he was expecting, the confused, vaguely uncomprehending expression isn’t it.
Dean doesn’t know how long they keep kissing, and honestly, he doesn’t care. It feels like he’s got adrenaline injected right into his heart. He might die here and now, but, Hell, if he does, he’s dying happy.
starts playing as she goes back to digging through the pile of presents. She hums along as she grabs two packages, giving them a cursory shake before tossing the soft bundle to Sam, and the larger, heavier one to Cas.
He needs to be certain though, and as much as it hurts, he makes himself ask, “Why is Dean stress cooking?”
Sam stays quiet for a long moment. Before Kevin can figure out how to nudge the conversation back to life, Sam speaks up.
His stomach gurgles quietly, abruptly reminding him that he hasn’t eaten more than a large packet of Cheetos and a can of energy drink in the past… he’s gonna assume somewhere between four to six hours. Maybe longer since he’s mostly sure he conked out for a brief nap in between.
Cas wanders into the kitchen silently sometime in the mid-morning, quiet enough that Dean doesn’t notice him until he pipes up with a, “Hello, Dean.”
from Kevin saying that he’s managed to find Dean. He barely resists the urge to toss his phone when he doesn’t find any missed notifications, shooting him a quick text instead.
Dean sighs loudly. “I’m over it, alright?” Catching Castiel’s doubtful look, Dean crosses his arms and glares. “What d’you want me to say?”
Dean thinks, annoyed, but what comes out instead is “Because he’s back in Purgatory. So, non-issue.”
Dean mentally unkinks himself at that, rolling his eyes as he gets up to fill up a plate for Cas. Honestly, no one’d think this half-asleep doofus was an angel a week and change ago if they ever saw him now.
Cas mutters a ‘thank you’ to the bartender when his drink arrives, a large, bright, eyesore of a thing. He makes a quiet, satisfied hum as he sips at it, licking his lips as he sets it down, chasing down the lingering sweetness of the drink. The sight distracts Dean enough that he forgets to rib Cas about his taste in drinks.
Figuring he should take advantage of the opportunity he’s been given, he gets changed and out of the bunker in short order. He gratefully inhales the brisk February air as he jogs by the road leading into town.
By the time he gives up trying to pretend he’s actually getting anything done it’s almost dinner time. Not bothering to search out Sam or Cas, he quietly slinks out of the storeroom, making his way to the kitchen to throw something together for them to eat.
Dean scowls. “I don’t need your dumb commentary ruining the viewing experience. I was thinking we could go into town, have a few drinks, maybe meet a few chicks. Y’know,
Cas nods understandingly. Sam darts little side-glances at Cas as they keep walking, their earlier conversation still bouncing around in his head.
Sam catches it with ease, pulling the wrapping apart to find a soft red turtleneck sweater with a large golden reindeer on the front. Dean smirks at him. “Thought your Christmas wardrobe could use an upgrade.”
Sam huffs, smirking slightly. “Yeah. He’s useless with research work when he’s dealing with things, so he does other stuff instead.”
“Way to make a complete fool of yourself with the regulation hottie,” Mal says cheerfully, leaning against the counter.
“No plans? Poor ol’ Cassie doesn't have any either, workaholic that he is. Maybe you can help him out?” Gabriel asks cheekily. Castiel scowls.
Humiliation churns in his gut. It’s bad enough that he compared Cas to a cat, he could play that off somehow, but how the hell does he play off calling Cas
It wasn’t enough to have gotten addicted to demon blood and started the Apocalypse, it turns out he was apparently overdue for ruining someone else’s life.
Dean mumbles something under his breath as he reluctantly sits back up. Charlie either doesn’t hear it or ignores it as she heads for the door.
Dean reaches behind himself, grabbing his gun from where he’d tossed it aside and bringing it up, redirecting Cas’ gaze to it in the process. He taps a finger against it. “That’s why we’ve got these. Special witch-killing bullets, just for her. Don’t worry, you’ll get one too.” He pauses. “You
“Thanks,” Sam says, reaching out for his beer. He doesn’t drink it immediately, just plays with the label. “How’s Dean?”
The first thing Dean notices of course, is the pie sitting innocuously on the cooling rack. An excited grin lights up his face. "You bought pie?"
Rick glances out the window out of habit, doing a double-take as he catches sight of the shiny, black, beast of a car parked by one of the self-service pumps outside. Not many people drove classic cars like that these days. He’s almost certain he’s seen it around town a couple of times over the past few months though he’d never caught sight of the owner. He can see a guy sitting slouched in the passenger seat, but it’s too far for him to make out any details. In any case, he’s more interested in getting a better look at the driver than at his buddy.
Dean rolls his eyes, setting the half-empty flour tin back on the counter and grabbing the small dustpan and brush stowed away beneath the sink to clean up the spilled flour. “Figured this shit out yet?”
Balthazar hands the drinks over to the ladies with a charming smile, waiting for them to leave before turning on Castiel with a put-out expression.
“You haven’t even been human a whole month,” Dean says, reluctantly shaking Cas’ grip off. He’s not sure what he hates more, undermining what Cas is saying when he wants it to be true or the fact that Cas feels the need to do this. “You’ve barely got a hang of what human emotions are, and all you’ve felt is like, a fraction of-”
Dean’s clearly managed to out-stubborn Sam on breakfast, seeing as he’s the only one triumphantly and messily pouring himself a large bowl of Froot Loops. Kevin eyes Sam impassively for a moment before heading over to the coffee machine with a passing, “You’ve got cereal in your hair.”
Dean leans forward suddenly, grabbing Cas’ face and angling it into a kiss, close-mouthed and soft. Cas closes his eyes, savoring it. Dean sucks at the edge of his lower lip before pulling back, eyes half-lidded.
Large black tendrils envelop Cas at an alarming speed. Cas steadfastly ignores them, not looking away from Dean. “Thank you for-”
It was similar enough to the poker playing witch they’d taken down a few years ago to catch Sam’s attention. So he’d brought it up to Dean, figuring it’d be a good opportunity to give Cas some actual hunter training.
“Squirrel’s got no reason to play niceties with me. You on the other hand,” he hums, “maybe your relationship with your boyfriend’s finally reaching its end.”
Dean looks around, trying to think of something to do when his eyes land on a mud puddle nearby. “Wanna make mud pies?”
She shrugs. “I don’t particularly care what a random thug who breaks into my house thinks. Now, if it wasn’t clear, this little break-in visit is officially over.”
At that, Dean frowns. He turns to look up at Cas, only for him to get a small shrug in return. “Not home?” he asks Sam.
“This ain’t witches grading class, sweetheart. Why don’t you tell me why you’re going around Benjamin Button-ing people instead,” Dean says, slowly edging his way into the kitchen.
“I’ve been trying out a few new tricks I learned on some of the more annoying ones,” she admits. “They’re still around, not quite human though. Can’t guarantee they’re alive either.” She smiles then, sharp and mean. “Life is short and fickle like that.”
Dean hovers outside Cas’ room, debating whether or not to knock or stroll right in. Cas wasn’t exactly secretive or protective of his privacy, so strolling right in wouldn’t be an issue; but it’d be rude, not to mention possibly awkward considering how they've been tiptoeing around each other for the past week since the spell broke. Mending any potentially broken bridges between them wouldn't start with him acting like a caveman.
Crowley doesn’t respond at first, raising a brow instead. The Winchesters have yet to learn the obvious implications of his silence, but it’s at least amusing to watch the elder Winchester get riled up in the process. Sam, sadly, is largely unflustered by Crowley.
“Lemme know if he doesn’t, so I can lock away all the kitchen knives.” Dean huffs. “Armory too, probably.”
jealous about that, much. It’s not like he could match Sam in the brainy nerd-speak department that they both go off on.
Sam’s to blame somehow, he’s sure of it; he’s been giving Dean looks lately even if he hasn’t uttered a peep about whatever’s shaking around in his big head. The fucker even cheerfully volunteers to play a round against Cas once Dean’s done showing him the ropes.
Dean doesn’t respond, staring down intently at the chopping board as if the vegetables on it might vanish the second he looks away.
Sam clears his throat pointedly. Dean looks at him, brows raised. “Might wanna gargle before bed, Sammy.”
Usually it was Cas who’d find Dean brooding there when he wasn’t hovering over Sam instead of the other way around. Not that Cas brooded, no. He just had his nose stuck in a book or his phone most of the time. Dean’s been wondering if it’s time to suggest a hobby, even though it feels kind of weird to.
Silence seems like the safest bet until he can get his coffee and leave, but that idea gets nixed when his stomach lets out a loud growl, making it known that it doesn’t like to be ignored. Dean pauses in his dough rolling to glance up at him. “When’s the last time you ate?”
Sam tries to bite back his relieved expression at that, one which Kevin doesn’t miss when he turns to him and says, “You’re helping. Think you can manage eggs and toast, Winchester?”
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose. “I won’t pretend I know what’s going on in your head anymore. But I’m not going to let you pretend like you aren’t hurting him, because whatever he thinks is going on right now, it’s not good.”
Sam waves his hand and continues, unperturbed. “-but you’re being a stubborn dick about it. Even if he doesn’t, he might at least know
“We’re out of cereal,” Cas calls out, sounding disappointed as he adds, “There’s no more bread either.”
He shrugs a little nervously. He’s admitted enough that the spell isn’t pushing for more, but it’s not like he can avoid this conversation anymore, so he figures he’ll take what he can get to answer some shit on his own terms. “There’s… things I didn’t want to think about or talk about, stuff that’s harder to ignore when you’re walking around with that spell on you.”
Suddenly becoming the older brother on a kind of technicality he’d never expected made Sam realize that he was starting to miss things he’d never expected to. Like walking past the shower room to Dean singing off-key to Metallica in the shower, the conversations he’d have with Cas in the library late at night when he couldn’t sleep, or his brother humming the chords to Led Zeppelin songs as he cooked. He hadn’t even realized how much he missed Dean’s cooking till then. No one’s complained about their steady diet of takeout and frozen food with the occasional attempt at actual cooking thrown in, but it’s a depressing enough thought if Sam lets himself think too much on it. He figures the least he can do is try and take them to the park in town and let them burn off some energy while getting fresh air. Normal kids probably got out a lot more than Dean and Cas did currently, and while neither they nor their current situation was something anyone would consider normal, he could at least try to put some more effort into it. Maybe he could even drag Kevin out with them and get him to enjoy the light of the sun while he’s at it.
“Need a full tank of gas,” Grumpy Male Model grunts, jabbing a thumb behind him as he sets down his things. Rick nods as he punches it into the register and starts scanning the guy’s purchases, taking surreptitious glances at him all the while.
When he passes by Cas’ little work corner an hour or so later, he stills, watching him pull things off the shelf at random, gaze distant as he works.
Feeling like he’s about to break out into hives from sheer embarrassment, he’s half-tempted to crawl out the bathroom window and make a break for it like he’s jumping ship on a particularly bad date. Unfortunately, it’s not only overkill but also unfeasible seeing as he’s Cas’ ride back to the bunker.
“Eggnog?” she offers, handing them both a cup. Dean takes it from her without comment, staring at the two of them for a few seconds.
When Cas’ lips meet his, it’s gentle, almost careful. Dean presses forward; on the off-chance he’s going to have this only once he wants to have something a little less gentle.
“Well, since it looks like you guys have got everything set up without me I’m gonna go shed a few layers. I’m starting to sweat like a pig under all this.” Dean says, heading for his room only to be halted by Sam shoving a bag into his hands.
Cas frowns in confusion before the expression clears into something a mix of surprised and amused. “That’s clever.”
Dean’s face turns an almost alarming shade of red impressively quick at that even as he pries one hand off of Cas to flip Sam the bird. Cas drops his head onto Dean’s shoulder, his own pink tint up to his ears now.
Dean had gone ahead and tattled to Cas about the threat of Sam’s salads if the suspicious looks he’d directed at Sam for the rest of that day were anything to go by. Kevin managed to remain none the wiser to the ridiculousness of Sam’s only attempt on the matter. Sam’s in no hurry to let him know either.
He’s both excited and nervous when the timer dings. If it’s ruined again he has no time to make another one. He holds his breath as he carefully takes out the pie tin, letting out a sigh of relief once he’s placed it on the cooling rack. The lattice crusting of the pie was a little uneven and it looks slightly overcooked; as far as appearances were concerned, it was acceptable. The real mark of success would be the taste.
Cas tilts his head, slanting a glance at Sam. His expression is tight, like he’s trying to keep it under control, but Sam can see beneath it enough to the vulnerability he’s trying to hide.
me what I’ve done that’s driven you to keep avoiding me, I could try and make amends-” Castiel pauses, watching as horror flashes through Dean’s eyes, his jaw clenching tight. It takes a few seconds to realize he must have prompted the truth compulsion to action once again.
At best, he’d gently reject Dean in his own Cas-like manner; it’d get awkward after but they’d plow on somehow. At worst, he’d leave. Maybe never even speak to Dean again, leaving him to glean updates on how he’s doing from Sam.
Dean immediately opens his mouth to object, then stops. He’d been planning to have Cas tag along with him to be on the safe side, seeing as the guy’s never dealt with a witch while semi-human.
Dean’s head whips around fast enough that he’s definitely going to be feeling it tomorrow. That’s a problem for future him though since his brain and eyes are currently zeroed in on the twink very much in Cas’ personal space.
include being able to see the specific spells or curses an object might hold written in a script that only my eyes can behold.”
“Yeah?” Sam asks, curiosity piqued. He’s seen his brother politely receptive to another man’s flirtations a handful of times, mostly when Dean didn’t think he was paying attention or near enough to really notice the interactions, but he’s also seen a few hilariously disastrous attempts of Dean trying to initiate the flirting himself. Not to exclude some particularly amusing attempts towards
“Got it.” He stares at Sam for a few seconds, then says decisively, “I’m gonna go raid the kitchen now.”
Far as Sam’s concerned, other than Kevin’s ribbing, and the occasional child-sized tantrums, he’d say that things were going pretty well for them, all things considered.
“I know I’ve been kind of an ass about it lately, but it’s been good to have you stick around. Sam’s obviously happy and, y’know, we can make another go at training you up to be a hunter if you want-”
Cas looks down at the melted remains of his ice-cream. A small smile curls at the edge of his mouth.
Cas nods again, not really looking like he believes it. Sam’s not sure what’d convince him. He watches Cas finish off his coffee, allowing his own to cool as his mind wanders. Maybe saying it isn’t worth much if they don’t show it, and they haven’t really been doing much showing of it lately.
this, to live out the rest of his days as a human, is too fantastically ridiculous to wrap his head around.
He rolls over with a grunt, groping for his phone where it’s busy beeping noisily on the bedside table. Blinking sleepily, he thumbs off the alarm. He squints against the glare of his phone screen, trying to figure out what the time was, scowling when he realizes it was just past seven in the morning. This was what happened when he kept trying to remind himself to turn off his alarm after a hunt or a late-night research session and never actually did it.
“Cut it out, Cas,” Dean hisses, stubbornly forcing himself to make eye contact with Cas. “You've seen all of this before; you remade me, remember?”
“Dean,” Cas interrupts, expression pinched and more than a little frustrated. “Being human might be new to me, but I know myself enough to know what I’m feeling. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t doubt that.”
“Evening, Feathers,” Crowley says, setting down his book as Castiel wanders in with dinner. He doesn’t react to the nickname with his usual frown, just stops at the door, and stares at Crowley blankly.
Sam smothers a laugh, tilting his head back with a smirk. “He didn’t mean it literally, Cas. He was trying to tell you he’s really into you.”
He’d gone and made a fool of himself in front of an older, hot dude without even getting a chance to salvage some of his dignity. Even worse that he ended up having an audience for it. Sure, the dude somehow didn’t clue onto the fact that he’d been failing at low-key flirting with him when he’d been doing it, but still, it was the principle of the thing. If Grumpy Male Model dude had waited just a couple more minutes…
“What?” He says, looking up to see the sprig of mistletoe that Cas was staring at – a sprig which had definitely not been there an hour ago, he’s sure of it. “Oh.”
It takes Dean a few moments before he can figure out what to say. “Listen, I’m sorry about Jimmy. He didn’t deserve to get pulled into all our shit.” He bends his head down, trying to catch Cas’ eye. Cas meets it hesitantly. “But you can’t ask me to be sorry about the fact that it means you’re still around, ‘cause I
Cas notices Dean’s staring and probably doesn’t take too kindly to the smirking, grumbling out a “What?”
Dean watches his hand make contact, feels the firm, familiar curve of it under his palm. A shaky breath escapes him as his eyes dart back to Cas’.
“I can’t. I have a situation going on here that’s taken priority. That’s why I was trying to get a hold of you,” Sam says, leaning back in his seat. “We were trying to take out a witch about a month ago and she got the upper hand on us and turned Dean and Cas into kids.”
try waiting it out, let it wear off on its own.” The elder Winchester makes a face at that, a cross of discomfort and panic before quickly suppressing it.
“Dean?” Cas says questioningly, looking between the leather-bound journal in his hands and Dean in confusion.
The main door groans noisily indicating Sam’s return before Dean has a chance to answer. He casts a quick side glance towards the door before turning back to Cas with an apologetic expression. “How ‘bout a rain check on that?”
“Enough,” Castiel cuts him off, brows drawn together. “Please, just stop pretending things are fine.”
A very, very tiny part of his brain pipes up with wanting to flirtatiously quip at Cas asking if he’d
“Thanks, man, I appreciate it,” Sam says, ending the call and turning to the others. “Looks like we might get those mermaid scales after all.”
Cas shakes his head. “Not particularly. I understand it helps but I’d rather not dwell on it too much if it’s all the same to you.”
It takes most of the morning for them to gather together all the documents they can find related to storeroom records. He sends Cas back to his sorting tasks after with some regret, settling down to read through the documents.
“It’s not under there,” Dean says, handing him a small rectangular shaped parcel wrapped in newspaper. “Sorry about the crappy wrap job.”
Dean looks up with a hesitant frown as Cas comes to an abrupt stop in front of him. He rubs at the rain dripping into his eyes. "...Cas?"
Dean stares down at the feather for a long moment, gaze going distant. After a moment, he mutters, “Son of a bitch.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, focusing intently on the ingredients he’s measuring and pouring into a bowl. He continues in a forced, jovial tone, “It’s still too early for lunch, man-”
“You’re still mad at me. About before, with the angel tablet.” Castiel’s eyes rove over Dean’s face, trying to read into what he must be thinking.
Cas interrupts with a confused, “That doesn’t explain why you’ve been avoiding me, I’ve ‘stuck around’.”
“There’s more to our tastes than tea and toast,” Crowley replies sarcastically. “We sometimes have scones.”
“I’m not asking to convince you not to. It’s-” Sam sighs. “Maybe this is long overdue. He might freak out and get mad but- I need you to understand that whatever stupid shit he says, he doesn’t want you gone. Neither do I, if that matters any.”
“Great,” he says, grabbing at his friend’s purchases. “Let’s go. Stuff’s gonna start melting in the car if you keep dawdling any longer.”
“I appreciate the pantomime at manners,” Crowley says dryly. Using the hand holding the pizza to gesture sardonically, he says, “Please, feel free to come in.”
He ignores the two sets of eyes watching him expectantly. He doesn’t like this plan, but he’d sound like an idiot saying it out loud. Cas was a big-boy-not-quite-angel, he could take care of himself. They’d be able to cover more ground quicker this way, anyways.
making breakfast can be,” Kevin says a little sarcastically halfway through breakfast, “it’s your turn tomorrow.”
He briefly entertains the stray thought of wondering what it’d be like if they’d been changed into babies instead, dispelling it with a shudder at the thought of diaper changes and who knows how many wailing, late-night feeding sessions till the spell would have been undone.
Dean sets the gun aside, getting back to his burger. “Need to make sure you ain’t accidentally gonna shoot yourself in the foot.” He can see Sam rolling his eyes at him in his periphery but chooses to ignore it.
The days seem to pass by quickly, blending together in a haze of research and tag-team child-rearing. Early mornings have become the norm for all the bunker’s inhabitants, though Sam often feels like he’s the one who’s adjusted worst to the new routine, either waking up feeling like he still needed an entire day’s worth of sleep or at the heels of someone else grumbling for breakfast (the kids) or coffee (Kevin).
When he turns back, Cas is barely a few feet away, the blueberry puddle on the floor the only thing dividing them. Dean flinches back reflexively, biting back another curse. Dude’s ninja skills were starting to get annoying now.
Dean flinches like he’d shouted instead, going stiff before seeming to force himself to relax. A small part of Castiel’s mind recognizes the action as an echo he hadn’t quite noticed happening over and over the last few days. He feels an ache he can’t quite understand at the realization.
Crowley shrugs. “That’s it.” He takes another bite of his pizza. “One’s more powerful than the other, but that says very little about what either does.”
“I’ve got it!” Kevin exclaims, slamming his hands down on the table. He moves over to Sam and hands him the book he’d been reading.
Dean shrugs, shoving his hands into his pockets. He clears his throat against the grabbing, choking feeling of the spell wrapping around his throat and sighs, frustrated.
He snorts at the question. He’d learned long ago not to mess with ladies’ drinks after one of the few date nights he’d had with Lisa. She’d dared him into trying her drink when she’d noticed the derisive look he’d given it. It’d been strong enough that the taste had lingered all night, even after a couple of rounds of beer. Featherweight that human Cas apparently is, he’d probably be knocked on his ass if he tried a Long Island Iced Tea. No telling what the alcohol content in his current drink was, but it’s a fair bet that it and the sugariness of it are high.
“What a surprise,” Sam says dryly. “We’ve only been at this for a day, so he’s going to have to suck it up.”
“Uh-uh,” Dean tuts, calling Kevin’s attention hesitantly back from the mouthwatering dish before him. “Take a plate, kid.”
"What?" Cas says, unaware of the picture he makes. Dean eyes rove over him, taking him in, from the dark green apron he's wearing, covered in splatters of blue of varying sizes, to the dusting of flour on his hair. He looks like a modern art rendition of a Christmas tree, fine coating of fake snow and all.
“Whatever you want it to be, Cas.” Dean shrugs, trying to pretend he’s calm about this when in truth his heart’s hammering against his ribcage so hard it’s liable to beat right out of his chest. It’s a wonder Cas can’t hear it.
When Dean just nods and doesn’t say anything else, Charlie claps her hands together and says, “So, you looking forward to going back to normal?”
“What about him?” Sam asks, before understanding dawns. Dean notices the change in his expression, brows raised excitedly.
“Right. You stay here, I’ll go get him for you,” Sam says, trotting off quickly to get Cas his bee plushie, finding him propped up in one of the library chairs. He grabs it up and heads back to Dean’s room to give it back to a much happier six-year-old.
talking to Cas, and because it’s more than a little weird to just eat silently, Sam strikes up a conversation with Cas.
Sam’s expression turns skeptical. He stares at Dean for a long moment, then sighs. “Alright, I’ll bite: what is it?”
Crowley doesn’t look up from his book at first at the sound of footsteps coming down the hall, having quickly gotten used to the noisy ambling of the bunker’s inhabitants. They’d become prone to wandering down the halls more often over the last few days, and allowing himself to be distracted by the sound took away from what little enjoyment he’s been afforded by the Winchesters as part of his second chance at humanity.
“If my memory on mythological history serves, I’d wager a guess that these items match rather well with possessions that belong to Veritas and, hmm, Ma’at if I had to guess. Of course, the mirror’s not the original.”
“Well, he’s stress cooking,” Sam says, eyes widening slightly before his jaw snaps shut. “Forget I said that.”
“Not since you scared him off earlier,” Kevin replies, watching Sam check behind the curtains of the telescope platform. He turns back to the room, crouching to look under the tables. “Sam. What happened?”
Cas narrows his eyes at Sam. He raises his hands up defensively. “Hey, I wasn’t the one who said it.”
Dean curses under his breath. "Lady, you have no idea what kind of shit you're messing with, you need to stop for your own damn good."
Dean’s blush gets darker. Cas was apparently succeeding on his new mission to fluster him as much as possible.
The Empty rolls its eyes and cuts Dean off. “I’m here for Castiel. Figured I’d hedge my bets, just in case.” At his confused expression, it snorts. “Oh that’s cute. You didn’t even tell him.”
He gets twin replies of “no” in response, an embarrassed one from Sam and a matter of fact one from Cas, at the same time that Dean chimes in with “I’ve got Fwoot Loops!”
“What’re you gonna do if I don’t?” She scoffs. He’s halfway into the kitchen now, but she doesn’t seem to notice or care. “Arrest me? I’m pretty sure you’re not a cop.”
Sam squints against the sunlight, searching for Dean and Cas. It takes him a few minutes of scanning the area before he catches sight of them by the tree line. It’s a generous take on ‘staying in sight of the bunker’ if anyone asked Sam. Not that he could really blame them, it was nice to feel the sunlight again.
“‘kay,” Dean mumbles. He moves closer, reaching up to hug Sam, fingers gripping tight onto Sam’s shirt as he buries his face in his neck. “Wuv you, Sammy.”
by the time Charlie cheerfully announces that it’s time for presents. She situates herself by the tree as the self-appointed Christmas elf so that she can hand out everyone’s gifts to them.
“Right, the kid thing,” Kevin says after a moment. He’s not sure what else to say. Their situation undeniably sucks, but he isn’t as close to Cas and Dean as Sam was. They hadn’t even bothered to talk about the way things were right now beyond focusing on trying to fix it; maybe this conversation was a bit overdue.
He’s not sure when he finally realized it, the underlying frustration at Cas always leaving tinted by a need to have him stay that he didn’t quite understand till now. He finally has what he’s wanted now with Cas here, on Earth and human to boot; and isn’t that enough? That’s more than Dean ever thought he’d get, more than Dean ever intended to ask for.
Kevin stops abruptly, halfway across the room, eyes trained at a point behind Sam. “Uh Sam, don’t freak out but I think some kids snuck into the bunker with you.”
Cas doesn’t answer for a long moment before he quietly says, “I know we’re not supposed to be like this.”
“Alright, alright. The zombie’s gonna take a break, no more tickling,” Sam says, straightening up. Dean looks at him dubiously, shakes his head and remains hiding behind Kevin. To Sam’s great amusement, he doesn’t stray far from Kevin’s side until they’re leaving the museum.
They both open their mouth to speak at the same time, but before either of them can say anything the others return with their clothes and that’s the end of that.
“I used to be a babysitter for a while, back before all this,” he elaborates, waving his hand loosely to indicate what ‘this’ was.
Cas hesitates a moment, tightening his grip on the box, before turning it to show him the box’s contents instead of answering. Upon closer inspection, Dean sees some colorful pebbles, a bunch of dried flowers, a few feathers, a bottle cap; all technically garbage, but they had something in common. Every single item was something the pint-sized version of him had given Cas.
“Anyways,” Kevin continues, looking back down at his book, “I told ‘em to stay within sight of the bunker and they’ve only been out there for,” he glances at his phone, “an hour, barely.”
“I was?” Dean asks, staring up at her in awe. God, her handmaiden was frakking adorable. She’s kinda mad at Sam for not telling her about this sooner.  “Wait, tha’s a girl’s thing, isn’ it?”
Confused, he opens up the chat with Sam, only to find a gif of a fuzzy grey-black cat staring down away from the camera. He downloads it out of habit more than any actual interest in seeing the gif. Once it’s done downloading, a blur of what Dean assumes is someone’s legs cross the camera, prompting the cat to look up at the camera with a frown that slowly slides into a squint.
In the quiet of the hallway, it’s not hard for them to hear the kids talking softly to each other in the bedroom. After a little while, the talking slows down to a complete stop. They stand around for a few more minutes before Kevin nods at the bedroom door.
He feels a tug on his pant leg. When he looks down, he finds Cas giving him his trademark squint, an expression that weirdly doesn’t manage to look out of place on a much younger face, before walking to the kitchen door and pointing down the hall. “Do you mean those?”
He draws his gun and aims, hands moving quickly through familiar motions. He pulls the trigger just as she sends the gun flying with a flick of her wrist. His shot goes wild and hits the radio.
The bunker feels cavernously large and empty with no one around, so he turns on the old radio Dean had set up on one of the tables to banish the quiet of the library.
The scarf paired with his ridiculous red sweater makes him look a bit like an idiot honestly, but Dean doesn’t doubt that he probably looks much the same since his own sweater looks like Christmas threw up on it without the scarf on top of it.
It doesn’t take long for the alcohol to hit Cas, and their next round of pool is punctuated by his increasingly erratic shots. He glances from his half-empty glass to Dean’s fourth round of beer like he’s got a theory that doesn’t quite make sense yet.
Cas doesn't say anything, just pulls Dean up into a bone-crushing hug. He holds him close for a few seconds before pulling back.
There’s no rhythm or order to his movements that he can discern, but it’s exhilarating. He never knew dancing could be so much
Dean’s a pro at the game, and the better player between him and his brother, so of course he’s the obvious choice. He’s still not entirely clear on how it ended up being
Crowley just barely manages to hide his surprise at his own words, just as Castiel straightens up, staring at him expectantly.
He’d initially decided on going to the library and finding a book to read to pass the time. It turned out to be a fruitless endeavor once he found himself rereading the same paragraph three times and still unable to comprehend what he’d just read. His hands itch with the urge to do something – preferably something productive – so he decides to occupy himself re-shelving the books in the library and bring some semblance of order to them.
“You look good,” Dean says quietly, nodding at the sweater. He can’t help but notice how the blue of the sweater brings out Cas’ eyes.
Straightening up in surprise, he hastily tries to paste on a neutral expression as he turns to see Cas’ reaction.
Dean waits till the others are suitably distracted by the gifts Charlie’s giving out before turning to Cas, nudging at his foot. He makes a valiant attempt at resisting the urge to fidget once he gets his attention. It’s not entirely successful but if Cas isn’t going to mention it then neither is he. “So uh, I got you somethin’ too.”
Of course, this would be his luck, why wouldn't it be? Fate’s never seemed to be particularly fond of Sam Winchester in the first place; no reason things would suddenly be easy for him.
Cas regards him for a moment or two, then shrugs. “Trips into town can be rather mundane, especially if we intend to keep the careful distance you’ve already established with the town’s people.”
“Dean and I went for a supply run this morning and stopped at the gas station on our way back.” He doesn’t notice Sam’s brows hiking up, intent on watching his own steps as he is. “I decided to go into the Gas-n-Sip while Dean was occupied to get some snacks Kevin had asked for and the cashier flirted with me when I went to pay for them.”
“Cas caught on to the fact that you’re avoiding him like he has the Black Plague,” Sam says, stepping down into the kitchen. He stops a few feet short of the ingredient-laden island and crosses his arms.
Eventually, Dean notices how Cas’ gaze keeps darting towards a couple of guys playing a boisterous round of pool. Sam notices the same thing not long after. Maybe he’s not used to the trash-talking or he’s not familiar with the game; whichever it is, Dean somehow finds himself standing across a pool table from Cas and teaching him how to play.
Dean watches Cas run his fingers over the small bird embossed onto the cover of the journal for a few moments before looking up to find Cas watching him fondly.
Rubbing some grease off with a stray rag, he eyes the Impala. He decides to take her out for another spin,
Wiping his hands off on his jeans, Dean makes a show of checking the time. “It’s officially lunchtime, and I am
By the time Dean gets back to the library, there’s no one to be found. He drops his presents under the tree adding to the decent-sized pile already there and wonders where Sam and Charlie could’ve wandered off to.
He’s in the middle of a mostly incoherent argument-slash-debate with Kevin when he hears a slightly loud and very familiar voice cut through the music. “Are you propositioning me?”
He couldn’t exactly bury her in her own backyard or, for that matter, leave the kids behind to go and bury her in some abandoned plot. He chews his lip, thinking. He
Dean’s in the middle of washing dishes, soaked up to his forearms in water and suds, when his phone chirps from where it’s sitting on the kitchen island. He pauses, squinting at it to see if it made any more noise but it stays silent. He darts a glance at the wall clock to check the time, it’s too soon for the alarm he’d set to ring, and Sam’s more likely to come to the kitchen directly than message him if he’s managed to dig up anything to do with this truth nonsense. Assuming that it’s probably a junk text, he shrugs it off and gets back to washing up.
“About two days. Thought I was imagining it at first, ‘s why I didn’t bother telling you about it before.”
“Thanks, sweetheart,” Dean says, raising his own mug up. If she was going to pretend nothing happened, he was going to take it for the metaphorical lifesaver that it was.
“Guess you could call it that,” he says gruffly. A little defensively, he adds, “It’s not a big deal.”
With research work still calling him and the specter of Dean’s anxious pestering looming, he needs to get back to it soon. Opening the fridge in search of some water, Sam goes still, staring at the tupperware containers taking up most of the fridge space; all this restless ‘avoidance cooking’ was getting a little out of hand.
It’s not quite happy hour yet when they reach Donnie’s, so the bar’s not all that busy. They split up, Dean off to order the first round while Sam, Cas, and Kevin head off to snag them an empty table.
Jack doesn’t respond. Still holding on tight to Jack’s shoulder, he searches the crowd more frantically. Just as he finally finds Sam, his brother notices him and the panicked expression on his face and starts making his way through the crowd.
Kevin stops halfway through cutting a banana, patting down his pants pockets in search of his cell phone. He pulls it out, fiddling with it, but the screen stays dark.
Castiel stares down owlishly at the piece of paper in his hand for a moment, wondering whether or not he’s dreaming that he actually has
“The fuck there isn’t,” Dean says heatedly. He doesn’t have a solution now, but they’ll figure out something, they always do.
Sam shrugs agreeably, mind wandering as he sips at his coffee. He still has to put away the stuff he’d taken from the car and dumped in the library and... “Shit! The witch!” He straightens up abruptly, narrowly avoiding sloshing coffee all over himself.
He lets Cas choose this time instead of just ordering another beer, and of course, the guy ends up going for some frou-frou sounding concoction. They wait there in comfortable silence while the bartender prepares his drink, the sounds of some vaguely familiar top one-hundred’s song washing over them from across the bar. Cas squints at the bottles behind the counter curiously, trying to make out the labels. Dean surreptitiously watches him and the play of neon lights on his face cast by the signs on the corner wall. Not for the first time, Dean thinks it’s unfair how good looking he is.
Cas should’ve normally wandered by long before Sam managed to drag himself away from his books, making borderline petulant inquiries about dinner while Dean’s still cooking as he got hungrier and hungrier.
“Oh. Yes. I found the song to be quite enjoyable.” Castiel replies. “Though I must say, the urge to dance was… unexpected.”
Cas’ expression clears up then, like he’s figured out what Dean must’ve been thinking even if he doesn’t quite understand it.
“I was hoping to try and make it myself,” Cas says, though he doesn’t seem to be put out by the fact that Dean made it instead.
Sam scoffs. “Don’t let Dean fool you into thinking the way he eats is the way a healthy person should; I wouldn’t be surprised if his arteries get clogged before he’s fifty with how much red meat he scarfs down.”
He turns when Kevin doesn’t hand him any more food, raising a brow at the look he’s getting. “I’m honestly surprised that you aren’t trying to make them eat healthier.”
Sam loses an hour to the effort by the end of which it’s become more of him refreshing his memory on ancient Egyptian mythology than anything else. Figuring he’s wasted enough time, he starts closing all the open tabs he has, pausing on one with an image of Ma’at standing beside other gods of the Egyptian pantheon.
Dean sighs. “Fine. Cas’ll take the basement. I’ll take the ground floor.” He turns to frown at Cas. “You got your gun?” Cas nods. “Good, make sure the safety’s on until you actually use it. And
He’s never danced before and doesn't know how, but he’s seen Dean dancing around sometimes, singing along to whatever song is playing. There was usually a lot of hip movement involved and some kind of coherence to his corresponding arm movements.
Dean scoffs, shoulders dropping, unable to stop himself from briefly darting a glance at Cas. “Seriously? I ain’t exactly a fan of your brothers, but being a human isn’t really a good trade-off for everything you gave up.”
“Actually, yeah. We think we might’ve found a counterspell, but we have a bit of a hitch. The spell calls for mermaid scales and that kinda thing isn't exactly easy to come by.”
“Ow, shit! Fucking again!” Dean curses, hobbling back to lean against the counter while his foot throbs.
Sam takes a pull of his beer, not looking at him. Kevin decides to allow it, figuring Sam needed some time to accept the sentiment. When the silence stretches on for longer than he’d like, Kevin tries again. “Sam…”
Before he can say anything he surprises himself with a yawn. He takes a quick glance at his watch, blinking in surprise at how late it had gotten. “I’ll pester Crowley in the morning for those negating spells he mentioned, figure they’re worth a shot.”
Sam frowns, more of a grimace really, and says, “Whatever you know about things like this would be useful since we uh… we’re not really sure what’s causing this.”
“No,” Dean says, still not meeting his eyes. “Figured it was inevitable that I’d end up saying something that would ruin what we’ve got going now or chase you off. Maybe both.”
For all that Castiel hadn’t actually talked about anything directly, the brief conversation with Sam helps improve his mood.
“Dinner?” Crowley prompts. Castiel looks down at the plate in his hand as if seeing it for the first time.
“Had to bring stuff in from the car,” Sam says, stepping down into the kitchen. He takes a seat in the empty chair next to Dean’s. “I’m guessing you don’t need my help with the food.”
“Please don’t tell me you were actually gonna touch it.” Dean stays silent, not meeting Sam’s eyes. Sam sighs. “What, exactly, were you hoping to do by touching it?”
Sam mentally corrects, before forcing himself to move his thoughts in another direction in case Cas decided to continue this vein of conversation. They’re onto day five now, and the spell still hasn't worn off yet. Things are bound to come to a head eventually, and he
“So… Taylor Swift, huh?” Dean asks with an amused smile. Castiel cocks his head, confused. It’s cat-like and adorable, and not something Dean intends to admit to a single soul.
“Moose. Squirrel. To what do I owe the pleasure?” He glances at the small clock on the shelf. “It isn’t quite feeding time yet.”
“Your bed’s bound to be a better napping place than the library,” Dean jokes, taking a long sip of his beer as he pulls one of the books from the nearby stack and opening it. It’s a book on rare herbs and their magical and non-magical uses. Dean bites back a sigh; they really needed to get some decent fiction books in here.
Kevin sighs, rubbing the sleep away from his eyes as he wanders past them to get himself some coffee. He leans against the counter, grimacing slightly as he takes a sip of lukewarm coffee. “Guess you better start learning.”
Coloring slightly at the reminder, he grabs up a plate and utensils from the dryer rack before helping himself to a hefty serving of cheesy, chicken-y goodness.
Sam walks into the kitchen sometime later muffling a yawn. He pauses when he catches sight of Crowley and sighs. “Crowley.”
Ignoring the hangover headache he’s got as best as he can, he tries to patch together what did and did not happen last night. It’s a shitty attempt on its own,
Cas smiles at him, a little confused and a lot fond. He squeezes Dean’s hand, smile growing wider when he gets a squeeze back.
Dean rummages around in his pockets, tossing out some lint before he finally finds it. He quietly extends his hand, opening up his tiny fist to show what he’s holding. “I foun’ this. It’s blue, like your eyes.”
Dean smiles back, a little stiffly. “Just the check.” Something occurs to him and he grimaces a little as he corrects, “Uh, a chicken caesar salad to-go and the check.”
“Cas,” Sam interrupts, soft but firm. Cas stops, watching Sam nervously. “Do you think this is your fault?”
Before Sam can answer, Cas comes into the library, expression troubled. He heads straight for Sam. “He wasn’t in any of the rooms.”
The elder Winchester’s awkwardness and discomfort from the previous day come to mind immediately. It makes sense that he’s still uncomfortable with coming to Crowley for advice or aid of any kind, but for Castiel to be experiencing abnormal behavior as well? Color him curious.
Dean smiles back shyly, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt as he looks down at the tree roots Cas had been squatting in front of. “Whatcha lookin’ at, Cas?”
Sam sighs. “I don’t know why I expected something different.” With a shake of his head, he sets Crowley’s lunch down and makes to leave. “I need to get back to work, those negating spells you gave me were useless.”
Cas doesn’t answer; it’s enough to make Dean quit his staring contest with the wall and sneak a peek at Cas’ face. He’s got a wary expression on his face as he eyes Dean, looking like he’s debating with himself over what to say. It takes Dean a moment to realize that maybe he’s a little bit afraid of what Cas might say. He’s not sure if he wants to hear it anymore.
Cas’ smile turns slightly apologetic but he doesn’t make any move to agree to Dean’s threat. Dean scowls at him before dropping his head back onto his shoulder, muttering, “And who told you I’m something you can’t have?”
Cas is a bit of an all or nothing guy when it comes to Dean so maybe he’d do it for Sam once he finds out. He just needs a way to bribe Cas to let him watch it go down. With the affinity he’s been showing for sweet things, it’d be kinda poetic if he managed to bribe him with some of Dean’s baked goods.
When he looks back, Cas is looking at him expectantly, and Dean knows without asking that he’s willing to go with whatever Dean wants to do.
He blinks the tears back, brain desperately ping-ponging for an exit strategy. He’d been hoping Cas had forgotten about that. Voice a little hoarse, he says, “Let’s leave stuff like that for Sammy to teach you, huh?”
“Uh-huh,” Dean says, pointedly side-eyeing the still-steaming mug beside Cas’ elbow. Cas seems to be either blind to it or purposely ignoring his look. “This coming from the guy who needs three cups of it to wake up in the morning. Hi there, Pot, I’m Kettle.”
“Damn it, Dean!” Sam shouts, hand smacking the table loudly as he turns to glare at his kid brother. Dean flinches back at the noise. “You think we’ll get
unicorns be real? More importantly,” he continues, veering the conversation back to the topic at hand, “how do we even get unicorn hair?”
The woman turns around in confusion at the noise, flinching back when she catches sight of Dean. She stares at him, wide-eyed and scared before asking, “W-who are you? What’re you doing in my house?”
to lose him. He’d made shit attempts at trying to make peace with the prospect in the past, every other time he lost Cas; he couldn’t control what happened those times, but this time, it’d be his fault.
need to go to bed,” he says, indicating himself and Sam. “So how’s about you guys brush your teeth and get changed, and I’ll let you stay up in your room.”
While Dean had been busy tackling his inner turmoil, Cas never even bothered to move, still sitting with his head down and shoulders slumped as if he didn’t even have the strength to brace himself for the blow of Dean’s words.
“Hey, cheer up Cas. We’ll go get you guys some ice cream, how does that sound?” Sam asks, driving out of the parking lot.
? Sure he’d caught himself thinking it more often lately, (well, it was usually ‘cute’, not ‘adorable’, not that that was any better) but those thoughts had always stayed in his head.
“You asshole,” Dean says wetly, only then realizing the tears dripping from his eyes and making damp patches on the trenchcoat. Cas’ arms come up and hold him back, gentle and warm.
“Fine,” Sam sighs, running a hand through his hair. “Hide from Cas, do whatever. Lemme have some breakfast first, then I’ll try to figure out what’s causing this crap.”
The effort’s wasted as it turns out since the guy’s either real deep into the broody, sulking thing he’s got going or he just doesn’t care. Once he’s close enough for Rick to see the guy up close, he mentally renames him as ‘Grumpy Male Model’. It’s counterintuitive to being a mental mouthful, not to mention the guy’s as much butch as he is a male model; unfortunately, the useful part of his brain that helps keep him entertained during these shifts has decided to be useless today. So, the new name stays.
“Hey! Watch the eggnog. Bitch,” He retorts, angling his cup away from Sam. “So Charlie, not to sound like I don’t want you here but when- how did you get here? Last I heard from you, you were in Tulsa.”
“My compliments to the chef then,” Crowley says, inclining his head. “I’d offer my services more often if I have this to look forward to.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, looking up, a little more subdued but the soft fondness still visible. “Did you need something?”
Sam takes a bite of his wrap, slanting a glance at Dean where he’s perched on the edge of the bed. Catching the look, Dean rolls his eyes. “Much as
The song is reaching its end when he turns around mid-dance and spots Dean standing by the side entrance to the library, watching on in amusement.
“I’m gonna-” Dean interrupts, jabbing a thumb in the direction of the bathroom. He doesn’t care about how awkward he might look scrambling out of the booth so long as he wasn’t around to hear whatever Cas was about to say next.
The quiet lasts until Dean pulls up at the gas station near the edge of town. “Gotta refill Baby,” he mumbles, not looking at Cas. He doesn’t wait for a reply as he gets out and sets up to get the tank filled.
“Fine,” he says gruffly. “We’ll bring them by after dinner.” He jerks his head sharply in the direction of the door. “Let’s go, Sammy.”
Balthazar arrives an hour later, just barely in time to help Castiel with the now steadily increasing amount of people wandering into the coffee shop.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas agrees, taking another bite of his burger. He chews it slowly like he’s savoring the taste, which he does for pretty much anything you put in front of him now, but Dean’ll take it for the well-deserved appreciation it is here. “This place was a good choice.”
Gabriel clutches at his chest, feigning hurt. “You wound me, Cassie." He directs big sad eyes and an over-exaggerated pout at Castiel. "I’m only looking out for my darling little not-brother.”
The faux leather of the seats squeak under Castiel as he slides out of the booth, grabbing his trenchcoat as he stands up. He glances back up to locate Dean, only to find him already out the door, shrugging into his jacket while digging through his pockets for the car keys.
