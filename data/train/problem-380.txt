Sherlock throws the whole carton away and turned to John, who was asleep in his chair, Rosie in his arms.
"Coffin. Problem: someone is about to die. It will be- as I understand it- a tragedy." Sherlock stared at the coffin, rubbing the thumb of his gun hand over his brow. "So many days not lived, so many words unsaid. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera." Eurus's face morphed from a poor excuse of sadness to sarcasm in a matter of words.
“John!" Sherlock panics Please no, wait, please don’t hang up! Do
“I’ll go speak with him,” Lestrade suddenly got up and started to walk away when Sherlock grabbed his arm and whispers,
“Sherlock? Did you order something?”
Mycroft frowned at Lestrade, who sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Eurus’ glee was evident in her voice. “It’s an elimination round. You choose one and kill the other. You have to choose family or friend. Mycroft or Lestrade?” Sherlock closed his eyes and slowly turned to Mycroft and Lestrade. Lestrade ran his hand over his mouth, realizing what Eurus implied. Moriarty flashed behind Sherlock, ticking with a crazed smile as if he could see them.
“How-” his voice breaks. He took a deep breath and tried again. “How am I supposed to respond to that, Sherlock?” Sherlock looked away, suddenly unable to meet John’s eyes.
“Moriarty?” Sherlock asked.
“This is my fault.” He looks at Sherlock. “Moriarty.”
“P.S,” Mary said, shifting slightly in her seat.  “I know you two; and if I’m gone, I know what you could become.” Sherlock turned to John, who was smiling at the screen, tears in his eyes.
“Say it. Say it like you mean it.” Running his hand over his mouth, Sherlock glanced at Mycroft who is still in shock, Lestrade seems to be in a similar state.
Sherlock looked at her, tear-stained face painted with confusion.
Lestrade stood up straight, took a deep breath, and faced Sherlock. Sherlock closed his eyes and looked away. Mycroft chuckled,
“Come on, John, answer the damn phone,” Lestrade said tightly. When Sherlock heard John answer, he looked up.
“Sherlock!”
“It’s for somebody who loves someone,” Lestrade said, studying the words etched in brass.
“Three…” Sherlock’s voice started to fade, fighting the drugs the dart delivered.
Sherlock gasped, looking like the weight of the world has been lifted from his shoulders. Both Lestrade and Mycroft let out a sigh of relief. Sherlock buried his head in his hands, crouching down.  The countdown stopped at 00:02. The screen showed John, face hidden from the camera, body shaking in silent sobs. Mycroft reached out, in an attempt to console his brother, but Sherlock straightened up, tears still on his face.
“John, this is for a case. It’s … it’s a sort of experiment.”
Sherlock is pacing in front of a client, John is diligently writing down details, neither seem bothered by the fact that the client is an old-fashioned ventriloquist’s dummy.
John stood in their living room, looking through the mail when he saw a white padded envelope with “Special Delivery” stamped on it. John called for Sherlock, opening the letter.
“You can’t!”
“In your own time.” Eurus’s face was replaced by the storm outside. Sherlock picked up the lid robotically and walked toward the coffin. Mycroft and Lestrade had started toward the door, but stopped, seeing Sherlock not following. He placed the lid on the coffin and lowers his eyes. His breath caught and a sob choked out.
finish him right now.” Eurus reappeared for a moment.
“This isn’t torture; this is vivisection. We’re experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats.” Opening his eyes, he raised his head to lean it against the wall. Mycroft looked to his brother with pain in his eyes. Taking a deep breath, Sherlock looked up at Lestrade.
“Five.”
“Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.” Jim Moriarty, the crocodile to Sherlock’s Captain Hook.
“I am not an experiment, Sherlock!” John yelled, a bit too loudly, his voice cracking. Sherlock’s eyes widen, panic evident.
“God!” he scoffs, putting his hands in his pockets, a cruel smile on his face. “I should have expected this.” His smile’s replaced with scorn. “Pathetic.” He snarled, “you always were the slow one.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow at his brother, not meeting his eyes. “You, idiot.” Mycroft’s normally quiet and controlled voice rose with each word until he was nearly shouting. “That’s why I’ve always despised you. You shame us all. You shame the family name. Now, for once in your life, do the right thing!” He nodded toward Lestrade, “put this stupid little man out of all our misery.” Lestrade looked at Mycroft in a mix of terror, anger, and something else.
“Because I know who you really are.”
“Now, please pull yourself together. I need you at peak efficiency. The next one isn’t going to be so easy.” A door slid open; Mycroft turned to look at the noise. Lestrade took a step toward Sherlock, opening his mouth, but closes it and drops his head.
“We’re not actually going to discuss this, are we?” Mycroft sniggered before turning to a shell-shocked Lestrade. “I’m sorry, Detective inspector, you’re a fine man in many respects.” Lestrade looks up anger flashing in his eyes. Mycroft turns back to Sherlock, “Make your goodbyes and shoot him.” Sherlock just stared at Mycroft, the same slightly puzzled expression on his face. Mycroft sighed impatiently and points at Lestrade. “Shoot him!” Lestrade stared incredulously at the man calling for his death.
“Six…”
“Of-Of course you can.
“Please, for God’s sake, just stop it,” Sherlock muttered.
“No. No.” He muttered. His normally inexpressive face twisted in rage. He brought his right hand back and crashed it down on the lid of the coffin, splintering it.  The scene became animalistic, Sherlock giving himself to his ID, smashing, destroying the coffin in hope that the ghost it held would be gone. He was no longer a man, he was a cornered animal, screaming in anguish, trembling on the shattered remains of the coffin. Tears of grief, rage, and pure frustration fall like the rain outside.
“No, I know you’re not an experiment. You’re my,” he scrambled for the right word, “…. Friend,” He winced. “We’re friends. But…. Please. Just... Say those words for me.”
“Hey, Eurus, don’t mean to complain, but this one’s empty. What happened? Did you run out of ideas?” Lestrade sneered.
John let out a humorless laugh. “You bastard.”
“Sherlock. Stop.”
“Hey, hold on now!” Lestrade interjected, “Do I get a say in this?” Mycroft turned to the detective.
Sherlock’s voice was quiet and urgent. “John, I just want you to do something very easy for me, and not ask why.”
Lestrade shook his head, shifting his weight, “No, obviously, it isn’t, otherwise I wouldn’t have asked-”
“Why?” Mycroft taunted, a picture of cold apathy.
Sherlock stares at a strange collection of “dancing men” figures on a chalkboard. John, by his side, on his laptop.
“The lining also seems to-”
Two shots ring out.
“Eight…”
“John, just please say it.” He blinked rapidly.
“Well, you listen to me: who you really are, it doesn’t matter.”
“Because Sherlock,” He took a breath.  He whispered like if he said it too loud then it would shatter.“Because it’s true.”
Thank you all so much for sticking with me through my unreliable updates! I love you all so much for all of your positivity about my writing. Thank you so much! <3
“When life gets too strange, too impossible,”
“I’m afraid that’s not your decision, Detective Inspector.” Mycroft reminds him. Lestrade looked to Mycroft.
“Nine...” Both Mycroft and Lestrade stare at Sherlock in horror.
“I love you.”
“I love you.” John’s face fell, then turned to stone.
“Look what you did to him. Look at what you did to yourself.”
“Thanks, Greg.”
“Stop it.” Sherlock hissed.
“John,”  Sherlock said, monotone. Lestrade’s face goes white as if he’s seen a ghost. They all know he’s right. Eurus, seemingly pleased, leans toward the camera.
“What happened to him?” Lestrade asked, speaking for the first time since he was pulled from the well.
Mycroft frowned and walked over to the lid of the coffin, leaning against a wall. Sherlock’s eyes started flicking from side to side, organizing invisible data.
“Yes, but why isn’t he answering his phone?” Sherlock's eyes flit back and forth from John to the timer.
“Sherlock, this had better be important.” John’s voice was scratchy like he had a cold.
excited.” Moriarty appeared on the screen, his voice so soft, making his words more painful.
can’t you?”
“Like they’ve always been there,”
“Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.” The flat reappears, John looks annoyed.
Also, I'm so sorry this has taken forever!
Sherlock turned away, shutting his eyes tightly.
“A moment ago, a brave man asked to be remembered.” Mycroft’s eyes widen in alarm.
When Sherlock comes in the room, John was holding a DVD with the words “MISS YOU” written on it. Sherlock sat on the nearest sofa while John set up the DVD. Starting the disk, John sat next to Sherlock, tension thick enough to cut with the harpoon on the wall. Mary was smiling on the television. Both John and Sherlock were in a state of shock.
“I can’t. Not to you.”
“Today, we are soldiers. Soldiers die for their country.” Sherlock studied his brother. “I regret, Gregory, that privilege is now yours.” Lestrade closed his eyes and rubs the bridge of his nose,
“Oh, one important restriction:" Eurus smiled. "You’re not allowed to mention, in any way at all that his life is in danger.” Sherlock grimaced. He faced the screen. “You may not – at any point- suggest that there is any form of crisis. If you do, I will end this session and his life. Are we clear?” Sherlock nodded, mechanically, and stepped closer to the screen, the speed dial ringing in their ear
(See the end of the chapter for
“You said you
“He’s not hurt, she just locked him in her old cell,” John said, still not looking at either of them. “What goes around comes around.”
I'm sorry! I know I've taken forever to finish this!! Please feel free to yell at me in the comments.
“Because,” Sherlock answered, slowly facing him, “on balance, even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing.” Mycroft blinked a few times before lowering his head in defeat. The detective finally stopped boring a hole in Mycroft’s head and looked at Sherlock in confusion. Sherlock faced Lestrade but didn’t meet his eyes.
“Seven…”
Eurus frowned, “No, no, Sherlock.” Lestrade looked to Mycroft before understanding flickers in his eyes.
“Her Christmas treat; five minutes’ conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.”
inside me.” He looked down and straightened his tie. “I don’t imagine it’s much of a target but…” Sherlock’s face, still stained with tears, twists in anguish for a moment. “Why don’t we try for that?”
“Damn it.” He looks at Sherlock. “He’s right.”  Sherlock fixes his gaze on Lestrade. “He is right,” Lestrade repeats.
“John, please, without asking why just say these words.”  John, seeming intrigued, Sherlock almost never said please.
“Well, not on my watch,” Sherlock said. Mycroft’s face twisted in confusion. Lestrade looked to Sherlock.
“Why, John?”
“Pardon?”
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice cuts off Lestrade. Lestrade slowly turns to the lid leaning against the wall.
“You say it.”
John and Sherlock hold hands, their rings clink together.
Sherlock returned to huddling in his blanket but looked at John. John was watching Eurus being loaded inside a reinforced cell inside one of the police vans. Sherlock’s eyes try to catch John's before quietly saying,
“Yes, very good, Sherlock,"  Mycroft interrupted "or we could just look at the name on the lid.” The brass shined off the dim light in the room, reflecting Sherlock’s annoyance. “Only it isn’t a name.” The brass plate reads “I love you”
John turned a page in the news.
“Hello, this is John Watson. I’m not here right now, please leave a message.”
“This is where I get off.” Moriarty chuckled. His blood-curdling smile replaced with Eurus.
“My Baker Street boys."
“Well,” Mycroft brushed some invisible dust from his shoulder, “I suppose there is a heart
John turned to look at Sherlock.
“I don’t know.” He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to fight the waves of emotion beating inside him,
“Ten…”
“I don’t know,” he said again. “I thought she would have killed you. Please, all I’m asking is for you to understand I thought I had no choice.”
Sherlock sighed, giving the coffin a once over. “Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I’d say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot six. Makes it more likely to be a man. Fit, regular exercise.”
“Is it good?” John looked away before answering,
The flat has been restored, looking almost the same as when John first stepped foot into 221B. John sits on the sofa, Sherlock is next to him. He reaches his hand out to hold John’s.
“What are you doing Sherlock? Why are you doing this?”
John spray paints the familiar smiley face before stepping back to look at Sherlock, who raises a pistol.
Sherlock, Lestrade, and Mycroft walked into a room. There was a small wooden coffin in the middle of the room. Eurus's face appeared on a wall next to the open door.
“Say it, John.” Sherlock stared at the screen unmoving.
Mycroft glanced at his brother, “This is all about you. Everything here.” Sherlock slowly puts his hands where the heart would be if there were a body in the coffin. “So, brother dear, who loves you? I’m assuming it’s not a long list.” Sherlock’s face paled as does Mycroft's. Lestrade walked to his side while Mycroft leaned the lid against the wall.
This is a shorter chapter, but I've made you guys wait, so, sorry!
Rosie takes her first steps without help. She takes a few paces toward Sherlock before falling.
“Please, I swear you just have to listen to me!” Sherlock was doing a very poor job of trying to be calm.
“You don’t know about Redbeard yet!” Eurus exclaimed. Sherlock lowered one hand and continued to hold the gun to his chin.
“There is a final court of appeal for everyone.”
Sherlock is cradling Rosie in his arms, she tries to reach his nose, making Sherlock give an actual smile. He turns to see John coming into the room.
calling,” Sherlock said, growing more agitated. John lowered the paper to look at his phone again. The clock reaches 02:27 as his voicemail starts.
“Yes, but it’s
you you’d need it because only two can play the next game. Just two of you go on from here; your choice,” Her smile widened, “It’s make-your-mind-up time. Whose help do you need the most – Lestrade or Mycroft?”
The next chapter will be the next challenge they faced (duh), but instead of John and Mycroft, it'll be Lestrade and Mycroft. Also, the "ID" is a Freudian idea, that is the animalistic side of your "persona."
“John, please!” Opening his eyes, John stood like a soldier, straight back, taking a deep breath, whispered,
“Well, what?” Sherlock snapped, looking at his brother with a slightly puzzled expression.
“I just spoke to Mycroft,” John said, not looking at either of them.
“You know why.”
“It’s not good, it’s not bad. It’s...” He sniffed and looked at the ground, “It is what it is.”
“Because,” tears staining his face, “it’s true, Sherlock.” The world seemed to weigh on John’s shoulders. He hung his head. Lestrade’s head drops too, he pinched the bridge of his nose. Sherlock's pale as a ghost, staring at John, in shock.
“Oh, God. Sherlock, if this is one of your games, so help me,” John sighed. Sherlock backtracks rapidly,
“Sherlock, stop that at once!” A dart flew out of a hole in the wall and hit Sherlock in the back of his head. He reached up and pulled it out with his left hand.
“Final thirty seconds.” The timer onscreen read 00:31. Mycroft lifted his head, intending to help, but no words find him. Shaking his head, he stepped toward his brother letting out a puff of air, and just move back to Lestrade. Sherlock still faced the screen, his eyes closed. Taking a breath, he found the courage to say those words he hadn’t allowed himself to even think about John.  John closes his eyes, fighting tears threatening to spill over. He steadies himself, before waiting for Sherlock to say the words he had wanted to hear four years ago at the pool.
Lestrade picked his way across the minefield of wood, moving to the shaking, huddled form of the youngest Holmes. Sherlock hadn’t stopped shaking, staring at the floor in the fetal position, breath still shaky, occasionally choking out a sob. Mycroft watched Sherlock, unsure of how to help his brother. Lestrade stopped a few paces from the shaking form.
Mycroft rubbed his hands over his face. He lowered them before stepping toward his younger brother.
“And here we are, at the end of the line. Homes killing Holmes.” Mycroft shifted uncomfortably ever so slightly while Sherlock continued to stare at his brother, determination in his narrowing eyes.
“Four…” Another dart shot Lestrade in the back of his neck.
“It’s very important. I can’t say why, but I promise you it is.” Sherlock agitatedly tapped the gun to his thigh.
“Shoot him!” Mycroft yelled.
“And they always will.”
“Okay, okay. Just one more time.” Eurus simpered. The ringing began again. The countdown read 02:12. Lestrade shifted his weight, unconsciously moving closer to Sherlock, Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose before looking again at the screen. John sighed loudly and folded the paper, standing up. His were red and puffy. He glances at his phone's and saw it was Sherlock calling. He hesitated. He picked up the phone. Sherlock had his forehead against the pistol, almost resting on it.
Eurus replaced John’s shaking form with her own face. She made a withering sound and asked, “Saved him? From what?” She chuckled. “Oh do be sensible. There were no explosives in your flat. Why would I be so clumsy? You

His shoulder still hurts.
onto the sand. This time his thoughts are more coherent, the pain sharpening things until it hurts to feel, think, see, speak. One moment of clarity before darkness takes hold once more.
So, he is alone when he falls.
He emerges from the shadows, and if it was any other situation, would have laughed at the melodrama of it all. He doesn’t laugh. Instead, his heartbreaks. Because he can see the delay as Sherlock’s mind catches up, watches the cogs whir and tick as he processes John’s stoic face and the unfamiliar bulky jacket. And there is a brief gap before the dots connect and all is clear, where there is nothing on that perfect idiotic face but doubt. Doubt in John. It clears as quickly as it appears, gaining his footing once more as he trades jabs with Moriarty’s shadow over John’s shoulder, but its presence is undeniable.
He is the unexpected variable, the anomalous result, the blip in the data. Of all the people Sherlock has met in his life, placated and antagonised, John is the first who has been more than just a passing stranger. He has lived with him, killed for him, aided in his investigations and now-
Now he was at Mycroft's event, and the building was filled with beautifully dressed people of which he was, for once, one. And he had very nice hair which
"The Audi that hit you. It wasn't an accident. Mycroft-and-minions now believe your cab was followed. The original plan was to snatch you from the doorstep when you arrived here, but your cab was blocked by the crashes. They crowded your driver from behind so she skidded, then rammed you when you didn't get out. They needed you out of the car; no one would pay much attention to a good samaritan assisting an injured man, but dragging a struggling one out of a vehicle would be noticed. The ambulance coming behind them blocked their exit, though, so they aborted the snatch."
"Oh, look at that! Well, that's very smart, now isn't it, Sherlock?"
“What I wanted to tell you is that the security detail told me to play up his injuries over the phone in case the call was monitored,” Murray said.

"I'm afraid I've put you in a terribly awkward position. It's been brought to my attention that Sherlock has applied for a marriage license. He is rather prone to impulsive acts."
"I'm not disoriented. Yellow was the car; the swan was white. I'm a doctor. I know I'm fine."
this—”
"Hi, Greg. Have you got change? I'm dying for coffee."
"Right, then. Well. This is...I haven't thought about marriage for a long time. Things have, um, changed a lot since then. The Army. You. I don't know if what I used to want still applies. Always thought I'd like kids, you know, but now I think I'd be a crap dad." His mouth quirked. "Seems I like juggling grenades too much. Got a taste for it and can't stop. Also, I'm pretty sure kids aren't something you're ever going to want." He raised his eyebrows questioningly and got a hesitant nod in return. "Yeah, thought so. Somehow I don't think Harry or Mycroft is going to give us nieces or nephews, either, so," he blew out his breath regretfully, "no kids. That's...actually a good bit harder to accept than I thought it would be."
“Believe me when I say names are hardly necessary.” The hand in his clasped firmly, warm and dry, and all right, an anonymous shag wasn't what Greg had been hoping for, but it would do. He let his fingertips brush the inside of the wrist just below the cuffs and didn't imagine the quick indrawn breath from the other man. “Would a thirty-year Talisker suit your refined palate?”
John had not taken into account that however alert he felt after the shower, he was still desperately sleep deprived and entering his third day without a REM cycle.
Mycroft wordlessly held up the surveillance photo.
Furthermore, Molly was being especially persistent today with the—he could only think of it as tidbitting behaviour, bringing coffee and biscuits and and lingering with obvious intent in spite of the fact he was a different
Not having had any basis for comparison at the time, Sherlock had dismissed John's remark about sex being better with someone you cared about as more of the cloying nonsense he was given to spouting when discussing his refusal to take a more practical approach to obtaining sexual release.
Greg hadn't made Detective Inspector by ignoring his instincts for danger, and something about Sherlock's smile when Greg had pressed the point about how

When the colonel stepped out of the shadows near the gate, John simply thought,
The deranged thing was, John understood this warped logic. But—“And what happens,” he said, “when you get bored of me? When you get frustrated that I can’t keep up, and you—you just go on without me, and—” Shit. It was getting hard to breathe again. Not
“Well, go on, let's see,” Mrs Hudson said brightly, leaning over and poking the tissue paper aside for a better look.
Sherlock crouched beside him and peeled back his clothing to expose the Svalinn-made undershirt beneath, prodding the area where the bullet had struck. Mycroft hissed.
Sometimes, in the darkness, he drowns.

Sherlock sorts through some relevant memories and struggles to deal with the aftermath.
“I won! I saved John Watson.”
John and Sherlock run side by side out of a large stone building with ‘Rathbone Place’ engraved on a plaque.
John stares with joy in his eyes, watching Sherlock holding Rosie so gently.
"Yes, yes, yes," Sherlock snaped, "and this- I presume- will be their coffin?"
“Where would you suggest?” He asked.
“It’s not empty, Detective. You’ve still got the gun, haven’t you, little brother? I
“Sherlock, I can’t have any idea what you’re going through. You’re being tortured. But, you’ve got to keep it together. That sister of yours? She’ll use that against you, more than she already has.” Lestrade’s voice strong, but quiet. Sherlock doesn’t lift his head as he speaks.
…………..
It's an interesting conversation. He has the sneaking suspicion that this man is a Holmes; he has only met one so far, but there is a distinct Sherlock-ness to the way this man holds himself. The smug expression is also oddly familiar. In another life, John thinks he might have had more fun with this interaction, fought back a little harder. But the dog whistle is being blown, and between standing in a cold warehouse with a man who has his therapist’s notes or going on adventures with a potential madman, it isn't difficult to work out which he'd prefer.
“It's got
The laughter bubbled out of Greg before he knew it was coming. “From this place? Good God, this swill is for kids who wouldn't know Laphroaig from Loch Dhu. Anything you've got back at yours would be miles better.” He hadn't meant to say that last bit. It'd just spilled out, like the laughter. “Greg,” he said to cover the awkwardness, and offered his hand.
It's several minutes before he remembers Holmes is supposed to be dead.
Sherlock grabbed the phone out of his hands. “Stay with him. Don't leave him alone for a minute, stand outside and guard the door of the operating theatre when you get there, and don't surrender your gun to anyone.

Sherlock shoved into John's personal space and snarled, “Don't lie to me, don’t
The thing was, he understood why Sherlock hadn't said anything to him. Sherlock to that day didn't understand why Constable Lestrade hadn't left the shivering, starved smart-arse who looked like a damned
in the world, genetically related or not. Sherlock did not yet have sufficient data to confirm that so it was still speculation at this point even though he was sure evidence would bear out his thesis eventually. He had a plan to test the theory. It involved a great deal of travel to collect data. Oceanic routes would be most effective for the purpose,
"My clever John," he breathed, put on a charming smile, and went to introduce himself.
"I—" John was so empty. There was no-one in that shell sitting on the edge of the bed, the bed that was still rumpled and wet, that smelt of pleasure and warmth and soft murmured words. Didn't those words mean yes? Didn't their mingled semen on the sheets, the touch of John's lips on his neck mean the same as that stupid word? Why couldn't John see that? He was losing
in the wrong place.
“It is no concern of mine,” Sherlock repeated, but he'd paused just a fraction, was just a bit stiff, and Mycroft smirked.

you.  You're all safer if we catch the son of a bitch responsible for this shit.  I stay with you, you stay with little brother.  He’s a civilian; bound to be an idiot.”
“Right,” said Lestrade a few minutes later, shutting the door firmly behind him. “Just to be clear about this, your brother scares the shit out of me. First I hear there's an emergency helicopter called to his address—”
"I regret the necessary intrusion on your personal life."
He closed his eyes and rested his forehead against the handrail. He was going to have to wade in and search for his phone, then walk home with squelching shoes, trousers, and sleeves in the sleet because no taxi driver was going to stop for him. And his phone wasn't even going to work once he found it. Well, Sherlock would enjoy playing with the carcass.
He could do this for hours. He could do this for days. He hoped he'd have a lifetime to do this, to explore this man in every way possible, to let quiet passion run through his hands and his mouth and his cock, because Sherlock needed it, needed to be shown what he felt since neither of them was likely to say the words. Absurd but true: neither of them could choke them out, despite everything.
Even before John was fully awake for the second time, he registered limbs draped over him, hair tickling his face, a familiar scent surrounding him—and frigid toes digging into his calf. The light from outside was dim and dove-grey, a liquid mercury two shades darker than Sherlock's eyes. Sleet drummed against the windowpanes.
“Of course there's a connection with your work. I have a younger brother about whom I am greatly concerned. I wonder if you might agree to check in on him from time to time and let me know how he's doing.”
dogs, is it? They have to deal with humans. Which starts him thinking down an entirely new street and changes everything.
Monitors shrieked, the door flew open, dark shapes piled into the room, Sherlock shouted—John ignored all of it and concentrated on breaking every fucking bone in Banks' right arm.
Chemically induced pair bonding was even more powerful than he'd anticipated.

In August, he meets Jason and a friend at his local for pints. When Jason excuses himself on a transparently flimsy excuse and leaves the other two there alone, Robbie realises they've been set up on a date.

Now his tongue was doing something below his jaw and—
John didn't sleep that night, nothing at all like real sleep. But twice he was roused out of dozes that threatened to descend into ugly, bloody dreams by the strains of a violin being played quite badly by someone unable to properly hold a bow, and when he finally woke for the last time just after sunrise, it was to a softening erection and a warm slickness in his pants that left him confused and aching and feeling even more fucked-up than he had been before.
"We won't mention anything about your relationship to Sherlock except that you're his partner—you have no objections to that becoming public knowledge?—and let them make of it what they will. They'll assume Sherlock's brought you to meet me in order to, er—"
As always, unending devotion to
John tasted rain and cardamon and a hint of tobacco—oh, naughty Sherlock. And there was no mistaking the nature of the kiss, since tongue was almost immediately involved and Sherlock fisted his hand in John's hair and pulled him closer.

His personal physician was a woman of resounding good sense and practicality, thank God.
If he'd ever thought about it—which he never had, honestly
"No. Don't. No games, Sherlock." The man on the bed looked at him then, with eyes that weren't John's. "I can't even be angry with you. You truly don't think you've done anything wrong."
Humiliatingly, his cock throbbed at that. He let his forehead bump down onto the table so he didn't have to look at anything and wrapped both hands around his face. "Oh, Christ, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. It won't happen again, I swear."
Eventually they moved beyond kisses. He stroked and caressed, worshipping with his fingers, his lips, his gaze, with all his heart. Several times he had to stop and just lean their foreheads together, breathing steadily, forcing his desire into softer channels.
It was remarkable, John thought, just how quickly everything important in your life could go to shit.
Sherlock did that thing with his chin that meant he was nervous. "I need to find where the lips have gone." He swept off, coat purling and snapping even more than usual.
Murray answered with the unflappable tones of an Army nurse who'd seen it all. “John, mate, I have to say he's not looking good. The MI was bad enough, but they think a rib nicked his lung when he fell, too.”
“I suppose it was a difficult situation for them to sort on first glance, yeah? I mean,” John snorted, laughter starting to well up, “there's their star cardiologist on the floor with an enraged civilian bashing him up, whilst another nutter is yanking the IV out of the

That...wasn't actually a bad idea, even if it was Mycroft's.
John twisted his head around and brought a hand up to pull Sherlock's lips to his own, and events proceeded rapidly from there. A handful of fast thrusts and his climax crashed over him, a breaking wave of fire. He held John through those frightening moments when his mind was nothing but a featureless sea of sensation, held tightly to his infallible anchor, and came safely through to languid pleasure and the return of thought on the other side.
Moments later John ordered, "Okay, move now, move with me," and he gasped in relief. They began searching out the tempo for this particular encounter, discovering it would be slow, deliberate, ardent.
“Eliza—” he said, and couldn't keep the betrayal from his tone.
Sherlock had positively
The bundle Ava finds wedged into the high rafters is sickeningly small. Robbie takes her out to the dark car-park to throw her reward ball and tell her what a fine girl she is out of sight of Lestrade's team.
His bandages peeked out from beneath his cuffs, and John had a sudden, horrible thought. He whirled and caught Sherlock's elbow.
He was finally out of surgery quite a long time later, gulping nasty coffee and carefully watching his left hand for fatigue tremors, when a different bodyguard brought Sherlock to him—walking under his own power, thank God, but one sleeve blood-soaked.
Sherlock could unlock
to look away from her, to direct his attention elsewhere. Oh, she was very good.
But his life hadn't felt real since the Incident, and despite knowing the dangers of hope, he wanted to believe there was a chance of survival.
“You've never lived over there with those people, Holmes. You don't understand how they think. They don't respect us now, because of what you did. They fought us and we
"Oh, right. I didn't see much, so I doubt I'll be much help. Yesterday's a bit of a blur. Tea? I've just got the kettle on again. We've no milk, I'm afraid," he said with a pointed look toward Sherlock, who was regarding Lestrade with a peculiar expression.
“And you're using the wrong kind of rope anyway. Did you suffer multiple concussions on your tour of duty? Or—no, footballer, maybe? Blocked more than a few high-velocity shots with your head, obviously. Would explain the face,” he added nastily, and Harris really wanted to backhand the gobshite and splinter that poncy nose, but he didn't because he was a fucking
The rain was falling steadily now, pattering on the roof and the gravel paths.
Through all those months of agonizing and soul-searching, the biggest question John had kept coming back to wasn't
Everything he'd been struggling with suddenly became so simple.
When in the small hours of the morning he fell into a fitful doze, he dreamt of a t-shirt, rank with the stench of terrified alpha, undertones of piss beneath apocrine and adrenaline, and barely rolled off the side of the bed onto his hands and knees before he vomited bile.
He immediately abandoned his text and phoned Mycroft.
tailor, so keep that in mind when you answer."
John was rather looking forward to it. It wasn't as exciting as chasing murderous villains over the rooftops but it was a damned sight better than yet another bloody run to Tesco.
You need to get someone down to the wharves right away.”
His ears flamed when he recalled how that lanky sod had announced John's sterility as if remarking on his brand of shoes. Mike's surprise had been bad enough, but the pathologist's
"Hunh. Well, that solves the mystery—" Sherlock made an inarticulate sound of protest at the term "—of why you'd be applying for a license when we hadn't even slept together then. I did wonder."

Sherlock shrugged. “People see what they expect to see.”
. John's fingers easing into tight heat meant,
"Is he talking about your flatmate?" Terrence asked, shooting sideways glances at the very fit minder by John's shoulder.
“This won't bring them back, you know. No matter what you do to me, no matter what you do to anyone, the dead will remain just that.”
“About a klick and a half, north-northeast.”
Eventually he had to get up, because his back and shoulder were killing him. All the signs indicated Sherlock would sleep for hours yet, so John could get to the supermarket and back well before he woke and have dinner waiting. He felt uncomfortable leaving Sherlock alone, though, in case he sensed it and didn't sleep as well, or worse, woke to an empty bed and empty flat after the first time anyone had ever made—John's thoughts shied from the word, but it was true and he was not a coward so he made himself think it—made love to him.
John had gone away. He had agreed to the arrangement and then he had let Mycroft send him away, away from the flat and from Sherlock, who liked being able to find him at the flat, making it smell like
"I'm going to turn in early." John lifted Sherlock's legs and stood carefully from the sofa. The lines of his face were deep with pain.
# # #
"Oh my God." John sat heavily on the bed, and Sherlock stepped close beside him, alarmed. "Oh my God. It's Molly. She...um, I didn't even know they did that kind of thing anymore." Blue eyes looked at him out of a stunned face. "She gifted us six months of daily milk delivery. Oh my God. Oh my God. I think I love her."
Footsteps outside the door brought Sherlock's attention away from the slide with the tiny green flakes that confirmed the victim's brother's guilt. Could no-one on the Met be bothered to use their eyes? This didn’t even require rudimentary brainwork, just a set of working
"Is he?" Mycroft said brightly and pleasantly with a perfectly neutral smile on his face. "Well, that

As usual, Sherlock was sprawled over the entire sofa in his I Am Thinking Important Thoughts pose, which both blocked the best view of the telly and cunningly made him the focal point of attention in the room. John had long since developed his own way of dealing with this, which was to lift Sherlock's legs by whatever fabric they were encased in, sit, and redeposit the limbs across his lap without comment. He rested his plate across Sherlock's shins and settled in for the evening.
for her beta-ing expertise, everyone. (I'd like to thank her for making me snort and laugh inappropriately at work; I've had to cover with fake coughs so many times that my colleagues think I have TB.) All blunders are my own.
"I learned that it's considered vastly amusing that the lower classes expect fidelity from their partners," John said tightly.
Oh, this was just...delicious. He allowed himself an expression of pure, unholy glee and saw the former soldier instinctively recoil.
"I am familiar with the process of metamorphosis, as well as the proper terminology."
Gleefully, he snatched up his violin and skirled ecstatically until Mrs Hudson came up with tea and sandwiches (“Just this once, dear, as you've not had time to go to the shops.”) and asked if he knew any Glenn Miller.

With an effort, John filed that away for future exploration and resolutely turned his attention to cutting cloth away from Sherlock's injury. "What did you
Eventually he rasped, “All right.”
take a bullet when they were supposed to, but have you considered that if they're going to die either way, they might prefer to let the obnoxious bastard that is your good self die alongside them?"
John's eyes went first to the bed, to the patient and the monitors surrounding him. Mycroft looked like hell, naturally, and John ruthlessly shoved back the rising guilt until he had time to deal with it later. He picked up the chart, flipped through it, and frowned again.
As he was opening the car door, the tall poof came out of
"—so physical intimacy really is the most sensible solution. We will of course refrain from intercourse during cases—I can't have that kind of distraction; it's nearly as bothersome as eating—although you may masturbate if you really can't help yourself, since it doesn't seem to diminish an inferior brain the same way and tends to make you less irritating. So, we are agreed? John?
"Morning, Mycroft. Sherlock's in the shower. I'd say he'll be just a minute, but with him you never know, do you? Have a seat."
"I hope you like it. If the two of you didn't want a fuss then I certainly don't want to make one. Just your brother and John's sister there, I expect, and perhaps John wore that nice suit of his. I wondered why he was getting such a fine set of clothes and I—well, of course I
John didn't even bother sighing anymore. "Where?"
John recovered his composure quickly, but the fact that he needed to do so at all was...troubling. He poured tea and set the mugs on the table amidst the beakers, then sat, cupping the ceramic, staring sightlessly into the steam. Sherlock pushed a pair of retorts containing the remnants of his digestive-enzyme dilution experiment in a 115-degree arc around himself millimetre by millimetre and tried to avoid triggering him again, wishing he would just get on with it because waiting was tedious and unsettling.
John shook his head at that, scratched and yawned, looked down at the darkened love bites scattered over his chest, winced at his sore shoulder, winced again at his sore neck, and decided that under the circumstances he could go into the bathroom to piss while his flatmate was showering as long as he remembered not to flush without warning.

John's unsteady footsteps paused on the stair and then continued on to his bedroom. Sherlock perched on the back of the sofa and watched the fire burn down to embers.

Sherlock snorted. “Hardly necessary. Your coat is at least six years old and your seniority is embroidered on the breast pocket so you've been Head of Department for at least that long. Where and with whom you studied are irrelevant. I'm only curious as to why you specialised in cardiology.”
Greg cursed, low and vicious. “Did you know who I was before you pulled me?”
“The Colonel’d taken our translator—God only knows why, wasn’t like they were going to
look like a demented sea urchin, fuck you very much, Sherlock. The technical presentations were over his head, so he watched the crowd dynamics to amuse himself.
“Sh—Sherlock.” Mycroft's hand patted the air in Sherlock's direction. “He's not gone. Sent to Dower House. For you. Understand? Second chance.” His face twisted. “Don't mess this up.”
"What
Sherlock's face was tipped towards the wall, hiding his expression.
“This all sounds very rehearsed,” Sherlock said harshly. “Had a lot of time to practice, have you?”
"Dining room." Sherlock ghosted to his shoulder and simply stood beside him. John regretted leaving the jumper behind; the empty, cavernous room was bloody cold and that made his shoulder ache.
, who always makes things better (in spite of her indiscriminate slaughter of gentle commas).  Please shower them with praise and sympathy, because they have to put up with me.  All mistakes, blunders, and errors in judgement are my own.
"Need to check on Harry," John said, and Sherlock carefully manufactured a look of inquiry. "She's been calling, ranting about something, I can't tell what because she's totally pissed yet again. Probably another girlfriend's left her because of the drinking, so of course she gets drunk to deal with it. Oh, there's a message from Mrs Hudson."
"Hmpf." Sherlock turned his attention back to the Connie Prince memorial marathon.
John's lids drifted shut.
“Use whichever you prefer, then.” Finally he stepped in close enough for Greg to breathe in that scent that had been curling its way down his spine, and Greg cupped the back of his head and met his lips.
"The crash wasn't an accident."
been the one to capture this one...yeah, yeah, that would work. And it was probably better if Watson wasn't around to see him pulling a gun on the guy he was fucking because even professionals could get funny about shit like that.
He considered. “Yes, of course you’d wear boots, ex-army man that you are. Part of the uniform. You would be aroused by the danger and then we would have vigorous sex.” A slow, sly smile broke over his face. “And Mycroft would be paying for it all.” He nodded decisively. “I approve. Get the motorbike.”
# # #
He was drowning in sensuality. Regardless of how he bucked or writhed, John would not quicken the pace, would not press any harder, would not concentrate his attentions on Sherlock's erection. Warm hands and lips and tongue roamed everywhere, the arousal maddeningly diffuse, filling his entire body instead of focusing on the one organ he needed to climax. It wasn't enough, it wasn't nearly enough for orgasm, and it went on and on and on without end until Sherlock was so lost in a haze of desperation and pleasure he might have wept. "Shh, shh. Just let me. Just let me," John said, his mouth on a flushed nipple, and Sherlock's back arched helplessly as his hands clawed at the sheets.
"And to you?" John asked.
Then the lab-coated woman in the corner of the room made a sympathetic little noise, and John promised himself he could punch the shit out of something back at his bedsit.
Right, then. Home. He and Natalie need to talk, and for once he feels like it might not be the verbal equivalent of a root canal. He and a wagging Ava cut through the narrow passage between buildings on the way back to the car-park and home.
Heart slamming in his chest, he rested his forehead against the bedframe and swallowed until his stomach stopped heaving.

Some things had to stay wrong.
"That makes no sense, John. If it's going to happen eventually then it may as well happen now."
John paused his two-fingered tapping ("Blog Entry: Fowl Weather Day. Swans are evil sodding shits and what the fuck is with handing ASBOs out like lollies these days? Also, hospital vending machine coffee is too bloody expensive and my knee hurts like a motherfucking bastard. Does anyone actually have to have a license to drive anymore? Also, ice—"). "What's that?"

When he sat on the bench by the winter pond and tossed maize to the ducks, he wondered if that was really the best legacy he could leave behind.
“Do struggle, if you like. I've performed total globe avulsion only on cadavers and I've always wondered how different it would be on a live subject.” He wiggled his thumbs slightly as a guide for the anatomically ignorant and Harris lay gratifyingly still. “Drop the gun.” A
much longer. But Fitzhugh must not become suspicious or it was all over.
"Why?" John sounded amused. He was sipping his tea and taking this far too lightly. "And what agreem—?"
As ever, all blunders are my own.
that leapt through him like an electrical charge when he realised what John was asking.
Well. That's...that's...when Donovan had said "gets off"...he'd honestly thought that was just a rumour.
Cocaine was perfectly
, he decided, climbing the stairs. Large, near-continuous, post-orgasmic doses of oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine might keep John from noticing any little remarks alluding to their happy state dropped by others that might occur over the next few days. An inoculant of sorts against any uncharacteristic bouts of observation on John's part.
John's entire limbic system stuttered to a halt.
And so Harris, the idiot, never questioned Sherlock's tucking his bleeding hand in his trouser pocket as he limped slowly around the car to the passenger door.
They'd been watching some movie. Sherlock remembered that although he had deleted the title and everything else about it. He and John had been watching some ridiculous movie with tedious plot holes and annoyingly stupid characters and he had said, "John, if
to anyone. Appearances, maybe, so later he could say they all just went scouting. Anyway, I made a call to a mate of mine on another base who had a bit of Pashto, told him to please tell this kid I wasn’t going to hurt him, to ask the kid to wiggle his fingers, ask if he had any numbness or prickling and the like to check for nerve damage before I stitched him. So there was an off-site witness that he’d been in our custody and his injuries were documented.”
He regarded the state-of-the-art phone within, snarled, and threw the packaging into the fire John had kept roaring all day, wishing he could consign the damned phone to the flames as well. At last, with very poor grace, he submitted to the inevitable and slotted John's old chip into the thing.
“Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed. Er, is there some kind of...smell—?”
Sherlock himself couldn't stop moving. “Dark fox, receding hairline, air about him that says he enjoys enemas? Yes, Mycroft. Did he offer you money?”
"Well, I mean, if it was just family there then of course I wouldn't have expected an invitation but you could have told—"
In any normal household—one without a fucktard genius living in it—the fireplace would have been the logical place to start, but John knew the best odds were on the kitchen. Yes, Sherlock was there in a welding mask. John threw out his hands to grab the doorframe and stop his mad rush before he got closer to the torch without knowing the situation.
He shot a look at the clock.
He heard Mycroft issuing orders to someone in the office before returning to the phone. "We need you."
He threw his hands up. “I don't
"Was that—?"
John regarded him steadily for a moment. “Okay, then.” He levered himself to his feet and stumped over to his coat. “Your brother said he’d help me. I’ll just—”
Bracing his hands against the wall of the shower, he let the water run over his head until his breathing slowed. It was possible he was...overreacting a bit, because after all, this was good news on the whole. Sherlock might be an absolute cowardly knob-end, but now John knew his interest was returned. And he reminded himself he always did get irritable when his blood sugar was low, so probably he shouldn't make any important decisions before he'd had breakfast.
“If there's any chance this can work,” he said, heart pounding in his throat, “and I don't know if it can but if there's any chance at all, then I can't stay just because—if the only reason I don’t go is because I’m afraid that if I do, you—Sherlock. If you harm yourself, if you do

Right.
his motherfucking careers. And now his heats. One fucking bullet, and everything that made him worth anything at all, gone.
"Hah." Sherlock flung himself into his chair and began picking at the bun again. "See him get around
he puzzled, but then it clicked: scratches on the power connection, "From Clara"
John's shoulders slumped forward and he exhaled a long, shuddering breath. He scrubbed his hands over his face, then slowly straightened, and when he spoke again it wasn't John there at all but some walled-off stranger who wore John's skin and spoke with John's voice but wasn't John. "Tell Mycroft. I finally figured out—I realised—Malcolm Harris at the luncheon recognised the sound of my dogtags and looked at my shoe first. That's where we wear them, on a boot, so that if we get blown up they're attached to the part most likely to be found. A civilian would have looked around my neck. Tell Mycroft. I think that's your spy."
team. Mycroft, who knew everything and anticipated everything and used that to his advantage,
At first, it had been hilarious. John had sniggered to himself in the queue for tea, ridiculously chuffed at being cleverer than Sherlock. He'd seen through Sherlock's smokescreen and was one up on the git, and there had to be a million ways to take advantage of that. But then it had sunk in.
He was three steps up the staircase when he heard,
The front of his trousers was wet over a very prominent erection. John stopped trying to stagger forward and disbelievingly pressed a still-shaking hand to the patch.
John Watson is ten years old when he falls from the old oak in his backyard. His mother is at work, his father at the local pub. Fifteen years old, Harry is a creature made solely of eyeshadow, pop music and the sickly-sweet smell of strawberry bubble gum, with no time for little brothers climbing up trees. She exists in the periphery of consciousness, out of sight, out of mind. It goes both ways however, his disinterest towards all things female and the dismissive way she interacts with him meaning he doesn’t particularly keep track of her location. But she’s not there as he wedges his foot into the first foothold.
And for the fifth time in his life, John Watson dies.
“It was nothing.”
John.
But when it comes down to it, that doesn’t matter. It’s the angle at which he hits the ground that matters, the way his head collides with the dirt and his necks snaps.
His name was Redbeard and he was everything.
He wakes up briefly to headbutt the man strapping him into some kind of vest. The flash of smugness he feels at the audible crack of bone disappears quickly as he slides back under, gets hit by a car, and then wakes up again. He’s never been a fan of the chlorine stink and thick mugginess of swimming pools, and he has the feeling that’s not going to change after this ordeal. John has never been kidnapped before. He wonders whether the novelty of it will ever wear off, finds himself struggling not to laugh at the thought. That’s what you do when you align yourself with Sherlock Holmes; Accept the idea you’ll probably be kidnapped several more times in the future and try not to laugh about it.
“We’re here. You, uh, you were saying my name. In your sleep.”
. Down into the depths of his memory palace, in search of something else. Something quieter. If he cannot find silence, peace in the cold waters, surely he can find gentler tides.

He shoots himself the fourth time. It’s not that big a deal. The Sig has been sitting in his bedroom drawer for weeks, and its eventual use was inevitable. He wakes up with a headache and the bitter taste of gun powder in his mouth, not to mention the hollow ache of disappointment that grows within his chest.
Hello! It has been a little longer than I was hoping, but I'm here! I did it! Here ya go kids!
Death simply doesn’t stick to John Hamish Watson. The mysterious healing properties he seems to possess do nothing for a sprained wrist at rugby practice or a barbed wire gash during training; only when his heart has well and truly stopped is the evidence of his death is erased. Wounds closed, bones mended, heart restarted. Pain numbed, only an echo remaining. The stiff neck that bothered him the entire summer of 1981 a reasonable price to pay considering the broken neck that caused it. The throbbing chest and shortness of breath during finals week less than ideal, but better than lying dead in a ditch as a result of some coward with broken headlights. He is thankful that these sensations, just like his deaths, never seem to last.
It’s a good tackle, carries them both straight into the pool. Away from Sherlock, away from the danger. He’s never been blown up before. He doesn’t know what the limit on coming back to life is, whether he needs any body left to regenerate
John Watson lives again.
The lifespan of the average Irish Setter is between twelve to fifteen years. Redbeard lasted ten, five of which he spent in Sherlock’s company. He woke up one morning to his parent's worried faces and a fumbling lie that the dog had been lost. He had suggested mounting a rescue mission, sending out search parties, anything other than sitting inside and dealing with the drawn and anxious expressions people kept casting him. It wasn’t until Mycroft, having driven down specifically for the occasion, sat him down and told him that Redbeard was not coming back that the urgency and manic energy of the day bled from him. The memory is… difficult to recall. Its room in the palace of his mind is dark and dusty, the names and places and faces within shrouded in faded cloth coverings that coming apart at the touch. Everything lacks
His parents could have found the body, but the empty grave begged the question… why? Why hide the corpse, what could have been so strange or so horrific that they couldn’t even give their son the reassurance of a funeral?
John Watson is a boy of skinned knees and torn jumpers, bruises and dirt streaks. The tree is his tower, a place that is his and his alone, above the world of drunken rows and tired eyes. He knows every knot and groove the trunk has to offer and has scaled its side more times than he can count. Falling is not a rare occurrence for John

forgets that. No matter how far he stands outside of society and their bumbling rules, he is not above the biological timetable. And this child that he once was, wild-haired and wild-eyed, had a dog. It would be idiotic to ignore the fact he had parents, a rather tiresome older brother and a nanny as well, but it was the dog that mattered.
it. And Sherlock hates giving in to his demands, hates how this one man thinks he has any power over his actions. Watson compromises his experiments for the sake of ‘hygiene’, smiles at all of Lestrade's jokes, smoothes over the ruffled feathers Sherlock leaves in his wake effortlessly, without even asking. But John also lets Sherlock store parts in the fridge, calls him brilliant, thinks he's someone worth fighting with and for.
It is not a particularly dangerous fall.
Pulls John out.
As awkward, stilted moments go, John’s had worse. Sherlock, the force of nature he is, ploughs onward with his deductions. He seems unwilling to be slowed down by anything as trivial as an aborted proposition attempt, and who is John to stop him. Instead, he watches as sherlock answers his questions just as quickly as he poses them, the conclusion he reaches that is close to manifesting into an actual lightbulb above his head. Then John is being dragged away from his pasta into the streets of London, once more following after the flap of a greatcoat. The taxi that Sherlock makes him run after is not the one they’re looking for, he’d make a joke about droids if he wasn’t so sure he’d be the only one laughing, but he doesn’t care. Because when they make their way home, ignoring the sting of failure, they fall into the entranceway breathless, eyes bright. John hasn’t felt this way since before his third death.
they know each other?—before stepping in close to speak to John. “Listen, about his injuries—”

So for twenty minutes (more or less) he walked (okay, stomped) away from the man he'd told repeatedly he wasn't leaving, because he was furious and feeling manipulated and the alternatives were doing something terrible to Mrs Hudson's walls or saying something to Sherlock he would later regret. He took the route to the footbridge he liked because the boards made satisfying thumps when he clomped over them.
Draped bonelessly over the sofa, Sherlock heard footsteps on the stair, heard concern and resignation and irritation, and heard too that yes, John was more than a little drunk.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet, nothing you'd feel uncomfortable with. Certainly nothing treasonous, as you're likely imagining. Earlier today you met someone: Sherlock Holmes, my younger brother. I worry about him, constantly. It would ease my mind considerably to—No, no, don't answer me now, you'll only refuse. You feel manipulated and threatened, and you won't allow anyone to have that power over you. You have,” the omega consulted the brown notebook, “trust issues. No matter. I can tell by your left hand you'll be moving in with him. We'll see each other again, John, and perhaps you'll have reconsidered my offer by then. He's perfectly hellish to live with; you may come to feel you deserve some compensation for it.”

Later, though, Robbie surreptitiously checks the report and confirms that Holmes was declared dead on impact.  He subsequently nudges Jason towards live tracking for Pixie—subtly, he hopes.  No point in hurting anyone’s pride.  If Jason notices, he never mentions it.
Mycroft almost pushed it. He almost said John's trousers would have been truly ruined only if they'd been dropped on the street of that revolting alleyway as they'd been well on their way to being. He almost said it, because he had to know. It was critical he discover how vulnerable his brother was about this, how deeply a blow to that spot could strike. He almost did.
"Right." He nodded to himself. "Right, then."
. And that’s still not the end of all this, because if they were going to cover that up, they had to get rid of the kid.”
Sherlock's derisive snort was overshadowed by his obvious preening. "Basic, John," he said, but he caught his gaze in a scorching eyefuck that sent John's heart thumping against his breastbone.
"Eventually, if you insisted. I have no intention of keeping you prisoner, John, but surely it would be better to make no rash decisions?"
John shifted the ice pack against his jaw gingerly. Sherlock kept up a steady stream of senseless patter designed solely to remind the man beside him that he was in a London hospital.
My thanks, as always, to

"Jesus." Greg watched him swing up onto the low balcony and bounce along the top of the railing on his toes. "He's like a three-year-old on a sugar high."
“So your justification for forging my signature in the fucking register is that Mycroft gave me a job? You—you—” He stood up and pointed to the sofa. “Our very first night at this flat, you posed yourself
"Do you realise you hold yourself as if you're going into battle tomorrow?" Mycroft asked over evening brandy. "Try not to do that; it's always noticed on some level." John mentally translated that exactly as he was meant to:
God damn the bloody Holmeses. Couldn't even leave a man's private thoughts alone, could they? "It's...fine."
Mycroft ignored Fitzhugh and the handgun in his lap.  He made his way to the decanter, posture erect, gait even.  He kept his back to the man and placed his hands on the table, arms spread wide, clenching his fingers tightly on the edge as if in anger.  In truth, he needed the support.  Breathing was increasingly difficult and he dared not let Fitzhugh know how unsteady he was.

changes him as much as that night. Even after Afghanistan, it is dreams of dirt and cars, not sand and bullets, that leave him frozen and panting in the harsh light of dawn, hand trembling as he clutches onto the mug of tea that has long since cooled.
. Things unfold quickly, at a pace John hasn’t experienced since the war, and he can’t seem to find it within himself to regret that. There’s a candle on the table and a wry smile on Sherlock’s face and John is pleasantly warm from the wine in his glass.
He jolts awake, with a gasp
Sherlock had asked him once, on a boring rainy evening, why he thought he had survived the war when hundreds of young men had died by his side. It was an admittedly cruel question, but some disagreement or other had prepared him to test the lines both men had drawn on the first day of moving in. He found himself disappointed, as the conversation itself wasn’t particularly enlightening. After months of tracking the good doctor’s behavioural patterns, it was easy to predict that upon any mention of war, the man exhibited anxiety, anger and often, if pressed, disassociation. On this particular day however, before he could move from anger to disassociation, John did something peculiar. Looking up from the newspaper in his hands, he smiled, that strange baring of teeth he often did right before a fight.
But Redbeard? He put a stop to that in moments. With a hound at his side, battling against the sea and the troublesome men who sailed it, things like the hollowness in his chest or the blank looks in his classmate's eyes didn’t matter. Children were stupid. Brothers, who would rather experience the tedium of university then play pirates, were boring. Parents, spending more and more time tolerating his presence rather than actively seeking it out, were tiresome. Redbeard, on the other hand, loved him and would rather walk the plank barking happily at his side then abandon him.
70% of the animals hit by cars are dogs. The chances that his trusted companion was rotting by the side of the road, forever waiting for him, were high.

is theirs. He’s tired, he’s aching, and he has the strangest feeling that he’s being watched.
For a moment, Sherlock sees his future. Not in any moment of clarity, or religious experience, but in a rush of sheer statistics.

for this. I need data. Phone him!”
He pawed off the pair of jeans that had just hit him on the ear and sat up flailing. "Huh?"
He let several minutes pass before speaking again. "My brother appears self-contained, but in reality he is influenced by the people he admires. I did not care to see what he would become under Victor's continued influence. Unfortunately he had become deeply attached by the time I removed the man and...did not take it well."
John rolled his eyes. Yes, of course the man who thought putting product in your hair meant you were gay would think having diabetes meant you'd specialise in endocr—
Lestrade's jaw went oddly rigid for a moment. He cleared his throat, swallowed, and said, "No trouble at all."
He spent Sunday thinking about possibilities.
In front of a door midway down the corridor was Murray, sat in a plastic chair with his revolver resting in his lap. John frowned. Mycroft ought still to be in surgery, oughtn't he?
So instead he said mildly, "Ashton has his measurements."
“Yes?” he asked urgently, fingers already fumbling at the belt. “Yes, can I?”
During the months that followed of surgery, septicaemia, brutal physical therapy, sterile rooms that smelt of antiseptic and, later, a sterile bedsit that smelt of mildew and solitude and uselessness, John needed to believe that shot, the one that had ended both his careers and sent him home and meant he was never questioned about the Incident, had come from an enemy sniper.
