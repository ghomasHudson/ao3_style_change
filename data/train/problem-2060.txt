"You're…British?" Lestrade asks, starting off down the hall. "I thought you'd have to be American to be in the FBI."
Sherlock knelt before him.
"I'm afraid I'm of a similar mind to finish what he started myself." He said coldly. "Apologies."
Sherlock sighed. “I suppose so. Do you want her to find us?”
Myrcoft had nodded, and Sherlock had assumed it had ended there.
“Evening.” Sherlock says to the man sitting perfectly calm, as if he was waiting for a check-up.
"Mikheia. You know I can't. John can't. You have so much to lose. We only have each other."
Why was he being so hostile about something so trivial? It was about John. John was never trivial. This was poking at a wound still bruised, purple and yellow and not healing, not even close to healing.
"Oi," he protested, rolling over to face him. "I'm sorry you're saddled with such a dullard," he teased, "But I'm not completely empty up here, thanks."
"Was the hunger strike the worst of it, then? Went without dinner some nights like a badly behaving kid in time-out?" He asked with a bitterness he didn't mean in his voice. "I'd say I don't think you know what I went through, Sherlock, but I think you do."
“—and that’s irrelevant anyways, you know I’d have taken anything—” Sherlock cuts off with a pause then a vicious glare. “
He approaches the drawer marked with the only words that have ever mattered to him, the only words he can think of, and tries the first key.
That had been two hours ago. Sherlock had stayed in the kitchen, staring at the space where the tags had sat, smeared with dried blood and flecks of gold until Lestrade had arrived to whisk them off to the Yard for analysis.
They sat for a moment, watching the sun reflect off the lazy water, flowing like there weren't bigger things to worry about. The banks of the Pech had always been John's favourite spot to come to if he had any sort of free time when they were re-supplying. Sometimes he had friends with him, sometimes he didn't. He didn't remember feeling acutely alone there until the one friend he actually wanted there with him was dead, his head destroyed by shrapnel. He'd been a good friend too, quiet, intelligent, protective...John would be in a state of denial if he said Sherlock hadn't reminded John of his friend in their first months of acquaintance.
“Mikheia…”
Sherlock stood there for a long moment, watching as Moriarty walked away. It would be so easy to end it, all of this…a simple snap of the neck and he would crumple in the snow like a doll—
to catch this person before they get to you! I will
striking at the walls of his skull as he’s yanked into consciousness.
"Water." John croaks. "Get me in the water."
"Only conjectures."
"Did you kill him?"
"We had a deal." Sherlock's voice emanates lowly.
“Sorry, sir.” Mikheia smiles apologetically.
"Sherlock," John's tone was heavy with warning. "Don't—"
They broke apart as the train stopped.
!" Lestrade cuts in, smiling widely. "How did it go, then?"
"Yeah…"
But he could tell his mate was too polite, too kind to really tell him what he was thinking:
"What?"
“Who was that?” Mortimer asks, looking into his side mirror. The man is back for a moment, but after a passing tree blocks his view, he disappears again.
Sherlock's heart awoke from its dormancy with a roar. It felt like it had been torn out and replaced with someone else's, with a new transplant that his body was rejecting. It sped on and on, faster, quicker, unstoppable, breaking free of the reins as it thundered onward, wild in newfound freedom.
“You’re speaking of love, then.”
have crimes on you giant ponce, and if you'll remember I have asked you to the last three scenes, but you've been holed up with John, which, I might add, was a relief to find out considering the things I thought you were up to, and can we
"I think we both do." Mary said, gently exhaling smoke.
He'd already found where the man kept his bullets hours earlier. Honestly. He'd have to try harder than that. It's like he was
“I think that may be the first time you’ve asked me that in two hundred years.”
He doesn’t answer.
"Did you want me to be?"
“But..” John prodded.
I am not there; I did not die."
Sherlock turns his head and the look on John’s face wipes the mirth from his own.
Lestrade does not believe the call at first when he gets it.
John arches against his binding, muscles taut against every inch of skin, but he isn’t screaming yet.
“—Because he’s sending me to Moscow.”
"I won't run from you if you won't."
A giant series of arches that he had mistaken for an aqueduct from far away comprised a large exaggerated pen of sorts, a giant fence that vaguely resembled the Colosseum, pristinely white washed as it stood guard over the Volkhov River, which ran smoothly in front of him, the lazy current lapping at the cool wind, continuously turning as if it were tanning itself under the clear, bright day. Each arch was a world all it's own, a quiet den of privacy, for an iron fence running behind him separated him from the park and each of his sides where blocked by the curving beam. Standing underneath the arch gave him a sense of comfortable stillness, like arms reaching up to cage him in and protective hold. Sound floated from all sides, conversations and chatter and laughter. He wouldn't be surprised if at night the spot turned from scenic tourist hangout to scenic hangout to buy drugs and other illicit materials.
“I am a
He closed them.
Sherlock takes a step forward, crowding into John's space, but John doesn't back down and they are left standing almost chest to chest.
"No you weren't." John said surely and Sherlock looked to him for explanation. "Your mouth gets all firm when you lie and it looks like your nose tightens and almost pointier, if you can believe that. You get this—this
." He repeated, tasting the word, his smile marginally broadening.
His feet carry him onwards, through the wet streets, as rain dampens his coat, making his shirt paste to his skin.
He looked up, glancing at the man who sat across from him at the table.
“I thought I was going to die on the train to Amsterdam.” He said quietly into his arms. “Do you remember?”
Sherlock turned, his face full of coldness.
“Trick of the trade.” John says with a grin that isn’t his. “Enjoy the dog park, lads.” He winks, before disappearing. No flash of smoke, no wings bursting forth, only…there one moment, and gone the next.
“Sometimes I wish Georgiy had never pulled me out of that river.” John admits quietly. “I wish you hadn’t saved my life.”
John looks up at him and sets his fork down as his face scrunches in mild bemusement. In the light, Sherlock can see faint swirls and smudges of black beneath John's skin, almost like veins, as if someone had drawn on his insides with a pen. His wings flutter happily in the warm cosiness of their booth, shaking off the dark rainwater.
. He’s been coming too much lately, since John left. He’s found too much solace in the place. It was his slippery steel fire escape, jutting invitingly out from the warmth of his domesticated life into the night of unknowing, into the cold darkness of an escapist existence. If it got too hot in his flat, he could just…step outside, into somewhere else, somewhere cooler.
. He feels like he's been force fed cotton balls, the back of his throat raw and dry from the NC plugged into his nose. As he tries to move he instantly regrets it. His chest is bruised and tender, twin squared spaces on either side stretched taut, reddened and stiff and irritated; that'd be from the shock paddles then.
"Feeling a bit peaky, are we?" John asks calmly with a raise of his eyebrows and subsequently ducks the embroidered pillow Mrs Hudson made them as Sherlock tosses it at his head.
"I don't know."
—!” He shouts as Harry speeds through the light to the blaring horns of irate drivers. In the blink of an eye, the man is gone again.
Sherlock makes a noise at the back of his throat, fingers thumbing circles on John's waist.
He would let him in, if it meant forgiveness. If it meant being loved completely and wholly. It scared him, to let John into places that no one had been into, into locked rooms with stale air and rusted locks.
It starts right after his deployment, after he'd invaded.
“No,” John shakes his head, “it wouldn’t look good on his record and his parents would raise hell, probably claim self-defense. Listen, Molly,” he continues, sobering a little, “Sherlock—Mr. Holmes—he said you were there with a biker. I don’t remember much but, if I have it right, that biker was Billy Wiggins, wasn’t it?”
They had laid together for another hour, unwilling to leave their room, pressed front to back and as naked as the day they were born. Despite their previous activities, however, there was very little innuendo to be found in their actions, just simple intimacy. Twin souls comforting each other, embracing as closely as possible as if osmosis could be an option.
His gaze sweeps over her and she gets the feeling that he can see through her. That he knows. He must. Oh God, he knows.
“He’s on vacation.”
They sat there on the tiny bed, looking down into the street below. Sherlock reached out, grasping John’s hand in his. A cool breeze brushed through the night air, and John gripped his hand back, just as tightly.
Sherlock turned to look at John for the first time. The wind whipped his ash-blonde hair back, leaving all Sherlock's focus on his face, solemn and resolute; his unwavering blue eyes were the color of the clear sky above them.
I shake my head, I want to rid myself of the light, shining so bright it’s blinding me; makes my head ache; I taste salt on my lips.
“Yeah, well you try staying in New York for that long. I can’t believe we didn’t starve.”
—John, don’t you see?” Sherlock exclaimed, tugging at his hair as he spun around. “We’ve been through this before, and it’s like nothing ever changes! You went to the Ottomans because you wanted something new, some kind of stimulation I couldn’t offer, and I let you go even though I wanted you with me. I always want you with me, I tell you, always, and yet you continue to undermine and negate that even when I tell you it’s true. Haven’t you heard me? Haven’t I said it again and again?”
"May I ask why, out of a plethora of zoological choices, you chose a panda?"
A curse from inside. The oil lamp dimmed, and the house took on a synthetic silence, as if someone were afraid to move.
"It wants pink."
"OTHERS because you did not keep
naked."
John is his small kindness, his candlelight in the undulating darkness.
“You really think you were doing me a favour.”
He stepped forward, holding John at the crooks of his elbows. “I have never seen you as a burden, John. You are always, and continue to be, the greatest and most precious thing. You keep me human, you remind me of what it means to live with selflessness and kindness, with compassion for others. I may not act on those feelings, but they are there, and it’s all due to you. I was never a good man; I’m selfish, condescending, I rarely think of others, I have a superiority complex the width of the Thames…but you make me want to be good. I’ve always been grateful for that.”
"Is that what he's let you believe, John?" Moran said then made a sympathetic sound. "Love can be so boring to those that are above it. Sherlock and Jim, they play with us and we let them because we enjoy it. They let us think that it's love, but it's just a way to pass the time."
“You know,” John murmurs. “Sometimes I wondered if you actually loved me, or you just thought you did.”
Mortimer nods.
He'd known better than this. He'd known
Sherlock raises an eyebrow and glances pointedly down at Gladstone, still dozing on the rug.
He always found it odd that people thought nothing bad ever happened on Christmas. He found it odd that they thought that muggers and thieves and murders would look at their calendars and say 'Oh, well it's Christmas Eve, never mind, I'll just kill you tomorrow'. Of
"It depends on who you ask."
"How much time have you got?" He asks and she laughs. "Some days I really question that myself, but I suppose it's because—"
John, screaming in pain as he imagined.
Slowly, Sherlock separated himself, holding John’s head as he moved out from underneath his weight. Together, he and his brother took hold of John underneath his arms; Mycroft noticed his brother flinch as he tried and failed to keep his face still as John let out a low moan, his eyes still tightly shut, lost to fevered unconsciousness.
“A couple more days, looks like. I want to be out of here soon. I feel like I’m going mad.”
"Oh you say that like it wasn't a bad thing—"
"The train leaves tonight and all I ask is that you're on it."
"She wasn't lying, exactly. Didn't you ever wonder who the head of your agency was?"
Sherlock looked at him, allowing himself to notice everything he had skimmed over in the excitement and adrenaline of the morning.
"Really?" Sherlock grinned. Another kiss. "And what did you say?"
"Sure. Word was they took a few heads off Doyle's land not a month ago."
The party had gathered at Hampton Court for a stag hunt. The men were kissing their wives goodbye, their servants loading their horses for the long weekend trip. The hounds had been howling, eager to be released into the autumn foliage and the quickly setting sun.
"I suppose this is for some noble and lofty reason, then." Sherlock said, stubbing out his cigarette.
John registered the clicking of cocking hammers for one split second before—
A month in, he had nearly been hit by a car as he crossed the street before it swerved and avoided him. He found himself wishing that it hadn't.
He reached out a hand to skim the letters.
“I was going to do it that night.” Sherlock said quietly, and for a moment John wasn’t sure he had heard right. He started at his husband, eyes shielded by the black lenses. “I thought…if it was my last meal, I may as well treat myself.”
"You've realised by now that Moran lied to us."
"Mhmm." Sherlock answers, as if it qualifies as a real reply.
He would follow because, for a split second, he had misplaced those long, gangly limbs as belonging to someone else, someone that had been long dead for four years, and that split second was all his convictions needed.
"Fine."
Moonlight was streaming in through the windows, reflecting off the waters that slowly lapped in and out. He couldn’t remember why they had come here, what they were doing in this foreign place, these foreign words filling him, topping him over easy as a breeze to a feather. He was falling now, down into the darkness, falling as the voice called out:
The ocean was beautiful in the distance, sparkling in and out in magnificent shades of blue, and John still wouldn’t let him touch him, hadn’t allowed him to since just after Shanghai, nearly fifteen bloody years ago, and even that had been a half-hearted, quickly aborted attempt, one best left forgotten to time.
"There's strength in numbers, John."
"You are the bird whose wings came
Sherlock nodded.
“You are not special, Captain Watson. You are weak, like the rest of them.”
He'd try. Convince himself that he's winning. Buy Sherlock and Lestrade more time.
“Not near the end. Not much before it either…but at the beginning, yeah, she was.”
." Sherlock grabbed his face with his free hand, squeezing until John's eyes cracked open again.
He flips through the book, stopping at the last entry.
It stands on all fours, its paws long and spindling, with crooked, dirtied yellow talons at the ends jutting over its toes. Thin, angled limbs shoot up to support an utterly emaciated body covered in pitifully thin mangy patches of fur and waxy skin that's crusted over with cuts and bitemarks. Its skin is stretched taunt over ribs that peek out from the edges of the thick, matted fur covering its chest and neck, which seems to be the most grotesque part of the whole creature; the soft flesh has been ripped open in claw-like slashes, the deadened skin hanging in flaps over the raw muscle of its still-intact oesophagus, shining a dark pink and red as it swallows down water.
Sherlock that he would come back, and he would, even if it killed him. And it almost had. He couldn't even begin to think of what Sherlock must have gone through, seeing him collapse onto the door like that. He hadn't wanted to go that quickly, he at least wanted to tell him what happened, to tell him where he was hurt before he lost consciousness, but John Watson wanted a lot of things that never happened as he wanted them to.
"Yes. A little more each day."
Two figures lay in the greyness, corporal shadows in the pre-dawn.
“Piss. Off.”
Mortimer pauses pensively, wiping his hands on a tea towel.
"You had to go. I had to remain here. It was simple, Sherlock. It was so simple. But," John's eyes close. "But it hurt so much—so much more than I thought it could."
"I'm not done here." John murmurs. "I don't think I'll ever be done."
“Sherlock, I know you’re upset—”
He’d been hoping for something…well, something else. He didn’t know why. She smiled too often and too easily. He didn’t trust her.
to talk to.”
There is a storm over London, just as there is seemingly every night lately. Rain is no stranger here, but it's becoming a familiar friend that invites itself over one time too many.
“What he’d want me to do? You’ve become a hypocrite Mycroft, as you do so
Mortimer deflates, his defences lowering, and has the good grace to look ashamed. "Right. Sorry. I just—I thought that—"
“I assume she has his possessions, then?”
He hung up the phone and stood, stretching out the kinks in his muscles, a cool feeling of calmness rushing through him.
"The theory now is that he died of heat stroke—" Lestrade begins.
This investigation is in his most dreaded state, inaction. It’s too early to gather the information he needs, but too late to notice anything of value. The inspection of the flat while he was with Lestrade is more than enough information for him to know that any evidence Moran could have left behind was obliterated.
“No.”
He collapsed on the lawn, finding the hilt of the knife and pulling the blade out as quickly as he could. He rolled his head over to look at the open doorway, the porch door hanging almost off its hinges. He could see John, lying there, hand limply wrapped around the stag’s neck.
“We can’t afford to use absolutes. It’s happened twice already, or at least twice where I’ve witnessed it. We can’t say this won’t happen.”
“I don’t want to leave you.”
"Stay here." John says sternly. "Greg, make him stay here."
They both smiled. Sherlock let his head dip down, let his mouth graze John's as they stood in that second-class train compartment with signs in a language neither was particularly good at as it rocked gently like a boat amidst calm waves, one hand tightening in the other's while the other snaked around the backs of their necks.
There must be an open door for you
“Mikheia, let’s go, I need you to run, come on—”
"At least a century. Probably two."
John looks up at him and shrugs.
“In another age, when your race was younger, they came up with stories. Stories about witches and magic and mythical creatures never heard of to terrify and enthral their children. Let’s just say these stories had to come from somewhere, there had to be some truth in them. There were tales of gods turning themselves into animals from the people you call Romans, just as the Germans devoured stories of women with tails for legs and siren’s songs as hungrily as the Finnish and Dutch did. And you English, you so love wolves and bears and vicious and bloody things, don’t you? These stories are not all…inherently false. People do love fairytales. They love things that are darker than they are. Makes them feel better.”
John smiles and nods.
“Oh, I do forget now…doesn’t matter, really. I got what I wanted.”
"Idiot…"
As the car drove away he hitched his things up. Narrowing his most-prized belongings hadn’t been easy, but he had to travel light, so two bags it was. He'd scoured through his books at his place in Karachi, pouring over every one that caught his eye in case he might want to take it, not to mention his journals, his photographs, keepsakes from other lives. It had been hard, but it was worth it. He didn't want to delay now that he'd made his mind up.
“I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock said quietly. “I am, I have always been…a selfish person. I want the things that I want, at whatever price it comes to. I saw you, and I had to have you, so I did. You left, and I felt lonely, so I made you come back. I wanted out, so I found a way. Do you know what stopped me?”
But when thou art again in the sweet world,
"Yes."
Sherlock likes it better when John says it.
A chair scrapes against the silence. Footsteps, softly. A presence nearby, softly, in front of him. He didn’t hear the door open, which means they were here the whole time. Watching him. Waiting.
"Wanted to see you in a better light." Came the slow response, muttered against the hot skin of John's back.
John slowly gets up to follow him and stops as he pauses in the doorway. Sherlock looks down at him with a solemn expression.
“I have recruits coming. They won’t allow him to get what he wants.”
Most days, John figured he found it was worth it. He had not known of the dark thoughts Sherlock entertained when they were apart, and when he finally admitted to them on the lawn of Dartmoor after a night facing the spectres and hounds of the hall, John had watched him pant out the truth, that he was terrified of dying, terrified of the greatest and loneliest last moment of wasted potential and squandered time, terrified of the true death that would separate the two of them irreparably. He had gasped into the wet grass of the early morning that John was never to leave him, that he was never to go where he could not find him.
Mikheia stopped, freezing as a door behind them creaked open and slammed shut.
Then he had met Mary, his recruiter.
?" He snarls.
"You think I go by just one name? One face?"
“What, he didn’t tell you that?”
Nothing sounded better.
"Cold water to ease swelling?" John asked through gritted teeth as he leaned against the wall of the shower for support.
The drumming that pounded louder than it ever had as smoke poured into the sky. That offbeat rhythm of hundreds of drums, all out of tune with one another, creating that cacophony that made it impossible to think. Sirens. Shouting. Fire gulping down the air. Smoke billowing into the night. Feet pounding in the mud. Metal keening as it collapsed. The sound of air brushing against the sheets. Car alarms screaming as their bodies burned alive. The small huff of laughter John had made after he'd licked a spot on Sherlock's neck and he'd flinched. The heartbeat under Sherlock's palm, steady and constant. The shouting, the running, as the garage collapsed into itself. The sound of John murmuring his name.
It was on Christmas Eve, and, since John had no one to celebrate it with, he had found himself working the night shift at the medical centre. Mrs. Hudson had offered a cracker and eggnog, but he had politely refused her, just as he had refused Lestrade's invitation of dinner at the detective inspector's home. They were good people, good friends, but John didn't need any of that right now. He didn't need to be reminded of just how acutely alone he was.
"You've changed." John says solemnly.
“’Forget me.’” Alkaev sighs heavily, grief lodged in his throat. “’Forgive me. Love always…Cila’.”
"Are you alright? Did he hurt you?"
He discounts it as heartburn. He rushed his lunch, as Sherlock rang him in the middle of it.
"I take it from your silence that it could be either," Moriarty continued, "but we both know which one it was, don't we, my darling, dear, deprived Sherlock? Is The Virgin feeling a
“Evening.” He says as he sits, joining his hands on the table as he glances around. “Lovely room.”
Before Sherlock can say anything more about old habits dying hard, the door to the room opens and Lestrade enters.
, the door closed and he left, Sherlock waited out the night for him to return from whatever pub he had gone to, but of course Sherlock knew exactly where he was because humans were creatures of habit and John even more so. He settled into his chair, fingers curling around the ends like a stone grotesque burying its claws into Notre Dame, and he waited.
As he dressed he gathered his thoughts, putting a plan to action, lingering on those last few moments before he honored John’s request to forget him completely. By the time he shrugged on his coat and stepped out into the night, he wore no ring, he had no one to love, and had no memory of how he’d gotten that bite, right over his heart.
“Did you—”
Molly pales and John chokes on his coffee.
Mycroft didn't answer.
I waited long enough to get my school papers and make some extra savings on the farm, then I boarded the next train to Kansas City and took the Katy all the way to Texas. Even now, I feel how my heart hammered so — it seemed that every minute that passed I saw something new, something I'd never seen before. It's hard to understand today how it felt. Back then, the world was twenty miles wide. Sometimes you'd get news from names that drummed up certain images of fantastical, glittering places: Paris, London, Russia, China. The first war hadn't quite touched the remote towns yet, and the most I'd ever heard of it was when Geannie Grady's five sons all up and left Des Moines to fight in France and never came back. Well, George did, but in a box that word around town said was full of little tiny pieces of what once had been George, before he stepped on a land mine in Verdun.
"I'll try."
“I’ll be back later, then.” She said curtly, disappearing as quickly as she had come.
“If you were there, no. It’s the same for me, Sherlock. You must know that. It’s the exact same.”
There were so many things he wanted answered. If Sherlock knew of Mary's employment, if John was just learning it, then what else hadn't he been told? What else had Sherlock discovered and hidden from him?
The second time Sherlock had proposed, nearly two years had passed. They had not discussed it since the topic had first come up, but John had known, had always known, that despite his reservations, he would let Sherlock talk him into it, as he did with most everything. And Sherlock knew—as
Wrapping his legs around Billy’s calves, he steadied his grip and then flipped them over, groping for the knife beside him. Billy was faster, finding the handle and stabbing out blindly, burying the blade in Sherlock’s thigh. He shouted at the sudden, searing pain, falling back to pull out the knife, deeply embedded into his leg.
"John, if you're doing what I think you're doing—"
“Okay, just…” He takes a deep breath and exhales. “Jesus, just give me a moment.”
“Take him to his new office, gentlemen, if you will.”
"You stole my horse."
"Sherlock?" Harry calls behind him as she approaches, as if she doesn't want to startle him. Please. What could he possibly be
. He wants he wants he wants—he doesn’t know what he wants. He wants this hole to be filled or closed or at least not so raw round the edges. He wants to not hurt anymore. He wants to remember, he wants to not, wants to not
"John?" Sherlock says.
Suddenly he feels his throat close, tighten in on itself and convulse, and he’s on his side and vomiting and there is land beneath him, wet, muddy cold land and oh he is alive and someone is here and oh they’re saving his life. He hasn’t loved anyone else so much in his life more than this stranger. Or maybe he has. He doesn't know. He'll know later. He's sure of it.
He stood in the doorway, watching as Billy’s car left the driveway, and turned his face to the moon.
The boy startled and sprinted from the room. That was the first time he had seen the detective yell. He was always so composed, so in control, so sane, but now he seemed quite
"Really? Tell me how. Is there a tell?"
Like anywhere else, it was never too hard to get hold of liquor in Texas if you had a mind for it. Even after Volstead, the moonrakers kept working at all hours of the night, and the bars never reached the bottom of the bottle. I wasn't much of a drinker myself except on bad days, but I knew the rest of the men at the pump were, huddled in the back booths, nursing a drink of some kind or another, playing cards if it meant not going back to a silent, cold tent. Angelo ran a clean place, even if most of his earnings were under the table; sometimes there was the inevitable fight over money or a lady or just plain bullheaded ego, but most nights were quiet.
, anywhere it could get, ceasing to move the moment Sherlock plummeted off that rooftop.
?” Greg asks, startled.
"No," Mycroft added quietly. "She is not responsible for John's death. That honour belongs to the late Sebastian Moran who, if you recall, John managed to take with him."
“And if we find him?”
--//--
"The one time was enough for you, then?" John asks, but it sounds bitter to him. Let it. He feels bitter. He feels too goddamn uncomfortably
“It was fine. Well not—it was a funeral, Sherlock, how do you think it was?”
“A demonstration, then.” I murmur, lowering my face to his and capturing his mouth with mine for a moment before I pull away.
"Right," John says and damn him for dropping the pillow and dealing with Sherlock like an adult instead of indulging his desire for a fight. "How about I make you some toast and then see where we go from there—"
. I want to visit one room and one room only."
He takes another breath, as muddled and disgusting as it is. It has to be oil, has that greasy unmistakable smell. He looks back up to the train car, noting the fire damage—it's not recent, at least a decade old, so why this fresh burnt smell? And this particular one: it's the only carriage in the yard with this kind of damage. The others are all certainly out of date, but nowhere near as decimated as this.
"And do you remember Prague? When we were in the men's room?"
"John."
And so John Watson turned away from the world.
A great black tervuren sits in front of him, looking more like a wolf than a dog. It wags its tail, tongue lolling happily at the prospect of a new friend.
"Mikheia!" Sherlock yelled, and the boy rushed in. "Help me move him. Careful of his arms. I don't know where the blood is coming from—"
A "klick" means a distance of 1000 meters.
He’d told John then, in that hallway as their time ticked down and away, told him of what Moran was going to do, of what Mikheia had already done in retaliation, namely that he’d gathered packets of saltpetre and a block of sodium metal, pillaged them from the empty rooms of the factory, and bound them together in that little bundle that now lay in the bottom of the lift where John had told him to put it. He told John that Moran had his family, he told him that he wasn’t afraid to die for them or for John himself or for Sherlock, how he’d gladly do it, if it meant they would live. John had looked hard at him then, a look Mikheia had seen once on his father’s face, a look of a man who had decided to die for someone he loved. He’d listened as John instructed him how to ignite the package, how he’d handed Mikheia the matches that now rested in his pocket, how he’d told him to find a working car in the garage and hotwire it (Mikheia realised then that this was why John had asked him what he was good at, that day in the hospital after he’d been shot. John wanted to know his skills in case he needed them later)
“He says we have been the most exciting thing to have ever happened to him.”
Harry has it wide open by the time they get there, 75 steps later.
"Your point?"
Still lost in
"You know, I'm wondering what use our good doctor is to you Sherlock when he seems to bring out such ugly feelings—"
"Who sent you, John, really?" Sherlock asks softly.
Two heartbeats passed as John and Sebastian stared at one another, neither moving but both breathing heavily. The adrenalin burned through them both, thick with blood. Moran's hands tightened on John's flour-stained collar and John could almost hear his thought process.
"I always wondered why you were in that car after my first assignment." He looked at her. "Did they send you on purpose? Try to bait me in with a pretty woman that was as kind and patient as I needed?" He smirked. "It worked. Better than they know."
"No, I'm afraid I personally did not hire you." Mycroft said and John noted it with a grain of salt. "I'm afraid I can only waylay you from your real appointment for a brief amount of time." He tapped his umbrella on the ground. "No, I am here because your agency wanted me to assure you that if the situation gets out of control I can contain it easily, and faster than most."
—incredible.”
“‘Safe’?” Sherlock spits out, grasping at his hair as he paces at the foot of the bed. “‘Safe’? I never wanted to be
John lowered the gun, smoking in the night wind. He jammed it in the back of his pants, the point of the barrel still hot, and ran over, crouching beside the man. He was still alive, but the blood was rushing from his face, his body, into the sand.
Solace my game, solace my game
“Hardly,” John said. “Caetani was much more debauched. Still is.”
"It was three, actually." Sherlock corrected. "You hit the first one in his shoulder."
“The world.” Sherlock started. “Life on earth. The ignorance of us all, how little we care about anything but our own gain, our own proliferation, and damn those who disagree. I feel that no matter where we are, we are never living in an enlightened age. People act like
Sometimes he had a friend with him, a little fellow, with slick black hair; a sharp dresser, who favored the long, dark coats professors wore. He didn’t stay long, maybe a few hours at the most, and all they did was play chess. They barely even talked, and when they did, they said the oddest things.
"Safe?" Sherlock echoes. "You want him to be
“I’ve only been in love the once,” he told him, “and until recently I had no means of concluding that what I was feeling was abnormal or if it was something to be expected, and Irene, in her flawed logic, was correct in one thing: I could feel us drawing away, and so I retreated first. I weaned you off my affections and when I thought the time was right, I blocked the bond, tuned you out. It was…an act of utter self-preservation.”
, stop talking—”
. "There's a security camera, in the corner above my right ear, so keep your eyes on me." The man's eyes start to move to the camera but Sherlock banged his hand on the table. "Eyes. On. Me." He hissed at the startled contact.
"Promise me, Sherlock. You won't go anywhere until I tell you to."
, it was Sherlock's property, but now it is
“I know that.”
"Chemicals…
That night John bolts up in his bed, cold sweat trickling down his temples even though his head is hot. No, not hot.
“You complete dolt, I can’t—what?”
"Your opinion on matters concerning Moriarty are never
“And to you as well, Sherlock.”
"Any traces of Moriarty?" He asks before taking a sip of his tea. He didn't think an American hotel would have such a good stock of tea, but he'd been pleasantly surprised.
Sherlock turns his head and the look on John’s face wipes the mirth from his own.
"John, please, I—"
"You won't. You need him alive."
"No, but no one leaves without evoking the envy of the others, and if there's one thing that binds the Nephilim together, it's their collective fury. Like a mob or...football hooligans."
The question itself was not what bothered him; he was rather surprised she hadn’t asked with Sherlock in the room, or upon greeting them; Artemisia had little time to entertain etiquette before she would toss it aside and address the heart of the matter—the true eye of a painter, seeing straight into the bottomless color of things.
"I don't want you to go after him for me because he's not the one who—did this to me." John said, stiffly indicating his back.
"The Watchers didn't really remember enough dogma to record it." John says, sliding the strap of his bag onto his shoulder.
!" John yelped as the icy water poured over him, sending gooseflesh erupting across his skin.
So it didn't surprise him when the local hospitals called after being swarmed with E.R. patients and asked him if the clinic was willing to work as a temporary base. And it was no surprise when John, one of the few trauma doctors around, was assigned to handle the severe cases. He was the best equipped after all.
had been right with his neck in the noose, had been right with his gun aimed at John's heart, had been right in the bar when he'd dared John on, hand curled around his as he pushed him towards the trigger. He had been right: there had been a bullet left after all.
John nodded.
"Well he's something, isn't he?" Sarah sighs, the two of them staring through the window as Sherlock climbs into the police jeep, coat billowing behind him.
“You’ve heard my story—”
“And you expect me to believe you can’t find him, whereverhe went?”
“It’s too late.” Sherlock answers. “Both of those have already happened.”
"Yes…but
"Even if you prove me wrong, I will never agree with you." Sherlock says monotonously, the tone John knows he reserves for when he's sulking.
“Would you have believed me?”
"Let's have it, then," He said, gesturing to the bottle, which Sherlock handed him. He knocked the cap off and took a deep pull, wiping his mouth. "Come on in," he said, standing by to let them pass into the dark foyer.
“Fancy a quick one?” A passing woman asked, glancing between the two of them from beneath a mask with warped and leering lecherous features.
* * *
“I did, yes.”
He opened the door, and stared down at the messenger.
"Enough to share," Sherlock confirmed.
that's all the truth I know."
He vomits violently. Uncontrollably. Some sound escapes him, and he doesn’t know what to call it.
He hears the banging of crockery as John rummages through the cabinets and he shuffles to his feet. Whatever awaits him in there, it can’t be anything good, but it’s
“Family protects family. They do not cut off a broken limb. They help it. His brother will take care of him.”
Yes, this dream had been interesting. He’d have lingered on it longer, if he’d had the precocity of self-analysis, but that trait, along with patience and modest self-reflection, was one Sherlock Holmes lacked.
He was in love with John Watson, that much was clear already, and John Watson was also in love with him, but hadn't acknowledged it until just know, just when Sherlock himself proclaimed that love was for idiots.
“Yeah.” He murmurs. “More than anything…most of all.”
Something silver flashes in her hand and John feels his heart contract in fear. Fear and something else. Something cold and unflinching, a knot of stone and iron lodged in between his lungs.
"I'm the basest of them all. I only need one thing."
And now a gap of three years lay between them with no means of getting to the other side, no words to start stitching the wound with. So much to say and nowhere to start.
Impossible.
Mikheia nodded.
Mary Morstan stood in front of him.
“You’d face the pit again,” John calls in the vast hush, “knowing what waits for you if you fall a second time? You’d do that for him?”
, Sherlock! I want to know why. You say you love me—”
The term sounded clunky to Sherlock, because he was sure that, of all the things he and John were, they were not
“You love spoiling surprises, don’t you?”
"Why?" John frowned. "Why now? Because you learned I don't care much for being lied to? Because you learned it's not a good thing to hide important information from people who care about you?"
"I know." John sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I know you are. But that doesn't change the fact that you let me watch you fall, you let me believe you were dead. Friends don't do that to each other."
Mycroft is behind him now. He can almost smell the pity. The sympathy. The plaster on a gangrenous wound. Not three hours ago, it was what the petulance in him craved. Now it makes him sick.
“I hate her.” Sherlock sighed.
She pulls the head doctor aside outside his room.
Moran was knocked back onto the floor in a spray of blood and John willed all of his energy to look up. The chain of the cuffs was weakening under his weight. His left shoulder burned horribly, a deep, hot pain burning where that bullet once did. He'd have to find a way to get down before Moran got back up or his shoulder gave out.
"Well, it will be difficult since he's still upset with me—"
"Certainly."
“Grief?” Sherlock frowns. “Who died?”
He hears a sniff, but manages to half-heartedly tell himself it's just John's cold acting up.
“You’d better be right.” Sherlock answers as the knots come loose. Shrugging the rope off, he guides John into his arms and Mortimer stands, recognizing the moment, to greet Irene.
His voice sounded more broken than he wanted it to. Hoarse and cracked, a low whisper.
“Just as charming as I remember. Come, you must be hungry. Let us eat.”
"They were innocent."
"Hopefully...not at 3 am." She said tiredly.
He wanted more. He wanted to be somewhere else, his heart gripped in the fist of the Wanderlust, that curse that had cost his grandfather's life and now was his to bear.
"John…" Sherlock muttered. "
John paused a moment, then nodded.
The wolf looks up to him as he stands.
"Yes, tighten the leash, Lestrade. That always makes the dog stop whining." Morn taunts. "Hit him on the nose with a newspaper while you're at it. Lock him out before he puddles on the floor."
Mycroft’s face is tight, stoic. He speaks carefully.
Footnotes:
He leaned forward, weight on his bent arms, and let his hands graze the edges of John's face before he drew in and took one breath—in and out—staring at John before he kissed him. It was whole and kind, a welcome, feeling to both like coming into the warmth from the cold and they knew what it meant, what actions could say that words couldn't.
He moved away. His movements hadn't been subtle enough for Mikheia to not notice him switching his hospital band with another. He'd relied too heavily that Mikheia would be shocked that he was speaking to the man who shot him. But he couldn't know that he'd already done that, seven years ago, right before blood splattered on his face and he went home and made sure not to tell his mother the truth of how he got the thick, rounded wound in his side. He had gone to bed that night in the worst pain of his life, a pain in his chest that felt like his soul had been poisoned, and woke up with a raw throat, a burn in the soft skin of his hip, and tears on his face. His sister had glanced questioningly at him at breakfast but hadn't said anything until the early hours of the next morning, when she cried for him at his hospital bed because she thought the new hole in his chest was a bullet wound that she'd been afraid would come one day.
Harry’s curse is the last thing he hears.
is said once more before he feels a strong hand at his chest and he's pushed away to look at John.
His shoulder, save for his scar and the prick from the dart, was fine and whole. Clean. No blood. No wound. He had imagined it.
"I might've. But where's the fun in that?" He grinned, pulling the bandana back over his face. "I'd like to thank you, John. If you ever take a break from those godawful rigs to venture into town, do look me up."
“It has everything to do with Moran, please try not to be so stupid about obvious facts.”
“No. I do doubt my grip on reality though.”
Sherlock blinks as Mortimer’s voice calls out, moments after he’d last spoken.
"I thought that was admirable, what you did, however ill-advised."
,” John continued, “that we were in agreement.”
"And what might that entail?"
"Yes, tell her that would be most appreciated."
"Are you alright?" John asked softly.
There is also a torn piece of paper half a foot to the right with the inscription—most likely in blood—'Fire Walk With Me'. Immediately below is the word 'rache', R-A-C-H-E, carved into the floor."
Sherlock will have nothing left to give.
John stares at him and it is wrong. There is no John in it all.
“You—have you talked to him? Is he al—you’ve seen him?”
John smiled at him, and he hated it – it was not a true smile, but one saturated in sadness.
"This is the Colorado Lounge. This is where…well, where it happened."
“It won’t.”
“I told you I would.” John whispers, and then everything is wrong.
Fucking Mycroft. He was still in the room. Why? It had been a full ten point twelve seconds since he’d spoken last, surely he’d realised he was on a fool’s errand.
Sherlock sits beside their bed at the inn, watching over him. The water runs in the bathroom where Lestrade is washing off the blood and sticky blackness that Sherlock told him was ink.
"You know, you're the second person to tell me that today and the first couldn't keep their promise."
close to sending you back home. I'll do it too. One little snap and poof, you're back with your thoughts and that weird sex witch for company—"
John couldn’t help it – he laughed in his face, a dark, incredulous laugh at the absurdity of what he was hearing. “You’re telling me that after I left you, you seriously contemplated
John splayed a hand across his back as he pressed a kiss to his neck and then there was a wet, concentrated coldness that made Sherlock's skin prickle, but it wasn't uncomfortable. Just...new. He should have known John would have foreseen this, that a doctor would tend to bring the necessary materials involved in intimate situations that Sherlock hadn't even begun to consider and-
“A bit unavoidable, falling out of the sky and all,” she replies, smiling, before she realises what she’s said.
"Why?"
"I don't want you to think that you have to prove anything to me." John said gently.
“What if I haven’t written it yet?”
"I made cookies." He said happily, tossing the tray into the sink and taking off the apron. "But you call them biscuits, yes? You British are very odd; everything is mixed up when I am with you. I found the ingredients in the oddest place, in the back of the pantry, like someone was trying to hide them—"
The final chapter! An epilogue and sequel will soon follow.
The man nodded, took two strides across the small room and slung John roughly over his shoulder.
"You don't trust me with him."
The game was on.
“Was anyone attacked?” John asks, scanning the article.
"What, I can't fancy a vacation?"
Tentatively, he tried the nearest one. Broom closet. Safe.
"I told you." He sniffed, reaching for the bread. "It was an experiment."
Harry stopped calling first. Then Lestrade. Then Molly. Lovely Molly. So kind and nice, so undeserving of his cold brush-offs, of his half-hearted apologies. He knew Lestrade meant well, knew that Lestrade was just as confused and stunned by Sherlock's death as he was. But Lestrade had not cared for Sherlock like John did. Sherlock had been a commodity to him, just an asset really, not that vital factor that sent John's very blood rushing through his veins. Not the breath in his lungs. Not the pounding of his heart. Sherlock had only ever been that to John.
He lets his head rest against the back of the chair, tilted towards the ceiling. He hadn’t taken much, maybe one or two pills, and just enough to make his head float in choppy water.
Before he can come back to himself, he’s being lifted by an iron fist wrapped around his throat as Azazel shoves him against the wall. John brings up his knees and kangaroo kicks him in the chest, savouring the sound of shattering bone as his breastplate caves, the force sending him skidding across the pavement, kicking up chunks of asphalt and road.
"I could say the same." John groans out.
“Before I went to sleep last night, I thought about him. Well, I mean, that’s not
Missed Call from: John Watson
Sherlock stares through the windshield, speechless. He feels his heart kick in his chest as he unblinkingly unbuckles his seat belt. He steps tentatively out of the car, feeling as if the road beneath him was paved in petroleum.
"Well, Doctor Watson, what are you to do now? Kill me, hurt me if you must, but won't be getting revenge. Not really."
Their first wedding, in London. The second, in Oia – Apanomeria, as it was called then – a rather spontaneous decision after another reunion, John coming off the latest Cretan War and Sherlock traveling through Athens from Rome. He had a fond spot for that wedding in particular; they’d gotten drunk off the natives after a local wedding and had a spontaneous ceremony themselves on the cliffs, over-looking the soft blue sea, watching the night fisherman cast their nets into the water below. The third had been in Prague, 1773, the fourth in Venice, 1854, and the most recent had been in Algiers, 1963, coming out of the cumulative fog of the previous two decades of war and strife.
John glares wordlessly.
John woke to a blinding light, his own personal sun burning through his eyelids and blaring into his vision. As he came to, he realised it wasn't the sun hovering in their room, but the bedside light, the shade removed so it blared all the brighter. It was raining, the night outside the open window was wet and cool, a damp, easy breeze waving into the room.
Mikheia shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath.
“Well, I’ve had my hands full as I am dealing with an angel.”
“What is it always, darling,” Moriarty replied, taking his hat off and hanging it off the chair. “People. These little beasts.”
"You fell for me once." His eyes were so damn
he’s stripping in the kitchen?” Lestrade asks and he sounds to be on the verge of a breakdown.
"Tell me what's wrong."
"I suppose we'll have to cross that off the list when we get to it, then, won't we?"
His tone was biting, but not towards John. John knew he was edging on the sharp precipice of dangerous thoughts. He knew where that tone led; what the consequences where.
He hung up, took a deep breath, and turned down the corridor, breaking into a run.
"Alright, so I may need help sometimes if I can't reach."
“Yes, wonderful, now would you please
“No,” he shook his head. “it’s not.” He perched on the edge of their bed, looking up across the room at his mate, standing as still as stone, as if waiting for the other shoe to drop, the blade to fall; suddenly he hated himself, how he had acted, how he’d behaved. Sherlock’s recovery had not been easy, and it was not far in the distance behind them, yet he still acted as if it were possible these last years had been for nothing, as if one fight, one criticism, one misconstrued word might send his mate spiraling back down into the darkness that had consumed them in Norway.
"Is there anything else you want to surprise me with?"
Mycroft was silent, but they could both sense his distaste. “Harriet was always determined to have what she would.”
"You already told me."
John shuts his book, keeping the page with his thumb, and gives Sherlock a look as he raises his eyebrows.
And so John Watson returned to the world.
John feels a swift rush of relief, for Greg's arrival. For Sherlock. He should never know what it feels to know you're the reason someone's life has ended, even if they were the enemy. He wasn't even entirely sure Emma was worth it; wasn't even sure if she was truly the enemy.
! Do you hear the pipes, Danny? The pipes! They're calling you home!"
There was a knock at the door, sure and steady, and John knew who it was; there were only two people in the world with such a perfectly timed talent at interruption, and the second was on the other side of the world in Darjeeling negotiating on behalf of the East India Trading Company.
John opens tired eyes to an empty room and his fever-addled brain struggled to dredge itself out of sleep.
31 October
"Please tell me there's a bomb or a packet of anthrax in it or something so I know I was justified in risking my life for it."
"Sherlock, she has something to say to you. Things you should know. Will you listen?"
“Sometimes it’s what you can’t see that counts.”
“Was I with you?”
“I can’t stay with you forever, Sherlock.” He said softly, then amended himself at the sudden panicked expression on his husband’s face, realizing what it must’ve sounded like. “I mean, I can’t stay with you
"What did you talk about?"
“What?”
“I can ask the same of you. If I’d known my brethren have let themselves be leashed like a loyal little guard dog…” Azazel taunts with a sardonic grin. “I might have come sooner.”
"Well people think that, but really he's just as immature and frustrating and brilliant as he seems."
Georgiy’s home, a small cottage he and his late wife built with their own hands, is an idyllic pastoral, like it was pulled straight out of a Dostoevsky novel, comprised of just three rooms: a den and intermingling kitchen, and a bedroom. Thick exposed coarse wood beams trap the heat floating to the ceiling, while rough stone floors and inner walls add to the feeling John had the moment he’d first stepped in, namely that he’d been thrown back a century in time, although Georgiy’s access to running water assuaged it a bit. Combined with the rolling lush mountains in the distance and the semi-isolated close intimacy of farm life, in another life perhaps, would have suited John quite comfortably. If—
John is clutching his shoulder to his body, trying to keep it as still as he can. Sherlock did that too. His fault.
you. He protects you, tells you what you want to hear, answers all the thoughts you've got in that brainy head of yours. He consistently knows what you want, always. A little suspicious, don't you think?"
After my arm had healed up enough, I took a job in the oil fields, manning the derricks as they drew out black gold from the earth. And I suppose that was around the time I met Sherlock Holmes.
"For Mycroft, maybe."
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
Jim's eyes slide open and turn to him, filled with what Sherlock can only akin to glee.
Sherlock wakes at the ring of his phone. He reflexively reaches out to answer it and hoarsely calls out for John to make him tea before he realizes what he’s said.
"Are you ready?" He asks, standing, as he pats Gladstone's head.
“I don’t know.”
"He didn't even get to see it—"
"I never got to fly with you, did I? I know I promised."
No one was immortal, and no one could escape Death. Even Sherlock Holmes.
If you were smart, you started rowing early, before the rest of the competition woke. If you were smarter than that, you only had the obligatory wine with dinner, and not a drop more. Someone always needed to get somewhere, even before the sun was up. He loaded his oar into the waiting boat and climbed in, unmooring it from the docks.
"She was—"
"Pfft, humans. Think they know everything. You can't just get rid of me, Sherlock." Jim says with a smirk. "You can't just toss some magic water at me and
"You have a pack of supernatural wolves to do your bidding too. I don't know which suggests your nature more."
John trailed off into silence and Sherlock didn't press him.
“I’m here.” He says softly and Sherlock shakes his head against his palm. “You’re not alone. I’m here. I’m right here.”
His thumb traced Mikheia's name.
He’s broken from his thoughts as Gladstone pisses near his feet, the stream steaming in the air as it splashes on the balustrade and into the water. John’s molecules mingle with rose sweat and king’s tears and now Gladstone’s piss. The cycle continues, undeterred.
"Well, there have been many instances where I almost did both of those things." John smiled weakly before it faded back. "Do you know how close I was to shooting you that day at the church in Bruges because the agency told me to? And not even in your kneecaps. I knew where that bullet would go."
“But—you—John, you never talked to me, not once, how was I to know I hadn’t hurt you irrevocably in some way? Why didn’t you say anything?”
--//--
His hands are fidgeting, thumb running over the curve of his fingers. Why is he fidgeting? Who does he possibly have to fear here?
“Plenty of cases have been unsolved under my supervision.”
"Go on then, correct me you massive prat."
“Well, well, well. Billy Wiggins, come to play at last.”
He had a dream last night, which was normal, but he remembered it, which was odd. He never remembered his dreams, or maybe he didn’t care enough to. But this one. This one had been interesting. Most people might have said it was a premonition, but Sherlock never put much stock into that pseudo-analysis mysticism. Maybe he should now, considering his life had turned into some kind of supernatural menagerie in a handful of weeks; angels, werewolves (
"Surely he can't be all he's cocked up to be." She says with a smile.
Antipositional. Backwards pawn.
"John?"
“The simple but damning fact that you are a demon hunter.”
So, life resumes for the pair, but it's heavy with mud and dirt and sadness, something easily repairable but impossible to address. The solution is simple enough, when one side is stronger than the other it's a checkmate, but, in this case, when two sides are too frightened to move, it's simply a stalemate.
The door slammed shut.
"Well, in his travels, Mr. Holmes made the choice to go alone, but he also let the both of us join him. Maybe he needed our skills, or things he didn't have."
"Then what did you think? You never tell me anything, and I don't just mean with St. Bart's or the time you were away. I mean
!" John grinds out.
His 'contact', that traitorous fucker, had met him at Yaroslav's Court, as arranged, but his information had been faulty and vague. John should have realised it was a trap. He should have done many things, like break that bastard's neck before he could talk, or at the very least shoot his legs out from under him. It would only be the kind thing to do to repay him for whatever hell he was about to go through. Unfortunately, it hadn't gone that way. It had gone more the way of a choloroformed rag and weakening resistance.
John doesn't answer. He's not sure he wants to. Or whether Sherlock means the bed or the hotel or his life. He'd rather it be two of the three. He doesn't much like the hotel, it feels
He decides to test just how human John really is.
thing to do.
A journal?
It was an ambassador. Clearly the agency was testing how far his morals would stretch. But…it wasn't
"Jim wanted Sherlock to watch his heart burn to ash. I always gave Jim what he wanted."
Sherlock spun on his heel and looked John in the eye, holding out the letter for him to take as if it would burn him, waving it in John’s vicinity to claim it.
“Sergeant Donovan,” Jim says sweetly. “What brings you here, beautiful?”
"No," John begins, because it doesn't make sense. "No, it was only once, at the pool—"
The Englishman smiled. The guard let him pass, certain that he had been expected.
Nothing. John's bed is carefully made, as is typical of him, and a few stray feathers brush across the floor as he steps in. They are the only sign, the only piece of tangible evidence that John was ever here to begin with.
because look what he did to John, John's been shot, and he's underwater and that bullet could have caught him anywhere and he could be drowning. In his anger, and he will never quite understand why it only rears its head in matters pertaining to John and John's safety (although, yes, he really does understand why, but doesn't like to acknowledge it), he knocks the scrawny street git out cold with one simple long pinch to his subclavian artery and rushes to the water.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck and the younger man ducked his head to rest on his chest, next to the starburst scar, as cold water ran over them, feeling more like warmth now and less like ice. Of course John had surreptitiously turned the temperature up, but that was irrelevant.
"If you're going rogue, you know the rules already, I'm sure. No collateral damage or I get involved. No non-combatants or unauthorised assignments and I get involved. I don't know how much liberty you were given in Afghanistan, and I don't know how much you used it if you were, but you cannot breach civilian lines."
"Danny!
He turns to Sherlock and grabs his arm, steering him towards a waiting panda car as he climbs into the driver’s side, turning the lights on. Sherlock barely has time to buckle himself in before Greg stamps on the pedal and swerves into the street.
“Evening.” Sherlock says to the man sitting perfectly calm, as if he was waiting for a check-up.
"Wrong about what?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d known John’s life would have been boring without him, but this reaction was…extreme. Alarming, even. John was a creature of habit—personal hygiene was routine. This man before him was going against the grain.
"Hello?"
But there was so much that he hadn't said.
So he pretended it was Sherlock, pacing about like a mother hen and worrying over his recovery. He chuckled. Now maybe he could sleep, if Sherlock was here. If Sherlock. Sherlock.
“You lot really don’t trust your government, do you?”
He reaches down and rights the upended duvet corner before straightening up.
That deep-sworn vow have been friends of mine;
Silence. Then,
Sherlock's eyes narrow into a feral glare.
"Don't…don't do that again—you can't just—just—"
This is why, when Sherlock climbs into the idling towncar—a rare occasion, as he himself called for it instead of Mycroft—and Mycroft can feel the wordless cold anger radiating off of his brother, he knows the precise gravity of his error.
“I’ll be fine.” He smiled. “Thank you for your trouble.”
"The desert." He answers solemnly. In the dim light, quietly hidden in the shadows of their booth, the blackness in his veins is muted, less noticeable.
“Or a blank journal,” Mycroft continues, drawing something from his jacket. “Waiting to be written in.”
“Stop it, John.”
“Your friends are interesting.” Quinn says with a sardonic grin. “An angel and a policeman. Quite the crowd.”
Ishido Shino, mole and next door neighbour, smiles. Yakuza members, after transgressions, are to give the tip of their little finger to their boss, as a sign of repentance and loyalty. Ishido, in his younger days, had overcompensated before his semi-retirement from the gang at the ripe old age of 29. Now, he was benched to the more promising realm of computer hacking and payroll, a business that went hand in hand. Sherlock had the fortune of discreetly persuading him towards his side before Kita Seung Eun had recruited him with that plastic cup of sake and the fake tattoo. A job promised in London through batting lashes was all it took.
This is his child. Our baby. He should know. He’s getting divorced, he’s moving out so we can be together, he needs me, he needs this. Tell him.
“Yes.”
Mycroft withdraws the key, careful to wipe it on a handkerchief he pulls from his pocket before handing it to his brother.
“Nachash didn’t, Azazel did. There’s a difference.”
"Never better." He says without turning around, hands dropping to his sides. "Why?"
He nodded, but made no move to stand. He didn’t think he could.
“She drank him.”
“In all of humanity, few people have caught my eye. Three, to be exact. The other two…they were a lot like you. Very special to me, very…human. I watched over them, made their lives a little better if I could manage it, but—” He pauses, retreating farther into the shadows of his memories. “In the end, I left them. I thought they’d be better off without me. I—well, as long as I’m being honest the…the loneliness of it all got to me. I felt like a voyeur, always watching but knowing they’d never know my name or what I’ve done for them. I didn’t mind though, mostly. I loved them.”
"Did you know that you are not always right, Sherlock?" Mikheia asked and Sherlock paused. Mikheia had never called him by his name, always 'sir' or 'Mr. Holmes', always something formal, never this personal. Something had changed now.
“No, I mean it. I don’t know where he went.” She shakes her head, her eyes prickling with tears. “He left me there. Don’t you think if I knew where he’d gone, I’d have gone with him?”
.” John said to the man sitting on the plush divan across from him. Snow was falling gently against the night outside the insulated windows, blanketing the courtyards and carried onwards by the dark waters of the Moyka.
Mortimer laughs. “Would you like to meet her?”
Quinn stills. “Lucky guess.” He says with a shrug. “Father may have mentioned it once.”
“Well that’s stalemate, isn’t it, darling? I’m afraid I’m a little famished.” He stood and Sherlock followed suite. “Late for dinner, you know. Until next time, Sherlock Holmes,” the man said, tipping his hat at him before turning away and walking back through the park.
this anymore. Times have changed.”
“Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling in at night. I miss you like hell.”
. Sherlock didn't come across many that enjoyed it and fewer that wanted to stay with him in part because of it.
The door opens up to a blindingly white foyer bedecked with gold and black décor, every surface immaculate and spotless and so alien for Sherlock, who is used to ugly chairs and tacky wallpaper and mismatched stacks of war novels and science journals and boxes of slides littering every open space.
This is a terrible moment for all of us. For all of us who knew her—her friends, her family…it is very important that we all try to help each other through this difficult time.
The atmosphere at the tables grinds to a sudden halt and Sherlock and John look at each other.
He looks up, past the dirtied fountain, towards the water. It’s shining in the light, hammered smooth and crenellated with dimples from the veiled sun. Past the bright surface he can see the water, murky, the darkness thickening and coagulating despite the time of day.
"And what is it that you do, Mr Holmes?"
Sherlock felt a cold smile come upon him.
A proclivity for luxury seemed to be Mycroft's Achilles' heel.
"Yes, well, we can't all pine for the lost days of our youthful sexual awakenings."
He hides the slip of paper in his palm, and tugs his gloves on.
There’s rustled movement, followed by a set of feet appearing as Moran searches for even footing on the ladder before he begins his descent, rifle slung over his shoulder, as he mutters garbled curses and condemnations. John keeps his gun trained on him as he climbs down.
"Rather on the nose," He agreed, taking his mask in hand. John reached out to straighten it on his face, then did something he’d forgotten to expect long ago—he placed his gloved hands on either side of Sherlock’s face, and kissed him deeply.
"Did you always know how to do that," Sherlock's voice came calmly through the steam and empty whirring of the rusted machines. "Or did your employer teach you?"
"I'm not the one who just spat Death in the face, John."
But still it nagged at him. Something deep inside tells him the TV hadn't been on when he'd returned with breakfast.
*   *   *
He turned away.
"If you die for me, John Watson, I will
John said nothing. Blood trickled down from a cut above his face into his mouth as he gasped like a fish out of water. There were tears on his face, mingling with all the red. Diluting it.
of it all. It will drive him mad one day, or maybe it already has. To know he had this wonderful, special thing, and now he’s lost it, it was his fault, he can’t be angry with anything because it was
The house they finally stop at is indistinguishable from the rest of the block: skinny, teetering upwards as tall as its rudimentary stone structure will support, with a chipping red door facing the cobblestoned street.
"You?" John teased. "Never."
"No shit." John chuckled. "Have you seen my trousers anywhere?"
The man chuckles and John can feel him retreat to some farther space away from him as he stands. “I don’t have to lay a hand on you to break you, Captain Watson. Come now: I can show you.”
“Crêpes.”
Seeing her now, this was crushing her. This
Thought I'd end my hiatus with a little treat for you guys.
Night in Texas is a special creature. Very different from Iowa, or anywhere else. It's big, and empty. Full of something that you don't really want to put a name to unless you're in it. The rattlers slink down to their holes. The mice come out, ears twitching for the swoosh of predators as they scurry beneath the owls, perched on cacti, waiting. Out in the hills sometimes you can hear men hunting in the scrub for wild hogs, sometimes you can hear them hunting for each other, spoiling to take what someone else's got, gainfully or no. Oil speculators and surveyors sneak out in the dead of night, trying to get a jumpstart on competition as the derricks clink and clank in and out of the earth like birds sipping for water, manned by skeleton crews to keep the black gold flowing by sun or moon.
“English? Yes.” He hangs up the clipboard in his hands and turns back to the men. “What can I do for you?”
“I mean originally. That word you used,
"I will never leave you again. I'll never premeditate it if I do."
"What are you playing at John?" Sherlock moved his hands to frame John's face, brushing a bloodied lock of hair out of his eyes. "You think I value your life so worthlessly that I'd let you throw away? And to
"Let me go with you." He says softly, touching the side of John's face; John shuts his eyes. "I can help you...we're better together than apart, as I'm sure you've realized."
“Oh my god.” Lestrade mutters before turning to Sherlock. “Did you drug my coffee?”
“You weren’t weak that night. You weren’t dying when you drove out there, parked the car, put the hood up. What’d you do, gun the gas pedal until it overheated?”
He let his hands tighten around John.
She looked up to ask him what it said, but found herself instead staring into the barrel of a gun.
"I am continuing his work." Moran says, but it sounds to the rest of the room more persuasive than convinced. It sounds like something drilled into him so deep that he knows nothing else.
"In the station at Novgorod." Mary answered, concern passing over her face. "Is there something wrong?"
John thinks Moriarty's dead. John doesn't believe in him, not like he once said he did when he thought Sherlock was dead. Doesn't believe, not really; he think this is a wild goose chase. He thinks Sherlock is a fool for coming here. But he's too kind, too fucking
If looks could kill, Irene would be dead twice over, but she paid their glares no mind as she led them through the damp tunnels.
after all, his partner, his best friend, the man he loves with every cell in his body, but he’d be lying to himself if what had happened hadn’t unsettled him.  He’d be lying if he thought he was completely safe, if he didn’t expect Sherlock to attack him again. He’d be on his guard, or at least as best as he could in his condition.
?” Harry asked, flipping through records in her nightgown. Her fangs had just begun to ascend, poking through her lip after her morning meal.
Mikheia smiles and nods politely. “You are most welcome, sir.”
“Good. I do not wish to undermine your professional expertise, but I wished to be certain we are beginning on the right foot, as they say.”
A chair creaks. The lights change to a bright jaundiced yellow.
“Quinn?”
"John?"
"There is a difference between waiting and taking caution, Sherlock. We didn't know where he was or what they were doing until we managed to extract his location and raid the place. You wouldn't have liked what I saw. I didn't like what I saw, to be quite honest."
“Yes.”
“What is it? What can I do to–to—” To what?
"You're wrong."
are you—”
Great.
“But…the garage, it was a supernova,
The voice laughed, full and loud. “Oh, I
, Jim, don't you dare—leave him—" Jim turns his head to him and John suddenly stops, as if the words have lodged in his throat.
He trails off as they stop in the lobby, the white snow glaring at them behind steamed glass. Mycroft hands him Cila’s note from his pocket and he can feel the thin paper through his gloves and see that the edges are frayed, as if this has been torn off of something larger. A receipt?
"Oh, more dirty talk." John said, smiling. "You know just what to say to a guy."
He stops suddenly and John raises his head.
A woman’s talking; she clearly wants to be taken seriously in that pantsuit. Better listen. She’s having an affair with one of the cameramen. How pedantic.
Sherlock?"
“See, that’s what I thought, when you left. When I was alone. I thought I’d never get past the emptiness of not having you in my life. Turns out, a few bullets solved that problem nicely.”
Hot water dripped down his hair, trickling over his face.
Sherlock smiled. In the darkness and light of the oil lamp his eyes the color of the silver glint on a weathervane before a storm. "Yes, you do."
He brought the last handful of blood between them, allowing John to have his fill, expecting him to finish it off entirely; his wounds were worse, he required more. John drank some, then covered Sherlock’s hand with his own, pushing it back towards him.
Sherlock knew how to apologise. Everyone
Almost.
Harry glared at him, and John squeezed his knee lightly.
Harry shuts the door and comes to stand beside him, Sherlock’s arms crossed tightly beneath his chest.
The wood had all been cleared from the wound – he was certain, and thorough in his inspection, and would not leave the fate of his brother’s mate down to a careless operation. He probed at the softening smoke-like veil that surrounded John – not his soul, but an imitation of it, a shadow of his past humanity – as he searched for something amiss, the thing that was slowly poisoning him, stopping his body from healing and his mind from waking.
They’d met outside of London during a celebration for the King. John had been at court then, a minor player with nothing to do with himself, and Sherlock had just come out of the Low Country, rather aimless after siphoning off the blood of the Sack of The Hague. It had been simpler then: one could just disappear and everyone’s mind went to the Inquisition. Though he and his kind were no saints, humanity’s greatest enemy had always been itself.
"You can try." He says lowly, and Nachash laughs.
Slowly, their laughter died down and they sat in silence as the wind blew the sand past the moon, low in the sky.
"Good to see you again, Sherlock." Mycroft said in that infuriatingly calm voice, as if he had done no wrong and didn't plan to.
. If it's not in space, then is it a planet? Are you extra-terrestrial?"
He was falling in the feeling of love, hot and smooth, weathered but showing no signs of wear. He could feel the press of Sherlock’s loneliness, all of his solitary nights, his desire for a companion clutched so tightly to his chest it left a negative imprint; the weight of it when it lifted that first time, under the willows on the banks of the Thames, the two of them racing against the sun after a bloody and fortunate hunt.
“He’s mentioned you before.”
Mycroft shuffles on his feet, warily eyeing his brother.
She thinks she might rip then napkin she’s tearing it so hard.
“Does this have anything to do with Moran?”
"The archives. Can you get me in?"
Sherlock stares into Moran’s unblinking gaze, both half-lidded with lack of sleep, yet forcing themselves to continue on out of spite for the other.
"It's a two way street, Sherlock." John says softly with a tender smile.
Sherlock stared at the sleeping couple. "They'll be dead and carted off to their graves like the rest come morning."
“Give me the usual, then.”
"He is
He shrugs, and John sighs, rubbing at his temples. “Well, the point is that I started to look at the corresponding news stories of the places I’d thought you were likely to be in. Places where Moriarty might have thought it was important to have people there.”
Sherlock glances at him for a moment then nods. “I found a note at the crime scene, written in what I suspect is blood.” He rifles through the box beside him, producing a small clear bag and handing it to John, who reads the scrawl with a feeling akin to going up the stairs in the dark and suddenly hearing an unexpected noise behind you. What began as irritancy at some high school prank hardened into an icy shrapnel of fear, something he’d not felt since that bloody day in the desert.
Sherlock trails off, finding himself unable to keep talking. It's a cocktail of shame and embarrassment and grief and guilt, all mixing together into a highly-flammable combustion that rises up to the heat of his burning heart. It's going to explode soon, and he doesn't know what he'll do, who he may hurt, whose death he might be responsible for.
“Look.” He says, nodding as he leans forward to put his cup down.
“No.”
"You are right, though. I'm not an angel. We used to be called Nephilim." John says, leaving Sherlock's pseudo-accusation unacknowledged. "Sons of fallen angels and children of mortal women. By-products of not-quite-holy unions that began when lesser angels were sent to Earth to teach humans the truths of your world, although no one seemed to take into account just how beautiful human beings are, how warm and…" John swallows. "Alluring. The women called to them like water on a hot day, and their offspring suffered for it. Those born from the unions were known for their great strength and greater cruelty."
“Poison is a woman’s weapon.” The Grand Duke scoffed. “Let’s just stab him and be done with it.”
He swallows the urge to collapse like a body without a skeleton.
It felt like it was raining, raining all the time, even when he could feel the sun shining. One collectively large, incredibly dark cloud leaving a shadow over him everywhere he went. It was maddening, because he knew exactly what was wrong with him, but he couldn't do one single thing to cure it. Sherlock Holmes always wondered what it meant to die, but every time he woke up in a foreign world that wasn't anywhere near Baker Street or even London for that matter, every time he woke up and was reminded that John was not there, he knew he didn't have to wonder, because he knew what dying felt like. How odd it was, that his "death" was painless, yet being alive hurt so much more.
"Mycroft told me." Lestrade shrugs.
“Wonderful. Most felonies are committed around two.”
"What's this?" John asked, eyebrow raised.
Both paths were equally likely, but the idea of dropping into an enclosed space, of such limited proximity to something dangerous, made him wary. Kneeling, he examined the stone, sniffing at the outer edges until he spotted it, faintly, but nevertheless there: the smell of blood, imprinted in a crescent shape, the curve of a palm.
"Yes, genius, I know what that does.
permission from his superiors. So...that was it, then? Affection and perfidy was all he was allowed to use for his own freedom to do what he wanted?
…” With an incriminating hand, the servant gestured to his face, drawing a tear down his cheek.
There was a bang. Gun shot. Not curious. Worrisome.
"Orso," Irene's voice called from the darkness, "
Pure conjecture on his part.
"I know Sherlock. Go to sleep."
"I killed a kid once." The man admitted through clenched teeth. His whole body had broken into a cold sweat as he shook.
"Should I be rethinking my conclusions on your death fetish?" John asked, his voice teasing but with a black current underneath. Sherlock waited for him to answer and he sighed. "It didn't feel like anything, I suppose, when you get down to it. Whenever I have my finger on the trigger, I let whatever part of me that I can manage split apart and duck behind whatever shrapnel cover it can find. Then I went back and salvaged it later, trying to put everything back like I found it when I was alone. Or if Mary was there."
"I want to drag Sherlock back to Baker Street kicking and screaming if I have to, and I want to live the rest of my life in relative peace." John paused. "With him, I suppose." He added with a smile.
“Not now.” Sherlock barks, trying the next key. “I have to know. I have to know if I have to bury you or not, I have to—”
They’d better find John soon. Sherlock was already starting to crumble, if this morning’s breakdown was any indication, and John had been listed as a missing person for barely 24 hours. As much as he’d like to revel in his denial, as much as he’d like nothing more than to convince himself that Sherlock could solve this, after 48 hours hope would start to dwindle. He knew it was an inevitability, he’d spent too many work on too many cases that ended badly, and he knew that Sherlock was well aware of the fact that, if John was gone much longer, they might not find him at all. It was hard to be an optimist when your job made you stare into the face of reality from the moment you woke up—his phone ringing at two a.m. that called him out to a crime scene had long ago stopped being unexpected—and the moment you went to sleep—or collapsed, rather, to savour those few blessed hours of rest before the cycle began again.
The Antlers - Revisited
"Then I hope you've eaten your fill. Time's wasting."
"What? No." John shook his head, his breathing heavy from exertion. "No, I lost him in the hallways. He must have ducked into an empty room or something, waited for me to pass before coming back out."
All his fault.
The men fell into a contemplative silence, rolling the idea in full around, searching for flaws in the immediate plan.
He stood, walking up to his husband, who had started to shake from the cold coming off the bay, from the sweet smell of burnt flowers it brought with it. John shut the balcony doors and turned, the two nearly chest to chest. Absentmindedly, out of habit, he straightened the collar of Sherlock’s dressing gown, smoothing the wrinkled worn silk.
"You just said it wasn't a fetish."
"Rachel?" John asks, bemused. "You're saying Rachel Wilson was a drug abuser? I don't believe it."
There's a high pitched screech, like car brakes, like a child crying, like something falling through the air at a high velocity.
Mikheia had dragged him to the nearest Orthodox church that morning to receive communion, but they had arrived late, so now he was meeting with the priest to get it. Why a little piece of bread and watered down wine was important to his everlasting soul, Sherlock didn't know or care, but it made Mikheia less anxious and jittery, so he went along with it. And Mikheia agreed to take him to the Russian consulate to find his next contact, so Sherlock supposed that this was his way of thanking him.
If John didn't know precisely why Mikheia was lying in that bed, he'd have thought nothing serious had happened to him. Like he hadn't had his shoulder punched through or nearly bled out last night.
"Clever, John, but I was referring to sulphuric acid."
"Usually I find that our kind goes first." Moran said casually. "Those who like the thrill of fire always end up being consumed by it."
John paused, a grin creeping onto his face before he batted it aside. How exactly Sherlock deduced these things, he'd never know, but it was incredible all the same. He'd never get tired of it.
She walks by two men, speaking quietly in English. One of them looks to her as she passes. She might say he’s handsome, even beautiful, if it wasn’t for the gaunt face and skeleton body. He looks like Death, living. He is Atlas, crushed. He frightens her, the way he stares at her, at everything and nothing. She wonders who he’s lost, who meant so much to him that make the emptiness she sees in his eyes seem so heavy.
Sherlock stilled, his eyes sweeping the still, manicured garden.
He nodded.
There are many ways he can treat John in this instant, but he knows above all else that he can't treat John like a piece of glass. For one thing, John is a human being, not glass, and for the other, to connote that John is anything as breakable and fragile as glass would be insulting. John is quietly strong, quietly noble and he is quietly flawed, like everyone, but he is beautiful because of it.
, rather.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft says solemnly, and it’s all Sherlock needs to hear.
Mycroft was, unsurprisingly, expecting him.
"Yeah, well, neither seemed much help to you back there. And how is hanging yourself good for business?"
“You’ve reached Sebastian Moran, Sherlock Holmes speaking.”
“You have to promise me, Sherlock. This can’t happen again.”
Mycroft was going to refute the government’s long-denied stance on torture and he was here specifically to witness it.
They'd gotten to Sarajevo just fine, in a comfortable yet slightly wound tension. Both were too uncertain of how to proceed although they knew and anticipated what it would lead to. It couldn't be said, however, that they hadn't
John, the soldier laid bare, awed by an exotic setting and terrified by its brutality.
--//--
John didn’t answer. Sherlock glanced up at him: his head rested against the counter, mouth slightly open, the ends of his fangs just pointing through. His eyes were closed.
I stare at the kitchen wall. John turns on the television. News. Boring. Comes through the cracks of my cellar. It’s cold out here; my skin pimples with gooseflesh. I taste salt on my lips. The homicide was the fault of the brother, not the current suspect, just listen to him. I could say it out loud and John would look at me and smile and say
, Sherlock Holmes."
"Did you file the request?" He asked calmly.
Mycroft responds by turning on the telly, which has already been tuned to a news station. Sherlock suspects Mycroft has already perused the channels to censor them for his brother if he could. He doesn’t feel right. It’s not so much the headache as it is the lack of John in the room. Where is he? What aren’t they telling him?
“I know.”
and I’m alone with a wet shirt and wounded pride. He reappears shortly and shoves a tea towel into my hands before sitting next to me on the floor. “I should get you a kid’s cup next time. You’ll spill less.”
"Anderson."
“Well it was real for me, so great fucking trick there, one for the books I reckon. I’m going to bed.”
“I thought you’d think I was crazy. People hide things from each other when they fear the consequences, like when Mycroft hid the fact that you broke your mum’s vase when you tried to test the velocity of your marbles and taws.”
John smiles ruefully at the sound of his name. Tomorrow, if they make it there, he can say that it was the wine, if he wanted the easy way out.
“But that’s just it, Sherlock. You
“You’re going away from me, Captain Watson. I need you to come back.”
, is it?”
"Sherlock, we've been over this already…"
Footsteps circle around him. He feels his shoes become unlaced before they’re taken off.
Sherlock's musings were cut off with the screech of brakes as a dark SUV sped its way to them and skidded to a loud halt.
So Moran had Mikheia, or at least some form of leverage over him. That was bad, very bad.
Sherlock stares at where his hand rests, moving it on his own volition over John’s sternum, thumb brushing against the raised lift of his pectorals. His other hand rubs unthinkingly at his own chest, over a healing jagged scar near his heart.
He tilts his head towards John as he steps into the kitchen, shutting his phone with a sigh.
John does not respond, but his warm hands, calmly stilled over Sherlock's lean sides, make him continue.
“You’re an addict, Sherlock.” He said plainly, looking up at him, his face illuminated by the oil lamp on the table. “People don’t become one by being happy or content with how their lives are going. There is something within you that you need to address, and it all depends on if you want to. It will be hard – it might be the hardest thing you ever do –  but if you do it, if you agree to work on this, then I will be there with you. Not because I feel guilty or because you need looking after, but because I love you and I want to see you happy. It won’t happen overnight, but one day you’ll come out of it better than you were before, and you won’t find your existence so burdensome.”
“Molly can have her own friends,” Billy retorts. “She and Rachel didn’t have to share everything.”
fix my gimpy arm then and we’ll have one less problem to deal with?”
“Answer that for me, love, would you?”
say that again. You are worth a great many things to me John Watson."
“Are you alright?”
, Sherlock, you died and left me to a life where I was something less than what I was before. Do you know what that’s like, losing so much that you fall right past what you thought rock bottom was? Knowing you have
"John, you'll be alright. Do you hear me? John?
“You are too damn
“Imposing?” Mikheia repeats with a frown.
“Why did John contact you?”
"Quoth the raven…" He mutters, stepping around her to view this master stroke in a better light.
Sherlock’s own grin falls into cold stillness.
Sodium metal is, in fact, extremely flammable when placed into water. One small piece the size of a pebble can cause a well-sized fire in seconds.
"People say that too. You know, you don't have to call me that. I'm not Sherlock. I'm not your boss."
"Alright." John said, mildly confused, before returning to his plate. "Why, exactly?"
“She didn’t write that note, did she? You did. You wrote it the moment you were alone. That's why you were in here so long. You didn't want to seem as insignificant as her real note made you feel.”
Lestrade frowns. “Just because you find me incompetent doesn’t mean she does.”
John managed to turn himself over onto his back, the sheets sticking to the trails of thin saliva Sherlock had left.
, and this is the worst state he can be in, this state of not knowing—
He flashes the cross-and-brackets daimon inked onto his wrist, set amid the coils of a dragon slithering out of a skull—impermanent, but no one needs to know, so long as it looks convincing—and he understands that this life is degrading, as surely as the ink will fade from his skin. The shelf life of all the lives he’s occupied is never long; he uses them until his purposes are met. Kita knows this, and so does he, which is why she will keep him on life support until she is done with him.
“Yes-well, no, dammit—it’s all-encompassing, and elastic, like a membrane…like skin almost, but thinner, with lots of resistance. Like the feeling of a strand of hair, lots of give.”
“How much did she take?”
London is colder this time of year.
“Why did Nachash take him away?”
Ray: You, father.
“Yes, he’s still mad. Truth be told, I’m not too pleased either.”
He snaps his head up to tell them to
“Someone started a forum after you—after your fall. I didn’t read much of it at first until it started popping up more and more. People other than myself believed in you, believed that you were still out there, and I didn’t want to keep fooling myself. I’d seen the blood and…felt your wrist.” John swallows roughly, taking a sip of tea to mask it. “But one day I found myself browsing it, and when I checked the time it’d been three hours since I started. Then I went back the next day, and the next. People kept saying they’d seen you out on the street or in a coffee shop or playing third seat cello in the London Philharmonic—”
Sherlock stares at him, sees him, and he has nothing to say, no argument to make. John's words always make him feel naked, like he's been stripped bare, right down to the bones and sinew, and put under a lens.
They spent the drive home in silence, John picking grass and dirt out of his hair from their impromptu romp in the moonlight. When they got back to the cabin, it was nearly dawn, the dormancy of the night broken by the sound of birds. As he got out of the car, Sherlock froze, holding a hand up to John before he could shut the door.
“After?”
"What did you think the reality would be?"
Oh yes, he'd be having a talk with Mycroft about the numerous disadvantages of his estate.
In Moscow, he must watch a man he knows to be innocent garrotted in front of him. He knows he can do nothing, he knows that, ultimately, this man will die for a misunderstanding, that he will die for nothing. It’s a feeling he can’t name, watching the demise of someone who means nothing.
“Ignorance does not become you. You understood the rules.”
“You ever think of buying larger shirts?” She asks, eyeing the straining buttons.
Sherlock's eyes snap open. Seeing as John was in the room, it was safe to assume it was Lestrade.
Sherlock takes a step. His death won’t stop him. That’s isn’t Nachash. He’s sure of it. It’s too easy, but it's
That was something Sherlock would do.
They're making love because they can call it that now, a name it deserves, but it is angry; John can tell from the strain in Sherlock's arm where he clutches the headboard. He doesn't know why, but he's too involved to care, too suspended in the heavy warmth of it all. He grasps at Sherlock's sides, nails biting into soft skin, and Sherlock turns hard above him, muscles going rigid as he comes, glaring at the wall above John's head.
Sherlock shook his head slightly.
He forced himself back into his seat, turning away and hiding his mouth, willing his teeth to behave. He was stronger than…well, himself. But it wasn’t
His voice was different than John remembered, and that scared him. He didn't want it to be different. He wanted it to be as he remembered, smooth and dark like scotch. If his voice was different, that meant John was forgetting him. He didn't want to forget. He hadn't refused the agency's offer to just
, is what he wants to say.
“I get it, then.” He says softly. “I get it. You have to do this. I’m the last wrung of the ladder to get you out of the pit.”
They were quiet for a moment, a few seconds of running water that sluiced away blood and dirt and dried sweat and things they didn't know how to say.
“Sherlock said you study angels for a living. I could smite you right here, so stop being such a tosser and you’ll not be a pile of ash by the end of the day.”
Sherlock stops as they exit to the street and stares solemnly down at her.
into our flat! Did you give them your keys too?" John shuts his eyes. "You don't get to decide these things on your own anymore."
his brother regards so highly—sitting perched on a hand-me-down chair Mycroft gave to Sherlock as a house warming present (Sherlock at the time did not consider 221B to be either a home nor warm). As soon as his brother curtly answered his routine check-up calls with the statement that he had a handler, that his name was John and that he was an angel, Mycroft assumed Sherlock had finally taken one gram of cocaine too much and promptly quit his work in the middle of the day to hasten to his flat.
. Haven’t you heard anything I’ve been saying? You’re a man, not a rock.”
"John?" He asked, nudging him awake.
!" Harry breathes, straightening out of her paralysis and gesturing at the gate.
There. He can't take it back.
"Nn—I don't have a heart. I just—just have a soul. But whatever it is, whatever I have…it's yours. It's yours, Sherlock."
“Werewolf?” John shoots him a querying glance. “That’s the monster made from man, right? Covered in fur?”
“A poetic end, surely.”
Sherlock said nothing, taking a shallow, shaking inhale as he pulled John to him, resting his forehead on John's.
idea to bring him here?”
There was the sound of movement, as if Mycroft had straightened up in his chair.
“Would it help if I told you I had a good reason?”
The crowd milled in the halls as the concert let out at intermission, pockets of people chatting, discussing, debating, their voices filling the high, vaulted ceilings.
died, you fucking arrogant pisspot!”
“No…no…
“Let him go.”
"Too late." John groaned, feeling the damp warmth from the boy's hands pass onto his skin. Shadows began to stretch around him. Mikheia's silhouette began to expand as he opened his mouth to talk.
As they fall, his wings burst out in reflex, (to do what they are there for and
"I'll promise you whatever I damn well please. When we're old and grey and I'm about to go, I'll blindfold you and you can't take it off until the funeral's over and done with. So there, you will never see me dead again."
he recovered—
“‘Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.’” He noted, lip curling as they meandered through the fray.
"I: And you said you felt a little guilt, but the chorus is, “I should live in salt for leaving you behind”.
“I’m right. I know I’m right.
He's not disconnected.
Equally unsavoury, but the prospect of John’s presence back in his life is sorely tempting. The prospect of injury to John’s person is not. The chance of his abduction, torture, or death is high. The risks rival the reward.
There are great slabs of the day where everything is utterly silent and still. Sherlock will settle into the chair opposite of where John sits in the bed, awake but unmoving. The light will break over the horizon in the morning and move unbroken across him before the shadows begin to climb his face in the evening. He never blinks. Sherlock will get up, make tea, get a book, check his email, do
He opened his eyes, and willed himself to look at the moon. It wouldn’t do if he’d made Sherlock wait all this time for nothing. Soon, they would be together. It was just a matter of patience.
“Sorry?”
“I had so many chances to kill you, Watson!” He hears Moran call into the thick smoke and fire. “Make no mistake, this is the last!”
“How about Gladstone?”
"Well I hope you've had your fun."
John raises an eyebrow. "Well, if you
"Alright, Holmes," He says, placating yet stern, "but you need to let me in on whatever the hell is going on here."
Sherlock paused for a moment, eyes narrowing in the dark among the candlelight. In the distance, the sound of clinking silver, glass, laughing.
room. It makes him want to puff his chest out in pride and declare to everyone that John loves him and he loves John and nothing will ever get in their way again. He could kiss him, taste him, hold him, and love him unmitigated.
"God help me if I have to live without you again."
Sherlock's head raises. "What kind?"
Pain. He remembers a lot of pain later, when he remembers anything about that night. A face swims before him, lurking in the muddy water that’s gotten in his eyes and his lungs.
"No," John answered curtly, "I came here to warn you."
“You have a sister?”
John stands in the doorway, slack jawed. Sherlock can't blame him. Emma isn't present, which is a relief. John said he felt bad enough breaking off their date to bring her back, and rightly so as no woman would want to come home with him and see this.
John responds instantly, as if in reflex.
“I’m sure.” He says, thumb passing over the inside of John’s wrist, where a raised pink scar rests.
“You needing someone who knowing Serbian, or Russian maybes.”
"Be quiet."
That shadow made his heart pound harder than it had in three years. Something to marvel at, since he had gone through training to ensure that it wouldn't be so out of control, at least not while he was working.
"I can string you back up if you got any more bullets you want to waste."
Sebastian Moran.
"I'd never be so depraved." Sherlock teases, kissing at John's hairline.
He hears footsteps and Sherlock comes into the living room, caught in the middle of brushing his teeth.
John smiles softly, running a hand over the one that rests over his heart.
He swung out to the right, pivoting at the waist and slicing the knife through Billy’s ankle, severing the tendon. The vampire cried out, wobbling on his remaining good leg, and threw Sherlock away and into the side of the house.
John looks over his shoulder.
"I suspect that, yes. It's extremely corrosive—the knowledge of which you've just demonstrated by inquiring about the safety of our cabinets—which would correlate with the deep burn that appeared in her palm."
"You've never been a sidekick, John." Sherlock said, his silvered eyes meeting John's. "You've been a friend,
scary. Monster, terrifying, grrr, all that. Even Gladstone looks like a teddy bear next to you. The rest of us are scary because of what we are.
“Don’t call me that.” John spat, wiping at his mouth. “What the hell did you do?”
“Yeah, he’s the redheaded stepchild.” John grins and Sherlock finds it hard not to respond with his own.
“I thought I did.” He said evenly, and John had never seen this Sherlock before, so cold to the world, cold to his mate, swept into the dark tide of his own feelings. John had an image of them on the grass at Dartmoor, the look in his eyes, the moon banished from the night, and John knew what Sherlock’s worst fear in life was when he had said
He pulled the trigger again. Twice. Three times.
Soundlessly, he flings the sheets away from him and tucks them under John's body to keep the warmth in before he quietly opens the door to his bathroom.
Sherlock suddenly realizes that it’s not raining. The sky is clear, for the first time since John arrived.
A small light hums on right above him and he blinks against the audacity of its brightness.
“Alright.” He answers. “Alright.”
“I’m surprised Mycroft hasn’t already told you. Knowing him, he’s already installed cameras on the roof. Has he rigged the treeline yet or has he not been able to actually get himself into the tree?”
"He doesn't have much time left," John said in a rush as Sherlock collapsed beside him, hovering on his knees over the writhing man. "If we hurry we can
—I'm not that depraved John—it's more a morbid fascination."
He stills and squints through the dust and debris, holding up a hand to block the heavy light.
The professor’s accent was odd as well; his German was excellent, but certainly not native. It was more difficult to tell with his friend – he hardly said a word, other than to order his coffee or quietly respond to the other man.
Pain began to course through his body, as if his mind had been trying to ward it off until the last possible moment. A soft pain, an ache of reopened wounds, yet he couldn't feel any blood sticking his shirt to his skin. His bullet wound felt red-hot. His lungs burned like he was holding his breath underwater.
"By anyone I'd know?"
“I trust myself and my abilities to get out of a tight spot. This isn’t exactly our first time dipping our toes in a revolutionary environment. Remember France?”
He groans. His head feels as if its clamped in a vice. Something within him is still submerged, just below the surface, but not altogether unaware.
Sherlock's hands come up to grip John's wrists.
Sherlock stops mid-step and turns to his friend, standing there in the falling snow and streetlights. He looks unsure of himself, there in the cold, and it makes him look small.
"Yes, yes, I know. I ordered it to be left there." Sherlock said irately. "You have the address?"
“I agree.” Another voice added, and John turned to meet his mate’s eyes as he closed the hidden door, cloak over his arm. “Your strategy is rather sloppy.”
"Movies?"
“Welcome back, sir.”
“It’s rather overstayed its welcome.” John agreed mildly, straightening the shirt at its seams.
"You're so pale—" He was cut short as a quiet bullet entered his frontal lobe and exited out of the back of his brain. He collapsed to the floor, bleeding from that small hole planted so much like a third eye in the middle of his forehead.
But it wasn't, was it?
Sherlock would be under full surveillance for no less than 48 hours following tonight. Sherlock was in no serious physical injury to warrant a hospital visit, but Mycroft knew it was the unseen wounds he needed to worry about. Although he was hesitant to call it a suicide watch—since it was easy enough for Sherlock to break his sober streak if it meant a distraction—that did not eliminate the more than probable risk of an intentional overdose on his part.
“You’ve never spent two days with me, love. Let’s go to dinner, get to know each other a little better.”
"What if I promised you a reward?"
—in every sense of the word.
"You look lovely." John deadpanned.
“Moriarty had other ideas, John.”
"You should really reconsider giving your number to psychopaths." John said from his chair. John, beautiful, loyal, brave, level-headed John, closed his book and turned to look at Sherlock over the chair. "So, how's Moriarty?"
There are no tears or hugs or kisses. They are both too raw for that, too naked and bare before the other and the uncomfortable self-consciousness hasn't completely left them yet.
"I was heavily invested."
This will be fun.
"What do you mean they're

“I don’t want you to leave.”
perfect, isn't he?" Jim smirks as he circles Sherlock. "He came along and you let him in, but you never do that with anyone, do you? But he's different…he
Unsavoury, but plausible, and more necessary for John’s safety. The chance of a permanent fallout of their friendship is high.
“You’ve been misinformed, sadly.” He bites out. “Our association is at an end as well. I wasted—” He stops. He is overcome with the urge to break something. He has spent a month here, a month, a captive, a gun for hire, and for what? Moran isn’t here. Moran is not. Here. A month is gone, Moran is gone, he was never here in the first place, not when it was crucial, not when it mattered—he wants to break something—
"That's the idea."
"John," Sherlock says with a hard voice cast in stoicism. "You must survive this as you do everything else: with an annoyingly high success rate. You must. It is absolutely imperative because everything is heavy without you. I did
That tremble made the everlasting air."
"Don't be silly, John. Why would I threaten someone who is on my side? Furthermore, threats are what thugs and ineffective mobsters use for immediate coercion. I am not a thug or ineffective."
"How long?"
"How are you, Greg?" He asks, leaping over a fallen log. "I forgot to ask earlier—"
He crosses the room and bounds up the stairs, throwing open the door so hard it slams against the wall. John's window has been smashed inwards, pieces of glass littering the floor, and he hastily shrugs on a pair of John's ratty slippers to trek across the mess on the floor. Rain sweeps in through the broken sill, splashing against the floorboards as it howls into the room.
Nothing about Irene's body language changed, but he could tell she was keeping something reserved, hidden away up her sleeve as always, but not from them—rather, from the silent fool standing close by, red eyes fixated on the grave.
, but
He looks to John.
“I’ll let you in.” A tired voice crackled.
John recognised the hypocrisy of his statement then chose not to address it, feeling that it sounded much more guilt-inducing if he blamed it wholly on Sherlock. Except it
When Mikheia broke the silence, his voice was gentle, quiet. "We are in the same barge, you and I."
“Can you turn that down?” I hear myself say, just to say it, just to say something. “There’s too much crying.”
, don't want you to."
"Which usually prove to be right."
"You knew?"
The rumpled sheets had fallen off the bed, kicked off as she had struggled. The pillow was still warm, still smelled of her, the scent light and unencumbered.
In that one terrible moment his mind returns to him as it sobers itself with the knowledge that he’s gotten his hopes up. He’s let his faith in John get the better of him, again. Shame wells up in him, flashing as quick as anger and feeling as cold as grief.
“A…theologist? You visited a theologist at three in the morning. Forgive my scepticism, brother mine, but this seems a bit farfetched, even for you.”
"Well no, not exactl—oh
? The neutrality of your response negates your argument." Sherlock scooted closer out of the excitement of explanation. He liked the look in John's eyes as he
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s been sick.” John says, hands on his hips. “Very sick. I broke one of his paws, but I managed to fix most of the damage.”
“That’s very kind of you, Felix. But I can’t say that I want for much, if anything.”
what Sherlock had pictured. He'd imagined horns and a bifurcated tail and cloven hooves and…well, not a normal looking man in a sharply cut charcoal coloured suit with bare feet mucking what looked like tar onto the floor.
“That may be an exaggeration, love. We’ll do just fine yet. It’s nothing so serious that we can’t recover. Look at the beauty: art, music, the way the sun feels, the trees and the animals. Look at their endurance. They’ve survived, and so can we.”
“3 months?” The doctor’s face furrows as he thinks. “There were three patients from a house fire two weeks ago, and one from a car accident this weekend…”
Worse still, it growls back.
John stares at him like he's suddenly sprouted a second head.
“What do you need Milo for?” She asks, examining a cup where a neglected evaporation of coffee took place long ago.
The heart inside Sherlock Holmes began to smoke.
Mikheia gripped the note in his hand.
Sherlock stared at his brother, his hands shaking at his sides. Mycroft sensed his collapse before he did and helped him to the bed.
"Ne možete tugovati svima."
After a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock rang the callbox.
"Holmes."
“To good fortune.” Sherlock agreed.
He looked. There, in the yard, just beyond the stairs and sloping down towards the road, was a stag. It sniffed at the lawn, heart pounding dully, monotonously, as it scrounged for its dinner. He could hear the blood pass through it, running to the tips of its ears, its legs, its belly. It was a strong animal, compact and lean. It would do.
He turns and blocks the punch suddenly flying at his face. Sherlock whirls on him again, tossing the phone at him.
"Emma's."
"So he just
John was silent, considering.
He comes to stand beside John, who stares down at the body with a vague curiosity that Sherlock can only hope is his attempt at subpar deduction. Something all-encompassing and burning and quick crashed through him; he feels like he's drunken something hot that scalds his insides.
"I'd never hurt you. I'd never hurt you." Sherlock mutters into John's neck, and John is reminded of yesterday, when Sherlock had been exhausted and apologetic and uncensored.
“Ah, I see…you haven’t told him your true intentions. Not very sporting of you.” Sherlock chastised.
“A barrier?”
"Yes, you are the loquacious type."
“I—it was a trick, John. Just a—a magic trick, that’s all.”
He pulled them out, twin metal circles dangling from the chain wrapped around his hand. His dogtags.
“And if they aren’t on the guest list?”
*   *   *
“It’s not the same. You forget I’m there.”
!” She shouts.
“I thought you would appreciate it.” I hears myself say softly, much too softly for someone trying to seem better, bigger, than what he was, or what he was feeling. “I was trying to be…like you.”
"I had all your equipment boxed up for you, dear." Mrs Hudson says from behind him. "They're in your room if you want to get them out. I'm sure John won't mind. They've been waiting for you, after all."
John stands, carefully manoeuvring to the front, grateful for the opportunity to work his sore muscles. They had deemed it too risky to stop for anything but the occasional piss break, and even those were rushed.
His soul began to breathe again, basking in its revival.
"I don't know."
John ignores me. I suppose he’s been without me so long he’s now accustomed to living alone, without interruption, more than he ever was with a life crammed to the gills with me and all the things I asked of him.
"John?"
.” He sighs, gripping the edge of his desk with white knuckles. “Not one bloody word.”
"What—um—what about your wings?"
“Do you think he’s trying to give us a red herring? Something to throw us off or distract us?”
Sherlock had been stupid, so incredibly stupid for trusting him, for loving him, for thinking that he might never die or at least if he did, it would be with Sherlock beside him so they could go together. He'd be lying if he said that he hadn't really considered what would happen if
"Not to you. Not to civilians. And you aren't wearing a uniform, so that makes you a civilian."
you anymore.”
He was wrong.
Sherlock looked away, his mind already racing through the scenario. Harry took the car, and Billy willingly went with her, flirting, hoping for sex. She missed the entrance to the cabin, but swerved off the road for privacy; she’d fed on him then, probably killed him in the car, tried to mop up some excess blood so she didn’t spill and ruin the upholstery, an oddly considerate thing for her to do. She carried his body back while they found the car, inebriated with the alcohol content of his blood; she put a record on –
But sometimes that was all he could do. Thinking was his greatest strength. If they had never met, he would have gone on reaping humanity for its finest souls, draining and using every person he could find, until he was either caught, killed, or starved by poisoned blood. John would have been worse off; he had a huge streak for guilt and self-punishment, and an even wider margin for danger. Sherlock didn’t have to guess what would have happened to him: killed in battle, or by his own hand. He’d said as much before, of the decades after he’d been bitten spent in a vicious battle with himself, the loss of his humanity, hidden away in a self-imposed exile, wandering though the hills of Turkey, Hungary, Northern Italy. He knew John had a harder time coping with his immortality than he did; Sherlock had asked to be turned, and John had never had a choice.
“It’s a wonder my parents managed to procreate someone of my intelligence, much less Mycroft or Quinn.”
“I did drink from you.” Irene said plainly, crossing her legs in a ruffle of fabric. “His perception of that event is clear.”
occupation, and he’s sacrificed his life for mine and I want to know why.”
"Oh."
Lestrade begins to speak.
It’s begun to rain. Sherlock bursts out the back door, squinting into the dark watery night for a sign of the fleeing biker.  The neon sign reflects off the cars parked in the back lot, the light running off the dented and worn surfaces.
Human?
here? I’m gonna blink a few times soon, do I have the go ahead?”
"Right. I'm going out." He says, turning and heading back to their room, where the majority of his clothes are, have been since before he left and returned.
"You're not in bed yet?" John asked, shedding his cardigan and hanging it.
“And, since you care about things, you have a capacity for great compassion, which can be a strength, but also great naivety, which is a weakness. You trust easily—five minutes with Molly and you were already on the way to becoming best friends—but that may be because you can read people so well or feel their thoughts, as you said. Just like anyone else who has been stuck in one place for too long and have arrived in a new one, you’re eager to discover London—and Earth in general I suppose—yet you’ve stayed at the flat nearly all week. You wouldn’t go to Bart’s with me…but you seemed perfectly content, so who was I to question your happiness? Although I suspected there was a reason why you weren’t leaving. No one visits somewhere new and doesn’t go out to explore, to discover.”
How odd it was, that fated had scripted John Watson to die not one block away from the house where Sherlock Holmes was sitting, quietly picking at a plate of steaming varenyky and thinking, as always, of John.
"Yes, yes, are you an idiot?"
No one new had come into the courtyard, so he couldn't test his deductive skills on anything new unless he wanted to subject it to the tree.
“I know. We need to find her.”
As they stepped into the den, John felt Sherlock stiffen beside him, going ramrod straight. The place was a mess – broken records, shattered guitars, busted amplifiers tossed and bullied over. Someone was laying on the sofa, head turned away, but they didn’t have to see it to know it was Billy. His shirt was unbuttoned, twin gashes on the side of his neck still sluggishly oozing blood from a rapidly purpling wound.
It sounded like John expected a simple, untangled answer, not the snares and knots of questions Sherlock kept snagging himself on.
The hammer that was used to break Moran’s fingers is in Sherlock’s gloved palm, arcing through the air with all of the force Sherlock can muster behind it, and it smashes into Moran’s face with the crunch of bone and the squelch of pulpy flesh being flayed apart. Moran’s head kicks back in reaction, blood pouring from a large gash on his cheek, edging towards the mottled purple and yellow shoreline of a bruise from earlier. Sherlock sets down the hammer as Moran howls in pain and carefully examines the tips of his glove.
“Yes. I believe it will.”
As John wobbles on his feet, Georgiy says something to Mikheia.
"How?"
John might be off enjoying the small mountain down of Damüls, Austria. John might throw a snowball at him when he least expected it and say "Christ Sherlock, you look like a fucking barbet with wet hair, you know that, right?". John might stumble through rudimentary German when he ordered his food-although he was always good at picking up useful phrases (must have been from his time in the army)- and then marvel as Sherlock broke out in flawless German, complete with accent, proclaim it
Three. Years.
"Me? I expect John and I will get a slap on the wrist or a time-out. Members of the agency have done far worse things."
He stood and rushed to the door, throwing it open and closed before bounding down the stairs.
"I understand that it's one thing to kill the enemy and it's quite another to kill a child, but he
Sherlock felt a small tremor of laughter ripple underneath his ear and lifted his head to see John smiling at him.
This was an existence that he couldn't abide by. Not after he'd tasted the divinity of being with
"Where?" He says, already shrugging into his coat. "The VC Mill? Got it. On my way."
"Maybe one day, once I've wrapped my head around it all first."
“I know.” John sighed, yawning. “I couldn’t tell her no. She’s been travelling…you know how that fries us out.”
“No, he didn’t,” John says, moving away to unbutton his shirt, opening it to smooth skin. “See? He didn’t touch me.”
Sherlock scoffed and didn't answer as he threw himself into the nearest chair. Mikheia set down the guitar gently. His uncle had been like this, turning to the bottle when he didn't know how to handle a situation properly.
He reached backwards for anything to grab that would help him throw off the madman biting at his jugular. The man's grip was strong, stronger than he looked, and his jaw was clamped tightly around his throat. God, mama would kill him for ruining the shirt. It was soaked in his blood. He could feel it flowing from him, strong as the river current.
Lestrade says nothing, but unlocks Moran from the chair and leads him from the room.
“He’s not here right now,” the voice says again, right in his ear, “but I’ll be happy to assist.”
“Can you stop that?” Harry asks, shooting a glare towards the passenger seat.
Sherlock sat up suddenly, hovering over John with a mad frenzy in his eyes as he cards a hand through wild hair.
"Zdravo?"
"And you think that my death will give you that? What about Sherlock? He'll come after you with everything he's got."
As a child, Sherlock had never had patience for art. He saw nothing remotely useful or of interest to him in splashes pretending to be despair or boring English landscapes dotted with horses or vaginas masquerading as flowers or any other ridiculous means of expressionism. He liked symbolism, he liked detail, that much was true, but he never saw any value if it was splayed on a canvas.
"Being walkers with the dawn and morning,
"I think they have more important things to discuss, love."
“Wonderful. Most felonies are committed around two.”
"You're supposed to love me." Sherlock replies hoarsely, hair clinging to his face with rain and dirt.
"No, Sherlock, I mean—Christ—I mean you can't just say those things you said and then—and then
"Among others, yes."
to. You want to fuck Holmes, do you?” Azazel grins, leaning against the open doorway. “No one’s stopping you, Johnny. Just yourself.”
“What do you know about painting?” Sherlock scoffs, taking a shallow drag.
“They’re killing us, John.”
"I imagine a bullet wound hurts in the cold."
." Sherlock finishes with disgust.
The fourth was entirely practical, not joyless, but more a matter of efficiency. And yet each time, it was Sherlock who asked, and each time, it had been no more planned or expected than the others that came before. John had come to learn not to consider it too deeply; they both knew what the answer would be, that it would always remain so.
--//--
Mikheia stands in front of him with a wild expression for a moment, as if he can’t believe what he’s hearing, and sets down John’s glass a little more forcefully than he should have, sloshing water onto the end table. His eyes are bright as he leans forward.
Then he understood. Get to John, get Sherlock. Crack the egg, get the omelette. John meant nothing to Jim, only his influence on Sherlock did, and if Moran ever wept over anything, it would have been that realisation. It was a beautiful thing, to know that he was the only soldier in his madman's life. John had his place, and Moran had his.
"Are you alright?"
"That's not very polite."
John stared at him a moment, then threw his arms around that scrawny git of a detective. Despite the pain that bit at every inch of him and despite his muscles screaming in protest, John clutched Sherlock tightly to him, feeling tears prick at his eyes.
He shuts his eyes. It is a pronounced and terrible moment when one realises how vastly their mistake stretches, as if they could reach into that cold spot inside themselves and rewind time so this horrible moment ceases to happen.
“I don’t want to die.” John said as the dishes settled and the room fell into silence.
” The one that looks to be a diplomat begins solemnly.“
“Tell her I’ll be waiting. Tell her I’ll still love her, please.”
his relation to Sherlock Holmes, knew they had lived together, knew what they had done (all of London did anyways), and they knew he had requested that the assignments be complete strangers to him. They knew that he wouldn't take Sherlock out.
The prince smiled at him, stopping before a set of two great doors. “You,
But John had also let him live. He had spared him, and now Sherlock owed him his life, not that he would ever have pulled that trigger.
"Captain
"Mikheia," Sherlock said, rolling his eyes, "She's a hostage, not a child."
"Well, drink up then." John said, motioning to the untouched cup. "I was told by a nice employee at the front desk that the coffee was very good for stressful mornings."
“Yes,
"What do you have to do with them?"
“I don’t like it any more than you do, but I know my brother. He won’t budge. Not about this. Not about him.”
"He threatened to kill you and make me watch." John said quietly. "So I suppose he's not so different from Moriarty in his M.O. But I'm only giving you the basics. He said much...worse things."
“Remember what I said about you counting more than you think you do.” He says softly before he smiles and walks out of the storage unit.
“Where is he, Mycroft? I need proof that he is where you say he is. I know you have it.”
"Yes," Sherlock finally speaks up, "but that was before—"
. You’ll never guess what the island nearby is called.”
“John I—may I stay?”
Molly lays her head against Will's shoulder, the two of them staring at the small golden ring, glinting in the light. The delicate filigree - the shape similar to a W with a diamond at the bottom - was enthralling.
He reached for the doorknob, turning it.
"The what?" Hope squinted.
“Yes, mother. I’m eating fine.”
“If this is where you make a bad metaphor about crocheting, I’m leaving.”
“Sherlock,” John cuts in before he can retort. “You don’t have a brother.”
The wear of a new body being battered by possession. It amazes him how unchanged John looks. He’d assumed, wrongly, that corporeal form was subjective to each existence. John looks like John.
“Do you know,” The voice starts again, “that there is a special room in an American university, in Minnesota I believe. It’s an anechoic chamber. You know this word? Anechoic?”
,” John corrected, although how many of these gaffes were genuine or for her own end, he had no idea, “and you’re younger than I am.”
Lestrade is torn between being grateful that he is on Sherlock’s good side and being absolutely terrified of what life would be like if he was not.
"I'll bet you were the bottom." John said calmly and Moran lashed out again, tossing a handful of pastries at him.
"John—"
Steam rose off their bodies through the silence.
"Well...I mean normally when someone asks you to kiss them, it kind of happens…as in one party doesn't suddenly get cold feet."
Before Moran could move John placed a foot on the back of his neck, keeping him pinned into the dirt as he aimed his gun at the back of his head.
Lestrade turns away from examining the mantle, which consisted of various knicknacks, candles, and a bust of what look to be Napoleon.
(See the end of the chapter for
The light in Sherlock's room is muted and dim, shadows rising and peaking around them like mountains.
Somehow—and he won’t question it—they make it to the bottom of the hill, where Georgiy waits with his cart full of chickens and all his worldly belongings. John and Mikheia tumble inside as the old man spurs his horse forward, his back turned to all he has in the world, burning behind him.
"Oh, no, I got the chance. Plenty of times." Moran sniffed. "Hundreds, even. I just didn't throw myself in front of a bullet or cover him if a bomb went off—no, that's too
He could hear John's breath hitch. Oh god, he said something wrong—
Mycroft looks at him, truly looks, and he sees something promising. Something worth having around.
"Ready?"
“You loved him.”
The door closes behind him as he sits across from Moran, Lestrade hovering in the corner of the room.
He shuts his eyes. As he breathes out an exhale, he pretends it’s his last. That maybe he can trick his body into dying on its own so his mind will be quiet for once, the good kind of quiet that feels like rainy nights reading while John writes, not the terrible high silence that burned through his mind like he was flat-lining as that garage burst into flame.
"John." He leans forward, meeting his friend's half-opened eyes. They're a dull blue, faded from sleep and a consistence haze of pain, like fog.
He stands silently beside the Detective Inspector, staring down at the corpse.
"Shrlk, I—"
John folds the washcloth across his forehead, crosses his arms behind his head and leans back.
“Why?”
." Sherlock says, turning the screen to John.
“Evening.” A chipper voice says. Male, hint of an accent, possibly Finnish. More data—
“Something…different.” She frowns. “I can’t feel him, exactly; it’s muddled, like staring through fogged glass. He’s still
"John?" Sherlock's voice came from outside, just before the bakery. He was walking their way.
The man nods, holding out his hands. “Of course. What can I do for you?”
“You know,” Harry reflects after a moment, “the craziest thing about that was that you weren’t even wearing a seatbelt the whole time…”
I am dismissing all classes for the day, but before we leave I would like to ask each of you to join me in a moment of silence for Rachel, and her dear memory."
“Not your ugly mug, Jim.” Sally sniffs, reaching out into the hall to usher someone in. “You’ve got a new friend to keep you company. So play nice. No funny stuff, I mean it.”
He sips. Three sugars, light milk.
“Your mechanics are simple here. I can’t really explain it…it’s like pulling the blinds or opening a door; it’s very easy to understand.”
“Keep—”
,” Artemisia corrected, “It is heartening to see that people still desire good art.”
“A pleasure.” John nodded, shaking each of their hands before going to sit in one of the armchairs opposite.
"I think he wanted to. But I helped him, so then maybe he did not want to."
For a gyroscope to spin again after it stops, you must rewind the string and pull.
Sherlock stands, straightening his pyjama legs.
"You're no youngling either, you great ponce."
“You are my only friend, John. You are the best by default. You are also my boyfriend, loathe I am to use the term, and my flatmate and my—”
His breath evened.
"I promised if I wouldn't fall apart, I would remember everything. You would come back if I kept myself together, in one piece."
“Same difference. Tell me.”
In his dream, Sherlock had been there with him.
John kisses him against the night and the backlit castle, kisses him for endings and beginnings, for snow falling softly over Bern, for tennis balls smacking against the walls in Prague, for a shirt’s patterns only printed in Stockholm, for close calls and long nights, and for just friends to everythings.
"You can always find me. I will never hide from you, John. Never. And if I do, you can hit me as hard as you like."
"Mikheia Mikhailovic?"
Sherlock snatched the towel away, letting it fall to the floor.
"Hello birdie." He says affectionately.
The drug was in the gum—
"Indeed." Sherlock says, rummaging through the young man's jacket and coming up with a triumphant sound and a monogrammed cigarette case.
“Pfft, our laws. Didn’t stop me. Didn’t stop my ancestors, or yours.”
"Because a partnership becomes a parasitic relationship and a huge waste of time if the pleasure is not reciprocal."
The emptiness.
“Choose what, exactly? The coward’s way out?”
Everything would be alright if he could see that smile again.
“Thank you.”
In that parcel, there is a human heart spattered with dried blood and gold paint.
He stayed close beside him as they walked. Sherlock was vibrating in place, nearly manic as he tried to process whatever he had seen, whatever he was thinking. It roiled through their bond, tampered down one moment with a logical fireblanket, then roaring back to life in the next. Finally, he'd had enough, and dragged Sherlock into a dark corner half-shielded by a butcher's stall. He pinned him against the wall at the knees, shoving their masks up as his hands burrowed into the dark curls, and he pulled their faces together, kissing him deeply, and without hesitation. For a moment, Sherlock seemed to white out, unmoving, channeling nothing over the bond. But then he stirred, pressing closer, anchoring deeper in the feeling as he responded in kind. The press of the bricks, the revitalized sense of closeness, John's current preoccupation with the constellation of moles on his neck
"To which lie are you referring?" Sherlock asked calmly, his eyes still on the horizon.
"Sh'lk."
John says nothing, but wraps an arm around Sherlock's shoulders and kisses his temple.
His eye immediately led to the splintered railing at the side of the house, and the large indent where it was clear a body had been thrown into the wall at a high speed. He tracked the movement back across the lawn, past the scorch marks burned deeply into the earth and the dead, clipped grass. Four knives protruded from the wet dirt, muddied with ash and the distinct smell of burnt calcium, the dried out abrasive smell of crushed powdered eggshells. The blades were planted in the vague shape of an angel, wings outspread and feet below. Insects were buzzing around the unseeing, blank eyes of a stag’s corpse, completely exsanguinated.
“Why?” Sherlock asked quietly. “I thought…I thought when I got better you might—” Might what? Forgive him? Forget what he’d done? “I thought we would be like it was.”
"Sherlock, if it were Mycroft—"
"That," she said, "is a question I can't answer. You'll need to see the monsignor."
?” He grins and John smiles. “And you,
. What have we said about consent?"
"I may have had Mikheia put a crushed morphine tablet into the biscuit you just ate."
"I know." Sherlock answered quietly into John's hair, his lips brushing his ear.
"What?"
“Does it hurt?”
It’s beautiful.
Greg shuts the paper and tosses it to them.
happy."
“Sounds good to me.” John whispered, a red-streaked hand running through Sherlock’s hair.
John had sighed in utter contentment, but dried wind swept it away as Sherlock plummeted into a hollow, dry pit that undulated with darkness. Sherlock could taste the bitterness of blackberries bursting in his mouth, even though nothing sat on his tongue. Like clots of coagulating blood sitting in his mouth that he couldn't spit out. He took a deep breath and recoiled. Chlorine. That dizzyingly sharp, stinging, clear scent that was so like Moriarty's cologne to him.
"It was as John said." Irene sighed, a distant and hollow look in her dark eyes. "There wasn't any coming back for her. Not again."
"I know, John. I know. We're almost there. You'll be alright...you have to be alright."
"I think you know very well of my intention to stay with you, John." Sherlock paused. "But you are why I left. I left so you might live unencumbered and safe. I can't be responsible for any more wounds."
“Sherlock, you can’t just toss that around, you can’t just use it—”
“Well your strategy could be…recalibrated.” Sherlock offered, a grin coming to his face. He hadn’t felt so light, so relaxed, in
“What if the poison fails?” The lawyer asked after a moment. “We need to be prepared for every outcome.”
"Will you abandon him?"
Yes, he can.
“Fine.” He sighed, knowing it was best to capitulate than to fight her. “Order whatever you want, but send Mycroft the invoice—”
The chair he’s strapped to begins to whir and he realises belatedly that it’s the same kind as one found in a dentist’s office. He can do nothing but wait until he’s brought up into a sitting position, the light blaring into the sensitive tucked away pains in the back of his head.
“You wanted to kill yourself.”
Soldier. Gun for hire. Author.
"Yes, but only because you are as well."
He had fallen asleep in John's arms, sated and happy but fearing that he had become rather spoiled now and knowing that he'd never fall asleep again if John wasn't there. He just knew.
, John." Sherlock gritted out. He didn't have time for games, not when he harboured that desperate need for his suspicions to be confirmed so he could properly, as John would say,
“We should just show him.”Lestrade says solemnly. “What channel do you think it will be on?”
“What would you do, if you lost me?” Sherlock asks solemnly
He licked a finger, dipping it into the large bag of powder. Rubbed it on his gums, the taste bitter and chemical. This haul was…okay. He’d had better, but it’s not like the teenagers of Twin Peaks could tell good shit from bad. They’d swallow it down without complaint and he’d get his money.
As the vampire struggled against the silver, twisting around to pull the blades out, John grabbed his hand at the wrist, snapping it cleanly, staking it into the earth with another knife. He then stabbed him through the back of his other hand, piercing it clean through and rotating the handle so the tendons tore with it. When Billy was finally immobile, unable to remove his limbs from their constraints, John took Sherlock’s gun from his pocket, pointed it at his heart, and fired.
Sherlock purses his lips.
"Mikheia, wait!" John tucked his gun back into his belt and jumped over the machine as well as he ran after him, Sherlock following close behind.
The tall man hummed as he reviewed the board. “‘I held the sword, and he did run on it.’”
“We’ve been busy since Paris.” John said calmly, not broaching the subject but leaving it open for apology she might have. He brought his thumb against the nape of Sherlock’s neck, brushing the soft hairs in a soothing circle.
Once, he'd even smashed a cup of hot tea in his hand. That had been quite stupid. Sherlock would've scoffed and called him an idiot. Yet no such thing happened and John was left to bandage his burned, bloody hand in silence, which was the worst of all because it meant no one was there to rebuke him except himself, and he said to himself much worse things than Sherlock ever would, even on a bad day.
“I called on you at your home. You deigned to answer. Upon further investigation, I can see why. Where were you tonight?”
“I’d say I’m more of a realist.” John said, running his hand over Sherlock’s cheek. “Do you feel better?”
"Why?"
WARNING: Sexual Activity
. They were windless, a vacuum of darkness and heat and misery. The only reason that I've asked about you so much is because I spent every single day, all one thousand two-hundred and a half of them, wondering. Wondering about you, thinking about you, worrying about you. I had thoroughly convinced myself that you were in Baker Street, moving on with your life. I am not shutting you out, in fact, it's the contrary. I am letting you back in. Forgive me if I am being callous about it, but it's a new experience for me. Once people are out, they're out. You're the first. You're the first in this osmotic practise."
“But you didn’t know the man. All I’m saying is that…people, humans, they don’t fit into the bodies we want them to. Are they our friends, or our enemies? We came from them, yet we’re apart. We need them to survive, but they don’t need us. They act as one, but are so different when you look closely. How do you reach all, when everyone is only concerned with themselves? It is a hard road to navigate.”
"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
"You are a cruel man, Mr. Holmes. You had me thinking I was incorrect in my theories."
"What about them? Do they bother you?"
They both downed the sake and she drew a kit from her side, opening it to reveal bottles of ink and a pack of sterile needles, waving over a tattooed man from where he hovered in the corner.
John whips around, but there is nothing behind him. His eyes dart around the room. He didn't imagine that; a woman had spoken just now, her voice high and airy. Perhaps Sherlock had the TV on and it had come through the vents. That happened in quiet places. Sound carries, after all.
“Apologies,” The voice says, turning the light away towards the wall, “You must be feeling very disoriented right now. I can’t say your friend is doing much better.”
I am invisible and weightless
A slow smile comes to John's face and Sherlock finds it's soon reflected on his.
“Why?”
"Don't worry, you didn't break any rules or anything." John smiles. "I hide them in crowds, in case they attract too much attention. Walking with you on the street is fine, but in dense areas I don't want to risk a mob if suddenly everyone sees my wings and thinks I'm some divine archangel."
"It conveys things in such an underrated, unique way. Arousal, attraction, affection, comfort—"
He stops at the door Mycroft sent him to.
"Sh—Sherlock." John gasped out, both men looking to him before he trailed off, closing his eyes.
"That's what you want, isn't it?" John groaned, head lolling forward briefly before falling back to stare at the high ceiling. "It's why you took Sherlock earlier. To get back at him, for Jim."
“Look at that. Our session is done.”
Sherlock had taught him to pick up details on people with one sweeping gaze. Inconspicuous. Something normal and unobtrusive when one walks into unknown territory.
Yes, it was very clear what had happened here. In any other circumstance, he might have been pleased at the cleanliness of the narrative, how obvious the events of the night before had unfolded. He had, however, other things to worry about.
"John, what—"
John can’t help himself; he shuts his eyes.
John can barely keep his eyes open, his mind swimming in heavy relief and fatigue, when he hears Sherlock pad back into the kitchen, the tile scuffing against his bare feet. He feels something heavy and warm drape over him.
He had to get back to the hotel.
"Just what in the hell
He surfaced out of their bond, reveling in their shared spaces. He had finally seen where they were, and, after so long of spinning in circles, he knew which way to lead them.
Sherlock turns the man's head, revealing a series of puncture marks lining his neck, one after the other, four neat dots.
“Who’s the one who insists on proof and facts before conclusions?” John countered, going over to his cabinet and unlocking it, pulling out the velvet box.  “I’m not saying it’s baseless, Sherlock, but you’re going to have to give me more than your word.”
“You already made me believe that once.”
John undoes the latch to the cage and enters, closing it behind him before Sherlock follows. He tries not to be upset; John did have a point about his chances against this thing, even if it was injured. Although what a wonderful opportunity for an examination. That would be marvellous, to take his pocket magnifier out and run it over every inch of this endlessly fascinating creature. And then maybe John would let him look at the beast too.
Sherlock always hated train-station chatter.
Sherlock shrunk back at his tone, clearly not expecting such a potent venom at the intrusion.
“Yes.” Sherlock forces from a stiff jaw. “A demon sent on someone else’s orders. A mercenary.”
"What did you do to him?"
Then the hounds had caught scent of the stag, surrounding it in the wake of night, just before dawn. The leader of the party had the honors of striking the first blow, but aside from that it was impossible to tell man from dog, the frenzy whipping up clouds of dirt around the wounded animal as it let out the shrill call of the helpless and the dying. John told him later how he hated the sound, and thus rarely took invitations to hunt; he was merciful, and hunting for sport was contrary to his instincts. John was good and kind, and Sherlock could not say he felt the same sentiment when the stag was pierced through the heart and he scented its atomized blood and platelets in the air.
He'd better get to work then.
John paused, brow crinkling. “When?”
James reappears, wiping his hands on a towel. “No, that’s not necessary. I just feel like I have to warn you.”
John shrugged. “You heard me.”
Moriarty was but not
“You called him a coward.”
"The shadow of what?"
The ground seems a million miles away. It’s begun to rain again, as if the sky is trying to wash away the proof of their existence. He can see the droplets of water pass his face, he can see the light in them reflected from the streets.
But he didn’t care now. All the longing, the pent-up emotions, the silent, solitary nights he spent travelling with emptiness beside and in him, he felt it now. He’d missed the great idiot.
Sherlock didn’t answer and John sighed, rolling his eyes and looking heavenward as if some divine intervention might ever stop the Holmes brothers from meddling in other people’s affairs.
“Do you know why you will die tonight?” He asks her softly.
"Perhaps. But tonight was different, wasn't it?"
Sherlock is looking at him like he's answered something of vital importance.
"Got it," Harry says, tapping on the laver.
“Sherlock, he died. Last night.”
Sherlock shuts his eyes.
John doesn't reply, but turns away, wiping his hand on the nearest tree.
“Not asking you,” John rasps, “I’m telling you. Just this once. For you. Can't be your end, Sh'lck.”
"Stay." He says quietly and John doesn't have it in him to argue. What else does he have to do? What else
As he waits for his drink, choosing to be blind to the winks of the bartender and her cleavage damn near in his face, he wonders how often criminals think of their mothers. It’s a passing thought, and allows him to look lost in concentration. He never thinks of his mother. He thinks of John, and Mrs Hudson, and his home. He thinks of the life he’s traded for this shiny false existence.
"Really?" John laughed bitterly. "Then why'd she leave me in Bruges?"
"Just tell us why we're here." John growled. "The bodies, the murders, left out like pieces of candy, to what? Lead us to some party of jaded octocenarians looking for a thrill?"
"Hurry back." Sherlock calls.
"They've been drugging me, Sherlock." John said hoarsely, looking up at him with red-rimmed eyes. "They've been drugging me, and I've been killing people for them." A sour laugh escaped him. "I didn't even think twice about it! Anyone else would have realised what was going on,
After an hour's search, Sherlock found John in an empty men's room, which was normal enough; he believed it was the one he had passed on the way in to meet Mary. It was best that John didn't know, at least not until he could explain it all—
would not cure John Watson's wounds, it would rip them apart.
“Harriet.” He nodded to the man at the door, confirming the identity.
“I don’t know.” John admitted quietly. “I haven’t decided.”
“John, wait, don’t—”
"Thank God."
"Me? Yes, of course, I wasn't the one that was shot at."
"Keep your masks on," Irene said as she reached for the knob. "Anonymity is part of the fun."
That first week afterwards he would stumble out of bed and vomit into the sink, images of Sherlock's bloodied face burning in his mind. The first few days afterwards he hadn't made it to the sink.
But he has no idea how long Moran had been alone with John.
"You'll have a lot more to thank after I'm through with you, mate—"
“Come on,” Harry says, unbuckling her seatbelt, “we’ve got work to do.”
! Not your soul, not us, not anything!” John’s voice cracks and he stops. “It’s—I know it’s hard for you to understand…you haven’t been there. But I have, and I’m telling you now, you will
The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
He sighed, loose ash falling from the cigarette dangling in his mouth. Another day, another dollar. If anyone had told him five years ago that he’d go from the desert to hustling coke over the border for high school kids, he’d have decked them. Of course, that was when he was just out of military school, all shiny and new. Something in his gut burned at the thought, at his naivety and the
“But alas,” The man says, turning to where the light was shining, “your friend damaged my friend. What might we do about that?”
By the time he’d returned to himself, Sherlock was leaning over him, wearing a devastated, grim expression, one he hadn’t seen often and never wanted to see again, and he’d kissed him, if only to make it go away.
"You lot alright?" He asks, cautiously moving towards them.
“And you asked me ‘Didn’t I even know where you kept your shoes,’ do you remember that?” Sherlock asked, brushing John’s hair away from his face. John whimpered at the touch, drifting in the sensation and whatever memory Sherlock chose to show him through the bond, sending him lower and lower into consciousness, keeping him subdued as Mycroft separated the skin of John’s shoulder to pick out the pieces of microscopic embedded wood.
it’s suspicious, but Sherlock…it’s a hotel. It’s wood and steel and plaster. It’s a building. A building can’t influence you, it can’t…possess you.”
“You were sitting on that for fifty years.”
,” Not-John asks, his voice breaking. “Why did you leave me alone?”
“They will be…once we find a body that matches his records.” Mycroft says solemnly and watches Sherlock’s movements freeze.  “Sherlock, we will have to consider the fact that John, if he is out there, might not be alone.”
As he passed beneath a bridge, he spotted a figure on the banks, cloaked in dark layers against the morning cold. It raised a hand, hailing him over. He steered to the side, and held the gondola still as the figure stepped in.
“Where was this taken?” Sherlock asks, brow furrowed.
"Dr. Watson." He says lowly, surprised that anyone is up at this hour, much less out and about in such an adventureless town. "John. To what do I owe this pleasure?"
"People always need a taxi. You have to start early if you want to make any money. I thought he was some leftover straggler heading home from a party."
There, a raw, scrubbed pink covers an old body—but new in so many ways—that lies on the floor. There, unconscious, but
Sherlock felt bad about leaving the boy.
“Why’d he say it then?”
It's well past midnight when the station door opens. A light tapping sounds through the quiet office, followed by slow footsteps.
Ne is waiting at the foot of the stairs, wrapped in shadow as if it was part of him. Sherlock walks past him as if he’s a stranger, although really, what’s the difference?
" Sherlock did not shout, did not raise his voice, but his whisper was like razor wire, slicing through the room, hoarse from its idleness.
He hadn't smoked in over a hundred days. He'd lit a cigarette in Damüls but hadn't had the heart or time to smoke it, not with John's voice chastising him in his head. He'd stubbed it out before meeting his contact, knowing it wouldn't be what John wanted for him. It had been his way of appeasing the restless darkness that was Non-John, the space that John would have occupied if he had trusted him, if he'd told him about Moriarty and St. Bart's and not kept it to himself so he could finally relish the feeling of winning and knowing he alone had done it. Instead he had lost everything.
There were no windows, so he was either underground or they had planted him somewhere that everyone could see but no one would suspect. Now, what was so close that he could be taken with minimal fuss or attention, with no conceivable windows that wouldn't arouse suspicion of the general populous—
“Were you expecting me to say it was the same colour as his eyes?” Sherlock says coolly.
, man, give me a break!” His fear has soured into exasperation and he throws two fingers towards the demon. “Fuck off, okay?”
"Are the Four Horsemen outside yet? Has everything gone to hell? People being raptured in the streets?"
"It was
"Why do you think they left that—um—particular area behind?" Lestrade asks. "If they kept the heart as a souvenir, why leave this?"
"Oh, don't even give me that. This carriage is empty save for the couple at the far end and you know it."
They descended into the waiting darkness, the bells still knelling in the distance. He hoped that their ringing did not usher in their end. He hoped they might live to hear them once more. But he put the thoughts and hopes of tomorrow out of his mind.
It seemed to John that that was what hurt most.
Information he already knew, of course, but not careless enough to test himself (the average intestine, total, is twenty-odd feet long; his, perhaps longer, or shorter; he didn’t want to approximate).
"That's funny." John says, but his tone indicates it's anything but. "You seemed quite fine risking it here. You thought London—
John raises his eyes to mine.
Busting out Gladstone was the easiest part. No one at the corral had much need for the older horse, but he still had a little spirit in him yet, and at a full gallop his stride could match any prize pony. John had called off at lunch, knowing he'd have nothing but idle hands if left to his own devices on the derrick, which hadn't yielded more than a handful of barrels all week. Although a dry well meant little bread come payday, his belly was full from breakfast, his mind was racing, and the day was too good to pass up playing another round of cards, drinking and waiting for something that might never come.
He reached the last case, and he stared at it, the way he used to when John wasn’t looking (
"I thought you'd forgiven me."
"Sherlock…" His name fell from John's mouth like a benediction.
understanding that the words are irrelevant is of great importance,
He really was just like everyone else. Love seemed to be the common denominator. How interesting.
"Is something wrong, pretty girl?" The idiot asks, finally broken out of that matrix of nothingness to notice her.
Never mind that, it's insignificant now. Get to John.
