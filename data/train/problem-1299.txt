At that moment, William entered into the room. “John! I see you haven’t changed your wardrobe,” he scoffed. “Did not hear my order? If you are to be of any use to me, you must know your place. You are my servant, you are… what are you holding?”
The king thought about how he could help put Sherlock at ease. “Actually, yes. Sit right there, Sherlock.” Sherlock obeyed as John guided him to the chair that the king had just vacated. “You know,” John continued, “I liked it when you played the violin, but I like all the music you make.” Affectionately, he kissed Sherlock’s forehead. “When you cry out for me in bed, that’s a beautiful sound.”
“The post on your blog did as much. In any case…” His voice slowed down, and he leaned a little back. “This chain of events was able to progress as it did because you showed concern for John and spent time with him. And now, I can be honest with him about how I feel.” He paused, and smiled, an expression of gentleness that I had never seen on telly-Sherlock, and clearly it was the telly’s loss. “Thank you, Bertie.”
Sherlock steadied himself by holding John’s hips, though his grasp was maddeningly light and shy. He leaned in closer. “Is this all right, sir?”
John trained with one of the trainees, and then another. After sparring with the third volunteer, John left the young fellow gasping for breath, while the king was not at all winded. While the trainee took a break, John took the opportunity to speak to Sherlock.
Sherlock was close, tempted by John’s kindness to finish inside him, captivated by endless fantasies of the moment they would surrender to each other completely.
“Not always.” Sherlock touched John’s hand, holding onto him while he still could. “Some surely do not make it past the hall of judgment after death, and so never reach paradise. Besides, it depends on how one views paradise. For pharaohs, heaven is said to be a place where gods live and rule over the underworld.”
A sensuous shudder passed through John, and the servant’s hands weakly struggled in their binding. “M’lord,” he breathed.
Before he met John, the king would never have believed that he would let himself be so vulnerable before any ordinary person. Sherlock was a god among his people; he was the divine intermediary between major deities and mortal worshippers. Though Sherlock was not the equal of the most powerful gods, he someday would be, when the king assumed his place in heaven, in that part of the underworld where gods lived and ruled.
Blushing furiously, Sherlock buried his face childishly behind the translucence of his mug. Yet strangely, though Mycroft was chuckling at his discomfiture, a heavy weight was lifted off Sherlock’s shoulders.
Affected by Sherlock’s words, perhaps surprised by the earnestness of the repeated question, the now shirtless king placed the jar to the side and again leaned close to Sherlock, bringing a rush of heat to the servant’s cheeks.
“At least it’s nice to know your own feelings, isn’t it? And to have someone to talk to. At least, I know I appreciate it. I never talked to anyone about Sherlock, except you. I was afraid to talk to anyone I know. I didn’t want them telling him, or even hinting at it, since he’d figure them out.”
It was rather annoying when Mycroft knew something that Sherlock didn’t. “What are you talking about?”
This seemed to only encourage the king. “I’ll keep you safe, Sherlock. You’re so gentle. I saw that right away about you. It’s not something I often see in people. But I know you’re a gentle soul, and I’ll protect you. Besides, there’s a reason we’re in a convoy. Merchants often travel this way. There’s safety in numbers. So you don’t have to be scared, all right?”
“Here, let me help you.” Sherlock gently laid his hands on John’s underwear, and, admiring his beloved’s deep blush, pulled it down, completely undressing his servant while Sherlock was still clothed. He wanted to touch the need that had been revealed, but more than that, he wanted this evening to proceed at a pace comfortable for John.
“No, it’s not. If only I could do that, I…” Suddenly, with a burst of courage, Sherlock turned to the king. “Sir, can I take you in my mouth?”
Mycroft shrugged, probably trying to hide his small prophesied blush. “It may not be to his taste, or to yours. It’s for you to discuss with him if you wish. In any case, my duty is done.”
While Sherlock and I made our relationship public, things were different for Bertie and Reggie. (Reggie is Jeeves’s first name—I’m still getting used to it, but I’m glad he finally told us.) Bertie was discreet about their dates and kept it mostly out of his blog.
King John nodded, as sombrely as if he had admitted to having a dreadful illness. “It’s not right for you to be here when I’m like this.”
Desire had become a mighty force in John, yet he wanted to take his time. He wanted so much from Sherlock, and he was willing to wait for it. Leisurely, John started to massage Sherlock’s rear.
The few possessions he could call his own were in a trunk next to the bed. These consisted of his plain clothing, which felt insufficient in this castle where everybody was dressed in finery, and a little wooden toy that one of his patients during the war had given him long ago. He considered folding all his clothes properly at least, but his life had changed fundamentally that day, and he was exhausted. He barely had enough energy to change into his simple sleeping gown.
John did the best he could for King William. When the enchanting man spent himself, John supported him, cleaning him as thoroughly as before.
Sherlock thought that the proud king looked in his direction when he was declared triumphant, but it was much more likely that King John was merely facing the crowd that cheered for his success.
“That’s all right, Father, I can handle myself.” John nodded his thanks. “I’m sure you have duties here, too.”
William stopped in his tracks, standing a bit uncomfortably. John shuddered to think that his own stain dirtied the nobleman’s legs under the dressing gown, and immediately he regretted stopping him.
Terrified that this was the sound of disappointment, Sherlock felt as if the world were crushing him. “That was presumptuous of me. I h-hope I haven’t offended you,” he said, his voice starting to break from remorse. “I would be grateful if you would allow me to remain your maid, sir.”
“Huh?” It was amazing to see that John was dazed so quickly, from only a kiss on his ankle. “Oh! You didn’t need to do that.”
The smirk on Sherlock’s face lingered for a moment, but then it dropped away, into a much less happy expression. “It’s a fine plan, sir,” the servant said, though he did not sound thrilled.
“Nothing, n-nothing that I should bother you with, sir.” Self-conscious under King John’s scrutiny, Sherlock tried to squirm out of his hold, but the effort was half-hearted, and not nearly enough to hinder the king.
It was indeed a case of blackmail, one that I recount elsewhere. As I would see him do countless times in the future, my friend solved the case and saved his client from a terrible scandal. I could hardly believe it; the man I had come to aid, the one who was supposed to be
“John,” he said to me once, “thank you. You’ve offered nothing but support for my modest output, though what I have to say seems frightfully dull compared to your murder mysteries.”
“I thought I had cured you of that irksome habit,” Sherlock muttered. “However reflective of poor taste it may be, my name is Sherlock, and you may call me as such.”
Sherlock was deeply flattered, as well as flustered, and uncertain of what to do when given this kind of attention, especially from King John. He swallowed when the king grasped his wrist. King John was shaking from self-restraint.
“Let that be the end of it, once and for all,” the king muttered, letting no emotion show. “We’ll get back on the road now and forget all about this.”
Sherlock smiled, and stood up from the bed so he could undress himself for John. His royal dressing gown fell to the floor, revealing only one more layer of clothing. Respectfully, John stared at his own hands. Sherlock gently touched John’s chin and lifted it so his beloved could see everything. “It’s all right, John.”
At his master’s direction, John dressed William carefully, stealing a look at the conflicting emotions passing over the royal face of His Highness. He seemed agitated, yet reserved, evidently in no mood to share whatever was troubling him.
Now that Sherlock was gone, John knew he would need to return to work. It was nearly time for King William to have his supper, so John left the chapel and headed for the kitchen to begin preparations.
After quickly greeting the servants and advisors who greeted him upon his return, John brought Sherlock into the castle, showing him where they would be living for the foreseeable future. John had a luxurious bedroom that had been maintained well during his absence.
“I can’t give you children.” Sherlock huffed, in resignation. “Isn’t it true, that you need an heir?”
Finally, John returned to awareness with deep breaths. His gorgeous servant was still under him. Sherlock’s fair skin was pleasantly flushed, his curls were in disarray from his head rolling around on the bed, and he was panting for breath. There was such a look of ecstasy on Sherlock’s face that John was filled with pride for having satisfied his servant so well. It had been magnificent to inundate Sherlock with so much love and devotion that Sherlock had given in to passion at last.
The eyes of his adorable servant glittered brilliantly. Fervently, Sherlock nodded. “If that’s all right, sir.”
“No, John, I will do something for you.” Sherlock took John’s hand, and gently helped the servant onto his feet. John, though a little flustered, followed without complaint. He walked quietly as he was led to the bathroom.
“Would you mind a kiss?” John asked softly. A kiss would be especially indiscreet, but John could hardly resist.
Upon the end of the war, he learned that his trouble was far from over. His father’s gambling habit had sent the family further into debt, and his sister was turning down the proposal of every man who tried, much to the irritation of their mother. His household was only a source of tension, not comfort.
Yet there’s plenty of time before anything like that could happen, and I was happy to take all the time in the world to get to know Sherlock better.
It was impossible to tell what the king was thinking as he took the reins of the horse again and led their convoy away. While words spoken in moments of passion were not always truthful, the king seemed to find Sherlock appealing to some extent, which was very gratifying; though it also seemed that he was disappointed in himself for having any kind of feelings for a common servant. Sherlock would not have blamed him. In any case, the intense but brief incident was behind them, and the king seemed eager to disregard it.
Sherlock felt like he had to say more, but it was hard to know what. Maybe he should have brought John along. “I shouldn’t have feared that you were the kind of man I thought you were.”
He ran his hands through Sherlock’s hair, sending ripples of pleasure through the servant that cascaded down his body. The king leaned closer, trapping his humble servant against the bed.
Come now, Mr. Holmes. I admit that you’re a clever fellow, but there must be things you cannot do, that I can help you with.
“Yes, sir. For the horse, one thing means another thing, and that’s that, as you said. I envy such a simple existence.”
Calm down. He’s probably looking for me. Watson could have found your address in my things. He must have told Lestrade where I went.
“You’re perfect, Sherlock. And not just in bed, though I couldn’t have asked for better.” John paused, to appreciate the small giggle from his servant. “Besides, you’re going to be my musician, aren’t you?”
One of the soldiers he had fought alongside now directed a fortress that served as a potential defensive position. The fortress was composed of a castle surrounded by giant walls and towers. Weapons as well as relics from wars in times past were kept in the castle, which had survived through many historic conflicts. There was peace for the moment, so the fortress served mainly as a spot of interest for various visitors. Members of King John’s convoy now counted themselves among that number.
“Oh, Sherlock, I’ll keep saying it to you, I promise.” John took Sherlock into his arms, and let his precious maid cry on his shoulder. “I love you.”
The jousting competition was the last part of the tournament. It was fitting to end the event on a sport that most demonstrated the courage and skill of the knights and members of royalty in the contest. Warriors in full plate armour, each equipped with a lance and shield, faced each other in honourable combat on horses.
“Oh, don’t think it charitable that you should be given new clothes. It is imperative that the attendant of someone in my position should be dressed for the job.”
John was happy to do exactly that, supporting his servant with a firm hand as Sherlock reached the bottom and climbed off the tree.
Sherlock snickered at that, which made John chuckle, too. It seemed that Sherlock was perpetually raising the king’s spirits.
“Very well. I didn’t mean to rush you,” the king said, in his calm, rough voice, which was a captivating sound to Sherlock. “I’m sure they’ll be ready in time for the joust.”
“Can you forgive me, John? You wrote of nothing short of devotion to me. I never knew,” he said, “only imagined. In any case, I have taken you up on your invitation to visit you in the castle.” Sherlock released John slightly, to cup his chin. Their gazes were locked together, and their lips were very close. In a whisper, Sherlock asked, “Is this wrong of me?”
William was disrobing himself now. He was filled with a self-conscious uncertainty and a vulgar thrill at the same time when John’s gaze was upon him. William had not noticed that he was hard with desire until it caught John’s attention. The nobleman worried anxiously about what John would think.
You have been silent for half an hour. It is not like you. Come now, won’t you sit on the bench with me?
“Well,” Sherlock rejoined sharply, “if we’re to discuss psychology, why not look at yours? Let us start with the facts. You refuse to call this man here”—he pointed at me, though I would have much preferred not to become involved—“by his first name, or to share your own. You’re his PA and have obviously been in service all your life—probably military service as well, I observe, from your firm posture and neat appearance.”
Still dressed in his dressing gown, Sherlock took hold of the sponge and soap, kneeling at the side of the bath. “You may call me Sherlock,” he said, his own voice deeper than he would have expected. He was not immune to the sight of John, naked and flushed, in his own bath.
Having been brought by his passionate king to this private room, which contained such an indulgent piece of furniture, Sherlock’s imagination ran wild. He blushed intensely.
Whether or not the king was ready to accept it, there soon came the day when they reached the gates of the city that John hailed from.
“Fine. John told me something recently, something I had never expected to hear him say, and I suspect that you are to blame.” He leaned forward, and his voice dropped a little further. “We start with John,” he said, more quickly. “John has feelings for me, but thinks them unrequited; he hides these feelings in this café; you find him here and keep him company; you share the predicament of your own love interest; John encourages the two of you to confess to each other; you two encourage John to confess his own feelings.”
Sherlock could read the tension in Mycroft’s hunched position easily, but he had no idea how to say something about it. He looked around at the other tavern patrons, wishing that one of the normal people who knew how to talk about things could do this for him.
They finally dressed then, and swiftly prepared their caravan for the next leg of their journey. As the convoy set off, Sherlock settled into his familiar place next to John, who directed the horse.
“Oh,” Sherlock murmured, pleased. The trowel was handed to the king. “Your chivalry is commendable.”
“Tell me.” King John murmured the command softly, though that did nothing to lessen its effect on Sherlock.
“It’s fine,” King John said. “Really, it’s all right. There is some excitement in the tournament.” The strange melancholy remained, though he was forgiving to Sherlock at least. It was more than Sherlock deserved, in the servant’s opinion. “I should be going now. Goodbye, Sherlock.”
With a flourish of his coat, King William left him to head out the room and down the hallway, in the direction of the royal offices and meeting rooms. John went to the castle chapel, the most likely place for one to find Father Lestrade, but the priest was not there.
Oh, God, does that make me even worse? Lord have mercy, your features are handsome indeed. Or, is it because your manner is so pleasing? You’ve got a proper way of talking, of moving, you know? Lord in heaven, I’m digging my own grave now. Oh, what is wrong with me? First a chap I only know through letters, and now a black man too? There is something terribly off with me. Maybe you should report me after all.
“You don’t know what you’re saying. You don’t know how terrible this is of me. You know so little about the world.”
“Thirteen years ago, in fact. Then the first King Holloway was not very happy with how his son performed as ruler during the war, and he still had the power to choose a new sovereign, so he pretty much forced Montgomery to give up his power when the war ended.”
I couldn’t tell if Bertie grasped the extra weight his “sir” got, or if Jeeves himself noticed he was saying the word differently.
After a solid display of collaboration and discussion, John and I had chosen the restaurant for our double date. It was a nice enough place. Not so ritzy that I would be met by any nosy sorts from my social circle who would make a fuss of my eating with Jeeves, nor so pedestrian that any one of us could kid ourselves into thinking this wasn’t a date. A piano on one side and darts on the other, if you follow me. A solid balance of tablecloths and Bermuda shorts in the air. Not that I myself was wearing Bermuda shorts, however spiffing such garments are. They’re simply not the raiment one chooses when one wants to impress Jeeves.
“Be my guest, but… you won’t do anything with what I’ve told you, right? No posting any comments about the lovesick author?”
It is gratifying to hear you say so. I should credit you as well, for coming to my defence when my abilities were questioned.
William was deeply touched. “I merely observed,” he said, though he could not keep his tender feelings out of his voice. “But my dear John, there are some things I do not know.” He pulled the sheer curtain around his bed apart so that he could climb onto it. “Join me?”
“That is better.” Sherlock adjusted the blue scarf around his neck, and visibly relaxed on the pew, though his posture, arms crossed and one leg over the other, still spoke of nobility. Sharp eyes turned to John’s own. “Does your family still give you trouble?” he asked, though his definitive tone seemed to know the answer already.
Jeeves went on, unfazed by this impromptu staring fete. “It would necessitate my resignation from the club should I reveal any sensitive information; however, I am at liberty to observe that your brother and myself share some characteristics—a retiring nature and an inclination towards careful thought, to name but two. One wonders if you have noticed this as well, and this is why you have taken to regarding me with antagonism.”
For several days, John was not able to spend much time with Sherlock. The king had many duties to attend to, and as a new servant, Sherlock also had to learn the customs of the castle.
“I must be wrong. Sherlock should not exist,” Sherlock said ruefully. He pulled John into an embrace. “Do you know how awful it is when I give in to this side of me?”
“He longed to take her deeply,” he whispered. “He put her on her elbows and knees, and he entered her, again and again.” King John’s musky scent seemed stronger now. “He made his beloved scream with pleasure.”
“I wouldn’t say that, sir. But I do find it interesting.” Perhaps Sherlock liked the soft feeling of the painting? That would make sense. John knew very well that Sherlock was soft in many ways.
At the end of the night, when his dear John was sleeping soundly, William knew he was bound to the man whose stomach he was stroking gently. The royal heart in William’s chest could be given to no other. But he could not fail his kingdom either.
“It would be too soon. I don’t intend to wait very long before I do that, though. In the meantime, you are free to look around this room, and my room too, of course. There are other servants outside if you need anything.”
His eyes went wide when he heard himself weep, and he tried to silence himself immediately. It would be terrible if he woke William this way. But loneliness was overwhelming him, making him long so much to be loved by the man in the other bed, and John had to turn his face into his pillow, to muffle his sobs.
Sherlock seemed to accept this, but it wasn’t fair to expect him to truly understand these circumstances. He did not know the burden of expectations that a king was destined to carry. When the time came that John could no longer put off his duties to his lineage and his kingdom, Sherlock would feel betrayed, and would leave John forever.
William should have had Lestrade cast out of his keep for this insolence, and yet the king was the one who was struggling now. “That’s… My advisors do those things. Montgomery was deemed below the affairs of the kingdom long ago.”
King John was silent. Sherlock knew that his master was wise with the experience of an esteemed king who had seen and done much, but perhaps even he did not know what was right, either.
John sat on his blanket, patting the forgotten fabric. He had shared King William’s bed for so many nights that his personal bed was unfamiliar. He wished he could be in his usual place by William’s side. Why did William want to sleep alone today? Perhaps his lord was not in the mood for any intimacy tonight, but didn’t William know that John would be happy just to lie next to his master?
I like to think that I’ve done pretty well for myself, all things considered. A flat share on Baker Street isn’t bad at all, and if it weren’t for Sherlock’s experiments flung about the place, it could even be nice. Sure, there are times when I have to be more aware than usual of how much I’m spending, but I’ve managed to pay my percentage, and I’m proud of the home that I’ve made with Sherlock.
King John was saying words, yet Sherlock hardly comprehended him, so absorbed was he in his own thoughts. It could not be denied that he made a poor servant. Even when his duties were simple, he failed miserably. Sherlock would too easily give in to his boredom and curiosity, and he would sneak into places where he did not belong, or eavesdrop on conversations not meant for his ears.
John was astounded that he had such an effect on his friend, even then. To think that Sherlock loved him… Needing to be as close to William as possible, John flung an arm around him, noticing a surprised little intake of breath when a simple long nightshirt met a stained but still exquisite dressing gown…
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock whined, desperately. The chains rattled once more. “T-To be treated like a treasure… I don’t understand it, sir. I am no treasure.”
Shaking his head and attempting to clear himself of foolish longings, John left, Prince Montgomery marking a string around a sheepish but pleased Father Lestrade behind him.
‘Dear Mr. Holmes, I just had a strange man walk up to me and tell me how a murder was done, knowing nothing but what was published in the newspaper. Also, he’s blind. Does this sound familiar?’
As William was sorting his papers, his day’s work accounted for, he inquired after John’s whereabouts of a maid who was to clean the office. She replied that she had seen John speaking to Father Lestrade in the chapel. Whatever they had discussed, she said, their conversation had been animated indeed.
Sherlock giggled at the unexpected compliment. He stopped himself as soon as he could. “Oh, I’m sorry.”
“That’s right. I told King William that you needed a cross,” John said. “You can keep a secret, too, right? Did you know he likes to carve things out of wood?”
Lestrade nodded. “Of course. Think it over, that’s the proper thing to do. Let me know after services this week.”
Probably without consciously intending to, John looked at William’s arm, where he had been injured those years ago. It was the gaze of a man who wished to soothe and heal. “As m’lord wishes,” John said, his voice matching the comforting power of his eyes.
“Yes, sir.” Sherlock hoped that the king didn’t judge him too severely for not having many fine things to bring.
Like the previous fighter, this one could not match the skill of the experienced king. After a few rounds, John offered the trainee helpful advice, and praise for proper technique. Following this opponent, more proficient soldiers asked for a chance to face the king, and though they provided more of a challenge, it soon became clear that none of them could match John’s skill.
William watched Lestrade’s hands tighten with a tense apprehension, and knew that whatever subject bothered the priest was a very serious one. Certainly the king could spare a little of his time for Lestrade.
“No, m’lord,” John said urgently, hoping to cover up his mistake in calling William by the wrong name a moment ago, “you don’t need to do anything for me. I’m very happy I could help you.”
“‘Just Dance,’ to be precise. Bertie and I are going to play for you and Reggie. Not only that, but we’re going to do splendidly, and we both expect sound kisses afterward. Er, not from both of you. You know what I mean.”
It had been a ridiculous thing for the servant to do in any case. Even if he were a little bit appealing to the unattainable king, Sherlock would have hardly known what to do to satisfy his master. He had no experience of doing anything physically intimate with another person.
Lestrade must have noticed, because his hands rose in supplication. “Look, I know your brother is a sore subject for you, but I must speak to you about him.”
Quickly, William turned back to him, his posture still straight and haughty, though his eyes were bright with overwhelming sympathy. “No, I didn’t mean that.” He gave the toy horse a small smile. “You can play with him all you want.”
Sherlock turned to the sofa. He reached for it, slowly enough so that the king could tell him not to if he was not allowed, and when the king said nothing, Sherlock touched the plush surface of the sofa. It was certainly more comfortable than any bed Sherlock had ever known.
“Oh, uh, King William,” John corrected himself. “You, um, asked me to stay with you, earlier. Could I stay?”
However, in John’s company, Sherlock was not a great king. He could speak freely of his doubts, he could talk about his feelings, and incredibly, he could trust John to keep his confidence. Sherlock didn’t need the trappings of his position, either. There was no need for an ornate headdress. He could leave the crook and flail behind. It would have been absurd to wear the ceremonial false beard around John.
His hand reaching for the doorknob, John stopped when he heard his name called in a captivating voice. It was demanding on the surface, yet the pleading tone was unmistakable.
You would learn Braille for me? You need not, you realise. As far as I’m concerned, you only live with me to keep my brother from trying to meddle further.
With his arms now forced apart, and his hands bound to two corners of the bed, Sherlock, naked, trembling, and blushing like a rose in spring, was exposed before the king. The servant’s gentle eyes met the king’s for a moment, and then Sherlock looked away, his legs twitching timidly. Those elegant legs were slender, like Sherlock’s arms, not built for combat like John’s limbs, but for something tender and graceful, like dancing.
A couple of men employed by the castle came to escort their carriage through the walls and into the regal space, and afterward, to lead John and Father Lestrade into the elegant rooms. John stared at every plush sofa and polished mantle, astounded by the luxury that nobles lived in.
Surely you know that I play the game for the game’s own sake… and perhaps a small reward. I’ll need to borrow this.
“I do not mean to impose,” John said, “but I wonder if you could deduce what I did this day? I mean, can you figure it out?”
It was ridiculously kind for the king to introduce himself in such a humble way, without his title, for the servant’s benefit. It was too kind, in fact. Sherlock could not allow it in good conscience. “King John.”
As a priest of a minor god—Sherlock couldn’t remember which god, not that he cared much—John did not have the prestige held by the clergy of major deities, and certainly John was not close in that respect to the king, who was nothing less than divine, being a child of the sun. However, Sherlock knew nobody who could match the depth of John’s knowledge in healing, and certainly, no being in this world or the underworld could match the healer’s unselfish, determined spirit.
John asked around the residential area of the castle, thinking that perhaps the priest had retired to a room or was giving someone advice. A few people mentioned seeing Lestrade walk down a certain hallway, so John moved in that direction. It was new territory for John, located fairly far away as it was from rooms King William frequented.
Gradually, he felt the tension loosen in Sherlock’s slender legs. The lovely servant’s arms squirmed less and less in their restraints. His hips ceased fidgeting, instead surrendering to the obstinate intrusion of John’s thick length, which pulsed more than ever with a need to complete its purpose.
John noticed that, fortuitously, Sherlock was eyeing the trees a little distance away. It seemed that he also wished to wander through the woods.
These rituals, while intriguing to many, had long ago grown dull to Sherlock. They varied very little from day to day. However, they were much more interesting when conducted in front of John, who was impressed by the speeches that Sherlock had committed to memory, and by the studious eye with which Sherlock judged offerings to the gods.
It was nice to be given some of the wisdom gained from worldly king’s experience. Being a distinguished warrior, King John must have directed many horses in his life. Sherlock couldn’t help but remember his glorious master expertly riding a horse and wielding a lance in the tournament, which seemed so long ago now.
If you told me more, I might be able to help you, and perhaps spare you some wasted effort. You may be placing yourself in a position where you will be disappointed. I still do not know why would wish to see Mr. Holmes, but… you would find his physical appearance unexpected, to say the least.
A single large industrious building had captured Sherlock’s attention. There were many people, mostly women, entering and leaving the warehouse, some of them carrying boxes of supplies or bags of grains.
“Don’t worry about that.” There could be no doubt that John had been physically stirred by sharing this intimacy with Sherlock, yet it was not the most important matter to John at the moment. “I’d rather lie with you like this for a bit longer.”
“I want you to be with me, forever, John.” Sherlock had an urge to reach out and touch John’s face, though the belts prevented it, which only made other urges flourish. “I love you.”
At least his work was done for the day. Now he could return to John, or see his brother, or visit his priest. He certainly did have a few questions for Father Lestrade. In any case, Sherlock was hopeful, a feeling he was feeling alarmingly often as of late. How strange it was to consider that they were all becoming so close.
“Please, Sherlock. Anyone could have read the way you looked at that baby. You were thinking of having children, of course. You were so utterly focused on that infant that you hardly noticed me leave the table you were sitting at. You haven’t been concerned with them before. You aren’t familiar with their sounds. This is a newly awakened interest. Then, it’s not because of… responsibilities you might have gained two years ago,” Mycroft said quietly, and Sherlock did not press on the comment. “The most likely cause was that you are expecting. Am I wrong?”
John felt blessed when Sherlock came, with an instinctive and yet still rather gentle movement, surrendering himself to his king. Energy dissipated from the servant’s body, leaving him helpless and out of breath. His cries softened, and he relaxed on the bed, allowing John to stroke him gently, to guide him through the sensations he felt.
The king left the storage room, leaving Sherlock to finish his work. The silence was lonely. It had always been lonely, and yet Sherlock felt more alone than ever without the presence of that kind, fascinating King John. At least, if the king had stayed, Sherlock might have found some way to make up for his impudence, though it was more likely he would have made more of a fool of himself.
“Sir, I would be pleased to do so. When I said that I missed you, I meant it in many ways.” Sherlock clasped his hands together shyly. “I liked it when you held me in your bed in the caravan, sir.”
Confused, Sherlock nodded nonetheless. There were many questions he wanted to ask, but he was not sure if any of them were allowed to be asked. “Of course, sir,” he murmured.
Moving slowly, so as not to alarm his servant, John, who was still dressed, retrieved the chains that he had discreetly acquired, as well as the jar that he often used with Sherlock.
“Father,” John said, with a compassionate tone, “we wanted to talk to you about something I found in Lord Mycroft’s rooms, while I was cleaning.”
“I was actually countering your first point—I would be delighted to be a teacher for your daughters. But I will never take a wife,” Mycroft cleared his throat, “for much the same reason as you.” He pointedly avoided meeting Sherlock’s gaze, staring instead at the flowers in the garden.
The king lowered his gaze, to where Sherlock sat. “I suppose so.” His eyes didn’t stay long on Sherlock, though, instead wandering back to the fire, to that unknown sadness that seemed to haunt him. “Good night, Sherlock.”
Sherlock was on his hands and knees, in a position he had never assumed for anyone in his life, except for the captivating man who was with him now. Wearing nothing at all, Sherlock was trembling, though not from cold.
John was respectfully quiet, too polite to intrude on a continuing search with even a greeting, until he saw that William was indeed approaching him. “Can I help you, m’lord?”
William chuckled. It was a deep sound, with more rue than mirth. “Last night paled in comparison to what this morning gave to me.” He looked meaningfully at John. “You cannot possibly know how spectacular you are. This country can offer me nothing more beautiful.”
“This tune brings back memories,” John said, not sure if what he was feeling was nostalgia or guilt.
He is a detective, and he will do more for you than anyone else could. Do not underestimate his powers of deduction and observation. He does not see. He
William couldn’t believe what he heard. It took him a remarkably long time to notice his mouth was open in surprise. It snapped shut, only to shout, “Lestrade!”
“Oh, the lances, you asked about the lances,” he said, too quickly, flustered under the steady gaze aimed at him. “No, I have not cleaned them yet. I am sorry, sir. I will clean them soon.”
not hold himself back from doing as he truly desired? Sherlock moaned softly, as affected by the kiss as he was by the desires encouraged by John’s closeness.
Before I could answer, or even look up from my table, a tall man in a crisp black suit was taking the empty seat in front of me.
Stunned by this praise, Sherlock looked at the generous king, and felt great relief when the finger gently touching his face was not pulled away. King John started moving his finger slowly down Sherlock’s cheek, making the servant shiver.
It did not take them much longer to reach the village. The convoy was cheerfully welcomed, particularly after many members of the group purchased goods and rented accommodations for their stay, which would be a couple of days. For a few of them, the library was their final destination, though some newcomers wished to join the convoy from this point, and required time to prepare. For the most part, their group remained unchanged, and only wished to enjoy the advantages of the town’s marketplace and great library before their journey continued.
John swallowed the words of affection he longed to say. He settled for something more suitable. “That’s what I’m here for, m’lord.”
Watson? You want Watson to see us sitting intimately together, to make him jealous? Why, you’ve never asked me to do anything so dangerous, Holmes!
“It looks like an abandoned garden,” John said. “I had no idea this was here.” He had never heard of any kind of garden being kept in this forest. “Now we know why the trowel was around, at least.”
I perceived it when I shook your hand. That must be a grave impediment to competent surgery. Unfortunate, for a surgeon.
I could tell that he could go on like this for a while, so I spoke up. “What’s your first name, Jeeves?”
“It’s a waste of time,” William muttered, his chin held high. “Proper noblemen do not invest their efforts in such mundane tasks.”
John could see the familiar signs of Sherlock’s nervousness. The poor servant was shaking, and he wouldn’t look directly at the king.
“You would not take charity,” William said quietly, in the soft and thoughtful way that reminded John of the Sherlock he had known before.
“Great! That’s great.” I smiled, thrilled that I could do some small thing that might make Bertie happier. I wasn’t sure if Jeeves was as dramatic as some people I could name, but it was fun to imagine how Jeeves would make his feelings known to Bertie, and how happy my friend would be.
“Yes, thank you…” Sherlock closed his eyes, trying to better experience John’s touch inside him. He hated the duties that kept him away from John far too often.
In the dark, Sherlock felt his way back to the sofa, and lied down, hoping he had not bothered his master too greatly. He had been foolish, making such an offer to the king, when undoubtedly the king had his pick of much finer bedmates.
John stepped closer to William, modestly clasping his hands behind his back. “That’s beautiful, sir.”
“Right ho! Sweet beloved,” I proclaimed, hamming it up like there was no tomorrow, “you are the tree from which the fruit of my life hangs, oh dear cherished sweet beloved of mine!”
“Of course not.” It seemed absurd to me that anybody would so private as to keep their first name secret.
Now, I’d like to think that some person in this wide world might not think me an idiot for approaching this man in this particularly familiar way. If I might provide some excuse, I was rather caught up in the moment, and I had spent so much time with John that Sherlock seemed almost like a relation. Besides, I tend to greet everybody like an old friend. Whether or not this is a positive trait is a subject for discussion at some other time.
Apparently the father was also impressed, because he laughed and affectionately tousled the shock of dark hair on top of the baby’s head. One of the father’s friends called him away for a moment, and the woman sat patiently, holding the baby with the practiced care of a woman with other children.
“Why should you want it to be a simple world, Sherlock? I thought you liked how complex everything is. Haven’t you said that all the new and different things you’re seeing on this journey are exciting?”
Soon, William was taken under John’s power as John told him mysteries that engaged his mind. It was incredible to be under John’s influence in such a way. William longed to give himself to his healer. He wanted his storyteller to entrance him with tales of excitement, danger, victory, of all kinds of stories.
“I, um…” John fought a blush. He was so happy to have Sherlock sitting with him, holding his hands. When Sherlock politely took his touch away, John had to fight the urge to reach back for him.
Sherlock was so beautiful when he found wonder in the world, and his joy made the road look more beautiful to John, too. Would John ever cease to be so greatly affected by Sherlock’s excitement? The king supposed, with a full heart and fond smile, that he would see every day as an exciting adventure as long as he was with Sherlock. The pretty servant breathed life into John’s world whenever he gasped with surprise and peered with curiosity at a new discovery.
“No, sir,” John said. He returned to his place by King William’s side. William was looking at him, his hands trembling so much that he placed his carving knife on the table, and John was entranced.
Only then did I remember that my laptop was there, and I saw that I had left my blog on the screen. I had wanted to write my next entry today, in this café.
“I missed this,” Sherlock mumbled. He did not know if it was the right thing to say, but it was true.
Fortunately, Sherlock found the concentration needed to remove the first boot. He set to work on the second one. He didn’t want to answer the question.
Well of course it is obvious, when I elucidate it for you. No doubt you will find this just as obvious: You are holding a cane.
With effort, the uncouth imaginings were put away, but John knew he could only keep them contained for so long.
“If only,” Sherlock mumbled. Slowly, Sherlock had become more self-assured, but still too often, John’s poor servant thought so little of himself.
“Sherlock,” John said, “It’s all right.” Slowly, he settled deep within Sherlock, aching powerfully to enjoy what, indeed, was worthy of a king; however, thinking of Sherlock’s pleasure and comfort, John found it strangely easy to keep himself still, to be steady and firm while the soft body under him and around him trembled.
While he thought of his master, John heard the grand doors of the chapel open and close. Resolving to return his attention to prayer, he ignored the newcomer.
That is not such a great leap. You have been in Afghanistan, after all, and I would suppose that surgeons are in high demand there, given recent events.
Perhaps Sherlock had looked there too long anyway, because John quietly offered an apology, then poured some of the oil onto his hand, and turning his face timidly against the pillow, touched his own rear.
There was another element to the weapons that Sherlock appreciated as well: those who wielded them. He was more than a little intrigued by the warriors themselves, who spent hours honing their skills in combat, who held great strength in their arms, and in their force of will. It was compelling to see experienced fingers neatly pulling an arrow back, or muscles being flexed as a lance was thrown heroically. Thinking of what he had managed to glimpse in the tournament so far, remembering the exhilarating displays of fortitude against ever-stronger opponents and ever-changing challenges, Sherlock felt his heart start to beat a little faster.
John longed to console his master, but he could do nothing other than keep himself from saying anything more that would make William unhappy.
The king smiled, and then blew out the candle, drawing the world into nearly absolute darkness. He guided Sherlock to the built-in bed at the rear of the caravan. It was lovely when the king sat down on the bed with Sherlock, and it was almost unreal when the king guided Sherlock to lie down there.
John turned Sherlock’s face back towards him completely, and saw Sherlock’s eyes sparkling gloriously.
“M-Me?” John stammered. Though his gaze fell down, he could not hide the creeping blush on his cheeks from Sherlock.
“Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.” Again, John’s fingers slid into Sherlock, making him writhe from the pleasant sensations that teased him for what was to come. “You’re so gorgeous. Is this good?”
“You’re so good at this,” the king said softly. “You’re so good at taking my fingers, Sherlock, like you were pulling them in.”
King John was declared the champion of the tournament. This did not come as a surprise to Sherlock, nor was he surprised by the graciousness of the king when he was declared victorious. He honoured those who had faced him in combat; his noble and chivalrous manner only made the crowd adore him even more.
Under the bright benevolence of the king’s smile, Sherlock faltered, though he persevered. “If it’s not too much trouble, sir. What you told me about fermentation from that book in the library was interesting. I’d like to know more about what they do there.”
As he slid a cloth along yet another blade, Sherlock couldn’t help but recall how the king had magnanimously clasped the arm of each of his opponents in the archery contest. This was something Sherlock had seen the king do in the sword-fighting contest, as well, which took place some days after the tests of archery. The king had looked glorious in combat, wearing shining armour and wielding a heavy sword. After the king had knocked his enemy to the ground, he had helped the fallen opponent to his feet, and acknowledged a battle well fought with a nod of his head.
John paused. It was sad to think that William could only be in his true self in this way. “Yes, and, really,” it felt more appropriate to say these things to someone who was not his master, “he has been very kind.”
He went to the chest at the foot of the smaller bed he no longer used, in order to store his new clothes with the rest of his belongings. When he opened the chest, a small toy that had been in his possession for years caught his eye. It was a little wooden horse with a rocking base.
John spent the rest of the day following the snobby servant around. He saw many other splendid rooms, especially ones he was likely to work in, such as His Majesty’s offices, the vast meeting and dining area known as the great hall, the private sitting room used for smaller gatherings, the kitchen and its many smaller rooms, and finally the chapel. Though he was able to see a familiar face in Father Lestrade, which was a heartening sight, the pews reminded John too much of a certain scarf-wearing man.
“Well, Sherlock! I’ll be blown,” I said, cheerfully marching up to the fellow. “Are you here with John?”
“Damn, you feel so good.” It was incredible when John thrust into Sherlock again, and then another time. His husband—how wonderful, that John was now his husband!—had used oil very thoroughly in preparing Sherlock, so every movement was easy and exhilarating.
They were discussing trade in the region, though the other nobles sounded far more engrossed in the topic than King John did. In fact, there was a notable apathy in the king’s voice that reminded Sherlock of those times when unhappy moods had come over the king.
“Hmm? Oh,” Father Lestrade said, noticeably dazed, “only the Lord ever knows what he’s actually up to. Now, we have a wedding to get to, don’t we? It’s time we get moving.”
“My country,” John said thoughtfully. He had always felt that his family thought him foolish for volunteering for the war.
Sherlock’s mind stumbled to a halt when he saw, at last, the face of the king. He had a strong jaw, and rough-looking brown stubble. It was at the moment when Sherlock’s gaze met steady, sparkling eyes that there was another loud clang.
Very good, Doctor. If you continue at this rate, perhaps you will one day discover which part of the body is responsible for sight.
John held Sherlock and murmured softly to him as the beautiful servant finished in the king’s grip. There was a raging ache in his own trousers, but John did not want to bother with that now. He simply wanted to hold Sherlock.
“Sherlock,” John murmured, his voice low and fond. Strong hands grasped Sherlock’s hips with a firmness that was absolutely perfect. John’s hold on Sherlock was comforting and affectionate as he plunged into Sherlock, filling him with ecstasy with every passionate thrust.
I imagine she’d lament over her misfortune. How pitiful it must be to have been cursed with us. One blind as a mole, the other with skin of the wrong colour!
Though he appeared to be a little embarrassed, Sherlock smiled, which made John feel buoyantly light inside. “Thank you, sir.”
“Of course I’ll catch you,” John answered. He hardly needed to be reminded to stay close by, and he certainly couldn’t take his eyes off his beautiful servant.
When Sherlock stared with curiosity at the mash being poured into the barrel and pressed, John found himself fascinated as well. Never before had the production of apple cider been so interesting.
John’s reaction was wonderful. He stilled for a moment and then found his euphoria, trembling and then relaxing in Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock still held him, quietly bringing himself off as he admired his beloved.
Lestrade clasped his shoulder, with sympathetic concern. “You weren’t gone long. Everything all right, King William?”
There were muffled sounds of activity from outside the caravan. The group was supposed to leave soon, and the rest of the convoy was starting to pack up. John did not have very much time to satisfy his servant. Indeed, they were still both dressed for sleep, Sherlock in his gown and bonnet, and John in his loose shirt and trousers.
The king rubbed Sherlock’s back. It was fortunate that his master was so strong and self-reliant that he could manage with such an insufficient servant.
I smiled at the compliment, and then exclaimed, “Oh, I just remembered! You play the violin, don’t you? If only we had one here, would could make this a proper show.”
He felt a bit of a jolt from his servant, but John knew that Sherlock became jumpy at times and didn’t think too much about it; he was able to soothe Sherlock with his hands sliding over Sherlock’s chest, which made Sherlock relax and smile again.
Looking directly at his mirror image, Sherlock saw the colour of his skin, which was always too white, no matter how much time he spent outside. The contrast against his dark hair made his skin look even whiter. His fair complexion made him look delicate, and fragile. This was, again, sadly indicative of Sherlock himself.
Sherlock was truly such an enthusiastic, pretty maid. He served John so well. The king couldn’t last long at all.
“The stork, as I said,” Sherlock answered. He wasn’t sure if he should be more specific than that. He had appropriated Lestrade for the task, but Lestrade had somehow, apparently, become Mycroft’s servant.
That certainly sounded remarkable, but William knew that if he allowed John to stay and fascinate him any longer, then the temptation to sit companionably with his servant in this courtyard for the rest of the day would become too great. “I shall enjoy hearing of it some other time.”
When William returned to his castle, in his formally guised self, he was surprised to find Lestrade waiting for him, outside of the king’s private quarters. The priest had lived in hiding before, but now without being sought he appeared.
Yet they didn’t make it very far before Sherlock suddenly stopped in his tracks, leaned against a tree, and started crying.
Was Sherlock offering to hire John, as a servant perhaps? John steeled himself against the idea; he could not be dependent on someone who was so close to his heart. “Sherlock…”
King John was moaning deeply, and his musky, captivating scent was filling Sherlock’s mind. It would have been fantastic to have the chance to admire the king without his shirt when he was like this, but it was still incredible to see the power of his naked legs and hips. He found his smooth rhythm, making use of Sherlock’s hands with all the self-assurance that came with strength and authority. It was mesmerising to watch and feel this handsome man give in to his urges, so much so that he forgot how truly unsuitable the servant under him was.
“Well, sir, they were talking about you. Nothing bad—they merely wondered if the king would be settling down in the castle very soon, for good this time.” Sherlock’s voice became softer. “They thought that you might miss your queen, and would spend some time with her.”
One of the servants nodded to the priest. “Father,” he said familiarly. “Is this King William’s new valet?”
William grinned. “Your shoes confirmed that the rushes and coriander were used in an herbal capacity, and that you did not merely come across them in a garden, otherwise there would be much more dirt and mud present. There was a similar dearth of clues on your arm. I would see a great deal of evidence there if you had actually assisted in a childbirth, which told me that your patient is still expecting.”
It would have been nice if the king had not accomplished the task so swiftly, or else Sherlock might have been able to better watch how the fine fabric of the king’s tunic clung to the powerful bulges of his arms as he seized and carried the heavy weight.
“You don’t believe in accepting charity of any kind. Why would you believe this is charity?” William sat up straight, and extended his arm further to help in John’s task. “You see me as I am, a ruler above all other men,” he stated haughtily. “I don’t employ you out of generosity. You are a healer, and a soldier. You are useful, that is all.”
John tasted wonderful. Reluctantly, William pulled away, taking a few breaths to become reacquainted with air. John did the same, smiling in such a grateful way that William longed to take him to bed at once.
If Mycroft was amused by Sherlock’s unpredictable moods, he didn’t show it. “Although, if you want the total truth, I should say that, in a sense, he is generally the one shagging me.”
Sherlock bravely nodded. “I would, um, I would like to serve you in every way possible, sir. I thought about it while I was in the library, too. I want to give you a child.”
John undressed himself completely, and directed Sherlock to take off only his socks and underclothing. Sherlock was adorably shy as John guided him to lie down on the bed still wearing his maid’s clothing. It looked so lovely on Sherlock.
Sherlock finished playing, and bowed when John gave him applause. Holding the violin under his arm, Sherlock moved back to the case.
“It is more than the stories,” Sherlock said. “I want to know about how you feel. I wondered that every time I saw you in the church. I wanted to know about everything that was important to you. I wanted to help you.”
“Did you really intend to start your prayers without my astute commentary?” Sherlock asked, with a playful smile. A nobleman eccentric enough to spend his time among the lower rungs of society, the tall figure was nonetheless dressed in fine clothes and carried himself with an elegant bearing.
William did not see why this was so important, but he nodded. He sat in his chair, directed Lestrade to take the other seat next to him, and waited.
“I had supposed it was because of my past confessions.” Sherlock kissed John on the cheek, which had the joyous effect of making John blush happily. “Long ago, I confessed to him that I had fallen in love with another man in the war.” Fondly, Sherlock tapped a finger on John’s chest.
“I’ve got you,” John said softly, drawing Sherlock from his hazy dream. The servant was gently moving Sherlock’s hand away and replacing the touch with his own, encouraging the king’s hips to push freely into the grasp that was offered.
Bertie was tapping rapidly away at his mobile, which I didn’t think he was holding a moment ago. “Ah, found it! It looks like I could be either best man or man of honour, or simply honour attendant.” He returned his mobile to his pocket, and crossed his arms thoughtfully. “Interesting how much there is to know about weddings.”
Before Sherlock could do anything to undo the barriers that William had created, he had to know that a better man than himself supported him. John must have been kept long, because he returned late and exhausted to the king’s bedroom, so Sherlock did not bother him then. The king was content to pull back the covers and welcome his servant into his sheets. John, normally so modest, was in such need of rest that he lied down immediately, and gave little more than a soft, wordless murmur of contentment when Sherlock moved closer to him, with an arm over John’s side.
Keeping his voice humble and not impertinent, John dared, “You did enjoy it, though? Uh, last evening more than this morning, no doubt.”
Once he was inside the warm tavern, Sherlock loosened his blue scarf and claimed a small table in the corner. A young boy and his older brother had sat in this spot long ago, one excitedly deducing the history of each bar patron, the other quietly sipping his common ale with an amused smile.
Surrounded by thyme, rosemary, and the warmth of his servant, Sherlock could do nothing but cry out his beloved’s name and think of all the times he had rested under John’s attentive care while the sweet man told him stories.
Sherlock felt more relief than he had expected, though he would not let his guard down entirely. He nodded, and gestured towards the other seat at the table in invitation. Mycroft nodded as well and took the seat.
“And I would have told you to quiet your voice, as I must tell you do so now,” Mycroft said, sympathetically. “I am sorry, Sherlock, but these are secrets we must keep. It is what’s proper.”
I expected Bertie to get that the issue was about what I had just asked. In fact, I was hoping for it, since I admittedly didn’t know how to bring it up myself.
“Yes, sir, but they should know better. There are times when I’ve eavesdropped on others for no better reason than I was bored. Invariably, it gets me in trouble.”
Right now, for instance, hours before their wedding, John was clearly perturbed, shifting between his feet, fiddling with the veil Mycroft had given him.
Just as John had said, there was the feeling that what they had just done was meaningful. John felt it, and he was certain that Sherlock, who breathed more evenly and tipped his head back, his mouth open in bliss, felt it also.
Mycroft? I wonder if he is right. Did Lestrade have doubts after all? He seemed quite interested, but then, so did Watson, and now he is anything but. Have I miscalculated?
Sherlock thought that perhaps the king wanted some time to himself. He hadn’t directed Sherlock to follow him, after all. Unfortunately, sitting outside became so much less pleasant with his master gone. The stars seemed to become duller, and the air became colder. The fire was not as fascinating as it had been before. The other members of their convoy, who sat around their own fires and talked of nothing interesting, seemed more remote, somehow.
Once they were in the room they shared, Sherlock undressed John, placing all the items that covered his John to the side, since they would no longer be needed. He noticed John breathing faster as the last raiment was pulled down and allowed to be taken away. As he had imagined, John was indeed blushing. The king’s handsome attendant was naked, a dream to behold.
John’s back arched and he made a little cry. “Sherlock!” The servant’s hands, perhaps too bashful to do much else, grasped Sherlock’s arm helplessly. “God, yes, please!”
There were some parties held to celebrate the king’s victory and return. He was not able to avoid these festivities, nor was he able to bring his servant along to any of them. Sherlock probably would have been even more bored than John if he had gone, in any case.
“John is good like that. I glanced at your blog, by the way. Your Jeeves, he seems clever enough, if rather preoccupied with the abstract. We’d get along either very well or very poorly I think, and perhaps someday we will find out which one. But not today.” Sherlock stood up from his chair. “Must be going; date with John. Let me say that again—date with John. Charming phrase. Has a nice sound.”
Among the wide variety of skilled soldiers present in the tournament were members of royalty, including kings who had earned honours in battle. It was one of these kings, a handsome man with light-coloured hair and broad shoulders, who had caught Sherlock’s eye, ever since the servant had sneaked away from his boring duties to watch one of the exciting rounds of the archery competition. In that event, archers managed brilliant shots, one after another, competing against the shots of their opponents. The king had matched the efforts of the most renowned bowman in the country, and certainly defeated the other archers he competed against, none of whom were novices.
In this garden with his servant, John didn’t want to think about politics, though. For the time being, they were free to enjoy the flowers and trees around them.
Soon, the king started removing his own shirt. Though Sherlock was feverishly eager to see more, he also wanted to hear more. His master’s voice was so striking and reassuring. At last, he concentrated long enough to say something coherent.
Every inch of the caravan spoke of its occupant’s prestige. The interior of the caravan boasted lavish tapestries and carved details accented with gold. There was a long built-in sofa on the side, cabinets, a wardrobe, a chest of drawers that was also a table, and at the rear of the caravan, a built-in bed, which spanned from one side of the large caravan to the other. From where he stood, Sherlock could see the excellent curtains that covered the side window, as well as those over another small window at the rear, above the bed. Everything in the caravan was made from the finest material.
The longer that John worked in the castle, the more of his day was spent at William’s side. In the beginning, William had secluded himself in his office when work was to be done, but he came to allow John to sit by him, and sometimes he would speak to his servant about the decisions being made for the country.
“They’d love to look at you, but they could only look, because I wouldn’t let a single one of them near you.” He guided Sherlock’s knees apart, so that he could clearly see what waited for him between Sherlock’s legs. The beauty of what was before him made John’s heart pound. “They can’t touch what’s worthy of a king.”
Still holding the cross closely, John humbly guided his lord to a bench, where they sat down together.
Submissively, John sat on his knees, keeping his hands behind his back, possibly to keep from touching himself. “Whatever you like, sir.”
I tapped the button for the doorbell and waited, bouncing on my feet once or twice as I wondered what Bertie’s flat would look like.
John had to admit to himself that he also enjoyed the view of Sherlock from the ground. His pretty servant was wearing simple clothes, but these could do little to disguise his ethereal beauty. Sherlock’s pale skin shined elegantly against his dark, curly hair, which bobbed playfully as Sherlock moved around the bark, extending his slender arms to reach branches of the tree.
Sherlock would never become accustomed to the blossoming warmth that John instilled in his heart. “Do you know that I love you as you are, John?” He carefully started to push into John.
Sherlock nudged closer, and carefully leaned on John’s shoulder, slowly resting his weight on the king’s arm.
Sherlock did not want to cause John distress, but he had to find out what the matter was. “The name I was given was William Holloway, and it’s what the people call me. What I choose to call myself is Sherlock Holmes, and you are one of the few who may call me that. Would you please exercise your right?” He reached to touch John’s shoulder. John did not push him away. “You may give me any title you wish, but right now, can you call me Sherlock?”
“I will have to make an address or two for the city,” John said, “and speak with my advisors. I’ve been gone for a while, and there will be a lot for me to catch up on.”
The church bells tolled a slow, distinct six. It was evening, and only one man was inside, seated solemnly on the foremost pew. John, his head down and his hands clasped, was not a wealthy man, but he was a proud one, and it was a rare time in his life that he came to God in need. Murmuring the few prayers he remembered from childhood, John hoped that the words would bring order to his life, which had been torn by the dramatic conflicts of a three-year war and by the private turmoil of his family.
To be near the king was so thrilling that it took a regrettably long time for Sherlock to regain his presence of mind. “Your Majesty,” he said at last, rising from the bench and bowing his head. “Can I help you?”
No. I was… asking to be sociable. There isn’t enough time for decent politeness in the Yard, that’s what I say.
King John growled; the low, powerful pitch had a profound effect on the servant. He took Sherlock in his arms and kissed him again, deeply. Sherlock moaned, loving every moment of it.
Sherlock picked up a small object from the ground, shook the thing to free it of some dirt, and presented it to John. It was a small, dull, curved blade of metal with a curved neck that was attached to a wooden handle.
“I don’t care if it’s wrong!” Sherlock cried, desperate. He sobbed into his pillow and clutched it fiercely. “P-Please, sir! I’m yours! Please!”
I hardly think so. I have observed that Watson has at least a small inclination of the inverted kind, and is trying to suppress it—or I am wrong, and he has nothing of the kind, but he is a sympathetic man all the same, and has seen much more scandalous things in our line of confidential work.
“Where is it that you’ll be acquiring a baby from, brother mine?” Mycroft inquired. “I couldn’t help but notice from our cursory inspection of the city’s populace that people seem rather attached to their brood. They will not simply give one to you.”
“I have a vital request for Lestrade,” William said. “I am going to ask him to give our baby to us.”
“I give you a few things, maybe. I provide a little company, and some… physical diversion, though I am inexperienced in bed.”
William nudged John’s legs to part slightly, and then thrust between John’s thighs. John gasped, and closed his eyes peacefully, ready to be of service by being a toy that William rubbed himself against, but that was not exactly what William had in mind. He positioned himself so that he would slide against a very taut, sensitive part of his servant’s warm anatomy, drinking in John’s beautiful whimpers as he did.
He went through the rest of the event as quickly as possible. All he wished for was to be alone with John.
Sherlock relished the feeling of the king’s fingers freely preparing him, but soon the king was finished, and he took his hand back.
John wanted to stay on the driver’s seat of the caravan, and linger in this little home where he had come to know his gentle servant, his greatest treasure, for as long as possible. At least his servant seemed fascinated by the city and the interest of the people in their king, so that helped John come to terms with reaching the end of this journey.
John wasn’t sure what to make of that. “King Holloway’s castle?” King William Holloway was their monarch, who had been ruling for two years.
“No more secrets,” Mycroft said. He looked younger somehow, Sherlock thought, as if they had stepped back in time. “Well, Sherlock, this is the truth. I am, as you say, shagging your priest.”
“Here, would you like to hold her?” The woman stood up, and was placing the baby in Sherlock’s arms before the gentleman knew what was happening. “Oh, look at that, you’re a natural.”
Bertie softly added, “John, old fruit, I like the attitude, and that’s a fact, but it’s nothing doing. Jeeves won’t be comfortable being something other than PA around here, and that’s all there is to it.”
“You need a pair of non-appalling boots, shorter ones. A sturdy cap and a small cloak, for the colder months. Make the arrangements, Lestrade. Earthy hues, if you please.”
Hearing such sincere praise from his beloved, Sherlock felt like he was flying, a sensation that mixed beautifully with the heat that surged all through his body and spirit. Sherlock was rarely affected by praise anymore; many people gave it too freely to Sherlock, such that their words were worth little. Whenever John praised him, though, every word sunk deep to Sherlock’s heart, the seat of his soul.
Many loved to gossip about the affairs of rulers, but John had never been interested in that talk. “Not really. Well, it seems reasonable that the first brother abdicated. He must have been tired of it. He’d ruled through a war, after all.”
“Indeed, the social order is as strict in the underworld as it is here,” Sherlock said, “if not more so. Because of what I am, I will have to rule the place. Oh, I can think of nothing more boring, John!” Frustrated, Sherlock shut his eyes. “You know what heaven is made of, don’t you? Nothing but fields of reeds! Unchanging and eternal and utterly tiresome!” He opened his eyes, and saw the compassionate gaze of his cherished husband looking back at him. “But I would tolerate it, John, if I had could share a field with you, and we could grow crops together, or whatever it is the ordinary people do in the underworld, but that is not what gods do in heaven.”
Continuing to hold Sherlock’s wrist, the king guided his timid, acquiescent servant back onto the bed.
Even if his charming, brilliant Sherlock was in reality a conceited ruler, John still found himself feeling happy and relieved that it was Sherlock whom he served. The apothecary's son would never have agreed to be the servant of someone who was so dear to him, since he had learned not to rely on the kindness of others, so in a way, Sherlock’s cold manner made this acceptable, believable.
When John’s trousers were opened, and the sweet man pleaded for Sherlock’s love, the king continued his path, sheltering John lovingly and warmly in his throat. It was pure pleasure to hear John’s cries grow louder, just as it was deeply soothing to witness John shiver from ecstasy in the intimate sanctuary of their shared home.
John wasn’t sure how far up his master’s leg he was permitted or expected to clean, but the temptation was immense. As respectfully as he could, he carefully glided the sponge past William’s knee and just up his thigh, into the water.
John inhaled sharply, stunned that the man he had longed for, one who was so far above his own place in life, would say those words. He must be wrong about what was being offered. Could William only mean for them to sleep side-by-side? “What do you mean?”
“Oh, Sherlock.” Cradling the back of Sherlock’s head, the king moved in closer, and at last, his lips met Sherlock’s.
A shiver passed through William, but it was only of excited, buoyant sentiment. How exciting it was to think of his kind John this way. Could John wish to take on such a role with him?
I refused payment. I realised long ago that I did not want to be your nurse. I want to be your partner. Ahem, I mean, your assistant.
A charming pink blush flourished on his pretty servant’s face. “Then I would like to stay here and watch, sir.”
Reaching for some of his clothes, John said, “I love you, Sherlock. I won’t be able to say it very often outside of this caravan, so I want you to remember that.”
Pardon me, Mr. Holmes. I do not mean to startle you, but I don’t think you heard me knocking. Your landlady was kind enough to see me in.
You’re a bohemian chap, aren't you, Holmes. Doctor Watson described you as something of the kind, and he was right. Of course you don’t give one whit about decency.
Sherlock felt an embarrassing rush of heat in his stomach. The fact that it was so easy to take his servant to bed did little to soothe his guilt. “I only mean to talk to you.” He held one of John’s hands between his own. “As marvellous as it is to have you in my bed, I have always enjoyed simply talking to you.”
That unselfish, determined spirit was now making love to the pharaoh, reducing him to little more than whimpers and moans of pleasure.
“I know it’s not proper of me, in any sense,” Lestrade admitted. “I hope you can still allow me to be your chaplain.”
“Relax, Sherlock.” John could not say in good conscience that he was in love with his servant, but at least he could make him feel pleasant things.
With a frustrated sigh, Sherlock shook his head again. These distracting thoughts were not helping him finish his task any faster. Trying very hard to concentrate on his duty, he oiled the sword that he was holding, which would keep the blade in good condition.
John repeated the process with Sherlock’s other wrist, smiling sweetly. His eyes were dark, but even powerful, passionate emotions seemed fond and tender when they came from Sherlock’s attentive servant. John moved to the side of the bed, picking up both of the bottles Sherlock had gifted to him. “Do I really get to marry you?” he whispered.
Was Sherlock allowed to be with John in such an intimate way? Could he give John all his love, and receive whatever John gave to him? Could he be with John as an equal?
The thought was a painful one. He wanted Sherlock to be his, for as long as Sherlock would allow it.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose, those he was not particularly surprised. “Ah, how could I ever doubt that you had changed for the better?”
William’s eyes fluttered closed. He tipped his head slightly back, leaning into John’s touch. “The trained hands of an apothecary,” he murmured. William now allowed the servant to fully support his master’s weight. “The strong arms of a soldier. You are magnificent, John.”
Sherlock chuckled. The thought of pristine, placid Mycroft looking for a loud, dirty baby was entertaining. “We’ll find some other way.”
Sturdy arms, thick neck, strong shoulders… do people take you to be my partner, Watson, or my bodyguard?
“There’s nothing to be sorry for, Jeeves. I knew that I’d be putting you in a devil of a position if I asked you out. I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable—the last thing any right-minded Bertram would dream of doing. We can drop this whole thing if that’d be better. Back to the simple employer-and-employee wheeze, if you’d be more comfortable that way.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” John murmured. “I love you so much.” He leaned down, kissing Sherlock’s hips and stomach, enjoying how this added to the gorgeous sounds that Sherlock made. “I want you to be mine. Are you mine, Sherlock?”
There was nobody else present in the courtyard. Had there been anyone, William would have dismissed them without a care for explanation. He loved to be alone with John. He could give his servant all his attention. William eased John’s hands away from the line and into his own grasp, appreciating the startled breath that escaped his servant.
It was too bad John had not known that earlier, or maybe he would have been presentable enough to accompany King William. He could hope for the next time, though. “Thank you, Father.”
There was some more movement, and then King John made a small grunt. Sherlock tilted up his head, and was given the opportunity to watch King John coat himself with the contents of his jar. It was an entrancing sight. Sherlock’s experience of intimacy was certainly limited, but he could not doubt that his master was a specimen of rare splendour. Surely, he could not look at the king like this, magnificent as he coated his thick length with firm, confident hands, and be surprised that this was a man of power and influence.
Sheepishly, John turned to Sherlock. “I should have left what I found alone. I was just worried for Father Lestrade. I underestimated your brother, too.”
I’d never seen Jeeves so tremendously overcome with embarrassment and joy that he burst out laughing, nor had I considered it possible, but there it was, by Jove, and I laughed too.
Sherlock was delighted that he was able to read some of these books. It was true that he did not know every single word, but he generally understood their meaning, especially with the aid of the illustrations.
There was also a separate room nearby for Sherlock, if he wanted it. A much humbler room, the place had been used by the king’s previous maid. She hadn’t been the cherished, beloved kind of maid that Sherlock was to John. She had simply cleaned and cooked and so forth.
“That’s enough, Lestrade!” Sherlock didn’t care to use the man’s title at this point; he just needed Lestrade out of the room. “We’re finished here!”
“No, sir!” Jeeves’s sharp cry took me by surprise, and Bertie nearly jumped out of his chair. “I do love you, sir.”
“I want to bring you off, and hear the music you make while you give yourself to me.” The king’s hand idly stroked Sherlock’s knee. “Do I have your permission?”
“I think it’s a fantastic trait. Why shouldn’t you be brilliant? A brilliant servant for a brilliant king, right?”
For a moment, Sherlock only blinked at John. Then, in a perplexed tone, he said, “I must admit, sir, it’s a surprise to hear you say that. The common kind of music is surely not the noble kind, sir, not the kind with hours of instruction and study. Not to mention, the superior instruments used by the noblest of musicians are very different from those of the common people, are they not?”
With an obvious sense of wonderment, Sherlock leaned in closer, and actually took a whiff of John’s ache. Sherlock let the brown hair in that sensitive area rub against his cheek, and hummed in a charming, inquisitive manner. “You smell nice, sir,” Sherlock said.
In times past, the king had thought he wasn’t meant for a happy life. Even before his marriage had shattered, he had never been really content. His queen, a lady with a noble lineage, had been a socially appropriate match, yet the two of them had not been well suited to each other. There were times when John considered that he had failed to make the relationship work, but he was certain now that there had been no chance of that.
