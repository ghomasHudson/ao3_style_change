serious about it. You noticed the outline of a badge in his pocket.
/////sorry it took sooooo long, but I was having a writer's block... /////
-----time skip brought to you by my personal hate of moving-----
You slowly opened your eyes. You felt your hear being supported by a soft pillow. The world was still blurry, but things were slowly becoming sharp again. You tried to sit up, but there was a sharp pain in your head, so you let you head fall back onto the pillow.
"Someone wants to meet you..." She said a bit threatening. You decided to go with her not to cause any trouble. Also you were curious who this 'someone' was, so you got into the car...
You ended up walking for a few minutes (you were too tensed to time it). 'Anthea' took a left and you followed. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw a tall man waiting for you. He was wearing a black suit, which you could see he had tailored specially for today, and a red tie with a pattern. He was very intimidating. 'Anthea' walked towards the stranger and whispered something in his ear, afterwards she continued to walk past him and walked away. You were alone now (not that 'Anthea' was on your side). The man looked like he thought he was the king. He was leaning on a black umbrella with a wooden handle. Some of his facial features seemed familiar, but because of your fright you skipped the thought. He had a pocket watch, of around 65 years old in his vest pocket, you guessed a family treasure. His hair was turning slightly grey, but he'd been using hair-dye to cover it up. You noticed that he cut his nails and had a thin layer of transparent nailpolish on them (you smiled in your head). You also saw that he'd try to remove crumbs of donuts of his suit, but they were still slightly visible. He didn't want people to know, so you guessed he'd been dieting. You looked at his eyes and noticed that he was watching you do your deduction. He was a bit surprised, but hid it well.
John walked into the room and you hid the letter behind your back. You wanted to sort this one out on your own, and you feared that you might bring Sherlock and John into danger if you involved them in this.
You quickly and silently put your phone away and glanced at 'Anthea' to see if she noticed. Her face was still locked on her phone screen, so you thought she didn't notice... After another 11.32 minutes of silence the car stopped. The driver got out and opened the door for the two of you. You stepped out.
That was all it said. The letter was written with red ink, by a male who cared about having a nice handwriting (maybe gay?). You froze. The ‘M’ was written with blood, B+ to be exact.
"I'm just organizing my stuff." you said, wondering what you were doing wrong.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade, to your service" he said, smiling. your guess was correct,
"That's a shame, I was hoping it'd work this time." he mumbled the last bit. "I guess Sherlock attracts loyal ones."
"Graham Lestrade?" you asked, because you had heard Sherlock call him that.
------ time skip brought to you by me being very lazy------
Today, you had gone to the mall to get some more seasonal clothes, when you heard a loud 'BANG'. You looked to the direction of the sound, and your curious side got the better of you. You walked towards where the sound came from, and found a narrower and darker ally. You shivered, scared of what might be hiding in the dark, but you were still very curious. You slowly padded into the alley and continued your little 'adventure'. Following the path though the alley, you turned left, and that was when you saw him. In the middle of the path stood a man. It appeared as if he had been waiting for you, and your heartbeat was rising. The man was wearing a black suit and a black tie with little white marks. He had short, black-brown hair and very intimating eyes, which had an evil shine. He took a step towards you, and you stepped backwards. You now noticed that the white marks on his tie were little skulls. He smiled evilly and your stomach lurched. He took another step towards your direction, and you took one away from him. He just laughed. You were visibly shaking now.
Now... where were we? Oh yes! You'd just stepped into a strange black car of which you assumed it was owned by a secret organisation. Today had been a VERY weird day, but surprisingly you quite enjoyed it. You looked to your right, and saw 'Anthea', or whatever she calls herself, texting someone. You tried to read the conversation, but the only thing you could read (without 'Anthea' noticing) was that the person she was texting stood in her contacts as 'M'. You knew for sure that she wasn't texting her mother... Because she wasn't paying a lot of attention to you, you reached for your phone to text Sherlock (who, gave you his number, sweet right?) and texted the following:
You needed an excuse for coming with them, because you knew it would be a lot more interesting than shopping!
“It’s not like I deliberately ruined my own shirt, so I think you should apologize even if you think it’s not 'your fault'.” You said.
"I will in a minute."
"You can sleep in my bed." your jaw dropped. you weren't expecting that (maybe you were hoping it).
"Yeah!" You said happily. "I will forgive you for the accident, IF I can come." you said with a devilish grin on your face.
"For what it's worth, I like Greg way better than Graham." You said, giving Sherlock a teasing wink. John had been silently enjoying watching the three of you and you saw that he could nearly contain himself when you winked at Sherlock, because his reaction was priceless. He had rolled his eyes so dramatically and looked like a enormous drama queen. Even Lestrade couldn't keep a straight face.
“Fine. As long as you don’t mess with the evidence.” Sherlock said
You froze, "He's not-" you began, but you knew 'Anthea' wouldn't care and arguing with your kidnapper might not be such a good idea. She wasn't even listening and had already started walking, so you took a deep breath and started following her.
, you thought to yourself, grinning silently. Sherlock looked very confused of your laughter, which obviously only made you laugh more
"Would you like to help us solve crimes?" Your heart almost exploded of happiness! Finally something interesting and fun in life! Something you were good at. You looked at John for his approval. He was still a bit stunned but pulled himself together and silently nodded at you.
“Can I come? I do really want to find out what a ‘consulting detective’ is exactly.” You said, hoping you could come. John seemed to like the idea, but Sherlock was doubting.
"No." you said, no amount of money could make you work with this guy.
////I'm so sorry that this is a short chapter, but you got two chapters at the same time (kinda) so I hope it's okay :D
After talking some more about Mycroft and the relationship between Sherlock and his brother, you decided it was time to get your suitcase and finally move in. You told the boys you were going to get your stuff and John offered to help you. Sherlock just went on with staring at his microscope and you decided not to put any energy into trying to get him to be a better person. As you and John sat in the cab, he told you about how Sherlock and him first met. You smiled though the entire story, they really were a perfect team. The two of you talked about many things, like him being an army doctor, about your childhood. You were really bonding and John really understood you. You even discussed getting friendship bracelets as a joke. Among many things, you mostly spoke about Sherlock. Even about how the two of you were going to prank him on April Fools.
Not really surprised, you found yourself standing in an abandoned parking garage. 'Anthea' gave you a blank stare and said, "Follow me, and don't even think about texting your boyfriend again, there's no signal here."
You thought. Standing next to him was a shorter guy, who looked sweeter and softer, wearing ordinary jeans and a grey-ish sweater. He looked nice.
“Come on Sherlock, it’ll be fun! And you have to make up for ruining her clothes.” John said, looking up to Sherlock.
“(Y/N)” you said, taking his hand.
[Y/L/N] = your last name
[Y/N] = your name
You noticed he had a firm handshake, which proved your conclusion; he served in the army, probably as a doctor. He hadn't been back for very long. You noticed that ‘Sherlock’ sighed as you introduced yourself and gave him an angry stare which he pretended not to notice. He was behaving like a jerk so you decided to give him a piece of your mind.
"What kind of deal?" you were curious and forgot your fear for a moment.
"Yes, obviously, you'd need your stuff. Toothbrush, clothes, books, whatever you need in life." He said, as if we were really stupid and missing the point (which we were).
"You scared us there." You heard Sherlock say from the other room. He popped his hear around the corner and smiled. A happy smile. You loved it when he smiled, and right now he looked genuinely happy. You returned a faint smile and tried to say something, but all that came out was a weak "Hi..."
"Sherlock, you have to stop taking people to crime scenes! Last time that guy puked over the evidence and I'm still blaming you for that." He said. You were fighting the urge to laugh, but his strict face made clear that he was
// sorry this was short, but I'm going to write another chapter today. also sorry for not writing in a few months, I was very busy and completely forgot that this existed.... woops//
"Sherlock, what are you talking about?" John asked.
"Sure." Sherlock said, you could see that he was eager to see how little you would find. You crouched next to the body, absorbing every detail. You did the same for the knife and walked back to your audience. You stopped in front of Sherlock, waiting for him to ask you about it.
Lestrade was the first one to pull himself together. "Sherlock, John, Miss. [Y/L/N], can you please look at the body?" He said, you were flattered by the way that he used your last name. The world's only consulting detective, John and You walked to the scene, as Lestrade held up the police tape. You were greeted by the sight of a body and a pool of blood,
"But, you can't just give your room away!" you said, confused by the situation.
You arrived at the apartment, where Sherlock had already turned the couch into a comfortable bed. You didn't mind sleeping on the couch, it was so soft and nice. As you dropped your pyjamas on the couch, Sherlock said, "What are you doing?" in an irritated tone.
[Y/L/N] = your last name
"I'm going to sleep on the couch."
"His name's Mycroft?” you laughed “Their parents have a great taste in names." you said, sarcastically. Sherlock gave you a death stare and John silently laughed, hoping Sherlock wouldn't notice, but he did. Sherlock gave John an even madder death stare. You held up your hand and gave John a high five. Mrs. Hudson smiled and left the three of you alone to talk about Mycroft. You thought the name quite suited him.
You chuckled.
As you stood on the street, ready to hail a cab, a black car stopped in front of you. A girl in a black dress got out and walked towards you.
"Alright, pack your stuff and meet us at 221B Baker Street." Sherlock said. John furrowed his brow and looked at Sherlock.
/////hahahaha cliffhanger (sorry) I'm still working on ch 4 and I didn't want to leave you guys waiting for ch 3, so I decided to make a cliffhanger (*evil laugh*) okay bye////
-----time skip brought to you by Sherlock's lack of people skills-----
"Information, nothing you'd be uncomfortable with, just what they're up to."
After exactly 7.47 minutes of silence the taxi stopped and Sherlock, John and you got out. The cold London air made you shiver. You walked towards the scene and were greeted by a man who didn't look that happy to see you. You estimated he was in his fifties, judging by his eyes, wrinkles and posture. He had short, grey hair and a slightly irritated look on his face.
"It's a surprise, you can see it when it's done."
“Yes, thank you.” You said and hold out your hand for him to shake. “I’m (Y/N), but I’m guessing you already picked that up from my conversation with John.” You said, still waiting for him to shake your hand. He considered for a second, but then shook your hand. He had big hands, which were slightly warm and very soft.
"Are you ready to go?" John asked.
"She'd have to move in with us, obviously. It would be nonsense to drive from her place to ours 3 times a day." Sherlock said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
"Hello, I'm Anthea, I need you to come with me." She said. You noticed in the way she said 'Anthea' that it wasn't her real name.
"And why would I do that?" You asked, trying to look a bit tough.
"What are you talking about?"
"If she really wants to come..." John said, looking at you.
/// I hope you like it so far..///
“I’m sorry for my friend, he can be such an arse sometimes.” He said, smiling
When the ride came to an end you walked into your apartment to get your suitcase, but was surprised by the sight of a letter on your pillow.
Credit to one of my best friends, Kim, for the idea that I should make it 92,8% instead of 92%, because it’s Sherlock-ish.
“Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and yes, I did.” He said, trying to sound cool while saying his name.
“My name is John by the way, nice to meet you.” He said, still smiling. He held his hand out for you to shake.
"I asked you a question," You said, trying to be tough "answer it." The man raised his eyebrows.
“Well if you think it’s so important who is to blame, I’m sorry, but it’s no reason to behave like a huge jerk!” you snapped at ‘Sherlock’ about his comment earlier.
"Oh god, there's two of them." Lestrade said, a tad frightened. You couldn't resist and started laughing.
"What's happened?" you asked, hoping he wouldn't tell you that you were not supposed to move in.
"Can I see it?"
[Y/N] = your name
"Good afternoon..." He said, as he grabbed a black, leather covered notebook from his breast-pocket "Miss [Y/F/N]" he said, finishing his sentence.
"You met Mycroft?" she asked, surprised by the news.
= what you think
His voice made you shiver and you were sure that he was going to harm you, so you decided to make a run for it. You sprinted away, adrenaline making you faster than you ever thought possible. You glanced over your shoulder, and noticed that the mysterious man hadn't chased you. You ran back to the flat and some people had looked at you weirdly. When you reached the door, you were out of breath and felt like coughing up your lungs. You vision started to get blurry and the world slowly turned black. The last thing you were aware of, was the feeling of your body hitting the cold, hard ground.
“Fine. I’m sorry. Are you satisfied now?” he said, sarcastically. You tried your best not to laugh at his tone.
What happens after your deductions...
"I thought you'd never ask." You said, with a smirk on your face. Through all this happiness you hadn't noticed that Lestrade had walked away. You saw him standing a few meters away, talking on the phone. He ended the call and walked towards the three of you.
“And I notice you said the Morrisons didn’t deserve what I did to them.  But you didn’t say anything about the Rockinghams.”
Saturday morning dawned a perfect autumn day: the sky was nearly cloudless and a deep, vibrant blue; the leaves were sparkling in the sun; the air was crisp but not yet uncomfortably cold.  John woke early and watched the sunlight play over the angles of Sherlock’s sleeping face.

“John.”  Sherlock somehow moved even closer, as close as he could be without actually touching.  “What if I
Back to the suspect.  Sherlock had held back, not wanting to accost him while he was so close to the kitchen door.  If he bolted, better that he make for the backstage door where John was waiting.
“Sherlock…”  John took a deep breath.  “William Sherlock Scott Holmes.  Will you marry me?”
“That’s rough, man.”
John tried to appear distracted, glancing at his phone, hoping she would assume he hadn’t heard her.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and jerked his head at the door.  John glanced through just in time to see a young man dressed in a purple-and-silver version of the same outfit delivering a tray of mini cheesecakes to the nearest table.  As he set it down, he deliberately knocked a spare serviette from the table.  It fluttered to the ground a couple of feet away.
John swiveled, glancing behind him to find the man with the Kermit-the-frog t-shirt, and then back around, eyes searching the corners.  His gaze froze on the one at the angle that would put the muppet-shirted man behind him to the viewer, and gave it a pointed grimace while lifting a middle finger in its direction.
“A toast to exes staying far away!”  Owen held up his glass and Lestrade clinked it with a grin.  Owen chugged the rest of the pint while Lestrade glared at his for being empty.”
I don’t know when he’s let me get out a speech that
“Okay, okay. So they deserved it, and you know how much I enjoyed laughing about it after they left.  I was also quite happy they left before pudding; all those strawberry tarts I had to eat before they went stale,”  Siger admitted with a boyish grin.  “But you can’t do something that cruel to people just for being rather dull.”

“Alright, but only if they’re very,
Laurina and Charles looked slightly confused just for a moment before they understood. “Oh...OH.”
“Yeah! Did you see that goal in the second half that…”
I had to shoot someone’?”  Lee tossed in, to nods of agreement from Paul and Marc.
“Come on, man, or we’re all going to send you cds of show tunes for Christmas.” John found a napkin to wad up and throw at the offender.
“I didn’t want to disturb Mrs Hudson by going down to the basement at midnight to reset it.”
“So, Charles, what field were you in before your retirement?”
Nice hot microwaved chicken korma would make up for it all, just a bit.

think we should move it up to tonight.  Sherlock’s tracked his movements and he won’t be alone until 3 am at least, and probably not until tomorrow.  And tomorrow night’s our best shot of catching him with as few people around as possible.”
long without correcting me on something.
After a sip, Violet continued, “Sherlock is a detective..consulting detective, he calls it.  Part of the time he works with Greg on cases with Scotland Yard, and part of the time he takes on private cases.  He’s become quite well known over the past few years, especially with the popularity of John’s blog.”
“Oh!  Thank you!  If anyone can sort out what happened there, it would be…”
John was a bit surprised to be the second to arrive, after Paul, who had staked out a large corner booth.
The bus was crowded and humid, causing that awful wintertime situation of being both overheated and sweaty from being pressed against so many people while wearing a coat and scarf but also being hit with a frigid draft every time the door opened.
“Yes.”

“God no.  You should see our flat, you’d never ask again.  Let’s see...we’ve got a yellow spray paint smiley face, bullet holes, and a cluedo board pinned to the wall with a dagger in our sitting room.  Oh, and a cow skull wearing headphones over the fireplace.  We’re the last homosexual couple you should be asking decorating advice from.  Our landlady comes up to tut at least once a week.”
“Mmm….fuck.  Gonna come love.  Oooh, yes…”
Violet sniffed. “I insisted, after everything was all over, on being introduced to a few of their friends just so that they could see we are not
“Yes, me.  I could have solved this case without the undercover work.  I chose to wear this costume because I wanted proof of what I had suspected.”
Two days later, as they were walking from the scene of a murder-for-life-insurance-payout to that-Korean-place-with-that-thing-I-liked-that-we-went-to-after-that-case-you-know-the-one-with-the-girl, John noticed a small jewellery shop on the corner as they waited at the zebra crossing.  The wedding sets glinted in the afternoon sunlight.
The bell announcing his arrival tinkled over the shop door.
By the time John finally hit save on the notes he had submitted to the clinic’s patient database it was a good forty-five minutes past the time he was scheduled to leave.  Mrs Johnson had turned out to have a large rash spreading from rather sensitive areas of the body; nothing terribly unusual about that, but she’d tried several home remedies to treat it herself over the course of several weeks.  The unfortunate woman had no talent at all for such things, and her sister-in-law’s recipes had caused an allergic reaction on top of the original fungal infection, and the whole lot by now had a decidedly less than pleasant smell.
The crowd he had glimpsed as they snuck in seemed to be mostly older ladies; he could see that Mrs Hudson’s book club would fit in just fine.
“I’ve got to check out this blog.”

“Last time I had to shoot someone in front of witnesses, Greg didn’t speak to me for a month!”
Heeey, mates!  This is Paul Robson, your old flanker!  I hope you still remember me, it’s been so long, ha ha!
John might not be eating lunch today.  Or ever again.
“Oh, yes, thank you.  They’re quite lovely.  Siger, dear, more for you…?”
“What else do we have in?”
“So, basically, you’re a part-time James Bond.”
The sombre mood was broken as soon as they saw the scene of the abduction.
John took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders.
But..he didn’t want to just
“Okay, well maybe we
It actually took thirty-seven minutes for them to arrive at the crime scene, but the only thing the yarders noticed was that they seemed to be in entirely too good of moods for a stabbing that was beginning to smell.  Meh, those two were always a bit weird, really.
“Oh, you’re digging yourself in deep, Watson.  So there are other ASBOs you need to tell us about?”
“Always...a soldier...what did he…how did you...”
One lazy Wednesday afternoon, they were snogging on the couch, and John had just managed to get Sherlock’s shirt off and his own trousers unbuttoned when Sherlock’s phone buzzed.
Sherlock scooped up the phone.
“I didn’t see
I see any sign of an abduction, I’ll look into it.”
“Research, John.  I need to go out again.”
“You left out the part about the ASBO!  Come on, Johnny!”

Sherlock squeezed.

John, being both early to arrive and, after years of criminals, preferring to have his back to the wall, was crammed into the middle of the corner booth. The waitress had barely set down the first pint for Tony, the last to arrive, when John’s phone rang.
“Ah, Mycroft.  I was expecting your call.”  Honestly, John was surprised it had taken this long for Mycroft to stick his nose in.  He leaned against the rail to finish the call before going down into the tube station.
Sherlock nodded with a little laugh and squeezed John’s hand tighter.
“Oh!  The ring.  I just bought wedding rings; I don’t know if you want to wait until we’re married to wear it, but I have yours here and I’d rather like to see it on you.”
The narrow alley was now strewn with splattered Italian food (how did he get it all the way up there?), an umbrella mangled beyond all belief, one sock with a hole in it, scattered rumpled post-it notes, a toothbrush, and the skip, which had clearly been shoved a foot further down the alley than it normally sat and boasted a new dent.
Mycroft only responded by rolling his eyes.  “Good day, John.”
“Nonsense; if she were only friendly towards you for the sake of dormitory harmony, she wouldn’t have invited you home for Easter that time, or stuck up for you when that ratfink Bobby was sneering about…”
John rolled his eyes and huffed.  Well.  He’d wondered why Mrs Hudson and her friends had been so keen on what sounded like an overly-sweet bit of fluff.  Treacle and the

A quick glance: Mycroft.  Really?  He knows where I’m at.  I mentioned it when he was at the flat sneering at Sherlock yesterday, and a Holmes never forgets anything.  This better not be a last minute attempt to get Sherlock involved in the Greek Ambassador scandal. Wanker.
Oh.  Well, at least I know.
not be something you’d think of with a man.
“Oh, John.  He hasn’t said anything, but I see the way he looks at you.  I think that he’s still so surprised to have what you two have now that he hasn’t dared hope for more.”
“May I bring more punch for you, ladies?  Oh, dear, I’ve dropped your...”  He slowly bent to retrieve it, giving a nice long view of a well-muscled backside as the diaphanous tunic rode up.  The ladies tittered and he gave a cheeky grin as he placed it back on the table and proceeded to take a count of additional punch glasses needed.
“Wait, Jimmy!  Hold up!”  Jimmy paused holding the open taxi door.
And everyone, John included, snorted and cracked up laughing.  Rajesh had tears in his eyes, and Tony nearly fell off his chair.
Laurina nodded quickly, with tears in her eyes at the thought of not hearing from a child for so long.  She got a bit antsy after a fortnight without a chat.
“Wow, man.  I had no idea.”
“What?  Really?  How could you possibly...there must be a hundred Italian places in London; surely Angelo’s…”

Well, at least he didn’t reject the
Forty-five minutes and two elbows to Sherlock’s rib cage later, they finally caught a cab back to Baker Street.
John glanced around a bit frantically.  No way to take the call privately without making three people get up and move to let him out.  Besides, Mycroft’s calls were usually short and to the point.  He thought about just not answering, but there was always that niggling fear:
“Yes…”
“Alright, what did you do?”  Better to hear the worst now.
“Christ, Sherlock, what
I had a time getting this many emails, and I know I’m missing some people so forward this to anyone whose info you have!   And let me know if you can come out to play! ;)
Now, as they walked around the to the alley, John shivered a bit as they passed right by the window that he’d once destroyed with a bullet.  It could have all been over then…  Sherlock didn’t say anything, but he stepped a bit closer and reached down to squeeze John’s hand.
John nodded to an empty room as Sherlock darted back down the stairs.  He typed the name of the shop into a Google search before he could forget it and didn’t bother to waste any mental energy wondering what Sherlock had planned for tomorrow.
“Mycroft, what’s the person behind me wearing?”
“We...” John swallowed thickly. “We know what it’s like to not have each other, or to not have each other completely, and now that I have you, I don’t ever want to not have you again.”
John opened the door and almost slammed it shut again.
The sounds of bickering, one voice condescending and one voice snarky, met John halfway up the seventeen steps he was trudging up after a long day at the clinic. Mycroft. Lovely.  He winced and considered turning around and going to sit on a bench at the park for a while, but he really was tired and was at the point of needing tea so badly that he was willing to brave even a Holmes Brothers argument.
John overheard a lady at the nearest table as they went through the door.  “Margie, you should have waited on

Sherlock quirked an eyebrow.

(nevermind that it wasn’t “blokes”, plural, just this one rather unusual one).  Or maybe they would react with hostility.  He wanted to think the best of them all, but it had been years since he’d seen some of them;

What if he said no?  It wasn’t like they’d have to break up if he did; they could just stay the same as now and the same was wonderful.  John was self-aware enough, however, to realize that even though it wouldn’t change anything, hearing no would hurt.
“Go on then, no bother,” from Kevin, and nods from a couple of others.  Kevin turned to ask Jimmy if his cute little sister was still single, but before he could open his mouth, his attention was diverted back to John’s phone call as soon as he heard the rather non-standard greeting:

have repeated that experiment inadvertently.”
John looked up into his eyes, and without breaking eye contact, lowered himself down on one knee.  Sherlock gave a little choked noise.
“I love you, too, Sherlock.  So much.”
“Mm?”
.  I’m not that daft.”  Silly boy; could it be any more obvious?  “Don’t worry!  I’m not going to tell him.  I wouldn’t spoil your surprise!”
“Yeah, man!  Hey, wait, let’s get another round real quick…”  Even the flurry of activity in acquiring eight more pints didn’t distract his curious audience.  John downed about half of his.
John finished his tea as a fresh squabble broke out over Sherlock showing up for the planned family dinner (which he knew that Sherlock already planned to attend; after all, he’d had John call Mummy to confirm the plans--he was just feigning reluctance to wind Mycroft up).
John took pictures of the scattered objects and peered into the skip to see the carrier bags with odd bits of medical tubing and syringe bits that John had procured from the clinic.
“Why are you…”
“No, no, no.  No crying.  He’ll know!  I don’t know if we
.  I love you enough to change
By the time he made it to the sitting room, Sherlock was tapping away furiously on his laptop.  John automatically headed toward the kettle to start tea before remembering that he was sloshing already and changing course to flop into his chair.  He’d barely settled in before Sherlock was dumping the laptop (of course he’d been using John’s) on his lap.
“Jessica was so much fun when we were dating.  But bam, put a ring on her finger, and the inner witch came out, you know what I mean?”
“Sherlock!”  Molly squealed.
“Oh, come here.  Stop hopping!  Let me see.”
“Then I heard him say, ‘Oh, you again?  I left it at the restaurant.  Teddy, I’ve got to go.”  And then he hung up.
Roland-Kerr College of Further Education looked a bit different in the light of day.  It hardly seemed like the sort of place for an encounter with a serial killer.  Until he’d come scouting about for possible locations for a fake crime scene, John had not been back since the night he shot the cabbie.  The what-ifs had made him stop and lean on the corner of the building to just reminisce a moment.  He had felt so alive that night, running and chasing with Sherlock, facing down danger with a gun, laughing at the ridiculous fortunes in the fortune cookies at the Chinese restaurant...he should have realized then that he’d always want that mad genius in his life.
“Yes, I have sufficient ammunition.”
“Case?”
“Fuck off, Mycroft.”

John didn’t finish the sentence as the phone call ended abruptly.
“Of course.  I’ve got some ideas already!”

“Mycroft, what’s the person behind me wearing?”
By the time the Saturday night in question rolled around, John had put quite a lot of thought into how his old friends would react when they found out he was in a relationship with another man, since they would all remember his flirtatious-with-the-ladies reputation.  He wasn’t really that worried about outright hostility; it was 2017, after all, and any sane person knew it just wasn’t done to make homophobic slurs, especially when you weren’t sure of your audience--but then again, they’d probably assume it was an all-straight, macho-rugby-player audience (not that that made saying rude things right, but the beer might remove some filters).  Surely they were all sufficiently modern-minded enough to not start a brawl or ask him to leave, but there could be plenty of more subtle reactions that would lead to the same end: the uncomfortable silences, the assumption that he no longer shared their interests in sports and beer, the looking back mentally to wonder if he’d ever looked at
Thankfully, John had the perfect way to keep Sherlock from bringing up the conversation once they were alone.  As soon as the door shut behind them, he grabbed both of Sherlock’s hands, placed them on his own crotch, and began enthusiastically rubbing himself against them.
Sherlock snuggled deeper into the sheet and grunted.  It sounded like a positive grunt, though, so John just rolled his eyes and got up.  “I’ll wake you when it’s ready.”
“...uh, bit, ahem, sore from what we, um, did this afternoon.”

As the pleasantly crisp air of autumn gave way to a damp bitterness towards the end of November, the clinic where John still worked part-time got busier and busier, although not more interesting, as the increase was mostly cases of the sniffles and flu.
Okay.  John wiped his hands on his jeans.

Sherlock put down the violin.  He was trying to hide how pleased he was; probably a bit not good to be smug about one’s lover’s pain.
“And who wouldn’t be?” Violet smiled.

John grinned. “Oh god.  I thought you were going to come out with the old ‘so who’s the girl in the relationship’ question.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him and muttered something about phrases used by idiots in school.  John didn’t care.
John and Carl both spoke at once.  John nodded at Carl to go ahead.

For the next four days, John spent every moment he wasn’t in the same room as Sherlock, including while Mrs Hattersley gave a full account of her considerable history with bunions, considering his options and working himself into a snarl of doubt.

Sherlock’s expression changed, and he almost looked…contrite.
“Oh, stuff it.  I’m going to have a few pints now, you’re going to fuck off.”
“You be careful getting home!  My bus nearly got in a dust-up over on Helton!”
“Wait, wait...I just made the connection.  I knew the name Sherlock sounded familiar--such a distinctive name.  I remember reading about him in the papers a few years back.  I had thought he had died, but then there were reports of him being alive after all…” Charles looked more interested in the conversation now.
“Awful woman! The trouble she…”
Sherlock kissed the two fingers still on his lips.  John grinned.
A week later, John, Sherlock, Lestrade, and two of Lestrade’s sergeants, Owen and Carl, were crammed into a booth at the pub.  Sherlock still didn’t join in “that pedestrian pastime of the masses who insist on using alcohol to depress even further the meagre brain function they possess” very often, but he did give in occasionally these days.  He said it was to observe the behavioural patterns of the inebriated, but really was more to do with the big-sad-puppy-eyes expression that John was quite masterful at.

There was a moment in which John gazed up without breathing and Sherlock blinked down at him without breathing before John felt himself being yanked to his feet and kissed even more breathless.  When he finally was able to pull back, he just looked at the face of the most beautiful man he’d ever seen for a moment.

“Ladies and Gentlemen, “ Sherlock addressed the astonished crowd, “this Tart has been quite naughty this Christmas.  If you have donated to the Bears for St. Bart’s Children’s fund, it is a scam, and you should contact New Scotland Yard to file a complaint.”  And with that, he turned with a flourish that lacked some of its usual flair without the Belstaff and grabbed the scammer’s other arm to help John drag the squirming and protesting man off stage.
He takes up position outside the bathroom door and makes sympathetic noises until John tells him to fuck off.
“Y’make a good nurse,” John slurs.
Sherlock can scarcely believe it, but it appears that despite the initial setbacks, his plan has begun to work, to wit he has a pink-cheeked, panting John Watson in his arms, so close, in fact, that he can feel the thump of his heart against his solar plexus. Thinking that this is about as much as he could have hoped for by this point, Sherlock is proved wrong when John's eyes stray from his own and down to settle on his mouth. In a very promising unconscious gesture, John's tongue slips out to wet his own lips and Sherlock's brain is filled with what could be an angel choir singing of joy - or more likely anoxia from hyperventilating.
"Quite recently." Sherlock's gaze is unnervingly direct; John recognises the expression from when Sherlock is waiting for him to catch up on a case. Sherlock can never just give a straight yes or no, he always wants John to work things out for himself from the spoon-fed facts he has been given. This is exactly the same - a tiny bit excited and impatient, but trying not to show it.
“I didn’t know what I stood to gain, then,” John protests, taking a bite of biscuit and popping the rest into Sherlock's obediently opened mouth.  “Plus you had a great little flat and I didn’t want to get chucked out so soon.”
Crispian needs the shower turning on. Then he needs help pulling his shirt off his arms. Then the socks off his feet. But when he claims that he can't shimmy his jeans and underwear down without John's help, Sherlock intervenes.
Still alive!
His mind is a mess; circling around and around.
Sherlock’s eyes flared open, his pupils blown wide and cheeks already pinking up.
He doesn’t know how long he stands and breathes in the palpable peace of the garden and lets it fill him.
He glances at his watch again and tips his head to see as far as he can along Baker Street. The eerie silence of the world being fundamentally changed outside is only matched by the quiet of the flat and the way the snow flurries ebb and flow, one second almost pretty in the sodium glow and then so thick that John struggles to see the opposite side of the street.
John sits up and sighs. “Tell me this. You refused a speech therapist and you won’t see that neuropsychologist they recommended. From your scans and your diagnosis profile you… there’s no reason for… You ought to be making more progress with your speech by now. Mycroft told me about when you were a child, um––”

It is done.

would but..."
"Yeah, one lucky bugger."
Those curls, matted with blood (
"How is work?" Sherlock asks; like a drowning man, he flails for anything that might give him a chance for another breath.
Something about John had made him rethink all those years of solitude and denial. An army veteran with a limp, an attitude and a love of risky situations had effectively broken down every one of Sherlock’s arguments against romantic entanglement and given him much more than he’d imagined was his due.
John breathes in sharply through his nose and swallows. Apparently the words are as hard to hear as they are to speak.
"If you'd be so kind, Mycroft," Sherlock says quietly. John has never heard him speak so civilly to his brother and can't drag his eyes away from him to look at their apparent celebrant.
"Perhaps not, but I know adoration when I see it."
Sherlock eyes him carefully, then returns his attention to the phone. His gaze hardens and his thumb flies over the keyboard for a moment before he sets the phone aside.
“But not the rain, I expect,” Carla added.
So, while toiling to regain mastery of his own physiology, brain and otherwise, Sherlock is silently mourning the loss of an imaginary lover, whose doppelganger haunts his room, day in, day out.
John is only alone for a moment before Molly spots him and comes over.
John nods to himself and considers that they will get along admirably, him and this antisocial neighbour. In fact he feels ashamed for being the first one to give in to social niceties. Yes, they can ignore each other quite adequately.
With his back to the door, Sherlock finds himself edging away until he's far enough from John's gravity. He turns, his coat flicking out dramatically in his haste to leave. He doesn't look back for fear of what he might see, or what he might do on seeing it.
His cousin beams like an imbecile, as if he has won a prize of some sort.
. If you’d had… feelings… for me, before Moriarty…”
“We should get you to bed, John.” Sherlock offers, but it’s obvious that John has come to the end of the active part of his inebriation and is entering the snoring and out-like-a-light stages.
Judging by John’s words and body language, that desire seems to be mutual. They are undoubtedly both broken, but they fit together to make something better than they can become alone. John Watson might have the potential to reduce Sherlock to his lowest point, but he also has the ability to help him fly. Sherlock would rather try to fly than accept another fall.
John tips his chin up and purses his lips. Mycroft has outstayed his welcome, such as it was. And now he is stepping dangerously close to the limits of John’s patience.
Sherlock fell apart instantly. His rhythm gone, he jerked and clenched around John. His back described a perfect arc and his arms braced on John’s knees, he shuddered through an orgasm that seemed to roll through him for long minutes, striping John’s jumper with come, leaving him speechless and as boneless as a rag-doll.
This is a surprisingly jolly gathering, Sherlock thinks. Even John, who has been increasingly taciturn as December has relentlessly forged on, is relaxed and smiling more than he has all week. He had theorised that John was nervous about reconciling with Mary – and he still thinks he’s correct on that but he may have made a miscalculation as to why.
John has never been the subject of such scrutiny before, and he’s hardly shy about his body or nudity per se, but already Sherlock has derailed John’s plans for slow and steady. Even here, in bed, Sherlock’s precocious intellect is pushing boundaries and chasing answers.

that John has considered what they could be.  For every nervous gesture of denial that John makes, his body makes a dozen more that tell of attraction; little things that John doesn't even realise he does.
John is determined not to give Mycroft the satisfaction of a reaction to that obvious trigger, so he simply smiles and raises an eyebrow.
"Only if you get that spatter of ejaculate out of your hair," Sherlock offers with a chuckle and John hears the door close behind him. He stares in the mirror, finds and deals with the spots of come in his hair (his
“Hmm,” Sherlock offers in a manner that he hopes conveys that no points are in need of ironing – in, out or otherwise. “But in principle…”
“What?”
Now he knows that he’d simply swapped one danger for another, and he feels like a fool. With Sherlock back in his life, he’s remembered why no one else could ever compare.
"And as to whether
John doesn't even notice when Sherlock stands and makes his way to where his violin case is standing open ready for him to reach in and take his instrument. It's familiar and grounding, and Sherlock derives a stability he badly needs in the simple act of tightening his bow and fitting his hand to the neck of his violin. Composing himself as best he can, he comes to stand beside his brother. He asks for an A, so he can check he's in tune. Mycroft obliges and Sherlock softly echoes it, adjusting minutely until he's pitch perfect. He nods shortly to Mycroft who plays the opening chords.
Sherlock takes a glass and watches as John splashes a short measure into both. He still won’t meet Sherlock’s eye, but there is an undoubted sense of purpose in what he’s doing. The kiss might have been a surprise, but Sherlock knows in this act John is stalling for the time he needs to order his thoughts and he is more than happy to play along if the alternative is pretending it never happened.
So here we are at the final chapter. I have to say thank you again to J.Baillier who was my harbour in a storm. Hey! J! I wrote another weather reference - what do I win??? And thank you to Agirlsname and to 88thParallel who were kind enough to listen to me moan about this story for months!
John Watson before – never stopped to look beyond his deductions about the man and understand what they mean. Sherlock has been observing John for some time now and has an excellent and extensive list of John’s physical characteristics down to and including the chicken pox scar he has on his left ankle, but the mental landscape of the man remains largely unexplored.
"Come and sit," Mummy insists, beaming, and John does without question, making it too difficult for Sherlock to drag him away before food is placed in front of them both. John sets to, while Sherlock picks at his own plate. Tea is drunk, the party is discussed and it's all horrifically dull. The only highlight is that Crispian is much less chatty this morning.
Sherlock swallows down whatever it is he was going to say. John recognises one of his boyfriend’s rambling speeches for what it is… uncertainty, deflection and nervousness.
"What makes you think that?" John presses and can't stop the grin that is breaking out across his face.
Sherlock's head whips up so fast he feels something pop in his neck.
“Come on, you beautiful creature. Come on,” John breathed.
They struggle to the end of the verse, but John’s attention is divided between the sour notes and his knife sharp awareness of Sherlock’s sparseness pressed all down the right side of his body. Submitting his own jerky efforts to the smooth action of Sherlock’s bowing, he feels a jolt of connection that has nothing to do with playfulness. He knows the second that Sherlock stops watching his fingers and turns his head into John’s hair from the trickle of warm breath that touches his scalp.
“You’ve had a card from some of the guys from New Scotland Yard. It has hedgehogs on it.”
"... stole my laptop. I just found it in my laundry pile and kept it. I meant to return it, but I kept forgetting..."
“So…wait a minute, if there isn’t a case…”
“I’m not going anywhere, but I’m going to move my hand for a moment, alright?”
“You don’t wish to engage in coitus with me?” Sherlock asks, slightly baffled and with a sinking feeling.
Instinctively, he runs his hands over Sherlock’s skull but finds nothing but thick, slightly greasy curls. He realises with detached interest that his fingers are searching for a skull fracture that isn’t there. That never was. Yet that knowledge doesn’t seem to be enough to stop him from checking for a pulse at Sherlock’s throat and whether his pupils are reacting normally to light.
John is usually very aware of Mrs H living below them - it must be hard for her, and he and Sherlock should really be paying her a lot more than they are for the kind of crap that they put her through on a weekly basis. Today, however, John couldn't care less if he's stomping and shouting. He's bloody cross and it has to come out somewhere. He's sick of doing angry laps of Regent's Park - it's become such a predictable episode that the homeless who haunt those paths know him by name and wave to him as he goes by.
John watches with rising alarm as more and more boxes and arrangements are carried through, creating a small garden of white and yellow and silver around Hugh’s feet.
Frustrated at the lack of data, Sherlock turns his attention to the second present that Mrs H has deposited in his lap. It’s a tin of some description, with something dry and loose inside it, going by the weight distribution. He is pleased to find a large tin of Fortnum and Mason’s Royal Blend tea – one of their favourites due to its intense flavour and strong honey aftertaste.
, but Sherlock must have picked it up for whatever reason. John checks, but there is nothing more on the paper.
“I’m sorry,” he says finally. “I have made you feel uncomfortable and put something on you that you didn’t ask for. I should not have let myself get so pissed that I was unable to keep my big mouth shut and put you in the awkward position of having to hear that. It’s my issue, my fault, not yours.”
"You look so beautiful like that," John murmurs, not really expecting Sherlock to hear. But Sherlock seems to understand and he plants one foot on the bed, giving himself the leverage to push his hips up into his hand. He's really giving himself over to the feel of it now and even in the dim light, he can see the flush rise on Sherlock's cheeks and neck.
Jim Moriarty had been more gifted than Sherlock had realised, and he had seen and named things about him that Sherlock hadn’t even understood about himself. He’d known where to aim when the time had come to act. Sherlock is quite glad in many ways that he won’t have the memory of John Watson in a waistcoat made of Semtex. The nightmares he has started to have are more than enough without the added element of actual recall.
The Manoir itself finally comes into view as he rounds a small copse of trees and John is no architecture buff, but it is a very handsome building. It’s clearly old and built of buff stone with tall windows all painted in a chalky grey. The second floor has Juliet balcony railings to cover the bottom half of each window and there are smaller windows built under dormers into the roof.   A second range of buildings stands to one side of the main house that look as if they may have been agricultural in use - they have the gentle effect of enclosing the space and making it feel protected. The drive curves all the way up to the front of the property and there’s a lawn with modest topiary bushes. There are no coats of arms, no sweeping flights of steps; it’s not a  chateau with turrets and a moat which is what John was partially expecting. Although undoubtedly expensive and ancient, it looks almost homely in the bright spring sunshine.
. But every time, you’ve forgiven me. You’ve let me come back and you..."
His veins seem to be full of bubbles, numb and tingling at the same time. They start in the base of his skull and trill down his spine, and out to his fingers and toes. He has to keep reminding himself to breathe and isn’t quite sure where his stomach is currently, as it began tumbling when John said ‘because I love you most’, and hasn’t stopped yet.
John nods, swallowing carefully around a suspiciously thick throat. "What did you have in mind?"
“Your army colleagues, John. Try and focus, for goodness sake.”
John seems to realise who he’s talking to suddenly, and he looks embarrassed and guilty. “It’s a once in a lifetime thing. And even if things change or you move on, it doesn’t change how you feel about that person. You only get one, whether you end up spending your life with them or not.”
Restful sounds like exactly what John is looking for.
– a clean slate, let him off the hook, bury the hatchet, turn a blind eye to, forgive and forget… oh dear god, he’s lost his ability to think in any form approaching rationality… look the other way, turn the other cheek, kiss and make up… ah! No, sadly the last one is unlikely.
Sherlock bundles back into the room then, his face still thunderous until he sees John already sitting on one of the beds.
defiling, John and while evidence of my own digression is currently making a mess of the uniform of Her Majesty’s finest, to say nothing of our sheets, I can’t help but notice that you have yet  to keep up your end of the bargain.”
John almost swallows his tongue. He doesn't know whether to laugh or whimper.
God! He doesn’t even
This is the chapter where the story gets its E rating - you can skip it if that's not your bag - I think you've got the picture.
Sherlock looks up and John gestures towards him with a half smile of his own. Ah, so he is to be written out of the scene - his face clearly does not fit in the perfect, picture book life that John now has.
“Oh!”
>>>>><<<<<
Sherlock is all elbows and knees as he maneuvers himself under the covers and lies down next to John. They both blow out their candles and John waits for his eyes to get used to the dark.
As usual, Mycroft leaves out as much as he tells in John’s opinion. It’s one of the things about him that makes John want to shake him, and it seems to be a Holmes talent. John firmly squashes down the horror he will feel if he thinks too long about having scraped out, ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,’ on a violin that Stradivarius himself may have touched and decides that he needs to have that moment without Sherlock’s bloody brother watching him.
Sherlock tilts the screen and moves to lay on his bed, his head propped on his palm, his body turned toward the phone.
John is solid against him, strong and certain. Sherlock tries not to, but he cannot help but note that John is becoming aroused by their closeness, the hot thickness of him burning through the fabric of their clothing to brand Sherlock’s thigh. He smells so good that Sherlock’s mouth waters and he dives in deep when John’s lips part, trusting that he will catch him.
John scrapes a smile from somewhere; there and then gone. "I know you're not a fan of therapy, Sherlock and that's fine. And I was sceptical to begin with but I was... it wasn't a good time for me and I needed some help."
I, John Hamish Watson, take you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, to be my wedded husband.”
“Please.”
"Oh? Nothing bad, I hope."
and, critically,
“Fine,” John nods. “Yeah, it’s fine.”
When he seems to have run out of steam, John tunes back in. Really, the boxers and shirt thing should look ridiculous, but it really doesn't.
“Get under, idiot!” John says, exasperated and softens it with a smile when Sherlock just looks at him again and blinks.
John cannot find any better words to explain to him, so he fumbles for Sherlock’s hand and pulls it to his mouth, places a kiss on his palm and lets his fingers learn the pattern of blood vessels on Sherlock’s wrist.
Sherlock’s arm falls to his side, making him look more vulnerable than ever. He doesn’t try to cover himself and makes no concession to modesty at all. Head tipped towards John, his expression is engaged now, assessing and calculating, working probabilities and parsing complicated emotions that John had thought him incapable of recognising, let alone feeling.
John swallows and lifts his chin. “Yes,” he manages around the sudden ache in his throat.
"Not if there's a major river nearby, certainly," John quips with a quick grin and a wink at them both.
“Other than the sex of course,” Sherlock nods.
John had backed him up against the bookshelf and twined his fingers through Sherlock's hair, had pulled his head down and taken possession of Sherlock's lips and tongue, had palmed him through his trousers and brought him off right there in the sitting room, barely getting his hand on Sherlock's skin before, to his shame, he'd gasped and come. John's praises and encouraging murmurs had grounded him and kept him tethered to reality when his instinct had been to fly apart, hide himself away and try to make sense of what had just happened. He had initially thought it most likely an aberration, a crystalline moment of bliss, stolen from somewhere and someone else; something to be kept and treasured in the most secret places of his mind palace and only taken out in times of most desperate need. But then it had happened again, with Sherlock’s wholehearted participation this time. And it had continued to happen, and by the time Sherlock had worked out what it was and how unready for it they had both been, it had been much too late and he’d already been bound to John through affection, desire and sensations of safety and happiness in his presence  - which are apparently quite common in cases of love.
He looks around for John to share this hypothesis, only then remembering that he is at work – Sherlock recalls a sick feeling of dread as he’d left the room. He’s debating how to exploit this new information when the damn persistent voices begin again. Sherlock approaches the sitting room door with unsteady hands and his stomach clenching in anxiety. It doesn’t seem to matter how many times he tells himself that his fears are baseless; he cannot control them whenever he imagines himself stepping through this mundane, familiar door.
The fire settles again and John feels Sherlock shifting against his side, probably going back to his phone and whatever esoteric piece of information he needs at 3 a.m. They don’t actually have a case on at the moment, which is good because it means that Sherlock can spend some time accompanying his mother to and from the hospital and…
John just shrugs.
He'd expected John to say something, to explain his less than usually cautious behaviour. Sherlock might be a master of observation - and he observed a lot in John's upturned face and curious glances - but interpreting those observations has eluded him too many times. He reacted to John's touch - that deliberate slide of fingers over the back of his hand - with a caress of his own. Hard to imagine that John would have missed that. But instead of speaking, as he expected John to, he looked confused and distracted, as if he'd been misunderstood and now was trying to find a way to explain to Sherlock how very unwelcome his attentions were. Perhaps he thought it was something to do with the budding friendship between Crispian and him, that Sherlock was testing him, fearful for their continued partnership.
Slamming the drawer shut, John closes down that line of thought at the same time. He swore to himself that he wouldn't go there again after six months of hoping that Sherlock might look his way sometime. They are friends - the greatest of friends - and John is learning that’s a big thing for Sherlock. According to some not so subtle hints from Mycroft on their first meeting and later confirmed by the man himself, Sherlock doesn't really have friends. He has colleagues and associates and family and even some acquaintances like Mike Stamford, but whether or not Sherlock thinks of them in any other capacity than how they fit in with the work, is another question. So John finds himself in a subset of one  - people Sherlock knows
He was so close now, focussing his attention on the head of his glistening cock, that he didn’t hear John surrender and cross the space between them. His eyes blew wide when he felt the soft brush of John’s fingertips whispering up his side and grazing patterns across his chest.
He finds his body is reacting to the convoluted images in his sleep-fuzzy mind. Thoughts of John, warm and pliant on waking, are making him harden in his pyjamas, the deep, sweet ache of it already a familiar sensation, but heightened now with John right here beside him.
“Thank you for the clarification. So what philosophical gem did Bill reveal?”
But John squeezes his wrist gently and shakes his head, so Sherlock just waits as best he can, pushing down the pulse of irritation his brother’s meddling always produces.
He doesn’t love Mary.
“What are we drinking to?” Sherlock asks when John doesn’t speak.
He’s kissed people before, of both sexes, but this is undoubtedly more than Sherlock has ever experienced before. He wonders if the others were doing it wrong. There is an exciting flood of unexpressed emotion here that they have tapped into. Without his express instruction, Sherlock’s hands have come up to bracket John’s jaw and slide back into his hair (short and soft), while John’s grip on Sherlock’s shirt shows no sign of easing, he's dropped the bag and his other arm is curling around his waist. Pulling them closer together still.
"They're from Ranbir. I know we've had our disagreements, but it is lovely to be remembered on Valentine's Day isn't it?" she says with a smile of delight, then looks more closely at her lodger. "Is Sherlock not home yet, dear?"
John looks out of the kitchen doors to the garden beyond, a tangle of weeds and brambles and neglect. It’s been raining on and off during the night and when it hasn’t been raining, it’s been blowing a gale. John has no more  plans today than to walk further than the wood store to keep the woodburner fed.
gay (an unsubstantiated theory) and interested in sex (some strong evidence but no definitive proof) then...
"We'd love to," John accepts. "Anybody else up for a bit of fresh air and honest work? Crispian?”
“Drink your tea before it gets cold, dear,” she fusses, crossing to the door.  “And next time you see him...”
“Ta dah!” he mutters and smiles as John looks around, impressed.
But he shakes Sherlock’s response off and holds up a finger, asking for a moment that Sherlock doesn’t want to grant, but knows he must.
He’d almost said something else then, a measure of how this meeting is affecting his ability to function. Fifteen minutes, he tells himself, thirty at the very most and this will be done. He will be able to walk away knowing that he has achieved what he feared he couldn't. That he will have met up with Mary Watson’s husband, and emerged unscathed, and if not unscathed, then at least intact.
Sherlock looked up. “Hello, John,” he smiled, all calculated innocence spoiled only by the sparkle in his disingenuous eyes and the way his lips quirked at the corner, which always gave him away when he was teasing. He laid down his book.
“Now you,” Sherlock murmurs releasing John’s finger to the cool air. He settles back and drops his eyes expectantly to John’s cotton covered groin where an obscenely large and dark patch rests over the head of his cock. “Show me,” Sherlock insists.
Sherlock wants to roll his eyes at the phrase knowing that it isn't John's, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.
"Well, you may have noticed that the house isn't decorated for Christmas yet. It's a bit of a tradition in the family to save it for Christmas Eve and after Sigger's birthday,” Mummy explains to John whose eyes, miraculously, do not glaze over.  “Could you take the wheelbarrow down to the woods and find us some evergreen? There are several holly trees down there and the ivy is positively rampant. If you could cut a barrowful then we can spruce this place up a bit for Christmas," Mummy tells them.
“I had to recover the missing engagement ring,” Sherlock said in his ear, then muttered a curse as John heard a series of bumps and clatters both through the phone and through the wall of the horse transporter.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow and flick to John’s briefly before skittering away, and he begins a thorough search of the sitting room, disregarding anything in his path, but soon discovering the tiny camera, no bigger than a drawing pin head, on the centre of the mantel clock hands.
It isn’t immediately forthcoming.
How ridiculous is that? He’s in France.
John stays quiet, waiting for Sherlock’s next laboured words. It’s exhausting, and he swallows against the frustration.
The shock Sherlock can feel register on his face is reflected in John’s reaction. His features crumple for a moment.
“I don’t know where they’ve gone, but that’s fine.”
The stew turns out to be very good and after their exertions of this morning, they all end up scraping their bowls clean, mopping the last of it with the fresh chunks of the bread it was served with. It doesn't take long for the warm room and full stomachs to bring a welcome kind of calm to their company. Even the covert bickering takes on an indulgent edge.
“Thank you for explaining, John,” Sherlock husks, clears his throat and turns to face him more fully. “And does this love of your life status come with benefits?”
“I think we have both suffered enough, John. Let’s agree that neither of us was without blame and leave this guilt here. Move on with our lives.”
“Put your hands on the headboard, love. Hold on tight,” John growled into his boyfriend’s skin.
“If this person is that important to you then you owe it to yourself to find out if they feel the same way.”
“Doesn’t matter – the answer is the same. Yes, I believe I know of your feelings for me. Yes, we should have discussed this earlier. Yes, you should divorce Mary and yes, you should stay here, with me, at Baker Street.”
John wishes again that he had time to breathe here. He wants to mentally take stock of all the pieces of information that Sherlock has gifted him today, take his time and tally them up to make sure this is heading where he thinks (hopes) this is heading. He shifts a little, guiltily aware that he's already becoming aroused.
soothing but even they won’t stop her from hearing him bellowing.
“Then talk to me,” John says plainly.
this?
Soon he will slip free of John’s body, but for now he is content to linger. Sherlock sighs and settles further into the pillows, burrowing himself a spot where he can press his nose to John’s hairline and breathe him in.
Clearly the house in Saint Barthélemy Le Vieux is one of the victims of his sister’s marital problems, a relic of happier days. They had bought it full of optimism and plans for their future but no one had visited in over a year,  and the view from the kitchen testifies to that. Once it might have been a productive, well-tended garden but now it is a weed-choked wasteland without any hint of the love and expectation it was started with.
“You do understand that this is exactly what you would say if you were having ongoing neurological symptoms,” John says eventually, almost as if he’s asking Sherlock to prove otherwise. “Your logic didn’t suffer, just your… inhibition and emotional processing.”
The hours that follow Sherlock’s departure drag by interminably, marked only by his continued silence. Never the most enthusiastic conversationalist, Sherlock can usually be relied on to reply to John’s texts, even if only with a single word. “Idiot”, “No”, and “Wrong” are tied in first place as his most common responses, although “Tedious”, gets an honourable mention. But he refrains from giving Sherlock the opportunity to insult him for as long as he can bear it.
With a towel around his waist, John returns to the bedroom and kisses Sherlock’s forehead to wake him from the doze he’s sunk into. Sherlock grumbles at his dampness but accepts the towel that John gives him and disappears toward the bathroom with a tiny shy smile.
Showing a surprising amount of coordination, John grabs at Sherlock’s hand when he flumps back onto the poor, abused sofa.
enough.
"The window," Sherlock gestures when John stares at him blankly for too long.
“How do you mean?”
is the greatest gift he will ever get.
Silly man – he’s as bad as Sherlock. For all their cleverness and experience, they cannot see what is under their very noses. It’s a wonder they can find their own arses with two hands, she thinks. It’s as plain as day that they are devoted to each other but if she stands by and says nothing,
John holds the jar up to the sunlight, and admires the amber, almost reddish tint of the contents before he unscrews the lid and cautiously takes a sniff. It’s not like anything else John has ever smelled. It reminds him slightly of wild flowers and of hot days of exploring in the woods when he was a boy; the sweetness is a subtle afterthought. He dips a little finger in the creamy honey and sucks it into his mouth. It’s flavour is also surprising, he finds it hard to name -  but it’s delicate and it lingers on his tongue long after he has swallowed.
“Should I pencil in a regular Thursday meeting?” He balks internally at the callousness of his tone, but doesn’t let it show. He has form in this.
Sherlock nods and they raise their glasses in salute, muttering the words in accordance with the ancient tradition.
When Sherlock had called last night, he'd seemed happy enough to have solved it, and had rated it a six overall due to the complexity of the plot, the chance to visit Edinburgh, a place he loved, and the fact that the family involved could trace their lineage directly from William Kidd, the seventeenth century pirate. He'd also sounded pleased to be coming home. Neither of them enjoyed cases as much as when they could work them together, and although John's job at Barts is ridiculously forgiving of his erratic hours, he had already committed himself to three days worth of A & E shifts before the call came in.
It's a deflection and an obvious one, but if he keeps John talking he might get answers to some of the questions that refuse to leave him in peace.
). What they don't know though, because they don't get to share this Sherlock, is that he is also this - a man who trembles when John touches him, a man who laughs and smiles spontaneously and a man who knows how to tell John how much he loves him with every glance, word and touch.
“That’s something he couldn’t discern from his surveillance? It seems unlikely that his invasive monitoring of my every breath could have left him in any doubt of my physical health.”
"Really, John?  Can you tell me why you keep your dog tags on your dresser and your medals in a torn shoebox under your wardrobe? Or why you have the number of that SOC officer you chatted up a fortnight ago on your bedside table but you haven't called her? Why you use the hand cream in your bedside drawer when you masturbate but have a bottle of personal lubricant at the back of the bottom drawer in your dresser? Why you have tickets to concerts you attended and tickets from train journeys you took as a teenager and although you have kept your textbooks, the only thing you have from your years of medical training is a library card from King's College? It’s tucked in with those tickets, so it is clearly of significance. It didn't take me long to work out the answers so I don’t know why you’re getting so worked-up. I was only in there for a few minutes."
“I thought we’d already decided. Big garden. No immediate neighbours to upset. A few apple trees and a veggie plot, a shower for me, a bath for you and a cat.”
It’s a progression that even John will know with his charmingly limited awareness of any music written before his teen years. Indeed, John's gaze turns quickly towards the piano when he recognises the notes, his eyes widening when he sees Sherlock standing at his brother's side. Sherlock lowers his gaze and comes in perfectly on cue. It's a hackneyed piece if he's honest, the Canon in D by Pachelbel, but it is one of John's favourites and he will have heard Sherlock practicing it recently. Originally for 3 violins and a basso continuo, Sherlock has arranged this version so his brother can actually do some work for a change and provide both harmony and bass, with Sherlock taking the majority of the melody. It's not going to win awards but it's a piece that he and his brother used to play together when Sherlock was first becoming proficient.
Walking was the right choice, Sherlock congratulates himself. If he's walking then he can't be watching John's face, he can't be running probabilities in his head, he isn't expected to force his own features into a facsimile of  sympathy.
"He's not
He loved it when Sherlock got like this. Although John teased him for being bossy and pushy in bed, Sherlock was, in fact, rather reticent about asking for what he wanted. It had taken John a long time to persuade him that everything was on the table, sexually speaking. While he hadn’t experienced every pleasure two human bodies could elicit, John was pretty sure he had a broader history to draw on than Sherlock had. It had taken a lot of encouragement, some strategic teasing and the stamina and patience of a saint to finally get Sherlock to trust John enough to take what he needed and to believe that John was as into that as Sherlock was himself. It had affected them both more profoundly that John had realised it would, moved their physical relationship from some very satisfying sex to something deeper and more profound as their trust in each other had grown.
“Why did you wait until now to say this?”
“You’re a menace,” John muttered.
“The point,” Mycroft insists, “is that my brother, for whatever reason, has chosen to share more of himself with you than any other human he has ever encountered. I would be stupid not to question the significance of that, and I am
John returns with a smile and Sherlock finds one from somewhere to go with his muttered, "Ready?" He wraps his coat more closely around himself and sets a pace that's slow enough for them to talk, but quick enough that they can't make a lot of eye contact. He reminds himself he can walk away any time he wants but recognises within less than thirty seconds that he has adjusted his gait to John's shorter, more stilted pace. The limp is back but John has declined to resort to his cane.
“It’s market day in Rebon and I guessed that you’d sleep in, being as exhausted as you were last night and as I was going anyway, I thought I’d pick up some basics for you until you had time to sort yourself out a little bit.”
The door is ajar and Sherlock pushes it open, slips inside and closes it behind him. John's wet boots are against the wall (laces still tied - he stepped on the heels and prised them off) and his coat is hanging up on the peg. The borrowed hat and scarf are on the radiator, placed there neatly to dry out. Sherlock can't remove his outerwear quickly enough, his boots kicked to the side of the hallway and his coat half on, half off its peg. In his socks, he follows John's path, up the backstairs and along the corridor to Crispian's bedroom. Pressing his ear to the door, he can hear the men talking softly. It would appear that Crispian was asleep when John knocked. if the low murmur of his voice is anything to go on -but then with Crispian, one cannot really tell. Sherlock strains to hear what is passing between them, to discern any shred of what John might be giving away with his tone of voice but the walls and the door are too thick - it's as if their conversation is being held in deliberately lowered voices.
“Okay. It would be good to have a chat at some point if you don’t mind, get myself caught up.”
“That is the general idea,” Sherlock deadpanned. “Do
“Oh, John! All this rushing around! You get more like his nibs every day,” she scolded him. She was dressed for outside, on her way somewhere, thank goodness, John thought.
"Long enough," Sherlock agrees and despite the awful lighting, the grainy picture and his distance from the camera. John can see as Sherlock presses the heel of his palm harder over the bulging outline of his cock. The pants leave nothing at all to the imagination and are already stretched out as Sherlock fills and hardens even further.
“Do you? Fall in love with people, I mean. I know you love serial killers an’ locked room murders an’ tea an’ eyes in jam jars an’ your micr’scope but do you love… people. Ever?”
It takes John much of the morning to put right the damage M. Holmes has done but the irritation soon wears off into a weird kind of fascination. He sits on his step at lunchtime eating his sandwich and wonders what kind of a man wears dress shoes in a garden. He clears an old bed of thistle-like things, now desiccated and rough and asks himself where a name like Sherlock comes from. Is it his first name or part of a double-barrelled surname? He replaces a few glass panes in the dilapidated greenhouse he’s beginning to uncover from beneath the overgrown vine and considers what M. Holmes’s first language might be as he seemed equally willing to insult him in either.
“In here,” came Sherlock’s rumbling reply from the sitting room.
“Oh!” Sherlock looks delightfully flustered, a little bit pleased and a little bit unnerved.
Sherlock kisses a trail across his shoulders and collar bone, and down the middle of his chest, pausing to roll first one nipple and then the other eliciting pleased grunts from John, as he noses lower and lower. He lifts his tousled head as John is arching his back off the bed and greedily urging Sherlock's mouth where he really needs it.
, John?”
"Nor did I, clearly, as I’ve been in the process of divorcing her for longer than I was actually married to her."
That John is still a theory, hypothesised and predicted – he is a possibility, nothing more. There are numerous similarities that, if he’s correct, will urge John down the path that Sherlock is hoping for, things that Sherlock had noted but ignored in the months they have lived together – hell, things from the first conversation they had, the first meal, the first cab journey, but John has had months to change and grow away from the man that he was. Sherlock has to get this right – it might be too late already, it could backfire horribly and end with him losing this John forever; his friendship, his companionship, his support, his help, his admiration. He might well end up with nothing. But, Sherlock is certain that the risk is worth the reward – only just, but even so. He can’t go back to living the way they were, not now he knows what they could be.
Sherlock’s brows draw down for a moment before his expression clears.
And this could be the biggest mistake Sherlock has ever made, his greatest ever miscalculation with consequences to match but he doesn’t think that’s the way this will go. It won’t be easy and there will be moments when he’ll think all his efforts have been in vain, but in those moments he will remember why he chose this path today and it will remind him to keep choosing it. He’s not deciding whether to love the man or not - that was decided a long time ago and doesn’t appear to be negotiable. And John loves him too - it’s not hard to discern when the man will go to such lengths, such uncharacteristic ends to achieve them both being in the same place at the same time. John, who is trying to do his best, failing and trying again. John, who can walk away from a chaotic upbringing, from the army, from being a surgeon, but who cannot walk away from Sherlock.
A world in which John Watson’s existence doesn’t consume Sherlock. Such a thing might conceivably come into being if he walks away - if he leaves right now.
John decides to press on anyway.
Sherlock has taken off his shoes and jacket and lies on his back, eyes closed his hands together and resting against his chin. He's really too long for the single bed and he has his ankles crossed, his heels over the end of the mattress. His toes flex and curl restlessly, even though the rest of him is completely still. Whatever it was that had him in such a strop has clearly been forgotten, John thinks as he gazes across to where his favourite idiot is happily lost in his mind palace.
He knows before he tries that the windows will not open, but that doesn’t stop him from scraping his hands as he wrestles with the ancient mechanism.
John takes the box, his eyes wide as he watches the man inch closer to the group with a pair of secateurs. John has seen people handle bees before on TV but they have always worn strange, veiled hats, gauntlets and protective overalls. This maniac hasn’t even got a pair of gloves on. He mutters again and it sounds important.
“Pretty
“On the contrary, John, I just haven’t done so with such flair as you appear to possess!”
“John,” he mouths, breathing into the shape of it. “Sorry. I… I’m sorry.”
"Let's make a start," Sherlock says. "Crispian can catch us up."
much football in the world, surely? But no, it seems to be the equally tedious, completely stomach-churning discussion of women that makes up the gap in the male-bonding ritual. And now John has phoned to share his epiphany with him. What joy!
He wipes the corners of his mouth with that back of his wrist and crosses his arms over his chest.
“Mind palace. There… We are… we were there,” Sherlock whispers, never having wanted command of his voice more than now. He needs to insist, argue, press his point. He needs to stalk around and gesticulate. He cannot so much as create full sentences yet.
he think about when he's getting himself off?
Being the love of someone’s life is pretty time intensive, Sherlock thinks as he opens the kitchen window and drops the sack onto the bins below with a loud squelch and clatter.
“So your experience in the military and medicine really complement your new role as Sherlock’s… associate?” Crispian offers, feeling his way words the correct term. John can’t blame him;
For every glimpse of regret he has seen from Sherlock, there has been not one from Mycroft. John had no liking for Irene Adler, but she’d been spot-on with Mycroft – he
It’s enough – he’s told himself that every day since the man walked into that restaurant instead of his fiancée-to-be and changed everything. Again. He’d asked and he’d been heard. And it
It’s edging towards spring, but you wouldn’t know it. The UK is locked in a prolonged cold spell and it still gets dark too early in the evenings. After all the gaudy festive lights have been taken down, London feels grey, dirty and seedier than ever. Trapped between Christmas and the clocks going forward again, it’s that strange time of year when the British collectively suffer from the post-festive, post-credit card bill slump. Snow loses its mystical December allure and becomes something to endure or dread. New Year’s resolutions have all been broken, the telly is awash with adverts for package holidays to sunnier climes and everyone waits for the day when they can break out of their thick winter clothing, blinking like pale, over-excited butterflies from damp wool chrysalises.
“I suggest you try to eat something simple. Some people find it helps with the hangover symptoms.”
"So, what I wanted to say to you, is that I'm sorry."
' even if the big git doesn't say it. "
His relationship with Mary had been born of desperation – she was the first person to have shown him any glimpse of what remained of him after the bleakness of his loss. He had warned her of his past and she hadn’t batted an eyelid. Wrapped in grief, he hadn’t even noticed that she’d failed to offer him the same courtesy.
And John is nodding already, face to the wind, his eyes tearing up in the stiff, cold gusts. He looks defeated, as if he came expecting exactly this.
"Let's be quick and maybe we can be gone before anyone else is up."
With growing horror, Sherlock realises that this is his own voice, attempting to say something. His throat is sore, his lips dry, and something is constricting his windpipe, making him choke. He
“Shut up!” John suggests, pushing a hand through his hair and giving it an ever more alarmed look to the ‘slept on the sofa’ style. This sounds like good advice, so Sherlock does.
Sherlock picks up a discarded mug, cupping it thoughtfully in his palm before he pitches it with all his might at the wall. It shatters satisfyingly, the dregs of the coffee describing a perfectly fan-shaped pattern across the wallpaper.
Sherlock reaches across to turn out the lamp on his bedside table.
“But it’s not Christmas yet!” John objects.
“Sounds like a perfect day,” Sherlock yawns.
"I suspect that Mummy will have a list of jobs for us - she usually does. I can never fathom why as she presumably manages admirably without my help for the overwhelming remainder of the year."
“Come on, let’s go run a bath. I was thinking we might go out to dinner tonight. What do you think?”
"And nothing! What?" she squeaks at John's sceptical expression.
John is still asking banal questions of his cousin when Mycroft takes a seat at the piano. He looks across to Sherlock, his eyes flicking to John and Crispian for a split second before coming back to rest on Sherlock to greet his gaze with his blandest expression. Mycroft's lips quirk slightly as he tilts his head, inviting Sherlock to join him.
People don't talk about these things for a reason - they are difficult and they make you vulnerable to the person you tell. You have to trust them with this hidden side of you - that they won’t react with distaste and that they will repay your faith in telling them. If there’s anyone that should hear these kinds of things about John, then it’s Sherlock, but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier, so when John finally speaks his voice is low and laboured.
“You know we owe your brother for this kick up the arse, don’t you? If he hadn’t visited, if he hadn’t texted…”
There’s no fence or wall but it’s obvious where his sister’s property ends and his neighbour’s begins. On his side the long grass is studded with last year’s spoiled fallen fruit, branches blown down and drifts of leaves wherever something impedes their progress. On the other, the grass is mowed and tidy, the flowerbeds are dug and weed-free, and stands of ornamental trees are dotted about in aesthetically pleasing groups. It’s a bit embarrassing how both of these areas purport to be gardens and John feels a twinge of guilt about whoever has to endure the sight of their attempt.
it occurred to me later that you might have just been saying one thing and thinking another, but by then I assumed we’d lost our momentum,” John muses. “You were telling people you were a sociopath and blazing a path through London’s finest, pissing them off as you went and I was an angry, depressed man who was insisting he wasn’t gay. It wasn’t exactly a match made in heaven, was it?”
“Doesn’t this count as workplace harassment, Mike?” Sherlock asked breathily, blinking at him as if John was indeed some skeevy older man, abusing his position and lusting after the prettiest boy in programming.
Letting that slide, John battled on. “So why are we still here if you’ve already…”
John keeps sending amused glances towards Sherlock; he thinks it might be fondness, but he can't be sure at this distance. And really, he ought to go over there and say something so devastatingly obvious (or 'insulting', as John calls it) to send both Crispian and Odelia off to find their mother to tell on Sherlock. Again. It's been a good while since the last time, so it's probably about time that particular family tradition was revived.
John's eyes are searching him, looking for clues, trying to solve a puzzle of his own making - to anyone else, it is surely obvious that Sherlock Holmes is in love with him and has been for a long time. Only John looks at Sherlock and doesn't see the answer written as plain as day on his skin, in his voice, in his every action.
The beauty of watching Crispian's face fall is indescribable. Did the man honestly think that John would trot off to the pub without inviting Sherlock along too? "Oh, I'd rather thought..."
John finds himself smiling as he scans the sheets replacing them on the stand. Some just have crosses on, others have dates or single words. One has a circular teacup stain. He wonders at how long Sherlock has been playing with him in mind, making selections for the sole purpose of soothing John’s fractured nights and uneasy days. He wonders how many of these he has tried to attribute to Chopin just to make Sherlock roll his eyes at him. He wonders how many nights he has been Sherlock’s audience of one, unconscious or otherwise.
“Please,” he whispers, staring into John’s searching eyes, willing him to understand, to give him a chance.
"If any member of my family is idiotic enough to blunder in here, then they deserve everything they get an eyeful of, " he mutters and silences John's next, less emphatic objections by kissing the words straight out of his mouth.
"Thank you for the invitation. You know where I am if you ever need anything," he says, able to be generous now that he is leaving.
“How about a change of scenery?” Sherlock had said. “A little spring-time country air? Put some colour back into our cheeks?”
That can't happen anymore.
“I love you,” John states simply, all his walls crumbling, all his inhibitions stripped back by the combination of the evening’s extraordinary events and weariness and this perfect moment – a breathing space, out of time when even London is silenced. John doesn’t think he could lie now, even if he needed to.
So now, with the baby due soon and with Sherlock’s quiet support, he is going to have to forgive his lying wife and go back to their tidy, neutral little flat and be a husband and a father, pretending that he had chosen any of it while in possession of the full facts. Pretending that they are happy.
Sherlock reaches up a hand and lays his palm to John's cheek. He leans up and kisses him with a sweetly swollen pinkened mouth, soft and fleeting, then nudges John off his chest and rolls off the bed. He turns back to John , sprawled across the messed up sheets. His face is clear and certain, and he holds a hand out to John in invitation. The honey light of the afternoon creeps through the messy curls, lighting them up like a halo of gold. John has never seen anything more spell-binding, soul-binding and if he could say, "I do," right now, he would. No-one has ever seen this Sherlock, no-one even suspects that he exists. He is John's, completely and utterly, free to be himself, as difficult and demanding as he can be, and as gentle and adoring as John knows him to be. He doesn't fear rejection, he never needs to pretend - he knows that John loves him. God knows he's told him often enough but once more cannot hurt.
Oldest trick in the book.
If John had to shake one more idiot’s hand, he wasn’t going to be held responsible for his subsequent breakdown. An assault charge would be a small price to pay if it meant he could stop pretending to be Mike Baker from the San Francisco office and resume his role as John Watson, doctor, former British Army Captain and boyfriend of the man who was currently undercover somewhere in this dreadful, depressing office in Slough.
Hugh is a quiet man, easily overlooked or underestimated, but his mind is just as sharp as those of his family, in his own way. John can see a lot of Violet in Sherlock and Mycroft - they draw the eye and tend to dominate any conversation they entertain. Sherlock has her dramatic flair, her cheekbones and her energy but he has his dad’s eyes and, as John has discovered, his gentleness. Hugh also makes no secret of loving his boys though, and shows it through warm hands on backs or shoulders, proud, soft smiles and in the way he listens to their words.
John pulls out the plug and nearly brains himself on the sink in his haste to climb back in at the other end of the bath. Sherlock's hips have sunk lower in the water without John's body to raise them up, but John scoots close and encourages Sherlock to rest his lower back on his knees. Sherlock hums and stretches. With his knee hooked over the side still, John is faced with Sherlock's beautiful arse, dusted with fine dark hairs, his pale, smooth skin deepens to a plum pink where John intends to make a proper job of his teasing now.
Not only does he ache for the man in his mind palace, but he finds he misses his real John too, in a way that makes very little sense. He misses the easiness of their friendship, which whilst not what he’d dreamed of, has clearly become necessary to his continued wellbeing. Sherlock longs for his smiles and his high-pitched giggles, he misses shared tea and comfortable silences even if only in the privacy of 221B. He misses the fact that he could be himself and had almost come to trust that John wouldn’t be repelled by his personality quirks, but would forgive him for his lapses in societal norms. He feels as if he is watching John withdraw,  leaving a shadow in his place. He may look like him and sound like him, but Sherlock knows there is more, so close to the surface that he can almost touch it,  yet he cannot put it into words. He appears to be missing a John Watson that doesn’t exist anywhere.
too presumptuous?
“Shoulder,” John admits, surprising himself.  “The leg is psychosomatic.”
Only Sherlock Holmes could have come up with a sentence like that so soon after such a powerful orgasm, John concluded as his lust-fogged brain parsed it down to ‘my turn to come now.’
So Sherlock’s known all along. So much for being circumspect. “Sorry, I…”
Sherlock glances over to find John watching him with a most conflicted expression on his face. It’s an interesting reaction that suggests to Sherlock that the doctor, imaginary or not, is beginning to have serious misgivings about the state of Sherlock’s sanity. That makes two of them.
And now she’s for bed. She decides to indulge in one of her herbal soothers and possibly leaving the radio on overnight. Knowing the noise they can make on a normal day, she’s pretty sure she isn’t going to be wanting to overhear whatever it is they get up to tonight.
John rubs a hand over his face and contorts himself, plainly in an effort to work the soreness out of his back and shoulder.
When Mycroft has advised abstention from sentiment, Sherlock wonders whether this is what he was warning against. The torment of being attracted to John, living in close quarters with him and sharing the work with him is distracting and tiresomely inconstant. As many times as he has had high hopes of his sentiments being returned, he has tasted the bitterness of certainty that they will remain forever unrequited. It is not a comfortable feeling for someone like him who has trained himself over many years to ignore such base sensations as arousal and attraction.
"John...I don't think... I'm not..."
Sherlock grunts. "I've had to put up with them all for a lot longer than you have."
makes it easy for John to pick out Donald Donaldson who unfortunately comes to stand a few paces in front of John. The man is an interesting ruddy colour that probably has more to do with the pub than with the freezing evening. They sing one more,
"I don't mind," John insists, to Sherlock more than to Mycroft. It doesn't hurt that it will keep him in Mummy's good graces too. "I don't know all the words, but I can hum with the best of them."
"I know you don’t place any value in the feelings of lesser beings, but that is
"Right, lend me your shoulder." His voice is strained, presumably from being bent over a branch.
“You’re British,” Carla exclaimed. “Had enough of Uncle Sam for a bit, have you?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirks up without his express permission. Transparent, indeed! John is a happy drunk on the whole; he doesn’t get stroppy or argumentative, he just gets a bit giggly and lets go of some of the ‘Captain Watson’ that he carries around in his daily life. Luckily Sherlock happens to enjoy the company of John Watson, regardless of his mood.
is gay or not, he wouldn't be the first man who re-evaluated his choices after a chance meeting. And until he has accepted an offer elsewhere, he is fair game, Sherlock. You should consider that. Sleep well, cousin!"
When his mobile pings he picks it up hoping for a message from Lestrade about a better class of case or at least his brother giving him a good target for his frustrations. When he sees John's name his heart lurches unpleasantly. He thinks about ignoring it, deleting it, but he knows he won't. He knows that he will weaken and read it - it’s an inevitability that he doesn't feel strong enough to test the limits of.
There are no stars tonight and the moon is little more than a marginally lighter area of sky through the thick clouds that have built up during the day. John briefly considers getting out his phone and using the torch on there, but he knows that it will alter the mood that has settled over them both. They walk the path toward the house slowly now, Sherlock still holding his jam jar lantern, its gentle flicker casting complimentary brightness across his cheeks and into his hair. They can see the lights of the house already when the first flakes begin to their slow spinning waltz from above. They both stop to look up and John cannot stop the wondrous grin that breaks across his face. Within thirty seconds the sky is filled with the crazy, lazy tumble of soft, fat snowflakes, falling as fast as they are silent.
“You’d better be the bloody genius everyone says you are, Sherlock. If you’re wrong about this… if you’re wrong, if you regret this later, there’s no way back for us. We can’t…
Sherlock hesitates for the first time and John's heart lurches in his chest. "My experience of sex has been varied but frequently disappointing. Being unacquainted with a lover can make things uncomfortable and awkward and I frequently consider giving it all up as an unnecessary exercise. I have yet to be convinced that it serves any purpose that cannot be fulfilled in other ways. "
Human.
Bare feet wriggling in the heat, Sherlock’s long, pyjama’d legs were stretched out in front of him, but instead of his favourite dressing gown, Sherlock had pulled on John’s biggest, softest jumper; the oatmeal one with the cable knit. It was a little too short for him; Sherlock hadn’t needed to turn back the cuffs on the sleeves and it barely skimmed the waistband of his pyjama trousers.
“So we won’t be hearing excuses about the transport not needing dinner tonight, right?”
Mme Hudson seems to be the only other person who Sherlock interacts with on a regular basis, and John isn’t certain what that relationship might look like. She’s very defensive of him, he understands but that loyalty must have been earned at some point and John would dearly love to know what that was.
For John to be here, with a memorised speech in a room full of strangers, apologising for who the hell knew what, must be hellish for a man like him. He's a private man - outwardly respectable and affable, inside he is a complex mess of recklessness, caring, conflicting drives and misdirected anger. He's a ticking time bomb of a man and Sherlock thinks it will take more than a new therapist to defuse him. He has known John for some time. He has seen him at his highest and lowest and all points in between. He’s seen him defeated and broken, exhilarated and euphoric. Sherlock has seen John cry, seen him angry, seen him helpless and aroused. Sherlock knows John's face better than he knows his own. He appears to be in earnest - he's making eye contact but not excessively so, his hands and breathing are relaxing now he has begun, and his voice, though low and quiet, is sincere and not strained.
. Snooping implies an element of secrecy that was clearly lacking in this situation as you have discovered my earlier visit.
Eyes narrowing, John tips his head. A smile flirts with his lips - not certain if he's being pardoned or teased or something less welcome.
"Ermmmm..." His legs bicycling madly, Sherlock is beginning to lose his grip on the branch and is gradually slipping.
John's eyebrows flick up before he has the sense to mask his reaction. He can't definitively say that Sherlock is being weird today, because Sherlock seems to have an inexhaustible supply of quirky, surprising and downright shocking so, within those parameters, talking about his mastubatory habits is not the strangest conversation that John has ever had with the man. It’s more candid than John is used to but that seems to be what today is about. He supposes this is Sherlock's way of bringing something to the 'let's expose John Watson's darkest secrets' party. The madman would not know what was appropriate sharing if it jumped up and bit him on the arse. But it
“Hmmm,” Sherlock rumbled, “Polo uniform. Interesting.”
He closes that one and pulls open the next drawer down and… hits the motherlode. It’s so good, in fact, that he blinks several times in shock. There are three assorted bottles of lube - one still in its plastic wrap, one just open and one over half used already,  as well as some clean, stacked flannels, textured condoms, several… are those clamps?... and a sleek black dildo - not flashy or obscenely large though unmistakably a device designed for personal pleasure. But instead of a rush of triumph, John is more curious than anything.
The lady arrives laden down with baskets and bread and bottles. She manages to get everything onto the kitchen table without disaster and turns to kiss John on both cheeks as if she hasn’t just performed such gymnastics.
“Hmm?”
“Are you…? Is everything alright?”
Crispian looks as surprised as Sherlock feels at his outburst. "O... kay," he says cautiously. "I'm not completely sure where that came from but I can assure you, I haven't propositioned him. "
John felt it would be churlish to refuse him and took him as deep as he could without choking. Sherlock, always so responsive, was soon gasping snatches of profanity. Slowly working his hand around Sherlock’s cock as he focussed on the head now, rolling his tongue roughly at the ridge below the crown where he was most sensitive. Sherlock jerked, mumbled his name in warning and then shuddered his way through his orgasm as John held him gently inside the warmth of his mouth.
"I agree," Crispian says, in far too jolly a tone. "How about we go to the pub in the village for lunch?"
“I… Well I think you… I mean, this is rather an elaborate plan to engineer for a conversation about..." He can't actually think of how to end that sentence. Is ‘
“Explain,” Sherlock challenges.
"To be fair, I wasn't sure. I thought maybe you were successfully suppressing any homosexual tendencies or urges you might have had."
The tall man seems to have brought a wooden crate with him and he reaches down gracefully and picks it up now. He edges it toward John slowly and carefully, and gabbles something at him in a voice that sounds commanding.
The radio is playing something dreadful and John taps the tip of the knife blade in time against the cutting board while he waits for a pan to heat. When the chorus comes around, John begins to sing along softly, his body rocking slightly as his weight shifts to the beat.
missed.
His reflection looks healthy and happy; relaxed with a soul deep contentment that even he can see. That's all Sherlock. He sometimes wonders what his life would have been had he not met Mike Stamford on that fateful day in London. He could never have imagined, as bitter and aching as he was at the time, that his life could be what it is now. And for what is about to come - well that would have been in the
There’s a pause between them that John feels like unpleasant static charge. Polite smiles fading faster than they can think of something else to say.
With a deeper, sweeter kiss still, Sherlock rolled away from John and with enviable grace, reached over to his bedside table where a tube of lubricant was waiting. He tossed it to land by John’s belly, then knelt at the head of the bed, watching over his shoulder as John’s mind came back online to snatch at the lube and shuffle himself up behind Sherlock, sucking kisses up and down his spine while he struggled his fly and the tube top open.
“Yoohoo!” she calls, letting herself into the house through the kitchen doors, reminding John that he hadn’t even checked the doors were locked last night.
lying on the sofa with his fingers steepled under his chin establishes that his attention is simply and wholly distracted by John’s ridiculous embargo on their proto-relationship.
Christ! John is doing a better job of  depressing himself  than the miserable sight of the garden is. He gives himself a shake and goes off in search of the  main electrical switch panel to see if the lack of power is an internal problem or one he will need help with.
"Hmm, that would be… First? You said, ’first’ boyfriend,” Sherlock says.
Mycroft tips his head and contemplates his brother. "I saw your doctor looking for you."
“Adore you,” Sherlock mutters and turns to watch the hopelessly infatuated smile that breaks across John’s face.
They’re banging on the door, though John remembers that the door had already been blown in when they took cover here.
“His violin… and you, Dr Watson.”
John finishes his coffee, takes a deep breath and marches back into the house. He finds an old notepad and a biro and sits down at the kitchen table to draw a rough outline of the garden with the beds and the trees he can identify and the rosemary that has spread unchecked and the places where the paths have been obscured by weeds and he can only tell that there used to be one there by the solid feel of the ground underfoot.
John flusters to put down his plate and… blackcurrant jam? He doesn’t even like blackcurrant jam. He turns to find bread to put in the toaster, but quickly gives the whole scene up as a bad job to rest his palms on the counter, counting his breaths, facing away from Sherlock’s dagger-sharp gaze. Seconds tick by, each more reluctant to arrive than the last. John cannot find a single thing to say that won’t be incriminating, a deflection or an unwilling admission.
This isn’t enough data for Sherlock to discern what it is John owes him an apology for. Rather than forge ahead with dismissive platitudes or blank incomprehension, he simply leans back against the kitchen counter and waits.
“I was just wondering when you’d be back,” John asks with a patient smile.
At last the song is done and Martha watches as the last phrases of it dissipate, trickling away like sparks along the ceiling, fading into the shadows of the corners of her sitting room and sinking trills into the floorboards, leaving an echo singing down through her skin and into her bones, warm and comforting. It wasn’t a summoning she’d sung before and it had taken very easily, which probably had more to do with the two idiots who lived upstairs than with the complexity of the charm. Half of it had been common sense, with hardly a hint of craft to it. Put any other two people who had shared so much and who obviously loved each other as deeply as John and Sherlock did and she wouldn’t have needed to do anything – they would have sorted it out for themselves. But if there was a way of making his fate difficult, then her Sherlock could find it. She’d expected better things of John Watson though – he’d seemed such a practical chap. But they’d both turned out to be woefully dim in this case.
Confusion is swiftly spreading into concern and John sits up wondering that his words have met with such an odd response this morning.
“And…” John gestures, his voice quiet and patient, “… this is the part where you tell me you love me.”
"I suppose we had better make an appearance or tongues will begin to wag," Sherlock finally mutters, stroking a hand down John's thigh. "You need another bath," he observes and his smug reaches new heights. John just rolls his eyes at him and hoists himself up to standing and then into the bathroom.
John took another handful of lube and reached around to where Sherlock’s solid cock bobbed and strained before him, the touch of it hot and slick in John’s fist. He gripped tightly, just below the crown where Sherlock was most sensitive.
And what do you say to that? John is utterly disarmed by Violet's words. He can see so much of Sherlock in his mother's practical but kindly manner. She doesn’t suffer fools, Mrs Holmes, but she knows when something is good.
Sherlock takes a tiny peck at the fragrant red sauce that coats the spoon held to his mouth. John looks at him expectantly and Sherlock slowly licks all traces of it from his lips and lets the complexity of the flavours develop before he swallows. Tomato, balsamic vinegar, onion – no, shallots – and tarragon.
caught on to it and is on board with the plan to horrify his brother. Things like this – these are the reasons that Sherlock loves John as he does. Deeply. Boundlessly. Unceasingly.
“Sherlock Holmes. Look it up. Now!” His command echoes strangely in the dead air of the quiet hospital punctuated by the smack of his hand on the desk. The night staff jump in shock, but they don’t seem to understand that this is critical. Sherlock needs him and they are
John swallowed. “What did you…? Where did you get…?”
It all goes a bit quiet for a second, then there’s the sound of John giggling quietly.
John quirks a lip in amusement – Sherlock has clearly passed today’s test by remembering the name of one of the members of Lestrade’s team.
There’s a soft thud and everything goes muffled for a moment. And then there’s more fumbling and John’s voice is much quieter; Sherlock has to concentrate to hear him.
It hurts more than Sherlock can say. Literally.
For a perfect moment John imagines something has settled upon him – something like serenity, and an acceptance of what it has taken to achieve it – a lightning flash of where he’s always meant to be, no matter that it has taken him longer to find his way here than it might have. He feels words rise, like a flock of roused starlings, innumerable but of one mind. They push against his breath, against his tongue, seeking shape and sound.
“It’s an Italian restaurant we sometimes used to go to. Sherlock’s favourite place.”
Or who? Male or female?
“And what do I give in return?”
happening, and John cannot squash the sensation. It lodges under his ribs and flutters in his stomach.
“I suppose so, but… Sherlock, I don’t know what you’re thinking, but these things are usually more… organic than that.”
Scraping together the last of his control, knowing that he will not last and that this little celebration will be over, John pulls Sherlock back up to kiss him deeply, and while he's still settling, he twines his leg over Sherlock's and flips them. The taller man lets out a satisfying, "Oof," as he lands on his back with an armful of horny, happy fiancé.
With sudden intent, Sherlock goes to the kitchen and grabs the teapot and one of Mrs Hudson’s ceramic casserole dishes. He stands in the centre of the sitting room and hefts one, then the other. Dropping the teapot on the chair, Sherlock swings his arm, building up momentum, then at the perfect moment, just before the top of the arc, he releases the dish at the window.
"Dr Watson, would join us?" Mycroft asks formally.
“I was wondering if you fancied…” John managed before his brain helpfully shut down.
"One night stands or relationships?"
The relief is like the warmth of a mouthful of good brandy, rushing through him and reaching every cold place in his body at once.
Sherlock takes his coat from its peg and with one last glimpse of his life here, he walks to the door, grits his teeth and pulls it open.
It's too much, and having been somewhat keyed up already, it isn't long before John is rising onto his toes, trying to force more of himself into Sherlock's firm fist. He's so close,
“The game isn’t over when one of us falls down. Relationships don’t come with guarantees but I will promise you this; it will take more than one insult or one strop or one argument to make me rethink throwing in my lot with you. It’s been widely discussed that I am an idiot, and there might be some truth in that, but I’m here now… still, ready to make this commitment. Things will go wrong – it’s not supposed to be easy but I won’t make you guess. I will do whatever I can to make this work, and I will tell you if it isn’t so we can fix it. No mind games. No guessing. No lies.”
"Righty-ho!" John scrapes a smile and goes back to his packing.
"He's not gay. He's said so several times," Sherlock blurts and rebukes himself immediately. Could he have shown his hand any more obviously? And it's not a lie - early in their friendship John claimed several times in Sherlock's hearing that he was not gay when people made stupid assumptions about the two of them. He never challenged Sherlock to deny it, but his own denials were strenuous enough that people accepted it without question. He hasn't said it in some time now, even when the idiots see them together and make their erroneous judgements. It's one of the things that has made Sherlock wonder if perhaps there might be a place for him in John's life that is more than he already is.
But Sherlock was already disappearing into the bathroom leaving a trail of clothes in his wake, his own and John’s, with an entirely
John walks back upstairs and resolutely ignores the conversation he’s just had. He decides to spend time answering some of the comments on his blog. He doesn't like to put up a new post until he's finished answering comments on the last one, and if, as he suspects, Sherlock has a juicy new story for him to draft, he ought to spend some time tidying up the page. He works his way through them without much enthusiasm, feeling guilty that he’s not more grateful for the time people took to comment, even the slightly crazy ones.
Sherlock? John opens his eyes. The flash of artillery is still lighting up the sky sporadically, but Sherlock needs to get inside or they’ll find him for sure.
“How are you?” Sherlock rumbles, his voice low and soft.
"Sh!" John hisses, half in earnest but unable to keep the grin off his lips and the twinkle out of his eye. "This is my last chance to have my wicked way with you before you make an honest man of me."
“I’ve only met them a couple of times – and then only for a few minutes, and asking Sherlock was pointless…”
John’s love? Could John have loved him despite his single-mindedness and his obsessive drive to solve the cases that Lestrade brought him? Was there even space for a relationship in the way Sherlock led his life? The evidence of this room rather suggested there was – or that he thought there was. It appears he has filed away that love like any simple, concrete fact of their shared life.
"Long enough to... be inspired?" John asks. Even without meaning to, he has settled himself back on their pillows and his hips are already making minute aborted thrusts as he watches Sherlock's hand flatten and begin to smooth over his fancy underpants.
Sherlock nods again. He can feel despair rolling off John in waves – it’s in the hollow pitch of his voice and the bleak curve of his shoulders.
“Yes, well, I wouldn’t be much of a detective otherwise, would I?”
John kissed him then, to bring him back gently. He stripped off his jumper and shirt, lay down beside Sherlock and took his pleasure-slackened lips with his own. Sherlock responded with slow, soft kisses at first, which gradually became more interested as he ran his hands over John’s body to where he needed them most.
The giant berk doesn’t even bother to open his eyes, let alone look remorseful and John feels his patience wearing ever more dangerously thin.
“Expensive, was it?” John asks meanly, locking eyes with his best-friend’s brother, earning him a beat of silence and a flicker of irritation, quickly smoothed away.
Another stolen glance at John provides little more information of a useful nature. (He already knows how fetching the grey beginning to streak his hair is and how very expressive and mobile John's lips are, even when he's silent.) Whatever it is that’s bothering him, this isn't the start that Sherlock was hoping for really, and it doesn't bode well for the rest of their visit. Sherlock prudently decides to remain quiet until he has more data rather than risk making John's mood worse.
John sighs and looks at his hands, lying in his lap.
Leaning over him, braced on one hand, John encircles Sherlock’s cock and works him with long, fast strokes, knowing that it won’t take much in the way that Sherlock arches his spine, and pumps his hips into John’s fist. His hands smack down on the bed and grip hard when John’s thumb rubs rough circles just beneath the slit, spreading the moisture that leaks copiously from him now.
The slightest shake of his head and John gusts out a heavy breath.
“This is madness. I can’t believe I’m even considering it.”
Of course he cannot get away with that here and he mostly hums along getting a twitch of a smile from Sherlock because of it. They go straight into
Of course, the fact that it was the winter solstice had been in their favour.
Sally rolled her eyes at him and Sahai looked relieved, then tipped her head.
“Ones with a decent provenance and pedigree are.”
“Try to see this from my perspective, Sherlock. My own feelings aside, your entire outlook has changed and the catalyst for that was the explosion and your injuries. You have to admit, to take it at face value, that is an incredible coincidence. I can’t just sign myself up for this new you without knowing that it really is you saying these things. Wanting… what you want.”
He doesn’t have to.
“The thing is… there’s something I’ve been meanin’ to say. To you. F’r alongtime.”
Sherlock, however, has already ripped off the snowman wrapping paper and is admiring a rather nice scarf.
boyfriend and once more thanking whatever trick of fate it was that allowed them to be there in that moment, right then.
After John's discovery things could go in any direction, up to and including nowhere. Can John hold things together knowing what he knows or will Sherlock end things before they have had a chance to grow?
For a couple of moments John thinks he’ll vomit. It’s all too similar. The feelings of foreboding, of something
"It's a bit of a tradition now. He says it makes up for having a birthday so close to Christmas."
Beware of upcoming rating change and additional tags - love is in the air... and snow, but John has to get there first.
Finally the singers, reluctant and otherwise, are called to order. John and Sherlock manage to find places at the back of the group. The organiser announces their first song and off they go.
"That was your preference or just what was immediately available?"
Naps can wait.
John hums and lifts his chin to give Sherlock more access. “It’s never a hardship to hear that your boyfriend loves you, no matter how many times you’ve heard it before.”
“It’s Doctor, actually but please call me John.”
“Cause of death?” he barked, his voice oddly flat, picking out one of the pile and holding it up for John’s attention. "Or post-mortem injury?"
"Hello!" she smiles. "I thought you might be here too."
The waiter returns, all smiles and positive energy giving them both a much needed reprieve from John's last sentence.
Within a couple of minutes of mouth-watering, slick sounds, Sherlock’s stomach muscles were tensing, his hips surging up to meet his fist. He clearly needed more room to work as he pushed the pants lower still, uncovering the glorious sight of his cock, leaking thick drops, which pooled on his belly. He was using the short, brutal strokes that he liked when he was getting close. Shoulders pressed into the mattress and head tipped back, his spine arched and fell, arched and fell, each punctuated with whispered groans and harsh breaths.
“How was he?” she asks softly.
He taps his hands on the arms of his chair and unfolds himself to stand.
Sherlock should leave it like that. This is his opportunity. He will walk away and John will wait for Sherlock to contact him, will wait for a call that Sherlock will never make. Weeks will become months and months years and the details will soften - the exact shade of John’s eyes, bluer under a grey sky - the way his mouth gives him away, no matter how inscrutable his eyes or his jaw or his stance - the exact tone of his voice when he is hurting and putting on a show to distract others from knowing it. And one day, without him noticing, Sherlock will have lost enough of the clarity so that he will have to stop and think about those details. Little things first, things that he has hoarded up to now - what stitch John’s favourite jumper was knitted in, his favourite chocolate bar, the name of his first girlfriend.
The house is falling quiet now, just the click of doors closing and the occasional swish of plumbing. It's peaceful but John imagines that the hush is watching, almost expectantly. It reminds him of Christmas Eve already - not the ones of late with telly and take away, or snatching a break between patients in an airless field hospital and only vaguely remembering the date, but like it did when he was a child. It's the thrill of a Christmas when there was still a bit of magic to believe in, when, even though he knew it was rubbish, he would write a letter and send it to Lapland anyway - just in case. Like then, tonight feels like something is going to happen or is
“Since before he came here?” John suggests.
“Honestly, you're such a cock sometimes. Why not just tell me it was your dad's birthday?"
The night of John's wedding had probably been the lowest point of his life, and that's from a man who has overdosed three times. He'd buried everything that day behind the veneer of being Sherlock Holmes - it was what everyone had expected to see, so that part hadn't been hard. But earlier that day he had been the Sherlock Holmes watching the dawn creep into his room like a thief, stealing the last minutes that John could ever conceivably be thought of as his. He'd been the Sherlock Holmes looking into John's eyes when he’d woken with a brief soft smile on his lips before he'd registered the time and the day and the circumstances of him being at Baker Street in Sherlock's bed.
"You are quite clearly getting me undressed."
"I didn't know your dad was a musician. You never said," John says, impressed and wondering how that list of relations constitutes 'dull'.
John is about to complain that no one should be mentioning Sherlock's brother in such a compromising position as this, and bemoaning the fact that a man cannot be expected to maintain a sufficient level of interest in proceedings when the British Government is only a few metres away, but Sherlock chooses that moment to run a slick bottom lip across the head of John's cock, then open his mouth and take him in.
The water isn't too hot in the way that Sherlock normally takes his bath, but it's comfortable in the warm bathroom, and the window is ajar letting in the sweet scented air from the garden and the growing murmur of the guests. Sherlock taps his fingers in time to the music being played by the string quartet, running through what must be the violin fingering on John's leg.
The toast pops and makes him jump. John ignores it for a minute, walking to the garden door and peering out. It doesn’t look like there’s too much damage, though he can see a few things that will need some minimal attention later on. The sky is full of scattered cloud now, moving fast and high, chasing the storm as it rolls north. The sun is intermittent, blinking on and off across the garden, warm in the glare but quick to cool when the clouds go over.
John is so thrilled to see his husband, tired and testy, but safe and on his way home, he's completely forgotten the date.
Sherlock's head jerks up and his eyes get an assessing look about them.
"Is this a good idea?" John asks. For all that there is a very willing, beautiful man in his arms, there are also most of said beautiful man's extended family arriving downstairs, more and more of them with each passing moment.
The liver sees its opportunity and makes a frankly filthy squelch as it slaps down onto the kitchen table, quivering with delight at its newfound freedom.
His voice, although little more than a whisper, was wrecked, emotion evident in each word in a way that John had once doubted him capable.
Okay, that wasn't so bad, John thinks, so he moves to the wardrobe and pulls the double doors open. A mirror on the back of one door reflects John's furtive face as he runs his hands over Sherlock's perfectly hung jackets and trousers, and the shirts still in their thin plastic sheaths from the dry cleaner. There's very little variation in Sherlock's wardrobe - nothing you might call casual. Sherlock either wears a suit or his pyjamas - there's no middle ground with him, which is more interesting than it should be, but John is not sure why or what it means.
“I will go and apologise to Mrs Turner later. In the meantime I want to talk to you,” John says. “I have a horrific hangover this morning, but I also have enough recollection about last night to know that I was not completely unintelligible and that I have said something that has rattled you.”
“Now what?”
Whether that equates to stability or forever or anything else is not something he can predict - but the alternative, to part ways permanently, well, if this transition is painful it is a pain with a purpose, it is them trying, them holding on; it is the possibility of a future.
They re-dressed in silence, sharing lingering touches and
Alternating between hanging his head between his arms and letting it loll back against John, Sherlock was soon keening again, the muscles in his thighs tightening with John’s in counterpoint to the delicious sounds of John’s hips smacking Sherlock’s edible arse. Unable to widen his stance because of the fatigues, Sherlock had to work his hips hard to get as much of John as he seemed to want, and John wasn’t complaining on that front at all.
John thought about this for a moment. It was a nice day, the sun was shining, London was doing its thing outside the window of 221B Baker Street and currently had no need of the world’s only consulting detective and his sidekick – he had time to consider his response.
Mycroft sets his cup back down and regards John calmly. “When it became clear that our options in Moriarty’s game had narrowed considerably, my brother gave me a list of tasks to perform if he… in his absence. Most were quite brief and out of obligation I would imagine; naturally Mrs Hudson’s wellbeing, the rent on 221B, informing our parents – all very practical. His violin, however, had a list of requirements that were specific to the point of obsession. I shan’t bore you with the details, but it seemed that there were only two things that Sherlock struggled to leave behind, that he felt he had to instruct me in person on their care while he was gone.”
His hair in disarray, Sherlock pokes his head back around the door and grabs his dressing gown off the peg. “Likewise,” he declares and narrows his eyes at John. “Don’t go anywhere,” he warns and disappears in a swirl of midnight silk.
They smirk at each other and Sherlock feels his spirits rise. John
’, it’s only fine if it’s not...” his roughened voice cracks and he has to try again, “…not you?”
“Over by the desk – the light is better there,” John suggested, standing up and moving back, letting a little of what he was thinking reach his eyes.
"Show me, Sherlock. Pull them down far enough that I can see you."
“Where else would I be?” John slurs. Sherlock finally relaxes and the peace rests on them, like another layer of silence until John adds, “Idiot.”
"Breakfast first," Sherlock scowls. "With the family I suspect."
John listens as Sherlock thumps his pillows into place and lays down. The little noises of his body settling into the mattress, the scritch as he tackles an itch on his jaw, the sweep of the material of his pyjamas against the sheets are a comfort and torment. Despite the cold air coming in through the cracked open window, familiar scents come to John's attention; shampoo, toothpaste and something that stokes that warmth in his belly into a brighter, hotter flame, something that is unmistakably Sherlock. It seems to be hard wired into John's subconscious - it used to mean
>>>>><<<<<
He swallows down the wince when he realises what he has said and catches Mycroft giving him a quick glance which turns into an eye roll - damn the Holmes brothers for being so ridiculously observant and astute.
Sherlock nods and screws the jar closed, passing it to John who still hasn’t said a word.
“At least we found a use for your hideous shirt.”
And of course, John had to kiss him then.
“Bring it over here,” the man says quietly, moving a few paces back onto the path. John follows and lowers the box down where indicated, and they both step away.
He’s afraid of trying to converse with John for fear that he might do something wrong, say the wrong thing and drive him even further away. Sherlock has revealed his deepest self, bared his soul to himself in his head now, and he fears more than anything the possibility that he might repeat these revelations  and fracture their relationship by not being in control of his own speech. His inappropriate words might have betrayed him before, but now he’s also at the mercy of the aftereffects of the injury.
