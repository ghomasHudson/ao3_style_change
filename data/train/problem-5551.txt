“If I recall our time at the Tower, you didn’t either.” Steve smiles at the memory of burnt omelettes. “But you learned,” Steve points out, leaning against the counter, observing how at home Tony is opening and closing drawers and dumping the used pans into the industrial sinks.
He reached for the bottle of soap for the first time in three years, flicking the cap open. Steve breathed the smell of lemon blossoms as it filled the bathroom. He squirted some of the body wash onto his palm, squeezing with more strength than usual. Unused for years, the lid was slightly clogged.
If all Steve had was a shadowed version of Tony, one that continued to live in memory, he’d take it. If he moved on, he was scared he’d stop thinking of Tony. Could he be forgiven when he didn’t feel fucked up with misery? It didn’t mean forgetting. He couldn’t even bury Tony. He wasn’t going to start now.
Steve shifts up, spreading Tony’s legs wide, opening him up in a way he can never have again.
He asked Tony before, if this was always the view from the sky, flying with the armor, and Tony answered,
“Yeah, yeah, Captain America is here, don’t get so excited. We’re hunting for HYDRA now.”
At a street corner, Tony caught the sign down a subway station, pausing for a beat.
Steve,
My muscles are used to this. They’re loose from Steve’s careful fingers. He always wants to stretch me open because he’s afraid to hurt me. He tells me he wants to make me feel good and he wants to make sure I want it.
“Ok, then. Room 305.” She eyes them for a beat too long then shrugs, offers the keys, and returns to poke at her phone.
He went on about his day, cleared the plates off from the kitchen table, washed the dishes, dried them, then stacked them inside the cabinet. He washed the mug then placed them on the dish rack.
You are.
Steve finally breaks a sweat. We’ve been going at this for a while. He needs to work it out. He needs this body, this face, this brain. He craves this voice. That’s why I’m here.
“I shouldn’t —“
Steve’s mouth is open and his pupils are dilated. He’s keeping still, ceding to Tony’s control. For once.
“Yeah, it’s his favorite.” Peter turned to him, his black tie unknotted and skewed.
—and Rumiko’s teasing voice responding—
“Good, good Tony.”
Well, Steve wouldn’t really know this other than the fact that JARVIS monitored anything related to Tony Stark and gave Steve a summary of it every morning. It began after Tony was diagnosed for the first time. He never asked JARVIS to stop even when Tony went into remission. The AI’s daily precis provided an overview of Tony’s health levels, his calendar, and any news related to SI, Avengers, and Tony himself.
“Why?” Riri asks.
There’s no explanation, and when questioned, they simply explained waking up by the dam with no memory of how they got there.
“Now, now,” Steve says with a teasing grin. “We all know you preferred MJ, but…”
Tony eats it up because there’s almost nothing else left but this warped determination to fuck each other good. Just for tonight. He sticks out his tongue, knowing he probably looks wanton, but Steve’s always liked him that way, looser, less in control. Steve takes his cock—half hard now, and getting harder again—dabs the head on Tony’s awaiting tongue. Once, twice, then he’s coating Tony’s lips with the taste of him again.
“And I know you, Tony,” Steve exhales, feeling like they’re in the verge of something important here.
“Sometimes I can’t believe I’m here. In this house, sharing a bed with you. How did I get so lucky?” Tony sighs and flutters his eyes open.
And it’s not enough.
“Yeah.” Steve scrubs a hand through his hair. “Guess it’s still stuck.”
“Well it is your birthday. As your husband, it’s my duty to throw you a party because I’m thoughtful like that.”
Steve is turning him onto his back, then covering his body, a hulking mass of sheer strength. He kisses Tony’s bruised cheekbones.
“I do,” Steve nodded, looking at Bucky in the simulation room. He was in a HYDRA facility, arms tied to a chair, gritting his teeth.
“Let’s be scared together?” Tony grins and presses a kiss on Steve’s mouth.
With anticipation, he curls his toes, hitches his legs up higher, one foot planting firmly on the bed, while the other hits Steve's back. "More, Steve, please, come on.”
“Men are fools when it comes to love.” Red Wolf nods with a resigned half-smile. “You alright, Stark? You’ve been distracted. Perhaps, a trip to the healer might do you some good?”
As a boy, he egged Bucky to jump into the freezing waters at Coney Island in the middle of a harsh winter. Responsibility has never been his strong suit, especially not in the face of a challenge. Steve had shivered on the subway ride home and promptly got pneumonia.  He was so sure that his mother would fry him and never let him out of the apartment again.
“Are you seriously gonna marry me because Tony’s goading you?” Sam smacks Bucky’s side, but there’s an expression of awe on his face.
Left hand on the steering wheel. Years of driving through the snow has taught him a little bit about control.
And yet. He’s here. Steve’s not ready to think about that. He’s not ready to lose him just yet.
Tony hunches his shoulders, wraps his arms over his torso, and briskly walks to the hotel. Steve has only one single thought throughout their short journey: peel off his jacket, give it to Tony, but he’d likely start another row. It isn’t his place now.
It’s been three difficult years.
There's Bernie Tolliver and his ugly green coat with stains and holes on the cuff. Protect something, he had said, it gives meaning to your life. Tony tried. He did. He saw the future and knew what was coming. Tony had an imperfect solution, but it was a long con, and players like him had to roll on the dice.
“Right.” The Snap. “I hope it is.”
Harley and Peter were chatting with the Bartons by the fireplace, faces animated. Steve picked up a few scientific words which just went over his head.
She guides his hand down Tony’s ass and thighs, both of them feeling Tony’s warm skin. Goosebumps erupt, and of
Tony shakes his head. There’s a small, affectionate smile on his face. “No thanks needed, darling.”
All these shady, underhanded points have crossed his mind, but like most men, Steve didn’t trace the connections until it affected him and punched him in the face.
“God, Tony, what the fuck.” Steve settled on the bed as the doctors left. Outside the door, the active Avengers were milling, concerned. Steve shook his head as Natasha popped her head through the doorway. “Just…give us a few minutes, Nat.”
Rumiko is groaning and there's the sound of him fucking Tony open. It's too much. Steve wraps an arm around Tony, a mimicry of what Rumiko did earlier. He wants to rewrite the whole night. Lie to himself, ignore the voice in his head telling him that he's only here because she requested it. Allowed it.
Tony sees Steve's shiny boots until he crouches to the ground, and then all that’s left are those stupid green trousers that should be blue.
“How about we don’t keep it a secret? I want to tell the world that you're taking my last name.” Tony smiled so wide, his eyes were crinkled. He laughed and pulled Steve up for a kiss.
With that, Tony turns back to his workshop, slams the door shut, and stares at the armor with blurry eyes, and bites down the bile rising from his throat.
“So, this is why you’re drinking again,” Steve decided, like this explained it. “Is this penance, Tony? Is this so you could forget? If you keep drinking, you’ll kill yourself.”
Tony would like to tear it from his hands, break it, bend it, stomp on it, burn it until nothing is left. Maybe throw it to the hog and watch the pigs eat through the metal.
Steve steps out of the barn and walks the short distance towards the house. He finished the outdoor bathroom just a few weeks ago, when spring was maturing into summer. There’s a trellis that serves as a partial roof, with the actual roofing underneath it. The ivys cascade down the side of the side walls, and there, by the left side of the bathroom hangs another bird feeder.
I look at this stupid window and hope Namor took care of your body. You’re at peace. Wherever you are.
A waitress bustles over, distracting him from what he knows is a grim road. She is dancing across the cafe’s narrow stairs with practiced ease, a tray tucked to the side of her torso. She’s laughing at someone two tables down, and quickly responding to questions from a man smoking a long wooden pipe. She turns to Steve, smiles, and sets the plate down, and tells him he really should have ordered the mint tea instead of the coffee, as it’s their specialty.
“A lot happening for a small town,” Tony says, observing a family crossing the street and a couple with three Labradors being pulled in the other direction.
They climb the stairs. Tony’s hand rests on the banister, and Steve lets himself appreciate the view, just for a little bit.
Christmas Eve dinners at the Tower had grown exponentially in the past decade. Whereas Tony and Steve used to keep it amongst the original Avengers during their tenure as superheroes, now the Tower’s dining table had to be enlarged at least three times its size. Tony had a fit about the New Avengers, retired Avengers, and their family coming all together for the holidays. The man loved to hold court and pretend he was disgruntled.
Skyscrapers loomed against the night sky and he couldn’t help but think that he should be out there. Running missions, enduring a debrief from the fallout of his tenure at SHIELD, or something as simple as flying in the suit.
Tony hummed, eyes closed like he’s on the edge of falling asleep. “I don’t know about that, Steve.”
God, Logan and Peter can’t smell them. And the Tower is empty with just Tony’s old ghosts reminding him of his failure, haunting the halls.
I think you might be pissed at me. I shot my own foot today, or I guess, sometime yesterday.  Don’t worry, it’ll grow back. What a day, old pal. It makes me want to believe in God. I got to sleep now.
“Oh, Saturday Night by The London Suede.” Tony places the spoon into the sink and opens several cabinets, back turned away from Steve. “I could have sworn it was in that playlist I made you.”
“I’d say welcome back, but…”
Tony’s hand has migrated to pull Steve’s face, trailing open mouthed kisses on his neck, pushing his t-shirt down so Tony could reach the upper corners of his pecs. Steve pushes him back, grinding their bodies closer, until they’re pressed from hip to hip, no inch of their bodies left untouched. Steve’s large hands are on the back of his neck, squeezing, asking. Just one hopeful look from Steve and everything unravels.
It’s on me.
It took Steve almost an hour to shave it this morning. Steve set the razor down dozens of times, then picked it up again. The cream on his jaw had turned too soft. He kept looking at the mirror, wondering what Tony would say about his fresh face. He didn’t have a sharp jaw like Tony, but Steve’s been told he’s got a strong chin.
“Yes, yes, your husband is the best.” Bucky waves a hand and snorts.
“I left the Captain America mantle behind.”
Steve grimaces, heat rising to his neck. He’s ready to defend his actions. He hasn’t done anything spectacular to write home about, but he’s proud of what he’s done, even if he knows it’s not enough.
He stared at the razor, unused for three years now.
She glanced away and waved the kids over for a hug. Over the years, she became freer with her affection. Steve didn’t know if that was because she couldn’t have kids because of the experimentation in the Red Room.
Steve glanced down. Inside the folder was Tony's will and insurance policy.
He pulled Tony closer and squeezed his middle, humming.
“That’s your decision.”
It’s only after a beat and Tony’s acknowledgement that Steve turns away. It’s terrifying to be here. In this space. Tony’s refuge. He feels like a trespasser now.
Steve’s lips twisted into a rotten smile.
When he wasn’t on a mission, Steve’s days were split between his desk and departmental meetings. Sometimes he suspected Fury only hired him for public relations purposes. Captain America belonged to SHIELD; Captain America was keeping the country safe.
This is my punishment.
They haven’t talked, not really. But for once, Steve is alright with waiting.
“No, I didn’t.”
delete delete delete.
Natasha bit her lip, smudging her nude lipstick. “Sometimes people aren’t ready for love. But I don’t think any of us are ever ready for loss no matter how much we try to prepare ourselves.”
“I think…”
Steve stepped back, admired the Pothos without all the brown leaves drooping down. The sun shone through the large windows in the living room, catching on the picture frames and the bamboo flooring.
“You know, with the serum and all, I’m not one for forgetting. Did you plan something without telling me?” Steve turns to his husband and crosses his arms in mock playfulness.
I’m forgetting things. More things.
She’s so much like Tony, and some days, he sees Pepper, too.
He got the kill shot and the media broadcasted it live. Those damned hacks, they could have died flying their stupid helicopter out there in the line of battle. But whatever sells, right? They seized the fucking Tower, too. Osborn says that Tony Stark has been infected with a Skrull virus and all his decisions as Director are shit. Osborn tells the media that I tried to negotiate with the Skrulls. That I knew beforehand.
As if reading his mind, Sam replies, “he can take care of himself. Rhodes and Carol are there too when the munchkins get too much. And I’m not talking about Morgan, I’m talking about Thor and Peter. Now come on, you’re gonna show us your favorite spots.”
He no longer had hope for reaching a shore.
“That’s fine,” Steve replies.
It would have been better if it was Steve. If it was Steve, he wouldn’t have to deal with waking up in the middle of the night and sobbing until his chest felt numb. Maybe that’s selfish, because how would Tony deal if Steve died? Would he move on? Would he remarry? He has always been a stronger man than Steve. He would be fine.
“That’s the idea, boys,” Tony says, keeping Steve’s head exactly where it is.
, wants to praise Tony, want to tell him how beautiful he is and how Steve's always wanted this. But Tony will hear his voice, and that can't be, because it's against the rules. Rumiko might as well have taken a knife and removed his vocal chords.
“Ours, baby.” Tony lifted Peter from the crib, rocking him side to side. “Do you want to hold him?”
“Hello,” Steve says.
In the moment, it gave Steve some peace of mind that he was in control. He was the one choosing to sever ties and forcefully erase Tony Stark’s mark in his life. Never mind that just weeks later, he succumbed and sent a half-baked letter that failed to communicate what he truly meant.
You’ve always listened.
Motion sickness was due to the body’s confusion between perceived movement and actual, physical movement. The body thinks it ingested a toxic substance and tries to expel it by inducing vomiting.
It’s slow moving, but the blood on his hands are green.
Who are they without the chase and that hunger for a future, a better, brighter tomorrow? They call him a futurist, but Tony can’t predict where they’ll end up. If it’ll be Steve six feet under in Arlington, or him, burning with the rest of his machines.
With a pinched expression, Pepper handed him a set of flowers. Carnations.
What’s his in the meantime. Because tomorrow—
He’s learning to forgive himself. It’s hard work, living with yourself and your grief everyday. But here he is, and as if to remind himself of undeserved second chances, he replaces his finger with his mouth and kisses the jagged line of Tony’s shoulder.
Tony bites his lips and doesn’t say the words out loud because he knows Steve will walk out the door come morning. He’ll wear the suit and patrol the streets with the rest of the New Avengers, and the next time Tony will see him, they’ll fuck again. Only this time, the cuts are meant to hurt, and they might not pull back.
Steve cleared his throat, looking at the crow prancing around in the corner of his eyes. They’ve been working together as Avengers for a year and a half now. They’ve built the Compound together, brick by brick. Streamlined the potential new Avengers into the program by offering training and applications to interested superheroes.
“No, never,” Tony said, watching as Steve visibly sagged with relief.  “I should be asking you that.”
“He sure knows how to make an appearance,” Carol says with an eyeroll. She passes the bowl of chili to Bucky’s waiting fingers.
“Yeah.”
Returning to the bedroom, he entered the en-suite bathroom, dug around for cleaning supplies. He scrubbed the tub and toilet, got on his hands and knees to make sure all the soap scum from the shower’s tiles were cleaned.
But Steve isn’t like Tony, and it’s been too long, so he lets himself have this: he lets his mind take in the new changes in Tony, listing the way he seems infinitely lighter, as if he isn't struggling with the fall out of the Snap.
Steve is cuffed.
Steve sat up, grinning at Tony. “Stay here for a second.”
He’s a scum who can’t help but pretend this is Steve. If he ignores the welts on his back and the broken ribs and the split lip and the fracture on his skull, he can imagine that they’re a younger version of themselves living in ease at Fifth Avenue.
They’re all still grieving. Losing a parent was a cut that never scabbed over. You kept bleeding and bleeding. Steve would know, Sarah and Joseph Rogers died before he was seventeen. He wished he could take the misery away from his kids’ faces.
“Still here.”
“Oh save it, honey.” He waves a hand and blows out a sigh dramatically. “I know. The heart is ruled by this foolish thing called love.”
But then, Tony offered a gauntlet hand then Steve laughed, and took it, and he laughed even more as Tony spun circles in the sky on their flight upstate.
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’m fine.”
He rode the train so long that twice, he watched the same set of teenage kids dancing around the poles, trying to make tips from the subway riders. He sat still, hands laced on his lap, fingers massaging the space in the middle of his palm. Irritated, annoyed, trying to find purpose in a life barely lived.
To set roots. He knows too well once that happens, it’s hard to grow again.
He yanked himself away from her grip, pushing his body further into the bed. She grabbed his forearms and dug her fingers on the nails until they surpassed the soft issue and lodged into his bone.
He watches Steve, cataloguing changes in his gait. There’s still that small scar on the corner of his mouth. Tony doesn’t believe in magic. He’s only persuaded by the observation, by seeing things in material forms.
He refused to budge. “I got it.”
Eden sighed heavily. “Like Imogen, I also went on a date. Uh, the other day. First time in forever and then I started crying before the bill came. She asked about my interests and the first thing I thought of was my late wife.”
"The world loves him, huh?" Samuel nudges him with a sharp elbow. It's too familiar and Steve doesn't know how to react, so he falls on his usual response and offers a smile.
Tony returned the smile, affectionate. He grabbed Steve’s left ankle, kissed the soft jut of his bone, and hoisted it up to his shoulder before sliding back inside.
“It’s a hard act to walk the line you’re on, Tony. I respect that.”
“Steve, I’m fine. Honestly, this is nothing.”
“Hmm, give him some credit. He might enjoy it.”
Tony keeps his mouth shut.
But he didn’t dare move. He counted each of Tony’s breaths, in sync with his own heartbeat.
The faceplate smashed in half, coughing on a mouthful of blood.
Natasha never allows herself to
The sound washes over me and I focus on chasing orgasm instead. That’s what I can do. White out for a few moments, let this body do what it was meant to.
“Are you ready to do the presents?” Rhodes stood from his post and started to collect the rest of the dishes. “Carol really wants to give Morgan her present. You ready for that, Maguna?”
It feels like his body is on fire. He feels punch drunk, belly full of heavy whiskey, and suddenly, he’s letting go of the lead ropes, jumping down, and walking towards Steve in a trance.
Tony leans his cheeks on Steve’s hand. “Prove me right, then.”
Steve decides not to think about that. Nostalgia is dangerous for men already yearning. But he supposes he’s always been that sort of man: at once, he longed to return to the past, where he once thought he belonged. Now, he wants a future he has no means to ever have.
“And Nat?”
It felt like he was underwater, trapped under ice again. His neck felt stiff and vision blurry, so much so he couldn’t tell the difference between Scott Lang and Bucky in the corner of the room.
“Then, you shouldn’t have come. I lost him because of —”
“Alright, Cap,” I say exactly what he wants to hear, what he told me he likes.
See you
How many more? How many? How?
Steve added another finger, twisting and prodding Tony’s insides and taking his nipple between his teeth. He worked Tony open in slow thrusts, adding a third finger and more lube as he sucked hickeys all over Tony’s chest, preening at the marks. He kissed Tony’s sternum, free of the arc reactor, and pulled his fingers away.
Instead, she simply shook her head, tutted, and said, what are we gonna do with you, Steve? How he survived two weeks coughing and bed-ridden is another question. He used to be convinced his mother consulted a shaman up the street, but these days, he thinks the universe simply wants to test how many more bad decisions he can make in his lifetime.
Steve heard that somewhere once. Likely from Natasha, maybe even from Tony himself. It’s no wonder they wine-and-dine their business partners. But here and now, Tony’s offering a little part of him, and no matter how small, Steve will take it.
“We didn’t touch anything!” Harley replied, from a desk at the corner of the room. He pointed a wrench towards Morgan. “It was her idea.”
It’s shoddy and awful and he truly should be better at this for a grown man, but he stays in his spot, feet glued to the tiles. Paralyzed.
This is evidence of Tony’s sacrifice. This is why they have today, why the rest of them are still here, still breathing, living, making mistakes, apologizing, and trying to have hope all the same.
Steve pushes his plate back, recalling the time they went to visit Thor, who had spent months with Jane in New Mexico. He and Tony flew through the state, marveling at the Rocky Mountains.
She wrapped her arms around his shoulder and like so many times throughout the year, he bit his lip and tried not to call her Tony.
“You’re such a demanding little brat.”
But he didn’t know how to go on without Tony. His eyelids were so heavy and his chest ached. Steve didn’t remember dropping to the floor. At one moment his forehead was resting on the tiles, then he was sitting on the bathtub, one cheekbone on his knees, arms around his hairy shins. The water fell on his body, dropping over on his long hair.
“Ok.”
“I really am trying to make a better world, Tony.”
“Well, hey there, Captain Handsome.” Tony stood in the middle of the garden, hands on his hips. He took off his sunglasses and grinned at Steve. “I do like seeing my man all sweaty. I bet you smell good too.”
What do you want me to do with that, Tony doesn’t say. You’re gonna hurt me, I know.
“Together, my darling.”
There’s endless rooms in the little brownstone. Steve didn’t know where to go. He stood in the kitchen, motionless. He could escape and tell his children they’re moving away. Out of New York. Out of any place Tony’s ever been in.
She held up a hand, “No. You can’t tie your purpose to someone else. That’s what I’ve done. What I’m still doing.” She blew a frustrated sigh. “Sorry, being an asshole again.”
“Fuck if I know,” the man replies, wiping a line of sweat from his forehead. “Wouldn’t be out here  sweating and cursing if I knew how to fix this.”
“I can’t go, Steve. I have responsibilities here.” Tony gestures to the workshop, and Steve knows what he means is bigger than the width of this room. They need Tony here, in case there’s a miracle, and they somehow find a way to reverse the Decimation. There’s Riri and Kate who will miss him. Bruce and Nat and the rest of the world.
“You didn’t come here to talk about that. You don’t listen, Steve. I’m tired of trying to talk over you.”
“You should know I’ll do anything to please you, Sheriff.”
“He was always working. Couldn’t get him to join team dinners.”
“Steve, you practically live in my workshop. We fall asleep together on the couch all the time. You sit next to me at every meal, during debriefs. You hold the door open for me and you’re always staring at me.”
“Alright, pops,” Harley replied, pulling away to look at Steve. His eyes were a pale blue, like Steve’s. Sometimes he liked to think that Harley inherited the hue from him, even if they didn’t share the same blood. He opened the box and took the tag off. He placed it to the side after a beat, then nodded to Steve. “Thanks, dad, I guess. I’m—”
“They say holidays are hard.”
Steve responds well to it. He pulls me to his chest, kisses the top of my head, and dotes on me. He apologizes for holding the shield above my head.
That must be encouragement. I must be doing alright. This is all fine.
In the morning, Steve wakes to the sheets rustling, then feet padding to the bathroom.
He shakes his head. “You said it was well cared for. I trust your word.”
Natasha passes him a handful of blankets, a flashlight, and two gallons of water. Together, they fill the Land Cruiser with basic supplies. Inside, there’s a thick cot and a spartan pillow for when Steve needs to crash. His duffel bag and the shield follow in last. Steve reaches for the handle and slams the trunk shut with dreaded finality.
Steve nudges him on his back. The angle shifts with Steve momentarily hitting his prostate. Tony sees stars, whining when Steve moves away to position himself further between Tony’s legs. The fury from earlier pace simmers into something slow and too true. Steve looks into his eyes, whispering bullshit about how he loves Tony and they’ll make it work,
It was a Tuesday when SHIELD found him in the Arctic.
Steve knows that shade of blue, the way he knows that there's a latch on the back of the faceplate, the way he knows that Tony programmed override protocols with Steve’s special access code. He wants to pull Tony up and close until they’re breathing each other’s exhales, want to arrange Tony on his lap and have him sit on his cock and stay there, let Steve do all the work because Steve would take care of him, anticipate every hitch, every groan, would please him and fuck him until Tony knows it’s only Steve who can ever have him like this.
It was a mess. There was no time.
“Steve.”
“Tony.” Steve willed himself to calm down. There was no use in directing his anger at a man who’s already in the hospital. Still, Steve couldn’t help but feel annoyed. “You’re not supposed to make decisions like that without informing the team. You don’t leave without backup—”
Tony closes his eyes, breathes through his nose, loosens his jaw and lets Steve use his mouth like the whore he is.
The kids continue digging at their meal, the banter between all of them growing steadier and steadier with laughter and jabs.
The chair squeaked against the concrete flooring as Harley drove it beside Steve. “Pops.”
“Right there,
His mouth is dry. They should eat.
Steve took off the glasses and set it on the table. He waved a hand on the holoscreen to cancel the scene. It disappeared in a flash.
They were so plump and red, glistening with saliva.
“Sure, not yet, but you got your eyes on him.” Bucky snorted, then nodded. “I don’t remember much, but I’ve been trained to observe humans and find what’s valuable to them. Call it finding one’s incentive or motivation.”
“You sure your boyfriend or girlfriend won’t mind?”
Pain but no motor or vascular deficits, Extremis informed him. This was child’s play, a barely there snap to the bones. He was used to the smell of drying blood and the crunch of bones. He stopped Extremis from pushing out the thick nails and snapped three more down his forearms.
It was the only untouched part of the house. Every other corner and crevice of their home reminded him of Tony. Even when Steve closed his eyes, Tony was all he’d see.
“I learn more at home. It’s so basic. I’m just droning. I could teach the class myself, pops.” Harley sighed but took the proffered lunch bag.
Steve was the first face he saw, and Tony wondered, then, whether it was like this for Cap, all those years ago. A set of excited bodies hovering over his own, while ice melted from his uniform.
Life spun its webs around and around, and people somehow found a way to live.
Steve was helpless to watch Tony wince and adjust himself in a more comfortable position. He was throwing up the previous evening. Steve should have been more vigilant. They thought Tony had a reaction to last night’s take out. God, there were so many moments Steve should have checked on Tony. But everything seemed so normal.
If only stubborn will had the means to assure that.
“No, that’s not true.” He took Tony’s hand, focusing on the beat of his heart. “We choose. We can always choose.”
Outside, New York kept turning, but here was Steve’s entire world in a single room.
There was a rapt knock on the door. It must be the champagne. It had to be.
For earlier, Tony thinks. Then, Steve’s burying his face on Tony’s neck again, wet little kisses that almost mask the drips of his tears. Tony’s eyes hurt. He grabs Steve’s biceps, squeezes them, once, twice, and they have eyes on each other again, following each other’s slight movements, the rise and fall of their chests.
The train passed through.
“It wasn’t easy. Battle after battle. The Hulk inside. But maybe that monster’s just part of me, something I’m learning to live with.”
Hasn’t been home in a long time.
(See the end of the chapter for
People are stubborn, determined, and living willfully, maybe even out of spite, as if to tell the world,
Steve’s world trembled. Maybe his memory failed him. For all of Abraham Erskine's talk about enhanced memory, he wished he didn’t have to remember Tony this way: eyes closed, lips still plum and slightly blue. His body still. His chest and ribs no longer rising with every breath.
“Alright, okay.” Steve nodded, cradling Tony’s head and kissing him with all the hope and gratefulness he felt. “We have today and the rest of our lives.”
For his kids. Gone, Nat. You get that? I don’t know what to fucking do.”
That can’t be good for Samuel. Steve’s lucky he has the serum.
Peter’s been silent since they left the penthouse. He still had the glasses on. He hasn’t said a single word. Bruce and Bucky tried to engage him in a conversation, placing a glass of water in his hands and a plate of food on his lap.
Steve turned on the shower, setting the temperature to maximum heat. He jumped in, following his daily routine—shampoo, conditioner, soap.
A dream, I think.
“Yes, yes,” I repeat again and again. I moan. I groan. I get a hand on my cock and it finally begins to feel good.
“There’s work now,” she says, voice resigned. “Won’t you stay?”
“You ready?” Bucky nudges him forward but waits for no answer.
“Well,” Steve replies, cataloguing the changes in the Compound’s living room. The hole that was there years ago has been long repaired. The painting Steve hung is still above the fireplace. Cherry trees in bloom. Flowering before the fruits eventually blossomed.
A hand wraps around his nape, gripping the hairs there. Steve pulls, twisting his face back.
Tony likes to poke fun and call Steve a farmer now, but life on the farm isn’t easy. But the lake and the view sure do make up for it.
As if Tony’ s reading his thoughts, he cups Steve’s face with one hand, bringing their mouths together. Tony slips his tongue inside, wet and warm, as if to assure Steve that they’ll both be alright.
Steve prepared for battle. He looked at himself in the mirror, showered, shaved, put on a crisp white shirt and slacks.
Steve hisses, drops a kiss on the chin, and pulls off.  He grabs Tony’s knees, opening them wide to stare at the come dripping down Tony’s hole.
Everyone died. People usually buried their parents. Steve borrowed money from an employer to pay for Sarah Roger's burial. It was life. The natural order of things. The worst part was that the world kept moving. It didn’t stop. It kept spinning.
Tony had never felt as pathetic as in this moment, lying in his own mess, the bathwater tinged in blues and grays, flecks of blood still on the bed of his fingernails.
Am I seeing things. Maybe. Samson told me that it's likely due to Extremis. It rewrote my body. Enhanced endurance, restorative ability, better motor functions. Processing information at lightning speed. Are you angry. Am I still human, Steve. Was this what you felt when you got the serum and occupied a different body. I suspect that with you, Steve, you're still you deep down to the core. Steve Rogers is what makes Captain America. For me...These days, I'm not too sure. I'm getting too philosophical now. At the core of it, I made my decision with Extremis. It is what it is.
These are the worst evenings. When it’s obvious that the Underground found something worthy, gained leverage, made the correct move in this long game of chess.
Steve holds his gaze for a moment too long, then he grabs the damned yellow toothbrush, puts the toothpaste on it, and brushes his teeth. Tony mimics him and they look at each other in the mirror. It’s horribly domestic and this feeling of rightness grows in his chest, waging a war between his firm belief that he’s lost Steve, and this stupid, pitiful beam of hope, that perhaps they might talk and compromise. Perhaps, it might get better.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve knows he likes to be owned.
make me wanna drink. Thinking about you. goddamn.
Tony wants to say that’s not true, it’s you who’s always been impatient. Can’t swallow down words that disagree with you, Tony doesn’t utter these words. Instead, he goes up on one elbow and bends over to grab Steve’s hair. He tugs and barks out, “Shut the fuck up and make yourself useful for once, Cap.”
He pulled Tony into the bedroom. The curtains were open. There was only a hint of the moon, outshined by the burning lights of the city.
Tony refused to do laundry. He’d kiss Steve all over and offer him a blowjob just to get out of chores.
It’s the first one directed at him all day. Steve counts it as a win and tucks it into the wing of his mind reserved especially for Tony. Just Tony. “Did you have a nice time?”
Clint rolled his eyes. “Yeah, you just turned twelve last month. You’re barely anything, kid.”
“That would please me, yes.” Steve nods, taking off his gloves in a slow motion, almost as if he’s giving Tony a performance himself. Isn’t that just the case? Tony’s supposed to be the entertainment and yet, he’s the audience, holding onto Steve's every word.
He can’t stay. Not right now, not yet.
He was going to get up. He was going to roll out of bed and grab whatever bottle his hand landed on. Hopefully it would be tequila because he was not in the mood to be somber. He was going to wash his sobriety with the rest of his sins, and then maybe he’d forget the fact that he failed his country, failed his team, failed Steve.
It sounds too much like a goodbye. One last hurrah. Tony doesn’t want that.
“Yeah.” Peter stared at Steve, voice monotone. “Well have to get ready soon, pop.”
Tony runs out the workshop to quickly halt at the sight of Miss Barnes with blood on her cheeks, pistol still raised towards Jessica Drew and Ben Parker. Red Wolf stood beside her, his own colt pointed at the duo.
Steve flexed his bleeding knuckles, but they were already healing.
He managed a wet snort. “I tell you a lot of things, sweetheart.”
“I wish he was selfish. I
At home, Tony’s lounging at the veranda with a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice, picked by Morgan and Steve this morning. It’s still a bit bitter, too tangy for Steve’s taste, but just right for Tony. It’s still too early in the season, but soon, the markets will fill with plums and oranges, an endless supply for their little home.
“And I’m your son. Captain America’s son. Gotta keep going forward.”
He wasn’t going to think about how her wet hair dripped over her body in that navy bikini. He wasn’t going to think about her full lips and the mole on the upper corner of her mouth. He was going to delete the memories of her teasing remark and a sing-song voice. He was going to delete the pitch of her laugh and the way she straddled him and called him lover.
Natasha doesn’t move. Instead, she leans further back on the seat and crosses her arms. “I didn’t think you’d actually come,” she adds. “Been busy?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve offers, wishing he could pull Tony close and tell him everything will be alright. One day, he might. “I’m assuming that’s not the first time someone tried to put something in your drink.”
“Nah, we don’t. You’re not SHIELD, anymore, baby. Unless you wanna go back to your ex and ditch the Avengers?” Tony walked over and clapped him on the shoulder.
I can't remember third grade. Cars. How I upgraded your suit. Or, that Christmas. Yeah, you know, that one. I still remember Ru. The slope of her nose. The shape of your lips. I think we used to laugh together. I'm losing it, Steve.
At least Steve’s time here is short— short enough so they don’t have to fight but not long enough to soothe the creases and cuts in their friendship.
Steve gives a short laugh. If only Samuel knew how old Steve truly is.
“Steve.” The devastated tone twisted him up.
Grief hurt. It was worse than waking up in a new century, lost, confused with who he was supposed to be—Captain America. At the end of that tunnel was always Tony, anchoring him. Tony who gave him a home, his best friend and partner before they even got together. Tony was his Shellhead before they decided, fuck it, we’re not invincible, let’s get married, retire, and have kids. Live life. Be happy. Whatever that meant.
“Tony, I’m asking,” Steve is pleading. He knows this from the tone of his voice. He’d be on his knees if it didn’t mean sparing the last of his pride.
“They’ll be alright, sweetheart,” Steve says with a teasing smile. “You worried for them?”
No hands. Clint’s arms were cut above the elbows, and his bow placed right under his feet.
“Steve.”
His body, the stupid thing, still reacts to the praise, conditioned to seek Steve’s approval.
He tries not to shift from feet to feet. It’s an old habit, usually done when he’s nervous. The military broke that out of him, but Steve feels like resorting to it now. He rubs at the back of his neck, then stuffs his hands into his pocket. Tony is looking at him up and down with a smile.
Instead, Steve tries to satisfy himself with short licks, memorizing Tony’s scent like this, with Steve’s cock pistoning inside him.
Steve tries to smile in thanks. It turns genuine as he watches Tony pour Bruce a cup of coffee. Their eyes meet. There’s still that residual grin on Tony’s face, and it softens as he holds Steve’s gaze.
“Carol volunteered to do it,” Sam answers.
Carol told him that in her case, it was after a terrible date after four months of dating Rhodes. The waitress spilled wine on her dress and Rhodes laughed. On the way home, Carol insisted on walking instead of hailing a cab.
I didn’t think I’d screw up so bad. I have a plan. Everything’s going to be okay. It will be fine.
“Do you fancy yourself as a travel journalist now?” She brings the mug to her lips and takes a big gulp. She doesn’t slur, but he wonders how long she’s been up and drinking, if she slept at all. “Are you gonna write stories you’ve collected from everyday people after the Snap?”
He folds the garments and sets them by the bedside table, next to another bottle of lube and handcuffs, where Tony’s Identicard is thrown casually—because of course Rumiko knows all of Tony, and he doesn't have to hide this.
“So what are we supposed to do?” Steve had asked.
Maybe it wouldn’t.
“He’s good with kids.”
There's the Metro, but hardly anyone uses it. Steve does, just to see where it goes. It's even more inefficient than the subway lines in New York. Steve uses the money from his pension to purchase a decent car in a lot in his neighborhood and rent a studio room in Koreatown. There are bars on the windows of his apartment building but his neighbors are friendly, if not cautious with their warnings about race wars. He fought a war in another land, then he comes home to find there’s another one.
Tony shakes with how warm Steve is and hates the way his body chases the remnants of false comfort.
Peter shook his head, lips turning into a frown. He copied Steve’s pose and dropped his chin to his hand. “No, that’s alright. I look at you, and I see you without him and I think of him and how wrong it is that he isn’t by your side. You two were always together, never an inch apart. Never. Dad, pops... it’s...” Peter swallowed, looked away, then heaved a deep sigh. “I don’t know. Sometimes I think, why us, why my family, why my dad.”
Tony’s parched and his lips are cracked. From dehydration or his mouth being fucked open last night, he doesn’t know.
“Steve,” Tony says, and that’s all it takes for Steve to get into action, pulling Tony’s thighs until they’re wrapped around his waist. They kiss again, slower, a little softer, like tomorrow will never come. Tony’s pushing Steve’s hair back, making the thick blond tufts stand messy.
“Yeah.” Tony’s eyes flicker at the containers then to Steve, then back again. “Let’s eat.”
“Me too.”
“You’re going to a meeting, let’s go,” she commanded.
Tony keeps his sunglasses perched on the bridge of his nose. He taps two fingers on the console. A patpatpat with no rhythm at all.
He sits by the window and watches cars pass by every few minutes. Turns the day throughout this head again and again: leaving with a heavy heart, Tony in the passenger seat, beside him but untouchable.
There’s Natasha, bright eyed, on the docks, alone. There’s Spider-Man and Iron Man swinging and flying by Staten Island. There’s Christmas photos with all of them, Tony holding up a peace sign, with Colonel Rhodes and Ms. Potts by his side.
“I’m sorry — I.” Steve hid his face against his hand. “I’m angry. I really am. I shouldn’t have done that,” he tried again, voice jagged with forced calm.
Steve thumbed Tony’s wrist, feeling the soft skin. “Anything you want, Tony. I’ll give it to you. Whatever it takes.”
He never saw the body, and while Peter Parker rushed off to save Steve’s red scarf, they never fetched out any other remains.
He and Tony used to do that and the kids used to call it trouble.
Tony meets his eyes for a moment, as if to apologize for the questions, but Steve merely shakes his head as if to say, no harm done.
Blogs and memoirs detailed that the body’s organs would fail. How they might have to change their loved one’s clothes, how they might urinate on their beds, and not be able to eat anymore. How their loved ones might hallucinate, forget things, become completely different. Everyone’s bodies reacted differently to chemotherapy, but once they reached the end of life and the medicine couldn’t poison any of their cells anymore—because there was nothing left—then, they had to prepare for death.
Tony does the same for Steve, carefully tracing the single tear drop down his left eye. He kisses Steve’s eyes, then moves onto plant a single kiss on his lips, rocking up and down.
Before being on the receiving end of each other’s shouts, raised fists, a relationship littered with regret in just a matter of weeks.
“You will, Tony. You’ll wake up next to me. We’ll have breakfast together. How about I make pancakes with almond flour? The kids can join us. We’ll watch movies all day. Just like last time,” Steve whispered, voice hoarse. It didn’t capture the desperation he felt. “How about I make you another crown? You want carnations again?”
Tossing his underwear with the rest of his clothing, Steve pads inside only to find Tony on the bench, leaning on his arms behind him.
It was two inches in diameter and went by the name cancer.
“You’re not the first to say this to me, you know,” Steve measures out, voice incredibly bored. He just shakes his head. He grips my shoulders. My balance is off. It’s hard to stand on one foot.
Everything is fine.
Steve leans over him and parts his cheeks.
If he wasn’t in the office, he ran around the High Line, sketched Stark Tower from several cafes, and spent time walking all around Manhattan and Brooklyn documenting all that’s changed in his little notebook.
“It wasn’t about being too good for each other. Not with us.”
“Well, honey, I want nothing more than to be held by you,” Steve says, earnest as every time he says his favorite word.
It takes Steve getting shot for Tony to stop self-medicating. Alcohol can’t appease grief, especially as Steve’s bloody body was fed to the pigs.
The dish tasted sour in his mouth. There was something missing. He couldn’t figure it out even after checking the recipe a dozen times. He stared at Tony’s handwriting. It was one of the few things that belonged to Tony that wasn’t digitized. His handwriting was a mix of thin spidery lines, but when he wrote in cursive, it was all large and loopy.
Waiting for the Audi to return to the garage. Now the car remained there, unmoved, unused.
“Tony, no.” Steve choked on the words, shaking his head. He kissed the back of Tony’s head, his temple, his cheek. “No. Not yet.”
Steve is so used to him talking a mile a minute, hands flying everywhere, gesturing to his suit or his tablet, eyes wild and expressive. But Tony keeps his eyes out the window, silent.
and there, at the very front stands Steve Rogers and James Barnes.
Steve could have this, could have Tony. He could. Almost.
The evidence is all over the surface of his body, reconstituted cell by cell so that there's no longer a history of his original form.
Invincible Iron Man who doesn’t take off the suit because without it, he’s nothing. Well, bring me back to the good old days, Cap.
“I don’t know about that.” Steve shrugs. He wouldn’t know anything about being a good man. Once, perhaps, he might have believed the statement. But some people may never learn to forgive themselves.
He would have been fine if it was just them two for the day, but it’s even better to have their friends — family here today. There’s the pain of missing what they’ve both lost. No,
“Sweetheart, they’re Rogers-Stark. They’ll never be ordinary.”
“No, why would I be?” Steve said.
“This town is cursed. Work of the devil.” Red Wolf leads his horse to the front, whips it, and begins the ride.
He matched Pepper’s stance. “The machine is supposed to help process trauma. That's what I'm doing. You can't fight me on that, Pepper.”
Harley had learned all of Tony’s sarcasm and had a tendency to talk back to Steve. Like his father, Harley also loved blowing things up in the lab.
The first photo is of Tigra’s mutilated body. Her torso is cut in half. Her intestines spill out, a dark shade of red pools out to coat the debris on the concrete. Her tail has been roughly cut off, tied to her neck like a bow-tie, its end stuff into her gaping mouth.
Sue dismisses the town folk. Some loiter the premise, whispering as Rhodes’ green body decomposes under the scorching summer sun. Peter Parker looms above the body of the other Skrull who wore his uncle’s face. He’s crying on Johnny Storm’s shoulders.
“Good choice, Cap.” Natasha quirked her lips.
On and on and on it went.
“Sir, has used BARF for an average of three hours per day for the last ten days.”
Steve fists his dick, jacks it off a couple of times. He takes a deep breath, then moves to the center of the bed. Tony’s been patient, panting and making low, pleased sounds, anticipating what Rumiko has planned.
“Just jump right into it huh?” His tone is even, but Steve can see the facade slipping. He shrugs, shoulders rising to his ears before quickly dropping.
“That’s the problem, you’re doing the same things you did with Tony, and that’s okay, but you have to try new things too.” Bucky stood, patted his shoulder, then padded to the kitchen with a sigh. It sounded like he was making a late lunch for them.
Even the serum couldn’t do anything to cure the heaviness of loss.
“Something funny, Rogers?” Kate raises an eyebrow.
This was the exact place he held Tony in his arms. Now, Steve did the same for their son.
“No.”
Tony joked about making them all wear Iron Man suits, once, when he was in remission. Back then, death seemed like it’d never come. Steve was just ecstatic that they had more time—more birthdays, more holidays, more evenings under the New York sky.
Steve scrubbed a hand through his face then propped the mug down. He set it next to his own favorite, the black mug that had
Waiting for the bullet to hit the center of his head. Bullseye.
“Shellhead and Winghead,” Tony said, entertaining the idea that perhaps they’d never be in this moment if they made all the right decisions. Now, there was nothing but treachery and the will to dig their fingers into unstitched wounds. “Still like the sound of that?”
end of the line. end of my mind. soon. i will forget you too. sorry, old friend.
“Tell me about her,” Steve had said, leaning against the banister so he didn’t have to see the way Tony’s eyes lit up even more.
“Reminds me of dad.” Morgan fingered the stone, letting it flash red against the fluorescence of the light.
Pepper was the only civilian, but even then, she was scary efficient for a human being.
Grief felt like that. It’s a shadow that followed him. He couldn’t get rid of it.
“Sing too. For me, if you want.” Steve says, burrowing further into the settee, abandoning the completed Irish poetry book to stare at Tony. “I sure do love hearing you hit those harmonies, even when you’re so drunk you can’t see straight.”
Steve.
“You won’t come with me even if I ask, right? Go west?”
Steve flattened his tongue and unzipped his jeans.
Tony took off the knitted cap, dropping it to the floor as Steve lifted him in a bridal carry. Steve climbed the stairs to the rooftop, content to have Tony in his arms. Tony didn’t look fragile under the sun. He was still strong, sturdy even with his gaunt cheekbones and the lack of redness on his lips. His eyes were still bright and shining. That’s all that mattered.
Pepper handed him a thick, glossy folder.
He wishes the water was alcohol instead. Fuck with his soberity.
The waters pull and push against the shore, leaving and always returning.
Rumiko’s hair is in two tight braids, bangs pushed to the side. She’s wearing a golden top that doesn’t cover much. The strap-on is thick and bright red, like Iron Man’s colors.
Steve.
“But the axe or the ship or whatever it is you want to use as your metaphor doesn’t exist in a vacuum, Steve. BARF isn’t going to help you if you don’t actually use it to get better.”
I already knew, since the beginning, since going down this path, that I’d lose our friends. Judas, I’d be Judas. Yeah, it was fine, I told myself.
“That’s not—” Bucky leaned forward, catching Natasha’s gaze. Like Rhodes and Carol, they shared a silent conversation between them. Fuck this.
He entered the bedroom and found Steve sitting on the edge of the tub, testing the water’s temperature. Steve’s hair was still damp, but in disarray, as if he’d been running his hands through them. He was barefoot, dressed only in his shirt and jeans.
She laughs. It’s a high pitched sound that reminds him of her hummingbirds. “I can think of someone who likes it.” Then, it’s gone too soon. More somber, with a hollow smile she adds, “You have everything you need?”
He snakes a hand to his own throbbing cock, squeezing the base and palming his balls. Tony looks up, catching Steve’s jaw-slacked, eyes-wide and on him. No, can’t have that. He wants to look at Steve, he wants to see Steve’s face as he comes, but then he’ll think off it—he’ll remember that just earlier—
He inspects the fledgling branch in their little plot. It’s a single branch with a few textured leaves. A seed grows and next thing he knows, an entire tree soon replaces the fledgling branches. It's like a love affair, he thinks, glancing at Tony with a smile.
New York City is still loud. Every corner is filled with people heading in multiple directions. North, west, east. Some make their own paths and cross the middle of the street, no care for the cab inching on the road.
No, I shouldn’t blame you.
u u u u u u u u u .
Steve takes a bite, chews slowly, letting the taste of blueberries roll over his tongue. “How are you?”
Steve,
“I could say the same about you.” Steve offers the pill between two fingers. Tony leans over, takes the pill between his lips, kissing Steve’s index finger in the process. He’s smiling so wide and it hurts because Steve is making him happy, and god, that’s all he’s ever wanted since he was shot in the desert. He woke up in the medical tent  with only one thought in mind:
Tony ignored him, grasping the folder and flipped the crisp pages. Steve trailed off, feeling out of place.
Still, Steve is distracted by the tension on Tony’s shoulders. He’s holding the muscles of his body carefully, like he’s scared Steve might crash and have to pull Steve out of a burning car. The seatbelt is a crease against his shoulder. His jaw is set, has been for hours now. Tony doesn’t look at his phone, and Steve is surprised that his gaze remains on the highway, tracking every township they pass.
“I can do that. Try.”
“You’ve said,” Tony croaks out, meeting Steve’s eyes. It’s his favorite blue, too.
That’s what Steve wants. He’s not sure whether he’s jealous of her or not, but there’s an empty feeling in his chest, and he knows it's loneliness. It’s the fear of being forgotten and being left behind again. He’s nothing but an old relic in a new century. How is he supposed to inspire when there’s nothing but the hollow ghost of yesterday following him late into the night?
His fingers follow the circular pattern of the arc reactor, then the spidery lines on its edges. It looked like the sun—and if that wasn’t a perfect metaphor for how Steve orbited around Tony.
“You brought the world back, baby.”
The last time he asked, one of the wards smirked, nudged another officer, and they all laughed at Tony, eyes dark in victory. “Rotting in hell with the rest of Vegas.”
It’s strange to return to a place called home and feel like an intruder instead. A man who comes late in the night when everyone’s already asleep. Except, it’s bright out and the lights are always on here, so Steve is forced to examine the photographs around the hall that do not include him.
“To the love of my life. I only have three ugly words: You left me. Then another: I love you.” Imogen didn’t cry, but she kept crossing her legs. She shook her head. “No. I
“Riri and Kate are calling themselves the Young Avengers,” Tony replies, voice affectionate for a moment, before he glances back down his plate, collecting himself.
Tony was dead. Why was that so difficult to accept?
Steve never had much growing up. During the Great Depression, he used to beg for scraps outside restaurants that were miraculously in business. He had taken the leftover food thrown into the garbage, scrapped off the mold, and ate it with Bucky. Now, Steve’s in this lavish brownstone with a beautiful man, who has given him everything he didn’t even know he desired. He didn’t have to worry about being hungry, not when Tony made sure their kitchen was fully stocked.
A smile escaped him and he wished he was braver. Because if Steve Rogers had half the courage, or maybe, recklessness of Captain America, he would have clapped Tony on the back. Or maybe, pull him into an embrace. “You’re too good, Tony. This world doesn’t deserve you.”
But he doesn't. He thinks he's screaming himself hoarse.
I wake up and I see you, but I know I’m still dreaming. I’m a fucking mess, Steve. I think I’ll drink again. Soon. It’s bound to happen. You can't carry me out of the burning building this time.
Steve doesn’t reply, instead, he leads Tony past the boardwalk. They circumvent the group of longboarders and chain smokers. When they get to the sand, Steve bends down to unlace Tony’s sneakers. He looks up to find Tony’s amused expression.
He dropped his hand to the bed, directed the gun to his fingers and pulled the trigger. Five consecutive shots to each of his fingers, and then two on his wrist to curb the desire to pull the nails off.
“That you grieve for a man you love,” he replies with a shrug. “That Rogers meant something special.”
“What?” Steve thumbs eyebrows and pushes his hair back. “What is it?”
These two words often occupy Steve’s head, and he goes numb with the possibilities of how life could be different now if he spoke up years ago, if he listened instead of shaking his fist and pushing forward. But fear is paralyzing, and that’s the trick, he realizes now. It’s how men back in his day enlist because they’re told to fight for their country, and the motivation for such an act is born in terror of losing everything they have.
“No, it’s not, I hit you.”
Tony used to do that.
Another day, another mission, another battle for life.
“What the hell is happening to this town?”
“Steve.” Tony pawed at his head and pulled him for a bruising kiss. “Please, fuck me, harder, baby. I’m going to be home late. I want you to fuck me hard so I feel you all day. So, I’ll think of you all, day.”
And then, Steve sees it. The man leans against the counter, pointing at the party-goers on the deck, distracting Tony. He slips something into Tony’s cup and smiles.
Just like he always did every night, Steve will drop into the same sheets he’d shared with his husband for the better half of a decade. He’ll take out all the clothes from Tony’s drawer and run his hands all over them—the silky ties, the suit jackets, his cotton socks. Steve will carry it all to the bed and hope like hell it still smelled like Tony. In the morning, he’ll wake up early, fold the shirts, hang the suit pants, putting them all back to their original places. Then, he’ll run around New York, return to the brownstone, and cook breakfast for his family, just like he always did.
Back in the room, he closed the balcony doors, shut the curtains, and tossed the broken knob in the bin. Sitting on the bed, Tony phoned the receptionist. “Champagne, please. And two bottles of every liquor you have in stock.”
He stood on an empty platform late in the evening, waiting for the subway train on 86th Street when a woman, likely the wife of another rich bastard, entered the station. Her heels clattered on the concrete, a quiet pounding sound that accompanied the hum of the flickering lights. She smiled at him, her red stained lips turning into a small grin. She took off her heels, set them down by the platform, and draped a fur winter coat beside it.
“Mitski said we just have to feel it. It comes in waves, in and out. I think I’m getting better. Some days are bad for me. I think it’s the same for Harley and Morgan. But it’s not linear. There isn’t a single universal process. That’s what being human is. It’s not like science, clear trial and error.
“You got it, mate.”
He’d never wanted to be anything other than a man. Someone he could stand to look at in the mirror without the armor to protect him from all the parts he hated and let fester like some cancerous cell. He should remove it, operate on himself. Flay his skin back from his fingernails all the way up his forearms and past his shoulders. Break his ribs so he could reach in, remove all the awful, rotting parts of himself and replace it with the fitting screws, the right parts, but that required a master engineer with a vision.
“It’s the right thing to do. Fuck whatever SHIELD says.”
"It's a lie. Time doesn't heal the wounds. It doesn't take time. It just gets worse on some days. Then other days are better to handle, you feel normal. You could go for a run, go out with friends, then you might go to the grocery store, and pause, and think, that 'Hey, they'd like this.'" The woman swallowed, fixing her gaze at her sandals. "Then maybe in the middle of that aisle you'd turn, hoping to see them. But you're alone. Love doesn't go away. Moving on happens, yeah, of course. We all gotta do that, it’s why we’re all here, right?” She tilted her head, suddenly, her piercing gaze was on Steve. “But we gotta go on. Keep rolling the dice. Breathe in and out. Go live the next day…” She looked away, lips wobbly.
“Suck my dick and get it wet, Steve. Then, if you’re good, I’ll fuck you with it.” Tony pulled Steve's hair, hard. “J, blackout mode on the rooftop. And
Steve glanced at the set of carnations lining the wall. He was remiss on tending them because it hurt too much to be reminded of plucking them for Tony.
Tony dropped his head on Steve’s chest and pinched his nipples. They stayed quiet, satisfied. Steve put a hand over Tony’s shoulder and kissed the top of his head, hand trailing on the scar.
They watch Kit dog-paddle towards the dock. Her mane is drenched and Steve already expects the   clean up and drying to be an adventure. She hops towards the dock and barks at them, as if to say,
Steve has always been strong. It’s a given universal fact. But he’s known to measure his strength.
Condominiums, brick apartment buildings, low-cost housing in the middle of the city. Abandoned ranches and farms all across the world, with no body to tend to its dusting foyers. Nobody to turn the heat up, light a fire, and call it home.
Some days he avoided her. Those were the worst days—when he spent all day wrapped up in guilt.
“It’s not a giant footprint, Mr. Stark. It appears to be more human,” Tommy says, wide-eyed.
“Do you really think that the beard makes you incognito?” Kate deadpans.
“The kid working the shop said you can’t have Captain America without Iron Man.” Steve sipped his coffee again, not sure why he said that, it wasn’t even true. He saw that as a line in a newspaper, in passing. It was a sensationalist article about the Avengers coming together as a team during the Battle of New York. Steve pressed forward, setting the half-empty mug on the table. “Tony, do you want to wait until the morning to continue? Have a break? Catch some sleep, maybe?”
“Not enough time, Sheriff,” Tony says, covering Red Wolf’s back. He spares a fleeting glance at Steve — It — still standing half way inside the workshop’s foyer. “Go, please.”
Tony shut his eyes. He didn’t want to spend anymore time looking at her and reminding himself that at one point, he had been in Carol’s position.
“I do.” Steve kissed Tony’s cheek. “I’ll get right on that, sir.”
“Fucking hell, you’re so good at that—you’re so hot, that feels amazing.” Tony turns to him, mouthing at his jaw. Tony’s peppering soft kisses, nipping at Steve’s throat. “Kiss me, please. I want to taste you. Kiss me? Kiss me.”
Her shoulders shake as she laughs. “Just picking up your jaw from the floor.”
Steve stands there, hands in his pockets, a sheepish smile on his face. It’s a night in, just between the two of them.
There’s the squeenching sound of lube as  he pulls his fingers out of Tony’s hole.
He wants to cry. He thought he cried everything last night, these past three years, five years, even. It’s like whiplash: Tony giving him the shield, walking out of the building, standing by Compound’s lake and wanting to wash away. Now he wants to shut out the
“Steve.”
Steve’s shoulders shake in what’s almost a laugh. Tony used to find that cute, adorable even, when Steve was flustered and tried to make himself appear smaller. Not used. Steve Rogers is still pulling at his heart strings.
I don’t cry anymore. It’s useful to spend energy on something so trite. Nothing will change my condition.
“Just that helping the little guy reminds me of Peter. It’s something he does — uh, did. Offered him to join the Avengers, you know? He turned me down.” Tony smiles wryly and shakes his head, lost in a memory. “He wasn’t ready for it, and maybe I was wrong to push him. Hell, I should have done better and built something in the suit so he can’t go to space. I shouldn’t have brought him to Germany in the first place, but we all gotta live with our choices.”
Governments were in shambles but the people still moved on. This was the future Steve believed in: chase after a standard that’s better than the rest of them. Chase after a way of life nearly unreachable without stubborn motivation. That’s what Steve does when he’s met with an improbable task: dig down, double down, fight harder. Victory doesn’t matter as long as he’s fighting for the right to be otherwise.
“Papa,” Morgan pressed her small fingertips to the corner of his eyes.
He breathes in deeply, feeling satisfied that Tony’s face is on him once again. He’s always chasing after it these days. “Nothing like a home cooked meal?”
Steve walked over and gestured at his trousers. “Can I?”
“Congratulations.” He swallows the lump in his throat.
Steve gasps. “No, why would I. I wouldn’t hurt you.”
My fingers slip and I cut my upper lip. It would be so easy to take the straight blade and slit my throat. There’s no point in waiting it out now.
Reed has his hands deep inside the sternum of what could only be described as an alien wearing Walter Lawson’s face. It's hair is still blond. It's humanoid in form, but that's all where similarities lie.
“Does it bother you that we never had a wedding?” Tony asks, out of the blue. He’s nursing a glass of iced tea. The lemon swirls as he messes with the straw.
But, Steve, New York is something else. It’s trite, I know, to call it a city like no other. That’s what happens when all of us superheroes decide we want to set roots in this great city. But with SHRA, we’re ensuring that —
“Damn,” he takes out the cigarette from his mouth and walks over to the group of people sitting on the streets and hands them the stick. He returns to Steve. “You know, people don’t usually do ‘the right thing,’ these days. At least with my experience.”
Steve stared at the old television and VHS player for a beat, then he played the tape again.
“Someone’s gonna have to use this in the future. I mean, pops, there’s always work to do, you told us that. The world needs heroes. Iron Man,” Harley added, shrugging. He had a screwdriver in his left hand and his fingers were stained. Goddammit, he looked like Tony. “Besides, like I said, we found Morgan here the first time, so—”
It’s still a cell even if there’s no bedpan to piss on.
Soon enough, it happens. Steve’s pulling his body up, standing straight, chest heaving. He glances at Tony with wide, lust-blown eyes, two pale blue dots. Two spheres with an atmosphere of its own, and Tony flies around it. Around and around, that’s how captivating Steve is, and if Tony isn’t sitting on their bed, his knees might buckle.
“They’re in the workshop, Captain Rogers.”
Morgan and Steve found it scavenging around the tomato plants one day while they worked on harvesting the basils and squash. He tried to turn it away the first few times, annoyed that it was picking on the garden. But then, it meowed, its brown eyes deep and dark, and a little part of Steve remembered that he used to love things he didn’t even know. He took chances.
Tony brushed his teeth and changed the robe for clean slacks and a sweater. He examined the rumpled sheets. He imagined Steve was still there, pretended he was out on the balcony, enjoying the view of the city.
Tony chuckles, and the broken sound echoes in the quiet of the room. “I will always want you, Steve. I’m practically programmed for it.”
He breathes deeply, counts the inhales and exhales, then smiles.
He could replace the mental images with BARF. But Steve didn’t want that. The memories were going to remain pristine and as clear as he remembered them. He didn’t want anything to change. Tony always warned Steve that he often got gridlocked to a routine, only willing to bend if all the facts pointed to an improved direction.
“Steve. Wait.” Tony bites his bottom lip, and sighs heavily. “Hold on.”
The only place he’s ever felt comfortable was at the workshop with Tony, debriefing over their debrief, arguing over strategy, or just plain bickering, standing on the edge of something else. Teasing each other, willing, hoping that one takes the final push. But they never do, and that’s Steve Roger’s life, a series of missed opportunities.
“It won’t be the same way,” Natasha squeezed his hand. “Nothing ever will be.”
“Hi. Pleased to meet you,” Steve says.
He’s just a man fixing a car on the side of the road. Nothing special there.
Here’s what Tony’s always wanted. Maybe if he closes his eyes he can pretend that the man in front of him isn’t Steve.
and rubs circles around his back,  Steve keeps crying until his sobs finally subside.
“No,” she replies. “It could be.”
“Kate,” he says, because that’s the only other Hawkeye left.
Steve thinks it’s play, he’s said so, and now he tells Tony, “God, I hate how I want you.”
Shit, not even fifty and he’s a bitter old man now.
needed their other parent too.
There’s so many things Steve wants to say, he doesn’t know where to begin, too afraid to say the wrong thing, too afraid that they’ll explode, that there will be accusations, that he’ll be called a liar again.
He had to move on and grieve with the rest of the world.
He nods his agreement and bumps their shoulders. They stay quiet. Steve has too much to say, too much to tell her, and if he starts now, he won’t stop, and if he continues digging for memories, he might not leave. So, he leans forward, watching the trio with solemn eyes.
“Because of everything,” Steve said, earnest and heartbreakingly determined. “Now, come on.”
“What did I say wrong now, Tony? I simply asked how you were,” Steve says, voice gruff. He takes another bite, then another, shoving the food into his mouth so he can’t say anything else.
Steve turned to Peter. The space under his eyes was dark. Steve knew he wasn’t getting enough sleep. JARVIS noted that both Peter and Harley woke in the middle of the night and when they couldn’t go back to sleep, they worked on engineering projects.
Riri mimes her lips shut and eyes Steve again. The distrust is obvious. Steve doesn’t blame her. He ran while the rest of them were left with fixing the rest of the world.
“Hmm, does your husband know you flirt around with strangers and kiss them on rooftops?”
Steve sorted out the closet. He rearranged his own clothing, hanging the blazers and suits. There was too much space.
“I dunno,” Tony mumbles, pushing up to face Steve. He almost pouts but drops a kiss to Tony’s left pec instead. “I’m tired. I got a kid. Can’t do that now.
“You’re the one who wanted their eggs, dear one,” Steve tuts, but there’s a smile on his face. He wipes his hands on his jeans and pulls Tony for a quick kiss. “The one day I don’t join you all into town…”
He considers begging, not for himself.
“Fuck you, Steve, fuck you,” Tony’s shaking his head, frantic now. What the fuck is Steve talking about? How can Steve do this?
“The body remembers. Always.” Aisha inclined her head, signaling some sort of solidarity. She tucked her sunglasses over her hair, then crossed her arms. Steve’s watched Tony do the same hundreds of times over the years. “Sometimes I think it’s just a matter of training ourselves to live without them. Forcing ourselves to pretend that there’s more out here. In this damned life.”
Steve will never hear that voice again. Inch by inch, his heart broke again.
“According to the court’s paperwork, I’ve changed my last name, sweetheart.” Steve uses Tony’s thigh to balance himself slightly forward and slides the window’s curtain slightly open.
He doesn’t know why or what he’s mourning. There’s nothing left.
Back in the brownstone, Steve collapsed on the sofa. He nursed a black coffee, blowing and making ripples. He took a sip, closed his eyes, and thought about how Tony’s lips touched the rim of the mug over so many years.
Just for payback Steve kissed Tony soundly on the lips.  “Now, my Red Hot Lover has time for me, does he?”
“Just with my co-workers.” Tony winked, walking down the Compound’s landing pad. The suit eased off his body and flew to their stations inside the workshop leaving Tony in his undersuit.
Steve took the subway often, riding and getting off whenever he felt like it. Destination unknown. Sometimes, he grimly thought that living life in limbo was like riding a subway car alone. He often did that when returning from SHIELD headquarters in Queens, riding back to Brooklyn late in the evening. Sometimes, he’d share the car with people going into the city for a night-shift. Sometimes, Steve would greet them, desperate to talk to someone who didn’t deal with international crises. But most times, Steve was alone, stuck with his own thoughts and desire to belong.
“You think Barnes, Bucky—whatever it is you call him, is still worth saving?” Tony chewed on his lips before taking another large sip from the decanter. “I really want to fucking hit something. But I’m told that’s not healthy.”
Mayor Danvers is in the middle of the circle. There’s a smather of green goo, blood perhaps, on her dress, and she’s got the remains of Rhodes, no, It, on her lap.
Let me ask then.
“Thanks for organizing this. I really appreciate it.” He hugged Pepper and tried to pass Morgan off to her, but she clung to his neck instead. She refused to be set down.
“Nomad, huh?” Natasha interrupts, voice so soft he almost didn’t hear her.
Steve’s hysterical sobs echoed in the bathroom. For the first time, he let himself hear and process his anguished cries.
He settles his duffle bag by the door and drops to his bed. He should shower, wash away the smell of the day’s travel and sweat from his body, but he’s suddenly exhausted.
Steve turned to him. “Is this how you want to do this, Tony? You want us to yell some more? Is that all we’re good for now? We used to be better. A team.”
Steve is making beans when Tony walks into the flat. He smiles like a good man, and presses a kiss to Tony’s lips. “You must be starved from your walk with Miss Barnes.”
He can smell him for this far: sweat, lemon scented dish soap, and the remnants of dinner. Steve wants to reach out and pry Tony's hands from where they grip at the edge of the table. He always wants to reach out, but he doesn't allow himself.
He shifts his gaze to Tony’s lower lips. He can’t look into those eyes now. Tony’s already reading him, and he’s likely seeing all the fragmented parts of Steve. Keeping going, soldier, that’s what he’d tell himself. Only now, he’s stuck at this impasse. He wishes they were on the road again. Because at least then, there’s direction. There, he’s got a destination.
Tony shivered, and he itched to make half moon indents on his arms. The room was too bright, even with just a few lamps on. Steve would see too much, he’d see how weak and careless Tony had gotten.
Steve stared at the arm every time he saw Bucky, heart aching that his best friend wore something Tony made. Logically, the rest of the world has the memory of Tony Stark—their StarkPads, their phones, in green energy, in medical tech. The list was endless. He's immortalized in history books as Iron Man, but also as Tony Stark, genius, philanthropist, billionaire. Husband of Steve Rogers. Father of three kids.
“How many times have you done this with his face on us?”
Their ice cream cones were melting. Vanilla and chocolate dripped into their fingertips.
“Are you sure?” Tony asks, a touch hesitant. “How could you have a full house in a small town in the middle of nowhere?”
“Everything is all set here.”
Tony turned to Rhodes and Pepper, resting his head on Steve’s chest. “You’ll make sure he’ll be alright, Rhodey, Pep. Won’t you?”
Steve squeezes his fingers. A question.
“Yes, I like it. I love it Steve.” I open my eyes because he needs to see me to know this is real. “Steve, Steve, Steve.”
Outside, it’s nearly pitch black. From here, the stars are visible, twinkling against the winter breeze. His jacket is too light for a walk. He should have taken out the sherpa from the trunk, but it’s fine. He spent seventy years in ice, he could survive a brisk jog down the street.
Tony chews, the swallows, his Adam’s apple bopping before reaches for the glass of water. He smiles, it’s a small, effortless thing. “Honestly, Kate just showed up one day and said we needed a Hawkeye. Then, I found Riri in a bodega in the corner of the old Tower on Fifth Ave. She was making a suit out of a box of scraps. Scavenging for supplies in the dumpster. Kind of like Peter, actually… you remember Peter…”
“You told me once, time is relative. I’d wait forever for you to get your head out of your ass, if I had to Stark.”
“You’d know something about that.”
Tony shrugged, uncapped the bottle, and dribbled lube right on Steve’s crack. “There’s something about you being up here and doing manual labor.” Tony slipped a finger inside, waiting for Steve to adjust before he scissored another one in. “And then me pretending to fuck you for all of New York to see.”
“And here’s a wedding.” Sam squeezes his arm. “Now, are you ready?”
— we’re doing alright. But it’s not the same without you. We make do, though. One gets used to different dynamics in the field.
He won’t. He won’t give up. Steve Rogers didn’t do that. He’ll pretend this was a battle. He had to live. He had to. There’s so much more of life, they told him. There has to be something more than grief swallowing him whole.
“Leaving isn’t easy, either.”
“Yes, sir.” Tony’s gaze went soft, like sex was something tender even if it was anything but soft when Steve was pounding into him.
There’s a bark, then some insistent movement followed by a splashing of water all over them. Steve opens his eyes to Morgan’s shocked face. “Look what your PDA made Kit do! Kit come back!”
Tony lets it go on, because of course he does.
“Come for me, Tony. Come, sweetheart.” Steve shot forward, circling his hips to rub Tony's prostate.
Steve missed Tony so much he didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t deal with the grief of returning to their bedroom, alone, in a house where everything screamed Tony. He wanted to burn this fucking place down. Never set foot on it again.
He turned to Bucky who was squatting on the far side of the field. He was staring at Tony like a ghost.
“Tony,” Steve calls softly, and he was well and thoroughly fucked because no one in Timely ever called him that.
Pepper nodded, her bangs falling to the side of her face. She squeezed Steve’s hand and led them to the plush sofas. “He’s at rest.”
“Indeed, Stark.” Natasha pauses at the edge of the dam’s remains scattered across the bedrock. There’s a large footprint from Banner. She stares at it, sighing before turning back to Tony. “And while I’m ecstatic that James has returned to me, I — I think that the dead should stay dead. I cannot shake the feeling that it isn’t him.” She cries, “God, that must make me an awful wife. All I ever wanted was for him to return to me. But I saw the scalp, no matter how much Rogers tells me that was a way to stop the questions from being asked.”
His fists were clenched and Tony knew the way Steve looked when he wanted to hit something. This was familiar. This was like being in the rubbles of the Mansion all over again.
Steve presses his face on the space between Tony’s shoulder blades. He inhales, noses the muscle there, then falls asleep with his arm around Tony’s waist.
The food is settled across from them. Tony picks the burger up easily, chomping with careful bites. He licks the juice from the corner of his mouth. Steve wonders if he’ll ever stop paying attention to Tony Stark.
Steve snaps his hips faster, not concerned about finesse or being a good lay. What the fuck does it matter? Tony won't know it's him. He's panting, whether because he's angry at himself, this situation, or Tony, Steve doesn't know. He narrows his universe to just this moment, a bunch of nerve endings registering pleasure, cancelling the heaviness between his ribs. He wraps his other arm around Tony, putting all his weight on the arches of his feet. Hugs him. Imagine that this is intimate and anything but a game.
I don’t think I ever could.
“Where?” Tony asks as if he couldn’t track Steve with the Stark satellites if he really wanted to.
He untangles himself from Tony’s arms, sits up, and observes the blush down Tony’s torso, his softening cock. His hole leaks with Steve’s come.
“Didn’t you want to beat the shit out of me when I tried to pay a price? Now, it seems like morality is a moving target for you.”
“Just life,” Steve repeats with a sharp nod.
Their friends are over one summer afternoon, having a picnic by the lake. Iz brought her carne asada grill and is teaching Bucky how to get the tortillas just right.
But then, there’s Tony.
He didn’t bother flipping through the papers.
The high immediately dissipates, fading into something hollow, like he’s cracked his ribs, removed his lungs, and there’s nothing left but an empty cavity with his still beating heart. It fucking
He doesn’t know what Steve wants. Maybe they could be better, maybe they could go back, maybe Tony could be honest. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Steve lives in the spaces of possibilities, Tony rings around the circumference of compromise. They could be more, Steve might think.
“That’s not true.”
This time, he goes for the whipped butter in the middle of the table. He spreads it over his toast and tries to shift his focus away from the stray stand of hair curling against Tony’s left ear. He wants to pull on it and tuck it back just to see how Tony would react.
“Well, you ruined me, Tony. What will the press say about that?”
It was summer in New Mexico, and the leaves were of the distant had patches of gold. Steve was thirsty, he remembered that. They spent hours just flying around the state, Tony touring them through different peaks and ranges. Life could be beautiful, Steve had thought.
The concrete tiles on the other side of the station were dirty and chipped, and it was a different chaos Tony never expected. Little by little, more pedestrians came underground, filling the platform with chatter from different languages. There was a high pitched laugh close by.
Steve,
I could be lying in my coffin with the taste of blood and sand in my mouth.
Tony doesn’t shudder anymore.
“Better not, we have kids here,” Rhodes points at the end of the table where Johnny, Peter, and Morgan are seated.
it, you’ll know.” Tommy grins before running off.
“They can be. We just have to hope.” Steve brought their laced fingers to his lips and gave their wedding rings a kiss.
—happy in a way that Steve wishes he could see for the rest of his life. It’s a dull ache deep inside him. He’s been content to watch from afar, but the invitation for more—to press his face to the glass and breathe the same air as this man—was too much of a good offer, of a dream come true, to pass.
“Make it wet,” Steve says, voice cracking.
Pepper caught him by the elbow as they entered the facility. Steve hadn’t been there in months. Steve was too busy sitting beside Tony’s hospital bed and this facility brought back happy memories that only tasted sour in his mouth.
Steve kissed the top of his head. “Never, you’re always the good one. The best out of us.”
He walks out. It’s a full moon, wide and accusatory, too revealing for such an awful night. Steve avoids a few pedestrians and ducks down to the nearest subway station. He waits on the platform, gets into the arriving car, and rides it throughout the night. He doesn’t know which direction it’s going, but the hum of the subway washes over him and he avoids thinking about the taste of Tony’s mouth.
A coffin crafted by his own bare hands.
He kisses my back and rubs the knots off my shoulders. He is painfully gentle, like he doesn’t want to hurt me. His fingers count my vertebrae. A tap on each one. I shut my eyes and summon a moan when he fucks his come back inside me.
Tony tilted his head and opened his mouth. “I’m gonna force that down my throat if it kills me.”
He looked at his kids, seeing Tony in them, and vowed to hold on to the last thread that gave him hope.
He couldn’t keep it down. Iit was too acidic for his stomach. “How about I make you coffee and just put in a lot of milk?”
"You helped me when I was drinking. I'm not giving up on you, Tony. Over and over again, I've seen you fight beyond your limits and you never give up. We just got you back. You don’t get to give up.” Carol cradled his face. Tears streamed from her face, and her eyes were so blue they reminded him of Steve’s. “This isn’t the way to be sorry, you know.”
“Not sure about that.”
“Green? What do you mean?” Natasha asks, eyebrows raised in worry.
“Er, Tony.” He cleared his throat again, trying to focus. There were cowlicks on the crown of his head. It was a riot of soft curls. “Can I come in?”
Tony focuses on the keys, coughing twice, before singing Danny Boy.
“Ok.” Tony nods, the points down the hall. “Your room is still available.”
“Carol wanted to bury the bodies,” she begins, frowning. “But Reed took them for study.”
Tony sighs, sets the menu down then folds his arms. “Just because I’m a recovering alcoholic doesn’t mean I’m suddenly going to lose my shit because you’re drinking in front of me. I’ve been to hundreds of galas and events for Stark Industries since giving up the bottle and I haven’t reached for it again.” He looks back at Steve, picks up the paperweight menu, hides behind it, muttering, “I’ve been tempted, though.”
Steve remembers the time where he’d fantasize about Tony under him. When he’d mentally replace Stone on the VHS tape with himself.
Tony stepped closer, biting the inside of his mouth to stop himself from saying something stupid.
“No, no, come back,” Tony begs, and Steve’s never known him to be this needy before.
He pressed Steve further down, “Geez, why do you have to be so tall? You should just kneel for me, Steve. I think it would be easier.” He teased with a smirk.
I’m not yours, you’re not mine. I wish a lot of things were different, so I won’t sign off the same way you did. I still have that letter inside my bedside drawer. I catch myself tracing your rushed scrawl. See, Steve, you’re almost perfect. Penmanship could be improved, though.
He turns off the ignition and pats his pocket for the cigarette case, offering one to Natasha.
He heard it was beautiful.
Now, they gather as Red Wolf stands in the center, face darkened by his hat. His badge gleams under the sun.
He had astigmatism growing up. But there's one thing he could see clearly: he cared about Tony Stark’s life, maybe more than his own.
“Have a good day, kids.” He ruffled their hairs and watched as they walked down the street. They disappeared, blending in with the rest of New York’s pedestrians.
“What for?”
Tony drops to his knees, looking up at Steve as he unlaces his boots.
“Tones, man.” Rhodes sat on Tony’s right side, careful not to jostle the bed. He seemed lost for words.
He deserves it.
Tony shrugged, or at least tried to, instead he just grimaced. “I wanted to see your face. Simple as that. I love watching you make us breakfast. Always did.”
Steve wasn’t going to bow down.
Remembering and forgetting — both are punishments. But the decision is made, Steve. This is all there is.
“I had a family,” he croaks out, refusing to think of seeing Bucky turn into dust and how Wanda or Sam were nowhere to be found in the remains of Wakanda.
