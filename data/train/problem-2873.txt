Lucifer chuckled, "occasionally, but if I went I might just end up beating the old man near death for what he did to Castiel alone."
"Thank you for being so prepared. Have a good day, Mr. Novak. We will be in contact." Dean
Sam watched and caught his hand as he hesitated on a large diamond ring. "You can't, Dean. That was mom's."
He stiffened in frozen horror as John called the alpha over, calling the alpha "old friend". Castiel watched out of the corner of his eye as the alpha got closer and closer to the table. "I know him," Castiel said just loud enough for Dean to hear.
Sam looked quickly and his eyes widen, "Dean.."
Castiel smiled and said, "yeah. Luke scared me just a little when those alphas showed up, but he calmed right down."
Anna nodded, smiling lovingly, "really."
Dean remained quiet. Cas was going to be the happiest omega alive, and of course that made Dean happy, but now why would Cas need to have pups with Dean?
Castiel whined, "leave him alone! He didn't do anything! We just talked and he played his game!" John turned his attention to Castiel, whirling around with his eyes alpha red in rage and Castiel quickly hid behind Sam.
Mentions of sex work, no actual sex work
Dean walked with him hand in hand, just getting exercise, "it's nice to live in a suburb like this, isnt it?"
Castiel panted, his body tensed up and more slick trickled from his hole. Unable to hold back any longer, Castiel moaned out Dean's name as he came, spurting onto the blanket under him and into Dean's fingers.
"Birth control? Heat suppressants? What are those?" Castiel asked as he really had no idea what those were. When he presented at 15 he wasn't even in sex ed yet. It had happened so early and unexpectedly, and he was sold immediately after.
Castiel smiled and nodded as he took the alpha's hand, "Yes, please, alpha Dean." He was excited and nervous as Dean lead him down a dirt path to the stables. The barn was full of the smell of horses and fresh hay, a very soothing combination that made Cas take an extra deep breath. A soft purr came from him, escaping his chest in a soft airy rumble.
Castiel nodded and whispered, "I know." He then slowly went back into the bedroom and Charlie groaned.
Adam was on the ground, lip split, nose bleeding and one eye swollen. Castiel ran towards Adam, completely oblivious to his own safety, "Adam!"
"Mm. We should get up anyway, see if there's anything she needs us to do. I also want to prepare those burgers ahead of time." Dean took one last long breath of Cas, stretched and carefully sat up, not wanting to mess up the nest
He didn't mean to do that. He only meant to think it. Oh God. He went too far, Dean would be mad. He would be punished, pain was coming and he steeled himself for it. Dean looked strong too. How would the alpha hurt him?
"Of course not, Cas." Dean added quietly, still sitting a bit away and feeling incredibly guilty for whatever it was he did. Castiel smelled better, at least, and Dean wanted to just go soothe him. It was like a wild horse though, Dean felt like he needed to be slow and careful.
Dean and Sam got their badges and showed Castiel, as Sam said, "How has it been going with the pup? Any kind of troubles?" As Castiel checked out the badgei.d numbers, he replied with, "no troubles at all. And I have been calling him Jack. He's napping right now." As he said the last part he let the two men into his home. Dean glanced around, and from what he could see so far the house was clean. "Why would DSS send two people?" Castiel asked as he closed the door andlead them towards the livingroom. As they walked Dean replied to his question, "Well, for one, you are an alpha and one of us is an omega. It's mostly for safety as well for the pup. If we were to find your house unfit for the pup to be here." Sam followed behind Dean, lookingaround for any signs that Castiel could be unfit to care for the pup. As they came to the livingroom area, theywould find it neat and clean. A brand new playpen near a desk with a light blue blanket in it. Along with a mobil set up for the pup to watch.
Dean chuckled, "dont worry, I've got you. Hold my hand, I'll teach you."
Castiel whimpered and wiped the tears away the best he could. Of course Dean would want to be blood bonded, but last night had felt so special. Did it not mean anything to Dean? Did he think it was just Castiel being like every other omega at the breeding house? "But, last night... I don't understand why he can't just trust me," he sniffled, looking down again. Maybe he really should go, but he didn't want Adam to be alone again. He knew how that felt.
"I was never allowed to watch tv before, so I wouldn't know what to watch alpha." Castiel replied softly and started to go to the bathroom so he could shower as well. "Maybe when I'm done with my shower, we could watch some tv together?"
Dean said, handing Cas a card for a Dr. Fergus Crowley. "After you see him, he will let us know
Michael apologized for the fight he and Castiel had the day before he was taken away from them. Castiel accepted and now after they'd eaten he was running around with Gabriel playing chase. Anna smiled as she watched. They were doing great, and she looked at Dean, "you know you can join them."
Dean held him tight, waiting for Castiel's breathing to get back to normal. "That's better," he stroked Castiel's back when he slowly felt his muscles loosen, "I have the perfect mating planner in mind. I'll have her come over today."
Castiel smiled, "thank you Alpha Sam. Alpha Dean, Alpha John, do you like this?" His heart raced, he knew Dean would love it. But John? He wasn't sure. It was not a traditional dress an omega would wear to a party.
"Sure, Cas. Choose any show you want. Why don't you turn it on and I'll call down for dinner?" Dean replied quietly, feeling exhausted as he got  up to go to the phone connected to the other parts of the mansion for convenience.
Dean hummed along to an ACDC song as he cleaned off one of his tools from his workshop, then paused as he scented something good. Really good. Moutherwateringly good. Like pie and cider and the sweetest cloves. He sat up turning towards the sitting room of his part of the house, and his eyes connected with big blue ones, an omega standing there looking frightened out of his mind. Dean carefully set the tool he had in his hands aside and stood, palms out to show he wasnt a threat.
"Yeah. You're Dean's. Knowing Dean's posessive personality, you're probably only Dean's, though as the head alpha of the house my father could overrule him." Sam paused, "you're mostly here because father insisted Dean get an omega to accompany him to events and keep company in the house." Sam finally stopped in front of a door, "this is Dean's wing. Mine is across the hall and dad's is way on the other side of the mansion so if you wanna avoid him I suggest not going that way." Sam pointed the opposite direction.
Castiel swallowed hard, anxious. "What if, when I do have a pup, it's a girl. Would he try to get rid of her? Or even get rid of me for not having a son?" he whimpered and looked down at the bed. "I don't want to have another pup taken from me. I can't survive that," he closed his eyes and prayed that if he did have a pup that it would be a boy.
Castiel nodded, "nothing happened. He gave me a soda, and I have been watching him play the game. He's really nice Dean. You should come with me. I was going to get us something to eat and then watch him play some more." Castiel,  shuffled his feet,  "he kind of smells like you, just a little different."
Cas needed more, his instincts craving something specific, and he slowly pulled off Dean's cock. He went over to the bed and crawled up on to it. Arching his back, he presented himself to Dean, "Alpha, please, take me."
Castiel moaned and kept moving, using his thigh muscles to shift up and down. He went slow, wanting to feel every inch of his alpha's cock slide in and out of him. His hands rested on Dean's chest, head tilted back, lips parted in pleasure.
Castiel still shivered but his body slowly relaxed as he slowed down his breathing. Sam smiled gently, "That's it Cas. You're doing great, keep breathing like that. Nice and slow." He watched Castiel and reached in his pocket, pulling out a protein bar. "Here, would you like a little to eat? I have more, and we can get you a drink if you want."
When Dean pulled away, he opened his eyes, blue eyes gone shining omega gold. Castiel loved Dean's scent. It felt so good, and safe, somehow. Maybe sleeping next to Dean wouldn't be so bad.
Castiel smiled and said, "I'm not. From the experiences I have with other alphas, I know I'm a lucky omega to have been bought and brought to you."
Castiel nodded and smiled, "Thank you Charlie." He looked through the bag of clothes that would fit him and pulled out some pants and a nice red shirt. As he was going to the bathroom to change he turned, "Dean, I know we don't have to sell it any more, but can we still sell the dress?"
Adam shrugged, "I'm used to it, and I have all my friends online. I've enjoyed your company today, but if it's going to make Dean upset I don't want to do that either." He squeezed Castiel's knee gently, "you deserve the choice, and its up to you."
Castiel did like exploring his alpha's office. He even found a book about bees and smiled as he took it off the shelf to read what he could.
"Step away," Dean demanded, shifting into an aggressive position.
Castiel whimpered, what would John want with him? Felix must have told him what happened in the kitchen.
"What a cute name. Are you here alone, like me, or is his mother going to be joining you?" The
"We have a big room across the way and then a few smaller ones on the opposite side of the hall," Dean pointed in that direction.
John snarled, but walked out of the room, head high. Adam had managed to get over to Castiel who had ripped his shirt to try and stop the bleeding. He looked up at Dean and Sam, "he has to go to the hospital, please." He put his arm around the injured beta. This was all his fault.
"Every one of us, Cassie," Gabriel said quietly, walking alongside them and occasionally adding things to his cart too, mostly sweet things.
Dean hummed happily, relaxing under the tender touches of his omega. "I think you're exaggerating," he sounded pleased though, opening his eyes to look at Cas, red irises still slowly fading back to green.
Felix made a motion, "your brother's new omega. Or yours to share, if you want, I suppose. Mr Winchester senior instructed I purchase him. Your brother requested small with blue eyes." He looked over at Cas, who looked scared as hell and sighed. "I'll be running along then, please let me know if you need anything else," Felix bowed and headed off to the kitchen.
Castiel smiled and nodded, "I was scared that when Felix told them I came from the breeding house no one would want to talk to me." He gave Dean his soda before opening the other one for himself. He drank it and purred, loving the bubbles it had.
Chapter 1
Castiel only looked at Dean. His heart was beating out of his chest. His alpha, looked so good dressed up and he was nervous, not wanting to make a mistake.
"Maybe, but I don't know what to do." Castiel said and Sam piped up,
Sam was with his own hired date, a pretty little brunette with brown hair lighter than Castiel's that shimmered in the lights, dark eyes and a pretty red dress much more revealing than Castiel's own. John's date was a hired blonde with golden eyes and a sleek blue dress that left nothing to the imagination and was so see through she might as well have been naked.
Dean smiled back, buckling in as well. "I'm excited too. I get to meet my mate's family. I just hope they like me," Dean adjusted the mirrors and turned on the engine, GPS on his phone.
Sam was starting to worry. Not about him or Dean. They would figure something out. But he was worried for Castiel. Who was still quiet, and looking more heart broken than before. "Cas? You okay?" Castiel barely nodded, but said nothing else.
Dean was leaning against the wall and jumped up when Cas came out, coming over immediately. "Hey, are you okay?" He began to look him over for wounds or marks.
Dean grumbled drowsily, blinking an eye open. "Cas? Are you okay?" his voice was growly with sleep, fingers squeezing Castiel's gently.
Dean stood, calmly walked to his father, and punched him hard across the jaw, feeling bone crackle under his knuckles. It felt good, he'd been waiting to do that a long time. "Mom would be fucking ashamed of you, old man," Dean said fiercely, his eyes burning dominant alpha red, "she would have stabbed you in your sleep if she knew youd turn out like this." He crowded Castiel behind him, "do what you want to me. Disinherit me, force me out of the company, kick me out of the house. You know everything will collapse without me doing all the work behind the scenes. As for Castiel... no one will ever touch him without his consent ever again. I say that as his alpha and I challenge anyone who disagrees to come fight me right now so I can tear them apart." Dean bared sharp canines. No one moved, not even the man Castiel had slapped.
Dean rested his head against Castiel's, smiling against him, "yeah, Cas. It's amazing. I love pups."
Castiel whimpered, "N-no sir. Dean showed me around, took me to the stables. He scent marked me but it washed off in the shower, alpha sir." He wanted to look at him, but knew both instinctively and logically that that would not be a wise thing to do.
Adam whined as he tried to crawl away only to cry out in pain as John kicked him hard in his rib cage. "I've got to put him in his place. He is not to get near the omega I bought for you or Sam to take as a mate. He's not going to lay one finger on him."
"Hey, Charlie, can you stay home with Cas tomorrow morning? Dad wants Sam and I to meet him at the office," Dean began to pack up the food into the fridge.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We'll provide you with a percentage, dad. I promise. You built this business. We'll take good care of it," Dean shook his hand, "have good times in retirement. "
Charlie nodded and said, "Already on it Cas. He already said yes, we are trying to pick a day. Hey, did you know your brother Lucifer was in MMA?"
"I'm not sure!" Dean was just as freaked out, alpha instincts going haywire from the sounds and scents of hurt and scared omega. "First he jerked away from me, had this expression of horror on his face. I told him I was sorry he felt that way and that I could give him space alone inside. Then this. I didnt want to go any closer, I thought I might scare him more."
Castiel smiled and nodded as he followed her. Stopping only once when he saw the aisle with cereal. He couldn't believe there was so many kinds.
Dean ran his hands over his cars lovingly, patting the hoods as they headed into the mansion. All the servants greeted them at the door, every one of them looking very happy at everything going on. Adam had also been moved to his own bed to keep healing, and the mansion really felt like it could be calm and peaceful now.
Castiel thanked her as he took the clipboard and then picked up Jack’s car seat before going to
Sam followed after Dean, "Where can we go for tonight? Going back home is not a good idea. He's probably already called Felix to lock us out."
TW: ptsd symptoms leading to panic attack. Again, nothing graphic.
Dean looked him up and down, grinning, "if the omega is willing, his alpha will take him back to his rooms and knot him until they both are worn out."
Dean dusted himself off calmly, then grabbed a handful and dumped flour all over Sam's long hair with a wicked grin. "Ha, fuckin' serves you right for laughing!" he smirked as Sam groaned about having just washed it. He gave Cas a sneaky wink and ruffled flour off his shirt.
Castiel calmed down as his mate gave him kisses, huddling close to him.
"No, they never told any of us anything except you'd left home," Gabriel said quietly. "You smell like an alpha. Are you okay?" he was confused about the way Cas was acting.
Castiel cried out, the sensations completely different now but just as pleasurable, "Alpha! Oh, god yes!" He moaned loudly as he dug his nails into his alpha's shoulders.
Castiel looked at him, he wasnt exactly sure what to do, but he gently put his arms around Dean. "It's okay alpha. You kept us safe. I'm right here," he leaned up and kissed his cheek lightly. "Can you get my scent?" he asked softly as he bared his neck to his alpha, hoping it would calm Dean down to smell him safe and well.
In the store Castiel couldn't believe all the food he saw. He stayed close to Charlie and was thrilled to see cakes, cookies, and all kinds of baked goods. The wide variety of fruits was also amazing. "Oh, Charlie. Can I have this?" he asked, picking up a pineapple.
Castiel sighed as well and slowly laid back down in the nest, tugging Dean down laying half on top of him. He nuzzled at Dean's neck, smiling at how Dean was ready to protect him even though nothing was actually wrong.
"You're welcome. We brought you something special after what happened today," one of the servers  gave Castiel a soda and handed another to Dean, "I know we were told you shouldn't have it, but one time won't hurt." Castiel thanked them profusely and saw them out before going back to their nest.
That weekend Castiel was practically bouncing with excitement as Charlie loaned them her car. "Oh Dean.. I'm excited. I get to see my brothers and sister again," he grinned as he got his seat belt on.
Dean noticed him having a hard time deciding and stood, brushing himself off. "Let's all go to the kitchen. We can get you a proper meal," he offered a hand to help Cas stand, soft expression on his face and green eyes looking at him affectionately, still worried.
Castiels eyes closed slowly and he whined some, this time in pleasure. It felt better than he expected, the nibbling at his neck made him shiver and Dean's stubble scraped against him in a soothing way.
Castiel smiled, "maybe a smaller one for now." He then moved to hug him again, purring loudly. Even though his heat was two days away his body was already preparing for it.  By that night he knew his scent would be a bit sweeter, more desirable to Dean.
Castiel was amazed by how strong his brother was, a little whine escaped him. "It's okay, Luke. Dean, my alpha, saved me and has been taking care of me," he looked over to Dean and smiled at his soon to be mate. He was so happy that everyone was accepting him.
Castiel jumped some when Dean stood, then mumbled in a quivering voice, "Hello alpha.. I.. I was told to go to you by the taller alpha. He and the beta said that you own me now." He was shivering from how good the scent was now along with his nerves. It was stronger here and he wondered if this could really be Dean. He saw a man with jade eyes, a square jaw, freckles dusted across his nose and cheeks. Castiel noted the strong build, sturdy and toned even under the casual clothes the alpha was wearing. This alpha was very handsome, and he blushed some and looked away as he felt himself starting to get slick, a purely biological reaction to this alpha's scent.
Dean spent the next hour teaching Cas how to move around and tread water. Then, he just lay with Cas on the poolside lounge chairs, hand in hand, soaking up the sun as they dried off.
Castiel sighed, "Dean was doing most of the work anyways, so Dean should be in charge of the family business."
Sam sighed and nodded, that was true. But, maybe this would start something for the better? When the bathroom door opened and Castiel came out in his silk underdress he smiled, "good morning, Sam." He then saw the news and his heart sank, "is everyone mad at me?"
"Aww, what a beautiful pup. What's his name?" A blond omega asked, sitting a seat away from
"Oh yeah. I forget that sometimes Sammy." Dean chuckled as he pulled Baby onto the street
John looked him up and down, "turn around, omega." He inspected the back and sighed, "it's not as delicate or see through as I might have hoped, but the heels are nice and you look acceptable. Let's just hope you behave as well as look the part."
"There are those pretty blue eyes. Look at me more often, okay?" Dean smiled softly, carefully holding out his hand. "Can you come here so I can scent mark you? Nothing bad, I promise."
Dean gently gripped castiel, not wanting to hurt him in his hormone fueled state. He buried his nose in Castiel's neck, taking deep breaths. "I'm sorry," he took one more deep breath, his eyes melting back to green and his lips pressing a kiss to Castiel's skin.
Adam smiled, "he sure is something else. I can see why Dean likes him, but Cas isn't interested in anyone else, for sure." He groaned in pain as the hospital came into view.
"Okay. You don't have to be alone. Can you breathe with me? Deep, slow breaths?" Sam asked quietly, taking a long breath so Castiel could match it.
Sam watched Castiel, but didn't have the heart to tell him that more than likely, he may never get to see Jack in person. He slowly looked to Dean, expression sad.
"Sure, Cas! I can get that before we get to my place anyways, won't take but a minute," Charlie replied happily.
A kiss? Castiel smiled and nodded without hesitation, "a kiss would be fine, alpha Dean." His heart was racing. Maybe this could count as a thank you. He really wanted to do something special for Dean, this alpha had treated him so kindly, defended him, relaxed him. What could he offer? It had been a long time since Castiel had kissed someone willingly.
Castiel moaned into the kiss, his body producing slick right away with the touches, wiggling in anticipation.
Dean gently set Cas in the middle of the nest, then stripped off his own shirt and jeans and climbed in behind him, curling around him in a secure position.
Castiel purred softly as he listened to Dean compliment him, enjoying the feel of stubble on his skin. It was rough, but nice, and made him feel safe. "I think you smell even better," he said shyly, still purring in his chest at the gentle touches and soft tone of Dean's voice.
Castiel closed his eyes and sighed as he spoke softly,  "I love you, alpha. I'm sorry I'm so much trouble."
Castiel growled, and began to fight the best he could. He slapped at the stranger and yelled out, "Alpha Dean!" The strange alphas looked up hearing snarling and saw the men running at them.
Dean just nodded, equally as quiet as Castiel. He held Cas tight to his chest but was tense as fuck. He'd never challenged his father for dominance like that. In a fair fight, if he chose to try to take over head of household, he would most likely win, but his mother would have hated the idea of her son fighting her beloved mate. Dean shut his eyes. This was a giant mess and he had no idea what to do. He didn't regret how he reacted, but he regretted putting Castiel in that position in the first place, and he hated how annoyed he felt right now, "we should pick up some normal clothes at a Walmart or something too." Dean had never worn non designer clothing in his entire life, but he didnt have money for much else.
Anna thought about that and chimed in, "maybe you should go talk to him. Leave Castiel where he is safe, and talk to your father. Make him see what he is doing to the business."
Sam surprised him by just laughing and shrugging, "Dean says I'm the reason we cant have nice things. I'm always tripping over or breaking things. Dont worry about it." He paused, "speaking of Dean, we better go see him. Dad bought you for him, so... follow me." Sam turned and went to go up a long winding staircase, expensive carpet soft and plush under their feet.
The last thing Castiel had expected was a tongue over his hole and he gasped in surprise. It felt good, and he melted a little when Dean's tongue began lapping at him again.
Dean frowned, "and he couldn't bother to call me himself? What does he wish to discuss?"
Castiel slowly picked up how to text by texting Gabriel and setting the barbecue for that weekend. He began to learn how to use that video website Sam used earlier, Charlie even made him an account, "you can make your own videos and post them for everyone to see, Cas. If enough people like it, this website pays you."
"We can set one up. Where shall we put it?" Dean asked, cupping Castiel's jaw gently.
Dean just huffed a little and rested a hand over Castiel's where they looped around his middle. "I'll never understand senseless violence, with you, especially. No one is ever going to hurt you again. Blood bond or no," Dean didnt know now when or if Cas would ever accept a bite, but he was still someone Dean cared very much about and would keep safe. He knew that for certain.
Dean got up, looking at his least favorite servant and giving him a huge grin. "Fuck off, Felix." He patted Felix's pristine uniform with flour covered hands and glanced over his shoulder. "Cas, c'mon. We'll have someone bring us a meal." He held out a hand, smiling reassuringly.
Castiel looked at his brother and felt so bad, "can you walk with us Gabriel? I can talk while we walk."
"This all looks in order. How quickly do you want this implemented?" Dean asked, knowing the sooner the better for the company's sake.
"Yeah, sure. Shoot." Sam gave him a smile over his shoulder and led him along a hall of rooms, "and don't be too worried, you'll get used to finding your way around. You can also just scent Dean out after you get to know him, I guess."
Dean smiled when he came back and saw Cas had been nesting, climbing up beside him in the bundle of soft materials and pulling Cas close. He kissed behind his ear and inhaled his scent with a soft sigh. This is just what he needed after such a night.
"Yes. I would never do anything you weren't comfortable with," Dean said immediately, "and if you want me to get you birth control, I can do that today."
"Yeah, dad is kinda specific about omegas," Sam rubbed the back of his head, "Adam is pretty beat up, lots of broken bones, but he's stable and will heal with time. I'll check if Dean's gift arrived when I go down later. Better not tell anyone else, okay?"
Anna giggled, "sure. If he wants to." Everyone watched with a smile as Castiel placed Dean's hand on his sister's belly.
Dean squeezed him tight, kissing his head softly. "I'm in love with you, Cas. I never thought I'd feel like this for anyone," he rubbed their cheeks together, "promise to stay by my side?"
Charlie did the shopping but let Castiel add anything he wanted to try, including ramen noddles, because who didn't like those?
Castiel looked at him a little confused, "punishments?"
John looked at Cas, who was curled into himself to look small, then up and down at Dean, who was in an aggressive posture, ready to defend. "Already possessive? That's a good sign. There are strong alpha genes in you. I'll grant you permission today, just remember I run this house." He pulled away from Castiel and with one more pleased look at them both he left Dean's rooms as quickly as he came.
"You're not trouble, Cas. You've just been through a lot," Dean told him softly, kissing his lips, "and I love you, too."
"No, wait." Dean grabbed his wrists gently. "Stop that. You don't owe me anything. Everyone needs clothes." It was hard to push the omega away, because goddamn he was gorgeous with those big blue eyes and enticing scent, but he always learned from his omega mom to treat everyone with respect, no matter what nonsense his father practiced. "Just... get dressed, if you wanna clean up the guest bathroom is through that door." He pointed at a door on the far wall.
Felix gently knocked at John's bedroom door before entering. "Are you feeling any better sir?" he asked as he went to pour John more coffee and water.
Castiel was shaking, he wanted to see his pup, wanted to hold him, to love him but that alpha took him away! Castiel whined a bit louder, trying hard to be good.
Dean grinned, "no kidding." He paused as the music came on and smiled fondly, taking Cas in his arms and beginning to dance with him.
The preacher smiled and looked to Castiel, "and do you, Castiel, take this alpha, Dean, to be your mate? To have and hold, in sickness and in health. For all the rest of your days?"
He squeezed Dean's hand back and the preacher smiled, "then by the powers vested in me, I hereby pronounce you Mates. Dean, you may mark your mate."
Castiel bit his lip anxiously, "I just hope I can act like Dean said I should for the charity dinner." He smiled a little and said, "but at least I will be able to wear a dress that I wanted. Dean made sure of that."
Castiel was laughing as he put his arms around his alpha. They rolled some and ended up with Dean on top of Castiel. He had Castiels arms pinned above his head by his wrists, and was straddling Castiels lap. Castiel panted as he looked up at Dean, licking his lips, "you caught me alpha, now what will you do?"
Dean sat next to him with his own food and Charlie and Sam sat across from them, talking happily amongst themselves as they ate, Dean occassionally squeezing Castiel's hand or pressing kisses to his cheek.
"Of course, Cas. Anything you want," Dean smiled a little at him. He wanted to accommodate Castiel as much as his father would let him.
John just smiled, and ruffled castiels hair as the song ended. "You're welcome. You two will make each other happy."
Castiel tensed, looking at the ground. Adam had been comforting him, he wasn't doing anything sexual. "Bye, Adam," he whispered weakly before he left Adam's room, slowly closing the door behind him.
Benny smiled and said. "Okay then. See you later, brotha. Cas is more than welcome to join us when you do go out." He then smiled, "Have fun you two." He turned to leave and Castiel finally spoke in a soft voice, "Bye, alpha Benny."
Anna smiled and nodded, "I am naming her Cassandra. After her uncle."
Castiel looked up at him. He wanted more. His body craved this, and he WANTED this. This was all so new.
"I had a pup each year," Cas replied softly. "All but one went to live with their alpha father. I wasn't even allowed to hold them, feed them..." his voice broke, and he realized how much he said and backed away, neck bared submissively. "I'm sorry! I said too much. Forgive me alpha, I won't mention it again."
You're.. you're Castiel Novak! You were on the news a few days ago. Oh! So this pup.. poor
Dean's knot was swelling rapidly, soon tugging on every pull out, and with one last slam into Castiel's body his knot swelled to full and he rocked his hips, lodging in deep.
Dean groaned back, bobbing his head and letting his tongue twist around Castiel's length. He wasn't sure if Castiel had ever had a blowjob before, but he was going make this the best one ever.
As their lips touched he felt something click inside him. His eyes shifted right to omega gold and he purred into the kiss. His scent suddenly got sweeter, warmer. Castiel inhaled, Dean's scent was so much stronger now. He couldn't help as he started to get slick, a soft little moan escaping him.
"I was the only omega at the time and I have three older brothers, and a little sister. Gabriel, Michael, and Luke are my brothers and Anna is my sister.  Michael and Luke are alphas like Gabriel and Anna presented as a beta,  I thought they knew where so was and didn't care. So I never asked to find them." He nuzzled Dean and smiled against his neck, "Gabriel is happy I found you Dean. I told him all about you."
Castiel smiled and nodded. "Okay. Are my pajamas alright for the tailor?" he asked softly as he sat down on the bed and looked back to the tv.
Castiel whined, but nodded, understanding,  "okay. Could you send him a gift? Please?" He didn't want Adam to feel to alone. "I'll stay on this side of the house so you can work and not worry."
"Sorry. Instinctual reaction," Dean licked his lips and let his arms loosen on Cas. "Just thinking about you being around that alpha puts me on edge," he took a breath of Castiel's scent, trying to relax.
Castiel sighed softly. He had missed his brothers and sister. "Oh," he bit his lip as he looked around and quietly asked, "even Michael?" He and Michael had gotten into a fight the day before he presented and Michael said that he hated him and hoped he never saw him again.
Dean kissed his palm and placed Castiel's hand on his thigh as he put both hands on the wheel and began to drive, following his GPS. It was a huge park, and when they reached it, he looked at Cas for help, "do you see them?"
Dean kissed his head, "you're welcome. When I was a pup my mom and I would help in the kitchens. I know how to make simple things." He looked thoughtful at the idea of vlogging, "just be sure to be safe and not give away your location, okay?"
Dean rumbled a happy growl, nuzzling Castiel's cheek, "all mine." He spread Castiel's legs, pressing up against him and pushing home.
"Really now? Even after he's been with that embarrassment of a brother?" John stood up and went around his desk.
Castiel nodded and said, "Okay alpha." He walked over to him and kissed him lovingly, "I get to stay with you. Right?" He was still worried that he would end up back in the breeding house.
"I say punishments because that's what dad used to do. That'll be the first thing to stop," Dean said firmly.
Castiel was wondering the same thing. He nuzzled him and said, "Alpha?" Charlie stopped the video looking at Dean, not sure what was going on.
Dean's eyes turned blood red, snarling, "stay away from my mate! Wanna fight it out, fight me, old man. You're drunk as fuck and need to go right now before anything else happens." He shifted between John and Adam, knowing his brother had the strength to protect his mate if need be. Adam was crawling away, one arm around his ribs in pain, and Castiel motioned to Adam to come over to him and Sam.
"I expected more of you, Dean. That omega needs to learn that he is to do what you say when you say it," he said harshly, "if you don't start punishing him, I will. I won't have him shame our family by having a beta's bastard child."
Castiel listened but stayed quiet. His mind in a million places at once. His son, Jack, was he being raised with love? Did he know who Castiel was? Sam and Dean, having to live a life they knew nothing about. He should have just kept quiet, been the good omega he'd promised to be.
"Alpha, if I do have a pup and it's not a boy, will it be taken away?" He asked in a whisper. He didn't know if he would have a pup with Dean right now or not, but he had to know what would happen if he did have a pup and it was a girl, not a boy. He'd only had one baby girl at the breeding house, and she'd been taken away for adoption when the alpha father rejected her. His heart still ached thinking of it.
Sam smiled and reassured, "don't worry, Cas. You'll be safe with Dean."
"What, Charlie?" Dean looked up at her, slightly hopeful look in his eyes. He didnt know when or if Cas would be able to have the ceremony, but he wanted to give him everything he deserved.
Dean laughed softly, gently tugging Cas forward and guiding him a bit closer, handing him a carrot. The horse took the tidbit from Castiel's hand, jaw moving as he crunched it in an appetizing way.
Castiel was quiet a moment, "what?" He couldn't believe it, he had to hear it again.
Charlie shook her head playfully, but understood. If Dean didn't do that, every alpha would try to hit on Castiel, or try to steal him away. She used blockers when she was out, so no one really bothered her.
The servant came in and cleared his throat, "I'm sorry to bother you, sir. Mr. John Winchester wants to speak to Castiel. Right now."
Suddenly, both men jumped when the door to Deans rooms slammed open and another alpha walked in. Castiel stood frozen in fear at the scent of this alpha. He smelled like alpha cologne, power and lust and dominance stung Castiel's nose and could immediately tell this alpha wasn't like Sam or Dean, at least what he knew of them so far.
A couple of hours later there was a knock on the door and cheerful voice rang through, "is there a Castiel here? I'm Charlie, Dean said you'd be expecting me."
"I just want a friend, and he's acting like I want more than that with you. I just want a friend," he whimpered over and over, feeling so broken, almost more so than being at the breeding house. Maybe that was what he deserved, to be made to have pups and never get to hold them, cuddle them, raise them. Why was him wanting a friend, regardless of who it was, so bad?
"Do I have to wear anything like the breeding dress?" He had no idea what to wear to something like this, or what he would be expected to do.
Castiel smiled, "I know you can fix it, Dean. The business means a lot to both you and Sam."
Dean pulled his hand away,  "I don't want to, but it's worth a lot and there's three of us to feed and house, Sam." He put them safely away, then stared at his bare finger. "Cas, let's go to bed," he said quietly after a moment.
Castiel nodded and paused before asking, "um... will Sam fit?" He had seen pictures of beetles, and he wasn't sure if Sam would fit comfortably in that particular vehicle.
Castiel nodded, "yes. We're not having any now but we would eventually like three, maybe four."
Castiel woke a few minutes later, saw Dean had his phone and cocked an eyebrow, "Alpha?" He scooted over to him and put his arm around him, gently nuzzling his neck. "Good news?" he asked as he looked to his future mate's face. He hoped it was good news, they really needed it.
Adam was quiet as Sam got into the car and turned on the engine. As Sam drove silently, Adam didn't quite know what to say, "thanks. You could easily have let him kill me."
Castiel smiled and got up, going over to Dean and nuzzling him, "thank you Dean." He looked at Michael, "like he said. He let me choose what I wanted to do. At that breeding house they forced me to have five pups and took them all from me. I never got to scent them, feed them or even name them. I only got to know their genders and that was it."
Sam frowned, "he'll stay, as long as he likes."
Castiel wasn't sure, "I like Dean's eyes." He had a feeling he wasn't being very helpful at all, "I also like bees."
Castiel sipped at the small coffee and he found he really liked it. "Why would we break furniture?" he asked, a little confused as he walked in with them.
"Sure, Cas. Anything you like. I'll wear a blue vest, like your eyes." Dean grinned, kissing him again lightly. "I'll have them bring some cloth samples. In the meantime, would you like to go swimming?"
"And no pups for any of them?" Dean asked, pulling Cas to sit on his lap and nuzzling his cheek.
Castiel looked up at Dean and nuzzled him, "Alpha, do you think she would be happy about how your dad has changed or what happened that night?"
"So, he arrived. I told Felix I wanted to inspect him first," John growled lowly as he started towards the now clean and dressed omega. Castiel almost wished he hadn't showered, now nothing was covering his own omega scent.
Castiel nodded and watched them, smiling and calming down. When Anna let go of his hand he went back to Dean and kissed his cheek, "I told you he would approve of you."
"Hey, Cas," Sam addressed him, and Castiel looked at him,
The questioning went on for about an hour. Then it was time to show them around his house. They saw the baby gates at the stairs for the basement and second floor of the house. As well as covers over the outlets. The house was very clean, and Castiel explained that he had a maid service come in twice a week to do cleaning. Then they quietly came to Jack's room. "Before Jack, this room had been empty for a while." Castiel said softly as he opened the door. The room was large, with a bay window. A crib in one corner, where Jack was sleeping peacefully.Two baby dressers, and a changing table. Stocked with diapers, wipes and if needed; diaper rash cream. There was also a toy box with a few toys in it so far.
Castiel panted, eyes bright gold and pupils dilated. He kissed him back, his body tensing in pleasure. Unable to hold back any longer, he came with a low groan of pleasure, his body gushing even more slick for his alpha.
The nurse smiled and nodded, "he is in stable condition. We can call you in the morning on an update about his condition. You can tell him goodbye before you head out. You look absolutely exhausted."
Castiel paused, "I just don't understand why you avoid Adam. If you would just spend time with him, or even if Sam did, you would see he's a good person."
Dean pulled him tight to his chest, nuzzling his temple. "You smell so good, sweetheart," he growled happily, tilting his head to kiss him, his tongue running along his lip.
In his opinion, Dean should give his brother a chance. Adam was a nice guy, and he really did think Dean would like him, even get to be friends with his half brother. It didn't feel right that Dean ignored Adam because of something John did years ago.
As he passed Castiel, he got a whiff of rain, spices, and lavender. It was a unique combination
"He is, sir. But, I need to report on the omega you bought for him," he replied lightly as he was determined to see that Castiel was punished in some form. He told John what he had seen and how Sam had been having Castiel watch videos of proper omega etiquette. "Sam explained that if you or Dean were to tell the omega to present in front of the party, he was to do so. The omega then started to yell and bring up that breeding house, saying that even there they had rooms for that. The brothers have not been training him as you wanted."
Dean showered and climbed out in a towel, heading to his room to get dressed. He was a little concerned about leaving Castiel by himself after that panic attack that morning, so he did so as quickly as possible. He saw Castiel sitting on the bed quietly, head dipped, and smiled, "You could always go watch tv or something, Cas." He pointed out the remote and leaned into his closet to find something to wear.
Dean paused, then pulled away. "Yeah, okay, Cas," he turned quietly to go change into sleep clothes, unsure why he felt so rejected.
"It's fine, and you can cuddle him all you like."
Dean relaxed a little at the gentle nuzzles, and he gave a nod. "Could have been worse. I need to talk to you later, though," he took Castiel's hand and kissed his knuckles, inhaling his scent.
Castiel smiled and said. "Could I have hashbrowns too? They sound so good."
Castiel thought and smiled back, "well, I always thought a beach would be nice, a beach with white sand and bright blue water." He felt calm wash over him as he thought of that image. He could hear the sound of the waves, seagulls crying out over head. He sighed wistfully.
Charlie smiled as she unpacked the food and started to put it away. She didn't mind that Cas got diatracted, today was a big day for him.
At two-thirty that afternoon, Castiel arrived at the doctor’s office with a bubbly Jack who was
Felix looked at Sam and shook his head, "good thing Dean was born first. You're weak when it comes to what must be done to have an omega trained. You and Dean had two days to train this out of him, and he has learned nothing other then to do as he wishes."
Sorry for any typos, my autocorrect has been translating things weirdly. Enjoy!
"Sam, he can't do this, right?" Cas asked, hoping Sam would stand up to Felix like Dean had.
"Um, I think that bag had a few swimsuits to choose from." Dean pointed in the closet, a bag sat there full of omega swimsuits in various colors and some more exposing than others. "I'll teach you to swim. It's not hard." Dean grabbed a pair of shorts and began to undress.
"As long as the company is salvageable, yes. I feel like we can reverse this drop in business, but it'll be some work and a lot of publicity," Dean stroked fingers down Castiel's back.
Castiel nuzzled closer to him as he ate. "What was your mom like?" he asked, curious about the omega that had raised such a strong and caring alpha.
Castiel laughed softly and said, "I'm an angel remember?" He smiled up at Dean as the music started.
Charlie grinned seeing Castiel with the teddy bear, "do you like Sir Cuddleton of Meridian?"
Castiel looked at him, no less confused. He wasn't sure if this was a test or not. He had a choice? He never had one before, as his life had been planned for him until recently. He wasn't sure what path would be the right one to choose.
Castiel leaned against him and sighed, "okay, I'll try, alpha Dean." He closed his eyes, slowly relaxing only to just about jump off Dean's lap when his bedroom door flew open and Sam rushed in, "Dean, it's Dad. I don't know exactly what happened, but he's going to kill Adam."
Dean threw a huge long touchdown by throwing the ball hard down the field straight into Luke's hands, cheering and fist pumping, "fuck yeah! Nice catch!"
Michael smirked and looked at Luke, "take him with you. He's good at changing minds."
Castiel nodded and watched him go to shower before cuddling in the wrecked nest. It still smelled like Dean and it made him smile. He took a deep breath and shut his eyes, content.
Castiel shook his head, "no, Dean is great. His father bought me for either Dean or Sam to take as a mate. Sam is nice but, I love Dean."
He liked Adam, and decided he wanted to try and be friends. He and Adam could be be good for each other. Adam taught him a lot about that game and the different foods and drinks he might like to try. Adam even said he would help Castiel pick out, make his own character, and teach Cas how to play along with him.
TW: quick mentions of the breeding house
Castiel thought for a moment before asking, "would you like to have breakfast with me? Dean had to go do some work, so he will be a while, I think he HAS to work with Felix around."
Castiel nodded as he replied, "Thank you, I will."
Castiel sighed, "I won't. I asked Dean if I could go visit, but he said right now it would not be a good idea. I hope he gets better soon. Maybe I shouldn't have met him, at least then he wouldn't have been hurt because of me."
"Dad will expect heels. But, I dont want them so high that he'll be falling over. In a dark shade of green, maybe strappy," Dean pointed to a style he liked on the screen and the tailor nodded. "We'll come for our first fitting in a few days. He'll look stunning," the tailor bowed to Dean and shook Castiel's hand, leaving the room as swiftly and breezily as he had come.
Felix reported everything he had seen to John in clipped sentences. "That omega may need a lesson, sir. It appears your sons are too gentle with him. He already has the kitchen omegas making unnecessary messes and Dean spoke to me quite inappropriately," he shook his head as he brushed the flour off his suit. "I am sorry, sir. I know your boys have not been easy, but something can and must be done with the omega Castiel."
Dean smiled, leaning against the doorway, "Charlie said she's going to get the birth control tomorrow."
John nodded and said, "Thank you. If you allow it, I would like to come to the mating ceremony when you have it. I will understand if you do not wish for me to be there." He shook his hand and then Sam's. His boys were ready, even if he did not want to retire but perhaps it was time. "Oh, I did add something for Castiel in the contract he may like."
He purred low and rough as he got Dean's pajamas pulled down and saw his cock. He had seen many alphas before, but none were even close to Dean's size or length. He moved to get his own slick covered pants off, tossing them aside. Dean echoed the purr with a rumbling growl. He tugged Castiel back onto his lap, groaning as warm slick smeared over his thighs. "Cas, please," Dean whispered, letting his omega control the movements.
Castiel looked at her and then back to Lucifer and Dean, "why? What is he doing?"
It wasn't John, but Felix, "yes, Dean, your father would like to have a meeting with both you and your brother Sam at your earliest convenience."
Desn followed as if tugged by an invisible string, licking his lips. He came close and leaned over, pressing castiel on his back, inhaling the scent from his neck, "oh fuck, I love you."
Dean nuzzled back, smiling, "the perfect mate. Seriously." He kissed him again, curling him into a cozy embrace.
Castiel hugged her back. "Thank you," he smiled, almost not believing he had a mate and a family again. He gently booped baby Cassie's nose and smiled as she giggled. He kissed Jack's cheek and asked, "is everyone ready to eat?"
Castiel tilted his head with a confused look on his face, "ceremony? What ceremony?" He had never heard about that at the breeding house.
"He is busy doing some paper work. It has to do with him stepping down as CEO of the family business."
Castiel thought about that and nodded, "that would work." He then looked to Gabriel and asked, "would that be okay?"
Today, 4 days after his 20th birthday, Castiel was taken to the main room and informed hed just been permanently purchased. They had him dressed in a breeding dress, an ugly white piece of lace with no back and a short front, which he hated with every fiber of his soul. When he saw the beta waiting he paused, confused. Betas didn't pay to have sex with omegas.. they had other betas to sleep with. They didn't have the same scent interest in omegas. Right?
Castiel nodded and said, "okay. What's her name? Will you even have time to do it with the work you have to do?" He went back to gently running his fingers over Dean's chest.
Charlie laughed softly, "it's called jello, Castiel, you can have some with your breakfast."
Anna smiled, "Well, he's happier than we thought he would be after 5 years away from us. He's catching up after losing us for so long." She reached over and gently touched his arm, "everything will work out. You're perfect for Castiel."
Dean returned the nuzzle as well as a kiss on the lips.  "And nothing... happened, right?" Dean's alpha possessiveness had his hackles raised.
"Yes. I'm looking at these designs," Dean held up the pad, "some of them are really pretty, but I know my father will want something more... omega. That was part of what he told me today." Dean handed the tablet to Cas, "but, I promised you you could choose, so you tell me what you like."
sure everything is in order for Jack.
Castiel listened to the Sam and looked at the door a moment longer before turning to go back to Dean. "I wanted to get some air, but Sam was telling me it wasn't safe out there for me right now," he finally said as he climbed into bed and cuddled up to Dean.
Castiel looked at it and slowly reached out for it. "N-no punishment?" he asked in a whisper, and Sam shook his head.
Castiel nodded and cuddled up to Dean ), glancing at Sam as he got back into his bed. Sam was right, but he still wanted to do something to help them too. "Dean, the dress I wore tonight, sell that too. It's worth a lot right?"
Castiel nodded, relieved knowing that he wouldn't have to be dressed in that disgusting piece of clothing. He hated that thing, it made him feel so dirty. "Could I at least pick the color of it?" he asked softly, trusting Dean that it would be a pretty design and comfortable enough for him to wear for hours.
John nodded, "Good. I will deal with Adam. Now, on to the dinner." He spent an hour talking with Dean about what needed to be done, who would be seated where, the cuisine,  and all that. Dean nodded along impatiently, because he honestly did not care about any of this fancy bullshit.
nodded as he took the card and started reading the information printed on it.
mesmerized by all the new sights and sounds.
Castiel purred contently and held onto him, happy that Dean was relaxing. He loved his alpha, and hoped that nothing went wrong when they went to the barbecue.
Castiel chuckled,  "it's okay. Would you mind if I watch you? It sounds like an interesting game. Maybe I could try it later?" He didn't think Dean would mind, and Adam could be lonely and need a friend as much as Castiel did.
Adam nodded, "okay. Goodnight, Sam. Could you tell Cas that I'll show him how to play world of Warcraft once I'm better?"
Dean sat nearby, quiet but trying to get his scent a little more calmed down. Freaked out alpha is probably not what Cas needed right now. "I'm sorry, Cas. I had no idea. Please, just breathe. Focus on our voices. You're gonna be okay."
While Dean was with John, Castiel figured out how to turn on the tv. He found a cute little show about puppies on animal planet, and he smiled as he settled in to watch, wondering if Dean would ever allow him to have a puppy.
Castiel smiled as he responded, "yes, Please come in." He liked her voice, she sounded so cheerful. When she came in he gasped, "I love your hair. It's so pretty."
Sam smiled and when Castiel walked away he looked at his brother, "you've given him the world already, Dean. Remember the day you met him? He was shy, barely said anything to me, and was scared of Felix. I took him to your room cause well..." he looked at Castiel and back to his brother, "I wasn't interested in him. He is cute, yeah. Just not what I want. He had to have done something when you first met him that showed how different he was from now."
Dean smiled, green eyes crinkling at the corners. "Don’t worry, you didn't realize, it's not your fault. Do you like tattoos?" He had goosebumps from the gentle touch, and was a little surprised by Castiel's interest.
"If you had not met Dean.. where do you think you'd be?" Sam asked carefully.
To the horror of the crowd, Castiel slapped the alpha; he slapped him so hard he left his hand print red on his face, "you raped me! You raped me for three years!"
Castiel was terrified, what would John do to him? Why wouldn't Felix just leave him be? He looked to Dean, "alpha, please. I'm sorry."
Castiel tensed and whimpered before pulling away. "They never told you?" he asked, not wanting to be touched right then. Charlie.. where was Charlie? He started looking around for the red hair, his heart racing, "our parents sold me to a breeding house. I had been there for five years."
Castiel watched and his eyes widened at how rough the match was, at all the blood, and snarling, "oh wow.. I had no idea it was like that."
Castiel took a deep breath and said, "If you had not bought me from that breeding house, I never would have met Dean. Even, with all you have done, you still brought us together in a way, so, thank you for that." He then looked up into his eyes, he didn't have to fear John anymore. Not with his mate and family nearby to protect him if he needed it.
Dean rubbed his cheeks all over his neck, purring lowly and ending with nipping lightly at his jaw, "we decided to have a ceremony, which you all will be invited to, of course."
Dean groaned, "of course he does. Cas, it's almost time to get you measured, why dont you go to rinse off and get ready and I'll meet you there." He pulled Cas close to kiss him and got up to follow the servant, drying off as he went. He stepped into his father's office and looped the towel around his neck. "Father. What can I help with?"
and started filling out his information on the forms.
"Of course, Cas. It's really comfortable, isnt it?" Dean smiled, running fingers through Castiel's hair. He was slowly relaxing from all the harsh activity, Castiel's cheerful and calm attitude helping a lot.
Sam smiled and said, "This room looks great. May we look in the closet?" Castiel nodded and opened the closet door. Showing baby clothes hung up neatly, as well as plenty of diapers and baby shoes. Dean arched a brow impressed. "You put a lot of thought into this. And in only a week, you seem to have all the nessicary items for him." Dean said and went to look at the pup. He smiled at the sight of the dark haired pup. He was small, maybe a month old if that. He had a little bumblebee bee onesie on, and a yellow pacifier in his mouth. He looked like a little angel. Who would of wanted to ever leave him?
Sam looked at Castiel, carefully leaning down, "It's a panic attack. It could be something from being at that breeding house."
he gently set the car seat next to him on the floor. Jack was looking around, shaking his bee toy,
His arms gave out as he fell forwards onto his elbows. "Oh... Alpha Dean," he purred softly, now very certain that Dean was not like other alphas, mind going blank from pleasure.
Castiel felt like a piece of meat all over again as he responded, "five, alpha." He was respectful but chose to use the fewest words possible, hoping this alpha would just go away.
Gabriel gave him a huge grin, "Cassie, I'd like nothing more."
"I'll stay. Dean isn't awake yet and just in case Cas needs someone..." Sam trailed off, "I'm glad he's finally getting control of his own body."
"Sure, Cas. But why?" Dean asked, looking at him in confusion as he held a tshirt in his hands.
Sam and Dean arrived to make sure little Jack is safe with Alpha Castiel. How will it turn out? Will they feel Jack is safe with him?
Dean just sighed in contentment and squeezed Castiel's hands in his, "I'm the lucky one to have you, Cas. The day we blood bond is going to be the happiest day of my life."
But then he saw one passing by and his heart stopped and his eyes widened. He knew that alpha! That alpha, he had serviced him many times at the breeding house and... he had his third pup! He didn't realise he was shaking until Dean's grip tightened some. Everything would be okay if the alpha just kept walking. Castiel took a shaky breath and tried to steady himself through it.
Castiel nuzzled him, "that is so good alpha." He was glad that Felix would be gone. They could go back to the mansion and he would be safe and not judged.
Castiel smiled and nodded, "thank you."  He watched with interest as Charlie pulled into he driveway and ordered food for everyone.
"Because we both hate his guts," Dean whispered as if telling a secret, giving Cas a big smile and tugging his shirt over his head.
Anna sighed, "I can see why he would think that, he and Michael got into a fight the day before mom and dad took him away. Now, we all have learned the truth. I have no idea how Cassie managed to live through having 5 pups taken away."
"No. No punishments at all." He glanced at Dean as Castiel slowly started to sit up, feeling a little more normal.
When Sam came out of the bathroom, he got in the other small bed and looked at Castiel, "Hey Cas, don't worry okay? We'll figure everything out. You're safe with us." Castiel just nodded but didn't say anything and Sam felt guilty. This was the second time he could have helped Cas, but didn't. He stayed back, being the passive son.
Dean gathered his omega in his arms and swiftly took Castiel back to their rooms, slamming and locking the door. He was breathing hard, fangs digging into his mouth as he tried to reel back his alpha instincts, eyes still bright red.
Castiel shook his head, not sure he liked how they wanted him to behave. "Sam, this video, I don't like it. So I have to not be who I am, and follow rules that make it look as though I am helpless. Why can't I just be me? Am I really so bad on my own?"
Dean shook his head, "it's definitely been my pleasure."
Castiel moaned and whispered, "Alpha, you can be rougher if you want. It's okay." He held tight to Dean.
Cas. A young pup was sitting on her lap, chewing on a teething cookie.
Castiel smiled, "yes please. I've never had a soda before." When he got it he opened it and sniffed it, smelling the sugar. "I was bought from a breeding house. John wants me to have pups by my next heat or he says he'll send me back there, but Dean says he won't let that happen."
Castiel smiled as he looked at the designs. He pointed to one and grinned, "I really like that one. It's elegant, without being to revealing."
Anna nodded knowingly, "you're holding back for someone other than Cassie, huh? Well, think like this: if that person was still here, what would they say to do, with everything that has happened?"
Castiel moaned loudly in pleasure and purred as he slowly wrapped his legs around his alpha. He was thrilled that this was how their night would end.
Castiel smiled and nuzzled him, purring contentedly.
Adam put down his soda slowly, surprised. "Breeding house? Those things still exist? Fuckin' hell," he looked at him for a second, "are you doing okay? Those things are supposed to be horror houses. This must be a hell of a change." He paused, "Dean resents me a little bit, because I was born from an affair his dad had. But, he's a great man, and an equally great alpha. You can't get better alphas than my half brothers."
"Yeah? What did you find?" Sam looked straight at her, frowning.
He and Sam followed Castiel as the lone alpha led them to the kitchen.They found it stocked
Castiel nodded and kissed his alpha's lips lightly before going to turn the tv on. He sighed as he changed his ruined shirt since he had ripped it earlier to try and stop Adam's bleeding nose. He stared at the large bed a moment, instoncts tugging at him.
Felix frowned at the hand prints left on his suit and exited the kitchen. He was going to report this to John, immediately. The boys were being most unruly, and he was sure that the new omega was the cause.
Dean was close, but not in his space close and he relaxed somewhat, relieved it didnt appear Dean was going to do anything right now at least.
Sam rolled over, blinking at the movement. "Cas? What're you doing?" he rubbed sleep from his eyes, "it's dangerous out there for you."
Castiel nodded and smiled at Dean. "Yes, and tonight maybe we can cover it in our scents?" he asked, trying to hint at him wanting his mate tonight in their new bed.
Anna looked from Dean to Castiel with tears in her eyes, "oh, poor Cassie... We have you to thank for him still being here. You might not think it's a big deal, but for us, you gave the world back to us."
Dean pulled up into Charlie's driveway, setting the parking brake, "I'll grab the leftovers, you just go on in." Cas nodded and climbed out of the small car.
Dean smiled at her, "when are you due? I'm sure Castiel would love to be there." He took a bite of hamburger, trying to be neater than usual as he ate.
Castiel nodded and said, "It is, but his mate is thankfully okay with it and they are looking into adoption."
He followed Dean in contentment as they toured the house. It was so big he had a feeling he would get lost a lot before figuring it out. When they got near John's wing he could smell the powerful alpha and he tensed up and backed away from it. There was no way he wanted to take even one step further.
Castiel walked up to a stall and jumped back when the horse put his head out, shocked at just how large it was. He instinctively hid behind Dean, peeking out over his shoulder.
Dean ran fingers through Castiel's hair, petting him softly as he relaxed. He felt terrible that even as Castiel's alpha, there wasn't anything he could do.
"There are a lot of people taller than Sam, sweetheart," Dean explained, "like basketball players, or even just people on the street."
Dean laughed at that, "no promises."
"Ugh. That stupid old wive's tale about caffeine," Dean rolled his eyes, "they say if omegas drink it it's harder for them to get pregnant." He shook his head, "I'll have them buy some caffeine free soda." He squeezed Castiel's hand, "sorry, beautiful." Dean pressed a kiss to his omega's forehead and turned back to his lunch, beginning to demolish it. He was starving, but had been too absorbed in his work to notice.
"I heard something, Dean," he said softly, still looking around the room. He couldn't scent anything, but his nerves were on edge. He stayed close to Dean, nuzzling to side. He'd be safe if his alpha was nearby.
Dean nosed along the stretch of Castiel's neck, tongue darting out to lap at his pulse point. "If my father had touched you, I would have not hesitated to hurt him. He's right about one thing though. No mating bite yet," Dean scraped his fangs lightly across Castiel's smooth skin.
Castiel looked at him and started to get nervous, "he could protect them...he... I just..."
It was a good 45 minute drive up private lanes to a long winding driveway, at the end of which sat a mansion, huge and grand. It was multileveled, painted a brilliant white with gold trim, and castiel could see sports courts to one side, stables in the back and a huge garage with several glossy classic cars and work tools to the other side. "Out, come on." The beta began to drag him up the stairs to the front doors.
Charlie grinned, "heck yeah you can. Put it in the cart. I love pineapple." She kept going, "why don't you pick out one dessert while I get the veggies?"
Castiel moved over and looked at the samples, eyes going wide. They all looked so amazing and beautiful.  He looked at the dresses the omegas had on and quietly asked, "do you have videos of the mating mark being put on someone? I'm scared it will hurt a lot." He gently rubbed at his neck, thinking of how it could hurt.
The flood gates opened and Cas told him how Dean had reacted, how Dean got upset with him being with Adam, and everything that happened when they got to the kitchen. Castiel curled up into himself, covering his face as he sobbed. His body was shaking with how upset he was.
As he said that Castiel took a breath and exposed his neck just like he practiced with Adam and Charlie. They all watched and waited with held breaths for Dean to mate mark Castiel.
"Was your meeting okay?" he asked softly.
"If we're doing McDonalds, I gotta have some fried hashbrowns," Dean piped up, and Sam made a face.
One of the omegas sighed and said, "Felix, we were just having a little fun. We even had Castiel helping with dinner."
Gabriel shook his head, "That's ridiculous. He should see what is happening."
Castiel smiled and nodded, "we haven't set a date, but once we do I will let you know."
Castiel nodded, "okay." He looked at the wrapper in his hand and finally raised his head to look at Sam, "thank you for my food."
The group turned to Dean and Anna smiled sweetly, "please, let's get the food started. Luke should be here soon." She then started over to the table and sat down. Castiel followed and set the salad down.
Castiel stood and looked over at Dean, squeezing his arm reassuringly, "I'll be okay alpha, and Charlie has a phone so you can call her if you get worried." He leaned in and nuzzled the other happily.
questions. Please call either myself or Dean," Sam said as he handed the paper over to Castiel
Charlie smiled, "Don't worry. We will be. I carry mace and took classes on self defence. Unless Jackie Chan shows up, We're good." She stood and reached for her car keys, "okay, Oh wait... shoes for Cas...hmm we can stop by a thrift store first. They might have some good ones for him."
"Almost quitting time. How are you feeling?" Dean tilted Castiel's chin up to kiss him, "you did amazingly."
Castiel sighed softly, "A-alpha," he didn't mind the kisses or scent marking, but sucking his neck in front of Sam and Charlie was a little embarassing. But at least he knew that the two didn't mind as Dean was trying to protect Castiel.
Castiel looked at him, "Really?" He then looked at his flat belly and wondered if maybe he should skip the pills. Dean looked so happy around Anna with her being pregnant.
"Yeah, I'm sure Charlie wouldn't mind," Sam picked it up and handed it to him, "we can get you a bigger or smaller one too."
Castiel looked at her confused and Charlie pointed, "the bear, sweet heart."
Cas came over to dean, wrapping arms around his neck and snuggling close, "thank you, Dean. Its going to be beautiful."
Castiel looked towards where Sam pointed towards, wondering why he would need to avoid Master Winchester senior. Even if he could avoid him, what about Dean? What exactly was he walking into?
Castiel was quiet a moment before asking, "What about your dad?" Sam sighed, "Try to stay away from him. Dad wasn't always like he is now, but if you can stay away from him, that's probably best for everyone involved."
"Location. What place have you always dreamed of visiting?" Charlie leaned forward, smiling.
Just as Castiel got inside Dean's phone rang, John's work number lighting up the screen. Dean took a deep breath and hit answer.
Castiel looked at him in confusion,  "you don't? But why? It's not his fault your dad had an affair." He didnt think that he might be crossing a line since Dean had let him talk freely yesterday.
Dean let Castiel's calm, happy scent lull him back to his normal self, nuzzling at Castiel's throat and licking lightly at where he'd made a mark earlier.
Back in Dean's room he showered so Dean wouldn't smell Adam and once he got some clean clothes on he stood looking at the bed, the same bed where last night he and Dean had made love. It had felt so special, but now it just felt dirty, and meaningless. He went over to the couch and laid down, curling up as much as he could.  His mind started going to dark places as he laid there, slowly hating himself more and more.
Castiel smiled and kissed him back, "I'm glad I'm home too, and that would be Gabriel. He loves sweets and I guess that's why he smells like it." He hugged his mate and started to tell him about what happened at the store. He told him about how Gabriel thought he was dead, how all his brothers and sister thought he was dead.
Dean looked deep into Castiel's eyes, nodding.  "I do," his voice was firm and confident, hands squeezing Castiel's.
"Yes?"
Castiel blushed slightly. Hearing his mate was so sure he was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with made him so happy, and he couldn't wait for his mate to get back.
Castiel nodded at what Dean said and did as he was told. He saw the other omegas, and wondered if they felt like he did about this. Then when he saw alphas with two omegas he almost broke his role. He did whine at the sight, but looked away from it quickly.
Dean only hesitated a moment, because despite the amount of self control he had, he was still an alpha and he liked to be able to really breed his omega. He pushed Castiel's knees to his chest and began to drive deep, eyes going alpha red with arousal, their bodies slapping together roughly and slick leaking from Cas onto the blanket beneath them.
Gabriel hopped up, "grubs ready! Let's eat!"
Castiel was quiet for a bit as they danced. Then he worked up the courage to say, "John.. I want to... thank you."
Castiel whimpered loudly as Dean bobbed his head, groaning out Dean's name.  One hand gripped Dean's hair as the other yanked on the rumpled bedsheets, his hips rolling.
Castiel nodded slowly as he ate, thinking things over, "alpha Dean, have you ever been to a breeding house before?"
Castiel was so happy. He made sure that he put his pills where he would see them every day and went right to work on making his nest again. The room he and Dean had now was much bigger as it had been Johns, but his scent was gone since the maids made sure to use a scent neutralizer. He was purring as he made the nest and when Dean came in he hugged and kissed him. "I love you so much Dean. In a few days will be my heat, and after that could we have Jack over?" he asked, still so excited about everything.
Castiel held onto his alpha's shirt, whimpering, scared, hurt and angry. Luke got there next and didn't hold back as he started to beat the crap out of anyone within reach. The other men soon ran off, utterly defeated, all but the one that Luke knocked out.
"Beach ceremony then. We can definitely do that. I'll take you to see a few different ones," Charlie typed that into the tablet, "now, color palette. What do you like?"
Charlie smiled and said, "I'm not his mate. I'm a friend of his. Dean is his mate and he's scared because, well... for 5 years he was in a breeding house. Alphas, other than Dean, have not been the nicest to him."
Castiel smiled and kissed him back, "you're welcome. I thought it would help a little." He nuzzled him then began using this moment to try out how he should sit at the party. It still felt so odd as he put his head under Dean's chin like he saw in the video.
He was confused, but nodded, "Okay. thank you." He got up and went to the bags, looking through them carefully, treating them like gold. Dean was not like the other alphas. Not his scent, or his eyes, or the way he spoke. It had only been moments, but Castiel could tell. There was a genuine kindness to the alpha, and Castiel allowed himself a sigh of relief as he picked out some clothes and went to the guest bathroom to get clean.
Soon Dean and Castiel were on their way back to Charlie's house. "Today was great and you were so worried," Castiel grinned at Dean.
Castiel growled softly,  his hands moving to the alpha's shoulders and back. He whispered Dean's name softly as he panted and watched him.
The staff in the kitchen felt for Castiel hearing him say that. They knew the rules and all that a proper omega should act and be, and Castiel was a very nice omega, but he just didn't fit into that little box John wanted him to be in.
As he felt Dean's hands running down his back, hips, and ass with such a gentle touch, Cas shivered, "I'm sure, alpha Dean." It felt nice that an alpha was being so kind, and making sure he really wanted this. This wasn't just happening because an aroused alpha paid for him.
"Brother? Cas, is he telling the truth?" Charlie asked, looking back to Castiel. Castiel nodded, "He is. I just got scared. I haven't seen him in five years, our parents told him I left home when they really sold me to that breeding house." He was holding onto her shirt feeling safer with her there. Charlie lowered the mace, and then put it away, "okay. Do you want me to call Dean?" Castiel shook his head. "No. He'll think I got hurt."
Dean used his towel to brush off the stray flour and dumped it in the laundry basket, tugging on pants and boxers and going shirtless as he plopped onto the bed and flicked the TV on.
Dean had also said he wanted to touch him. Was he going to do that now? Castiel kicked himself for assuming Dean was not like the others. He'd only known him only a few minutes. He could be just the same as every other alpha on the planet. Castiel wanted to look up, but could feel the tenseness in the air still, could scent Dean's anger.
"I want to, please, Dean," Cas said with a shy smile, and he started to tug at Dean's pants. He needed them off, needed to touch his alpha.
She smiled and rubbed her big baby belly. "I am, she should be here any day now." Castiel couldn't believe it. He was going to be an uncle.
Castiel looked at him, trying to make sure he was telling the truth, and smiled slightly, "thank you, alpha."
"It will be done tomorrow. All that's needed is for you two to sign the papers."
"I do, but not right now. I don't think it is a good time to have another pup," he shook his head.
Dean tilted his head to give him better access to his throat, letting him scent and nuzzle all he wanted. His fingers stroked Castiel's back gently, soothing up and down his spine. He slowly felt Castiel relax, his body going a little more lax.
Dean returned the growl happily, nibbling at Castiel's shoulder and fingers tickling up his sides, dragging nails there lightly. His wolf instincts wanted to play with his omega, to rough house and roll around.
Dean looked at him seriously, expression soft and non judgemental. "Whatever you feel is right. If you want a pup, I'm open to the idea, but it might be good to have you wait a while, give you and your body a break."
Castiel closed his eyes but didn't sleep. He was waiting, and once he heard Dean's gentle snoring and checked to see if Sam was sleeping too, he slowly started to sneak out of the bed. He grabbed the key card for the room before slowly tiptoeing to the door.
Castiel nuzzled his alpha's chest. "I fought them alpha," he told him,  holding onto his mate.
Dean wound his arm around Castiel and rested his hand on Castiel's thigh. "That was perfect. Good job," he whispered softly, giving him an affectionate nuzzle, rubbing his scent on him. Their table slowly filled as alphas sat down, Dean speaking about business to some of them, greeting all. It was obvious he'd done this so often he knew everyone by name and face. They all completely ignored Castiel, which was protocol. If Dean wanted to show him off he'd bring up the omega himself.
Dean blinked in surprise, scenting the air and arching an eyebrow. "Smells like candy." He stood from where had been watching a movie with sam to help unload the groceries, pausing only to scent Castiel's neck and kiss his lips. "Glad you're home, beautiful. Tell me everything."
"So perfect," Dean moaned against him, very carefully sliding off Castiel's panties. There was no way he would risk ripping these, he definitely wanted to see them on cas again
Gabriel smiled, "and we will all be there."
For a while they went through her long list of items, there were several things Castiel really wasn't sure about, but they could get back to later. Castiel really did like Charlie and when she had to go he walked to the door with her, sad to see her leaving, "it's been fun getting to know you, Charlie. I can't wait to see you again."
Castiel looked down and said, "I'm sorry. I'm just scared that what John said will happen. That if I don't have a pup I'll be sent back to the breeding house."
Castiel smiled, "I liked it. It could be fun doing this. And maybe once I figure out what I really want to do with it, it could be a way to reach others like me."
Dean nodded, leaning his head on his hand. "Yeah. Hes pretty naive to anything in the world except breeding," he sighed, "I'm so in love with him, Charlie. Just look at him, he's perfect."
Sam nodded, "thank you. My number is in his file. Have a good night." He walked to Adam's room and cleared his throat, "I'm going home, but I'll be back tomorrow. I'll have the guest cabin made up for you, it might be better if you stay there a while."
Castiel saw the tattoos, perking up curiously and walked over. Reaching out, he gently touched one and traced the lines of it with his finger. He was very gentle, touch feather light. The tattoos were nothing like Castiel had seen before, and they had a certain unique beauty to them. He smiled wider as he started to trace another, not realizing he was leaving a light flour trail on them until it was too late, and he blushed. "Oh, I'm sorry," he said softly, looking up at Dean.
Castiel was used to being talked down to by alphas. But a beta? A part of him didn't like it and he wanted to tell the beta to not be such an ass. However, he didn't know how the 'masters' would react to him telling a servant off. Beta, or not, right now the beta had a higher rank than him. He followed him out to the grand double doors, gold and glittering in the sun.
"I think that's a really good idea. I'm sure other omegas would be very interested in what you have to say," Dean shrugged, "especially after what happened."
"I know. But still, if you hadn't gone to get him, I dont think I'd be alive.. I know you two don't like me, if Castiel wasn't here I don't know if Dean would have stepped in at all," Adam winced as they hit a pothole, "I don't know what I did for you guys to hate me, but I'm sorry."
Dean held out his arms for him, "no, baby. Everyone is actually just surprised and supportive of what you did. Come look."
"Maybe you should watch some videos on omega etiquette?" Sam suggested,  "just look it up on the internet." He nodded at the invitation,  "sure, I'll eat with you. You ready to go now?"
Dean smiled, continuing to nuzzle along his temple. "It'll only get better from here," Dean whispered, arm winding around Castiel's middle and holding him in a tight embrace.
"That would be MY pup and he has no say over whether I keep it or not," Dean told him, sounding every inch the alpha protecting his family.
Charlie closed the video having never seen Dean act like that before.
Castiel was quiet a moment before asking in a shaky voice, "did last night mean anything to you?" His voice sounded almost empty, and Dean could see his eyes and face were red from crying.
"I can do that. Thanks, Charlie," Dean ruffled her hair affectionately and headed to the spare bedroom to find Cas, smiling when he saw him arranging everything into a nest, "do you want me to ask Charlie for extra blankets?"
Castiel looked up at him in surprise, "you really want to take me?" Yeah, both Dean and Felix said he would be attending some events, but Castiel hadn't thought it would be this soon or something so special.
Anna wiped her eyes, "and that is what makes you a great alpha for Castiel." She sighed, "I should get going. Cassandra's daddy will be waiting for us." She then called out, "Cas! I have to go now."
Castiel looked at Dean, confused all over again. Please? An alpha never said please for anything. The alpha always knew what he wanted. Feeling a little bolder by the realization Dean genuinely wanted him to make the first move, he lowered himself onto Dean's cock, giving a gasp as his body stretched to accommodate the alpha's length and width.
"Of course, Cas. Anytime you want to, we'll drive over and see him," Dean ran fingers through Castiel's messy hair, looking at the halfway done nest, "that's gonna be a huge comfy one, isnt it?"
Anna giggled, "why did you think we wouldn't accept you? Luke, I could understand. He's in fight mode almost every day. For years we were told Castiel ran away or died, but it never felt right. Castiel was happy. We might not have had much, but we had each other."
Charlie nodded, "Yep and he's a champion one too." She pulled up a video of Lucifer in a cage match.
Castiel quietly started to eat his burger. Did people really think caffeine would make it hard for him to get pregnant? He had no trouble at the breeding house getting pregnant, but then again, he ate whatever he was given.  He took a deep breath as he ate his burger and stared at the one for Adam.
Castiel looked up at him and smiled, "it should be near ours, in case he gets scared at night." He purred softly, he loved when Dean touched him like this.
Dean smiled at that and took a seat on the couch. Sam sitting near him, as Castiel took the chair at the desk and turned to face them. "We would like to ask you a few questions. Regarding the pup and how you have been adjusting with the changes so far." Sam said lightly as Dean looked around for anything that should be baby proofed. Castiel nodded and said, "I understand. I was told that I would be questioned." He was so calm Dean noticed. A calm alpha was a good sign. A young pup could be challenging for even an omega. So to see Castiel being this calm was very reassuring. "Okay, about how often dose he wake up in the middle of the night?" Dean asked as he stood to check a few things a little closer. "So far, maybe twice a nice. The first time is around midnight and the second around 3 or 4." Samworte that all down with a nod, "have you set up a doctor for him?" Sam questioned and Castiel nodded, "Yes. His doctor will be Charlie Bradberry. And he is to see her today around 3 in the afternoon."
Castiel was looking down and was quiet as Dean talked with this other alpha. His fears were returning, wondering if Dean would offer his company or worse. Dean just shook his head, "I better keep showing him around before he gets lost on his own. I'll text you."
Castiel was quiet a moment before he started to cry happily. He would get to see Jack! He held tight to his mate and nuzzled him, "you'll get to meet him Dean! You'll love him like our own. I know it!"
It was early the next morning when Castiel woke. He wasn't sure what it was that woke him, but he slowly sat up in the bed, his hair a wild mess and listening closely for anything. His hand reached for Dean, feeling a bit nervous.
Dean could scent Castiel's sadness all the way across the mansion, and he frowned and immediately headed for his rooms. When opened the door and saw Cas curled on the couch, he went to him, kneeling down and touching his back lightly. "Cas, what's wrong?" Dean's nose crinkled, Castiel's normally perfect scent was twisted up and sour.
Castiel nodded, "I had a pup every year I was in there."
Castiel then asked, "Alpha, if you do become CEO, will it be safe for me at the mansion?"
"You're probably not wrong." Dean smiled too and pulled Cas a little closer.
Sam smiled and repeated, "Dad made it so you have visitation rights to see Jack. Starting as soon as tomorrow."
Dean kissed back up Castiel's body, stopping to suck and nibble his nipples a moment as he moved his way back up to his mouth.
Charlie nodded, "I'll show him the ropes. Oh, and I can help him with the ceremony. He's picked out some really nice stuff already, you'll be very proud of him, Dean."
Charlie smiled and nodded, watching them go. She could not remember a time she ever saw Dean this happy before. Castiel was the best thing to have happened to him.
"I think I'm falling too Alpha, and I don't know what to do. For 5 years I had no choices, I was to do as I was told or be punished for misbehaving," he kissed at Dean's neck, "I don't want to go back there..but I think Felix is going to try and make me be sent back."
Castiel nodded, "when he said he wanted to mark me, I had only heard bad things about mating marks and Dean agreed to wait. So, he scent marks me as often as he can." He then went to his mate and exposed his neck to him.
Then everyone froze, slowly creeping away from Castiel.
Sam stood behind Dean, "I'll help clean up. Thanks for checking on us."
"I agree. In fact, I think I'll turn in early too. He made such a pretty nest, we might as well use it. Thanks, Charlie," Dean smiled and gently scooped Castiel up against his chest.
Charlie smiled and said, "See? He's better and happier just being with you."
Dean gently touched Jack's cheek and smiled too, winding his arm around Castiel's waist. Castiel's siblings and Sam came rushing up, all of them grinning.
Dean nuzzled back, sighing, "of course she wouldn't be happy. But she wouldnt want us fighting either." He shook his head. "We'll talk about this with Sam later. We're supposed to be here for you," he kissed Castiel's cheek.
Dean concentrated for a moment and then gasped softly as a firm kick landed on his palm, a huge grin crossing his face, especially as he imagined Cas all pupped up with his baby and big with it like this.
The women stared at him with shock and then glanced back down at Jack. "Wait a minute!
Very sorry I missed last week guys but it was my 30th birthday and I was very busy! Thank you for your patience.
Once inside the car, Dean asked, "Did you catch his scent Sam?"
Gabriel laughed, "never did. Although Michael and Luke are basically body builders now." He plucked some sugary cereal off the shelf, "do you, uh...want me to tell them I saw you?"
Dean listened, feeling a little conflicted. "Sounds like they really didnt know. But why would your parents do that to them?" he huddled Castiel onto his lap, smiling at him. "You seem so happy. I would have found your family earlier if you wanted me to."
Castiel smiled and closed his eyes. No pup would ever be taken away. He never thought he would ever be told that. It sounded too good to be true, but so far, Dean had been keeping his word to him. He hadn't been punished, or forced to do anything he didn't want.
"I need to cuddle something small and pup like but I don't have anything like that," he replied softly, looking up to the other alpha.
Dean smiled against his skin, hand running up and down Castiel's side, not trying to start anything, just needing to touch. He watched him more than the show, enjoying the smile on the omega's face. What was important was Castiel was safe, unharmed, and in his arms. He didnt need anything else.
"Shhh," Dean's arm squeezed him a little tighter, "we have to act like that's none of our business. He didn't do anything illegal. I know it's hard."
Sam shook his head, "why, is it cute? Don't omegas only nest when they're pregnant?" He arched an eyebrow, "you think Cas could already be pupped?"
Castiel tried to relax, taking deep breaths and slowly calming down. "I want to be marked, I'm just scared of all the stories," he replied softly and closed his eyes, nuzzling closer.
Castiel smiled and said, "nice to meet you, Adam. I'm Castiel, and I just met your brothers yesterday." He held a hand out to shake Adam's, "if your dad does not care for betas, why does he trust that Felix so much?"
Charlie smiled and stood, "Sure. I'll show you how to start a video." They got up and Charlie took him to the living room where the lighting was better, and Castiel started his first vlog. He started it by saying his hellos and explaining who he was, then what he hoped to do with this vlog. He talked about himself a little before asking if they had anything they would like to know about him. He did an outro, hoping to talk to everyone again soon. Charlie smiled and spoke, "That was a great first vlog Cas. Want to post it?" Castiel nodded and so Charlie did on his account.
Castiel nodded and smiled. "Okay. Um, Dean, would it be okay if I ask Sam to take me to visit Adam?" He thought he should ask as he didn't want to make his alpha worry or get upset if he found him and Sam gone.
Castiel smiled, "really?" He didn't think it could get any better than this with Dean. He was happy just like this, with Dean cuddling him so securely. It occured to him, then, that he might be here forever with Dean, but that meant being here forever with John too.
The music started and Castiel started down the aisle, looking at Dean and smiling shyly. His mate, the alpha that saved his life, was going to mark him as his mate.
Castiel moaned a bit louder, his body starting to make some slick. A soft knock at the door stopped the kiss, "Sirs, when you are able, Dean has a phone call from the press asking about the business."
Dean came in half an hour later, smiling at the sight, "now that's just the most amazing thing I've ever seen. A beautiful omega cuddled in a perfect nest and a drink waiting for me. Perfect." He kicked off his shoes, changed into comfy clothes in a flash and climbed into the nest to cuddle and kiss Castiel.
"Yes. My dad adored my mom, but he still drank too much. Back then, dad was amazing to omegas. He respected my mom and the whole group. When she died...that all reversed," Dean told him softly, finishing the last of his dinner.
Dean nodded, "I understand, cas. I'll have it sold." He picked it up and folded it along with their tuxedos.
"Yes and no. If they were broadcasting they wanted to find a mate, coming alone would be acceptable, but since dad wants to eventually choose Sam's mate, and since dad has no desire to get mated again, they have hired dates to show people they are not available," Dean replied softly, walking up the stairs into the building with his arm still around Castiel. "Just stay close, don't speak unless I give permission, and don't touch the food," Dean reminded him gently as they mingled with the crowd. There were many omegas here, both hired and mated, and they all stood silent and submissive next to their alphas or perched upon their laps with heads under the alpha's chin. A few alphas had gone above and beyond and brought more than one omega mate trailing along beside them.
"The happiest couple ever," Cas whispered, giving Dean a kiss to start a lifetime.
Dean walked over, lightly running his hand down Castiel's back and over his ass. "Are you sure, Cas?" Dean was positive Cas had been raped without consent in this very position hundreds of times.
Castiel watched and was amazed that people were so supportive. Someone had even somehow gotten a picture of when John slammed him onto the table by his neck. "Mr. John Winchester is facing some major backlash since this image surfaced of the omega, Castiel, being slammed onto a table after yelling and striking another alpha. No further harm came to the omega as Dean Winchester stepped in. Many omegas that were questioned said they had never seen a more amazing sight then that of Dean, saving and protecting his future mate..." the reporter spoke and went on more about it.
Castiel nodded, "I didn't talk about that this time, but I might in the next one." He kissed his cheek before saying, "this wekend we'll be getting to see my brothers and sister. I said we would bring hamburgers, was that okay?"
"So, how did the meeting with John go?" Charlie asked, curious about them.
"Okay, I'll try that, but... how do you use the internet?" Castiel asked, hating that he knew so little and everyone else knew all of this stuff.
"Hello?"
He liked it here with Dean, and he liked Sam. Sam was like those alpha princes in fairy tales. John was like the alphas that went to the breeding house to knot him and leave. They didn’t care what Castiel wanted either.
Castiel smiled and nuzzled Dean's back, " well, you're still a good alpha. Like a knight in armor." He slowly moved so he could look up into Dean's eyes.
Dean squeezed him lightly, watching the movie and running his hand up and down Castiel's arm.
Dean nodded, tucking Castiel under his chin, "it's just an alpha thing. I'm sure her mate is very happy."
Castiel nodded and as he went to do that there was a knock at Dean's door. "Alpha Dean?" It was one of the servants, and he sounded a little nervous to be bothering Dean and Castiel right then.
Dean turned to look at Castiel and just gathered him into his arms, kissing his forehead. "I will fight tooth and nail so you won't be injured. Nothing is going to happen to you," Dean said softly. He was confident about that at least, even as he removed his cufflinks and watch and rings to sell tomorrow.
Castiel whined when his head was yanked back, his eyes closing with how scared he was. He immediately looked down away from eye contact when John let go of his chin.
He wanted to know more about why Dean avoided Adam. It wasn't like Adam was another alpha and would try to take him away. That couldn't possibly be the only reason.
"It's a sort of relaxed, calm feeling, and for the father or mother I'm sure it's a protective feeling as well," Dean replied, running a hand up and down Castiel's back.
"He was comforting me! And I already told Dean what really happened!" Castiel shouted from behind Sam.
Outside there was a car waiting, which the beta shoved Cas into the back of. "Stay quiet and speak only when spoken to," He advised, turning on the car.
Dean gripped his hips and pushed in one last time, his knot swelling too much to pull out, rocking a little until he hit his tipping point and came deep inside Castiel's body. Dean rolled them onto their sides for comfort, pulling Cas back against his chest, scenting the back of his neck. "Cas, that was mindblowing," Dean whispered when he'd caught his breath a little.
The tailor measured efficiently, obviously talented at his craft. "Did you have a specific style in mind?" he asked Castiel, who nodded.
Castiel’s smile faltered,unsure of how to explain the way Jack came into his once lonely life. "I...
Gabriel glanced to Dean and then back to Castiel and asked, "have you two talked about pups?"
A tawny haired boy stuck his head out from where he'd been on a computer with a headset on. He was a beta and didnt really have the same senses as an omega or alpha, so he hadn't scented Cas at first. "Uh...hey. Can I help you?" He pulled the gaming headset off and blinked at Cas in confusion.
Dean leaned in, pressing a kiss to his neck and letting his fangs grow, then bit down, drawing a little blood, tongue lapping that away. "I love you," he whispered in Castiel's ear, moving to his lips and kissing him to the cheers of the crowd
This is a chapter of pure smut. Enjoy!
Sam sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I guessed as much. Castiel was property. He has no rights to the child," he took a long sip of coffee, looking sad.
Castiel moaned softly, "and only yours, alpha."
Castiel smiled and nodded as he hugged him. "I missed you too Gabriel... see you soon." He let go and watched his brother walk away. His brother remembered him and had thought he had been dead. How could his parents have lied to his brothers and sister so long? He looked to Charlie, "Thank you for letting me come. If I hadn't, I never would have found Gabriel." He  hugged her tightly.
John rubbed his aching temple, sighing, "he's only been here two days, Felix. I promised Dean I would give him until the dinner. Now off with you before my headache gets worse."
"Probably, but I never was the most proper of people." Dean headed back to his section of the mansion, and laughed as he looked at himself in the mirror, covered in white powder and smiling. "I need a shower. I'll be back, okay? Shouldn't take long. Will you be alright by yourself?”
He was close to making Castiel learn a lesson personally. Sam had told him he was not interested in Castiel sexually and he felt Castiel was a better fit for Dean, not him, but Dean was being far too soft on the omega.
Dean held him tighter, keeping his chin over his shoulder so Cas couldn't see the expression on his face, "yeah, Cas. I'm sure I'll love him."
"No one has ever been able to calm him down like that before."
Charlie paused, "it doesn't HAVE to be, but I think Alpha Winchester Senior will want it to be." She flipped the screen after a moment, "we'll put flower shopping on the list."
Dean showered quickly, kissed cas on his way out the door, giving him a long, lingering look. "I'll be back," he waved, and smiled when Cas waved back.
Dean laughed, "because poolside sex is tempting? I have no idea. I don't like seeing omegas wear things like that in public. You're so beautiful you could be covered head to toe and I'd still be proud to have you on my arm."
"Hello, Felix." Sam spoke calmly, crossing his arms. "Is there a specific reason you're here to bug us now?"
Dean sighed in exasperation, "not my fault he has a hangover, Felix. He can still work or things can wait an hour." He stepped inside his rooms, "my mate is the most important thing in my life, as my mother was to my father. It'll stay that way too." He slammed the door and gently dropped Cas to the bed, climbing to press him down with his weight and kiss him again.
Castiel kissed him back then said, "I also have steaks being made too." He nuzzled him and grinned, "I asked them to make it how you like it with veggies and potatoes."
Luke took a slow breath, eyes slowly fading back to their normal color. "Sorry, Cassie. I got carried away," he looked him up and down, "they didnt hurt you, did they?"
Dean gripped Felix's arm, eyes turning alpha red, "Beta, you will release my mate RIGHT NOW or I will personally make your life a living hell, father or no."
"I'd like that, Cas. We need to start getting used to each other’s scents, so being alone here together is probably a good thing." Dean replied as he tugged out boxers and jeans, a few tattoos showing on his skin in random places.
John looked back to Dean. "Your mate? He has no mark, boy, and as for Adam, I would think you'd actually want to see him dead, touching Castiel as if he has the right," John spit on the ground.
Perfect? Him? Castiel had been called many things but perfect was not one he heard before. "They did?" He asked as he looked down at the breeding dress. Yeah, he hated it, but it was all he had. A stupid, ugly reminder of where he had come from and why he was here.
John's friend looked towards the whine and asked, "is he okay?"
"Dean. You know I'm a beta." Sam said with a sigh as Dean started the car.
Cas kissed him back, extremely relieved. His arms slowly slid around around his alpha and he smiled,  "Dean, for the dress, could it be green? Like your eyes?"
Sam chuckled and said, "oh, he's still so innocent. It's adorable." He took a seat at the kitchen table as the food was passed out. Castiel sat next to Dean and started to eat, purring at how good the food tasted.
Dean just stayed a few paces away, looking at him sadly, his scent soured with displeasure. "I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I thought you were beginning to see my dad is the only bad alpha around here." He quietly stood there a moment, "come on. I'll show you back inside. You can be alone if you want."
Dean thought about this for a long minute, huddling Cas closer, "We need to bring awareness to this, but dad will never let me unless I have a reason."
Dean paused, because he really wasn't sure of the answer himself, "I'm first in line to take over the family business. Once my dad passes or steps down as head alpha it falls to me."
Castiel pulled away to look at him, not sure he was serious, "He really wants me to be like that? If I do something he doesn't think is what a proper what would he do?"
Dean hummed thoughtfully, "yes, it's custom so it's probably worth a good bit. Are you sure? You love that dress."
Castiel enjoyed learning to swim, proud of his progress, and relaxing there now he realized just how content he was. His eyes were closed and his body lax. He jumped a little when a servant came out looking for them, "excuse me, alpha Dean. Your father wishes to talk to you. It's about the charity dinner, and Castiel."
Castiel chuckled softly, "I'll remember that come winter." He hugged him and then got them some towles. "Lets go, alpha," he took Dean's hand as they walked out of the room and down the hall.
Dean watched carefully, dancing with anna instead of Castiel's mother, who had declined the invitation to speak to Castiel at all, let alone be invited. His father didn't seem to be wanting to cause any trouble, very politely dancing with Castiel.
Charlie's house was a cozy little thing on the edge of town, "so I have a huge couch Sam can crash on and Cas, you and Dean can have the spare bedroom, just don't break any furniture."
Charlie chuckled and said, "Sure. But if you make a mess you better clean it."
Charlie chuckled and smiled reassuringly, " I'll be able to get the pills tomorrow, so try to resist his omega sexiness for at least tonight."
"And selling your mother's ring doesn't hurt him?" he asked, not looking at Sam, "it's my fault this happened. If I had just kept quiet we wouldn't be in a hotel, Dean wouldn't have to sell something that means that much to him."
"Probably to make him sound more proper," Sam replied, and Charlie laughed,
Castiel smiled and asked, "could Dean feel?"
Castiel clung to him and whimpered, "I'm sorry Dean. I tried so hard, but then he said... I'm so sorry." He buried his face in Dean's neck. He had just ruined Dean. He knew it, John would not let him keep working in the family business, or stay in the mansion. He destroyed their lives.
Dean hadn't thought of that, and thinking about Castiel's wonderful scent changing made him frown. If it made Cas happy, though, he'd have to be fine with it.
Before he could get far, Sam grabbed him and pulled Castiel behind him, "Cas, stay back."
Once at their table, Castiel took his seat on Dean's lap, just like they showed in the video. This part wasn't so bad. He got to be close to Dean, and his scent relaxed him.
Castiel sadly watched what Dean was doing and knew a way for an omega to help, but Dean would never accept that method. He loved Dean so much, and for him to lose the ring that belonged to his beloved mother... Dean would be mad at him, but Castiel would get them some money after the alphas fell asleep. It was worth it. Right now he just stayed silent and let Dean help him undress from the complicated outfit. He knew Dean would willingly do what he thought was necessary, but he felt bad that it came to this. "Dean, I don't eat much. Save your mom's ring," he said gently, nuzzling Dean as he got the corset off him.
Sam shook his head immediately, "it was all Dean. Dad wouldn't hesitate to grapple with me, but Dean outmatches him, especially when he's drunk."
"I've never had it. Is it like soda?" Castiel asked and Charlie laughed softly.
Castiel smiled and nodded, "good." He hugged his mate, proud of him.
Dean nuzzled back, rubbing his stubbled cheek against Castiel's, "the breeding house was a house of horrors and I plan to shut down as many as I can as soon as possible. Alphas that have to rape to have their own pup don't deserve them." Dean went to flip the hamburgers, still shaking a little.
"How dare you talk to me like that omega!" The alpha stood up, threatening as he strode over to Castiel.
Castiel whined at the bites to his thighs. It felt so good, so perfect to be with Dean. He looked down at the bed and whined as he started to feel Dean move inside him. He was so full, and he tried to breathe as Dean moved. Dean found his prostate and Castiel moaned loudly, quivering. His body trembled in pleasure and his ass gripped Dean's cock tightly.
Castiel didn't need the advice on how to act in front of alphas. He knew how to play that game, even if he hated the part he had to play. During the drive he looked out the window, mostly up to the blue sky, and dreamed of being free. He hadn't seen the sky in what felt like his entire life. Even with the nerves eating at his stomach, he would soak up the sun while he could.
"Hey guys. Damn, Dean, saw the news tonight and you and Cas were the number one story. I figure you guys are probably stranded somewhere in the city so call me and you can hang out at my house until Winchester senior caves. Ciao!"
"I'll be fine," Sam grumbled, and Dean chuckled,
"They're omegas, they probably understand better than we as alphas can," Dean popped open the soda tab and began to eat, content.
Castiel nodded, "I'll be careful, Dean." He smiled and decied to try being a vlogger. Maybe from there he could figure out more of what he could do.
"I'm sure they will. You saved me, Dean," Castiel reached over to hold his hand.

John nodded, "I had a feeling with how he reacted at that dinner. But, let him know, Jack knows next to nothing about him." Once the papers were all sighed he had copies made and given to Sam and Dean, placing the original in his brief case, "good luck boys. I hope to see you soon."
The creature pressed his velvety soft nose to Castiel's hand and Dean smiled, "looks like he likes you."
Felix gripped his arm roughly,  "I'm sure Master Dean would not be pleased to know what I just saw. Maybe you're used to throwing yourself around but here you belong to him." Felix let go, glared at Adam and walked away down the hall.
"Those are so unhealthy, Dean," Sam shot him a look of disgust.
Dean ran after him, darting along the hall. Cas was quicker than he looked, and Dean was having an amazing time trying to catch him. He leaped around a corner and tackled Castiel to the shag carpet rug there, nuzzling him and nipping softly all over.
Luke heard Gabriel but it was like through a fog, and he kept pacing. He felt someone touched his arm and whirled, ready to attack, but stopped when he saw omega gold eyes. Castiel had slowly moved away from Dean and gone over to his brother. His eyes shimmered gold as he spoke, "it's okay, Luke. It's okay now. I'm safe, you and the others saved me."
Dean immediately scented Castiel's fear, looking over at the table and beginning to run over full sprint.
Castiel nodded, "it is, it's so quiet, and feels so safe." He smiled as he heard kids playing, and a dog bark, "it would be a nice place to move one day."
"This color?" Charlie held out the tablet with a shade of green, matching Dean's eyes perfectly.
Castiel slowly uncurled and scooted closer to him, "he didn't do anything but talk to me. Before I left his room just now he touched my knee to comfort me but that was all." He then nuzzled him, still hurt that Dean thought he would cheat on him so easily, but needing the contact.
"Last night was wonderful. I thought you weren't like other alphas, like you actually cared and understood. Then today, I meet Adam, and you act like I slept with him. You think that I want him as a lover when I don't. I was forced to take knots for five years, alpha. Last night was the first time I've ever wanted it. Last night felt like everything to me."
Felix looked up at Dean and his eyes narrowed as he released Castiel. "The family business will fail with you in charge. That omega will bring you only shame. So you best get him to behave. Your father will hear about this." He growled before leaving them towards John's room.
Castiel looked at him and said, "I don't think I'll have another time I will need to wear it, and it has too many bad memories attached to it already."
Dean sat up a little and blinked at them both from the other bed. "The hell is going on?" he asked drowsily, and Sam looked at Cas. He wouldn't say anything if Cas didn't try to leave.
Castiel's eyes widened before narrowing and going omega gold, enraged. "Present in front of everyone!? Even at the breeding hose they gave us a room for that!" he growled out as the staff looked at him in shock.
Sam looked up from the laptop he'd been borrowing from Charlie and smiled kindly, "yeah, what's up, Cas?" He turned to face him.
Dean scented Cas before he saw him and was frowning when Cas came into view.  "You reek like Adam," his expression was stormy as he studied Castiel up and down, arms crossed, "please, explain."
Dean nodded, squeezing castiels hand. "I know, baby. I know. It's not fair, it will never be fair."
Castiel winced a little at the first moment, but the pain melted away and he sighed happily. "I love you too Dean, my alpha," he kissed him back, looking away only when he felt a tug at his dress. He looked down, and smiled upon seeing Jack. He picked him up and smiled up at his new mate. This was a perfect day.
John had had an affair, and that had to upset Dean and Adam. However, Adam had nothing to do with that, he was innocent from it and didn't ask for it to happen. Was that really the only reason he was so disliked?
Dean hummed, sliding down as far as he could go and sucking on his way back up, hands sliding up to play with Castiel's sensitive nipples, punching lightly in his fingertips.
"Everything is looking good. Now, you will need to see a psychiatrist. It is part of the process,"
Castiel hugged it close and smiled, this one was fine. "Thanks, but this one is perfect," he then nuzzled it like a omega would a pup and started back to the room with Dean to cuddle his alpha and hold the teddy bear close.
"Pancakes with bacon please." Castiel was really hoping bacon wasn't something John wouldn't let him have right now. His mind was whirling with everything he had to do and hoped he wouldn't mess anything up.
John ran his hand over the curve of Castiel's ass then along his belly. "Slender hips for an omega. How many pups have you birthed?" He demanded, squeezing his sides a little too roughly.
"Won't you get in trouble for what you said to him?" Castiel asked as they got out of hearing range of Felix. He didn't understand why the beta was so rough on him. He had just met him and was already treating Castiel like he was only bringing trouble.
"For a while, then it seemed to blow over," Gabriel admitted, frowning, "us kids never stopped wondering where you went."
Sam passed Charlie in the hall and raised an eyebrow at Cas. "Getting mated?"
Castiel nodded, "yes, alpha Dean. I want to. Show me everything."
"Thank you Charlie. Will this make my scent change?"
Castiel smiled, "You did fine before I came along. You can do just as well or better with me here. I'm not leaving your side, but I will stay here tomorrow with Charlie. I'm still nervous around John."
Dean smiled, pressing a kiss to the side of Castiel's head and sitting at his desk, flipping open a folder and booting up his expensive looking computer. He began to type at a rapid pace, calculating and recording transactions with the business and any notes, complaints or progress. He looked up at Cas exploring his office occasionally and smiled before turning back to his computer.
Dean groaned, aiming there as he sped his hips up. He started fucking into him, holding himself up on shaking arms so Cas wouldn't have to hold both their weight, and felt his knot start to grow.
Sam grinned, "pretty sure the guy who played Chewie was much taller than I am, Cas. Its flattering you think I'm that tall, though." Dean just smiled, kissing the side of Castiel's head as he sipped the beer he had in the hand not wrapped around Cas.
They stepped into the kitchen and Castiel looked around at all the omegas in there making dinner. He watched them closely, curious to see what they were doing and how. The head chef smiled as she approached. "You must be new here. I know all the omegas in the mansion. Would you like to help cook?" Castiel smiled and nodded and was immediately given the job of cutting some vegetables.
Charlie laughed, "unhealthy now and then is fine, Sam. I can get you one of the healthier options."
strapped in his detachable car seat. Jack was staring at Castiel with a gummy smile, his little
"I..." Dean paused, sighing, "unfortunately, yes." He stroked hands down Castiel's back, "I'm sorry things have become so difficult, Cas. You must hate me by now."
Sam sighed, "it's complicated, Adam. Really complicated. And you know I have no ill feelings towards you, but Dean... he's stubborn, and kind of an ass. I think maybe Castiel will help him see he's wrong."
"Make sure to call us when Castiel's niece comes. He loves pups, I'm sure he'll want to see you," Dean said softly. His alpha instincts were soothed by a pupped person nearby, probably a lot of why he'd calmed down, and he hugged Anna gently, "it was a pleasure to meet you."
Dean stood frozen, gaze traveling from Castiel's bare feet to the tip of his head and slowly back down, "Jesus fucking christ. Cas, you look amazing."
"Oh um. He wanted to see him alone, sir." the servant mumbled, and lowered his head quickly when Dean glared at him. Castiel's heart sped up. Alone?! He couldn't go see that alpha alone. What if he was to punish him, or want to 'test' him out? "Alpha dean..." Castiel took a breath, trying to not panic.
He looked down, now nervous again as he started to fidget. He played with the hem of the shirt he was wearing to avoid looking at the alpha. He actually liked pups, but his body was so tired and if he had them here, he had no guarantee Dean wouldn't take them away too. Castiel couldn't live through that, not again. He also thought about Dean's father. He hadn't met him yet, but from what Sam said about him, and the attitude Dean had mentioned, he wasn't sure he even wanted to see him. He was so conflicted, and when he looked back up at Dean his eyes were damp. "I'm sorry I don't know things, alpha."
"Okay. Is it for Jack Novak?" The receptionist asked. Once Castiel confirmed with a nod of his
He grabbed Castiel by his neck, pinning him back against the table, "you think having sex with such a well to do alpha is so bad? Maybe I should have every alpha in the ballroom knot you right now, omega slut."
Sam sat there, letting Castiel eat and get some air. "There. Feeling better again?" he asked with a smile. Castiel nodded but didn't say anything, staring at the ground.
"Castiel loves you. Ceremony or not. To him, you have to be the best thing he has ever had gotten in life. He came from a breeding house right? How many of those omegas get to have an alpha that would do half of what you have for him?" Charlie stared him down.
"Castiel? The omega from the breeding house?" Felix asked, and the moment the words "breeding house" were said, the kitchen staff moved away from Castiel as if he had the plague. Felix looked at Castiel disapprovingly, "This is not how you should be behaving. Perhaps I take you to speak to Master Winchester." Castiel tensed and looked at the brothers. They wouldn't allow that, right?
Castiel watched and started to walk over but Anna lightly gripped his wrist, "just wait a moment Cassie."
Dean squeezed him back, laughing a little at his enthusiasm. "Hey, have fun with Charlie?" he smiled gratefully at her and ran fingers through Castiel's hair.
Charlie chuckled, "He's cute for an omega, but you know me Dean. I like the ladies a bit more."
The next morning Charlie came in to ask if they wanted some breakfast burritos, but stopped seeing them in the nest sleeping. She chuckled and got out her phone and took a picture of it, then left to let them sleep. Once in the kitchen she smiled at Sam, "they are so stinking cute. Have you seen the nest Cas made for them?"
"An Mma alpha fighter?" Dean's instincts were already on alert. His inner alpha was telling him if Lucifer ended up not liking him hed have to fight for Castiel's affections. Silly, primeval thinking but something he couldn't help.
Dean began to strip Castiel and kissed every bit of skin he could reach as more of it came into view, dragging his tongue down Castiel's belly, tugging down castiels sleep pants and taking his cock into his mouth with a moan.
The staff tensed at that request and looked slowly to Dean to see if it was okay to do it. When Dean reluctantly nodded, the staff obliged, while Castiel watched them and wondered why they looked so nervous to make Adam food. It's not like he was an axe murderer, he was a nice person and had been so kind.
Castiel whined, "but why does it have to be this way? If I want to present to you, I want it private, only for you to see. I don't want the world to see me present and stare at me, wanting me. I only want that from you," he said softly as he nuzzled him, getting as close as he could to him.
Castiel watched as Deans face got closer and closer to his. He tilted his head up just a little to have their lips touch, light and soft.
Dean made a soft noise as Cas climbed back in the nest, pulling him into his arms and blinking slowly at him. "You okay?" he asked, voice rough with sleep.
Castiel stopped, looked at the door, and bit his lip. "I'm going to get some money," he said softly as he started to open the door. He wasn't sure if Sam would stop him or not.
Castiel nodded, "I heard how much they got for me since I was 'untouched'. Did they even act sad that I was gone?" He got the cake and put it in Charlie's cart.
The next day around 11:30, a knock came at his door. He had just laid Jack down for his nap, so he quickly went to answer it. When he opened the door, he saw two men standing there. One had shaggy brown hair, the other.. He had short sandy blond hair, with bright green eyes. And, he had freckles dusting his face. Both were in suits, and when the blond looked at Castiel he said, "Good morning Mr.Novak. I'm Dean Winchester, and this is my partner Sam Smith. We're here to check on the pup you found. And to see if your house, is safe for a young pup."
The MC announced it was time for the first dance of the new couple, and Castiel gave Jack to Gabriel, know Gabe would let him have some cake. He walked out to the dance floor with Dean and smiled up at him as they waited for the music. "How do you like everything?" he asked.
"Okay. It can wait for now, alpha. I'm still learning how to text on Charlie's phone," he replied as he looked out the window.
their direction as he held the door open for them. “Thank you both for stopping by and making
Castiel walked over and nodded, "Yeah, honestly I don't know anything about them. I came from a breeding house, so..." He looked down and trailed off, hoping she wouldn't leave, disgusted that he had been in a breeding house.
Dean squeezed Castiel to his side and nuzzled his neck. "I know. Are any of your brothers mated?" he asked, curious.
The beta looked him over for a minute before giving a nod. "Yes, you're to be taken to my masters at the Winchester mansion. They await your prompt arrival, omega. I'm here to take you there. Hurry up now." The beta turned, indifferent about this omega. The scent or admittedly slightly run down sight wasn't anything special to him.
"I see," Dean wiped his greasy hands off on a rag, "well, I won't tell you where to go or who to hang out with, and I guess Adam is safer than anyone else except Sam." He turned to look at him, "why dont you eat lunch with me and then go back when I have to go to actual work with dad? I just don't hang out with Adam."
Sam looked torn, trying to figure out what to do, "maybe he shouldn't be speaking this way, but he does belong to Dean. Dean should be the one who decides the punishment and how to go through with it." Sam knew his brother would be kind, "besides, he's new. He isn't trained like the omegas in the past. Let Dean train him before judging his fitness."
"You mean you calmed him down. I doubt any of the rest of us could have," Dean told him as he took a right turn, "it's obvious they all love you very much. We should get you a phone so you can talk to them all the time."
John looked up from a news letter he had and cleared his throat, "has that omega I bought you been fitted for its dress yet?" He set the paper down, not happy at all with what he had been hearing about Castiel and Adam. He got the omega for his alpha sons, not that embarrassment of a beta to fuck.
Dean shook his head, "I've had many, many invitations, but I've never actually been. My mom would have killed me for even the thought, if she were alive."
"Birth control?" he looked at Dean a moment, "that would probably be a good idea."
Castiel thought about that. Four pups... that didn't sound so bad. Maybe four would be good. They would be safe here and Dean would love them, and keep them all taken care of, no matter what they presented as. "I don't know. I'm still getting used to having a choice in what I wear, eat, and other things. I know however many I have they will be safe and loved by you." He then leaned up and licked at Dean's neck, in a playful mood. He nipped lightly, growling playfully, wanting to see if Dean was also in the mood for some play.
Dean's alpha scent flared sharply with protective jealousy, but his voice was calm when he spoke. "Because my dad loved him best. Until he presented as beta, Sam and I were nothing. If Adam was an alpha, you and I would not even be here right now," Dean pushed away his plate, his appetite gone too. "He's a good enough guy, but I have no desire to make friends with a half brother who grew up a spoiled brat, while I raised Sam for my absent father." He looked up at Cas, green eyes tinged with red, "and now he's got you loving on him. Figures."
Castiel smiled, "no. A small bruise, but I'm okay. Thank you." He then hugged him and Gabriel smiled.
Castiel smiled and softly said, "I got this just for you alpha, come to bed." He then got on his knees on the edge of the bed closest to his mate and motioned for him to come closer.
"Okay. We can do that, that way you can have sex anytime and not have to worry about pups," Dean went to find Charlie, she'd know the best brands to get.
I apologize for the shorter, dialogue filled chapter. I struggled with a good cut off point. Thanks for reading!
Charlie nodded and glanced in the rear view mirror, "sure. Coffees for everyone?"
Castiel smiled, "You're right, Dean. I can't wait to meet my niece."
Michael looked horrified, coming to look at Cas. "Thank God you're still here and safe," he looked up at Dean, "we saw what you did on tv. Thank you. We all know what would have happened if an alpha didn't step in."
Castiel looked up to Dean, grinning in wonder. "He's so beautiful, and gentle. He's nothing like I thought, Dean." Castiel didnt realize he hadn't called Dean by his title, so comforted by his presence that it didnt cross his mind He was just so amazed to be touching a horse, it was like nothing he'd ever felt or expected before.
This was nirvana.
Cas smiled, "Dean.. you saved me. Of course he'll approve." He nuzzled him gently, "don't worry so much."
Dean looked at him, "Charlie Bradberry? She's a very good pediatrician. Great choice." Castiel smiled at Dean, "Thank you. I looked up the best for Jack, and she was at the top of the list." He replied with a knowing smile. He had spoken with Charlie for over and hour about Jack. Asking all the questions about the things he would need to keep the small pup safe and healthy.
"It's okay, Cas. If I had to sell it, this is one thing mom would have been okay with," Dean kissed his head, then stripped Cas to the silk gown under his dress. "Get into bed. I'll be right there," Dean told him quietly, going to take his tuxedo off.
The days passed and soon it was the night of the dinner. Castiel was a little nervous as he put the omega dress on, and then the shoes. Dean wasn't allowed to see him until the servants were done with his hair and make up, which took a while as his hair did not want to behave. Once it was done he was led out to the front door where John, Sam and Dean were waiting. "Alphas, we present Castiel," one of the servants said and moved to the side to show the alphas the dressed up, lovely omega.
Dean growled softly, holding Cas tight, "Felix will never get me to let you go. You're mine now, and I want to mate you and have you here the rest of our lives." He tilted his head back to let Cas rub and kiss at his neck. "I'm sorry for seeming like I'm not trusting you, but its Adam I don't trust. Not you.
Dean shrugged, taking another bite of spaghetti and looking at the film. "They kinda did the same weird timeline thing with the Marvel movies too. I feel like nerds just wanna overthink things," he winked at Charlie teasingly.
"If Dean, Sam or Charlie isn't around, yes." Cas admitted softly, "but Charlie is teaching me self defense.
Dean stared, enraptured, his jaw slightly dropped and eyes shining. Fuck, Castiel was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and Dean felt like the luckiest alpha alive right now. Castiel almost looked like an actual angel as he stepped down the aisle. Everything else melted away.
"You could make vlogs. Those are like video journaling. And sometimes people that do only do that get really popular." Castiel looked at Sam and nodded, maybe he could do that.
Castiel nodded and said, "Thank you, alpha Dean." He smiled, this felt better, and hoped he would remember this. Castiel relaxed and dozed off on Dean's lap, going limp against his chest and making Dean chuckle softly.
The months passed quickly and soon it was time for the ceremony. Charlie helped Castiel pick a beautiful beach where they could do the ceremony, and now he was in the dress he'd so happily picked out. It was off white, light and had just a little sparkle to it. It wasn't see through, but very beautiful and fit him just right. The stylist and makeup artist did his hair and make up and soon he stood next to the blinds, peeking out. Dean had not seen him in two full days, and in a few minutes he would be walking down the aisle. Sam stood next to Dean at the altar. John was there, in the front row, and was told to behave or he would be made to leave. Adam sat a few seats away from John. On Castiel's side were all his brothers and his sister, Charlie, and little Jack, who was in a little tuxedo.
Dean immediately shook his head, frowning. "No, sweetheart. No pup of mine will ever be taken away. Girl or boy," he nuzzled along behind Castiel's ear. "You'll never have another pup taken away again. I promise."
When Castiel woke up he yawned and blinked slowly, "What time is it?"
Well, he supposed it was no longer all he had as he followed Dean into a large bedroom and saw some bags of new, designer clothes. He stood there a moment before saying, "Those...are for me, alpha Dean?" He didn't know what to think.
Another long dialogue full chapter but gives some insight into Castiel's personality. I PROMISE next week is siblings day! Enjoy.
Dean echoed the moan, his hips rolling, not slow but not rough either, enjoying the sensations of Cas around him, leaning to kiss him again. As Castiel approached climax, writhing under him, Dean knotted inside him and Castiel spilled over his belly. Nothing ever felt so right.
Charlie laughed, "well, thank you very much. I like your eyes, they're very pretty." She plopped down on a chair, crossing her legs, "so, mating ceremony?
"Stepping down as CEO," Dean replied quietly, putting the fruit in a ziplock and into the fridge, "he'll probably offer it to you, out of spite."
"Sure, Cas. Why don't you get us something to drink and fix the nest. I'm almost done, I'll meet you there," Dean helped Cas gently slide off his lap.
NSFW content during the whole chapter. Skip if that's not your thing :)
Dean leaned down to kiss him, his hand running down Castiel's side and grasping his cock, stroking it as he pounded in.
He looked at it curiously before opening the door and slowly stepping into the room. The scent was stronger, but he didn't see anyone yet. "Hello? Is anyone in here?" he asked, looking around.
"Cas, do you like coffee?" he asked, realizing the only drink he knew Cas liked was soda.
After a bit Castiel dozed off and Charlie smiled, "he had a busy day. I'm surprised he made it this long."
Sam waited until John left to say, "I don't know how he pulled that off, but Castiel is going to be thrilled to get to see his pup."
Sam smiled, "any time. Now that you're feeling better, I'm going back to the kitchen. Would you like to come or stay here with Dean?"
Dean frowned, "that's barbaric!" He looked at Sam, both of them wearing shocked expressions, and turned back to Castiel. "Cas, we're not going to hurt you. I know that must seem really hard to believe right now, but we'll show you. Neither of us is going to touch you without consent. You deserve respect, okay?"
Dean scoffed as his father left his wing of the house and turned back to Cas. "Sorry. Dad has a really backwards view on omegas, especially since my mom died." Dean cleared his throat, trying to move on, "so, sleeping arrangements. I'd prefer you sleep with me, get used to my scent, cuddle up at night. But, there's a cozy couch if you dont feel comfortable doing that. During the day I'd like you to stay close. The servants usually know better than to touch but the few alphas we have on staff may ignore that if they find you tempting enough. You can wear whatever you want, I'll ask if I want you to wear something specific or if we're going to an event. Questions about any of that?" Dean still kept a respectful distance, obviously not about to pounce right now.
Castiel bit his lip as they drove down the road. Sam did not look happy in the mirror. "Are you sure you're okay?" Castiel asked, trying not to giggle at the sight. He looked over to Charlie and saw she was trying not to smile either.
Sam happily watched Castiel work, he seemed to be fitting in well. He softly asked Dean, "do you know the name of the breeding house dad bought him from? Maybe we can find out a bit more of what he went through there."
Felix had had enough of eavesdropping and burst in, arms crossed. "Just what, omega, do you think you're doing in here?" his gaze landed on Adam's hand resting on Castiel's knee and he frowned even more.
Alone...alone was never a good thing. It meant pain, no food, no light, nothing good came from being alone. He curled in to protect himself as it was the only thing he could think to do, trying to slow his pounding heart.
The next day while Dean was in his shop, Castiel went to look around. He was careful to stay in Dean's side of the house, not wanting to risk his safety. He stopped at a window to look outside and smiled as he saw the pool down the way. He would have to ask Dean to take him soon, while the beautiful weather lasted. Castiel moved along the hallways and stopped when he caught a new scent. It kind of smelled like Dean, but different, and not as similar as Sam. He followed the scent and soon found a door just between Dean and John's sides of the house.
When lunch arrived, Dean got a beer while Castiel got water. Cas stared at the water and frowned, "could I have soda instead, please?" The omega staff member shook her head, "I'm sorry, but we were given orders that you can only drink water, certain juices, or milk."
Castiel smiled proudly, "thank you. I'm feeling okay. Can I get up to stretch some?" He was still a little groggy, but waking up.
Gabriel stood there looking confused, "this is all a lot. Are you Castiel's mate?" An omega and omega? "Who's Dean? Why are you so scared?"
"I don't know why you don't trust him, but if you trust me then know I am not doing anything with him, and I never will," Castiel replied with a smile as he nuzzled him a bit longer. When he slowly sat up he some again more quietly, "I know you have your reasons, but I would like to keep Adam as a friend. He can be someone to talk to when you're busy or not here. I think I'd be safe with him, since your dad is disappointed he is a beta and doesn't come by often."
Castiel had been on his morning jog, when he heard a crying pup. It was a chilly, foggy morning, so Castiel got worried. And started to follow the pups cries. It took a few minutes, but he sound found the pup. He was bundled up in some blankets, all alone among some ferns. He looked around for any signs of anyone else being there. Seeing none, he carefully lifted the pup up off the damp ground. Then as he held him close, he said, "Shh... It's okay pup. Your.." his voice faded as the pup calmed, and looked up at him. With such soulful, loving eyes. That is when the alpha, felt his wolf claim this pup as his own. He wanted to protect it, and he smiled gently at the pup as he said, "Let's go home Jack. It's to chilly for a pup as small as you." And he did just that. Taking Jack to his home, and calling the police to report what happened.
Dean reached them first, teeth snapping as he slugged the alpha who'd grabbed Cas across the face, snarling, "fucking asshole." Blood red eyes burned into the man as he huddled Cas behind him.
Lucifer put Cas down and came sniffing around Dean, who tensed and fought the urge to growl his dominance. Nobody was challenging here, at least not yet.
Dean pressed a kiss to his neck, bringing him back to the present, "I know you're scared. I would be too. But, you're mine and I will protect you, even if it costs favor with my father."
For Charlie's part she just seemed to just dismiss this fact, "well you've been missing out! Let's go over some samples I've done in the past." She flipped open her tablet and beckoned him over, showing him photos and videos of other ceremonies.
Dean leaned against the taxi window, staring blankly outside. This part of the city was not one he traveled often, and it was far enough away from home that the taxi fare was pretty expensive. "Definitely have to find a pawn shop tomorrow," he mumbled, handing the last of his cash over in the hotel for a room with two twins. Cas and Dean would just have to squeeze tight. Dean already missed their nest.
Sam stood next to his brother and listened to him. He would do as Dean said, but would let Dean keep most of the company itself. He liked the meeting people and going places and they had agreed he would be the face of the business.
John looked at him, confused, "what have I done you would ever thank me for?"
Castiel nodded and said, "I know, but a lot of alphas think that if an omega isn't marked, then they can do as they want to."
Castiel remembered this beta, and moved quickly to hide behind another omega. Felix did NOT look happy and he glared at Sam and Dean, "really, young masters? You know how to behave like proper young men. You should not indulge in this foolishness."
Dean growled under his breath, "okay, I'll be right there. Thank you." He kissed Castiel's forehead, "why don't you finish with the nest and I'll bring back dinner, then we can continue where left off." He kissed his lips lightly and reluctantly let him go.
Castiel smiled, "yes especially those ones." He pointed at the screen, "I think they called them French Bulldogs." He got up and went over to Dean and nuzzled the back of his neck, sensing his tension.
He handed Charlie his phone and she took a picture, and also added her number to Gabriel's phone, "in case you need to get ahold of each other.
"Not yet. Michael..he...um...he told me he can't have pups," he replied, not wanting to embarrass his big brother.
His eyes were mostly omega gold, specks of his blue shimmering slightly. "Alpha Dean. Oh God, I need you," his mind blanked out on what he was even saying. This had never happened for him before, even in heat.
Castiel agreed and headed to the kitchen to get some drinks for them. He asked for a beer for Dean and some juice for himself and then shyly asked if they could make something special for their dinner since Dean worked so hard. He then started to make a better nest for them to sleep in. He was proud of the finished product, hoping the staff wouldn't mind all the pillows he stole to make it.
"Not yet, but we'll have a ceremony someday and he is going to mark me then. Right, Dean?" he asked softly.
Dean pressed kisses down his jaw and to his lips, kissing him for several long moments before pulling back to let them both breathe, rolling them so Cas was on top and Dean wouldn't squish him.
Dean twitched as he heard a clatter and a curse,  a servant knocking lightly, "I apologize, alpha, i dropped the breakfast plates. I'm going to clean up and fetch new ones."
"Of course. They're all very friendly. Come with me." Dean held a hand out in an offer to hold Castiel's own, hoping he would accept.
Sam grinned and shrugged, "we know. Maybe while we are here you could help him learn a few computer things? He doesn't even know how to use a cell phone."
The hot shower felt so good, and he lathered himself with the nice soaps and shampoos. He smiled, feeling much better now that he wasn't covered in mixed smells. It was just his scent now, and he couldnt remember the last time he'd been this clean.
The tailor smiled and nodded, making a note, "we will get right to work on the dress. What about shoes for it?" Castiel looked at Dean for this, "you pick the shoes, Alpha. I don't know much about shoes."
Dean smiled, pressing a long kiss to Castiel's forehead, "really good news, sweetheart. No one is gonna have to sell anything. Charlie invited us to stay with her. I'm gonna call her now."
Dean arched, giving a growl, "oh fuck, yes." He rolled his hips, pushing deep and rolling back out as gently as possible. His eyes turned dark orange as green rimmed with red, hands sliding over every bit of skin he could reach on Castiel.
"I'll show you," Sam sounded surprised, but didn't skip a beat, "you'll need to do that for a lot of things in the future anyway. Everyone does." He reached the kitchen and everyone waved, "anything in particular, Cas?"
"Did you want to stay separate from everyone? Did you want me to help you through it? Do you want condoms?" Dean asked, looking concerned.
His eyes closed as he moaned into Dean's mouth. Fuck, it felt so good, better than any alpha he ever had. He hoped this was it, pictured himself being with Dean, only Dean, like this for the rest of his life.
Castiel looked up to Dean with a smiled and nodded, "I do."
"I promise, Dean. I love you too," Castiel whispered softly as he held onto his mate.
"Sam and I now own and run the company and own the mansion and servants. Dad is retiring to the country villa," Dean plopped on the couch and pulled Castiel into his lap, "and felix is going with dad."
TW: brief mentions of Castiel's past suicidal thoughts
Dean nuzzled along Castiel's jaw, switching the subject to something more light. "I like these clothes on you," he said with a smile, "they're pretty and yet not too revealing."
Dean narrowed his eyes, "well, Sam isn't wrong, but you aren't wrong for having a reaction like that either. Things are going to be different now."
Castiel was silent as they walked to John's office. He nodded at Dean and turned to the door and knocked, his heart racing. John called for him to come in and he slowly stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. "I was told you wanted to see me, alpha?"
Castiel purred and nodded, "your omega is very willing, alpha." He leaned up to kiss him. Dean had actually asked if he wanted it, Castiel would never get used to that as long as he lived. He was already happier with him than he had been in 5 years, if not more.
Gabriel's expression softened and he smiled at the expression on Castiel's face, ruffling his hair. "He does sound like a good alpha. And pretty handsome too." He looked at the picture again, "hey, have Charlie send a picture of you two together and I'll show it to all your brothers and sister, okay? I gotta get home to get ready for work. When you get a phone, let's chat." He hugged Cas tight and breathed him in one more time, "missed you, baby bro."
Dean hummed tunelessly, ruffling his hair and watching the show, already feeling sleepy from lack of endorphins.
"thanks for giving us a ride though, Charlie, we didn't have enough money for a cab."
Dean leaned down and kissed him again immediately, a little more firmly this time, his tongue coaxing Castiel's lips open and sweeping inside, tangling with the omega's own tongue. He hardened under Castiel, even though he was fighting his arousal, inhaling deeply as he kissed him and drawing in the wonderful scent of his partner. Dean growled softly, shivering at the hint of tempting slick.
Dean growled, eyes darkening to alpha red as he kissed up to Castiel's lips, his hand rubbing Castiel gently through the pretty panties
"Facing off. They need to make sure the other alpha is okay around you and the betas here," Anna whispered, watching as they postured a second before slowly relaxing, and Dean reached out a hand to shake that Lucifer took. "Thanks for taking care of my brother, " Lucifer said quietly.
Castiels eyes widened and he rushed down the hall. He didn't even think about what would happen to himself. He had to help Adam. As he got close to Adam's room he heard screams, "Dad! Stop, please!" There was a slap followed by a yell of pain as he was hit again.
Charlie was close to tears hearing that. Cas had thought seriously of suicide, and that was heart breaking.
"Yeah, you can enter," Dean called back, sitting up straighter and shifting in a protective stance in front of Castiel out of instinct.
Dean stared at him, heart shattering, unable to say anything. He pushed the jello aside and pulled Cas into an embrace, burying his face into Castiel's neck, "no. You're not allowed to leave me, okay? There will never be anyone like you. I need you."
Felix noticed Cas going in and out of Adam's room and leaned against the doorway frowning. He looked up as Dean walked past and cleared his throat. "I wasn't aware you were going to gift this omega to your youngest brother," he commented, making sure he was loud enough to be heard inside the room. Dean growled, fangs bared, making Felix take a quick step back. "Yeah, I wasn't aware either. Go away, Felix."
Dean smiled happily, pulling Cas into his arms, "I'm so glad to have met you all. I look forward to getting to know you all even better in the future."
Dean sat at a nearby table to eat, pressing a kiss to Castiel's lips and giving him a cheek rub to leave at least a little scent behind. "Theres actually something I have to tell you," he spoke up after they were both settled, "there's a benefit charity dinner coming up and my father, Sam and I are expected to attend. I'd like you to accompany me."
Dean smiled at that, touching her hand gently, "thank you. It was very important to me that his family be accepting."
"It should be fine. Theyll tell you if they need anything specific," Dean stripped down and tugged on clean clothes, sighing. There was a knock a moment later and the beta tailor and an assistant breezed in, "this must be the lovely omega. It's a pleasure." The beta smiled, "now if you would please stand on this block and hold very still, I'll take measurements." Dean stepped back to watch, curious about the process.
The contract had an add on that stated that Castiel had rights to see Jack, and the little boy's father agreed as long as Sam or Dean was there to pick him up. Dean looked over at Sam, not sure if that was a good or bad reaction as he leaned over to look. He almost dropped the papers he was signing as he grabbed it to read it again, running his finger along it. His jaw clenched and he nodded, "thanks, dad...really. this is what he always dreamed."
Dean chuckled as Castiel started a playful flour war by tossing some in the air, giggling. Castiel's quiet giggles turned into a loud laugh when Dean got hit by some of the dust. The omegas played around happily as the flour continued to fly, everyone jumping in to take part. Cas couldn't believe no one was yelling at them for having so much messy fun.
Castiel smiled and nodded, chuckling as flour fell from his hair with the movement. He had no idea that at the other end of the mansion, a conversation about him was going on.
Dean squeezed his fingers lightly and led him to the french doors past the living area that led out into the mesh covered pool, sun streaming in. Dean set the towels aside and climbed in the shallow end, the water heated to a pleasant temperature, "here, hop in."
Castiel, in the meanwhile, had found some jello and his eyes widened as he hurried over to Dean,  "look Dean! It was a powder and now it's jiggly."
Dean drew him close against his chest. "I'm never letting you go back there, Cas. Ever." He locked the door behind them when they entered, Sam was the only one with a key, and sat on the couch, curling Castiel into his arms. "I'm so sorry he scared you. So sorry, sweetheart."
Castiel shook his head, "No, maybe we can look up his fights."
Dean just stared at him wide eyed and even a beta could probably scent the flare of arousal coming from him. Cas tended to cover up and dress conservatively on a normal basis, he didn't even wear pretty omega panties or anything, and while it disappointed Dean a little he'd never said anything because Cas was his own person and should be allowed to choose what he wanted. Now though, with Castiel's beautiful legs made longer from the high heels, wearing smoky eye makeup that made his eyes impossible bluer, and corset covered bodice with the beautiful dress, he was finding it hard not to pounce upon him right there in the foyer.
"Um, when a well to do alpha mates an omega theres a big ceremony. A wedding type of thing, if you've heard of that for betas. The only difference is a public marking. The omega usually plans it all," Dean explained as simply as he could.
"They lied to you, all of you. I presented when you all were out and they said I shamed the Novak name, took me to the breeding house and sold me for almost 600,000 dollars. Apparently, a young, untouched male omega was highly prized," he said softly, putting an arm around his mate, careful of the grill.
"The poor guy," she said softly and got up to get her keys, "I'm going to get birth control for Cas. Want to come with or stay here?"
They next were doing the traditional dance with family. Castiel was nervous when it came time for him to have a dance with John, but his brothers, Dean, Sam and Adam were there in case John tried anything. When John approached he did a polite bow then moved a little.
Castiel looked at Sam and then shyly at Dean. He didn't know what to do, he was being asked to make more choices. He liked being around Dean, but he didn't want to make him upset again.
Castiel smiled and kissed his lips. "Thank you alpha. I think you will like them," he said as he scented Dean, just so happy. He would get to see all his siblings again. "Maybe.. we can all meet at a park?" he asked thinking out loud and Charlie smiled,
"She's fine, cas. She's a beta, and mated." Gabriel hugged him, "she's definitely going to want to see you again."
"He was playing video games with Adam, not having sex. Trust me, I wasn't happy about it either," Dean crossed his arms, "and if he ever does have sex with Adam, I will personally punish both of them, hard."
Michael's expression had softened. "Cassie, I'm so sorry. I didnt know. I thought you went away with an alpha like mom and dad said."
"You're from the breeding facility?" Dean stepped closer, nostrils flaring as he took in more of Castiel's scent up close. Damn, the omega smelled as good as he looked. "Um. I'm Dean, Dean Winchester. That must have been my brother Sam you spoke to." Dean looked Castiel up and down, "you're perfect." He really was, the omega was small and slight, but still had muscle tone that spoke of the fact that he might be stronger than he looked. Giant, soulful blue eyes stared up at him, plush lips frowning slightly. Dean inspected what he was wearing and rolled his eyes. "Except for that awful dress," he added, "come on, I had them bring regular clothes for you."
flipping through the four pages of paperwork. He grabbed the pen hanging from the clipboard
Castiel blushed and nodded. "It was. I've never felt anything that good before," he replied with a shy smile.
The staff was quiet as they cleaned up, glancing at Dean, not sure how their second in command boss would take what Castiel just said before leaving the room.
Gabriel held his hands up immediately, taking a step back, "holy shit. Hold on, red. Just saying hi to my very long lost brother."
Castiel smiled and slid in carefully. The water was really nice, and he slowly started to walk around to get use to the feeling, gaining confidence to go towards the deeper end. When the water got to be chest deep he stopped and stayed back, not wanting to drown.
Dean woke up huddled over his omega in a protective stance, even unconcious his instincts had him protecting his mate. He checked his phone plugged into the wall and there was one message from his dad that was drunk and angry and said never to show his face again, and then surprisingly one from Charlie. He pulled away from Cas to listen better,
"Bee theme? That sounds adorable. I'm totally down with that," Charlie typed some more, "we can add the green in the florals. What kinds of flowers do you like?"
counter.
"I can beat my dad in a fight. But I'd rather it not come to that. If it does and I have to I won't hesitate, but..." Dean trailed off, thinking about his mother.
Castiel cuddled against him, listening. "What does he mean by properly acting like an omega?" he asked as he stayed in the position Dean had him in. He loved the few quiet moments like this they had had. It was nice, and almost reminded him of before he presented when his family still loved him.
Sam smiled at his brother and said, "you're a lucky alpha, Dean. Look at him. He loves you so much."
Castiel whined high pitched and anxious, "Not alone, please. Only bad things happen when I'm alone. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't leave me alone." He was curled in a ball protecting himself and flinched when Sam touched his shoulder.
Castiel smiled a little at what Dean said about his eyes. Most people didn't notice them, always more focused on his ass or scent. He looked at their hands, they seemed to fit so well together, Dean's calloused palms brushing his own, and nodded, "You can scent mark me, alpha Dean." He tilted his head back, exposing his neck for the alpha.
Dean nuzzled back, sad that castiel was having to go through this, "I know, baby. I'm so sorry this is happening. Omegas are just... it's society. I hate it, and you know I would never make you do anything of the sort."
"That's what I thought. Let's go home, Cas," Dean picked him up in his arms, curling him close. Sam hesitated only a moment before turning to follow them, his dad shouting curse words and threats at both his sons as they left.
Dean cupped Castiel's chin and rubbed his thumb across his bottom lip gently, looking thoughtful. "Okay. If you want to spend time with him, I won't argue. It'll be good for you to not be alone," he leaned in and kissed Castiel softly, running fingers through Castiel's already unruly hair.
Castiel loved the idea of a bee theme and nodded at that, then debated flowers, what actually was his favorite? "I don't know anything about flowers," he replied softly, "Um... but does the dress have to be super revealing like the others?"
"That's great. I'm glad he's looking into other options," Dean leaned his head on Castiel's shoulder. "Being around a pupped person made me so relaxed," he smiled, "I can't help picturing you like that."
Castiel nodded and said, "I know." He cuddled closer to the other, the makeshift pup between them. He loved Dean so much, but he missed his pups. He got to see Jack and wondered about the pups he didn't get to see. The oldest was five now and could be in school. His youngest would almost be one now.
Castiel leaned into Dean and began eating breakfast as Charlie showed Castiel how to take a birth control pill before having him take one himself. "Now these ones are for when you are in heat. Take one each day while your mind is still clear. Okay?" Charlie pointed them out and Castiel nodded,
complete smut, no plot for those who wish to avoid it
Castiel lowered his head a little, "I will alpha John. Thank you." He then took Dean hand and made sure to stay at his side as they left the mansion and got into the waiting limo. He leaned against Dean, mind racing as he tried to do everything right. Dean's scent was very calming, but when John's scent and cologne mixed in with Dean's he got insticually nervous. The ride to the dinner party wasn't long and Castiel waited to get out of the limo until last as he had learned it was to be done that way.
When Dean grabbed his wrists, Cas got scared, an unhappy alpha meant pain, and it spoke poorly of his obedience to be punished so quickly. Then he heard what Dean said, and noticed how gentle he was being.
"Kick ass," Dean laughed softly, "she was beautiful, smart, and strong. Raised us to respect everyone, especially omegas. She stood up for herself and knew what she wanted."
Castiel's eyes widened in awe at the suggestion, a grin appearing on his face. "Could I see the pool? And horses? I've never seen one in person before," he was so surprised that Dean was giving him so many choices. Omegas weren't supposed to get a choice in anything. "Can I pet one of the horses, please?" He asked Dean, voice soft and sounding more like a child then an adult.
"You mean more to him than any ring," Sam replied quietly, "he's doing this specifically to keep you safe from other alphas. Imagine how he'd feel if he knew he did all that and you ran off only to do what hes protecting you from?"
Cas frowned, "but why that way?"
Castiel nervously took Dean's hand and got to his feet. He didn't smile, but he wasn't as frightened now. He was trying to figure out what his part was here.
The next day they went back to the mansion as soon as John said all of his and Felix's things were gone. Castiel thanked Charlie for all her help and couldn't wait to see his new friend again soon. He was already planning on having his siblings over to visit and stay the night.
Castiel stood in the doorway and looked out at the city, he could hear people out and cars driving by. He didn't want to hurt Dean any more than he was already. "I don't want him to sell the ring and I don't know what else to do to help."
He slowly took Sam's hand and stood up, "I'm sorry, alpha. I lost my balance with how fast we were walking." He said quickly looking at the floor and bringing his hands down to his sides. This alpha was handsome, but.. his scent was a little off. It wasn't bad, just not what Castiel would normally find pleasing. Too spicy, like herbs that made his nose scrunch.
It was the news and it was reporting about the charity dinner last night. They were reporting on the omega that broke years of tradition by slapping an alpha and speaking out of turn. They spoke to some guests who were upset with Castiels behavior, but could understand it. They even had put a poll up to see if people thought Cas went too far, or if his actions were justified based on what was known and over 80% of people said Castiel was in the right. "Well damn. Cas made the news and people are backing him," Sam stared wide eyed.
