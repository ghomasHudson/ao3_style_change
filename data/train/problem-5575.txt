“Tony would never hurt me,” Steve said indignantly.  “And why would you *threaten* Tony? That’s terrible!”
“Merry Christmas, Tony.” He could hear the smile in her voice.
Steve gave a tight nod. Tony stroked his thumb back and forth across Steve’s wrist, trying to get him to loosen up.
Bruce fidgeted. “You realize I don’t have a suit, right? That’s not how it works.”
When Steve met Rhodey for the first time. Set a year and a half prior to the current Surrender timeline.
When he found his voice again, Tony asked in a joking tone, obviously deflecting, “Does that mean we have your blessing?”
The elevator doors opened on a pretty, plump teenager with short blue hair and lip piercings.
Steve couldn't keep back an incredulous snort. (Not cruel! Just wanted to pay for the pleasure of beating somebody up who couldn’t fight back.)
You're all simply wonderful!  Thank you for reading this!
Steve ran his fingers softly through Tony’s hair. He kissed his neck and Tony shivered and rubbed his body against Steve’s in a filthy motion.
“It’s okay, Steve.”  Tony just held him like that for several long minutes, breathing in unison, stroking Steve’s back and neck.  Little by little, Steve relaxed into his arms, pressing more and more heavily against his chest.
Steve jerked, pulling him up before Tony’s knees could touch the ground.
Tower now; and it was for the Avengers, not for the Stark.”
“Of course, sir. A most sound decision.”
Bruce chuckled.
Tony stopped moving his fingers and Steve bit his lip to stay quiet.
After a few moments of rapt contemplation, Tony turned to her with something bordering on irritation, “I sometimes wonder if you’re a mind reader.  You should be The Scarlet Witch, like on the radio, instead of the Black Widow.”
“Hey, gorgeous,” Tony called in that quiet, intimate voice the rest of the team never heard.  (Mine!)  Steve was tempted to turn around, but last time he’d been instructed to stay still, so he didn’t move.  Tony dimmed the lights.  He set a bottle, plate, and a small glass on the bedside table, then tossed a black bag onto the bed.
we’re doing.  It can go really fucking wrong and you could get hurt.”  Steve let out a skeptical little snort.  “Maybe not physically, but there are other kinds of hurting and—“  Steve opened his mouth to interrupt, but Tony pressed a finger to his lips.  “Shhh.  Just, wait.  Let me think for a second and finish what I need to say, then you can have your turn.”
Of course it
“If you’re looking for Bruce, you just missed him,” Tony called from under the altimeter adjustor.
Steve smiled.
“Captain Rogers,” he said with a nod.  The War Machine armor was standing at attention in the corner.
“So gorgeous like this,” Steve whispered. He sped his thrusts, hard and deep, while Tony’s cock, trapped between them, smeared their bellies with pre-come. “All needy and desperate and
“The point is, doing the research isn’t cheating.  It’s important.  No matter what, we’ll still figure out how
“Sounds good,” Tony said with a little smile.
“Anal sex:”
“What do you think, Mrs. Rhodes?” Steve asked politely.
Tony hadn’t, that was for damn sure. He smiled.
Rogers was holding out a steaming cup of coffee.  Tony barely glanced at him.
. Tony swallowed. He wouldn’t drag Katie Winters from her workshop.
Stupid.
Steve said he was perfect, but apparently regardless of his feelings--regardless of how much he
Rhodey shook his head.  “Nah, just a beer for me. Better take it easy.”
“Sure,” Steve said with a smile. “That coloring book is for Martha O’Connor. Maybe start there?”
Steve had nodded off in the armchair, but he came to--startled--at the sound of the door down the hall closing quietly with a snick. Potts left Stark—Tony—at a little after 4 am, heading for the elevator, no doubt to rest in one of the guest suites a few floors down. She didn’t even notice Steve in the living room. He considered calling out, asking after Tony—Stark—but decided against it.
(Huh.  That’s it? Does he not recognize us or just not care?)
large flat-screen tv, reading a book.
.  It made something inside him twist strangely, not the straightforward rush of lust that sucking Tony’s cock gave him.  The thought of it was less immediate, less intimate, than sucking Tony’s cock.  Would he enjoy sucking fake cock?  Practicing, preparing to please Tony?  Steve shivered, feeling a rush of that strange guilty-shame-pleasure he couldn’t quite figure out.  His cock was aching, thick and heavy between his legs.
. And at the first hint of a rumor about it I started getting calls from top Army brass asking about DOD contracts.”
“Understood.” Tony clinked his mug to Steve’s. “Coffee is sacred—I should never have questioned you, Captain.” Tony gave a joking salute.
poster in his dorm room, and Tony kinda fell in love on the spot. (Or imprinted on him like a sad little duckling—falling for the first handsome, trustworthy Dom he’d ever met.) He’d refused to believe that Rhodey wasn’t attracted to boys for a solid six months after that; Tony’d tried every pathetic romcom ploy imaginable to make him change his mind. (God he’d sucked at fourteen.)
“Cheers.”  Tony took a good long sip then a deep breath.
Tony swallowed. “But, maybe after we go to the ranch, if everything goes well, maybe then you could? Right?”
“Tony?” she repeated softly, reaching out to take his hand. “Can you hear me?”
Tony had already done all the piecing and pinning on Natasha’s uniform and was about to start stitching.
Tony stopped short.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(Huh. Not the enthusiasm he’d expected…)
Steve shrugged.  “Yeah.  It’s like they don’t want to risk overexposure.”  Steve took another bite of ham sandwich and watched Bruce rummage through the fridge.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Mmmm!”
Steve stood frozen.
Steve nodded and looked down at Tony with a soft little smile.
don’t get to come up with insulting Captain Nicknames—that’s my thing,” but what he really wanted to do was get away and not need to say anything.
“You don’t know?”
“Fine.  No battles or new appearances by that thing that’s top secret and you know nothing about.”  Tony shrugged.  “How are you?”
Tony leaned down and kissed him on the cheek.  (Oh my God.  In front of the team!)  Steve blushed, but it thrilled him.  (Not hiding. Never again.)
--want me to.  It’s not because I’m weak.  I never was weak—I mean, physically sure, but not . . . not
“Bruce and I are gonna peace out.  Tell Fury to put the mini-spectrometer on the quinjet in case the Force Field comes back; we wanna be able to mobilize that thing quickly.  Oh, and remind him that it’s
“Yes.  You hired him, Tony, though God only knows why!  He’s almost as hard to talk to as you are.”
(I thank God for you every day.  You’re my miracle.)
(Oh thank God.) It wouldn’t be unlike Tony to work right through Christmas and miss the whole damn thing. Not that they had plans or anything. In fact, Steve had some sort of mystery plan, but Tony still wanted to give him his new Avengers equipment on the 25
“That’s not really my scene anymore,” Tony said dryly. He nearly sighed aloud—looked like Belford was a bust. And Tony’d had such high hopes for him.
“Me too.”
Still, Steve got a jolt when he stripped off the plain brown paper to find the picture of a penis on the box. (
Jackie Lee was probably the most stereotypical girly boy sub Tony knew, though there were some beauticians in SoCal who would happily give him a run for his money. Jackie was enthusiastically flamboyant in his performance of a certain stereotypical version of subby; it was so overt it neared post-modern parody.

on about that.)
(It’s fine.)
Bruce nodded. “We’ll have the full results in another thirty minutes.”
Tony checked frantically that the Norton Dominator was fully concealed before calling, “Come in!”
“Great!” Tony grinned. “JARVIS, order my usual with a side of everything else. And check with the rest of the gang.”
“—I really have to go.”
Dummy offered him a new wrench, pulling him from his thoughts.
“Does it pinch anywhere?”
Tony gasped as Steve’s huge cock pressed into him, long and hard and slow like he wanted, a smooth deliberate thrust.
Ms. Potts looked visibly startled by Steve’s outburst.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, following Rogers out of the break room.  (The door was already open).  As they walked side-by-side down the corridor, Tony tried to put the fucking SHIELD Doms from his mind.  (Orientationist asshole sack of shit dickface moron
Tony released his grip and Rogers vaulted off to land squarely on what would have been the ogre’s back.  He made a stabbing motion with the SHIELD and JARVIS killed its lights.
(Goddamn. Was gonna give himself frown lines at this rate.)
Tony shook his head. “What is this shit? Captain America lying to the press? I thought you were like honest Abe. Or maybe biologically incapable of lying or something.”
“Can I help you?” Professor Ellis asked politely as he stepped out of his office and saw Steve waiting. His greying beard was meticulously trimmed, his old brown shoes carefully polished, and his old-fashioned jacket well brushed.
“I love you,” Steve said.
Rogers shrugged and added, tone almost back to normal, “So I won’t lay a finger on you. Besides, Tony’d be steamed if I did.”
“I should let you get some rest.”
Steve changed lanes.  Decision made, he felt a little calmer already.
. . . please, fuck me . . . please, I—“
She cleared her throat and looked over her shoulder. “Captain? Could you please carry Tony to the elevator for me?”
“Okay, Bruce,” Tony said, “Let’s get to work on these hypotheticals, shall we?”
This close, the lavender & sandalwood scent was more pronounced, blending with the scotch and abrasive antiseptic of Tony’s bandaged hands.

It was just as well Tony hadn’t needed an excuse for Steve. But, come to think of it, Steve hadn’t asked to come down to the workshop after their last training either. Tony shrugged it off.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “I’ll see you later.” The doors started to close, but Tony reached out suddenly to stop them. “Oh! And there’s a present for you in your bedroom.” Tony gave Steve a little wink and let the doors shut on his smirk.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You’re like a kindergartener.”
________________________
“How are you?” Steve asked.
Highly rated Michelin restaurants were know for their clientele—the chances of an optimistic paparazzo getting a shot of them on the way in was high. Their fellow diners probably wouldn’t bat an eyelash at their illustrious co-patrons, but ‘probably’ was still leaving things to chance.
(Always looking out for me, huh, Ms. Potts?)
Steve put his left hand across Tony's forehead to keep any stray drops from Tony's face as he carefully, so carefully, wet Tony's hair. Little by little, Tony relaxed again as, true to his word, Steve didn't let Tony's face get wet. Steve massaged Tony's scalp with his fingertips, working the shampoo to a foamy lather. Tony let out a loud groan. He sighed and went limp. Steve smiled. Steve tipped Tony's head back again, and carefully, carefully rinsed Tony's hair, making sure he'd gotten all the soap out of it, caressing the silky strands.
“How about seven?”
“Sorry,” he said abruptly, looking back at Tony. “I didn’t mean to go on and on.” He grimaced, embarrassed and apologetic. “Or talk about that. To you.”
Also, there's now an outtake conversation where Rhodey calls Steve as promised.  :) You can read it here:  http://archiveofourown.org/works/4511202
“You okay?” Tony asked quietly.
(Was I really his first choice? And the way he shot those orientationist a-holes down! Not that I needed
(Fuck.)
“Of course, sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you,” Steve said, trying to reign in his temper. “Perhaps you could tell me more about the position now?”
“Me too.”
She blinked at him, still surprised. (Had she really thought the ‘ooh, we’re both minorities and I’m so discreet’ was gonna have him eating out of her hand?)
“Can you stay like that for me?” Tony asked softly.  Steve couldn’t answer, just held his knees where Tony had placed them.
“What does that suggest to you?” Natasha asked.
“I meant it, you know,” Steve murmured, gazing down into his eyes.  “I’ve been holding the words in for so long.  Wasn’t how I meant to say it, but I do mean it.”  He licked his lips and smiled.
Steve gave a tight nod. With one last squeeze, Tony let go of his hand.
“Cap?”
Steve just frowned at him. A chorus of past lovers were buzzing in Tony's head: “Don't stay in the workshop so long, Tony.”; “You never have time for me, Tony.”; “I'm not a priority for you, Tony.”; “There's no room in your life for me, Tony.” It was hard to breathe. (Stupid, stupid, stupid.) And he couldn't hold it in, it was all so fucking unfair. It wasn't good enough. Nothing was good enough. It made him so fucking angry. And in the far corner of the workshop, the mangled War Machine armor, silent and reproachful, watched everything with empty eyes. Tony felt like a wire ready to snap, an overheated engine ready to blow, his whole body hot and throbbing with the anger and frustration and--
“Of course I do.” Steve was frowning, still looking confused.
. JARVIS replied that “Captain Rogers regrets he is unable to join you this evening.” Tony shrugged and ended up suggesting
“Thank you, Captain. I’ll add an appointment with Dr. Jefferson to your schedule shortly.”
“Fine!” Tony gasped.
“Oh,” Steve said, smiling at him again. “Thanks.”
“I believe we’re behind,” Natasha said to Clint as she fetched Tony’s vodka from the bar.
Tony pulled two slices onto a plate, long gooey strings of cheese making a mess on the counter.
(Good speech earlier. Sorry I thought you were an orientationist douchebag. My mistake.)
Tony didn’t fret. Much.
“YOU SHALL KNOW MY RAGE!”
Also another out-take of Steve with his running buddy!
“Got twenty-four little babies over there,” Tony said, gesturing to the skeleton portal devices and their tidy row of modified StarkPhone detectors and calibrators.  He took a long satisfying sip of coffee.  “And I’ve got some training robots that should be ready for our practices soon.  JARVIS can pilot them for us.”
Tony hugged Steve from behind, his bare chest and the exposed arc reactor pressed against Steve’s skin.  Steve’s breath hitched at the feel of Tony behind him,
“Hey, man,” Tony said, “Open yours now!”
Tony grunted and walked over to the bar.
“You’re doing great,” Tony reassured him, flying low to pluck a fallen Agent off the ground and away from two oncoming spiders. Tony shot at them.

"The arrangements are already under way and, of course, we'll bring gifts for the Stark family: King Howard, Queen Maria, and their son, Crown Prince Anthony."
“That’s Stark Tower,” the driver said with a snort.
Something about Bruce’s smile was . . . off. Tony hopped up and followed him. When he didn’t know anybody was looking, Bruce looked sad.
Everyone took a seat, except Johnny and Dominic who stood at the head of the table near the screens. Like the military, SHIELD loved their fucking PowerPoint.

Steve caressed the back of Tony’s neck, his hair, his shoulders as they kissed. Tony’s hands fumbled at the top button on his shirt as they kept necking. It was an uncoordinated, awkward tug-pull-pull at the buttons.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s it made of?” Fury asked.
“So,” Steve said, looking at Tony with some concern. “Can you tell me what happened at Stark Industries?  I never got a very clear picture from the little, ah, Pepper told me in passing.  Something about ‘R and D’ and cell phones and legal contracts?”
“Doctor Stark,” Johnny said blandly.  “Iron Man has two doctorates.”
Tony hopped up; Steve followed.
Steve sighed. Of course, with Tony in the clutches of his engineering genius, Steve still hadn't managed to talk to him about Agent James. The guilt was simmering in the back of his mind and, the more he thought about it the more worries bubbled to the surface.
Tony dropped the docile sub act completely and was around the table in a heartbeat.
Tony knew better than to yank against someone’s grip on his wrist, so instead he went limp suddenly, hoping to let his weight work for him and throw the Captain off balance. It backfired—Cap stepped around him and used Tony’s own weight to pull his arm behind his back and pin him helpless. Tony grunted.

“Did he manage to eat breakfast?”
“So,” Fury said, drawing the word out, long and expansive. Fury was sitting at an imposing mahogany desk. He gestured for Tony to take a seat in the low leather chair opposite; Tony remained standing instead. Fury did not get up. “You’re dating Captain America.”
“It’s perfect,” Tony said.  And it was. A miniature of the first bouquet Steve had given him: a red rose, yellow rose, and white lily.  (Love, friendship, and hope.) “Put it on for me?”
“Yeah, no. Just drop it on the floor.”
coming.
Pepper took three long, careful breaths.  “It’s a nightmare, but Tony’s working on it now so that’s good at least.”  She took a few more careful breaths and looked down at Tony’s blue and burgundy ties as though they might contain a solution.
“Dunno.” Clint shrugged. “He said you wanted more hand-to-hand training and asked me to step in.”
Her shoulders went stiff at the sound of his voice and she lifted a hand to her face.  (Wiping away a tear?)
the presents to Magdalene house in a giant bag over his shoulder.”
Tony licked his lips again—for a moment, it was hard to form words.
Tony made a dash for the shower, feeling sorry he hadn’t left himself more time.  He mentally reviewed his wardrobe as he bathed thoroughly. (Very thoroughly. Again. Hey, a guy could hope!) Burgundy shirt.  No! The red one. No, wait.  He grabbed three pairs of trousers, trying them on in rapid succession.  (Absurd.)
“Be right back,” Tony murmured.
“Well, there you go.” Tony toyed with his wrench. “Besides, it wasn’t a big Christmas thing. Mostly Steve was taking presents to an orphanage and volunteering and stuff.”
3:18 am.
“Lasagna?” Tony asked, turning to Steve.  “Your creation?”
“Sure you did.”
“I swear on JARVIS’s servers.”
“Hey, Bruce?” Tony said with a raised eyebrow, “I was thinking it might be time for tribbles.”
With a smile, Steve bowed and brought Tony’s hand to his lips, kissing it just above his knuckles.
Dummy whirred to life and wheeled over with an eager boop.
“You make the best pies,” Tony said. “Can’t buy pies as good as yours—trust me, I’ve tried.”
“See now, if you treat all your tech like that, it’s no wonder it keeps breaking, Captain Muscles.”
(It’s fine! Steve doesn’t give a shit about stuff or presents. He loves
Tony hesitated. He was hungry, and he did want to go to Ray’s—but he also didn’t want to. Rogers was . . . disorienting. The thought of Rogers and Rhodey together was even more so.
“Oh.  Okay.  Well, best of luck.”  He stepped out of the elevator.
Steve smiled. “Yeah, he is, isn’t he?”
Tony worked frantically—finally, finally making progress and absently devouring the pizza Steve had brought him slice by slice every twenty minutes or so.
“Yeah,” Bruce answered heavily. “I managed to stabilize you—used a modified adrenaline shot, if you were wondering—but we had no idea what you’d encountered up there. I used a combination of procedures for containing infectious disease. Hazmat suits, the whole thing, until I was sure you weren’t contagious.”
“Set the meeting with Rogers immediately post conference call, ok J?”
“All the more reason!” Tony grabbed a bottle of scotch. She smiled.
—  upsets you, use your safeword.  I’ll never be upset or angry with you for safewording, okay?  Do—do you understand?”
“Very,” Tony purred, running a hand up Steve’s chest. “What did you have in mind?”
“Good.” She rolled her shoulders and nodded.
She blinked. “Thank you!” she said, a little too loud. Then she seemed to gather herself. “Thank you, sir. And thank you for choosing Piacci Pizzaria this evening. Have a good night.”
Bruce shrugged. “I brought some coffee and wanted to see how operation Mantis Shrimp is coming along.”
“Now you know I try to be a supportive trainer,” Clint said.
“Well this is a surprise,” Tony drawled, flipping his face plate up.  “First to the party instead of fashionably late.  Somebody alert the press.”  Tony unhooked his arm from Bruce’s waist and added, “Must be your influence, Bruce.”
“How romantic!” Rebecca said with an encouraging smile.
“Yeah. Just I didn’t think—“ She fumbled for a moment, then blinked. “Tony, he brings you sandwiches.”
“Steve, for this to work, I need to know what you want and what you don’t want. Okay?”
“Thank you,” Mrs. Rhodes replied with a cordial nod.
“Point.” He took a sip. “Good to see you, Pep.” It came out more softly than he’d intended.
Tony felt a sharp jolt of anxiety as Steve stepped back to check the ropes at his wrists again, clearly preparing to move on.
“Well, I’ll just show you tomorrow!”
“Oh, nothing.” Steve shrugged. “Just a hobby.”
“Oh.” He blinked again. “Ok.”
(Oh my God. Does me mean? Is it maybe--) Steve took a deep breath. It would be rude to leave their guest alone. (And I'd rather Rhodey didn't see me blushing. . .) Steve shook his head. The mysterious present wasn't going anywhere. With a little smile, he returned to the sunroom and took his seat.
Tony’s fist clenched under the table. Steve would win the fucking bet—not that Tony’d thought for a second Steve was in on that shit. (Ok, fine: he didn’t think that
“Are you cold?” Steve asked softly.
Steve hesitated. He should really go to bed too.
Safely locked in the workshop, Tony called out: “JARVIS? Get me Rhodey, ok?”
“Jesus, whoa there,” Tony said. “What did it do? Insult your mother?”
She turned and poured herself another cup of coffee and added,  “Act normal. He’ll come to us when he’s ready.”
Tony shook his head and couldn’t quite hold back a little chuckle at how absurd he was being.
“Shit!” Tony turned to Steve, then back to Bruce, then back to Steve. “Steve! Sorry. I forgot I’m supposed to look at something, but I can be done in—Twenty? Thirty minutes?”
They both laughed and it maybe sounded a little nervous, but it still cleared the air.
someone at your birthday party.  If Colonel Rhodes hadn’t--”
Then Steve got this unfocused, far away look that Tony didn’t know what to do with.
“You say that like it matters. Why—are you tired?”
“Oh, whatever.”

“I know we were just joking around,” Bruce said, pulling Tony from his thoughts. “But I honestly am starting to like this elasticized poly-aramid idea. Is that crazy? It’s crazy, right?”
“We skipped dessert at Piaci, so I thought I’d serve it here.”  Tony took a little sip from the elegant blown glass, closed his eyes for a moment to savor it, then brought the cup to Steve’s lips.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
.)  He must have stared too long because Rogers shrugged again and said, “I don’t have much stuff.”
“You won’t be able to follow.”
Steve smiled as he took a step closer, coming into Tony’s space. He braced one hand against the wall and slowly leaned down to kiss Tony on the cheek. Just that—the warmth of him, the smell of him, the touch of his lips, his body so close—sent Tony’s heart racing.
we’re going to fail!”
going to tell Pepper that he got flustered on an
Pepper’s perfectly manicured nails scratched lightly at his scalp and Tony hummed in pleasure.  He could hear her tapping one handed on her tablet, still petting him.  The minutes slid by in comfortable silence and Tony hovered in that relaxed state right above subspace.  (Which was as close to it as he got these days, ever since— No.  Not thinking about that.)  Pepper rubbed the sensitive spot behind his right ear and Tony let out a long contented sigh.  He heard Pepper set her tablet aside.
They fell into the old, familiar groove of good-natured teasing, and all was well with the world.
Tony gave Steve an inquiring look.
Steve crouched down and tipped Tony’s chin up for a kiss, gentle and chaste.
“That sounds nice,” Steve said with a smile.
The new screens weren’t going well. It was almost like revolutionizing computer screen technology was
“I’ve got an update, Jim. The power’s out. The entire grid is down—they think it’s some sort of accident on the power lines. The generator kicked in at the SHIELD base, but the local staging ground doesn’t have one.”
“So,” Tony said, “I’ll slow down and instead of grabbing you, I’ll grab the shield.  So get a good grip on it, Cap, one that won’t break your arm.”
“Likewise,” Steve answered. They exchanged a solemn nod and Clint took his leave. Steve went straight to the taping station and began to wrap his hands.
“It’s not like that,” Tony said, tone unexpectedly harsh. He frowned and took a deep breath. “He’s my Captain. And Steve—he’s not . . . not like that. He’s old fashioned; he doesn’t just run around hooking up with people.”
“Yes, sir,” Tony said. (He coudn’t even be miffed Steve’s words were so clearly for him.)
ps. So sorry I still haven't written back to comments on chapter 30!  Am trying to balance answering comments and writing the next chapter, but I promise you I cherish all your kind words!  :-)
It was too hot and the air felt thin. Tony’s words made Steve’s cock leak and throb, but they made his stomach twist miserably too. Steve closed his eyes.
“Right.  Yeah,” Bruce said to the thick pile of Tony’s luxurious carpet. “I’ll just go.  Wait for you.  There.  In the lab. Yeah.”
“Look, Rogers,” Tony cut in.  “Things have changed, not as much as they should, but you sure as shit don’t have to act all alpha at me just ‘cause I’m a sub.”
Steve's stomach churned with dread. The guilt he'd felt over the past six days was no longer simmering-- it had positively boiled over.

“Don’t worry so much,” Mikie said, coming over to rest a reassuring hand on Cap’s shoulder. “You’ll do great. I lit a candle for you.”
After practicing on the water for a few minutes, Steve took the cock in both hands. And, well, surely this was a good time to practice technique, right? The room felt warm and Steve was starting to get hard. He licked his lips and eased the cock forward. He tongued the head for a moment before sucking it into his mouth. It tasted a little odd—a bit like plastic and nothing like Tony—which was viscerally disappointing in a way he hadn’t expected.

“Sure. That’s what they’re for.”
“A little harmless fun?” the Captain repeated blankly. There was a long pause—Tom could practically feel Rogers’ blood pressure rising as Dom smirked in silence.
Tony was looking at Steve with increasing horror, but having spoken without thinking a moment ago, he was especially anxious to find the right words now.
“I’m a billionaire because my dad was a multi-millionaire,” Tony said. “Most super-rich people are super-rich due to accidents of birth. That isn’t an accomplishment; at least Erskine chose you for the serum because of who you were before it. I’m rich by birth, and it’s easy to be a philanthropist when you’re filthy rich.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You got me,” Tony said, hand on his heart. “It was a pretext. Besides, why would I learn to cook brunch when I’ve got you?”
(Yes!)
UPDATE:  Because I'm presenting at an international conference soon (!!!) and then going on a hiking trip, there won't be an update until the first week of July at the soonest.  Please don't worry!  Story in NO RISK of being abandoned, but I won't be around until July.  See you then!
Dummy wheeled over enthusiastically.
“It’s being dealt with,” he said in a grim voice.
Steve held his wrists out to Tony.
“Were you always interested in poetry?” Tony asked.
Steve nodded.
Tony threw his phone back on the end table with a clatter.  He couldn’t stay there, couldn’t just wait.  He rushed down the hall, grateful to find the living room empty, and slammed the door to his little workshop.

As soon as the quinjet touched down, everyone sprang into action, moving the mini-spectrometer into place.
Tony watched, mesmerized by the sight of his erection disappearing between Steve’s now swollen lips.
Looked like one of the inner circuits was shorting, or the K-873 was rubbing its femur. Carefully and methodically, Tony started unscrewing the paneling to get a better look.
“You did great,” Tony said softly. “You’re really amazing, you know that? We, ah, we’re lucky to have you on the team.”
Tony frowned.
insult me as you do it.  But, yeah, okay.  As punishment I’m not pulling my punches for you this time.”
Tony looked up startled, then grinned.
“Okay,” Rhodey admitted, holding his hands up. “Maybe I didn’t
“I get it,” Tony said. “But you are so far from useless. You know that, don’t you?”
Tony gave Rhodey this helpless look, struggling for words.  Rhodey nodded, expression solemn, and said quietly, “I can’t imagine what that’d be like.”
Update!  Won't be back to writing properly until after Nov. 2nd, so a new chapter will probably be ready in the first week or two of November.  BUT!  I have posted a teaser for chapter 47 on my tumblr so you can get a little taste and don't worry this is abandoned.  :)  Hope you like! Kind words are cherished extra much while I'm in manic work mode!
Tony held Steve tight.  “Will I get to see it?” he asked.
Tony hung it very carefully in the center of the tree. He cleared his throat.
“Well,” Tony said with a bit of a smirk, “I’d hate to come between you and an eager model.”
“Thanks, sweetheart.”
Clint was stretched out on one of the long chairs reading a comic book, bag of chips at his side, and--
—but it was all in his head and her look was actually just friendly interest.  Maybe.  Probably.  He hoped.
“Great! Gimmie your coat, take off your boots, and hit the couch. I’ll bring over your favorites.”
“Mmmm?” he muttered, fumbling with a DVD case.
“You deserve it,” Pepper said.
Tony rolled his eyes.
“I know. But I want to.” Tony touched Steve’s arm and smiled. “You’re my friend.”
“Thank God,” she murmured.
Steve held his wrists out to Tony.
She rolled her eyes at him then turned back to Steve as she stood up. “If you change your mind, let me know. I’ll be in the gym.” She paused, then added with a little smile, “And, honestly, Steve—I really do think it would help.”
Then I don't care.”
“Sure.”
“JARVIS, run a comparison of the data points. First sign of a blip away from the last readings, I wanna know. If we get one, start running the hypotheticals asap.”
“Of course I can trust you,” Tony cut in. “If having nightmares about combat debarred you from service, the entire military’d have to resign tomorrow.”
“Well, that was then, this is now.”
he could do it in his sleep in half an hour in a cave with the most deplorable junk, but that wasn’t really the point.  There had to be a way to recycle this crap more effectively.  (‘Cause seriously, it’s ridiculous to let people dump their used electronics on Africa.  The crap people keep sending them is worth more for the copper than anything else . . .)  Dummy handed him an even smaller screwdriver and then, for no obvious reason, a Frisbee.  So, recycle or repurpose.  Actually repurpose.
Tony cleared his throat.
penetrated Steve.  Hell,
Tony suspected that Pepper had a chat with Bruce before she left; there was something uncanny about Bruce’s ability to channel Pepper, but since Tony adored her—annoying nurturing and all—he wasn’t gonna complain.  Much.
“Good morning, Tony,” Natasha said, automatically handing him a cup of coffee.
Little by little, conversation wound down and everyone said their goodnights until it was just Steve and Tony remaining in the living room.
“Huh?”
Nothing.
“Also, the approach of ‘If you really loved me, you’d do SM with me’ is reprehensible. . . If
Steve sighed and started making a pot of tea. He always worried about Tony a little when he went down his rabbit hole-- too little food, too little sleep, too much coffee-- but he knew that he was mostly just an over-protective mother hen (as Clint put it). This time it felt different somehow; the atmosphere in the workshop was . . .
you.”
Steve squeezed Tony’s wrists a little harder. “And I want you to answer ‘yes, Steve’ or ‘no, Steve’ when I ask you a question. Will you do that for me?”
haven’t read it, have you?”
“What’s wrong with taking Home Ec?” Rogers asked a trifle defiantly, chin up and Brooklyn lilt coming out with a vengeance.
“Love you,” Tony answered muzzily, his whole body lax.
“Uh.  Today?”
Steve just raised an eyebrow-- clearly a look he’d learned from Natasha. (Or Tony.)
Steve groaned. Tony savored his response, the sound of Steve’s labored breathing, the feel of the cock in his mouth, the taste of salty-bitter pre-cum.
“You and Rhodes--
“Hey, J? Gimmie Bruce’s notes on the dome model.”
.) He opened it with a certain embarrassed excitement, then hurried to shut his bedroom door. (Not that anyone would come on my floor unannounced, but still . . .)
And yikes.  As Tony looked around the ballroom it was a regular Who’s Who of Dominants he’d dated or fucked.
“Of course,” Bruce agreed.  (Exactly.  See?  No shame.)  Bruce took the lentils out and poked them with his finger before putting them in for a few more minutes.
“Why?” Tony asked, pulling away a little.  “Are you having doubts?”
“Look, Pepper, there’s, uh, something I should tell you.  Er, should have told you earlier really.  I mean, the team already knows.  I should have told you sooner—it’s just all been so sudden!  I—I’m seeing someone.”
“Rhodey,” Tony said urgently, cutting him off. “Cap hasn’t done anything wrong. Okay?”
The Captain nods and then says to the camera, “The Brooklyn Tigers?”
Rhodey was grinning.
*falls over exhausted*
“Come on over, Rogers,” Jerry said, patting the seat next to him. “Got a seat right here for you. I wanna hear this one direct!”
“I’ll send someone over to pick it up right away.”
They all nodded their agreement.
“Steve!”
“Little busy here, Cap,” Tony said, typing furiously.
“Don’t worry,” he muttered, “We’ll fix you up.”
“Amen,” Mrs. Rhodes repeated, as a smattering of the Avengers echoed it with varying degrees of awkwardness. Tony reached for his fork.
“No, you’re right,” Pepper said with a thin smile.  “I’m sorry.  Of course—of course things have changed in the Tower.  I just—   Never mind.”  Pepper took a deep breath, visibly putting the ghosts of their past back in a drawer as best she could.
for me, you were dying.  So, I repeat—are you all right?”
“May I--?”  Steve swallowed and started again.  “May I have the honor of leading you across the dance floor?”
“The resemblance really is striking,” Tony said, smoothing out the crumples that Dummy’s tight grip had put into the page. “Nice work. Dummy’ll probably insist I frame it.”
Tony’s jaw dropped.
“Have you decided what to wear?” Pepper asked over videoconference.
“Golly!” Steve’s eyes went wide. “Can I?”
Everyone nodded.
“Here,” she said, holding out a tiny dagger in a black leather sheath. It was slim, delicate—you could pick a lock or pierce a man’s heart with it.
On Friday, Clint and Natasha invited everyone out for drinks with a bunch of other SHIELD agents, but Tony could think of few things less delightful than alcohol plus agents, so, nope! He heard Natasha on the phone with Steve, trying to coax him out and saying in a significant tone that
Tony had made his proposition to Deetz on the dance floor, but they’d worked out the details between the gala and the hotel. (And had departed the ballroom discreetly and separately after Captain Overkill had already gone home.)
The Captain was looking down at Tony, eyes bright as he said, “I’ve heard so much about you.  It’s a real pleasure to meet you.”
“How are you?”  Steve asked as he leaned down—way down—to give her a very gentle hug.
wake up my mother.”
It didn’t work.
“Thank you, JARVIS.”
“Yes, Captain. And some of the lunch that Doctor Banner delivered this afternoon.”
“Mind? I’d be delighted. This time I’ll get the risotto!”
Rhodey cleared his throat and Tony recognized it for what it was: a hearty “is that enough talking about feelings and interpersonal shit? Please?”
“The whole thing needs to be strong, but also flexible. It was missing an integrated power source!” Tony cried, trying to not to go overboard with his ‘manic-genius-inventor’ enthusiasm.
“Mulled wine is ready!” Bruce called and they assembled eagerly—except Clint, who had already dashed over to the tree. Appropriately, “O Tannenbaum” came on as the rest of the team approached the tree to join him.
Steve’s hands left Tony’s ass and balls and he made a show of sucking on his fingers, laving at them wetly, as he looked up at Tony.  (Fuck.) Tony’s breath hitched and his hips twitched restlessly, cock bobbing.  Desperate to touch or be touched, he pulled at his restraints, putting more pressure on the column ties, which sent a rush of pleasure through him again.
(No. Don't interrupt. What he's doing is important. Important and urgent.)
And somebody should have told him what this movie was about!  Steve’s jaw dropped when Jack Lemmon started returning Osgood’s affections.  Golly.
“Seriously, Rhodey, I can’t upgrade the armor if I don’t know what went wrong.”
“Beautiful,” Steve murmured. He kissed first Tony’s right palm, then his left, and then held Tony’s wrists in a firm grasp.
(Shit. Today was looking busy all of a sudden.)
Tony shuddered, the tremor shaking his whole body in a wave that he realized distantly was relief.
And if Tony believed in telepathy or psychic projection or any of that crap, he might believe Natasha had it. How could the slightest furrow at her brow, the tiniest twitch of her lips express without words,
Tony knew better. (Had he actually expected--?) It was absurd.
“So beautiful,” he murmured.
. . . . . .. .  . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..  .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony tightened up one of Dummy’s screws, tested the joint, then paused.
Tony smiled.  “You’re welcome.”  He shook his head and added quietly, “And trust me, I know how expectations can be a burden.  But yeah!”  Tony shrugged into his hoodie.  “Anyway, we’re cool, right? Great!  Food!”
Tony paused in his second bite.  “So you brought me éclairs?  I thought you’d bring a sub fruit and yogurt.  Or muesli.”
“See you later, Tony.  Good luck with the armor.”
“Oh yeah? What’s it stand for?”
. Stark's consulting hours are from--”  Tony stopped short then blurted, “Holy shit you got Banner!”
Tony grabbed his wrench and went back to work.
When Steve’s fingers brushed lightly against Tony’s entrance, he moaned and struggled to tilt his hips. Still sucking, Steve looked up at him and did it again. (
“That’s very kind of you,” Steve said slowly. Tony shrugged.
“Pepper, honey, don’t,” Tony pleaded. “You’ve got this. You wanted to run a Fortune 500 Company? You did it. You wanna be a mom? You can do that too. With or without a partner.”
Tony felt helpless and fumbly. He started pacing, faster and faster. “Pepper, really. It’ll be okay. And so what if you aren’t partnered up? There are tons of awesome single parents out there! And, you know what? Lots of them work
“God, Tony? You want to drag God into your anus?” Jackie let out a startled laugh. “Oh wow, that went somewhere filthy fast.”
Things are really busy in my life right now with work so, although I'd like to be posting once a week, between my schedule and my beta's it will probably be more like every other week for the next little bit.  Don't worry!  I'll try not to leave you hanging for too long...
.”  Steve’s voice went rough.  “And I love you more than I ever could have imagined.  Love you more than I could have loved the mere idea of you.”
“My schedule is very open tomorrow,” Steve said, trying to sound confident.
“Everyone’s a little jumpy after the arachnoids,” Tony said.
Steve’s stomach lurched and his attention snapped back to the Avengers on the couch: Clint’s mouth was hanging open; Bruce was grinning at him; Thor looked wildly hopeful but uncertain; and Natasha’s lips had twitched up just slightly and was there perhaps a soft look in her eyes?
Thank you for reading!  I really hope you liked it and that--after the SO VERY LONG WAIT--it wasn't a let down.  (I had an unusually hard time getting back into the story after hiatus and reconnecting everything--Steve especially was giving me trouble.  And then I just *couldn't* get the tumblr images to align properly and was too fed up to keep working on it when I've got so much work and am moving across country.  Besides, better focus on the next chapter, right? :)
"Something is afoot in Manottan," Fury said.  "We need this treaty to go well.  Need them to be our allies; but we also need to know what's happening to keep one step ahead.  So, this isn't a job for a dewy eyed little O; we need someone with grit and brains.  A patriot.  Someone who wants to serve their country.  Only question is, is that person you?"
“Later,” Clint said, diving into his Cornflakes.
Of course, Tony was seldom lucky.
Tony had worried that after delivering Rogers’ latest rejection things might get awkward.
Tony felt too warm, heart beating a little too fast--unsure what to say.  Eventually, after a few long moments, he gathered himself enough to ask: “Did you request that?”
“Hey, Big Green,” Tony called again. “Here? Wanna hold the helmet?”
“I got you something, but if you already ordered different ones or it’s not right for--”
"You do, don't you?" Tony's breath was warm as he leaned closer. "You're not sorry at all, are you? You liked it. Loved it. Loved fucking me, hard and fast, filling me up with your cum--leaving me filthy and dripping with it."
“Oh, uh,” Steve said with a frown. “I’m not very good at this, but I was gonna wear a suit. But not the fancy one. Definitely not a tuxedo.”
"So *this* is our first date.”  Steve looked down at his pizza, then peeked up at Tony and added with a bashful smile, “This is my first date.”
They lapsed into a peaceful silence as Pepper drank her tea and absently rubbed Tony’s shoulders.
“We’re only recruiting one additional trustee at the moment,” Tony said. “But of course, if you’re not interested . . .”
“Trying to,” Tony said, not caring that his tone was pissy.
She turned back to the box.
Tony flipped hastily to the body armor specs.
“Hey, no, don’t,” Tony entreated. “You don’t have to go. Just, no ball now. Here. Come on.”
Steve didn’t look particularly reassured.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, resisting the urge to check email on his phone. “Tomorrow’s cool.”
They were silent in the elevator.  Steve wracked his brain for the right questions to ask about Tony, but they all sounded judgmental or prying and by the time he was halfway to something decent they’d arrived.
“Pretty fucked up first time, you know,” Tony said eventually.
Steve, still sitting on the couch, smiled. “Congratulations,” he said politely. “That’s a happy occasion.”
“Yeah, well,” Tony said, going for a wine glass.  (And
Tony hesitated for just a moment.
“No, what was it?”
“That wasn’t a Christmas present! It just made me think of you.”
Tony smiled, relieved. “We can go soon! I’ve got a project on tomorrow with Bruce, but soon. After all, the Met’s not going anywhere.”
“A light Montepulciano might be nice,” Tony suggested.
Curiosity was better than cruelty, sure, but that didn’t make it
This was gonna be
No luck.
“Mr. Stark? May I join you?”
“Okay, so, when you insist on opening the door, getting my chair, all that stuff,” Tony began, “they’re charged actions.  You’re marking me out to everybody there as a sub.”  Tony paused a moment, thinking.  Rogers leaned forward a little, but remained silent.  “Doing that stuff,” Tony continued, “reinforces the idea that there’s a fundamental difference between us; that we’re not equal.”
“Huh!?”
“Your call was bullshit,” Clint snapped.
“Yes!”  Another thrust and Steve rocked back to meet it.  Tony spread his fingers a little as he pulled back, then pressed in again curling his fingers to hit
, though” another part of Tony’s mind hissed.  17%!
“Actually, they’re a hybrid of the old TN LCDs and the new IPS models.”
(Finally!!!)
It had felt like lying, earlier.  (It was.)  It had felt like shame.  Like he was ashamed of Tony, of himself.  Of
Steve looked up at Tony with a brilliant smile.
. Who turns down a chance to watch
“Sure,” Steve said softly, handing Tony the rocking horse.
Tony bit his lip and nearly dropped his head to the side, which was
Clint shrugged.
“Aren’t you the one who used to tell me ‘don’t try to read a sub’s mind--when in doubt, just ask’? Tones. You know that stuff goes both ways.”
Steve looked over again as if to confirm Tony was still listening; Tony nodded and took a sip of his coffee. Steve smiled.
“Tony, I don’t understand how you could burn them!” Bruce cried in dismay. “I wasn’t even gone that long. And, wait? Are those scorch marks? Was it on
He’d taken two steps away when he thought he heard Tony’s faint reply.
Tony’s face twisted.  “Yeah well, you haven’t really been around much lately, have you?”  Hurt flashed across Pepper’s face and Tony’s guts clenched.
“Show me anyway?”
(Time to get some shit done!)  Tony ran his fingers through his wet hair.  (Fuck those assholes, anyway.)
It was delicious.
“I came up here to make a mid-morning snack, since I was feeling peckish. Would you like something?” Rogers asked. “I was thinking I’d make a couple of tea sandwiches.”
Rogers faltered.  “Um, yes?”  He didn’t seem so sure now and was fidgeting slightly under Tony’s unabashed stare.  Tony may be a good bit shorter than most Doms and certainly shorter than Rogers, but he knew how to stare down an arrogant alpha (even looking up at him).
Steve’s ears turned bright red as he hopped away from Tony; Tony was sure his cheeks were no better off.  Bruce was looking at pretty much anything but them.
“The Captain is on his way.”
“Hey, Steve.”
like Fury did.  He never dropped the full “Mister.”  (Tony’d been half waiting for him to give up on the formality, invitation or no, but he didn’t.  And that . . . that felt curiously like respect.)
Rogers shook his head with another disgusted noise and waved his hand angrily at the TV.  “All I know about that car is that it comes in red!  What kind of engine does it have?  How much horsepower?  Features?  Price?”  Rogers let out an exasperated sigh and changed the channel.
“Huh?”
Steve couldn’t seem to breathe.  His face was scalding. He nodded, cheek pressed against the sheets.
“You ready?” Clint called as soon as Tony stepped into the training room.
Iron Man laughed, but wisely said nothing.
“Are you ok?”
“Fuck!” Tony started typing frantically. “Why would it be doing this?”
“Just a minute!”
Tony gave a regretful smile and shook his head.
“Are you kidding?” Tony asked with a grin. “I hear you saved my life, but, seriously, if I can’t get out of here soon—or get on the fucking internet—I’m not so sure you did me any favors!”
(Huh?) Tony was glad that Steve wasn’t looking at him just then, since he was pretty sure his bewildered face wasn’t what Steve needed to see right then. (Is he afraid he’ll go into some sort of uncontrollable Dominant lust frenzy and take leave of his senses?) The idea was so silly—it was like something out of a nineteenth century novel. (Or rape culture—okay, that went someplace depressing fast.)
“I thought you’d like that,” Tony said, pressing his fully clad body up against Steve’s naked one.  “Port and chocolate.  Classic combination.”  Tony took another sip, then tipped the glass for Steve again before setting it aside.
“Hey, how about I give you both a hand, okay?”
You’re dreaming if you think that this special sub is a lousy slut like Stark. I wouldn’t blame Cap for banging that bitch, but if you think he’d tell people stark’s his darling special sub, you’re nuts.
“Later, love!”
“Good,” Steve said, a little falteringly.  “I just-- I’m honored that you knelt for me tonight.  In front of the team.  But you really didn’t have to.”
Veronica waited patiently, brown eyes warm, expression open.
Very carefully, Steve shifted Tony in his arms, little by little, moving Tony’s weight farther against his chest.  Steve slid his right arm down to the small of Tony’s back and used his left arm to pull Tony’s legs across his lap.  Tony murmured a little, but showed no signs of waking.  Steve felt torn between pleasure and concern.  On the one hand, he knew this was a sign of how deeply Tony trusted him and the rest of the team; on the other hand, it showed how exhausted he was and highlighted his constant willingness to work himself to the bone.  After waiting a few moments for Tony to settle, Steve cradled his lover against his chest, stood, and slowly turned his steps towards Tony’s bedroom.
“Ms. James,” Steve said and she immediately slumped.  “Uh, Veronica. I don’t— I mean, I really can’t.  I have--”  (
Tony blinked and stared for a moment before answering: “I can’t decide if you’re hopelessly naive or just stupid.”  Hurt flashed across Rogers face.
This might take longer than he’d been expecting.  Steve decided to do the easy part first.  He needed to put a note next to the first entry.  The stylus hovered over the glowing screen and Steve blushed.  He felt like a naughty schoolboy passing Tony a filthy note.  Or whispering dirty secrets in his ear, even though Tony wasn’t there to hear it and no sound was coming out.  After a moment’s hesitation, Steve clicked, dragged, and began to write next to ‘anal sex’:
“There’s left over pizza,” Bruce said. “Is that okay with you?”
Thai and
Then Rogers smiled. “Yes, of course. I’d be happy to bring you a cheeseburger, Mr. Stark.” Then Cap gave him a suspicious look. “You’re allowed to have rich food, right? It won’t hurt your recovery?”
(Oh!)
“I love them,” Tony said.
Steve followed Tony to the elevator. He rubbed the back of his neck.
“I hate my life.”
yet? We’ll get you some
Rogers looked confused.  “Well, yes.”
“Tony, it’s 1 pm.”
. Something sharp and unpleasant and suspiciously like jealousy. (But it couldn’t be jealousy, because that was ridiculous. There was nothing to be jealous over!)
JARVIS put Rogers’ notes on the wall.  The Captain still wasn’t typing—his chart was hand-drawn and handwritten with small, meticulous print.
“I’m so very relieved to hear it, Sir.”  Snarky, JARVIS. Snarky.
Steve let out a mirthless laugh. “Oh really? I suppose that’s why you made dozens of portal devices. And upgraded everyone’s armor.” He shook his head. “
“Lies, hideous lies!”  Tony gave him a performative glare.  “There’s no actual pact, is there?”
And earlier, Tony had sent him flowers!  Sure, it felt a little bit silly to be so elated by that, but . . . well, it was sweet.  Steve didn’t care what Tony said about clichés—it was romantic.  Roses were
Next he searched: white stargazer lilies flower language. (Probably something submissive or innocence or purity or--)
“Good morning, sir. It is 11:10 am on the first of January.”
And it was then Steve noticed—Tony’s watch didn’t just tell him what time it was; it also told him the date.  Steve couldn’t get any more words out, so he just nodded, feeling overwhelmingly grateful.
“Have you seen the balcony here?” Tony asked Belford. “The view is lovely and I could use some fresh air if you’d like to join me.”
“Let’s go!”
Pepper took a step closer and leaned forward, putting an arm around Tony’s waist as she examined his handiwork.
“Sorry,” Tony murmured and flipped off the comm.
Pepper let the silence linger.  Tony fidgeted, free to squirm and toy with his cuffs since it wasn’t a video call.
Thank you so much for joining me for Part II of “Permission to Surrender!”  (If you missed that story, I suggest going back and taking a look, since this second story probably won’t make much sense without it.  The summary is a flashback to that story...)  I’m so happy to be writing this and so very pleased and touched to hear that other people have been enjoying it too.  Thank you!
“So tandori actually is the name of the oven?” Steve asked. On the far side of the room Pepper and Natasha were talking quietly with their heads close together. Pep often seemed to gravitate towards Femme Dommes. At the moment, Pep’s pale cheeks were turning red, so maybe they were trading topping tips for ladies? (Okay, probably not, but it was a nice idea.) Tony turned his attention back to his tablet and let the sounds of his team and The Beatles wash over him. (Clint was adamant that The Beatles were Thanksgiving Eve music.)
“Mmm?”
Steve shook his head and pointed at the counter. “And sixty pounds of potatoes. And twenty pounds of butter.”
“We watch an awful lot of movies,” Bruce observed mildly as he started to help Steve clear up.
I love him.)  “—plans.  I’m sorry.”  She perked up a little.  (Shit, shit, shit!)  Steve added hastily, “And, regulations or no, I wouldn’t feel comfortable.”
Steve shrugged.  “Maybe.  We haven’t been called out as much lately, and, I mean, some free time is nice, I’m just not used to this much of it.  I’ve been drawing quite a bit, but that seems--” (-- selfish.)  “Maybe I could do more training for them, actually work with a class from start to finish.  There are plenty of things I still need to learn too.  I don’t know.  Just feels odd to be at loose ends so much when there are so many things I’d like to do and so many ways I could be helping.”
Tony turned his attention hastily back to the skyline. If he ignored him, maybe Cap’d leave.
.  By our, uh, conversation.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Looked like Steve had some fairly conflicting feelings about pain.  Tony tapped at the arc reactor pensively.   So, unsure about pain.  Fair enough.  They’d talk about it later.  And, oh, interesting—Steve had checked “curious” for “marks (bruising, scabs, etc.).”  (Yeah—definitely talking about that later.)
,” she said softly, not quite a statement, not quite a question. Tony gave a slow nod. She held out the scotch.
Steve’s ears were pink; Tony was pretty sure it wasn’t the cold.
“Yes!”
“Well,” she answered.  “And you?”
“Tony,” Steve said. “Do you have a minute?”
Steve took a seat in a pew about half-way to the main altar and looked up at the stained glass windows.  The vibrant blues always made him think of Tony’s arc reactor. Steve took a deep breath and let it out as a sigh of relief—he’d come to the right place.
His eyes flitted from one glowing screen to the next and back again.
They sat in silence for a few moments, holding hands.
Like I said, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, STEVE!"  :-)
Tony zoomed his vision to examine the portal’s opening, but Steve was already answering: “Not quite. I think they’re lowering a rope!”
“I’m sorry if it sounded like I doubted—“
Well there it is! I really hope you enjoyed it!!!
“Steve?” he called a little louder.
“Do we need to have another conversation about privacy and boundaries?”
Clint grunted as she scored a hard hit to his shoulder and bounded away.
“Yeah,” Rogers agreed amiably. “I may have heard that a few times.”
there is more you could have done, even while two of your teammates were still in physical therapy and the others were generating tech. Fine. But I seriously doubt beating yourself up is making you a more effective worker and if you’ve gone eighty hours without sleep, it looks to me more like some fucked up kinda Catholic penance than actually getting shit done!”
+++++++++++
Tony didn’t turn around until the doors had closed.
; Rogers crashed that plane . . . what, ten years before
“Sure! Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Hi,” Steve said, still smiling sweetly.
Steve nodded, nuzzling at Tony’s chest while Tony gathered his thoughts.  (Go on.  Say it.  Tell him.)  Still stroking Steve’s back, Tony frowned, his brows furrowed.   Steve couldn’t see that Tony was frowning, but he’d have recognized it as Tony’s “concentration face” even if he had.
When he woke up, she was gone.
Steve caressed the head, then eased it forward, imagining Tony’s voice rough and heavy in the air.
“Good luck!”
“Hey, JARVIS? Surprise us!”
“That sounds lovey!” Steve said, as he put a platter of bacon on the table. “I enjoyed the porridge you shared, when was it? Last week maybe? The one with—“
Tony jerked to a stop, looking startled.
The stranger was younger than Tony had initially supposed from a distance: his close-cropped hair all turned to silver, his dark skin wrinkled and creased, but he had a robust build, broad shoulders, and impeccable posture. His eyebrows shot up in surprise when he saw Tony approaching. The surprise annoyed Tony.
“Yeah,” Bruce said with a rueful smile.  “I was hoping he was wrong too.”
“Please,” Tony whispered, eyes downcast, “give me an order. How do you want me?”
“Bruce has some tests on a chemical compound running up in his lab,” Tony said.  “I’ll ask him what time they’ll be done; we’ll be free after that. Not sure about Steve’s or Natasha’s schedules.”
“Is that one coming through the portal?” Clint asked.
“Right,” Tony said dubiously.
“Good fight, Iron Man,” Rogers said seriously.  Only Captain America could seem dignified in a spangly outfit like that.
Now Steve wasn’t so sure.
“I worry about you,” she said softly.
“Hmmm?”
Tony’s call with Isaac and his team went well; it had been a good quarter for the Foundations’ investments.  The dividends would be enough to fund the renovations needed at The Submissives’ Safehouse.
That was all he could remember now. (Another thing lost.)
“And now . . .  I just . . .”  Steve shrugged again.  “I guess it feels a little weird reading about this, about how other people have
Tony shrugged and pressed his face closer into her thigh, feeling loose and unconcerned by it all.  The praise made him blush, but it was just Pepper so he didn’t mind.
“Yeah,” Clint chimed in. “It’s a classic, Steve. Seriously.”
They waited in companionable silence for the kettle to boil.  Then once the tea was steeping, Bruce asked, “Would you like my advice?”
“Of course you could,” she agreed, “but then I wouldn’t get to ask if you’ve bothered to look at the year end report yet.”
Once he’d calmed down a bit, Tony shook his head and said, “If that’s what you thought, you really don’t know Steve at all.”
?” Clint demanded.
“Let’s hope that won’t be necessary,” Steve said with a little smile.  He nodded politely to the band leader as they passed; he nodded back and smiled at Steve.
“Not that I’m competitive or anything!” Rhodey added. “If Pepper and I did have some sort of weird friend rivalry—which we don’t—I’d obviously be winning, as the one who has known you for, like, a decade longer.”
(Yeah,
“I think it’s a wonderful idea, however you set it up.”  Steve grinned. “I love that you’re so generous that your gift to me is really a gift to the city.”
Tony fluttered his eyelashes and bobbed demurely, answering with a fake southern accent: “Oh, it is
“Very well, sir,” JARVIS said. “Might I remind you that such reservations are notoriously hard to get?”
Steve nodded and looked at Tony’s crotch with new concentration.  He palmed Tony’s balls assertively, a little too hard for a moment, before easing up.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
. . . in and out . . .
“If I snatch a piece of bacon from the skillet, will you rap my knuckles with your spatula?” Tony asked impishly.
“I had a suspicion you might be, Sir.”
“Excuse me, Mr. Stark? May I please come in?”
Tony pulled back just enough to offer his mouth to Steve for a kiss, a little surprised when Steve kissed him rough and deep and demanding. (He didn’t mind.)  Tony’s blood rushed as Steve pressed him up against the refrigerator, his mouth never leaving Tony’s, their kiss all tongues and teeth and possession. Tony could feel Steve’s cock, huge and thick against his hip as they kissed. (Christ, Steve was hard already. Magic serum?) Tony nearly laughed at himself. (Or, ya know, just the fact Steve’s only—what? Twenty-five? Twenty-six? Jesus.) Steve clutched at Tony’s wrists; Tony moaned and shamelessly pressed up against Steve’s hard-on.
Steve was still frowning, brow knit with worry.  He stepped out of Tony’s arms.
Clearly, this called for drastic measures.
Tony’s jaw tightened.  “That’s big of you,” Tony said sharply.
“Uh,” Steve fidgeted.
“Well,” Steve said, looking surprised, “that’s good. Pepper, can I get you anything?”
Pepper waited a moment before giving Tony a little smile and prompting, “So, who is she?  Do I know her?”
He took a long deep breath.
“I’m not so sure there’s a difference.”
Tony couldn’t bear to look at him. (What if he’d read it wrong? What if--) Tony kept his gaze fixed on the skyline.
“Okay, brat, you’re on,” Clint said with a grin.  “Where did we leave off last time?  Getting out of a Thompson Hold?”
“Okay, Eewoo,” Tony said. “Prepare for lift off!”
Sulu and Chekov were restored to the Enterprise and Kirk gave Uhura a solemn “well done,” with a sizable undercurrent of unspoken “sorry I was a dick, thanks for saving the day.” Uhura was gracious about the whole thing, but shared this
Steve felt a surge of grateful affection for the little church.
He struggled to drag his eyes open, then winced and screwed them shut as the light seared his retinas and made his head pound.
“Okay. That’s good.” Tony sliced the sandwiches in half and arranged them on a plate. Then rearranged them again. Then put them back the way they were before. “I’m glad.”

Next box:  “Begging.”  Steve turned it over in his mind.  (“Fuck me . . . I want you inside me.  I want you to come inside me.  Please, fuck me. . . . I want it. . .  Please . . .”)  Yes, he’d loved that.  Once he’d gotten started, the words just came pouring out so easily and though they hadn’t gotten Steve what he wanted (or, at least, not exactly what he’d had in mind), the look on Tony’s face--!  Steve closed his eyes, picturing Tony again.  Then made the imaginary Tony give him a different look, stern but with affection in his eyes.  And Steve imagined him growling, “Beg for it, Steve.  Tell me how bad you want me, baby.  And if your begging’s good enough, maybe I’ll let you have it . . .”
Pepper rolled her eyes.  “Once Tony!
Tony grabbed his tablet, pulled up the DOD mainframe, and within seven minutes heard Rhodey bark out: “This is Lieutenant-Colonel Rhodes. Who’s calling and how did you get this number?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mmm-hmm,” Belford murmured. He ran his hand across Tony’s shoulder, then down is arm. “You’re the most interesting person here. And easily the most beautiful.” Tony let Belford pull him in a little closer. Tony gave a little shiver and his heart picked up its pace.
(See the end of the chapter for
to your sub.”
and Tony cried out, seeing stars.
“Why not?” Tony asked quietly, and this time the tone came out right: open, curious, patient.
**This really was the name of a 1940s motorcycle!   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Dominator
“I just—“ Steve looked over at Tony, his eyes red-rimmed and his voice rough, “I just miss him so damn much, you know?”
(Warm. Wonderfully warm.)
“Certainly, sir.”
“Yeah. That—“ Bruce smiled. “That sounds good.”
Tony frowned.
“Are you awake?” Steve asked breathlessly, a little louder.
“What do you mean by that?”
Steve smiled and said, a bit shyly, “I’m so glad.”
Steve sighed. “I told Nat how much I’ve been dreading the next gala. She thinks I’d be more comfortable at big events if I had somebody ‘modern’ at my side to help me navigate. And to discourage, um . . .
Tony nodded.
So, even with a safeword, Tony still had to keep a close eye on him since, apparently, “submissives sometimes forget their safewords” or “a submissive sometimes becomes so accepting of the dominant’s wishes or so ‘endorphined-out’ by the session that calling their safeword will not occur to them . . . in such a case, an unperceptive dominant could unknowingly cause severe damage . . .” (53).
Tony wrinkled his nose and set down the rest of his sandwich. “I make it a habit never to read drivel and am frankly surprised to find that you do.”
“Good.” Rhodey sounded satisfied.
"Revenge for your alpha?"
Tony took a considering sip of coffee, then headed for the elevator.
Tony gave him a blank look.
The coffee was still steaming, resting on one of those cheesy little keep-warm devices for individual mugs. The coffee smelled a little burnt, but rich and strong.
“Captain Rogers is in excellent health,” JARVIS answered. And, yeah, that wasn’t at all ominous.
“What now?” she asked.
(Yeah.  He’d always liked Johnny.)
“Is that it?”
It was Burce.
, Black Widow and I have been training in the gym you designed.  It’s been wonderful, but I think it’s high time to get us all together in one place to train and talk about what we bring to the team.”
asking.)
Tony gave a laugh that was almost giddy with relief.
Steve leaned down for a kiss then took Tony’s other wrist and wrapped it carefully, meticulously with the soft thick rope.
And, shit, now Tony actually felt sorry for the guy.
(Fucking gorgeous.)  Tony paused.
“Steve Rogers,” Tony said, voice soft and vehement, “has more respect and decency in his pinky than all your fucking agents combined.”
Steve shrugged into his own coat and held the door open, then hailed them a cab. As he held that door for Tony too, Tony realized he’d really never done
Okay, not those exact words.
As Clint and Steve fell to teasing each other and putting away the dozens—(okay,
The ninjas were sitting on his vast leather couch, heads close together. Romanov was holding a glass of wine, Barton a beer.  Bruce was in the kitchen, stirring a huge pot with a thick wooden spoon, then bending down to check something in the oven.  Tony’s dinning room table, which he was pretty sure he’d
She nodded.
“Oh right.” Bruce gave a sheepish smile. “Sorry, Tony. I lost track of time.”
“Oh,” Tony said, trying not to droop with disappointment. “Do you?”
Bruce nodded, reaching for another unlabeled jar of red-orange spices. The whole kitchen smelled like-- well, Steve didn't really know what it smelled like. Curry of some sort. A year ago he'd have thought it smelled “foreign,” now it just smelled like “Bruce” and “home” or possibly “Thursdays.”
“You know, Sam usually can’t drag me to these stuffy parties,” Rebecca said, “but I’m very glad we made it out this time.  It’s been such a pleasure getting to know you, Steve.”
When Tony reached into one of the bags, rooting around for a spring roll, though, it drew a cry of protest.
or now?”, but Tony swallowed the words down unsaid--looking at Rogers’ expression, he was pretty sure he knew the answer. He could imagine Rogers’ sketches with surprising vividness: a street in Brooklyn, teaming with long skirts and sharp fedoras; wrought iron streetlights and boxy-looking trolley cars; Peggy Carter and The Howling Commandoes.
Just when Tony was about to pull away—because, unwanted physical contact is
“Hey, Pep?” Tony said, pouring them each a generous scotch. “What’s going on with What’s-His-Face? That guy.”
Time to kill some time.
“Shit!  Sorry.  Uh,” Tony gestured a bit sheepishly at the projections.  “I fine tuned the repulsors so they operate on a scale using—”  (Seriously, he doesn’t want details!)  “Er, I created the equivalent of ‘phasers on stun.’”  Tony smirked.  “Just think!  Now you can tell me to go in ‘phasers on stun,’ like that other Captain you’re so inexplicably fond of.”
“Yeah. Sure,” Bruce bit his lip. “Just, I—are you really sure about the Security Blanket? I thought—“
“Please say you were cool,” Tony repeated.
Tony really would have to talk to Pepper about “reallocating” some of SI’s “talent,” because this shit was unacceptable.  What the fuck?  Somebody had even fucked up the orders for the magna-plastic covers!  Or the manufacturing had gone to seed.  They shouldn’t be cracking!  Tony fumbled for a screwdriver.
“Really, I’m sorry,” Steve was saying, then added with an uneasy laugh. “I, just, I’ve never—and I’m so worried I’ll disappoint you or worse I’ll hurt you or something and--.” He let out a miserable sigh. “I’m supposed to know what I’m doing, but . . .” he shrugged.
Pepper smiled.
Tony grinned.  “So it was your love for me that drove you into harm’s way?”
Steve looked at him wide-eyed as Tony rushed on, “Oh, and I maybe gave some money to Magdalene House again. Because that’s always good, right? And we could go on a trip somewhere! Paris? The Bahamas? Really whatever you want. Normally, I’d just buy a Dom some expensive trinket--sort of like the ‘proof I dated Tony Stark’ luxury watch-- but I didn’t think that you’d actually
And then Steve found himself fumbling around in his mind for another avenue of conversation and failing utterly.  For all the times he’d come into the common areas hoping his team would be there, he hadn’t done much thinking about what he’d say to them if they were.  He felt like an awkward little shrimp standing on the sidelines again, tongue-tied and embarrassed.
“Hang on!” Tony called, fumbling for his hoodie. Industrial shears, patterns, and poly-aramid fabric were in organized chaos across the workbench.
“I called her,” Pepper answered softly. Tony nodded. He steeled himself and turned back to her.
Tony leapt out of his chair and raised his left index finger to his lips while waving frantically with his right hand. Bruce looked at him like he’d gone insane. Tony gestured to his lab couch.
“Good. Great!” Tony said, then remembered to ask, “Wait! Casual or dressy?”
His tablet was on the coffee table. Maybe, if he moved very veeery slowly, he could grab it without waking Steve?
(And damn it, he just kinda . . . missed Steve?)
Rogers let out a rueful little laugh and shook his head.  “Mr. Stark, I already woke up in a world like a science fiction novel.” He shrugged. “Doubt much can surprise me now.”
“It’ll be poker,” Natasha said with great conviction.  Tony nodded, acknowledging defeat, and went to help Steve with the dishes now piled in the sink.
The eggs in the skillet hissed and Steve turned hastily back to the stove, saying over his shoulder, “I’m making eggs, but can fix you something else. And there’s coffee in the pot. I’m guessing you’d like some.”
“Oh no! No, I couldn’t possibly—“
Tony blinked.
Bruce poured his own cup and smiled at Steve.  “I don’t think it matters where you go, as long as you go together.  So just pick a place you’re comfortable with and don’t worry about it.  He’ll love it if he’s with you.  Ah,” Bruce gave him an embarrassed little smile, and an awkward pat on his hand.  “Well, that’s what I think.”
“Of course.”
(It was a Classic pose for a reason.)
“I like to vary my schedule,” Natasha answered with a smirk. “Routines can be dangerous—they make a person predictable.”
“Steve?  Will you kneel on the floor for me, sweetheart?”
Tony moaned and tried to writhe back on Steve’s cock.
Tony swallowed thickly.
God damn it.  Tony
There wasn’t enough air; Tony’s chest was tight.
“Are you sure--”
Natasha arched one eyebrow at him; he hated it when she did that.
Tony snorted. He had a pretty good idea why the man had called.
If they talked about the important stuff and Rogers disappointed him, if he turned out to be as big an orientationist asshole as Tony sometimes feared, then Tony couldn’t just cut him out.  Rogers would still be there: in his Tower, his commanding officer, his Captain.
(Shit.)
Things are rough for me in RL right now, so if you want to take a moment to tell me your favorite bit (or two or three...) it will be even more extra majorly appreciated than usual--and it usually makes my  day to begin with.  [If you want, you can read about RL here: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/118061232911/sad-news-in-merediths-life]  Thanks to everyone who has sent kind words and support.
“Well,” Natasha said. “This is unexpected.”
“I, uh—” Steve fidgeted a little. “Sorry about bursting in like that. I didn’t know you were planning a visit. Or had been injured.” Steve shot Tony a reproachful look.
The man hesitated.
“I’m not gonna push,” Rhodey said, still frowning. “But I’m not stupid, Tony. I know
Tony knew a losing battle when he saw one, but that didn’t mean he had to cave gracefully. He glared back.
It was a relief.
Steve smiled. “That too.”
“Wait,” Tony frowned.
“Mr. Stark, thank you for having me,” Rogers said warmly.
Clint shot down another robot and grumbled, “We should just spar with each other for a real challenge.”
“Of course, you’re right, Pep.”  Tony said eventually, but without conviction. “You always are.”
Steve was frowning as he went off to find Natasha.
(Oh shit!)
Push, pull, push, pull, push—(Shit, shit, careful, don’t choke him!) Tony tightened his fingers in Steve’s hair, then let go.

(Didn’t know Steve played chess.)
“But that’s just it,” Bruce continued, playing with his glasses absently.  “Not only can Tony buy dinner at any restaurant in town, he could buy the restaurant.  He may like the food some places more than others, but he doesn’t really care about that kind of thing.”
“For you? Always,” he said, but his smile dimmed a little at the look on Tony’s face.
Tony gasped again and with a jolt Steve finally recognized those noises: Tony was touching himself.  Tony was stroking his cock while looking at Steve prostrate at his feet.  Steve shivered.
“Good.”  His voice sounded a little thick. “I want that too.  And I have a few ideas.  But first, have you picked a safeword yet?”
Steve kept his arm around Tony as they walked from the elevator to Tony’s bedroom door, where Steve paused and took a step back.  Tony glanced up and found Steve biting his lip. For the first time all evening, he looked like he wasn’t on solid ground.
He froze.  Pepper Potts, dressed in an immaculate gray suit, was standing at the entrance of Tony’s gigantic walk-in closet with two shirts and ties over her arm.
The meeting was boring, like most meetings.  It was really just a check in.  Rogers updated Hill and Fury on what the team had been doing.  Strategies they’d developed, techniques.  Told them about the training modules Tony’d made, at which point Fury got a speculative gleam in his eye, which Tony ignored.  (No way he was making that stuff for SHIELD.)  The ninjas talked about scheduling fieldwork for SHIELD and balancing it with Avengers’ training. Bruce scowled-- he looked even angrier about being there than Tony, which was impressive.  Fury called Tony “Stark”; Rogers called him “Iron Man.” Tony brooded.  Rogers made a few attempts to draw him into the discussion, but everybody else was doing a fine job recounting a bunch of boring facts that could have gone in a memo; Tony felt no need to prolong things.  (Seriously?  They made me come here for this?)

“I am at liberty to confirm Sir’s suspicion.”
“The Captain is in his suite.”
“You really don’t want to tell me what to do,” Bruce said, breathing a little more heavily than before, but each breath steady and regular.
