"Leave that to me dear. I doubt anything short of a serial killer could get him out of the building but my gingernuts fresh and hot from the oven WILL get him out of the flat."
"And here we go! Oh woe is me says the big comfy bed with the clean sheets and posh duvet. Care to guess where the filthy ones end up? Right here in me!", the hamper slammed its lid petulantly.
Cheeks flaming, Sherlock stammered "Well...ah...then...tell me you've found something not boring."
"Course, that's my job innit? But the crisis is over and you'll soon be well."
Sherlock squeaks as he is firmly squeezed. "You're being incorrigible, Doctor."
The sculpture is a large toad covered in warts. Its mouth is open in surprise as streams of rainbow coloured water pour forth from it into the pond. The toad's eyes are filled with a stoney fury and on its head rests a moss encrusted crown.
"16th August, Tell A Joke Day."
"More than you know, 'Lock, more than you know."
21st October-
"Fuck me, love sick sex toys? Nauseating!" huffed the bed.
"But you DO! Best remember that, he's home."
Waking early, Sherlock was determined not to appear interested in their new flatmate. He found the elf no longer on the mantle but wrapped around the base of his microscope along side of which was a small box containing slides of various ash samples, blood smears and bacteria. Tamping down his excitement he only barked out, "John, tea!"
"Well, let's just say Sherlock and I are having similar bouts of confusion like you."
The landlady, not your housekeeper, amateur photographer sends her best wishes to notjustmom for a very Happy Birthday nonetheless.
"Says the infamous 'William Sigerson' and, on a particularly memorable occasion, 'Captain Basil'."
"Speaking of front row seats...", the toilet flushed.
Looking far more like a housekeeper than fairy godmother, Martha gave him a knowing glance and smiled. "Well done you. Are you just stopping by to chat or do you want something, dear?"
"I've noticed he's having memory troubles too", Martha added, "and I've never known him to sleep like he is. Hours at a time and twice almost an entire day."
"Well the 30th is a Bank Holiday."
"No, black and red actually but as I said it might produce an impressive bang."
Following his line of sight, John was heartsick to see what remained of Billy the skull, shattered by a hammer blow, strewn across the rug. "Oh Sherlock I'm...here, let me..."
Mustering all his strength John held on to the wing, pressed the Arclight to Wesix's chest and began the spell as he silently prayed "Dear God don't let me make a mistake."
Feeling guilt in every bone, John sent up a prayer that the British Government's timing was impeccable as always. Thankfully before he could respond, a loud persistent horn sounded repeatedly from the street below.
"Do keep up, John. It's August!"
"Yes, matter of fact, shows that I'm not entirely ignorant. I can even get to twenty if I take my shoes off. So, here's the thing, I've been working on the blog trying to finish the case..."
"With fish."
Sniffing dismissively the bed was about to argue when the bedside table began to rock back and forth.
"25th August, Kiss And Make Up Day."
"I will defend Sherlock against all harm, and I pledge him my heart."
"Undoubtedly."
"Yay me."
"What WAS the case?"
Sherlock huffed, "Right? Did I get what right? Make sense John."
John was drunk off his arse. The last time he'd been this pissed was on leave in Dubai from Afghanistan shortly before he was shot. What few hazy memories he had of those nights were good, tonight decidedly was not. Far from being raucous young soldiers out to carouse and get a leg over night, this was one lonely man trying to drown his misery in far too many pints and shots.
"Hardly Hudders, and I didn't summon you."
"A stranger has invaded the tower, Mistress. He feigned your voice, spoke the magic words and climbed the scarf. As I departed, they were disrobing and I fear mischief is afoot."
"You heard me. Listen, I know we haven't known each other all that long but I know that I have feelings for you and I have a hunch you have feelings for me although you'd probably rather hug Mycroft than admit it. Hell! I don't understand exactly what's going on between us but something is and I want to be able to explore it. Sherlock, look at me. If you had taken that pill you WOULD be dead. We've only just found one another. Please don't make me lose you before whatever this is has a chance."
He's already precariously over balanced and the demanding almost frantic shout sends John sliding off the edge of the chair onto the floor square on his arse. More alarmingly, a second wail pitched just below a level only heard by small animals and babies follows the first. Ignoring his throbbing tailbone, John scrambles to his feet making a beeline for his husband reaching for the Sig that, unsurprisingly, isn't in his bathrobe. Stumbling on the door jamb he falls into the bedroom to find Sherlock sprawled on the bed looking quite bothered.
John's first thought was he looked like death warmed over. Why hadn't he noticed before? "Sherlock you all right?"
It was insane John knew, but Sherlock was wasting away right in front of his eyes and John was now convinced he had seen something not of this mortal world. Sherlock was in terrible danger and it was time to get help. Time to call Mycroft.

The rest of the journey passed in silence with the backseat companions having energetic eye sex. Mycroft only looked in the rear view mirror once, a mistake he did NOT repeat.
To tell of gay Sherlock and bi John
Mary had said the words differently. Mary had been all smiles, lips clinging to vowels. She was confident, as though she knew the feeling was mutual. Perhaps she did;
He had a distinct dominance over John, established the first day they met, promising sickly sweet caresses with one hand whilst the other curled tight around his neck as though he had begged on his knees for it. It was slapping his face as though every cell beneath the skin directly linked through tangled ties to the strings of his heart, but praising him with enough sincerity to evoke him to forgive, soothing touches dancing down his neck as hair was tugged by fisted fingers, holding him tightly enough to bruise ribs. It was kisses tasting of blood, shared air containing shattered glass. Sherlock had power and, as much as John fought against it, he found himself pliant under his command.
He’d learnt to reason against his better judgement in Afghanistan, in that tiny, compact medical tent where soldiers earned scars instead of medals. It was odd: he’d lost count of the number of men he’d still sought to save well after other doctors gave in; the amount of wounds he compressed with his bare hands; the number of nights he woke up in a cold sweat with the blood still staining his palms. John felt sick thinking about it, even now, even several years later - but he’d come face to face with death, could pinpoint hell’s coordinates on a map, and he’d watched both breath and light leave the corpse of a man he’d been joking with moments prior; they still echoed, ever present, in his nightmares.
Mary was holding his hand, her ghostly pale fingers clutching his palm without applying any pressure. John looked down, perplexed, flexing and unflexing against her long fingers and manicured nails, vaguely aware of the lump crawling up his throat.
Still, John found Sherlock was remaining quiet, unnervingly so, particularly for a man of his vernacular. Each moment, pronounced by the incessant ticking of the wall clock, punctured into his chest, and John’s leg was aching. It was a bruising, constant ache that left his upper thigh throbbing, knee practically
“I know,” there was that trepidation again, that fear inching its way back behind a stoic mask.
And he was scared, like a deer in headlights, and far too in the moment to depersonalise, and far too tangled in his own mind to force the words out of his throat.
John was good at that: at ignoring; came as naturally to him as breathing. As naturally as not meeting his own withered eyes in the mirror. As naturally as lying.
John straightened his posture,
, and yet the way their skin moulded into place came as naturally as pumping blood, with well-embedded instructions, following commands to sink into the grooves of the body.
The silence that followed was confirmation.
They were falling, falling,
It was quiet, impossibly quiet, and yet the room had never seemed louder.
, faster and faster, and John could feel the air smacking at his body, telling him to stay awake, to stay with it. And the voice was Mary’s. And the voice was Sherlock’s.
And John found his eyes had closed of their own accord, too cowardly to face Sherlock’s shrinking irises, afraid of what he’d find there instead. Their breath shuddered along with them.
John saw fear in his friend's eyes.
John was hit with enough passion to fill a crater in the moon; the urge to hold his friend was all-powerful and all-encompassing and overwhelmingly overwhelming. Holding wasn't enough. He didn't want to hold, to
It didn’t make sense, John’s thoughts were knitted into some sort of woolly edged conclusion that
Sherlock was hesitant, unwilling, to reply, as though John would physically have to tempt an answer out of him. He was prepared; he’d learnt the divinity of patience when affronted with any member of the Holmes family, to cherish the rare moments of easy compliance.
John fought off an eye-roll at the analytical accuracy, as though this was the only information that mattered to Sherlock, as though the date was seared into his bones in the same way the bullet wound was John’s, but it soon sunk in. His senses were flooded, inundated with data detailing Sherlock’s tone, body language, phrasing - every way he knew how to read a person, every way Sherlock didn’t.
Sherlock should have seen, by now, should have attributed each feeling with the scars fading on John’s body, with the moles trailing up his arms. Sherlock Holmes was a genius; surely he’d have seen, have known.
, when he, himself, wasn’t entirely sure. Mrs Hudson, Angelo, even Jim Moriarty, for God's-sake - how had they managed to deduce from a glance what he had yet to come to terms with after several years of internal conflict? It didn't make sense, not to John, yet, to others, it was as clear as differentiating the day and night, his emotions layered onto his aging complexion like a second skin - perhaps he’d seen this in his reflection, all the indications of a lovesick puppy, and learnt to ignore it.
The ringing was growing louder, closer, screaming into John’s ears like his former military leader, barking unheard commands that seemed to resonate deep in his being, deep in his psyche.
Sherlock rarely lied, rarely saw a point; lying was, ‘
Sherlock’s lips were parted, as though answering in a silent sigh. He could feel it in the air, the desperate plea;
The words were soft, hesitant, scanning the room in desperate search of purchase. His voice was barely above a whisper, the confession escaping as a hushed, monotonous hum. They sunk into the dark interior of the office, tightening the air around them, clutching to the noose around his neck and pulling ever so slightly.
to push him, had to hold him out at the end of the waterfall until he spilt, perhaps more for John’s sanity than anything because, around Sherlock, Watson swore he was going mad.
And as John stood there, with Mary prompting and Mycroft trusting, he felt his resolve fall.
“I’ve got you,” he found himself promising vaguely, closing his eyes and swearing an oath to every God he didn’t believe in that
The world stopped spinning.
The weight of his next action forced his shoulders to hunch, his hands to quiver beneath the overwhelming expectancy from those around him. He didn’t want to say, to admit, to believe. The words weren’t ready, weren’t formulated in his lungs yet - still growing and blooming like rose buds.
“John.”
He wanted this more than he wanted air in his throat and blood in his heart.
, he thought quietly, contently,
“Since 12:37 am on the 30th of January, 2010.”
How was it, John wondered, that everyone else seemed to
His mind was performing pirouettes in a long deserted ballet studio, with windows smashed in and light switch ripped from the wall; a room covered with earth that smelt and felt and
By now, his leg was screaming, burning under his weight, threatening to give way. John fought to stay upright, forced himself to focus on the way Sherlock’s unruly hair curled at the nape of his neck, how his suit, which was easily worth more than double John’s monthly wages, was marked with mud on his lower left back. It was from the case. John was tired.
There was a beat, a moment or two of silence where everything seemed feasible and realistic. A moment where John looked into the mirror and saw the bags under his eyes, and the split in his lips, and the bruise forming just below his eyebrow. And the dilution of his pupils that he should blame on the lighting
Just existing for the sake of existing, and everything was just
“Ready to go solve a crime?”
Sherlock finally looked up, not quite at John’s cloudy reflection - at some point just north of his head; his expression contorted in a matter of seconds from perplexed, to indignant, settling on feigned placidity. John simply watched, baffled at the man’s curious emotions, rising and falling like waves. Watson found he was far out of his depths, treading water as the riptide grew stronger, stronger, stronger still; he was holding them both afloat, with Sherlock’s pliant frame forcing them to collectively struggle for air, as though they were sharing a single set of lungs.
always
. He would never have that with Sherlock, never grow to see simplicities bore him; everything would always be fast to faster, always one thrill to the next. Hell, it already was like that; they were drowning themselves in cases after cases after cases
“We met on the 29th?” It was a question; why was it a question?
. But John stood his ground - if they didn't get it out there now, they would never build up the guts to start this conversation over; it was now or never, now or nothing.
“I love you.”
Sherlock’s back was turned, bitten down nails and inky fingers clenching and unclenching against his scarred palms. His breathing had surpassed regulated, chest rising and falling unnaturally fast. He was scared - John didn’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out. Sherlock was scared. John was quiet.
But there he stood, back turned, posture working hard to feign nonchalance, unsure. Uncertainty danced on his pale features like a ballerina, tiptoeing around the faint freckles and accentuating pirouettes in the darkness beneath his eyes; he wasn't used to not knowing, to not trusting.
I, pray tell?"
Sherlock realises. He could use the excuse of needing to ask when the stitches could come out to pop down to the clinic. Perhaps John could be enticed with lunch to give Sherlock five minutes on his appointment room’s PC? Perhaps even ten minutes? Half an hour? He recalls John should be at work today. Perhaps he should have spared the castle for a picnic with his neighbour? Normally, Sherlock would never want company for a visit to a museum or to a historical site because people never tend to need as much time to examine every interesting exhibit that he does. Having to compromise with their preferences would be irritating, especially if some nuisance of a companion distracted him by trying to talk to him. But surely John wouldn’t be so bad? He’s already demonstrated himself to be capable of polite silence. Sherlock wonders if John might know more about the castle than the scarce plaques scattered about had told him during his visit.
How should he navigate these waters of curiosity, disappointment, attraction and déjà vu. For a moment, before John had spoken, a giddy sort of anticipation —
I'm not keeping this one from him rather than keeping it for myself. As long as he doesn't know, it exists only in my head.
"You said that the helicobacteria test was negative. What caused an ulcer, then? Did they comment on that?" To John's knowledge, Sherlock hasn't suffered from acid reflux or had an ulcer before.
"Cavendish Square Gardens?" The small green space won't give them a long promenade, but it's the closest park she can think of.
"They're not challenging, no. Especially not oligodendrogliomas of this grade. Very good margins; I could just push away the edge of the tumour from healthy tissue."
, John thinks, crushes his disposable cup and throws it into the bin.
"And give him my love," Violet adds.
Sherlock decides to sip his awaiting shot as slowly as he can to discourage John from going overboard.
Sherlock blinks, shifting his gaze from the not very precipitous-looking clouds in the sky to John. "Excuse me?"

"Okay."
They will stay at a hotel, take part in things arranged by Sandhurst; no need for Edgar's assistance. Sherlock had given him the weekend off consequently from Thursday onwards, and the man had positively beamed at the news. He had explained to Sherlock that a long weekend would mean that he could spend some time in Paris, even attend a catwalk show of his favourite designer for the Spring fashion week. A friend from his time at Balenciaga had offered him a ticket, but he hadn't wanted to presume he could get time off. "Go. Enjoy yourself. We certainly will," Sherlock had told his PA.
"It can't cause harm to your relationship now, Sherlock, if you acknowledge that you felt unsafe emotionally during that time. It's just a statement of facts. You have the right to those emotions even if you forgive and accept John's reasons for behaving that way."

"I've been working on a Prokofiev sonata that's––"
John nods, looking oddly stoic.
"Yet you elected
"I bet he's looking forward to that," John jokes. "Um… I can't come and pick him up since I can't drive with my pain meds."
He finally opens the door and enters the foyer — mostly just to shield himself from the biting wind.
"Well, people shouldn't be expected to cater to my oddities," Sherlock scoffs. "That just adds insult to injury when it comes to the burden you have to bear."
"Just don't think it should be any easier than it is. That there's some measure of how to cope, how to behave, when to start dragging yourself back to some sort of a life. Don't push people away, though. That's not good. Let them look after you."

Sherlock had explained, stroking an idle finger up John's bicep. "
"I'm not sure I entirely agree with that. Witnessing different emotional reactions and especially seeing others receive the emotional support they need when they are suffering can be an important part of developing a child's sense of basic emotional security."
"For a second or two. Anyone might have a pause that long after even just an extra beat when they're asleep."
Instead, she is now telling him… what? That he shouldn't give up? That he's done well?
Ten minutes after he fires off the email, he gets an SMS from Lestrade.
"I'm sure he'll be fine in a cab, or perhaps getting a bit of fresh air while walking home might be a good idea."
Just after he has extracted the tissue sample, the door opens and John walks in wearing scrubs, a mask and a hat. Sherlock frowns.
"I believe that's called following," Sherlock says with a smirk.
"Most likely, yes."
Sherlock snorts. "The gym being closed means that we'll have to come up with some alternate exercise until then. Kiss me again," he demands, having now slipped into his uniform jacket.
where you live. You do like working with me. Perhaps we could do both as flatmates."
' is what they told him in rehab. “Dust,” he suggests, jutting up his chin and facing down Wiggins.
"Wanting to spare someone we life from hardship is not a deplorable thought, John. Sherlock's mother sought to protect him just and what you just voiced comes from that same need. But mollycoddling him, taking away what he loves the most because it's difficult and often stretches his reserves to the extreme is not the way. He needs to be the one to define his limits."
“For the love of–––” Lestrade curses. “Could you escort Mr and Mrs Hall out?” he barks to one of the officers idling at the scene. “Why do you say that?” he demands from Sherlock.
John's hand is a bit clammy but warm. Sherlock gives it a squeeze before slipping his fingers between John's.
"After what?" John holds the door open and Sherlock ducks under his arm into the house.
John had spent the drive in trying to pick the right words and rehearse them in his head. Truth be told, he'd been trying to decide what to say all night, tossing and turning restlessly in bed. He had agonised over this decision over the breakfast Sherlock never consumed, cursed his indecisiveness even when they walked from the parking garage to the lockers and he couldn't help thinking that Sherlock looked like a man being escorted to the gallows. Protectiveness had surged in John like a flush of adrenaline the second he'd seen Sherlock's haunted, crestfallen expression this morning, and that feeling hasn't yet dissipated. After all, it had propelled John's steps from the locker room to this spot on the linoleum outside Greg's office.
To the orthopaedists/hand surgeons in the audience: if you die laughing at these most wonky medical details, I promise to deliver cardiopulmonary resuscitation. And working in public healthcare, I won't charge even you a single penny for it.
As a personal favour Mike had volunteered, he's handling Sherlock's case though he's usually at the outpatient clinic or consults for the A&E department instead of handling things at the ward.
"That has been taken into account," you point out, wanting to establish that not everyone in this hospital is the idiot Sherlock assumes. The bolus doses he is being given of oxycodone and morphine would knock a smaller woman without a history of opioid use out cold.
He is surprised when Angus drives them no further than the house Sherlock had seen in the distance along the same coastline as his own. Sherlock realises his assumption that Angus in the lighthouse is his only neighbour is not based on solid data; signs of life here would have been hard to spot without binoculars. Sherlock can now see that this house is lived in: it's old, but someone has been doing some loving repairs. The now-withered roses drooping off a trellis by the door must have been a beautiful sight during the summer, and the bannister has been recently replaced. A banged-up Range Rover is tucked away at the end of the road leading to the house, safe from the wind behind some apple trees. Some fruit still sits on the ground, rotting and being feasted upon by the last butterflies of the summer. The house is further away from the shore than Sherlock's; perhaps the surrounding fields, now pushing up yellowed flowers and tall grass dancing in the breeze, had once been farmed by the inhabitants.
Sherlock is not going to take a junior's word as gospel, so he phones the nurse’s station and demands that one of them takes a phone to John.
"Your brother helped your husband make sure you had a support system if you needed it," Ella says. "What's the harm in accepting that help?"
'? It's
"Your plant's dying, though."
As they are leaving, however, Sherlock lingers behind and a few words John can't make out from where he's putting on his coat in the corridor are exchanged between patient and psychiatrist. It takes some time before Sherlock emerges from the appointment room, though no further conversation takes place there. When he joins John in the foyer, Sherlock wordlessly passes him a sheet of paper. It's a statement Joanna has written, to be taken to the King's Occupational Health Unit.
"What are you talking about?"
I never shared needles. I never shared––

'Are you still on good terms?' Sherlock asks.
feels out of place, just as he does at the physicians' lounge at work, eavesdropping on other surgeons comparing Maldives' five-star resorts, sports car engine sizes and California golf courses. John could have all that, do all that, but he doesn't want to. All he wants is to feel at home and have interesting patients he can help. He's given up excitement for a bit of luxury, but he doesn't know what to do with the latter.
"Marriage is not an exchange of favours or something in which you must match in skill. In a good marriage, you complement each other, make each other better. John once told me he feels privileged to look after you, and that he's never felt like that in a relationship before. But he also made the point many times that it's not about the sort of looking after a parent does. He has always made that very clear that he doesn't see himself in that role."
"But that's not the real reason, I presume? That you burned the records sounds quite… should I say dramatic? At least within this context of just wanting to preserve your medical privacy?"
"An unnecessary emergency craniotomy is just not on," John reminds him. "You just got bullied by a barrister and thrown in a cell. A disgusting one, I might add. You're not thinking straight."
"A lot can happen in two months," Sherlock says, "or nothing."
Perhaps he's ready to face her scrutiny. Six days with John, who'd flown home yesterday, had been a welcome respite and a breath of normalcy, and he feels more like himself than he has in weeks. They slept in, went to a few museums, lounged around in the evenings reading books and watching TV. There were no plans, no excursions the likes of which their holidays abroad are often peppered with. There was time to pick up on each other's moods, space for intimacy to develop and while they didn't make love during those six days, there was more physicality than Sherlock remembers experiencing with John in years. They've been too swept off by their careers to notice each other lately.
"He's not," you say. "He is a graduate chemist and knows a hell of a lot about pharmacology. And not just recreationally."
For a man who has prided himself in living in the moment, Sherlock has made him awfully and oddly concerned about plans.

Sherlock now regrets not taking out his violin last night to practise. He should have also picked something a bit more demanding to play in front of his old violin tutor and French teacher. Georges Thibaut is the former concertmaster of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra who had moved to Sussex for his retirement with his wife Sarah, who is from Haywards Heath. After Sherlock had demonstrated an interest in the instrument when he'd seen and heard his cousins playing at family celebrations, Violet had told Sherlock he could have lessons if he behaved. Thibaut was more distinguished than anyone teaching beginner children needed to be, but he'd been giving lessons to several local children already and was happy to accept a new pupil. When Violet pulled Sherlock out of the village school, Thibaut became his French teacher as well. Lessons with the quiet, unassuming man who was very ambitious when it came to the achievements of his students had been one of the best things Sherlock remembers about growing up. Violin was one thing he turned out to be good at and about which Violet wasn't relentlessly on his case. In fact, Violet didn't seem to care much how he fared. All she paid attention to was whether he did was he was told in therapy and outside of it, and that he did his schoolwork.
"I don't know," Sherlock complains. "I can't work it out."
"I wonder what he's doing right now," Sherlock wonders, then realises to his horror after glancing at Lestrade's expression that he's said it out loud.
After pouring them both two fingers of their best scotch, John begins reading. He skims through most of the bureaucratic introductory text and skips some of the less important cookie-cutter bits before focussing on the details specific to Sherlock's case.
"It was the company, nothing else, that made it tolerable," Sherlock replies deadpan. John will know he's bluffing at least a little. He wouldn't mind a holiday in Scotland every once in a while, as long as they are short. He does wonder if John would feel awkward returning as a couple, but that's John's dilemma to process, not his. As he had told John, he's done being the soft, warm body of a landing pad for the freefalls of other people's sexual crises.
[Post-S2 angst]
"Of course not."
"I'll take that as a no." Mycroft leans back against his seat.
"I haven't developed X-ray vision so yes."
"Extraordinarily," Joanna replies in a sombre tone.
Sherlock tries googling the contact information for Princess Royal’s patient advocate, then realises he wouldn’t know how to justify demanding an exception to the visiting rules. John seems to think it's awkward and a bit tactless to demand special treatment, except when it's for Sherlock's benefit. Isn't it unfair that John couldn't be granted the same comforts?

I remember a nightmare from the days before the wedding. I was at the venue, trying to make sure everything was ready for the reception. As I moved about the place, I kept bleeding; thin, burgundy trickles of blood on the flood, creating a map, not unlike that of the London underground. Nobody noticed. Nobody saw, or if they did, they seemed to think it was normal.
"And you haven't even checked your emails since then. I can't decide what we should do, because I don't know what's going on in your head. I don't know what will help and what won't. I thought things were looking up; you did great on Monday with that AVM and I thought it would make things look a bit brighter. But then…"
Sherlock nods. They haven't quite said it, yet, but if this trial will be an attempted character assassination, then this consulting barrister needs to have all the facts.
Whichever registrar is involved, John is suddenly proud of. "You know that's a strong contraindication if there's no life-saving reason to do the tap."

Instead, Violet says, "You see, I was never good at that sort of thing. People. Was a bit of a bookworm, never quite fit in with other girls and their fancies at school. Other children weren't interested in what I liked. I can't say I've ever enjoyed extensive socialising; it takes a lot out of a person, doesn't it? I do want to have other company occasionally than just your father. This, joining in to do concrete things, this keeps it at a tolerable level. I know what to expect, what my role is. I am told I am often too opinionated, too honest. Why is it that people can be offended by facts? That girl's trumpet-playing was dreadful, anyone could hear that."
Sherlock looked down, indulging in a long look at his cock disappearing into John’s body before looking up again. He was carefully managing his level of arousal, staving off his orgasm despite being on the knife’s edge. John’s body was hot and tight and welcoming around him, and he was bloody

"Once they start letting us out of the base, we'll go running on Terceira. That should wean you off those Portuguese soap operas you've been bingeing in here."
"He's got several big risk factors for accidental awareness, that's for sure. Hemodynamic instability, late night emergency case, cardiac surgery, neuromuscular blockade. Past substance use as well."
“Waiting at the ear, nose and throat patients' ward at the Princess Royal Hospital. The operation shouldn’t take long; I’m hoping to be informed promptly whether he’ll be brought to the ward or taken to the ITU.”
"Yeah, that's what they told me. They won't wean him off and extubate for at least a few hours, possibly not today if he's not stable enough."
The woman watches him, and John can tell protocol is warring with simple human compassion in her thinking. She glances around before addressing John. "There was one
John lets his arms drop when Sherlock tries to step to the side. He collects his socks and underwear and drops them into the laundry basket. "What do you even mean by a 'good' session?" he asks incredulously. "What constitutes such a thing?"
He'd get bored here. It would be unrealistic to think John's company could provide enough sustenance for his brain. Yet it has turned out to be such a potent attraction that it has made him rethink his attachment to London.
"To what?"
Lestrade grabs a retractor and forceps and inspects the situation. "I think we can get it. It's not attached to the artery, just grown around that one bend of it. You got nearly all of it out before the bleed.
John sits up. "I wasn't being
He's not certain his patient has understood his point. He's not making it very well, is he? "Mr Zezelj… I made a mistake.  And I'm sorry. Please believe me that I am truly very sorry. I had to cut off the blood supply to some of your brain, which has caused you the stroke. Some of its symptoms will likely be permanent."
"How would I go about opposing it, exactly? He doesn't listen to me and does what he pleases."
now?!"
drains = tubes used to remove pus, blood or other substances produced by the body from a surgical site. They’re also useful for monitoring for potential bleeds.
"Have you had your uniform dry-cleaned?" he asks, then adds shyly: "is there a particular reason?"
"I'm not having the GA," Sherlock tells Mike.
____________
Right now, all you feel is relief and gratitude, though you know both are premature. This man's stitching skills are the only thing standing between Sherlock and death. He's not out of the woods yet. He's not out of the woods until that valve has grown into his own tissue like a tree curling around man-made structures in the forest.
, Sherlock tells himself.
tell him this, and you can't read on his features whether it helps, but in your own ears it hadn't sounded dismissive or pretentiously optimistic. "I know you're shite at patience," you add, "but it's early days yet. I promise to tell you if you seem to have gone daft, eh?"
The nurse's report is succinct: "Doctor Watson woke up, had some yoghurt, another dose of oxycodone, and went back to sleep."
, Sherlock."
oxy = oxycodone, a strong opioid analogous to morphine but has a better ratio of absorption in different administration forms and causes less hallucinations
. I did not take one of your tablets. And the fact that, instead of attending to the pain you're obviously in, you are focussed on suspecting me of something like that is…" Sherlock takes a moment of track down the right word: "
"And you know I like knowing what I'm eating. And you keep telling me you don't want to waste what little free time we have in the evenings standing in the kitchen."
"You've got water?" John asks. "I have a large spare jug I could lend you, unless Angus is sorting you out."
Once I begin speaking, it's hard to stop. Things tumble out. Slip out. Things I thought were over and done with, dealt with, put away, filed away in the Mind Palace. Mary. The Lazarus plan. Serbia. I can tell from John's shifting expressions and the fact that he was suddenly asking about my time away that he feared that it was not narcotics use but an event even more sinister which had infected me, that I had concealed this from him even now, blaming a contaminated needle.
We've never heard much about John's family save for Harry, and it seems it's a topic he really doesn't want to discuss.
, John muses to himself. "What instructions did he get, then, from that nutritionist?"
"Good job," Lestrade says enthusiastically. "I know I could count on you to sub for Alan."
"Never mind. No one but Collings can make the discharge decision, anyway," Sherlock snaps, then rings off without waiting for the nurse's reply.
"Bilateral formation is not unheard of, especially not in adults," Sherlock declares.
' What's that supposed to mean? Is her name somehow supposed to make me feel pity for her for having a bisexual husband, for make me feel guilty over seducing you to cheat on a ghost?
"I'll try," Sherlock says.
When his mother opens the door, he replies nothing to her fussy, surprised greetings. He realises he should have messaged them about taking a later train. He'd been so wrapped up in his thoughts, so struggling to manage to logistics to get here, that other people just didn't fit into the equation.
"Exactly. So, maybe I wanted to show up at Bastion looking like I
Sherlock has never requested such a thing — in fact, he's opposed such things on several occasion during both physical and emotional crises. For him to
Maybe they're expired. It's not a good idea, anyway. It's not going to fix anything to drug him.
The senior surgeon has suggested they get something to eat before heading down to the locker room; Sherlock had declined. He'd vomit if he tried to force something down right now.
You've stood beside the two of them as they conversed. "You really want to feed that addiction right now?" you ask the older Holmes after the registrar excuses himself.
Sherlock ignores him. They were supposed to come here to get a small outpatient procedure and then some prescriptions and then go home. They were supposed to go to Sandhurst.
"Would it be fair to say that you dealt with it by not dealing with it? When you were growing up, there was no one you to whom could express the emotions your relationship with your mother created, so those emotions remained largely unaddressed until a few Christmases ago. After Afghanistan, you were in survival mode, pushing your emotions aside again to help John who was in crisis. Your turn never quite came, did it?
"Can you answer a question for me?" John asks, "and don't just say the first thing that comes to mind? Just… really give it a think, hmm? For me?"
In the car, he tells John about his planned surgeries like he always does. John is on administrative duty today, wearing a crisp new dove-grey suit Sherlock had helped him pick out. His choice of pocket square is all wrong for the shade of grey, but Sherlock elects not to say anything. He's not as bothered by it as he should be.
"What the media says passes, Sherlock," Joanna says patiently. "The public's trust in doctors and the NHS is still very high even though these occasional scandals happen."
Mary Watson hadn't been drunk. It was just an accident. The Coroner's Inquest and the police investigation revealed that the true culprit was the driver of the truck that had rammed into the driver's seat side of the Watsons' car. He'd ran a red light.
," Sherlock protests, but there's not much force behind it. He has tucked his legs underneath him on the sofa while Violet sits with her feet primly on the floor and a decorative pillow on her lap.
that, instead of contacting me in a civil manner, someone would commit a murder and attempt another at my workplace," Sherlock declares dramatically.
"Then you must, and you will. Take the word of an old man who wasted years after giving up what they loved: when time passes and the shame fades, you will see things differently. Perhaps expedite that process by accepting help from others so that you won't waste as much time as I did?"
"His mother?"
Sherlock shrugs and slides out the right one from the pile. Mycroft had printed them out for him.
colleagues, solid performers, go through a proper tribunal and it's worse than you can possibly imagine. None of them harmed anyone deliberately, nor did you, and getting dragged through that hell is not fair punishment for such a thing. Let the Trust handle it internally by not making it sound worse than it is."
"There is no love lost between him and his father, but not everyone who goes through that behaves in the same way towards others."
The continuous sound of the shower is interrupted by someone stepping under the spray and then you hear an almost obscene groan which makes you grin. Sherlock has now spent two days at the regular ward and finally been giving the green light for a shower. The usual recommendation is to wait longer both because there's a risk of it being too exerting and the wound has not closed yet, but with some ingenious taping and plastic bits by Helena, Sherlock's day shift nurse and a bit of pressure from Mycroft towards the ward doctors, their patient has been given the green light. You know how much it means to him — not being able to maintain personal hygiene to his standards has been driving Sherlock barmy.
He does so, coiled tight and jiggling his foot, ready to spring to flight. When this anxious, he always seems younger than his age, boyish, unsure what to do with the proportions of his body.
"After or during particularly stressful periods in his life, he is prone to mood deterioration, which interferes with his thinking and ability to communicate."
"My father… and Mycroft… both on statins."
Vandersteen has represented over twenty physicians in similar proceedings and had offered to arrange for Sherlock to speak with several of these former clients if he wants references, but Sherlock doesn't want to speak to others who have gone through this. Their cases are different. He wants neither the depressing stories of failure nor any false-hope-inducing tales of being found not impaired by a Tribunal.
He's what, exactly?
"Sherlock has mentioned that your parents passed away when you and Harriet were in your twenties. Was it an accident?"
"And you proved them all wrong. Including your mother, and she's got to have been the hardest sell."
At the flat, Sherlock declines his husband's offer of a joint soak. He wants space for his thoughts, and John's attempts at getting him to relax and forget about work feel grating and artificial. He can't just push things out of his mind and to reassure himself like John can. Even though nothing
"Possibly."
therapist anymore — surely, there are others who are more in need of her services.
"Not necessarily after such a delay as we see here between her death and the crimes he committed," Halloran says, twirling a pen between her fingers. "It was the Coroner's Inquest results which seem to have triggered his decision, not her loss per se." She puts the pen down and addresses Sherlock. "This is why defence will be going after you,
What visitor? How does Mycroft knows Sherlock has been moved to the–– oh neverthebloody mind!
"I don't think so. I'm sorry; I could have invited you to come visit a bit later. Or should I go wake him up?"
Sherlock gapes. "Even I can tell that was rude."
, so it must go both ways. He helps you, but that's what people do in a marriage. I… things I said about John in the beginning and things I said about that Victor were all because it worried me you might latch onto a person who wouldn't treat you right. Victor obviously didn't. But John is not your caregiver, that much is obvious to me, because you haven't needed a caregiver for many years, Sherlock."
On Malta, John had so much time on his hands that missing Sherlock became a morbid pastime. Thankfully, an old diving instructor friend working in the Philippines had managed to coax him to be the liveaboard director of two luxury liveaboard trips around the region. The diving had been amazing on pristine reefs, and John had put on a few extra pounds from the fantastic food, and the groups he'd been guiding and instructing had been great, but when he had retreated to his cabin in the evenings, he'd felt like he was in the wrong place. Things with Sherlock were so new, so… delicate, and John worried tremendously about the man's safety and how he was coping alone. He would have preferred to follow Sherlock to England, to make sure he'd be alright under the stress of the aftermath of the now very public affair he'd had with Moriarty. The liveaboard yacht had WiFi, but not enough bandwith for video or even audio calls, so they had mostly exchanged emails and iMessages. Sherlock kept assuring him he was doing alright, and John didn't want to push him to be more open than he felt comfortable at the time.
"You said it, not me. Outrageous. Wouldn't want to ruin a clean uniform like that, would I?"
John's expression sobers. "No. Are we back to this again? I'm listening because you're important to me. I'm not some saint with a charity project; I'm with you because I want to be. I love you because you're you instead of sitting around hoping you'd be different or wishing you didn't need a therapist. I needed one, too. Haven't we gone through all this?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're written your account; now, you can let the whole thing go. We all forget things and fuck up occasionally; you just have to accept that," John tells him.
She nods towards the windowsill; there, what looks like an unusually thick gastroscope is wrapped in plastic. "I'm sure you can watch the exam, hear how the valve is doing. If the anaesthetist gives the all-clear and Sherlock's haemodynamics look fine during that sedation break, we can move onto extubation."
"He gave me a small plastic tank, which I'll need to fill soon. How the hell did you understand what he was saying?"
Maybe watching him in the OR today will offer John some answers. He really doesn't seem to have a solid argument for why Sherlock shouldn't undertake this specific operation after handling many others so well after that mistake he thinks he made. Going to Greg will feel like betrayal, and undoubtedly dig out a lot of issues they have already tried to put to rest in their marriage — such as John's tendency to be condescending rather than supportive.
Mitral valve = the valve between the left ventricle and the left atrium. It’s attached to the ventricle via tendons called chordae tendinae, and if those snap, the valve begins to leak a lot. This is where the story gets its name! If the blood flows back into the atrium, the ventricle where it was supposed to go can’t pump enough of it into the aorta and consequently to the rest of the body. Hence the low BP. The blood ends up congesting the lungs because that’s where it arrived in the atrium from.
You've armed yourself with data a bit like Sherlock conceals his insecurities and fears in factual information, and you push on. "Up to one in eight heart attack survivors develop PTSD. Stress-related anxiety, sleeping problems and mood issues on a smaller scale are dead common, Sherlock. You needed emergency surgery for heart failure — plenty bad enough that you'd still be affected."
Edgar knows that he attends therapy because the PA needs to be aware of everything that goes into Sherlock's calendar. It's a matter of necessity, just like disclosing his ASD had been. Edgar has always been the very soul of respect and discretion, so his awareness grates on Sherlock's confidence less than other people knowing. He's glad that John has also had a therapist — mainly because it has greatly helped John and benefited their relationship, but also because it means that needing therapy per se is not just something that happens to Sherlock in their household.
"Life is a death sentence," I tell him disinterestedly. "We're all just hurtling through space on an overcrowded, over-polluted rock waiting for our cells to reach the end of their regenerative abilities."
to get through it…" He nods. "Acceptable."
that she's got an open cranial fracture, thank you!" he snaps, his tone tight and higher pitched than usual. He's vibrating a painful sort of nervous energy.
The name of this chapter comes from
"Geah," Angus says, pursing his lips. He then launches into an animated explanation, none of which Sherlock understands, but the blond man clearly has had practice interpreting the lighthouse-keeper's obscure speech, and he's nodding empathetically. Thankfully, Angus' explanation is as short as it is incomprehensible.
"That's what makes this part of physio nice, you know. Fast, concrete progress. In two days, the loo. Who knows, maybe by next week you can get all the way to the cafeteria."
You should call the locum agency, pick up some shifts. Then again, you know what walking the last steps to the front door after would feel like, how the rock at the bottom of your stomach would grind and make the bile churn. He's anxious about everything and you're anxious for him. What a pair you make.
"How can you make a comparison when there is no baseline to these tests? All you have is me, now. Nobody knows what I was like before."
"I didn't visit very often," Sherlock admits, voice strained.
"Angus says you live in that rickety thing by the bay. The old Drever house."
By the time there's only twenty minutes left before they have to start driving, John still hasn't emerged from the bedroom. Sherlock goes in to investigate; the lump underneath the duvet confirms that his husband is failing to adhere to their plans.
How much does Mycroft even know? Are his spies truly everywhere, hiding in the church ruins overlooking the lowlands where John's house sits battered by the elements? Do they man even the Westray the post office; had they guided the vessel through the waves which had taken Sherlock back to the mainland?
"You don't usually get this emotional when we discuss John. Do you think your panic attack was connected to work, or to what's happening at home?"
is a good summary of how it affects his life," Mycroft answers courteously, "the precise diagnosis he received is a product of a less informed age, so it is best to say that yes, he is on the autism Spectrum. The last thing he would want, however, is to discuss it."
"Ain’t about luck."
"Have a nice bloody night, then," his rejected companion says when Sherlock begins hastily putting his clothes back on.
"Prompted by an argument?"
The anaesthetist is delayed, and consequently so is the ultrasound exam. You've kept Mycroft updated via texts and calls, and at four in the morning he walks into the ITU, listens quietly as you introduce all the equipment and give him a report on what's been going on. He looks unburdened by the ungodly hour, on which you comment sarcastically. He replies in a matter-of-fact tone that there are developments in the Middle East which have detained him and kept him alert.
[23.49] I shall collect you after work tomorrow.
You can't help grinning, then flashing that triumphant smile in Mycroft's direction as well. Who better to prove Sherlock's still got it than the man who also has… well…
"Formal criminal charges have been filed against him and my brother's sources say he's gone to Bahrain. They have no extradition treaty with the UK; going there means he's worried about having to stand trial. He hasn't contacted me since I left for Malta. I can't be sure he never will, but for now, he's gone."
"We're going to need a hell of a lot of practice for that," John says, looking sombre.
"Legend says it was lost, but I am more inclined to believe it never even existed. Convenient excuse;
"What matters?" I'm growing rather tired of Mycroft right now.
"Yes, sometimes doctors and nurses and physical therapists and porters and psychologists are preoccupied with their own lives and sometimes stuff in our lives affects our work quality. But, a tiny bit of healthy selfishness of not wanting to work overtime all the time doesn't mean that we've completely lost it when it comes to medical ethics. This job requires an exceptional, almost psychopathic level of compartmentalisation and distancing of oneself from the most horrid injuries, crime and abuse. We can't lose our souls in the fates of our patients, because if we crumble, they crumble. Making decisions which may save or condemn a patient's life requires us not to topple under the pressure of the awareness of what we're doing, so we are forced to learn how to distance ourselves from it. There's always the next case, then the next: if we put all our energy in one hopeless case, then how are we going to walk into the OR soon after it to anaesthetise or operate on the next patient, hmm?"
"We will get through this, Sherlock. And we won't be waiting until the Tribunal to start preparing for your return to clinical work. The better we prepare, the less anxious you will feel doing it."
? It's called gynaecology. Why didn't you tell me?"
The bed has been pushed side-first against the wall with a window. On the opposite wall hangs an enlarged old photograph of a man with a pipe and a worn flat cap pulling a large, old-fashioned fishing net into a small boat. He's looking at the camera with a smile, and his features much resemble John's.
"Hello,
"Yes."
"That's preposterous."
"It's an antifungal which should clear this right up at this stage."
He puts the bag of crystal on the kitchen counter and glares at it.
"Of course I wouldn't think he needs punishing! After Afghanistan, he was… he couldn't be expected to understand what it was like for me in the halo vest."
"What about the second piece?" asks Violet.
am." Sherlock's brother has been of no use with his faux-soothing declarations of Sherlock just needing time. You haven't contacted him lately. Let him believe everything is fine for all the help he's been.
"No."
John goes to him, drops to his haunches and pulls Sherlock into an embrace. Large pearls of silent tears soon wet the shoulder of John's shirt.
"I took you off the case more for your sake than his."
Wiggins stares at him; first, his gaze is hostile, then curious. “You’re that bloke from yesterday. Batteries?”
, since I've seen it happen, so…" He shakes his head, still muttering before clearing his throat. "There is no such thing as
John nods, places a palm on the silky fabric covering Sherlock's knee to prompt him to continue.
Mycroft left after sunset, visibly comforted by the sight of Sherlock resting while you keep vigil. Mostly, when you watch him attend to his brother, unease seems to flirt with concern. You know what it's like to worry about Sherlock constantly. When he was well, it was just a hum in your bones, an invisible tether you kept taut in your mind between the two of you so you'd never be far enough to come to his aid. Now, even the oxygen mask on his face — necessary again because of the sedation — is a wall high enough between you to make you restless.
, John."
They stand there, in the kitchen, for some time; John keeps his arms wrapped around Sherlock and ends up rocking gently as though preparing to take a waltz's first step. There will be no more dancing around the issue burning at the back of his mind, though — they need to continue talking once this passes.
Holmes steps down from the armchair. He's wearing pyjamas underneath a blue, silky dressing gown. The open sash dangles near his feet on both sides. "Do patients typically get roasted repeatedly with magnetic resonance imaging when they contract a conservatively managed fracture?"
"Well, the bar is still all green, and they're in the middle of their designated, I mean planned, OR time. I'm sorry, that's all I can tell you since I can't open the detailed patient timestamp records without due reason. I'll try calling him."
"We should be alright. Many others won't be, but…"
" Sherlock is breathing hard, feeling the seconds tick by as though they were blows to the back of his head. He has five seconds, at most, before the bleeding restarts in earnest and he loses the visual of the sack. He has no time to extend the incision, no time to even reveal the neck of the feeding artery where he needs to place the clip.
John is proud of himself for having had the good sense to put Sherlock's phone on silent and leave it in the kitchen last night; the screen is constantly lighting up with messages — 83 so far — and attempted calls — 34 and counting.
— stops John in the hall to say that if there's anything he can do, all John needs to do is ask. They all expect him to convey these things to Sherlock instead of contacting the man themselves.
"I want it, and I don't want it. But if you're there–– I'm fine once I'm in the OR; it's just that before and after––" Sherlock mutters.
Emma swaps the old syringe for a new one, then checks the dressing covering the entry point of his large central line.
"Hm?" John is certain he hadn't heard right.

"Trevor was a patriot. That's what separated the two of you and why you'll never understand why dedicating one's life to service to the Crown is the highest calling a man could have."

Sherlock glances towards the pen where Edward The Abdicator is weltering in a tuft of browned grass.
"I am sorry, brother mine."
“And you met him where?”
"We had to queue for the trauma CT since they were imaging a stroke alert first, so we decided to request for a FAST to see if more specialties needed to be called in. Possible liver laceration but no active bleeding, CT confirmed that there was no need for angiography. It also showed an L3 burst fracture with shards in the spinal column plus stable fractures in the processus spinosae of two thoracic vertebrae."
Holmes," Sherlock corrects, ignoring the hand she offers for shaking.
that it wasn't my fault that I got shot and there's nothing embarrassing about it, but you know how they look at colleagues at work who have to leave their positions for whatever reason? The sort of pity and I'm-glad-it-wasn't me?"
; I need to concentrate."
Two crime scene technicians are summoned to verify what Sherlock has just said. They find a spatter and pooling patterns on the floor and the surrounding cabinets.
John takes his hand to keep him from retreating somewhere. "Are you nervous to go back into theatre?"
"Oh?"
Joanna's expression is determined. "I understand your scepticism; it may well seem like a daunting task right now to try to navigate the aftermath with him. But there is also the element of time, which will do its work regardless of how much progress you think you can bring about. Sometimes a bit of distance is a good thing — in this case it's a distance from the stresses of his work duties. Time to do all those things together you've been putting off because you're busy."
"It was always you, and no one else," I tell him, and the way he looks at me makes the doubts disappear.
"I'm not––" Sherlock starts, then finds himself being pulled to his feet and pinned against the table as palms slide up his back. John leans in to kiss him, ending the long, lingering snog with a gentle nip of Sherlock's lower lip between his teeth.
They pulled up in front of 221B in record time. "Aren't you going to open the car door for us brother mine?"
"I concur although I fail to see how she thought assaulting me with a hammer would deliver her the desired results as it is impossible to literally knock sense into someone."
Sherlock whirled around, "Who said that?!"
"It matters a great deal, that's what this is all about, and I know the answer."
"Now John, you know Sherlock would NEVER hurt an animal even accidentally."
John grinned as he knelt between Sherlock's knees and gave him a tender, warm kiss. "Hope you know I'm not the kind of boy who gets on his knees on the first date for just anybody."
It isn't surprising that the skull initiates the conversation as he IS after all the most senior of Sherlock's possessions. "Well, well the whole place all to ourselves. The two horny idiots are off on holiday, Valentine's Day-bosh!, and the housekeeper, pardon, landlady is gone to visit her sister."
"So you finally accept we DO have a Queen?"
"Alright, I believe you and it's easy to deduce that we didn't get blind drunk. No empties or glasses anywhere and, I don't know about you but, I'm not hungover."
"Remember, John, our month long moratorium - Forgiveness Day."
"Most popular songs : Bridge Over Troubled Water, If You Really Love Me, Stay Awhile, Tired of Being Alone, Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get, You've Got a Friend, and The Wedding Song, aka There Is Love. Remind you of our relationship, yes?"
"Yes, truly the product of a 'remarkable mind' coming up with a fake name."
Hudders had been right. The aroma of biscuits wafting from 221A drew Sherlock like a moth to a flame.
John went up to his room, returned with a box wrapped in shiny purple paper topped with a fancy white bow and placed it on the table in front of Sherlock. "Go on then, you only need to lift the lid."
"Nope! I'll be saving all my strength for the rest of the month."
We'll take our leave and go.
The ceiling above chimed in, "And just where do you suppose all the exploded muck off you and them winds up? On ME!!"
Memory loss, another point for Mike. "It's alright, you've been sick for a few weeks and running a pretty high fever these last couple of days."
Standing up to loom over Sherlock, a strange sensation, John softened his voice. "It's my effort to to tell you it matters to ME. YOU matter to me."
"Besides", silver and gold bristled, "where he and I get shoved is no picnic in Regent's Park!"
Martha, now deprived of her magic mirror, ceased her ardent 'watchfulness' of her foster son and his husband. But truth be told she WAS known to sit before her crystal ball on nights when the moon was full, just to make certain all was right in the world and, of course, for science.
"I know, 'Golden Joinery'."
"John, John! He didn't come back! What did I do wrong?"
"And?"
"Hold on, what's happened to the 11th?"
The room was darkened and the DVD began to whir. At first nothing of note occurred, a bit of fondling and foreplay with Wesix spewing a constant string of filthy talk that would make a Royal Marine cringe while Sherlock was completely silent as if in a stupor.
"The usual fan mail, you know. Loved the case, very exciting, amazing as always...etc etc blah blah blah."
John had rolled his eyes, shaken his head and then laughed himself silly when Sherlock's gift to him was a year's home delivery from Milk & More. Every morning by 7am they would have fresh milk in glass bottles, cheese and yogurt on their doorstep.
"I seem to have lots more energy now, must be the company."
"Behave", John giggles.
"Beaches!"
"What's happening John? I don't remember coming to bed, I don't...I don't remember anything."
"Little suspicious that. Why?"
"Then open the drawer wanker and let us out!", came the muffled reply.
Warily, Sherlock peeled back the bubble wrap, froze and then gingerly removed the prize- Billy. No longer fractured into jagged pieces, the skull had been fully restored with every shard and fissure expertly mended with broad strokes and fine lines of lacquer that gleamed gold in the fairy lights in the room.
"I don't ask much of you, Sherlock. Just pick one - fruitcake, eggnog."
"Where have you been, John? I've been calling you for hours!"
"Don't set none too well with me either, mate.", the counter replied.
"You are a tenacious brat. If you must know, I took a clue from your book and used Mycroft's Coutts Silk Card."
"If it applies to both of us I'm game."
"John has found that it is helpful to talk about his PTSD nightmares. You might find discussing it revealing."
Strangely, after that, Martha seldom consulted the mirror in daylight hours preferring to wait until the sky darkened and the stars shined.
"Oh, beyond a doubt. So a schoolteacher got the drop on you?"
"Woo-hoo, boys? I'm coming in so grab some clothes if you aren't wearing any. But don't overdo it, does someone my age good to see a bit of biceps and bums."
After sending the missive on its fiery way, it had been a lovely rest of the day with more decorating, Chinese takeaway and cuddles in front of the warm fire. That lingering contentment made Sherlock's distress all the more heart wrenching come morning.
"But you never get up to anything questionable."
"You're acting like this is normal, John."
Eyes twinkling, John sent a short text.
🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
Unleashing a very unmannerly belch, the bedside table drawer popped open to reveal a pair of sleek dildos- one purple, one silver and gold.
John nodded in sympathy. "Our subconscious minds can be right bastards at times, bloody nightmares."
When last call had long passed, he stumbled tits over tea kettles out of The Beehive Pub and tried to decide what to do next. If he had gone to The Volunteer, a short ways from 221B, he could have crawled home. But the "blog groupies" had become too bothersome there and Sherlock had been lured by, of course, the promise of Bees. So John faced the prospect of a daunting trek or risking throwing up in the backseat of a cab, provided he could get one. Besides, he didn't want to go home, if Baker Street could even be called that anymore. Unfortunately his housing options had evaporated like his dreams. He had only himself to blame for not being honest with Sherlock about...well damn near everything. Now it was too late.
"Not me, you. But I'd rather we avoid the court case."
"Well spotted, Watson. I've done my research...hmpf, don't think I didn't see you just roll your eyes...at any rate, as it happens there's a plethora of obscure holidays to be celebrated in August. I've made a comprehensive spreadsheet."
"I'm sure you know", Sherlock grunted as his full stomach impeded his efforts to tie his shoes, "that I knew all along it was you moving the elf and not magic."
"Listen to all of them Brother dear", pinged John's laptop. "All day long every single day- peck peck peck! My keys have bruises every colour of the rainbow."
Giving Sherlock a sympathetic squeeze John guessed, "Madhouse mob scene was it?"
John grunted, that explained why Sherlock didn't deign to come home until after breakfast that morning. "You should have let me know you were coming, Sherlock. I've only prepared enough for two."
"Fruitcakes are only good as doorstops and Hudders always does our eggnog."
"Hello dear. How thoughtful but you needn't have bothered replacing the milk, that boy is always borrowing things. I don't really notice most of the time unless I decide to bake and my eggs, flour, sugar, and milk have disappeared only to be reincarnated as the cure for bubonic plague or jock itch or whatever else his latest mad scientist experiment is when it's at home."
It wasn't helping that John was seeing multiple Marthas plus the sight of her glowering down at him, arms crossed in defiance and her hair a riot of curlers in every color of the rainbow, made him move double time.
Before any further discussion could ensue, the stairs sounded the "humans are coming" alarm and the flat went deathly still.
"Sorry. Initially they weren't but I called Mycroft that same night, from the Chinese actually and he put Greg right on it. For someone so smart you can be pretty dense sometimes, welcome to my world. The cabbie's fingerprints were on both capsules but only one had both his and yours. Got the answer fairly quickly and I want you to know, you got it wrong Sherlock. You would have swallowed the poison. You got it WRONG!"
One eyebrow arched high and head tilted, John adds, "Yes, indeed there will and I'll be the one giving it."
John found it utterly charming that his usually over confident flatmate seemed shy and a tad nervous as he sat perched on the edge of his chair worrying at his shoeless foot. "You see I told you, a perfectly good sock ruined."
"I'm sorry, but yes. Only then is the incubus as in thrall with his victim as the victim is with him. If you were to attack Wesix in his human form you might trounce him but not capture him and it would do nothing to rescue Sherlock. Trust me, please, I have a plan."
"It's your Elf on the Shelf. He's going to watch over you and report back to Father Christmas every day as to whether you've been naughty or nice. In return you get to name him."
"Ok, I'll make you a deal. If I promise that tomorrow your elf won't be boring, you promise to play along."
"Not so much. I doubt your brother actually pays his own bills and it's possible that Anthea is secretly one of Santa's helpers and will fail to 'notice' certain charges. But just in case we need to hedge our bets." He grabbed the pirate's sash from the bedside lampshade and used it to clean Sherlock's now sticky belly. "We only need to insure that nothing is returnable."
"Good! Now getting up to speed, 1st August WAS International Forgiveness Day so we're off to an excellent start. I make a motion that that particular holiday be extended to encompass the entire month. I also second the motion. Motion carried."
He whispered his plan in her ear. Then he climbed the seventeen stairs with the sound of Martha's gleeful cackling following behind with a cheery "Toodle Pip."
"30th August, the aforementioned Bank Holiday coincides with Frankenstein Day. I can procure enough body parts from Molly to..."
"Quite so Detective." He withdrew the orb from his jacket and handed it to Sherlock.
"I concur, John. Having no frame of reference for our previous activities is disconcerting to say the least. I agree more rest IS in order for all of us."
To be perfectly fair, John had been rather diligent in placing William in ways that Sherlock could retrieve his rewards without being tempted to, or accidentally, disturbing the elf. This WAS meant to be fun after all, and John hoped they would make it to Christmas without incident. Unfortunately that was not to be.
Knowing this was coming, John sighed, "When I came home you were already asleep, my laptop beside you. But the elf was still in the sitting room. By the time I was ready for bed he'd gone but it was obvious you had broken the magic. William won't be back unless you write a note apologizing for your mistake. Until you do he'll be too weak to resume his duties. I DID say."
Wide eyed Sherlock whispered, "I do if you do. Wait, didn't we already have this conversation?"
Not a client then, and "I" have a guest, not "we". "So I hear." Turning stiffly John came face to face for the first time with HIM.

Stumbling back, Sherlock plopped down in his chair. "Good! Saves me tellin' you to sit and shut up."
"Oi! Checking the comments on the blog, YOUR idea if you recall. Ask me, just another ploy to get people to stroke your enormous ego."
"I understand sweetheart. We're talking about Hudders."
Before both feet were firmly on the floor, her voice rang out. "Who dares to breach the sanctity of this tower and accost my son?"
"Yeah, I get so damned frustrated sometimes. It's like NOTHING can distract him."
"I would and good on her. Thing is, this friend wants to get her something unique and thought we might offer a suggestion."
"Perfect", Martha chirped, "we can start on these salmon and cream cheese canapés while we wait. I just happen to have mixed us each a small gin and tonic to wash them down."
Less than two weeks before Christmas Sherlock awoke to find John off to work a double shift and the elf astride the open screen of John's laptop. An email on his own mobile instructed him that more photos of John were waiting in a marked file IF Sherlock could deduce the latest password. Normally this wouldn't have been a problem but, whether through anticipation or overconfidence, Sherlock's efforts were met with failure time and again. Finally in exasperation he snatched the elf from his perch and tossed him carelessly on the table and sequestered himself in the bedroom. Hours later he was at last able to open the file which showcased sexy poses of John both in his fatigues and full dress uniform.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow. "Am I wrong, then?"
Greg's voice was suddenly next to John. Whose hands were rubbing all over her? "Molly, what's the safeword?"
John pushed forward slowly, until he was nestled at the back of Sherlock's throat. Sherlock tipped his head back slightly, cupping the underside of John's cock with his tongue, taking him into his throat. John held him there, glaring down at him. "You've been a mouthy little tosser these last few days, and I'm afraid I've lost my patience with you. I told you to pick a bloody safeword. Pick. One."
Sherlock huffed dramatically. “What, and all that dirt under his fingernails just appeared there on its own? There’s no possible correlation between what’s in that dirt and his death? The nails are ragged; he chews them. Since there’s no external wound, we can certainly not rule out the possibility that whatever killed him was ingested through the soil, nor can we not rule out the possibility that that soil is THIS soil until you pretend to be competent for once and go get the bloody evidence collection kits, which I see you have forgotten again.” Anderson reddened. “Well don’t rush, we all know that evidence is best collected as slowly as possible following a crime.”
Finally, John exhaled a ragged breath, and his eyes broke rank, darting over his shoulder for the briefest of moments to see if they'd been caught. The woman behind them seemed to have lost interest in them, thankfully. Sherlock watched the movie and smiled, seeing what was coming next as plainly as if it had been written on the screen. He made a ring with his thumb and first two fingers and began working the head of John's cock mercilessly. If he could just get it timed correctly ...
John looked away, back at Steve, suddenly feeling that he was intruding on something private. He was suddenly anxious to leave. Sherlock had hidden this from him deliberately, and this was clearly a place where he felt safe The thought of Sherlock realizing he was being seen like this, with his guard down, made John feel a bit sick. He stood. "I think I need to get moving, anyway."
, was his last thought before he floated away.
Sally looked at her warningly. "Take your time. Look at everybody. Be VERY sure, because getting this wrong would really screw you."
Sherlock checked to see if they were being watched under the guise of leaning over to murmur in John's ear. "Two rows back, there is someone who suspects. She's not certain, though. Can't make anything out." He faced forward again, but felt John bollocks tighten.
A long silence stretched between them and Sherlock held his gaze, raising his eyebrows slightly and waiting for John to catch up.
Molly considered this. Her shivering was finally subsiding, John's body heat easing her rigid muscles into submission. She yawned widely. "I dunno. I'd already come. Can't expect him to quit at that point."
They sat in silence for a few minutes, Sherlock absorbed in his test tubes, occasionally scratching out notes, and Molly and John clutching their cups of coffee. When half of his cup was empty, John frowned at Molly. “You sure that arm is up for work already?”
Mark's broad smile faded as he looked at her outstretched arm. Belatedly, Molly remembered the yellowing fingertip bruises still visible for any pathology nurse to read like a newspaper headline, and swiftly retracted it under the desk.
John was going to die. "Please," he begged. Sherlock crawled up his body again, placing his knee against John's bollocks. John immediately started to rub against him, and Sherlock must have decided he'd been punished enough because he allowed it. He reached down and opened the front of John's trousers and pulled his cock through the slit in his pants so he was finally, mercifully free.
Sherlock startled at being caught, smiling in spite of himself, and they both slipped comfortably into sleep.
After a few minutes, he lost his ability to hold still at all and began thrusting in and out in a steady rhythm. When he dared to open his eyes, the sight of John's eager eyes and swollen lips set a fire at the base of his spine. "I'm going to come down your throat," he growled, pushing faster into John's mouth. Suddenly, John tapped his leg and Sherlock slightly slowed the roll of his hips with a desperate whine but didn't let go of John's skull. "Please, I'm right there."
The thought went straight to his cock and John was too drunk to hide the evidence.
Sherlock smirked. “Oh, it was no trouble.”
,” he crooned, licking a stripe up his ear. “You give stunningly good blow jobs.” He moved down to his neck, stopping to suck another mark, this time over his pulsepoint. “You rim like a fucking porn star.” He rolled on top of Sherlock, scooting down so he was kissing Sherlock’s belly. “So while I completely sympathize with how distracted everyone has been by your
John chuckled. "I definitely considered that option, but figured there was no point."
, get in line."
She opened a cupboard door and pulled out a tumbler, then dropped a couple of ice cubes in it. She dug a dusty bottle of whisky from the back of a cupboard and poured herself a generous measure. Carrying the glass and the bottle into the living room, she sat down on the sofa where she had been violated. And she remembered.
Sherlock laid the towel on the bed and pushed John on top of it. He stood there for a moment, admiring John's gorgeous, relaxed body spread out on the bed like the best buffet ever. He rifled through John's bedside stand and emerged with a bottle of cocoa butter. "This is grim, John. You didn't even bother with real lube?"
It had to be now.
John felt sick. Was he sick? Was he going to throw up? He performed an internal full body scan, desperate to find a logical, medical answer for the way his stomach had seemingly swapped places with his head. He had surmised that no, he wasn’t ill, but the way Mycroft was watching him without an ounce of self-control, without his usual military-like regulations made him question his diagnosis. He was just stood there, just watching, just, just,
“I’m here…”
“Oh God, yes.”
And as John succumbed to the touch, sinking into the gaps in Sherlock’s soul and setting up shop, he came to the underwhelming, abridged conclusion that
And there was ringing in John’s ears.
But as he found himself spinning, he found the sand beneath his beaten body contorting into concrete before his eyes, into pure London. Sherlock was there, standing just before the dusty mirror, towering over him as he toed the pavement. He was the only thing John could focus on; not the ache, not the trauma, not even the implications such an action held. The world was spinning off its axis, and, with a front row seat to watch the world end, John was set to spectate his own death, and yet Sherlock was all he could see.
understandable. His heart felt as though it was literally breaking, and he couldn't look at John for fear that the lump in his throat would turn into actual, humiliating sobbing, but it was understandable. It had been glaring obvious from the start but he'd allowed feelings to blind him, to trick him into thinking John could maintain this withhim.
A note on UK vs US use of muscle relaxants. In the US, Flexaril is very commonly prescribed for muscle spasms; in the UK, it is tightly controlled because it is considered more potentially addictive and prone to abuse, so it is mostly only prescribed to people with Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, etc. Diazepam (Valium) seems to be the muscle relaxant of choice in the UK, whereas in the US it is more commonly used to treat anxiety and alcohol withdrawl. All of that to say that Sherlock having Flexaril stashed away would be more significant in the UK than in the US, because it's harder to come by.
He didn't seem to need more of an invitation. Pressing in, he teased at first with gentle nips before opening his mouth and running his tongue along Molly's lower lip. She opened for him and felt her blood racing as he dipped inside her mouth. He was a surprisingly good kisser, but within minutes they were sloppy and frantic, and an exhilarating panic tightened Molly's chest as his hands wandered to her breasts.
Confusion was an unfamiliar and wholly unwelcome sensation. Sherlock replayed their foreplay in his mind, closing his eyes to find what he’d missed. John had been eager about sex, had initiated things tonight, in fact. He’d teased and tortured Sherlock into a state of desperation, had crooned at him about how much he loved to watch … him. Specifically,
Sherlock sighed. "She's home safe. I doubt very much she's alright."
Sherlock was
Sherlock flushed again, and his voice was clipped. “Because I always let them choose. No one wants to exchange drugs for being buggered, it seems.” He zipped up and moved to sit up, to flee, but a strong hand on his arm stopped him.
Sherlock chuckled a bit in agreement, and looked up as the bartender approached. "Two shots of Jameson and two Makers, neat."
Molly sighed in defeat and dragged herself through the doorway, locking it behind her. She followed Sally up the two flights of stairs to her flat, getting slower as they approached the door. Sally unlocked it swiftly, opened the door, and looked at Molly, tilting her head toward the door in invitation.
Sherlock groaned above him, thrusting rough strokes into John’s tight, pulsing body as he chased his own climax. “So good,” he groaned, looking down to watch himself fucking into John. “
After many sighs and caresses and names whispered like talismans, John rolled off, reaching into a drawer and then tipping what he needed onto his fingers. He spread himself open, knowing that Sherlock would need to be the one to put them back together again. “Sherlock,” he beckoned, laying back, tilting his hips upward.
