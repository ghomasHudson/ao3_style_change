“You do know, don’t you.  That I…”
Can’t.  Miller’s out on sick leave and I’ve got to cover her patients.  Already have a mountain of paperwork.
Hands came down on his, pinned them to his sides.  He thrashed and tried to lift himself off the bed, but a starburst of fresh pain exploded in his side and he fell back, choking raggedly.
“I wonder who it will be,” Mary murmurs.  Her grey gaze is distant, as if looking ahead, seeing her own death on the horizon.  “I trod on a lot of people to get where I got.  I didn’t care who I left behind broken or… or worse.  I only wanted to get to the top, and now that I’m close…”
you berk.”
John tensed, entwined fingers tightening like a vice around each other.  His face became utterly devoid of emotion.  Fury rose in Sherlock as he scrambled for coherency.
“Sherlock,” John rasps.  “Sherlock,
TW for violence, gore, child endangerment, and character death.
“Do you…”  She pauses, chews on her lip.  “Do you love Sherlock like that?”  She looks at Sherlock.  “Do you love Daddy like that?”
“I don’t see how I’m being so amazing this time,” he says, trying for levity.  “There’s nothing special about Delser Crackers.  You can find them at any Sainsbury’s.”
“John,” he said.  “
“That’s despicable,” he says.
“She’s hungry,” noted Sherlock.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says, his voice a thread of sound.
Sherlock dithers in the sitting room, at once exhausted and possessed by nervous energy.  The image of Catherine pressing the knife to Rosie’s face haunts him, twisting his stomach into knots.  If John’s aim had been even a hair off—if Rosie hadn’t taken the risk and torn free of Catherine’s grip at just the right moment—
1.  The Morcar Museum is named for the Countess of Morcar, who appears in "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle."
And he
“The usual sibling rivalries,” said Sherlock, dismissive.  “Unimportant.  Mycroft?”
The mazikeen interrupted him by detaching her hands from the doorframe and clapping them on Sherlock’s shoulders.  She was several inches shorter than him, and her grip forced him to hunch.  The beery stink of her breath wafted into his face.  “You must be the great Sherlock ‘Olmes!  Pleased to meetcha.”
The figure turned, and John drew up short.  In the short time he had known Alexander Grant, John had never once seen the man distressed.  Now, his face was a bloodless mask of shock.
“Helping you how?”
“You can’t just leave!” Donovan called after them.  “Wait!”
“S’fine.  I understand,” John says.  He reaches across the table and curls his fingers around the knob of Sherlock’s elbow.  “I talked to Rosie.  She’ll be in a mood for a while longer, but she will apologize later.”  Then, gently, “She doesn’t hate you.”
Anderson’s gaze snapped to John as if just registering his presence.  His countenance chilled to the disdain Sherlock had once known so well.
Sherlock looks up from the corpse of Mr. Charles Porter, shopping center security guard and closeted sex-addict.  His thoughts cut quickly from
“Go on.”
“Good Lord, John,” he says.  “As if the resemblance wasn’t obvious enough.  Somehow she inherited your finesse with words.”
“…Sherlock?”  He jumped, jarred out of his thoughts by John’s sudden nearness.  He had been so dazed he hadn’t noticed John round the table and come to his side.  “Did you hear me?”
“Just Cathy is fine.”
With a sense of surreality, he said, “Have you seen him?”
“John has no say over my comings and goings,” Sherlock says tersely.
(Rosie and Sherlock).  One line stands empty at the bottom of the list.
John stares at me, his mouth turning into a hesitant smile.  He nods slowly.  “I would like that, too.”
Greg sighs.  “Yes.”
“You did do a bang-up job with that.”
The hand leading Sherlock gives a little squeeze.  “What is it?”
keep our sights on Mary now, and remove her if she… if she becomes a danger to John or Rosamund.  Do you think she presents a threat, John?”
He looks at John, sees the same sadness he’d glimpsed during their dance. His fingers shake as he reaches for his wine glass.  Blackberry and roasted oak smolder down his throat.
Sherlock and the big man were standing on the curb when John caught up.  The consulting detective had one hand outstretched for a cab.
“Well, which one is it?” John prods.  “Stupid or ridiculous?  Choose wisely.  I
“Bit weird,” John says again.  Heaving a yawn, he sinks back into the pillows.  “’Night, Sherlock.”
“I have a contact at the Yard,” says Sherlock.  He wants her to leave – leave and take the plague of memories with her. The longer she stays, the longer they burrow into him, spreading their poison to the marrow of his bones.  “I’ll give him your information.  He can help you.”
The thunder of gunfire reverberated through his ears, and the puppet dropped like a stone.  Sherlock stared, dumbfounded. Then he whirled around to face the window. A bullet hole was punched through the glass, cracks radiating out like a sunburst.  Beyond the window, the room in the building beside Roland-Kerr was dark. Abandoned.
Officers put Woodley in handcuffs and lead him away.  John sways to his feet.  Sherlock reaches out a hand to steady him.
he thought with surprise – and gone.  Worry was etched into the grooves on John’s brow.  “What is it? What’s wrong? Oh, Sherlock, your hands are all cut up…”
“Oh, John,” Mrs. Hudson fretted, “I’m not—”
You never said anything about shutting up.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock.
“And she told you Father Christmas doesn’t exist.”
The drunk sneers and shrugs off Sherlock’s hand.  “What’s it to you, cocksucker?” he bellows.  “Can’t share?”
With the entire market closed off as a crime scene – much to the proprietors’ chagrin – Sherlock finds himself wrong-footed.  Under normal circumstances, such a place would be choked with foot-traffic: tourists seeking the London Holiday Experience, enterprising vendors, and customers searching for artisanal stocking fillers.
Sherlock snorted.  “Napoleon.  How very fitting.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says.  “I was only thinking about…”
“Mmm.  Yes.”  Sherlock propped his crutches against the wall and pulled his coat off its hook.  “I’ll ask Molly to set up a chair beside the autopsy table.”
“I can’t believe Mycroft did something
“Blood,” he said.
This evening, John had ordered in – Chinese, a safe staple, and from one of Sherlock’s favorite restaurants.  One with a tarnished bottom third of the door handle. When the food arrived, he laid it out on the table by the sofa, hoping to tempt Sherlock into sitting, having a bite.  Maybe a bit of a snog.
“No pain there,” Sherlock grits out.  It’s not entirely true – but he needs a moment to compose himself, and he can’t do that with John’s face inches from his own.  Not with that intent, dizzying look.  Wincing, he adds, “My foot hurts like the blazes.”
John presses his lips together and glances from side to side, as if marshaling invisible forces to back what he is about to say.  Lifting his chin, he draws a steady breath and says, “We need to talk about… about what happened.”
Mr. Garrideb sniffed in a superior manner.  “The stone once belonged to a Dutch Count..  Its companions are set in the other five chairs.  Keep her hands off it, will you!  I’ll not have an
“Stop it,” Sherlock snapped.  Mycroft raised his eyebrows but let the subject drop.
it read.
The screaming sounds again, drawing Sherlock’s attention: a commotion not far off, cries and sobs and shouts clamoring over each other in the night air.  Sherlock and John exchange a look and John stands, dusting snow off his knees.  Sherlock follows suit, swaying as moonlit trees and snow spin before his eyes.  When his vision clears, they move toward the cries.
“Done with the two o’clock one, eh?” Mary chuckled.
John.  He nursed that... that hate deep inside for over half of his life."  Cancerous, consuming.
“Must be the heating,” says John.  “Aren’t you cold?”
“You always had a knack for it,” he said, sitting back.  “Fooling poor bastards into trusting you.”
“Oh, sorry, didn’t I say?  Joe Harrison’s flat.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “Among other things.”
“I can’t wait for you to fuck me,” Sherlock gasps.  A pained sound is punched out of John as he thrusts harder, harder.  “Can’t wait until there’s nothing between us and you—you can fuck me so
“Nah.”  Wiggins shook his head, wriggling feebly in John’s hold.  “Nah, they’re too clever for that.  They know everything, these people.  Got eyes everywhere.”
good.”
And then John is leaning close and kissing him – soft, lingering.  A smattering applause and cheers ring from the gusts around them.
Sherlock looked at John, unable to think, unable to resolve the facts that had just come to light.  His mind whirled in a tumult of confusion.  Moriarty had been looking for John.  Moriarty had wanted to take John away.
“John,” Sherlock said.  “Here only a little while ago.  Nattering on about… the baby.  On the way, wanted me to come along.”
John obeys, sighing as the violet-tinted water closes around him. Sherlock shuts off the taps as he leans back and closes his eyes.  His toes tap absently at the drain lever.
John turns away from the open door and considers Sherlock.  Pale morning light seeps through the window and leaches away his color, leaving him cool, sharp-edged.  Spectral.  Sherlock wants to draw him back, wants to stoke the fire between them.
“Here you are, lads,” says Lestrade, plopping two foaming pints down on the table.  John takes his with an appreciative nod; Sherlock scowls, affronted by the banality of Lestrade’s choice.  The DI sits beside a blushing Molly Hooper and raises his pint with a grin.  “Cheers.”
Sherlock nods.
“What things?”
John smiled, let the expression fall away as the weight of weariness draped over him.  Being plainly exhausted was a better excuse than any other he could concoct.  “Not after this week, I don’t think.  Been a long one.  Probably I’ll just… pass out with the baby monitor for a pillow.”
“No talking,” Sherlock mumbles.  “No thinking.  Tired.”
Sherlock looked at Alexander.  “Oh.”
As always, if you see mistakes, please let me know so I can correct them.
“Would you like a cup of tea, Mr. Grant?” Mrs. Hudson said, beaming at Mr. Grant.  If Sherlock hadn’t been speaking with her earlier, he would have suspected her herbal soothers were at play.
“Bloody psychotic,” John said, then winced at his choice of words.  “Urgh.”
“Who?”
“No,” said John.  He watched Rosie slumbering against her mother’s breast, her little chest rising and falling with every breath.  He had never felt this kind of love before.  He had never thought he would hold a new life in his hands, acting as nurturer, protector, and parent all at once.
“I mean it.  Even when you do horrendous things to our kitchen appliances.”
“Better than Oscar Wilde, or that—that other chap.  The mustachioed one.”
Sherlock wakes in a bed that is not his, in a room that is sterile and white. Monitors beep and whirr beside him. An IV stands nearby, dripping steadily into a tube that needles into the crook of his arm.  Everything is muzzy, woolen.
Later, after Ms. Helens has left, John beckons Sherlock to sit in his armchair.  Scooting his own chair forward several inches, John lays his hands upon Sherlock’s knees, thumbs kneading the knobs of bone.  His gaze is distant, his expression the shadow of a thundercloud.
You and your wife.  But then you switched to
He said everything that had to be said.  When the conversation ended, he hung up, shoved his mobile back into his pocket, and stood with a grimace.  Pain smoldered in his side as he stumbled into the kitchen.  Glass rattled in the cupboard.  Whisky sloshed, its scent sharp in his nostrils.  He brought the bottle back to his chair with him.
There is a quality unique to dreams – a languid haze overlaying every detail and action, as sweet and unhurried as honey dripping down the comb.  John wants to reclaim that quality, so he takes his time, ignoring Sherlock’s panting pleas as he bobs his head.  Despite his whining demands, Sherlock keeps still, so John risks prying one hand off his hip to encircle the base of his cock. With spit and precome to smooth the way, John’s hand strokes to make up the lack, and his lazy pace soon has Sherlock begging.
“That’s mine,” he chided.
“Sherlock!” John’s voice rings through the cold air.
“Let me go, you f—”  But the rest of Cotton Bud’s insult is transformed into a shriek as John turns his wrist just-so.  John leans more of his weight on his knee and the shriek peters into a wheeze.
Sherlock stilled as silence stretched between them, broken only by the sound of John’s ragged breathing.  Then, soft but shaking with disbelief, “Why?”
John helps Sherlock settle back into 221B after all the madness with Magnussen passes.  After Sherlock shoots a man for John’s sake, boards a plane to his exile, and returns a scant few minutes later.
John brings his face close to Sherlock’s, and the rest of the world falls away.  “I don’t care about the book.  I care about
he thinks.
Mrs. Hudson turned to Mycroft, who had taken up a post by the front door to watch the scene with wary contempt.  Clasping the handle of her suitcase in both hands, she mustered a brisk tone that wobbled only a little.  “Well, then.  Let’s be off.”
When they part, panting, Sherlock grins.  “I’ll give you a ride, Dr. Watson-Holmes.”
Sherlock decides it’s worth the risk.
John huffs.  He is tired to the marrow of his bones.  Even forming thoughts is a toil.  He sways, leans.  In his muddled mind, it seems perfectly logical to use the nearest available surface. Which happens to be Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Lazy sod,” John grumbled, but he was smiling.
A helpless shrug.  “I don’t know.  He kept his helmet on the whole time.  Who else could it be?”
John may be small, but he’s surprisingly strong, and he levers Sherlock to his feet with a little grunt of effort.  Sherlock stumbles, draping himself over John as they stagger to the loo.
After the bullet – after the tremor, the fucking
“The Queen,” said the woman holding Sherlock, “is not the only one who lacks for a child.”
“Please, John,” he begs.
“Sherlock, we’ve had a terrible week,” says John.  “Let’s just agree on that and… forgive each other, yeah?”
Sherlock takes the chair beside Rosie without comment.  Across from them, Ms. Helens rests her clasped hands on the desk.
“And you might like to know that I didn’t go
“Oh!”  Dimmock drops Sherlock’s hand as though burned.  “Yes, of course, Mr. Watson.  This way.”
Sherlock’s heart hammered against his ribs as a sob threatened to choke him.  “But—but my magnifying—”
Raindrops patter at the window.  The smell of iron fills the air.
a faint, whistling wheeze.
A moment of hesitation.  Then, “Can I come in?”
“Look, mate,” Lestrade begins, suddenly contrite, “you’ve got to give a statement, of course, but…”
John stepped close and winced.  He lifted his hand to the juncture of his jaw and drew it away, palm tacky with drying blood.  Storm-blue eyes swept over Sherlock.  “Are you okay?”
The following hour is spent in this vein:  Rosie proposes a film or a specific song, and Sherlock (who has seen them more times than he cares to admit), recreates the score from memory, spinning the music through bow and strings into the evening air.  After exhausting the soundtracks of
“Pity.”  A hum of consideration.  “Could I have something else, then?”
“Punch me in the face,” said Sherlock.
“No,” said Sherlock.  “But for a fairy, I think you have a bloody good poker face.”
She crossed the scant space between them and hugged John tightly.  John was motionless for a moment, expression blank, but he quickly recovered and leaned into the embrace, arms occupied with Rosie.  Mrs. Hudson drew away and hugged Sherlock next; he stooped and enfolded her in his arms. Extricating himself, he coughed past the itch in his throat.
Rosie says nothing for several seconds.  A shadow of something Sherlock cannot identify slides over her face:  sorrow, confusion, realization.  She hugs the reindeer tightly to her side.
“Do you need anything?” he asks.  “Maybe a cuppa?”
“I appreciate your caution, doctor,” said Mycroft, “but I’ve taken thorough steps to ensure Mr. Everill’s suitability as an ally.  He can be trusted.”
“Where are they.”  Not a question, but a command.
Mary paid the fare, flashed a sweet smile, and slipped out of the cab and onto the sidewalk.  She skimmed into the tide of people like a fish joining its school – visible for an instant, vanished into the throng in another.
John ignores the gesture and climbs into the back without help.  Settling in beside Sherlock, he surveys the paramedics and EMTs with a dark look.  “Well, what the fuck are you waiting for?”
The thought needles pain into his heart.  His elation wanes, just for an instant.  His smile falters.
Thank you so much for reading Mr. Psychopath.  If you commented, left kudos, or simply read when you had the time - thank you.  Mr. Psychopath is my first completed Sherlock fan fiction and, though it is a dark, dense story, I'm very proud of it.
“I do hate repeating myself, Inspector.  Get on with it.”
2.  Sherlock has a crippling military kink.
“For God’s sake,” he muttered to himself.  He slammed the door shut and stalked back into the sitting room.
“Has he been,” John said carefully, “I dunno, asking questions?”
Rosie’s expression darkens from curiosity to fury in an instant.
Mary set her jaw and tapped out a curt response:
“Yes, ta,” said John tersely.  Guilt nudged at him, but it was gouged up by the claws of pain taking over his side.  His doctor had also decided to lower his morphine dose, and while John’s medical mind appreciated the sense in that, the base, animal side of him wanted to hunker down in a dark place, hide away from the pain.  “I’ve been shot before, actually.  I know how this works.”
Just before the counterfeiter’s goons dump him into the Thames, hands and feet bound, Sherlock has the presence of mind to think,
“Thank you, Mr. Curry,” Molly sniped back.
“I can see you, you know,” she said, her voice barely louder than a sigh.  “Come here. If I am going to tell this story, I would prefer to tell it only once.”
John tried to speak; his throat swallowed around the tube and fire spread through his chest.  The hands released him and his entire body juddered, unmoored without the anchoring contact.
It’s another hour – an entire, damnable
“You say that,” John replied, “but you just admitted you’d underestimated Mary.  What if you’ve underestimated Craig?”
pawing at a Mazarin piece!”
“What?”
“She doesn’t know enough to be traumatized,” says Sherlock.  Lifting the pillow, he considers his cock – mostly gone soft, but still… “Come back to bed.”
“Don’t you worry!” Mrs. Hudson said.  “I love making tea.  It’s one of my greatest pleasures.”
Second part of the double-update!  The next chapter will come on Saturday, 12/23.
Later, Sherlock will blame himself.
“There hasn’t been a redcap in England in over two-hundred years,” said Harry. “And they aren’t exactly subtle creatures.  If one was wandering around London, it would have been reported.”
John’s mouth worked for a moment, then flattened into a tight line.  He lowered his arm to his side, fingers curling into a fist.  “Right.  Let’s go.”
“No!” Rosie says, more forcefully.  Sherlock turns to fully regard her and sees, to his surprise, that her eyes are brimming with tears.  “No, I can learn!  I promise!”
about him and gave him a wide berth.
“How…”  His voice faded.
“My theory,” said Sherlock, “is that Mary is either testing the boundaries of her love for Rosamund, or she’s… trying to uproot it.  Tear it out, remove the weakness.  Do you understand?”
John clears his throat and forces a smile.  “You said we had a visitor?”
A wince.  “Sore.” A pause.  “You?”
John sleeps, lulled by the steady tempo of Sherlock’s heartbeat at his ear.
Sherlock purses his lips.  “If you’d done as I suggested and left the clinic, you wouldn’t be so ornery.”
After veritable eons (which John later insists was only a total of four hours), the last well-wishers totter out, faces ruddy from drinking.  The staff moves in to begin cleaning.  Lights are switched on, dispelling the dusky romance with their buttery glow.
John phones Lestrade, adamant that the Yard investigate the crime scene immediately.  He is also adamant that Sherlock not be a part of said investigation.
“Sherlock.”  John’s voice is strained over the line.  “Look, I’m sorry, but I need a favor.”
Sherlock’s mobile pinged out a text alert.  Thankful for the reprieve, he glanced at the screen.
John shifts from foot to foot, a flush creeping over his face.  “And your cock—your cock is constantly being
“Ye-es,” drawled Sherlock.  “It’s a message for me.  And whoever sent that message is far more interesting than your little government trifles.”
“Right,” Sherlock breathes.  Feather-light, John places his fingers on Sherlock’s brow and shines the penlight in each eye.  Halos sear into his vision.
A quavering wail answers their arrival, and Sherlock feels more than sees John tense beside him.  Seconds pass, and his eyes adjust to the gloom.  They are standing in an empty room, wide with a high ceiling.  Everything is the dark gray of granite, and a musty scent is thick in the air, clogging in Sherlock’s lungs like grit.  A pair of figures stand on the far end of the room, one grown and one a child.
“I’m a man of many surprises,” Sherlock drawls.  He sets the crackers on the nightstand beside the bottle of ginger ale and sits on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock grins, his teeth a flash of white in the gloom.  “I’m no night owl.”
“Who’s Toby?” he demanded.  Between Alexander and Craig, John felt he had seen enough of Sherlock’s new friends for the day.
Sherlock scowls but privately agrees with John.  His headaches and balance may be improving, but an instinct he never knew he possessed curbs his every movement, wary of harming his precious brain.  Now isn’t the time to be risking bodily harm.
“Ugh,” Sherlock groaned, “stop.  Please.  I’m begging you.”
“You madman,” John says.  “Do you really—?”
“I would not!” Rosie protests.
“Let her go,” John snarls.
His hands were steady as he tore strips of cloth and tied tourniquets.  It felt more like a ritual than medical care.  With each knot tied, the bleeding was stemmed and the life choked off from the limb.  Killing Mycroft in pieces.
“She doesn’t even mention Nathan Garrideb,” said Sherlock.  He refolded the letter and slipped it into his coat pocket.  “He wasn’t taken for ransom.  Why else would they want him?”  His voice dropped to the low, rapid-fire stream of consciousness that always reminded John of a hound on the scent.  “She hired a hacker to steal Effie Grant’s trust fund money and used it to fund her operations.  That much is obvious.  But if she had to send someone here to collect Garrideb without simply killing him, that implies he has something she wants.  The same thing Sylvius and Sala wanted, but what?”
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
“Noted,” Alexander said, voice tight.
“Yes,” Rosie says eagerly.
“Now, wait a minute—”
Resting Rosie’s weight in one arm, John rubbed his brow with one hand.  He wanted a drink badly, but he wasn’t fool enough to think he could mind the baby with anything less than his full faculties at hand.
“No,” Mycroft said, “you prefer to let Dr. Watson do that.”  He lifted his umbrella and inspected the pointed end, as if this line of conversation was less interesting than scuffed rubber.  “You can’t trust him.”
The next few hours are spent in a fog:  for all he is fully aware of his surroundings, Sherlock can’t shake the sense that he is wandering about without aim or meaning.  He studies a new set of slides from the morgue, but his mind won’t latch onto the images, won’t process data.  He abandons his experiments to pluck at his violin, but the music won’t come.  His arms are leaden.  His fingers are clumsy.  Placing the violin back in its case, he considers checking his email or John’s blog.  Perhaps there is a new case.
Sherlock chews on his lip, and that’s all the answer John needs.  He sags back into his pillows with a groan. “Sherlock.”
John’s returning gaze was steady and sad.  “Could I get that back?  It’s… it’s very important to me.  It’s my talisman.”
His words fragment into a whimper as John’s lips close over the head of his cock.  John bobs his head, taking Sherlock deeper, engulfing him in
With Woodley and Carruthers behind bars, the rest of the case unravels in short order.
“Greg,” says John.
Sherlock felt Mycroft’s gaze flick over him, cataloguing every miniscule detail.  The words he spoke were a proclamation, but fear clung in them like grime in the tracks of a boot.  “You’re unharmed.”
“Sherlock?” John called, surprising him.  “You can come in, now.  Lucy says it’s all right.”
“Turn yourself in,” John shouts.  “It only gets worse for you from here, Oldacre!”
“Good.  That’s good.”  John is silent for a moment, rubbing Sherlock’s stomach, fingertips trailing to the waistband of the sweatpants, skirting back.  Sherlock’s nerves are tingling.
It’s always been that way, as far as he can recall – a restlessness prickling at the back of his mind like an unformed shiver.  A sense of impending urgency that never fails to catch him at the threshold of calm and drag him back with raking claws.
Rosie bolts upright, castle forgotten.  As she reaches for the box, Sherlock draws it back, his expression stern.  “You must be very careful with it.  It’s old and fragile.”
John lowered his newspaper and glared at Sherlock over The Times’ account of the dull business in Birmingham – the one with the stockbrokers.  Sherlock had solved that case in a trice, and the entire nation was going barmy for it.  Luckily, he’d passed the glory off on some promising but browbeaten officer. For him, a famous name would be more hindrance than help.
“I—I don’t,” Sherlock stammered.  Even as he searched for them, groping in the dark corners of his mind, he felt the memories crumble in his fingers.  They were like spun sugar: delicate, lovely.  Breakable.   “I don’t remember anything…”
“So,” says John, “Rosie tells me you’re teaching her to play the violin.”
Sherlock nods with a hum.  “Now, Watson.  What would you like to hear?”
Mary’s mouth twisted, but she made no remark.  She turned the baby back to her breast, holding her close.  “Hush, lovey, hush.  There’s a dear…”  As she clucked and hummed, the baby’s whimpers dwindled into the muffled rhythm of sleep.
Sherlock heaved a sigh of relief.
Hurt flickers through John’s eyes; it’s quickly masked, but Sherlock hates himself for causing it nonetheless.  Mouth twisting, John hesitates.  Nods.  “She’s eight years younger, yeah.”
“I do try.”
“Please, John, you said…”
“Wot—”
“…assist in his endeavors to repurpose the organization,” said Lady Smallwood.  “Mr. Holmes?”
The sofa was not accustomed to two bodies, and certainly not two bodies in an inhuman jumble.  Soon, their position would become dreadfully uncomfortable.
should have a word with him.”
“A hitman and hacker,” Mycroft said.  “Not in the upper echelon of the old organization, but not for lack of skill.  Our sources had him in Berlin, but when it came time to collect, he’d vanished.  We haven’t found a trace of him.”
A spasm twists Ms. Helens’ mouth, swiftly restrained.  “I… I really don’t care for that pet name, if it’s all the same to you, Mr. Holmes.  Just ‘Ms. Helens’ will suffice, or ‘Charlotte,’ if you like.”
“Oh!”  Blinking hard, she rubbed her thumb across John’s knuckles.  “I’m sorry, John, I just… I don’t know, it must be the hormones.  The fact that she’s here, and no longer a part of me…”  She shrugged and chuckled.  “You must think I’m being very silly.”
– before Sherlock finds the wherewithal to open it.  He can’t say what compels him.  Perhaps it’s the plain, unadorned surface of the envelope, blank but for the name
she sent.
John had wanted to
Sherlock had thought himself ready for any obstacle.  In his backpack, he carried a notebook, pens, a magnifying glass, and a sleeve of chocolate digestives.  Redbeard ambled along at his side, pausing every so often to investigate scents and lift a leg to mark clumps of sheep’s fescue.  All around, birds called and insects ticked and whirred in a chorus as steady and mechanical as clockwork.
“Client?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock blinks slowly and shakes his head.  Tries to remember why he thought it was a good idea to drink during a stakeout – something about blending in, he supposes.  The bartender has sharp eyes.  A necessary precaution.  “I’ll be perf… perfeg… I’ll be
The Father Christmas Killer halts and turns.  Under the hideous concealment of his withered, pit-eyed mask, Sherlock feels a gaze as vacant and unfeeling as a corpse’s settle on him.  Then, as though brushing off a fly, the killer raises the bat and swings.
He fired off a text to Mycroft:
“Mycroft—”
Sherlock might wonder if he had imagined putting his hand on John’s thigh at all.  But that twitch reassures him.  Makes him bold.  He slides his palm up, little finger worrying at the inseam of John’s trousers.
“…an ambulance!”
“You’ve got everything very neatly wrapped up, haven’t you,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock stares, stupefied, as he attempts to process John’s words.  “What?”
Sherlock is startled into a laugh.  “Oh, John.  I had no idea.”
“This is a fantastic first publisher, you know.  Brilliant that you had the blog ahead of time, that you and Sherlock,” a nod in Sherlock’s direction, “had already drummed up so much press.”
“It’s so simple,” Sherlock said, crooking one long forefinger at his chin.  “Mary was Effie’s mother, so of course she knew the credentials for accessing the trust fund.  With that, it was child’s play for her hacker to break into the account so nobody would trace the thefts back to her.  What would they think, a dead woman stealing from her equally deceased daughter?”
“He could look at you and tell you your whole life story.”
No trouble.  Another time. –SH
“Yeah.”  Winter shuddered.  “Shouldn’t have messed with the microphones.  Although…”  He glanced at Mary with a wan smile.  “You might like to know who he’s moaning about.”
“To your mother,” says Mr. Holmes.  John’s lips thin.  His dark blue eyes dart from Sherlock to the floor and back in an endless loop.  I wish he would just look at me.
Sherlock smothers a groan as Lestrade staggers toward them, Molly hanging off his arm like a kite in a dying breeze.  His bleary gaze moves between the two of them; Sherlock can practically hear the gears turning in his mind, sticky with the gin and tequila he and Molly have been quaffing for the past hour and a half.  “What’re you two up to, then?”
“No, you madman.”  The giggles fade and the quality of John’s smile changes – softens.  It almost seems shy.  “I do plan on sorting out the first thing, though.”
like a hare darting between the safety of its den and the delicious thrill of the garden.
“Oh, hush, you.”  Mrs. Hudson drew to his side and playfully swatted his shoulder.  “It’s not what it seems.”
John – Father?  Dr. Watson? – has aged more noticeably.  The author picture in his latest book is recent, but shot in black in white, it shaves years off his true age.  His hair is all silver now, groomed in a way that seems both stylish and sensible.  He’s dressed in a cardigan that looks both cozy and well-made.  He, too, bears wrinkles that speak of happy years.  A little pang strikes under my ribs, making me feel selfish.  I shouldn’t hold giving me up and having a happy life against him.
“I can share, you know,” said John.  “I’m very considerate that way.”
“Well, don’t,” Sherlock spits.  “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
A thought pierces the black mood like an icy spear.  John is not prepared to deal with this, not in the new roles they’ve assumed.  Not on a
“Sherlock?”
“Happy anniversary, John,” he mumbles.  He can feel sleep closing in, creeping into the periphery of his thoughts.
He looks up again, meeting John’s eye, and the naked vulnerability in that glance freezes him in place.  His mind clamors for excuses to feed to Mary – all feeble – and before he can question his sanity, he is shrugging off the coat and restoring it to its hook.
“Um.  Couple of months.”  John hesitated, then offered, “Her name is Rosie.”
he couldn’t keep track of them all.  “It would not be… safe for you.”
“She didn’t, Sherlock.  It was a nightmare!”
“Ms. Ferrier,” said Sherlock, “I’m not saying I won’t take your case, but why not go to the police?  They’re a sorry lot, but they’re just as equipped to deal with a stalker as I am.”
“The male presents a pebble to his lady love as part of courtship,” the narrator continues.  “If she accepts him, they will add the pebble to their nest, and the two are mated for life.”
They break apart, their breathing ragged in the quiet air.  Sherlock rubs one of John’s cheekbones, memorizing the shape and feel of him.  John’s skin is soft and smooth under the pad of his thumb.  He wraps the sensation with great care and stores it in a safe, secret part of his Mind Palace.
“John, it’s become clear to me that your priorities need to be altered.  You could have fucked me tonight.”  A thought occurs to him.  “You still could.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened.  In the tepid light of dusk, they were a startling shade of gunmetal blue.  John realized he was staring, but the part of him that craved confrontation refused to back down.  Sherlock swallowed and looked away, making room on the seat.  John slid in beside him.
“Oh!”  Seb looks from the candle on the table to Sherlock and John’s clasped hands, a parody of well-bred mortification.  “Of course.
Prying his hands off the shelf, Sherlock lurches toward Father Christmas, thinking to overpower him and escape.  But the killer is swift and strangely graceful despite the bulk of coat and boots.  Stepping back from his clumsy advance, Father Christmas holds up one hand, forefinger raised as if to say,
“Yes,” Sherlock blurts out.  He drags John into a fierce kiss, claiming the protest on his lips before it can take shape.  John kisses him back, twining his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and tilting his head to slant their mouths together.  Moments spin past, heady but brief, before John pulls away.
“Faster, John,” Sherlock begs.
“So,” she says, taking a seat on a sofa across from me, “what did you say your name was?”
John is lucky Sherlock loves him.  He wouldn’t have retained a word of all that moping otherwise.
been wealthy enough to hire tight security.  Getting around his goons had been good sport.
Ms. Helens acquiesces, taking off her grey knit hat and placing it in her lap as she does.  Everything about her is designed to be overlooked, Sherlock notes:  the quiet way she holds herself, the grey coat, navy skirt, and penny loafers.  Even the thick-lensed glasses perched on the end of her pert nose resemble a shield, playing to the moronic fable that spectacles conceal beauty.  Everything about this woman is muted, downplayed.
“Er.”  I blink and nod.  It seems churlish to refuse him after I’ve gone and ambushed them.  “Sure.”
As John took a moment to compose himself, the familiarity of his old bedroom settled over him like a comforting blanket.  He propped Rosie against his shoulder and reached for the wall, muscle memory guiding his hand to the light switch.  Light flooded the room.  Save for the baby cot, little had changed: his bed was made, his nightstand still stood at its side, and the curtains at the window were closed.  It was as if he had only been gone a day, not three months.
“Sherlock!”  John’s voice, just barely discernable above the crowd.
Su Lin flicked a disbelieving look at him.  “You don’t know the general. Or Zhi Zhu.”
“This is too much for him,” Anderson objected.
“What does that mean?” John snapped, unable to restrain himself.
A shudder rolls down his arm and a bead of acid tumbles off the pipette tip to chew into the sitting table.
Now, though.  Now a chance is in sight.  John wants Sherlock; perhaps he can love him.  If Sherlock sets his feet right, he might navigate the path to earn John’s love.
Sherlock had no time to react.  Before he understood what he was seeing, the hand slid quietly up out of the water.  The arm that followed was slender but soft, the wrist slim, fingers delicate – and so Sherlock was caught off-guard by the power in the clammy grip that encircled his wrist.  He opened his mouth to scream and the hand
“There,” Sherlock says, and he tears out of the foliage.  Out on the banks of the Serpentine, Stadtler and his unknown colleague jump at the sound of Sherlock’s shout.  The unknown colleague flees and Sherlock bolts after him.
If the mazikeen couldn’t be entertaining, he might as well be useful.
John coughs past the lump in his throat.  “Sherlock, I—I’m glad you’re…”
“Never used to hurt like this.  When I couldn’t solve a case, I was… angry because I’d been bested, but never…”
His concussed head.
phone security!”
“Er, yeah.  Seattle for a while, then San Francisco.”  I shift in the armchair, feeling upholstery creak beneath me.
Or, rather, failed to look at it.
Rosie, and…
“Have you solved it?” John asks.  His fingers climb the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt, brush the collar of the suit jacket.  “God, I love you in this.  You know that?  Gorgeous.”
“Wait,” John hisses.  “Wait, Sherlock, I think I hear—”
“I apologize if murder by candy cane isn’t interesting enough for you,” he says briskly.  “If you have a more interesting crime to attend to, I can probably manage without you.”
The strength and command in those hands sends a shiver down Sherlock’s spine.)
“Oh, Sherlock,” he says.  “Oh, love. I’m sorry.”
Later that evening, John returns from a shift at the clinic, oblivious to the newly-pebbled nest he is about to find.  Sherlock, busy at the hob, glances over his shoulder when he hears the front door close.  “Kitchen.”
What had John endured that was so horrible he would seek out a rope, a strong branch?  Why had he been stolen away in the first place?  Why was Moriarty – and, by proxy, his enigmatic mother – so keen on recapturing him?
Sherlock said nothing.  John pressed on.  “You’ve saved me time and time again.  Christ, even when we first met, you saved me.  Did you know that?  You must have known that.”
This should go without saying, but this is a work of fiction and the things characters do should not be taken as a blueprint for real-life interactions.  If your significant other (or, frankly, anybody) hits you, you should report them to the proper authorities and get to work cutting this person out of your life.
Sherlock appeared not to hear him; his eyes were tracking across the tower windows.  Most of the windows were cracked and patched with paper or cardboard.  The unscathed remainders were covered in grime.
An sea of scarlet spread across the floor.  Moonlight poured in from the window – broken, cracks spidering across the glass – and washed the blood to black.
“Mycroft is a meddling arse,” Sherlock said.
“Please, John.  Put your nightmare snake in me.”
John puffs up a little, and Sherlock’s heart stutters.  It is wonderful to see him like this: filled with pride, intoxicated by the potency of his own success.  John wears confidence like a finely-tailored suit, but so often he is relegated to the wings of Sherlock’s stage.  He never complains, never competes.  Even now, he is stealing a moment in the spotlight from the case.  Sherlock wishes he could give John more.
“How…”  His voice abandoned him.  He looked at John.
“That’s just it,” John croaked.  Tears tracked down his cheeks and dampened his hand.  “I c-can’t… can’t be her father anymore, Sherlock.  I’ve given Rosie up for adoption.”
Donovan snorts.  “I know
Sherlock turns his head and kisses John just above the ear.  His hair is damp and tastes of salt.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
”  Sherlock faltered for a moment as his eyes quested over the sheet.
“Shut up,” John grouses.  “I’m perfectly fine.  Call Lestrade, see if he’s got anything on.  I’m ready for a case.  Absolutely in the pink of health.”
John’s voice echoes in his mind like a signal flare of inspiration.
“Is exactly what happened,” said Greg firmly.  “I had the best of my forensics team work that scene.  Anderson was quite clear that James Winter shot Mary.”
I could say,” he muttered, “but I can’t.  At least not now.  Look, Sherlock, if you can wait an hour or two, I can get a minder—”
The feather touch lifts from his brow.  “You can open your eyes.”
“Then why would she…?”
but resigned to watch over them – and then John’s hand reaches out, clasps his.  Sherlock feels warmth radiating from the touch down to the tips of his toes.  He smiles, and John smiles back.
“Sorry,” she said.  “He can be a right twat.”

) place, charging the atmosphere between them with the humid expectation of lightning before a thunderclap.  It brings to mind the intensity of John’s eyes as he reached for Sherlock under the mistletoe.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock hissed.
and a sigh.  “Have fun in the Highlands.  If you take it into your head to wear a kilt, please get photographic evidence.”
Su Lin’s eyes flashed.  “I am no criminal. I left that life behind.”  The conviction in her tone was belied by her ashen face.  “It’s just that I…”
“Ah.”  His brow knits.  “You do know the
They are.  Taste like sulfurous rubber.
John might have felt halfway cool about the entire incident, if not for the indignant quacking of disturbed ducks assailing his ears.  As it is, he just feels sodden and exhausted.
“Sherlock?”
John laughs and presses a kiss into his hair.  “I should, shouldn’t I.  You are a genius, after all.”
“That’s enough,” John shouts over the din.  His eyes widen when he catches the look on Sherlock’s face.  “Sherlock, don’t—”
At the sound of her voice, Alexander made a choked noise and covered his mouth.  John felt another stab of pity for the big man.
His hands still; the music vanishes in a squeak of strings.  Sherlock blinks rapidly, aware that his eyes had drifted shut.  John stands before him, head cocked, a wary smile curving his mouth.  But for them, the room is empty.

anyway.”
“…shouldn’t be so hasty.”  A man’s voice, gentle but firm.
And I swear to God, James Winter, if you breathe another word about my child, I’ll put a bullet in you.  Don’t think I won’t.  You might be able to hide from Mycroft Holmes, but you can’t hide from us both.”  She flicked her gaze up from the menu, studying him.  “And no more surveillance on my house.  I know you like that sort of thing, but I won’t be your entertainment.”
Sherlock hovers in the doorway, looking lost.  Heartbroken sod.  It’s pathetic, and John is brimming with frustration.  He just wants to be alone.
Thwarted on all sides, Sherlock agrees to leave on the condition that he be allowed to see the body.  Lestrade leads them back to the scene, hastily cordoned off by police tape.  Forensics has taken all the evidence they need and cut Edmund Brown down from his branch.  His corpse lays on a gurney, already stiff with cold.  His skin is fishbelly-pale and his tongue protrudes from between his lips.
“I’m so sorry, John. You know I love you.”
“No,” said Sherlock.  “I just fancy a breath of fresh air.”
and boxing smoldering through his muscles, Sherlock twists his wrists, disarming Peter and snatching his weapon in a single, fluid motion.  His hands, expecting the wooden grain of a baseball bat, almost slip as they grasp smooth plastic.  He fumbles along the heft, finds a button.  Torchlight blooms in the darkness, sweeping its beam in a spiraling path across the ceiling.
Winter’s smile sharpened, making him resemble a feral creature.  For moment, Mary wondered if he was going to attack her in broad daylight on a crowded street.  Then the smile softened.
And then: a thin cry.
“Can’t,” Sherlock choked.  He wanted to leap from the bed and race into the kitchen, to the tile above the kitchen sink.  His last reserves.
“It squeaked.”
something.  But what?”
“John.”  How can something as simple as a name threaten to make his voice tremble?
their fingers.”  John looked at her vacantly and she shrugged.  “Knew that was eating you up inside.”
Stamford returned to the lab hours later with a man in tow.  Pipette in hand, Sherlock stole a glance out of the corner of his eyes.  And fought not to stare.
“Am I hurting you?”
Heading back now.  –SH
Mrs. Hudson’s voice warbled up the stairs.  “Yes, John?”
Mary.
Molly came to visit.  She brought her latest boyfriend along – a small, simpering Irishman by the name of Jim. At Molly’s repeated attempts to start a conversation, Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled his gaze away from the microscope.  He looked at Jim –
Grimacing, Sherlock creaks into motion, pushing himself into a sitting position.  He can feel his pulse drumming through his head like a hammer striking an anvil.  Nausea rises in his throat; he grits his teeth, breathes shallowly through his nose.  It passes.  Arms aching, he searches his coat pockets with a guttering flicker of hope.  His mobile is gone.
Sherlock’s stomach twisted into knots.  “I see.”
“I’ll be off, then.”  Sherlock’s tone was clipped, but not unfriendly.
and tastes salt.  Yearning thumps through his veins, as languid and sweet as sun-warmed honey. He presses his hips forward with a sigh.
“Yeah,” John said.  He couldn’t tear his gaze away from Rosie.
But John is merciless and just shy of drunk, unimpeded by decorum.  “I’d think about getting on my knees for you in the broom cupboard, mostly.  Not a lot of room in there, so your back would be pressed against the shelves while I sucked you off.”
John was quiet for a long moment.  When at last he spoke, his voice was distant and wondering, as if steeped in a dream.  “I don’t remember much.  That’s true. But… I remember finding the magnifying glass.  We’d—… I had been walking through a wood.  The realm of the Tylwyth Teg.  I was searching for…”  Sorrow flickered through his eyes.  “A good tree. A strong branch, a place to stand. I’d stolen a rope.”  He looked at Sherlock, at once in the moment and trapped in a hopeless place in his past.  “I was done.”
as it shuts.  Footsteps again, each louder than the last.  Coming down the corridor.
“I believe your favorite endearment is ‘madman.’”
“Sit down,” says John, nodding at her seat.  “We have to talk about something.”
“I… I did, yes.”
Time drifts past.  Rosie darts to the tree, selects a present to be opened, and shrieks and screeches with endless delight as each one is revealed.  The stuffed reindeer is placed beside the castle, immense beside the little dolls that inhabit it.  The walkie-talkies are crowed over, then crowed
As always, if you see mistakes, please let me know.
If anyone could deliver him from this situation, it was John. “Down here,” he called, trying – failing – to quash the hint of hysteria in his voice. “We have a visitor.”
“John,” he croaks, “John, I—”
Sherlock hums and brushes his fingers over John’s, pushing down the duvet. He’s naked underneath and his muscles are smoldering with a soreness from the night before.  “Well, then.  Help me sort it.”
He fell silent, eyes tracking a flicker of movement.  As it slowed, it resolved into a bright, red dot, dancing down the wall and skittering across the floor.  It skated a straight line toward Sherlock, climbed up his legs, and centered on his chest.
“Oh,” John breathed.
Today 10:34 AM
“Good Lord,” Sherlock mutters.  “This never ends, does it?”
Sherlock keeps walking.
The thought gives Sherlock pause.  Lying on the sofa in 221B, he opens his eyes and skews a look across the room.  John sits in his armchair, pecking diligently at his laptop.  A bandage is affixed to the side of his head, just off the squamous suture.
Sherlock stares into his cup, shamefaced.  “I didn’t mean…”
Mary propped her elbow on the tabletop and rested her chin on the heel of her hand.  “He’s so… blind.  But if he somehow saw the truth, really
Between himself and John.
“Yeah.”  John looked a little abashed.  “Hope you don’t mind.”
Lowering his violin, Sherlock gives in to the hunger clawing at his belly and walks to the table.  The takeaway box contains crisps, a spinach salad, and a wrap stuffed with chicken, bacon, cheese, and veg.  A zing of chili sauce snaps across his tongue with the first crunching bite.
John huffed in exasperation.  “Well, yes, but you can—”
He extends his free hand across the space and I reach forward, compelled by a sense of kinship.  Our hands clasp, and for a moment, I’m joined to the pair of them:  me, John Watson, and Sherlock Holmes.
, Wiggins replied.
The short time it takes for Father Willis to cross the nave, rifle through the votive candles, and leave is an eternity of agony for John.  Sherlock moves closer, pushing John until he is flat against the wall of the confessional.  John’s knees buckle and he leans back to take what little support he can get.  Memories churn and intertwine with the present, insidious weeds grafting together vague guilt and blood-thumping theft and the illicit thrill of being trapped in close quarters with the object of his desire. Affection.
“No, that would be the cocaine withdrawal,” Mycroft said, but he set down plate and fork and, taking his umbrella in hand, rose.  “I had best be off.  Only before I go, Sherlock, I should let you know about the gala.”
is like?”
“Not hungry.”
head.  You need rest, not to go haring off after a serial killer.  And I want to check your ankle – see if you only wrenched it or if it’s actually sprained.”
Alexander shrugged and pursed his lips in a relenting manner.  A stiff breeze rolled past the stoop, blowing away Sherlock’s thoughts with a shiver.  Christ, it was cold.  He yearned to slip back inside, to shut John out and huddle in the musty warmth of the shop.
Above him, the sky was bleak and white, fat with clouds.  One or two snowflakes spun lazily down, heralding a storm.  Sherlock muttered a curse at the space where Mycroft’s car had waited, whirled around, and stomped back into the flat.  The door slammed shut behind him.
Rosie bounds to John’s side, plants a sticky, chocolate-smeared kiss on his cheek, and races back to the box.  Sherlock catches John’s eye with an inquisitive look.
Sherlock’s mouth goes dry.  “Oh?”
John huffs, cheeks pink.  “You are insatiable, you know.  Ridiculous.”
Sebastian smirked.  “He could sense the mongrels, too.”
Mary’s voice calls to him from a dank dockside, river water misting the air and night as black as pitch around them.
“Yes.”  Sherlock’s voice was very small.  “On the way to hospital, when your heart stopped… I didn’t.  Didn’t cope well.  I believe I had to be sedated.”
They continue like that for several minutes, John climbing onto the bed and straddling Sherlock’s hips as deep, lazy kisses stoke the embers of need into a hungry flame.  John is unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt when the ring of a mobile phone interrupts them with shrill insistence.  Cursing, Sherlock digs his mobile out of his pocket and glances at the screen. Lestrade.
“What’s that?”
“Hello, gorgeous,” John murmurs as he slips close, not quite touching
“Take her to Baker Street,” said Sherlock.  “Leave her with Mrs. Hudson and come to the gala.  Hurry.”
The cleanliness stings, scouring and astringent, like bleach slopped over a floor ridden with dry-rot.  The planks may be clean, but they aren’t fit to stand on.
“I love you, John.”
John bared his teeth in a farce of a smile and marched past Lestrade.
“Honestly,” he mumbles to Sherlock, “I think she got your penchant for drama.”
“We believe he may have a safe haven here,” said Mycroft.  “London may be, as you put it, my territory, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t a few cesspits within it I would be happy to see excised.”
His words are sour with guilt.
“Hang on.”  John tries to hoist himself up and only succeeds in slipping around like a greased pig. His flailing foot catches the shower lever and cold water jets down upon them in an arctic deluge.  Sherlock and John yelp in unison.  John’s hands skitter around the rim of the tub, knocking the last few burning candles into the water, and amidst the splashing and shouting, he cries out, “Ow!  Fuck! My leg!”
useful.  John may be his conductor of light, but he also has an uncanny knack for robbing Sherlock of his senses at most inopportune times.
Grunting, Sherlock disentangles one arm from John and casts about for the nearest article of clothing.  It’s his own button-up, and he gladly sacrifices it for the sake of keeping John in his bed.  With a perfunctory mop-up, he throws the shirt in the general direction of the hamper.
Sherlock looks flustered.  “That is… high praise, coming from you.”
McFarlane sighs.  "She's... a little shaken up.  I think she thought she was rid of him for good.  But!"  He injects a forced dose of levity into his tone.  "Bastard's behind bars now, so I suppose we're all rid of him."
Sherlock takes a sip of tea, licks his lips and savors the sweetness of it.  “I will
“These haven’t all been sent,” Sherlock noted.  “Only the Peckham address and,” his finger moved down the list, “this delivery in Marylebone.  That one was sent a week ago.”
– Sherlock and John returned to Baker Street.
“You should stay here,” piped up one of Eirene’s retinue – a wisp of a girl with skin the blue of a summer sky.  “Stay here forever and play with us.”
“You heard me.  Hard as you can.  I won’t break, I swear.”  His hand leaves Sherlock’s arse to palm his own prick, still clothed but valiantly tenting his trousers.  With a little gasp hissing between his teeth, he says, “Yeah?”
John looked at Sherlock.  “Lucy’s coat.”
Sherlock draws his bow along the strings, coaxing out the sweet, languid notes of
Thoughts spinning, John fell into a fitful doze.  His half-slumbering nightmares of Mary stealing Rosie, riding away on a boat as black waters churned and frothed around them.  John tried to swim toward them, but the water was icy and the current strong, submerging him, filling his mouth and lungs.  Every time he broke the surface, gasping, Mary and his child were farther away.
His Nibs and John have only been at the crime scene for ten minutes and already Greg regrets inviting them.
I’m really not.  I was making a joke.  That’s all.
His words break off in a moan as John pulls down the waistband and closes his hand around Sherlock’s cock.  He jumps, hips arching, and John drops his free hand to his waist, pushing him down. “Don’t move, yeah?  I haven’t done this in a while.”
Mary had changed all that.  With easy smiles and infinite patience, she weathered John’s dark moods.  Her light had pierced the fog, giving John a glimpse of the sun.  A fainter, cooler sun, certainly, but a steady one.  Not a light that would burn itself out with sheer brilliance.
But for all his rationale, Sherlock couldn’t find the will to delete the sound.  He let it slip from his hands and tumble back into the cardboard box, spared for the time being.
He finds John in the kitchen, standing over the hob while Rosie tweaks the dials of Sherlock’s microscope at the kitchen table.  John holds a frying pan by the handle and wields a whisk as if to decimate a foe.  The air is thick with the scent of frying eggs and sausage and a medley of sizzling, popping grease.
Later, Sherlock will reflect on variables in experiments.  The prairie vole is far from an endangered species, so presumably their mating habits are successful.  Clearly the blame lies at Sherlock’s feet.  If prairie voles had to contend with baths and candle flames, they would probably be extinct.
“No,” says John, “and it isn’t your fault, either.  But I still feel guilty.  I still feel like… I dunno, like I could have done something differently.  Saved her somehow.  If I’d only been quicker, or, or cleverer, or—more like you.”
“I didn’t expect your father,” says Sherlock.
Experience won out in the end.  In minutes, Sherlock had the saline simmering on a hot plate.  Anticipation bubbled in his veins as he retrieved the bowl and tipped it over the heated beaker.  A stream of white powder fanned out – pure pleasure in chemical form.  Seconds passed as the particles danced in the bubbles, and then they dissolved.  Sherlock shut off the hot plate and put the beaker on the countertop to cool.
“Oh, hush, you,” John says, extricating his hand from Sherlock’s to swat his thigh.  “’Mistreatment’ my arse.  My books sell quite well, thank you.”
For all their caution – despite the shower and the tea and John turning up the heat in the flat a generous few degrees – Sherlock goes to bed that night with an itch in the back of his throat and wakes with what appears to be the plague.
Sherlock descended the stairwell as though he had been the one called.  Toby stood still for a few moments, surveying the assembled humans with a dubious stare.  Then he huffed and slowly began padding down the stairs.
“You could also use your position as a doctor to get a quick STI test,” Sherlock says, mimicking the seductive tone.  “And to get the results as soon as possible.  Then we can dispense with your ridiculous safety precautions.”
He presses ‘send’ before he can rethink it; now is not a time to be choosy with cases.  Even the dimwitted work the Yarders can solve will do, so long as it distracts him from thoughts of John.
Anderson narrowed his eyes at Harry, but he held his tongue.  Lestrade nodded, taking her point.  “Yeah, I doubt it’s a redcap.  Frankly, I doubt that it’s Fae at all.”
John follows, sweat creeping across the back of his neck.  Footsteps echo off the vaulted ceiling as the intruder walks down the nave.  He has no idea he is not alone.  According to Sherlock’s deductions,
“I saw her before I came up.  She might still be…”
John hesitates, eyes rooted on his daughter.  Seconds pass and, rolling her eyes, Catherine lifts the knife and drags it along Rosie’s cheek.  A fine line of crimson blooms over the skin.  Sherlock’s heart kicks, convulsively, against his ribcage.  The color drains from John’s face and he drops the gun.
“He and that Holmes guy would’ve gotten along swimmingly, then,” Winter scoffed.  “All he does nowadays is shoot up.  It’s a wonder he hasn’t managed to kill himself.”
“I simply can’t,” said Sherlock.  The violin twanged as if in agreement.  “The case I’ve got on is just too big.  Sorry.”
Sherlock and John agreed to meet at the Morcar Museum in a couple of hours, giving John time to attend to Rosamund and Sherlock time to prepare.  Sherlock’s thoughts churned as he unbolted the door to 221 and climbed the seventeen steps to the flat.  He had to put together the perfect outfit… Spencer Hart, or Dolce & Gabbana to soften his bony frame into
“Mary,” said Sherlock, “don’t do this.  Please.”  Then, spinning a half-formed suspicion into speech, “You can’t be the next Moriarty.”
“The last of it.”  Sherlock fumbled one-handed with the bag until the seal split open.  Bracing his hips against the counter, he reached for the tap.  Water burbled.  Sherlock beckoned John closer.  When he obliged, the detective upended the bag and poured its contents down the drain in a powdery stream.  When it was done, he washed out the bag and binned it.
”  All at once, the suspicion clouding his features cleared as comprehension dawned.  “Oh, my God.  She…”
The needle burrowed deeper, lancing and keen in his heart.  “I’ve got to go.  Thank you again, really.  It’s been a huge help.  And thank Greg for me too.”
“It’s fine,” says John, a bit gruffly.
Quickly.  Try to recall whatever you can before the memories are lost.”
It’s the simplicity of it that makes Sherlock’s breath catch – the way John says
“You’re forty-six.”  Sherlock has a copy of John’s birth certificate hanging behind glass in his Mind Palace.  Sometimes, he’s tempted to phone the hospital where John was born and see if they have more exact records – the hour, the minute, the second.  It’s a long shot, but if they
“I’m only contacting you because I know you two will come after me,” Mary interjected.  “I’m not interested in a chase.  This has to end now, Sherlock.  I owe you for crippling what could have been
“I know it’s shocking, being shown up by actual police,” says Donovan.  Her smile falters.  “Now, seriously, clear out.  We’ll handle Drebber and Stangerson.  You don’t look like you’d be of much use to anybody right now.”
snap his bow in half.)
No, Sherlock resolves, he will stick with the pebble concept.  It’s the least likely option to send him to prison.
John opened his mouth to speak and closed it with a
“Doc…tor.”  His voice was a rattle of dry sticks in a breeze.  “Watson.”
“He’s not here,” Rosie says, as if that solves everything.  She lifts a piece of toast and takes a messy bite, scattering crumbs.
“My brother…”
“I’ve got to take this to the parking garage,” said Mrs. Hudson.  “Can you manage the stairs on your own?”
Rosie nods, and Sherlock sees a glimmer of John in the set of her chin, the squaring of her shoulders.  He wants to wrap one arm around John and the other around Rosie, gather them close, keep them safe.  The bustle of Yard officers around them suddenly feels oppressive.  Sherlock wants to get out of this warehouse, to flee the musty air and the mess of Catherine’s impaled corpse.  He wants to go back to Baker Street.
I'm sorry that this chapter is so recap-heavy.  Later chapters will diverge more from BBC Sherlock canon.
Mouth dry, he says, “John?”
John hesitated.  “In here.”
Sherlock anchors himself to the pressure of their joined hands. “Nothing.”
Sherlock wants to argue, but he’s exhausted, and the soup is warm against his palms.  He eats another spoonful and nods.
A hum.  “Yes.”
God I’m so bored. Nothing today but paperwork and head colds.
For an instant, Sherlock is too stunned to react.  He’s too stunned to
“Sad?”
John’s voice was a plea.  “Please stop. I don’t want to talk about it. Not… not yet, anyway.”
His subsequent visits had been because he liked it.
– Sherlock had to infuse it with emotion.  With
Mary Morstan – the Mary of the past, of sweetness and patience and light – did not exist.  She was an illusion.  She had been created to lure John into—what?  Complacency, marriage?  What would a former assassin want with
As he barrels through the foyer and toward the door, Sherlock is waylaid by Mrs. Hudson.  “Ooh, Sherlock, dear, could you spare a moment?”
The tremor returns instantly, accompanied by a hum and—oh, oh, it
“Done,” said Mary.  “He’s alive, but if you want him to stay that way, you’ll listen to me.  I’m sure you can figure out where I am – be here by dusk, or I’m gone, and I’ll kill your precious big brother as incentive to leave me alone.  Same goes if you bring the police.  You and John will come alone.  Understand?”
John doesn’t seem to notice.  Kissing Sherlock’s neck, he says, “Right.  I can work with that.”
“The publisher wanted me to tidy up your deduction explanations,” John says. He sets down his fork and shoots Sherlock an apologetic look.  “I’m sorry. I should have mentioned that earlier.”
by probably the world’s cleverest man.  Is he being sarcastic?  “More or less.”
“What did you write?” Rosie asks when the pencil stops.
In the meantime, Sherlock and John turned their attention to the address furthest afield.  A wealthy, retired couple in Bray had purchased a chair for their personal collection.  John very practically suggested they phone to save time, but it was all for naught; the moment Ms. Stock answered the phone, Sherlock knew he would have to go and see the chair himself.
“You came to tell us about your brother,” Sherlock surmises.
Sherlock fidgeted, dropping his gaze to his clasped hands.  “No reason.  I’ll just—I’ll just go, now.”
Sherlock stares down at the pale expanse of his own skin, the knob of bone and mounds of muscle tucked beneath.  It’s his shoulder.  It’s only his (
John pauses on a deep thrust to brace on one arm while the other snakes under Sherlock’s thigh, pulling it up until his heel rests on the small of John’s back.  His next thrust glances over Sherlock’s prostate, startling a cry from him.  John leans over, his stomach grazing the tip of Sherlock’s cock, and smears his mouth over Sherlock’s heaving chest, over his heart.
“Deadly.”
Ms. Carvel’s lip curls.  “We phoned her father to come.”
Sherlock swallowed his protest and nodded.  “John.”
“Ms. Helens,” Rosie mumbles.  Sherlock and Lestrade glance at her and she burrows into John’s embrace, hiding her face in the bulk of his jacket.  The name niggles at Sherlock, and then he remembers: light brown hair, thick glasses, guileless eyes.  Rosie’s teacher, Charlotte Helens.
Startled, John turned to face her.  Mary slipped forward, eyes sparkling.  “I know it’s been a while, and it’s good that we’ve been careful, but I really do feel back in shape.”  She smirked.  “I know, I know – I’m rusty in the romance department.  But I figure when we’ve got an hour on the outside,” she flicked her eyes down to the cot, “
“No.”  Rosie lifts her face.  She and Samantha’s eyes meet, hold.  After a moment of silence, Samantha looks down at her feet.  Rosie turns back to Ms. Helens.  “I’m not sorry.”
“Right,” I mutter.  “Get a grip.”
skilled with his tongue.”
There is a commotion, a shout, and a cry of relief.  Bradstreet’s voice.  “Found it!”
“Same as the redcap,” Harry said tartly.  “Haven’t been in the country in centuries.”
“How are you feeling?”
“Sherlock…”
John’s smile wilted.  Sherlock knew he was remembering the days before the Fall, when Mycroft had traded Sherlock’s secrets for Moriarty’s.  Granted, the whole incident had been orchestrated by Sherlock and Mycroft, but Sherlock doubted John saw it so simply.  John was a soldier – even to a victorious end, he would never betray a comrade.
Sherlock nods, more to reassure him than out of any true certainty.  John’s mouth pulls down at the corners, but he only says, “Can I kiss you?”
“Yes.”  Sherlock can’t believe John actually wants him – that he hasn’t come to his senses and run away screaming.  Sherlock will wait as long as John bids if it means John won’t leave.
Sherlock exhales deeply and opens his eyes.  A smile tugs at his lips.  “Oh. John.”
Sherlock’s throat bobbed and he nodded, stepping aside so John could pass.  John’s hands were steady as he cocked his gun and pushed the door open.
The fairies clapped and cheered as their blue-skinned sister stood and sidled up to Sherlock.  Sitting beside him, she threaded her fingers through his hair and crooned.
“What?”
but he was no longer the man intent on limping out of his own life.
John brushed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth with a kiss as his fingers plucked at the drawstring of Sherlock’s sweatpants. The knot unwound and John shoved the sweatpants down, rising on his knees so Sherlock could kick them off.  Licking his lips, John looked his fill.  Sherlock’s cock was flushed and stiff against the hollow of his belly.  His hipbones jutted out, casting shadows on the moonlit expanse of skin.
“Oi!”  Piggy shouts, slashing his blade through the air.  “I’m the one in charge here!”
He stalks toward the bustling bar, heralded by Molly’s indignant cry.  “It’s Greg, you pissflap!  Wait, Sherlock—wait!”
“I wanted him to be her godfather,” said John.
“O-o-okay,” Peter says, and lets himself be led out of the Winter Palace.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
The silence that followed yawned wide, filled by a language Sherlock could not see.  He was tempted to look beyond the doorway, but to do so would put him directly in Lucy or John’s line of sight, and then John’s questioning would end.
The man – short and tanned with bruises of sleepless nights under his eyes – was clearly an army doctor, clearly sporting a psychosomatic limp.  The flat stare he directed around the room spoke of detachment, a farce of attention.  Mentally limping out of his own life.
As if sensing Sherlock’s scrutiny, John turned and met his gaze.  Sherlock saw the spark that had lit John’s eyes hours ago.
“Couldn’t have done it without you,” Lestrade tells Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson’s smile doesn’t waver.  “Oh, Sherlock.  We know each other too well for all that nonsense, don’t we?  You’ve lived here over ten years.  I should think I deserve a little more honesty than that, yes?”
“Mycroft also has eyes everywhere,” Sherlock persisted.  “He may not have found them yet, but he will.  It’s only a matter of outlasting them.”
“But you…”  John’s voice cracked; he swallowed past unshed tears.  “You see now.”
“This from a self-proclaimed sociopath?  That’s cute, Sherlock.”  A second metallic snap cut through her words.  “Now, I’m really sorry, but I’ve got to get going.  Work.”
Sherlock rang off, sent a text, and returned to his contact list to find another number.  Heart hammering, he put the call through.  A contact photo filled the screen:  a sweet, smiling face.
If you see any mistakes, please let me know so I can correct them.  :)
John chews on his lip.  “Bit obvious, but yes.  Don’t think you’ll need an interpretation for that.”
“There’s nothing here, John!” Sherlock exclaimed.  “There was a compartment in the leg of Sylvius’—”
Left to his own devices for the day, Sherlock does something previously unheard of:  he ignores a perfectly good case, his thoughts tangled up in memories of John.  John, eyes clamped shut as they move together with the flawless fulfilment of a violin bow meeting the strings.  John, groaning as his hips drive forward, plunging his cock between Sherlock’s thighs.  John, fingers tweaking Sherlock’s nipple, coaxing the flames curling low in Sherlock’s belly to a roaring conflagration.
But no matter how Sherlock bent his mind to the case, he could not tease apart the threads of detail and isolate a single strand of truth.    All the evidence pointed to McFarlane’s guilt.  Sherlock felt himself caught in the inescapable pull of his own certainty, one that dragged him past cold facts and pure data, past a boundary horizon and into a realm where belief alone ruled.  He knew McFarlane was innocent, and he could not escape.
John.  I won’t go out for anything less than a seven.”
“He tried to take you away.”
“John?”  Mrs. Hudson looked fretful.  “Who is this?”
“And you have a predilection for stressing words like a teenager when you’re sozzled.”
He sinks back into the warm embrace of sleep, lulled by the music of the violin.  When he wakes the next morning, he feels better-rested than he has in a long, long time.
“What’s so special about rowan berries?”
Sherlock might have taken the long fall and the sudden stop, but John thinks he might be drowning.
he thinks glumly.
cases, the intervals between danger nights lengthened.  Sherlock bought better clothes, took care of his appearance.  Made himself a professional: someone with authority.  Someone who deserved respect.
Sherlock said nothing, suspended on an indrawn breath, as if the words had been stolen away as John’s time had been.  “Your memories.  They took your memories away?”
Feeling mutinous, Sherlock finds a knife and sets to work.  He wanted a good shag, not a meal.  The minutes slide by until the oven timer dings and John takes out the asparagus, beaming with pride.  He prepares each plate with a few spears, generous slices of watermelon, and half a chocolate bar.  Then he starts on the oysters.
Sherlock’s mind was numb as he found his wallet and paid the fare.
“I need to check your pupils,” John says.  A smile quirks at his lips; it makes him look boyishly rumpled.  “Keep your eyes open, yeah?”
“Oh, I suppose,” says John.  “Rather be having fun with you, though.”
letting you go on your own.”
He is pulled from the muddle between sleep and waking by the sound of the front door opening.  John’s voice rushes in to fill the space.  “Sherlock?  You in here?”
She sped off with a rev of the engine and a squeal of wheels.  Standing on the curb, John watched the Aston Martin vanish around a corner with a suspicion that he had fallen through the looking glass.
John sets his jaw and speaks with wincing, rapid-fire determination.  “It’s a tradition, the bay leaves.  From the 1700s.  A woman would pin bay leaves to her pillow before going to sleep.”  He reaches out, picking up each corner leaf and dropping it into a pile.  He brushes the last one against Sherlock’s nose – an attempt at levity – before consigning it with the rest.  “When she slept, she would…”  He falters. Soldiers on.  “She would dream of her future husband.”
If Sherlock imagines a flicker of hurt in John’s eyes, it is quickly steamrolled by the momentum of his own anger.  “Good!  Then I won’t have to spend every waking moment with an insufferable wankstain like you!”
John barely registered her words.  His mind was trapped on a loop with two images, veering and circling around and around like a jammed carousel roundabout.  Rosie, slumbering and oblivious as the muzzle of Mary’s gun kissed her temple.  Sherlock lying on the hangar floor, curled around his injury.
“She would have gone to prison for the rest of her life,” said Molly.  “If that madman Winter hadn’t shot her, that is.”
A thick, heavy blanket of exhaustion settled over John.  They had been running around all day and the emotional turmoil of the evening had taken its toll.  His eyelids drooped with the promise of rest.
Affecting a disgruntled sigh, Sherlock humors him.  He can think of only one thing, one person.  One thin mouth, pliable yet stern.  One pair of hands, mending and guarding and coaxing in their turn.  One set of eyes, steady and keen and shining with hard-won mirth.
The vault company and the Met, however, suspected Craig.  A freelance hacker who tested security systems by attempting to break into them, Craig had been perfectly primed to slip through the vault’s defenses.  He also had motive, as the company had hired him only to purposefully bungle the payment terms and give him a fraction of his quote.  Everyone but Sherlock suspected Craig.
“What?” Sherlock manages, strangled.
“Didn’t do that,” John mumbled.  “Alexander got him.”
“Molly adores me.”
Sherlock’s face flames and he stares at his shoes.  He is surprised to hear himself admit, “I don’t know
Then he looked back to Sherlock and said, “The Fair Folk.”
John could not fathom her reasons, but he knew one thing:  the true Mary was the Mary he had seen that night at Baker Street – a reptilian creature, poised to strike.  She was the cold, dead eyes and the sharp teeth.  She was inhuman.
Sherlock smiles.  His eyes skate past John to Lestrade, Bradstreet, and the others.  They wander to a pool of light painting the wall beside the open door and halt.  His smile slips.  Words have been etched into the frost, like a child’s scrawl on a rain-fogged window.
and spinning them into the haze of chatter, laughing, and tinkling wine glasses.  John and Mrs. Hudson have gone all-out for this year’s Christmas party.  Sherlock would much rather be cloistered away in his bedroom while Mrs. Hudson drinks too much sherry and Lestrade and Molly are less-than-discreet making merry, but something compels him to stay.
Sherlock thinks,
Shouts fill the corridor.  Firefighters race up the stairs, masks obscuring their faces.  John points toward Oldacre’s prone form without a word and drags Sherlock down the stairs, his strength brooking no argument.  Each step groans and threatens to break beneath them.  The ceiling creaks, buckles.  Sherlock can see nothing for the smoke.  He lets himself be led, stumbling after John.
John frowned.  “Think you’ll be all right moving about?”
Sherlock’s absence in the hospital room was a fine reward for John’s trust.  The memory came back like a surge of bile – sour, foreboding.  He glanced at Mary.  The exhaustion in her eyes was tempered by a knowing gleam.
“You are.”  Sherlock scowls in mock reproach.  “You can’t fool me, John Watson.  I’m the world’s only consulting detective.”
Lestrade’s shout was explosive.  “For fuck’s sake, could you just shut your gob and
Sherlock shakes his head.
Even more surprising had been the realization that he enjoyed it – really, truly enjoyed it.  The science was nowhere near as specific as he would have liked, but it was enough for anyone with more than a passing interest to learn from.  He had even been
Sentimentality aside, Sherlock secretly hopes if he gives John a truly spectacular orgasm, he’ll be so high on oxytocin and vasopressin that marriage will seem perfectly reasonable.
And then, quite unexpectedly, Sherlock’s search for John’s gift casts a wider net than intended.  For Molly, he buys a pink jumper with an embroidered cat on the front.  Lestrade gets a matching jumper with a dog.  In a sweetshop, he finds a box of chocolate and caramel goldfish for Mycroft.  A low blow, perhaps, but it will inform his brother that Sherlock is perfectly aware of the barrister he’s been carrying on with.  Lastly – and only a little grudgingly – he buys mugs for Anderson and Donovan.  Anderson’s is plain on the outside but says
“I had a nightmare,” she later reported.  “I was dancing and I couldn’t stop.”
“Can you sit?” John asks, gently, and Sherlock half-slumps, half-falls on his arse in the muck, knees drawn up, feet braced against the cinderblocks.  The skin of his ankles is red and chafed when the cords come away.  John’s eyes are dark.  “Shit.”
Nodding stiffly, he spins on his heel and flees.  Sherlock slides the magnifier shut and casts John a puzzled look.  “So, it’s only acceptable for you and me to giggle at crime scenes?”
Boredom is a destructive experience for Sherlock.  His stagnating mind seeks out the greatest danger, determined to spark back to incendiary life.
“Or both,” said John.
An icy hand gripped John’s heart, squeezing so tight he feared it would burst.  If he failed Sherlock a second time…
Sherlock wasted no time.  He swatted Moriarty’s hand aside and slammed the object into his jaw: half punch, half brand.  The stink of burning flesh filled his nostrils, mixing with the smell of chlorine. Iron.  Whatever John had hidden in his pocket was made of iron.
“Tell me what you want,” said Sherlock.  His eyes were rooted on the stark line of blood.
“John is very tired.”  Sherlock uses the slow, deliberate tone he reserves for infants and imbeciles.  “He has been helping me on this case for four days now, with very little sleep.  If I wake him, his testimony may be compromised by—”
“Oh, nonsense,” says Mrs. Hudson.  “I’ve only lived this long because I keep moving about, you know.  Anyway, enough about that.  How was the train ride?”
The night he returns from the dead, John doesn’t sleep.  Instead, he lies beside Mary, vibrating with unspent fury.
Sherlock squirms.
shout in the flat.”
“Good girl.”
No, no.  Morphine use could be controlled, but cocaine was another beast entirely.  A case was what he needed, a good, tricky case, something he could set his teeth into, something frenzied and fantastic.
The trees broke away to form a clearing.  As Sherlock drew near, he glimpsed a spatter of sunlight on still water.  The fetid stink of pond scum filled the air.  The ticking and whirring of insects was louder here, almost frenzied.  Pushing aside blades of grass, he found himself at the edge of the pond.  He shrugged off his backpack with practiced ease, collected his notebook and pen, and slid it back on as he settled down to wait.
“John.”  A low, strained murmur.
John’s knee left the small of Sherlock’s back.  His hands were rough on Sherlock as he seized his shoulders, turned him, pressed him to the cold floor.  Straddled him in a cruel parody of an embrace.  Sherlock sucked in a breath as the mazikeen’s weight settled on his stomach.  His eyes roved over John’s blank face, down the column of his throat, down his torso.  Something snagged his attention—
“You forget yourself,” said Mary.
“This copy went out before we were told to make cuts,” says John.  “Some of the reviewers didn’t care for the deduction work, but…”  He shrugs. “Sod them.  I’m going to tell the publisher I want to keep it.”
nice.  I wish she was
Sherlock looks at the sheet of paper, which is wreathed at the edges with cartoonish garlands and mistletoe.  The text at the top says ‘My Wish List.’
“You first,” he said.
Maybe if I book now, I can get us in next year.
“Remember when you called me a drama queen, John?” Sherlock inquired.  A cab glided off the street and halted before them.  “Ah, perfect timing.”  He rounded the side of the car, allowing Alexander to climb in through the nearest door.  John followed.  When Sherlock made to slam the door in his face, he caught the edge and leaned in close.
He couldn’t let hope blind him to reality:  that John didn’t want him.
“But then I met you, John, and I—I changed.  I saw an army doctor with too much spirit to squander among normal, boring people.  I dragged you under starlight and over rooftops and through the darkest shadows of London.  I thought it was all a lark.”  He smiled, crinkling his nose.  “I was so blind, John.”
“Try and remember there’s a woman here who might die.”
“It’s nothing,” said Alexander gruffly.
“The walnut mold,” he said.  “The one for treating the chairs.”
“She didn’t,” said John gently.  “Look, I… I know this is all going to come as a shock, but.  She changed her life.  She changed everything about herself, made herself into a completely different person.”
John glowers at him.  “Don’t use that tone.”
I have no Beta or Britpicker, so please let me know if you spot any mistakes.  Thank you!
Later, John wouldn’t be able to recall the time between watching Moriarty’s video and Alexander Grant’s arrival at the flat.  He would remember the knowing smirk on Moriarty’s face as he uttered the name
sorry to disrupt your…”  Another wave. “…evening.”
“Why are you doing this?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock stilled with a sharp inhalation.  Divots from a small pair of hands had been worn into the fabric with repetition.  An image coalesced in his mind’s eye:  little arms flailing… pale, slender fingers knotted in the felt…
