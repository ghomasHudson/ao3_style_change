“Fourteen minutes, twenty-five seconds and counting.”
Molly glared daggers at her husband.
“That’s… actually kind of nice of you, which is weird… but… anyway, it’s about independence, Sherlock. I’ve always paid my own way. I like just going and shopping without having to wait for you like a Stepford Wife and ask for your bank card.”
“Not after you just got over a head cold,” she scolded him. “Come on, it’s almost midnight.”
“I think we should have tea out here tonight,” Rucastle had finally wrapped his dressing robe around himself and tied the sash. The weather had finally dipped back down to its normal moderate temperatures for this time of year and part of the country. There was a hint of a cool breeze stirring, the small promise of the coming autumn.
“Oh, I’ve got loads. The crazy things we used to do…”
Saturday morning
“Will he?” Mycroft feigned innocence, “Shame.”
Sherlock gave John a small, sad smile. “Oh John, I never had a choice. Not with this case, not since it involves Moriarty and Magnussen. It simply… amused me to irritate Mycroft before telling him I’d take the case.”
) reached for the car door handle.
Latex gloves
“Shut up,” Violet had leaned on Sherlock more than usual on their walk to Doña Nalda’s. Her feet had felt weird that morning, like they had fallen asleep. She still couldn’t wiggle her left toes but she could still walk, thank God. She hadn’t mentioned it to Sherlock, but fear had iced her veins and frozen her heart.
“Edward, your mum and dad want you to learn how to take care of your things,” Violet decided the word “responsibility” might fly right over the boy’s head. “They want you to learn how take care of your things on your own, in case there isn’t a maid around.”
Sherlock had learned that when John fell into that deep, dreaming sleep, the good sleep, the kind that recharges, he turned into an immovable stone.
“Ah… well, you see,” Violet blundered, then just said, “Shit.”
“John?”
And her hands had started shaking uncontrollably on her way to John’s house.
It sounded too similar to Jim Moriarty’s voice.
Then That Voice demanded, with eyes still closed, “What time is it?”
Brave enough to love you…
“American for snogging,” Violet whispered back. “Seriously, I thought you spent time in the US.”
“Oh John, how well you know me,” Sherlock purred as he added sugar to his tea. “And get eggrolls for Gladstone. Chicken, not pork.”
The room went deadly silent. John blinked owlishly at Mary. She might as well as slapped him.
Then she emitted a dry sob when she realized she couldn’t think of the right words to finish her ghoulish thought. There was a dull throbbing within her skull, as if the cranial bones were trying to crush her brain.
“Uh… why?”
Ever vigilant, Violet stood in the doorway, while Gladstone, all business now, sniffed around the lounge as Violet scanned  it , checking to see if anything had been disturbed. Her ears strained, listening for any ominous creaks that would indicate someone was in the flat waiting for her. She put the rucksack down, unzipped it and looked over her shoulder. When she didn’t see Mrs. Hudson, she took her Glock out and clicked the safety off.
John chuckled but then asked gravely, “Is he OK? Sherlock? After confronting Moriarty again?”
How convenient.
But the gangsters, the drug dealers and the addicts weren’t even the worst part of that shitty motel. To Violet, the kids were the saddest part. They should have been sitting in a classroom where they belonged. Instead they milled around the steaming asphalt of the parking lot or loitering around the crappy, outdated and unsafe playground. Hyper-vigilant as usual, Violet observed how large families were crammed into one tiny motel room, usually single women with multiple children of a variety of ages.
“Sweetheart,” Greg said helplessly.
Yes, something had happened to the handsome young man, holding the four-year-old Sherlock. Something that had made Sherlock shut this sentimental photograph of a loving family in a book to be forgotten. A symbolic deletion.
Too soon, John did.
“Good,” Molly snuggled against her husband.
Sherlock noted that silver rings no longer adorned almost all of his fingers. He only wore two rings stacked on top of each other on his left ring finger, a man’s wedding band and a woman’s, both of them white-gold.
***Sherlock's quote comes from "The Adventure of the Reigate Squire."
He dipped his head down and breathed into her ear: “Marry me.”
“If you come with me, he lives,” Mrs. Toller lifted her other hand and pointed John’s gun at Mary.
He shook his head, couldn’t think of an elegant way of finishing his thoughts.
“Yeah, how dare he,” Violet deadpanned as Sherlock took two pieces of candy. “I’m going to make soup for lunch. And you will eat it, even if I have to sit on you and pour it down your throat,” she informed him as the cellophane crinkled while he unwrapped the candy.
Gladstone also perked his head up. His pink tongue lolled out of his mouth.
Upon seeing them, Bevington tossed his cigarette out the driver’s side window of the moving van. “About time,” he muttered to himself.
His go-to for those kinds of situations was always Mycroft boffing The Queen.
“Honestly Mycroft, I had deleted the fact that we still had a monarchy. John reminded me that we did during his stag party.”
Thank God events in Chicago had been more interesting.
“Not really, no,” Molly tried to sound joking but tears definitely stood out in her eyes now.
Neil Gibson and Grace Dunbar appeared to be American tourists who had spent the day exploring book shops, boutiques and museums in the
John snorted, but he also did not think today’s chill was quite so bad either. The sun even made an appearance, but it only served to light the sky, not warm the air. John’s breath still puffed out like steam as he asked Sherlock in a whisper, “Are you sure it’s here?”
“Perhaps we could continue this enlightening discussion
“Excellent,” Jim nodded. “We needed some good news. So, how does this play out?”
He rang off.
She looked down at her left hand. Willed it to

text with your right hand.
A million questions exploded in John’s mind.
“You can leave, if you want.”
22 July 1983
She picked up the sheet she had printed out about GBF. She studied the flagstaff again, quietly reading the names out loud. She skipped over the names she had already crossed off and rested on Heathcliff Cullen-Culpepper, Earl of Winchester, a recent addition to the board of directors, albeit a minor position.
“It’s a dog fighting ring,” Sherlock said distastefully. “Honestly. We live in the twenty-first century. We have the cinema and telly and video games. There are plenty of ways to fill the need to witness violence without actually hurting anyone. How is it possible there are Neanderthals who need to witness two dogs fight to the death just for the sake of entertainment?”
Behind a cigarette
“You. Moron.”
“Knew you were hungry,” John chuckled as he zipped up his coat.
“I said you needed to be here for John. Being here doesn’t involve
“Oh don’t be ridiculous, of course they do!” Mycroft snapped.
“Well, I used wear Claire de la Lune, but my husband really doesn’t like it. Can you recommend something else?”
“Hello Princess,” Victor got up from the desk, knelt down for her and spread his arms. “Are you having a nice day with Mummy?”
No lube, no condoms and nothing that vibrated…
“Oh for God’s sake, why can’t we put it on the floor?”
“He’s in Chicago,” her voice quivered with just the tiniest bit of panic.
“She was so quiet, I barely heard her, but what she said was…” John squeezed his eyes tight. “She said, ‘And I’m the only thing standing between Sherlock and a bullet.’”
Lestrade sat up, then reached down to help his pregnant wife up as she slowly started push herself upright. He then studied his bride in the moonlight, all soft and round. Nothing but curves underneath the old t-shirt of his that she wore as a nightgown. He ran his fingers through her lovely auburn hair, thick and soft and long thanks to the prenatal vitamins.
“No,” John said. “You’ve taught me to observe instead of just see. I observe that this, the elephant in the room, is eating you alive.”
“Something you can relate to,” John said before he could help himself.
“No, the entire bloody café closed. Went under. Embezzlement or some shit, dunno,” Evie shrugged. “I showed up for my shift and I was handed a final pay cheque and was told Best of Luck. I deposited it before it could bounce. I’ve got enough to cover my share of the rent and groceries for this month, but that’s it. And I dunno when I’m going to able to find a job. I’m expected to show up for rehearsals, even if I’m not actually on stage.”
Both men, tall, heavily muscled and skilled in military combat, had received word that the Third Wave had been executed and deemed a success. Sources stated that “Miss Smith” had been called to consult on the crime scene (the Met was so delightfully easy to infiltrate.) Miss Smith had also been seen at St. Bart’s, waiting for Mrs. Watson to finish her shift. She had been on her mobile most of the time, presumably with Holmes. So in all likelihood, Dr. Watson had learned about his sister’s demise. It was presumed that he and Holmes would be on the first flight out of Paris.
“I could have said mountain climbing,” Sherlock droned, his eyes closed. He lay on his back, head on arm, socked feet in Violet’s lap.
Meanwhile, Mycroft slipped in and stood next to Sherlock’s other side, his hand resting neatly on top of his umbrella handle, as if it were a sword he was ready to draw.
“It’s forgotten, John. Truly,” Anthea said briskly, letting her hand drop from his shoulder. “Water under the bridge. Shall we go rescue the
the city. We’re going to stay with the evacuees until we know for sure where the boys are,” Irene pulled Violet back. “Look at us. We’re both useless. You’re completely spent and I’m nearly so. We’re both going to drop from shock if we don’t get warm somehow.”
Harry staggered towards her. “Maybe I don’t need my little brother to help me out. Last I heard the tabs upped the price to ten thou for a decent photo of the infamous Other Woman, double for a shot of you and Hat-man snogging. But I’m not greedy. All I need is one picture of you, madam.” She mimed taking a photograph.
And nearly gave Sherlock, Mrs. Hudson and Violet a coronary.
Mycroft lumbered off of the young lord. “Get out of my room,” he snarled, pulling his T-shirt down. “And stay away from me at school, you hear me?” He lowered his voice, “I can do very bad things to you too.”
Then she sternly told herself to focus and just be glad there was a bra and trainers that fit her.
You’re meeting John at quarter to eleven,
Toller, having spent the entire day with Rucastle, said nothing. He merely sat there in his smart gray suit with his perfectly knotted yellow neck-tie and matching handkerchief. He looked drunk, actually. Maybe he had been nipping on a bottle of something in the kitchen while he and Mrs. Toller prepared tea.
Violet thought as Rucastle’s ham-sized hand engulfed hers.
, Violet inwardly screamed in frustration as she made her way down the stairs, gripping the banister for dear life.
“Why not? I don’t want a blow-by-blow playback, in fact, please don’t. Go into that much detail about you and him. Ever,” John felt the familiar yet annoying burning pang that he had felt when he saw Sherlock sitting in front of a naked Irene, when he had witnessed him locking lips with Janine and when he watched as Sherlock lightly traced his fingertips down her back when Violet slid off his chair arm.
Unexpectedly he leaned down and ghosted a kiss on her forehead. “Go to sleep, then. I promise that you will wake up in the morning.” He smiled at her and smoothed her hair off her forehead.
Sherlock leaned over, twisting his body so he could press his forehead against hers.
After that tiny hesitation, he smiled, “We’re going to find her.”
You helped me once before. Please, I beg you, help me again.
~*~*~
“Oh,” John furrowed his brows. Frowning at the ceiling, he asked, “Any ideas?”
“I am capable of putting water in the kettle and turning it on.”
believe
He had meant to take a leisurely walk, but something had compelled him to try a cautious jog instead. Gladstone kept up with him like a trooper.
The rest of the trip had been mercifully silent until the black SUV rolled up in front of 221 Baker Street. Out of habit, she looked up as she and the dog exited the cab and… yes, there were still lights on in 221B.
“Richard was not ill,” the old lion snarled, smoothing his gaudy shirt down as if it were one of his fancy suits. “He was lost.”
“Love,” Mary smiled at him. “You’re already on morphine and loads of antibiotics. Something to take the edge off your anxiety while you’re recuperating really isn’t going to hurt any, now is it?”
Frowning, Violet picked the pillow up and hit Sherlock over the head with it.
But she only managed to bruise her hands badly, adding to the scrapes and torn flesh.
“They usually don’t,” he muttered, wondering what she’d say if she saw his chest and abdomen. The knife scar in his gut, the various cigarette burn marks and of course, Mary’s bullet inches from his heart.
While Sherlock had been recovering from his ordeal, John had all but ordered Lestrade to lie and tell everyone he’d reconciled one full month earlier with Molly and to claim the child was his. When Sherlock more or less was himself after the horrific withdrawal from all the drugs that had been injected into his body, John told him about the old man and what he had said about Molly.
“Oh, none taken. I’ll keep trying to get Sherlock to open up but you would be my favorite person on the planet if you took one for the team and talked to Mycroft.”
“While I still maintain
There was no trace of the affectionate pet from before. Gladstone knew he was Working now. And he knew his priorities: Protect his Mistress. Obey his Mistress.
“I’m out of here,” Violet ignored Irene’s request to sit. She also valiantly ignored the pins-and-needles sensation running up and down her left leg.
Those final three words cut through the wintery chill. “We learned from our mistakes with Moriarty,” Mycroft stuffed his free hand in his coat, when he realized he had been clenching and unclenching it over and over. “Moriarty bribed the jurors and got off scot-free. We could not risk that happening again with Magnussen.”
So now I'm completely nervous about posting this chapter... here we go...
“Precisely,” Sherlock closed his eyes, coughed a little. “It’s now up to “Miss Smith” to cultivate his trust and to appeal to his ego. Make him
John supposed the lad was right. “I don’t think anything’s broken,” he gingerly moved his shoulder and grimaced. “Just hurts like a bitch, is all. I think the bleeding stopped though.”
“No,” Mrs. Hudson’s cheeks turned rosy. “Someone once said he looks like Scooter from
Suddenly a painful heat rushed through her body, as if the blood in her veins had been replaced by lava. Her face went completely numb. Sweat beaded up on her flesh and someone started pounding her head with a sledgehammer. The floor swayed as if she was on a ship and not in an apartment. She started to moan in agony then she vomited on herself.
After all they had been through, the infertility, the failed IVF treatments, the previous adoptions that fell apart; it was if God had finally decided to give them a break.
Sherlock made himself sit up. Lestrade pulled his hand away as Sherlock rose. As he slowly took off the oxygen mask, Sherlock wheezed, speaking slowly in an effort to enunciate, “I’m. Alright. Greg.”
Dupin led the charge, Sherlock stayed close to his heels and John covered them both the best he could. Their feet thundered down the shabby hallway as the shouts continued.
“Ah, it all makes sense now,” Mycroft nodded as he leaned on his umbrella, as if it was a cane he needed for support. “Why you insisted on meeting here, in the open. During foul weather so that if I was wired, which I am not as agreed, the wind would interfere with the recording. You really are a clever girl, as my brother calls you.”
When Sherlock lowered his hand, Mary popped him again, this time a proper punch to the nose.
Except for John. He had stayed with Sherlock again for those six months after he had gotten shot… by Mary.
Last but not least, all the platonic-non-creepy love to my beta'er cadogan, who continues to slog through the messy first drafts I send her despite having a busy Real Life schedule. Not only does cadogan fix my embarrassing typos and grammar errors,  but also takes the time to lend a ear (not literally because... gross) when I have Real Life Drama going on and have no one else to talk to...

She just wanted to kill the bastards.
“Even though,” he rolled his eyes dramatically. “I have already deduced what you are thinking and have already thought of five counterarguments to your opinion, say what is weighing on your mind anyway. You’re going to sit there all po’faced until you say your piece.”
As the cabbie turned onto his street, John decided he would order pizza for Susan and Anna. He’d let them watch a DVD in the lounge then banish them to Susan’s room for the rest of the night. They could giggle and carry on upstairs. He wanted the downstairs to himself.
Sherlock had just beaten Rucastle at chess again when Violet returned to the library. They had made their excuses and regretfully turned down his offer of lunch.
She learned that Papa Bella left at ten o’clock on the dot, Paul at eleven and that Ernesto was a shameless adulterer. She also knew that at eleven o’clock, the kitchen no longer served full meals, but would serve appetizers until one in the morning, catering to the drinking crowd. At eleven, Ernesto would switch responsibilities from head chef to bartender, presumably because the kitchen didn’t really need a head chef to direct them how drop fries and cheese balls into the fryer. In reality, it was so he could hit on all the pretty customers.
John didn’t like this show of uncertainty, act or not.
yourself.”
Sherlock shut his mouth, focused on staying upright and not vomiting.
!” Mycroft spluttered. “How did you not know we had a monarchy? Who do you think lives in Buckingham for heaven’s sake!”
When the crappy private investigation agency made her a job offer, she accepted it, knowing she really had no other options. She knew she was lucky not to be in prison for the role she played in the human trafficking.
“Oh,” John tried to look embarrassed. “Had a bit of an accident.”
It had been stupidly easy to roofie
“Oh God,” John rubbed his face. “You told him he’s being stupid, yeah?”
Bloody wonderful.
The hostess blinked at him. Then she muttered “Bloody ‘ell,” in a pure Cockney accent as she jerked her arm out of his hand and stalked off.
Mycroft held out the file, a peace offering, “Here, take this. At least get all the facts before pursuing the Scowrers Family. Educate Dr. Watson as well. Then, remember, before diving in the deep end, that I begged you not to chase this. Not for my sake, but for the sake of our parents…” he frowned as Sherlock rolled his eyes and shifted away from him, “Very well.” Mycroft pursed his lips like a fussy, disapproving old lady, “If not for them, then at the very least for your son.”
221 Baker Street
“Aw, come on, Miss Smith,” the boy whinged.
20 June 2016
“Look up at the sky and tell me what you see."
Her thumbs flying over the keypad, she reminded him, “I said if Sherlock hadn’t sent a text to ‘Miss Smith’ before the police burst into the flat, you both would have disappeared. She contacted Mycroft. He sent me to find you two. But someone else had posted bail.”
She knew just how vile and sadistic Lord Cullen-Culpepper, the Earl of Winchester really was.
of dissent but grudgingly moved. John fumbled with the tap with his right hand. “She’ll have to go to a proper clinic to get antibiotics. I can’t write prescriptions at the moment. I really shouldn’t have examined her actually.”
“He’s not the MI-6 mole, but he’s working with him. Or her.”
“How dare I? How dare
“You’re… actually going to trust me?”
you back then!”
“She could still sell you out to get back in,” Trager pointed out.
“Yes, I’m here.”
“Where is Lisbeth?” Sherlock demanded.
Sherlock waved him off towards the kitchen. “You know where everything is.”
“Two weeks from today.”
“It doesn’t matter, that’s not the point,” Marie interrupted. “The point is the Professor believes it to be true, but the Lestrade boy is not his top priority, although you should warn the DI and the pathologist so they can take appropriate steps to protect their son.”
“Because of the mole.”
Once Peters and Violet were gone, Jim sauntered over to Irene. “God, you got so
There was a click then the middle row of fluorescents light up.
“Oh by all means,” Sherlock said, not waiting for Mycroft to serve him. He reached for the teapot and poured himself a cup.
Or rather, the lion.
He closed his eyes again, enjoying the taste of tobacco, the feel of his lungs filling with nicotine-poisoned smoke. The heat of the unrelenting sun on his skin… might end up with a bit of sunburn tomorrow, but he didn’t care… he threw his arm over his eyes, wishing he had brought a pair of sunglasses up with him…
“An hour will do,” Sherlock tented his fingers again. “And pick up some food while you’re out. I could do with an early dinner. Or late lunch, I suppose,” Sherlock checked his watch.
“No. Yes, arggh!” Sherlock turned away from her and curled up in a ball. “I have
“I didn’t leave her vulnerable,” Sherlock jerked his head as blood dribbled down his face, ruining another dress shirt. In a cold hiss, he added, “I left her
1:20 PM, London time
“Take the next dose with food.”
As he proceeded to chain-smoke, he cursed himself for allowing emotion override his good sense. If he hadn’t flounced out of the house like a prat, he could have called a cab and gone back to the flat he shared with Mike Stamford.
“There’s a jar in there for such a necessity,” Violet held her hand out. “It’s Sherlock, remember? He thought of everything. There’s a thermostat, a mini-refrigerator for cold drinks and snacks, a kettle for tea, a small selection of books and two television monitors. One for surveillance and the other to actually watch telly when you get bored,” she smiled and waggled her fingers at him, beckoning him to stand up. “Since this obviously is not your first dance, I need not tell you about the importance of staying out of sight?”
She did a neat little pivot to completely avoid his touch altogether. Let him fall and face-plant onto the pavement.
, “I need to talk to your boss, now. There’s a potential death threat towards a passenger on an incoming flight and her husband, but we need to handle this quietly so we avoid a panic,” he glared at the driver in the panda car pulling up next to his van with the sirens wailing and lights flashing.
.” Sherlock pushed himself off the slab and walked towards her. “The reason why Wasp asked me to visit her in Stockholm was she found the Moriarty code on the Dark Net, but it was incomplete. It was missing a section. Without it, the code wouldn’t launch.” He stood in front of Violet now. She tilted her head up to look at him. He ran his long fingers through her tangled hair then held her head in his hands. “
“Ratiocination,
11:30 AM        Lunch
Well, seven if you counted the dog… which, he did. He liked Gladstone. The murderous mutt made him happy… except when he ate his koi fish, of course.
He rubbed his goatee in thought. “I used to tour universities to lecture students studying for their masters. When I lectured at the University of Virginia, there was a young lady with hazel eyes like a cat. Bright girl, asked very intelligent questions, said she was planning on a career with the FBI.” Then he shrugged theatrically. “But, she had blonde hair and you are a redhead, so there is no way you’re the same girl, right?”
“No, but I have been doing some research on flesh-eating bacteria,” Sherlock said, handing the files to Violet, causing her to slosh water onto the floor and nearly drop the other glass. “Come along Archie, I’ll show you.”
“So, Violet pretended to read her notes again. “Really, there’s nothing that ties you to Moriarty except… well. Your alias.”
God, it had felt so
“Thought you were going to eat first?” Susan asked as Sweetie began to whine, pacing in front of the back door.
, John immediately thought.
“Are we quits then, you and me?”
“Good company?” John sounded sceptical as he lifted his silvery brows.
“You forgot ‘liar’,” Sherlock added.
marinating in something. .
“Don’t do that, blame yourself,” Lestrade put himself between John and the body.
“Mm, newish. Got it last January.”
Her recitation seemed to satisfy Dr. Sankaran so he nodded towards the nurse. She scowled, apparently not appreciating being treated like a maid, but she pivoted on her trainers (blue, to match her scrubs) and marched out to fulfill Violet’s request.
“Your prose is just as purple and poetic as John’s sometimes,” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
his thoughts trailed off as he became acutely aware how parched his mouth and throat were now.
She had dragged herself to the back bedroom and flopped onto the rumpled bed. She had curled up into a ball, massaging her tingling left hand as she tried to force herself to sleep.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock forced himself to sound wounded. “I said I would help you. I said we were on the same side now.”
“Yep,” and she rang off. She paused to lock her computer screen and then she put her elbow on her desk and rubbed her forehead with the heel of her hand. “Shit.”
Violet fought down the urge to smile at the childish term. Last thing she wanted was to sound patronizing, especially with a loaded weapon within the Swede’s reach. “No. I’m not a psychologist or psychiatrist. I’m a federal agent, well,” Violet studied her hands, realizing she still wore her gloves. Her hands felt too warm but she didn’t dare take them off, didn’t want to leave fingerprints. “At least, I used to be.”
Irene, after all, dared to deduce the heart.
Mitton whistled. “Whew, you don’t fuck around, do you Holmes? How much time on the clock?”
She hadn’t been this frightened since her mother died.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, “You mustn’t. You’ll get us in trouble.”
She gave him a withering look. “Please, I know better. Rucastle is going to have an eye for jewelry. He’s going to know the difference between a diamond and a rhinestone.”
“He likes it when you talk to him. We’re thinking about calling him Henry. Is that alright? Do you like that? Is that a nice, normal name?”
“Why would you have to recuse yourself from anything?” Chibs gave Violet a tight little smile. “We’re completely legitimate. We’re clean.”
Then Sherlock flicked his eyes down at their guns. Only Sherlock observed a small trace of smoke wafting from Lisbeth’s KimberPro. Rat Boy never had to use his gun.
“What brings you to Baker Street?” Violet asked as she stretched her left leg.
He ran his hand down her hair. Found a loose curl and lightly pulled it and let it go, just for the pleasure of watching it spring back into a curl. “Love is stupid.”
Tollers MIA
Then Anthea was kneeling down in front him. “Let me, Dr. Watson.”
Violet smiled tremulously then slipped her hands out of John’s to wipe her eyes. “We’re a mess,” she snuffled. She dabbed at her eyes with her fingers and frowned at the mascara she smudged off. “Do you mind taking the cake down while I touch up my make-up?”
“I don’t know…”
He looked up. His eyes weren’t dead. They were alive, electrified, “
,” Dupin beamed just as John’s mobile rang with the opening bars of
John grabbed Sherlock by his upper arms, stopping his furious circling. “Stop that. You’re making me dizzy.” Once Sherlock stood still, John asked, “Do you think Mason is using us to do the heavy lifting and then he’s going to take the credit for our work?”
Susan, of course, was sobbing. Mary had launched herself at Sherlock, grabbing at his arm in an effort to make him release Susan. Sherlock roughly shoved Mary to the floor. She landed on her hip, with a grunt.
“Holy shit,” Violet whispered. “No wonder he keeps telling me he doesn’t care about money.”
Jack Woodley had laughed as he had showed her the pictures he took while he had personally tortured Michael before they killed him.
. That everything she had done, the good and the bad was because she loved me.”
Irene had appeared at the
Judging by the mountain of blankets on the floor and the way he lay on the bed (flat on back, fingers splayed out over chest, head listing to the side), Sherlock had moved the blankets to the floor then laid down into his favorite Thinking Position, stretched out on his back with his fingers steepled, eyes closed.
Violet shoved that thought back down, glancing over her shoulder as they all jogged run past the giant hole in the garage door, using the battered van as cover.
“Like the Copper Beaches?” John challenged him. “She was being poisoned under our own noses. I’m an expert in treating poisonings and you’re a chemist and we both missed it.”
“You’re giving me credit for brains I don’t have,” Violet scowled.
“Oh don’t get the two mixed up, John. Mycroft definitely does not approve of certain aspects of Sherlock’s life, his job as a consulting detective, his addictions, his sexuality, his utter disregard for conformity but that disapproval is borne from worry. Mycroft doesn’t give a shit about
Posting a day early because I'm going on vacation tomorrow! (Yay!)
“The truth?” Heathcliff scoffed, “About what? What more do you want to hear?”
Violet pulled her mobile out of her black skinny jeans. Reading the text from Sherlock, she ordered Mary, “Put the gun down, Mary. We have to help him.”
The first time John emailed a tentative email, he immediately got roasted by the Great Detective:
“You say the sweetest things, you know that?” she informed him.
The Devil’s Foot lovingly called the dented vehicle “The Chester the Molester-mobile.”
4:25 PM
“Ecstatic,” John muttered. “I’m going home.”
Then the dog lunged.
“Our agents are en route to the Copper Beaches,” she told him, taking a step back. “Police as well, including an up-and-comer from Lestrade’s division. A Sergeant Alexis MacDonald? She’s actually quite competent.”
“I’m not mind-gaming you, Sherlock,” she stood up, holding her coat by its collar and her sweatshirt by its hood. “You have more to lose than I do, you have a fucking kid.”
“Take John upstairs and attend to his wound before it becomes septic,” Sherlock intoned magnanimously as he rose. Snatching the pyjamas and towels out of Honoré’s arms, he brushed past the young man, off towards the tiny shower.
After telling John and Wiggins, “You’re welcome,” he took two silent steps and then stopped, cocking his head. He could hear the creak of footsteps above. Someone was in a hurry. Stomping back and forth. Probably from wardrobe to bed and back again. Packing. Whatever “surprise” they had planned for him, they did not intend to stick around for the end results.
Sherlock felt positive he was going to be sick all over the pavement, “I can’t.”
Wiggins counted the notes. “OK… but, um, what do I tell Shezza?”
Intimidated by the rumbling baritone and the grey-black eyes, the nurse gulped and took a step back. But her voice stayed firm, “Do not threaten me, sir.”
“Coming.”
“Mathematics, but that’s not your forte. Stick to the boring things. Her house, her garden, her friends and family, blah, blah, blather, blather.”
John hated her for it.
Molly and Lestrade’s presence meant more to John then the ragtag collection of distant relatives who came to gawp rather than to pay their respects to Harry.
Sherlock’s heart twisted.
This one he’d been toying with however just wasn’t coming out the way he wanted it to. He had shamelessly plagiarized from Violet. She had once described Sherlock as having “a dyslexic heart” and his writer’s ear had fallen in love with that turn of phrase.
“You sure? That’s a lot of money you’re leaving on the table, boss.”
“You left the same flowers at my grave as you did at your mother’s,” Sherlock called after him in a much softer voice. John stopped and turned slightly, looking over his shoulder. Saw that Sherlock looked genuinely confused by that fact.
“No one can continue a ruse like that indefinitely,” Dupin agreed good-naturedly.
She un-tucked her puffed-sleeved blouse and pulled it away from her body. As if  the unusual heat wave wasn’t already unbearable, the mercury had climbed  a few more degrees the past few days. The entire flat was a now giant sauna instead of just the upstairs bedroom.

Violet squeezed her eyes tightly shut, inhaled through her nose deeply. She held the breath for a moment then exhaled. The breath she let out was shaky so she inhaled again and repeated the cycle until she could feel her heartbeat slow a little.
a door?”
“Can’t you ring Anna’s parents?”
How he kept one hand on the door handle, as if he needed to exit the car at a moment’s notice.
“Oh. Oh, well, I don’t remember,” John shrugged, trying to play it off. Then he scowled as Sherlock continued to stare at him. “And stop with the look.”
“Why?”
“Sherlock,” she said grimly when she got back to 221B Baker Street that night, “You watched the video of that evil little brat, didn’t you?”
. You could cut the tension with a knife between you two. I just don’t want to say the wrong thing or make an uncomfortable situation worse. It’s obvious you don’t want to talk to him but he wants to talk to yo-”
“You need to keep your doctor’s appointment,” he sternly told her.
“I’m quite sure you do. Do you want me to beg?” Mrs. Holmes clasped the straps of her handbag as if it were a lifeline. “Fine, I’ll beg, I’ll crawl on my hands and knees, if I must.”
But I do strongly believe that anyone who mistreats animals and children should be kicked in the throat. Repeatedly.
“One hundred percent?” John jeered.
But he stopped himself. She was Edward’s Mummy and he still loved his Mummy.
“Listen, listen please, Reverend, I understand that this is a very … well, odd situation, but a woman’s life depends on it, so please, let us help her and clear the chapel,
“Like you’d go away if I told you no,” Sally turned her back to him, setting her water bottle down with a shaking hand. Trying to get her bearings, she demanded as she glared at him over her shoulder, “What do you want?”
“Doing what, precisely?” Sherlock delicately asked but his brows were furrowed, as if he knew exactly what she wanted to do.
Weakness in foot (“foot fell asleep”)
But his hands were completely steady.
“Right, if he’s not a passenger, he wouldn’t be allowed actually inside, security and all that. He’s probably waiting outside of the queue to go through security checks,” the security guard nodded decisively, convinced he was right.
“Mary, I’m here to talk,” Mycroft folded up the newspaper neatly. “Besides, do you really believe I’d risk my brother’s and your husband’s wraths by making you disappear?”
“Thank you,” Sherlock rumbled, anxious for something, anything to happen… the game had been stagnating for too long. Time to end this stalemate.
“Where are you?” Sherlock barked into the mobile.
“How sad,” Violet kept a straight face. “Then you’ll have no problem blowing
Meanwhile the heart monitor started beeping like mad. Plus John still had the IV catheter in his right hand and Pulse Oximeter on his right pointer finger. Ignoring the irritating beeping of the heart monitor for the moment, Sherlock dealt with the Oximeter first, unclipping it at once. Then to John’s astonishment, Sherlock prepared to remove the IV needle as well.
“Victor,” Sherlock, in turn, sounded genuinely surprised. He reached out and shook Victor’s proffered hand. Violet stood next to Sherlock. Remembering his role, he draped his arm over her shoulders but in the same bewildered voice, asked Victor: “What… uh, what brings you back to London?”
him, but we knew him, or so we thought. Anyway, I was in Germany at the time, interrogating a terrorist suspect, otherwise I would have been with Marie. But as we were both told it was a routine surveillance job, neither one of us worried,” Suddenly, Dupin’s face contorted again, but in pain this time. “It wasn’t a routine surveillance job. It was an ambush. And my Marie…” his eyes watered and his lip trembled. “My Marie was garroted and thrown into the Seine, like she was trash.” It took Dupin a moment to compose himself before continuing. “All the agents were killed, not just Marie. They had been compromised, they had been sold out.” He blinked his eyes, trying to regain control. “Mycroft claimed
Mary had her nose buried in a pharmaceutical book and was munching ginger lemon tea biscuits when Sherlock threw open the front door. Mary nearly jumped out of her skin. She did knock over the forgotten cup of coffee sitting on the arm of the sofa, splashing cold coffee and congealed milk all over the rug.
If Mary’s car wasn’t paid for, he would have encouraged her to get rid of it.
“Do you read my blogs at all?” John asked.
It took every ounce of self-control Mycroft possessed (and his self-control was legendary) not to climb over his desk and throttle Magnussen right then and there.
he bring up his old university sweetheart? The one who had gotten away… or more accurately, the one he let go. “This isn’t about me, it is about you. How long have you been carrying on with him?”
. She does not bloody shut up. Get her going on a subject and you will have to say very little. When she does ask about yourself, less is more. While she does not have an eidetic memory like Mycroft and I do, it is very good; do not underestimate how much she can remember. Stick to the basic points of the Violet Smith persona. Your mother was American, your father British, both deceased. No brothers and sisters. You used to be a PA but you worked at the agency that was bombed last March. You and I had met through a case. We moved in more quickly than anticipated because your flat caught fire and burned to the ground. We,” he screwed his eyes tightly shut. “Haven’t set a date for the wedding yet. Since we rushed the whole-living-together bit, we want to take our time planning the wedding bit.”
“Violet,” Sherlock shoved his hands in his pocket. “We must bring her back to the UK. Letting her go to America was a mistake.” He shook his shaggy black curls, now grown back out to their usual unruly length. “She is beset by enemies. So far she is managing to stay one step ahead of them, but it won’t be long before her body starts completely betraying her mind and she will be utterly incapacitated. Then it will be a race to see who can get to her first.”
Sherlock had scoffed, deeming the case a “Negative-Three”, but John had pleaded with him to take the case.
However she knew that even though blowing through the red light hadn’t been the best idea in the world, she hadn’t been
She thought as her boots hit the ground of the alley behind 221 Baker Street.
“What about your water bill?”
He knew what it meant when Dad said he’d Check with Mother.
Mind-palace John merely lifted his fair brows. “If she’s being sarcastic, she’s on the mend.”
She drove the speed limit until she reached the Loop. Then she turned off the Loop, and got on Long Shore Drive, heading north. Then she merged with traffic and floored it, not completely sure where she was going, but she knew she couldn’t stay in one place and an opulent car like this would stick out like a sore thumb.

She had dealt with some real low-lives in her career, absolute scumbags. She had learned a very long time ago to divorce herself from emotion, from sentiment while doing her job. She had to; otherwise she’d go insane with every case that fell apart. Or when her quarry could afford a powerful attorney and therefore actually get away with murder.
film. “There. Stay close to me. Keep this side,” he gently pressed his fingers against her left cheek, “To me. Look straight ahead at the door. It’s only five steps to the door. The photogs will snap your profile, the side of your face that’s covered with hair. Even if they get your face,” Sherlock studied her. “With the sunglasses and hair obscuring your features, even the most sophisticated face recognition software would have problems identifying you. And you applied your lipstick differently. You added more lip liner, making your lips look plumper.”
Mary nodded and slid the door open, standing aside so Violet could get by.
Violet really didn’t care whether or not he returned, but he did with Violet’s cup. “Here you go,” he wheezed, setting it down in front of her. Violet frowned before could help herself when she saw the strawberry pink liquid in her cup. She knew immediately it was that awful Shan Zha tea. Toller ignored her grimace and set the little silver jug of mug on the other side of John. Then, like a ghost, he simply drifted away.
“M-m-my name,” stuttered a woman’s voice with a London accent, “Is Clarissa Sutton.” The tinny voice echoed through the church.
“Now is the perfect time,” John never raised his voice. “Why did you jump?”
“It does if the
He could picture her girlish handwriting, before it deteriorated into her adult scrawl:
Now, the healthy side of the Earl’s face blanched. Gripping the armrests of his seat, he snarled, “I’ll go public. I’ll tell the world how this,” he pointed at his damaged half of his face, “Really happened.”
“You. I need you. Call me back,” he rang off abruptly when he saw Agent Mitton walking towards him.
“Of course he does,” John grumbled, not sure why Sherlock thought that was funny. However, sometimes even John didn’t understand Sherlock’s sense of humor. Many things Sherlock thought were hilarious flew straight over John’s head.
“Mm-hmm,” John hummed before seeking Sherlock’s mouth. “Yeah,” he pressed a soft, lingering kiss against his lips. “Yeah,” he breathed before bequeathing a second kiss, a little less lingering, a little more insistent. “You’re right,” he flicked his tongue against Sherlock’s mouth until he parted his lips. After that, the kisses became hot, wet and unrelenting, almost needy.
Their arms and legs tangled together, they pushed and ground against each other. They had to  breathe from their noses as they couldn’t get enough of each other’s mouths and tongues. Time ceased to exist, the world beyond the bedroom ceased to exist. Every single person who was out for their blood, from Moriarty to Mycroft to Mary could have been waiting at their bedroom door with pitchforks and torches and neither one of them would have given a damn.
his latest trick was lying on his tummy and trying to scoot forward. He was obviously desperate to learn how to crawl, as if rolling over wasn’t already the most fun in the world. Lestrade had already started baby-proofing drawers and cupboard doors, preparing for the inevitable. “Once he’s mobile, there will be no stopping him,” Lestrade had predicted.
“Just a moment, Mrs. Hudson,” Violet Smith called out, then hissed at Mycroft, “I have to go,” and closed the pre-pay with a snap. She tucked the mobile back into her jeans pocket and reached for her fake spectacles and her Glock lying on the coffee table. She flicked the safety on and jammed the gun into the couch cushions as she put on her glasses. She rose from the sofa, plopping the Union Jack pillow on top of the cushion where her gun was hidden. She plastered a smile to her face and answered the door.
When she heard voices, she tugged Sherlock’s shirt. He reached up to squeeze her fingers resting on his shoulder, letting her know he heard them too and to
“Victor?” she echoed faintly now, not exactly following Sherlock’s train of thought.
“What?”
Now, as she watched Edward roam around, pushing a toy fire engine around only to lose interest and start playing with an army action figure instead, she texted Sherlock notes about the child’s behavior and then deleted her Sent messages as soon as she received the notification the texts had been delivered:

He had even gotten a haircut recently, closely-cropped, just to stop his mother from whinging about how long it was. So even the shaggy ebony curls were gone.
“Except maybe a foot or two,” John joked, raising his hand high above his head.
“That’s not just feds, that’s Interpol and CIA!” Trager yelped.
“You did
After a beat, Sherlock added, a bit sulkily, “I really am, you know.”
He wasn’t sure what her original message would have been, but the message he received said:
“These lot don’t think anyone can get close enough to them for hand-to-hand combat,” Mary said dismissively.
Greg sunk down on his sofa and turned the telly on. There was a rugby game playing. Excellent. A welcome distraction. Before he could get invested in the game however, he felt his mobile vibrate. He dug it out of his pocket and read John’s short message.
They entered the flat. It was just as cheerless as the neighborhood. Siobhan must have tried to fix it up properly but the second hand furniture was all stained and scuffed. Throw pillows and blankets had been strategically placed to hide the worst of the stains on the sofa and armchairs. Posters of Monet’s water lilies were taped to the yellowing walls, probably trying to hide where the plaster had cracked. The dingy carpet cried out for a good shampooing. The coffee table was littered with take-away containers, pizza crusts, chopsticks, scraps of paper, receipts and booze bottles. Empty booze bottles.
“Perfectly,” Sherlock assured her. “It’s just a garden-variety thunderstorm. I’ve been monitoring it. Rest assured Violet, I’m perfectly content to be your spotter.”
Before Victor appeared from the shadows, there had been just something so sweet and pure about that moment. Yet another side of the enigmatic man she had been studying for nearly seven years now that she hadn’t known about. A side of himself he ruthlessly hid away from the world, hid away from even John’s eyes. But he had trusted her enough to reveal that part to her.
as she confidently strode into the back of the shop like she worked there.
Greg texted him regularly. Nothing intrusive or overbearing, mostly just, “Hey mate, checking in, making sure you’re not dead” mixed in with dirty jokes that always made John snort in appreciative laughter.
“Right away sirs,” the security guard’s chest puffed out a bit, pleased to be a part of something potentially dangerous, as if this was his chance to really shine.
“Well,” his father eyed him dubiously. “Just tuck in at breakfast, OK? It’ll make your mother happy… and keep her quiet.”
“That was very responsible of you.”
She had nodded, her cornflower eyes round and solemn.
(See the end of the chapter for
Violet turned to look at an old fashioned radiator next to her. It hissed, like snake uttering a warning before striking. Violet took a step closer, her slender chestnut brows furrowed together. The radiator seemed to be steaming. It also smelt odd, sickeningly-sweet.
Be nice.
Sherlock’s ears immediately pricked. “Missy Stroper… she told you she had experience, that she had run Westaways Cortege in London, didn’t she?”
“We’re not going to be the best company,” she had warned him through a plugged up nose.
Violet had known it was Jack when she witnessed him on the last day of the conference disregard the correct protocol on how to treat an English lord. She had also known this particular lord, Heathcliff Cullen-Culpepper, the Earl of Winchester, was about as vile and sadistic as they could get. She also knew Jack had treated him familiarly to tip him off that the American Feds considered him a Person of Interest regarding the

“Because he’s your pressure point,” Violet reminded him. “If he falls, you fall. I don’t think I was supposed to survive that bombing, I think something went wrong. But they made sure they made no mistakes with Harry. And if they tagged Harry that means…”
Sherlock, Mary and Violet were outnumbered three to one.
“He does not report to the Queen, do quit embellishing,” Violet scolded him and Dupin chuckled.
“If Victor starts hanging around Sherlock frequently, Rucastle might put two and two together and figure out Victor is Alice’s brother-in-law.

He smelt popcorn and hot melted butter. How cozy. A night in.
“Oh, right, of course, Sherlock told me but I clean forgot,” Violet shook her head. “He left it on the coffee table,” Violet dug into the pocket of her track suit jacket, which seemed a bit baggy on her slight frame. “Come on.”
After Sherlock’s “death,” she sought out her old boss, Section Chief Robert Carson, the man she affectionately called “Bear.” He found her a new persona. She rose from the ashes as “Miss Smith,” an unruffled, regal Englishwoman. Her ear for languages helped her master a proper English accent as well as using the correct British slang. She became the personal assistant to “Mr. Carruthers” (Carson’s false identity). She worked with “Carruthers” at the insurance agency he seemed to run. In actuality, it was a front for a money laundering business belonging to Jack Woodley, the actual traitor within the FBI.
“I am helping hi-”
Or how she smiled… at him… nobody smiles
“For my money,” Sherlock reminded her, his voice only slightly bitter.
She smiled despite herself. Then she sucked in another sobbing breath, pressing her fingertips to her forehead. Gladstone whined and nosed her free hand. She wiped her face and said, “Alright, alright, I know. You’re probably freezing, despite your fur coat.” She reached down to give him an affectionate little scratch behind his ear then made a kissing noise as she started walking slowly towards the glossy black door.
“Wanted to give you an update on the Cardboard Box case since Sherlock’s not picking up. He’s probably sleeping, poor man.”

“You needed him to infiltrate Moriarty’s organization. You lied to him, you told him it was an exciting adventure, lots of crimes to solve and he’d only be gone for a few months. You promised to keep John close and keep him safe. But once again, you underestimated the Moriarty twins’ level of crazy-genius. You never factored in the three snipers. You never factored in the actual injuries Sherlock would sustain by actually falling. He could have been killed Mycroft, before Operation Lazarus even began.”
“Sherlock,” John wheezed as he opened his good eye.
“Instead of the daughter of John Watson, how do you feel about the son of Sherlock Holmes?”
Meanwhile, while Violet had been manipulating Mrs. Toller, Mary and Sherlock had Toller in their sights.
“I had it,” John swallowed. “I blew it.”
Violet reached up and cupped his cheek.”I’m sorry, but… no. You can only be there for him.”

“How did you prove that, Little Brother?”
“Awards are trivial and pointless.”
Sherlock blinked. He had the strangest look on his face, the same frozen, confused one he wore when John asked him to be his best man. Then his face softened, looking human at last. His lips crooked up in a half-smile as he shook his head.
“Now what?” she asked warily.
“Leave the phone,” Violet ordered her.  Gulping, the woman tossed it back into her car.
“If you do not have anything useful to add to the conservation, please leave,” Mycroft murmured. His voice was barely audible but the effect was awe-inspiring. The agent actually appeared to  shrink visibly inside his black suit.

Sherlock paused again to fight against another wave of nausea.

He also knew if she brought up John in any way, he would become quite cross with her, something he did not wish to happen just at this moment.
Violet sucked in a breath and let out an involuntary, “
Not mixed together though. That would be unseemly.
John couldn’t wrap his head around it.
Rubbing his eye with the heel of his hand, he pulled the mobile out of his trouser pocket.
Just the mum.
Violet wasn’t sure if she should feel irritated or relieved she was being left out of this conversation. However she did noticed that while Mrs. Hooper had nodded in agreement and smiled back at Mrs. Hudson, Mrs. Holmes kept her eyes trained on the red-faced, squalling baby in Molly’s arms.
As they reached the lounge, Mr. Holmes took his arm off Mycroft’s shoulder but pulled him closer by the sleeve of his dressing gown. Lowly, in his ear, so Mrs. Holmes wouldn’t hear, he said “And I know you did the best you could when all that… ugliness happened. Mike, I insist you stop beating yourself up about it.” When Mycroft opened his mouth to protest, Mr. Holmes added. “I can see it in your eyes that you do. You look sad when you think no one is watching.”
But the hand tremors…

But oh, he had hoped to actually see John before Mycroft. Not only for selfish reasons either, not just to clap eyes on that familiar, wonderful animated face of his. To stand close enough to count every smile line and all the crow’s feet, close enough to see the small ring of hazel around John’s irises that, in the right light, made his expressive eyes look dark brown instead of the deep blue they really were. Close enough to inhale and get drunk off of that patented

Her telephone, the old-fashioned one on her desk, rang loudly. She snatched it up, tucked the receiver between her ear and shoulder. “MacDonald.”

to get caught,” Sherlock pocketed the memory stick, “The ideal tool in the Consulting Criminal’s toolbox. It won’t erase criminal records or override MI-6’s security system, of course. But it will direct you to either the website or the people who can accomplish those tasks. Find people who work at a prison or the Bank of England or Buckingham, someone who could be coerced or bribed into opening the gates. Or, on a smaller scale, say a criminal wanted to create a climate of terror in London. What’s more traumatic than murder? Suicide obviously, but what is worse than suicide?”

Sherlock started fighting against them again, hefting his hips up and down like he was performing a half-bridge yoga pose. But Violet realized Sherlock was just trying to get her to spill the rest of the smoothie so she managed to set it down before Sherlock could do any real damage. She pinned his free arm with both her hands this time. “OK, we’ll make you a deal,” she snapped, tired of his antics. “Two more swallows and we’ll let you go, but John’s going to fix you a sandwich and you will eat it, do you understand?”
“Um,” Sherlock was not used to people deducing him, “Yeah. Not the most informative of talks.”
“Sherlock, the boathou-”
“You are proficient in languages?” When Violet nodded in the affirmative, Rucastle prattled on “We spend a lot of time in France, so if you could start rudimentary French lessons, I would be more inclined to increase your salary. Also, my wife, the boy’s mother, well,” he pursed his lips until Toller gave him his martini. “She is not well. She may ask for your assistance with a few day-to-day chores. Please do not take offense if she asks you to fetch a glass of water for her or to take out the rubbish.”
“Alive?”
So it was no real mystery whether or not he was running a fever.
Violet severely doubted John could stick to his guns but decided not to press him at the moment. “OK. Any news about your medical license?”
Violet shook her head slowly. “He was a firefighter,” she reminded him in a tight voice. “He was on-duty on September 11
“Right,” John muttered. “So, just to make sure I’m clear on the facts. MI-6 found this most dangerous letter. Trelawney-Hope was entrusted with the safe-keeping of the letter but his wife was blackmailed into allowing the RHL to steal the letter. And Mycroft’s spooks believe this letter is somewhere in Paris.”

“Greg, the odds of two brown-eyed parents producing a blue-eyed child are very high though,” Molly somberly reminded him. “And it’s enough to make people start asking questions, start wondering, ohhh but it’s not the talk I’m worried about. Although I don’t fancy the bloody tabloids following him around, taking pictures and asking him questions.”
Mycroft needed her. And not just as a public relations ruse, the happy fiancée of his beloved little brother. He needed her skills as an investigator. He needed her to find out how Margaux Vos infiltrated MI-6 as well how she’d  gotten ensnared by Moriarty’s people.

And the one bookshelf wasn’t nearly enough to hold all the bleeding books the boy owned. Jack had a feeling some of those books might have been obtained via a five-fingered-discount. But they were everywhere. Stacks of them in the corner next to his rugby ball and football and more piled up right next to his piles of shoes. And God only knew how many were under the bed.
“Ten thou.”
Sherlock lifted his brows. “I’m not stopping you.”
That got the Devil’s Foot’s full attention again.

“So am I. Glad not to be dead.”
“Oh please, I used to have to tidy his room as a boy, I know what an utter slob he can be,” Mrs. Holmes chuckled as she bustled into the flat. “What a beautiful dog!” she cried out when she spotted Gladstone. The Alsatian sat up, his nose quivering. “What do you call him?”
Anyway, it wasn’t as if Molly felt completely upset about the situation. Last month, she gave birth to a lovely little boy the muddy grayish eyes most babies are born with, but also with a thatch of auburn hair, just like his mum Last he heard, she had fallen into motherhood like it was the most natural thing in the world. And for someone like her, it probably was. Lestrade also had puffed up like a peacock when he first held the red-haired baby, assuming the role of Proud Papa with ease.
“Hello,” Maggie said, holding out her hand.

She paused at the kitchen door, a mischievous grin on her face. “Forgot to tell you that you look really hot in your track suit too.”

“Yeah. Tech hacked into John Watson’s mobile while our Frog friends had him and Sherlock detained. He has loads of medical websites bookmarked.”
and then you were up to your eyes in
“Left behind in the shadows,” she said aloud as she lifted the photograph up to her eyes. “And in the shadows, you remain, Mr. Holmes. The dark is where you are most comfortable.” She squinted at the picture, as if it could answer her as she interrogated it. “What have you done, Mycroft Holmes? What made you turn on both your brothers? Is power that important to you?”
But he had perked up quite a bit when Sherlock had texted him. Pleased to hear from his… friend… John had felt quite bright-eyed and bushy-tailed until they had reached Baker Street and the thrill of the hunt had worn off.
Their mother’s diagnosis wasn’t just grim, it was downright dismal.
on an endless loop inside his head, John crept around the manor. Only the overhead lights in the lounge had been turned on. The rest of Appledore was only illuminated by the dying sunlight, creating pockets of dim light and waves of undulating shadows.
He didn’t care that John was as heavy as a ton of cement bricks when he was sound asleep. Sherlock was just glad that John

Saturday morning
“May I ask you a question?”
Sherlock rose  to a kneeling position then twirled  on his knees like a professional dancer. “We were too busy looking at Magnussen sitting in his posh leather chair, reading his invisible files. We were both so horrified with what he was telling us that we didn’t look at-”
He was not. Mary thanked her stars, unlocked the car door as quickly as possible, threw Susan’s box and bear in and slid in herself. She locked the door and started the car, suddenly paranoid that her old Fiesta would choose now to die.
“So I’m asking you, what did you do?”
“Because you need a time-out,” Dupin reluctantly put his boots back on.
She laughed bitterly as she gently clasped her dog’s muzzle in her hand, “To sin no more…”
Violet, while concerned about the inaction, kept busy as well. “Wasp” had produced the intel on Operation Raven, but it was not good news. Instead of incriminating Mycroft, it created a motive for Sherlock for murdering Magnussen in cold blood.
“It doesn’t exist,” Sherlock snapped. “Richard Brook informed me of that fact on the roof. It was all a trick, a ruse in order to coerce me into my suicide. You’ve been chasing shadows, brother.”

“Not right now, no,” Green said placidly. “She left.”
Your symptoms were inconsistent and started occurring just as I was on the mend from my illness. I also did not personally witness many of these symptoms, other than the exhaustion. However you are also an insomniac. You also had the issue of the hand tremors prior to meeting Rucastle. I was obviously and unfortunately distracted by the mess in the baby cot when you got sick at the Lestrades’. But when we realized Toller was the one burning the bodies and John told me you were unwell, I rushed to Rucastles’ Belgravia house to get you out of there immediately. And I knew that Friday you would not be spending much of the day at the house. You would be with John in the afternoon at the lido and with me at the restaurant. I knew Rucastle couldn’t tamper with your food there. Also, you had believed that the food was making you ill, which you were close, but not quite correct. You ate breakfast at Baker Street and avoided everything at the Rucastles’ except for fresh fruit and plain bread, which they couldn’t poison without notice. I deduce you also stopped taking milk in your tea at the Rucastles’ house. But Toller prepared tea the way he thought you took it, the way you used to take it. The milk is where they were slipping the poison in… but since Rucastle took milk when you first met, I deduce that Toller had slipped poison in the martini he prepared for you. I remembered you had an upset stomach later that afternoon and complained how they must have used cheap vodka.”
John startled when he felt a tentative hand fall on his shoulder. He whirled around with his arm cocking up and fist balled, ready for a fight. When he saw Lestrade’s apprehensive face, he quickly dropped his arm. “Jesus, I…”
“The historical significance of the castle, the priceless artifacts and artwork and to take the women alive, if possible,” Mitton said calmly. “Can’t guarantee the last bit. Especially if they come at us guns blazing.”
. Sherlock said so.”

“Oh… yes. That would be good.” Sherlock wrinkled his own aquiline nose after a deep inhale. “Dear God, I think I’ll need to burn this shirt. I’ll come by later tonight to pick up Gladstone. I’ll bring dinner too, to appease Mary since she is probably still very cross with me.”
Sherlock, crouched down, ran his fingers through his matted curls, trying to think…
Marie considered his proposal then shook her head. “Ten thousand Euros for rescuing Adler,” Her face twisted again, making her look rat-like once more. “I’m cutting you a deal because I detest that little shit that has her right now. We’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to new recruits,” she sighed. Then she recovered, perhaps recalling she had just murdered one of its most prominent members. She scowled at Sherlock while saying in a stern, firm voice, “But I’m afraid you’re on your own with your fiancée. I will not confront Peters.” She shook her head. “I’ve got enough heat to worry about since… you know…”
“So I should have just left him to save myself?” Johnny’s dark blue eyes narrowed.
she screamed internally. But she replied placidly enough, “I’m fine, thank you for asking. Water is perfect. I think I’m still dehydrated from last night.”
Plus, Gladstone occupied most of the floor, his long furry body on top of John and Mary’s feet. Sherlock’s feet were, of course, in Violet’s lap. Violet meanwhile had removed her sandals and placed her feet gently on top of her dog. Occasionally she would massage his rump with her toes. The dog made an almost human sound of enjoyment and twitched his tail contentedly in his sleep.
” He grabbed her wrist, squeezing so she would drop it, his other arm still wrapped around her waist as she flailed around.
“Well, if you want your good name sullied by the ghost of Charles Augustus Magnussen, I can arrange that,” Mycroft informed him as the complicated wheels of the great machine that was his mind started churning.
Mycroft nodded. It wasn’t a guess, it was a fact.
“Anyone other than me know that?”
“Forget it,” his face flushing, he turned down the hallway towards the master bathroom.
John had wondered how it was possible she had not run into a pole. Or fallen down a hole.
“I would have thought I was mental myself,” he kissed her temple then asked, “Give me a bite.”
9:41 PM
“Can you see them?” John whispered. “Can you see anyone?”
Happy Monday everybody! :^)
Her heart hammered. The desire to leave England behind pulsed throughout her entire body.
So she knew she was pushing her luck as she hurried through the narrow spaces between empty brick buildings. She kept her gun in her hand until she saw buildings and houses that actually had lights flickering from the windows. She clicked the safety back on and tucked the gun into her side holster, a present she had picked up for herself at one of Vegas’ gun shows.
“Does my hair really look bad? Be honest.”
Cautiously, Violet said “Have you ever heard of hyperacuity or hyperacusis?” When Lestrade shook her head, she explained, “To completely oversimplify the definitions, it is heightened sensitivity to sight and sounds. I’m not sure if it’s hereditary,” she said delicately. “But I can do a bit of research to see the best way to care for an infant with those conditions.”
Everyone hushed, the only sounds the rustlings of programs and children too small to understand it was time to be quiet.
“And I loathe you both again,” Sherlock groused but he sat up and reached for his tea cup. “John, kindly ask Mrs. Lestrade to re-evaluate Bodley’s shoddy work if it’s not too inconvenient for her. Ask her to find the discrepancies he obviously missed. Oh, if only I had been able examine the newest body in a proper lab myself!” he cried out in disappointment, as if he were  a small boy who missed out on opening presents on Christmas. “Very well, the cause of death is still undetermined. Why does Dr. Evans believe the burning is part of a ritual but may not necessarily be an occult one?”
Violet rested her hand on the doorknob. This time, she didn’t turn around. Her shoulders rose as she sighed heavily. “I’ll tell him.”
“Why else would he want to speak to me?”
“The adoption has been finalized,” Anthea informed him, squaring her shoulders. “Legally, the Ferriers are her parents now.”
“Ah.” Suddenly, a drink sounded
Sherlock dispassionately watched Violet tug at the electric blue scarf. Rucastle told her airily she needed to wear it every day because, “It brings out your eyes, dearie.”
“Ah, splendid. You’re not dead.”
“Thank you,” Molly breathed then added, a bit sheepishly, “Although I did seriously consider wringing your neck for springing Sherlock’s mother on me like that!”
“Richie always felt like he was an outcast,” James added milk to his tea. “He latched onto Holmes because he thought they were kindred spirits.”
It was rather comical, really, how Honoré’s jaw had dropped when he opened the door to see the Great Detective standing there, in all his Belstaff glory, filling up the small doorway.
“He’d have to get in queue,” Sherlock stuffed his hands in his coat pockets. “I freely confess that Miss Dobney’s appearance on my doorstep works towards my advantage as I plan to have her mind the flat while she mends. If I can keep Mycroft out of my flat for at least a week, I can get the rest of the listening devices and web-cams out of my home,” his eyes blazed with fury. “He’s waiting for me to slip up, to reveal where Violet is hiding.”
Finally, Violet had told Sherlock to drop it. She saw the good sense of the FBI’s decision but it still shattered her anyway. Her eyes were bright with tears as she pulled on the new black-trench coat. It had magically appeared this moment. When Violet opened the parcel and asked Sherlock why, he had shrugged and mumbled that everyone needed a good coat.
This is Violet.
“Moriarty Engine?”
He took another drag then snubbed the cigarette out. He took four tablets and drained the glass of water. He picked up his book again and appeared to be placidly drinking tea and carefully munching biscuits, breaking the shortbread into small pieces and chewing on the undamaged side of his mouth. Inside, however, he seethed. Internally he raged against Violet Hunter.
She had dyed her hair bright chestnut again.
“Not since you’ve returned from Paris?” Violet’s brow crinkled.
Still, this was a more comfortable sort of tired. A “just put in good day’s work” sort of tired.
While Rucastle continued to boast about all the dresses he had designed for A-list British actresses, Sherlock’s mind raced as the car came closer to their destination.
In a calmer voice, Rucastle said, “It’s just as well he’s up. We need to get going. I need to change into something more practical. You get him out of his PJ’s and into something suitable for traveling. Have his rucksack ready to go?”
“Absolutely no idea,” Mycroft smirked as he disconnected his call with Sherlock and hit the Line 2 button. Leaning forward, putting his face closer to the speaker on his expensive multi-line telephone, he asked politely, “Yes?”
Sleep came quickly but so did the old bad dreams. He wasn’t sure how long he had been asleep but he jolted awoke with a gasp. Heart pounding, he wiped the sweat off his face as he looked around, trying to get his bearings.
Then his eyes dropped to the floor. “Violet, I’d like a moment alone with Victor if you don’t mind.”
He meandered towards the baggage claim, but he wasn’t thinking about his suitcases. He was thinking about his quarry.
“Miss me already, dear sister-in-law?”
27 November 2015
Starts a game, immediately loses interest. ADHD?
Then he froze.
“How do you feel like leaving for Lausanne on Friday?”
“William, it’s late. You should be asleep,” Siger beckoned William to come out. William didn’t move. “What are you doing out of bed?” Siger added in a soothing voice.
she thought viciously as she schooled her face to appear placid, slightly bored even as she walked by them, giving Jack a neutral nod.
Everyone else got to their feet, well, everyone who was still living.
As John marched out of the hospital room, Violet handed Mary a tissue. An oppressive silence pressed down on the remaining three people until Sherlock burst out, “Twenty seconds is long enough to be considered a moment, isn’t it?”
“It’s about nine o’clock.”
“You can do that?” John blurted out.
Anthea inwardly cringed at the sound of her actual first name as her stepfather, Dr. Lawrence Melrose, pulled his rental car into short-term parking.
they had been on a break. “I had been thinking about the future and I decided…” she took a breath and hugged the thick textbook to her chest. “I want to go back to school. I want to be a nurse practitioner.”
John was as responsive as a plank of wood.
“It is the 29
“Isn’t it though?” Sherlock beamed, oblivious as usual to his tactlessness.
argue,” he snapped as Lestrade opened his mouth to yell. “Henry is
“’K,” Violet tucked Sherlock’s bloody handkerchief into her coat pocket. She started to follow Chibs but stopped when she realized Sherlock was not following her. “Sherlock, come on.” When he held up a pointer finger, she relented, “OK, but hurry. It sounds bad.”
“You sound like my brother,” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at her, black in the lack of light.
“All?”
His face crimson now, Gagnon pivoted and marched away, meaty fists swinging back and forth.
, about your ‘clever girl’,” John soldiered on. “That’s what you call her, don’t deny it, I’ve heard you call her that, many times. It’s your pet name for her.”
“Like what? Tattle on me to the headmaster?” Heathcliff laughed as he wiped his bloody nose with his knuckles “My father makes regular and massive donations and one of my uncles is a school governor.”
But he had only said, “Yeah, OK,” drank his beer then collected the dirty dinner plates, pausing to kiss her temple as he brought the dishes into the kitchen.
The agent had no idea why this little girl was in protective custody. It wasn’t her job to ask questions though. Plus it didn’t take a genius to realize that if Someone was out to hurt a baby, that Someone was a real sick puppy. The agent knew what her responsibilities were in situations like this.
John ground his teeth, wondering why in the hell was Sherlock Holmes his best friend as he read
“How can a letter start a world war?” John wondered out loud, privately cursing himself. He had left his little notepad and pen in his coat pocket.
The smile slid off Victor’s handsome face. “What?”
“So glad our change of plans worked out for you,” Sherlock thoughtlessly huffed before turning his attention back to Noelie. “Are you hurt?” he tilted her face up with his fingertips.
With that terse statement, the three of them bolted through Mrs. Hudson’s flat and out her door, only to find John, Mary and Lestrade lounging on the stairs leading up to 221B. Even with the heavy old door to the flat closed, Gladstone’s frenzied snarling and barking could be clearly heard. A man’s frightened screams could barely be heard over the growls and barks.
Violet gave her a stony look in return, “Right. Off we go, then.”
“Maggie Jenner didn’t work for Moriarty, Sherlock, she worked for
“That is a very fair statement, actually,” John stood aside as Mary got out. “Keys are in my pocket,” he turned to the side just slightly. Mary reached into his trousers pocket and fished out the keys to 221B. She let herself and John into the block of flats.
Still, he didn’t look like Sherlock, not really. His hair was red, not black, his eyes a dark blue, not a strange combination of blue-green-gold. He did have the same Cupid’s bow mouth and fair, porcelain complexion as Sherlock, but he had Molly’s nose and ears and eyebrows.
“What happened? Are you alright?” John stood up, the book falling to the floor with a thud.
“You hacked into MI-6,” Mycroft’s whisper slithered like a cobra.
“Is that safe?” John immediately asked. “You remember what Alice said. He’s not completely stupid. He’s… what did she say…”
“Good,” Violet grunted. “I hope you know how to hot-wire a car. They’ll be looking for this one.”
Violet stopped in her tracks. “Disney… you’re kidding?”
“Did you order extra for the new Network members who are currently residing in the alley behind the building?” Sherlock took Gladstone’s leash off its hook.
“I will stress the importance that they do so.”
“Pins and needles sensation,” John muttered as he feverishly flipped through pages, knowing he was getting closer to an answer. Now he was afraid of what the answer would be. “Always cold… like… ice… or…” His heart all but stopped. “Ice water.”
Chapter Eight
, Passenger
She couldn’t even weep yesterday when Molly finally told her about John’s “accident.” She covered her face and asked Molly for a moment of privacy. Molly acquiesced. But first she gave her a watery smile, squeezed Mary’s hand and slipped out of the hospital room so Mary could have a good cry.
just was not enough, not in this circumstance.
Violet killed Woodley, after he tortured her extensively.
,” Violet slung the backpack off her shoulders. She started at the juxtaposition the young woman posed, the spiky black hair, the facial piercing, the faint outline on her neck where a tattoo had been removed, the diamond necklace, the pearly pink mohair sweater, the brown leather skirt and bare unshaven legs. “Hi. It’s good to meet you at last.”
Mrs. Toller had been particularly fond of poison. She had made sure Violet’s food and drink had been laced with arsenic while Violet had been working for Rucastle. The poison mimicked flu-like symptoms. Even Sherlock hadn’t deduced straight away why Violet felt so lousy all the time.
“Yes, John,” Mycroft used the same voice John did when throwing a ball to Sweetie and he brought it back to him instead of running away with his prize. “That’s just it. They rarely perform the crimes themselves. They usually tell others
2:31 PM London time
And there lay the rub.
“Yeah, cuppa be great,” John sat down in front of Sherlock.
“I’m listening.”
“Now I know it’s serious,” John quipped as she poured them both two fingers. Then he sobered, “Violet, what’s going on?”
?” Rucastle crowed. For a horrifying minute, Violet was afraid he might hug her. “I need this girl. I just simply
She immediately received a scathing “Shut up,” from John.
That dead weight had slipped off his shoulders after he discovered Sherlock and The Work. Sherlock, of course, had been right that awful night when Mary confessed her sins. John was an adrenaline junkie. The service and the surgery had been his addiction. Now 221B Baker Street filled the hole in his life that sniper’s bullet had created.
But the money, oh the money, after the expenses of the medical bills as well as the adoption itself, plus all the additional expense of therapy and tutoring she would need if she still wasn’t developing as she should at her age… the money wasn’t stretching as far as it needed to go. Not on John’s salary as a professor at Salt Lake Community College.
The morning started with a grey drizzle that progressed into a gloomy winter rain as the day wore on. Cold enough to be miserable but not cold enough for a proper snow… not that it snowed much in London, but still it was utterly depressing all the same.
my intention to hurt you. It will
“Mary…” he said faintly, looking around. Then up at the garage, which was still illuminated.
He only reached for his mobile and finally thumbed a text back to Victor.
“Oh… my… God,” Mary gasped in surprise and delight. “Is that really it?”
“Agent?” Faint alarm bells rang in Mary’s head.
her,” Sherlock purred as he dug into his suit jacket and plucked out one of his business cards. “Send me whatever you find. Here’s my contact information.”
“Yes, well, I ran into a bit of difficulty, but I’m alright.” Now she sounded serious. “One of Moriarty’s people found me, but I managed to get away.”
25 April 2016
But this morning, after the nurse roused her to see if she could tolerate a cup of weak tea and a bowl of chicken broth (she couldn’t,) Mary turned the dosage down. Her belly felt like a swarm of bees had lined up and had simultaneously stung her over and over in the same spot, but again, a massive improvement from having a butcher knife buried to the hilt in her gut.
“Yes, it’s very sad, she was a good friend,” Maggie stood up, suddenly and obviously dying to get away. She checked her watch. “I’m sorry, I need to go. My break is almost over.”
Chapter Six: The English Channel.
Sherlock and Rucastle were waiting in the foyer. Rucastle actually wore a slightly conservative suit, for him at any rate. A white three-piece-suit obviously tailored for his massive girth. He wore a pretentious watch-chain, complete with a silver pocket watch. There was a lavender handkerchief stuck in his breast pocket. His dress shirt was lavender and his tie was lavender and baby-blue strips. His shiny shoes were bright baby blue. He also wore a lavender fedora that had one long streaming peacock feather stuck in the baby blue hatband.
“Wedding?” Sherlock blinked.
“Says the man who thinks sleep is boring,” John reached down to tease the Part of Sherlock that was Fully Awake, ghosting it with his fingertips.
,” she said so low, only he could hear her.
“No. He does not.”
“We both know that’s not going to happen,” Sherlock drawled then rolled his eyes. “Do calm down. I’m truly not angry with John. Disappointed? Yes, of course. In both of you, actually,” he fixed his piercing eyes on hers now.
“No,” John pointed a finger at her. “A typo is a mistake.
“How do you know?”
“Showtime,” he brusquely informed Mycroft before ringing off.
Once Anthea departed, Mycroft put his hands in his trouser pockets and strolled over to what appeared to be a small cupboard meant for coats, briefcases and other small personal effects. There were even coats and scarves hanging from the pegs.
“Well, he was the one who flipped the game board over and said he wouldn’t play anymore.”
Pity's long-broken urn,
Strangely once Violet and Alex had started talking shop, she had started to feel… better. Granted, her head still ached and her arms and legs still felt like they were going to fall off, but she felt like…
, Violet thought.
“Oh,” John lowered his hands and rolled his head away from her. “God. What did I do?”
Violet opened her eyes and looked at the blonde and the ginger (well, auburn really) across from her. “Grab your handbags ladies,” she sighed.
As Sherlock rammed the heel of his hand into John’s sternum, pushing hard and fast with ramrod stiff arms while counting to one hundred, Violet whispered, “John,

“Fish…” Molly said, torn between laughing and frowning. “Living fish?”

means?
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
So he ran his gloved hand over the back of John’s head. He wrapped his other arm carefully around John’s back, careful to avoid where he had been hit by the falling rocks.  “It will be alright, I promise,” he said, more into John’s hair than his ear. Sherlock screwed his eyes shut again, this more to protect them from the falling snow.
“Not to the people I know.”
“Then what good are you?”
“I’ll put it in the drop-box first thing tomorrow morning, I’m shagged, Missy. I just want to go home and sleep, is that OK or do I need to come now?”
“Delighted,” Sherlock droned. “Hungry?”
“That is the most probable scenario,” Sherlock opened the car door for John, “Although it is highly irresponsible to leap to the conclusions without tangible proof.”
, Lestrade stuffed the grainy photograph into his coat pocket.
people can be.”
12:01 AM
“That’s no guarantee I can keep a man alive until then,” John clenched his jaw, unable to look at either one of the two people he loved most in the world, John glared daggers at Violet, “Is that all then?”
. She touched the scar on the other side of her face, the one left by Jack Woodley.
“Put a man called Brother Morris Scowrers behind bars because he oversaw an unauthorized black site used for conducting illegal medical tests on human test subjects, primarily children but one confirmed adult, that adult being Agent John Mitton, whom you abandoned in the field, which he’s still a bit bitter about, by the way. Did you burn him because he was the one who leaked the information that Marissa Watson was alive?”
“Looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives,” Hope added bitterly.
During the tour of the house, Violet’s eyes had watered from the overpowering fumes of Mrs. Toller’s nasty
Her eyes widened when she realized the situation just got worse. So much worse.
“Thank you,” he said humbly.
“When did he start blackmailing you?”
Swallowing hard, John stared at the bullet scar.
There was silence on the other line. “You know I am,” he finally said. “And don’t “Oh John” me. We had a talk this morning, a long talk. She knows this is her last chance, that I can’t take any more deceit. That I won’t take any more deceit, even if it’s for a surprise birthday party.”
Sherlock just blinked and looked confused.
With a haughty smile, Sherlock stepped through the door, turned and walked outside onto the deck.  “What a wonderful surprise,” he started to say but the words died immediately on his lips.
. Underneath the burning frenzy of lust and desire combined, there was a strong undercurrent of overwhelming fear and sadness, a riptide threatening to drown them both. Their only option was to hold on as tightly as possible until the inevitable occurred and they were ripped apart… again.
“How else would one write sad music? While dancing a merry jig?” Mycroft narrowed his black, lizard eyes at John.  “You’re deliberately obfuscating rather than providing me clarification.”
Violet inhaled sharply, struggling to calm down. “OK,” she licked her lips, then bit the lower lip for a moment in that way Sherlock hated. “Obviously there’s some deal on the table otherwise you wouldn’t be wasting time talking to me.”
“You’re hard to find,” Sally drawled with that thick London accent of hers.
“’Nevermore,’” he finished quietly.
Even a minor government bureaucrat needed to unwind from a stressful day and every encounter with his younger brother had been stressful as of late. Sunday was never really a day of rest for Mycroft, not since he began his career at MI-6. After the unexpected and inevitably hostile meeting with Sherlock, Mycroft fled to the sanctuary of one his many offices scattered across London. At half-past four, he rang his housekeeper, Mrs. Pringle, and asked her to have a light supper prepared and waiting for him when he got home.
Across the city, another villain received the exact same text.
She knew she was better off than Whitey. He was damn lucky he hadn’t been sacked once Sherlock tattled to Lestrade and DI Montgomery how Whitey stole all those case files from New Scotland Yard. Whitey’s superiors asked him to take early retirement.
Lestrade wanted to say something comforting, but he also didn’t want to lie. “I know.”
Before John could riposte, his mobile hummed. He dug it out his coat pocket. “It’s Mary. She emailed me the information on Lady Hilda’s family.”
Violet slapped her again, a bit harder. “Where is Marissa Watson?”
“I believe so, but please correct me if I’m wrong.”
“Right,” John swallowed the lump down. “Bring our girl home, yeah?”
“Jim Moriarty is dead, for real this time,” Marie started grinding the rumor mill in earnest. “He tried to kill Holmes but Holmes got to him first. Self-defense.”
“Wrong. You will meet him for lunch tomorrow, before Mary is discharged. Tell him what you can and explain why you can’t tell him everything.”
. Tristan Holloway. I doubt very much she’s a fit mother. She actually spent some time in New York, tried to get my agency to represent her, but her reputation preceded her. She’s a party girl, or was. Failed out of several universities, you see, and she decided to give modeling and acting a try, under the stage name Trixie Holiday. I tried to advise her against using that name, tried to tell her it sounds like the name of an adult film star, but she ignored me. She thought all there was to modeling and acting was just to stand there and look pretty. Good thing she was pretty because she was also lazy, bad-mannered and demanding. Acted like a spoilt brat when she did manage to book jobs. I didn’t even bother keeping her book, although I recognized her immediately after I saw a brief story about her wedding to my father in one of the rags. I’m sure she’s quite content being my father’s latest prisoner.”
As Mary departed, Lisbeth knelt down to examine the contents of the black rucksack. “Lots of goodies in here,” she told Sherlock. “Loads of fiber optics and… hello,” she rooted around the bag. “Ooh, a laptop, fancy,” she nodded approvingly as she pulled out a thin, sleek Macbook, obviously top of the line. “My guess is they were going to clone all your devices so they could control them remotely…”
“Yes,” Violet Smith said, apologetically. “I really appreciate you letting us bring him. When the kennel called this morning to tell us we they were overbooked, I really didn’t know what to do. Our landlady is on holiday otherwise she normally watches him,” Violet held onto Gladstone’s leash tightly. Her stomach hurt as she remembered what John and Sherlock had told her about the dog fighting ring they found. She had already vowed not to let Gladstone out of her sight for one second.
Violet hit the pre-set speed-dial number for Mycroft.
, the detective thought, wondering if Victor picked this flat for just this purpose.
John knew he had promised Violet and Mrs. Hudson to keep Sherlock out of harm’s way. He knew he had a responsibility to his wife and his children, his missing daughter and his unborn baby, to make good decisions and to come home to them one piece.
“Very well,” Mycroft said indifferently, as if he knew it wouldn’t do a lick of good. “Shall we begin then,
“And it’s not just the celebrity either,” Rucastle added. “There’s… something deep… something mysterious and a little sad… blue… like the sea… and yet…” he consumed his drink in one gulp, sucked all the olives off the little plastic sword that had impaled them, then was off his chair much more quickly than Violet thought he could move. “There’s a tension within you, an energy… something
Then her heart started jack-hammering in her chest.
She couldn’t rule that possibility out. However, she hoped it was because of John’s condition.
“I’ll fetch the ice,” Mrs. Hudson shook her head, “And perhaps something a bit stronger than tea? It’s five o’clock somewhere?”
“He did, you just weren’t
The Royal London Hospital
“First of all,
“Can I have two minutes, Sherlock? Alone?” Lestrade asked.
“John?” This time it was Sherlock calling. His eyes, as usual, were unreadable.
“I don’t want to end things with a row before we’re separated for two bloody months,” John could feel his temper rising. “But it’s important to me to tell you that I don’t want you doing something you don’t want to do just to please me.”
Smut, feels, revelations, more smut and feels.
, she realized as she turned to go, feeling light-headed and ill.
“Violet?”
“Want to poke around Appledore. You game?”
“I said girls because of The Woman, of course,” John said, meaning Irene Adler. “And Janine… though she ended up not being very nice in the end. Selling those all those lies to the rags.”
This time he stopped in his tracks. This vibration was different. A pulse, a beat of stillness, then two pulses in quick succession, the special vibration he had created for…
“To make you more desirable,” Sherlock drawled. “Rucastle is perpetually dissatisfied. He wants what he cannot have.”
“Only if you have some,” he pushed the plate back towards Sherlock.
“I know.” John stood up, sucking in a breath. “So… this is it.”
Thirty-five minutes later, Mitton pulled up in front of the Animal Hospital in Falmouth. Despite how it was supposed to be closed, light glowed from the door and windows.
“Don’t fret, Mrs. Watson. You’ll like this next part…”
,” he teased her and with that he slid out of the car and shut the door. He started walking towards the nearest Tube station.
Sherlock took his mobile out of his coat pocket and held it as if it were possessed. “I did,” he said faintly. Nobody could hack into his mobile. Not even MI-6, although Mycroft kept having them try on a routine basis. “Violet kept complaining about it so…” he stared dumbfounded at the Caller ID.
“What failure?” Sherlock sounded puzzled again. “There was nothing wrong with your prowess. In fact, I was rather enjoying myself, despite your completely mistaken fears about your sexual techniques being considered lackluster and unimaginative.”
“Saint Charles Hospital,” Violet slowly rose to her feet, rubbing her stiff neck.
She got along with Arthur, even found him attractive. However she had learned the hard way not to mix business with pleasure.
Sherlock stopped a few steps behind her then softly called out, “Violet.”
have him be a sociopath because sociopaths don’t register emotion. If Sherlock’s a sociopath, he can’t feel
“You’re avoiding my question,” Violet lifted her brows, locking her eyes onto his.
Saturday afternoon
Sherlock emailed just often enough to assure John he was alright yet just infrequently enough so MI-6 would disregard their importance.
At least John would not be with Sherlock for these two months.
“Mm…” the Professor turned away from the staircase. Spying two door handles, he pulled them open, “And this?”
Sherlock chuckled heartily. “Well, I always do appreciate a good bluff. The almond scent in the air was a nice touch. But that was just air freshener. With all of these chemicals and medical supplies,” Sherlock now was the one spreading his arms out wide. He was sorry he was not wearing his Belstaff. It would have been far more dramatic. “You would not risk damaging them with poisonous gas. As much as I appreciate this little farce, why don’t you just have your armed guards come out of their hiding spots and we can all get to know each other, have a proper chat. Do you have tea?”
“You heard me quite clearly, John Watson.”
After Violet had filled him in on why she needed him at Baker Street today, he was glad she had rang him. Ecstatic, actually. He was well aware he and Violet were acting like naughty, sneaky school children, but there was no way in hell he was going to miss this.
Well, that could be a treat for another time…
She let her hand drop, “You forgot to factor in the possibility of the kid being an orphan.” Watching the kids, noticing the various degrees of shabbiness of their clothes, she added. “You also forgot to factor in sentiment and emotion.”
He hoped to appease the spoilt, disfigured lord quickly so he could resume bird-watching, one of his favorite pastimes.
“Bullshit,” Violet took another drink of her tea, wanting to enjoy it while it was hot.
He also noticed Sherlock was learning to tolerate it. The bubbling hot not-quite-jealous feeling swelled in his gut again.
Arthur Toller had shown up at 221B Baker Street, inexplicitly wearing a grey suit with a purple tie and matching purple handkerchief in the breast pocket in the stifling summer heat. He carried boxes of clothes for Violet. Her uniforms that Rucastle insisted she wear while caring for dear little Eddie.
“Hm? Oh, yes, of course, that would be very nice to have some company for lunch.” Violet said distractedly. “Would you like a cuppa?”
, can you imagine? She had to tell grown women to stop calling me names. As if we were in nursery school instead of a proper office,” and she had mopped her eyes with a crumpled tissue.
“Them, and also Violet Hun- I mean, Violet Holmes,” he amended himself sourly.

Sherlock immediately deduced “Sweetie” would be inevitably joining John and Mary at their terrace house.

, Sherlock smothered the urge to sigh loudly and dramatically.
“Great. When do we leave?”
your worthless life so do me the profound favor of
John, holding Sherlock’s violin case and bow, paced back and forth in the service hallway, checking his watch. He felt more nervous for this wedding than he had for his own. And he had been plenty nervous for his own.
… but he couldn’t find him. It was raining too hard and the area simply too terrifying.
, John realized, the weight of today settling on his shoulders again.
“… just… so….
Mycroft no longer lounged in his chair. He sat straight up and stared at the chestnut-haired woman in the chair opposite him. “We have her,” he breathed.
, Lestrade thought wearily as he gathered up the paperwork he would work on at home tonight after Molly went to bed.
“Your brain is of adequate size. Above-average, actually.”
Except the idea of spending the rest of her life trapped in a stuffy office doing monotonous work that only served to make rich men richer scared her more than the beating she received from that crazy old woman.
“No,” Sherlock purred “She
John suddenly felt like he could throw up.
. The searing pain in his upper arm and in his ankle… the blood soaking through his clothes…
“And your wife put a bullet in my brother’s chest last year and yet, he professes to still
“I have money,” he cupped Sherlock’s face in his hand and ran his thumb over his cheekbone. “I have a small nest egg, in an offshore account. Pats doesn’t know, no one knows. Well, except for you, now. It’s not the massive fortune your parents have and I will take a hit with the divorce, even if we find a way around the pre-nup. But it’s enough for us to live off in New York, if we’re frugal. And that’s including my daughter. I’m not leaving without her.”
“My brother,” Sherlock’s face darkened. “The last time I was this closely monitored was after a near-fatal overdose I had suffered when I was a young man. I’m sure my brother enjoyed seeing me strapped down to a bed.” When he looked down and saw John’s eyes as wide as saucers, he sighed, “Sorry, I thought you knew.”
“Mr. Mitton needs to breathe into it.”
”  Violet twisted around and sure enough saw Mitton lying on an olive green Army blanket, eyes rolling back, blood dribbling out of his nose.
“It was priceless. He blushed all the way up to his ears.”
“Patience is a virtue, Detective-Inspector,” Moriarty stepped away from Violet, no need to guard her now. “And yeah, she’ll blow and take you with her if you shoot me, Mr. DI-Man. Anyway, a response to your question, we didn’t put the placebos in the wrong place. Sherlock, can you deduce what we did?”
He caught up with John quickly enough. John’s cheeks were still pink but he sounded calm when he said: “Well, he’s a twat.”
And Gladstone was sleeping on top of her feet like he was a pampered lap-cat instead of a ferocious police dog.
To Sherlock’s relief, she sounded like herself at least. “Meet me out back,” he rumbled and grabbed the Ralph Lauren wardrobe bag as he did so. He paused to lightly press his fingers to her shoulder blades. Bending down to kiss her cheek, he rumbled into her ear, “You can do this. You know you can. And remember, if you find yourself in doubt or danger, at any time, day or night, a text will bring me to your side, do you understand?”
“Jesus Christ,” he groaned, turning back to kneel next to the body.
.” Mycroft continued to advance on Heathcliff. “It’s not my fault or problem you can’t find a seven year old kid.”
“Go away,” Sherlock had ordered him as he took the memory stick from Wiggins. When Wiggins offered to help decode it, Sherlock merely shut the door in his face before dashing into the lounge in search of his laptop.
“What?”
“Nice and close to Sherlock as well,” Mary pointed out archly.
“She’s dead.”
. I’ll have Lydia email you the date and the marketing itinerary so you can be sure  your diary is clear as possible for the press tour, some signings and readings at bookstores, you know the usual…” he hesitated. “I don’t suppose you could convince Mr. Holmes to put in a few appearances?”
The only people who had accompanied him now were his solicitor and his old therapist, Ella. John hadn’t much faith in either one, honestly. His solicitor was more of a paper-pusher than a litigator. There would be no thundering oratory from him, proclaiming John’s fitness to practice medicine. Ella would do as a good character witness, until the chairperson started grilling her about his PTSD.
“Sherlock accidentally cracked a secret code that tipped off Jim Moriarty MI-6 found out he was going to blow up a passenger jumbo jet.”
not my brot-” he started coughing violently. He reached for a tissue, spat, opened it and examined its contents with a disappointed frown. “No blood, that’s good for my health but boring for my research. Already have enough yellow samples,” he murmured, dropping the used tissue into the small bin Violet had put next to his bed.
Meanwhile, Sherlock muttered sourly. “It’s well past midnight. It’s the Sixth of November now. No point in repeating that stupid poem.”
, have mercifully occupied my time as well as my extraordinary mental capabilities. While I was ill however, it was difficult to marshal my thoughts and to control my,” he wrinkled his entire face up again, as if the flowers were back in the flat. “
“Yes sir,” Julia chirped, like the good solider she was. But she couldn’t help asking, “We really sure the brat’s his? I mean… it’s not like… we know the story Janine sold the tabs was bunk and you yourself said he was…”
“The good bits will be dull, so you can skip over that,” Sherlock said with his usual lack of tact. “Start with the bad, far more interesting.”
Irene continued to stare into Sherlock’s eyes. “My, my, what’s this? Your pupils are dilated, Mr. Holmes.” She stroked his wrist with her thumb. “And your pulse is racing. I think the last time you got this excited is when John Watson entered your life.” She laughed when Sherlock snatched his hand away from her. “And how does the good little army doctor feel about your betrothed?”
by any stretch of the imagination. It’s simply a case of reverse engineering in order to ascertain the cause of the problem, then remove the cause and re-assemble the remaining working parts. It’s merely a gigantic puzzle with moveable and interchangeable parts. One of the many reasons  Mrs. Hudson is so fond of me is because I am her unofficial handyman. Who do you think fixed the furnace when it broke down in 2010?” A slow, self-satisfied smile spread across Sherlock’s face. “I estimate I have saved Mrs. Hudson several thousands of pounds by doing most of the repairs for her myself.”
“Who would have just sautéed it and ate it,” Sherlock sighed. “Did Jim lose his taste for fire? He always told me he was going to burn my heart out.” As he spoke, Sherlock started peeling his gloves off. He had deduced Marie’s proposition and had decided it was a sound plan.
Violet turned away from Mycroft, covering her face with her hands, then sliding her hands up her face to claw at her hair, obviously trying to think. Then she shook her head, tears still spilling from her eyes, hot and angry. “We’re wasting time; we need to go find John.
She put the envelope down on her lovely desk and stared at it, worrying at her thumbnail. Chewing it until she realized not only did the nail polish taste foul, but she was ruining her manicure.
Rucastle laughed. “No. They’re townies. They go home when their work is done. But they are very discreet,” and with that, he immediately began bragging about the A-listers who had stayed at the Copper Beaches.
Victor pulled over at the first opportunity he had. “My father was right,” he couldn’t resist one last barb “You are just a fucking worthless junkie fag, aren’t you?”
Violet still had not figured out why Sherlock liked her. According to her original profile, it was because he found her intriguing or more specifically, found her problems intriguing. Once he solved her case (clearing her name and sending her back to America,) he would lose interest in her. The more she got to know him, really know him, that first assessment didn’t feel right.
Dupin chose to ignore Sherlock’s ratty remarks. He studied the picture on Sherlock’s mobile. “That shouldn’t be a problem, the stationery. I am most definitely intrigued however, as to what you have in mind.”
But he never really could hide his brilliance, which ended up alienating him from most of his classmates.
“Oh, right. OK. Well, not sure when I’ll see you next, but,” Honoré stuck his hand out. “It was very nice meeting you.”
John hesitated. “Are you sure we’re not going too far? This is a pretty drastic step.”
“Oh your deductive skills are improving by leaps and bounds.”
But Mary didn’t get any further than that syllable for in the background she could clearly hear the girl whining: “Mrs. Hudson, he’s being mean to me,
The room that was supposed to be a nursery was made up into a bedroom for Susan. Mary and Susie had made a day of it, shopping for furniture, picking out paint and wallpaper.
“Not at all.”
“Of course it’s about the money! Why else did you make a deal with that bastard! I’m not staying here while my children are in jeopardy!”
Lestrade felt a hot, stabbing pain in his heart. “Do you… think I’m one of those mistakes?”
But the young man… cuddling the little boy, playing with him, making him giggle. Handsome. Same dark curls as Sherlock, same almond shaped eyes, but not the same nose or mouth. Far too young to be Mycroft and Sherlock’s father… but someone both Holmes brothers absolutely worshipped. Even though Mycroft was smiling at Sherlock in the picture, Violet could tell, just by how closely Mycroft sat to  the young man and his brother, this was someone Mycroft felt close to… same eyes and hair as Sherlock… family, obviously, but how?
“Stop biting your lip,” Sherlock ordered without even looking at her.
“Erm… yes, John has the Alsatian with him.” Anthea had sounded confused, as she should.
No. Ask Mary.
Suspected RHL member/enforcer.
Such a good host.
“Oh my dear Violet,” he gasped after his laughing fit. “I thought we agreed it was pointless to lie to each other?” Then he burst out laughing again, delighted as a child on Christmas morning.
“Nonsense,” Mrs. Hooper said firmly. “What are grannies for and besides, this granny will have to go back to Cheltenham soon. I want to spend as much time with my grandson as possible.”
… but in his mind-palace, the old-fashioned theater, with its velvet curtains surrounding the silver screen and the old red-felt covered theater seats, was utterly deserted. He strolled down the middle aisle and stood in front of the screen. The lights dimmed. A projector flicked on and started whirring in the background. Soon a montage of events started playing on the screen…
Finally, I love you all (in a total platonic, non-creepy, non-stalkerish way.) The last few weeks, well, months have been really rough on me and sometimes posting and reading comments (even though I'm shit at responding) were the only things I was looking forward too... but there is finally a light at the end of the tunnel.  I finally got some good news, great news actually and a 1000 pound weight has been lifted off my shoulders! So... yay and collective group hug.
“’K, just a moment,” John turned the speaker off. “OK, it’s off.”
“Oh, you’re probably right and I need a bit of brekkie first. Did you eat?” Mary put the laundry basket on the kitchen table.
John shut up but internally he still raged at the injustice of it all.
“When are you going to see the doctor?” John asked as they watched Edward hover around the edge of the paddle pool, as if he was unsure whether or not to get in.
8:51 PM
Violet glowered at Sherlock. “See you’ve done?” she snapped.
4 July 2016
Shaky, ashen-faced, slightly nauseated and stricken with survivor’s guilt, John had sat in front of a larger mirror while a nurse held her compact mirror so he could see the reflection from the larger mirror. When he finally saw the extent of the damage caused by the sniper’s bullet, the first thought that flashed through his mind had been
“Yeah, there is,” John nodded his head then whispered. “Make sure Violet comes back too.”
“Makes a good living?”
Two marriages had actually fallen to pieces because of William’s big mouth.
“Sherlock,” John’s voice wobbled.
“This is getting tedious,” he threatened her. “You will be perfectly fine on your own.”
She swiped it to unlock it. Her breath caught when she read the message:
“Don’t lose yourself in the game,” James shook his silver spoon at Jim in admonishment.
“Hey girlie,” Peters drawled at Violet with a leering smile.
vocal inconsistency. Heathcliff smiled the smug smile of someone who felt utterly secure. The smile of someone who knew he couldn’t be touched because of his wealth, position and good looks.
Violet could only stare numbly at the raw, red gashes visible above the lacy trim as well as a few brownish-red stripes on the camisole where her wounds had bled through. “Oh my God, Irene, what happened?”
“Does your…
As Sherlock came face to face with his nemesis for the first time in four years, Moriarty did not talk about angels or the pain of living. Nor did he even say “Hi,” in that creepy, lyrical way of his. Instead, he quoted a poem as he kept a firm grip on Violet Hunter’s wrist:
Violet sipped her coffee and studied the cozy room with renewed interest now. Every time a flat-mate had fled (sometimes screaming), Sherlock had reverted the room to resemble what it had looked like when John had lived with him. She had a feeling his redecorations were totally subconscious. Without even realizing what he was doing, Sherlock’s photographic memory helped him put the things John had left behind after The Fall back the way they had been while John had lived there with him. He probably had no idea sentiment drove him to set the room back to rights, or at least what he felt was right.
221B Baker street
!” He crowed at the end.
“Yes, fine, whatever, John. Now
“Yes, of course,” Violet smiled, digging into her pockets for the change she had collected for Edward. As a reward, Violet let him keep a penny for every math problem he solved correctly.
“Well, or at least to one of the suburbs,” Victor admitted sheepishly. “I’m trying to sell her on the city itself, but if I can at least get to her to Chelsea, I’ll count that as a win.”
“He don’t mind Susie?”
Mycroft schooled his pudgy face to stay expressionless. He thought he detected a note of relief in the Countess’ voice. But most adults seemed to be relieved whenever his parents left William home instead of dragging him along to social functions. William had a tendency to act out if the atmosphere was less than stimulating. Plus he was prone to blurt out the rudest things, rude things that were usually true, but nothing anyone wanted spoken out loud… especially if they pertained to  themselves.
He was the king without a crown, the god without mercy, the destroyer and creator of destinies and the true Lord Protector of the Realm.
Shaking her head, Violet reached up and undid the topknot she had hastily put her hair in this morning. Now it tumbled down in chestnut waves down her back. Not for the first time, she wondered if she should cut it.
“Maybe there’s a reason for that,” Janine’s Irish voice cut through the morning air like a knife.
end it.”
“Ow,” she said, sitting up, rubbing her arms and shoulders where the books had hit her. “Oh, buddy, I’m OK,” she said, reaching for the dog, resting her forehead against Gladstone’s doggy brow. Satisfied Gladstone gave her a very wet lick on her cheek and trotted off to his favorite place: Sherlock’s battered old sofa.
28 July 2015
Like at the Onion Field, she knew she was worn out, done in.
Mycroft’s smile was bone-chilling. “Magnussen was a blackmailer extraordinaire. Sherlock was approached by the Lady Smallwood to take the case because her husband was being blackmailed by Magnussen. But Sherlock accepted the case, not because Magnussen was blackmailing the Smallwoods.” The cold smile left Mycroft’s face. “Magnussen was blackmailing me. Somehow, Sherlock found out and took the case for
” But before he did so, he felt several hard candies being pressed into his hand. “You haven’t eaten since London. Your blood-sugar is probably low. Apologies for not observing until now,” Sherlock murmured.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I can’t, the case, Noelie, I’m supposed protect her… Sherlock? What… what happened? Was,” John looked down at the glass. It looked like a glass of melted amber. It smelt like rich honey and smoke. Top shelf booze. “Was she drunk?” he clutched at the glass.
Remembering Sarah “Crusher” Cushing’s mutilated corpse back at Bart’s made John’s stomach hurt. The very idea of Browner getting his hands on Susan and…. John pushed the gory notion from his mind straight away. “Sherlock, he’s right. Let your brother do what he’s good at. You carry on with what you’re good at. We’ve got Browner in custody, yeah, but he hasn’t cracked yet. See if you can go interview him and find out why Browner did all those sick things?”
Self-assurance restored by familiarity, Honoré knelt down and stuck his arm into the void. “Awesome, OK, it’s not a huge drop but take it slow. The ladder feels pretty secure, but still, I’ll go down first. I’ll hold the ladder for you all when I get to the bottom. After me, then Dupin comes down, then Mr. Holmes, then Dr. Watson.
“No,” Violet’s forehead crinkled as her narrow brows furrowed. “It’s from Sherlock.”
“Yes,” Sherlock affirmed. “Yes, I am here. I am real, John Mitton. This is not a hallucination. I know this is going to be difficult to understand, but you must believe me. I am real. I am here now with Violet Hunter. I want you to focus on my voice, yes? Can you do that?”
Sherlock’s soul was as indecipherable as his heart. But he could not hide what his body had endured after Mary shot him. John finally saw the livid stripes across Sherlock’s back the first time he helped Sherlock change for bed when he finally was officially discharged from hospital.
He tried to inhale, feeling his lungs quivering as if they had transformed into fluttering, panicking wings. His exhalation was just as shaky, his chest threatening to collapse upon itself.
, Lestrade put a paternal arm around her shoulders so she wouldn’t flop over like a rag doll. Then he smiled affectionately at the back of the Watsons’ heads, John’s silvery-sandy one and Mary’s bright platinum one. The girl was in good hands.
Then she was diagnosed with asthma after another panicky ER trip when Lucy started gasping for air again. Now they had to deal with expensive breathing treatments, trying to convince a cranky baby that the nebulizer was her friend.
Sunday morning
Greg Lestrade and Molly Hooper’s residence
… he had thought miserably as the rain beat down on the pair of them. Sherlock, relying on his powerful memory, had skillfully woven his way through the darkened alleys and gotten them back onto the brightly lit city streets and pavements.
Janine thought. Still, she soldiered on, knowing she owed Sherly this, after what she did. “The thing of it is, Sally, I hope he did. I hope he was the one who sent Magnussen to hell.” She walked down the stairs now and stood in front of Donovan, the sea breeze ruffling her ponytail. “You also still think Sherly molested me, don’t you, because of those stupid tabloid stories. Even though I just told you he didn’t. Well,” she lowered her voice. “I know what kind of man Sherly was… is and he was never into… that.” Her eyes watered but her voice shook in fury. “He was a monster, Magnussen. He had leverage over me, just like he had on everyone else. So I danced to his tune, just like everyone else. I was his trusted PA who did what she was told to do, no matter how degrading,” Her face crumpled in disgust. “Sometimes it wasn’t always sexual things either. Sometimes he couldn’t get it up, so he’d come up with other ways to… entertain himself,” she spat out in a brittle voice.
“I’ll… try…” Mitton sounded like a little boy about to cry.
Irregular Opening
She trudged on, looking for a way out.
think
Posting might be a bit sporadic until work settles down or I win the lottery, which ever comes first. :^)
“Well,” Sherlock huffed. “I wouldn’t go that far.”
“We’ll live on take-out,” John insisted. “I don’t need pie.”
John didn’t trust himself to speak so he only nodded.
“Who is backing that band of white trash?”
“Small hiccup with Holmes’ brat, I’m afraid,” Jim admitted.
“It’s just Transport,” he said quietly as the cool breeze ruffled his hair. Feeling the breeze turning into a proper wind, he knew they would need to go inside soon.
“I can arrange that.”
“You should have stayed home.”
“Ahhhhh…. Of course,” Mycroft saw the whole picture now. “Since she had been unable to give state’s evidence against Woodhouse-”
“We all have jobs,” Violet reminded them… and herself.
Earlier that morning, Jimsie Browner, the daft nincompoop, had been arrested at Heathrow with the worst fake passport ever created. Maybe not everyone knew that American passports had a blue cover but even a moron knew that a UK passport cover was brown.
“Of course,” Sherlock looked at John from the top of the silvery-blond head to the toes of his well-worn brown shoes, then back up, not stopping until he fixed his eyes on John’s hands. Fixed his eyes on John fidgeting with his wedding band, “And you want to discuss Mary in private.”
sensation.
“Expecting anyone?” Violet asked in an oh-so-causal voice, setting the brown bags of hot food onto to the floor of the car and reaching the Glock strapped to her thigh.
“She can rest tomorrow, before we go to the MC,” Lisbeth crossed her arms and lifted her chin up, her dark eyes pools of bubbling oil.
But her stomach fluttered as she thought about John and Sherlock being in close proximity with each other. Sitting next to each other in a black cab, working side by side at a crime scene…
“Patience, John, I’m getting there, but first I must tell you what I have learned while you were recuperating. I didn’t tell you-” Sherlock snapped just as John opened his mouth to yell at him. “Because you needed to get well, you needed to focus one hundred percent of your energy into healing. Professor Moriarty did everything he could to break you, mentally, physically and emotionally. I could not afford to distract you when you need to focus on your health. If something earth-shattering would have cropped up, I would have notified you immediately, I assure you.” He stole a glance and saw that John’s face still looked mutinous. “I
“How else is there to fight?”
“What is it Alexander?” Sherlock asked.
John finally reached the edge of the circle, the red circle, a ring isolating the victim and her one hero while everyone else abandoned them. Interested in saving their own arses, they fled.
him.” She gave John a side-glance, “Why wouldn’t I be any different?  I mean, yeah, I had ulterior motives when I met Sherlock but…” she sighed as she looked down at her bloodied engagement ring. “Mycroft genuinely believes he’s the only one who has Sherlock’s best interests at heart, but because of Sherlock’s…idiosyncrasies, he also believes Sherlock needs to be controlled. He thinks Sherlock is a wild dog that can be domesticated.”
The child was born on Hallowe’en. Fitting, if one realized who the father really was, that is.
“Indeed, but that doesn’t mean I don’t question your intentions.”
“We’re their alibi,” Sherlock sat up, holding a thick black diary. “How could they possibly kidnap and kill a young girl when the Great Consulting Detective and his Blogger are staying with him? You see John,” Sherlock smirked as he thumbed through the diary. “Rucastle actually believes he’s cleverer than me. And he’s confident his benefactor has his back.”
“Jimsie told me he was working for the government,” Gordon feverishly told a dispassionate Sergeant Alexis MacDonald, who was less than pleased to be hauled out of bed at a late hour. But she bore it with her usual stoic silence.
Sherlock hit Delete and slid the mobile back to Violet.
, Violet studied her face in the beautiful mirror above the pristine white sink.
She frowned, grasping blindly for whatever she had touched. She got a good hold of the object and quickly took it out. “A jump drive… but…” Violet muttered as she flipped it over.
Violet’s frown of consternation deepened.
“Man-whore?” Sherlock cheerfully supplied then devilishly added, “Dr. Watson has quite the vocabulary.”
She kept her face averted from John’s eyes.
“Mm,” Irene nodded, saying nothing. The last photo had been of an empty coffin, where Peters had assured her  was she’d be spending eternity.
The Great Detective’s caring was not to his advantage nor to the Watsons’, but to the abductor’s.
That was the other side, the club. The club came before anything and everything: your parents, your kids, your spouse, your government, your religion, your old friends. The club was your parents, your kids, your spouse, your government, your religion, and your old friends.
She pulled over the first chance she got. The hysterical laughter turned into tears as she leaned her forehead on the steering wheel and sobbed. Reality hit her with all the force of a hurricane. How close of a shave she had just experienced… how shitty she felt all the time now…
But there were  some people in this world you just didn’t cross. Mycroft Holmes was one of them.
Mary frowned. Sherlock could clearly see how she was mentally adding information up and the sum wasn’t coming out correctly. “What does Violet get from marrying you?” she finally said. “Now that I know a bit more about your
“Bite your tongue, I asked Wasp to decipher it. She is also an exceptional mathematician.”
In a sad, sick twist of fate, the additional twist of the knife, Violet Hunter snuck out of the very hospital the same day John and Sherlock would sneak into it later… and the very hospital whose roof Sherlock would jump off …
“I’m for real.”
“Miss Bellamy is here, sir,” droned the innocuous, anonymous voice.
After a long discussion, Hope and John Ferrier decided to return to the United States. John was an only child and his parents had passed away years ago. Hope’s brothers and sister had scattered all across the United States and they were all married with children of their own.
That one simple syllable was all it took. In a flash, Sherlock took two long-legged steps away from the doorway then dropped to his knees between John’s slightly spread legs. To John’s surprise, he buried his face into John’s chest, tucking his black curly head beneath his chin while wrapping his long arms around his torso.
He looked at his soggy socks and shoes, tucked under his arm. He groaned.
“You know what they say about when you assume,” Violet said sweetly. “Besides, there is just one flaw in your brilliant plan.” She rolled her eyes, as she did when she was annoyed, “OK, there is a Moriarty Code, but he didn’t tell me. He told Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes is the only man who knows what the Moriarty Code is and how it works. And you want me to kill him.”
“It’s a restaurant, John,” Sherlock muttered hastily as he stuffed his hands in his pocket.
Sherlock forced himself not to react to Jim’s words. Pretended to find Jim’s statement banal beyond response while in his Mind Palace, he summoned the voices of the people he actually cared about to keep him right, keep him steady.
“John,” he gasped, breaking the kiss, feeling the cold seeping back into his bones again as he did so. “John, wait…”
“Yes, but why now?” Sherlock mused, staring off into space. “That doesn’t make sense. Mycroft said he had been sacked, that was why he returned to England. But he’s been sacked before, loads of times. He never worried about it, he could always wrangle another job quite quickly. He’s very charming, Victor, a trait apparently I lack…”
Violet had nodded. John then had told her to try and get some sleep then studied her face for a bit, looking… well, a little sad, truth be told. Then he had bent down and kissed her temple and told her he’d wake her with time in the morning to get ready to go to the Rucastles’ and not to  worry about Gladstone, he’d deliver him back to Baker Street later today.
“He didn’t take her seriously.”
“Apologies for wasting your time,” Sherlock said, now trying to squeeze between Molly and the wall to get to the door. Her office really was quite cramped, almost claustrophobic at times.
“Irene was grateful?”
“Of course, we were. It was a miracle it lasted through the summer. When my father found out though, I went from being locked in the house to being locked up in one of the guest rooms. Then he found a model that looked very similar to me, made her cut and dye her hair so it was red like mine-”
“Yeah you did.”
She remembered how she started shaking when they reached the kitchen. Her mother had a bloody gash on her forehead, but it was the gun in her hand that scared her.
First of all... thank you for sticking with me this far... especially after what I just put John through... but he does get a happy ending, I swear on the Death Frisbee.
“Neither one of us likes to admit how alike we really are,” Mycroft spoke slowly, obviously choosing each word with great care. “For example, neither of us cares to admit when we are wrong. But too much blood has been split because of my pride, my need for control.”
“Actually, that was just Sherlock,” John reminded her. “No, Dr. Evans believes the burnings show trademarks of obsessive-compulsive disorder.”
“I’ll survive.”
intentionally poisoned. Also since you have irritated me,
… in his eyes…  Violet wasn’t religious by a long shot and she had her Masters in psychology so she fully understood what laymen would consider
“Then let’s get some drinks into you,” Maggie said. “Come on. I’ll make sure you don’t bump into the Watsons or Sherlock Holmes the rest of the evening.”
“Exactly so,” Sherlock murmured, sipping at his stone-cold, sugary tea.
“Well, I didn’t know John actually meant that much to you. I thought he was just your blogger.”
“He… spoke of me?” Sherlock couldn’t help himself.
If he had been emotional, if his voice had wavered in fear or risen in anger, Violet would have argued further. But she recognized that cool, rational tone of voice and knew there was nothing more she could say or do to dissuade him. “OK,” she gave in. “Just remember what I said during the train ride here.”
And that was just for that particular Monday.
Lestrade returned to his sofa and made himself comfortable.
“John, it’s alright.”
But whatever else John planned on saying died in his mouth. A fire burned in her hazel eyes that he had never seen before.
But the stubborn man had left his dress jacket and shirt on. Considering that she had managed to convince him to at least change into jeans and hiking boots, Violet considered it a win.
Mary felt her knees give way and she leaned against the wall to catch her breath.
“Because it
“Obviously,” Mary gave John a faint smile. “But imagine all the trouble I would have saved everyone if I had.” She closed her eyes, the smile disappearing. “I told him no. I told him to sod off. I made all sorts of threats. I’m sure I sounded ridiculous. I stood up to leave. He didn’t stop me. He let me walk as far as the door. It was locked.”
“Well, well, well. Sherlock’s
The snow had stopped but the air was heavy with damp and cold.
“Yes.”
“How do you know she’s not ratting you guys out
“Time to go.”
“Good. You should never be comfortable around guns,” Lestrade ran his hand over her hair again. “It’s just as a precaution, Molly. Sherlock’s got enemies, but so do I. I’m a cop who has thrown loads of bad guys in gaol. It’s not uncommon for a crook to seek revenge against the copper who put him in prison.”
“I must admit, the ring does take the attention away from the watch,” the old, elegant woman broke into Violet’s thoughts again. “That is quite a stone there. Well done, Mr. Holmes,” Zhang Yan said appreciatively as Toller and his “assistant” came out to serve the puddings.
“Because, I…” John flustered. “Well, I led you on, didn’t I?”
No nightmares plagued her drunken sleep now. She even snored a little.
“Great,” Dimmock sounded glum. “OK, this way.”
“Do you need assistance in your escape?” Sherlock asked politely.
John respected his privacy, said that his personal life was none of his business…
“Follow me,” Marie crooked a finger. Irene summoned up the very last bit of strength she had left and followed her.
“Jules, enough,” Green stood up, hands balled. “You made your point.”
“I do not like suggesting this but what about Ford’s family?” Marie delicately asked.
“Into something more romantic.”
“It’s for a case.”
this…” she moaned.
Now Sherlock leaned against the other wall, looking at the ceiling.
“I’m not talking about The Fall,” John had played his trump card. “Or all the times he overdosed. How old was he when he was diagnosed with anorexia? Twenty-three? Twenty-four? Horrible way to try and die, anorexia. Slow, deliberate starvation. Dreadful and he
Sherlock felt a coldness spreading from his chest throughout his entire body that was not caused by the inclement weather. He also felt his heart rate speed up  as his mouth and throat went completely dry.
John watched helplessly as Sherlock drew out a snowy white handkerchief and tried to wipe his hands clean.
“I’ve seen you around. You really don’t need to be so shy. Sitting on your own, like you do.”
“Mm.”
An exasperated sigh followed by an aggrieved, “The thirtieth of June, in the two-thousandth sixteenth year of Our Lord. Does that satisfy you?”
three
She had been told her father had been very close to his youngest brother.
“Mother, I need to leave the country for a few weeks, possibly months.”
no later than July.”
But Violet knew she occupied a special spot in Mrs. Hudson’s heart because she was engaged to her precious Sherlock.
“Lestrade,” Sherlock spat out.
John shrugged, eyes down, lips twisted in a hard frown, his good hand clutching the dog leash like a life line.
He floated between memories and dreams… the silvery remembrances threading together patches of a golden dream… when he had believed everything was going to be alright… back when a wintery frost decorated the windows with icy swirls instead of the warm condensation sliding down in big drops as the rising sun warmed the black concrete of the London streets…
Then finally he dared to look to the left of him.
“She needed a break,” Violet handed the legal pad to Mycroft. “Plus Dr. Sankaran will be making his rounds soon. But she’s as malleable as a marshmallow now. Any interrogator can take over at this point. She knows we’re the only thing that can keep her safe from Moriarty.”
“If they find this tunnel, we drew them a ruddy map to us,” John reminded them. “The chalk line, remember? The one Jack had Dupin draw so we wouldn’t get lost?”
“I. Don’t. Know.” Along with exercise, Mycroft had been practicing his diction, watching the news with his father and paying close attention to how powerful men spoke during interviews. Since he couldn’t always control if and when his voice would crack, he made it a point to closely mind how he enunciated his words. He knew it would pay off when he was an adult, the ability to intimidate not just with pronunciation, but also with volume control.
Harry leaned back in her chair, arms crossed. “John Hamish Watson,” she proclaimed, knowing full well how much John loathed his middle name. “You are a fucking liar. You have no plans on retiring. You love the war. All of it. The blood, the trauma,
Sherlock froze. Then his head lolled to one side as his shoulders slumped. “Oh… fuck.”
“Are you joking? You had a
“And?”
“Yeah, let’s go.”
“Molly, I want you to learn how to use my gun,” Lestrade insisted.
Sally gave him a crooked smile. “I’ll think about it.”
“Sherlock, Sherlock, I’m here, I’m OK,” John called out. Terrified Sherlock might actually throttle the incompetent
“Sherlock?” Concern creased John’s face. “What is it? What’s happened?”
Then she let go and stood up, planning on walking out.
“Don’t you think it’s fascinating from a psychological standpoint that the only women Sherlock had allowed any sort of emotional connection to, he has also slept with?” Irene placed her tiny coffee cup in its tiny saucer, “You, me, and the former Miss Hooper, now Dr. Lestrade?”
2:43 PM
“Sherlock, you shouldn’t be messing about with that. What if you need it?”
John could count on one hand how many times he had seen Sherlock’s face  display what he actually felt. Most of the time, he kept his long, pale face carefully disciplined to show only what he wanted people to see. This time, John could see exactly what was going through his friend’s head as if he had spoken out loud…
John gave Sherlock a filthy look. Then he licked his lips and said, “Actually there’s something I need to discuss as well, Sherlock. Something… unexpected happened last night.”
“We’re here.”
biting his member, she wouldn’t regret it either.
“Took care of that earlier,” Sherlock informed her.
“You mistake me, Dr. Watson,” the Professor put the empty Army Browning on the coffee table, next to the remote. As he started pouring tea, he continued, “This is a friendly visit. An opportunity really, for you, for your entire family,” he looked up, once again the doting grandpa. “Do you take sugar in your tea?”
“What’s in a name, brother mine? You were christened William yet you chose to go by Sherlock yet your…
“… do you think that’s wise?”
“I loved the idea of her once too, I suppose,” John lowered his hands.
The smell of coffee perking and eggs sizzling had woken both men up. They had blearily stumbled into the kitchen, both acting that nothing extraordinary had happened last night. Sherlock buried himself into the morning paper and John asked Violet if she was finally feeling better.
Sherlock witnessed the moment the light died in her eyes, the windows to her soul losing all color and turning black.
“Why?” Donovan took a step closer to Janine so they were nearly nose-to-nose. “You keep telling me he’s dangerous but you won’t tell me why.”
When he came back into the kitchen, his face was devoid of expression. His Poker Face.
, Violet,” with a flawless Russian accent and a small, condescending smile.
The nightmare was always almost the same. Sherlock stood on the roof’s ledge, toes just over the edge. He could feel the wind on his face and his coat billowing around him. Then he would hop down to the safety of the rooftop, smiling smugly at Jim Moriarty, informing the villain he had no intention of jumping to his death, he knew he could force Moriarty to call off the snipers.
“Nearly sixty million, American.”
Mrs. Toller had sniffed but only said, “Well, don’t get sunburned. I know the frock Mr. Rucastle is picking out for you is sleeveless.”
“Speaking of strained, was it just me or did things feel… off between John and Mary tonight?”
“Probably not a good idea since I sent Mrs. Hudson to rehab.”
“I’ll compare DNA to confirm,” Molly told Lestrade then called after Sherlock, “But why where both ears sent to her sister if they both didn’t belong to Susan?”
“But how long did you let it go on for before you stopped it?” When Sherlock didn’t immediately reply, Violet held her lips tight and shook her head. “I should have fucking seen this coming. The only experiences you have with relationships are fucked up experiences, so I should have goddamn well known that getting involved with you was a terrible idea. I assumed John was too repressed to act on his feelings for you. But you’ve admitted to cheating on Victor so why wouldn’t you cheat on me when opportunity arose?”
“I know where it is,” Lisbeth crooked her fingers at him. “And what you need. Get the computer you need booted up. I need my rucksack.”
“You’re going to make yourself sick,” Violet had mildly scolded him as she sipped a Coors Light and picked at her cheeseburger and fries.
John forced himself to count to ten. Before he and Violet had left for Rucastle’s House of Horrors, Sherlock had texted John the new information Josie Tey had provided. John had gulped down his coffee, burned his tongue and scrawled a note for the sleeping Mary (who was Missing In Action again the previous  night…) Then he called for a cab and was en route to the West End fifteen minutes later. He had tried to ring Westaways on the ride there, but hadn’t had much luck. He hoped a face-to-face meeting would be more productive.
