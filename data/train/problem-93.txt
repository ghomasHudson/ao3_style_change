“John,” Sherlock said adamantly, his voice rumbling against John’s chest, “I promise, as I have in the past, to tell you if I’m uncomfortable. I want this, I’ve wanted this, for a long while. Just because my previous partner didn’t treat my body with respect doesn’t mean I’m afraid you’ll do the same. These past few weeks, you’ve shown me time and time again what it feels like to be loved. Truly loved.”
"Foreigners…" John chuckled at the driver then handed him a fifty-dollar bill. "That ought to pay for the therapy you require after driving us here. Sorry about that, mate, we're just newly married and a bit too happy about that."
Thankfully for him, Sherlock was able to glean from his words what needed to be done. The new angle aided his efforts, and it was only a matter of seconds before John was writhing beneath him.
Sherlock did as instructed, spreading his legs as far as he was able and closing his eyes tightly. He listened as John moved to the closet and began rummaging around in the drawers for something. He tried to guess what John was looking for, but John was being thorough. He touched and moved everything from two drawers, opening a third just to add to the noise. When all three closed at the same time (no doubt shut with a press of John’s hips) Sherlock was at a loss for what to expect.
“You’re the genius.” John chuckled, then picked up the bottle of wine. Placing a hand around Sherlock’s hip, he brushed past his partner in search of the bottle opener.
“I wouldn’t.” Sherlock said adamantly, “My suits are more than fashion choices, they demand respect and boost confidence. Each article of clothing I wear serves more purpose than covering my skin, John.”
“Through the office, you’ll find a door leading down.” One of them called to their group as they surveyed the mess.
When his lunch break finally rolled around, he found the staff room blessedly empty. Using the browser on his mobile phone, he spent ten minutes google searching for equipment. When he found something he liked or thought Sherlock might like, he’d send a link via text message. After several such texts, Sherlock replied with a single winking emoji.
The longer he stayed up and watched Sherlock work, the more dangerous blinking became. Eventually, his sluggish eyelids threatened to remain closed for good. Sighing, he stood and walked around the table, crossing to where Sherlock sat hunched over a powder blue laptop bedazzled with stickers of whoever the latest k-pop band was. He placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and leaned in close.
“Because you are, Sherlock. This is why I’m going to suggest we pull ourselves out of bed and go have a long talk about what we want from this relationship.” There was a hint of regret in John’s voice, his desire to stay in bed all day apparent. “I’m going to propose a contract, not as a binding document, but mainly as an organized piece of paper with all our desires and expectations. Typically I don’t request one at the start, but this is the first time I’ve ever lived with my sub. We have our lives we need to take into account, and a contract will help us with that.”
Silence, only broken by the heavy sounds of their breathing, wrapped around them as John bent down and pushed up the sleeve of Sherlock’s dressing gown. He delicately lifted Sherlock’s arm with both hands and pressed a row of kisses along Sherlock’s radiocarpal joint.
“Zed, when are you going to update your wheels?” Matt asked, staring at the plum coloured sports car glistening in the sun.
“That’s the thing, none of these girls know much about each other. Screen name and first names only. She told them her first name was Lilianne, which my bartender confirmed, though he couldn’t recall her last name.”
“I was afraid you’d say that,” Lestrade sighed, his fist tightening on the wheel. “All the signs point in that direction. Two girls simply vanish. We haven't had any reports of bodies matching their descriptions, which leads me to believe they’re alive, or at least no longer local. And my gut is telling me that this isn’t a simple kidnapping. Not that they’re ever
“I used…” Sherlock croaked out, unable to separate dream from memory. “I used cocaine. Powder, and stole a needle from your kit.”
“There’s nothing of use here,” He said with disgust, slamming the lid shut and passing the laptop over to the officer shadowing him. “School, work, pornography. Seriously, who downloads pornography now?”
"Normal people don't have leftover acid." John teased. Though the smile on his face informed Sherlock that John was not the least bit bothered.
“Zed, why don’t we get to the point of this visit.” Sherlock began, then half-rolled his eyes when John’s grip tightened a fraction. “Forgive me; I haven’t had a case in some time. My excitement got the best of me. I can tell by the state of your cuticles that something is bothering you. Something happened last night after John and I went home. What was it? Did someone get murdered?.”
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock shouted from the bathroom. Despite the volume, his tone was humorous, if not a bit harried. “Leave the man alone! Or I’ll mention where you were last night.”
“Oh, hello dear,” Mrs. Huson said, looking up from the vegetable allotment she was hunched over. He and Sherlock had helped raise it off the ground after they saw her struggling to her knees. “Always best to plant in the rain.”
Time ticked by with no real meaning. Sherlock’s awareness slipped into the narrow scope of John. Of his fingers clacking against the keys and of his aching muscles. His erection, or any sexual hold his punishment had initially granted, was long gone. Replaced with the knowledge that John was promising to be an extraordinary dominant partner.
“Our memories are powerful things,” Sherlock agreed, sparing John the scientific explanation. “Are these all from her?”
“Similar,” Sherlock teased, running his hand over his hip. The pants were black lace, with red trim. Where pants normally covered the
.” Zed chuckled, pointing across the bar to where a shadow lurked just inside the entrance. Sherlock Holmes stood facing the pair. He was dressed in dark leather trousers, and a tight t-shirt clung to his torso. His curls had been gelled and teased until they sat in tight ringlets on the top of his head.
“Maybe I’ll fuck you, or maybe I’ll use this flogger on your cock until you come from that.” Turning to the crowd he addressed the people watching, “What do you think? Should I fuck him, or not?”
“This is the part where I’m supposed to sum up Martha Hudson’s life in a few short paragraphs. But the thing is, I can’t do it. I can’t cheapen her memory by condensing her to two hundred words or less. But what I can do… is say this. She was a friend,” John looked at the bridge club ladies, all huddled together in a tight ball. Some of them were clutching hands, others were hugging, but they all had tears in their eyes as they nodded. “She was an aunt, a sister, a daughter,” John graced Mrs Hudson’s kin with a tight smile and soldiered on. “But she was
“Zed, come in and make yourself comfortable,” Sherlock said by way of greeting, stepping aside to allow Zed to enter. He motioned towards John’s chair, who didn’t protest at the intrusion to his property, then sat across from the club owner. John extricated himself from the sofa and dragged one of the wooden chairs over to sit beside Sherlock.
“Obviously, yes, it's hard not to when everyone insists on buying you baby dolls,” Sherlock said, making a small, dismissive gesture under the blankets. “But I mean, more recently. As an adult, have you ever… thought about it?”
“I’m so sorry, love. I've been selfish these past few days. But I'm here now. Let me take care of you, hmm?”
“Yes, fine. It’s just - are you sure? You haven’t been feeling well the last few days… do you think you should take a test? Just in case?”
Sherlock blushed slightly, looking caught off guard by having the question turned back at her. “After the, um, the kidnapping case a few weeks ago, I started wondering. And while I’d always suspected you wanted children - the way you talk about younger patients at the surgery is clear enough - that case confirmed it. Which started
beautiful.” Jo tugged her closer, her hands sliding around to rest just slightly above the swell of her bum. “When do you dance again?”
“I love you too, bee. Let’s have a shower and go to back to bed for a little while, hmm? I think we could both use a cuddle.” Jo rubbed at Sherlock’s back briskly and leaned forward, encouraging her to stand. Ignoring the mess of broken glass in the kitchen and the abandoned glass of water, she lead Sherlock by the hand down the hall.
Jo’s heart broke. Clearly Sherlock was taking the loss of the pregnancy much harder than Jo had realised. “I’m sorry, love,” she said again. She lifted Sherlock’s head and shoulders gently off the couch, slid into the space underneath, and lay Sherlock’s head down in her lap. “I had no idea you were feeling so badly. I should have taken better care of you.”
Upstairs, Jo pulled a pillow over her head to try and block out the sound of Sherlock’s heart breaking.
“Be strong for her, as much as you can,” the nurse replied. She covered one of Sherlock’s hands with her own and squeezed it warmly. “She’ll need you to lean on. A bit of pampering wouldn’t go amiss, either, I would bet. Just let her know you’re there for her, and look after her. She should be right as rain soon enough.”
the British government, and the reminder that he has a child got your attention. Then when he dragged us back to the Yard to get statements, you noticed the nicotine patch on his arm and asked if he’d quit smoking again.
Mrs Hudson knocked hesitantly on the door to Jo’s old bedroom, jostling the laden tea tray she was carrying.
“Shut up, Sherlock, one bowl of soup isn’t going to hurt you, no matter how many calories are in it.” It wasn't often that Sherlock got fussy about what she would and wouldn't eat to keep from gaining weight -- she had an absolutely enormous sweet tooth -- but it happened occasionally before a competition. Jo suspected that it was nerves, but didn't dare bring it up.
“I think you’ll know what to do,” the nurse assured her. “It’s clear how much you care about her. Just let her know she can lean on you. Now, are those papers signed?”
The lobby was nearly as packed with people as backstage had been. It took Sherlock a few moments of staring around to find Jo, who was standing near the door holding a bouquet of wildflowers and looking pleased with herself.
I've decided to end this fic here, and post what would have been the next chapter as it's own work, since it's almost entirely different in tone. So keep an eye out for that!
Mycroft, having already scanned the first few pages of the contract, interrupted. “I will, of course, be happy to assist the two of you in any way possible. I don’t believe you will require legal assistance as you are not planning to adopt, but it, as well as financial assistance and referrals to top medical practitioners, are at your disposal.”
“We won’t be able to use your brother as donor again,” Jo said after a few minutes, taking a sip of her coffee.
Sherlock opened her mouth to answer, but was cut off by the trill of her phone, announcing a text from Lestrade. She flipped it open and scanned the message. “Case!”
Jo frowned, seeming to realise she’d been a bit abrupt. She reached up and tucked a loose curl behind Sherlock’s ear. “Hey,” she said. Sherlock refused to meet her eyes. Jo put a finger under her chin. “Look at me. I love you.”
"Of course. I’ll wash your hair for you, if you like." Jo stood up and offered her hand to Sherlock, who groaned as her feet hit the floor.
got Sherlock’s attention. "What do you mean, when we get home? I need to stay and practice. It's bad enough that I'm taking such a long break now, I can't take the rest of the day!"
Jo looked at Sherlock and raised an eyebrow. Sherlock nodded back, squeezing her hand tight. “I think we should do both,” Jo said firmly. “Especially since my hCG is low. It’s better safe than sorry, right?”
Greg laughed, but he looked touched. “Jeez, Sherlock, that was almost sweet of you,” he teased. “But seriously, you two, this is – I mean, yes, obviously, I just – thanks. It means a lot that you’re asking me.”
Sherlock stared after Jo for several long moments, unsure of how to react to her sudden, angry departure. Eventually she turned to the window and picked up her violin. She played for hours, mixing lullabies with funeral dirges with the softest, saddest pieces she knew.
For once, Sherlock did as she was told. She took several deep breaths, calming herself slightly. “A few nights ago,” she began slowly, “I got a phonecall. From - from the A&E where Jo works. She’d been admitted.”
though! You’re losing blood and clearly uncomfortable and at risk for any number of infections and complications! Is it such a bad thing that I want to take care of you?”
Sherlock’s blush deepened and she pretended to glare at Jo, but she looked pleased anyway. “Shut up,” she told her, but there was no heat or force behind it.
Sherlock packed up her bag and costume in a hurry, eager to go find Jo. She was almost certain that she’d been in the audience during adjudication, but in all of the excitement afterwards she’d lost track of her. Finally escaping the pressing crowd of dancers, Sherlock waved goodbye to Molly and headed back through the backstage area to where, hopefully, Jo would be waiting for her.
The previous night, after a much-needed shower, Jo had padded downstairs in thick wool socks and a jumper pulled over her pyjamas. She’d felt a bit like she was back at uni, sneaking around the dorm after curfew.
“Thank you,” Sherlock murmured. She sipped delicately at the water before setting it aside and leaning into Jo. “I’m sorry I -” she paused. “I’m sorry for, well, this. I should have been taking care of you, not the other way around.”
bad, did she?). “Oh, Sherlock, love, come in! Is everything alright? It’s been so quiet up there the last few days.”
“It doesn't matter, love. Neither the toast or the eggs are burnt, and they both stink. Now can you please open the window before I get sick? It smells bloody terrible in here.”
Sherlock was blushing again and wouldn't quite meet Jo's eyes. "Yes, you are. You're lovely and distracting and I've missed you, but I'm exhausted and want to go to bed. Please? Can we just go to bed?"
Jo frowned at her. “Do you really want some anonymous uni kid to father our child?” she asked, disapproval clear in her voice.
“Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be? I wouldn’t suggest it if I wasn’t.” Sherlock was slightly put out that Jo thought she would suggest something so important if she wasn’t entirely sure she wanted it.
The subject didn't come up again for nearly a month. In fact, Jo had almost forgotten about it, until Sherlock suddenly reopened the discussion one night over dinner at Angelo’s.
“Yes! I mean - well, no, but - Christ, Sherlock, I’m not a bloody child! I can take care of myself!” Without having decided to, Jo was on her feet, shouting at Sherlock. She knew she should probably stop, should probably apologise and thank Sherlock for taking care of her, especially when she’d been such an awful patient. Instead she stormed away and went upstairs to her old room. The sound of the door slamming behind her was loud in the heavy silence of the flat.
Sherlock’s frown deepened. She swiped huffily at the tears on her cheeks, suddenly seeming annoyed with herself. “But you -- I --” she broke off, sighed. Tried again. “I
With that thought in mind, Sherlock set herself to the task of boxing up and shoving aside everything she was feeling: her residual anxiety and fear and panic; her grief and sorrow and loss; her disappointment and anger and bitterness. All of it, set aside to be dealt with later, if at all. She focused instead on Jo, on
"Did you know about Jo? About the miscarriage?" Greg asked Mycroft as they settled onto the couch in Mycroft’s –
“J'veux faire quelque chose d’interessant,” Sherlock complained, obviously still mostly asleep. Jo shifted Sherlock’s legs out of her lap and scooted around to sit by her head instead.
“Oh, pish. If I didn’t look after the two of you, who would? Now, why don’t you go have a shower and then come downstairs for a cup of tea?” Her smile turned mischievous. “Or maybe something stronger, if you’d like to share one of my herbal soothers with me?”
After a long moment, Sherlock felt a hand on her shoulder. She lifted her head to find the nurse from earlier looking down at her, her expression sympathetic. “I’m so sorry, dear,” she said softly. “Losing a baby is heartbreaking.”
Jo lifted Sherlock’s hands to her mouth and kissed them. “It’s a big decision, love. But we’ll talk about it, alright? I’m not saying no.”
“What would you have wanted to name her?” Sherlock asked, deciding to try some of the dubious internet advice. It couldn’t hurt, could it?
“Help me set the table, would you, love?” Jo asked, poking her head into the lounge from the kitchen. Greg and Mycroft had arrived a few minutes before, but Jo had been stuck in the kitchen making sure nothing boiled over or got cross-contaminated with the poison and antidote analyses Sherlock had left sitting on the counter.
Jo looked up. “Hi Dr Singh. Thanks for coming in to see me so quickly, I know you were on your lunch break.” Her voice took on a falsely cheerful tone. “And please, call me Jo. I’m a patient tonight, after all. And this is my wife, Sherlock. I don’t think you’ve met?”
Some of the annoyance washed away as he realized just how far gone John was.  With the right amount of prodding, Sherlock thought he might be able to win this small battle.
“Yes, I get the hint, Sherlock.” Mycroft sighed, “You don’t need me interfering this time. You and John seem to have things under control.”
"No, but only because I'm afraid I'll tear them, and I most definitely want to see you in them again."
“You’re much more efficient at warming me than a pair of lifeless socks, John.” Sherlock drawled, bending his leg to make John’s job easier.
"God, I thought Afghanistan was bad... Oh, thank Christ, air conditioning," after less than a minute outside in the full effect of Miami's heat, John nearly melted into the backseat of a cab. Happy, for once, to let the driver stow their bags in the boot.
. You won't be able to do it and remain soft. I give you five minutes before you’re hard as a rock. I think, deep down, you’ll find it intoxicating to have people watch.”  Sherlock leaned forward over the table, his voice dropping to its lowest register, “The real question is, will you be aroused enough to have me in the alley, to mindlessly rut against me until the evidence of our pleasure is smeared all over my stomach. I wouldn’t fight back, you know if you pinned me to a wall and tore my trousers down my legs. Or you could have me in them, your naked cock rubbing against the leather, denying me the contact I so deeply crave.”
Sherlock smirked as he unlocked the device and pulled up the voice recording app. Holding down the record button with his thumb he closed his eyes and rocked his body into John's touch.
“Sherlock?” John began cautiously, “Can I show you how much I love you? How deep my desire for you is?”
Sherlock’s hands felt heavy and clumsy as he placed them palms upon his thighs again. He didn’t have time to focus on how unfamiliar the sensation had become, though. John moved behind him, taking the matching ankle cuffs with him. In short order, he was testing their tightness and humming with approval.
"I'm here, Sherlock. I've got you now." John whispered, sinking to his knees in front of Sherlock. He placed his gun by his left foot, where it would be close should he need it, and pulled a pocket knife out of his vest pocket. He made quick work of the zip ties securing Sherlock’s wrists and ankles together, then smoothed a hand over the bruise on the side of Sherlock’s face.
rather than Sherlock. Sentiment, it seemed, had found him, and for once, that was alright. Even now, even when he felt his heart might actually be breaking.
“Undress me, open me, and take me. I am yours, Sherlock Holmes.” Placing a hand on Sherlock’s chest, he felt Sherlock’s heartbeat skittering below his fingertips. For a spell, the only sounds that filled the room were the sound of their breath, Sherlock’s rapid gasps of air, and John’s steadier inhalations. Then, the sound of rustling fabric as Sherlock rose a hand and wrapped long fingers around John’s wrist.
“A sex room?” John laughed, and his expression grew wistful. “I thought I was too old for a sex dungeon.”
John didn’t stick around to wait and see Moon Young to the stairs. He simply cleared the room, then stepped across the hall to kick in the next door. His leg ached by the time he’d discovered three more of the known victims, and his heart was beating so rapidly it’s all he could hear. Each step, each room, each few pair of scared eyes only served to increase the
“Mm, helps keep them from going into shock.” John agreed, remembering the time he had helped his aunt plant peas in a thunderstorm. It had been good fun for a child, getting his hands dirty and watching seedlings grow to full plants before his eyes.
“We’ll add to those as well, but that should cover the basics for now.” John read over the paper once, then gave a half shrug. “Let’s start with this, and I’ll work on a full contract for us for next week, highlighting my responsibilities, what is expected of you, how we’ll handle ourselves around friends or clients. This week, let’s just focus on the basics. That’ll give me a better idea of what’s needed.”
Later that evening Sherlock did in fact find something to do with his 'leftover acid'. John watched from a safe distance, arms crossed over his chest as if that alone might spare his jumper from an untimely death.
“Two more weeks went by, and she never came back. Her friends mentioned they were worried. I guess none of them had spoken with her online since the night before she went home with the Dom. But none of them knew her outside of their group, didn’t have friends or family they could reach out to.”
The sliding airport doors pull open as they approach. Sherlock glanced at John with an inward smirk and began a silent countdown.
With a single grunt, John came hard, bending forward and pressing his chest against Sherlock’s back, he thrust in twice more, then held Sherlock close as they both came down from their highs.
John would have no desire to take over Sherlock’s spending. But there was that unspoken level of control when it came to collars and trinkets a submissive would wear.
“Nothing, John. Just talking out loud to myself.” Sherlock called back, “Hurry up, my mind is wandering again.”
“I trust I don’t have to tell you that things have just become very difficult for my brother,” he began wearily. “Though he didn’t seek out this hit, his body doesn’t know that.”
Manicured nails clacked away at her keyboard while she updated John’s information. He occupied his time by reading over the poster tacked to the wall directly behind her. He noticed it was the same scrap of faded yellow paper ordained by handwritten words in red ink.
“Do you want to finish your tea first?” John asked, wanting to make sure Sherlock was as comfortable as possible. “Breakfast, perhaps?”
“Right… thanks,” John said with a grimace, imagining what their sex attic would look like under a UV light.
“Moon Young?” John asked as he held out his hands, letting his gun dangle off his trigger finger. The girl nodded once then glanced from John to Greg. “Oh thank christ.” John breathed, turning to Greg. “Get her out of here, then come back. If I find any more I’ll instruct them to wait for you at the stairs.”
"He has maybe an inch on me, two at most?" John said, doing his best to formulate an accurate description, "Maybe in his fifties, receding hairline with a close shave. I think his hair is either brown or black. With the club's lighting, his eyes looked black, so I’d say he has brown eyes, but dark blue is also a possibility. But he's got this tattoo on his right arm. It’s a big black inked Kraken. Shouldn't be hard to miss if she looks along the side of the bar during the time Sherlock and I were there."
"Jesus," John growled out protectively, the bruise had darkened in colour, bits of it turning green where the buckle from Sherlock’s collar had dug in. "I should have shot that man."
“If he didn’t personally see me entering Lotus, and leaving with you, one of his minions has certainly told him by now. Mycroft is aware of my
“This is all Greek to me,” Greg said when he got close enough to the party. “But Jesus, Sherlock, you should show up to a crime scene like that. Anderson might implode upon himself out of sheer shock. You know he calls you a virgin, right?”
“Yes, Sir, I understand. I was snarky, demanding, and went above my position. It is not my place to bring you to your knees. Rather, it is my privilege to show you how well I can follow out your orders. I apologize for stepping out of line, and thank you for punishing me in a fair and just manner.” Sherlock said in a meek voice, trying not to sound as sincere as he felt. His voice cracked for misuse and thirst. He wanted to ask for a drink, but he sensed this lesson wasn’t over just yet.
“John,” Arching an eyebrow, Sherlock used John’s first name to get his attention then added, “Sir. I promise you now that we can discuss this another time. Right now, I feel as if a wound has been ripped open, and I would rather like someone to comfort me. That someone, being you, John.”
“Could do it just for fun, we could go to the Diogenes. You could gag me, make sure I don’t talk.” Sherlock said to John while casting his brother a wink. The smile fell from his face, however, when Mycroft's latest words registered. When his brother snorted and waved the paper in the air Sherlock stopped his teasing and gave the report a once over.
“Right, rules are simple then. Fifteen minutes or the sub to hold themselves up off the chair the longest wins. Do you need a moment to explain the position?”
Sherlock nodded quickly, which John acknowledged by humming softly. The sound of metal clinking together filled the room, then John’s hand was on Sherlock’s wrist. One at a time, he lifted Sherlock’s arms, bending his elbows until his arms were held out at a ninety-degree angle in front of him, wrist facing away from his body.
“Prat,” John mouthed, more than said out loud, earning himself a rare smile that made the corners of Sherlock’s eyes crinkle.
“I can’t wait to use these,” John said in a husky voice, looping both of his index fingers through the O rings. “Now, to get you dressed. Can I pick?”
Sherlock spun in a small circle then, when he faced John again, smirked and lifted the front of his leather skirt.
“Not having you pulled right out from under me,” John said, gently cupping Sherlock’s face when the cuff was on and locked into place. “Now we’re bound together.”
He shouted, trying to be heard over the noise of the traffic and the din of the people on the sidewalk. Just as Sherlock was shoved into the van, their eyes locked.
John didn’t start off slow, but he was careful to keep his movements shallow. Holding Sherlock’s hip still with his right hand, he increased his speed every dozen or so thrusts.  It wasn’t long until the sounds of their grunts were mixed with the thumping of the headboard against the wall. Once or twice John forgot to move his left hand, but Sherlock would remind him by thrusting his cock into John’s fist.
“Right, thanks,” nodding briskly, he turned his attention back to the eggs before his blush could be detected.
“So they say,” John grinned back, ignoring the twinge in his shoulder, “Was a close one, for a bit. Don’t get shot.”
“I’m trusting him,” John repeated, “Thought if I ever cross paths with the cunt who hurt him, there will be a body to hide.”
there,” John said through gritted teeth, “If you want your nose to remain in its unbroken state, you will stop right there and not say another word. Sherlock told me it wasn’t rape, and while I have no proof, I trust him.”
“What, spanking as a punishment is too good for you?” Sherlock griped, outwardly unhappy but secretly pleased at John’s list of punishments. They were creative, with just the right amount of denial and humiliation to make Sherlock think twice before stepping out of line. They showed him that John could think outside of the box and that brute force wasn’t his fallback punishment.
Despite his protests, the chemical continued on with its treacherous path, wreaking chaos in destruction in every cell of his body.
Everything happened in slow motion. One moment Sherlock was using every muscle in his lean body to drive John insane, quite evident by the way his cock was tenting his dark jeans. The next he was watching Sherlock being dragged out of their car and into a van that had pulled up beside him.
Once Sherlock could sit again, John carefully pulled the condom off of himself and zipped up his trousers. Tossing the condom, and the wrappers in his pocket into a nearby bin, he pulled Sherlock to his feet and fixed his skirt. Ignoring the crowd, John looked over to Lydia and Zed, seeing that they hadn’t quite finished yet. Deciding to give them the rest of the spotlight, he pulled Sherlock off the platform and allowed one of Elvio’s bouncers to escort them through the club and into one of the back rooms. Once they were alone, John pulled Sherlock into his arms and held him as tightly as he dared.
Sherlock swallowed hard, realizing that they were about to put into practice what they’d just discussed. Excitement jolted down his spine, and he had to bite back the demand that John hurry it up and get on with the sex already.
“Show off a bit,” John whispered as he approached, his back turned to the room so only Sherlock could see his lips. “Hold the position until I have your arms and legs free.”
“I’ll teach you if you think you can handle me.” Sherlock’s tone was cocky, and John couldn’t help but wonder how good a dancer Sherlock was. His body was lean and his movements graceful, and it wasn’t a stretch to imagine his hips swaying to the music.
“What, what’s the matter?” John was by his side in an instant. He crouched in front of Sherlock and put his hands on his lover’s knees. “Sherlock?”
“He’s the best,” Sherlock agreed while handing John’s jumper back to him, “Undamaged, for now. Though I feel an experiment involving acid coming on.”
“Is Jim okay with you tasting the product before delivery?” Sherlock asked sluggishly, willing his brain to work faster. He needed to find a way out of here, but couldn’t, not when the world was still fuzzy.
“If you’d like, we can get you a discrete collar to wear in public. There’s a shop online that makes excellent locking bracelets made out of leather and a thin metal band. Easy enough to hide under your cuffs, less conspicuous than a collar, especially in the summer.”
Reaching for it with the intent of putting it back on, he paused, thinking better of it. He’d already made a mess while cooking out of his earlier outfit (pyjamas, thankfully), now dressed in a nice shirt and slacks, he didn’t want to transfer the mess on the pinny to his clothes. Balling it up, careful to roll the worst of the mess into the center of the bundle, he deposited it into the laundry in the bathroom.
“You’ve now mentioned at least twice that your mouth has uses other than getting you into trouble,” John stated, taking one step forward, so he was standing between the doorframe.
“Yet here I am,” Sherlock called out while folding his arms behind his back. “Will you send me away, or is my money still good?”
"Oh, John," Sherlock breathed, taking himself in hand and pressing his crown against the tight ring that separated him and John from becoming one person. John wiggled his hips encouragingly then locked eyes with Sherlock. They shared a look that expressed everything words could not at that moment.
Mycroft motioned to a board behind him, on which were dozens of photos of the missing men and women the Met had compiled.
“Hardly seems appropriate,” Mycroft said with a small smile. “Why ruin a good thing. Please, call me should either of you require anything. I’ll stop by in the morning to update you on the raid and the contents of that vial you recovered.”
“How are we doing this, John?” Sherlock asked, rising to his full height and circling the platform once again. This time John followed quickly, letting the chain go just tight enough that it wasn’t dragging on the floor.  “Will you have me cuffed to the wall when people start to enter, will we mingle, or do you want me on my knees?”
“Would you?” John breathed, nuzzling his nose against the back of her neck, “If I asked, would you suck me off in front of Sherlock?”
“A bit of both?” Sherlock shrugged, “Keep an eye on me when we’re home, so I don’t slip off. If we go out, remind me of our rules. Don’t let me out of your sight. You can threaten  me with my brother, and rehab, if you need.”
“Dressed like what?” Sherlock asked with a soft chuckle, not bothering to hide his amusement. While not as flashy as the last outfit he’d worn to Lotus, his current ensemble had made John’s head snap up and his jaw drop. Tonight’s outfit was one he’d been most anxious to try out on John. As it turned out, dressing up for John had quickly become one of his more favourable experiments.
“And they call me the genius,” Sherlock gasped out while clinging to John for support. “Take me to bed, Husband.
“Yes, and last week all you picked out was gingernuts and hundreds and thousands biscuits. I still don’t know what you’ll
“Breathe, Pet. I need you focused.” He whispered, stroking his finger along the inside of Sherlock’s arm after tying off the knot. “Breathe with me, watch me,” he urged gently.
“Ta,” John said to Greg, aware that the man was doing his best to make John feel more comfortable. Then turning to Sherlock, said, “Against the wall, arms cuffed above your head. Arse out. I’ll just leave you there until we have a bit of an audience, then I’ll take our flogger out for a spin. Use your safewords tonight, red and yellow. Just because we’re here for business, not pleasure, doesn’t mean I want you pushing yourself.”
“I do, because you are not him, John. You are the man who has proven himself to be on my side since the moment you lent me your phone at Bart’s. And you only cemented that proof further the very next day when you shot the cabbie.”
After a short talk with Zed, John replaced both hands in Sherlock’s hair and filled him in on the other half of the conversation.
"Mm, get some sleep, John," Sherlock said, lifting his head a fraction and distractedly kissing the air in the general direction of John's face. Though he missed his mark by a mile, John hummed appreciatively as he pulled away. He looked up and watched John as he retreated tiredly down the hall.
“That’s not the saying,” John said, his lips twitching up into a smile. Sherlock’s rumbling chuckle helped to soften the edges of his anger, “but thank you. It made me laugh.”
“I don’t mean I’ll ask you to sign your body over to me, but a contract can be helpful. It will allow us to outline our Hard and Soft limits, likes, desires, and goals. I can’t memorize things quite as easily as you can. Having it written in black and white will help keep me on the right path. Part of what I intend to put in the contract is this: our relationship as dom and sub will not interfere with The Work, nor will I start giving you orders in front of Greg or anyone else from New Scotland Yard. Now, as you’ve so kindly listened to my verbal dump, I will sit back and give you the floor.”
“What was that all about?” Sherlock asked as he curled his arms around John’s shoulders, holding tight.
Only instead of meeting storm blue eyes and a disappointed frown, the gaze that met his was black as night. Jim Moriarty stood with his hip leaning against the doorway. As casually as if he belonged inside Baker Street. His midnight blue suit looked almost black in the dim light, and the shadows from the hall caused the twisted grin on his face to ooze a mix of lust and hatred.
Every brush of Sherlock’s fingers against his skin felt like the kiss of a warm flame. Closing his eyes, he imagined he could feel Sherlock’s eyes searing into his very soul as the buttons on his shirt were slowly worked open, one by one. He was already hard by the time Sherlock’s hands pressed against his sternum, coaxing his shirt over his shoulders. With a soft whisper, the shirt joined Sherlock’s belt.
enjoy being beaten, and he is a doctor who has legal obligations to uphold. We enjoy light flogging, and while I can’t wait for my first chance to choke on his cock, he is a perfect gentleman. Speaking of John,” Sherlock said, ignoring the gagging noise coming from his right, “I should text him.”
“John…” Sherlock gasped as John closed in around him, one hand planted on the wall beside his left shoulder.
to care for me.” He held both hands up in the air and let out a frustrated grow. It wasn’t often that words failed him, and it was clear as day that it was important to him that he gets this right. “I want this, you as my dom,” he clarified, “without losing myself. I don’t want to compromise The Work or lose track of the feel of London.”
“Her name?” Sherlock asked, already sorting through the list of cases Lestrade had worked on over the past six months.
“Robin’s egg blue, to bring out his eyes, and lighten his features.” Jesper nodded, pleased with Sherlock’s choice. “You would have made an excellent tailor.”
“My submissive has already been told that he can only orgasm if he achieves subspace,” John explained to the crowd over the sounds of Sherlock moaning around his finger. “If anyone would like to help out, the rules are as follows. His cock is off-limits, you can touch his back, shoulders, and nipples. Gentle touches only, if I see anyone getting rough or handsy with him, Elvio will be showing you the door. His face and hair are completely off-limits as well. I want him to come from being fucked, and that alone. No more than three touching him at a time, so don’t hog the space.”
Sherlock brought the glass to his lips and audibly sighed as the liquid trickled over his tongue. His eyes fluttered, and his chest strained against his shirt. Heat pooled in John’s groin, and he had to stamp down the desire to reach out across the table to taste the whisky on Sherlock’s perfect lips and tease them until they were red and swollen.
“Sherlock,” John sighed, reaching up and covering Sherlock’s hand with his. He opened his mouth, clearly about to say something, but Sherlock didn’t give him a chance.
John was awoken at two am by cold feet and an even colder nose pressing against him, sapping his body heat away. With a yelp, he sat up and swatted the laughing man beside him.
“Yeah, well, I’ve only known him six months, and he annoys the hell out of me. I can’t imagine how yo- Wait… did you say?”
“Mmm, you strike me as having more of a praise kink,” John commented gently, “we’ll just say no on humiliation for now. Sherlock, come here.” The order was given gently, but Sherlock’s head snapped up from the spot on the carpet to meet John’s eyes. Before he had time to register what he was doing, he was on his knees between John’s legs, gazing up at him in wonder.
There were a couple of boos from the crowd, but otherwise, Elvio’s rules were met with general acceptance. John’s nerves were back, and he found looking at the crowd to be a bit too overwhelming for him. Instead, he turned to face Sherlock and stroked a hand down his back.
“You, playing the role of handyman. Is this the part where I’m supposed to come up and just randomly start sucking on your dick?”
“That’s a good man.” John squeezed Sherlock’s thigh as he stood up, then gave his hair one more quick ruffle before accepting a long pole with a hook on the end. Selecting a length of red rope, John draped the middle of it over the hook, then, by lifting the poll in the air, fed the rope through the ring on the ceiling. Once the ropes were in place, the pole was whisked away. John took both ends of the rope and held it in the air directly in front of Sherlock’s mouth.
John quickly pulled the keys out of his pocket and motioned Sherlock over. “Sit here,” he said, pressing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and guiding him to the bed. He bent Sherlock’s neck with firm hands, so his chin touched his chest, then slid the key into the padlock at the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“Lestrade, he was the D.I.” John murmured, the pieces of the puzzle slotting into place, “and that’s why you shut me down at Angelo’s. It was too soon.”
Sherlock took a few backward steps towards the bathroom then a coy smile stretched across his face. An elegant hand dipped between his legs, and long fingers gathered his balls into their grasp.
My cock is going to be your favourite treat by the end of our holiday. Now, John,” he said as the traces of amusement left his face, “do you want this?”
They had fallen asleep with arms and legs tangled together. However, throughout the night, they had both drifted off to separate sides. Sherlock had burrowed himself under all but one of the blankets and lay on his stomach in his self-made cocoon. His face was turned towards John, and one hand reached out through the barrier of bedding and rested inches away from John’s hip.
“Zed?” Sherlock asked, raising an eyebrow quizzically at his partner while finding an outlet and plugging the laptop in.
“Enjoy? John, you were singing my praises louder than you have at any crime scene. If I had known that’s all it took, I would have bent you over your chair your first night here.” John chuckled, and Sherlock felt the vibrations against his ribcage. It was wonderfully intimate, and he wondered how anyone in their right mind could wade through life without having access to that feeling. “Here I was, taking you to crime scenes to impress you. All you needed was a good solid fuck.”
“Well, if that’s the case, if you’re well enough,” Mycroft reached inside his coat and pulled out an envelope. “Two tickets to northern China,” he explained. “We’ve traced three young men to that location. The plane leaves first thing tomorrow morning.”
John’s eyes drifted over to the hook that held Sherlock’s scarf and coat. It would be one thing to have Sherlock wear his collar
"Then find my prostate, Doctor," Sherlock said slyly while wrapping a hand around his cock. "Or do you not remember how to give a prostate exam?"
“Excuses, excuses,” John sang out, reaching for the rope held between Sherlock’s teeth. In a lower register, he added, “Your trousers already do very little to hide your cock. What I’m going to do will only emphasize your bulge. It might even show a bit of definition. Are you okay with this, Pet?”
As Zed fished the item from his pocket John glanced up at the driver and saw the man already talking into his mobile.
“Now, I’m afraid we just have to wait while we track down the leads we know of, recovering those who were sold off, and hoping we uncover more in the future. The American government, along with three other countries have representatives on the way, more than one individual is not native to England. Hopefully, with extra hands, your workload will be light.”
With the same level of care and almost religious attention, John swapped out the red collar for the new one. It was half leather, half chain, with the chain attached at both ends by two O rings. It was a perfect compromise, in his opinion. He’d wanted to see Sherlock in a complete chain collar for this stage but understood that, from a sensory viewpoint, it wasn’t pleasant for everyone.
While it weird, to look up and see a group of men cheering them on for doing something as primitive as fucking and orgasming. John found he loved it. He loved seeing Sherlock so blissed out by something as simple as an audience. It was like his brilliant deductions, they were always more elaborate and showy when he had people’s attention. John smiled tiredly at the crowd before sitting down beside Sherlock and pulling him into his arms.
“Yeah. A mate got us invited back when we were in uni. We were young things, all of us pains in the arse. I thought this would be a good way to get our pent-up aggression out. Zed saw something in me and sort of mentored me. He taught me to be kind, respectful and that bondage isn’t always about shouting orders. Honestly, I used his lessons daily while I was abroad.” John smiled, glancing over to the corner of the room Zed had occupied with his crowd of followers.
The owner himself stood in the center of a semicircle of people. He was dressed in his signature plum suit. He had his hand on the shoulder of a woman roughly John’s age. She was upside down, hanging from a series of hooks and pulleys in the ceiling. Her blond hair hung loose and brushed against the floor as Zed gently swung her back and forth. Strong muscles glistened where her modest bodysuit didn’t cover flesh. John felt a jolt of desire rush through him at the sight. With a small amount of effort, John pushed his way through the moderate crowd to get a better look, only stopping when he was a few feet away from Zed and the woman.
Scrambling to his feet Sherlock followed John up to the second floor, his fingers working the buttons of his shirt as we went. By the time they’d reached the uppermost floor, all that remained to be taken off was Sherlock’s trousers and shoes. Shucking them off, he left his clothes in a pile at the door and reached in, feeling around the hooks on the other side for his cuffs. Once he had them he handed them over to John and presented his wrists. The moments the cuffs were secured, John used the rings on each cuff to pull Sherlock into the room. He dragged Sherlock over to the bed, then released his grip.
I really **REALLY** had fun letting Sherlock be in charge for this chapter. Apparently, John enjoyed himself as well.
"Florida isn't known for its tepid weather, John. Come on, let's get a taxi. Even I require shorts."
“Twenty-four hours.” John said, looking at his watch, “Tomorrow afternoon. We’ll round down and say One pm.”
"Sherlock, love. We've got to be quiet. I still have to get you out. Let's play a game, yeah?" John eased them both to their feet. With his gun in his dominant hand, he wrapped his right arm around Sherlock's waist. "Let's see who can be the quietest until we find Greg. Okay?"
“Greg, don’t tempt him,” John groaned, “All I need is for him to trade in his suits for itty bitty lace outfits.”
“Oh, fuuc…” Sherlock swore as he gripped John’s arse tight as John’s muscles contracted around him. With a low grunt that matched the mewls escaping John’s lips, he came inside John for the first time, feeling John’s body wrap around him with each pulse. He collapsed on top of John, who merely grunted and stretched his legs out against the bed.
Smirking, John pushed himself up off the counter and walked towards Sherlock. Placing both hands on Sherlock’s biceps, he looked up into sharp silver eyes and, with a semi-straight face, whispered, “Sherlock Holmes, will you be my bae?”
“Touch me, kiss me, show me who I belong to,” Sherlock asked in a voice that dripped over John like melted chocolate. It was deep, rich, lush. If velvet and honey had a baby, it would have been Sherlock’s voice at that moment.
“Fuck off, Mycroft,” John repeated and stuffed his free hand into his pockets before he became tempted to flip Mycroft off to his face. The rain, which had become coming down in fat heavy drops, pinged against the taut fabric of his umbrella, nearly drowning out the pinched sigh that preceded Mycroft’s words.
“I love you so goddamn much, Sherlock. Whatever is about to happen with Moriarty, I need you to know that I’m on your side. Whatever you need, just ask. I’ll do
“That was rather the point,” Sherlock complained, more than a little annoyed that John has managed to maintain enough of his senses to stave off his orgasm.
“Yeah…” John tried to take a step towards the car when his left leg buckled. He held a hand out to his side to adjust his balance and Zed caught it. “Ta,” John mumbled as he moved, with Zed’s help, to lean on the car. “I... it's just, god they got him. I mean I knew they would, but drugs weren’t part of our equations.”
Sherlock pulled off his cock with a wet pop, then turned to meet Greg’s eyes as the D.I.’s hands disappeared from his hair.
“Place a bead of hot glue on the inside. It will keep the straps from slipping.” Sherlock offered, watching her out of the corner of his eyes while John led him onto the raised platform. John released his grip from Sherlock, but not before giving it a quick squeeze.
“As an example, if you were to order me to take out the trash, I would not get an erection.” Sherlock tilted his chin up and grinned, “but, if you were to tell me to kneel, close my eyes and open my mouth, I would quite possibly be hard before my knees were touching the floor.”
“I know the memory brings you no small amount of discomfort, and I’m sorry for the pain you endured. But, John,” Sherlock let go of the tags and leaned forward on his chair. He placed the flat of his palm over John’s shoulder, just above the scar that remained as a painful reminder. “I admit that I am thankful, even if that makes me a selfish man. Without the events of our past, it is safe to say neither of us would be standing here today.”
“He’s right, pet.” Zed agreed. Sticking his hand down his collar he pulled out a chain, similar to the one John kept around his neck. He motioned for Lydia to turn. Then, taking her collar off, he handed it, and the padlock, to his submissive before lowering his neck. “Your turn.”
He was just putting plates on the table when he heard John calling a greeting to Mrs. Hudson. Pausing, a pair of potholders in hand, he listened to John mount the staircase.
eat when it comes to meals.” John sighed, scratching his eyebrow, which typically meant he was thoroughly perplexed. “When it comes to junk food, you’re as predictable as a teenager, but,” John threw his hands up and sighed, “do you like chicken, beef, pasta? I still haven’t figured it out.”
“No, I would not. I would like my bossy and sumptuous sub to learn his place. I had such high hopes after last night,” John said. The disappointment in his voice caused Sherlock to wince in regret.
“Yeah, alright.” John kissed Sherlock’s thigh then pushed his index finger all the way inside. “How’s that? Too far?”
"You've got that right." John gruffed out, slotting their noses together and leaning up on tiptoes for a kiss. "Let's go. You have the tracker?"
“Ta,” John held out his mobile, pulling up the picture Zed had sent him a short while ago. “This man had more than a keen interest in Sherlock the last two nights. Zed has never seen him before and he snuck past security at Zed’s club. Can you just… run a search on him?”
"My sister has always been rather more soft-hearted than she would like the world to believe," Mycroft said cryptically.
“You've never complained about normal smells before,” Sherlock pointed out, turning to peer intently at Jo.
“Uh huh. And I’ve been doing some research -” Jo gestured to the papers and notes scattered on the table “- and asking around, and…”
“Well,” Jo started, hesitant, “you wouldn’t be able to chase criminals all over London once you started to show. Even before that, it may not be safe. And you’d have to stop experimenting with anything toxic.”
"Ms Holmes, I'm calling from the A&E department at St Bartholomew's. Your partner Johanna Watson is here."
“I don’t believe Johanna would have been inclined to try again, had it not been for my sister’s influence.”
"Yes, please. It helps me sleep, and I don't really want to go to bed with it wet, even if it's just for a nap." Sherlock sat on a pillow on the floor, between Jo's knees, while Jo brushed through her hair again, sorting it into neat sections to braid. She had never gotten the hang of braiding her own hair, but her short, capable fingers made quick work of Sherlock's curls, even on days when they were being particularly unruly.
“No, no…” Jo murmured. “No, sweetheart. Don’t apologize. Shh, no. I wanted to, love. I wouldn’t have said yes if I hadn’t. Shh…” she trailed off, drawing Sherlock closer, into her lap, and rocking her slightly. “It’s alright, sweetheart. Shh, it’s okay now. I’ve got you.” Sherlock was shaking in her arms, her thin shoulders heaving as she fought to draw breath. Clearly, Jo thought, it wasn’t just guilt about having asked Jo to carry their baby that had her in tears -- it was likely
The professor took a step forward, frowning thunderously at the continued interruption. “Holmes, you have yet to demonstrate why any of your leftist idealism is relevant to my lecture today. I must insist you stop interrupting, or I will have to ask you to leave.”
Jo looked up from where she was picking at the soup Mrs Hudson had handed her, her face paling. “How…” she stopped and swallowed hard. “How much did she tell you?”
“Terribly sorry,” Sherlock rejoined, not sounding the least bit contrite. “Should I take you home and nurse you back to health?”
“I insist, stay for a cup of tea at least. Better to wait it out than have a mug thrown at your head.”
"My feet hurt," Sherlock pouted, "it's distracting." She pulled her knees up -- as much as she could with Jo practically on top of her -- and, petulantly, let them flop down again.
Jo rushed to catch up with Sherlock outside of the hall, wanting to make sure she was alright after the shitshow the lecture had turned into.
Jo did, inhaling shakily. Behind her, Sherlock nodded. “Good. Hold it… two… three… good, let it out, slowly.”
“They’re beautiful, thank you.” Sherlock buried her nose in the flowers to hide her blush as Jo’s hands settled, low and possessive, on her hips.
Sherlock shifted to sit in a chair next to the bed rather than halfway in Jo’s lap, but didn’t let go of her hand. “Alright?” she asked.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Mycroft replied primly. “I’m looking forward to seeing the look on your face far too much.”
“Oh, bee, no. That’s not us. You’ve taken such good care of me, and from now on I’m going to take care of you.” Jo took Sherlock’s hand, raised it to her mouth, and kissed her wedding ring, the palm of her hand, her wrist. “I promised you, the day I put this ring on your finger, that I would always, always take care of you. I’m sorry you’ve been anxious about this, but you don’t have to be. I love you, and nothing can change that.”
Luckily, the house wasn't very big; Jo made it outside and around the corner from the crowd of police and nosey neighbours before throwing up. She stumbled on - something? A tree root? - and fell, still gagging. When her stomach finally stopped heaving Jo rolled away from the mess and curled up on her side, determined to lay there and sulk until she felt a little bit better. Or at least until her head stopped spinning.
Sherlock looked like she wanted to protest, but before she got the chance they were upstairs and Mrs. Hudson -- who, it seemed, had let herself into the flat again -- was fluttering out from the kitchen and fussing at them.
Jo's arms wrapped around her waist and squeezed gently. "Do you still want to watch a movie, or do you just want to go to sleep?"
Sherlock leaned down and smoothed Jo’s hair back, pressing a kiss to her forehead. “It’s on its way. I brought you pyjamas, if you don’t want to put your street clothes back on.”
"Thank you." Sherlock got to her feet and stretched, her hands above her head and her back arched as far as it would go, her spine clicking as the vertebrae realigned themselves.
“I caught you watching him again today, judging his looks and apparent health. I don’t even think you were aware of it, but you kept looking from him, to me, and then down at yourself. And I know you’re not interested in him sexually or romantically, which means you weren’t checking him out. He’s not visibly injured or ill, so not a professional interest then. The only explanation is that you were considering asking him to be our donor. Simple, really.”
“Sorry, love, it’s my only night off this week. I didn’t want to be on call during what could be one of the most important conversations of our life.”
“…yes. I’m fine, thank you. Although,” she paused, her mouth curling up on one side in a wry smile, “that’s definitely not how I would have chosen to come out to our imbecilic classmates.”
Sherlock flung herself at Jo, running her shaking hands over every part of her she could reach, both reassuring herself of Jo’s existence and checking for any obvious damage. “Jo! Are you - I thought - are - ?”
“Yes. Actually - no. I had a bad headache yesterday at work. I thought it was just because we were so busy, but now that I think about it… Someone was wearing far too much cologne, and someone else stank of cigarettes. And the nurses made about a thousand pots of strong coffee… maybe it
Sherlock smiled and sniffled, curling into Jo and burying her face in her shoulder without disentangling their hands. “Thank you. I love you.”
“I merely wanted to ensure that Gregory was aware of my intentions,” Mycroft put in archly. “There was nothing political about it.”
“Right.” Jo kissed her until she stopped frowning. “Mm. You taste like coffee. Put a fresh pot on while I shower, would you?”
Jo hesitated. “I… no, sweetheart. I really don’t.” She glanced at the clock on her nightstand. “I think I’m just going to try to sleep a little longer before we have to get up.”
Sherlock looked mutinous, but the biscuit Jo had brought her and half of the sandwich had disappeared while they were bickering, so Jo called it a victory.
“Still monitoring our internet history, then?” Jo said, trying for a joke. It didn’t work, her voice too shaky with nerves for it to be funny.
“No. Sit. Eat some soup, please, and then I'll rub your feet for you, and then we're going to bed for a couple of hours because you need to rest."
“No, you’re right, of course,” Jo replied. “I just thought it might be nice, is all, to have it be someone we know.”
Mrs Hudson sat down next to her and put a warm hand on her back. “It wasn’t your fault, dear. Prenatal vitamins or no, miscarriage just happens sometimes. It’s no one’s fault.”
“You were eavesdropping yesterday at the crime scene, while Lestrade was on the phone with his ex-wife. He wants partial custody of their daughter, or at least more visitation.”
Sherlock didn't reply, just pressed her face into Jo's neck and made a small, unhappy noise. "Can we go to bed now, please?"
“Jo.” Sherlock’s voice sounded far away. She was still more asleep than awake and grumbled incoherently, burrowing further into her pillows.
“Fine, then you can keep playing hostess. Be charming and entertaining for ten more minutes while I finish dinner.”
"Well, it is a very personal subject," Greg allowed. "I can't picture Sherlock pregnant, though. Or as a mum, for that matter."
Sherlock hugged her back, laughing. "Thank you!" Now that she'd had a minute to process it -- and Molly's infectious excitement to help her along -- she
Sherlock’s arms tightened almost convulsively around Jo, hugging her impossibly closer. “You don’t have to. I’m… not sure how I feel about it, either. It’s been difficult, seeing you hurting and not knowing what to do about it. And… losing the baby, that was. Not good.”
Sherlock pouted, but followed Molly over to the stage to wait with the other soloists. The last performer had just finished and the rest of the dancers were being slowly shepherded onto the stage to sit under the hot, bright lights while the judges finished calculated the scores.
truly shocked and thrilled to have placed so high. Having thrown her solo together in just over a month, she hadn't been expecting to do that well, especially with her less traditional music choice. But the plaque sitting in her lap read
Jo pulled her close and hugged her, stroking a hand up and down her back soothingly. "Shh, bee, you're alright. I think you're a little stressed about the auditions and the competition. You're an incredible dancer, and you're going to be amazing. You have time, and the talent, and the skills to work it out. Okay?"
She put the pillow she'd been sitting on back at the head of the bed, then wriggled under the covers, dislodging the tucked-in sheet as little as possible. Jo slid in next to her, and Sherlock immediately snuggled up close to her, tucking her head under Jo's chin.
Sherlock nodded tersely. “Pleasure. Now, could you tell me why, exactly, my wife is in a hospital bed rather than doing her job?”
Sherlock looked like she wanted to roll her eyes. Jo smiled. “Thanks. It’s not quite that easy, though, as you might imagine…”
They continued like that for several minutes, Sherlock counting softly in Jo’s ear, her breathing just audible enough for Jo to easily match it.
"A bit, maybe," Sherlock admitted. "But Irene Adler is in my category again this year, and she beat me by half a point last year because the judges liked her music better, and --"
“Hush, now,” Mrs Hudson chided. “You just drink your tea, and I’ll fix you a bite to eat before I go upstairs to your Johanna, shall I?”
Jo sat on the couch by Sherlock’s hip. “I know you don’t want to do this, but it’s important, yeah? Science hasn’t figured out how to make babies without sperm yet, so we sort of need Greg’s help with this one.”
hadn't said anything - since that morning in the kitchen, but Jo knew that she wanted the slightly-worse-than-usual PMS to mean something more. “Yes,” she eventually answered, sounding apologetic. “A few days ago when you were at Bart’s.  I'm sorry, love.”
Sherlock took a sip of the strong, sugary tea the nurse had placed in front of her to steady herself. “Is - is there anything I can do to make it easier for her?” She didn’t much like having to admit her uncertainty to, and request help from, someone who wasn’t Jo, especially a near-stranger. But this was important - this was
Sherlock lifted her head to look at Jo properly. “I’m hurt,” she said, (mostly) teasingly. “You were the one who
Jo grinned and kissed her. “Brilliant as usual. You’re right, I didn’t realise I was staring at him today or yesterday. I knew I married you for a reason,” she said, her voice turning teasing, “smart, gorgeous,
Curling in on herself even further, Sherlock shook her head again. Fine tremors wracked her body as if she was suppressing more sobs, but she stayed silent.
wine to go with it, though, so you can wipe that look off your face.” This last was directed at Mycroft, who was looking decidedly put-upon.
“Mmm, so I see. Unfortunately, I'm a bit busy at the moment…” Jo trailed off, teasing, and felt Sherlock mock-pout where her lips were pressed against Jo's neck.
"Yep. Let's go, up you get." Jo dragged Sherlock to her feet and half-carried her to where her street shoes and dance bag lay. She let go to shove the pointe shoes in the bag, which she slung over her shoulder, and Sherlock swayed dangerously. Jo frowned and steadied her. "Sherlock, you need to put your street shoes on, love, come on."
I wanted to ask him. I – I wanted out baby to be connected to both of us, biologically. I wanted her to be
"I've missed you," Jo admitted. "We sleep in the same bed every night, but I feel like I haven't seen you in ages."
Sherlock glared at her as they bundled themselves into the backseat, but the effect was ruined when she yawned and curled up against Jo's shoulder. She fell asleep almost instantly and stayed that way until they were nearly home.
“I’ve been doing some thinking,” Jo informed her, trying to look serious despite the smile playing at the corners of her mouth.
The sudden transition from serious, motherly landlady to offering to get high together almost made Jo laugh out loud. “I might take you up on the offer for a cuppa, but I’m not sure one of your, ah,
“It’s fine,” Sherlock mumbled, burying her face in Jo’s jumper and wrapping her arms around her waist. “You were - I should have - It’s fine.”
The exam was was quick and relatively painless, although the cramps made it more than a little uncomfortable. Jo curled in on herself a little when Dr Singh removed her hands, trying to relieve some of the renewed cramping. Sherlock shifted back onto the bed, gently lifting Jo’s head and shoulders until they rested in her lap. She ran her fingers softly through Jo’s messy, sweat-damp hair, silently offering comfort and reassurance.
Greg glared. “Lay off him, Sherlock. Anyway, showing up at the Yard with a single red rose and insisting I come to dinner with him convinced me in the end.” He smiled and kissed Mycroft’s cheek when he blushed.
“Come on, go and get a shower. You’ll feel better.” Sherlock rubbed Jo’s back, jostling her gently. “I’ll make you coffee, but only because we promised Donovan we’d give statements today and I need you there.”
“Of course I do, dear.” Mrs Hudson ushered Sherlock into her kitchen and sat her down. “I’ve just made tea, would you like a cup?”
The third time, instead of disappearing into her new lab, Sherlock sat on the edge of the sofa near Jo’s feet. “Jo?”
Sherlock was sitting cross-legged in the centre of the bed wearing an old, worn tank top and soft flannel pyjama bottoms, brushing out her long, dark hair. Despite the bright midday sun outside the room was dimly lit, the heavy curtains drawn nearly shut against the light. Sitting there, Sherlock looked soft and warm and beautifully
want to be able to take care of you,” Sherlock said, snuggling impossibly closer. “So I guess that’s settled. We really are having a baby.”
“This whole concept is extremely heteronormative and sexist. Why is it still included this course? It’s essentially useless.”
This morning though, with her mouth feeling foul from having forgotten to brush her teeth and her stiff body complaining at her, Jo felt decidedly less relaxed. The room was still dark; it was far too early for her to have woken on her own, especially after having stayed up so late the night before. For a few moments Jo lay very still, trying to figure out what had woken her.
"You're staring at me, again." Sherlock remarked without looking up from the knot she was untangling.
Greg smiled at Mycroft and took his hand. “I initially thought he asked me to coffee to talk about you, honestly,” he told Sherlock. “I didn’t think he was interested.”
, grief and anger and guilt and exhaustion and fear, everything she’d been internalizing and suppressing for the past two weeks, all coming out at once now that she was giving in to it.
“I hadn’t thought about the abortion in -- god, in years. But now it’s all I can think about. I feel like -- like I’ve done something terrible. I know -- part of me, the part doctor part, knows that that’s ridiculous. I haven’t done anything wrong. But I almost…” Jo laughed humourlessly. “I almost want to go to Confession, as ridiculous as it sounds. I’m not religious, not since I was a child and didn’t have a choice about going to Sunday school. But I almost do.”
Sherlock woke, hours later, to the feeling of John's hand in his hair. (Of course he knew it was John - obvious.) "Sherlock?"
Sherlock sighed and pulled her closer. “I know. I love you.” She kissed the top of Jo’s head and closed her eyes.
Their eyes met across the room and both girls started forcing their way through the crowd. They met somewhere in the middle, and Sherlock suddenly realized that she was beaming again, that her cheeks were sore from smiling so hard. Her smile got impossibly wider as Jo crosses the last couple of feet between them and threw her arms around Sherlock’s waist, lifting her off her feet and twirling her around a bit.
“Really. I think it’d be amazing, like you said, to watch a tiny person grow up. And I think you’d be an amazing mother.” She squeezed Sherlock’s hands again, wanting to banish the uncertainty she could see in her eyes.
Sherlock tipped her head back so she could speak and rinse her hair without getting shampoo and water in her mouth. "I know, Jo, I've missed you, too. And I don't mean to worry you. I just..."
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, smiling shyly. She gently disentangled one of her hands to pick her fork back up, but didn’t let go of the Jo’s other hand until they’d both finished their meals.
"There you are, Sherlock! Where'd you run off to, then?" Molly asked when Sherlock caught up to her backstage.
Smiling a little, Jo petted her hair. “Alright, we don’t have to talk about it. It’s okay, bee, I’m not angry with you, just worried.” Silence settled over them again. Sherlock was still crying quietly, if the growing wet spot on Jo’s jumper was any indication, but she didn’t seem to be as upset as she’d been before.
“I… okay, yes. I haven’t let myself hope because I don’t want to be wrong. I didn’t realise how badly I wanted this until it became a real possibility.” Jo was blushing and refused to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “I’m sorry, I know it’s stupid.”
Sherlock sprang to her feet, pacing the small kitchen restlessly. “No. Well, yes. Sort of. I -” she stopped and ran her hand through her curls. “I’m not even sure I should tell you, Jo should be the one to - but I can’t, she -”
Dr Singh gave Sherlock a slightly indulgent smile,  then turned to Jo. “Did you want to tell her, or shall I?”
Jo laughed and kissed the side of her head, more than used to her girlfriend's dramatics. "Well, it's not long now until the adjudication. Why don't you head backstage? See if Molly's around?"
, then pecked her on the forehead and disengaged herself gently to find pyjamas, ending up in just pants and an old cotton t-shirt.
Jo tugged Sherlock up on the bed with her, wrapping her in a hug. Sherlock was shaking. “Shh, I’m alright. I’m alright, sweetheart, shh, it’s okay. I’m okay.”
Sherlock squeezed her hand again without looking up from her phone, which she was tapping at one-handed. “We’re not merely here on a social call, Mycroft, as you are clearly already aware. I’m forwarding you a contract now, which we can discuss. I’m sure you’ll find that it is very thorough.”
"I'll just leave you girls to it, then," Mrs. Hudson put in awkwardly, seeing herself out of the flat.
Jo kissed her softly. “It’s alright, bee. Come on, the dishes can wait.” She kissed her again, this time with more heat. “Come to bed and I'll take your mind off it.”
The nurse straightened up and extended her hand. “Why don't you come sort out your Johanna’s discharge papers, and I’ll make you a cuppa. Alright?”
“Well… When I was looking for ways to help you feel better, some of the sites suggested that we make a keepsake of sorts. I thought we could get a sonogram printed and framed. We could put it on the mantle.” Sherlock paused, then smiled crookedly. “It could keep the skull company.”
Sherlock shook her head and stood stiffly, pacing away from Jo’s hospital bed before turning back to face Jo. She didn’t say anything, just blinked owlishly.
The flood of dancers had thinned out slightly, but the dressing room itself was overcrowded and chaotic, full of overexcited dancers rushing around getting ready for the next performances and chattering about the results of the adjudication.
