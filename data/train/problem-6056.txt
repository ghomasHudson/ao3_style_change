It dawns on Tony that this is the longest he’s been in Steve’s vicinity where Steve hasn’t tried to talk to him about them, order him around, or make amends. The burst of energy that runs through him makes him twitchy and his fingertips start to prickle with pins and needles.
“This is absolutely the least sexy thing I’ve ever seen, but damn do you know how to get me hot, Barnes.” Tony growled, attributing his good nature to the stream of
“Wait, what?” Clint coughs from the couch, jerking forward into Steve’s peripheral vision. At the same time, Tony’s eyes widen, and he takes a sharp breath.
He worried through a few rounds in the ring sparring with Thor, and as he pummeled a punching bag into dust at his feet. JARVIS advised him, though a little judgmentally, he suspected, when Tony left and returned from SI, and he worried through that too.
“What?”
Bucky fits into the team dynamic with a flawless ease that Steve finds as surprising as it is rewarding. After everything they went through to get him back, watching Bucky roll around on the gym mats with Natasha and move seamlessly through target practice with Clint warms him through. Bucky even manages to win Bruce over, sitting quietly in his lab and listening to Bruce’s gentle musings, eventually drifting off on the couch in the far corner. It’s a platonic reminiscence of Steve in Tony’s lab, and if he had any doubts about Bucky fitting into the family, they’re long gone now.
Bucky had become somewhat of the designated laundress for the Avengers after losing the last prank battle to Clint. There was only a week left on his debt, and Tony couldn’t be more right, Steve having been the primary victim when Bucky hadn’t understood the concept of the dryer.
“Peter,” He says gently, because all at once the kid has tears in his eyes and looks like he’s about to cry.
me?” Maybe he’s got a death wish after all.
Tony gives him a contemplative frown, then relaxes back into him. “You’re right. I know you’re right. It was probably just a dream.”
There was a long, drawn pause. Maybe Tony had covered the receiver with his palm because the stuttering breaths he was drawing were muffled, though still audible. They seemed to fill the silence in the room, which had become bigger, emptier as the conversation went on.
“I know sweetheart, but he has saved me from kicking your ass a few times since you got back so maybe you owe him either way.”
Just as he’s making eye contact with the driver, opening his mouth to give directions to the airport—because he’ll be damned if he spends one more minute in the same city as Steve—a shout from behind him cuts him short.
“Natasha, please,” Tony rasped, crawling towards them, hand outstretched. She smacked him away and then someone else was there, an agent Tony didn’t recognize, pulling him back. Pulling him away. Away from
“Oh, yeah Parker, you think you could take me down while Clint’s shooting at you? There’s no way.”
Strange, how a body Steve’s maimed and made bleed still craves being pressed up against him, still finds a way to slot him perfectly back into place. Steve clings to him, presses his face into Tony’s shoulder and weeps.
Is that what he is? Powerless? Because in Tony’s arms he feels like he’s invincible and it’s never felt like this before. Tony sees something in him that Steve has never seen in himself and he hates that Tony’s decided to do this now, when he’s barely holding himself together.
“You said it was nothing,” Tony interrupts. The anger rises up in him, and Steve can see it behind his hard eyes. There’s fear there, so much fear, but Tony does a good job at holding it at bay. “I asked you if you needed me to come and you told me it was nothing.”
This is it. This is the other shoe falling.
“Steve…”
“It’s a trauma therapy program,” Tony explains, ignoring Rhodey’s shell-shocked expression.
“What do you think?” Tony moves restlessly in his seat, not fully comfortable.
Rhodey reached across the table, settling a hand over his wrist and stilling the fork in his hand.
He wants it to be enough, to just be some regular, average, run of the mill guy with a home and a partner and a
This is the first time Tony’s actually seen him this close up. There are dark, sunken circles under his eyes and his face looks tight and tense. He looks awful.
“I doubt that.” But even as he says it, Tony’s stripping off Steve’s pants and underwear together, revealing that he’s hard and already leaking over his shaft.
“What are you—”
“But I want to hear what you think.”
“You’ve never been predictable a day in your life.”
“Damn it, Stark,” he growled to no one and himself.
Too many hands start prying him away and he’s just trying to get Tony into his arms. Why can’t they leave him alone? He only wants to hold him, plaster him against his chest and keep Tony safe from the world as if there’s enough love inside Steve’s body to keep them both alive.
It’s foreign and unusual, not the kisses that Tony remembers but something more delicate. As if Steve truly understands the fragility that he holds in his hands and Tony is grateful for that because with Steve’s mouth on his and his tongue tracing along the seam of his lips Tony feels like spun sugar ready to shatter.
“I know that.” Tony offered up a soft smile.
Steve gives him a blank look and then frowns, gesturing between them. “We are, Tony.”
“I was hoping—”
“You’re just jealous they’re not for you, Tony.” Nat teased, fastening her gift of a polka-dot bowtie right below DUM-E’s claw where it met the long strut. He whirred happily at her, claw rotating back and forth.
Tony watches as Steve tries, desperately to explain. The memory shifts to Steve trying to tell him before the video plays, before they enter the bunker, in the middle of the video. He apologizes while Tony’s already attacking Bucky, holding his hands up in defense instead of trying to intervene.
Tony’s playing with him and he doesn’t have the patience for this. There are a hundred other things he needs to do—things made harder by Tony and his goddamn pride.
Tony whips around, and Steve sees the look on his face. Determined. Furious. “Stop! Steve, what the fuck! I have to do this!”
Steve opens his mouth to say something more and Tony cuts him off. “I can’t do this. I can’t. Fuck this was—” he breaks off with a laugh that sounds half hysterical in his ears, “do whatever you need to do Steve. But I’m through. There’s no more Iron Man, okay? We’re not a team. We’re not anything.”
How could Tony do this?
? In Tony’s
With misery comes a distinct feeling of rage not dissimilar from the rage that had followed Steve for months after Bucky had fallen from the train. A rage that hollows away into that dangerous place inside himself and calls for retribution. A useless, pointless feeling because in seconds Tony has simultaneously taken everything that’s ever mattered to Steve and robbed him of his ability to get justice for the crime.
“Like I said, it was something he used to do.”
“Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it, Barnes,” Tony waggles his eyebrows at Steve, and the heat on his neck surges up to his cheeks. “I’m sure Steve could tell you a thing or two about that.”
Tony was rarely sensitive about his class, having resigned himself years ago being a rather unorthodox Omega. He was an arrogant, egotistical, surly bastard when he wanted to be, commanding a room and parading about like an alpha on most days.
, that’s it darling, yes, you’re so gorgeous—never thought you’d want this in a million years and now you’re mine. All mine.”
“I don’t know what I’m doing!” Steve cries, desperation so palpable Tony thinks this must be what a caged tiger feels like, padding endlessly in circles, eyes white around the edges with fear. “That fucking terrifies me. I keep asking myself if I say the wrong thing ‘is he going to leave,’ ‘is it all going to fall apart again’ and I can’t take that Tony. I can’t. So if that’s where this is headed then just say it. Say it!”
“You fucked him last night.”
Something slowly relaxes in Tony’s shoulders and he tugs Steve in close again. “You’re taking this remarkably well. No panic? Wait, what exactly did you think was happening this whole time?”
“Just—lets try it and see how it goes. Steve, I trust you.”
“What about grilling up some steaks one night?” Clint put in.
Time in Wakanda became slower and meaningless.
Pain clouds Steve’s eyes and almost instantly Tony sees a glimmer of tears there. If Steve starts crying, Tony will start crying and then where will they be? Sobbing over the broken pieces of their marriage in the street?
“Of course, sir. Thank you, sir.” The shop owner’s head bobs up and down as he rushes over with a bag full of hot-pressed sandwiches, more than one man could ever eat, including Steve, and sets them on the table when Tony doesn’t immediately reach for them.
Respect makes him feel light and airy, and he doesn’t even mind if Steve is still going to give him orders, especially if they continue to happen behind closed doors while Steve is peeling off his clothes. Tony will take
“After we lost Peter, I didn’t think I would. But I do. I really do, Steve.”
Steve thinks of Tony, hands on his hips, begging Steve not to let him go. “I made him a promise, Buck. I promised him we’d figure it out and I just—I thought, maybe if I could just—”
“Sweetheart, please.”
Tony veered back, suit arcing through the storm as the black sky bled into the water and Tony couldn’t see where the sea ended, save for the white frothing peaks of the waves cresting in the chaos.
The suit failed as they reached the edge of the ship, sending Tony and Steve sprawling across the deck, shattering through boxes of cargo and slamming into the side of the vessel. Before he could issue another order, the suit released and Tony was scrambling out between desperate breaths, prying away what he could with numb fingers.
“And you can come with me,” Tony says, slipping an arm around Steve’s waist and steering him towards the elevators. On the ride up to the penthouse, Tony is silent, one gauntleted hand tracing a circle on his back.
Pulling a body pillow he’d acquired from somewhere in the Compound – Wanda’s, maybe – closer to his chest, Tony pressed his face deep into the blankets. The nest had started slowly, scenting of all of the Avengers, until it had morphed into something else entirely.
Tony is taking him flying!
JARVIS remains quiet as a hologram of Tony appears before Steve in the centre of the shop, projected from some unknown space across the room.
Tony resists the urge to yank him down by his tie, listen to the rewarding sound of him choking as the knot twists against his throat. Instead, he focuses on kissing him deeper, pouring in all the heartache, loneliness, and bitterness that he’s lived with all these months.
“When we were first in Wakanda, I blamed you for all of it. Everything. I was so incredibly angry and I didn’t know how you could do that to me. To us.” A feeling Tony knew all too well. “I spent a lot of time telling myself if you hadn’t been so stubborn all the damn time, if you hadn’t always expected so much of me, maybe I would have said something sooner. I spent a lot of time telling myself I couldn’t trust you because you hadn’t trusted me with Ultron, right?”
Tony was always so pushy about clean-up, claiming that he was shy and didn’t want anyone to walk in. It had happened before and the reactions had been… unsavoury and judgemental. No one ever understood.
He drops his forehead to the arc reactor, listening to the steady thump of Tony’s heart. He wonders if Tony knew he could hear it all along. Steve’s long since memorized every pattern: the way Tony’s heart rate picks up when he’s soaring through the sky, the way it settles to baseline when Clint hands over the last slice of pizza and their movie nights come to an end.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I didn’t—they said you weren’t going to come through, Steve. They said you weren’t going to make it.”
Where he’s shown Steve the crisscross of white scars on his heart, Howard tearing him into little pieces, or worse, his mother. Beautiful and priceless, something Howard shattered onto the floor just to watch her break. Then had the gall to kick her for crying.
The scene Steve is seeing in front of him is one that shocks Tony to his core, because at first it doesn’t look like anything traumatic or disturbing. It’s just their bed, Tony lying on his stomach with his bare back visible above the blanket where it’s settled across his waist. Steve is naked and propped against the headboard, an arm pillowed behind his head with his face turned up to the ceiling, eyes closed and thick lashes fanning across his cheeks.
“If it’s Parker, I think we’re the perfect people for him. You know, he’s had a terrible run so far. No parents, his aunt and uncle have been raising him since he was a kid, and his uncle was shot in an armed robbery right in front of him last year. Who knows a traumatized superhero better than we do?”
So, it doesn’t matter. Shouldn’t matter.
It’s so rarely sweet between them and Steve gives himself a silent warning not to get used to it. Better to prepare for the inevitable than get lost in the fantasy.
“This is the best thing that’s happened to me in a while,” Tony teases as Steve herds him backward towards the bed.
Steve pinked up prettily, the way he always did, and started to push Tony off his lap. An octopus, wriggling in Steve’s big arms, Tony refused to be dislodged and managed to curl in closer.
Steve glances up as he finishes and settles his hands on his hips. “I have a meeting with Rhodes. I cancelled the training, but forgot about him.”
There have been just as many nights when he sits, eyes downcast, while Tony tells him the same. But that isn’t what Tony says this time. He just rubs a thumb across one of Steve’s nipples and asks, “Were you happy there?”
Steve is awake and dressed, looking every inch of handsome perfection. He’s tucking the sheets back into place on the bed, as if he’s forgotten that Tony has robots for that sort of thing. Steve never actually forgets; he just prefers it. These little routines that Tony has categorized under Things that Keeps Steve Rogers Sane. It wouldn’t surprise him if before the end of the world comes, Steve still manages to find time to bounce a quarter off the corners.
. It would have been better if he’d slammed it. “I’m inclined to say that this is illegal. But I guess that wouldn’t mean much to you. Would it, Steve?”
“Tony, you’re– I’ve never felt– this is–”
Tony tenses, hands balling into fists in the cotton of one of his Metallic t-shirts. “So you’ve just got it all figured out then. Congratulations. Did you unlock some sort of level achievement with that play?”
He can’t believe he could have had this all along. That this Tony, the Tony he fell in love with, the only one who evades his dreams and smirks in the shadowy backdrop in the far corner of his mind—this Tony would have had him, even then.
“Of course. I have you.” Tony’s lips brush his again. He slips in the tip of his tongue, and Steve tugs him in closer, brushing the pan off the hot element and backing Tony up against the opposite counter with a burst of white-hot desire.
Steve shuts his eyes.
Bucky threw a leg over Tony’s hip, pulling him back from the circle of Steve’s arms until he was pressed against his chest. The possessive act made the Alpha instincts in him swell, the urge to grab Tony back taking Steve by surprise. Except a moment later, Bucky’s metal fingers were twining into his own, tucked their combined hands up under the smaller man’s chest. The urge dissipated as quick as it had come.
“What’d I miss, punk?” Bucky’s eyes are already on the horizon, shoulders braced for a fight. Behind him, the suit is rushing forward over Tony’s face again, and he turns toward Steve, expectant.
If anything, it’s exposure therapy, because this is exactly what Steve had wanted in the first place. This is what was worth it all. Getting Bucky back. And Tony has to admit Bucky has a certain charm to him that draws a room together and eases tension with hearty laughter.
The hands that had touched Tony so many times, loved him and stroked him until he’d been soft and pliant. Hands that had held Tony steady through storms they’d weathered together. Hands that had tickled him until he’d screamed and tossed Tony over his shoulder, holding him secure as he dragged Tony from his workshop and tucked him into bed.
Tony’s cock is an enticing, lush red, a few shades lighter than the flush of exertion spreading across his cheeks and down onto his chest. If they had more time, Steve would lick and suck until red darkened into purple and Tony was teetering on the edge of release, moaning and begging for Steve to let him come.
“Oh, honey. Honey, no. You can’t think like that.”
When they’d first arrived in Washington for a week-long session on a series of Amendments being proposed to the Sokovia Accords, dinner had been a loud and obnoxious event. The current Avengers piled in around the table, tempers spitting, emotions rising and cresting like tsunamis as they reviewed the days’ proceedings.
“I don’t know,” Tony says honestly. “But I still think that it’s his decision to make. And if he wakes up in a few months and feels like he’s lost time or made a mistake, he’ll figure it out. He’s a big boy, isn’t he? That’s his mistake to make—if it’s even a mistake at all, taking a big leap there, don’t you think? It’s his life to live. Not yours, understand? Not yours.”
Bucky smacked a hand against his flank. “Don’t get cocky.”
“No, I was just being an ass. You should know that by now, kid. I say the stupidest shit sometimes. And Cap’s fine, I’m sure. A little absent, maybe a bit more barkish early in the morning. He’s a big boy. I’m sure he’s fine. And I’m fine. And you’re going to be just fine so everything’s alright. Right kid?”
“Steve.” When Tony says his name, Steve’s eyes shoot to his face. They’re wide and open, so blue that Tony thinks he could easily drown in them. After all, he’s drowned in them before, so many times over.
That… did not sound like Tony.
“Yeah, Tony, I knew you heard me. I wanted you to hear me. I didn’t think you were ready to hear it but I wanted to tell you anyway, and if you didn’t want to know, you didn’t have to.” Steve’s eyes search his face.
“Oh god. You’re such a sap, Rogers.” The words were soft and a small smirk tugged at the edge of Tony’s mouth.
Steve swallows, his mouth dry and tacky.
Tony shoots him a smirk. “You’re so uptight, Steve. Live a little. Are you not enjoying your vacation?”
He opens his eyes and the light is blinding.
Steve leans forward with a smile and presses a kiss to Tony’s mouth. When he pulls back, Tony’s eyes are dancing, sparkling with light, and something so joyous makes Steve’s chest squeeze.
If it wasn’t that, maybe it was the bonding issue.
“Don’t you want to come?” Steve is only half-teasing, watching as Tony’s prick jerks and fills out further between them, answering the question with an emphatic
“I know.” Tony presses his nose into the centre of Steve’s chest and huffs a little disbelieving laugh. “God, I know.”
Right before he can’t take anymore, he shoves hard into Steve’s mouth and relishes the sound of him gagging.
“You’re right,” Steve says after a quite moment. “So now you know. Captain America’s a coward.”
“You did it,” Steve breathed, hand on Tony’s unmarred cheek. “Tony, you did it!”
Steve hasn’t tried to kiss him, not in the entire time they’ve been sleeping in the same bed, curled up together on the couch watching bad daytime TV, sitting pressed side by side when the doctors had told Tony his arm wouldn’t get any better, and recommended amputation.
Steve shakes his head, eyes focused on the expanding stretch of highway in the midday sun.
“Be safe while I’m gone,” Steve reminds him. He pauses at the window, eyes lingering on some unfixed location out on the horizon.
“Will you marry me?”
“Mute. Pipe down, no one asked you anyways,” Tony mutters into the abrupt silence.
Tony lets out a startled burst of laughter, and for a brief second Steve can see him working out all the logistics. Tony must think better of it because he kisses Steve soundly once more before setting Steve on his feet and walking along the trackpad that pulls the armour free.
“Buck said something tonight, after it all,” Steve pushes on. “Asked me how I thought I could ‘save him’ when I couldn’t even save my own marriage. Guess he’s probably right, isn’t he?”
Steve eats his ass like it might make Tony stay—desperate and silently begging.
Tony feels owned. Possessed and wholly belonging to this beautiful, powerful man.
He gives. “Alright.”
Steve drew a rattling breath and clenched Tony tighter against his chest. “I promise. I love you, I’m sorry. I love you so much.”
Did Steve even consider what those vows meant when he’d made them? They’re only pretty words now, scattered like rose petals in the frozen waste of Siberia.
All the happy memories, now jagged and broken at the edges.
“Then he can write me a thank you note when it’s all said and done. Is that all?”
He wants to ask Pepper if she knows what it’s like to walk around your not-home while the other half of your soul trails behind you, a broken fracture of a shadow that waxes and wanes with the sun but never disappears.
“No, just stop. Just—Steve, seriously. Let’s just pretend this didn’t happen and go on our way until we have to see each other again. Why draw this out? What could this possibly be doing for you?”
Even now, he was beautiful. The most beautiful thing Tony had ever seen.
It’s quite the opposite, really, when he catches himself wondering if Bucky fits in a bit too well. It’s another one of those moments he knows he’s being irrational, but as he watched Bucky and Tony banter back and forth, bent close together over one of Tony’s cars, there isn’t a damn thing he can do about it.
Clint laughs openly, immediately breaking any tension in the room.
Sweating and gasping, he gags harshly and throws the blankets back. Fully expecting to pitch sideways and vomit onto the carpet, Tony scrubs a hand over his clammy face and shudders.
The circle of Steve’s fist is tight and warm. Tony drops his head to Steve’s shoulder, gasping and desperate to watch. It’s been so long since he’s seen Steve fall apart.
“Tony?”
He could lose Tony in a heartbeat if he gets it wrong, now. He can feel it in the marrow of his bones.
They were supposed to
With Rhodey at his side, Steve doesn’t approach.
“Honeybear, you wound me. This isn’t just a social call?”
It’s hard to know how to feel, his kid making friends with the Avenger’s own version of the Three Stooges. But for now, he allows it, enjoys it, even.
“You’re the one who said everything special about me came from a bottle,” Steve whispers, shifting on his toes. The fist in his shirt twists tighter and Tony grinds his hips forward, the erection trapped in his slacks connecting flush with Steve’s belly.
“We’re not very good at this, are we?”
Steve groans and cups his chin, jerking his face back up to plunder Tony’s mouth. He shoves his tongue between Tony’s lips and relishes the little moan Tony rewards him with, sucking on him the same way those expert lips wrap around his dick.
?! Come on man, don’t start with that.” Rhodey’s exasperation makes him smirk from where he’s looking down at Sam’s flight pack.
One of Tony’s hands rubs circles into his back, smoothing over the creases and lines in the back of his suit. He must be staining Tony’s jacket, ruining the expensive fabric, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind. His hand stays, drifting through small patterns, rhythmic and smooth.
Their bed.
“No, but we were good at other things.”
God, Steve missed him.
“You know, you’ve always been a real smooth talker, Rogers.”
He downs the glass in two mouthfuls.
Pepper is stroking his hair. But Pepper never strokes his hair.
“I wish I could forget what you looked like the day I married you. And fuck if I don’t wish I could forget your voice saying ‘I’ve been with other people’ even though I know you hadn’t. I know it, even if you won’t ever admit it. I know you wouldn’t—not while we were still married—but hell if I don’t hear that over and over in my head and it’s—” Steve’s voice cracks and breaks off, a hand coming up to rub across his eyes and press into his temples.
Every word seems to slice through Steve like a knife.
He was stuck.
Steve was just trying to help him. Keep him safe!
In seconds they’re both bare, fumbling clothing aside haphazardly and just enough to feel flesh against flesh, rolling together as Tony struggles to get a hand around them both. It’s only fair that Steve take over – his hands are bigger – so he threads his fingers through Steve’s on the back of his head and tugs it down between them.
Over his shoulder, Steve’s shirt is undone and his tie is still hanging loose around his neck. As always, Steve’s chest is perfect, all glorious planes of muscle void of even a single scar. So unlike Tony’s now littered with more than ever.
“Ain’t that a pretty sight. Pretty, perfect little Omega,” Bucky cooed at his ear, pressing open-mouthed kisses along his throat.
Steve bit back a groan.
“Thanks,” Steve whispers. He drifts off slowly and when he wakes the next morning, the arc reactor is pressed against his cheek.
“I love you. Jesus Christ, I love you so much and I’m going to kill you. Tomorrow. After you warm me up and feed me soup. Or maybe I’ll warm you up. Either way, tomorrow, I’m going to kill you.” Every word was a knife in his raw throat but Tony couldn’t stop, the whispered words of
“I really fucking missed you, Buck.” Steve says, stepping forward and wrapping Bucky up in his arms. He claps him hard on the back, holding onto him like he’s about to disappear again.
Those were sort of like promises, Tony supposed.
“Another eight minutes out, Sir.”
It’s not what he meant. “Tony—”
Steve wants to stop. He wants to fucking stop. He wants all of this to stop.
“You’ll know sweetheart,” Ma’s eyes had been wistful, turned upward as she searched for words to describe a concept that couldn’t truly be captured. It wasn’t the first time she had tried, always giving in with lips upturned in a sweet smile and a short, affectionate huff or a sigh, shaking her head with romance in her eyes. “You’ll just know it. It’ll be like you found someone you had no idea you’d been waiting for.”
Tony deliberately drags a hand from Steve’s belly to his chest before letting it curl around his throat and linger there until Steve’s breathing kicks up a notch and he bites back a moan.
“Okay, pal.” Bucky settles in beside him, a warm line that does little to thaw the chill setting in. “I’m sure we would’ve gotten along just fine.”
“I want to tell you to fuck off.” Clint snapped, light and playful. Thermoses handed to Natasha, he shrugged on his winter jacket and pulled on his boots before he paused, digging around in his pockets and coming up empty. “You seen my gloves?”
“Yeah, I know what you were doing.” Bucky’s voice is a controlled growl, laced with disapproval that Steve isn’t prepared to face. Bucky must’ve seen some of it before he’d pulled him out but before he can think about what that means, the room changes.
“You’re not my type. No offense. It’s your dick.”
“Steve, please—”
It’s an important distinction.
Divorce, something that he had once seen as the pinnacle saving grace. Something he had held onto for years as a secret wish for his mother. Something he had never once anticipated wanting or needing for himself.
“Don’t fucking say that.” Steve thrusts hard into him, making Tony cry out and dig his fingers into the curve of Steve’s back. He twists and bites his mouth in retribution and Steve does it again. “Don’t ever fucking say that to me again.”
Tony is gloriously naked and Steve should wait, pull back to savour his beautiful form, but it feels like too much effort to draw himself away from Tony’s sparkling gaze. Desire pulses between his legs as Tony brushes up against him, cock hard and nudging against Steve’s hip.
He pressed his face into Tony’s throat, the scratch of his stubble prickling against Steve’s mouth. “Thank you. Thank you, so much.”
“Hold on!”
Word of Tony’s generosity gets around quickly.
Tony pulls back, giving him a disapproving look. “I can hear you thinking from here. What could you possibly be thinking about right now aside from coming all over my face?”
Steve bites down on his lip, unable to tear his eyes away. “Morgan,” he whispers. “Welcome to the world, Morgan.”
“Never took you for a coward, Tony,” Steve calls after him as he’s darting down the hallway and wow, that’s rich. That’s just excellent.
Steve all but growls, plastering his mouth to Tony’s again and drawing him more firmly into his lap. This time, when Tony rolls his hips, Steve thrusts up to meet him, his entire body trembling with something far more intense than lust.
After everything that’s just happened, Steve still manages to flush, a sweet spread of rose spotting across his cheeks. Tony could spend the rest of his life trying to make Steve blush for him that way, and his grin must give him away because Steve leans forward, presses his forehead against Tony’s, and huffs a small, indignant breath against his mouth.
Surely Tony could understand that what had happened, as awful as it was, hadn’t been anything more than Steve trying to keep both Bucky and Tony alive while simultaneously putting an end to the fighting as quickly as he knew how.
Steve nods before he disappears through the doorway and Tony drops his head into his hands. All he can feel, all he can think, is that Steve is finally figuring it out, and that is so profoundly unfair. There’s no relief, just an open wound ripped wide again. Tony is bleeding all over the floor.
“No? Good. Fuck, Steve. At least fucking try. Try and make this feel better. Come on.”
He gives Steve a helpless shake of his head. It’s the best he can do.
Even with his face drawn tense around his eyes and mouth, Tony found a way to put him at ease.
To serve later, or to shred.
“Tony—”
Steve rests a hand at the side of his face and when Tony opens his eyes and follows the short trail of hair on Steve’s stomach up his abdomen, over his chest, and to his flawless, handsome face, Steve is staring back. His body is curled over Tony’s in a tight arc, as if he’s desperate to be as close to Tony as possible even now, and for the first time since Tony’s survived, he feels alive.
Steve makes a loud, exasperated noise and runs both hands through his hair, tipping his head back and looking up at the ceiling as if the answers are written on its surface.
Then, Tony gasped out a breathy moan, barely even a whisper, “Steve!”
, Steve.”
Tony takes another step closer, nestles between Steve’s spread thighs and forces him back. Suspended in Tony’s arms, Steve’s head swims with the tight grip nudging the border of painful. They’ve sparred together for years and Steve’s always been aware of Tony’s underlying strength, muscle strong and steadfast under the layer of metal he wraps himself in. Feeling that strength used against him now is maddening, intoxicating.
Tony shoots Steve a blank look. “I can’t, Pep and Happy are expecting me.”
And Rhodey. Well. Rhodey chooses that moment to give Tony a transparent message on what he really thinks of all this.
“I can’t, Steve. I won’t. Why did you—I can’t do that.” Tony wonders if this is what shell shock feels like. He gives Steve what he imagines is a dumb look and holds up the prosthetic. “I only have one arm.”
Reaching out and touching Steve is his first big mistake, because he can’t pat his arm without squeezing to ground him and stepping into his space. Steve’s arms wrap around him and he thinks about pulling away, he really does, but he watches in disbelief as his arm slides up to wrap around Steve’s neck and pull him down.
made.” Tony bites back a scoff. “It was choices you kept making over and over again.”
team again. More and more, Tony finds himself asking FRIDAY where everyone is only to learn that Wanda and Vision and Scott and Natasha are piled in the communal living room with Steve and Barnes, watching a movie or sharing a meal.
“Tony!”
“God, what is with you this morning? Fine, weirdo, Italian I guess. I’m a big pasta person, go figure. Always have been. Mom cooked some amazing Italian when I was a kid.”
No one needs to know that he still wears it around his throat.
Steve freezes up, his arms tightening so severely that Tony can see how his biceps are trembling under the strain. The colour drains out of his face and his mouth opens and closes. Once, twice. When they do come, the words are so quiet he could have missed them. “Do you really think that?”
Tony starts to shake his head slowly, not in disagreement, but in disbelief.
When he’s just barely hanging on and people are depending on him.
“It’s not all black and white, Steve. I’m not going to walk away because we’re having a fight. I want you to be a real person with me. I know it’s hard, I wrote the book on deflection, remember?”
It was in those simple moments that Tony had never had to question if he made Steve happy. If he was enough for Steve.
Steve blinks.
“Tony, what—” Steve’s voice is a mixture of confusion and hurt.
It’s going to be Siberia; it has to be.
It’s gruesome, maybe, but Steve still thinks she looks so beautiful.
Tony doesn’t move, and the Iron Man suit is unresponsive.
you.”
“What do you want, Steve?” Even though they’re tucked into a corner, half obscured by the massive red drapery that adores the conference room walls, Steve should know better than this. There are always eyes on them these days, and the press would kill for a scene at an event like this. Another lover’s quarrel to tear the Avengers apart.
, stop. Stop, Steve. Hurry up and get in me, already.”
If Tony wants him to come, he’ll come. He couldn’t stop himself if he tried.
“Jim’s going to bring Pepper up tonight and they’re going to lock down B.A.R.F.”
Steve considered it. “I hadn’t realized. You think someone’s taking things from the Compound?”
across the comms but shoots Tony a sheepish look. “You know I just worry sometimes, Shellhead.”
“I don’t know what just happened.”
When tomorrow eventually slips away and becomes the wee hours of the next morning, he drinks so much he blacks out.
Emotions well up inside Steve, and he chokes back a sob. Pepper’s tired eyes flicker up, and they’re glowing with all the love and joy that Steve feels. “Thank you,” he whispers. “Pepper, thank you.”
But here Steve is, with his crystal-clear logic, calling Tony on his bullshit and apologizing without question, and maybe Tony can let it be that simple. It’s been good for months, and he has been waiting for the anvil to come hammering down, but to what end? Because he’s desperate for this to end all over again?
“Tony—”
The tension melting out of Tony’s body makes him slow. It’s like what he imagines wading through quicksand might feel like, body moving in halted, lagging motions as he reaches up and puts one hand on the side of Steve’s face. For a brief moment, it looks like Steve is going to smack his hand away, but he doesn’t.
The question hangs heavy between them, unspoken. Tony almost asks, he really does, with his mouth opening and closing helplessly. There’s a lot he could say. Is this the time to be saying things?
“It’s fine. I’m fine.”
The way Tony was gazing up at him had Steve instantly, achingly hard.
Tony relaxed against Steve, opening his mouth and deepening the kiss. Bucky’s hand curled over Tony’s own on his chest, anchoring him.
“Yes now, damn, Steve I want to stay inside you forever.”
“I’m fine,” Tony had said, pushing Natasha away as she tried to tend to him next. There was no medic on board the ship, and it was nothing short of a miracle that Steve could hold Tony in his arms, overcome with panic as Tony shivered through massive tremors.
Steve gets another flash from New York, Tony’s wide, panicked eyes asking him, “please tell me nobody kissed me?” And Steve laughing, confirming that wasn’t the case and then remedying the error after they’d eaten their fill of shawarma.
“Yeah, Tony. They’re really gone.”
Steve tugs the blanket higher as he closes his eyes and calls forth a memory from last Christmas; Tony curled in his lap in an oversized sweater asking Steve in a quiet voice if it’s too late for them to start a family.
“Gotta stop that, Buck,” Steve had grunted against his mouth one evening. The smell of cream, all whipped and airy with Bucky’s arousal had been noticeable from halfway down the hall of their apartment building, greeting him.
J.A.R.V.I.S. doesn’t reply, and the lights drift from their warm comfortable glow into sheer darkness. The abrupt blackness takes Steve’s breath away, not even a speck of light shining through the curtains.
“Oh sweetheart, damn it, don’t stop. Please, Steve. Come on.”
When he opens his eyes again, Tony is still there, concern etched into the flawed marble of his skin. “You were always so dense. Skull thicker than cement, I swear.”
Steve’s hands are all over him, slipping under his shirt to span wide across his hips. They trip over themselves, skating up his back until his shirt is under his arms and he has to strip it off. Whatever Tony needs to do to keep Steve’s hands on him.
Tony let himself go, floating across the waves of pleasure rushing through their shared minds. The bond was young and fresh and oh so alive with joy and love, that his vision blurred at the edges.
Steve asks him to talk, holds his hands while he does, and offers acceptance in return. He’s patient and kind, not so different from the man Tony’s known, but he listens.
Tony would say,
Eventually they move out to the lake house. There’s nothing more they can do in New York. The leads have run dry, and at some point, the realization has settled in. They’ve lost. Irrevocably.
“Boss is currently at Stark Industries, Captain.”
What sad, dark corner does his wedding ring live in now?
But even Steve can’t resist a glance over his shoulder. He pauses in the doorway, one hand on the frame, and looks down at Tony’s feet. “You’re not Maria, Tony. You never were.”
“So, what then?”
“Aside from that being an obvious cliché… what’re we talking here? Linguine? Penne? Rigatoni?” Clint pressed. “Meat sauce? Alfredo? Rose?”
“Tony, you said you weren’t going to push.” Steve chastised, and it took all of five seconds for his brain to recalculate the gasp he took for outrage and surprise as desire and want.
Tony pushes out of his chair with a scoff, shooting a pointed glare at Rhodey before he saunters out of the room without a second glance.
“If you don’t, I’m going to kill you next time.” Steve pulls back slightly and shoots him a pained look. It’s neither the time nor the place, but he means it and Steve probably knows that. “No, I won’t. But I’ll melt down the shield and make it into something else. A set of bookends or something. Don’t think I won’t.” Tony pauses and rolls his eyes with a defeated sigh. “Just keep talking to Barnes, will you?”
Tony searches Steve’s face. It’s not what he’s been expecting, Steve has caught him completely off guard and challenged him in a way he’s not used to but welcomes with open arms because Steve is right. There’s no shame in it, and Tony’s never been the biggest fan of hypocrisy.
That’s all Steve needs to hear, apparently, because he’s got Tony in his arms, bridal style in a way that Tony should probably hate but he desperately loves anyway. Steve plows his way towards the elevator, setting Tony on his feet just briefly so he can grab him across the back of his thighs and pull him back into his arms, clinging to his waist and his neck.
It’s mere seconds before Steve tries to fist his cock again and Tony lets out a hiss of frustration, gripping his wrist and pinning it to the mattress.
“I hope you know that this is only the beginning.” Steve sniffles. “There will be a lot of manly tears if we’re going to sort this out. No more avoiding.”
Except when Steve touched him, Tony was cold.
Tony will give him whatever he wants.
“I’m sorry!” He shouted, eyes blurring with tears. Tony shook his head, forehead pressed into his forearms, rolling back and forth miserably. “Tony I would never! I didn’t mean to!”
When he eyes the glasses on the floor between them, Bucky clocks his gaze and snatches them off the floor. The plastic whines in his fist.
The Rogues returning has everything to do with saving the world and nothing to do with Tony.
God, he’s missed this. The joy. The laughter. Everything feels bright and boisterous. Steve curls in towards it, tugging Tony up against his chest to bury his face in his hair.
Her voice is thick and watery, her hands digging into his back as if she’s trying to convince herself this is real the same way Steve is.
Steve blinks.
“Hi, Steve.” Tony sets the gauntlet aside and powers down the tools he’s been working with. Steve jumps when something moves out of the corner of his eye but it’s only DUM-E rolling towards him, whirring with excitement. “Oh, I get it.” Tony points an accusatory finger at DUM-E. “You’re here for him.”
Steve winces. “She didn’t. I promise, she didn’t.”
Steve doesn’t say anything when he walks into the room, standing near the bed where Tony is haphazardly packing his belongings into the duffel like an overstuffed sleeping bag. It must be driving Steve mad, Tony’s vindictive mind supplies, because Steve Rogers still packs a bag the way he had during the war, every item in its place to conserve and maximize space.
How could Tony do
Steve finds himself wondering if he can honestly say the same thing about himself.  There’s never going to be a right moment, but as Steve takes hesitant steps towards Tony, Steve knows this is the best he’s going to get.
Tony’s eyes widened, but he leaned in and put a hand on his right shoulder, steadying him. “No harm, no foul. Can’t change what’s in your DNA. Now, tell me what happened so we can avoid it for next time.”
It isn’t anything as romantic as one letter for every day of the year, like Pepper’s favourite romantic comedy Tony’s been forced to sit through too many times. It started with one, the only letter that Tony ever opened, and was followed by ten more. The twelfth never came.
They’re going to win.
Steve rears back to glares up at Tony as the hand on his throat tightens up. Something dark and twisted starting to unravel in his chest.
“Stark men are made of iron,” Clint interrupts over the comms, “isn’t that what he’s always telling us? He’s fine, Cap, as long as he can hear us. At least we’ll get a break from the comedy special.”
Tony gives him a nudge and Steve lands on his back on the mattress, crowding up against Tony’s side and offering an arm for Tony to curl into. “‘Thank you,’ he says. Comes here, fucks my brains out in the best sex I’ve had in my goddamn life and all he has to say is ‘
He wants to wrap Tony up in his arms and never let him go. He wants to watch Tony’s face open with laughter as he throws DUM-E’s tennis ball around the workshop, and listen to the rock music he still can’t stand.
Tony remains silent but seems to hesitate before rocketing back off into the sky.
to share some of the unsavoury pieces from his past.
It had happened all at once, and Bucky hadn’t done a damned thing to stop it. He was greedy and selfish because he had nothing, didn’t deserve nothing neither, but he wanted it all. He wanted them both, but with Tony it was somehow easier.
It did come as a surprise though when the Rogues had been invited, albeit underneath a shaky veil of amnesty, to partake in the deliberations about Amendments. The first day had been a lengthy talk of the consequences being reduced or done away with and the Avengers coming together as a whole again.
Tomorrow, when things are clearer, maybe he’ll remember.
“I’ll, uh, keep that in mind. Thanks. I’ll just get out of your hair.”
. It hadn’t been too long before he’d found himself overwhelmed by feverish dreams where he was sandwiched between two feisty, sarcastic brunets, both panting and begging, crying out his name like a prayer.
Ripping his head back, Tony gave a fierce shove to Bucky’s chest, forcing him back enough to get his mouth on his neck and sink his teeth into Bucky’s gland. Bucky tasted like sharp metal, the copper of blood, thick, delectable cream and –
at least six times more before he slams his hand down on the override button and the sequence disappears. The restraints holding Steve in place spring free and he slumps forward, gasping.
Steve doesn’t remember how they ended up here, his head cradled in Tony’s lap with Tony’s fingers threaded through his sweaty hair. His stomach rumbles and it’s impossible to say how much time has passed since Tony finally let him come.
He hadn’t considered that there might be more.
It’s a chaos of emotions, and Steve can’t contain them all, gasping when Tony’s thick fingers breach him and start stretching his rim. Tony’s always in a hurry, but now he moves slowly, letting Steve feel every drive of his fingers against his prostate, every slide of a fingertip around the circle of his hole.
“I was afraid,” Tony starts, brushing Steve’s hair back from his forehead as he leans forward and licks a hot line up the underside of Tony’s cock, tipping it up and towards his belly for better access. Tomorrow, Tony will register Steve’s tongue as a restricted weapon, the way he licks and laves the sensitive underside and slowly pulls the tip into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks before sliding all the way down. “It felt like nothing was different. I was so angry with you. I just wanted to hurt you—oh Jesus Christ that feels,
“Shut up, Tony.”
“I know. Shh, okay. It doesn’t matter.” Of course, it matters. It will always matter. But what’s the point?
“Just let me know if you need backup, Mr. Stark,” Peter offers, too stern for his own good.
With a sharp pivot, he slips past him and crosses the room to the door. He cracks it open and gives Steve a hard look. “It’s time for you to go.”
After all they went through to get him. Gone again. Dust on Steve fingertips. When he can’t look anymore, Steve crawls into bed next to Tony.
The moments between his scream for help and the doctor trying to take Tony away were a blur; nothing more than snippets of Natasha’s arms wrapping around him, holding him, restraining him maybe.
New York was a bittersweet place before the so-called Civil War. Falling out of the wormhole had changed him, and irrevocably altered his love for the city. When the ghosts of Steve Rogers had started to linger around all his favourite corners, there had been no more reason to stay.
This time, he can be honest. “I am. Really.”
He takes a moment to weigh Steve’s response in his mind and considers that the worst-case scenario is Steve tells him he would have known better later, if Tony is unhappy. Although he isn’t certain he’ll be unhappy sans burnt arm and it gives him a new project to work on. Whatever he’s already built for Barnes, he can improve on a hundred times over for himself.
The burns followed later.
The last thing Tony wants right now is to be held. He swallows a few times around the lump in his throat and watches hurt blossom over Steve’s features.
It’s hard to see them all slowly becoming a team again.
Steve blinks.
Just the thought that Tony is taking as much pleasure in this as Steve is drives his desire skyrocketing up. He sets a vicious pace, letting Tony gag around him and pull away just long enough to take a breath, pulling him back and holding him still. Tony’s fist flies over his cock, taking what he needs and showing Steve exactly who he belongs to. Tony getting off on just a cock in his throat is almost too much and Steve closes his eyes, letting his head drop back and gripping the edge of the car.
As if Tony could possibly think that this just happened; that he’d been passing by on the right day, at the right time. Steve wasn’t that much of a fool. Even if his faith had wavered with the appearance of aliens and Norse Gods, he was still certain. This was destiny. Fate, even.
Steve pauses for a long moment, and Tony glances down to see the familiar tense and release of his fingers at his sides. He’s always been such an obvious man, with no poker face to speak of and a painful disregard for politics. Steve lacks the special brand of elite decorum Tony was raised on and it shows, in moments like these, and anytime that he needs to hold his cards close to his chest. They’re opposites in so many ways, and maybe that’s part of why Steve wants to be able to control this so badly.
,” Steve groans, sliding his hands under the Black Sabbath t-shirt to press his fingertips into the fine muscles of Tony’s lower back. Tony gets his number quick enough, tweaking his nipple again and teasing him, rolling it between his fingers until Steve can feel himself flush, imagining all the things Tony can do with his hands.
“But what do you think?” Tony always has the answers. That’s just how it goes.
Tony wants to hate Steve. Wants to, but doesn’t.
Tony snorts, inevitably sharing in the memory of Pepper’s solo journey out to the little rockpile they’ve called an island. Steve remembers her vividly, stranded in the centre of the lake as her kayak slowly drifted away on the waves.
A man he’d been protecting and hunting down for over a year without so much as a word to his husband.
Peeking around the corner of the door, the smile morphing into a horrified gawk when his eyes raked down the sight of James Buchanan Barnes, the fearsome Winter Soldier, decked out in a blue fleece sweater, Black Widow sleep pants that rode up to his knees, a pair of fuzzy ankle socks and bright purple Hulk gloves.
“Not your love life–I bet him that I knew you better than he did. Looks like I was right.” Bucky’s warm laughter, and the shit-eating grin on his face follows Tony back to his bedroom.
Maybe this Tony doesn't know the heartache they’ve wagered against each other. The thought is unsettling; Steve hardly remembers who he was back then and this isn’t who he wants to be tonight.
Pepper breaks off with a loud groan that turns into a scream, and the midwife settles peaceably between her legs. “Alright, honey, alright. Not long now. Pops, why don’t you get up there and hold her other hand, huh?”
The asshole had already admitted that he wasn’t sorry when he’d sent that half-cocked letter, all justification, denial and placation. So, it wouldn’t be anything to do with apologies, or closure, or learning how to be a decent human being. No, if anything, he was easing the way to move on and forget Tony altogether. To forget that their time together has ever mattered in the first place.
“Oh.”
“Nah,” Steve brushes off the offer, stepping through into the mansion. If he’d thought the opulence of the penthouse was something, this was a whole different world. All open concept and horribly modern but still with something distinctly comforting about the living room. The large fireplace and comfortable seating feel like a long-awaited welcome home.
There’s so much water under the bridge, so much Steve should say. He’s often wondered if that’s what these dreams are about: preparing himself for whatever comes next with a clear conscience and giving him an opportunity to apologize, to come clean, to make things right before he’s finally able to move on.
“Yeah, I’m fucking hurt.” Tony's left hand is trembling violently against the desk. Guilt cloys in the back of Steve’s throat, rife with emotions he’s not prepared to deal with.
And maybe, in a way, Steve will.
“And on which day will they worship me as the God that I am?” Thor demanded. “I will mark it promptly on the monthly moon chart.”
So maybe he doesn’t feel so bad for him after all. It comes and goes in waves.
They were so beautiful together, his Alphas, all thick muscles and soft hands. Steve, so commanding and strong, anchoring them both, slid a hand between Bucky’s legs and stroked him a few times. He slipped his fingers between Tony’s legs and stole from the puddle between Tony’s thighs. Using Tony’s own slick, Tony watched with rapt attention as Steve stroked Bucky, wetting him until his cock was shiny and ready, a deep, near-painful red.
“I knew it.” Steve kisses him, tasting blood in their mouths but it hardly matters. “Together. I knew it, Tony. We had to do it together, don’t you see?”
Steve’s been ready for this for weeks, feeling his body falling apart around him even as his mind remained alert and focused. It was a terrible type of prison and one of the few times he’d felt human in decades.
Steve lets himself
When they’re both fully dressed, the cooling come on their stomachs swept away with a conveniently placed box of Kleenex Steve discovered, he leads Tony into the room next door.
Steve would rather take his own shield to the chest.
“Steve, what the hell!” Steve whips around to see the source of Tony’s distress. Five perfect fingermarks denting the hood of his vintage car. Shit.
An errant thought of Howard and Maria surfaces but Tony pushes it away.
This is right. This is where Tony’s meant to be. This is exactly where he belongs. He pushes everything else away, if only for a few moments.
“What’s going on in that coconut?” Tony asked, forcing Steve to resurface from his memories with a flick to the side of Steve’s head.
“Tried that before, didn’t work, remember?”
Steve opens and shuts his mouth a few times before he shifts off the bed, pulls on his boxers, and disappears into the bathroom. He returns with a wet cloth and sets it on the edge of the bed without another word.
“You, sweetheart.”
Tony always knows exactly what he’s doing.
If it’s not the clothing, there’s plenty more to laugh at.
“I know. I want you anyway.” Selfish. So fucking selfish. There’s still something vindicating about hearing it aloud.
“I’m going to get fat if we keep eating like this.” Tony groaned, immediately throwing up a warning hand when Clint smirked. “Don’t go there, asshole.”
Like the lights against the skyline from the Tower’s penthouse windows, Tony is an intricate magnificence and the pieces of the suit fusing into place sends thrills through Steve every time.
“This isn’t finished, Tony,” Steve calls after him, of course he does, but Tony locks eyes with Barnes and ignores him. Barnes has regained some semblance of his composure, stroking his fingers with an eerie calm along the crumpled tie. There’s something unsettling about him, beyond the fact that the Soldier who lives inside him murdered Tony’s parents with his bare hands. Something in the way that Barnes looks at him and sees everything he needs to, and nothing more.
He gagged, keeled over and blindly grabbed for the edge of the bed or a railing on the wall. Anything.
“Are we all expected to ignore that you’re drinking again?”
“How about you wait and see before you start making complaints about my performance, alright Nat? I’ve certainly never had any complaints before.”
“Here, here,” Tony pushes the package towards him but then thinks better of it and pulls out a square. He offers it up as if Steve is a child and without thinking, Steve ducks his head and takes it.
Tony was an excellent teacher and Bucky took to them both like a star pupil. It had been a little scary, and a lot new. It had been perfect. Not immediately, but with time and proper care, it had become something Bucky could have never anticipated.
Tony thinks he’s seen less of the Steve Rogers he knows today than ever before and that’s terrifying. Once again, he’s holding a stranger in his arms, but he’s excited now. Eager and hopeful.
Squeezing him across the shoulders, Tony sighs. “I’m sorry.”
Tony nods slowly, eyes scanning the crowd. “Barnes was ready for this, or you were ready for this?”
Thanos disappears. Everything goes silent, cut through with the murmur of disbelief. This must be what victory sounds like.
“Why would you—”
“If I call him. If I let him come in here. What are the chances anything will be different this time?” The question feels pitiable to his own ears. He tries to remind himself what Pepper had said about being pathetic but finds no peace there.
“Mm,” Tony hums, taking the green light and working at his belt. “That’s right. If you just need a little reminder that I’m yours, or maybe that’s not what does it for you? No, I think it’s the other way around.” Tony dips a hand down into his boxers and wraps his fingers around Steve’s cock, already mostly hard and craving his touch. “I think you’d want to make sure I remember who I belong to. I think you’d want to remind me that I’m
“I hate this thing,” Tony calls out when he hears the glass slide open and Steve’s heavy footfalls crossing the distance between them. “It’s ridiculous.”
That’s what Steve wants. Tony, on his knees, taking his reminder without complaint and knowing, by the end, that he belongs to Steve. That he’s always belonged to Steve since that very first day.
Vision’s priorities seem a bit skewed, to say the least.
Steve ignored him and tried again. “So, favourite food?”
Steve fled.
With a bright laugh, Tony’s hands skirt around the edge of Steve’s uniform pants but Steve holds him off, making quick work of his t-shirt and pausing to admire the warm glow of the arc reactor in his chest.
He disturbs her anyway.
Bucky should be here.
“Morgan?” He asks as Tony steps through the doorway to their old bedroom at the Compound. Steve’s already in bed, pajama covered legs tucked under the blanket, bare-chested. Exhaustion is purple underneath Tony’s eyes, but his gaze is soft.
“We’re not great talkers, Steve.”
Tony hesitates, it’s too good to be true. “Can… Will you do something for me?”
“Did you mean it?” Tony ventures, taking care to wrap the sliver of hope in a layer of armour as thick as the Iron Man suit, and Steve gives him a look as if to say,
It’s a small thing to be bitter over, but when Tony had made his vows, he had meant them for life. With a fine-tooth comb, he had selected every word, handpicked each one for Steve with purpose and precision.
Going back to an original hallmark, he throws a chilled, “fuck you, Rogers,” over his shoulder for good measure.
Steve pressed his mouth to Bucky’s forehead, evening out the small lines as Bucky slept. The questions circled round and round in his brain, driving him insane.
“What do you want from me?” Steve shouts at him, arms splayed wide as the façade snaps. An angry red flush spreads across his cheeks all the more obvious when it slips down beneath the collar of his too-white t-shirt. “Do you want to fight? Do you want to yell at me? I don’t even know what’s going on right now Tony, Christ!”
Steve blinks.
As Tony continues to babble, Steve knows that he’s staring.
“This hurts more.” Steve breaths against him. “Having you like this and knowing what we are now.”
“What do you want?” Tony glances over the seatback to see Steve hovering in the doorway, tie loose and looped around his neck, jacket over one arm and his sleeves rolled up to the elbows. He looks so handsome Tony wants to cry, wrap his fingers around his forearms and hold him still so he can trace his thumbs across the strong, steady pulse in Steve’s wrists.
This wasn’t the Tony that he had wanted, warm and welcoming, thankful and satiated the way he’d been every time before.
Steve blinks.
“I love you,” he says, instead of responding to the question Tony’s asked.
“Christ! How do you turn this thing off?”
It haunted him, and it never disappeared.
He drops his head back to the futon and thinks about the irony of it all. Guess he needs to start looking for a new place to call home all over again.
Rhodey gives him a tight smile. “Thanks, Barnes.”
Duty and propaganda live in his bones, as much a part of him as the chemicals and the Vita rays.
Happy pulls up in front of the Clerk’s Office and Pepper gives him an encouraging smile over her slender shoulder. “You’ll be home for dinner, yes?”
Damn it, no. His marriage has been over for
“This is good, right?”
He swallows, emotion caught in his throat. “Please don’t call me that.”
This thing with Tony has never shattered, and he’s earned this. Every time Steve had wanted to run, every time he thought he’d have to go at it alone, Tony had proved him wrong, and in turn, Steve had earned his trust.
The days bleed together, and he sits there with Bucky’s ghost. The silence is maddening so he draws, or tries to, anyway. Sometimes he draws the horizon or finds himself sketching Bucky glaring and making rude gestures as if he were flipping off a camera. Sometimes Steve just sits there and stares at the photograph, wondering how they only got such a short time to be happy.
Bucky hesitated. “If it doesn’t take–”
“Mate me,” he gasped, tightening his hands in Bucky’s hair and pressing his face into the side of his neck until Bucky started mouthing at the sensitive gland. He was a dirty tease. A dirty tease, stroking his tongue along the edges, offering him a whisper of teeth, but not biting down.
Too bad that Steve’s made even that impossible with his damned letter. If he had just left the door open for him, for
It hadn’t come as a surprise when Ross had proposed pardoning the Rogues.
, Tony doesn’t say, like he has so many times before. They both need this. Something that reminds them they’re here, real and grounded.
“You’re a real mess, man.”
Bucky presented just under a year later and Steve had thought maybe Mother Nature had gotten it wrong, yet again. It wouldn’t have been enough for her to bless him with a small, frail build; all long limbs and sharp edges that screamed Omega, and a scent gland that barely functioned after years of illness.
“Barnes can fight his own battles and you can’t make Steve be something he’s not. It’s horrible to watch, Tony. Like some kind of self-flagellation and you hardly deserve to be punished anymore.”
“God you’re– Tony, you’re–” Steve breaks off and gives him a helpless, disbelieving look as if Tony has made an outlandish remark in a made-up language. He gives a slow shake of his head, eyes bringing with something Tony doesn’t understand. “You’re better than me, Tony. I don’t know why you don’t see that. You treat me like I’m a saint, walking around and passing judgement on everyone else. That’s not– I was just trying to get you to give me the time of day. I didn’t want to lose you. I didn’t know how else to get you to listen.”
“I’m so sorry.”
Too many eyes turn to him and the room grows tight and small, shrinking around him. Is the air getting thinner?
“Oh, and how was that?”
Steve takes an even breath and Tony can all but see the count he works through in his head before he’s turning off on the nearest exit, and pulling the car to a stop on a country road Tony’s never driven down before.
“There he is!” Tony sneers, rounding on him so he’s in his space now. “You’ve said all the right things. Everything I wanted to hear. But I’m having a really hard time believing it because I realized something. You’ve never once listened to me since we got back. You’ve pushed and pushed. How does that fit into your whole trust and respect line, Steve?”
Somehow, in all the years that Tony has focused on becoming the polar opposite of his father, he’s transformed into a spectre of his mother instead. Maria was a weak woman, a broken woman, and Tony had loved her anyway. There was something brittle about her, the way her thin arms would wrap around him and shield him from Howard’s wrath, that is, until he was old enough to take it head-on. Then it was Tony’s turn to shield her.
Take that away and what is he? He’s already thrown everything else into the fire. He’s past the fork in the road, can’t turn back now.
“When it’s over?” Tony presses, shoving his feet into his pants and tugging a shirt, then a sweater over his head. His hair is sticking up at all angles and he can still faintly taste Steve’s spunk in his mouth, but he supposes that doesn’t matter in the face of a universal emergency. A token, for the battle to come.
“Sorry,” he mumbles, even though he wouldn’t have traded those moments for the world.
“Tony,” Steve breathes, mouth soft on his shoulder, pressing his name like a prayer into his skin.
Tonight, things are different because Steve is halfway out of bed with his feet already on the floor before Tony wraps his fingers around Steve’s forearm and tries to hold him still. As if he could restrain the super-soldier if he didn’t want to be held down. Steve wants to go, to flee to some unknown black corner to lick his wounds in private while Tony sleeps, but it won’t change anything.
He tries to remember what Steve has told him about Barnes. It’s not much, just that he’d been captured by HYDRA during the war, and again after he’d fallen from the train in the Alps. Between 1945 and present day, Barnes has been a HYDRA assassin, seemingly unaware of his actions and controlled by means they’ve yet to uncover. And Steve had loved him. Deeply, passionately, with all the heartache of a man from the forties trying to be something he wasn’t, forced to love his best friend from a distance.
Steve chokes on a breath, the colour fading from his cheeks. For a minute, Tony wonders if he’s going to be sick.
“No more running away.”
, so he collects his scattered thoughts, smacks Rhodey’s hands away harder than he needs to with the gauntlet, and strides out of the gym. His first instinct is to curl up in his workshop with a new project and a bottle, but he’s on scouting duty with Natasha that evening. Fuck if he’ll give her that sort of satisfaction.
“Should I send a message to the Captain, sir?”
He tipped Tony’s head to the side, fingers teasing and rubbing firm circles into the gland there until he was throbbing; every press of Steve’s fingers causing another ripple of pleasure and corresponding rush of slick between his thighs.
There’s something he needs to say, and he should have said it weeks ago. He was doing so well, being honest, letting Tony in, doing things together, and it’s not supposed to be this way. They’re supposed to be a team and Steve’s fear feels crippling.
“Were things really getting better?” Peter asks in a small voice. “Did I ruin it?”
“I’m not going to regret this.”
Plus, when he checks, the press looks positive so far. Remarkable, really, how quickly civilians will forget betrayal, destruction, and an obnoxious disregard for international law when their safety is at risk again. Though little information has been released on the incoming threat, it’s just enough to set governments on edge, and the media will speculate on damn near anything for a little clickbait.
He’s here for a reason. They’re together, in this time and place, for a reason, and he owes Tony this. If he doesn’t tell him now, they’re bound for a path they might not come back from.
“Of course, Sir.”
“We have to find the others.” Tony shoves away from him, stumbling unsteadily to his feet. Steve follows him in a body that floats two steps behind, disconnected and disjointed. He catches Tony’s elbow and when he turns him, grief rages in the brown of his eyes and he’s covered, chest to thigh, in dust.
“You don’t know what he’d—”
“For what it’s worth–”
Steve doesn’t have a response to that, it seems. All he would have to do is admit it. Apologize in a way that was real. It might not change everything but it would be a start, enough to bring Tony to a grinding halt; a reason to tuck the papers away at the bottom of his suitcase and forget them for a time.
The room has thinned out around them. Tony shakes his head for a second, thinking he must’ve misheard.
“You stopped sending letters.” Tony makes conversation as casually as a hole in the head, wincing when it comes out closer to an accusation. Steve shoots him a quirked little smile, eyes crinkling around the edges in a new way.
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony whispered. “You did.”
Why does he—
Some days, he forgot about the loneliness entirely.
Tony stays long enough that he lives to regret it. A part of him wonders if this was what he was waiting for after all. Tony is a weak man.
Steve leaned back in his chair, relaxing into the easy discussion and ignoring the pointed look that he could feel Bucky burning into the side of his head. If he met his eye, it would be all too obvious that they were sharing a similar thought.
“Anything for you, sweetheart. Wish I’d known how kinky you were from the beginning. You’ve been holding out on me.” Tony smiles, exhausted, and runs fingers through Steve’s sweaty hair.
This could be something else entirely.
The guilt in his chest starts to ease, his conscience absolved. This Tony is so unpredictable. He can’t tell where they’re headed next, or what to say. He’s making it up as he goes along, not unlike the rest of his life, and his thoughts drift to Tony’s family. Tony had so little time to enjoy the life he’d built for himself and Steve had gone ahead and stolen a whole extra lifetime.
“Who, Boss?” She chirps.
“Ninety-eight this July!” Steve calls over his shoulder, darting across the gym. An arrow zips by his shoulder, the crackle of electricity at the tip buzzing in his ear as it goes.
“Tony—”
Tony grins at him, hands tracing over his face, curling down around his shoulders. In the easy intimacy of Tony’s touches, Steve’s hardly realized how the lust has tapered low, but when Tony’s hips roll up to greet his own, the need roars back to life, anticipation hammering in his chest.
Tony has been on incredibly shaky ground after the incident at the Raft. It’s not a far cry to picture himself in one of those cells. Life is so surreal these days it’s not hard to imagine that this is all a delusion and somewhere, he’s rocking back and forth in a straightjacket.
But by the time Steve makes it to the makeshift medical tent, it starts to dawn on him that something is more than wrong. Tony is bent over in the suit, kneeling in a half crouch in the concrete, head bowed down with the eyes of the suit blank and colourless. The suit is powered down, but Tony has yet to step out.
“Hi Pep.”
“Which part?” Tony bites out the words. “The idiot wizard? He’s a condescending prick and you’d hate him. Actually, scrap that, you’d
Before Steve could put together a reply, FRIDAY interrupted.
Tony whispered, and Steve could almost feel Tony’s lips pressed up against his ear, breathing out filth and urging him on.
He’s used that voice with him before, but with a pout on his bottom lip; a ridiculous look on the grown man that calls himself Captain America. He tries to shove the memory away, because it’s almost always followed up with Steve pinning him down, waiting for him to give over, give up, again and again.
“When we’re done with the healing circles can we also do trust falls?”
In the next memory, Tony is angry. He doesn’t remember this one, or what he’s so angry about, but he’s got a hand wrapped around one of Steve’s thick wrists, fingers tight.
Tony smiles at him, lifting his head up with a grin so bright Steve goes warm all over. “You made it.”
“I’m sorry?”
“Steve there’s so much I need to–”
They’ve figured it out by now. They’re happy, as happy as they can be.
Steve blinks and keeps blinking. The tears fall freely over his face, and no matter how many times he closes his eyes, all he can see is Tony.
Just like all the times before, Tony responds beautifully, licking into his mouth like a starving man—like he’s dying for it—and Steve lets him take. It’s been Tony since day one, everyone knew it and even when they’ve all but torn each other to pieces, Steve craves him.
He’s alright. Tony is fine, because he’s up in the air, repulsors streaking across the horizon and various weaponry springing from his shoulders and forearms to explode like its the Fourth of July.
Tony grunts and fists his hands in the sheet, pressing his forehead down as heat washes through him. “Oh fuck.”
“It allows you to basically re-process traumatic memories and do things differently. A “choose your own adventure” if you will.”
Morgan holds out another section, and Steve follows suit, slurping the edges of her fingers, sticky with fruit juice and basking in her joy. “Now you, Dad! Now you!”
is a unique flavour of irony.
“Don’t be gross,” Clint throws the TV remote at him to bean him in the head, except he snatches it out of the air before it makes contact and hucks it back.
Tony finally wriggles Steve’s pants off and fists him again, sliding the tip of his cock against his hole dry, moaning when it catches against the rim in that way that drives Steve wild.
“Yeah.”
But Steve was the only person Tony knew who was more stubborn than himself. He also knew first hand how hard it was to break free of the restraints when you desperately wanted to be able to overcome the memory.
“And now? Because if there’s something there, Tony, even a part of something, I’m willing to do what it takes. There’s a lot in the way and God knows it’s going to be awful. But if there’s something, I want to try. I want you and I’ll work to deserve you, to earn back your trust and your respect. Whatever you need.”
There was a long, drawn out silence and when Tony spoke again, it was the final thread snapping. His warm, chocolate eyes turned cold, brown disappearing into a black as opaque as obsidian. “It’s not like I can force you.”
It was as real as Bucky is now.
“Peter isn’t that weird little neighbor kid you were obsessed with.” Bucky shoves Steve further down the couch so he can sit beside him. There was already plenty of distance between them, but Bucky has made it more obvious with the hard lines of his body.  “He doesn’t need you lookin’ out for him. He’s stronger than he looks.”
To Tony’s surprise he actually has a couple of the plates popped off of Bucky’s upper arm and is peering inside.
They must lay there for a while, Steve losing himself in the warmth of Tony’s bed. He drifts long enough that the tips of his fingers start to tingle from the path they’ve been stroking up and down Tony’s flank.
. Tony shoves it all aside. “You’re supposed to have someone else with you so this doesn’t happen.”
It feels too good to be true but Tony would be betraying the deepest part of himself if he didn’t have one ear cocked, waiting for the other shoe to fall. For now, he stays.
But he also knows that Bucky’s had his back in more ways than one already, and it’s the least he can do, really.
Sam would be the next Captain America. Bucky had Sam. Morgan and Peter would have each other, surrounded by Pepper and Happy and Rhodey. Clint had his family and Bruce was finally moving on with his life, figuring out how to live for the first time. It was more than Tony ever got before his time came.
“If you had any idea—”
He’s found it. Somehow, against all odds, he’s found home. Family. Peace. Love.
.” Steve runs a soft hand through Tony’s hair, his expression morphing into something dark and melancholy. The regret is tangible in the way his lips curve down and he tips Tony’s face up with a finger under his chin.
“–Don’t spare my feelings now, Widow.” Tony smirks around the brim of the cup.
The second the words leave his mouth he knows they’re a lie. Steve feels like garbage. Tony has experienced horrors that Steve could have never dreamed of and he closes his eyes, remembering what Tony’s told him about Afghanistan, the Mandarin attack, every moment where his control has slipped away and Tony’s been at the mercy of others.
As much as he wants to hold him, to wrap him in his arms and forgive the last few hours, the last few days, he thinks better than reaching out for him. The anger radiates off Tony in waves.
The tips of Tony’s ears pinked up despite his own laughter.
“How about a couple chickens?”
“You… need a break from me?” Steve asks, quietly.
It’s all the touches and tastes Steve’s ever loved about him and more.
Steve groaned into his mouth, finally getting with the program and palming the curve of Tony’s jaw, tipping his head back to gain a little more control over the kiss. Teasing along the seam of his lips, he relished the way Tony practically purred as he opened to him, letting him lick and taste and take.
Breathing through it, Tony forces himself to glance down at where Steve’s hand is carefully curved around his ribcage, thumb rubbing a gentle circle over his nipple. The drops of wetness on his skin are nothing more than sweat from Steve’s brow, dripping as he shoves into him.
No, he thought fiercely, he wasn’t going to shoulder the blame for this.
“Are you listening to me? The end of the day. I mean it. I want flights booked, pardons issued, security privileges reinstated, the whole nine. Get Rhodes on it too, he can update the team and start preparing a training protocol.” Ross prattles off, incessant.
“Listen sweetheart, the reception’s not great up here. Fuck, I don’t even really know if you’re going to hear all this before we break the atmosphere.”
“Well,” Natasha says, wrestling Clint down from one of the vent shafts. He lands flat on his ass beside her. “Isn’t this a pretty family picture.”
“You—” Tony shudders, his body going rigid and he convulses like he’s touched a live wire. The live wire is plugged right into his goddamn arm. “Don’t let me go, Steve.”
“Sorry,” he mumbles under his breath, and Pepper gives him the same soft smile. Exhaustion weighs heavy in her shoulders, dropping forward in another brief moment of rest.
Tony’d likened it once to the unnerving in-between he’d experienced in Afghanistan; time lost all meaning as night stretched on like the endless expansion in the cave and the sedation of the sleeping pills created a spectacular form of claustrophobia. A mixture of chemicals and the disturbing realities of his own mind.
The moment Natasha and Scott step out of the car and make their way up the front steps, Steve knows something is wrong. Natasha looks grim, but she smiles at Morgan and ruffles her hair. They haven’t seen them in months, and he finds himself wondering why they’d left Bruce behind.
To guide Tony in the right direction, his own personal moral compass, when Tony has only ever been the other side of the same coin.
Tony draws a deep breath. “And these are for you.”
. I do love you, even after—maybe everything from before doesn’t have to matter right now.”
Tony reaches across the small space between them and lays a hand over his. It feels like safety and home and everything that Steve’s ever dreamed of having. The warmth of his hand and the roughness of his calluses are familiar and welcomed. “It’s real,” Tony says. “Steve, it’s everything.”
Steve blinks.
When the exchange ends and Steve makes his way back in, he’s pale and drawn, refusing to meet Tony’s eye. They sit in silence, lost in the conversation around them.
Ross is transparent, and there’s something respectable about that. Everyone else prefers to stab Tony in the back. Then lie about it.
Tony huffs, bucking his hips in a delicious little slide that catches Steve off guard. He lets the motion tip him sideways, and Tony crawls on top of him, perched with his thighs bracketing his chest and rolling his eyes.
It hardly seems to matter now.
All except one.
“The metal arm does add a special appeal,” Tony admits, giving Bucky a speculative glance. Bucky rolls his eyes, letting the hood of the car drop shut and shucking the rest of his tools back into Tony’s kit.
“I’m not going to let some damned brainwashed prisoner of war rot in a field herding sheep because you’re an asshole, Steve. Just get on the fucking plane and come home.”
Steve sputters a wet laugh and wraps his arms around her, breathing in the smell of a perfume he’s almost forgotten. “I missed you.”
Tony tugs at his hair hard enough to rip it from the roots.
“Whoa, hey.” Tony puts a hand on his chest, propping himself up. Steve can just make him out through the darkness, but the rest of the room feels like it’s drawing in around them.
“Hey!”
Steve staggers to his knees at the edge of the futon and pulls himself up until he’s slumped against the backrest, limp limbs a chaos in front of him. It’s almost shocking how there’s no connection to his own body now, just a bag of bones on autopilot that don’t belong to Steve anymore.
Tony swore up and down he hadn’t been locking Bucky in various parts of the Compound, but the shit-eating grin on the mechanic’s face suggested he might just start. The humour eased some of the sting between them, and neutrality was a hard-fought war that Bucky had won in the end.
“Two more days.”
The realization that he really means what he’s said settles peacefully in Steve’s stomach. No one even knows yet; they’ve been so careful to keep their relationship under wraps as they figured out if it would last. Then, for the fun of it.
I'm having a hard time focusing at work, so here, have a bonus chapter for today's update.
Was it just about getting even?
“Wha—”
“I can’t,” Tony gasped, “I won’t. Just make it happen, damn it.”
Instead, Tony works quickly and efficiently through a rushed exchange with FRIDAY.
“Hold me. You won’t hurt me.”
Then again, since the moment Tony took that gasping breath and came back to them, Steve hasn’t been to think about anything but how close they came to losing him. He hasn’t been able to take his eyes off him.
When everything in him told him to run, Steve let himself fall forward, and Tony had been there, every time.
“He’s a
Bucky had claimed that Steve just looked better in tight shirts.
When he got to the doorway, he glanced back at the puppet still watching him from the nightstand.
“In a few minutes,” Steve cuts him off. Tony shifts a little closer, looking at the bed as if he wants to crawl in and tug Steve into his arms. “It’s not so bad.”
He’s halfway to jabbing his finger into Steve’s face just as Steve stops taking steps backward and Tony almost bowls into him, hand smacking off his chest and the crisp fabric of his suit. He snatches it back and holds it against his body as if touching Steve has burned him, and maybe in a way, it has.
This is the last go. His final attempt.
“All I get to see over and over again is you driving the shield into my chest! All I ever get to see now is you trying to kill me, Steve!” A familiar burn pricks behind his eyes and Tony wants to scream. Hasn’t he cried enough?
It feels good. Really good, even.
Pushing forward, Steve breached Tony’s slack body with a bitten-off gasp, sucking in a ragged breath as Tony’s wet heat clenched down around him like a vice. His vision blurred along the edges when he sank all the way into the hilt, fingers digging into Tony’s hips to keep him still as his body shivered and shuddered forward.
“Right,” Tony says, “he just seems… I don’t know, skittish almost. It’s super weird to see him that way.”
Tony feels his shoulders sag, defeated. “What a fucking mess.”
Sometimes, Tony would tease him, murmuring hot little encouragements in his ear.
“It’s been over since you started lying.”
Steve fixes him with a flat look. “I had my team on this one. I had a job to do.”
so he repaid them with thoughts of
“Iron Man, meet us at the top of Main,” Steve makes a sweeping gesture north and watches as Tony blasts forward.
“I think hamburgers and hotdogs are more appropriate for the Fourth of July, wouldn’t you say?” Natasha suggested, helping herself to another samosa and tearing it delicately between thin fingers.
“Seriously? After that rousing speech about not ruining tonight?”
A tentative tendril of hope peeks out between the carefully constructed shards of Tony’s shattered heart, wondering if maybe Steve is starting to see. To understand.
“Forgive me.”
Out of the corner of his eye he can imagine Tony at the coffee machine, hands flying like little birds that light on coffee mugs and bags of fancy, dark roast beans. When he looks over, the kitchen is empty but Steve’s chest feels full and content.
There aren’t any more pieces left on the plate, so Tony plucks another clementine from the basket of fruit on the table and carefully peels back the skin. He separates it into two halves, laying one down for Morgan to pull apart before he peels off a piece from his own.
They’d almost lost that. Steve had almost lost him, but now as he watches Tony across the shop, talking quietly with the owner, all Steve can focus on is the casual way he leans against the counter. When Tony smiles and turns on the charm, Steve’s stomach swoops all over again.
Tony thinks about the few people in this world that find their way back to each other, even after they separate. A farce, really, or a B-level Hallmark movie.
Steve drops the block of wood in his hands and stares down at his feet. His shoulders arch into a pathetic hunch, and in that moment, he looks so small, so vulnerable. “
Tony closes his eyes and lets out a breath. He’s a weak, broken man. What’s the use in pretending otherwise?
Peter snorts. “If that’s not really true, then that’s kind of rude, Mr. Stark.”
Tony turns the letter over, thinking there must be more.
Tony choked on a sob, freed from the hands holding him back to collapse half on top of Steve, smothering him with his weight even as Steve tried to prop himself up. Steve gasped for air and brought up water of his own. Salt and bile speared across them both as Steve heaved up his share of the ocean but one of his arms was looped around Tony’s waist and it was enough.
Steve had missed at least three of the last seven meals which, maybe that was okay, because Tony had gotten to enjoy three more meals than he would have, two of which were homemade. The feeling of being more at ease in his own home is a nice treat.
“Then why don’t you?” Steve snaps, jaw clacking like a rabid dog even as his entire body rejects what he's said, stepping between Tony and the doorway in an unconscious movement, maybe, blocking Tony’s exit even as he pushes him to go.
He doesn’t want to break this time.
It’ll be a short mission, recon only, just the Captain and Widow in stealth mode from the Quinjet, but the same sense of dread lingers in his belly all the same. It hasn’t been long since Steve almost drowned in the Potomac, while Tony was dealing with the Mandarin and he’s not ready to lose what they have—neither of them are.
“It’ll be hard for him, Rhodey,” Tony runs a hand through his hair and tips his head. “Hell, it was awful the first few times I ran through that sequence I prepared for the MIT grads. I mean, I know
He leans in and takes it from her hand, nipping her fingers as he does, and she shrieks with laughter, squirming in the high chair.
But the suit doesn’t open and there’s a long pause before JARVIS speaks again.
“So maybe we could try—I don’t know, just, I want to be better. For you, Tony. Please give me another chance to get this right.”
“Hi, buddy.” Steve really is going to cry now. He wraps both arms around DUM-E’s struts and hugs him, leaning all his weight on the bot as the whirring gets louder. DUM-E vibrates in his eagerness, the pulses reverberating through Steve’s body in little quakes. “I missed you.”
His days became wracked with the lingering smell of coffee and cream.
“It’s ridiculous.” He muttered, resisting the urge to preen under Steve’s attention, the reptilian part of his brain screaming with joy that he’d pleased his mate.
Bucky Barnes had never been one to tiptoe.
He sees the hurt in Tony’s eyes, filled with tears and betrayal as the video of his parent’s death plays on a loop. He remembers the day Ross came and he didn’t back down; the fight they’d had at Clint’s farmhouse and going to bed alone with only his secrets for comfort.
Unsurprisingly, it’s not a shock when he hears the light beep of a key card against his room’s lock. The door handle turns and slides open to reveals his beloved husband in the same sharp cut suit he’d been wearing earlier as he steps over the threshold.
“Let me go. Tony. Let me go.”
. I don’t care that you’re sorry.”
Rhodey is a little harder to shake, but when Tony eventually promises to call him in the morning, and asks him to take care of the arrangements for when Rogers and his team arrive, it seems to pacify him. Admitting he doesn’t have the energy for any of this earns him a gentle, supportive response. It’s not Tony’s fault that Rhodey assumes he’s going to be getting an early night.
Nothing can take it away. Tony tries to tell Steve that with his body, fuck the loss back inside of Steve where he can keep it for his own.
Steve rolled out of the bed and stumbled into the bathroom, cleaning up himself before bringing a wet cloth back to clean off the puppet. When there was no evidence left, Steve set the puppet back where it belonged next to the lamp on the night table and snuggled back into the warmth of his bed.
Steve sighed knowing a losing battle when he saw one. “I’ll just make it all.”
It’s not long before the pizza arrives and they crowd around the long dining room table, which, Tony realizes, is going to need more chairs. There’s only a half dozen left empty, four of which could easily be occupied at any given time by their absent Avengers and Parker. Not to mention significant others, ex-SHIELD agents, and certified extended family members. Happy, Aunt May, Pepper, Rhodey’s mom.
“You need to get lower.”
“Don’t mention it. Shuri would be able to put it together for you. We’ll work out the kinks when you’re settled into the Compound.”
this. He gets to have this for the rest of his goddamn life.
The leap of faith feels worth it. And if he’s jumping right into the fire, it won’t be so bad. Tony’s been burned before.
Before he’d come out, after Afghanistan, Tony had lived as an alpha for a long time, dampening his scent and downing suppressants like candy. He’d moved on since then, but nesting remained a sore subject.
Steve sucks in a breath and wraps thin, translucent fingers around Tony’s wrist. For a moment, he tries to pry him back, struggling even when it’s futile but the air around them crackles with anticipation and Steve doesn’t want Tony to let him go, not really.
Tony narrows his eyes when Rhodey slides a twenty under the spot Peter often occupies at the table.
It’s been a long time since he’s picked up a pencil. His muse died on the battlefield years ago.
“I’m sorry about what happened,” Steve blurts, because it feels like the next right thing to say. It seems to catch Tony off guard.
Tony surges forward and kisses him, spicy and sweet, deeper than Steve would have anticipated. Tony kisses with fierce determination and confidence, like Steve already belongs to him and this is just another way of staking that claim.
The thrusters kicked in and sent him jetting down, down, down, until the pressure of the deep had the suit shrieking and whining under the strain. He was so close, so close, he could almost reach out and—
Steve pushes off the curb, looming over Tony the way he always does when he’s starting to lose ground and resolves himself to push on. Tony flinches without meaning to. Maybe once upon a time that had worked, or Tony had ceded ground because it had felt like the right thing to do. But not now. Not anymore.
“Into all of what, Romanoff?” He drawls. “I’m here, aren’t I? You’ve got all the comforts of home again. It’s a damned family reunion.”
“We sleep better together, always have.”
in the suit, tucking an arm around Steve’s waist and hooking a leg around both of Steve’s ankles before Tony barrel rolls them through the sky. It’s Coney Island kicked up to the max, and Steve’s stomach rolls and pitches but he can’t stop smiling.
Steve resists the ridiculous urge to press his hand over the glass, painfully aware of Pepper and Rhodes watching him. They care about him, and he knows this. He and Tony have been together long enough now that Tony’s friends have become his friends too, but he still has his reservations. When it’s not their team, Steve feels on edge. He wishes he didn’t, but he does. He keeps his hand to himself and drops his gaze.
Peggy was a goddamn powerhouse and that whole time, she’d known. She’d known, and she’d never said anything. And as always, she had been right.
“What are
“That was fantastic.” Bruce proclaimed one night, sliding a plate practically licked clean towards the centre of the table.
He bites down, hard, sucking the blood from Steve’s lip before thrusting his tongue into his mouth to lick behind his teeth. Tony’s breathing goes ragged, and his hands don’t stop tugging to get away. It’s as if his body and mind are at war, and Steve is bound to be the casualty between them.
“There’s an issue with the B.A.R.F. sequencing, Boss,” FRIDAY chirps, interrupting Tony with a cup of coffee halfway to his mouth and a mostly-eaten container of Chinese takeout balanced on one knee. It was late into the evening, sometime after midnight, and Tony scarfed down the food in the cover of night. Not that he had anything to hide. It definitely wasn’t stolen from Clint.
“You know, Steve didn’t even apologize. Not once.”
“He’ll be pissed if you suggest something of his own masterful creation is on the fritz.” Steve warned and Bucky shot him a grin.
“Oh, well that changes everything, doesn’t it! You’re sorry! So what? Apologies don’t bring my parents back, Steve. It doesn’t undo all the time you’ve been lying to me. It doesn’t give me back all the time I could have spent tracking down your fucking
“Gross, no dismemberment during mealtimes,” Clint flicks a piece of the arm off the table and back towards Bucky. It bounces off his chest and onto the floor.
“Have you tried flirting?” Tony asked, indulgently, holding up his hands in defense when Peter shot him an exasperated look. “Okay, okay, have you tried flirting a bit more obviously? I mean, sometimes you really need to spell it out for someone–”
Steve knew too. Ever since that very first day. A mountain of Ross’ paperwork couldn’t keep him away.
For six months Tony doesn’t hear anything from Steve. He figures it out. Life slowly starts to get better, and in the two trips he’s made the Compound since the gala they’ve avoided each other entirely. It’s not ideal but Tony can make his peace with that because the dull ache and a few days of living life in monochrome is an infinite improvement over being ripped apart and having his heart stomped into the pavement.
But Steve has him. Steve and his massive, incredibly strong arms. Steve won’t let him fall.
He reaches down to fist himself roughly, fucking hard and fast back onto Steve’s cock and forward into the tight ring of his hand. Steve slides a hand up his belly and over his chest soft and loving, in stark contrast to the way he’s taking him.
’ and ends with ‘
“Tony, doll, you should have said something.” Bucky’s voice was gentle and soothing as he shuffled closer, crouching down beside Tony’s curled knees.
It must just be some minor suit damage, because though Tony isn’t responding he appears to be picking up on what Steve is saying over the team line. Just as requested, Iron Man turns and starts blasting towards him, landing on the ground a few steps away and firing a repulsor blast at Steve’s shield.
, in his expression is so tangible it’s infectious.
By the time he gets back to the Compound, he has five new text messages from Rhodey, and one from Pepper which turns out to be from earlier anyway; a reminder for dinner that evening that he ignores, for now.
“Hey, you alright?” Steve pants out a breath, eyes roving over the armour.
“I love you,” Steve forces out through gritted teeth. “Always together.
That had been
He thrusts deep into his throat, savouring the way Tony chokes just enough to pull back before he dives back in, meeting every roll of Steve’s hips like he was made for sucking his cock. Spit drips out from the corner of his mouth and onto the hood of the car between Steve’s legs, and below him, Tony’s free hand starts working on his own cock.
No, he decides. Steve doesn’t want to talk.
It’s the next best thing to punching him because he can bite down on his bottom lip until he tastes copper and fist his hands in that long blond hair and
“Oh, fuck off, Cap.”
Happy insists on watching old reruns of Downton Abbey, and when Pepper visits, she covers Steve in blankets when he drifts off on the couch. When he wakes, there’s a marker in his book placed on the coffee table. Pepper smiles across from him in the overstuffed armchair with the same softness he’s seen her offer Tony when he’s passed out on the leather couch in the workshop.
Bucky loved him this way – either of them, really – wanting to watch every flutter of emotion and sensation as it crossed Tony’s face. He liked to suck the air from Tony’s lungs and swallow his cries until Tony was a gasping mess, Bucky the only thing he could see, taste, smile.
Comments are much loved, let me know what you think!
Because Tony is dead. Gone.
“Tony,” Steve groaned, barely more than a whisper, thrusting up into his fist and gasping as he imagined Tony watching, licking his lips and oh—
“He doesn’t really want me to get off.” Tony threaded a hand in the back of Steve’s hair and gave him a pout. “He just wishes there was–”
Steve has changed. They’ve both changed over the years, but reading this. Steve has
For some reason, it doesn’t feel as good as it normally does. When Steve’s had a chance to apologize, when they’ve half-ruined each other and left throbbing, purpling bruises on hips and shoulders, it feels like a salve to have earned Tony’s love. To know that he’s worked it, to know that it comes on the heels of something painful because everything between them has
He groaned.
Tony searches the skyline and comes up short. “Where is he?”
The other Alpha was insatiable and between him, and their greedy little Omega, Steve was concerned about the very real prospect of spending the rest of his life overexerted and exhausted.
“Yeah.” Steve lets himself relax back into the pillow, accepting defeat. “Do you know what happened? After I fell?”
Because Steve isn’t there, not really.
Just out of sight, Tony leans up against the wall, taking a deep breath and begging his subconscious to hold back the oncoming panic attack. He has shame in droves already.
Tony freezes for a second, hands flying off Steve’s shoulders. “Stop?”
The hands on his hips are biting into his flesh and Tony reaches down to press one harder, hoping Steve gets the message. When he does, Tony whines into his mouth, the pain-pleasure blurring together, recreating the bruises that Tony has always cherished there before.
“Oh, ho, Barnes, those are fightin’ words.” Tony throws his hands up from where he’s been tinkering on the 1932 roadster Bucky drools over. The first time he’d laid eyes on it, Steve had gotten an earful about keeping secrets and hoarding the wealth, and it had taken less than an hour for Bucky to drag Tony back down to the garage with permission to play.
, he tells himself with a fierce determination.
Although he’s pretty sure she meant to be sarcastic.
Tony reaches out towards the bottle of scotch and pours himself another drink, bigger than the others.
When he was awake, Steve assured himself. He could have that, too. Later.
“You fucked up. You fucked up again, Steve, and admitting it is the first step to fixing the problem. Just. Admit. It.”
“Oh, fuck that’s good.” Tony groans, pressing erratic kisses into Steve’s collarbone.
and ends with
“Tony, I don’t think that’s—”
“You’re not in charge here, Steve.”
The light from the chest plate was an eerie glow, following Steve’s body down like a homing beacon and Tony prayed he would reach him in time.
“People?” But Steve already knows. He doesn’t know how he knows, but there’s a little tug at the back of his mind and he can
Until the alarm had gone off and Tony had insisted that they not let all of the prep Steve had gone through go to waste, pulling Steve up the bed and lining up his cock before Steve thrust in to the hilt. The sweet whispers turned to filth and rushed desperation to pull another orgasm out of Steve because,
Steve blinks.
Peter gets the gauntlet in his webs, and then it’s in Captain Marvel’s arms. Before he can blink, it’s wrapping around Bruce, molding to his charred, burnt arm.
B.A.R.F. makes up the largest room on the floor, empty and pristine with an oversized armchair for maximum physical comfort in such an emotionally devastating environment. There are small off-shoots; a kitchenette and a bathroom, and two more intentional rooms.
“Actually, I’m really glad you asked, Cap, because no. We can’t talk about it. Not now, not later, definitely not when you get back. I may not have a choice over any of what’s happening here and all the things everyone else believes they can tell me to do. But I damn well won’t be listening to you. I don’t care what you have to say, I don’t have the time and frankly, I don’t want to hear it.”
When he takes a breath and exhales, the pain subsides. Not entirely, not quite yet, but it eases.
Tony grins. “There’s only so much genius to go around and you’re looking a little worse for wear these days. Don’t sweat it.”
Awe blossoms across Tony’s face, and Steve will swear later that he saw a shimmer of tears. And Tony calls him the sap.
Honey and flakey pastry explode in his mouth at the same time he tastes the edges of Tony’s fingers, barely touching them with the tip of his tongue.
He’d hoped that he would have more time. Not that he’d done a particularly good job at hiding this. If anything, he’d expected his partners to figure it out sooner.
“Can we at least keep the nest?” Bucky asked, tugging both men back down and yanking blankets this way and that to cover them.
“You really want to get on Pepper’s bad side, do you?”
“It’s about your parents.”
No. He really hasn’t.
That had been too close, and Steve wasn't prepared to lose him again. Hell, Steve isn’t prepared to lose Tony,
When he finally strips the webbing off of his uniform and tosses it into the corner of the gym, Natasha is at his side, a subtle tilt of her head enough of a signal that Steve knows his next play.
Steve felt a phantom kiss to his lips and smiled, letting his eyes drift close to savour the moment. He floated along the sea of endorphins and imagined Tony tucked in beside him with his head on Steve’s chest, tracing little patterns across his belly and traversing the trail of hair that led down from his navel.
, sits heavy and unspoken between them. “We need to move on Steve. We need to figure out how to have a life now. They’d—” Tony’s voice cracks. “They’d want that, wouldn’t they?”
“I don’t want to, Steve. I don’t want to.” Tony searches his face, jaw tight as arousal wars with doubt and fear, plain as day.
“We need to–”
He bites back a sigh, because every other time it’s been Steve trying to talk or ask him something he doesn’t want to answer, or even criticize him. He’s just… tired of it all.
“Alright, I’m outta here. If you fuck on the car, wipe down the hood,” Bucky says as he passes them.
The room swirled with the heady mixture of their arousal and the sweet scent of Tony’s nest. Floating along the high of it, Tony closed his eyes, sensations washing over him in waves. Bucky alternated between deep licks into the cavern of his body, and teasing behind his balls, occasionally sucking one into his mouth and driving him wild.
“People will suspect. They’ll talk.”
Steve shifts his stance and spreads his arms wide so Tony can take it all in. He knows what he looks like now. “Would
It’s an homage to the way Steve’s features had contorted when Tony had handed him the divorce papers, but infinitely worse because this time there’s an additional layer of fear that borders on terror. There’s something pinched around Steve’s mouth, the way it quivers in the corner, and Tony can see the rapid thrum of his pulse in the hollow of his throat.
Tony whines Steve’s name, long and high, thrusting counter to his rhythm for a little extra friction that makes his eyes roll back. Steve grips them tighter and all at once he’s right there on the edge.
“No pain?”
Tony still didn’t stir but he was no longer panting, his breath coming easier with just Steve’s hands on his waist so Steve brushed his knuckles over the slope of Tony’s perfect, round ass and savoured the way gooseflesh rose over his skin.
The burn is grounding and his body thrums with anticipation. It’s a special type of sin he won’t be absolved from, and Steve wants to come. He wants to come screaming with Tony so deep inside him he’s gagging on it.
Steve can’t think, he can’t breathe. The gentleness wraps him in a warm blanket but it feels like a lie. Steve’s nothing like this.
The floodgate opens and Tony’s hands are vicious on his skin, gripping and pulling at his clothing as he manhandles Steve over towards the desk. He palms Steve’s tiny ass with both hands before he reaches down and hoists him up onto the desk by his thighs. Steve gasps again, right into Tony’s mouth, clutching at his jaw and the ragged remnants of his goatee, lost in day’s worth of stubble.
Tony’s mind screamed and twisted away from it, the bond in the back of his mind snapping and exploding into a million tiny shards. What was left of the connection to Steve was torn away from him and for a second there was nothing – he was alone – what?
The desire to see if it’s possible to work this through, to rebuild, surprises him.
Striding back out of the Clerk’s Office almost a half-hour later, papers tucked under one arm and cell phone in the other, Tony finds Steve still waiting for him outside.
“We’re going to need to figure this out at some point, Tony.” Steve says from behind him. “You can’t just think this is going to get any better if we don’t talk about it. You could at least try.”
“You need to breathe, Steve. Take a deep breath,” Pepper is repeating the same two sentences over and over again which seems odd until Steve realizes it’s because he’s holding air in his lungs and refusing to let it go. As if exhaling would mean admitting that Tony is gone.
He wants to beg for it. He doesn’t even need to come, not if Tony will take the weight off of his shoulders, even for a second.
The fact that she can admit she’s made mistakes and isn’t perfect is far more than he could ever expect to get from Rogers anyhow. He should take it. Maybe if the world doesn’t end, they’ll come back to it again sometime.
“Before, when I couldn’t wake you—”
“Bite me.”
When Bucky suggests a late-night spar, Steve follows him out of the room and Tony finds himself alone again. As if by magic, Bucky appears more and more, verbally stepping between him and Steve whenever Steve engages Tony directly. When things heat up during meals, or in the middle of a drill, and even when they’re all piled around the conference room table, Bucky is a constant source of safety between them.
“Hey.”
Tony sighs. “It’s not helping much of anything.”
make coping with trauma look like a cakewalk, but it’s going to be tough on him.”
Peter has never grasped the art of subtlety and it shows as he tugs off his jacket and tie, tossing them haphazardly onto one of the chairs near the sofa and propping his socked feet up on the long living room table.
Steve just wants to feel alive.
Bruce had brought him a durian, which had stunk up the entire Tower and led to the strict implementation of a no-smelly-foods-in-the-house rule. When Clint brought him a wedge of blue cheese later that week, they made him try it on the roof. Smell wise, it had hardly compared by half.
“He’s not staying in Wakanda.” Tony’s anger wafted through in a fresh wave as Steve shot Bucky a helpless look. “Also, in the future, if you could let me know if I have an audience, I’d appreciate it. Just, please, tell me you’re not taking this call in bed. No, actually, don’t tell me, I don’t want to know. Gross–”
Tony was silent for a long moment, so long Steve had almost slipped into sleep. Then he felt desperate, chilled lips against his own. He kissed Tony back, forcing every grain of love he had for him into the motion and when Tony broke away, he was breathing hard.
Tony will absolutely not glance to his left, where he can feel Steve’s eyes on him. Barnes’ eyes on him.
Where were they taking him?
. Bucky, a shadow over his shoulder, hands stripping off his shirt to explore the expanse of perfect skin.
“Tony?” Steve approaches with caution, dread creeping through his veins. “Is everything okay? Pop the helmet for me, let’s get you over to medical.”
Is that true? Has Steve meant any of what he’d said, or were those Bucky’s words spilling from his mouth? And if it was true, why didn’t he stop? Why keep pushing and forcing Tony to bend, even after he realized that that’s what he’d been doing all along? Where’s the explanation for running roughshod over him all over again here, in New York, a year later and coming on the heels of his so-called revelation?
“A lot of things could go either way, with you.” Natasha hums which startled a laugh out of the billionaire. He stretched out, pinned her with a leer, and waggled his eyebrows.
Sometimes he thinks about the family he might’ve had with Steve, when Morgan’s brown eyes peer up at him and her face cracks into a smile. When in his dreams he can hear her voice calling out
“Steve.” Tony says it like an admonishment and Steve gives him a look. “They haven’t even said what they need our help with.”
