"Thank you for telling me," he said, finally. "It means a lot to me that you told me. And I'm not going to bench you. Of course I'm not going to. I told you that already and I meant it. I want you on this team. There's no one else I'd rather have at my side." Steve meant that in several more ways than Tony knew about. "If you tell me you can fight, then you can fight. I'm not about to second-guess your estimation of your own abilities."
Steve feels like he wants to cry. He's not sure he actually can, yet. He feels his mouth wobble. "Yeah," Steve says. "I know."
"Fuck," Tony muttered, distressed, looking down at his chest again, patting the metal implant with his free hand, and, yeah, Steve definitely hadn't been meant to see whatever that was in his chest.
When he'd woken up this morning, Steve hadn't imagined that by nightfall he'd be attempting to answer the question of exactly how much he should try to lie to Tony. He wasn't a good liar. He knew that. And he definitely wasn't any good at lying to Tony. But he couldn't tell him the whole truth.
He'd wondered why Iron Man had never even let him see his hands, but he knows now that it would have been a dead giveaway.
routine. And maybe that's why they get... complacent. Iron Man is in the air, tangling with the Black Knight, repulsor rays lashing either side of his opponent's flying horse, trying to draw him toward Hank and Thor, who will make short work of him. The Black Knight, for all his fearsomeness, can't fight at range, and that's where Iron Man excels. Steve avoids a blast from the Melter -- he doesn't know if the Melter can ruin vibranium, and he sure as heck doesn't want to find out -- as he squints up at the swirling figures in the skies. Iron Man keeps spiraling away, just out of his enemy's range--
"No," an older woman says urgently, "there's-- in 4-A, Beth's still at work, but her son just got home from school." She points at the window that Iron Man entered.
you. You've got some nerve, sitting here like everything's fine when you spent this morning-- God, I can't believe this."
"And if I have anything to say about it," Tony added, "you'll be spending the rest of your life behind bars. And trust me, I have a lot to say about it."
"It's three in the morning," Steve pointed out. "Bars are closed. Liquor stores are closed. And there's no alcohol in the house. And if you're planning on visiting me again -- which you are welcome to do -- I'm happy to keep making sure there's none in the house. And I'm definitely happy to not drink in your presence, or if I'm going to be in your presence. Or ever, if that's what you need from me."
? It didn't make any goddamn sense. It had to have been him behind it. But what in that footage had been worth killing for?
real, but those guys are just interested in scamming you out of your money. And don't answer anyone who claims to be a Nigerian prince, while you're at it. Also a scam."
Tony hissed through gritted teeth. "Steve, we've been over this. He has a duty to report the news accurately. That's-- it's basic journalism. And he admitted the story had been wrong! It's like you said, everyone makes mistakes. Isn't he allowed to make mistakes too?"
Carol was frowning, upset lines engraved on her face. Her domino mask wrinkled where her brow had furrowed. "And he
Oh, how he wished. God, he wished it could be Steve. It wasn't that Tony hadn't entertained the idea. Mostly he'd tried not to entertain the idea, because while thinking about Steve -- naked, bound, and begging to be allowed to please him -- had been responsible for several truly excellent orgasms in his life, he'd always felt so goddamn guilty when he was done because he knew Steve didn't like him like that. Steve didn't like men like that. Steve didn't like kink like that. He knew Steve wouldn't have liked anything about that.
And that was nice, but-- "Why me, then?" Tony asked, and then he realized that was the world's most ambiguous question. "You, uh. You
They forwent the clich√© dinner-after-the-movie, which Steve was fine with, because it didn't seem fair for him to eat when Iron Man could only sip a drink through a straw.
Ordinarily, Steve probably wouldn't have mentioned a thing like that. He wasn't ashamed of having a pornography collection; he figured most guys had one. He was just private about it. It wasn't anyone else's business, and it wasn't exactly the kind of thing most people thought Captain America did; the subject had never come up with most of his girlfriends, and he assumed most of them had thought he didn't watch it. He didn't usually want to, when he was with someone. But in this particular case he'd figured that he was single, he wasn't going to be with a man anytime soon, and it was a safe way to, well, explore his sexuality.
"Aww," Jan had said, after those had been published, on one of her visits to the mansion. "You two are the absolute sweetest."
He wouldn't have gotten up to get Steve if he didn't think Steve could do something for him. Steve knew that. Tony might not have known what he needed, but he knew Steve could help him find it. It was how their friendship often worked; they each knew what the other one needed. So Steve was here. Ready to help.
Steve lifted his head and kissed Tony. Their lips met, again and again, Tony kissing him back like he couldn't possibly get enough. Steve felt much the same. He wanted this never to end.
When was the last person Steve has slept with who'd made him laugh in bed? He couldn't remember. It might have been Bernie. That had been years ago. But Tony had always made him laugh. And then, just as now, he'd follow it up with declarations that just melted Steve's heart.
Looks like Tony doesn't actually need to do the asking. It's nice to know they're already on the same page.
Jan squeezed his arm. "It'll be all right, Steve. I know it's rough, but he's made it through everything else, and he'll make it through this. And if he needs our help, then we'll help him. He doesn't have to do this alone. We're Avengers. No one has to do this alone." She smiled. "Hey, after we're done with the training assignments, do you want to start drafting a press release supporting Tony?" She made a face. "Or Iron Man? I suppose both of him could use it, honestly."
He doesn't know what to do about this. He wants to stand tall and hold out his shield and make Iron Man
He wants to wince. He's saying it because he cares. He knows he is. It just... never comes out that way when he actually says it.
Having frozen briefly as the shield flew past him, Ghost starts moving again; the shield sails back across the room, far above Steve's head. Ghost's featureless face is tipped upward as he watches it go.
"That's what I like to hear." Tony was unbuckling his belt, one-handed, with agonizing slowness, loosening the end of the strap where it tucked under the buckle. "I spent so long designing your uniform, you know," he said, a not-quite-idle observation. "Nice to get the chance to finally take you out of it." His other hand came up and slid over Steve's thigh. Not quite indecorous, yet, but definitely more than a friendly gesture. Steve still couldn't feel much through the fabric, but the intent definitely counted. "Is this what I'd do, in your fantasy?"
"Holy shit," Tony breathed, incredulous. He was shaking where he was pressed against Steve. "They got him. Oh, my God. They're going to get him. I think it's actually going to stick."
The crowd clapped politely while Tony held out a hand to the assembled Avengers. The lights glinted off the mail of Steve's armored shirt.
Tony hummed softly to himself, as if he'd found something about the banal threat somehow intriguing. "I've actually been to Hell, you know," he confided, and, wow, Steve really had to pay closer attention to some of those mission reports. "You get to visit a lot of interesting places in this superhero business. I met my father there. He had some similar words for me. And I punched him in his goddamn arrogant face and left him in Hell, where he belonged." He leaned in and smiled sweetly. "Someday you're going to join him there."
Carol nodded. "You definitely don't have to wrap your hands if you don't want to," she said, helpfully. "I wasn't planning to, and we both know you'll heal all the bruises in an hour anyway."
You'd think identical twins would have identical voices -- or at least similar voices -- but Steve's never had any trouble telling Tony and Gregory apart. Greg always sounds more officious. Arch. Cruel. Some of the other Ultimates -- and definitely some of the Avengers -- like Gregory better. They say he's smarter. He probably sounds like he's smarter. Steve just thinks he's an asshole. He's refrained, thus far, from telling Tony this opinion, because even though Tony doesn't like his own brother, it's different when the person who says it is your-- well, whatever they are to each other. Steve's still not certain.
Tony stared at him. "I thought you were seeing someone," he blurted out, and that was entirely the wrong move, because he hadn't said yes, and now Steve was going to think he didn't want him--
Steve sees blood dripping on the other side of the eye-slits, sliding down past the inside corner of one of Iron Man's eyes, like macabre tears; Iron Man's eyes are closed as he wheezes, gasping for air. How can Iron Man's identity matter more than his life?
"So, uh," Steve said, glancing significantly over at Tiberius' body. "What are the odds he's going to wake up soon? Any idea?"
. That was what it was. Happiness. Finally. "Thank God you kissed me, huh? I'd never have figured it out. I thought you were just an open-minded straight guy."
Steve smiles at Iron Man, hoping to put him at ease. It's hard to tell with the armor, but he thinks Iron Man is a little more relaxed. "Well," Steve says, "here I am with you, so it looks like you're doing better than him already, huh?"
"Of course," Steve said. "I remember you saying she'd agreed to be your resident AI. So I'm guessing that all worked out." He didn't understand where the armor fit into it.
Steve pinged the armor too, just in case; if Tony had suited up, he ought to have been getting data from it. And there was nothing. Tony wasn't in the armor. Cold sweat beaded on the back of Steve's neck. His heart was pounding.
Steve understood now, just why Tony was so miserable. Why this had been eating him up inside. It was a hell of a thing to learn that all that had been calculated. A deception. He stroked Tony's back. "You were being kind," he murmured. "You're a kind person, Tony. And just because he didn't deserve a single ounce of kindness doesn't mean that you did anything wrong. You wanted to help. He was wrong. What he did to you was terrible. But it doesn't make you wrong for-- for wanting to be good to him."
If Steve let him do this again Tony was going to get a proper cross, or at the very least figure out how to get him spread-eagled. "All right," Tony said. If Steve thought he could take it, then he could take it. "I'll see what I can do to get you all trussed up."
Embarrassment, it turns out, is an interesting emotion to have while not technically being alive. Steve glances away and expects the heat of his shame to warm his face. Then he realizes that that's not how it works without a heartbeat.
Some of the wires coming out of the box were attached to electrodes, which both Tony and Tiberius were wearing. They both had electrodes stuck all over their faces. Tony had a few more of them on his scalp, buried in his curling hair. Tiberius had those too as well as some on his chest and legs, probably monitoring his heart; Steve glanced over again at Tony's scarred chest with its strange metal implant and decided that Tiberius had probably seen that and given up on the monitoring.
"You don't want this," Steve says. His face is burning now, and he has to look away. He can't. It's his own fault for wanting too much. For wanting more than Iron Man wants. "You don't want me like that. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I just-- it felt good."
Tony shivers again underneath him, and, yeah, Tony likes this, all right. Steve manages not to rock up against him at that thought. He has some self-control.
"Mmmm, yeah," Tony breathes, his voice only a bit muffled by the pillow. "Thank you so much. That feels so good."
Tony was rubbing his chest again. It probably hurt. "It's fine, though," he said. "If it's you. You've seen my heart already. Doesn't really matter if you see it again. Not like you can think worse of me, right?" The stricken look in his eyes suggested that it actually did matter if Steve looked at him again but that he didn't feel like he could say so. "I suppose that's why Ty took my shirt off while I was passed out," Tony said, contemplatively. "He'd kept trying to, the whole rest of the week. He couldn't stand that I wasn't letting him see me, so I guess he took matters into his own hands."
By nightfall of the second day, he wanted to scream in frustration and also in actual pain. It was times like these that he dearly wished ordinary painkillers did
So Steve walks around the bed, to Tony's side. He steps in close and cups Tony's cheek, and Tony, still hungry for his touch, still needing as much as he can get, makes a small pleased noise and leans into Steve's fingers. Metal creaks, and if he leaned any more, he'd topple over. The suit is probably keeping him from doing that.
Then the covers rustle and Tony turns around. Steve's eyelashes flicker. He's in REM sleep. He's probably dreaming. He looks like he's having a bad dream. He looks like he's going to be able to wake up soon. The spell has clearly worn off -- that part of it, at least.
Something twisted and awful knots up under Steve's breastbone. The internet had said it was okay now, liking men. Mr. Stark had certainly not hesitated to ask him out, after all. And Iron Man, though he'd obviously been surprised that Steve had asked, hadn't been appalled or disgusted or anything like that. But what if that's not true for everyone? What if the rest of the team thinks there's something wrong with the two of them going steady?
"I know you feel terrible," Steve said, and he hoped this was right. "I know you do. And you're telling me you want to drink. But that's-- that's a feeling. It's a lousy feeling, and maybe it's a feeling that'll be with you for a long time, maybe some days more than others, and I know that's lousy too. It's not fair, none of it. But the thing is, it's not an action. It's just a feeling. It's just wanting. Which doesn't mean it's not bad or it's not serious or it doesn't hurt. It's an upsetting, distressing kind of wanting for you to feel. I get that. But it's not a thing you're actually doing. Today you're not drinking. In my book, in anyone's book, that's a victory. They're two different things, the wanting and the doing. It doesn't make you wrong, or bad, or weak, or flawed, or-- or whatever you're telling yourself you are, to want something you know you shouldn't have. It just makes you someone who wants something. That's it." He met Tony's gaze. "I know you don't believe in God, Tony. So it seems awful cruel of you to believe you're a sinner. Because then who can forgive you? And if the answer's
Tony raised his eyebrows, and Steve could feel him tense up, just a little. Steve suspected, based on Tiberius' description of Tony's school years, that being a shy, sensitive, bookish child who loved fantasy roleplaying games hadn't exactly made him a lot of friends. Tony was probably used to derision, ready for it, even if he knew Steve would never have mocked him. Tony was twitchy about a lot of things.
Tony breathed in and out raggedly, noisily. "So it's over. It's going to be over. I'm on my way to Ty's right now. I'm almost there. I'm going to tell him everything I know. I'm going to break up with him. He's not going to get to do any of this to me anymore. It's done. And I never want to see him again in my life." Tony's voice had risen, strident, defiant, but then he quieted down again. "I don't know if you're still at the mansion, or if you're already gone, but I'm not planning to take long. I should be home in about an hour." His voice wavered. "And if you-- if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I think tonight I could really, really use a friend. And I'd-- I'd really like it if that friend were you, but I understand if you don't want that. But if you do, I-- I-- that would be really good." He paused. "I'm parked at Ty's now. I'll be home soon. Take care."
Tiberius' return to consciousness was less obvious than Tony's. It reminded Steve of how, back in the war, he'd learned to wake silently. To keep his eyes shut. To not give anything away. There was a little hitch in Tiberius' breath and his eyes fell shut; anyone watching him might have thought he'd fallen asleep as soon as Tony had removed the headset.
"--embarrassing, I know," Steve said, and somehow there was enough blood in his face to blush. "I'm sorry, I know it's--"
"Really," Jan said, nodding. "We're going back to the mansion, too. It's not like you'd be making us go out of our way. And our car should be here in a few minutes."
"I can undo it," Stephen says, determined to be excruciatingly precise. "But he'll remember everything. All of it. Including the fact that we previously mindwiped him. I can't make him forget only the Illuminati. Because of the nature of the first spell, I can't perform any other amnesia spells of this type that won't also anchor his present memory in 1945."
"Couple of hours," Steve said. "It's coming up on midnight." And then several other pertinent facts about the situation occurred to him. "Uh. The cops might or might not be coming. The guard downstairs was threatening to call them. I'm not sure if he did."
Tony shouldn't have been here. The program definitely hadn't aired yet. Was he mad about something else?
Tony was also somehow still flight-capable, because he leaped into the air, spiraled around to Radioactive Man's other side, hooked a hand into his clothes at the back of his neck, and dragged him into the air. One second, two, three -- and then they both vanished.
Tony nodded. "I-- I called him when I heard his parents had died. My parents had just died, so I knew what he was going through, right? I thought I knew, anyway. So I showed up at his place. I figured I could be there for him."
that's what he's doing," Steve corrected. "Because I saw him do it to you. And, hell, you've seen him trying to do it to me."
It's nowhere near as bad as it could be. They have food. They have water. They have enough power to keep the Quinjet heated, if they stick to minimal heat. The Avengers will definitely find them by tomorrow morning. Jan's definitely not going to give up on them. The comms are too fried for an emergency beacon, but there was a set of flares in one of the kits. Steve put a couple of them out half an hour ago, venturing out onto the featureless snowy plain, and he plans to keep replacing them as they burn. The team knows their flight path, and it's not like there's much else to see in -- where are they? Greenland? Probably Greenland.
What was Steve supposed to tell him? He didn't know what the right answer was. He didn't know what Henry would have told him or what Carol would have told him. He didn't even know what
"I do have some news," Tony said, because he always, always wanted to make Steve feel better. "Not a lot, but it's better than nothing."
It's a joke. Innocuous. But it does bring up the issue of what Tony is wearing. Or isn't wearing. On the one hand, Steve doesn't want Tony to think Steve is expecting something more... risqu√©... out of this experience, because it's not like this is a pretext for seduction. On the other hand, Steve doesn't actually know what
Did Tony really think that Steve would insist on doing something Tony didn't want, just to increase his own pleasure? Well, he probably didn't think
"You all right there?" Steve calls out, as Tony lets the chestplate drop to the floor. Thank God he doesn't need that anymore, but Steve hopes his heart is charged up. There's a lurid line of bruising all across Tony's ribs where the side of the chestplate hit the side of the Quinjet. Tony is so very lucky it wasn't worse.
For half a second, Steve was swamped by blind, unreasoning anger. All he could see was red. How the hell could she ask him that?
Iron Man laughs, and the sound is almost sad. "That's because you're trying harder than anyone has in my entire life. And even so, there are things you don't know about me. Things you wouldn't like if you knew them."
It's easy now not to focus on anything, to let everything float away, tipped over the side into a fast-moving current. He doesn't need anything back.
Stephen's eyes are shut, his hands still stretched over Steve's face, and other than the tiny tremble in his fingers he hasn't moved at all for the past ten minutes.
And then Tony spoke. "You're not the first person who's ever asked me that, you know. I have a lot of enemies. You're nowhere near the worst of them." He sounded almost contemplative. "You know what the answer is? You're looking at the wrong things." And then he rounded on Tiberius, and his voice rang out. "So I cried a lot. So what? So I got the shit beaten out of me on a regular basis by a whole lot of people who were a whole lot bigger than me. So what? So I'm as queer as a three dollar bill." Tony's voice trembled ever so slightly. "Again,
"I promise," Steve repeated. He smiled softly. "I know what I'm getting into, eyes open, and I still want this. I want you. I do know you, you know."
Tony's eyes were bright, eager, full of affection. A gorgeous, fathomless deep blue. The first thing he'd ever seen, really seen, in the future. He'd known then that he was welcome here. He could never have imagined this, and at the same time it felt as if they'd always been meant to be here. Everything had led to this. Every fight at Tony's side, every speech for the crowds, every lazy weekend in the library, every team dinner, everything Tony had ever made for him, every time Steve had saved Tony's life, every time Tony had saved his -- it had all brought them here.
Tony gave him an odd look. "Don't I always?" he murmured. And then he sighed again. "Oh, geez. I really should go, Cap, I'm sorry. Now I have to go talk to a lawyer before they haul me in for questioning. How is this always my life, huh?" He grinned, but even the grin looked weary, and for some reason he was rubbing his chest. "I'll get to that dictation program as soon as I can, all right? Don't fret. I haven't forgotten about you."
That seems... concerning. "But you're safe, right?" Steve asks. "I mean, you're charged now? All charged?"
He looked up, and Tony was staring back at him with an odd combination of bitterness, longing, and what looked like sheer terror.
He swallowed hard, briefly grateful that his expression was obscured by the armor, and glanced over to find Steve staring up at the mansion, his jaw tensed as if, underneath the cowl, his face were identically furrowed.
But Tony was craning his neck, looking around the room like he was looking for someone in particular, and his smile faded rapidly.
"Sorry," Tony said, putting out a hand to steady him, taking the glass of water with his other hand. "I just thought I'd stretch my legs a little. Before we get to the worst part of this."
"You love me," Tiberius implored him, one last argument. "I know you love me. I know you've always loved me--"
If she thought she was going to make him ashamed of caring about Tony, she had another think coming.
"I had a chance," Tiberius continued, more quietly, "because I realized just how weak you were. And that was my way in. You cried because you missed your mother. You cried because your father never loved you. You cried because he liked to get drunk and hit you, remember?" he said, smirking, and God, oh God, this was what Steve hadn't ever wanted to know. "We both know you deserved it. You weren't the son he wanted." He snorted. "All you would have had to do to earn his respect was shape up and be a real man, Tony, and you couldn't even do that!"
Then he feels warm air against his skin, hears the quiet sound of an exhalation, and it hits him all at once: Iron Man's not using the vocal filters because Iron Man's
Without knowing who the rest of them were or what they had done, Steve already knew how it had happened. Tony fell in love fast, and Tony fell in love hard. Tony was loyal, caring, kind, devoted, and deeply trusting. And it was so, so easy for someone with ill intentions to use all of that against him.
Ordinarily, Tony might have tried to brush away praise or compliments. Steve was expecting him to ask why, to question him, to tell him he wasn't worthy of this. And maybe that would come later. But right now every time Tony tried opening his mouth he just started smiling again, like everything in him was determined not to let him ambush his own happiness. It was the most beautiful sight Steve had ever seen.
"So," Walders began, with a gleam in her eye, "if you admit that you think of him as an honorary Avenger--"
And then, oddly, Steve's gaze darted away and back, like he was nervous, which was bizarre, because Steve didn't
"Well, well, well!" the stranger called out, in a bright and pleasant tone. "What have we here? Could it be the number-two richest man in America?"
"--but given that there has already been damage to his memory from the initial spell, what you want may be impossible." He pauses. "I think you need to consider... what you can live with."
Tony was, of course, trying to get the IV out himself, but he still didn't have enough coordination even to get the tape off, and he obligingly let go when Steve tugged at his hand. Figuring he might as well get it all done now, Steve gently peeled off all the electrodes, head to toe. Tony was definitely going to need to wash his hair to get the paste out. Steve was rubbing intently at the remnants of the electrode adhesive on Tony's cheekbone, before he realized he was still holding Tony's hand, and his face went hot. He needed to stop doing that. Touching Tony like that. He knew it was unwelcome -- or, at least, it would have been unwelcome had Tony known everything Steve felt for him, and that worked out to the same thing.
"But there has to be something the doctors can do for you." He doesn't know if that's true, but he wants it to be. Surely the future has everything. "There are drugs now for that, aren't there? I know I've heard of one. You must have heard of it too, if even I have." He racks his brain. He can't quite remember what it was called. "Starts with a V, maybe?"
"I'll be very careful," Steve promises, and then his arms settle around Tony, his mouth meets Tony's, and the awful weight in Tony's chest starts to lift. It's not gone, not yet, but it's going, it's going, and he's going to live through this after all.
Keeping the rest of him perfectly still, Tony glances over to the open doorway, a query and a warning. The voices of the rest of the Avengers are too faint for him to hear now. It's unlikely that any of them are going to need to come back here anytime in the next hour or so. However, Steve's usually a private kind of guy, and in Tony's experience Steve has never before been down to raw Tony on the briefing-room table where anyone could, theoretically, walk right past and see them. But there's a first time for everything, and Steve isn't one hundred percent Steve right now.
Tony grins affectionately and starts printing Steve's name and date of birth in his neat drafting hand. "Do you think the clerk's going to figure out who you are when she gets to the 1920 part?"
haven't. We can talk about what we want to do. Doesn't have to be right now. Doesn't have to be today. But we can figure it out, the same way we've figured everything else out. And I'm right here. I'm still going to be right here. And even if it turns out we disagree -- I'm not saying we will, but if it happens -- then I'm still going to be right here. We've been through worse, and we've survived it. You're not going to lose me, okay?"
He'd kept an apartment in Brooklyn for a few years. He'd briefly considered Manhattan, but the Lower East Side had changed so much. It hadn't felt like home anymore.
Steve stands on the sidewalk outside the mansion gate, watching as Iron Man braces one gauntleted hand on the car door that Steve just exited from and leans in to talk to Mr. Hogan.
Does Tony really think Steve won't give him absolutely everything he wants? Steve knows, though, that it's not about him. He knows how many other people Tony loved who hadn't given Tony anything he wanted.
Steve's face softened ever so slightly, smiling just a little more, just for him, and Tony knew that Steve had understood. Steve always understood. He was amazing. He was amazing and he
"It's an honor to make your acquaintance, Captain," Tiberius said. "I don't think I've ever met an Avenger before."
Now Tony was staring at him again, but he was staring at Steve like Steve had forgotten something incredibly obvious. "Of course I can," he said. He didn't sound arrogant or archly superior. He just sounded, once again, kind. As if, most of all, he wanted to help. Because he did. "I absolutely can. I thought I'd already-- I guess I must not have, huh?" He smiled a very small smile, and then he took a breath and started the explanation from the beginning. "Steve, I've got my own personal dictation software on all my computers. Better than the commercially-available stuff. Coded it myself. Probably right after the time I broke my hand, actually. It just never occurred to me that you'd want it -- or need it -- but I can absolutely install it on your account, if you think it'd be useful. I have admin rights; I can do it remotely. You don't need to do anything. I can do it right after breakfast, if you want. It needs to be trained to recognize your voice, but I have enough of your mission comms chatter saved in the mainframe that I can do that part, too. And then you can dictate all your reports."
," Steve said, softly, and Tony was sure it was meant to be an admonishment but the way his mouth twitched with laughter suggested that he really didn't mind as much as he was trying to pretend that he did.
Tony's eyes are starting to water a little, but Tony already made it clear a long time ago that he likes that. To be honest, Steve likes it too. He knows he's not hurting Tony -- at least, not in any way that's
"Not weird," Tony assured him. "Very flattering, actually." Certain parts of Tony's anatomy were definitely feeling flattered, even in the armor.
"I assure you that, despite Baron Blood's best efforts, I'm still human," Steve said, smiling, hoping he sounded casual, trying to avoid thinking about touching Tony's neck. He could set his hand gently, so gently, against the vulnerable hollow of Tony's throat, trace a path up to his jaw, across his lips. No. Tony was
He picked a door at random; the room beyond it was also empty, but a little dimmer. It was also some sort of parlor, but a more intimate one. The furniture here was a deep red, and Steve was briefly distracted by the painting on the far wall. It was Baroque, definitely, and classical in theme, Bacchus to judge from the grapes; he hoped to God that it wasn't an actual Caravaggio, because he hated to think of Tiberius owning something good.
It was a full-strength punch that he'd never, ever have used on a baseline human. Some part of him suspected that most of the time he'd consider it vaguely unchivalrous to throw at a woman. But he knew Carol could take it.
"Nothing to be sad about," Steve tells him. It's difficult to form words. "So don't be sad, 'Venger."
"Of course," Steve says, grateful for the reprieve. He knows it's taking a lot out of Tony to ask for this. He shouldn't have had to. Steve knows what he wants.
Steve had always wondered how Tony had felt, back when he'd still been having heart attacks. But now he didn't have to wonder anymore, because it felt like his heart had stopped, as terror swamped him.
Iron Man's sigh is a heavy, crackling exhalation, like breathing into a microphone. "Maybe," he says. "I'm not an easy man to know."
The clerk is squinting at Steve. He's out of uniform. He's nobody. She has no idea who he is. He's the mystery man marrying Tony Stark. He kind of likes that.
Tony was smiling again, just a little. "It was nice of you to try to stand up for me in that interview. I appreciate it. Though I have to say, I do know you wouldn't turn me in if I were a murderer. No matter what you said to the rest of the world. You really do want the best for me."
"Steve?" Tony asked again. He was beginning to be concerned now, because this was very, very unlike Steve. "Everything okay, buddy?"
Ominously, Tony was silent. Steve could feel Tony's breath catch in his chest. Tony's whole body went rigid under Steve's hands. That was a no, then. Tony didn't want that at all. Steve's heart sank. Steve had said something wrong again, and he had no idea what. Was Tony the one man on Earth who didn't like blowjobs?
Ghost's triumphant laugh is muffled by his faceplate. "Is that all you've got, Captain? Really? That's not going to work." He pauses, thoughtfully, and his head tips in Tony's direction. "And you, Iron Man? Not even going to join in today?"
Could Steve just pull the electrodes and the IV without hurting Tony? He had no clue what the machine was, and while there was a very high chance that it wasn't doing anything good to him, the possibility existed that Tony would be worse off without it, or worse off if Steve suddenly unplugged it without shutting it off properly.
He rushes down the corridor into the sub's tiny head, shuts the door, rips his helmet off, and he doesn't even make it to the toilet or sink before the flowers start. They're roses, this time, falling into the curved shell of his helmet as he slumps to the deck. The petals are a striking blood-red, coming out of him in single petals at first, then clusters -- and then, finally, a damning full blossom.
"We did," Tony acknowledged, with a flash of a smile. "But he sure tried his best. I-- I didn't tell you about DreamVision."
Steve meant what he said to Mr. Stark: Iron Man doesn't have to tell him anything he doesn't want to. He's not going to pry. Iron Man's secrets are his own. Iron Man is here, and that's enough for him.
Iron Man is sitting on the edge of his seat, somehow tense. He makes a quiet, scratchy noise, like the needle jumping on a record.
Steve took another breath and steeled himself. He could say this. He'd come this far. He was brave enough to say it. He knew what Tony felt for him, even if Tony hadn't quite said it, himself. But Steve could be the one to say it. Tony needed to know.
!" Tony shot back, hotly, his voice rising to meet Steve's. "You were wrong then, and you're wrong now!" He drew a ragged, noisy breath, seeming to rein himself in. When he spoke again, he was calmer. But not by much. "For God's sake, Steve, Ty is one of the few people who has made this entire hellish week at all bearable!"
It could have been a seduction, a line straight out of a handbook, something he'd said to a dozen people. But the way he said it made it clear that it very much wasn't a line. His eyes shone with longing. He'd dreamed of this for years. Just like Steve had.
Jesus, no wonder Tony hadn't wanted to swallow. He probably hadn't even tried to tell Tiberius that. He'd probably just... let him do whatever he'd wanted. Because he'd just wanted to make him happy.
"What?" Tony was staring at him, confused, like the last sentence had blindsided him. "Steve, he didn't. He didn't hurt me again. That was it. What exactly do you think he did?"
"Fucking Madripoor," Tony said, with all the heartfelt emotion he was currently capable of, and then he passed out.
Steve nods; he can feel his face heat up even as the rest of the blood in his body keeps heading south. "I'm good," he says, hoarsely. "Maybe-- maybe a little too good."
"Yes, you." Steve's nerves are still singing with tension, but he manages to smile. God, he hopes Iron Man says yes. "Is there some reason I shouldn't ask you?" There is, of course, the most obvious answer. "Are you-- are you not interested in me?"
"I'm glad to hear it," Tony said, letting himself relax a little more, feeling the rush of power within him, "but I thought you promised me more noise than that."
The television studio looked exactly like every other television studio Steve had ever been in. The 20 Vision set was a bland beige, and the rest of the room was full of banks of bright lights, several huge cameras, taped-down cables snaking across the floor, and a whole lot of very busy people running about.
Steve throws himself to the ground just in time, as one of the Enchantress' blasts of magic goes over his head.
Tony smiled and lifted his water glass in Steve's direction, an impromptu toast. "To friendship, then?"
It wasn't as if he'd never seen Tony in various states of undress before, over the years. The Molecule Man mission came to mind. Hell, Tony had already been stripped down to his underwear once tonight. But it was different now. Everything was different now.
"Look," Tony says, sounding defensive, even though Steve hasn't made a sound, "I just like to feel pretty, okay? It's not a crime."
Steve frowns at the message. He'd been planning to just show up in his uniform -- he's gotten the impression that Iron Man likes the look of him in it -- but Iron Man wouldn't request otherwise if he didn't have a good reason.
He finally meets Steve's gaze. "We need to talk." Iron Man's voice is flat, hard, forceful. "We need to talk
That didn't necessarily mean that the box's owner had super-strength, of course; it wasn't that easy. He had no idea if they were a top or a bottom, and they could very well be a top seeing someone -- or multiple someones -- with super-strength. Or they just liked to keep their options open.
Tony lowered his head again, tucking his head under Steve's chin. He was still shaking. Steve wanted to pet his hair, but still didn't know where Tony had hurt his scalp earlier; asking would have made too much of it. Then Tony flung his arm over Steve's chest and somehow drew himself even closer, desperately seeking reassurance, solace, safety.
No one had ever really liked him running his mouth off in bed. Too sweet, they always said. Too sweet and too much, like Steve was some kind of decadent dessert they'd ordered at a restaurant and wanted to send back to the kitchen. Usually he tried to tone it down, but, well, he'd wanted Tony so much. It had all just... happened.
He'd been expecting cold, unyielding metal, or -- at the very best -- room-temperature, but Iron Man is pleasantly toasty. Not burning, not hot to the touch, just nicely warm. He's not quite at human-normal, but he's pretty close to it. It's-- well, it feels
He was sure he knew how Tony was conceiving of this, conceptualizing what he was doing, because he'd thought of it like that at first too, just from the way Tony had talked about it. Tony had sounded a little concerned, a little tense, but not actually afraid. He battled supervillains every day of his life, after all. He was familiar with this. Confronting a villain, exposing their crimes to the world. That was what he did, routinely. And in a sense, that was what he was doing now.
," Tony said, in response to Steve's grimace. "That's much worse." And then he brightened. "Hey, do you want to go out with me tonight?"
Steve held Tony tight. He stroked his hair. His shoulders. His back; The fabric of Tony's borrowed t-shirt was wrinkled and bunched between his shoulder blades. "I love you," Steve said, fiercely. "I love you so much. It's not a lie. It's real. It's always been real."
He wondered what Tony was doing right now. Tony was probably seeking comfort from Tiberius. Steve hated to think of it. Tiberius had started this. Tiberius wasn't safe. It was just that Tony didn't know that.
"Yes, it's me," Steve said, and of course he could hear Tony whispering through the door. Super-soldier hearing. You had to love it. But Steve sounded oddly... guarded? Nervous? He was shifting from foot to foot, shoulders hunched, and that was definitely unusual. He looked like he wanted to hide behind his shield. dipping his head and shoulders to fit into the curve of it. "Can I come in?" he asked. His voice was somehow hesitant. "I'll only be a couple of minutes, I promise."
"I want to." Iron Man's voice is soft. He sounds like there's something else he wants to say, some other reason he wants to give that would discourage Steve, but when he speaks again, he must have changed his mind. "My God, Cap--
Steve could never have imagined this. He'd seen Tony kiss people before. He'd imagined something practiced, seductive, controlled, the way he'd seen Tony kiss people, his every move calculated to thrill and impress. He knew Tony's reputation. He'd paid attention to Tony's reputation. He'd had a lot of furtive late-night thoughts about Tony's reputation, about Tony pulling out all the stops, using every trick in the book just to wow him. But that, Steve realized, had been Tony Stark, international playboy. That had been the mask. The man in his arms now was undeniably
Eventually, Steve lifted his head. Steve was smiling now, and Tony, helpless, began to smile back. Steve wanted him. Maybe they could have this after all. This was really happening.
Outside, the sky is lightening into dawn. Tony can't see the sun from here, but when he walks over and opens the shades, he sees the light reflecting off mirrored skyscrapers, burnished gold and silver. He supposes he gets one last beautiful thing. He thinks about the warmth of Steve's hand on his face, barely an hour ago.
Yeah, that was definitely the problem that Tony thought he was having. The problem wasn't not wanting this.
It seemed like Steve was already way ahead of him, determined to have Iron Man inside him tonight after all. Tony nearly choked on his own tongue. "God, yes. Wouldn't miss it for the world."
had him killed. But Steve had no proof. Just as he had no proof that Tiberius was lying about being uninvolved with programming.
Steve's hand is splayed across the middle of Tony's back, and the muscles under his fingers are knotted tight, a tension given no release. Steve knows that's another thing that's his fault. Well, also Ghost's fault, but mostly his fault; he'd set up the scene earlier so that Tony'd be tense in a
Steve just kept smiling. "I don't think I've ever met the richest man in America before, either," he replied.
, okay? You are. So maybe I don't know your name, but I know who you are. You can't be someone you're not. Not like this. It doesn't work like that."
"You like that?" Tony murmured. He paused to rake his fingers over Steve's ass, to feel the way his warm skin was stippled, ever so paradoxically, with goosebumps. Steve shuddered when Tony dug three fingertips into one of the darker marks.
Tony peered down into his mug of tea, took a sip, winced, and said, "Hot." And then he raised his eyes over the rim of the mug and looked at Steve. "So I'm guessing there are several things you want to talk about," he said, surprisingly matter-of-fact. "And I'm guessing you're too polite to bring up one in particular."
Steve doesn't move. He's curled on the hardwood floor. Tony could kick him, if he wanted to. Steve can picture it.
Yeah, that was the level of coherence that Tony was looking for. Tony expected Steve to be out of words by this point, but somehow Steve kept going.
If Tony was willing to talk to him at all, he had one more chance to convince him to get the hell away from Tiberius.
Tony's still stroking him, ever so lightly, through the last of it, and he eases his hand away when Steve finally stops shuddering.
He was distracted. He'd let himself get distracted once more. Steve shook himself, clearing his head, and stood up a little straighter. There would be time to worry about the rest of it later. He had to get Tony away from here first.
They probably should have done the harness first, because Steve had to sit up again and let Tony buckle him in, but it was all worth it when Tony got to grab him by the harness and drop him to the bed. It wasn't like sparring; Steve was slow and easy, giving himself over to Tony.
that felt good. The sensation was a little blunted through the heavy fabric of his uniform, but the weight and warmth of Tony's body was exactly right, a presence he'd longed for for years. Tony kissed him again. He gasped against Tony's mouth; he couldn't quite stop himself from twitching his hips up against the lush curve of Tony's ass, looking for more, looking for everything and anything Tony would give him. He braced his hands on Tony's lower back, holding him steady, right where he needed him. He would have felt selfish, greedy, but not for the fact that Tony moaned, wordless and delighted, breaking the kiss to drop yet more kisses over Steve's face, desperate and uncoordinated, like all his focus had finally turned inward, like he was finally daring to reach for something he wanted, for himself.
Mr. Stark squints at him. "Are you all right there, Captain? Is something wrong? You look a little-- I don't know--"
Walders rose from her seat to talk to one of the assistants, but Tiberius stayed where he was, still smiling that satisfied smile.
Very belatedly, Steve realized what Tiberius must have meant, calling Tony the number-two richest man in America: Tony had once been number one. Steve had known Tony was rich, of course -- how could he not have known? -- but he didn't pay much attention to gossip. And it wasn't as if Tony had ever drawn attention to the fact. Not like Tiberius had. Here they were, celebrating his wealth. Steve didn't know what to say to that.
Steve regarded Tony's face critically, putting one thumb on Tony's eyebrow and pulling his eye a little wider, squinting at him in the light. "I'd tell you not to breathe in any of this shit," he said, hoarsely, "but it looks like AIM got you pretty good already."
It made sense. Of course it made sense. Tony wasn't going to believe something that didn't make sense.
He knew Tony wasn't saying that because he actually thought Steve might do it. He was just... scared. He was scared as hell. He'd definitely earned the right to be.
Jan pursed her lips. "Probably," she began. "It's also probably mostly what you think it is, although to be fair, I thought the part where Carol and Simon were together now was a bit of a surprise--"
Thirty-eight minutes in, Stephen opens his eyes and drops his hands. Sweat is beading on his forehead. "Done," he says, with finality. Tony can imagine he used to put down a scalpel and say the same thing.
"Are the rest of the Avengers here?" Tony panted. "Your team? Who did you bring? Where the hell am I?"
Tony's boots scrape against the linoleum. He takes one shuffling, scratching step, and then another. The sound echoes with awful finality.
But instead Tony was slipping the shield off and offering it to him, almost insistently, as if by mentioning the shield Steve had actually meant that he very much minded it. "No, no." Tony's voice was still muffled by the helmet, in a different way than the vocal filters did. Steve couldn't quite read his tone of voice this way. "Go on. It's yours."
This night just keeps getting worse and worse. Somehow, in the back of Steve's mind, some tiny part of him is actually, seriously pondering how this is a terrible lapse in information security on Tony's part. A few months ago Tony spent half an hour ranting about how one of Stark Solutions' clients was thoughtless enough to put their most sensitive data on their internal network. But Steve supposes anyone can make mistakes. If Steve's really unlucky, Tony's password is going to be
"And here we are," he said, unnecessarily, his voice too loud in his ears. "You should hop off first."
"And the guy's scum," Tony said, impatient, like that had been the wrong question. He sounded exhausted. "What else is new? He's the kind of weapons manufacturer who looks like he does most of his business with AIM and Hydra. Trust me when I say I know the type. He didn't admit to anything about Whiplash, but he showed me the prototypes for some armored battlesuits. The same armored battlesuits that attacked Iron Man a few days ago while I was testing my new teleportation functionality. And I didn't think it was a coincidence." Tony ran his hands through his hair. "Anyway, I was still working out how I was going to tell Ty not to bother with this asshole without mentioning the part where the guy tried to kill me twice, because Ty doesn't know about Iron Man. I hadn't told him the bad news yet. And then
Steve pleaded. He cajoled. He begged Jan. He agreed to take three of Wanda's monitor shifts next week, and he's definitely not looking forward to that schedule, but the point is, they're covered. Him and Tony. Short of threats severe enough that they pose a danger to the entire world -- Ultron, Kang, Galactus, Annihilus, Thanos -- everything that happens until five o'clock tomorrow is, blessedly, someone else's problem. Another Avenger will handle it. No one will bother Steve. No one will bother Tony.
"But just in case Tony changes his mind," he said, because he was going to be better, because he had so much to atone for, because there was so much he'd done wrong when Tony was drinking, "I think it'd be a good idea to keep Henry... uh. I'm trying to think of a phrase that isn't
He reached out again and put his hand on Tony's shoulder. Tony's shirt was thin enough that Steve could feel the heat of him through the cotton. He really needed to stop thinking about things like that.
And Steve's head is still in Iron Man's lap. Neither of them moved all night, it seems. And despite Iron Man saying he'd wake Steve up, he's definitely asleep now, sitting upright. His head is tipped back against the couch cushions, and Steve can hear his slow, even breaths. One of his hands is curled over Steve's shoulder. It's not possessiveness, exactly. He's not holding Steve  like he thinks he owns him. He's holding Steve like a child might clutch a beloved blanket or toy, like Steve can keep him safe from whatever nightmares live inside his head.
Tiberius stepped forward, his gaze roving over the front row of onlookers. "If I could kindly have a volunteer from the audience?" He leaned down and beckoned at someone Steve couldn't see from this far back. "Yes, you. Thank you, miss. Now just make your way up here, if you please, and have a seat in this chair--"
"So I can't tell you I'd never do that," Steve said, his voice rough with pain, "because you can't believe me."
But Steve's going to help him, because he's Tony's teammate and Tony's friend and Tony's lover and Tony's dom. Right now, the last of those is the most relevant. It's his job to take care of Tony until the scene's over, because he's put Tony in a state of mind where he can't take care of himself. It's just that right now, taking care of Tony is also going to include getting him through a fight with Ghost in one piece. And while ordinarily Tony is more than competent to do that on his own, he's sure not right now. And that makes him Steve's responsibility.
"I love you," Steve repeated, smiling, as a wave of tender fondness swelled up inside him. Tony's eyes went half-lidded, and he shivered against Steve's fingertips in a way that looked much more pleasant now. Yeah, Tony definitely liked that part.
And then, because he could, he leaned in and put an arm around Tony, drawing him close, and kissing him lightly on the mouth. For a few blissful seconds, there was nothing in the world but Tony, leaning right back into him. And Tony--
There's a long pause, and then Iron Man... bursts out laughing. "Oh my God," he says, still chuckling. "You actually read your spam. Why in the world do you read your spam?"
Maybe it wasn't a usual thing to think about a friend. Maybe most people didn't have a friend they admired more than anyone else they'd ever known. But it was what it was. Being Tony's fan was a better option than everything else he felt about Tony these days. Unfortunately, that wasn't an either-or option.
Another coughing fit is trying to come on. If everyone leaves soon, he can make it to the bathroom sink.
Tony laughed softly. "You sure know how to flatter a guy, huh?" he murmured, low in Steve's ear, like he was sharing a wonderful secret. "Just look at you. Beautiful." His other hand was still stroking Steve's inner thigh, a little higher up now. He was Steve's anchor.
So they're going to get through this the way they've always gotten through this. They're going to untangle themselves. Each other.
"You're a superhero," Tiberius said, even more desperate now. His gaze slid over to Steve. "You're both superheroes. That's what you do. You help people. You save people."
"I'm sorry," Steve said, as politely as he could. "I didn't catch any of that. Would you mind repeating what you just said?"
the one who's not any good at it, or because his standards are impossible to meet. And if you're not talking about what you're doing or what you like, it's very possible that no one's getting their needs met because no one is making it clear what they want. But none of that means you're bad at gay sex. In fact, I suspect you're very, very good at it. And I'm not just saying that to make you feel better."
"You've definitely been inspirational in a lot of ways," Tony said. There was an odd look on his face. He sighed. "It took me a few more years, actually, to figure out what everyone else had been seeing in me. Puberty had to hit, first. And that was when I realized that I wasn't solely into girls. So I was thirteen when I figured out that, um." There was more color in Tony's face now. "I realized I hadn't had all those Captain America posters because I was just that big a fan of liberty and patriotism, you know? So, yeah. Um. Big gay awakening. First crush. It was you. And I know I didn't know you, then. I know it wasn't real, not like this is real. It couldn't have been. But for me, it counts. You were first."
Oh. Another miscommunication. Iron Man thought he was asking for-- well. Steve puts all thoughts of that out of his mind. Iron Man's identity is obviously his own. Steve isn't going to pry.
Steve nodded, but the thing was, he still didn't look all right. He was the world's worst liar. "Fine, fine," he said. The words rattled out of him quickly, too quickly, and then stopped altogether. "I just-- I-- can I ask you a question?"
"Commander!" Tony says, pleasantly, in a tone that anyone might use to greet a good friend. A good friend with whom he is definitely not planning to do anything that they are actually planning to do. "Good morning. I'm glad to see you're so eager to get down to the day's business, but you'll have to forgive me. You're a little early, and I'm not quite ready yet."
hadn't braced, because her feet had left the ground. And because Carol was Carol, that meant she was
Steve holds up his hands before Iron Man can get too carried away. "Nothing like that! You were great out there, like always." The golden faceplate tilts, as if Iron Man is trying to modestly avoid well-deserved praise. "I meant more of a, um. A personal question."
"Sorry about the noise," Steve said, and then he emptied a clip into four different beekeepers, who lay groaning on the floor in agony.
Tiberius snorted. "It's cute that you think I'll even make it to trial. Are you really that naive? I'm the richest man in America. No one can touch me. Men like us don't go to prison, Tony." He smiled. "You know that. Don't be an idiot."
Tony had sprung awkwardly backwards, out of Steve's embrace, and he was propping himself up on the narrow bed with his shaking hands. But he was still upright. "Nothing," Tony said, and Steve didn't think he was making a face at Tony, but Tony grimaced. "Nothing major," he said, quickly. "Got stabbed in the neck with a tranquilizer five minutes after I got here. Pretty sure I smacked my head on a table on the way to the floor."
? He was so proper, so prim, so buttoned up. When the Avengers' chatter turned raunchy, he never joined in. He was innocent. He had to be innocent. Too innocent to know about any of this, anything remotely resembling kink. Wasn't he innocent?
Maybe this was going to be easy. Maybe they had their name written on the inside. It probably wasn't going to be that easy, but he could hope.
The low hum of the conversations around them were drifting away as the guests slowly began to realize that the stage at the other side of the room was now in use; Tiberius was standing in front of the still-closed curtain, microphone in hand, and the audience turned their rapt gaze upon him as if the hundreds of people in the room were one single person. He had their attention. It was amazingly good showmanship.
Steve tries to think this through. "So you're working for Mr. Stark... because you like working for him?"
There have been a few exceptions to the personal-knowledge and familiarity requirement, and they get famous, precisely because they are exceptional. They tend to come in the form of stalkers. Everybody still remembers the news stories of John Hinckley and Jodie Foster; he was spitting out carnations in his mug shot.
He rubbed at the back of Tony's hand while he thought of what to say, until Tony's grip on his fingers loosened just a little, until Tony's breathing evened out ever so slightly.
, right there. That was what Tiberius should have done. He hadn't. And Steve couldn't believe Tony was defending what Tiberius had done -- to him! -- as if Tony seriously thought it was acceptable behavior.
Less than a year ago, it was 1945 for Steve. He was in the middle of a war. And if there's one thing he's learned, it's that he shouldn't waste time. Life is fleeting. Happiness, more so.
The upside, the doctors say, after a few weeks of observation, is that it's not likely to kill him -- or at least not anytime soon. It's not progressing at anywhere near the rate of a typical case of Hanahaki disease. Barring any sudden acceleration, they tell his grateful parents, he may very well be able to live a normal life.
The shield surrounding him shrank in size, until it was an inch or so above his skin, and then it just sank in, like water absorbed by a sponge. Tony was just going to guess that that wasn't a good sign.
It was a charismatic smile. Steve didn't know why Tony had named a D&D attribute for him that wasn't Charisma, because this guy was dripping with it. He knew how to work the room, all right. He was lively, his body language was open, and he was leaning forward, still, just a little, making eye contact with Steve. Even though Steve was consciously aware of all the tricks -- he'd had to learn them himself back when the Army had decided that Captain America needed to be better at PR -- he still found that he couldn't quite look away. Stone was damn good at this. Steve supposed that you didn't become the richest man in America if you didn't know how to charm someone out of their money.
Steve's nebulous concern for Iron Man evaporates, replaced by sympathy for the man in front of him right now, with his inexplicable and mysterious condition. What in God's name has happened to Mr. Stark?
Unslinging his shield, Steve gave another diffident shrug. "Do you trust the Squadron Supreme to do anything right? Because I sure don't."
happens." Tony jerked his head at the TV. "Jesus. How the hell do they just so happen to have the exact footage that makes me look guilty?"
The newspaper's masthead looked familiar. Steve had seen the name in the news relatively recently. ViaLine had bought it a few months ago; the Daily Bugle had run several grumpy op-eds about journalism being beholden to corporations, which Steve remembered because he'd thought it was ironic coming from a newspaper that itself seemed to be beholden solely to J. Jonah Jameson's need to print libelous articles about Spider-Man.
Settling into his seat, Tiberius smiled at the host. "I couldn't just stand back and let the Avengers misrepresent the situation here, of course." His voice was silky-smooth, and he smiled at the camera now. He was playing to the camera, to the unseen audience. Of course he was. And he knew exactly how to do it.
Tony had been drinking. That was what Tony was trying to tell him about the timeframe. It was when he'd started drinking again. And maybe also why. Maybe that was what Tony meant.
He might not be able to hear Ghost's heartbeat, but that doesn't mean Ghost isn't audible. A baseline human wouldn't have been able to hear him, but Steve still can. Ghost's armor has obviously dampened his heartbeat, and it's just as obviously been designed to be as soundless as possible -- but he can't be completely silent.
But Tony's mouth went crooked. "Yeah, see, that's the thing. I can only tell myself that for so long. Ty
The Village now has a notably different character than it did in Steve's day. And it's not like he hasn't seen it since then, but the last time he had been here had been at night, when Iron Man had taken him to that movie, and he hadn't really had the chance to look around. But now he does, and -- wow. The two men walking in front of them are holding hands. Right here in public. And no one's even looking at them twice. The world's sure changed. It's amazing. Steve never even thought he could hope for this.
To underscore his point, he smacked Steve lightly on the ass with his free hand, and Steve's body convulsed around his fingers in shuddering pleasure as a surprised reply was jolted out of Steve's mouth. "Fuck," Steve said, obscenely and very precisely. "Please, sir, another."
Iron Man pauses. His eyes behind the mask are keen, intent, searching Steve's face. "Steve? You all right there?"
Flag Smasher actually got in a hit, weaving past the shield; Steve staggered backwards, clearly not up to his usual standards. If he got taken down by
Steve has one hand -- the gloved one -- across the small of Tony's back, holding him tight. His bare hand runs through Tony's hair, over the nape of his neck, across his cheekbones, like he can't seem to pick a spot and settle. Tony gasps in surprise when Steve's hand brushes his skin, because Steve is
Tony laughed; his eyes were bright. "Oh, you're a dangerous one. I'm going to have to hang onto you."
But now that Steve knew, it made an awful kind of sense. Tony had clearly always assumed he was unwanted. Unloved. He didn't know how to think otherwise. He'd picked the answer that meant that Steve didn't really want him.
Outside, the night was as quiet as it ever got in Brooklyn; it was probably coming up on four in the morning now. The streets were empty of people; even the cars were infrequent. There was an odd kind of serenity here, a calmness. Steve wondered if Tony felt it too. If maybe it was making Tony feel safer. He hoped so.
He is, however, unprepared. If he'd planned to do this, he would have had supplies. At least, a bottle of nice massage oil. Something scented. Or, hell, he'll take anything slick at this point; he knows his bare hands are too rough for this without it. And that's no fun for anyone. He bites his lip.
Tony sipped his tea again, shutting his eyes briefly as he swallowed. "Yeah," Tony said. His tone was very carefully neutral. "I'm getting that."
Tony started to smile even wider, almost dreamily, and then he cut himself off, glancing away. A mask. Tony hadn't done that to him in a while. Maybe years. "I'm doing all right," he said. The words were flat.
Steve smiles that smile again, focused, determined. "And what if I want everything you're wearing to be on the floor, hmm?"
Tiberius squinted dubiously. Steve didn't blame him for finding that a little hard to swallow. Most friends didn't just turn up unannounced at other friends' houses, letting themselves in to invite their friend out for a meal, after all. But that was just how he and Tony were.
Tony nudges Steve's hand onto the metal cuff, and he turns his arm over until Steve sees a nearly invisible switch on the inside edge of the cuff.
He wasn't going to let her bait him into that one. "If Iron Man is formally charged with a crime," he said, smoothly, "I'd be happy to turn the relevant records over to the proper authorities. But since he hasn't been, I can only conclude that the district attorney agrees with me. Iron Man is completely innocent."
Tony snorted. "Steve," he said, his mouth twisting into a lopsided smile, "I think you're going to be real disappointed when you find out the answer to that one."
Tony raises his head. He stands a little taller, turning to Ghost. It's ironic, really, that he would pick now of all times to pull himself together, when he's doing exactly the wrong thing. "Tell me what you need me to do," Tony says. It almost sounds like an order.
They'd just shown the video that was meant to serve as the introduction for the episode. It cut together years of footage of Tony and Iron Man, with a grim-voiced narrator solemnly listing what felt to Steve like every controversy Tony had ever been involved in in either of his identities. It wasn't doing wonders for Steve's mood. How could they keep doing this to Tony? Steve gritted his teeth, ran his finger around his collar, and hoped he hadn't dislodged his lapel mic.
But it doesn't look like the thought has occurred to Iron Man before. He stops, like he needs to recalibrate his expectations, and he tilts his head to the side. "You really mean that?"
"Yeah, well," Tony retorted, "I'm not her. I'm me. And I think I've made it pretty clear that I know what I'm getting into, too."
Hastily, he dropped Tony's hand, peeled off his gloves, tucked his gloves in his belt, and went to work on the IV. All the Avengers knew basic -- and slightly more than basic -- first-aid, and he'd done this a thousand times. Tony made a soft, bitten-off noise as Steve eased the needle out as cleanly as he could. Then Steve grabbed an adhesive bandage out of one of his belt pouches, without really looking at it. He stuck it over the puncture and gently smoothed it down. It probably wasn't all that necessary, since Tony was hardly bleeding, but fussing over Tony was somehow part of his muscle memory.
. All I knew was that there was something wrong with me and they all hated me for it." He sighed. "But that was also the day I met Ty. And he was my friend. My only friend, really. And I was-- I was just so happy that someone actually
. Yearning. For him. It was everything Steve felt, reflected. It was just for an instant, but it was there. It was real. Tony wanted him.
He pointed, and they could all see Tony now; he'd gotten past all the other people who'd been waiting to talk to Tiberius. Tony was smiling and clapping Tiberius on the shoulder. No doubt he was telling Tiberius all about his plan. They'd probably have some business deal worked out by the end of the evening.
A good few hours later, the gala was winding down; Steve's dining companions had left for the evening a while ago, as had the rest of the table he'd been seated at. The string quartet in the corner was still playing, but no one was dancing anymore. There were a few clusters of people here and there, still chatting. Tony was gladhanding the last of the millionaires, and a Daily Bugle photographer, looking dead on his feet, was still taking pictures.
God. She would have been right, if it had been about anything else. But she had no idea what this was like.
But Tony was still smiling. "Want to kiss you while you come," he murmured. His fingers encircled Steve's cock, the gentlest of pressure. His hands could be so delicate. He loved Tony's hands. It wasn't going to take long, the way Steve was worked-up tonight. "Besides, I believe someone here wanted to come all over my stomach."
Steve's uniform shifts, warps, changes into shimmering gold. A Phoenix Host. He's emblazoned in shining flames, crimson and gold. There's a bird insignia on his chest and another one on his cowl, in the middle of his forehead, where the A usually is. Objectively, he should look ridiculous.
, he doesn't say. "The Avengers pay me more than even I can spend, and I know they pay you the same salary that they pay me. It's in the bylaws. Mr. Stark is a generous man," he adds. "And since you're still working for him privately, you must need the money. So I'm just saying, I don't need everything I've got. I don't buy very much for myself. I have money saved. And I'm sure the Army must owe me some back pay." He frowns. "Probably a lot of back pay. I should check on that." He can't quite conceive of how much
, "but I think we'd better leave before the feds show up." He looked at the rest of Tony as if he was finally seeing the condition of his armor for the first time. "Can you walk?"
His worry must have shown on his face, because Tony took it for something else entirely. "Steve? Everything okay?"
The noise Walders made was huffing little laugh. "Well, Captain, you certainly don't waste any time. Or mince words."
"Aww, geez, Shellhead," Steve says, without really thinking about it. He just knows Tony's hurting and he wants to help. Tony's mouth, as always, quirks at the nickname. "That's rotten. But you're safe here, okay?" That's probably what Tony's stuck on, still. "It's just me here. And nothing's going to hurt you."
Tony kept fucking Steve with his fingers. He was loosening up fast, loose enough now for the plug, no problem. "Maybe next time I'll bring the armor.
His mind sketches out the scene. That must have been awful for Mr. Stark, if Iron Man came to him asking for help dating a man who'd rejected him. And just because Steve turned the fella down, that doesn't mean he wanted him to suffer for it. Heck, in a different world, in a world where Steve hadn't met Iron Man first, he'd have taken Mr. Stark up on his offer, because it isn't like the man isn't... compelling. He just isn't Iron Man.
The elevator beeps softly. Thirty-second floor. Ghost is one floor up, but they're getting out here and taking the emergency stairwell up. Steve checked the floor plans while they were waiting for the elevator. It'll be easier to get the drop on Ghost this way. Not guaranteed, by any means, but a chance is better than nothing; the stairwell is on the other side of the floor, but the elevator would have let them off right next to Ghost -- or, at least to where Ghost has blacked the cameras out. Ghost would see them for sure. So this is slower, but safer.
, and Steve would know. His skin shines in the soft light, with just enough oil rubbed into him to make him gleam even brighter. He's built sturdy; as odd as it is given the other one of Tony's day jobs, he's got the muscles of someone who works with his body for a living. The towel that's on his ass is pushed back just enough to be tantalizing.
Iron Man is silent for a while, and then he sighs. "I've never told anyone this." He pauses and amends himself. "Other than Mr. Stark, I suppose." He coughs and glances briefly away. "I-- I do have to wear the armor. But it's only the chestplate." He taps his chest with two fingers, and finally Steve hears metal. "A few years ago, I-- I-- I was in an accident, you might say. Shrapnel to the chest. The short version of the story is that I ended up with... a lot of damage. Permanent damage. The chestplate is what keeps my heart beating. That's what I meant when I said I had a heart condition. And that's why I can't remove the chestplate."
"You were there at the time," Steve pointed out. "I don't think you... noticed. So I guess my advantage was that I was already a little bit pissed at him, so that when more evidence came up I hadn't written him off."
Steve smiles sheepishly and replaces it with his other hand, and Tony squeezes most of the lube out onto Steve's bare palm, tossing the packet on the table in case Steve wants the rest later.
Tony waits. This is his penance. He sits and he waits, while the Sorcerer Supreme knits his probably-former best friend's mind back together.
. If you knew everything I know about him, you wouldn't want him anymore. You wouldn't love him anymore. I can promise you that. Believe me. There are good reasons not to marry him."
Steve hadn't thought about it like that, but that was why Tony was the genius. And now that Tony had said it, he had to agree -- that would be amazing. "You really think that's possible?"
Thinking about it like that would probably have made Tony feel unsafe. So he probably wasn't thinking about it like that.
Tony smiled. "I'd forgotten how damn stubborn you get when you get hurt," he murmured, as he turned back to the pan. Oddly, he still sounded fond when he said it.
It wouldn't do him any good. Tony wasn't going to change his mind about Tiberius, obviously, and there was nothing anyone could do about that. He'd tried. He and Tony had both made their choices. It was over.
On one hand, it would be strange if Tony wanted to kick him out of his own room. On the other, it would definitely not be the strangest thing that has happened to Steve in the past half hour alone.
Ghost hits shift and then three with two fingers. The pound sign. The octothorp, Steve supposes. "Anything else?" He sounds like he's scowling. He's annoyed. Just a little distracted. Good.
Tony runs his thumb over Steve's lips and Steve, desperate with humiliation, opens his mouth, chasing Tony's fingers, God, he just needs Tony to give him something, anything--
So he works his way up Tony's back, lightly, just enough right now to get the blood flowing, to let Tony's skin absorb the oil from his hands. He's not trying to actually work the soreness out of any of Tony's muscles out yet; that's for later. Tony makes inarticulate noises of happiness, muffled against his own hands.
The terrible voice inside his head suggested that it was just because he didn't like jerking off left-handed.
But right now, it just meant that Steve didn't have to hold back. He didn't have to pull his punches. He could just... fight.
"Oh," Steve says. There's something more tentative in the way he looks at him now, something soft and hopeful that he swears he's never seen in Steve's eyes. "I... live with you? We live together?"
Tony beamed down at him. He was taking him apart again, and he knew it. God, he was beautiful. "You like that, don't you?" Tony asked, clearly fishing for compliments, and absolutely, yes, Tony could have all the compliments he wanted.
Tony braced himself on his elbow, shifted his weight, and then promptly discovered how the hospital had known he was left-handed.
-- Steve had laid claim to it, to prevent Thor from opening it, that meant Tony had to step up. Take one for the team.
"Can I get you anything while you wait?" Tony asks, solicitously, chivvying him forward until he's about halfway into the place, just past the kitchen island.
