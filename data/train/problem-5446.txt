Dean presses his hand to his cheek and looks back at the hotel. It's stupid to think about Cas any longer. He can finally put tonight behind him and get some real work done. That's what he came to this godforsaken city to do. He sighs and starts walking around the corner instead. He spots Cas, sitting on the back of a bus bench. His heeled foot kicking the side. Dean stares at him and considers his options and realizes only one of them is truly appealing. "I thought you were getting a cab?" He says, appearing at Cas's side.
"Of course I have, weren't you paying attention to anything I was saying."
“Fuck,” Dean sighs, taking himself in hand. Castiel looks up at him, taking in his moans, the flush of his skin and the way his freckles and scars stand out against it, his tattoo dark. He’s so beautiful, and he’s gonna drive Castiel crazy with want before this is over. Patting Dean's hand away from his dick, Castiel places one last kiss over his mark, then moves on, taking just the tip of Dean's cock into his mouth. Dean moans, fighting to still his hips as Castiel sucks on his cockhead.
“... No.” Dean says unconvincingly. Rubbing his thumb over the brand.
“Shhh, do you want her to kill you.”
. Similar, to how Jack reached out and summoned me. The doorway he created was only connected to Lucifer. Lucifer was able to go through it because he already was on earth. As far as I know, the Empty has never been on earth, much less summoned to it."
Dean swallows, reluctantly taking a seat. “Why would it be necessary?”
Dean looks up from the contract, “No way am I giving an asshole like you my blood.”
--- L.A.X ---
Cas’s brows furrow and instinctively, he braces himself for the recognition to hit Cas - for the Squib comments to come. But Cas just nods and shakes Dean's hand. “You made the new Mars Rover, right?” he asks, curiously.
"Actually, Dean I have plenty of reasons to be a dick," Cas says coarsely. His voice always gets so rough when he's pissed. "I didn't ask for your help Dean. Nor did I ask for your apologies. But I’m dealing with it because you have been my friend for a long time.”
“Yeah sure,” Dean says, gripping the mug tighter. “I’ll ride with you if you want.”
"Why did you get the penthouse then?" He asks instead, leaning back into the chair to show off the goods.
“I’m not spoiled,” Castiel mutters darkly, grabbing his coat. Dean decides not to mention the 'expensive whisky', because it's too easy. Instead, Dean grins and ushers Castiel out the door. Ignoring the voice in the back of his head that says this is going to be it's a bad idea.
He walks to the door, Megs voice ringing in his ears. He can still see her sitting outside the dressing room while he tried to find the right look.
next."
“I’m just gonna let Dean out of his cell,” Jody says, turning the key on the lock. “You sure your okay to drive?”
Dean pulls back, teeth nipping at Castiel's jaw. “You don't do subtle, do you, Cas?”
Dean can work with that.
“Ouch.”
From inside comes a growl.
"Okay," Cas says pulling back only for Dean to reach out and kiss him again. Already addicted to how Cas tastes.
“I know. I know, I’ll try not to be a dick.”
"Stopped him?" Dean asks, eyes wide. "C'mon Cas, this is God. None of us had a chance in hell of stopping him. If it wasn't for Jacks honesty gambit. I doubt we would have ever learnt that Chuck was something that needed to be stopped. And that was all because Jack was a good kid who was tired of lies.” As predicted Cas flinches the second Dean says Jacks name. Dean closes his eyes and sighs. "I wish I could have apologised to him."
“Well names Dean Winchester, I was born in January 79’ not December and I’m from Kansas, not New York.”
“So, what does make them successful?” Dean asks trying to understand.
"Good boy," Castiel says, rubbing the dogs enormous head as it presses up against Castiel’s legs. Somehow Castiel doesn't fall over.
Cas hold there joined hands in his lap, stroking over Dean's fingers with his thumb. ”So what do you want to do now?”
"But why?"
Cas snorts, "I'm not sure what that is anymore. I still need time to figure that part out." He bites his lip, almost looking apologetic. "You should come inside before we go to town, I've almost mastered how to make lunch."
"No - ah about dating a guy," Dean says, braving a glance at Cas's face.
"Dean... it's Cas… he's missing." Charlie says and suddenly Dean's more awake than he's been in years.
"Says the guy who makes a business as a psychic."
“No, I’ve been a little busy,” Castiel says, tilting his head towards the pile of salt on the floor. He’s really gonna have to clean that up. “What would happen if I did anyway?”
Dean sighs and lets his exhaustion pull him under.
Dean rolls his eyes. "You spoil them." He says, hooking the last pot through his fingers and climbing the ladder.
“No more!” Bela roars, jerking in the chair. Sweat dripping down her face, she closes her eyes turning the image to black. Dean's hands are shaking. Rowena looks stony-faced but there are tears in her eyes. Sams's fists are clenched with rage, his copper grace a burning light. Out of all of them, Gabriel remains the most unaffected. A golden statue compared to Bela's pain.
Castiel scoffs just as Zeke slaps Meg's hand away from the fruit. "This ain't a buffet, Meg," He says, ignoring her as she flips him off.
“It's customary for the boyfriend to meet the family.”
under his breath that’s his own business.
“No Bela’s still got her soul,' Dean says when suddenly an awful thought occurs to him. "Although we don't know if her father keels over if it's going to change that situation.”
So optimistic he grabbed the KY gel from his medical supply. So sue him, Dean would much rather fuck Krushnic into defecting than pull his fingernails off.
He never actually learned to drive any of his dad’s old beauties. That was always Jo's thing. But he's not going to tell Crowley that. He'll take the keys back without question and Dean needs to get out of here. He's already looking like he's going to blow a gasket thanks to that quip. Dean gets into the driver’s seat before Crowley changes his mind.
"I -Ugh" Dean fumbles, before pointing at Cas's nose. "You told me you don't do subtle."
“And if that’s true - Why the hell do you think I would help you?!” Castiel asks, temper blazing.
He knew with Claire's abilities that the Severing would be awful. Because everything magical uses her fucking soul to boost itself. He just forgot how intense the Severing can be. The spell is always effective, but Dean can't even feel a trace of Claire’s soul in his grace. Not even the phantom tug he's used to feeling for weeks after he lets a charge go. Somehow it makes everything worse.
Dean picks
"I mean I'll probably veto a few of them," Dean says, trying to force a laugh that sounds more like he got punched in the gut.
The rain continues throughout the day, bouncing pleasantly off the window while Castiel sketches behind the counter. It's not the frantic trance-like state from earlier, but it's far from the pleasant numbness he usually achieves when doodling. Instead, it's a feeling of uneasiness, like a finger tracing down his neck. Running his tongue over his piercing, he starts to shade in the ancient looking tablet. Oddly enough, it reminds him of old bible stories. Except, it's blank — more a smooth rock than a set of commandments, yet the phrase
Dean shakes his head. “Demon thing, keeps them from possessing you.”
"Yeah, whatever Sammy," Dean groans, knowing Sam is going to tease him for the rest of his existence. "Keep me updated about the Eileen thing."
Dean sighs, "A couple of weeks, I'll come up here and get you and I'll be with you when the spells performed. After that, we'll see what happens. Hopefully, we'll get you out of here."
“You're wanted in a lot of states aren’t you?” Castiel asks, horrified.
Daphne nods, slipping behind the beads and picking up the little red umbrella. She doesn't look back as she leaves, head and umbrella held high. Somehow Castiel thinks she'll be fine.
Charlie, he knows, understands all of this. Yet for some reason, she’s always refused to take part in the demon bashing half the office does.
Dean swallows, feeling Raphael's eyes boring into his skin. "Jacks an inquisitive kid, he likes to ask questions and do puzzles. From what I've seen this is behaviour is praised by Kelly. He’s grown to be a friendly young boy who's clearly intelligent. He's happy with his mother. He is comfortable enough to hold her hand and strike up conversations with her whenever he wants. He's also well clothed and well-fed. Despite the family financials, Jack is obviously provided for. It’s obvious to me that Jack is Kelly’s main priority."
Castiel shrugs, its none of his business why Dean’s lonely enough to take his insane price tag. He’s his hook-up, not his therapist. “Well then, I guess that means we're getting comfortable." Castiel puts down his champagne and unzips his boots.
"How long will it take?" She asks as she signs her name.
“Anything huh?” Dean drawls, then immediately want's to smack himself. He promised himself this was going to be a casual thin. Not an opportunity to flirt with the guy who currently kind of owns him.
“If you want,” Castiel mutters fighting a smile. He knows most of his colleagues would probably find Dean infuriating, but there's something about Dean that Castiel finds charming instead. It's something he's gonna have to tap down unless he wants to find himself on official probation. He's already on Jody's bad side. Flirting with a prisoner will only make it worse.
Castiel nods pacing until he blocks Nicks cold gaze from Deans view. Dean doesn't even know how Castiel knew that was bugging him. "Is it's fair to say, Mr Winchester, that you have a lot of experience ensuring children are in the best possible care?"
“I know.”
Dean shrugs, staring at the dark circles under Castiel’s eyes. "I left a note." He says, a hint of this morning’s anger seeping into the dig. He really wishes Castiel would look at him.
Charlie sighs, her smile fading. "Look I'm really sorry I called you all the way out here Dean. I mean he's only been gone a week, but this isn't like him. I hoped he was with you, I mean your Cas's oldest friend." Dean raises his eyebrow at the title making Charlie giggle. "Although friends might be stretching it a tiny bit. I mean I live here, and Cas tries, but not everything's soundproofed."
Dean leads Kelly back to her son where she immediately kneels to tie his shoe. Dean opens the bottle cap passing it to Jack who's all smiles as usual. Castiel gives them both a questioning look. "What happened?"
He is in such a rush to leave, he almost doesn't notice when he bumps into someone. Smiling apologetically Dean turns and sees Jamie. Because, of course, he needed to meet his ex-girlfriend to really rub salt in the wound. "Jamie, hey," Dean says, trying to hide his insecurities with a smile.
Castiel’s cheeks hurt from smiling he sits beside Dean and throws his arms around Dean's shoulder. "You do nice things for me all the time dumbass." He whispers, kissing Dean's cheek. "It’s not a competition Dean."
Shock flickers over Dean's face quick as a flash before he covers it up by breathing a laugh. “Kids doing better than okay, he’s got a kick-ass girlfriend, Sarah, and is well on his way to a community college degree.”
Cas glances at them, then at Dean with a glint in his eye. "Oh, look hon, my shoelace has come undone." He says, then lifts his leg placing it a trash can. Slowly he bends over, folding himself in half to look at his shoe. Fuck, Dean can see his muscles rippling under his shirt. The angel wings shift, and Dean follows the feathers down to his ass. Which yes. That's definitely worth a hundred dollars an hour. Possibly more. Dean swallows, his throat dry.
“Too much,” Crowley says as Dean drives away.
Dean flushes when the dirty implications of what he just said, hit him like a smack to the face. "I - ah didn't mean - God - get your mind out of the gutter dude."
Kelly bites her lip, pulling out a chewed pencil from her bag. "Here you go honey," She says handing it to her son. "Why don't you try solving one while we're waiting for the food."
"It's a bit snug," Castiel comments suddenly, clearly deciding if his dicks out he might as well not be embarrassed about it. And really who could be embarrassed with that thing between their legs? Dean may or may not be having a stroke.
“Most deals are these days in case you haven't noticed," Dean says face hot with rage. "So, yeah forgive me for not trusting you. But I need to see Claire's contract.”
The crowd cheers and catcalls, some girls scream, making Dean smile. "I’m happy to see you too," he says. He's got fucking dimples. Castiel almost spills the mojito he's been mixing.
"I have faith in you two," Sam says, getting out and closing the door before Dean can argue with him.
Dean waves her off, “Yeah well, take better care of yourself, and maybe, I'll stop bothering you.”
“So does that mean I can get out now?” Dean asks bouncing on the balls of his feet.
"So, Mr Winchester what would be your professional recommendation be for a case like this?"
going to get them messy no matter what. Unless your telling me what
The walk back doesn't take too long, Cerberus is tugging him harder than usual. Eager to get back to his owner and a bowl of food after dealing with Gabe all afternoon. When Dean opens the door to Castiel’s place he bolts inside. Tail wagging as he walks down the hallway. Dean follows, plopping down on the sofa beside Castiel who’s nursing a glass of whisky.
Dean stands from the office chair and fixes his tie. He's about to make the biggest deal of his career. He can’t afford to get depressed about his love life.
"Shh, I'm trying to watch the movie!" Charlie says, not denying a damn thing.
Cas groans, his mind clearly on the same thing as he blankets Dean on the bed. There cocks sliding against each other as he kisses Dean hot and heavy. Dean gasps when he pulls back, his chest panting as Cas kisses down his throat to his nipple. Using just enough teeth that Dean can't help himself from grinding against Cas's hip. He’s so turned on he can barely breathe. He's usually smoother than this, less desperate, but Cas does things to him that no one else does. Gripping his dark hair in his hands, Dean pulls Cas up stroking a thumb behind Cas’s ear before kissing him desperately. "C'mon Cas get me ready." He half begs arching up against Cas’s cock. He needs Cas in him soon before he blows his load.
"Dean, you look like you’re about to faceplant on the steering wheel, did you get any sleep last night? Or did you rush the whole way over here just to see me?"
"Something like that," Dean breathes out a laugh, thinking of Crowley's face when he took off. "It's my friend's car, I'm borrowing her, but I doubt she's ever had a tune-up in her life." He lifts one of his hands off the wheels to scratch his neck. "Or it's been way too long since I've handled a stick shift."
hooker, his stocks would plummet. But Dean still can't help himself from thinking about the guy's mouth.
Remarkably Cas laughs, "No you’re not. Although I realise now that manipulative might be a better word than absent. If I knew Chuck was like this. If I knew what he was, maybe I could have -"
"Not as much shit as she's going to give you for cursing in front of little ears," the girl says, gripping Owens little shoulders.
Dean bolts. He suddenly needs to get away from everything. It's too much. Dean's not even sure it's even real. Maybe he caught Covid and this is all some sorta fever dream. That would make a lot more sense than some dickless dude showing up and claiming to be a God. He shoves past Castiel, getting into the car and slamming the door.
Deans about to ask when the spot beside Sam flashes, Eileen ghost appearing from the veil. Cas steps forward to fight only too stop when Dean grabs his shoulder. "It’s okay Cas, it’s just Eileen."
Dean shrugs, he’s not ready to settle just yet, but he doesn’t want to be hunting for the rest of his life either. He just needs a new start. “Have you ever been to Mexico?”
If you asked Sam, Sarah Blake is a miracle made woman. She was the first girl that made him hope for love after Jess, and she was the one Sam called, stupidly and desperately, after all the shit in Cold Oak. Dean has a very different opinion of Sarah, and that is that she is a menace. He loves her for what she’s done for Sam and the fact that she's frankly hilarious, but goddamn does that girl meddle.
Dean smiles thankfully, checking the drawer and wiping his stomach. Castiel lies down beside him. his eyes heavy. Dean, now clean, thumps his head down on Castiel's chest, sighing contentedly. “I didn't peg you for a cuddler,” Castiel says, smiling softly as he wraps his arms around Dean back, feeling more than seeing it when Dean shrugs.
It caused a strain on their relationship in the beginning. But then Dean had started to come and sit at the end of Castiel’s shifts when he had the time. It meant they got to see each other, even if it was with a bar in-between them. It was on a night like this where they eventually brought up the idea of moving in together.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Sam already warned me about that.”
" into the mic and the crowd goes wild.
"Okay," Cas says, biting his lip. Like Dean, he's wearing a homemade hat in green instead of red. He looks like a dork with it on. Dean tries everything not to stare at him like some lovesick fool.
“You're very strong. I’m blocking you out, and you can still see right through me.” Dean says, staring at Castiel curiously. “You shouldn't be able to sense that at all.”
"Tetanus," Dean says swiftly. He doesn’t want to fight Cas but he sure as hell isn't letting him get sick. "I got some new tools and this ladder isn't so bad, but I don't think you should come up there with me until I remove the nails. I don't know how rusted they are going to be."
So instead Dean reaches between his legs playing with Castiel’s rim. He whines trying to push down onto Dean's hand. Chuckling Dean runs his other hand over Castiel’s hip, cupping his back as he pushes his first finger inside. Castiel groans a dark smile on his face. "You're the worst kind of tease," He says as Dean pushes another finger in.
Castiel shrugs handing over a silver fountain pen, marked in Demonic. “You'll need to prick yourself with the nub first.”
The kittens scurry under the couch as the light show continues. Each flash lasts longer than the last. A low ringing begins to fill the air, the pitch getting higher and higher as the seconds go by. Above him the lights flicker on again, the bulbs shining far beyond their actual capacity. Dean closes his eyes, his teeth aching, the ringings so loud.
“Good,” Cas says, smiling again. “What are your plans for today, then?”
"No reason,” Dean sighs. Of course, even his fucking happy place is going to be tainted by this arrangement. Deans never going to be able to come here again. Not when the last time he was here, a demon forced him through the doors. "I guess I'll follow your lead.”
"I testified because you don't deserve that kid, asshole," Dean says, grabbing Nicks lapel. A hand reaches out and grabs his shoulder.
Sparks rain down over Dean’s head as the light bulbs short out and shatter. The TV clicks off with a snap and the windows explode inward, covering Dean in broken glass. The silence after that feels deafening. Almost as if the wind is holding its breath waiting to see what happens next.
“Wow. So what God did this on purpose and then you came to me for help. Really?” Dean nods seriously. “Yeah, well, I didn’t agree to that. I’d like you to leave now.”
"It's possible I wasn't thinking straight. I did drink a whole bottle of whiskey before coming up with my master plan."
The Tweaker sighs, looking offended by the question. "I'm telling you, man. I don't know. I don't even know who she hangs with."
"What marathon?" Dean asks, giving Castiel a quick once over. "Is that why you're going running in December."
“Ugh...”
Deans hands start to tingle where they touch the stand. Castiel meets his gaze and nods slightly. It's as close to reassurance Castile can give when they are under this much scrutiny, Dean swallows, "I do."
"Yes..." Dean says, shrugging. “Look I think you're right about the world needing Jack back."
"The P stands for reverse right?" Dean jokes, smirking a little.
Dean blinks, “You think I’m handsome?” He asks, earnest not coy.
Claire smiles sheepishly. "Yeah buddy I did, but only because Uncle Castiel here said it first."
"Dean, Cas you almost ready to go?" Sam yells, with just enough bitterness in his voice that he clearly worked out what they've been doing.
"I love you, Dean," Cas wraps his arms around Deans neck. "You make me so happy. More than you will ever know." Cas says kissing him again.
Castiel shrugs. “Not particularly.”
"You know about those?" Dean says thinking back to that old cartoon Sam used to love. Somehow Dean doesn't think it's anything like Covid.
Dean sighs and taps his fingers against his stomach. “Ghosts.”
Dean sighs, “My ex-wife Lisa... is now in Santa Barbara... in my ex-home...with my ex-dog and her new husband.” Dean picks the leaves of his strawberry, avoiding Castiel’s gaze. “And my ex-girlfriend, Lydia, is in San Francisco...moving out of my apartment as we speak.”
Hey, all I am so fucking sorry this took so long.
against Cas’s stubbled throat. His lips tingling with the burn.
Dean grabs his hand, holding it steadily against his chin and stroking his fingers over the back. “Cas I’m fine.”
Castiel shrugs, “Well I thought being blunt would clear up some of your awkwardness.”
“Yes. Stop being an asshole.”
Breaking into the museum is almost too easy.
Dean shakes his head, relieved. "You're such a dork, man."
!) jerky halt. Fuck this guy is making Dean nervous.
The thought of being caged into the booth by Castiel turns his stomach but he can't cause a scene. Not with the kid here. Sighing Dean sits down, allowing Castiel to press in beside him. Across the table Jack opens his book, flipping through the pages. It reeks of ink and it's filled with dozens of crossword puzzles.
Dean shrugs, "I just assumed you misheard his name on his first week and it stuck." Deans says, then blinks in Castiel’s directions. "Wait a second Cas. You love Christmas movies?"
“Yeah, despite the attempted murder it still falls under magic misuse. And since he’s the lead detective in that unit it’s his.”
Dean doesn't know why he feels so disappointed. He thought vindication would feel better. He's been defending himself to Charlie for years, for crying out loud. But he just feels empty. Last night Castiel had been helpful, kind even. Dean hates how easily he fell for the gentle facade. Any man who can cast a compulsion has no right to judge anyone casting a soul deal. Castiel is a hypocrite as well as a manipulator. And Dean is the idiot who got excited about making him breakfast. He was stupid enough to think Castiel could have become a friend. When really, all the demon has done is prove that Dean is one step away from his slave.
Castiel laughs, “My great grandfather started it as a joke. He liked the mortals stories about demons actually being fallen angels. So he named his children after angels to mock that ideology.”
"Cas!" Dean yelps, looking around to see if anyone heard him.
"No. I borrowed his likeness from that image over there." Castiel tilts his head to the left, and Dean follows his gaze. He can't make out much in the dark, but Dean knows about 10 miles down the road is the
“Your best friend, the one hanging out with your kid. He's the kind of dick that compels people to do his bidding. That's the only reason I’m here. If my boss ever found out I made a deal I’d lose my job Kelly and Castiel - ” Dean sighs, Kelly is watching him with wide eyes. Hanging onto his every word as Dean glows. His grace singing beneath his skin. “Castiel knows all of that and he forced me to come anyway. I may hate demons but shit like this is why.”
Bela blinks again.
Cas glares at him for the gesture, pulling at his hat till it covers his ears. Dean looks away and cracks open the caulking compound. "We need to put this between the gaps. It'll stop water from getting in."
"I have work to do, Crowley," Dean says, avoiding Crowley's eye. "Can please borrow one of your cars and go to the hotel? Benny's trapped until tomorrow by the looks of things."
trunk to grab two shovels. The movement causes his shirt to slip up a little revealing the smooth skin at the dip of Dean's back. Castiel licks his lips and looks at a steadily growing puddle instead. “ - it was a pretty big case.” He finishes, face red.
Dean pants gripping onto Castiel’s horn. “Pull tighter,” Castiel groans kissing along Dean's jaw.
"He’s my son too," Nick says, his voice just as smarmy as the rest of him. “Kelly, you have no idea what kind of power he has, you couldn't control it if you tried."
"Bye Sammy," Dean says, ending the call and biting his lip. Cas climbs out of his truck smiling at Dean and stupidly his heart flutters. He gets out of the impala, shaking his head at how ridiculous Cas looks in his old trench coat and knitted hat.
From one look Dean can see Kelly is mortal and guarded against him. Like she's waiting for him to judge her, but Dean can't. His father was mortal. And his foster family were far from angelic. Deans got nothing against a mortal woman raising an angelic kid. In any other case, Jack being raised by a human would barely be a blip. He doesn't know how to explain it to her that it's just different with Archangels.
Cas ducks his head and chuckles. "My office, I like that." He puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs, "But yeah I'll get back there eventually. I’m more surprised we both got here in one piece. You're driving had me worried there for a second."
Dean shakes his head and laughs. "God do you have like a joke book written up or something?"
“Let me guess, that ring was his seal?”
Cas sighs, tilting his head to kiss Dean again, "I think I'd prefer the term cautious," He says against Dean's mouth. "Less dumb, less ass."
Still, for all his weirdness, something about Cas was charming. Dean had spent a week in his company before getting on a boat to America with Sam and Ruby. His legs still shaky and the taste of Cas's kiss on his tongue. From then on they kept in touch. Dean didn't have an address for months after he moved, but Cas didn't need one. His letters always found Dean. Over the years, Dean has collected a variety of stamps from all over the world. Along with lengthy letters in Cas's cursive.
The minute they make contact, Castiel truly sees her. Watches mesmerized as the green of her eyes melts into pink smoke and green water. Daphne's soul is pretty, like most are, pretty and boring. Circular shaped and small enough to fit in the palm of his hand. With practised ease Castiel examines it, looking past the surface level informations like her name and age. He caught that already when she walked in. Instead, he focuses on the waves of feelings that wash over him, her apprehension at what she's doing here, her disgust for being in this part of town, the brief pulse of attraction she feels when looking at him. Castiel ignores it all digging deeper and deeper until he sees the root of her problem, an ugly pulsing bulge of rage and suspicion and betrayal.
Cas is standing at a makeshift altar. His eyes glowing an angelic blue. In his hand, the same blue light burns, lighting up a dark sigil on his chest. He's chanting something from an old book. The pages, whipping back and forth before they catch. The corners going up in smoke. From behind Cas's back, black tentacles start to climb up the walls. Writhing limbs that seem to arch into a doorway.
Cas, of course, raises an eyebrow at the request but keeps his mouth shut. Dean imagines he's not used to this kind of treatment. Dean doesn't usually dole it out either, but he's in the mood to pretend. Just for a night. That he isn’t the corporate robot but the romantic he keeps buried beneath it.
“It compelled me to do it!”
"Is it?" Castiel asks, eyebrows raised.
Dean feels like he's going to throw up. Out of every reckless thing Claire has done over the years, none of them could have prepared him for this. He never thought she’d be this stupid. He can feel his grace rebel at the very idea of it. A demonic seal on his kid's arm. This doesn't even make sense. Claire has nothing valuable to offer a demon, she's broke for crying out loud. The only things she has worth offering are her soul or her abilities. Dean doesn't know which options worse.
Dean glares at Cas resisting the urge to start pacing. "Cas what the fuck was that thing?"
"Well, you should ask Mr Lightbringer that yourself when he's on the stand Castiel. Instead of badgering this witness." Crowley snaps his face red. Dean barely stops from snorting when Castiel raises an eyebrow at his rival.
The creature is painted gold, sitting tall and proud on a cheap rug, emerald green eyes surveying Cas through the easel. They match its wings, huge sprawling things that hit the ceiling. Greener than anything he owns, he must have mixed the paints to get the colour. He now knows that  once it’s dried he’ll be able the feel the hardened ridges of the feathers. Suddenly the oil paint makes perfect sense. His fingers itch to touch them, now. Tackiness be damned.
"Turn over," Castiel practically growls, teeth tracing over Deans nipples.
Sam smiles walking backward to the kitchen. Dean shakes his head, the kids almost as awkward as Dean is. Turning on his heel Dean enters the living room, planning to give this Castiel guy a simple wave before trying to calm down in his room. Except when he enters the living room, he ends up freezing in his place.
Cas swallows, his Adam's apple bobbing against Dean's lips. His hands tightening on Dean's shoulder. "You." He breathes out, soft and aching with want. "Fuck Dean I've wanted you for so long."
Her smile is even more disconcerting when it's genuine, “Whatever you say, Mr G.”
The roof does look pretty good now that Deans nearly finished. Almost all the old shingles have been replaced, the rot treated, and weeds removed. If it wasn't for the discolouration between the original structure and the new pieces. Dean would think the whole thing was brand new.
Castiel pulls up to the station fifteen minutes later. Dean's stomach in knots after the speed he drove. “I'm never getting in a car with you ever again,” He grouches head bent over his knees.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever you say, Deputy. You gonna throw me in jail for giving your house some protection?”
"Um," He flushes looking around the crowd. Just like in those godamn Disney movies Dean loves, Castiel meets Deans gaze through the crowd. Dean flushes and looks away, "This is not what I was expecting but I think we can make it work, right guys?" Dean passes the note back. Sam nodding after a booming laugh.
“No!” Castiel says defensively. “I just finished at the academy and it was - um -” Distracted, Castiel swallows down his sentence as Dean reaches into the back of the
Dean raises an eyebrow, "Why the hell did you think that?" Dean asks because if Cas asked, Dean would have been here in a heartbeat.
Castiel tries to reach for the bag just as the ghost reaches for his neck. “Get off him, you bastard!” Dean yells, banging against the cell. The ghost turns grip tightening on Castiel's throat. Roaring over its shoulder at Dean. Reaching blindly, Castiel grasp for the bag. His fingers barely catching the strap. He tugs hard and the duffle falls. His vision darkens as the bag hits the ground, salt spilling over the ghost's feet. When it hits, the ghost screams and turns to smoke.
"Dammit!" Dean yells, his wings snapping out. Castiel jumps back to avoid the raindrops Dean shakes off.
Sam blinks
Dean shrugs, his wings ruffling under the praise. “There’s no thanks necessary. I should have agreed to do this weeks ago, saved you a few sleepless nights.”
"You did what?" Dean swallows, his heart pounding.
Baffled, Castiel stares at the mess and tries to think beyond the influence of the painting. He probably went to the bathroom at some point too, but he can’t remember doing anything other than painting for days now. Shrugging at the mess, Castiel starts to roll his shoulders. Releasing what feels like years of pent-up tension along his spine before finally dropping his brush into the green stained jar of turps. In what feels like eons, he finally breathes. Dragging his feet, Castiel walks the 10ft chasm between his easel and bed. Falling face first into the messy nest of blankets. For once, he doesn’t dream.
"Oh, baby you have no idea," Dean says, kissing Castiel’s neck and reaches his tail. Wrapping his fist around it Dean tugs harshly shoving Castiel down deeper onto his hand. Castiel yells, "Holy Hell Dean!"
Claire groans, “No Dean! Everybody else gets to have a normal life. They get to sleep beside their girlfriends and use magic to charge their phones.”
Crowley shakes his head, looking no less alarmed when Dean reeves the engine. He thinks he gets why Crowley loves this car so much. "Yeah, sure Dean, do me a favor and don't get lost. You’re not built for the wild streets of Los Angeles at night."
“Who told you that?” Dean asks, though he can already guess.
"Of course, you can, it's your money. You can do whatever you like." Cas says and just like that Dean remembers this isn't a fucking date, it's a transaction. He almost pulls his arm back, but then that would make things awkward. If Dean only has Cas for an hour, he wants to enjoy it. Fuck, why does this have to be so complicated?
"And how many Archangels have you personally trained at your school, doctor?" Crowley asks. His voice almost hypnotic, Dean wings ruffle nervously against the bench.
"No, he won't Bela. I'll make sure the cops understand who your father really is Bela. My brother Sam is a detective and he's working on it right now. Hell if you tell me who you're deal is with. Sam will be sure he's locked away too."
"Then why do you think so many of your pupils pull out of your school the second they can be emancipated?" Castiel asks, pulling a sheet of paper out of his briefcase.
“You have work today?” Dean asks when they part.
“Thanks, man,” he says in a thick Irish accent.
“Because they were cliches,” Castiel says with a humourless laugh, taking another drink. “Found me kissing some boy, got mad because of religion. I got mad because I didn't see the problem. They decided I was wrong, and if I didn't fix my ways I wouldn't be welcome in their home. So I packed my shit and got on a Greyhound to South Dakota to go visit my excommunicated aunt with the hopes that she’d understand. Been here ever since.”
"Oh," Dean says, looking like he's not sure whether he should be offended or not.
“Hey Sammy,” He says the moment the ringing stops.
Jumping over his balcony railing Dean soars. The rising sun glowing through his feathers. He doesn't reach the usual zen-like space he usually falls into when flying to the office. Not when he's got the directions to Castiel’s house playing through his earpiece. But he stops panicking, which is something.
cleaned the sheets."
Biting down on his pen Dean circles a quote from one of Jacks teachers, a woman named Donna. She has a good testimony and works with angels specifically. Her testimony could be good for this case. Maybe not as good as Deans would have been, but Deans working with what they've got.
"No," Cas bites back, finally looking up at Dean. "You do not get to judge me, Dean Winchester. Not after everything you've ever done for Sam."
"Well I've been trying to get your attention," Cas says, despite his peacocking, he looks almost... shy.
From the corner of the room Rowena beings to chant, Sam watching her every move. Dean bites his lip, there's something about this mans voice that sends shivers down his spine. It almost sounds familiar. Gabriel doesn’t look away from the screen.
Dean blinks, “Who taught you grand theft auto?" He asks in surprise.
Instead, Dean pulls of Castiels shoes and nudges between his legs. Castiels eyes are burning red hot as he focuses on Deans mouth. Dean starts kissing on his thick thighs smiling when. Castiel’s breath quickens. He reaches to grab Dean's shoulder, dragging him up for another brain-melting kiss. His thumb strokes over Dean's shoulder and catching on the cloaking charm.
“I do you’re Grace,” Castiel says rising to his feet gracefully. His tail swaying like he doesn’t have a care in the world. “Doctor Sharp would you say that the pupils you’ve trained are happy?”
Naomi stutters on the stand, staring at Castiel in shock. "Objection!" Crowley bellows, "Mister Gladius is assuming facts, not in evidence!"
“Hey, Castiel,” Dean says looking anywhere but at the demons collarbones. His angelic name feels more awkward than usual in Dean’s suddenly dry mouth.
“It's not just because of spite Cas. You're mad at me.”
Toes curling in the sheets Dean rolls his hips down, taking Cas in and panting at the feeling of Cas inside him. Cas makes an awestruck sound, slowly starting to find a rhythm as sweat builds on his brow. He starts to move, filling Dean deeply and panting hotly against Dean's ear.  Dean grabs at his shoulder, his thigh winding around Cas's ass as he presses Dean into the mattress. "Fuck -Cas- Just like that." Dean pants, his whole body flushed.
not going to argue with my plan are you?" Cas asks, almost awed. Dean hates the fact he's dashed Cas's hope so often. He never wants to do it again.
Dean snorts, just as Pumpkin bumps against his heels. Proving Cas right. The little shit is clingy. When Deans not there to entertain her, she sleeps inside his duffle bag. "Yeah, I know," Dean says his voice catching. It's stupid but he's suddenly terrified to leave the cabin in case he never comes back. Dean doesn't want to lose Cas and the life they have just started to build together. He clears his throat, "Hey Sam’s how's the snow situation."
The road was the only constant in his life, and now it’s gone.
Cas doesn’t comment, he just nods and kisses him again. He sits up on his knees and lifts Dean’s legs so they grip his hips. He grabs the lube bottle, slicking up his dick and lines it up with Dean’s hole. “Fuck,” Dean groans, grabbing Cas’s forearm, throwing his head back as Cas pushes in and in and in.
Dean shrugs innocently, “Sometimes.” Castiel sighs in despair, forgetting firing him for flirting. If Jody found out who he was helping he’d be lucky not to end up in a cell himself.
"Cas -"
Climbing up the ladder, it shakes a little until Cas springs into action. Muttering in Enochian as he holds on tight to the bottom steps. Looking down Dean’s treated to a speculator glare. He winks and climbs onto the roof, edging his way towards the tarp. Peeling it back Dean hides a wince.
The band returns more energetic than ever, the cute blonde drummer coming down to pick up the bowl. "Okay let’s see what we got here," Dean says, grinning into the mic. He chuckles reading the selection, "Oh Jo you're going to love this one," The band crowds in as Dean passes the sheet between the four of them and the blonde girl - presumably Jo - fist pumps the air. Dean picks up the bass and they start playing
Dean chokes, and Krissy passes him a cup of steaming coffee just in time. Sam, the asshole, laughs and eats some pancake. “Enjoy your meals, fellas,” she says, flouncing away incredibly pleased with herself. Dean rolls his eyes and kicks Sam under the table.
It's only then that Castiel pulls back, breathing heavily over Dean's stomach. Dean looks down at him, dazed, and reaches down to pull Castiel up by his shoulder. Kissing the taste of himself out of Castiel's mouth. “What do you want?” Dean asks, nipping at his jaw. His hand moving down between Castiel's legs.
Cas shakes his head. "Partially. But I have faith in us Dean. Far more faith than I've ever had in what Chuck has to say."
"But since you were so eager to see me that you broke the speed limit, I figure I can give you the key to my place.” Dean can feel the heat of Cas's glare even through the aviators, it makes him want to squirm. Cas was already hot in his uniform, without adding those things into the equation.
"No," Dean says immediately, his hands tightening around Cas's grace.
Dean blinks. “Did you just use finger quotes.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Just because your charming and I saw ghost doesn't mean I can just let you go, I like my job, Dean.”
Dean smiles, softening Castiel’s expression by stroking his arm. "I'll cook dinner tonight at my place. That paella thing you like. All you have to do is show up."
However, when he unlocks the cell door, he realises that getting fucked by the Russian could also have its appeal.
“Dean…”
"Can you blame me, Sam? After everything you said on that vamp case, Aren't I allowed to worry about you?" Dean asks, avoiding Sam's eyes. He's known since he was a kid that Sam could see through his bullshit. This isn’t even the first time, he's called Dean out on it like this. But it still surprises him every damn time.
"Will Doctor Naomi Sharp please take the stand," Crowley says stepping out from behind his desk. The angel that walks to the stand has steel coloured wings almost as large as Dean’s. Her dark red hair wound in a severe bun. She swears in, hands glowing as they are linked to the stand. Dean can’t help but swallow down his fear. Meg has coached him well, but Dean knows if he messes up and tells a lie his hands will catch fire.
Dean slides up beside him, still playing the part of the penitent convict till they leave the building. Castiel walks over to his squad car, spinning the keys around his finger. “Now what?”
"I just know what was brought back wasn't my mom. She was a shell, a body with no substance. My dad didn't seem to notice or care now that his soul was gone. Moms old cop buddy, Bobby he came to check on us one day. Saw we were living with two soulless beings and that was it. We were placed in his care and both my parents were sent to the cage." Dean sighs, “The whole situation. Living with Bobby and his family, it's the reason I got into being a Guardian and I can't lose that Castiel. By law Guardians, can’t make deals or interfere with their Charges lives after the severing and yet here I am. I'm just like my dad.”
what he needs. "Hey, you're okay," Dean says
Castiel's laugh carries them into midnight. It’s only the beginning and it's already the best Christmas either of them has ever had.
"That's not what I'm worried about pal," Dean says, entering Castiel’s large kitchen. Normally Dean would want to take the chance to look around. He loves to cook but can never find a place big enough. This place, though with its open floor plan looks large enough even for Deans wings. And he can't even appreciate that. He's too pissed off. “I'm a fucking guardian, Castiel. Not your housewife.”
"Almost a decade," Dean admits
“No Sam, don’t apologize,” Dean says, cutting of Sam’s little tirade. He rubs his temples slowly and says, “It's not your fault all your friends are wizards. It’s just been a really long time since I’ve been around any wizards that aren't you or Eileen. I’m just worried, I guess - but don't feel bad about it.”
“Don't worry about that Gabe and Row won't mind if I miss. They have fun without me,” Sam says, and Dean can hear the smirk in his voice.
"Can’t you cut me some slack man, after everything that happened can't we just round it up to what 30 days and call it quits."
Castiel sighs. ”Sheriffs back.”
“Couple months, kinda realized all the reasons I was holding myself back were stupid macho bullshit. Or at least that's what Sarah said after she caught me looking at some dudes ass.”
"You are so beautiful," Castiel says pressing a kiss to Deans breastbone. His fingers tangling in Deans necklace. He up at Dean questioningly and Dean nods, sitting up so he can let his wings free. Castiel’s hands immediately tangling in his feathers.
"I think it’s going to rain soon," Cas yells up, he sounds more annoyed this time. "You should come down before it starts."
Groaning Dean opens the door, barely paying the mailman a passing glance when he signs for the package in his hands. It's a pretty mundane box, wrapped in brown paper with Dean’s name on the top. He can't remember ordering anything but sometimes Charlie gets him LARPing gear as a present after a tough case. Dean smiles at the thought, laying the package down. For all her nosiness and ignorance of personal boundaries, Charlies one of the good ones. LARPing this weekend might be the best thing to put his mind at ease. He might even meet someone new and get Castiel out of his head.
An eleven-hour drive is impossible on the best of days, but now he doesn't even have someone to switch with. Since Sam’s not here, Dean ends up pulling at the first motel he sees. Like a puppy, Cas’s head rises from the window when the car stops, looking both sympathetic and hopeful. Dean hates him a little bit. “Don’t get your hopes up. I’m just getting four hours then I’m heading to Stull. You can fuck off for all I care.”
“And?”
Dean ends up distracting himself with Bela Talbot’s case. Looking up her father Alistair's near-fatal car accident and trying to find out why it didn’t kill him. From his research, Dean also begins to wonder what kind of shifty deals Alistair made. Considering the profits he makes off his fully working Ouija board business.
"Are you okay?" Cas yells from below, he almost sounds worried.
"Even if he's an angel," Bela says, glaring at him again.
"I recommend that Jack remains in his mother's care until he reaches an age where he can make his own decisions. He's happy where he is. I don't see why we should ruin his life because he suddenly has some new powers." Dean says, his palms tingling.
"M'fine" Dean wheezes, It's the wrong time to remember how huge Cas's hands are. He swallows again getting his breathing under control. From this close, he can smell the ozone on Cas's skin. "You just surprised me. I didn't think you could lift my car man."
Charlie sighs, stopping her rant about encryption and deflating like a lead balloon. “Normally I’d say no.”
“That's true but Kelly’s a good friend and Jack -” Castiel starts to smile softly. It's something Dean's never seen him do. He wasn't even sure if Castiel was capable of looking that pleased. “- Jack is an amazing child, he's going to do great things one day.”
If you made it this far, I love you and I'm sorry it will get better soon I promise.
Dean smiles cheekily, "If you did, I wouldn't pay for it."
Dean shrugs, "Who knows when all this will blow over. Jack might be big enough to have pets by then." The words hurt to say, his nephew was only 2 months old when Dean saw him last. Now it’s only four months till his first birthday.
"Jack could do it." Amara interrupts. She doesn't look very happy to see Dean holding hands with someone else. But Deans too worked up to give a shit about what she thinks. "Theoretically. If Castiel wakes him up, Jack should be able to get you both out of there." Amara says, biting her lip.
Dean brings Castiel to the Roadhouse because its where Deans always went to relax. It's personal to him, a home away from home in many ways. Even if it's a bit scuffed up, the drinks good. The staff are great. And Dean has some pretty blasphemous thoughts about the burgers. Castiel, when he enters, doesn't look impressed, but he follows Dean to a booth. Throwing his dark peacoat down on the bench and glaring at the table like it has the answer to all of his problems.
not right here though. The waters getting cold."
“You've been a vessel half your life, Claire,” Dean says. A terrifying thought occurs to him, “How long have you been planning this?”
"You can’t charge ten bucks for directions," Green eyes says, still trying to get the car to reverse.
"Yeah well, I didn't know Dean was into men, so I guess we were both taken by surprise." Sam shakes his head, laughing a little. "I mean I come in here prepared to talk about the case and I see Dean asking you out right in front of my salad."
"I mean technically Bela saved him," Dean says stuttering when Castiel cups his jaw.
Dean does what he's told, flipping onto his stomach as Castiel straddles his ass. Immediately finding the glands under his feathers and squeezing hard.
"I only state the truth. It's a comment I've heard a lot."
Cas sighs, moodily looking out the window like a pouting teenager. “I don’t think I can fly again.”
Dean glares at him. “Because when I told you I wouldn't hurt you, it included not burning your eyes out with my true form!”
Grabbing hold of him, Castiel grips the strong curve of the prisoner's forearm as he leads him towards the cells. Like most things in the Sheriff's office, the room is painfully tiny. Containing two cells on the left side and a small side desk for the supervising officer. Who like most of the night shift is out having fun at patrol meaning this desk is now becoming Castiel's for the foreseeable future. Dean glances around, hands clinking in the cuffs as Castiel leads him to the chair. Sitting on the other side, Castiel opens the folder and glances at the prisoner. “What's your name?”
"So, you picked that song to make fun of me?" Dean asks, eyes hard. Castiel fucking knew this would happen.
“I… I never thought of like that.”
“Dean, it's a wedding. It’s a guaranteed chick flick.”
For a second Dean wonders what Cas is talking about. Considering the fact so much has happened since that morning in the car then he remembers, Sam, asking him to go to Lisa’s. To not save him for Hell but live an apple pie life. Like that’s really what Dean wants. Confused he turns to Cas and says, “You really think that’ll make me happy? That living with Lisa — who by the way hasn’t even agreed to that — is just going make me forget about Sammy.” Dean says his voice shaking over his brother's name. Still, he asks, “You really think I could forget about you?”
"So, in your opinion Mr Winchester do you believe that Jack is has the best possible care? Giving his current living conditions?" Castiel asks, his voice slow and steady. A complete change of pace from the righteous fury he questioned Naomi with.
Dean takes a step back his stomach-churning. “Son of a bitch.”
“It means you broke me, Dean!” Castiel yells, tears blurring his vision. “I had a life and hope and fucking faith and then I was alone. Deemed crazy after being praised as a miracle. And I could see all these things about the people who were supposed to help me. Personal, private things that I wasn't supposed to see. I just couldn't stop seeing things, even my dreams were - they were awful and despite the drugs and the therapy and the treatments I couldn't fucking stop. I just wanted it to stop. I just wanted to be saved. Missouri was the closest i've ever came to that -- but she isnt your God.”
"We have mutual acquaintances," Dean says his palm stings with the half-truth. "Castiel knew of my profession and asked for my help when he was preparing for this case. I later offered to testify after meeting with Gabriel Macleod."
“Amazing,” Cas says, shaking his head. “You must feel so proud of having your invention up there.”
"Your welcome," he mutters into the empty room, cradling his head in his hands when she leaves. He's never heard of an angel creating a deal. Never mind a soul one. Bela must be wrong about that. It's just not possible otherwise.
“Well maybe his sectary quit or something,” Claire says unconcerned by how shady this all sounds. “It doesn't matter what the job is Dean. I'm doing it.”
“Dean? Dean? Are you alright?” He asks grabbing Dean's chin and forcing him to meet Castiel's gaze. Dean blinks heavily and clears his throat. “I think I’m good.”
Dean sighs. Castiel is still going to be an asshole, but Dean doesn't have to prove Castiels point by stopping to his level. “Yeah alright, you have a heart of gold. I just meant that this look's like it's a lot of work, man.”
"What look?"
"It doesn't matter, it's still a yes." Cas kisses him again, his tongue sliding past Deans lower lip and making him shiver. He almost forgets about everything. Already trying to figure out how to pull Cas back into the shower when he pulls back. Dean scowls.
Ignoring the idea Castiel blows out the candles instead, while Daphne weeps. Something stirs within him. He has never been very good at comforting someone, even before the incident he always managed to say the wrong thing. It's worse now, though, because he can remember the feel of her pain, the coppery taste of it on his tongue. Avoiding direct skin contact, he places his hand on her shoulder. “Would you like some blackberry tea?” he asks as softly as possible. “I find it can be rather calming?”
"So what? Did you think going behind my back would make it easier? C'mon man, you're smarter than that." Dean says rolling his eyes. Cas looks away, rolling the necklace carrying his grace between his palms. "You're still hiding something from me, aren't you?"
Jack nods, his intense gaze zeroing in on the clues, despite himself Dean smiles. "You've got a pretty cool kid." He says truthfully.
Dean snorts, “I have both.”
Cas’s eyes darken watching Dean watch him. "Okay, you'll want to take a right up here."
“He removed his grace,” Dean says voice shaking. "He said his was grace was fading remember, back in the hell-mouth."
“What are you talking about?”
“Oh Stud, you have no idea,” Cas smirks, leaning into Dean's side as the elevator doors close on the couple outside.
Big thank you to
Dean sighs, looking around for a distraction from Cas's burning gaze. “Does the TV still work?”
Castiel has freckles on his stomach and a small mole below his left nipple. He's grinning at Dean like he's the best thing in the world. Dean groans fisting his dick as Castiel climbs over him. Kissing his mouth while he knocks Deans hand away.
He's still too pumped to sleep, so he knocks on the TV and settles in to watch the middle of the third Hatchetman movie. It's only one sloppy death later that he caves, picks up his phone and call’s Sarah.
Dean grins, sitting at the bar and biting into another strawberry. Castiel rolls his eyes, Dean is without a doubt, hotter than hell, when he takes control of the room like that. But Castiel likes him when he blushes and stammers. No one has ever been that way around him. It makes him feel wanted in a way he never has before. He watches Dean eat and waits for the perfect moment then says, "Y'know I have been the party at a couple of birthdays. My rates for orgies are excellent."
He hums under his breath as he fries the eggs. Trying not to sing the words to Shake it Off out loud. He doesn't want Cas to wake up and overhear him. Outside the snow continues to fall. A thick layer already covering the forest floor outside. For however long it takes to melt, they are essentially trapped here and Dean is strangely happy about it. It feels like the world is giving them a reprieve to explore what it means to be with each other. He's sure it won't last forever, he still needs to call Sam about Cas's spell and Chuck is still a problem. But for now, Dean just wants to enjoy being with Cas for however long the universe gives him.
"Not for you, no," Castiel says making his way over to Dean’s personal space. Dean watches him with wide eyes. Castiel has never met a client who lets a hundred bucks go to waste like this. He sits himself down on the footstool and puts his hands on Dean’s spread legs. Letting Dean see what he’s missing right now.
“I don’t know Sam, am I gonna be the only no-mag at this wedding?”
"The things you have done are why I have faith, Dean," Cas says kissing Dean softly. "You inspired me to defy God's will long before we came to this point. You told me yourself last week, we can do this. Chuck doesn't expect us to make our paths. You can't change your mind about that now."
“I still can’t lie.”
Glancing over at Cas, Dean watches as the black kitten enters from the back door and worms her way around Cas's legs. Blue eyes assessing him almost as severely as their owners.
It's at that moment that Dean realises he's probably going to die.
“Claire told me.” Charlie says reassuringly, “She came in to get her paperwork and then grabbed me and told me how you took her deal.”
It sure is a hell of a lot nicer place than he would have expected from a shady demon. Intimidated by the wealth here, Dean gives her his most charming smile, “I need to speak to Castiel Gladius. It's about a deal he made.”
“With what? Why can’t you just explain what you want with me Dean?!”
Dean shrugs, taking the glass out of Castiel’s hand and downing the drink. Eyes locked with Castiel’s affronted gaze. "I suppose we should," He says, placing the glass on the table.
Stunned Dean nods, standing and removing his pants and boxers. Castiel drags him closer by the waist the second he's bare, kissing the head of Dean's cock.
Castiel loves working the gigs, the bands are always different. Sometimes its rappers, sometimes indie pop. Tonight's group is set up to be a classic rock cover band and the crowds coming in droves. Castiel sells so much IPA he has to go down to the basement and get another keg. And that's just before the show starts. He's just pushing open the basement door, keg balanced on his shoulders. When the band comes in he almost drops the keg on his foot.
“Maybe,” Castiel says, trying to hide his relief at Dean still being here behind a smirk. “What’s it do?”
He found it ages ago, back when he was consulting, and Dean remembers the first time he brought Claire here. It was before they had found their rhythm with each other. Back when Claire hated the world and everyone in it. But it was here, that Claire smiled at him for the first time after trying Benny’s pie. In a lot of ways, it’s become they're happy place. These days they don't even need to go to the counter because Elizbeth knows they always order the same thing.
Everything feels fuzzy and he’s not sure what the fuck's going on but he slowly rises to his feet. He has a funny feeling that they should hurt more, but he can't remember why. Leaning against baby for support, he tries to not throw up. His head is spinning, and he’s pretty sure he must have imagined the naked guy in front of him. Except when he opens his eyes the guy is still there. Still naked and still junkless. “Ah.”
"With all due respect to you, your Grace being an archangel isn't everything." Dean snaps ignoring Raphael and Cas’s widening gazes. "Sure, Jacks powerful and I have no doubt he's going to be a great leader someday. But what you are all forgetting is Jack is just a kid. If he wasn't an archangel this case wouldn't have even gone to trial and we all know it. If Jack was a mortal everyone in this room would stop ignoring the fact that Kelly is a great mom. And acknowledge the fact that she is doing a great job raising her kid. Unlike Nick who has shown no paternal interest in his own goddamn son until his ability’s developed.”
Dean had first met her on his last visit five years ago. She was a baby compared to Cas but he had taken her under his wing anyway. Accepting the redhead as his new apprentice without hesitation. Even though it meant he had to install the internet. Cas always forgot the world evolved sometimes. Dean had to introduce him to the concept of electricity, for god's sake. Hell, he still wrote Dean letters by hand. Charlie was the embodiment of recent generations. For some reason, she didn't fit in with the magical crowd either. Dean never asked, but there was always a haunted look in her eyes. Cas loved her like family, that much Dean could see right away. He would never abandon her. Something has to be going on with him.
“But none of them are in the wedding party, right?”
Dean sighs, “Yeah, that's exactly it, too bad I got arrested.” Castiel laughs and Dean grins softly, not meeting Castiel’s eye.
“Really?” Dean asks eyebrows raised.
It occurs to Castiel that in Dean's profession his brother could very well be dead. Carefully he continues “Earlier you said you had a brother, I was just wondering if he hunts too.”
“You better, Claire is making dinner tomorrow and you're invited.”
Dean laughs doubling over like he's been punched in the stomach. The giggles pour out of him, along with gasps he doesn't need to take. He scrambles to find the letter, reading it one more time, because he has to be sure it's true. Cas said he loved him. Cas loved him. Christ. He wasn't expecting that.
“Look Claire made a demon deal alright,” Dean yells, scrubbing a hand through his hair. Ignoring the concerned look he gets from the woman beside him. “I just need to know how risky this guy is.”
Rowena laughs, stopping in front of Castiel’s place even though Dean never told her the address. Witches are fucking creepy sometimes. "What you need my dear is to celebrate." She says, unlocking the car. "Preferably with sex."
He gets the sense Cas is doing something similar when he rolls his eyes at Dean watching a telenovela. It’s clear five minutes in that Cas hates it but he doesn't say anything. Instead, he picks up a dark notebook and doodles. He doodles a lot now that he's human. Dean's desperate to see what he's doing bit he's not invading Cas's privacy like that. They are both walking on eggshells around each other. It's something they've never done before. Its pissing Dean off more than he would like.
Castiel sighs and thinks of the people in his life. Missouri, and Patience, and even strangers like Daphne. He doesn't want them to die, but he also thinks of the booze and the drugs. The vices he has because of what heaven apparently did to him. “I can’t do this.”
“Yeah, and I stayed as far away from him and his cronies as possible. C’mon Dean, do you really think I’d hang around with racist assholes?”
One brushes Dean's neck as he unlocks the door, smiling when he sees Cas’s beat-up orange couch and Persian rug. It's not fancy, or even neat by some standards, but the place is soothing. Way better than any motel, or Bobby’s infamous pull-out.
"The names Dean," Dean says getting ready to leave the room. "I’ll see you tomorrow Krushnic."
"Why does an alien care what I think?"
"Sleep on it," Dean bites out, scrabbling to his feet. "Or its pliers in the morning."
"Gabriel, what's got you all wound up?" A sleepy elegant voice asks from the door. Dean glances up as Rowena enters, her dark red hair falling in loose waves. She smiles softly when Sam hands her the mug he was working on, kissing her cheek and placing his hand on her waist. "Dean slept with Castiel Gladius." He tells her because he's a dirty traitor.
"Alright if you’re sure," Dean says, after a pause. Trying not to feel to stung. Cas probably needs his space after Deans breakdown. Still, Dean ends up stalling, writing a list of what he needs to get and checking it more than once. Waiting to see if Cas will change his mind. Cas doesn’t look at him once. He gets the fire lit and unearths a different notebook from the one Deans gotten used to seeing him with. There are soot stains on the cover. Dean squints at it before he forces himself to leave.
Dean actually missed doing this kind of casework and Castiel is good at it. Castiel knows how to do his job but he's respectful of Deans knowledge. He listens to Deans suggestions and asks about angelic customs obviously interested. It's a pleasant change of pace, from the constant sniping they used to do with each other. But it's about the only thing that has changed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was Eileen's idea. She wanted to honor that moment we met somehow, so we used our house colors as the main theme - but merged them together; pairing silver and red, and green and gold together instead, to show us coming together.”
The crowd starts cheering the band’s name as they disappear and Castiel taps Meg's shoulder, "I'm going for my smoke break." He says, desperately needing some air. Meg nods, gesturing to Anna who's working the floor to help her out while Castiel leaves.
"Yeah well," Dean sniffs, nuzzling into Castiel’s shoulder. "I still want to watch Christmas movies with you."
Dean sighs giving into the urge to touch and reaches out until he’s cupping Cas jaw. “I believe in you Cas.” He says stroking his thumb lightly down Cas’s cheek. “I know you're going to get Jack back and I want to help you with this. I won't let Chuck or the Empty or even my dumb ass take you away from me. I want us to do this together because even though you piss me off with this dumb self-sacrifice crap, I still love you."
It takes two days before they eventually make it out of bed for more than food. He hasn't felt this horny in at least a decade. Deans closer the forty than he is to thirty at this point, but he aches for sex like he did in his twenties. Cas is every dream he's ever had come true and his dick won't let Dean forget it. It helps that Cas can't keep his hands to himself. A millennium of chastity and a decade of wanting Dean seemed to be bubbling over and Dean loves it.
She smiles at both of them. “So you're the groomsmen, then? You’ll be in rooms 401 and 402,” she says cheerfully, reaching for keys of the wall. “Hope you don’t mind conjoined rooms? Sam booked that whole row for the groomsmen, even though they're supposed to be for families.”
“So, I’ve basically blabbed at least half of my life story and you’ve given me nothing in return. It's not fair man, especially because I’m curious.”
Dean rubs his eyes beneath his glasses, feeling a tension migraine coming on. “Claire -”
"How? He's evaded the cops before."
Cas snorts into Deans collarbone. His beard scratching
“Yeah, yeah fuck,” Dean gasps out, trying to match his pace to the slick noises he can hear from Cas’s end of the call.
“Maybe,” Dean says crossing his arms.
Cas nods. "Okay, that's fair," he says, nearly finished with his bowl. "What about your visit to Sam and Sarah’s? You said Sarah got you drunk."
“We don’t even know if Jack will be scared.”
“Oh,” Sam says, Dean can feel his bitchface through the phone. “So, Claire's Severing wasn't today?”
“Yes, well you are an angel.” Castiel quips nipping Dean’s jaw before kissing his mouth. Dean bites his lip in revenge grabbing Castiel’s horns tightly in both fists. He uses his grip as leverage to roll their hips together, precome and sweat making the drag slick. “Dean,” Castiel groans, his whole eyes turning crimson.
Dean shrugs, “Maybe, I won’t know until I find him.”
“Sam's the strongest person I know and if you don’t believe that then why the hell are you still here?”
Dean bites his lip, "Cas-"
"You're such a pretty beggar," Castiel says, bending down to kiss Dean. Dean moans, holding onto Castiels waist as he rolls his hips in small figure eights. It's so fucking good being inside him. Castiel seems to agree if his moans are anything to go by. Dean licks into his mouth, swallowing the noises. God, he feels close to coming already. Slowly he starts to thrust up into Castiel’s tight heat. Castiel rolls his hips down again, breaking the kiss to pant against Dean's mouth.
“Is this about her curse?”
Dean whines, "Castiel please," He says, his nails digging into Castiel’s skin. Castiel laughs as he begins to press down and down and down. Taking Dean in so slowly it's killing him. He laughs again when he's fully seated. Gripping Dean's shoulder's tight.
“That’s because he hated it.”
Dean smiles crookedly, “I wouldn’t mind if people found out. Sure it might hurt some investments, but we’d probably still be in the green.” Dean’s face falls, a hurt look taking over his face. “My business partner he disagrees.”
"It can't Dean," Cas says, pulling out grace from under his shirt. "As long as I don't have this, the empty has no claim over me."
Sam sighs, “You need to read the contract. Look for anything that mentions using Claire's abilities. Ask Claire for her copy.”
"I was still pissed at him. I still put a gun to his head. Sam almost killed Bobby, and I didn't jump to that."
"Uncle Castiel taught me how," Jack says, still looking at the book. "He likes to do the really hard ones from the paper."
“Deputy, please,” Dean says, sounding uneasy. “Just put it down.”
"You were friends," Dean realizes blinking in surprise. He never really thought about Cas and Bobby before. Sure, they worked together, but Dean had always thought it was by necessity. Looking at Cas’s sad smile he realizes he missed the mark with that one.
“How long can you drag out fixing the roof?”
Like him, the kittens were all alone. Two little things left in a box by the dollar store and in a moment of insanity Dean had picked them up this morning. After stopping by a vet to get them checked, Dean ended up bringing the little things back with him and bottle feeding them over zoom while Charlie and Sam brainstormed names. Munchkin and Malcolm don’t exactly count as human, but he figures they'll be good company. It's funny how isolation is affecting him. He used to hate cats, now he's picking them up and letting them curl up on his chest as he binges Netflix.
“No! I'm not getting arrested for contempt of court for our deal Castiel!” Dean yells suddenly pissed as hell. Here he was trying to make nice with the demon and now Castiel wants to tank his career. “I could lose my job for having a fucking deal with you in the first place, you want me to show that off on the stand.”
Dean blinks, his first instinct is to say no. Cas has no clue what he’s doing. The thought of him going up on the roof is terrifying. When Dean knows if he falls it will hurt this time. But Cas isn't a baby, he’s older than the earth itself and Dean's tired of arguing with him. He bites his lip, thinking. "Okay, as far as I know, there’s a ladder in the basement. Help me set it up and I'll see what you can do."
"How can you hate Christmas movies?' Castiel asks sitting on the couch of their new apartment. It’s possible he's never been this stunned.
Cas is wearing his trench coat over his flannel. The sight of it winds Dean a little. Cas tilts his head to the side. “Are you ready to go.”
Truefully Castiel doesn't understand much of Dean's vehicular love until he sees the Impala itself. The dark shape glitters under his headlights, smooth chrome and dark steel that glistens in the rain. Showcasing sharp angles and smooth curves that make up its frankly enormous size. It's loud and bold, dangerous and mysterious, the kind of car everyone would turn to see and smile when witnessing her glory. Castiel couldn't think of a more perfect match for Dean if he tried.
Kelly sighs, "I know what Crowley can do Castiel. I was there for every failed negotiation how the hell are we going to convince a judge when he's in the room."
"Why is that anyway?" Dean asks exchanging the bar of soap for Cas's shampoo. "I thought Nick got pretty close to summoning Lucifer."
"Oh," Dean waffles scratching the back of his neck. This is ridiculous. He thought he put these feelings away in the office. But seeing Jamie has left him spiraling. "Well, thanks for that, I guess. I'll see you around Jamie."
The man blinks at him, still looking stunned by Castiel’s attire. Which is such bullshit? Castiel is pretty sure hotel guys see nipples all the time. Ash down at the plaza has a chart. Castiel’s have gotten a perky rating. The man clears his throat. “Uh, where would you like it?”
"Brothers," Dean says into thin air as Sam gets his bags from the trunk. Dean watches him as he goes up to one of the other hunters, who seems to recognize him. She's smiling at him like he's the best thing since sliced bread. Dean shakes his head at the sight before turning his baby back towards the main road. He's got a couple of hours of daylight left and he doesn't want to waste them.
Castiel smiles over his shoulder, "Don't worry Dean I won't make you wear the uniform."
“I meant what I said Dean,” Cas says gritting his teeth. “I love you.”
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam says happily.
“No. I can’t - Dean, you're a felon. I have a job to do and - Why are you staring at me like that.” Castiel asks, shivering, the room suddenly shockingly cold.
He almost goes to his car, but he can't drive like this. His hands are fucking shaking. Dean throws off his dumb fucking hat and storms into the woods. Walking and walking until he's thoroughly lost. He doesn't know if Cas is coming after him. He doesn't even know if he wants him too. Eventually, Dean stops to breathe and let it all sink in. Then he looks down at the small axe he placed on his the belt. It's a small axe, mean from chopping up the slats. Dean brings it out and starts hacking the first tree he sees.
bothering you. You’ll explode
“You need me to read it for you.”
“What kind of reasons?” Castiel asks, voice dropping slightly. His previous anxiety of flirting with Dean disappearing now that his jobs not on the line.At least as long as they don’t get caught out here.
Castiel grabs the edge of the trench and pulls himself up just as Dean takes a shot. The ghost screams. “Fucking visibility is shit in this!” He yells reloading as Castiel stands up. From the distance, he watches as the ghost advances, grey form almost invisible in the sheet of rain. Dean shoots again and this time he makes the shot, the ghost vanishes.
“Rowena we’ve talked about this,” Sam says sounding pained.
Sam shakes his head running a hand through his wet hair. "I feel like this is a coffee situation." He says moving to the percolator.
"No," Dean says harshly, before clearing his throat. "At least I hope not, we can work on the terms over dinner. See how long we want to keep the deal going."
Castiel frowns, "Of course I care what you think. That's why I came to The Garden in the first place to find out what you humans are doing."
“Okay, later nerd.”
Castiel shrugs, doubting him once again. He just won’t know for sure if Dean's being truthful or not till he runs his prints. “You need to get your picture taking first.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. He knew Sam was training as an apprentice in alchemy, but he didn't realize a crush would develop from it. “Well, Sammy, I didn’t know you had a thing for the older ladies.”
"Okay, so in my defence, Cas didn't tell me what the exhibit was about. He said something from Hardgate wound up there, and he wanted to check it out."
Dean sits up with a sigh. “Yeah, Yeah I get that reaction a lot.”
"I believe you already have."
"Okay," Dean says in disbelief. Cas wants to forgive him, it might be the best news he’s head all day. "Whatever you want Cas."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes.”
Dean slides the paper over along with the pen. His wings haven't stopped ruffling.
Licking his lips Dean stares at Cas, "Have you ever you know - fucked a guy before."
“Stop fucking around, Dean. Did you steal that ring?” Castiel snaps, hitting the bar.
Cas frowns, “You don’t like my ideas.”
Thank you all for coming back and reading this fic after so long you mean the world to me.
Castiel’s posture remains perfect but his tail drops. Dean clenches his fist fighting to stay silent. He can’t help but resent Raphael’s decision. He’d rather they would make Crowley shut up.
"Actually, Meg I'm not doing the marathon this year," Castiel admits, ignoring the enquiring gaze he receives from Dean. "I've been too busy."
"Because I was worried you would act like this." Cas snaps, scrubbing his jaw. "I wasn't like it was hard choice to make Dean. Jack was my son, and it’s not  like our lives have had many happy moments."
Which means he's just going to have to suck it up and talk to his brother about his fucking feelings. Dean hates talking to Sam about his feelings. Sighing Dean packs his shit and leaves class in a sulk. He's nervous despite himself. He's sure Sam won't care about the whole Bi thing but Dean's stomachs still churning. He knows the longer he puts it off the worst he'll feel. So, he decides to just get it over and done with. Skipping the library today and heading home. His fingers tapping an uneven staccato against the steering wheel. Even driving his Baby doesn't put his mind at ease. His palms are fucking sweating as more and more what-ifs run through his mind.
"I'll get the lube if you take off your pants," Cas says, staring down at Dean with dark hungry eyes. Dean wants more than he can say. He nods already scrambling as Cas reaches under the bed to pull out the lube. "I don't have condoms," Cas says hesitantly, his cheeks flushed.
Charlie knows her way around a computer and made sure all the tripwires wouldn't pick him up. So Dean took his time. He normally wasn't one for museums, Sam often wandered the halls of places like this. Claiming it was for nostalgic reasons, but Dean didn't get it. He lost his mortality in the Seven-Years’ War, and it was barely a blip in comparison to the wars to come. These places glorified them. Often stacked with war memorabilia and uniforms. It always left him feeling pissed off. Here he is a walking, talking monster, but humans surprise him with their brutality.
Dean bites his lip. “It's delicate.”
“I’m not him anymore.” Castiel mutters, shrugging. He's not surprised that Dean knows the name of the man he used to be. Just sad that the man he used to be is dead and gone into a bottle.
“Nope,” Dean says, bumping against Castiel's shoulder. “You ready for this?” he asks, looking hesitantly at Castiel. Unaware that the change in his demeanour is stupidly endearing.
Trembling, he starts towards the desk. He could tell Nancy what he saw. Maybe she’d even believe him, but he also knows that’d she’d be terrified. Dean on the other hand, despite being a liar and criminal; is the owner of the ring; bears the same oval mark and oddly believes in ghosts. Somehow Castiel doesn't think that's a coincidence. By the time he reaches the desk, he's made his decision. “I'm fine Nance. I just tripped,” he says smiling falsely.
“Maybe.” Dean says not looking very hopeful. “It depends on whether you’ve run my prints yet?”
Dean shakes his head, wondering if he's picked that up wrong because surely the Soviet isn't saying Deans got a pretty mouth. He sits back on his heels still hovering over Castiel who straightens suddenly, his eyes wide. Dean starts wondering if that was something he even meant to say out loud. He's never known a Russian to use flirtation as a tactic, that's normally Dean’s thing.
"You don't know what you're talking about Sam." Dean snaps, face flushing with rage. He has been off his game for a while. But he thought he was making a pretty good attempt at using the Frank Devereaux method of faking it till he makes it. He never thought Sam would pick up on this shit, never mind make a connection that even Dean wasn't aware existed. He should have known better than to underestimate him by now. "I'm
Sunday morning dawns and Dean flies to Cas’s place at 9 am instead of 6. He knows from Castiel’s schedule that he likes to sleep in today. So, Dean doesn’t rush when he flies. He's been trying not to overthink last night's conversation. It doesn't mean anything has to change just because that Castiel helped him out. He’s still making Dean work himself to death. He’s still an asshole for making Dean come in today. Nothing should change just because he was nice to Dean one time.
“But-”
So this chapter was a trip, kind of lie this month actually. I'm not going to like I had no motivation to write anything last month. All my creativity dried up in the wake of Corona because I had no idea what was happening. Honestly, I still don't but thankfully we are in a mandatory lockdown. I know I've made dozens of promises before about when I will get this fic finished but I'm feeling hopeful for having it done by the end of April. I will go back to posting on Fridays starting from this Friday but for now, have a rare Monday update because I left you so long.
God, it's been so long since he’s seen her look so happy. Was she ever this happy with him? Dean doesn’t even want to think about that.
"Everything will work out okay Charlie. I promise," Dean says and for the first time in his immortal life, he prays that he's right. He spends another few hours consoling her, trying not to think about all the awful places Cas could be.
Dean scoffs, "Why would he do that? he hates me."
Raphael turns their cold gaze to Crowley. Looking at him like he's an interesting bug under their shoe. "Mr Crowley would you please present your witness."
"It's
"Already got you covered, I hacked their page this morning. You should be able to break in without any issues."
It should be terrifying, Dean’s been afraid of demons half his life. So seeing it on full display like this should make him flinch away. But oddly enough it’s the most gorgeous thing he’s ever seen. Panting against Castiel’s cheek, Dean meets Castiel’s red gaze and shudders.
Freezing water pounds down on Deans skull. He knows he needs to leave the shower and get ready. That was his excuse to leave the room for crying out loud but Amara. Fucking Amara. Deans stomach feels like it’s being pulled towards her despite everything he feels for Cas. He scrubs more soap over his right arm. The skin is pink and puffy as he rubs at again and again. Trying to remove a sting that's no longer there.
"Cas of course I understand, I miss the kid. I miss him so much. But you should have told me what you were doing I could have helped. You can't keep going behind my back man. Not after everything we've been through."
There are twelve missing pieces in total and Dean needs to replace them all before the snow starts. He measures the space left behind, writing the numbers on the back of his hand. It's not the worst he’s ever seen, He still gets chills when he thinks about the refurbishment he at Lisa’s. This is actually fixable. Dean grabs the tarp, pleased to see its wide enough to cover it until he gets fresh lumber to fix it. Nailing it into the beams takes up another few minutes but it's soon time for Dean to face the music.
He turns the radio off, unable to listen to tales of destruction because he can’t possibly believe there's no hope left. Sure there's a chance Dean won't get his brother back in Stull, more than a chance really because even if he gets Sam free from Lucifer, his baby brother's still going to Hell. Dean will be damned if he lets his brother go for anything less than saving the world. He’s not like Cas and Bobby.
Cas makes a sympathetic noise, “I forgot about that. My ex was a muggle, and he always complained about the drowsiness that came after.”
It's a long-ass bus ride to Castiel’s office. Long enough for Dean to realise this is a bad idea. He could lose his job for this after all. While it's not illegal to see Claire after the severing. He's prohibited from meddling in Claire's life. But he's got to do this. Claire deserves to be cured; Dean knows that.
“No more dumb chores. I’ve been giving you tasks I know are stupid because I thought you were being a dick. Now I realise that unnecessary. Especially when I have a job that is suitable for you.”
The week leading up to Jack's case is a tough one. Castiel has a measly two-hour slot on the docket to fight this thing. Before leaving the decision with Raphael. He's spent most of the week printing depositions. Calling teachers and neighbours and training Dean to take the stand.
Swallowing as he puts on his boots Dean winks at the kitten, "Wish me  luck, it's ice-cold out there." Tilting her head exactly like Cas Spice yowls. Dean considers that as decent encouragement. Outside the ground has vanished beneath the snow. The pine trees around Cas's home are full of it, making the whole hollow smell like Christmas. Hopefully, it will have melted a bit before then. He wants Sam to come to the cabin and celebrate with them. Maybe they'll even have Jack back by then. Dean clears his throat against the rush of emotions that hit him. He's still conflicted about how he feels about Jack. He knows the kid was manipulated by Chuck just like everyone else. But he's still the reason Dean doesn't have his mom around anymore. He has no idea if he can ever forgive the kid for it, but he won't have the chance to try with Jack gone. He really needs to call Sam about Cas's spell.
Cas shakes his head, rubbing the shampoo through Deans hair. "
Dean's only been working for Castiel for nearly three weeks, a measly twenty days of his sixty six and he's never been more tired. His days have taken on a depressing routine. There's no bus route to Cas’s place, so Dean flies there every morning, walks his demon dog, then leaves. He goes to work, looks at his cases and takes out all his anger on the Police Commissioner over Bela Talbot. Because the dick won't give him visitation rights.
"Yeah," Sam sighs, blinking in surprise when Cas takes Deans hand. A small smile forming on his face despite the topic. "Amara's back Dean and she's coming here."
"I wasn't sure until I met this one -" She gestures absently at Eileen. Who's still glaring at her like she's getting paid for it. "Death isn't on this plain."
Forcing his ass out of bed Dean drives to the hardware store, glaring up at the dark clouds overhead. The Impala has always done shit in the snow. So Dean has always been wary of it. He’s seen enough snow clouds throughout his life to spot them from miles away. These clouds aren't them, but they promise the kind of heavy rain that will make roof repair a bitch. Dean will have to watch out for that. He's been more clumsy than usual recently. Before he left the bunker, he had tripped on his shoelaces. He wonders if it’s a symptom of getting older. If it is, Apocalypse or not Dean might have to retire soon.
Cas flinches, proving Dean right without a single fucking word. "Godammit Castiel! I thought we were trying to get past this."
"What do I feel like you're not talking about the roof?" Cas asks eyebrows raised.
Sam gives Dean the annoyed little brother look, that he practically perfected at age thirteen just to ruin Dean's life. “I’m not being an asshole Dean, you are!”
Finally, Cas looks at him, “You're angry.” He says sounding slightly surprised by it.
She smiles brightly at Dean. “Good to see you again,” she says, pulling him into a tight hug that makes Dean wheeze. Despite being so tiny, Eileen easily crushes his lungs - and doesn’t let up until he squeezes back.
The cemetery gates are unsurprisingly padlocked tight. Dean kneels and pulls a lock-picking kit out of his boot. Castiel shakes his head unsurprised, “What about your brother?”
“Smartass,” Dean says rolling his eyes. Cas shakes his head, leading Dean to the dark green truck he hid behind the cabin.
"Shut the fuck up." Dean gasps, pushing hard at Castiel’s chest so he's flattened against the bed. His fingers slipping free being an unfortunate side effect. Dean takes it in his stride, searching for Castiel’s dick so he can position it between his legs.
Dean blinks up at Cas from where he's slumped on the couch, watching the snow melt on the window. "I was listening to that." He says still frowning from how useless he's starting to feel. He thought he'd love a vacation with Cas but now that he knows the worlds ending it's impossible to ignore.
"I am," Castiel mutters, swerving lanes. Dean flinches. "It was an accident, Dean. There's no loophole in the contract. I never planned to force you to do anything."
“Not often, no,” Castiel gasps, finding Dean's mouth again, sliding his hand over the soaking material of Dean's shirt to thumb at his neck. Dean shivers. “We should actually try to get warm, though.”
“Of course,” Castiel says grabbing Jacks hand and pulling him towards one of the benches in the foyer. Dean follows them, his feathers rustling softly.
I feel so bad now cause Cas forgave Dean so quickly and so softly in that episode and I've left you all in suspense for this long. Also yes as they were talking last night I was nodding and occasionally going I wrote some of these words ???? Are we this fortunate. It was a rollercoaster.
“Sam don’t.” Dean bites out. He never should have told Sam about what Leo meant to him. It
“Huh,” Dean says, looking over the stacks of paper that Castiel seems to be drowning in. “This woman must have made quite the deal for you to be doing all this.”
When he looks back, Dean's fighting with his shoestring. Castiel smiles, tension draining from his shoulder as Dean mutters under his breath. It seems impossible that someone could be so dangerous and endearing at the same time, and Castiel is honestly hopelessly infatuated with him because of it. Banishing thoughts of monsters and demons from his mind, Castiel shrugs his shirt off his shoulders and kicks off his boots. Dean pouts. “Show off,” he mutters, smiling triumphantly as the knot finally starts to ease. Castiel laughs, stripping off his pants and boxers in one go before climbing over the tub and into the spray, grabbing at the shampoo.
Castiel raises his eyebrow. “I’m pretty sure that's destruction of private property.”
“What archangel case?” Gabriel asks, the laughter gone from his voice.
Dean knew it the moment he saw the kittens, but it didn't hit him until he saw Cas in town. Cas knew the kid in the hardware store. Asking “Henry” about his grades and thanking him for helping them with the wood choices. When they were loading the lumber into the truck an older man had stopped to help. Telling Cas to stop by his diner when he had the chance. Even now Cas is open and friendly with the people he meets in the grocery store.
"Hey there," She says, all southern drawl and welcoming. Bela blinks in surprise.
Dean downs the cup placing it on his locker before scrabbling of the bed. Castiel starts getting dressed as Dean runs into the bathroom. Where he takes the quickest off all showers. Scrubbing of the sweat and last night’s come from his skin. “There’s a spare toothbrush under the sink!” He yells over the spray.
“Dean as a demon, I'm hardly qualified to give you any advice about being a Guardian,” Castiel says looking down at the plate unimpressed. “That's an angels domain.”
Charlie keeps frowning her face not moving an inch.
Holding her hand Dean weaves his grace into her skin. Soothing her headache and watching as her shoulders loosen. "It will take some time." He promises her pulling away.
Dean does, spreading his long freckled legs without shame. Climbing in between them, Castiel runs his palm up Dean's leg, kissing at goosebumps and using his tongue against the raised edge of an old scar. Above it, he sucks another bruise into the inside of Dean's thigh.
"Cas!" Castiel yells over the slamming door. Dean looks back in the cell window lingering on Castiel’s exposed and cum painted skin. "I like it when you called me Cas."
"I'm near your neighbourhood," Dean says, shrugging even though Sam can't see him.
Castiel tilts his head to the side like a bird. “She made a deal for her father to die?”
Neither of them brings it up on the ride home but Dean remains thoughtful the whole night.
Dean snorts, flicking Castiel’s nose. "For that, I get to pick the first movie."
"I've felt it too," Cas admits, not quite meeting Deans eye. "Before coming here, I met a Djinn that reminded me of Chuck. I thought I was just angry but now I'm wondering if it was some kind of ... foreshadowing."
"Beautiful," Castiel says, somehow managing to bite out a compliment. "I was going to say they are beautiful. I've never seen gold like that."
Dean jumps up to help him, trying to think of other questions he can ask Cas about his past. Desperate for any information about his life that Cas is willing to give him. He jumps when he feels a tug on his jeans. Looking down Dean meets the curious green eyes of Cas’s ginger kitten. "Hey, there little guy," He mumbles crouching down so it can sniff his fingers.
Cas watches him with soft eyes. "Come back to bed Dean. The world’s not ending yet and you need to sleep." He kisses Dean, his teeth playing over Deans lip. "Or you could let me tire you out, I promise it will be a lot more worth your time than listening to the radio."
Dean blinks, "You can hear me?" He asks cheeks flushed.
He scratches the back of his neck, “Anyway I should get going thanks again for your help.”
Castiel raises his eyebrow walking further into the room and glancing at the stack of DVDs and food on the coffee table. "Dean, what is all of this?"
“Oh, okay,” Cas says, he almost sounds disappointed. Dean tries not to read too much into that. “I’m going to go to bed then, I’ve got an early shift.”
“Why the fuck did you make a deal Claire?!”
Cas shakes his head, grasps Dean's chin and kisses him softly. "You can be surprisingly adorable for a man that kills monsters."
“Unfortunately.”
Scratching the back of his neck, Dean chuckles. "You know me too well." He admits, entering the house and heading in the opposite direction from them. He knows the corridors well, his photos even on some of the walls, Claire usually beside him. Standing outside her door, he takes a deep breath before knocking. He hopes she's still not mad at him.
“Claire convinced me to hear her out,” Castiel says shrugging. His smirk showing the points of his sharpened teeth. “She also added a clause that meant our deal didn't go into effect until the Severing was completed.”
Dean sits on the couch, tapping a staccato on the arms. "Business, I think."
Dean smiles. “You will.”
“You almost forgot my ring!”
He has a small collection of cheap shirts. Some lace, others so chiffon they are transparent. Shorts so tiny it's obscene. A kilt that he loves and the faux-leather pants that Meg says make's his ass look amazing. He puts those on with one the white shirts. And tries not to fidget in the mirror.
Castiel sighs. “Definity,” he says, just before Dean kisses him, soft and relaxed, seemingly entirely at ease in Castiel's arms.
“So you wouldn’t make fun of me the day before my wedding, you jerk.”
"He didn't call me back," Dean says walking into the kitchen.
“Thanks, man,” Dean says, handing his bag over before following Sam to the entrance. Looking back, he sees Cas wave before speaking to Eileen again. Dean sighs. Cas, outside of being gorgeous, seems kind and genuine and it’s just too bad Dean can’t even try and do anything about it. Not at Sam's wedding, anyway. It doesn't matter that Cas the first person to make his heart actually flutter in years. He’s not gonna embarrass himself, or his brother, like that. Hell, it’s not like Cas will ever be interested in a squib like him anyway. It’ll be easier if he just ignores him altogether - his heart won’t get broken that, way at least.
Castiel smirks, showing just the tip of his pointed teeth. "Well as part of your duties anyway. I expect you to walk Cerberus every day." He says, walking into the house Cerberus trailing behind him. Dean follows as Castiel continues to speak. "Claire approached me at the perfect time actually. My housekeeper just left on maternity leave so I need someone to help me with the upkeep of this place."
"Your awfully complimentary tonight," He says kneading Castiel’s ass.
Cas swallows a broken noise. Releasing his grip on Dean's shoulders, and pushes him until Dean's legs hit the couch. Cas starts scrambling with the buttons of Deans flannel. While Dean tries to do the same thing with Cas's. The black paint of the weird sigil flaking off Cas's chest as Dean snaps the button's open. The second Dean's free from his shirt Cas pushes him again. Dean lets himself sink into the couch. Cas straddling him and kissing Dean
Dean laughs, pushing Castiel into the room. Surprisingly Castiel stumbles, then frowns at his feet. The alcohol clearly affecting him more than he realised. Dean snorts and begins undoing Castiel’s tie. Dragging the silk away and finally kissing Castiel’s neck like he's been dreaming of doing all night.
"Oh, you know the usual." Jody says blowing out a long sigh, "I'm chief of police but I've still never seen fights worse than living with a pack of teenage girls trying to order pizza."
“We’ll get wet digging anyway.” Dean reminds him. Castiel groans reluctantly following Dean down through the two blocks to the cemetery.
Castiel’s smile is nothing short of predatory as he thinks back to the moment. "That was pretty brutal of me, wasn't it?"
Castiel laughs turning back to the Kline’s. "Do you want a ride home as well?" Castiel asks Kelly who shakes her head.
Dean doesn't mean to do it, but he manages to put off talking to Castiel all day. He does his chores, walking Cerberus and cleaning up more crap than usual. Castiel requested a simple rare steak and potatoes tonight. Dean's relieved, steak is far easier than some of the other shit Castiel’s asked him to make.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. James could have. Too bad your God killed him.”
“You wouldn't be lying,” Sam says, his eyes focused. “You could just say that Castiel approached you about working on the case and you agreed to help out. It's not a lie, it's just not everything.”
Castiel smiles, "Okay, sure."
what a fucking understatement. "So you just made up a guy to make me feel less unsettled?"
“They say muggle in Ireland.”
"Okay," Cas stroking down Dean's neck until he bumps against the chain. "Don't worry about her Dean. We haven't lost yet."
“Not necessarily,” Dean says, somehow becoming the voice of optimism. “Raphael may be traditional, but they have been known to break custom if they think it will help kids.”
Castiel raises an eyebrow. “You’ve done this before?”
“What?” Dean says because the guy isn’t making any sense. None of this makes any sense, one second he was home shooting the shit with Charlie and then I drove out here and - “Holy shit!”
Castiel grips the mug tighter. “What do you want?”
Castiel 's smile is blinding when Dean, feeling loose and a little horny. He hooks his foot around Castiel's leg.
Once Cas has got him boxed in, it’s the alleyway all over again - except it’s not, because this time it’s not Cas’s fist that’s attacking him but his mouth. It's hot and aggressive, more biting than kissing and Dean groans into it. He pulls hard on Cas's hair because this is what he needs, not love or apologies but something rough and angry and painful because how dare this asshole make Dean hate him and love him at the same time. How dare he want to take care of Dean and break his heart like it’s a reasonable thing to do. Hell, he tells Cas as much while he bites and licks at Cas’s neck, too fucked off to care anymore about hiding his feelings.
"Stop teasing your brother Dean." Cas scolds, handing Dean a cup of coffee and kissing Deans cheek. His eyes sparkling with mischief as Sam makes another long-suffering sound.
"Yeah, usually but I wanted to talk to you?" Dean says, steeling his resolve and wiping his hands against his jeans.
Dean groans pushing at his glasses. "No c'mon man you're being weird."
“Yeah no shit, if you hadn’t pulled a disappearing act I wouldn’t have ever stepped foot in the Boston museum.”
“Why not? Isn't she a sheriff?”
"Shut up and fuck me, Winchester," Castiel says, his eyes sparkling. Dean smiles as Castiel reaches into the dresser and passes Dean some lube. He spread his legs as Dean coats his fingers with the stuff. Dean wants to compliment him back. He wants to tell Castiel how beautiful he is. But he's afraid that if he opens his mouth all of his feelings will come out.
Castiel rolls his eyes and straightens. For all her faults Castiel doesn't know what he would have done without this woman in his life. "Take care of yourself." He says strutting over to the car. Allowing the heels to lengthen his gait.
Dean shrugs, grabbing his jeans from the floor.
Dean raises an eyebrow because, for Cas, weird is his neutral setting. "Weird how?"
“She only turned 18 last week, I don't get why we’re rushing the ceremony,” Dean says as his feathers rise defensively.
"Cas -" Dean says breathlessly. "It's only been a week."
Dean bites his lip. “Promise me you won't touch the ring,” he says seriously. Castiel skims his hand down Dean's other leg, shaking his head. He has no idea why he expected Dean to say something else.
Cas chuckles again.
“No! Dean stops being paranoid about this.”
The first few weeks after Claire became his charge, she had been brutal, even for a ten-year-old. Her remarks were cutting, her tongue barbed. Dean tried to be nice at first, understanding — a rookie mistake on his part. He didn’t earn Claire’s respect until the day he called her an angsty Hannah Montana. Now sarcasm is as affectionate as a hug between them.
“You’re so good for me, Dean,” Cas says, placing a steadying hand on his thigh. Dean moans, unsure whether it's from the words or the stretch. “So fucking good,” Cas groans, wrapping his hand around Dean’s dick.
Dean whines at the burn when he inserts his third finger. He stretches himself wide, trying and failing to find his prostate from this position. “Cas, I need you in me,” he whines, pumping his fingers in harder.
"They were crying. Besides, I wore gloves and I bathed them outside before bringing them in here."
Castiel winces, taking a much smaller sip of his champagne and bites the strawberry. He doesn’t have the heart to tell Dean he still hates the stuff. Besides alcohol is alcohol. “What about your boyfriend?”
Castiel pinches his fingers together, "A bit." He says, laughing when Meg hits his shoulder.
He avoids the dozens of war exhibits. Trying to figure out where Hardgate would fit in amongst the signposts. "Where am I headed?" Dean whispers into the earpiece Charlie had given him.
Charlie shrugs. “Well, Dean you kind of hate Demons.”
"Money," Bela’s says, she’s enjoying shocking him, disgusting him with her trauma. She probably doesn't want pity. Garth probably was scared shitless of her. For some reason, it only makes Dean empathise with more. "Alistair sold his soul just after we moved to the US. So his business would boom."
Dean sighs and rubs at his jaw. Downstairs Crowley is throwing a celebration that Jay Gatsby would be proud of. The alcohol is flowing freely. Ladies are laughing while men smoke Cuban cigars and Dean is hiding in the office and fighting with his girlfriend. His whole life feels like it's been in an office these days. It makes sense that this conversation would happen here as well.
“So can really good sex.”
"Cas- you mean you've been spending the snowstorm in Cas's place?" Sam says his tone taking an abrupt change in direction. Dean swallows heavily, knowing Sam can read his silence better than most. "Oh my god, you slept with him."
Dean reaches out and grabs his shoulder. "Castiel wait," He says pulling Castiel in. His eyes are so fucking blue. "We should make a new deal."
“How my baby brother wound up dating Kansas’s most eligible couple I will never know.” Dean moans not for the first time. It makes no sense. His baby brothers a dork, meanwhile Rowena and Gabriel are legends in the magic community. Yet Sam is walking around like their frigging toy boy.
“Yeah, basically.”
"Cowboys? Really?" Cas asks, walking towards the bed. Dean damn near swallows his tongue. "And here's me thinking you just had an authority kink."
“Actually, you don't have to,” Rowena says, looking down at her mug. “At least not the whole truth anyway. A truth spell as weak as the one in courtrooms can’t force you to be completely honest.”
"Yeah well, what if I go over there and wake him up and the empty doesn't let you leave? What if I never see you again?"
"No Dean I can't give up on him," Cas says, a frown forming in his brow.
"There's a virus," Dean says slowly. He can't quite get his head around the fact Castiel is claiming to have created the world. But he can at least attempt to pay him back for his existence by answering the dude's questions. "It's spreading pretty quickly, a lot of people are dead. So we're trying to stop the spread by quarantining."
“Yeah, but I could talk to Hannah for you. It's a magic misuse thing, that makes it a Guardian case by law, not a Zanna thing.” Charlie says, “Besides, everyone knows you’re the best when it comes to damaged teens.”
Dean laughs, leaning his forehead against Castiel’s horns. "Looks like we're going to have to seal it the old-fashioned way."
“Good plan,” Castiel says, finishing the bruise. Turning off the shower, he mourns the loss of Dean's hand around his cock when he lets them both go. Climbing out, Dean heads towards the bedroom, Castiel following him, admiring his ass along the way. Dean looks over his shoulder and smiles.
“Dammit, I said it might come after you again. Might.” Dean mutters, scrubbing his hand over his jaw. Castiel glares at him. “Okay fine, fine you can come. Stop it with the murder eyes geez.”
Castiel groans, stroking his hand through Deans hair. "Nicks in jail because of you, excuse me for being happy." He says, laughing softly.
"So, what you thought you'd summon some mystical entity to come to help you out. What the fuck man?"
"Night Dean," Sam says
“Wind fucks up umbrellas, Dean. We’re on a cliff.”
Dean's arm starts to burn, it's not a compulsion level of pain - not yet anyway. But it's a warning of what could be next if he keeps ignoring Castiel’s demands. Castiel seemed so appalled when Dean had mentioned these methods in their negotiation. Now, look at him. Dean never should have never given him the benefit of the doubt.
"Sorry Dean, come in, come in," Charlie says once she reaches the bottom. Her red hair in disarray. Her brown horns are visible. Long and curling past her chin. Dean doesn't know if it's intentional, or if she forgot to place a glamour on them. All warlocks have something that marks their otherness, but Cas has always hidden his. It's strange to see the ram-like appendages on Charlie's forehead, but they suit her somehow.
“Yes Dean, I do!” Cas shouts sounding pained. Like he’s the one being left behind.
Crowley frowns, "But Jack isn't just any angel, is he? How can he be expected to be a leading voice for the angelic community when he is cut off from it?"
"I thought Soviets were supposed to be quiet -“ Dean gasps, sinking down on Castiel’s enormous cock. “Stoic - even." Castiel lets out a very un-stoic moan, gripping Deans hips. Dean grins, at the blissed-out look that crosses Castiel’s face. He may still be able to win this thing, even if it feels like he’s being split in half.
Dean blinks, looking Cas over with new knowledge. "Is that why you've been holding back so much."
"I thought maybe if I gave it my grace, the Empty could hold up its end of the deal and I could get Jack back again." Cas sighs, clutching the bottle of his grace tightly. "I thought maybe with Jack back we could save the world."
Out of habit, Dean decides to walk Cerberus hoping the fresh air will clear his head. Castiel confuses the fuck out of him sometimes. Dean doesn't know how to explain how they went from enemies to friends to what lovers? Fuck buddies? It's all so mixed up. Dean has no clue why the fell into bed together in the first place. Sure there's been some sexual tension, but Castiel doesn't like Dean like that, right? Maybe that's why he left?
“Yeah, it was,” Dean sighs, sitting on the bus bench. “Actually, that's why I was calling you.”
“Yes, luckily all I needed was some time in the infirmary. Anyway, Eileen felt bad so she came to visit me - and while she was there, Sam landed, and proceeded to ignore me in order to tell Eileen that she was a fantastic player.”
“I know, but your invention is up there now, Dean. That's insane. I mean, when I used to come home and see you tinkering all the time, I never thought it’d lead to something as cool as space travel. I just thought it’d mean I’d get more cool toys from you for the rest of my life. I’m proud of you, man.”
“I know,” Castiel says still petting his mutt. “But there's no fun in that.”
Castiel grins innocently, “Where?”
“Oh,” Castiel mutters focusing on digging instead. He had been so sure Dean had been flirting back but he never really considered it was a ploy.
"Dean I know Dads death hit you hard. I didn’t want to tell you how to handle your grief, but I've never hated demons the way you did. I'm just happy you're getting over it."
Castiel smirks. “So are you gonna tell me what your name really is?”
Cas sighs, gently lowering Baby to the ground. Clearly aware of how much Dean would have chewed him out if he dropped her. He steps into Dean’s space again, tilting his head to the side. "Even you are not this obtuse. No one is this obtuse."
Castiel chuckles and leans against the countertop. His elegant fingers working on his shirt buttons. Dean tells himself that his staring is a fearsome glare. Even as he licks his lips at the gesture.
"A long time ago, I breathed life into your lungs," Cas says, kissing along Deans chest. "I gathered all the infinite parts of the universe that made you a man and I melded them together. Atom by atom. Then I cradled your soul and lowered it into your skin. I felt you come alive under my hands and since then I only ever ached to touch you."
"Before this weekend I never knew you worked in construction never mind that you were good at it." Cas says, softly the cold winter air adding a flush to his cheeks.
"Dean -" Cas gasps gripping Deans forearm. Dean presses harder against his jaw. Forcing Cas to meet his gaze. To see how honest Deans being right now.
“I was either this or missing the launch, Charlie.”
"That's because it doesn't make fucking sense!" Dean yells so fucking mad at himself it hurts. "I knew you wouldn't kill Belphegor if you didn't have a good reason. I know you were just doing your best but every time I looked at you all I could see was Chuck. All I could think was that everything was a lie. That my whole life was a fucking lie. I mean there was no way you were on my side. There was no way an angel would do what you did for me. There was no way... No fucking way you could have loved me." Dean sobs out that last part, feeling like it's been torn from his very soul.
"We are friends -" Dean says ignoring the way his ears are burning. "Mostly anyway."
"I'll look at Rowena's for something to do with them too Dean. But it might just be the weather."
“I mentor kids for a living Cas, that was only like, mild cheddar compared to some of my other lines.”
Dean packs a bag, trying not to panic. It's a fifteen-hour drive from Chicago to Boston and he doesn't even blink at driving it. He'd do anything for Cas. Even if it means driving when the sun is high in the sky. He hits the road in his precious Baby and floors the pedal.
Dean makes a humming noise that Castiel is to distracted to hear. He's never seen his city look so beautiful. "Well I'll give you one thing; it’s got a great view." Castiel says looking over his shoulder at Dean. "I bet during the day you can see the ocean."
Dean laughs bitterly. “Yeah, that's an understatement.”
"A night?"
“Gee Sarah, couldn't I be calling you about something else?”
The world doesn't end, but it feels like it has anyway. Dean kneels, the wet grass below him is impossibly green and stained with his blood. He picks up the rings, grips them tight enough they bite at his palm. The ache of his face doesn't even come close to ache in his heart. For the first time in his life, he’s well and truly alone.
“You're trying to be a frat boy?” Castiel asks, trying and failing to picture it.
Cas blinks in surprise. "You want to hear my plan?"
“An old ring,” Nancy says, leaving Castiel’s head spinning. “It's not worth much, though. Jody figured the thief thought it was worth more because they left without taking anything else. She should be back in twenty minutes or so.”
"Okay," Dean sighs, swallowing his disappointment. Because as upsetting as this is, Castiel is just trying to protect a kid. Dean can understand that. “It won't happen again Cas."
Eileen laughs. “Everyone has a thing for Rowena,” she says reassuringly, and Cas surprisingly nods in agreement.
Cas's eyes sparkle. He's practically beaming at Dean as his tail swirls around his shoulders. “No further questions your Grace."
Cas bites his lip looking down at where his brand used to be. "Would it be such a bad thing if I was?"
“I appreciate it, Dean. I do, but I’m not the kind of person that lets someone put themselves in harm's way for me.”
“No Dean," Sam shakes his head, lowering his voice. "I always thought you and Cas were close alright, but now
Nick narrows her eyes, "You're fucking her, aren't you? That’s why you testified. Crowley couldn't work it out."
Dean really likes it when Cas grins. So he leans out off the window, getting nice and close to whisper in Cas’s ear. "Are you saying you don't want me to blow you to get out of that ticket?”
“With the cases, I’ve seen you would be too,” Dean says his wings flaring, golden and agitated.
Dean's car, Castiel learns is a 1967 Chevrolet Impala making it undeniably a thing of beauty. It is also an object Dean can and will talk about endlessly in the ten minutes it takes to drive to the strip mall parking lot Dean hid “her” in. Castiel mostly listens to Dean's awe-filled monologue, nodding in the right places and watching as Dean's leg bounces in the footwell. Castiel can't tell if this excitement comes from the anticipation of the hunt, or his need to be behind the wheel again.
