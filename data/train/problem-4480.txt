“What? Didn’t you say they were like family?”
"If anyone that isn't me comes in you stab the fuck out of them." Dean gave him a small nod and closed his eyes, completely exhausted and so relives to ride that awful heat.
"I- yeah."
"Not everyone in my family is an alpha. My, my brother Gabriel is an omega. My parents exclude him from all family affairs. No one outside our family really knows about him. He can only leave the house with two or more alphas. And my fuckup of brothers got wasted and ditched him in this seedy city one night. He- he was raped, he conceived. My parents wanted him to abort it but my sister Anna, Samandriel, and I stood by him. She's five now and I love her so much. But that doesn't mean what was done to him is acceptable. It's sick and you would know that about me if you didn't judge the second you met me."
"I'm sorry what? You didn’t tell me? Me of all people? I would be your lieutenant if you waged war! How could you not tell me?" Rachel's blue eyes were wide and he could see the smudge of brown eyeliner and pink shadow under her eye. “Who is he, and isn’t this a little random? I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen you show much interest in others like that. Have you ever dated before?”
“Maybe I will.” he replied
“Oh, Dean-o I don’t judge.”
"Okay, babe." Castiel spread his legs and tiled his and Dean's body to the side and into a spooning position. Dean let out out a blissful sigh and he moved his legs trying to gain feeling again.
“Back off, Cas!” Dean snarled and shoved through the door into the main square of campus. Pausing a moment he watched Dean walk off to who knows where. Castiel wanted to follow him, his instincts screamed to follow his distressed mate but the logical part of his brain said to leave him alone. That’s what Dean needed, obviously something during the class bothered him. Castiel could only stand by and watch Dean walk off, and there wasn’t a single thing he could do about it.
It was only twenty minutes after Cas left that Dean felt antsy. He opted for a shower in hopes of settling down. As good as the hot water and smooth soap felt on his skin he still felt odd. He had the urge to talk, but not with Cas. Like he had something important to say but he had no idea what it was. Something he couldn’t say to Castiel, or maybe it was about Castiel. He wanted to know something about alphas, maybe even Cas.
With a yelp, he smacked Dean's arm to focus his attention on the sink.
Dean turned around to look at Jo and then to Castiel standing with wide eyes in the bathroom doorway.
"It just felt so stereotypical and I'm just not like that I guess. Some small part of me liked it but the rest I don't know it made me feel dirty. Like I was acting just like my dad told me I would. Just someone's bitch." The last words tasted like bile in his mouth Cas let out a soft but clearly possessive growl.
“I think so, it is still rather early in the year.” Castiel knew what a horrible idea this was, the longer the wait the stronger the bond.
"I love you, Dean Winchester."
“Good.”
Dean was bare foot stomping around campus in cotton thin night clothes. Clenching and unclenching his fits he was taking deep breaths. The campus was dead, even the alphas roughhousing in his dorm settled down. The ground was so damn cold on his feet and he had no idea what to do, he had no other place to go other than his dorm. He wasn’t sure why he snapped at Cas, he wasn’t mad at Cas...was he?
The room was left silent and Castiel was on edge over Dean's outburst. John mumbled illegible words to himself as he grabbed his keys and slammed the door.
"No, I think he's looking for a new place now." Castiel spoke with a distant voice as he curled his fingers around the hairs that lay flat on Dean’s neck.
“He smells like honey, like what the hell man? Oh and did I mention he’s a fucking Novak?” The line went dead, Jo was obviously shocked or calculating a plan.
"This is more for convenience so your shirt doesn't stick to your back. You should be healed up by tomorrow since it barely broke skin." Patching over his raw skin he smoothed it out softly. Pleased with his work Castiel leaned in and placed a gentle kiss in the center of Dean's aching shoulder blades.
"We have been friends for a very long time, John and Bobby even longer, so it has been like this long before the kids were around." Mary’s smile only grew, “really we all knew each other from growing up but it was John and Bobby who officially brought us together.”
Explaining the past few months to Jo was a challenge with her constant commentary but they managed, thankfully she and Cas really hit it off and their alpha drives didn’t clash, they both had Dean as a priority in their minds.
"No, he's my mate." Castiel couldn't look her in the eye as he spoke.
"Cas, may I touch you?" A huff of breath that completely deflated the alpha followed.
As a last-ditch effort Dean pulled his pants down around his mid-thigh and pulled himself free from his boxers. He started off slow, rubbing his callused thumb over the his head, dipping back to drag across the sensitive crown. Dean bit down on his lip as he worked himself faster, panting and mumbling for Castiel.
“Ah look who came home, and you brought a friend!” He said enthusiastically  moving Beckett to sit on his hip and held out his hand for Dean. He took it without hesitation and gave him a firm handshake and a nod, he then moved onto Cas gave him a half a hug and a slight kiss on his cheek. Lastly he moved to his mate, sitting beside him he tangled his fingers in the hair at the nap of gabriels golden blond hair and placed a slow warm kiss on his lips.
Dean hated finals, then again who didn’t, it took up weeks of studying time that they could use towards learning something! But no that threw them to the sharks and tested them on the most unimportant things. That's what pushed Dean to the library at nearly eleven at night. Castiel was not a fan of the idea, but that didn’t matter because he planned on passing his tests and getting his ass out of there with Castiel behind him.
“You hated the guy! You wanted to switch rooms with him and now you’re fucking?” Her eyes were wide with so many questions that Dean knew he would have to answer. Castiel was just a bystander and enjoyed the exchange of conversation between Dean’s dearest friend.
"No, stay with me. I miss you, Dean." Dean had to hold back the feeling of sadness that shot through him with Castiel's words. Even though he was sure he could sense the change in him.
"No I do, so when you do get home you can find a nice spot on the sofa because I can't talk to you right now." With that, she hung up forcefully and took a deep calming breath before she faced Dean.
See 'ya then!
But he wasn't going to burn the house down, he would play nice and fuck his father over later.
“Why would you do that? We haven’t spoken in years.” Dean almost smiled at how clueless his mate could be.
“Nice to see ya’, blue eyes.” She nodded at Cas, remembering how they first met. He was confused, naked, and stunk of sex.
*      *      *
"So who won?" Castiel asked as he declared himself the winner of the game.
“Your cycle? What about my damn rut? That is pure abuse of the knot.” Castiel joked.
"And that would be?"
I'm so sorry if there are typos Emilie is MIA! She wasn't in school and I couldn't reach her so if needed we will go back in and edit some more.
“Well why not tell me a little about her and I could help.” Castiel thought for a few seconds a smiled.
“Yeah like genetic lottery winners, Novak.”
"What did he do to you?" Castiel touched Dean’s bruised neck and bloody shoulder gingerly. Anger boiled under his skin but he had to keep his cool, for Dean. Looking over Deans body Castiel make quick work of his shirt. His shoulder stopped bleeding and so did his hand. Pulling the shirt over Deans head carefully, not wanting to hurt him further.
"Dean I would love to meet your family."
"What? No.” Dean covered quickly “Besides I wouldn't ask. I'd just do it." Castiel laughed, would he care if Dean marked him? He should, Dean can't be his real mate he's well, Castiel knows there is a reason why he just can't think of it now.
Leaning back into bed Castiel tried to run through exactly what just happened.
"What wrong buddy? Can't satisfy your bitch? Heh, I wouldn't mind lending a knot." Castiel felt rage bubble under his skin, nails and teeth sharpening and eyes turning a dark gold. He bolted at the first son of a bitch he saw. Slamming them into the wall on the other side of the hall. A snarl ripped from his throat and baring his teeth he dug his nails into the other alpha.
“Well look at you, one hell of a specimen.” Alton undid one button of his gray suit and slightly bent over to get a closer look at Dean. Dean gave him a nasty glare and wished he could punch the man right in his nose. “Wonderful job Crowley, where did you find him?” Crowley smiled and moved closer.
"Don't strain yourself we have your new Alpha coming soon" Crowley gave him a smile and headed back upstairs. finally, Dean snarled and it echoed off the walls as he worked on breaking his restraints. He worked his wrists, but all he got was rope burn and rust in his hair. He would need time to think and he hoped he was close enough for Cas the sense him.
The old mint green bathroom is empty and he shoots for the stall. Clutching the bowl he feels like his whole stomach is going to come up. All he manages is a few dry heaves and he falls back against the stall doors. Hands shaking as his skin is devoured in flames from the inside out. He is panting and unlocks the door lifting himself up and fumbling towards the sink to splash cold water on his face. He white knuckles the rim of the sink and looks at his reflection. His cheeks are flushed and pupils blown out. He felt like he was dying and there was nothing he could do about it. Not until he leans his hips into the cool porcelain sink and a moan escapes his lips. His cock is throbbing and for the second time today he can feel the slick wetting his underwear. His mind is running a thousand miles but he can't manage a single thought. His breathing is picking up as panic sets in, he's caught out in public with this horrible sickness or whatever is making him like this. Almost like heat, but that can be possible he's on suppressants and has never experienced it himself. He's just sick that's all. The bathroom door opens and the two men who were talking freeze and sniff the air. A guttural growl slips from there chest and it sends Dean into fight or flight. And he chooses flight.
It was never the same scenario, tied to a chair, chained to a wall, stuck in a box. It lead to nightmares, ones that woke him up screaming in a cold sweat.
"Wait, what?" Dean attempted to look over his shoulder but failed and scurried into the bathroom.
"Holy shit, Cas." Dean was in awe from the shaggy gray rug on the floor to the amazing sound system built into his wall. It was so odd to see this side of Cas. Like he was trying to make his mark on his parents design.
Even after leaving the library he was still watching everyone around him, people stayed a few steps away and he knew it was because his anxiety rolled off of him in waves of bitter apples. Dean prided himself on being a strong independent person but he needed Cas, he needed comfort just like his mother provided him when he was little. That was what mates were for. It didn't make Den weak, it meant Dean was loved and that was an odd feeling for him.
That's what he was in this position, bent over and begging. Castiel wasn't his mate, hell they weren't even supposed to be having sex out of cycle. But that rule was screwed to hell almost as fast as it was made. This sex was different, Dean didn't know if he liked it...it wasn't as good as the other kind but a part if him that was pushed deep down was singing with joy. Dean ground his teeth together, he was in an omegas body but he had the mind of an alpha and he won't be bent over.
"You know I never realize just how old you look"
"So is he kinky?" Rachel asked elbowing Castiel's side and wiggling her eyebrows.
Dean pulled a three point turn in their excessively large driveway and started the long wind down the road. The sound of the impala was a small comfort to Dean but the smell of distress still floated around his nose. Dean had replayed the past few days over in his head over a hundred times and he still has no idea what he did to hurt Castiel so badly.
This was an odd chapter and it had two big events in it so I hopefully it didn't feels rushed or anything because this is the beginning of part two and I think you guys can guess what this part will be centered around... Family.
"Oh, okay." Dean finally stood up, it was getting really cold out and laying naked on the floor in a half assed heated dorm didn't feel too great. Turning to walk to his dresser he moved awkwardly trying to not move his back.
"That sounds great. There is only one problem."
"I guess I'm just, I don't know I know Sam won't be upset but what if he tells my dad?"
"I smell an omega who isn't being fucked. Open the door and I can fix that for you." A low growl came from Castiel's chest.
"So, you want to have a little fun?" Dean growled pushing Cas harder into the wall and exposed his neck to Dean who was bearing his teeth at Castiel's pulse point.
"I'm going out, you have until the time I come back to escape. If you fail you run an extra eight miles tomorrow. Got it?" Dean laughed in his mind. Didn't matter if he did get out, hell he could get out in three seconds flat and he would still have to do those eight miles.
"Yeah, I know. But I'll have to face him sometime. Might as well be over spring break."
"Who made you come here?"
Once Castiel's knot went down they moved into more comfortable positions, they pulled off their wet clothes and changed.
"What! The hell are you up to, Winchester?"
Dean straddle Castiel’s hips and pushed their dick’s together, wraping his fingers around them he slowly dragged forward. Sliding over the crown of Castiel’s cock, he let out a low growl and captured Dean’s lips. They exchanged small whimpers and moans as Dean dragged his thumb over their heads.
"You gonna make your omega wait?" And at that Castiel dove in. Aligning himself and sliding in. Yes he was absolutely correct. Dean didn't need an ounce of lube. Once he bottomed out he stopped waiting for Deans signal. It felt like an eternity with Dean wrapped around his cock, his slick covered walls that clenched desperately around him. Sweat gathered on his brow, he had never felt such an amazing feeling before.
"You mated, Cassie!? Why am I just finding out now?"
“How about we just stay down here for the rest of the day. Have dinner with Beckett.” Castiel looked around Dean and smiled at his niece. “Then” He said moving close to Dean’s ear, but not lowering his voice nearly enough “we can go upstairs to bed and I’ll give you a big-”
"I guess I'll have to use yours," Castiel spoke slowly as he continued to scan the small counter. "If you don't mind."
“Come lay with me.” The omega whispered as he clung to consciousness. Castiel smiled and nodded as he maneuvered himself over Dean and put himself between him and the wall to avoid his bad shoulder. He moved Dean’s hand and nuzzled into the omegas soft neck and and gently scented him to rid the smell of Alistair. Pulling the covers over he snuggled tight against Dean’s side.
“Jo?” Dean’s voice slightly broke as he saw the fire in her eyes and she shoves past him. Everyone but her was naked but that didn’t seem to bother her.
“What does it mean, it’s weird.”
“How would you know you’ve been in bed all morning.” Castiel turned towards Dean and leaned back against his desk.
“My god Castiel you- you
"He told me all the time, not like other wolves Dean. G-go sit down." Dean tried to speak clearly but he was slurring some of his words and the emotional state he was in didn't help. Castiel lifted himself off the floor and stood directly in front of Dean.
"Better?" He asked.
“Nothing! I-I was trying to wake you up.” He said not looking Dean in the eye Dean rolled over rubbing his eyes. “I was wondering if-” Dean stretched and moaned loudly. Cas smirked “You tired or something, babe?”
“I’m not, I bet I could easily beat you if I used my alpha traits.” Their chest were still moving rapidly and they had no idea how long they were actually fighting for.
“Seriously, what the hell is a chick flick moment?” Castiel whispered in Dean’s ear, pointing at the paper discreetly sitting in his lap.
"I don't think you do, you have been promising Dean you would play with him for a week now. How many times have you said you would have him help with the impala. He will only believe you for so long, he needs a father present in his life."
4) This chapter has a very important meaning behind it. Many times in A/B/O stories it is the omega who has been assaulted. This time it was a strong willed alpha. It just shows no matter who you are rape can happen to anyone and people feel they can't tell anyone because of it. They feel they should of had power to stop it or 'being an alpha you must have liked it' This was a major twist on a very used story line so I hope you all saw my underlying fuck you to society.
“Maybe we should have a national kink week, you know...for science.” Castiel gave an approving purr and nipped at Dean’s jaw.
Dean started pacing and walked into the bathroom, he always had to be alone for important phone calls so Castiel let him be.
"Cas, we are like so fucked. I-I holy fuck." Dean was babbling like mad and Castiel couldn't follow for the life of him.
“Investment? Do you even know what I’m doing with my life? When was the last time you asked me what I wanted, that’s right never! I am not like your other sons, I don’t have Dean on his knees following me around. He has his own future and dreams and I’m not here to build this massive pack. I don’t care if you want our packs to be bound together or whatever. I have nothing against having a multi-partner pack but that isn’t what Dean and I have.” Dean’s eyes never lost Castiel’s face, taking in every word he said. “Please, I’m asking you now to stop and just let Dean and I be.” Castiel let out a deep breath and looked at his mother, his eyes almost begging her.
Castiel worked Dean’s cock until it was standing at full attention. Dean leaned back into the wall and let the water hit his side as he gave in to Castiel. Dean ran his fingers through Castiel's hair, tugging at it slightly with every moan he made. Dean’s eyes closed and Cas moved in to place kisses along his jaw and neck. Paying special attention to the areas that were damaged by Alistair. Leaving small love bites across his collarbone he sped up his wrist, pumping harder. He loved the feel of Dean’s cock in his hand, he was larger than most omegas but Dean really wasn’t like any other omega he’s met. He was more muscular and gruff, intimidating. And Castiel loved soaping his hand up and stroking Dean, he loved feeling every bump and vein on his cock. How smooth his head felt under his thumb and how red the tip got when he was desperate to come. It’s why Castiel always persuades Dean to join him in the shower. Because even if they were only half mates he was going to tend to every need Dean could ever have before Dean knew he needed it.
"You mean trans fats? MSG maybe, or how about just basic salt."
be safe." Dean tried to stop himself from turning radish red and Castiel lifted his hand to scan over Dean's face.
Dean pushed his hips further and bumped Castiel’s chin. Accepting his plea Cas took one hand from Dean’s side and circled the base of his cock. He gave Dean a few loose strokes and brought him to his lips. Dean expected a slow warm entrance but was shocked when Castiel placed his head on the flat of his tongue and placed both hands back on his hips.
Grabbing his laptop off the bedside table he flipped it open. Googling Topeka Kansas housing brought him to a long page of offerings. Many were labeled under 'fixer-upper' or 'needs some TLC' and even he knew that means it was a stack of wood in the shape of a square.
It wasn't right for Cas to keep him like this.
"No like,” he sighed “you know what? Fuck it," Dean had no idea what he thought he could get from this, he couldn't just say he is in some fucked up situation and he is now entering this odd relationship of telling him about his fucked up past. "I told him shit, Jo."
"Dean, who care what he-" but again he was cut off.
"Mary, what's wrong?" John rubbed his eyes and say up, he was wearing his clothes from yesterday after coming back a little after the boys left.
"She did." He said barely audibly.
“I’m okay, Dean.” He assured, but Dean wasn’t having it.
“A way to a man’s heart is his stomach.” and his cervix Castiel added mentally and let out and snickered.
"Mornin'." Dean smiled at Castiel and put down a coffee in front of him.
Castiel pressed his fingertips into Dean’s side as he helped lift him. Dean leaned forward to rest his forehead on Castiel’s strong shoulder. Huffs of hot breath curled up Castiel’s neck and sent chills down his side, move Dean faster in his lap. Castiel slid his hands from Dean’s hips to wrap his fingers around his aching cock that was dragging precome across Castiel’s stomach.
But that was his life, it made him stronger. He tried to tell himself even if he was an alpha his father would do the same but he wouldn't. This was defense training, escaping, running. Not offense, attacking, dominating.
“Oh Clarence, just relax. No need to bother mommy dearest.” Cas looked like he might vomit. He refused to look at her. His body tensed visibly, and with a stony-face he stared at the wall behind Dean.
"Okay, Dean."
“Yeah, I mean, unless you want to add something?” Cas shook his head.
“Cas, I’m not pregnant.” He said with a  soft laugh as he stroked a hand through Castiel’s bedridden hair. It took a few minutes of Castiel just resting on Dean’s stomach to fully wake up. Not that it was possible for either of them to know so soon if he was pregnant but he was on birth control and wasn’t in heat so it was technically impossible.
Castiel sped up the pace, pulling out just to his head and then slamming back in. Each time eliciting a hiccup of pleasure from Deans lips.
"Mhm, roller skates or in-line?" He asked.
"I'm going to go take a shower, okay?" Cas called from the bathroom door.
"Does he plan to stay here forever?" Dean looked around the kitchen look like it was made from the leftover material from the main kitchen. A large L-shaped sofa curled around a tv and toys littered the floor.
“Yeah, course.” He said not taking his eyes off of Cas.
"What?" Castiel growled slightly.
Scenarios on what to do ran through his mind, unmate? Not only would that psychologically scar Cas but it would also damage Dean too. They were stuck between a rock and a hard place and it seemed there is no way out. The decision was ultimately left to Dean, Castiel was the one who got them into this.
"What happened!" Mary called to John bags still gripped in her hand.
No. He was mad at his father, himself and every person that lead to this damn stereotype of omegas being sex toys. Unable to hold high up rankings because apparently his heat would make him some mindless sex addict who  would ask anyone to bend him over.
“I told you to slow down.” Dean let out a snarl and threw open his door and stumbled into the downpour outside. He walked around the front of the car to inspect the damage done to the tire. He was out of the car for less than a minute and was already drenched. He kneeled down next to the tire, blown out. He had to get the jack out of his car and thankfully it doesn't look like any other damage was done. He must have hit a pothole at a bad angle.
“That doughy eyed staring thing all these schmucks are doing, matching tattoos. Bullshit mating meanings, just all that fluffy love shit is not gonna cut it with me.” Castiel tried to hold back a laugh.
“Dean-” Dean turned to Castiel he was sitting up with his knees to his chest covering his face with his hands. Dean dropped everything and bounded back for the bed. He took Castiel’s hands from his eyes. He was crying.
"Who ya talkin to, Cas?" Dean asked mouthing at his ear and neck.
I'm alive!
"I mean, only tell them if they ask and really how many times do you talk with them? And I really don't think they're going to care. All too busy planning Michael's wedding." Samandriel looked unsatisfied with Castiel's answer but nodded anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for

"Now focus Cas, no daydreaming. With all guns, there is a kickback and it might seem huge to you but this is a nice beginner's gun and you have a nice stance." Castiel took a breath.
He walked down the hallway slowly wondering what state Dean would be in. Stopping outside of the door he took a sniff of the air, he was agitated, distressed, and drunk. Castiel opened the door and saw Dean sitting in the edge of his bed, head hung and elbows on his knees.
"Can't any of you fuck faces read a scent marking. Back. The. Fuck. Off!" Castiel snapped.
Thankfully he was on birth control and conceiving in your first heat is very rare, but not impossible. Dean would just have to remember to count the weeks between his cycle, memories his patter to better equip himself.  God knows that last thing Dean needs is an illegitimate pup with a stranger.
"Um, sure I can. What do you want to know?"
“Yeah, I guess. So what? We put off the search for now?” Dean questioned.
Keep control
"Well I have to say I'm happy they didn't become mates, you fit right in here Cas. We are very happy to have you join our family." Both Castiel and Dean smiled and inched slightly closer. “Maybe it was fate to find your true pack, either way, we are happy you will be the one to be with Dean when we aren’t.”
He checked his watch, thirty more seconds. He didn’t dare look at the half dozen tests on the counter. Instead, he sat down on the toilet and started to hum “Hey Jude”. He could hear Castiel pacing and even smell his distress from outside but Dean couldn’t seem to find his voice to call him in. He waited, and waited, looking at the timer on his phone click down the seconds until finally, it was time.
Castiel stuck his key in and they quickly stripped down and threw on T-shirts and sweatpants. Dean subconsciously joined Castiel on the left side of them room, Castiel welcomed him by lifting the covers. Dean slid easily into Cas’ bed, sighing contentedly, and curling up next to him.
“A big tickle!” He tickled her belly making her tumble back into her daddy’s arms laughing and shouting.
“Dean?” Cas’ voice snapped him from his mind, he realized how tense he had gotten.
Castiel still had the sinking feeling Dean was taking steps backward, building up his wall and locking him out. It was something Castiel wasn't going to let happen.
I feel gross just typing that up
"No I've got an hour."
"You fuck face get off me!" Turning his head he sunk his teeth into the alphas hand and pulled.
Dean brought his arms up to wrap around Castiel's neck and guide him up to his lips. It was a lazy effortless kiss. It wasn't hot and heavy, just their lips moving into the perfect rhythm and arms and legs winding around each other. They created a safe cocoon and continued to kiss until the haze of alcohol knocked Dean out.
"Few hours, wanted to get there early and they are about three hours north."
"I've always wondered what in hell that was about. To train Dean, he was always so damn tired from school and all those hours. Never felt like I got the whole story behind it."
“So good alpha.” Dean hummed between kisses. “So so good.” Castiel loved after sex Dean, he was cuddly, affectionate, and loved to praise Castiel. Cas washed himself quickly and exited the shower with Dean. The both toweled down and threw on their pajamas. Castiel was still hard but he never pushed himself on Dean.
"What do you mean?"
“Alright I know I’m new but you guys have shit ideas, I vote coffee,” Castiel spoke up again after Adam had three other ideas shot down from Sam and Dean. Dean laughed, “I vote coffee.” He said raising a hand.” Yeah, I could use a pick me up.” Sam agreed. They didn’t even wait for Adam’s response.
lier- unless it was towards his mother. She could melt the truth out of him with a smile and a 'mmhmm you sure?'
"You want me to talk about it? You want me to say how I was this seventeen year old alpha boy who got tangled up with this sadistic beta woman! You want me to talk about my past because its done. It's all fucking done so drop it."
“Skip my usual Dean, I’ll have what they are having.” The two younger Winchester boy’ whooped in excitement and Dean looked as if his mate had betrayed him.
"Yeah, Crowley."
"I will punch you in the dick." Dean threatened.
“Ow FUCK Dean!” Castiel shouted grabbing his dick. Dean scrambled across the floor to grab Cas’ phone. He gaped down at it.
"Do anything for him." Castiel gave a fake smiled and felt an odd twist in his stomach at how easy it is to speak of Dean as his mate. The man who obviously hated him just hours ago and then dry humped him. What the fuck is going on? Now Cas was buying sex toys for the man! Odd how life works.
Castiel rolled onto his back and closed his eyes until a shout from Dean disturbed him. He scrambled to sit up and saw Dean storm out of the bathroom pointing at his neck were a perfectly placed mating mark sat.
Castiel let out a moan as he dug deeper, his nose pressing on his perineum that made Dean yelp something beautiful.
even alpha if needed. If you don’t think I can then you've got another thing coming sweetheart."
"Um, well I don't know. I guess I was just in the mood to shoot the shit with my friend."
They made it as far as ten feet from their building until Castiel stopped and patted his pockets.
“No regrets?” Dean smirked, kissing his forehead.
Dean was still moaning, and whispering “Cas, Cas, Cas.” under his breath, eyes squeezed shut from one of the most powerful orgasm he’d ever had.
Dean nodded and crawled back into his bed, burying himself under his red comforter. Castiel watched as Dean closed his eyes, his Dean, his omega, his mate. It was one of the most amazing thoughts Castiel had ever had and he couldn’t wipe off the huge smile on his face.
"Wow, that was just terrible." Castiel stifled a laugh.
"So where is this mate of yours?" Rachel asked pushing past Castiel and looked through their room. "Oh you are fucking kidding me, you have a goddamn bathroom!" Her face was a mix of shock and anger.
"I was a little distracted. Didn't know you liked any other card game except poker."
"I know," Crowley spoke as though he was referring to something else. Dean gave another once over and noticed he was wearing the same thing like he had some uniform where it consisted of black.
"Great, just upped my hours so I'm that much closer!" Alfie smiled and jumped a little, he had been saving up to move out since he presented as a rather omega like alpha. Castiel sees nothing wrong with his brother but his family is another story.
“Hey, Dean you okay? You’re smelling off.”
“Cas, I have to piss.” Dean groaned and tried to pull away again but was quickly pinned to the bed by Castiel who now rolled on top of him and caged Dean between strong arms.
Dean had no interest in attending class today but he really didn't have a choice. He decided a quick call home to his brother would help clear his mind and maybe even help him make a choice.
"Your son is one of the strongest men I have ever encountered." Castiel finally spoke up and caught Mary's attention. "John made an impact on Dean's life but it didn't break his spirit. It only pushed him further to be better, smarter, and stronger." Castiel looked down at his hands, he recalled telling Dean he had the better part of the deal, that Dean had an alpha at his command. That was wrong, Castiel was the real winner here. "Dean Winchester is the most complex, frustrating, and exciting man I know and nothing makes him happier than barring his mark." That line on its own caused a whimper to leave Mary's mouth and a shocking but very welcome hug. He didn't even notice her moving across the room to him but he could feel her tears on his shoulder and knew they were not of sadness.
A small trail of red mixed with bubbles toothpaste trailed down the side of his mouth. With a low growl, Dean grabbed the cup next to the sink and filled it. Handing it to Cas he urged him to rinse and spit.
“What?” Dean asked breaking character.
"Castiel don't talk back to your father!" Naomi snapped.
“Okay, I’ll call in for someone to search the area.” Castiel stepped into the bathroom closed the door. Dean felt trapped, his own body betrayed him and because of that so did his family and even strangers. Castiel was his last lifeline and he was holding on with every last ounce of fleeting strength he had. Castiel emerged from the bathroom and looked over Dean’s limp body.
“Yeah why not, show you around town and all that.” Adam smiled encouragingly at him.
"Dean, you've got the better end of this deal." Dean laughed and Cas ducked out of the shower.
"You woke me up, for sex..." Castiel answered, his words came out slowly and slightly confused. "And I thought you were awake."
"D-Dean?" His voice was slightly cracked and Castiel's face slowly turned red.
"Hello, Beckett." Dean crocked all his thoughts became mush as he looked into Beckett's brilliant eyes. Like scotch in sunlight they glowed a deep gold.
"No that's the weird part, he gave me a book but it was like being in his damn bubble coated me." Dean took a few more fries and dipped them in ketchup. "Apparently he is in one of my classes. I've never seen him before but he had the book I needed so I guess he is."
He was leaned back into Castiel's chest and his head rested on his mates' shoulder. Castiel had his nose buried in Dean's soft hair. They were both half asleep and he responded to his sister with a hum but refused to budge.
"Yeah, well I can take care of myself when it comes to other alphas." Dean huffed, he could have taken in Alistair, really.
"Can you come here, I have something we need to talk about." Castiel felt his throat tighten and eyes burn. This was it, his little fantasy was over and he was going to have to let Dean Winchester go. Trying to keep himself collected Castiel nodded and walked over to sit by Dean.
"So what drove you to call me on such a fine Tuesday afternoon?" Jo chimed, she was taking classes at a local college so she stayed at home.
It was about four in the morning when Dean woke from his orgasm induced slumber and he had a wonderfully warm alpha on top of him...wait, what?
“Your name.”
“Well, I don’t know, you could find someone whose smell doesn’t make you want to puke. Become close and tell them about this. It’s not that crazy of a thought. They would just have to wait until all this was fixed, then-” Castiel hated the words coming out of his mouth, they made him sick.
“Oh no, my god no, Cas.” Dean crawled over to Castiel and cupped his cheek. “Don’t you dare think I don’t love you.” He wanted to tell him everything, he really did, but it was better for everyone to keep the alpha out of Dean’s paranoia.
Finally, the minivan was gone and Dean could pull up. A scruffy older man with wiry beard hair held out the bag for Dean. Taking it he looked inside and back up at the man.
"What?" Castiel whispered as he pushed Dean's sweat-soaked hair back.
Beginning of Part 2
“Really, it looks a lot like you.” Cas looked down and pulled at the bottom of his shirt.
"No," Castiel let out a slightly unhappy growl at that.
“So I hear you passed Jo’s test, that means you’re in!” The larger man clapped him on the back and pulled him further into the room to meet up with Dean who was being showered in kisses by a blonde woman. She had a few gray wisps in her hair but she had Dean's eyes and smelt like his mate. This must be Mary.
“I got no family and no out of heat sex.”
“I will devour you.” Another chill ran down Dean’s spine and before he knew it he flung Castiel around and had him pinned to the wall. Catching Cas’ lips Dean dove into a full-on make-out session in less than a minute. Castiel was more than happy to respond and took a fistful of hair and tugged genitally.
“Well, come to me with those problems. I’m here for you.” Castiel slid his hand up Dean’s thigh until he rested it on his hip and placed a soft kiss on his lips. “School has been crazy for me too, but I always have time to help you wind down, Dean.”  Castiel dropped his forehead onto Dean’s shoulder and just held him there. Dean kissed Castiel’s temple and just took deep soothing breaths to calm himself down.
"Dean?" His mate called as he hit the landing to the steps.
“It, ah, it’s on his…”
“It’s mandatory, Dean. It’s not even that bad I mean, come on, it’s diagrams of your cervix. It could be worse.” Dean switched his focus back to the beta in the front of the room. She had short curly brown hair that bounced with every step. She was a little too excited over her job and loved to hear herself talk. She had a long ass powerpoint describing every inch of Dean’s reproductive organs and a few on an alphas knot. Dean just wanted to ditch, he had test to makeup due to his heat and one hell of a headache. “Just watch the presentation.”
"Just ask him not to tell your parents. I'm sure he would respect your wishes." Dean nodded and sat down on his bed.
Snapping his head up he saw Crowley standing in the doorway and nothing but fury registered in Castiel’s brain. Standing up from his position on top of the groaning man Castiel started towards the beta who just stood there and smiled.
"And what is that?" Castiel leaned over Dean.
“You made the bed now lay in it, little alpha.” Dean chuckled and flattened out the paper on his side table.
"What does that mean?"
"How about you bend over and take my knot, bitch." Alistair snarled and before Dean could reply the alpha was upon him. Teeth sharp, eyes gold, and nails like daggers. Dean tried to avoid him but stumbled over a rock and twisted his ankle. Falling back he only had one hand to catch him now.
"Well, your mind wanders doesn't it?" Castiel jokes and lifted his head from Dean's shoulder. "I, I don't really know. I've always wanted a big family but I never really thought of a number. Kinda wanted to have them spaced out so there was always a pup. What makes you ask?" Castiel slid his hands from Dean's back around to rest on his stomach.
He pushes his back flush against the wall and slowly slides down to the warm tile floor. He spreads his legs wide and starts stroking his cock, the tip is red and beads of precome are being washed away by the splash of warm water. He takes his other hand and lowers it to his slicked up ass and starts to push in with one finger. The first ring of muscle is tight but he slides in nicely. Nice enough to add a second. He starts fucking himself back on his hand. The shower is filled with his panting and the smell of sweet omega slick. Dean leans his head back and starts to whine. He adds a third finger and starts to pump his cock harder. His stomach tightens like a spring ready to snap and release his muscles into pulsing ecstasy. He can taste the orgasm on his tongue as he circles the head of his cock with an eager thumb and strokes down his shaft. It's like a countdown to a rocket blastoff and with one last pull of his cock he comes all over his stomach. His ass pulsing around his slick covered fingers. He feels more slick leak out from his mind blowing orgasm. His mind is thrumming and he can't manage to catch his breath.
“Gabe it was much more complicated than that, we didn’t do it for fun.”
Dean's eyes were wide as he studied Castiel's crumpled face. He had a mixture of anger and pain in his eyes as water dripped from his hair.
Okay, sorry for such a late posting I have had a REALLY long and stressful day and I still have an essay to write and finals tomorrow!!! YAY! Now Emilie said she edited soooo....hopefully it's all good!
"I'm just full of surprises."
"I don't re-remember the last time." Dean paused and looked at Castiel for a second with blank eyes. "I was this damn drunk."
With that Dean sent the email and shut down his laptop. He wasn't tired but curled up in his bed anyway.
"So what should I bring?" Castiel asked looking frantically through his closet.
“Shit, wait right here I forgot my wallet.” Dean nodded and watched Castiel run up the steps. Within a few minutes of Castiel running inside an alpha and a beta approached him.
“She abused me, Dean.” He muttered “Meg.”
"Kinda a lot, when I move or breath." Dean looked back at himself. At least this was from great sex and not some freak in the woods.
Quickly scanning the overgrown yard for anything that resembled a weapon Castiel settled on a moss-covered brick laying beside an overgrown bush. Lightly tossing it to get a feel for it he felt it was as good of a weapon as he was going to have. Ignoring the front door he quietly made his way through the knee-length grass to sneak around the side of the house and get a feel of the layout. Running in guns blazing was not his best bet even if it was exactly what he wanted to do.
“Wait that’s it, just a mark? Ew.” Ew? Did this alpha just ew his mating mark? Yeah, it was fake but it is one good looking fake. Castiel has a nice set of teeth.
“Okay fine, no dates, no chickflick moments, no cuddling, what else?”
“Thought they didn’t work?”
"But-"
"I'm Castiel Novak," the man walks over and lifts his strong, smooth hand but Dean just looks from his hand to his blue eyes and then shakes his head and looks away.
"No, Mary please listen to me," John's voice was more aggressive now, and that only pissed her off farther.
"Dean, do you even know what GMO means?"
“Slow down.” Castiel cut again.
His brain was in such an overwhelming panic he paused to pick out the strongest trail. The taste of blood in his mouth didn’t help. Taking a deep breath in he settled on the path that leads across the street.
“Just accept defeat you know you’re excited for the pair I have in mind.” Castiel twitched slightly, hoping Dean’s imagination wouldn’t go too far.
"Mm, yes, my omega, knot, oh baby, fuck you so good,” Castiel growled.
“Ah yes, it’s to be expected, spread your legs a little so I can see the problem.” Dean nodded and opened up his legs for Cas. His alpha moved closer and took his hand to Dean’s inner thigh and began to rub with a firm grip. “Yes, Mr.Winchester you are very tense. Do you have someone to...relieve your problem?” At this point, they were role-playing a shitty doctor porno and it was taking so much self-control for them not to laugh. But it was fun-they both enjoyed funny sex, and how could you get in bed with someone who can’t make you laugh.
Castiel enjoyed his walk through campus, his brother worked at a coffee shop only a few minutes from his dorm so this was a regular trip for him. The temperature was dropping fast and the days were becoming shorter and shorter. That means more time in his room with Dean.
"I didn't say it, someone else did. I just- that's all I can remember." Dean spoke slowly as he searched his mind again.
“Yeah you think I mated your brother for shits and giggles?” Castiel flicked Dean in the back of the head.
"Um, I-I don't know I'm not here to take advantage on you and I don't expect you to act like my omega." Castiel really didn't know what to do, the other night the plan seemed so logical but once daylight came and sleep helped get their minds straightened and after Dean's crazed second night of heat. It just seemed like such a hard task.
"I needed someone to talk to, not you - no offense or anything. I don't mean not you like I don't like talking to you but I couldn't because I had to talk about you. Calling Jo was a mistake and the only other person I could think of was Alfie so I went and we talked." Dean started pacing back and forth in front of Castiel. "I'm kinda confused about last night." Castiel cocked his head slightly.
"If you even think of touching my mate I will rip your heart out and shove it down your fucking throat." The wide eyed alpha fought to shove Castiel back. He slammed his head into the wall one last time before he went back to his doors and scent marked it with a warning. With one last snarl he walked off leaving a potent warning smell to anyone who passes by.
“What is so funny?” He asked lifting his head up to look at Dean.
"I don't want to talk about it, Dean. Just let it go." His voice was cold like the air. Dean growled and jumped into Castiel's face.
“Sorry,” he said, letting out a chuckle and shaking his head.
"You taking care of me, man. No one takes care of me I take care of everyone else. I watch out for Sammy, and Adam, and my mom. Even Jo and Ash! I don't have people who want to play fact for fact and hold my crying ass in cars, that's just not how it goes in my life." Dean started breathing rapidly and was trying to calm himself down. "I felt so goddamn exposed last night and I don't like feeling that way I guess I wanted to even out the playing field and learn some shit about you." Dean exhaled.
"You ready, baby?" Dean asked as he pulled his fingers out and slid them into Castiel's mouth. Who greedily sucked them clean of slick.
Red. Blood.
"Shut up."
The room was nice. The girl gave them a room with two beds, but they were queen sized regardless. Dean ran to the mattress and flopped down on it.
"No, anyone ever tell you you smell weird for a beta." Cas lifts himself out of bed and ran a hand through his bed head. "I'm getting in the shower." Clad in boxers and a t-shirt Castiel crawled out of bed and stumbled into the bathroom.
As you can see Castiel's first Rut with a mate is an...experience.
“So what else have you added to the list?” Castiel looked over at Dean who was looking down at his feet.
"Dean and Jo?" Cas laughed. "She would kick your butt, Dean."
“Jo? Like the girl who you-”
Castiel woke up with a knot of anxiety eating at his gut, the kind you get when you know something is wrong but just can’t remember what it is. Everything seemed normal and he chalked it up to finals. Crawling out of bed he stumbled to the bathroom half-naked to take a quick shower to calm himself down. Yawning as he flipped the switch on he realized something was missing, the present smell of an omega. All that lingered in the room was one that was hours old. Turning around, he saw an empty bed and no sign of Dean. Shaking off his sleepy daze, he walked back to his bed and looked at the alarm clock that read it was two in the morning. Castiel patted around the bed until he found his phone. No messages from Dean. Another wave of anxiety swept through him, this time, his skin prickled and his heart speed up by a few beats. Going into his contacts he called Dean and it was directed to voicemail immediately. Dean’s automatic voicemail was just him saying “Not here, I’ll call whenever”. Hitting the end button a little too hard, Castiel felt a growl build in his chest that he was not expecting. The taste of metallic sat on his tongue and his canines slowly started sharpening. It all took him by surprise. This had never happened before, not when a threat wasn’t clearly present. His instincts were obviously telling him something was very, very wrong. Running back into the bathroom he practically watched the gold envelop his normally blue eyes and his canines come to a full point. He had no control of his alpha traits and he felt his nose start to tickle. The smell of the soap they used vanished and the after smell of his instant dinner was gone, he was left with one scent that was overpowering and it was Dean. Never before was he able to totally single out a smell like this and it terrified him. The change in himself had him panicking almost as much as Dean being MIA. He could only guess they were connected. Leaving the bathroom, he changed into his jeans and pullover in record time. He had one urge that was almost as strong as his need to mate when Dean was in heat and that was to find his omega.
“Lalalala!” Gabriel covered his daughters ears and shouted to Cas. everyone exchanged laughter and Beckett looked up at her father like he hung the moon, her eyes would light up when he would smile. She was everything you could want in a pup. Dean crouched down in front of Beckett
I literally just wrote this...like just now
"C-Cas what are you talking about, what did she do to you?" Dean searched Castiel's face for answers as a sick twist formed in his gut.
“Now how about you step off before we have a problem.” Castiel gave them one terrifying smile. There was a tense moment, none of them moved. The men looked between Castiel and Dean before walking off with a huff. Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“So, what can I help with you today, where does it hurt?” Castiel held back a laugh as he played doctor.
"Yes, you couldn't be their patriarch forever, you wouldn't do this to Adam and Sam! So just let Dean grow up, he's an adult and he found a great mate. Isn't that all we could ask for." Mary sighed, she finally got everything she needed out. John was still processing her words and he nodded his head.
"Cas, I am freaking starving." Dean sat up and looked over at his mate.
“Yeah she might defy all odds and shift just to pull your arm off.” Dean chuckled.
"It's killer man." Dean walked over to his bed and sat down looking out the window.  He could see the trees that covered every inch of the land outside. It was like the forest was a part of the room.
“Fine, then tomorrow. And mother I don’t need your money.” Castiel turned away and pulled Dean behind him. Storming up the stairs he pulled Dean into his room and slammed the door. His breathing had sped up and tears prickled in his blue eyes. That couldn’t of just happened.
"Oh god, Dean." Anna seemed worried and looked between him and the new woman. She smelt like whiskey and ash. Her dark curls framed her pale face. Dark red lipstick and charcoal eye shadow. She looked like someone who could put up one hell of a fight.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well Castiel will need someone to give orders with, and many packs keep an omega on the side to breed with." Dean's jaw hung open and he almost laughed at what was happening.
*Authors Note- Okay so I wanted to explain a few things before this chapter starts
He could take on multiple...just not now. He would be happy to, yes it is much harder but in reality, it is what they are built for, many many pups. It is natural and welcome to have such a large family. Castiel just prayed it wasn’t right now.
“Oh, Castiel did you want something?” Dean gave him a sly smile, and would he so pay for it.
"Sure, Jo." Following the blonde into the empty hall, her demeanor completely changed to completely serious.
"Cas?" Dean asked with a sleep graceless voice and squinting eyes. "Did I just get off in my dream?" Dean looked down at his stomach that was covered in ribbons of his own cum. Castiel gave him a quizzical look and shook his head.
It made Dean sick and angry, saliva filled to his mouth and he questioned if bile would soon follow. His tugging on the ropes became frantic to the point of bleeding. He was not in control of the situation, one whiff of him gave that away. The more Dean looked around the faster he came to the realization that his last conversation with his mate was a fight...and that might be all he had
"Dean are you asking to mark me?"
"Dad's a jackass." Dean spat, he didn't want to come off so mean to his mother, she didn't do anything.
It's been two days and Dean had been strangely distant. It put Castiel on edge, he craved attention and affection from Dean. Even if it was the mated part if his mind telling him that he felt like it was something he needed to survive. Or at least he claimed it was that part of his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh that is so much better" Dean stretched his legs out the best he could and he clenched around Castiel causing the alpha to shutter behind him. Causing another load to empty into Dean with a whimper from Cas. Dean laughed at Castiel who burrowed into his neck.
The run back to the dorm felt much longer, but once he saw the tall white building he picked up his pace. He could only imagine what Dean was doing left to his own devices like this.
It was bitter sweet packing up that morning. Dean only knew had to get Cas out of here, something was very wrong and he had to fix him. Since their mating was completed they have a much better feel for each other, almost like an emotional electromagnetic field between them, that connection only grows with time. Soon it will be felt over long distances and increase to a mind reading type feeling associated with the smallest change of mood. Right now Dean just felt sick from the uncomfortable fear rolling off Castiel.
"Okay, I went out for some air. That's all." Dean tried fixing his lie.
"Dean are you okay? Are-" he stops and sniffs the air and Dean waits for Cas to drag him inside. He's a good fighter he can take an alpha. But before either of them can say anything Alistair rounds the corner and grabs Dean by his collar to pull him to his feet.
“No reason, thanks for the coffee.” Castiel smiled and ruffled his brothers hair from over the counter. Grabbing his coffee he bid his goodbye and took one last look around. This shop strived on its regulars. There are only two rush hours and the rest of the day Cas could sit and talk with his brother.
"What are you talking about it isn't even ten yet!" Dean threw his hands up off the wheel.
"Sup Samandriel, I'll have the usual." The skinny little alpha smiled up at Dean and turned to fix his coffee.
"Hey Cas?" Dean called from the floor. Castiel poked his head out of the bathroom. Mouth full of toothpaste that dripped onto his chin. He hummed at Dean.
Castiel’s face immediately lit up once he saw what it was, Dean’s bedroom. Complete with ACDC, Metallica, Aerosmith, and Zeppelin posters. It was nearly spotless, Castiel was guessing Mary did a quick once over before Dean arrived. He had a twin bed with very familiar blue sheets and a single nightstand that held a lamp and clock. Dean’s room didn’t have a theme or color scheme. More an accordant of necessities that somewhat matched. A light wooden desk with half-peeled off stickers and some marker stains with a rolling chair that had a few rips in it. His rug was a very dark green and his floor had scuffs near his bed. The armoire was a washed-out white and leaned somewhat crooked and it was all so Dean. Castiel loved it.
"So um, any pointers for your family? Like how to not get ganged up on by one of the most well know packs of this century?" Dean lead the way into the parking lot Castiel found him in after Alistair attacked. His baby was parked in the middle of the lot and she was slightly neglected over this past week.
"Rachel, I need to do something very important." All Castiel wanted to do was talk to Dean. He knew Rachel was a stubborn girl so he would need to think of something she deemed important, and having a conversation wasn't it.
“I may have, sorta bit him by accident. We have been fake mates since last night.” Cas let out a light huff of breath but the only noise in the room was Beckett digging through her bin. Gabriel’s golden eyes were wide and his mouth was agape, his brow creased as he tried to process what Cas had just said.
”No chickflick moments? Are you kidding?” Cas asked
A harsh knocking at the door and a screaming woman snapped them both out of their post-coital bliss and scared them so much Dean tumbled off Cas causing his knot to be forcefully ripped out.
"Is it now? Okay, just putting it out there if you do have a young lady over to
"You're not the only one with good taste in music.” He teased sipping from his water. By the time the waitress returned with their milkshakes both of them were throwing their heads back and belting out "I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOUR LOVE, TONI-IGHT." The place was nearly empty so it's not like they were bothering anyone.
“Just trust me, okay?” Castiel smiled, they’d both been smiling a lot this afternoon.
"Holy fuck-" Dean cut himself off and grabbed Castiel's face. "What happened?"
"Holy shit Cas we slept a whole day!" Dean shook his mate awake.
“Really?”
Dean was only given a few looks but none were threatening. Exchanged a few nods with some betas and alphas he had gotten to know over time. And made his way onto campus with ease, it was such a nice day out. Air still crisp and cool but he had on his old leather jacket that warmed in the sun. He took his time walking, the trees were still bare but in a few weeks, they would bloom. The snow was just about melted on the grass and Dean was happy to wish it goodbye. He couldn't wait for this year to be over. Months ago he would have wanted to be free of Cas, now he wanted to start a life with the man.
"Hey, Blondie." Dean smiled at her voice.
"Shut up." He muttered turning red.
"Yeah, Jo. She's an alpha but still."
"Dean, Dean wake up." He was shaken awake from his dream.
“Oh, no. I will just have to do it myself.” Dean let a laugh slip past his lips but Castiel managed to keep a straight face on.
here?” Dean’s voice went up a few octaves as he thought back to his little home in Lawrence.
"All right, everything came back totally normal. No sign of any reproductive problems or underlying issues."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay hear me out on this." Castiel started, standing up from his bed. "We swap clothes and scent each other, I'll scent the doors and windows like a warning."
"I don't go upstairs much. I have my own exit and all. I mean don't get me wrong I've been looking for a house for over a year now but since my parents don't count me as part of their pack anymore I have to come up with the money." Dean couldn't believe all of this was real, that he had mated into this psychotic family of knotheads.
“Mmm, I like it hard.” Castiel only chuckled and leaned to capture Dean’s eggar lips. Slipping his tongue in past Dean’s mouth he started an intense makeout session with an equally intense finger fucking.
"Nothing really, just had some time to kill and wanted to say hi." Dean felt himself backing out, even talking to Sammy about personal problems was hard. Dean may be an omega but he was raised like an alpha and he was always taught to man up. Don't cry, and shove your feelings down. That is what made Dean so emotionally constipated as Sam puts it.
“Fuck..” Now he felt bad about his fight with Cas, but in all fairness, he can handle himself. Maybe the storming out was dramatic but he hated being coveted and babied. So what his heat was soon, so what about anything.
"So big alpha, you ever bottom?" Dean asked playful and he didn't notice Castiel's body stiffen or his eyes still. He didn't know Castiel's blood felt like ice and his mind flashed triggers over and over and the only thing keeping him grounded where the warm arms around him and the smell of leather and home. Dean. What Dean did notice was the curling smell of panic in the air. Dean waved his hand in front if Castiel's face.
Then Castiel snapped his hips and made Dean gasp. he followed with four other powerful thrusts and then fell into a hard fast rhythm.
“I’m not, just kinda thinking.” Cas stood and placed a kiss on Dean’s temple. Since the attack they shared more affectionate moments and soft kisses, it was comforting for the both of them.
"Oh god, fuck, okay, Dean stop!" Dean froze and looked at Cas dead in the eyes. "If we're going to do this I need to hear it out loud and clear of your consent. I- I really don't want you to regret this once your heat is over." Dean smiled and nodded. Leaning over his whispered into Castiel's ear.
"I love him, but his values can be suffocating on the boys. After Dean presented I was so scared for Sam and Adam." Mary leaned into Ellen's comforting embrace. "Can you imagine if they went into heat? I can't protect them all from his views."
“Oh is the alpha there? Remember Dean don’t fuck him and keep your slick to yourself!”
They slowly circled each other in an odd dance of chance, trying to guess who would strike next. this time it was Cas with his out of character speed, the kind an omega usually had. But Castiel was well built slender but sturdy muscles wrapped his bones but he wasn’t bulky, he was the perfect mix. Dean still managed to block his strike with his forearm. Cas gave a small snarl and struck again but was quickly blocked.
"Dean-" Castiel held up the bag and the color drained from Dean's face.
"Actually, yeah, I want a vanilla milkshake." Cas said handing his menu to her. Dean snorted.
"War!"
“Mother, Dean does not have papers he isn’t some house pet I bought to follow me around.” Naomie seemed annoyed at her son's response. "He is not a dog." He emphasized through his teeth.
“I don’t know what I say when I’m in heat, I‘ve heard it in a porno. Just kinda went with it.”
Finally, Dean saw the machine, he pulled out his dollar and stuck it in the slot. He pressed the first soda he saw and coke dropped out. Waiting to open it until he got his books and made it back to his seat.
"Sounds like a great idea." They drove until they found the first abandon parking lot they could find. Grass poking out from cracks in the pavement overgrown bushes and unclipped trees. It was great. They rolled down all the windows to create a cross breeze and bring in the smell of spring. Dean pulled the bag over into the middle of them and dug them each out a pie.
"Castiel," John called. He didn't move for a second and looked over at Dean who looked as confused as him. "You heard me boy let's go!" Castiel waited a second more and then slowly walked over to stand next to John. The rest of the teams were chosen and Dean found himself with Bobby.
"No! No- no one is here mom and, well god my it's not like I could have kids of my own even if there was a girl here." Dean knew he sounded like he was lying but he could help it.
"Fuck, Dean so good, so wet, so amazing." Castiel moaned as he released one hand to wrap around Dean's bouncing cock.
“Are you telling me you two have been faking this crap since last night?” Gabriel started laughing as it started to click in. “Why the hell would you be fake mates? Just unmark him and be buddies if that’s what you want.”
“See anything?” Dean was impressed by the wide selection of baby accessories.
“Get your fine ass in the back seat right now,” Dean demanded and watched Castiel follow his orders and scurry into the back. With a mysterious smile Dean grabbed the strawberry pie Cas was just teasing him with and joined his mate.
“He’s a good kid. Super smart too, really, really smart.” Cas nodded.
"Well my brothers call me Alfie if that works." Dean raised an eyebrow and sipped at his steaming drink.
“Dean hold on please I’m coming.” He spoke between large gasps of breathe as he ran faster than he had in his life. His legs were on fire and his lungs felt like he had swallowed acid but he kept pushing on.
“But I got the prize.” Cas went down to nip lightly at Dean’s collarbone since his teeth were still sharpened.
"That all you need, freckles because I have one killer ass research project I have totally been procrastinating on." Typical Jo.
"I don't know, you were in alpha mode and.."
"Oh, Jesus, I am so damn out of it." Dean yawned and rubbed his eyes.
"My gosh, Castiel I didn't even know you knew each other?"
Mary clenched her fists and tried to keep calm. She did not want to yell. "No John, that was not a 'mishap" she raised her hands for air quotes. "That was you being a stupid alpha. I can't tell what is wrong with you! Are you jealous?" Mary's brow knit together and John seemed to be processing something.
He trailed up to his sternum and collarbones. Trailing up to his ear he gave a soft nip at his lobe. Breathing over the shell of his ear he purred.
Pressing eager lips to Castiel’s heated ears Dean purred.
"Shh god, Cas," he can feel Dean winde tight in his arms before he exploded with a cry and fell into Castiel's arms.
"Damn, thought you would rise to the occasion." Dean laughed and started shuffling the deck again.
"Yo Cas, anyone ever tell you your musk smells like ass?" Dean buries his head into the pillow trying to draw out any other smell that wasn't...Cas. Falling back asleep was no longer an option.
“What?” Dean questioned, his fork was only a few inches from his mouth and Cas could tell how badly Dean wanted to eat it.
“Not exactly, you may but your cycle is so irregular and new that your body may register that as a heat and go back on its regular, or as close to regular, to your other cycle.” Castiel scrolled a little and found that he got all he could out of the article so he decided to close out.
Dean pulled the napkin off his lap and threw it onto the table and stood up purposely scratching the chair across the wood floor.
"That's exactly it! I could help you with your heat and now that the school knows you're an omega you'll be left alone and you won't get a transfer notice sent home."
"Dean, grab something before I choose for you!" Castiel whispered and nudged his mate. Dean blindly grabbed a bag of chips and they snuck back upstairs.
*     *     *
"Dean!" Alfie greeted thankful for the distraction. Castiel perked up at the sight of his mate and pulled the third chair closer to him.
“I’m sorry I’m sorry.” she lifted her hands in fake surrender. "I really didn't know your school was this far away, got lost a few times." Dean laughed knowing Jo was never one to ask for directions and he could totally see her swearing at a cheap gas station map on the side of the road.
"So this is where Gabriel lives?" Dean asked once Gabe was out of earshot.
“High-class bitch. I see his mark is still intact, even looks freshly bitten.” The man leaned farther in and extended his hand to touch Dean’s neck. A feral growl ripped from his chest and he lunged for the man's hand. His actions were quickly met by a backhand to the face. He was almost surprised by it but refused to react to the pain, Dean would not back down, he was falling to no one's feet.
"I will punch you in the fucking dick, Cas." He heard Dean’s growl echo off the bathroom tile.
Every mark is different, since every person has different kinds of teeth it makes every mating mark unique. Dean left an amazing mark, his teeth were rather straight. But his K9's were sharp and went deep into his skin. It would take a little while to heal, then there would be a silver scar left in its place. Every few years mates usually remark their partner to make the bite stand out more. But until then it remained red and the skin around it irritated, but it was still perfect.
“Not even high end,” Dean mumbled to himself as he leaned down to grabbed it.
One line negative, two lines positive. Taking in one last breath he looked down and almost puked.
"And his presentation?" John asked. Smiling he looked down at the paper even though he clearly already knew the answer beforehand. Dean waited for the magic words.
"Okay, yeah that bothered me but...I mean we technically aren't mates. You have nothing concrete binding you to me." Dean paused swallowing loudly he thought about Castiel sleeping around and a small growl rumbled in his chest.
"Dean, please let me go with you." He pleads but Dean continued to put his books together.
Anyway I hope you liked the chapter and comments are ALWAYS welcome. They would probably brighten up my days a lot.
“ I know.”
"Yeah, it's a lot." Castiel said sheepishly.
“Milk,” Dean said obviously not realizing it had come from his mouth instead of staying in his brain. He felt the rhythm sputter a little but then regained as Castiel lowered down closer to him.
"Yeah, he does but I told him to, uh, sleep in. He'll be here to pick me up." Dean's voice faltered at the lie.
"You weren't upset I slept with someone else?" Dean raised his eyebrow surprised at Cas' words. "But, dude I said I slept with someone a few weeks ago!" Castiel tensed again
"That will be 5.36." A small blond beta chirped her hair twisted into a braid. A smile too wide to be genuine.
"Dean, shut up. Stop bashing yourself. You’re going to make someone very happy with your snarky attitude and self-lubricating butt. Just wait." Dean just wanted to sleep, he wasn't in the mood to bash himself.
"Bullshit, I get maternity leave, so are you going to be absent with them, too? Is Dean going to be the patriarch to them?" Mary was on the verge of crying.
"Jesus boys settle down," Ellen rolled her eyes and followed Mary out to her old blue civic. Shopping didn't take long but they normally grab some coffee and take some quiet time together. Once they made it into the car Mary collapsed her head into the steering wheel.
"We do." Ellen used to play on the team too, pretty damn good but she enjoyed her time with Mary more than old alpha musk and swearing.
"Dean?" Castiel questioned looking at the omega over his book. "Did I forget something?" Castiel leaned back a little trying to keep some distance between them.
“What?”
“Find everything okay?” The elderly alpha asked as he rung Castiel up.
