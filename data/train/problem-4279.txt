“But the souls-”
Anna sat against an apple tree, idly flipping through a book while Castiel lay next to her, resting his head against her thighs. Cas acknowledged with a soft hum that Anna had spoken but didn’t say anything in return. For perhaps the first time, he felt so entirely at peace while being haunted by the shadow of his former commander. They were both in civilian clothes, and the sun was filtering down through the leaves of the apple tree just the way Anna liked.
“It’s hard not to think of it as his body,” says Claire. “That’s all. So I get that he’s vacated the premises and no one else is home but it’s still…”
“If no one’s in charge, there’s no one to ask permission from,” said Dean. “We got that when Zachariah’s response to people questioning him was a pretty thinly veiled ‘fuck you’.”
“You must have struck quite the deal with Canada,” Castiel commented quietly. Sam sent a pointed look in Cordelia’s direction but didn’t do much for damage control. Perhaps he had a higher opinion of Castiel than the soldier originally thought.
“Because I wasn’t very quiet about my boyfriend,” Cas says. And now he’s looking at Dean, and there’s a challenge in his eyes. “Something I thought you had less of a problem with in this country.”
“Where was I supposed to leave her? With Dr. Newman? Oh right, he’s dead! With the Patels? As if they don’t have their own child to raise without having to raise ours too.”
“F-f-follow me,” Inias said, gulping when he looked at the torturer. The poor man was little better than a bureaucrat, and Castiel did not feel safe in knowing that he was the sole point of reference he had in this rescue mission. Still, he kept his eyes down and never looked at Inias for too long. Best not to give up the game, if only for Inias’ sake. He could still back out and Castiel did not hate him, and saw no need to reveal him if he did so. After all, what did he owe a traitor several times over?
Then, of course, Sam had to come back out of one of the other doorways.
“He is trying to help as well.”
Dean leaves the bathroom after another fifteen minutes and orders another round.
Once they reached the building put aside for residence, Charlie made her own way back to her and Jo’s room and Castiel made his way to the room he shared with Gordon, Benny, and Rufus. When he opened the door, it was to find each of them already asleep, which thankfully meant that Gordon wasn’t glaring at him for the moment. Cas made his way over to the corner where he usually slept.
“Anything you like,” he said. “And what should I call you?”
“That’s the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me,” said Garth. Cas wasn’t sure if he was being serious, and decided he didn’t like being on the receiving end of absurdity played straight, hypocritical as that might be. “Betsy thinks I’m cute as a button. And she didn’t give one toot that I wasn’t good for her future either. I put us in danger the moment I started patching resistance folks up and she stuck by me. And don’t tell Betsy I said this, but Dean is about twice as crazy and stubborn as she is.”
“You know who he is,” Boris said. He tilted his head toward the woman, jerkily. “Her name’s Harriet.”
“That’s what it will look like,” said Castiel. “After Libidine fell, Zachariah is going to be even more wary than he would be otherwise.”
“But he can’t die young,” she says to him slowly, sympathetically. “Because that’s not his ending.”
“It’s awesome,” Dean said. And then as the realization hit him that the voice he heard was the same as the poem’s author. “You wrote it?”
She held the glare a moment longer before looking away. And suddenly Castiel understood just why Trisha rubbed him the wrong way. In her eyes he could see a fraction of himself staring back.
“Someone has to,” he said. “And I’ve known Jesse and Cesar a while. They’ll talk to me. If I can get to them without getting my throat slit.”
“That must have been a bitch to figure out, considering,” she said at last. “That have anything to do with what happened to your Commander?”
“Okay, I’m on my way,” said Benny. “Why’d the doc ask for me?”
“They’re doing something to one of the cars,” said Castiel. “They only need four to leave. I think they mean to leave the one they’re tampering with behind.”
“You once left a sandwich to rot on your bedside table for two weeks.”
“When you and Crowley-”
So they kept up their steady drive towards Mortimer. It was only fifteen minutes, but the dead silence in the car made it feel like hours. Cas looked back to see the other people in the car counting the increasing amounts of soldiers they were spotting. They were all pale faced, their eyes darting around them and Cas was sure he looked much the same. However, Dean was right. At this point there was nothing they could do but stick to the plan and hope that it wasn’t in Billie or Mortimer’s interest to kill them.
It was another two minutes before an enormous boom resounded through the city. Charlie’s improvisation had the intended effect. Dozens more people flooded out of the prison, armed and ready to face whoever had disturbed the peace. There couldn’t be more than ten people left in the building now. It was better than they had hoped the first plan would work.
“Do I?”
“Because it’s not right,” said Jack, as though it were obvious. “At least most of the other cities feed their citizens. Have you seen Guttur?”
She was with John. Not the real John. Even after everything, they didn’t share a heaven. Perhaps it was better that way. Perhaps not. He wasn’t sure if she was happy, but she was content. It was peaceful. It was a small Kansas movie theater on a mild summer night. Truth be told, it wasn’t a heaven Cas would have spent much time in back when he was in the habit of doing such things, but he had gained an appreciation for days like this. They reminded him of his own home, his own now dissolving family.
“You want to know what I think?” asked Dean. “I think you’re still in love with a dead girl and you’re taking that out on me because that’s easier than figuring out how to move on with your life.”
Castiel stared at him, trying to keep several emotions from running away from him. Anger welled under his skin, and even if she could not see it, he wondered if Pamela could feel it coming off him in waves. Here was someone responsible, someone to blame, someone to hate.
No, you shouldn’t have, Castiel thought to himself.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” said Dean. “Cas, if this is a call for help, I’m fucking listening.”
In the intervening twenty years, Mary and John Winchester had done what young couples in love frequently do. They had gotten married and had two children, only one of which survived to adulthood (as far as they were aware). His name was Dean Winchester, and at eighteen years old he was just as lovable as Mary had been as a child and just as excitable as John had been.
“I suppose so,” Castiel said through gritted teeth at that description of the work he had been doing.
“I’ve been told the Egyptians worshipped cats,” Castiel said evenly. “I can see why. They don’t really take no for an answer.”
Castiel tackled Dean to the ground.
“Guys,” he said. He was ignored. “Guys is now really the best time to be-“
“Alice is a pretty name!” Charlie says, frowning at Dean in disapproval. She turns to Alice only to see she’s even grumpier at hearing this. “And very kickass too. Totally a kickass name.”
Which meant Castiel had five miles of sneaking into Sanctus to do, and five miles to get back. It also meant that they were being delayed an entire day in returning back to Ira. He hoped the damn message Risa was sending was worth it.
“And to those forces that would invade the city,” said Naomi next. “I have in my possession two high profile hostages. Castiel and Jo Harvelle. As I understand it, Dean Winchester and Ellen Harvelle have more than enough motive to spare these two lives. I want to be clear: the only way both of them are getting out alive is if I have a total surrender by resistance forces within forty eight hours. After that I will kill one of the hostages. If no surrender has been offered within an additional twenty four hours, both of them will be dead.”
“You’re one of the most competent people I’ve ever met,” Castiel said, hoping the subject would be dropped. One look and he knew he had no such luck.
Cas was grateful for when they were on ground level and he no longer needed the intermittent support of Benny.
“Fine, then we won’t. But don’t act all pissy when I can’t read your mind.”
Sam, Cas, and Charlie sit at the kitchen table, and Dean can’t bring himself to approach them. Cas is slightly pink, which means he’s been drinking and he has been doing his best to make the effects last. Dean likes when that happens. There’s something bubbly about the way Cas starts complaining about obscure historical events (the ones he deigned watch from the heavens), or the way he winks too much and not at quite the right times.
“Lie,” Dean said, as though it were that easy. “Zachariah could easily be using this as an excuse to justify attacking Naomi. Say he’s making everything up.”
Somehow, Castiel doubted Azazel would have an issue sending soldiers to kill the both of them, even if he still wasn’t sure whether he wanted to take Naomi’s side in the war. He wouldn’t even have to risk attacking the resistance outright. Just send the right whispers to the right places, and Castiel knew more than one person that would tie him up and hand him over for slaughter. Gordon would do something like that with a grin on his face.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” he muttered, swearing under his breath a moment later. Some of the people around them were beginning to cough from the smoke. The situation was quickly becoming desperate, and everyone realized it. “You just had to blow up the elevator, huh?”
“Claire just wants you to stop following her on hunts.”
“Fair,” he said. His hallucination must be upsetting, because even though he was no longer grieving, he flinched at the sight of whatever horrific way Dean had died. “Does it go away any time soon?”
“Balthazar-“
“Because that’s not me,” says Dean. “I want to be whatever rose colored version of me you’ve got in your head, but I’m not. I’m just me. I thought- I thought the hard part was over, y’know? You love me, fine. More than fine, even. I thought the rest would be easy, but it’s not, because you’re still you and I’m still me and we still got issues.”
It’s about an hour until go time when Jack finally musters up whatever it is that compels him to ask Dean again what happened to Cas. Considering they’re all dead if this doesn’t work, and Dean doesn’t really see himself outliving this anyway, Dean tells him the truth. More robotic than how he told Sam. Like it’s just a thing that happened. Like it’s not slowly tearing Dean to shreds from the inside out.
“He is good looking,” Balthazar said when they wandered toward the mostly empty dining hall and he saw Dean sitting there with Jo and Benny, clearly having a serious discussion with the both of them. Benny must have traveled from Ira, Cas thought to himself. He doubted the man had entirely recovered from his bullet wound yet, but with Jo having abandoned her post…
“I mean the flirting, it’s fun,” Dean said, as though he were trying to place a bandaid on Cas’ hurt feelings. Fatherly instinct, Castiel supposed. “But it’s just… I have a kid. And we’re in the middle of a war. And you’re… you’re fucked up in about five different ways, Cas, and that’s not even touching my issues.”
“You guys are so fucked if Doc finds out about this,” Dean said next. “I was never here if he gets wind you’re trading in this shit again.”
That’s what Cas had thought he’d heard.
Castiel agreed with this and ended up spending the afternoon helping Jo take notes on the side effects people were experiencing. He dozed off about halfway through the afternoon, which upon waking felt unfortunately like admitting defeat. Jo seemed happier with him though.
“Dean-?” Sam starts to ask, but Cas cuts across him.
“Yes, because that isn’t suspicious at all,” Castiel said, crossing his arms and dropping his defensive pose. Perhaps this was another test Dean was setting for him. “In any case, you haven’t offered any proof Naomi actually sent you. You could be anyone.”
“Should I be-“
“And Dean’s don’t?” Jack asks. He pauses. “I’m sorry.”
“But it’s nothing compared to the time I spent thinking about…” Cas starts, going silent as he sees Dean’s expression sharpen in concentration. He is giving Dean a lot of ammunition to hurt him. He knows he is. For some reason, he still can’t stop himself from finishing his sentence. “Other things.”
It tastes like plaster, but Dean paints on a smile and finishes watching the fucking movie like nothing is wrong. That much he knows how to do. If nothing else.
“I brought presents,” Dean huffs. Cas emerges from the shadows, sullenly. Benny remains hidden, and Dean knows he won’t coax him out. He’s too principled for that, but Cas- “You’d follow me anywhere wouldn’t you?”
Billie was in charge. If she said something could or couldn’t happen, that was the final word on the subject. Because of this, no one ever went to her with any questions. Dean was the one who handled the day to day running of everything from food to weapons to the chances of a surprise attack. Sam was who you went to if you had an idea you knew Dean wouldn’t like and Billie would laugh in your face if you brought up. Sarah, Kevin, and Frank were who you went to if you wanted an obscure piece of information found quickly, and for apparently obvious reasons you went to them specifically in that order. Benny, Rufus, Gordon, Risa, Tamara, and Linda were each in charge of a section of the camp. Everyone had to be proficient with a weapon, but it seemed not everyone was involved with the attacks on state resources that Castiel remembered having to defend against when he was still working with his garrison.
Dean glared at nothing and his fingers twitched. Cas wished a moment that he might resurrect Alistair just to kill him again himself. Dean’s expression didn’t leave much to the imagination.
“What?”
Dean has a nice voice, Cas thought to himself. Despite himself.
“So what?” asked Benny. “Don’t mean a thing in the long run. Just ask Jo how much love is worth.”
***********
Gadreel looked him straight in the eyes.
It was a question that stayed in his head all through the night, as they told their parents and the news began to spread through Lebanon. Excluding other men Dean’s age (and one very sad girl) who had had their eyes on Jo, everyone was overjoyed to hear the news. And yet Dean wasn’t. He didn’t feel a sense of accomplishment, or even contentment.
It took Castiel a moment to realize that Balthazar had stayed behind the others and was trying to catch his attention.
“I like this jacket,” Cas mutters.
“I don’t know. He’s… I saw him growing inside Kelly. Sometimes it felt like he was growing from pieces of me, too,” says Cas. As if Jack is truly his own flesh and blood somehow, and in the most viscerally human of ways. As if somehow Jack was birthed by him and Kelly both, and both died for it. Died for him. “I don’t know, Sam.”
Dean is yelling now, but it’s not like anyone can hear them. Well, maybe Billie, but fuck her. Cas is gonna listen to him for once, and if it has to be a fight so fucking be it.
Castiel nodded, placing his gun back in his belt to emphasize the point that he meant to proceed peacefully. Jo rolled her eyes at the gesture, but something in her stance seemed to relax a little. It was wise of her to remain a certain amount of wariness when it came to Castiel. That didn’t make it easier to see.
“That happened,” said Charlie flatly. “And you didn’t fucking tell me?”
“Y’know, for a dorky gay virgin, you’re not half bad at girl talk,” Charlie muttered, punching him in the shoulder lightly. Cas shrugged it off, accepting it as the affection it was.
“It took you a long time.”
“I could come with you,” said Dean.
Cas woke up with a heavy weight on his left side and a dull aching throb of pain on his right. He remembered he’d been stabbed the day before and decided he needed more pain medication. The other phenomena was quickly explained when he opened his eyes to find Dean practically laying on top of him and using his shoulder as a pillow.
It took on a kind of rhythm avoiding the various people on duty, and it took Castiel far out of his way. He was surprised when he realized a certain area had more people patrolling than usual when he had to dodge three people in the space of five minutes. Out of curiosity and a desire to calm the unwelcome doubts that filled his head, he carefully crept closer to the tent they seemed to be trying to keep more secure than any of the others. Perhaps it was some kind of armory.
“We are talking about it.”
Dean’s eyebrows shot up.
Hannah’s back stiffened and she walked away without another word, weapon in hand and eyes back to scanning the streets. Castiel carefully picked his way back to Jo’s car, which was still running. The second he was inside, Jo was driving back towards the resistance’s headquarters within the city. Hopefully Gabriel would have completed his part of the plans while Castiel had been talking with Hannah.
“Dean was trying to get an emotional reaction out of me,” Castiel acknowledged slowly. “But I admit my actions were… rash.”
Heaven isn’t perfect, and it isn’t eternal. Not really. But what it is is the next best thing. Happiness, that can be crystallized, dusted off, experienced like new again and again. Waning and fading, and made fresh even in moments of agony. Not without end, but in its own way endless.
“See Jack, here, tried to do a good thing,” Billie says, and Cas can sense a small amount of empathy that she hasn’t shown towards the rest of them. She knows Jack is young, he supposes. She knows he still has far to go, before he becomes himself. Something Castiel had lost sight of himself when Jack had simply seemed too enormous of a being to be a parent to. “Tried to fix a problem I’m sure most of you are familiar with. Heaven was… isolating. What he chose not to see was that that was on purpose. Heaven isn’t a reward, it’s a battery. The human mind isn’t meant for eternity, but the human soul… that never runs out of energy. So the angels anaesthetized humanity as best as they could so the engines would keep on running, and they could keep growing their own power off that spark. Same idea as Hell, different execution. Keeps the souls fresher. You can’t fix something that wasn’t built with people in mind in the first place.”
“His middle name. For friends only, and usually not even then,” said Charlie. “Dean gets away with it because he’s Dean. Which is sort of the issue. Crowley likes him too much, and he’s not the only monarch on the scene. Rowena is tough as nails and escaped when Dean and Crowley tried to overthrow her. East Canada is still completely under her control.”
“What do you want?” Castiel asks in return.
“Then I’m free to stay here and sleep,” Castiel pointed out. Charlie made an exasperated noise at this assertion, but seemed to believe Castiel that he had no plans to move. Then she glanced at her cat and her face lit up in a way that told Castiel she had had an idea. He suspected he wouldn’t like said idea.
The shadow didn’t answer him, just sat there judgmentally.
“You can fix him,” he says to her. It is the only reason she would be here, he reasons to himself. He suspects that this may yet be part of Billie’s game. At least part of her plan depended on his need to save the man he loves. He can only hope the remainder of it is counting on those same motivations. Unlike Dean or Sam or Eileen, the idea of being a pawn had long since failed to bother him. Any choice he made was a choice he would have been denied if fate had played out the way it was meant to. He is grateful for that, and he is deliberate in choosing for himself, even when he knows he is at the mercy of someone else’s machinations. They are still his thoughts, his feelings, his wants and needs and hopes. “Help him.”
“And it’s not fair,” Dean finished for him. “I know a thing or two about that.”
They stood in front of him, naked except for great white wings that dragged behind them, broken and stained red.
Cas took out the envelope Risa had given him and passed it over to Ellen. She opened it and scanned it quickly, her face growing grim as she read.
Interesting.
“You feeling okay, Castiel?” he asked. “You look a little… unnerved.”
“I’ve been able to hack outgoing messages from him,” said Charlie. “Which means we’ve known for a while that he had plans to pretty much wipe out resistance forces outside Invidia. The other cities have sent back mixed opinions on whether or not this is a good idea.”
**********
JULY 7, 2163 CE - LIBIDINE
“They should,” said Cas. “I worked for two years under a man named Ishim when I was assigned to my third and final garrison. He used to be my commander’s second in command until a woman came to Anna begging for her help. Ishim had offered her an ultimatum and told her that he would report her home as a resistance stronghold and see to it she and her daughter died if she didn’t engage in sexual activities with him.”
“You don’t need to die to make things right,” Cas tells Dean before leaving them to stake out the library. Dean watches him go, his face still a little stunned. Except when he catches Sam just openly gawking at him, he goes a little red.
Dean went stock still next to him.
“No,” said Cas.
“Yeah, well you’re not exactly sister of the year either,” he says. “Or do you think I didn’t know? Because it would have taken something pretty powerful to hide the Winchester’s shit for brains plans from me, and Billie and the Empty were both down for the count by then. You played me. You chose to let us lose to a fucking three year old. That’s not just embarrassing, it’s downright devious. How long are you planning to keep him on ice before you take over?”
“It’s just-”
At least he had until Dr. Newman had gotten a second patient.
It’s as close to an admission as Rowena is going to get. At this point, she may have earned his trust, but that’s something hard to give in the best of circumstances. But this…
Not so luckily for Castiel, Risa had suspected something like this would happen and had sweet talked a spare uniform off of Pamela before they’d left. She thrust it at Castiel when he had made the idiotic decision of asking exactly how they were going to get in. Along with the uniform he’d been handed a message which he’d been strictly ordered not to read, and to only give to Ellen, Bobby, or Jody.
In Castiel’s ear piece came an order, loud and clear.
To say Castiel is shocked to see Crowley alive and well would be… well, perhaps shocked isn’t the right word. Somewhere between surprised, annoyed, and caught off guard. That Rowena is with him and the two don’t seem to be quite as much at each other’s throats as usual is equally unsettling. The first thought Cas manages to hold onto is to wonder what they are doing here, and how this changes things. Billie is straight forward. Crowley isn’t.
“Who exactly?” Cas asked loudly. “Kali is working with Naomi. We tried to outwit the deal Dean made with Crowley, I doubt the soldiers from the mercenary army he sent are going to treat us kindly. Mary knows at this point that we disobeyed orders again. This is a standoff, and we are not on anyone’s good side.”
‘You don’t think you and I would share a Heaven?’ signs Sam. He realizes how insane a question that is about two seconds later and hurries to add. ‘Not now, but… eventually?’
Jason stiffened, a look of shock and then mortification crossing his face.
“How does being a soldier fit into that?”
“You know how I feel,” is all Cas has to say. And Jack must, because he even manages a small smile at that.
“You want to know why?” Sam asked, not looking the least bit surprised that Castiel knew about that. Then again, it was a major point of contention as far as Selma had told Castiel. It was why Gordon disliked Sam so much and Kubrick believed he needed to atone. “Because they were doing things I didn’t agree with, and when I said something they didn’t take to it too kindly. Let’s just say there are reasons Jess and I avoid anything with mind altering properties.”
“What do you want?” Castiel asked, not having time for whatever she was implying. Meg shrugged as though she hadn’t expected an answer anyway.
“Uh, yes,” Castiel said, trying to clear his head of the vague panic he still felt. “Just… just give me a little while to see what’s happening.”
“You told me I was the one thing you wanted and I told you I was up for grabs, how much more did we need to get into?”
“You know I really don’t think so-“
Her dad lets her go and that’s when he finally notices the person standing behind her. Missouri Mosely looks at her son again for the first time in more years than she cares to count. Patience doesn’t turn around, doesn’t know what she might look like at that moment. She’s wearing the broach she gave Patience, the one she promised meant she would always be with her. Patience wonders now if Missouri knew, somehow, that this would happen. Even if she didn’t know how, she foresaw that Patience would bring her back.
Castiel chuckled to himself for a moment.
Dean can’t finish his sentence. And Cas is still just standing there, like a rubber band ready to snap. Can’t he see that Dean wants him to? Is he really going to make him say it?
“You- I was surprised,” he said. “I wasn’t expecting you to put your tongue inside my mouth.”
“Who’s Victor?” Bobby asks first.
“Wait, what am I?” asked Dean. Jo frowned and considered him.
Claire did know that Alex was going to college out of state, and that she wanted to be a doctor, and that all the teachers at school acted like the sun shone out of her ass because of everything she had overcome to become the perfect fucking little valedictorian. She knew that when she’d confided in Kaia that Alex’s boyfriend during their junior year was a skeezball, Alex had responded by saying Claire was jealous because nobody wanted to date her. It was months of hurt that drove her to say what she said next.
Warnings: homophobia (from character who would NOT be homophobic in SPN canon), mild violence, mentions of sex work
Hannah nodded in agreement, as did several others in Castiel’s garrison. They looked at him as though he were more than he was, and Castiel felt uncomfortable with the feeling. Being second in command had suited him. Being the center of attention did not.
And so, for the first time since who knows how long, Dean smiles to himself. Really smiles. Because, hey, if nothing else he’s free to damn himself this time. Who says that doesn’t make a difference?
Chuck considered this.
“So there is no plan,” Claire summarized. “Yikes.”
For a moment, bloodied faces swam before his vision. Hael with a bullet wound between her eyes. Susannah and Benjamin with their throats slashed. Balthazar and Hannah fallen and bleeding to death.
“I don’t know where my dad is, and even if I did I wouldn’t tell you,” Dean hisses into the phone. Mary and Bobby are looking at him now. They know who’s on the other line. Or at least they think they know.
“Talk about what? You want to raise a kid in a war zone?”
It’s the end of the world and there’s an angel on his shoulder. Go figure.
Dean watches anyway. The body screams as soon as Cas fashions a voice box and sews together a throat. A chin, a nose, ears, lips, and a scalp. Cas doesn’t give him eyes. Not until he presses to fingers to the body’s forehead, lulling the lost soul to sleep.
“No I can’t,” says Bobby. It takes Dean a second to catch the significance.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
Once he was done vomiting, Cas was rolled carefully back into place, and he looked up and recognized Dr. Newman standing over him and taking his pulse. An IV was attached to one of his arms, and every inch of him hurt.
“Cas. Shut up,” Dean said. He turned back around to face Mortimer. “Naomi has to die. Fine. We’ll get rid of anything to do with the state, but Superbia is gonna govern itself.”
“Did Sam tell everyone to watch me?” asked Cas, because Naomi or not, there was something in him that was hardwired not to accept anything nice in his life. Charlie was his friend, of course. But she was more Sam’s and Dean’s than she would ever be his, and that meant she would lie to his face if it meant keeping them safe.
“That’s… that’s not true,” said Cas, looking at Charlie as he said it. She stared back at him, not agreeing or disagreeing, looking a little lost for words. “I’m not.”
“Could be important,” she says. She took the picture on impulse, but she tends to trust those. Her gut is the thing that has kept her (mostly) alive, and after everything Sam has told her, she’s pretty sure the house is tied into the case somehow. Mary Winchester, rest her soul again, had haunted the Winchester family home for decades before she’d been released. Sure, their next stop is the cemetery and with any luck burning the bodies will do the trick and stop people from mysteriously disappearing. But if it doesn’t, well… she prefers to have something to look through for hints before the monsters know she’s on their trail.
“Hi Jo,” she says loudly. She then turned to Cas, looked him up and down, and waved at him too. “Hi.”
“I’m not,” said Mandy, winking at Cas. “You’re welcome back anytime. Anytime.”
“Despair,” Castiel finished for him.
“I won’t use, Dean,” Cas said. “Not ever. As for the rest… you wouldn’t refuse a man hope would you? The chances of my escaping these consequences is miniscule. Don’t deny me what little comfort I can take for myself that the odds might be with me.”
“Hey Blondie,” said a voice from outside. A girl poked her head around the tent, her large brown eyes flicking warily from Kaia to Castiel. In her hands was a long stick, and Castiel had the strange feeling she knew how to use it better than Claire knew how to use her gun. “How you doing?”
“My point exactly,” said Dean smoothly. “The big picture is fucking terrifying for you right now. I get that. I’ve lived that. So focus on the little things for a while. Don’t let some dumb thing I said break you. You’re better than that.”
Castiel tried to pay attention to where they were, but there was an astounding lack of street signs or any sort of grid structure to the town. The roads seemed to bleed into each other, and although he noted landmarks as they walked, he soon realized he would likely have little luck making his way back to Harvelle’s without asking instructions. Sam navigated the space easily however, and if his familiarity with the people here hadn’t already confirmed that this was a place Dean and his people frequented, that would have.
“I’m not blaming you.”
She paused a moment, looking a more personal kind of sad as she got ready to say what she had to say next.
Cas felt a wall at his back and Dean’s fingers curling up into his hair, while his other hand rested on Cas’ uninjured hip. Cas awkwardly wondered if he should put his hands somewhere, and settled on copying Dean for lack of knowledge of how he was supposed to be doing this. Just as he felt he was getting a sense of how kissing was supposed to work, he felt Dean’s tongue press against his lips. His jaw dropped in surprise, and Dean stuck his tongue into his mouth.
“Why would you want that?”
“Right,” said Dean. “You want to talk about it?”
Castiel sat, and he didn’t say anything for a long time.
“I let you live.”
“I’ll bounce back, Chief,” said Benny. “Honestly, it was worth it just to see the look on this fucker’s face.”
“Yeah, well,” says Dean. “At least I did something about it.”
“Better they were enemies than what they are now,” muttered Castiel.
It wasn’t a question.
“You’ll give us the ceasefire?” Dean interrupted forcefully. Azazel nodded. “Fine. You’re shooting yourself in the foot as far as Naomi’s concerned, but hey. Whatever floats you boat. Want me to take out Kelly too while I’m at it?”
“Just as well,” he said. “I can’t stay here. You know that.”
“Who invited her again?” Claire asked, sounding annoyed. Cas wasn’t sure whether or not to be relieved that she seemed to be very much in his corner. She looked at both Meg and Charlie with skepticism and suspicion, and had positioned herself in a way where she and Castiel could easily escape, if they wished. It was almost touching, especially considering just how livid she had been with him mere hours before.
“I know,” Cas said, offering his hand and letting her crush it in hers. “But you’re going to be fine. Just hold on-“
“And you know this from personal experience?” asked McCleod.
The man sighed, and spared a glance at Castiel who was still standing at attention and pretending to ignore the two of them.
“You try really hard to get people not to like you,” he asked. “Why do you think that might be?”
“Yeah, I think about them too,” says Dean. “And that pain… that pain ain’t going away. But if we don’t keep living, all that sacrifice will have been for nothing, alright?”
“Claire’s going to steal Dorothy’s motorcycle.”
It shouldn’t have been a surprise, then, to walk in and see a look of complete exhaustion on Naomi’s face. She tapped her pen against the desk as she considered her papers, glasses perched at the bottom of her nose as her eyes skimmed across what were likely reports from Libidine. Castiel sat, and decided not to feel slighted that she was ignoring him. It wasn’t as though he took pride in the work he were doing.
“Patience is gonna come too. That way we can make the drive in one go, and I can catch some sleep on the way back.”
He could feel Cas staring at him, as he finally just sat on the wet sidewalk and rested. He wondered if it would be so bad to fall asleep here. To catch cold and postpone the inevitable, somehow. Instead, Cas reached out a hand and helped haul Dean to his feet. Guardian angels were not enablers it seemed. At least not past a certain point.
“You don’t have to be sorry,” says Cas. “Dean is… Dean gets angry, too. I know that.”
Castiel stopped answering at this point. Kelly stayed silent beside him, refusing to respond or even look at Dagon. She didn’t need to for it to be obvious that Dagon had rattled her. Her fists tightened behind her back, she took a deep breath and then stared ahead again, determined.
“Nine years old,” he repeated. “And they’d already pretty much written you off as obedient and mindless, huh?”
Tamara seemed to accept that as a valid excuse and pushed herself to her feet.
“No. It’s not stupid, okay? I watched my parents burn. I heard them screaming, and I couldn’t save them. I have never stopped being scared. I’m still not okay and I don’t know if I ever will be. If Jo couldn’t wait for me to figure that out, that’s fine. But you were supposed to be my friend, and you were supposed to want to hear my side and you didn’t.”
“The general approved both of you being here?” Cas asked. Ellen and Dean exchanged glances.
“You don’t know which one’s real,” he realizes. And neither does Dean. Michael scowls at him and Dean laughs and laughs.
“I don’t really have exceptions like that,” said Rosali, with a shrug. Cas could feel that sense of oddity creeping back in, but Rosali seemed to sense it and quashed it before he could tactfully take his leave from her. “But I suppose that’s because I’m me and you’re you. There’s a lot of wrong ways to be a person, but being uninterested or interested in sex, however that works for you, isn’t one of them. Standard disclaimers applied of course.”
Castiel’s dream was sluggish, oversaturated. The kind of sleep that spoke of sedation.
“So I guess it was you talking to yourself that woke up Emma.”
“Do you still feel like a traitor?” asked Garth. Cas flinched. “Me too, man. Me too.”
“Dean is not the same…”
“Risa told me not to listen at the door,” said Trisha. “But I think secretly she wanted me to.”
“It’s not the same. I don’t hate Naomi,” said Cas. He paused a moment. “Well, I do hate her. But… she is not the problem. Not really. She’s a part of a system that isn’t working, and so was I. When you still believe in it, it’s easy to count your actions as the right thing. She isn’t a villain, she doesn’t enjoy causing pain.”
“We were on a mission…”
Sam hesitates.
It’s a few hours of aimless driving before they pull over into a small town to rest a little, and see if they can scrounge up anything to eat. Or well, that was the plan, except as soon as they get into town, Sam assigns Jack to do the scrounging (a dubious choice considering Jack’s tastes were about as refined as a normal three year old). Which leaves Dean and Sam to scoping out a place to hide out for the night, and throwing up whatever warding they think might help.
“Not bad,” said a reedy male voice. Cas, Charlie, and Dorothy whirled around to see a nebbish older man with curly gray hair surveying them. His smile was kindly, but his eyes were sharp and unfriendly. It wasn’t the most comforting of combinations. “Strong, hard workers. The boy will be malleable.”
“Trust me, I would never do such a thing,” he said quietly. “I know what it’s like to have your will not be your own. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”
“No,” said Cas, watching as the worried look deepened, the edges of Dean’s mouth pulling down into a frown. “You don’t need to worry. My eating habits won’t get in the way of you using me to take over Superbia.”
“I ain’t leaving,” said Dean stubbornly. He sat there with his arms crossed and his breathing steady enough that he could be sleeping, though Cas had a feeling he was not. When he shifted in mild discomfort, slouching further down so his head wasn’t resting on the hard top of the chair, Cas sighed and decided to try again.
“That was actually pretty funny.”
“Cas, you say another word and I’m dumping you.”
Selma’s expression did interesting things when presented with that information. She settled on a polite smile after trying out twelve alternate emotions. Castiel felt somewhat poorly for knowing both about Selma’s feeling without her permission and also knowing that Selma’s feelings were unlikely to ever be returned by Risa.
“I don’t-“
“Yeah, I saw,” Sam said, flicking his head back to indicate the small crater that had been left after their most recent experiment. “Seeing that makes me wish we could break into a state lab. See what you girls can really do.”
There was, of course, the consideration of what he should do if the elevator started to go up again…
“Makes sense,” said Lydia. “Benny’s too soft to stay pissed at you for distracting our leader the slightest bit.”
“It’ll be fine,” said Gabriel. He had coalesced into one person again. Castiel decided to take that as a good sign. “You need to go to the hospital.”
Claire turned around, desperately trying to think of something that would buy her time. Coming up with nothing, she decided to wing it.
“But Balthazar, Remiel, Hael, I’m sure they’re very safe. Even if the Resistance doesn’t figure out who they are,” he said coldly. “It’s not as if Dean killed the last group of prisoners who had the misfortune to be locked up with him.”
“Not seriously enough,” said Benny. “Just don’t tell him I said that. Not in the mood for a fight.”
Cas hadn’t wanted Jack to come along for the mission. When Dean had suggested it, he had all but threatened to all but sabotage any attempt at recon Dean would make. Unfortunately, Dean was smart enough to inform Jack that he wanted him along, but wasn’t sure if he was ‘mature’ enough, and that had lit a fire under Jack until it was the only thing he spoke about. Gadreel, who obviously considered himself something of a father figure to Jack, had nearly broken his rock solid composure and threatened Dean when he learned of this, but there was no stopping an intrepid (read stupid) teenager with something to prove. It was made doubly worse, in Cas’ humble opinion, because Jack looked up to Castiel. Why he couldn’t fathom, but it made him feel like all of his actions were under a microscope, and whatever stories soldiers had been trading had created expectations entirely too high for him to meet.
“I was… inbetween,” he says at last. “Mid-stroke from Barcelona, returning to Heaven.”
Dean was quiet a moment, before leaning more firmly into Cas’ side.
The words got caught in his throat and he didn’t quite know why. When he looked up, he was surprised to see something softening in the expressions of the people around him. Bobby criticized his choice in clothing and asked if he could possibly be warm enough, and Ellen brought him more food to eat (with Gabriel loudly asking if he could have more too, and being shot down with a look). Jody was more subtle, but she still seemed to be more sympathetic to him than before. Castiel wondered just what he’d done.
“Stay away from me,” says Jack, but he only says it as a warning. Doesn’t stop Cas from looking as if he’s been slapped. “I can feel- I can’t feel anymore. It’s like-”
“You’re awake,” Charlie said, smiling down at him.
“What happened to letting me wallow in my own insignificance?” Chuck says, scowling at all of them. “Oh look, Castiel’s back. Again. Still can’t even kick the bucket right. Kinda undercuts your last great sacrifice, doesn’t it? For the record, I’m definitely killing you off in my rewrite.”
“Sure, but I wanted to surrender,” said Dean, insistent. “Either way I wasn’t just going to leave you there, but seeing him do that to you…”
“No. Keep insulting my foster sister,” said Kaia sarcastically. “How dare she have a crush on a boy. The inhumanity.”
“Why would you do that?” Jack asks. He finds himself intensely curious about Cas now. He wants to know the why of everything. Cas has always been a good father to him, but he wonders now if he never really thought about what it meant that Cas was someone else before he was born. That he is someone separate from Jack who chose to be in Jack’s life and probably had to change for him. All Jack had ever seen was his dad.
“Did you actually think I would consider that for even a second?”
“I could not die with you, for one must wait to shut the other’s gaze down. You could not,” read Dean. “And I, could I stand by and see you freeze, without my right of frost, Death’s privilege?”
Benny stopped what he was doing and looked at Castiel with an expression somewhere between irritation and spite. He crossed his arms and looked Castiel up and down.
“See that right there. That is classified as talking. Stop it. I’m mad at you.”
Unfortunately, that means the crocotta is once again up a weapon. And one that can hurt Cas too. Back to square one.
“No, no, no, you are not coming with me, Cas.”
“What happened?” he asked, attempting to cut through the bullshit. He watched as papers were shuffled in front of his superior’s hands and wondered if she would actually bother to answer him. He was surprised when he realized she was planning to, as sharing confidential information with him could be potentially dangerous.
No one spoke to him as he walked through camp. Even people he was friendly with, who usually offered a wave and a hello, caught sight of him and pretended not to notice. Cas suspected it was something in his expression. To an outsider, it might look like he was on the war path. The truth wasn’t much better.
‘I’m special,’ Eileen signs, a little flippant.
“Sanctus is safe for now, and we don’t think Zachariah has future plans to attack it. However, we are going to have to leave to keep the image of their innocence in tact, which Dean has worked very hard to create. The effects of the gas are wearing off on everyone as we speak, and you are far from the only person who was affected.”
“I’m hurting you,” says Jack, but he hugs Dean back. Lets himself be comforted. Like he can’t help it.
“A promise of my choosing,” she tells him. “One that’s gonna be hard to keep. One you won’t know the details of until you agree. And trust me when I say breaking this agreement won’t be as easy as killing me. I’ve got everything I need in place to make sure you don’t weasel your way out of another deal. So if you pick this? It’s not a problem you get to solve later. Knowing that, is this really something you want to ask me for?”
“I don’t know,” Dean said. “You’re pretty cool.”
“Three days. Your wound was infected,” said Hannah. “I can’t believe you’re really here.”
Cas wasn’t sure he would have labeled it one of his happiest memories at the time, but in retrospect he’d viewed it with fondness. Remembered the way Dean had fallen asleep halfway through, and his features had softened, and he’d woken up just in time for Cas to wonder why the movie didn’t have a happy ending, something he’d been certain humans were rather fond of.
“Billie split us,” says Amara, but she corrects herself a moment later. “Well, no. We split ourselves, she just… introduced conflict. I wanted creation and destruction to coexist, a single force. But Jack and I were too different, wanted different things.”
“What do you mean?”
“Joshua, you know Azazel better than the rest of us. Would he buy it?”
The four of them looked at each other. Alicia spoke next, rapid fire.
“Yes, well,” said Cas. “I prefer a hands on education, I suppose.”
Charlie gasped for air and scrambled away, coughing on every other breath. Castiel ignored her in favor of making sure that he was keeping the pressure even on Meg who was doing her best to escape the hold he had her in. He waited until she went limp and then let her go, stopping to check her pulse. He needed to make absolutely certain she was alive. Having affirmed this, Castiel went back to Charlie to make sure she hadn’t suffered any life threatening injuries.
Castiel frowned in question and didn’t have to wait long for an answer. Jessica was the one speaking now.
“Are you mad at yourself?”
**********
“It’s been twenty five years and he hasn’t failed us yet,” Jo pointed out. “People change Cas. You should know.”
He left her there, knowing what that would mean. She had shaken her head. She wanted to stay.
“We still are,” Pam stressed. “Come inside. We’ll explain everything.”
Ash relaxed so quickly Castiel wondered if perhaps it was an unfair advantage for him to be good friends with such a likable person. There was a reason Dean asked Jo to do all of the recruiting. She was unrelentingly friendly and quick to put people at ease when she needed to.
Everything was green.
“I could cut these bits off next,” he said, gesturing towards Castiel’s crotch. “From what I hear about Naomi’s little tin soldiers, you don’t need them anyway. Or I could cut off your nose. Pop out an eye. What do you think?”
“Yup,” said Charlie. “It is what it is. But it helps if his underlings think he’s being difficult with Dean and not just giving him everything he wants. And it helps even more if Dean isn’t available, because that removes pretty much all incentive for Crowley to be nice to him. And that is where you come in.”
“Your grandma called,” said Dean. “I was wondering how long it would take you to find it.”
The glimmer of sobriety Castiel had been reaching for harshened into the bright light of day.
“Nice story, chief,” Benny said sarcastically. Castiel wondered if he had ever wanted to punch someone more in his entire life.
*************
Blearily, Castiel looked up to see Dean turning off the light before settling in the chair next to him. Dean waggled his fingers in a silent hello, then leaned back so his head was resting against the back of the chair and his frame was slumped against it.
“Then why do you look like you just got locked in an outhouse with Gordon Walker and a machete?”
Which was a fair point, Castiel had to admit. He adjusted his arm, which had tingles running up and down it so that he regained a certain amount of blood flow. Dean resettled with him, his arm now flung across Cas’ chest.
They are all for a moment shocked into silence. Castiel didn’t know that was a thing that could be done. It is not something he would have thought of, not in a million years. That the only real way to change things, the only real way to move forward, was to give up power and influence in such a profound way and this fact had failed to occur to him… it bothers him. Why was he in Heaven? What was he trying to do there? What was he trying to build?
“If I’m understanding this correctly,” Castiel said. “There’s going to be some kind of celebration tomorrow.”
He started laughing too loudly around Cas, and he mentioned the car he was driving every other sentence. The car was a monstrosity of cannibalized parts fit together and spray painted black, the original make, model, and shape of the car completely obscured. The state only made jeeps and other vehicles suited for military movement, and civilians that could find the parts to make and deal with the upkeep of their own cars were rare. The fact that Dean had done so and apparently by himself in the years between his escaping prison and finding his mother (which Cas had only just learned was a missing period of time in his knowledge of Dean’s story) was impressive, but Cas didn’t really consider it news worth sharing several times a day. Even if Dean did look handsomely excited every time he brought it up.
“You’d be an angel,” Castiel said, trying to make Anna laugh again. Trying not to panic as the light started fading from her eyes. “Anna?”
“Will you come to poker if I let you keep the blanket?”
“Unless you asked nicely. Then she might have,” he said.
Cas doesn’t correct him, just grins as Dean pretends to recoil from the cat batting at the carrier door. He sneezes a second later, loudly enough to set off a new round of hissing. Dean rolls his eyes, and then reaches out a hand so Cas can help him up. Scuffing off the knees of his jeans, he looks at Cas closely, like he is trying to find something wrong. Cas does his best to keep his expression bland, loose. Silence stretches between them long enough that Dean feels the need to break it.
Except when Sam looks over at Dean, he has a look on his face. Like he’s just figured something out that’s been bothering him. Sam raises an eyebrow at him, silently asking what it is. Dean catches the look, but just looks away from Sam. As if he’s ashamed of something. It’s not the first time Dean’s had a secret he didn’t want Sam to know, but the last time he got so quiet about something… well that had been a lifetime ago it feels like. Back when he’d first gotten back from Hell and he’d tried to live with what he’d done there.
“Okay,” said Cas, trying to clear his mind of the worst of his own thoughts and focus only on the most important objective. He needed to see to it that his friends were safe. Whatever problems he had with what Dean had done did not matter now, and wouldn’t not matter until such a time as that objective was completed. Until then, it was pointless to be angry at a man he loved that, for all he knew, he would never see again. “Charlie, please tell me there is some sort of plan.”
“What about you?” asked the woman, slowly.
“You have to get out of here, right?” she says. He nods, hesitant. “Go.”
“You want me to do what?” Gabriel shouted, turning to look at Castiel in amazement.
“You, Dean Winchester, agree upon winning Superbia that you will hand over the city to the Kingdom of Canada, along with all resources available in the city. Citizens will be given the choice to relocate or become subjects of the Kingdom of Canada. Any and all prisoners of war will be the responsibility of Mary Winchester. Should this agreement not be upheld, the person in breach of the contract offers their life as forfeit.”
“And then you’ll go on a date with me?” Claire asked. Jesse sat up and shook off the chill of the evening air.
“Since when do you-?”
“I was just trying to lighten the mood,” muttered Gabriel, before pouring himself some of his father’s wine. He missed his older brother wincing, or he might have thought twice about drinking it. As it was, Michael attempted to salvage the situation as best as he could.
Patience retreats to the hallway for some privacy and Sam lets her leave. This is it.
“Can I?” Dean asks. Mary glares at him. “Please.”
“Yeah, well,” Charlie said, sounding incredibly put out at this point. “Dean and Sam like to read. So we’re encouraged to trade for books when we can.”
“Yeah, I get the picture,” Dean says. “Jack’s a confused kid with a weird as fuck upbringing. It’s a miracle he was such a good kid in the first place, plus all that juice and everything that comes with it, well…”
“You have to,” said Cas. “I’m not an ally, I’m a liability. The sooner you understand that, the better.”
“Everything is accounted for,” Castiel said efficiently. Selma waited a moment to see if he would go on, and her shoulders slumped a little when he didn’t.
“I need to keep-“ Castiel said, cutting himself off. “I can’t just forget the things I’ve done.”
“You probably won’t remember this part,” says Cas, voice even. “But it seems I’ll have to make an appearance in a more physical form if I want you to survive. Which, unfortunately, I do, more than anything else in the world apparently. So you’ll remember that.”
“You going to answer me, or is this the silent treatment?” asked Dean. When Cas didn’t answer immediately, he reached out and carefully turned Cas’ face so he had to look at him. Cas sighed, unable to tell if he was winning or losing or what sort of game they were even playing anymore.
“It’s fine,” says Mary. “So. How are my boys?”
“Who?” Corbett asked as everyone else slowly realized what that meant.
JANUARY 12, 111 A.L. - SANCTUS (15 MILES OUTSIDE INVIDIA)
“Sam told me about Jack when he called about you staying here, but… Is Cas okay?”
Dean turned the page and started on the next poem and then the next. Castiel slowly drifted between waking and sleeping, and a thread through each was the steady cadence of familiar words spoken by a familiar voice.
“Bring up Lydia one more fucking time-“
“You can’t,” she said. “You have the sight. It’s why he decided to keep you.”
“Because you think you love me?” Cas asked, ignoring the sharp glance Dean gave him. “You don’t. Jo just put the idea in your head.”
“You’ll be okay, Anael,” he told her softly. Offering the only thing he had left to give. “It’s just like going to sleep.”
The next hour was spent answering a series of exhaustive questions about everything Cas knew about what he’d been given, detailing the effects, going through the timeline since he had been injected (several times), and assuring them that he wasn’t currently feeling any homicidal urges.
“Not so accurate,” said Cas. “With regards to sexuality I am largely… indifferent. Except, apparently, when I am not.”
As it gets dark, they pack up and head out the cemetery, locate the graves and start digging as night sets in, working in shifts. Soon enough they’ve uncovered side by side coffins and smash in the pine covers to reveal the rotted flesh and bones beneath. Eileen always says a short prayer when she does this, despite… well everything she now knows. It’s habit more than belief, her Catholic upbringing getting the better of her. But it feels right to say something. Not an apology, but an acknowledgement. It’s rough work, unearthing the dead. Even if they’re not exactly peaceful.
“In my experience, I’m fine is just a socially acceptable way of saying I don’t feel like talking about it,” Jo pointed out. Castiel supposed that was true, but in the end it didn’t matter whether or not he was fine. If he was doing his job, then he was doing the right thing. He just had to remember that.
Castiel stared her down a moment, trying to determine the veracity of her claim. She didn’t blink or otherwise betray herself.
Naomi paused then, pressing a button on her screen which caused it to switch directions. Castiel could see himself and Jo present on the screen.
“Luckily, I don’t need your loyalty anymore,” said Naomi. “I just need you take out as much of the resistance as you can before they kill you. And there are so many ways we’ve found to compel people to do as we wish.”
“No.”
“You made your bed. Sleeping bag. Whatever,” Benny said, also excusing himself to go and do something useful.
“Looks like,” she says. “I think the new God felt pity for me. Whatever his reasoning, we came to an agreement.”
“No, duh,” she said. “I mostly swing the other way, if you know what I mean. But, hey, when you look like the way I do and men are reliably lust driven idiots, you take your advantages where you can get them. And it’s not like I wouldn’t have taken advantage, if you’d ever shown any interest. Tall, dark, and handsome is a good look on anyone. I just kinda figured we played for different teams.”
“You going to give him the business, too?” Dean asks. Bobby just stares at him. “Don’t think you’ve got me fooled for a second, old man. You were too scared to have kids when you still could, and I’m the closest thing you ever got. But you know what fuck it. You aren’t my fucking father and it’s about time you stopped acting like it.”
content warning: body horror, mild descriptions of torture (on par with the show)
“It’s just that,” says Dean. “I love my dad.”
“Don’t be such a jerk,” said Charlie. “And… and you owe me a huge favor.”
“That makes me feel… marginally better I guess,” says Charlie. “Chuck just would straightwash me though. Anyway, I’m alive again. So I’m gonna go get really drunk. Any takers for company?”
“Yeah. Stuff,” she said, raising an eyebrow just a little. Castiel realized what she meant and glared at her.
The back of Sam’s body is badly burned, the skin black in places and angry, red, and bubbling in others. It’s bad enough that the burns are probably what killed him, but he might have suffocated when he was buried under the rubble. It’s all Eileen can do not to vomit as she thinks about it. She turns Sam over, and his face is remarkably untouched. The fabric on the front of the t-shirt he wore to bed isn’t even singed. Despite herself, Eileen checks for pulse.
“It would be part of a larger report. If you’re planning on manipulating Azazel into siding with Zachariah, I can ensure Naomi believes that was his plan all along, and I returned as a result. It would constitute an emergency.”
“I think… Jack when you became God, you had already had your soul restored but it was… It was a recreation, a replacement. But going to the Empty and coming back, I believe that may have rid you entirely of part of yourself. Grace. It pulled you out of balance, infected you with a piece of the Empty instead. It wouldn’t be noticeable, while you were God. Like an itch you don’t realize you have until you scratch at it.”
Jo had been sent to reinforce this order, and Castiel had bristled even further under this treatment of him as though he were an unruly child. As though he couldn’t take care of himself and had to be shepherded from place to place.
Suffice to say, it has been a while since Rowena has focused on anything aside from maintaining her precarious position atop the throne. Not only that, but it’s not as though anyone visits. Not that she can blame them, she supposes, considering it is Hell and all. But she does wonder if it wouldn’t hurt to call every once in a while. Hell has poor reception, but it would be something to hear the garbled voices of the Winchesters or Heaven’s flightiest angel.
Balthazar’s return was met with great relief by all of them. Meg had had to make herself scarce to avoid drawing attention to them. Cas had begun to suspect she knew more about who exactly had caused everything to go so awry in Libidine and she was keeping it to herself. At one point, while Claire and Charlie had been off on a recon mission to figure out how easy gaining access to the power grid was going to be, Cas had asked her about it. She’d only smiled at him.
“You should work on being nicer. Then we can be friends like Aunt Jo and Charlie,” she said happily, looking up at Jo with the kind of admiration that Castiel was sure Jo usually appreciated instead of looking like she was about to have an aneurysm. Castiel was distracted from Jo’s expression of sheer horror when Emma thrust a hand in his face. “Pinky promise?”
The look Hannah gave him made Castiel feel very small. He may be certain in his convictions, but he would be lying if he did not admit that doubt was as constant a companion as certainty and had been for some while. The knowledge that Hannah did not possess the words nor the opportunity to sway him back to her side didn’t matter. All she had to do was look at him for Castiel to know how far apart they had grown.
Castiel nodded, looking toward the window and determining that it was a few hours until morning yet. He looked back at Selma and cleared his throat.
And just like that Dean felt unstuck in time. Like it was five years ago and Sam was possessed and it was Kevin asleep in the other room instead of Eileen. The feeling passed, leaving Dean unsteady, nauseous, and angry.
“I see,” said Castiel.
FEBRUARY 20, 111 A.L. - IRA
“I could ask her to lace your bowl with laxatives or something. Jody’s discreet like that.”
“What do you want to know?” Castiel asked. Charlie opened her mouth but Dean held up a hand in a nonverbal gesture to ask for a moment to speak. Charlie nodded at him.
Metatron made them approach him with Duma nudging them closer. Metatron frowned at Cas again, focusing on the hand that was currently covering one of Charlie’s. It took Cas a moment to remember his missing finger.
“Don’t,” Dean says before Cas can open his mouth.
“What do you want?” he asks. He wonders if Lydia or Victor are going to answer. He’s not sure which of them he’s more angry at.
She would break out someday, of that he was certain. She was smart, and she would learn and it wasn’t his job to teach her, but by god he wished he could. He wished he could save every man, woman, and child here, taken in by Chuck’s words.
Kaia hides a smile as she goes back to painting her sigil. Claire doesn’t see it, but Castiel does. There is a strange feeling in his chest, watching these two girls be so careful with one another. Even their disputes are gentle, teasing. It is not lost on Castiel that they seem to be very in love with one another. He is happy that Claire has found someone to give so much of herself to, and who seems to return herself in equal measure.
But before the thoughts can linger, turn into something a little more like a plan, there’s a knocking on the door. Five minutes are up.
“You didn’t have to say that you told me so when I admitted I got played,” Dean shouts at him. “You didn’t have to condescend down your freakishly big fucking nose at me. Like I was an idiot. You could’ve heard me out. Any one of you could have heard me out.”
Castiel couldn’t kill him.
“Yeah, sure they don’t. Everything’s rainbows and sunshine. You’ve got your shit together, and Charlie and I are going to work things out some day, and Azazel’s brain is still inside his skull,” said Jo. “I could go all day. Want to hear more lies, Cas?”
Dean laughed, a mixture of disbelief and sheer exhaustion.
“Sometimes,” he admitted. “I don’t know what she looks like anymore. But I remember the things she said to me. It seemed important. She’s dead now.”
“Ladies, ladies,” said the man Cas presumed was Max. “None of you look pretty.”
He asks her about it one day. She doesn’t deny it.
JUNE 16, 2163 CE - 400 MILES FROM LIBIDINE
Mary Winchester herself putting in a personal aside to the new boss had not factored into Billie’s calculations, and she’s not entirely pleased with that development. She reminds herself to keep an eye on it, because as ever a Winchester would be primed to disrupt her carefully laid plans. And unlike the three idiots still living and breathing on Earth, she doesn’t have leverage to use against Mary, if it comes to that.
“I know,” said Castiel reaching out to grip his friend’s forearm. “Balt, you know that you were my best friend, don't you?”
“Maybe in a while, Jess,” said Sam, cutting her off. “Could you go get Cordy? I’ll take Cas’ vitals while you’re gone.”
Cas took deep breaths pretending to be asleep. After Charlie had ad-libbed her way into placing Cas into the role she was supposed to play, the day had gone by in something of a blur of trying to soothe McCleod’s ego at every turn. Cas had been a brief interest for him before he had decided it would be more entertaining to make himself as disagreeable as possible. Dean had slowly but surely lost his patience, and, if anything, that was the first time McCleod seemed even remotely interested in what was going.
“Fine,” said Dean. He looked Selma right in the eye, and focused the full force of his attention on her. She seemed to instantly straighten under his attention, and Castiel wondered what it would be like to have such a gravity about you that people sat up and took notice when you did something as small as look at them. It was an important quality to have in a leader, he thought. Anna had been very similar, though she had used her powers of persuasion more subtly.
“They’d judge us, how? For you served Heaven, you know, or sought to. I could not because you saturated sight, and I had no more eyes for sordid excellence as Paradise. And were you lost, I would be, though my name rang loudest on the heavenly fame. And were you saved, and I condemned to be where you were not, that self were hell to me,” said Dean in response. Cas closed his eyes. “So we must keep apart, you there, I here, with just the door ajar that oceans are, and prayer, and that pale sustenance-“
Both Charlie and Ash looked at him, along with their underlings who had obviously already been eavesdropping on the fight. Castiel identified Frank, Sarah, and Kevin along with those who must be working under Ash. They all looked highly entertained, which added a little to Cas’ confusion because this could not be a productive work environment.
“You’re a spy for the resistance, and you’ve seen me. Never,” said Chuck. The honesty was a surprise. Cas was beginning to see hints of a discerning intelligence that Chuck kept beneath the surface. And then there was…
“You got away,” Kelly said excitedly. “I didn’t think… I wasn’t sure-“
“Okay,” says Castiel. “What would you like to do?”
She’d only just disappeared from sight before reinforcements arrived.
It occurred to Cas while they were setting up camp that night, and he caught himself humming that damn song for the umpteenth time, that he really hadn’t considered just how stupid he was being. Dean, for all his other faults, was perceptive and did genuinely want what was best for the people around him. Maybe he was only interested in Cas for the potential sex and maybe there was something else there, but in the end it hardly mattered. Dean had a daughter he needed to keep safe and Cas had been a threat to that in the past and, for all Dean knew, could be a threat in the future. Or at least Cas could be if he had any future to speak of. There isn’t much use entertaining feelings for the man your mother might sentence to execution in order to slake the blood thirst that would follow the resistance’s victory. And with the way Cas fell to pieces after Anna’s death (with the way he was still falling to pieces), questioning what Cas could emotionally handle wasn’t uncalled for. The conclusion wasn’t hard to draw. Dean might want to start something (at the very least physical) with Cas, but he wasn’t going to pursue it.
“Were?” Sam asks. Neither Amara nor Chuck looks at him, too busy glaring daggers at each other. Eileen is about as confused as he is, and well that makes sense. Not like he’s gone into much detail with her about how the end of the world went down. Claire and Patience likewise seem to be mostly out of the loop. Considering they’re trusting Patience to get them out of whatever is about to happen, this is a little concerning.
“You didn’t,” he acknowledged. When Selma’s suspicious squint continued, he determined it was best if the subject was changed. “I’ve noticed Jo has been getting better. Not that she wasn’t good before.”
“You can’t just come back and announce one thing like that. You have to realize how suspicious that would look.”
“You’re never going to let that go, are you?”
“Oh, great,” Dean muttered to himself. “I’m not going to like this, am I?”
Dean’s eyebrows scrunched together as he thought about it.
They all shift uneasily under her scrutiny, except Patience. Cas watches as her hands shake, her eyes gone far away. Like she’s waiting for her vision to come true. Like she can’t quite believe it until it does. And Cas has an inkling, what deal Billie is offering them. The promise they are meant to keep, and the carrot she is brandishing before them in exchange for their good behavior. He senses the stick too, what punishment there is for breaking this agreement.
“We don’t want to end our alliance,” said Billy. “And we don’t want to hurt you. We see a place for you, Dean. You could be a part of building a new world.”
“I know,” she said, as if it were obvious. “You feel better?”
“Cas-”
“Well, if it’s for a girl,” the boy said, a mite sarcastically, though his expression did soften a fraction. Dean took it as encouragement to go on.
“Yeah, get Alex on the phone. Tell her we might need to see that doctor who takes patients that can’t go into the system,” she says. Before Kaia can protest that she’s fine, Claire nods over her shoulder and clarifies. “I think Dean’s pretty fucked up.”
“Nothing too big has changed yet,” Patience confirms. Good to know the stop hasn’t set anything bad in motion. “I’d get moving sooner rather than later though.”
He hates it. He wants to leave.
Dean didn’t take that news well. It was clear he was both angry and hurt that Maggie and Corbett would just leave like that, without a word. He’d always been outspoken in defending them, especially Corbett, and it had to hit him a little hard that they would leave just like that.
“You were fucking delirious.”
“Lesser of two evils,” he decided after a while. “And the opportunity to make things better.”
“I mean, he was a little drunk too,” she conceded. “But yeah. When Gabriel called and told us what you were trying to do, we all thought you were an idiot. And hey, can’t argue with those results. But, uh…”
After eating a dinner substantial enough that he wouldn’t be affected by hunger the next day, Castiel lowered the seat of the car Naomi had provided for him and did his best to sleep.
It was relatively easy to scale for Castiel, and once he was settled on the roof he used his binoculars to see what was happening. The five cars were indeed stopped a good distance outside town. They all seemed to be circling around one car, though Castiel couldn’t tell what they were doing to it. He turned on his radio so he could speak to Benny.
“Cas.”
Castiel felt himself bristle, almost against his will at her implication that he was somehow underperforming on purpose. As though he didn’t want to assist her in any way he could and be sent back to his garrison.
“Fine,” said Dean sweeping past Pamela through the door. Benny rushed off behind him, with Garth and Rosali on their heels. Cas followed with his fellow former soldiers and Dorothy took up the rear.
“In Libidine? Or here?”
“It makes me feel slightly better.”
Dean’s eyes opened slowly. He looked at Cas like he was trying to see right through him, and his hands twitched restlessly even as his face was set into a more stoic expression.
“His highness, I mean,” said Dean. Jo snickered. “You wanna be demoted, Harvelle?”
“We don’t know who they have,” she’d confided almost immediately. “Best guess is that they found something they know Azazel wants to keep to himself when we raided one of the buildings we know he frequents. There’s been heavy back and forth since… since the fire. But ever since we got our newest captives it’s just stopped.”
“I won’t make promises I can’t keep,” said Dr. Newman. “But if I don’t deem it a medical necessity… I’ll keep you off general anesthetics.”
“I know you can. I’m saying that I’m not going to let you,” said Dean. “And maybe I shouldn’t have asked in the first place. I just figured-“
“Because you love simply,” said the boy. “Without hesitation and complication and fear. I wanted a moment of that. Just to know someone could love me that way.”
“So…” she says at last, swallowing hard and stowing her switchblade. She’s silent for a couple of seconds after that, gathering her thoughts. Her hands clench into fists and Dean kinda hopes she punches him. It would be something to feel at least. “Working theory?”
She thinks of Missouri then. The grandmother she’d barely known, but couldn’t help but feel intimately connected to. The lingering remnants of faith stir inside her then, and trust in herself settles in her gut. It’s the end of the world, but Patience Turner is gonna save it. Or something like that.
“I’ve been informed,” he did, telling himself he had nothing to be ashamed of. Dean was actively working against everything he believed in. And he didn’t know this man. Still the pool of guilt grew as Dean grinned at him, clapped him on the shoulder, and told Castiel to let him know if Benny gave him anymore trouble.
“I’d like to be alone,” he told his friend. Selma nodded at him, accepting that without questions.
Instead of dwelling on it, Castiel sat himself down far from the edge, crossed his legs, and breathed. The chasm did not disappear, but it became only an annoyance. A whisper in Castiel’s ear, quietly reminding him that it was there.
“You’re lucky it wasn’t worse,” Sam says, sitting down heavily on one of the plastic chairs against the wall of Dean’s hospital room.
“As I said, I’ve known Jo longer than you. I know her patterns.”
Castiel was yanked up by an arm under his chin so he was on his knees. His head was pulled back and a knife pressed just so against his neck.
*************
“Got distracted before a hunt. But I dunked the plate in some bleach and ran it through the dishwasher a couple of times before I ate off it again, so,” says Dean. Which is still gross, thank you very much, thinks Claire. Dean seems to notice her a second later, but he looks a little to the left of her, which isn’t a great sign. “Claire, how are you doing, kiddo?”
“We got five gallons of it three days ago, and that was the day Dean said you were actually pretty coherent. After that we tried weening you off it, but we went too fast and you started going into withdrawal again. I think we’re starting to get it right,” said Sam, letting out a big breath.
Castiel wondered what Hael and Remiel were doing right now. He wondered who had been put in charge of the garrison. With him and Anna gone, he supposed the position should go to Uriel, but secretly he hoped Balthazar had been put in charge. Then again, that was mostly for petty reasons, and the fact that Castiel liked Balthazar better.
“And?” Dean asks, unsure where exactly this is going. If Cas wants to leave, well that’s… That’s on him but he can spare Dean the details. Not like choosing Jody of all people to be neighbors with isn’t going to put a dent in Dean’s social life, but that’s what happens when most of your friends are no longer of the living variety. He wonders how Jody’s gonna feel about Cas getting her in the divorce.
“I guess I can’t blame you for that,” she said. Of course there were a lot of other people who would, but Castiel would deal with that when he had to.
“You want to drive?” he said, suspicious.
Castiel supposed he could see Dean’s point. If Zachariah were committed enough to gaining traction in a bid for power, it might be inevitable for him to act aggressively against resistance forces. That being said, Dean’s actions certainly solidified the chances of a confrontation, and even if it was to protect everyone here, it was hard not to see how it would ultimately be counted as a win for the resistance if they defied Zachariah on this front.
“Should’ve taken him up on it and sent him back bullshit. Might’ve been entertaining. Then again, you’re a shitty liar, so-“
Castiel looked down at his severed finger sarcastically. Naomi almost smiled.
Castiel agreed to do this, because Dean seemed very interested in sleeping on the mattress (something about memory foam, whatever that was) and comfort was not as important to him as it seemed to be to Dean. If he could sleep at all, and especially if he could sleep without dreaming, he would be happy.
Jody and Donna have to drag in a fold up table from the garage to make room for everyone, and the girls end up playing musical chairs to see who gets to spend dinner in the shitty plastic ones (Alex and Kaia take one for the team). Dean has to sit at the end so he has room for his leg to hang awkwardly out to the side in his plaster cast. There’s a cushion on his chair that Jody got without him asking (because apparently he’s not as good at hiding his pain as he used to be, and that vamp really fucked up his back). Miracle wanders under the table, resting his head on everyone’s laps and whining for leftovers only Donna is soft enough to slip him.
“Whatever,” said Trisha, playing off the moment of tension. “I can deal, if you can.”
Then he got to the bottom.
West Canada was, in fact, very cold.
“I’ll be sure not to,” he had said. And they moved on to other subjects.
“No, stop it,” says Cas. “As if I would trade a second-”
“So when you say you want me, you mean the whole getting married, having two kids, and dying in Florida thing,” he says. Cas has no idea what the fuck he’s talking about, so he just glares at Dean until he explains. “I mean… it’s not just like an angel thing. You meant it the way humans mean it when they say they wanna be with someone.”
“He’s not gonna cool off,” says Dean.
It especially rankled because Castiel had provided the information that inspired this particular idea. When they had gathered in the main square of Sanctus, it had been only by sheer will that Dean had kept the growing crowd from panicking again after having recovered from being exposed to Sweet Dreams. He had a talent for managing people and a solid plan in place, which had eventually seemed to lower the level of terror Sanctus was currently experiencing.
“How are we doing?” Claire asks her.
“I won’t tell anyone what you said,” Castiel reassured him instantly, realizing just how horrifying it must be for Samandriel to reveal his thoughts like this only to realize the other person might very well use them against him. “But your place is working under Hannah in our garrison. Don’t forget that.”
“I see the problem,” he says. “I can put it back the way it was.”
“Let’s get it over with then,” said Dean. They walked up the steps, armed and ready to shoot and no one stopped them. Cas felt himself worrying more and more as they got close to the doors. It was a little anticlimactic when they opened and Pamela was standing in front of them, sunglasses flashing in the afternoon light.
“Oh,” says Cas. And then it really hits him. The reason Dean isn’t there in memory is because this place isn’t Cas’ alone. It’s theirs, it’s shared. “Oh.”
“Castiel,” she said, voice betraying both wariness and excitement in equal measure. “You’re awake.”
“How could I possibly be offended by that?” asked Cas, getting as much milage out of his dryness as possible to keep Jo on her toes as to whether or not he meant it. If the smirk she aimed at him was anything to go by, she wasn’t worried about his opinion of her.
Rosali looked heavenward.
“Yeah,” he says. “Yeah, okay.”
“It was Dean, you idiot,” said Benny incredulously. “You are unbelievably dim witted, anyone ever told you that?”
JANUARY 8, 111 A.L. - 30 MILES OUTSIDE INVIDIA
The timer had indeed counted down to zero. Alistair, who had respectfully moved to the side while Naomi and Castiel spoke, was back with what looked to be the equivalent of an ice cream scooper. Castiel thrashed against the chair, trying to break something, anything to get free.
Another set of deadbolts clicked into place on the already heavily armored doors. Cas blinked. This could not be happening, he thought to himself in unmitigated horror.
“Castiel,” said Samandriel slowly. “You can’t mean that. What she’s doing is wrong. We’re supposed to serve the state, not a city and not a person or a crusade for power. Besides, the night Anna died… I’ve been thinking and thinking about it and I don’t understand why if the resistance had a facility like that we didn’t stop them sooner. Those children had been there for years. It had to be a state building, there’s no other explanation.”
“Okay,” Dean said, when Cas didn’t say anything else. “Okay.”
“We got lucky, Mary got us to a safe patch because she could like… see the architecture crumbling.”
“She?”
“We don’t know that for sure,” says Cas. “Hunters get hurt. Jack wouldn’t- He couldn’t-”
Dean watches as the two girls discuss the case, each carefully dipping three bronze blades in lamb’s blood and letting them dry as Alex wrinkles her nose in vague distaste. Patience points out that Alex does grosser things than that on a regular basis, and Alex retorts that lambs are babies. Not to mention she doesn’t exactly have a trauma free history where blood is concerned. Claire changes the subject and asks Patience if she has any visions to keep in mind, which she gets a negative on. Kaia ties one of the blades to a wooden staff, twirling it through her hands in a manner that is so like her counterpart, Dean blinks. But then she sets the staff down and Claire feeds her a piece of toast, and she seems like regular Kaia again.
“When will you let me leave?”
“Anna-“
“No.”
“Yes,” he said. The moment he had decided he was running to the edge of the roof and quickly scaling the building. He stopped at each person he saw, most of whom were sobbing over illusions. It was a process to convince them of reality, and one woman had reacted so violently to Castiel trying to convince her that her child hadn’t died before her eyes that he was forced to restrain her. To anyone he could cajole into a lucid state he gave a set of instructions: Convince everyone about the hallucinations. Restrain outliers and move them to a safe location. A man and a woman Castiel had never met had already helped to do so with the woman who had reacted violently to him.
“I feel like I’ve earned it.”
“He isn’t my boyfriend-”
Claire set Dean down as gently as she could manage, but it was clear he was heavier than she was used to carrying. She pulled the mask off of her face, breathing hard. She sat down next to him, still trying to catch her breath. Dean was coughing, a horrific almost wet sound. Castiel collapsed on the ground next to him, haphazardly pushing Dean from laying on his back to on his side. Claire helped after a moment, positioning Dean’s leg and arm so that he wouldn’t roll all the way over onto his stomach. The cough devolved into gagging, and Dean threw up acrid bile onto the blacktop side alley they’d found themselves in.
“Yeah. Not in the cities or anything, but half of the state’s population live in rural areas, and there’s not much oversight. We have a pretty decent selection of books, actually,” said Charlie with a smile. “And you’re going to read this if I have to tie you to a chair and read it to you.”
JULY 6, 2163 CE - 20 MILES FROM LIBIDINE
“How did it go?”
“No-” Jack surfaces for a moment.
“Really? How?”
“The city changes management instead of being defeated,” Castiel had said. “The resistance accept the change and-“
Jo’s eyes started to clear.
“I wasn’t confused,” said Cas. “Naomi was trying to make me loyal to her, but my actions were never to protect her. It wasn’t the drugs making me spy on you. Everything I did, I did to get back to my garrison. I was never on your side while you knew me, Charlie. Not once.”
“Like I hope you’re happy or whatever, but don’t expect me to be thrilled about it,” she says. Well and one more thought. “Alex is gonna be pissed when she finds out you had sex on her bed, though.”
“Dying is harder than it looks,” she says to him seriously. “But you are going to die someday. You know that right?”
“Yes. Thank you for asking.”
“Let them go,” Azazel said after a moment. One of his guards went to cut the ropes from both Dagon and Ramiel. Ramiel immediately asked if he could leave and made some mention about going back to the lab and catching up on his reading. Dagon, on the other hand…
“Yep. Girl loves straight girl who loves sad gay man. It’s like Twelfth Night,” said Charlie.
Dean didn’t say anything, but he did walk up to Castiel and drag him away from the others to a side room. Castiel glared at where Dean was yanking at his arm, but that didn’t stop him before he’d closed a door between them and the others. Castiel wondered what the point of privacy was when it was very urgent they switched tactics quickly.
Charlie trailed off at the end, looking pensive.
“I know how you meant it,” said Benny. “I’m just telling you that I know when to keep my hands to myself. You really want to know what Dean offered me to help him get out? A new start far away from that hell hole, and hell if I knew if he was going to follow through with that. I probably would’ve deserved it if he’d slit my throat on the way out. I hoped I could get out along with him, and figured if I died trying that was about what I was owed.”
Castiel had only added to this that garrisons acted as units, and would care more about each other than about other garrisons. If they wanted to hinder every garrison, they needed at least one hostage from every garrison. The state organized itself by having supervising commanders in times of conflict that required multiple garrisons to work together on a single assignment, but this was more for coordination than an actual attempt to work in harmony with each other. If the garrisons were attacked uniformly, there would be more success.
Meanwhile, Claire and Patience are holed up in the kitchen, biding their time. Patience had been a little angry at Claire, for telling him something big was about to happen, especially since the first thing Dean did when they got back on the road was tell Cas. Apparently it introduced new variables, made the decisions they were going to make less clear. Made it harder for Patience to figure out which route to go. Especially because she doesn’t know why some stuff works and some stuff doesn’t, and refuses to go into any details with anybody. It’s like she’s playing some kind of internal chess game except all the pieces have a mind of their own and the rules are a secret and you’re playing against the gameboard somehow. Or that’s how Patience had put it, before Claire called her a nerd and also worked in a story about how Patience used to do chess competitively but had to quit because knowing every move your opponent is gonna make before they make it is unfair. Dean was pretty sure Claire was trying and failing to rag on her by calling Patience too principled or something.
“You could-”
“Lydia will do fine,” he said, and Dean nodded gratefully before Benny continued. “But I’m not taking Corbett. Risa says she can train him up? Great. I personally think he’s a lost cause.”
Cas looks away from her. He does not venture a guess as to who the real enemy might be. They both know.
Castiel frowned.
Taken in by the promise of safety.
Gadreel turned to look at his other brothers.
“Mostly it’s reapers going around trying to convince people to leave but- Well they won’t tell anyone where they’re going so, it’s usually a fifty fifty thing if they go or not. Or it was, but then there was the whole black goo thing. People started taking the reapers up on their offer a lot quicker after that,” she says. “So it turns out, there’s this whole other dimension called the Empty-”
“That sounds like a burden.”
“Maybe that’s a sign that you need to keep reaching.”
“Well, it’s something,” says Dean. “It’s not like I’m so much better. He died for me, that’s gotta be something. And when I remember the good stuff, it’s like… It’s almost like I can see him. Who he should have been, y’know? But if he was back and I had to actually… I don’t know. I couldn’t do it.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Castiel sincerely. “But I’m more sorry to know that you consider me reasonable collateral when it comes to getting back at her. I was under the impression we were friends.”
“Probably,” Jo agreed. “Oh, by the way, since you’re feeling better and everything… I was just wondering…?”
“His life must be quite fascinating,” Castiel said, mostly to be polite. He thought reading was fine, really. He even partook in a book on occasion, though he mostly listened to what Hael had learned. He personally enjoyed her enthusiasm more than he enjoyed dry words on pages about the lives of people he would never meet. Or cultures he would never get to experience. The only time he had been able to find any interest for the information was when Hael made it her duty to impart every piece of information she had gleaned in as short a time as possible. He and Remiel were the only ones that would actually listen to her, and Hael had always seemed quietly happy about it.
“But it wouldn’t work twice,” said Benny. “You’ve got tells, Castiel.”
“What’s that?”
“What’s going on?” she asked him. Aaron glanced at the guards and Risa pushed him. “Aaron, I have so much shit on you, and I will spill it all if you don’t-“
“Only if you’re very stupid,” says Crowley. “Or very repressed. As you happen to be both-”
“I suppose,” says Cas. Claire makes a face at him, but doesn’t push him to expand on that. “I was wondering if there is a place I can put up warding-”
Dean doesn’t bother to read it either. Instead he watches Sam’s face, visibly tensing whenever Sam or Eileen makes a notation. The others mostly skim it, though Patience seems to be doing her best to actually read the small print. Castiel can see every time her eyes glaze over and she has to start a paragraph anew. Having experience with Crowley’s “contracts,” he doesn’t blame her. They are intentionally dull.
It was nice to be sleeping in cabins again, instead of tents.
Chuck’s final and youngest son said nothing. His eyes remained fixed on his dying father, and his face remained unreadable. To look at him would chill an outsider to the bone, but the contents of his heart were not so soulless as his exterior. He had promised himself long ago he would not kill his brothers except in self defense, but he had also promised himself that he would not die at the hands Chuck’s sons. This required him to be constantly on guard from possible attack.
“Who said anything about trust? Murder’s a sin, didn’t you know?” Kaia muttered.
“It is,” says Patience, wishing people would stop phrasing it like a hypothetical. Not that every vision she has comes true, but she doesn’t get the big stuff wrong. Except when she does, she thinks, that sickening memory of Claire sobbing in Jody’s arms coming back to her. Then again, maybe the men who have been through so many Apocalypses (Apocalypsi?) they’ve lost track just aren’t that impressed anymore. Still, this is the first time Patience finds herself at the center of one of those world ending events, and she would appreciate it if it was treated with at least some level of gravity.
*Part of this chapter includes a hallucination that looks like Anna making sexual passes at Cas that he isn't comfortable with. While under the influence of Sweet Dreams, people see what they fear most, and Castiel has deep fears of the fact that while Anna was alive he was sexually interested in her.
Charlie looked at him steadily. Something twisted itself out of her, ugly and raw.
“You saying you love me, Cas?” Dean asked. It was a joke. It wasn’t subtle that it was joke, in fact it was over-telegraphed to the point no one on earth could have missed it. Cas took the question seriously, anyway, if only out of spite.
“It’s good to see you, Cas,” Sam says smiling. “It wasn’t the same without you.”
“Does it matter?” asked Anna. “What I am, I mean? A dream, a ghost, a figment of your imagination to deal with trauma… a memory. I’m dead, so this is all you get anyway.”
“Had enough time in your head while you were napping to figure out how to find it,” says the crocotta. “Believe it or not there are more than a few Youtube videos of your boyfriend playing at being God. Googled ‘God chokes homophobic pastor’ and got someone’s phone recording of the whole thing the first page of results. Picked up the voice pretty quick from there.”
Because, otherwise, Sam thinks in the privacy of his own head, why would Dean have driven to the one town they’d found with a case since Chuck lost and pretend it was on accident?
“Yeah. She agreed to every condition he put on it, too. She did such a good job convincing him she became the old king’s closest advisor. Two years after Rowena and Crowley arrived, the old king and the queen “mysteriously” died and she declared herself queen,” said Charlie. “It didn’t go over well, but what was anyone going to do? She was the mother of the king’s heir. It helped that she took the queen’s daughters in as her own. She raised them as her personal bodyguards and had them trained in combat. Every one of them would give their life for her, and rumor has it that she pretty much gave them whatever they wanted. She adored them.”
Balthazar followed Jo hesitantly, looking back at Cas as though to say he too was only going along with this because Cas had asked him to.
“Did you fuck him?” Cas asks. “That man, did you-“
Remembering the strange lack of men in Nowhere Pass, Cas chose the answer he suspected Metatron would find least threatening.
Still, within a few minutes he had composed himself in the back of the car and then got out and started walking in the general direction that Selma had walked off in. He might as well keep up appearances as long as he could manage. What happened after that became impossible, he would decide when the time came.
“Resistance establishment,” he explained. “I went there once with Jo, before Ira fell. The wait times were substantially lowered in her company.”
“You might wanna be careful around Jo,” said the doctor. “Traumatic events can cause anxiety or panic, and she might set off-“
“It’s possible,” says Cas, voice gone quiet. “We don’t need to talk about this.”
“Over my dead body,” says Dean. For the first time in days, Sam manages a smile. Not because it’s funny, but because Dean clearly thinks it is, what with the ‘close call’ and all. “Fucking death traps, I swear. Very cool looking though. Weird Dorothy never came back for it.”
“It’s fair,” he says, eyes flicking between Crowley and Billie with more than a little concern. “Suspiciously fair.”
“Kinda hard not to,” says Claire. “You’re my dream girl.”
“Stay with me this time?” asks Dean. Cas’ expression is unreadable. “I can’t tell you it’s the right thing to do, and I can’t promise you that I’ll be a better friend this time around. But just stay anyway. Because I’m asking. Because I want you here. If I get out of this mess, don’t go back. Even if- Fuck it, Cas, just… stay.”
“Cas?” he asks. He feels a hand against his cheek, turning his face up. “Cas, man, we- We gotta get out of here, I think there’s-”
“Yeah,” she said. “We’ve sent people out from Lucrum before. They didn’t report back.”
“What happens when we reach Libidine?” Cas asked Charlie.
“Family ties aren’t supposed to dictate access to…” Castiel trailed off, looking at the flashy show of wealth in a city whose people overwhelmingly have had to find ways to live in whatever they can build for themselves. “This.”
“Congrats?”
“Yeah, what a kick in the balls,” says Dean. “Aren’t you going to ask what my dad did?”
“Yeah,” says Dean. He fumbles around his head for a believable reason he’d seek out Cas’ company. If Cas doesn’t already suspect he’d been trying to listen in, Dean doesn’t want him to come to that conclusion. He’d just tell Mary, and then Dean and Mary would get into another shouting match about it. “I want to go out. Need someone to drive me back.”
*****
“We’ve already convinced them we went after Zachariah because of Naomi. If we fake a few communications between us and her and let Azazel discover them, he might just buy it. Especially if we can time an attack with one of Naomi’s offers. Make it seem like she’s threatening him into compliance.”
JANUARY 19, 111 A.L. - IRA
“Cas?” Dean asked next, looking right at him.
“I am not leaving,” Naomi said. She looked toward Castiel though, and dispassionately considered her options. “Though I suppose if it is the only way, the prisoner might be moved. I need one garrison to accompany him and Alistair, and no member of the garrison shall have had any prior contact with the prisoner. Alistair, if anyone attacks, you are to kill Castiel immediately.”
“Aren’t we supposed to be finding Jessica and Cordelia?” Castiel prompted. Sam nodded, expression now thoughtful as he focused once more on finding who needed to be found.
“Yeah,” she tells Jack. “I think so.”
“Dean would need to win the city,” he had said. “But if they surrender to someone other than him, the clause would be null and void.”
“You think that will work?” Castiel asked, furrowing his brows. “But Zachariah knows that the people here have been actively resisting the state.”
“No,” she repeats, seeming to search his eyes for the truth. “I believe you. But if Dean or Sam were to die right now-”
“You mean, Charlie and Ash?” Castiel said as the Dean hit a button for one of the upper floors and the elevator began to stutter and start it’s way upwards. “I don’t understand how work is supposed to get done when they both respect each other so little.”
Dean wakes up feeling like he’s too nauseous to actually hack anything up. The last few hours are fuzzy, but he vaguely remembers he’s supposed to be doing something. Something important. He tries to open his eyes, but there’s something heavy and rough draped over them, keeping him in the dark. When he tries to move, he realizes his hands are tied behind him around some kind of support beam. He struggles to claw his way back to proper functioning, but his thoughts are sluggish and incoherent, and every muscle in his body aches, and he can’t quite put together what’s going on-
There’s a knock on the door that it takes him a little too long to process it. When he does, he still doesn’t say anything, hoping whoever it is has the good sense to go away.
“I know how to drive,” said Cas indignantly. “What if they ask questions? It hasn’t been long enough.”
Castiel nodded at her and then at Boris and left. He glanced around once to see Boris reaching out to take his wife’s hand. He wasn’t sure how to feel about the sight.
“The fuck was that?”
“Shut up, Gordon,” said Benny. “We don’t murder unarmed prisoners.”
“You’re not the first to think so,” Cas said. “I’ll consider it karma and call it even. But nothing’s changed. I’m going with him.”
“I think we have to get ready for that possibility,” Charlie said. “And the other thing?”
“I’m… I don’t know,” said Castiel. Ellen kept looking at him, and Castiel felt himself shrinking away from her. “Is that the wrong answer?”
“You can always say no. But it would save a lot of lives on both sides if you agreed to help,” said Dean. “I need to know in the next three days. Oh, and if you say yes, ask Jo to find you a better coat. It’s fucking cold in West Canada this time of year.”
“Yes. We’re ready to go when you send us off. Has Sam, Tamara, and Gordon gone with their people?”
“You’re okay,” said Cas, practically babbling. “I’m so sorry, Dean. I was in so much pain. I didn’t want to fight it. I shot Anna and I just wanted it all to be over.”
Dean is having trouble thinking of anything other than the fact that Sam is not supposed to be here and he isn’t supposed to see what he is seeing. He stares straight ahead. There’s a whiskey on the rocks at the bar. John Winchester is nowhere to be seen.
“Is she okay?” Castiel asked Jo. Jo shook her head sadly, and then tugged Cas down to sit with her on the freezer. He didn’t resist and ended up sitting there and watching as Benny looked him up and down. “I haven’t thanked you for saving my life.”
“If he has to follow you,” Cas says, hands signing along with his words. “If we have to bind him. Someone has to close the door behind him, to seal the binding. Someone he can’t see coming.”
“We’re out of time,” she says. It takes Sam about a second for that to fully get through to him. Then he nods at Patience seriously, turns and sounds the alarm.
“The family thing isn’t easy,” Charlie agreed. “Nora gets along with Dr. Newman’s kid, though right?”
“Jason’s birthday is coming up,” she said, then went back to knitting. “And Kevin’s is next month. I’m going to make him socks.”
Castiel was mostly bored with this. He didn’t care about the significance of using different prepositions within a contract, especially when one such instance caused a fifteen minute showdown that almost had the king walking away from the table. It all seemed like useless chatter.
“Don’t you dare interrupt me,” Selma whisper shouted, eyes looking around to make sure no one else was listening before she continued a lot more calmly. “I won’t be punished for caring. And I won’t lose more friends if I can help it.”
“Yeah?” Dean asks. As if it isn’t obvious. As if this sort of thing would even happen if Cas didn’t feel the same way, a hundredfold and counting. As if he wasn’t now looking back at a life lived and wanting more, and wanting more now, too, and being buried under the sheer immensity of it all. And underlying every second of it: unthought of happiness. “Well, I got to tell you that’s good to hear. Because I’m not sure the angels are big on settling separation disputes, and the place isn’t big enough to cut in half anyway, so-“
“So what? I’m just supposed to live some quiet life and hope there isn’t a fucking sequel?” asks Dean.
Anna didn’t need to ask. Castiel leaned forward and kissed her, deeply. It felt empty, it felt inevitable, it felt final. He stopped and Anna wiped her mouth, seemingly unaffected. Castiel supposed if he had more pride he would be insulted.
God, Sam loves Eileen. He loves her so damn much, and every time she does something or says something incredible like this he feels like he’s being hit in the face with that fact all over again.
Dean stared down at him, something between pride and confusion and guilt. Guilt seemed to be winning out.
“I don’t want to die,” Castiel told her, and was surprised to find he meant it. The words came out shallow, as though they were wrenched from a part of him only newly resurrected. Naomi too seemed to realize just what it might have taken Castiel to say them.
“I’m sleeping,” she murmured. “And I’m well armed.”
Jo waited until Dean was out of earshot before she started laughing. Castiel glared at her.
“You know, I failed the aptitude tests on purpose,” Dean said. “I knew if I did too well they’d take me away from Sammy. Sometimes I wonder if things had been different what I woulda been. Sam got tapped for a career in science, and that shit is hard. Think I might have been at least a soldier, Cas?”
“Who are you convincing, Jack?” chided the older soldier, who moved forward and pushed Castiel ahead of the two of them, keeping the taser pressed to Castiel’s back, likely in case he ‘tried something’. “Why do you care what a traitor thinks?”
The thought of Dean in a soldier’s uniform was like looking through distorted glass. Cas felt ill thinking about it.
“Shoot me in the leg,” said Cas. “I need a reason to be coming back to Naomi, and I never reported an injury I received just before the New Year, which might raise suspicions if it’s ever discovered. Two birds, one stone.”
“Hey, we’ve come back from harder odds before,” he confirmed. Cas nodded and let go of Dean’s hand. He stood up to leave and go to his assigned quarters. Dean grabbed the back of Cas’ shirt and pulled him back.
“Uh, good for you Sammy? I figured Eileen would take care of your dumb ass just fine. Wait, did Jody tell you what happened? Because I swear to God, I was going to call you, I just didn’t want to deal with the bitch fit I knew you’d throw if-”
“Soldiers don’t turn and live to tell the tale,” she corrected. “Until you. Charlie’s right, people hate us. But they also know that we’re them. We’re the kids that go missing every year after the tests. We’re the inconvenient truth that the State doesn’t run if we don’t let it. The fucking pencil pushers in charge only have power as long as we give it to them. And you were going to ask every soldier in Superbia to lay down arms. You think that idea hasn’t spread like wildfire? Especially after your garrison escaped the city with you? The only thing holding a lot of our people in service, is fear.”
“Cas let me lay this out for you, because I think you don’t get it. You’re not going,” said Dean. “And if it makes you feel better, neither is Benny. I figured Charlie could stretch her legs on this one along with Dorothy. And yeah, Jack is going because he looks like a dumbass kid, and we need to make it past whatever checkpoint your people have set up.”
“No, I came here to jump your bones, and I got distracted and angry,” said Castiel. Dean choked on nothing. “Jo taught me that expression. I’m not sure I like it. Doesn’t it remind you of dancing on someone’s grave, jumping someone’s bones? Really the world would be a better place without the English language and sex.”
“Right,” says Dean. “I’m just this incredible guy. A regular Mr. Rogers. Good to know.”
“Like your brother,” said Cas.
“What, uh,” Dean stutters out, faltering. “What was that for?”
“I can’t do it,” he says to his brother. “Stop asking.”
“You’re kidding me right?” said Charlie. “Have you even read the play, or did you just get Sam to summarize it for you?”
It was surreal, standing out under the streetlights and knowing. There was a light drizzle starting to fall, and Dean wished for a moment that time would actually freeze. Because they were in that small space between leaving and going, and the dread had yet to creep back in completely. Because the sky hadn’t started to brighten yet. Because whatever else he was, Cas was warm and real and next to him, and Dean was starting to think that somehow, despite everything, he’d found something a little like a best friend.
“You barely spoke to her and left as soon as you could,” Selma countered. “I… I understand if it’s difficult after what happened, but disappearing every time she’s within fifteen feet of you isn’t helping you or her.”
“Max knew him,” said Alicia after a moment. Max glared at her. “What, you did. He played wingman for you at a bar that one time, remember.”
Sam gets in three days before the wedding. Cas insists on giving Sam his room back, saying he’ll sleep on the couch instead. It only takes a few hours of Dean bitching at him to agree to set up in air mattress in Dean’s room.
Ira had changed so much in the week they had been gone, that Castiel couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss hit fresh when he saw it again. More than one building had been burned, and it was obvious that a battle of sorts between the resistance and Azazel had been raging the past few days. The people they saw in the streets were miserable and suspicious, and more than one of them threatened to tell state authorities where they were if they didn’t move along quickly.
“Why me?” asks Kevin, ignoring him. Which is his right, technically. “I know you guys cared about me, I guess I just never thought I was that high on the resurrect from the dead list, y’know?”
“I’m eighteen,” he pointed out. His cousin, Jason, smirked at Kevin’s obvious annoyance.
“Uriel was right,” said Castiel, voice too flat to be comforting no matter how hard he tried. “You were following orders. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“Leave it alone, Sam.”
“But it is a victory,” Selma pointed out. “And it means a lot to us. The tide is turning, you can feel it in the air. Even if we fail now, the state is going to fall eventually. It’s inertia. Things in motion tend to stay in motion. And the state has begun to topple.”
Castiel couldn’t stand to hear anymore arguments from her. He left.
They sit in the false sand and the sea is freezing when it rushes over their toes. Sitting next to Tasha, knowing a mission is ahead of her and that she likes the people fighting at her side, Mary wonders if she has ever felt more alive.
To avoid from snapping at anyone on the long ass car ride to the depressing old dead men bunker the Winchesters call home (Jody’s words, not hers), Claire screens through radio stations and speeds through traffic. More than one car lays on the horn for her “reckless” driving, but she doesn’t get pulled over. Still her constant radio flipping is driving Patience up the wall and she can tell. Finally she settles on an alternative rock station Alex likes and lets it play out.
“Now who’s picking a fight?” said Cas, completely flat. Dean made a sound that was between a snort and growl, then stood up, tugging Cas after him by the front of his shirt. Cas struggled to catch his balance, grabbing at Dean’s hands as he did so.
Setting him up with a local girl, one Mary Campbell, became a game among some of the more sly residents of Lebanon. It took coaxing and cajoling and hinting to convince John that Mary had feelings for him (something she absolutely did not), and this at first only caused him to avoid her as far as was possible. This all changed in a matter of seconds when John heard Mary humming Stairway to Heaven as she worked shelving goods at her father’s store. It was like being hit through the heart with an arrow.
Then Garth led Cas on to other things, such as whether or not Cas still had suicidal thoughts and other such cheerful topics of conversation. When they were done, Cas considered for a moment doing as Garth had advised. He could conceivably lay it all out there, and get a final answer. Good or bad, at least the waiting and wondering would be over.
Castiel asked her if she had told Charlie any of this.
“Okay, I’m just gonna break in here,” said Jo. “Who is this argument gonna help? What’s done is done and we all got out alive and I’m going to call that a good day. Sound good, Dean?”
“We could,” Cas hears himself say through gritted teeth. He doesn’t mean it. From the way Dean quietly snorts, he knows Cas doesn’t mean it either. Except Cas doesn’t know what else to say. What hasn’t been said? There is nothing between them that hasn’t been spoken aloud now, and it… it isn’t enough.
“About your friend?” asked Selma. Castiel resisted the urge to snap at her. It wasn’t Selma’s fault he was mad at a dead woman.
“Take a seat, Castiel,” said Naomi, gesturing towards the chair as she picked up his report and scanned it. She wouldn’t notice Emma’s death until later when she read through it again. By then, Castiel would be long gone and Naomi would likely assume he had run away by himself again. “What a hideous coat.”
For a moment, Castiel was tempted to ask what that meant. But then Claire’s expression closed off, and he kept silent. He looked away from her, giving her time to process whatever it was she was remembering.
“If you must stay,” Castiel said, clearing his throat. “At least be useful. Or convincing. The real Anna would never behave like this.”
“You can’t actually,” he said, sounding apologetic. “I know it sounds stupid, and I’m going to kill Charlie for fucking up and subbing you in last second, but there is a reason I’m doing this.”
The worst part was it was true. Even if it meant failure, that was a line he wouldn’t cross.
Everyone else did their best to ignore the uncomfortable situation. Charlie didn’t seem to take well to being rejected, but tried to cover for it by being even more lively than usual. It was only when she took her turn talking Cas’ ears off that he realized how long it had been since he’d spent a significant amount of time with her, partly because of Jo, and partly because Charlie was frequently inseparable from Dean, whom Castiel had taken to avoiding at every opportunity.
The name Jesse caught Cas’ attention instantly, and he suspected that they had found the higher ranking Resistance members they had been looking for. Meanwhile, Claire had just finished unlocking the last of the doors in that hallway, revealing Betty and Jason, along with some final Libidinians. Dean and Benny were nowhere to be found. From what Cas could tell, neither were Jesse or Cesar. And there it was. The wrinkle in their wonderful plan. Still, it was best to push forward, otherwise all of this would be for nothing. So Cas took a deep breath, and spoke to the young woman who seemed to be the most in charge.
FEBRUARY 2, 111 A.L. - FIVE MILES OUTSIDE SANCTUS
“I should go,” Cas says, and then he’s gone. As if he was never there.
‘Death says no more second chances,’ Eileen signs. ‘Bad development when your boyfriend’s hobby is dying repeatedly.’
FEBRUARY 28, 111 A.L. - IRA
“Alright,” she said to Dean’s astonishment. She left to give her payment, and Dean stood there, absolutely stunned. He had somehow just managed to get himself engaged to Jo Harvelle. He should be happy. Why wasn’t he happy?
“Don’t shoot the messenger,” said Aaron. “Look, if I send Jo down to get him, would that work?”
Ezekiel stopped by most briefly, and Castiel didn’t know what to say to him. He also had a knife wound, and he had sustained it rescuing Castiel when he had believed before that Cas was rightfully punished. It wasn’t something he could say thank you for. He didn’t know how.
“Forgive me for being a little suspicious about the people that tried to recruit my own men to spy on me,” Dean said. None of them blinked. “You had to know Cas would tell me about that.”
Cas looked up at him, sunken blue eyes squinting a little in lack of comprehension.
Specifically, it was the fact that Lydia somehow had the enviable power of driving Benny up the wall without breaking a sweat. It truly was an impressive feat to behold. She could portray insolence with a twitch of her eyebrows, and every smile she aimed at him seemed to be a different flavor of ‘fuck you’. Castiel was truly in awe of her prowess. He would attempt to emulate her when he was assigned latrine duty for the third time in a row, but he truly didn’t think he could compete with such a compelling performance.
“Is good at pretending to follow orders and actually starting fires,” said Sam. “She got us out, and once I was sane enough again I got us to safety.”
“Go through the Door and come back,” he said. No one except for the creatures from other worlds had ever done that, and he didn’t believe for a second that Claire would be the first human to try.
“It’s time to go,” Dean says gruffly, wiping at his face. There are no tears there. Dean seems surprised by this, staring at his fingers a moment before his hands drop. “I’ll wait in the car.”
“But you didn’t,” says Jack. “You didn’t get to pick. I almost killed you. All of you.”
DECEMBER 28, 110 A.L. - 30 MILES OUTSIDE INVIDIA
It was like holding his breath, resisting the urge to go through with his mission. Or rather, it was like drowning, because taking a breath was less than an option. His hand fell to his side, and he dropped the gun. He wasn’t surprised when he was once again knocked to the ground and Dean yelled for help while restraining Castiel.
“I have to uphold my reputation.”
Chuck’s eyes slid to the detonator, and for one moment, Cas thought he saw a flash of fear in them. Somehow, he didn’t doubt it had more to do with the thought of losing toilet paper than losing one of his followers.
“Isn’t taking a little vengeance on Naomi why you’re here, Cas?” Dean asked. His tone was flat, which by itself let Castiel know he was in dangerous territory.
Cas chose not to acknowledge this last sentence. He didn’t know what he could say that wouldn’t sound trite. Instead he responded to the first part of the story.
When Eileen showed up for one of his daily walks, Cas knew Sam must have argued long and hard that someone had to be watching him at all times. That, and the absence of Dean made it clear that behind the scenes, someone didn’t trust him. Sam obviously, but if Mary Winchester’s second in command was showing up for one of Castiel’s walks around the hallway, he was pretty sure he had more than one person that was wary of him. The general had to approve Eileen being sent to watch him, if no one else was available.
“I could have said no, Castiel. I didn’t,” Kelly said. She looked at him as though challenging him to say anything else. Cas didn’t. He knew how he felt, and he knew it wasn’t his place to impose those feelings on Kelly. “And what about you?”
It was a little disconcerting to be called out so directly. Instead of responding, Cas found himself looking resolutely away from Dean, the way a petulant child might. Internally, he mourned the loss of whatever had remained of his dignity.
“Am I interrupting?” asked Dean, breaking in before Castiel could get a word in edgewise.
Funny how that sounded like a decent subplot for a subpar series of horror books written by a hack doing a Stephen King impression.
Cas saw Dean collapse on the ground seconds before a loud series of clicks announced that the door was no longer locked. Then Benny opened the door, and a mad scramble to reach it began. Feeling himself being pulled along by the crowd, Cas tried to dodge out of the way, but found he wasn’t much match for thirty people all desperately trying to escape the smoke filled room. So instead of fight, Castiel curled up on the ground and protected his head, letting the others crawl over him to get to safety. When the crowd had thinned somewhat, he leapt to his feet and pushed anyone still in front of him towards the door, both directing them towards safety and gaining momentum towards his objective: the crumpled silhouette of Dean Winchester lying unconscious on the floor.
If they lived in the city, Harriet could probably get treatment. There was no guarantee that she would survive but state hospitals were excellent. Then again, they didn’t take in anyone who wasn’t in the state system. There were many people at the fringes of cities that couldn’t go to the hospital because of this. They were still citizens, of course, but they couldn’t enjoy some of the benefits of being so without fully committing to the state.
“Bobby couldn’t make it,” Dean explains before Cas could say anything. “He pissed off Naomi, and she’s keeping him on lock down for a while. He’ll say hi when he gets the chance.”
“Shit, I shouldn’t have- I know you don’t-“
“I’m not a spy,” he said. “I’m a soldier. And I’m fighting for your side.”
“How many did you…?” Cas asked. Dean shuddered, understanding the question immediately.
“You go in there, the spell falls apart early,” says Patience. “Don’t know why, it just does.”
“Twenty guys in a cell and not enough food or water. You do math what happened,” said Dean, instantly distant. “You think you’ve got blood on your hands? Mine are never gonna be clean.”
“Not tonight, Dean,” said Cas, finally moving towards the door. He wasn’t sure what exactly Dean had said that had calmed him, but the anxiety had slowly leaked away through out their conversation. It might have been Dean’s presence alone that provided some relief from Castiel’s terror of what the future might hold. And wasn’t that just funny, considering Dean was the one who had made him think about the future as a possibility in the first place? “I’m sure Gordon would be more than willing. You can tell him about my impending doom. Have a good laugh at my expense.”
“Perhaps he likes you,” said Anna, grinning when Castiel seemed to stiffen slightly. “Or perhaps you like him.”
“How can you work with the resistance knowing what you know?”
***NOW***
“Don’t worry, someday you’ll be one of the big kids too,” said Jason, reaching out a hand to mess with Kevin’s hair, which was neatly avoided. Linda scowled at them both, but seemed resigned to the teasing and soon enough returned her attention to Sam’s story.
“Anna…” Castiel forced out. “Don’t.”
All that’s left is him. He suddenly understands why the Empty was so desperate for sleep. He’s never been so tired in his life.
*****
Castiel stopped walking.
Boris barely glanced at Castiel before seeming to move on with his life. Castiel was fairly certain he heard Boris ask Cordelia if she had anything to drink and watched in shocked fascination as Cordelia passed a flask to him. Even more surprising was that no one else at the table even looked worried about the behavior. Benny noticed his horror and smirked at it before apparently deciding to poke fun at him.
The door opened, and Dean walked in, that same worried look he’d started wearing around Cas displayed in all its glory. Cas realized it was almost afternoon and he hadn’t actually bothered to get out of bed yet. He wondered a moment if he should care about how this made him look and then decided he didn’t have the energy.
“Yeah, well, let’s start with this. Are you mad at me?”
“You cannot be that cold, you asshole,” said Jo. Selma lifted her head from her pillow to glare at both of them.
“When’s the last time you gave a damn about my fucking feelings?” Dean asked. His attention left Alistair, at long last. Instead his hands were reaching up to try to claw at the chokehold so he could look around and Cas. Cas let him, stupid as that may be, and took the full force of Dean’s glare. “When have you ever stopped wallowing in your own fucking self pity to give a fuck about me? Huh, Cas?”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said, because it was something to say.
“Uh yeah. She and Sam are having marital issues,” Charlie said. “You know how it is. Sometimes people just can’t see eye to eye on what they’re going to get out of a relationship.”
“They’re fine mostly,” said Jo, biting into a carrot she had likely taken from one of the baskets set up on the tables that were designated for serving food. She made noisy crunching sounds as she chewed and barely paused to swallow before she started talking again. “Leslie seems to be fitting in fine, and Benny’s been pretty good about being welcoming. Meg and Jenny don’t really like taking orders, but they’re dealing. David’s settling in, but he’s still pretty anxious about Emily and Nora being safe here.”
“I didn’t even say anything,” says Sam.
“What? No,” said Dean. Jo muttered something Cas didn’t catch and he heard Dean stand up to face her. “Look, he was having a hard time okay? Simple as that. I don't know why you're making into such a big deal."
“I’m glad you saw things my way,” Naomi said to Kali, who for her part looked mostly disgusted to be working with the current mayor of Superbia. She crossed her arms, unimpressed, and didn’t deign to respond to Naomi. Instead she looked toward one of the other women under her command.
“It doesn’t look like nothing.”
Cordy clocked his rising panic first.
“I’ve been working for Naomi this entire time,” Cas said flatly. His arms hung at his sides and made no move to defend himself, should Dean take exception with what he had just said. “It would be in your interests to eliminate me.”
If he didn’t focus on the circles under his eyes, or the gauntness in his face, he could almost convince himself that nothing had happened at all.
“I’m moral support,” said Jo.
“Listen to me,” said Cas, deciding to take his advantage while he had it. “Dean was sent here with a small troop to find out why Libidine lost contact with the rest of the Resistance and ask for help toppling Superbia. We didn’t expect to find what we did, or to learn that most of the Resistance here was being kept in prison. Dean let himself be captured so Charlie Bradbury and I could organize an escape for all of you. He planned to help from the inside, but whatever intel he was working off of was clearly wrong. Now help me find him, goddamnit, or I will make you regret choosing not to for the rest of your lives.”
“I didn’t know it was a competition.”
“I wouldn’t know how.”
And there it was, the weight of it all crashing down around them again. Not that Dean had needed to breathe normally ever again. It was the end of the world for Christ’s sake. The Apocalypse with a capital A. And there was Sam, a fucking sacrificial lamb to make it all go away.
“His name was Abner,” said Gadreel.
“Because it’s not just you and me,” says Cas. “It would be simpler if it were, but it’s not. There’s Jack and Sam. There’s Claire. There’s your friends and the people you owe yourself too.”
“You’re right. It’s not. But you don’t seem to be able to do the job yourself, so until that changes I’ll pick up your slack,” Selma said. “You should sleep.”
“You can’t seriously think I’m going to let you out of those,” said Dr. Newman, almost chiding. “First of all, I need to know as much as you can tell me about whatever it is Naomi gave you. Did she say anything that can help us identify-“
“Cas, Gabriel has definitely already told him where we are,” said Jo. “Dean can’t drag us back without it looking like he’s lost control of us in front of Crowley’s guys. Which means-“
“I’m gonna make Jody disown you.”
“Knock yourself out,” she said, and made no move to take her hand of cards back. Cas nodded and sat at the place she had occupied, while Jess went to chat amiably with Selma behind him. Cordelia not so subtly moved to the right so there was no risk Cas might accidentally touch her.
“I do wish I’d seen it,” said Benny. “Maybe he finally knocked Gordon’s head on straight. I still can’t believe Dean let him stay on as captain after what he tried to do to Trisha.”
“That sounds more like him than you.”
Sam had also left rather hastily, leaving Tamara glaring at the door in frustration, while Linda subtly squeezed her arm and then offered to walk back with her. Cas turned to look at Charlie, who was standing next to him to see if she had noticed, and although it was clear that she had, she didn’t look surprised.
“So you want to help us out of the goodness of your heart, huh?” said the man, leaning over Castiel slightly in an obvious attempt to be intimidating. Castiel kept his expression carefully bored. “How do we know you’re on our side?”
“I’ve heard.”
“So she gave us booze you can actually swallow this time?” Charlie asked. “What a saint.”
“Got another one, huh?” he says, kneeling down to peer in at the hissing creature. “No more balls for you, dude.”
“You think they may not be waiting there for Dean to talk to.”
It occurs to Patience then that she has people she wants back too. That she has a kind of power right now, a power that even Castiel couldn’t dream of. She knows how the world ends, maybe even how to stop it from ending. That’s the kind of bargaining power you don’t get that often. Maybe a once in a lifetime kind of thing. It’s so huge, she just marvels at it for a second. She is, for the next couple of hours at least, the most important person on the planet. There is even a part of her that knows that she could bargain out a few lost souls from Castiel. Her grandmother. Her mother. Claire’s father. Jody’s kid, that little boy in all her pictures who never grows up.
