He steadied himself, tasting metal in his mouth and preparing to use the arc reactor again. The footsteps grew louder. A figure rounded the corner into Tony's corridor.
Steve nodded, “Bucky, you and Nat get back to the house. Let everyone know we’re okay. Thor, can you give us a lift? Tony lives downtown.”
Tony scoffed, “Less dreadful. Nice. Is this how you ask all of your dates out? It’s probably why you don’t get a second.”
“Now, we clean up a body.” Steve sighed, “Rhodey, can you find Tony some clothes? Also head to the morgue and grab a body bag. Don’t let anyone see you, avoid the cameras if possible.”
Tony cried out when he felt Steve’s fist wrap around him, pumping his cock into the circle of his hand in time with his thrusts into Tony’s heat.
“You have a nice night, Mr Pierce.” Steve smirked before turning on his heel and heading back inside to find Tony.
Steve felt Tony’s come on his hand and felt his whole body clench around his cock as his orgasm hit him like an inferno and Steve used his hand to guide him through it, letting Tony ride out the aftershocks of his pleasure for as long as he could.
Tony hated the small spike of something rising in his chest at the thought of his father’s body back at the shipment yard. There was no love lost between them, but Tony hadn’t wished him dead. He was meant to cry though, right? That was the first sign of grief after the shock wore off, with his mother Tony had cried for days and yet he hadn’t shed a tear for Howard since Steve had told him.
Tony gripped the letter opener tighter into his fist, muscles aching with the grip, “You’re wrong. I am a survivor.” He moved so fast he couldn’t remember making the decision. One minute he was looking at Ross, seeing the fear and panic reflected into his eyes from Tony’s own and then he was bringing his hand up, pushing the sharp point of the letter opener into the soft skin of the underside of Ross’ jaw, “And I do know how to use a knife. You find a soft point and you push.”
Tony followed him; toolbox heavy in his hands until Bruce came to a stop in the garage. The car in question was beautiful, a vintage BMW 230SL top down convertible. It was a dark brown colour with a cream leather interior that just seemed to scream 1960s era. It was in perfect condition as well, Tony would bet money on it still being in running order.
Tony leaned down to kiss him, short and sweet and then he was sinking back down onto Steve’s length. Tony was still tight; despite being stretched out and Steve could see him close his eyes to adjust the Steve’s cock filling him.
Tony bit his lip at the feeling, already rutting against Steve in search of his pleasure, “Oh yes.” He groaned out, eyes closing at the sensation.
"We're not leaving." Natasha responded, her eyebrow quirked. Steve could see her breath form in the cold air.
Tony shivered, hips stuttering blindly as Steve increased their hands and his own thrusts grew sloppy as his orgasm teased at the edges of his vision.
“Let me take care of you now,” Tony insists, pulling back from Steve’s hold to try and get Steve’s jeans and boxers out of the way.
“That doesn’t mean he didn’t leave again; someone needs to take his car as well. Ditch it down by the docks. It needs to look like he went back there for something and got caught by a rogue Hydra member who deemed him a traitor. It needs to look like a gang crime.”
Tony had a job to hide his shock. He hadn’t seen or spoken to Howard in years, not since he left home and opened up the garage, effectively walking away from the Stark Legacy and Stark Industries for good. So, the fact he was currently standing in Tony’s doorway in his pressed suit and neatly combed hair had Tony reeling.
Tony wouldn’t be building him a missile though. Tony would be building his means of freedom. The arc reactor technology, something Howard had dismissed as being a waste of time was a problem that Tony had solved one night with a piece of chalk and a pavement outside MIT with Rhodey after they had come back from a party drunk. Rhodey was rambling about applying for the police force and Tony had managed to come up with a way to direct the raw energy created through the palladium into a sort of funnel that allowed him to power the arc reactor technology and focus it down on a smaller scale.
He didn’t need much persuading, kissing Tony soundly as he used his hands to support his weight and started thrusting into the Mechanic to build up a rhythm. Tony was moaning, hips moving to meet Steve’s with rigor as his heels dug harder into Steve’s ass.
and that’s the way it’s staying. Any one of your guys come a foot past it and I’ll chop that foot off and send it back to you in a box.”
The guy gritted his teeth, clearly in pain. The blood from his shoulder was steadily trickling down his arm and his leg was pooling blood into the floor. Steve wasn’t even sure he heard the question above the absorbing pain radiating from his body.
Steve bit back a moan, hips rolling into Tony’s hand wantonly. His lips found Tony’s with a fierceness that had Tony gasping softly and Steve biting at his lip for the noise.
Steve gave him a soft smile, “I have you. I have our family. I surround myself with people I love because that way, if I slip and I fall back into that pattern of letting them win, I have to deal with the fact I failed this family, and I can’t. I can’t fail you.”
“To get Rogers.” He glanced at Tony for a second before moving back to Rhodey, “We need to snap him out of this and clean this mess up before anyone else comes looking.”
“Clint. He’s fine.” Tony reassured him, watching as Steve’s shoulders uncurled slightly at the news, “But it’s war now. Rumlow found Clint and Sam searching for the base of operations. He thinks the Avengers made a move to attack him.”
“I meant what I said last night, you know. I do want this. Whatever this is with you.” Tony told him; his words softer than he’d have liked.
He took the papers, tucking them into his jacket, “Let me deal with Stark. I’ll get my team on it. You stay clean and maybe we all walk away from this.”
Tony pulled away just as quickly as Steve opened his eyes. Tony took a few steps backwards as he watched the confusion on Steve’s face change to something more mischievous, no doubt realising what Tony’s plan had been all along with that kiss. The material of Steve’s t-shirt came down far enough that the little box wasn’t visible to anyone who didn’t know it was there.
Steve slipped in another finger, spreading the lube around as Tony moaned, “I know. I want you slicked up too.”
Steve started unwrapping his other hand just for something to do, “Yeah, he knew. Told me not to worry about it. The Captain was the only thing that mattered. He taught me a lot, and we were making a difference to our own streets. There is something seductive about that, seeing the change right in front of you effecting people you know. Phillips got too bold and too cocky. I watched him make mistake after mistake that he was blind to because he thought the power would protect him.”
Tony shivered again, the cold biting at his bare arms before a heavy weight settled over his shoulders and the smell of Steve invaded his nose. Steve’s leather jacket hung from his frame, solid and warm and safe. Tony pulled it tighter around himself to ward off the cold.
Steve sighed, holding his hand and pulling Tony in closer. They settled into it. Tony’s hand in his, the other one on Steve’s shoulder as Steve’s rested on his waist. They were closer than they needed to be, moving slowly in tight circles. Tony’s eyes were on his, soft and brown and happy.
Steve tried to focus on Tony, those warm whiskey brown eyes, “You said you were staying in the car.”
Steve knew he would need to look into this one, if someone was trying to pin cop killings on them then he couldn’t just let that go. The cops would be all over this and Steve didn’t need the hassle. It had to be Hydra. No one else in Brooklyn would be bold enough to go after a cop. That brought him back to the new leader and whatever plan he had to destroy the family, “I need you to take a few days. Lay low, don’t come to the house until this blows over. I called a favour from T’challa to get you out so you need to be clean if the cops are still watching you.”
Instead, his eyes found a black sketchpad resting on the armchair tucked into the corner of the room. He couldn’t resist picking it up, getting to know another part of Steve. He knew he sketched, they had talked about it in passing but Tony had never actually seen Steve’s work and he was curious. The pad was rich leather and A4 in size. It was probably a gift from one of his family members.
The small note on his bedside table caught his eye and he grabbed it. Apparently, Steve was full of surprises because this note was written in his own handwriting.
Steve swallowed thickly, “The army. A mission in Afghanistan. I was clearing out a building with my team, a bomb went off. The shrapnel tore through my leg on the way out.”
Tony’s hands reached inside Steve’s jacket, pushing the formal wear from his shoulders so it could slide down his arms and hit the floor at his feet. Next, his fingers moved up to the bowtie Steve had handsomely been sporting all night, deftly working on unknotting it, knuckles brushing against Steve’s throat every so often.
“Stark Industries. Howard’s death is all over the news. You just inherited the company and became a billionaire.” Rhodey told him softly.
For a brief moment Tony wondered if he should leave Steve to it, let him work out whatever he needed to without the distraction but there was something in the frantic edge to Steve’s punches and the way sweat slid down his temple that Tony just couldn’t walk away from. He approached cautiously, Steve gave no sign of hearing him, but he didn’t tense when Tony laid a gentle palm on his back. Steve stilled mid-punch, catching the bag with one hand as he dropped his head.
“No, but I knew staying meant death. I guess I was too much of a coward to die without finishing what I started.” Thor replied, “I realised afterwards when Steve was offering me a job that what he saw in me was the same thing he recognised in himself.”
Tony leaned down, lips grazing the shell of Steve’s ear before he started sucking on his earlobe. Steve could feel the liquid pleasure pooling into his gut, hands gripping Tony’s hips harder as he thrust up into him.
The last guy standing had a gun held in a shaky hand and he had the good sense to raise it as Steve stalked towards him, closing the gap like a hunter approaching his prey.
“Because I don’t believe you kill for sport.” He said it with such certainty that Steve wanted to laugh.
Steve was sure he’d come soon if Tony didn’t, his body was insistently rutting against the mattress as Tony fucked his mouth and he wasn’t sure whether it was Tony shaking or him anymore. Tony’s heels were going to leave bruises on his shoulder blades as he dug them in, cock hitting the back of Steve’s throat again.
Steve picked up his pace, feeling the relief in his gut as the sparks inside him grew. Tony moaned happily, rocking his hips in time with Steve’s thrust until Steve could feel the sweat dripping down his own back as he thrust back into Tony’s body again.
They kept dancing; Tony’s eyes barely glanced down at Steve’s sleeve again. Steve couldn’t stop thinking about it though. Was Tony disgusted? He was still here though. Was he really okay with it? Tony tucked his head into Steve’s shoulder then, bringing them closer together. Steve kept swaying not wanting to disrupt their bubble, his lips grazed Tony’s ear.
Tony’s cock was growing hard now, the length filling out and standing to attention from Steve’s administrations, but Steve ignored it. His mouth moved over the crease of Tony’s thigh back towards his hipbone.  He sucked on the skin hard, a wet pop of his mouth as he flicked over his skin. Tony thrusted up towards him although a quick check showed he was still half asleep. His breathing had gotten deeper in his excitement though, Steve watched as his chest rose and fall with each breath.
“We don’t want to make the first move. We don’t want to be the reason a war between gangs break out. Innocent people will get caught in the crossfire and keeping you all safe in a warzone isn’t something I can easily guarantee.” Steve replied, “We need to turn the tide on this one.”
Steve could tell the exact moment the teasing got too much for the mechanic. Tony shifted in his lap, arms coming up to wrap around his shoulders until Steve felt Tony’s fingers burrow into the hair at the nape of his neck. He was pulling Steve closer, grinding harder against him desperately for something more.
“You really need me to answer?” She asked with a raised eyebrow, “You deserve something good Steve, if you trust him then I trust him. Yes.”
Rumlow looked up at Steve’s arrival, face relaxed behind the scar running down the length of it. He gave Steve a challenging smile, one the spoke of confidence and arrogance. The same smile Rumlow had worn in the army.
Tony seemed to realise he wanted that as well and grabbed Steve’s hand to let him haul him back to his feet. Steve saw Tony look down at the mess of his boxers and smirk up at him. It was such a dirty look that heat pooled into Steve’s gut and he couldn’t resist drawing Tony back to him for a kiss that was sloppy and sinful. Tongues teased each other in Tony’s mouth and Steve felt him bite at his lower lip, dragging it with him when Steve tried to break the kiss before letting it go. Steve was sure his lip would look redder and plumper than usual tomorrow, but he didn’t care.
It was like watching water curve around obstacles in its path, a fluid and unstoppable force with all the grace hiding a destruction she was equally capable of. The song ended and that was when Natasha caught sight of him in the doorway, relaxing onto the soles of her feet with a smile.
God, he loved him. When had that happened? But that was why he couldn’t let Tony throw away his whole life for someone like Steve. He loved him too much to drag him down into this mess with him and pretend it was love.
Steve gave him a watery smile, “What about Rhodey? And Peter? Your garage? Everything you worked to build here.”
Natasha’s voice dropped lower, “He’s been arrested. Police picked him up a few days ago and are holding him here in Brooklyn. Ross will conduct the investigation here and then they’ll probably move him to a bigger state for the trial.”
Tony turned in his chair a little more, angling his legs out towards Steve, “Did you really kill your old boss to take over his gang?” He asked, not in an accusing way but in one of curiosity.
He shoved at Steve’s chest firmly, breaking their kiss and catching Steve off guard with the move so that he flopped down on the bed behind him, body bouncing against the plush material. Tony stood over him with a wicked grin, he liked this.
“I am dying here.” He smiled, squeezing Tony’s shoulder as he stood up, “I can clock out early. Nothing’s happening on this gang case anyway.”
He wasn’t. They went to all that effort to kidnap him, not kill him so they needed him for something. They wanted him for something. An air of drama to lure Steve in? A trap? They couldn’t know how much Tony meant to him, Steve himself was barely accepting that fact.
When they eventually made it back to Steve’s, hours later than he had originally planned, the mob boss couldn’t help but feel nervous. Tony was right by his side as they walked up the front steps of the house together, everyone else already inside and waiting for them.
Tony added a second finger to the first, rutting against Steve’s thigh and he fucked himself onto his fingers. Steve could imagine his tight walls and the way he’d need to scissor his fingers open inside of himself to open his body wide enough.
“What is it with you and hating on my music?” Tony quipped as he pulled the other earphone out and tucked them into the pocket of his jeans. He straightened up to his full height, wiping his hands on the rag.
“So, here’s what we think,” Rhodey supplied, “Stop me when I get it wrong. Your Captain is doing his seedy business at the docks, our PC stumbles across it. Wrong place, wrong time and you guys can’t get let him go. That would be sloppy so one of you puts a bullet in his head.”
Bucky had managed to get everyone assembled in the kitchen when Steve walked in, Fury's envelope of immunity deals shoved under his arm. His family were looking at him, wide eyed and expectant and it was at that moment Steve realised they trusted him to guide them through this. To make sure they all made it out alive. A sea of faces waiting for instructions and a hope that only Steve could give them.
“You wouldn’t go to the press.” Howard mused, “You’re too proud, Tony. You get that from me, you know? You don’t want anyone to see you as the victim, it’s why you haven’t told them yet.”
Steve moved his fist quickly, jerking him off with the tight circle of his fingers and a flick of his wrist at the end of each stroke to get him there faster. Tony was babbling, Steve couldn’t make out words but he was shoving his ass firmly into Steve’s groin and gripping the bedsheet so tightly the corner had come away from the mattress.
Tony ducked his head, “I researched you. I couldn’t help it okay, you kissed me. I needed to make sure you weren’t some crazy psycho.”
He never missed a meeting with Hydra or a direct order from Steve. Clint was as loyal as they came and it pricked at Steve’s skin that he wasn’t here. It felt like he was operating on less than full capacity. Without his eyes in the sky Steve was at a slight disadvantage. As long as Sitwell didn’t learn that he’d be able to bluff through this meeting and then he’d find Clint and tear him a new one for flaking out.
Steve sighed, “T’Challa. I asked him for a list of returning vets, see if any of them could be Hydra material.”
Tony never wanted the company, Steve knew. He didn’t want Howard’s legacy or money. He was a mechanic and that was what he loved in his heart. Steve had told him to be true to that, following his heart had brought them together after all.
Steve shrugged, meeting his gaze for the first time, “I don’t know. Maybe I hit my head, or the bomb went off. It doesn’t matter. I walked for days until I found people, I was half dead by then. When I made it back stateside everyone thought I was dead, and they gave me a medal for it. For dying, how messed up is that? Presented it to Bucky like it was a trophy.” Steve bit out a stale laugh, “I met Phillips shortly after. I needed cash but I had no identity. I was a dead man and once again I was poor. He gave me a job in his gang. Street level work, collecting payments and issuing threats. That sort of thing. I moved up the ranks pretty quickly, and so The Captain was born.”
“Of course.” Adam replied, looking over at Steve for a moment, “I thought you were working with Rhodes on this one?”
Deep down, Tony knew that was a harsh statement. Of course, Rhodey had to work. He was a cop; it was his job. Just like Tony had a job to get back to, one that Peter was solely keeping afloat right now whilst Tony wallowed in his breakup like a teenager. It wasn’t fair to the kid. It wasn’t fair to himself either.
He rounded another corner, stopping short at the five men in between him and the end of the corridor. Steve still had his gun raised, he knew he only had three bullets left though. He had used most of his ammo getting this far.
Steve shook his head, “Can I see the body? I noticed something in the files I wanted to take a closer look at.”
“Okay, let’s get you in the shower.” Steve said gently, hoping that by explaining what he was doing Tony didn’t freak out on him.
Tony had him trapped in the V of his hips; legs wrapped around Steve’s waist as their cocks rubbed together lazily. Tony’s hands were in his hair again, a favourite spot it seemed, and Steve could only growl in response.
“We can’t let him go to jail for this, Nat.” Tony’s eyes were frantic, “I’m not saying he’s a good guy, but he doesn’t deserve jail.”
Rhodes narrowed his eyes, “A cop is dead so why don’t you try and take this seriously. I know The Captain protects his people, no one knows your names only your faces and let’s face it, even with your picture on file we still can’t find out who are you but I swear to you, if you had anything to do with this, we’ll come for you.”
“Are you sure you know what you’re signing up for?” The question startled Tony out of his frozen state, eyes locked onto Clint bleeding out on the sofa. His head whipped round to find Bucky standing next to him, clearly wondering if Tony was about to throw up.
Whatever slight shift Tony had created; it had caused a landslide within Steve that he was still struggling to understand himself.
Steve leaned down to kiss him, slotting himself between his bent knees with his fingers still buried inside of him. This position was more intimate as he swallowed Tony’s moan, fingers moving inside of him as the heel of his hand pressed against his own cock through his jeans. Steve went slow and shallow, lighting the fire without letting it roar. Tony was devouring kiss after kiss from his lips as his hips bucked up and Steve couldn’t resist adding a third finger.
Tony rolled his hips at the statement, leaning down to kiss Steve then. It was deep and dirty, Steve’s tongue invading his mouth and thrusting in and out in a way Tony knew he’d do with his dick inside him. He lost himself in the kiss, letting his hips buck against Steve’s as he ground his erection against him wantonly.
Steve groaned, body straining underneath Tony as he swirled his tongue over it. Steve really seemed to like his tongue. Tony could work with that. His mouth moved over to Steve’s nipple, closing his lips round the bud as he flicked his tongue over it once, twice, a third time. The erection pressing into him was evidence enough that Steve was enjoying this.
The worry blooming in his chest gave way to anger, raging through his veins like an inferno. Someone had hurt Tony; someone had taken him from his home. Steve knew this had to be related to him, a small-town mechanic – no matter how brilliant – wasn’t the type to have many enemies. Steve was. Steve had plenty of them, and right at the top of that list was Hydra.
Steve spared a glance over his shoulder to Tony, he stood frozen in the doorway and paler than Steve had ever seen him. There were tears in his eyes, Steve met his gaze briefly then Bucky was screaming again, and Steve was back to him.
Steve pulled at him desperately, there was too much space. Too much worry and anger and fear seeping into the cracks between them. Steve hated it. Not here, not with him. He sucked on Tony’s bottom lip; large hand splayed over Tony’s lower back.
“I’m quite fond of it,” Steve smiled, turning to lean back against the bumper and slide his hands into his pockets, “Remember when we first met, and I told you I wanted to be a getaway driver? Well, this was the car I imagined doing that in.”
“Yeah, I needed something that was mine. Something Howard couldn’t touch and that I was proud of. It’s hard being the disappointing son of a billionaire.” Tony replied, “That’s without the added kidnappings and ransom demands.”
“Your father told me he could convince you to work with us,” Rumlow said, “This was a last resort, I had hoped you would share his ambition or his greed.”
The guy looked at him with wide eyes, unsure and holding onto his gun with a vice like grip. He was holding it too tight, that grip must be killing his arm. Steve held up his hands, gun in his left with the barrel pointed out to the side like a sign of surrender.
Steve wouldn’t do any of those things though because they weren’t practical. The King of Brooklyn’s days were numbered and if he really was about to lose everything, he was damn well going to make sure he did everything in his power to stop that from happening.
“You’re living in a fantasy.” Natasha’s venom was back in her voice, “We would be bored in months. We choose this life, Bucky. Both of us. This family. I should have told you, but I wanted to avoid this. I wanted to protect you from going through the same thing I had to go through when I made the decision.”
Steve nodded, “I know who I am and what I’ve done to get here. I’ll live with it but they shouldn’t have to.”
Rumlow cocked his head at the gun in Steve’s hand, “A shot to the heart? Impersonal. All those times we trained together in the army. All those hand to hand sessions. Is that why you brought a gun? Worried you won’t be able to beat me without it?”
He pushed himself off the railing, scrubbing at his hand with one hand. He sent off two texts, one to Rumlow and one to Fury.
He dodged the first man, moving to the side at the last moment and aiming his gun at his temple as the guy regained his footing against the wall. Steve pulled the trigger, blood and brains splattering the wall behind him. Thor might have even been proud of the mess he made.
Bruce pushed his glasses up his nose, "I'll be on standby for a patch up. We don't want you winning the war with Hydra just to bleed out because you can't make a stitch."
His hammer was a mess of slick red blood, creating a dribbling trail next to him that carved out his path of destruction.
Another buzz from his phone was enough to make his decision. He threw his shirt over his head hastily and went to pick up his leather jacket, hand digging into the pocket to retrieve the phone.
Steve shook his head, “No way, Tony. Too risky. Ross will arrest you the second he gets wind of it.”
Tony approached the bed then, slowly climbing onto it by Steve’s feet, allowing the mob boss to shuffle backwards until his head hit the pillow and Tony joined him. He threw a leg over Steve’s hips, climbing into his lap. Steve was half-hard underneath him, a smirk on his face as Tony settled himself over him.
By the time Steve made it back home his anger had been festering like a furnace, he could feel it in his bones. They took Tony. Hydra dared to use him as a chess piece in this game of war between them. Steve felt like his veins were burning, clenching and unclenching his jaw every time he thought about Tony in pain, being hurt, because of him.
When Tony woke up he instantly reached out to pull the covers closer to his chest, the morning chill had a bite to it that not even the walls of the condo could fight off. His hand hit solid flesh in his quest for more covers and Tony blinked his eyes open. The events of last night came back to him in a swirl, breaking through his sleepy haze.
Natasha’s door was open so she clearly didn’t want privacy and Steve stopped short when he passed her doorframe, leaning against the wood because he didn’t want to intrude. Her room always looked so homely to Steve, bright cream with a purple bedspread. The window was open despite the winter weather and the wind caused the papers she had clipped to the wall to flutter gently. They were newspaper articles she found interesting, a few photos of their team. Steve’s favourite was the one taken last Christmas. Thor had tried to bake a cake and in the photo he held it proudly whilst the rest of them ignored the camera, digging straight in with their forks. There was also a pair of ballet tickets, ones Steve had gotten her for her birthday a few years ago. They had gone together despite Steve knowing nothing about Swan Lake or the ballet. Natasha’s face had been worth it though, eyes lighting up like a kid meeting Santa.
Tony didn’t answer but he helped Steve take off the jacket and let him lift the shirt of his head, lifting up his arms to help. Steve smiled encouragingly at him, that was good. Tony was consciously present at least. The blood stained his hands and there was a streak of it over his cheek and chin. Steve doubted he fared much better, but it looked wrong on Tony. The mark of blood on his perfect skin.
Tony hummed inches away from Steve’s mouth, hot breath and a sinful voice, “A terrible idea.” He agreed.
Tony seemed to just stare at him for a moment and shook his head with a smile, “Let’s find out. Of course you have a knife in your boot. Is there a gun in your pants as well?”
Tony moved ahead of Natasha, dropping to his knees in the snow in front of Steve with a soft expression, “Hey, you’re okay. I’m here. We’re safe. You’re okay.” He rambled, watching as Steve broke through the mask of indifference he wore.
Tony shook his head, “Rumlow’s going to hurt people. He’s going to sell those bombs to the highest bidder and people will die, Howard. That’s going to be on you, is that really what you want? Is that how much profit means to you?”
“Steve, listen to me.” Fury turned to face him then, his one eye trained on his face, “Special Branch don’t care about who is responsible. They want all the gangs out of Brooklyn by Christmas. Hydra, Avengers, it all goes. It’s not about justice anymore, it’s extermination.”
“This is a dangerous game, Nick,” Steve warned, letting him know that he knew Fury’s name as well and that was a dangerous thing, “people who know my name don’t tend to live very long.”
Tony jumped under his touch as Steve moved the shirt up higher, his mouth following eagerly tasting Tony’s skin until the fabric was bunched under his arms. Tony lifted them up to help Steve as he smoothly glided the material over warm skin and Tony’s head until he was free of it.
“This is what you call ‘having it’? Running in there to engage without any clue about what weapons he was packing or whether they were anyone else around?” Natasha demanded; she wasn’t shouting which made it worse. Natasha’s even tone and steely eyes spoke volumes.
Steve’s hand instantly went to the dried blood on his neck before he realised what he was doing. Why did he care what this stranger thought?
Tony nodded against the pillow, “It’s going to be fine; you know. We got the death certificate and the mission report from Afghanistan. T’Challa thinks it will work. He said he’ll make whatever statement you need him to and back you up.”
He didn’t think he’d ever had sex that good that he could still feel it the next morning, that toe-curling kind of stuff that left him replaying various bits of it through his head. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, he needed coffee.
That led to them showering together and having sex again in the shower before Steve knew he needed to get back to reality because the others would be home soon, and he definitely knew having Tony there wouldn’t go down well. He walked Tony out and to his car like a proper gentleman and gave him one last heart stopping kiss before letting him go.
Tony released the nipple with a wet pop, lips moving across the valley of his pectoral before heading downwards, following the natural line of Steve’s abs. There was so much skin under his lips and Tony relished the feeling of Steve’s muscles jumping whenever Tony darted his tongue out to taste him as he went.
The morgue was cold and oppressing in Steve’s opinion. All tiled stone floors and off green walls with peeling paint. Clearly no one thought to decorate considering most of the people who came down here were already dead. The mortician was clearly expecting them, standing out with a file over a body in a body bag as he checked his notes.
Steve felt his stomach clench, without Fury’s help his team were in danger of getting arrested for this, “They can’t do that. You’re working leads. You’re still investigating.”
“No? So, voting against Tony being part of this team? That wasn’t you throwing your toys out the pram because god forbid someone actually has the chance to be happy in this family.”
Glancing at the clock on his computer Steve knew if he left soon, he’d still make it. He began to cover up all his paperwork in a heap to sort through later, getting to his feet whilst ignoring the pain in his back from sitting in that damn chair for hours on end.
“I’d never do anything to hurt you.” Steve told him softly, meaning every word and he was taken back by the weight they carried in the small space between them.
He reached for it blindly, watching Rumlow’s eyes grow wider at the realisation of what Steve was doing.
Steve sped up slightly, thrusting into Tony as his hips rose to meet him. They moved together, push and pull until Tony was rock hard between them again and Steve was biting the inside of his cheek to stop himself from letting out a groan. He was embarrassing close, this situation the right kind of sinful to have him trying to stave off his own release so they could come together.
Whilst the nightmares and panic attacks were the most obvious sign that Tony wasn’t coping with everything he’d been through in recent weeks, they weren’t the only sign. Steve would pick up on the little things he was sure Tony thought no one noticed but he did. He knew Tony, completely, body and soul and he would always notice. It was there, written in the way Tony would wince slightly whenever Natasha was twirling a knife in her hands at the kitchen table. It was there in the way the blood drained from his face when Sam had cut his hand open at the bar and needed stitches, coming home with a blood-stained shirt that forced Tony to look anywhere but in that direction. It was there in the way Tony watched him sometimes, when he thought that Steve wasn’t looking, with a disbelief that Steve was there, loving and protecting him after everything he’d done.
He crept across the hall to Steve’s private bathroom quickly, trying not to wake the mob boss. He grabbed some water from the tap in there and spared a moment to look at himself in the mirror hanging over the sink. He was wild, dark hair curling slightly and nothing more than a mess on the top of his head. Steve’s t-shirt was too big, revealing more of Tony’s collarbones than a normal one would. He could see the dark bruise blooming on his neck from Steve’s mouth last night. A visual mark of possessiveness that made Tony’s gut warm and a smile curve onto his lips at the thought of his mark also present on the skin of Steve’s hipbone.
“I might have to kill Rumlow.” Steve told him honestly, blue eyes boring into Tony’s like he was pleading him to understand, “If I can’t bring him in. I have to stop him.”
Rhodey was reaching for the gun on his hip. Steve moved fast, he slammed Rhodes back against the lockers behind him and they shook under his weight, but it was enough to daze the cop in his grasp who was trying to get a hand on Steve’s throat.
Steve for his part didn’t move, standing frozen as his eyes tracked Tony across the room and his muscles bulged underneath the starch material of his outfit, “What are you doing here? Did they arrest you? They don’t have anything on you…”
Yet Tony was still moving closer, lips grazing the underside of Steve’s jaw as he stretched upwards. Steve was reaching for him as well, despite his words, fingers pulling at the shirt Tony had knotted around his waist.
Tony moved his feet from Steve’s waist, planting them on the edge of the table, knees bent until his ass was almost in the air. Steve understood immediately, moving his fingers to Tony’s hole with a practiced ease. He probed gently, tip of his finger pushing against Tony’s resistance until Tony was shaking with impatience and glaring at Steve like he wanted to shout out at him for taking so long. Steve waited until Tony’s eyes focused on him and pushed the first finger inside him. Tony shuddered at the intrusion, walls tightening and relaxing against his finger as Steve pumped in and out of him slowly, one hand on his knee to steady himself from his own pleasure building at having Tony like this.
Steve didn’t even blink as he shot him. One bullet lodged into his shoulder and the Hydra man screamed out in pain, cuffs rattling against the metal of the radiator as he tried to move. Steve watched the steady bloom of blood seeping through his clothes.
Steve didn’t answer right away, staring into Bucky’s face as he wrestled with his own feelings on the matter. A flash of brown eyes and the sound of his name tumbling from Tony’s lips crossed his mind, “Would it be so bad if I did?” Steve asked quietly, knowing Bucky would hear him.
Steve kicked the locker with his foot, testing the metal as it shook with the force. Flimsy enough for Steve to get into at least. He rattled the locker a bit more, mindful of the noise he was making and give it a sharp bang on the side with his fist. The door popped open enough for Steve to wedge his fingers in and pry it the rest of the way.
Rumlow looked scared in those last moments, a wild fear that had him shaking under Steve and fighting back with more strength than Steve thought he had.
“Fuck, Tony.” He gasped from his place on the pillows, hands tugging at the ties like he momentarily forgot that he couldn’t reach out and grab the mechanic like he clearly wanted to.
“It doesn’t matter where we are, Steve. As long as we’re together. That’s home.” She told him gently, pushing the box towards him at the table.
Steve started off slowly, sliding out before pushing back in again, watching Tony writhe underneath him and try to pull him closer.
Everyone's eyes were on him, a mix of betrayal and fear and sadness and it all felt like failure. Steve had failed them. He had failed them by lying to protect them and he had failed them by not offering anything better.
Tony shivered at his words but not in fear. It was a reaction to the intense burning in Steve’s eyes, like an unspoken promise passing between them.
The television camera spanned over Tony’s appearance to give his statement, looking both impressive and rigid in his pressed three-piece suit as Steve shifted forward in his seat, trying to get closer to the screen as if Tony could see him.
“I have Thor at the docks right now, I’ll see what he finds and go from there. I think it’s Hydra though. It has to be.”
“Tony, is he okay?” Steve asked when Fury had closed the door and was taking a seat opposite him, “The others, where are they?”
“Fury.” He called out, coming to stand next to the man and take up his own stance, eyes fixed on the waves rolling in with the night.
“Come out, come out, Captain.” A voice called to them, “Rumlow will probably kill you first so you don’t have to watch him die.”
He hit the call phone, bring the phone to his ear and waited for Tony to answer. His surprised but happy voice came over the phone after two rings and Steve melted into it. He might have stayed up on the phone with Tony talking until the sky outside was starting to lighten and Tony reminded him they had to sleep because he definitely had work to do tomorrow but if he did then Steve decided it was no one else’s business but theirs.
Fury pushed him into a small room at the end of a corridor and the first thing Steve saw was blood. There was so much of it in the room, coming from Ross’ body which was slumped on the ground, a letter opener a few feet away. Steve swallowed thickly. This wasn’t a cold calculated kill of someone who knew what they were doing. This was a spare of the moment fight or flight response.
Tony nodded; she was right. Of course, she was right. Steve had given them orders, they had to follow them. Natasha led them further into the building, peering into doorways and checking around corridors. Tony’s mind was on the gunshot. They hadn’t heard another one since. Was it all over ready? How long did these showdowns normally take? Would Steve come looking for them all bloody and ready to hang up The Captain for good?
“Loki.” Thor replied, “My brother. He got caught up in something and he died for it and my only thought was to find whoever did it and make them pay. That was my only purpose after I failed to protect him. It was the only thing I could do for him.”
“You really think I’d be living here if he was the monster everyone sees him as?” Bruce asked, “He’s a tortured soul, that’s for sure. He isn’t a good man, he needed to survive, and he couldn’t do both, but he isn’t a monster. I don’t believe that, even if he does.”
The Kid was sweating now, he was vibrating with the effort to stay still. Steve watched as the gun in his palm quivered. He almost wanted to feel sorry for the Kid. This was getting tragic. “Alright, shoot me.” He smiled, a twinkle in his blue eyes that was nothing short of dangerous.
The garage itself stretched out through the whole lowest level of the Brooklyn mansion the served as Steve’s home base. A collection of vintage cars spanned across the furthest corner of the room, a personal hobby of Steve’s and a massive collection. T’challa had always been envious of it, Steve had even gifted him one after he got into Congress as a congratulations. The rest of the garage was unused space for the most part. Occasionally it was home to interrogations when Steve needed, there was a dried patch of blood on the floor by the stairs from one such case. Steve hated to get blood anywhere else in the house. The garage was abandoned saved from the vehicles and it was underground which made it soundproof enough to be perfect for torture.
Tony’s eyes drifted to Steve’s lips, full and slightly parted and begging for attention. What Tony wouldn’t give to have those lips on his. To draw that bottom lip between his teeth and make Steve moan.
Fury left the room, turning on his heel with the papers under his arm. Steve waited for his guards to come and bring him back to his cell, his mind on which member of his family was injured and possibly dead whilst he was rotting in a cell, all because Rumlow decided to go and get greedy.
“No, I won’t.” Fury agreed, “Ross is blinded on this one. But we can’t leave Rumlow out there to push bombs. Can you stop him?”
“I can barely afford Peter.” Tony replied, “The business is good, but we’re still paying off loans to get it up and running. Next year we’ll be in the green on those and I’ll have the wiggle room to take on another full timer but right now it wouldn’t be a wise decision.”
Bucky’s voice wavered and Steve felt his heart clench, “We could have worked it out if we tried, Nat. We could have left, gone somewhere just the two of us and been a family.”
Steve didn’t think Tony needed a verbal answer to that question because the rock-hard cock in his jeans and his blown pupils were probably answer enough, “Take your pants off.” Steve asked him, already heading over to Tony’s toolbox to grab their supplies. He threw them into the driver’s seat of the car Tony had been working on as Tony rid himself of his pants, shoes and socks.
He was a God in those moments, playing life and death and destruction. The God of Thunder. The last sound someone heard as Thor brought the hammer down on their skulls.
“It isn’t going to be like before, you know?” Tony said gently when they broke apart, “It isn’t going to be whatever you say goes.”
He unlocked his screen with a press of his thumb on the pad and the dim light of his home screen flashed up. Everyone else was watching the film with earnest interest, they didn’t realise Steve was occupied with something else.
“Jesus, Thor!” Steve bit out, “Knock, would you? I’m naked under here.” He held the sheet closer to his chest as he said it.
“Will do,” Nat replied as Steve brushed past her to head to his office for a drink, “What should I do about the mechanic?”
His father’s assistant stopped them when they reached Howard’s office. She was a small woman, blonde and beautiful and Tony figured Howard had hired her for more than her filing skills.
“Say I agreed to this trade of yours and between us we managed to bring Hydra down. Then what?” Steve asked, the wind whipping at his hair and his jacket.
It was a nice dream, a game of pretend he knew they’d never get. This would be the last moment of goodness they had together but at least they were both filling it with lies. That made Steve feel better.
Tony flashed a glance at Steve’s palm before darting his eyes back to Ross’ body, “I had to do it. I had to.” He muttered.
What he really needed was to see the body. Photos could only show Steve so much and he wanted to know more. There was something dark under his nails in the photos, blood from his attacker maybe? Had the police checked it yet? There would also be marks on his back if the body had been dragged into police for someone to be able to find it but there weren’t any photos in the report of that either.
But that was done now, and Tony really needed to stop thinking about it otherwise he was going to waste another day wrapped in his covers and avoiding his life. He could do this; Steve hadn’t broken him. He hadn’t touched a drink and he sought out Rhodey instead of dealing with this alone. He was making smart choices again. He was going to be fine.
“He’s fine. Well, he’s whining a lot but we take that to mean he’s fine.” Sam replied, “Bruce said he’ll make a full recovery.”
“I killed him.” Tony breathed out, the sobs coming back, “I killed him. I had too, he was going to come for us. All of us. I couldn’t… You protect your family. You have to protect your family.”
One of his men charged at Steve, the look in his eyes clearly questioning his career decisions and whether he really wanted to go up against The Captain. Steve watched Sitwell crawl further away from the ambush.
Pierce froze for a second before spinning round with a smile in place, “Captain, it appears we travel in the same circle now.”
Tony moaned in response, the dull ache of his shoulder sending shivers down his spine. Steve wasn’t done yet, moving his hand from Tony’s hip to wrap around his cock.
Tony turned another corner, mulling over Bucky’s words. Rhodey would be the same over him, wouldn’t he? Hadn’t he been worried and concerned over Tony’s relationship with Steve much like Bucky was. Had all this hostility really come from an overprotectiveness Bucky had honed from a young age?
Tony ignored him, hands skimming the elastic waistband of Steve’s trousers as he quickly pulled them back from his stomach slightly to shove the small black box between the skin of Steve’s navel and the elastic. To Rhodey, it just looked like they were making out, his view blocked by Tony’s back.
Steve hummed against his shoulder, moving his hips back so he slid out of Tony’s heat before plunging back in again. This was good, this was home. Steve set the pace, using Tony’s hip for leverage as he pumped in and out of his hole, their skin slapping together at the contact.
The place was carnage, broken china and scattered letters on the floor, black marks scuffing up the wood of the entryway. There had been a struggle, that much was clear.
Steve was back in his cell after his meeting with Tony and the cop, Rhodes, looked like he wanted to punch him every time Steve caught his eye. He understood perfectly, Tony hadn’t left much to the imagination with that kiss that Rhodes had walked in on.
“Yeah, we pulled in one of The Captain’s guys but we couldn’t hold him or get anything out of him. Those gangs are going to be the death of this town, everyone is too scared to arrest them so they just get away with everything.” Rhodey took a sip of the coffee, his brow furrowed in annoyance at the situation.
He clung to Rhodey greedily, hands wrapping around him as Tony buried his nose into Rhodey’s shoulder and inhaled the scent of spices and stale coffee that clung to Rhodey since he joined the force. Rhodey held him in a fierce grip, protective and safe. Tony wanted to start crying all over again.
When it was over, wound no longer bleeding but scarred and burnt beyond recognition, Bucky was still ghostly pale and unconscious. Steve was almost thankful he didn’t have to hear his best friend scream again. He stood up gently, making room for Natasha to take his place as Bruce cleaned and dressed the wound.
Steve groaned again, crowding Tony in so his hands were firmly on Tony’s hips. Tony surprised him by spinning in the circle of Steve’s arms until his back was flush against Steve’s chest, Steve’s erection prodding him in the curve of his ass.
“No, and as long as we aren’t in contact, he won’t.” Fury replied, “I can cover my own ass. Yours, however, is in the fire.”
Steve couldn’t help the chuckle that he let out, hands reaching for Tony’s smooth skin again as he moved him back towards the bed, “Do they have an article for my skills in the bedroom?”
“Howard.” Tony greeted, ignoring the bile in his throat and adding venom to his voice. He couldn’t deal with this today.
Steve groaned loudly because if he wasn’t hard before he was painful hard now, “Did you come here to seduce me?” He asked coyly, hands squeezing Tony’s ass as the mechanic practically ripped the last two buttons off Steve’s shirt so he could get it off him.
The frigid air had a bite to it as Steve stood out in the open in the middle of the abandoned warehouse district that was to be their meeting place. Winter had come to Brooklyn harshly this year, his fingers were already tingling with the cold and if he looked over at Natasha on his left, he knew her nose would have a slight red tint to it that matched her hair.
Before he could continue that thought any further Tony had ducked down and placed a kiss on Steve’s chest, mapping out a path with his mouth before taking one of Steve’s nipples between his teeth. Steve’s hips stuttered and he pushed Tony even further into the door behind him, one hand threading through the hair at the base of Tony’s neck and the other gripping at his hip to help establish a rhythm as they ground against one another.
“It is a big deal, Steve.” Bucky insisted, “You don’t stay over. Ever. That’s your rule. You don’t like letting your guard down with strangers.”
“What the hell was that?” Steve demanded, hot on Bucky’s heels as he pushed his way into the bedroom Bucky had just entered.
“They’re the enemy.” Thor finished, swinging the hammer in his hand, “I will leave no stone unturned. For Bucky.”
"I guess not." Tony replied, holding out his gloved hand and trying to shield his eyes from the power of the arc reactor.
“Just another minute? I want to watch this.” Tony replied, he moved his hand out into the cold air, fingers searching for Steve’s as he tangled their hands together.
“Fuck, Steve.” Tony gasped, uselessly trying to thrust his hips up against Steve’s hands. Steve himself had to give a shallow thrust into the mattress at his own leaking cock needing friction.
Rumlow smirked then, cold and smug and Tony hated it, “Yes, you are. Then when you’re done with the missile, you’re going to tell me everything you know about The Captain. His team, who he is.”
He wanted to be uncomfortable with that knowledge, he wanted to feel guilty for breaking one of his own rules in order to spend the night with Tony.
Steve sighed, “Sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate. The three main ingredients found in gunpowder.”
Coward. He should have told Tony everything. That Rumlow knew who he was. That they were fucked but he couldn’t. He wanted one more night like this. One more night with Tony so carefree and happy and with him. He wanted to be selfish for a little while longer.
He pushed it back as Tony nodded, “If you don’t get inside me soon, I might explode.” He replied and that was all the encouragement Steve needed.
Steve saw everything Tony was, everything that made him into the person walking around today without even knowing the half of it. There was something in Steve, in the way he understood survival and the basic need to evolve in order to achieve it than spoke volumes to Tony.
"No, chances are they'd split everyone up. Less of a threat that way but we can work around that. Give it some time, wait for the dust to settle and in a year or two come back together in a new city." Steve replied.
“I’m dangerous, you know.” Steve warned him, “If you were smart, you’d walk out that door and wouldn’t look back.”
Of course, it wasn’t Tony. He didn’t want Tony to message him. He needed Tony to ignore it so Steve could be done with this whole infatuation.
He leaned down, lips on Tony’s shoulder blade has he licked over the scars from Howard’s treatment and moved up towards his neck. Steve pulled Tony backwards, pressing their bodies flushed together so Tony could throw is head back against Steve’s shoulder and Steve had a clear path to Tony’s neck. He sucked at the salty skin there, teeth grazing as he felt Tony shudder against him.
Steve crouched down then, getting lower to meet Sitwell’s eye level, “If he wants my throne and my family, he’ll have to kill me for them.” Steve spat out, “Too bad you won’t be around to help him.” Steve grabbed the knife from Natasha’s palm with a practiced ease and slide it in under Sitwell’s jaw as Bucky held him steady. Steve watched as the knife disappeared upwards, pushing firmly as blood poured out of Sitwell’s mouth and down his chin.
The paperwork did look iron-clad, from what Steve could see it was a legally drawn up agreement between the ‘named individual’ and the NYPD office, under the authority of one Detective Inspector Nicholas J. Fury. All that was missing were the names of the second party and a signature at the bottom. Fury had clearly come through for him after all, in his hands were a get out of a jail free card. A way for the team to walk away from this mess with Hydra without facing jail time.
“You’re right and I gave my word you’d be dead before the night was over.” Steve told him, eyes level with Rumlow again.
Steve had his back to Tony as he made his way down the stairs of the garage. It was the same as ever, vintage cars ferociously shiny and on display, the overflowing workbench in the corner that probably had a gun taped to the underside. Even the darker patch that had once been blood was still there, just a darker grey now like it had been painted over so the chemicals could erode what was left of the DNA.
Steve wanted to thank him, he wanted to express how grateful he was to Fury in that moment for believing there was something in him worth saving because Steve wasn’t sure what it was. He didn’t though. The Captain didn’t do that, instead he watched as Fury walked back to his car, tucking his coat tighter around his frame.
Steve chuckled then, watching as Tony unknotted his own tie and used it to tie Steve’s other wrist to the headboard behind him. Steve let him do it, tested out the restraint when Tony had finished to make sure it was secure enough.
“I have no idea,” He puffed out cold air, “Look, tonight I’ve been ambushed by Hydra, shot at, and found out one of my team is in police custody so I’m asking you as a friend to help me fix this.”
He shoved his hands in his pockets for warmth, “I’ve killed phonebooks of people, Fury, don’t test me on this.”
The smile from the other end was practically screaming at him, “Captain, I told you I’d tear down your empire, didn’t I? I hope you don’t mind it being brick by brick.”
Bucky seemed to crumble in on himself, his voice soft and barely audible through the wood, “I know that. But fuck Nat, this is so messed up.”
“They used a hacksaw.” Bruce told him, pulling more gauze and vials from his bag, “Sam, morphine. Yellow label, 5mg in the syringe.”
Maybe he’d gotten it out of his system now. Last night had been intense and fun and Steve would happily do it again if Tony wanted that but maybe he could walk away now. They both had lives to lead and fortunately for Tony, those lives didn’t cross over.
Steve’s car came to a screeching halt in the middle of the shipment yard, giving no regard for parking bays or the noise he made on his approach. Steve was raging, gripping the wheel too tight, eyes catching Tony in the passenger seat, gripping the door handle for dear life as Steve took sharp corners and blinding speeds. Natasha and Thor had come with them, sitting in the back of the car with carefully guarded expressions. Steve caught Nat’s eye in the rear view mirror a couple of times on the drive and always found himself looking away, she needed reassurance and he couldn’t give her that until Rumlow was dead. Which he would be soon, Steve would make sure of it.
“We need to get on the inside.” Tony replied, “I can do it. Rhodey is working on the unit under Ross. He’s my best friend. I can get in to see Steve.”
“Mr Stark.” Peter called again. Steve smiled at him, warm and friendly. It didn’t help put Peter at ease.
Fury looked behind him quickly out the open door, checking they were still alone, “We got word of a gunfight at the shipment yard. Three Hydra dead. One Avenger shot. The turf war started yesterday evening. That’s why Ross is so riled. He needs to get Rumlow before the streets get bloody.”
Tony’s mind was faster than Steve’s, “He’s the reason Rumlow knew Bucky worked for you. He’s the reason Bucky lost…”
Steve was about to argue that he was the one to give the orders but Bucky interrupted them, eyes back on the warehouse.
Steve could only grunt in agreement, hands digging into Tony’s hips as all thoughts of teasing went out the window in favour of making Tony come hard and fucking him senseless.
The sound of his rank coming from Tony’s mouth, like a sinner blaspheming in a church and all Steve wanted to do was ask him to say it again. He’d replay the sound of Tony asking him to fuck him already until the day he died.
Steve shook his head, “It’s Rumlow. Brock Rumlow. He’s head of Hydra. We’ve got a name now. We know the bodies are being killed in the shipment yards and moved somewhere else. We just need to bring down Rumlow.”
“So, killing like that, with the skill and ease. You gotta be an army boy. But you would have flagged if you were army unless your file was redacted for some reason. I’m guessing special ops or Delta squad but that’s a guess.” Fury replied, holding his hands up at the last part.
Thor nodded, “It does make sense, Ross already has him. He won’t expect us to try and come for him. He already believes he’s won.”
He felt hollow and everything in him wanted to scream out to Tony. He couldn’t. This was the right thing to do.
Tony swallowed thickly, cock jerking in arousal and then Steve was moving, hand between Tony’s legs to find his entrance. Tony’s eyes grew wider as he felt the first blunt digit pressing against him, immediately trying to push backwards to let Steve inside. Steve chuckled at his eagerness, pushing his way into Tony’s tight warmth and relishing in the way the soft flesh gave way to his finger as he pushed deeper.
But he couldn’t help it. He’d gotten back late last night with a wad of notes in his jeans pocket and the feel of The Captain’s lips pressed against his own. The Captain. The King of Brooklyn. The most notorious gangster this side of New York and Tony had kissed him after having one conversation with a man he was pretty sure could kill him with a paperclip like he did it all the time.
Tony bucked his hips against Steve’s hand and Steve curled his fingers inside of him in return. Tony practically jumped in his arms, shoving himself down and back onto Steve’s fingers with reckless abandonment.
Sam got to work as Bruce surveyed the wound, “We need to sterilize the wound and seal it but without a hospital…”
It was Bruce who replied, “Tony, are you okay with this? You’d be lying to your best friend. You’d be manipulating him into helping free a mobster.”
It was Natasha that spoke, “They were selling guns to children.” Her voice was deadly firm and quiet. She still commanded every presence in her vicinity to take notice of her.
“You’re an Avenger now. If Rumlow comes for us, then you need to be able to protect yourself.” She replied.
Steve was slammed against the ground again, feeling something wet and sticky under him. He glanced to the side to see blood, drying and congealing onto the concrete beneath him. Bucky’s blood. Steve could feel himself sliding against it and wanted to heave.
The cops were easy now, Steve could play them at their own game. Give them what they wanted in exchange for the protection of his family. Ross wouldn’t want to make the deal but he’d need a win on this case and Steve was the prize. He’d be forced to make it. He’d get Rumlow too for his troubles so really he’d become an overnight hero.
There was something in Thor’s tone, deadly and grim, that had Steve moving to collect his boxers from the floor and shove his legs through them. He was off the bed as soon as they were on his hips and he grabbed a pair of grey joggers off the same chair Tony had stolen his t-shirt from as he followed Thor out of the room, shoving the joggers on his legs as he went.
Steve sighed, the emotion thick in his voice now, “They’re bringing in a specialised unit, head hunters. This isn’t about cop killings, not really, not anymore. They want to clean house. This guy, Ross, he’s coming for all of us. Avengers and Hydra. It doesn’t matter anymore.”
"But I'm encouraging you to sign them." Steve's statement had Clint freezing, papers tightly in his fist.
Natasha nodded, "You have the power here, Rumlow wants it. He has to go through you to get it, Steve. You really going to give it up without a fight."
Steve returned his smile, “Long. I think this unit is going to work though. Fury seems to understand that approaching these gangs head on isn’t the way to do it.”
“Then we find solutions.” Tony replied, getting up off the couch to stand with Natasha so he could see everyone properly, “I used to do this for a living, okay? Finding problems for mistakes at Stark Industries was literally my summer internship.”
The locker room wasn’t anything fancy, grey lockers with names lined up against the wall with a bench in the middle for changing. There were no cameras in here at least so Steve had a little time. He noticed one locker in the corner, a dent in the metal of the door and the word ‘Fury’ scribbled on the name tag. Steve smiled to himself as he made his way over to the locker. Well, he did need clothes and Fury was probably as close in size to him as he was going to get.
Steve’s blood left his brain, travelling south at the words Tony had spoken. A smirk curved onto his face and he couldn’t resist pulling Tony back in so he could feel the excitement Steve was getting at his words, “I should have known you’d be the boss type.”
When Bucky poked his head around the corner Steve had been planning on how to break into the morgue to see the body or the possibility of bribing a coroner for his report to see what they showed. His hand was moving of its own accord, as it always did when he was stressed, sketching in the corner of the crime scene file on his desk.
The first word out of the guy’s mouth wasn’t an exclamation of pain though, it was grovelling, and Steve hated grovelling, “Please, I don’t know anything alright? Your guys jumped me, but I don’t know anything I swear. Jesus, I swear on my life.”
“I thought I wanted this, but I don’t. I can’t. I’m sorry.” Steve sighed, dropping his head lower so he didn’t have to see the way Tony looked at him.
Steve nodded, “I’m working my own resources as well, see if I can spot any names I recognise. He’d have to be trained similarly to me to be able to prove to Hydra he can lead them. We’re looking at special ops guys.”
Steve sped up his administrations, Tony was taunt like a bow above him, frantically rolling his hips without any rhythm but the need to chase the edge of his pleasure. Steve could see him quivering with the effort to reach it, knees pressing into the edge of his thighs and his fingers were digging into Steve’s shoulders so hard he was sure it would bruise.
“Would you like me to kill him for you?” Steve asked softly, fingers squeezing Tony’s when he didn’t speak.
“Howard likes a lot of money.” Tony replied, crouching down to the nearest box and assessing the situation with his eyes.
“We can come back one day, when the heat dies down. Give it a few years and people will forget about The Captain. They’ll think you retired or died. They’ll stop looking. They’ll stop caring. We can come back; the whole family can be free of this nightmare.” Tony insisted.
She offered the envelope to him with a false smile and a tilt of her head. Steve knew if she wanted, Fury would be dead in seconds.
Tony’s eyes were dark with arousal and Steve managed to smirk at him with his mouth full of his cock, slowly drawing back up to flick the top with his tongue again. Tony’s head rolled back against the pillows with a flop, and Steve knew he’d closed his eyes. His hips stuttered against him, so Steve moved his hands to hold down Tony’s hips. He wasn’t done teasing him yet.
He couldn’t change into them until he got the cuffs off though and that was his next problem. He was debating breaking his own thumb just to slip a hand out when the door opened, and Rhodes strode into the locker room. He was shrugging off a suit jacket and frozen when he saw Steve, blinking like he didn’t believe the image in front of him.
He was expecting more resistance, more men. Perhaps Rumlow wasn’t quite so popular by Hydra standards either. Having Tony’s hand in his was a solid weight, a reminder of what he had saved tonight in exchange for his potential freedom and possibly his death. Steve squeezed it tighter as he turned around the corner.
He knew he wouldn’t be able to get Tony Stark’s face out of his mind as he ripped his heart out and Steve’s only hope was that one day, he’d understand he had ripped out his own right along with it.
Tony was already moving, feet heading for the door. He stopped short as another man climbed up the last couple of stairs, fixing Tony was a grin as he calmly walked towards him, Tony took a few steps backwards, umbrella raised in his fists.
Tony shifted, rubbing his cock against Steve’s and feeling it harden beneath him, “You’re doing just fine.”
It started to rain them, although neither of them moved, they both stared each other down as splats of rain fell around them, “How do you know I won’t just kill you after our business is done?”
T’Challa’s re-election gala. He held one every four years, whenever there was an election, or he was looking to advance his position. Steve knew he had told T’Challa he would be here; he had promised when T’Challa had help get Clint out of police custody, but he couldn’t fathom going now. He had Rumlow to deal with and Ross was likely watching his every move. This was too public, too important to T’Challa’s future.
Steve found Tony immediately, eyes drawn to him over by the drinks table. He’d been cornered by one of the politicians in a designer suit and seemed to be faking his way through a conversation Steve was sure he didn’t want to have. He approached him, set on rescuing his date from being drawn into a political debate when he noticed who Tony was talking to. The hideous fake tan looked worse under the lights and his hands were a shade darker than his face. Justin Hammer. Tony’s voice was dry and bored.
Steve’s whole body was a live wire, poised to explode at any moment. The pleasure curling into his gut was tugging at him with every thrust and slap of skin against skin. He could see it in the black of his vision as he increased his pace, slamming into Tony and sliding back out again and again.
He was on his way to shower when he found Natasha, or rather he heard her. Her voice was unmistakable in the house at any time being the only feminine voice around, but it was even clearer when she was shouting. And she was shouting.
“T’challa, is that anyway to speak to an old friend?” Steve cut him off. The wind was biting against his cheek as he crossed the deserted street, pushing the phone tighter to his ear.
“Pick a place, anywhere you want. That’s where we’ll start. Don’t tell me when you’ve decided though. You navigate, I’ll drive. I want to be surprised.”
Steve wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he arrived at Tony’s condo, his mind worrying over whether he should have called first? Tony might have been out or not wanting the company tonight. He had halfway convinced himself that perhaps turning on his heel and heading to Sam’s with everyone else would be a smarter plan, Steve might have even believed it if it wasn’t for the niggle of excitement in his gut that wanted to see Tony.
His fingers moved down, softly, barely grazed the skin, but he felt Steve freeze for a moment under his touch. They stopped just above Steve’s hip, tracing the jagged edge of skin there. Tony couldn’t see the scar, but he knew it was there. He’d seen it when they had sex, then again in the shower. It wasn’t big, a small line barely several centimetres across.
It wasn’t the phone really, but the number inside it that was causing his irrationality. Tony’s number. Steve still hadn’t called him because he said he wasn’t going to. He told Bucky he was done; it was one night, and he was walking away. Yet, he found himself staring at that phone wanting nothing more than to text Tony like it was the easiest thing in the world.
Rumlow nodded, “Maybe. Although I’m eager to see whether you’ll change your mind, or The Captain will come for you first?”
He peered up at Steve through his eyelashes, the prickling pleasure pooling in his gut. Steve was watching him, dark lust filled eyes and a heaving torso.
Steve lined himself up as Tony brought his legs up again, feeling Steve’s tip pushing against him. Steve slid in slowly, inch by torturous inch as Tony expanded around him until he was fully seated inside of him. Steve barely had time to catch his breath before Tony was wrapping his legs back around Steve’s hips and pressing them together as tightly as possible.
Steve shot back, his last bullet dodging into the guy's forehead. It was a kill shot and the body fell to the floor in a heap.
Steve, Rhodey and Fury had managed to cover up Ross’ murder perfectly. Two cops and a mob boss had the shared knowledge to make sure no one suspected a thing they didn’t want them to. Ross’ body was found two days after he was killed, down by the docks in what looked like a shoot-out gone wrong. Steve had even gone down there to fire off a couple of shots into the shipment containers from Ross’ own gun so it looked like he tried to fight back. The official story was he was a corrupt cop, working for Hydra to cover up their operation. There were bombs found at the shipment yard that supported that theory and Ross’ own phone found with his body held all the evidence needed to prove he was Hydra. He’d gone down to the docks after The Captain was in custody to assert his authority over Hydra now Rumlow was dead. Hydra hadn’t liked that and fought back. There had been a gun fight and during the struggle someone had charged at him, managing to get the upper hand and stab him in the throat, leaving him to bleed out. Fury had been assigned the case as a stroke of good luck and really everything fell neatly into place after that.
Tony knew they were done talking about it and didn’t press the issue. He grabbed a couple mugs in his hands whilst Natasha skilfully grabbed the rest and followed her out into the living room to distribute the coffee to the rest of the rag-tag family Tony had all but stumbled into.
And then what? Go after Rumlow, stop him. He’d be a wanted man, a fugitive. He’d have to leave Brooklyn and his family and Tony anyway because there was no way Ross would just let him go. But he’d be free, they could all start over. Maybe they could join him in a new city when the dust settled or maybe they could all part ways here. Bucky and Natasha could retire, they could mend their relationship and have a shot at a family. Bruce could go back to being an actual doctor and Sam could focus on the bar. He wanted to franchise once, maybe without the gang he could.
They ended up on his floor, in his office and Steve wondered whether Tony choose that room rather than the bedroom because it was less intimate. Steve followed him in there regardless, pushing the door closed behind him as he watched Tony walk over to the desk, stopping short of it with his arms folded over his chest.
“Right, but the one thing all those kills of yours had in common? They were bad people. I’m not saying you’re the good guy in this story but you are trying to make Brooklyn safer. So, I don’t think you want Hydra running around anymore than I do.” Fury stated and Steve was really starting to hate this guy. He was just being cocky now and that was normally Steve’s role.
His phone buzzed in his pocket and Tony pulled it out to see Steve’s name on the screen. It hit the message to open it up.
“A date? That’s what people do right? People still go on dates?” Steve teased, the smile on his face carefree.
The warm in his palm tingled slightly but Tony ignored it, he braced his feet on the ground and grit his teeth, preparing himself for the force of energy that he knew was coming. With a squeeze of his heavy gloved fingers around the metal, a familiar hum and a beam of pure energy aimed at the metal, Tony watched as the lock practically melted. The metal sparked, smoke filling the room before a disformed beeping echoed in Tony's ears and the door blasted open.
“Is this some sort of interview technique? Weird me out to get under my skin?” Tony pressed with a scowl.
“They call me the King of Brooklyn because they say I don’t bow to anyone.” Steve told him, “But I bow to you. I kneel to you. I’ll get on my knees and I’ll stay there if you want me to because I don’t want it without you. My titles, the gang, my freedom. Tony, I just want you. You’re the only thing that can bring me to my knees and I don’t care about anything else but you.”
Tony was smiling at him when he found the strength to pull his head back, leaning back against the passenger seat with a smile of his own, “I’m pretty sure your team heard us just now.” Tony said with a breathless laugh.
“Can you tell Tony…” Steve paused, not sure what to say. What message would be enough to convey how sorry he was. How much Steve loved him?
Luckily, Tony had grown up in these situations and was a dab hand at getting kidnapped. He could do this without Steve needing to get involved. Stark men were made of iron and Tony had always been a survivor. This prick didn’t frighten him in the slightest.
The smile that answered him was warm and friendly, “You’re right on time. Cap had to head over and help Sam with some heavy lifting at the bar, but he should be back soon. I’m Bruce, I’ll take you to your playground for the day.”
Steve was walking along the docks at a casual pace, slow and controlled like he had all the time in the world. He had told Rumlow he was on his way to hand himself over, Rumlow had won and was probably already digging Steve’s shallow grave as he walked. Steve would have made him dig it himself but then Rumlow was probably just eager to have it done so he could sit on the throne.
Not anymore. Not since he left Stark Industries and Howard in the dust and started over. He was reformed now. No more bad decisions or one-night stands. He promised Rhodey, he would get his head sorted and build a small life for himself and try and live it as best he could.
Steve wasn’t having a good day. He was running on three hours sleep, and he could now add doing the cops jobs for them on his list of things to do this week. He was tired and irritated by the time he made it back to his home base in the heart of Brooklyn. Steve wanted nothing more than a drink, a cheeseburger and a shower. He was pretty sure there was still blood on his neck despite the fact he had cleaned up his hands before he came home. A shower would have to be first, then.
Then Tony was moving, he was so fast that Steve could barely blink before Tony was moving in front of him, arm raised as his fingers flexed around the glove.
“I did at first. I didn’t want to start messing with gang stuff. I was working most days at the hospital and volunteering at a clinic downtown most nights. It’s how I met Cap actually, he used to come into the clinic as a kid when he needed treatment. Not many people can afford healthcare these days, I volunteer there to do what I can to help them.”
Steve looked down at it. There was blood staining his cuff, “There was a situation. I took care of it.”
He gripped onto Tony for dear life, riding through the aftershocks of his release with a few more shallow thrusts before his body finally relaxed and Steve found he could breath again.
“I sorta like having you around too, big guy.” Tony told him, the strength of those words carrying in the space between them.
“We’re still waiting on Sam and Clint. They were patrolling the shipment yards today. Trying to find Rumlow’s operation.” Natasha told him softly, crossing her arms over her body.
“I don’t know.” Fury sighed, “They aren’t due for a couple of days. Unit’s being headed by a man named Thaddeus Ross. We’ve crossed paths, he’s old school. Brutal and efficient, you can’t reason with him or buy him off. It’d be like offering up paper to stop a hurricane.”
“Tony…” Steve’s voice was curious when he felt Tony tie the knot around his wrist, realising what Tony had in mind.
“Right you are, Captain.” Thor replied gleefully, bringing his hammer up once more. Steve could see the red blood slick again the metal and splattered onto Thor’s face from the back spray.
“Okay, well we know he’s alive. Rumlow would have left his body for you to find if he wasn’t. The real question is how did they know to take him?” Natasha questioned. Her mind always managed to keep up with Steve’s, even on his best day.
“Well then, maybe you can talk some sense into him. I can get him immunity, but you all need to stay above board on this. Let us deal with Hydra. When Ross gets here, there can’t be any doubt that you’re running your own agenda.” Fury explained.
He spun them around, pinning Tony against the edge of the desk with his hands on either side of him to trap him in. Tony looked gleeful, rewarding him with another kiss as his hands ran down Steve’s chest until his fingers delved into his boxers to push them down as well. Steve stepped out of them as Tony’s hand landed on his cock, stroking him once, twice and a third time until Steve was letting out a groan of his own.
Natasha was waiting for him at the front door, clearly she had been watching for his arrival. Tony gave her a small wave as he made his way to her. Was this his life now? Meeting with gang members, being an active member. A part of him wondered whether it was smart to accept Natasha’s offer or whether he should have simply walked away when Steve gave him that out. The thought of Steve in a cold grey cell just didn’t sit right with him, Tony knew he couldn’t leave Steve there, not even to save his own skin. It went against everything he knew about survival but here he was, greeting Natasha and slipping into the warmth of Steve’s family home to help a man who didn’t even want him anymore.
“Of course not. Sam’s babysitting.” Natasha replied with a smile, “I can kick him out and tell him to come back tomorrow?”
Steve nodded eagerly as Tony bit his own lip. He slipped his own shirt over his head as if to show Tony he was committing to this and then Tony was drawing him back into the circle of his thighs, hands grabbing at Steve’s sides as their lips fused together once more.
Ross wasn’t moving, his eyes were frozen in panic. Tony had killed him. He’d killed him. He had to. He wasn’t going to stop, he was going to come for Steve, for Natasha and Thor and Sam and Bruce. For Tony. They wouldn’t have been safe. He was Hydra, he was a bad person.
