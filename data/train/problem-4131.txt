Too bad, it’s not clamorous enough.
“You want some?”
“Yes”. He tilts his head and looks attentively. “Tell me, what happened.”
“Then how did happened, that you came home from work late?”
Castiel stands up and pets Dean’s head.
Dean’s snicker slowly fades, and he lets out muffled uh-huuuh into Benny’s lips.
“As you always do” He grabs Dean’s jeans, underwear and shirt from the floor and leaves the kitchen.
Dean exhales. His cock twitches in his jeans, responding to this slight stimulation, and Castiel surely can feel it. He smiles again and leans back to take a look. And to touch with his hand, too - fingers grope gently to asses the progress. Dean bites his lip, trying to hold back a smile, this is so…
He changes the angle of his thrusts, crooking his fingers a bit, to make a room for his mouth, but it makes the whole Dean's body twitch.
“Yes, Castiel” Dean does as he’s told.
“Yeah, sure” Dean nods approvingly. Absolutely no doubts about it. If to talk about work, Benny is the most qualified, hardworking and overall smart sonovabitch he has ever worked with. And damn, he doesn’t want to lose his best guy. His right hand, to be honest.
“Yeah”
“Just a little bit…” Dean mumbles, hugging him tighter.
“Yes.”
“Where are you going, Benny?” Castiel’s voice is polite, but he is not impressed, clearly.
Castiel notices his hesitation and nervous twitching of his face.
He pursues his lips, like what he means is obvious.
“Do you want it?”
Well, it takes few second for Benny to look away from Dean’s ass, as he finally understands Cas’ hand is not going anywhere down. For now. He looks up to meet Castiel’s eyes.
Dean, rolls his eyes.
Castiel is pleased. The view is incredibly beautiful.
Someday, I’ll be able to leave your room, leave you out of my sight, and don’t feel growing panic in my chest.
“Dean are you good? Should we add more lube?”
And I’m crying.
Dean nods in confirmation, swallowing hard.
“Like this?” His voice gets quieter.
“He’s umm… he’s not that tight anymore”
I nod. I’m not sure I can speak.
He grits his teeth.
Tea. Now he’s asked to stay for a fucking tea, oh god!
“I umm..” After a fumbling second, he puts them into his pockets. “I kinda thought we should…”
Dean is edging. Just from having a cock in his mouth.
Bring him back to me.
“With what you did? Come on, man! You literally… how was I supposed to say No??”
Dean finishes his coffee.
He turns his look away from Dean’s underwear to grab the lube and pop the lid open. It’s been years, dammit, and Dean is not sure how the hell it became nearly (nearly, huh?) Pavlovian, but every time he hears this sound his head turns dizzy. Christ…
Dean is busy with unbuttoning his shirt, there’s nothing under it, and Benny notes to himself, that not only Dean’s ass looks good, his boss’ bare shoulders and chest do certain things to him, too. Or it’s the look that Dean appreciates his cock with, it’s like he’s eating it with his eyes.
“You not dead?” He asks, tilting his head.
“…and I just hope, that you’re okay too. With everything. And we can, like… move on? We’re kind of buddies, aren’t we?”
I told him I love him.
“I want to stay” It’s loud and clear.
Tongue swirls around the tip, and Benny takes a deep breath.
“Hey, bookworm, you home?”
“Show me.”
“Now?”
Day goes on as usual.
“Oh god!” he hears in response, and it makes him loose it.
It’s completely unsanitary, but Cas doesn’t fucking care, because Dean looks fucking spectacular. Absolutely naked, wet with sweat, with his eased cock and deep breath. Beautiful. Cas loves to see him like that. He wants to touch, and he run his fingers through his chest. Dean captures his hand and pulls it to his mouth. He kisses Cas’ palm, his fingers, his knuckles.
Now th… ? Okay.
For Benny to fuck him.
Dean gives him a smooch.
“Oh, I’m having him”
“Father?” My eyes are open, but I can’t see clearly, the light is blinding me. “It’s time to go home. I’m here to take you home...” I want to reach this light, I want to touch it, I want to feel it. But I’m too weak, my arms won’t move, my body is numb.
There’s a knock on the door.
I want to soothe him. I hold him, and feel his hand pulls the back of my head to hold me even tighter. I feel his stubble on my neck. I feel his heart beating frantically in his chest.
He even bought a decent desk and a cozy sofa. Not that he prefers sitting behind the table over getting under the hood of some nice car, but now he knows it a significant part of his daily life. Emails have to be written, photos and videos have to be uploaded to the website, spare parts orders completed, etc, etc. He’s okay with that. He likes his office.
He kisses Dean’s neck.
“Breathe, Benny” He says .“Pull it out and close your eyes. Breathe”
“On us. If we’re okay”
Benny’s voice comes out shaky and little higher, than he expected it to be.
Benny resumes. “But what..?”
“50 bucks, he will” Cas raises his eyebrows.
“You are here, you are saved. You will never get back there. You’re back, you’re here. You’re home”, - he says it, and he says it, and he repeats it all over again. And I’m not sure now, whether he tells it to me, or to himself. As I look into his face, I can see now, I understand what he feels.
“Like it?” He moves his chin up and down, rubbing.
“Yes”
Castiel is very pleased with Benny’s reaction.
He looks courteous and pleased with himself.
Now he needs to make sure Benny sees and understands what’s going on, because his only view is Dean’s back. Which is as Cas planned. So thanks god, Dean’s belt makes the loud noise being unbuckled.
“What?”
Cas cups Dean’s chin and rubs his nose on his temple, grin shamelessly wide on his face.
“Hey, hey! Cas, look at me. Look at me!” Dean holds my face within his hands, I can see that his eyes are still wet.
“So,” – I begin, but stop there. I can feel I’m starting to shake again, I swallow hard. I need to breathe. I need to breathe, oh god.
“Oh course he is,” Dean mumbles between smooches “He’s hilarious!”
“Can you please don’t interrupt me?”
“Uh… like, facing you?” Dean decides to specify.
“Jesus! You really think it’s that bad?”
They breathe.
Fuck, Benny, please. Kiss me, like you should…
“Open your fly and take yourself out”
“I wanted just… you know. Check one more time.”
“What do you mean?” Dean pours himself a coffee.
I remember drifting. I remember sticky darkness, filled with desperate crying. So many voices, they merged together in a never ending noise. It’s loud, is so loud, I can’t take it, my head is exploding. It’s driving me insane, I can’t make it stop. I can’t make them stop. I can’t even discern my own voice, but I know it’s there, I know, I’m screaming too.
“What, like, being hanged by one leg or something?” All other BDSM shit he has seen runs before his eyes. If these two into dom thing and sub thing, maybe they’re up to something even weirder?
Cas can’t read Dean’s mind, but he sure has his own. They differ slightly, although may seem the same at first. He holds Dean tight by the neck, and his other hand slowly makes it’s way down to Dean’s fly.
“Benny, do you understand? Hold him”
Dean wants to feel Benny’s hands on his bare skin, he wants to hear sounds Benny will make, thrusting hard into his ass. He wants to taste Benny’s cock, he wants to suck it so bad. He wants to hear Castiel tells him how good he looks while Benny fucks him. He wants, and he wants, and he wants. Fuck, these wants are so embarrassing, but it feels so good.
Cas sits at the table, back to Dean, face on his laptop, he sips his tea, continuing working.
“Of course you wasn’t. Because you was thinking a lot about it, you were prepared, and it was your decision to do it” Cas continues to explain, making himself a sandwich.
“Do you?”
“I’m here”, I hear myself saying. “I’m here, Dean”, I put my hands on top of his
If Cas puts it this way…. If he asks Dean, then he’s allowing this to happen. He WANTS this to happen. Benny needs some persuasions, he said? Well...
“Because you were on your knees?”
“Not really.” Cas shrugs. “Two articles, both boring. You?” He sips from his enormous cup.
"I do. And you like him too." Cas murmurs softly, then bites Dean’s earlobe.
“Dean will blow you now. If you last 10 minutes, you’re in”
Dean takes out another fifty in silence.
Cas stands up from his chair. He walks around to the other side of the table and leans to Deans head.
“Do you want to kiss it?”
Dean’s pupils are slightly widened, he’s jittery too. He looks back at Castiel, question in his eyes.
Cas moves to Dean’s head, leans over the table on his elbows, right above Deans face, but upside down, and their noses practically rub against each other.
Okay, perhaps he will simply obey this voice, because it is kind of impossible not to. It makes him lose his nerve for sure, but he quickly puts himself together, not to look stupid. But he enters the kitchen and sits on the nearest chair anyway.
You are so warm.
He deadpans at Cas, but Cas deadpans back.
Benny’s confused, this is a little awkward, isn’t it? He likes these two, but why would he watch them making out? Or they’re about to quit it, and continue with drinking? And what’s with the tone? Cas doesn’t talk that way. Usually.
“Yeah, okay…”
He’s a little early. It’s not even 8:45, but he walks up the stairs to his office. It’s just a room on the second floor of this loft, that is his repair workshop, but it’s nice, he has furnished it by himself.
Cas presses closer, peppering Dean's neck with kisses. "Just cool?" He mumbles in between.
“Do you want to come?”
The light, again. Soft shimmering.
“Nah, not that much”
“Fuck..!” Benny immediately throws his head up, looking at the kitchen ceiling. Oh his knees?? He has to..
It’s so quiet.
“But, you’d like it.”
Cas is looking directly into his eyes now.
“Oh, Jesus…”
Dean lifts his head and turns it over his shoulder to meet Benny’s gaze.
His gaze is so smooth. His smile is so soft.
I deserve you.
He leans in and licks on burning hot skin of Dean’s rim.
Dean lets go suddenly, he breathes heavily and closes his eyes.
“Faster”
Oh, Christ...
“You just hit the right spot, look at him”
Hand, still in Cas’ hair, helps him to calm down. It’ll be okay, everything’s gonna be okay.
“Bedroom time?” He kisses Dean’s cheek.
Dean kneels.
Dean counts his slowly fading inhales and exhales.
Fingers wander on warm skin, soothing and gentle.
“Yeah..”
It looks, like he’s hesitant, but he surely plays it well. Everything went just wonderful, as he has planned, and even better! Now it’s time for a final divine move.
Benny changes the angle, he leans and grabs Dean’s shoulder. If he likes it hard, Benny’s gonna give it ho him hard. And he does. And he hears it.
Castiel is very pleased. He nods.
Same room, same spot. You. Alive.
“Yeah..” Hoarse and quiet.
A hook.
Benny wants to remove the condom and come all over Dean’s open mouth. Fuck. He won’t say anyone, but he wants Dean to come on him, too, he wants to let him release himself on his chest, on his face, whatever... anywhere he’d like to.
But… is this enough? What you feel about me? What I feel about you? To deserve you? Do I deserve you, do I?
For fairness. Because.
“Cuddly much today?”
“Fuck him, like you’d fuck him with your cock, Benny. Pretend your fingers to be your cock”
“And this?”
Benny rolls a condom down his length, he is surprised he’s still hard, considering his emotional condition.
“Hey!” Dean nods and sips on his second cup of coffee. He’s calm. All is well. It’s very good, that he has a cup in his hands, at least he knows, what to do with them. Because Benny clearly doesn’t know where to place his.
Cas waits for him in the doorway and kisses gently, when Dean is finally close enough. He walks first, and Dean hugs him from behind, following. It’s not very much comfortable to continue walking like that, but they do, clumsily waddling from foot to foot. Dean hums something, kissing the back of Cas’ neck, and Cas laughs.
Do I deserve you?
Sure they need.
This little word made Benny’s dick twitch. Normally he’s only half hard during this, licking is more of a foreplay, usually. But now… it’s different.
“Don’t break your jaw”
Benny rises his head and looks into his eyes.
“Well, goodbye, Benny. See you soon”
Dean nearly faints, he moans around his own fingers and takes them deeper into his mouth. Fuck. It’s been minutes, but he’s already too close.
“Sure, it’s okay” Cas nods, now pleased. “You’re not interrupting anything. Because we’re not shy” To Dean - “Are we?”
He looks.
“You may continue” He says.
Dean laughs softly.
“Please”
Castiel has lost count of points, but these two really worth each other, and that’s the main thing. He is pleased. With everything.
“Right” Dean finally reaches for this glass of water, he empties it in few gulps and exhales deeply. “Oh, that’s better”
“Do you?”
“You gonna make him feel good, aren’t you?”
Slowly, he exhales, and he speaks:
“Yeah....” He whispers.
I love you.
Benny’s tongue slides in so easy, he reaches as far as he can with it’s length. Dean moans loudly:
Benny's eyes are open, he leans in and kisses Dean again, basically, just presses his own closed lips to Dean’s, and holds just a bit longer. He doesn’t want to make his boss feel uncomfortable, after all. Except for, when he breaks a kiss, Dean reaches and kisses him back. It’s quick and fumble, but it makes Benny’s heart jump. Now they look at each other, eyes wide, breaths silenced. Fuck, the air is suddenly thick with tension. It’s unbearable. It’s either to let it happen, or to forget and never come back to it. And well, it’s only one step over fear.
“Yeah, sure. Sure…” Dean nods, he’s not grinning anymore. Actually, yeah. It’s not funny. “I understand, it’s a process. I just thought, you know… there will be no “denial” phase. I mean, after… what we did.”
Benny smiles. It’s a good smile, he feels good and completely relaxed, finally. Something about this robe has changed the situation.
He does.
“Yes” It came out quiet and hoarse, but it’s there.
Benny is sitting in his chair, losing his shit, losing his mind, losing the last pieces of his composure and common sense.
He pulls his hand out of Dean’s pants, brings it to his own face and licks a tip of his middle finger.
“Sure?”
Hand on my face, thumb lightly stroking my cheekbone. Soothing.
Castiel is very pleased, and their smiles grow wider with his words.
“Help him a little, would you? Lean closer and hold his legs”
“What do you mean?” Dean holds up his head.
“Yes”
“Oh, not now!” Cas finally laughs too. “You gonna tell me later, darling” he leans to kiss Dean’s forehead, both giggling like idiots.
You wanna be professionals?
It finally fits me.
Cas leans his elbow on a table and reaches his hand to him, palm up. He looks.
Today someone was in a desperate need to make an exception and knock on the door. Dean knows who it is.
Benny does.
Dean does, tossing his jeans and underwear down on the floor.
“I..” He clears his throat, hoping it will make his voice stronger. “Fuck. I wanna fuck”
Kissing noises turn into smooching noises, and when their lips are finally break apart, Castiel rises his head up, but Dean continues with kissing his neck.
Benny grins wider, and he grabs Dean by the hair. He fucks in once, only half, slowly, and Dean lets out a low groan of encouragement.
“Yes… I kissed him!”
Benny isn’t sure if his legs not gonna fail him, but he gets up anyway. Dean looks up, and their eyes meet for the first time since Benny left the kitchen. It’s way more than just awkward, but the need wins, and every Benny’s step closer makes their hearts run faster.
I put my coffee cup on a table. Dean follows. It is impossible to look at his face, same as take my hand back from his. We remain silent for a little longer. We look at our hands, clasped together.
“Ouch. Cold?” Cas's face torts with an apologetic and sympathetic expression.
“Dizzy. But fine, I’ll be fine”. I’m trying to get up on my elbows, but Dean holds me down.
How good does it feel to be “finally free”, remind me?
“Um…” Dean swallows. Well, damn… But he didn’t even thought about it at that moment, and he had no chance to slide anything in between Benny’s flow. “No.”
Hand leaves his body alone in fast movement, and Dean sucks the air into his lungs, he nearly falls down in abruptness.
Castiel’s eyebrows rise.
Cas grins into his cup of coffee.
“Cas…” He starts, but he doesn’t know how to continue this sentence. And he certainly have no idea why the hell Cas is grinning so wide. And why the hell he laughs?
He swallows hesitantly, but goes on.
On the inside, Castiel burst out with joy, this is his best score so far, he’s so proud with himself, he could scream. On the outside, he tilts his head and bites on his lip, like he’s considering it.
“Very good” Castiel kisses his forehead. “Now pull your knees up to your chest and wrap them with your hands.”
Dean does. He plans. He examines every inch with attentive patience. He's facinated with the tence of skin and the rhythm of pulsation. He wants to trace all these veins with his tongue. Unfortunately, he doesn't have time for this now. He even questions in his head, if Castiel has limited this to ten minutes for Benny of for him, because he, surely, can do this play for a ridiculous amount of time.
Cas enters the kitchen, holding Dean’s robe.
Dean keeps on giggling, and he pulls Cas’s face closer.
Dean squirms. Yes, his boy is like this. He is fucking like this, precisely.
And he leans closer to replace his finger with his tongue. Its a single lick but the moan that escapes Dean’s mouth works better than any persuasion.
“Yes”
Castiel sits on the bed near to the pillow, he takes the other one, puts is on top and adjusts a little, patting it casually, so it lays comfy against the headboard on his left. He takes the towel and puts it on the other side, next to his right thigh. Lube goes the same way. He rises his eyes on Dean and smiles.
His thumb strokes delicate skin behind Dean’s balls, it slides up, every time other two fingers thrust inside, and down, when he practically takes them out.
He needs to think, actually.
“He… was standing on the way. He…kissed me. He kissed me” God, that was hard to pronounce.
“Isn’t it lovely?” He hears from behind.
“You do this often, huh?” Benny surprises himself hearing he's actually asking this question. At least, he made it sound casual and even a little mocking, Dean won’t guess, this is the thing that really bothers Benny.
“Fuck!
“And you gonna let him” Cas nods.
“You should rest. Not sure if you’re able to sleep now, but you staying in bed until you feel better, okay?” he’s holding my hand in his, rubbing his thumb on my knuckles.
"Eat!" I say.
I dare to kiss the top of your head, I dare to cover your knuckles with my palm, carefully, not to wake you up.
“Umm… two?” He asks.
“Do you want it?”
“Aww, it’s nothing!” Benny waves off at him with his lubed fingers, and this finally makes Cas crack with laughter. He leans back to Dean's face again
“Did you?”
You mutter something dissatisfied about peanut butter and jelly under your nose, but I won't even listen.
“Uh-huh…”
“Two”
Dean is knocked out. His eyes are wide with amazement. Cas just asked him WHAT? Okay wait… Dean, Dean doesn’t even know. He never thought about it like… that. He’s happily married man and he’s in love with his husband. That’s it. And Benny, he's cool, yeah. He likes Benny. Benny is funny, he’s a good worker, though. Benny is smart. Benny is handsome. Benny is strong. His arms are so strong, his shoulders… Dean had never thought about Benny like that. Or…
But wait, no. He’s not into sucking, right? And he’s not allowed to, that’s not what Castiel asked him to do. And there’s Dean’s hole right in front of his face, so soft and relaxed already, willing to take him in. His tongue, at least. But hey, if there’s a tongue, there’s a finger too, eventually. And then, perhaps…
“Yes what?”
Castiel’s hands move onto his back and pull him closer. He rises his head and rests his chin on Dean’s fly, and his hands become slightly more demanding. Dean gasps.
“Really? It looks like you guys got tired of my company” Benny laughs back.
“Yes…”
“We’ll talk about this later..” Cas tries his best to kiss him, but Dean just won’t shut up.
“But tell me, do you want it? Do you really want to go home?”
“My condolences” Cas deadpans.
Dean, who has his old habit to take shower right after he comes home from work (man can get a little greasy sometimes, okay?) nods assuredly. He kinda thought they’re going to have thee conversation, but… Cas offers a better option, by all means. Sure, he’s patient enough. Besides, he needs his time to get ready, too.
Sam came back from the store, I stand in the kitchen, taking out groceries and stuff out of the shopping bags. Among everything, I see he bought a super glue, I have no idea, what he needs this for.
He looks a Castiel with his widen eyes, and Castiel tilts his head to the side.
It’s not fair! It's not...
That is not what Castiel meant. And Benny is clearly having a ridiculously good time, but he shouldn’t. It’s not a “fun” anymore, he has to take it seriously, so Castiel makes sure he does. He didn’t plan to touch Benny today, but well, it’s time to improvise a little.
“I want Benny to lick my ass”
p.s.: once again this is kinky. Kinky!
“Did you?” Thumb presses hard.
Cas pulls Dean closer, wrapping his arms around him. One hand goes to the back of Dean’s head, lips and tongue caress soft skin of his neck. Other one strokes the small of his back, light, lazy circular motions. Cas pulls his shirt up, and then his hand slowly slides down into his jeans, down between underwear and skin. And he can hear Dean’s barely audible “Fuck…..” against his own ear.
Castiel knew, he fucking knew it would be much easier for both of them to just fuck first. Asshole. But he was absolutely right, and his plan has worked perfectly.
His vision is slightly blurred for a second, like he just got back from lethargic dream, but he manages to focus on piercing blue eyes.
Your hands are cold. You’re so weak, you can’t stand by yourself, you can’t even speak. But before you passed out, you looked at me. You looked at me, and I saw my own eyes reflect in yours. And that was enough to believe this is real.
Dean realises the importance of the task assigned for him. He saw the expression on Benny’s face. He understood. Yeah, it’s not about sucking guys dick. It’s about breaking the wall inside his head.
Benny is ready to jizz into his pants, honestly, he’ve never seen anything like this in his life and it leaves him knocked down.
He kisses again.
enjoy ;)
“Yeah…”
How come, it’s been months already?
“Yeah, kind of..” Benny shrugs, like it’s nothing.
Ding! It’s fucking not even 9 am, and Dean’s vallet has lost a certain amount of it’s insides already.
He pops the lid of lube open.
“Fuck!” Benny gasps.
“Don’t get me wrong, it was awesome. I mean…” his face winces a little, in realisation of what he had just blurted out, but he continues. “This… this was very interesting… experience. You get me?”
Fuck. Dean puts himself up on this elbows and meets Benny’s gaze, he’s not ashamed anymore, he just wants it to go on and on.
At the beginning of their relationships they used to do it verbally, Dean always had to say it out loud. For both of them to be sure, he wants it. It took him some courage, but with time, he quit mumbling and hiding his expression, it was slowly becoming more and more open on his face. Castiel was so fond of him, so proud. Until one day Dean just looked at him, and plea was written on his face so explicitly, Castiel didn’t need any words.
Castiel waits.
“Yes, before Dean asked for his little break”
Castiel strokes his knee lightly, as he watches attentively everything that is happening a little lower.
I’d like to tell you, how YOU changed me.
“Yeah. Now pull it out a little, and fuck in again, slowly”
“It was.” Dean kisses his cheek. “Cruel..” kisses his neck “…well thought…” kisses his collarbone “…seduction plan.”
How easy is it? To declare love. And how impossibly hard it is to finally understand, that you need an answer, still.
As far as he knows, it is slightly complicated and way more interesting with male asses, with the prostate thing and all that, right? Unfortunately, his knowledge is limited with a few bisexual threesomes videos he had watched accidentally long time ago. That’s it. So he really hopes Castiel will help him here, because his will to make Dean feel good stands strong. But, probably, he can start with his own decisions? He may have a few thoughts here.
These fuckers have no idea, how many times he wanted to slap Dean’s ass, every time he bend over some car, exposing his perfect shape. How many times he caught himself on a thought that Dean is prettier than any girl Benny have ever fucked. How many times Benny looked at pen between Dean’s lips and thought they'd look just perfect with a dick between them, rather than a pen. But those were just thoughts, because, well, his boss is a fucking cake.
Fuck. Fuck…
How can this be real? I’m struggling to restore memories, to bring pieces together.
“I miss him,” Dean wanted to say.
Castiel tried to move but he still felt dizzy from hitting his head. So, he was stuck, his back against the tree and the mysterious demon watching him from above, taunting him.
He stopped dead in his track when they both heard a noise in the distance, the cracking of branches very audible in the quiet of the night. Cas seized the opportunity and twisted the angel blade in Blondie’s hand, ramming it into his chin and up his skull. The demon’s eyes flashed for a moment, but it was a quick death. The angel withdrew the blade and while Blondie’s lifeless body plummeted to the ground, Cas was already on the move to escape from the other stranger. He wasn’t there to see the corpse go up in smoke. He ran, no longer following a path but running through the woods aimlessly, hoping to find a good place to hide.
Jack, looking crazy complete, turned around to face the boys. For the first time in a while he actually seemed happy. Even if Dean didn’t have Cas back, he still felt proud of the kid. And Cas would have felt the same.
Dumbfounded, Castiel tilts his head at the other and exclaims, eyebrows furrowed: “I don't understand, Dean. Why do you suddenly want to learn a different language?”
He didn’t recognize the attacker though. It was a tall man with long blonde hair and a beard. Castiel knew it couldn’t be an angel, so he had to be a demon. The demon was standing over him, his eyes went wide open, his expression that of a lunatic. He flashed black eyes at the angel before he spoke.
“Well, if it isn’t the angel Castiel,” he heard a female voice shout behind his back.
“I cared about the whole world because of you.”
He turned around to pin down the source of this noise and found himself confronted with four angels, one of them Hester. Her expression filled with anger. Next to her stood Inias, Esther and Esper. Cas was confused about Inias confronting him, since they had parted on good terms; but everyone changes, even angels. Cas took a step back to create some distance between them while figuring out whether he was in actual danger.
This was impossible, wasn’t it? Was Dean there with him? Cas glanced around, scanning the vast trees and the path ahead of him. But Dean was nowhere to be seen.
Amara was still observing the boys, her facial expression a mixture of sympathy and concern.
Sam remembered Amara, who had wanted to help them and who had been consumed by her brother.
he former angel does not know what to expect, and frankly, he would do whatever Dean wanted him to, but his answer still comes unexpectedly: “You know what I really want to do, Cas? Learn Spanish.”
he could do to stop the tears from falling. There was no reason to be strong anyway, no one to be strong for. They had already lost, and he would never get Cas back. And it was all Dean’s fault.
God-kid and hug the crap out of him. It felt like a weight had been lifted from him. So, there was a way to bring Cas back after all. But Dean was still on pins and needles, not quite sure how they could save the angel.
Cas observes the wrinkles between Dean’s eyebrows, indicating his increasing frustration and further amplified by the tremble in his voice. He pulls his lover closer, wrapping his arms around the blonde. Craving the comfort, Dean rests his head on his boyfriend’s chest. Soothed by the sound of Castiel’s heartbeat, he resumes: “I went to heaven, Cas.” The former angel earnestly replies: “Of course you’ll go to heaven, Dean. If you didn’t get to go to heaven, who would?” Dean cannot help but smile at this answer because it is so reminiscent of the confession that Cas gave just two weeks ago.
The former angel tilts his head, still seemingly alarmed, and consoles him: “It’s alright, you’re doing now, Dean. I am okay now. You, me, Sam, Jack, Eileen. We’re alive. And it’s over. Do you want to talk about it?”
Still distraught by the dream, Dean elaborates: “I was there. In heaven. And you know who wasn’t there? You, Cas. And I didn’t even care. All I cared about was finding Sam and driving around in the Impala and listening to this goddamned song by Kansas. There I was, you know, driving somewhere, to a bridge, to reunite with my family, finally. And the only person eventually arriving there was Sam and I was happy. How could I be happy without you? After everything we’ve been through. I don’t wanna lose you again, even if I’d somehow get through it. I wanna be with you for as long as I can and make the most of it. We’ve earned this.”
“Thank you, Sam and Dean. This world is lucky to have you. You stepped up when the universe was falling apart. You stepped up even in the face of inevitable doom. My brother… he will have plenty of time to learn his lesson now. And you’re finally free to just be and do whatever you like, without enemies breathing down your neck all the time. But something is not right, yet. You’re not truly happy, or are you, Dean?”
A small giggle escapes the former angel’s chest at the ludicrousness of them, considering themselves to be out of work. They have rarely ever been able to catch a break in between the various villains they have faced, and their newfound freedom still feels surreal. So far, most of their time has been spent binging through all the Netflix they have missed out on, but eventually they will have to figure out where their next step lies. For the first time in forever, though, Cas is truly happy and at peace, knowing that whatever they choose to do, they will not have to fear for their lives anymore. Nevertheless, his expression and voice quickly turn serious again, as he tries to reassure Dean: “This sounds like Chuck’s ending, you know. He would have enjoyed this. But we…, you, you defeated him, and he can’t hurt you anymore.”
He looked more human than celestial, Crowley realized and wondered what he had missed out on.
Sam stepped closer to his brother and patted his back, signaling that he
. It’s – it’s just us anymore. We’re all… all alone.”
The angel huffed in exhaustion and was just about to continue on his path when he felt something slam into him… not something, someone.
Much to Dean’s surprise, she looked at them fondly, not an ounce of anger in her expression as she greeted them: “Hello, boys. I almost thought I’d never see you again.”
So, this chapter is not really as content-heavy as the last and next chapter, but I hope you'll enjoy it nonetheless.
That night Dean had also found a truth of his own… that the anger, despair, and rage that had seemed to accompany him every single day, every hour, and every minute in the past few years was not equivalent to who he was as a person. Cas made him realize that there was more to him than that. In reality, his sudden outbursts, his “shoot first and ask questions later” attitude, his alcoholism only arose from the fear of not being able to save his family, whom he loved more than he could ever put in words. And he has always had issues with putting his feelings into words. Cas made it seem so easy as the words came from his mouth almost naturally. They originated from a place of honesty and deeply rooted devotion, which had developed over the last decade and only grown after all of the battles fought and trauma shared.
gone? Garth, Charlie, Jody, Donna, the girls. We don’t have
Cas used the situation to try and reason with his brother and sisters: “Don’t you understand? We don’t have to kill each other. After eons, only two people have made it out of the Empty. And I have done it before. I’m your only way out. You can either come with me and maybe get a second chance at life, or you can stay here forever, haunted by your regrets, your enemies.”
Loving Dean felt different than loving Sam or Jack, and at first, Cas did not comprehend, no matter how many times their friends and enemies alike used the word love to describe the relationship between the angel and the hunter. From the day he first met Dean, when he gripped him tight and raised him from perdition, he was stuck on him. No matter how lost and confused he felt, Cas knew that he could trust Dean. And what started as fascination and curiosity, quickly turned into something more profound as they got to know each other.
But this time was different. Hopeless. Gut-wrenching. And there was nothing he could do. When Cas had confessed his love, he had ripped his heart right out of his chest. And once he got taken by the Empty, he took it right down there with him. And now Dean was all alone with no way of getting Cas out of that goddamned hellhole.
The corners of Cas’ mouth turned up into a smile and before the demon knew what was happening, the angel turned hunter had closed the distance between them and embraced him in a hug, albeit an awkward hug. The demon froze, unsure how to react to the sudden affection. The angel patted his back and he finally melted into the embrace. It was most likely the first time, in hundreds of years, that anyone had showed him physical affection, Cas thought. Eventually, Cas let go and took a step back, smiling awkwardly at his battle companion. Unsure whether it had been the right decision to hug Crowley, he stood in front of him, his arms randomly flopping around and his posture less warrior-like, than it had been a decade ago.
“It- it was terrible, Cas. It felt so real, so real, and it felt as if Chuck had won after all”, Dean finally speaks.
“Cas…”
“I love you.” And at that, the bottle was empty. Dean was furious, but he was also lost. Desperate, he threw the bottle on the ground, hard. It shattered into pieces.
So, the angel followed the trail while he watched the fallen leaves dance in the wind. Still, no one seemed to be around. Purgatory was never this quiet. Maybe he had ended up in the Empty after all. The cold winter air felt crisp in Cas’ lungs, adding to the eerie atmosphere.
“You here, already? How did you die this time? Wait, let me guess, saving Dean? Or did the guys who save the world not succeed this time around?” the King of Hell exclaimed with genuine concern, even though he tried to play it off.
Dean recalled their conversation at the diner and how genuinely concerned she had seemed. Still stricken with remorse, he made the first move and apologized.
“It was all my fault. If only I hadn’t asked you to go with me… then you’d still be here, and you would know what to do. No matter how messy the situation, it was always easier knowing we had each other. Just- Just tell me what to do. How to… get you back. And what to do about Chuck. You get your feathery ass up here right now and you tell me. Damn it! I can’t do this without you.”
At this point, his body was shaking, chest heaving, and tears were streaming down his face uncontrollably. Dean was desperate. As a human, he couldn’t simply enter the Empty. One would have to be an angel or a demon in order to do so. The hunter would rather be a demon for the rest of his life than leave Cas rotting in the Empty. But there were no more angels and demons left, no vampires or werewolves either… just nothing.
“I love you, Cas.”
Jack replied this time around, smiling: “Actually, we already have a few things in mind. Heaven and Hell, the Empty, Purgatory. Chuck created all this…”, he glanced around and gesticulated towards the trees, the flowers and the people sitting in a café on the other side of the street and continued: “… and he just abandoned it when he should have taken responsibility for his creation. He had the power to help people and he chose to do the opposite. He wrote himself into the story, but he was always the villain… Only using his powers to hurt people. He only ever used his power to play with us, humanity and all of creation. But we believe that together we can make up for a lot of Chuck’s… mistakes.”
“Well, only dead – or almost dead – angels and demons can enter the Empty. So, you will have to… go through some big changes. I’d go in there alone, but we don’t know whether the Empty will be on our side. Before Billie got me out of there, they said that
“You take all the time you need, kiddo. We’ll be around for you,” Dean said, facing towards Jack.
“Well, I was sleeping the big sleep … dreaming of my worst nightmares, my biggest regrets. Until there was a bang. No clue where that came from. So, I woke up and found myself in this… world. Angels and demons started attacking each other left and right. And now I found you. The Winchesters will leave no stone unturned until they’ve brought you back, right? They would never leave their most priced chicken behind.”
“Damn it, Cas!”
“Unbelievable… we need to restore order, Castiel. And the first step is killing you, whatever that means in here,” Hester remarked confidently.
“We should get going, then. Maybe, this time around someone can finally put that fire within you out, Dean Winchester,” Amara said softly.
Dean was exhausted and lost in all his thoughts and memories of Cas. His voice was merely a whisper when he continued to speak.
Cas looked him in the eyes and said: “No, Dean- they’re okay… It’s- It’s kind of a long story. We should probably get somewhere save first. Let’s go.” At that, the unlikely duo hit the road.
“What do you mean what is happening here? I just… I just got here. I’m not even sure we are in the Empty.”
Ever since he stopped considering heaven his home, he had struggled with his identity and what his future could look like. The only constant fragment of his identity had been his role as a protector and friend of the Winchesters and, later, a father to Jack; family was the only thing that ever felt right and true even when everything around them fell apart again, and again, and again. No matter how many battles they lost, how many friends they had to bury, and how many tears they cried, they always had each other. The Winchester family, the family Sam and Dean have built over the past twelve years, was thrown together by circumstance but stayed together because of love.
wavered, not even for a second. Until the very last minute, Cas had tried to find a way to save his son. He had always believed in them. And he had always been there for Jack, no matter what.
He walked for a little while, not sure how much time had passed because of how differently time felt away from Earth, away from his family. The angel stopped in his tracks when he heard branches snapping in the distance. Someone was running away. He turned around to see who was out there with him, but he could only see the silhouette of a creature in the distance. The person was dressed in all black, but that was all he could make out from the distance.
Dean looked at him, shell-shocked.
Cas had said on a quiet night while they were able to sneak away for a couple hours. And although Dean had given up hope on being able to save Jack, Cas’ faith had
Their reunion was interrupted by Hester’s voice, this time around strangely calm as she said: “You’re no longer our brother, Castiel. And by the looks of it, you haven’t for a long time,” she laughed before she continued, “… and yet, you’re… here. You wanted peace? Free will? Look where that got you. We may be doomed, but you’re no better than us. Enjoy, eter-”
Dean did not even hesitate for a second: “Do it, Jack. You know I’d do anything.”
He was still thinking of Dean, beautiful Dean Winchester, who he had given his life to save as he waited for eternal sleep to come. He thought of his smile and the way the wrinkles around his eyes crinkled when his face lit up, the one thing which always cheered him up, the cure to his disease. The sunshine to his darkest days, lighting the way even as his angel passed into the afterlife. But sleep didn’t come. Instead, blurry specks of blue and brown and green appeared in front of him, his vision not quite clear yet. The little specks danced around for a while, before his vision finally cleared. The angel had arrived in a vast forest. The colossal trees towered over the angel and shrouded the place in darkness. He got a glimpse of the sky and the stars through the free patches between the tree branches. Otherwise, the place felt gloomy and foreign. Nevertheless, the dark forest had a familiar ring to it. Castiel thought that maybe he had ended up in Purgatory, instead of the Empty. This would at least explain why he was in a forest and why he wasn’t asleep.
He paused, still looming over him and held the angel blade to his throat. Of course, Castiel could imagine what had caused all this, what that bang was. But he wasn’t going to tell some random demon about it. In fact, he needed to run and hide, if all angels and demons were, in fact, awake. He wasn’t exactly on good terms with most of heaven’s soldiers and much less those he himself had killed in combat. In fact, any second out here in the open was one too many. He didn’t know what would happen if one was killed in the Empty, but he wasn’t eager to find out, either.
Dean was different than Cas, though. The quick, distraught “I love you too,” Dean had uttered back at him was the reason the Empty was eventually summoned. Still, Cas had not been sure if it was meant romantically, not until Dean had finally spoken his truth. Once he had gripped Cas tight and raised him from perdition, once he had saved him, he was able to avow his love to Cas. He had bottled up his feelings for years, and it was strange to finally give in to the thought of truly and fully loving his angel and to recognize that he was loved equally. Admittedly, Cas was not Dean’s first crush, but he kept pushing his feelings down year, after year, after year because, in the end, they would only be friends, albeit best friends. Or so Dean thought.
He watched Jack, who at this point had closed his eyes and seemed to be doing… God’s work? Dean blinked – just for one second – and suddenly saw people walking the streets, laughing, talking as if Chuck had never snapped them away in the first place.
bring everyone back. But he believed in Jack, in their plan. After all, he had defeated God himself. So, nothing was out of reach for them, really.
“If your definition of peace means living through your worst nightmares over and over again, then I feel sorry for you,” Castiel replied in a composed manner.
Shortly after, Jack entered the room, exclaiming: “Guys, I’m feeling something… weird.”
Jack smiled and looked at Dean with the same naivety which had always been unique to him. And then he finally said it: “We’re going to bring Cas home now.”
Still holding onto those soft hands tightly, Dean explained: “I don’t know, man, it was strange. First of all, Jack just vanished. We didn’t go to get you back… We just went on with our lives. And I don’t know what happened to Eileen either. It was as if she never existed and mattered to us. Instead of going after you, we went to a pie festival. A pie festival, for fucks sake! Can you believe that? I lost you, and Sammy and I just went out as if nothing ever happened.”
“Dean!” he hears someone shout in the distance.
Hester threw her hands in the air out of sheer disbelief. “It is not about us, Castiel. You don’t understand. We need to draw the line somewhere, think about the bigger picture: God’s vision. Now tell us you did not cause this.”
He took a swig from his whiskey bottle.
This chapter basically fixes whatever that mess at the end of 15x19 was.
“Yeah… Chinese, maybe?”
“Finish the paragraph?” Dean continues for him, wrapping hands around his shoulders and kissing the top of his head.
“You kissed him back?” Fingers know Dean’s body so well. They move to his prostate.
“Oh, fuck…” Benny echoes. He puts his palm over his mouth, because it fell open and probably won't close by itself anytime soon.
“Did you like it?”
“I wanna… I want to fuck…”
Castiel shakes his head. It could turn into some kind of stupid joke, but he’s dead serious now, he does not have time for this.
Mild smiles sits on Cas’ face, when he sips his tea. But the hand, freshly rich with fifty bucks, stays. He continues looking.
“Sit down”
Light is blinding me. Heart grew so big, it filled all of my chest, not sure, if there’s a place left to breathe in.
Benny doesn’t need to be asked twice. He starts with slow, but deep, watching, nearly hypnotised, how his cock is almost out, and then hits again to enter with it's whole lenght.
I can't stop looking at him.
“I will never leave you again”
Dean does.
“You’re not allowed to, until I say. I want you to focus on Benny’s mouth now. Do you like what he does?”
“Yes, he did. Very much.”
That’s enough.
To come to terms.
He looks at Benny, tilting his head to the side, he makes sure Benny watches his fingers are sliding out slowly.
“Come here”
Cas snickers as he straightens up.
“Do you really wanna do it?”
“I think,” he says, and he stuffs three fingers into his mouth, to make them wet enough “I think…” he says, as he reaches to Dean’s hole “...he is much more relaxed now. I think…” he rubs all three agains it, then uses two to stretch his skin a little to the sides, and the middle one to slide in. “…yeah. You can fuck him with your tongue now. Try” and he takes the middle one out.
He squeezes a little more lube on his fingers and rises his eyebrows at Dean, whose legs are now hanging off the table. He immediately pulls them up, knees close to his chest.
Benny eases himself falling into nearest chair, removes the condom, ties it neatly and smacks it agains the floor.
“Mmhhhmm. If you’re patient enough for me to take a shower”
Castiel increases the pace, and it causes another gasp.
“Look at me”
He pulls back to look me in the eyes again, and this time I don’t look away. He looks tired, exhausted. And impossibly sad.
“But…” Dean needs a second to gasp. “But… ffuck… that’s all. And he’s not gay, of course, but he liked it…”
Castiel waits.
“Okay, smartass.”
Cas just pouts and puts the book on the table.
Benny doesn’t say anything, he just takes a step closer, holding his cock in his hand, and rubs a head agains Dean’s hole. He’s watching attentively, he wants to remember this - Dean Winchester takes him in. He presses.
You lay. You rest. You sleep.
Dean’s breath is slow and deep, he swallows, he rests his head on the pillow. He looks so beautiful like this, Castiel must admit, so peaceful. He adds second finger, his rhythm is same slow. Dean’s toes curl, responding to pressure, but ease quickly and Castiel kisses his forehead again.
“Yes.. I want to.”
“You are so beautiful like this. My sweet boy looks so beautiful…” Voice gets under Dean’s skin, praise makes his body tremble, makes him fall apart into million pieces. Castiel kisses him. It’s a tender of lips and slow caressing of the tongue. Gentle and sensual “…so beautiful.”
Dean checks his mail, he goes downstairs to take a look on the working process and assign the today tasks for the guys. He nods approvingly when they show him the progress. With his side vision, he sees Benny watching him. As usual. Maybe a little more attentively. He goes upstairs with the new customer to sign the required papers. Before lunch, he has the usual Monday briefing with Benny, they prepare general order for spare parts for this week. They double check everything, and Dean approves the purchase with a casual pat on Benny’s shoulder, as he does every time when they agree on something. Benny behaves ordinary. Only two of them in the room, but absolutely no awkwardness between them. Benny looks at Dean for a little longer, maybe, when he leaves the office, but that’s all.
They both laugh a little more, but it fades in silent awkwardness.
"Ouch! Yeah, he's cool"
Meanwhile, Benny isn’t sure, what he wants to do more - to slide his tongue inside Dean’s ass, or to suck on Castiel’s fingers.
Seriously, you didn’t want to wake me up?? So nice of you! Next time consider my near heart attack, maybe?
Your hair smell of my shampoo.
“I’m terribly sorry for this, Benny. He’s absolutely unbearable sometimes” Castiel apologises, he even means it.
There’s a firework of thoughts in Dean’s head, he wants so many things, he doesn’t even know where to start. He wants this to stop. He wants Cas to push his finger further, he wants Cas to go down on his knees and lick his hole alongside with his finger, he wants Benny to watch he does so. He wants…
He grabs Dean by the hair and pulls his head back. He grabs a handful of Dean’s ass. He kisses Dean’s neck with his open mouth, greedily, all tongue and teeth, and Dean loses his composure in the exact second. Jesus, he loves to be taken like this. Abruptly, roughly, demandingly, and Cas knows it, continuing his way on Dean’s neck, up to his mouth.
Okay. He smirks, holds his hand up and waves him.
“You don’t say”
Benny takes him by the chin and kisses his mouth.
His fingers play in Dean’s hair. “Breathe”
“You want me to go on?”
Okay, okay… What do people do in situation like this? Fuck’s sake, “situation like this”! What the fuck he’s supposed to do? Benny’s mind goes absolutely blank, and the only thing he comes up with is, probably, the most stupid thing he could come up with.
“He’s sure” Castiel nods.
His tears, his frantic heartbeat. His arm on my chest. And that something, something in the way he looks at me now. Now I know, I understand, it was there, in his eyes, before. Every time. Just a tiny spark, immediately covered up with sarcasm, or recklessness, or coarseness. It all gives me hope. And I should not hope.
It’s not a straight line, I think. It’s more like a quagmire, and I’m drowning.
He stands up from his chair.
This is definitely the limit of acceptable. It’s the line to cross. Dean's chest heaves, deep breaths is the only sound that is left in the kitchen. It’s up to him now. Everything is up to Dean.
I don’t like the price.
“No, on your side, back to the headboard”
Life goes on, right?
It takes him a few seconds to understand. He has said it for himself, not for Castiel, not for Dean. Not for anyone. He made the voice inside his head audible, and yeah… it’s easier to breathe now.
“Yeah, yeah.” Benny nods. “It’s okay, I’m sure”
He continues.
“What I’m trying to say is…”
“Huh?”
He puts his fingers into Dean’s hair.
“Hey, what’s up? Kev messed up with polishing again?” He throws over his shoulder, continuing packing.
Okay, stop. Just bring yourself together. Go to the kitchen, say something funny, like “thank you for the pleasant evening, gentlemen!”, and go home. You can do it. You can panic, when you’re home, where no one will see.
“Yeah, yeah I will”
“Hey, boss”
Kissing noises cease, and two pairs of eyes stare at him.
“Yeah… okay. Okay.” He takes another fifty. “And now? Happy?”
You told me, you want to grow old with me.
We’re driving back home from the grocery store. You’re texting to someone and smiling. Tell them “Hi” from me.
“Okay listen,” Benny finally starts. “I just…”
But I keep thinking “If only..” I keep asking “What if..?”  So many of those. Like there are other paths, and it all could’ve work out differently. They throw me back days ago, then months ago, then years. All my life, since the day I’ve met you. I keep searching for the answer, for the exact point, the moment, when I could’ve say something, do something. And you’d still be here.
“Yeah”
“Check what?” Dean adjusts the bag, his eyebrows are risen in polite attention, but he’s in a little hurry. He’s about to grab the door handle, but Benny is standing on the way.
Everything is so blurry, like it’s covered with haze. Where am I, again? What happened? Is... is this the bunker? My room?
Dean scoffs. “A bit!”
Dean.
It’s so quiet.
“We’re grown ups, right? We work together. I mean… I’m your employee and you’re my boss. And I guess, in a professional way, we get along very well. Right?”
Here we go.
The room is still. Only movement is your chest’s slow ups and downs, as you breathe. It’s just air, nothing more, right? How can the sound of air, filling the lungs, be the most soothing sound in the world?
“So, we’re gonna use your right hand, then”
“Okay” He says, like everything is fine.
He’s too busy with trying to look less red on his face.
“Yeah!” Cas rises his voice. “Kitchen”
“Oh… someone’s in a good mood?” Dean smiles. He rises Cas’ chin with his finger and kisses him softly.
Dean flushes. It’s so unexpected and fast, he’s very surprised with himself. He knew he’s going to tell about it, but… But the tone those words were said with. Goosebumps march.
“How are you feeling today? You look much better”
They look at each other. Yeah, all is good. Life goes on.
“I think we all should think of that” He smiles mildly, as he looks at their faces. Faces, not to be described with words.
“Very good. Get up.” Castiel sounds very pleased.
Dean shakes with his whole body, he nearly whimpers. The grab on his jeans turn his knuckles white.
“Then we need to talk”
“Dude! First “I’m not gay”, then he’s gonna tap my ass?” Dean laughs at that. “No way he’s gonna do both!”
Dean knows it's a “yes” or “no” question. He’s not supposed to ask or say anything back, like “Can I?” or “Yes, but..” Castiel wants to hear, if he wants it. So...
He pushes Dean one step back, and slides himself free from in between the table and Dean’s body. With his hand still in Deans pants, he gently pushes him closer to the table. Dean obeys, and rests his elbows and chest on the wooden surface. He closes his eyes and breathes in.
“Pull your legs up” Castiel instructs, when Dean’s ass is placed on the towel.
Dean opens his eyes. He doesn’t need to ask what Castiel means.
Dean shudders, his breath is deep.
Ask him. Come on, ask him. Once and for all. The words are very simple “Do you want me to stay?”, but they won’t come out.
"Oh, should we?" Cas raises his eyebrow, as he leans his hips against the table and pulls Dean closer. He curls his arms around Dean's waist, nose rubbing scruffy cheek.
“Yeah” Dean manages under the pressure of Castiel's tongue.
It causes Dean’s gasp, he lets off his knees and stretches his arms forward, grabbing a handful on each of his cheeks. His anticipation is palpable now, but Benny’s willing to torture Dean a little more.
He swears under his breath and grin grows wider and wider on his face, as he plans on how many adjustable wrenches he’s gonna drop and pick up from the floor today, how often he’s gonna suck on a pen between his lips, how many…
Cas looked peaceful in sleep. All of the tension from the night before was gone. Dean almost hated to wake him up. Reluctantly, Dean gently nudged Cas. That was all it took for the other man to blink awake slowly, looking adorably confused until he too recalled the events of last night. Dean hated the way his face immediately filled with tension again, missing the peace that had just been there. Dean gestured to the nurse and Cas nodded and stood. Then after a moment of thought he gestured for Dean to follow him. Dean was slightly surprised, but stood anyway and trailed after Cas and the nurse.
Dean was broken out of his thoughts when he felt a small body run directly into his side. The kid wasn’t there for long, but his collision with Dean had slowed him down enough for Castiel to catch up to him and scoop him up in his arms. Castiel sent a fierce glare at Dean over the kid’s head, as if to say
“Hey are you ok? You seem a little out of it.” Dean looked up at his brother.
“Is he going to be ok?” Cas asked. The nurse looked sympathetic.
“No, I’m gonna leave you jobless and possibly homeless.” The sentence was more than laced with sarcasm. “Of course you got the job boy.”
“Well you sounded like you needed help. Or rather, your coworker needed help. You do realize I’m still just a student right?”
, Dean figured,
“May I ask you something? You do not have to answer if you don’t want to.”
Dean woke up in his own bed. He was warm and comfortable, like he had been the previous morning. He looked over to see Cas sleeping beside him. But this time, he didn't try to escape. He didn’t think he could even if he wanted to. Cas’s arm was thrown over him and their legs were intertwined.
“Don’t worry about it. The man’s got enough on his plate, I’m surprised he hasn’t dropped dead yet. Just let him be. You can go now Dean, I’ll see you tomorrow morning.” Dean nodded.
Overtired individuals often tend to have a much quicker temper than usual, and Cas and Dean were no exception.
“Job interview. What are you doing here?”
Castiel was easy to work with. He never complained, indeed he hardly even spoke. He was good at what he did, however, the silence was getting to Dean.
“Hey Dean.” Dean almost dropped his food.
“Yeah yeah, don’t go spreadin it around. And don’t think I’ll go easy on ya just because you’re my favorite. How’s your brother by the way?”
“Your name. It’s kinda bible-y isn’t it? I mean, not that there’s anything wrong with that. But like, were your parents bible freaks too?” Dean stopped, realizing he was rambling. Castiel let out a quiet laugh.
The funeral was on a Sunday. It was awful. Not awful as in a bad ceremony, awful as in sad. It hurt Dean to see Cas so sad. Dean didn’t say a word throughout the whole thing. He didn’t feel like he completely belonged here. But Cas had asked him, and so he had to go. He was about to leave afterwards when Cas approached him.
“Your car is ready.” Dean almost jumped at Cas’s voice. Metatron looked confused.
“Yeah. Like you wouldn’t hurt me or Sammy,” Dean muttered, fully aware of how stupid it sounded. But Cas didn’t laugh. He just nodded thoughtfully.
When I originally write this chapter, I forgot there was an actual character named Kevin.  This child known as Kevin was not meant to be a representation of that Kevin.
“How about breakfast? I’ve barely eaten in days. I’ll make pancakes.” Dean nodded, feeling almost too cold when they detangled and stood up. It was worth it however. Cas made amazing pancakes.
Oh. Cas was asleep on his shoulder. That was why the nurse had thought they were a couple.
“Nah he doesn’t wanna talk to me. If he did he’d have called.” Bobby looked skeptical.
“Likewise,” Cas answered, shaking it. “Excuse me.” With that, he walked out the door.
“Pancakes can wait,” Dean decided. “Just stay with me for now.”
“We have stabilized him,” she said. “You can see him now.” Cas and Dean stood.
“That was a pretty good idea,” Dean said. Castiel looked at him.
He was back in the dream again. It all happened as it had the night before. Dean distracted John, but not for long enough. He was tossed aside, unable to move. But he could scream this time. He screamed and screamed as John hit Sammy. His Sammy. His brother. Sam’s screams were worse tonight. Somehow more painful. With a final kick, Sam fell next to Dean. He wasn’t breathing.
A doctor came out to speak to them several hours later. He said they had done everything that they could. He said it was all up to Kevin now. He said Kevin was a fighter. He said Kevn could pull through. He said he was sure of it.
Tw for nightmares of past child abuse, but not quite as graphic as the last chapter
This is SUPER short I know and I’m sorry.  There was originally more to this but it wasn’t working super well.  Also school started again, so there’s that.
“So um.” They both stopped short.
His phone. His phone was ringing at what was no doubt an ungodly hour of the night.
“Us. What are we? What are we going to do? How far is this going to go?” Cas smiled.
He reached Cas’s house far faster then he probably should have. Cas was waiting out front, and climbed into the backseat without Dean saying a word.
When he got to the hospital, he found Cas pacing the waiting room again. He looked up as Dean arrived. He looked bad, worse than when this whole thing had started.
(See the end of the chapter for
The hunter was sitting on the ground, back against the wall. He was down in the armory where Cas had spoken his truth. And Dean hadn’t said it back. Why hadn’t he said it back?
He stops for a moment, still upset by the horrible events he experienced through his sleep. Dean obviously knows that he is safe now and that everything took a turn for the better. Regardless, there is something he cannot quite shake off. He takes a deep breath as if to gather the courage to continue: “I know, Cas… I always said I’d go down swinging, on the hunt, or fighting whatever overpowered bastard we are going up against. But I think I know now… since you’ve opened my eyes… that there’s – that I can choose my own destiny. That I don’t have to die impaled by a goddamn rusty nail sticking out from the wall. Cas, I want to grow old with you, and live a normal, boring life. It’s what we deserve after all of the crap Chuck and all those cosmic bastards have put us through.”
