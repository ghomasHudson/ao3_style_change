"What would you do if I said I can make it, him, them, disappear?" Sherlock asked, reading her ex-husband's drug trafficking in her hip and wrists. She gasped, but she couldn't get out another word since Sherlock'd made his way past her into the block of flats. He pulled out his phone to look something up. He'd then, called someone.
"He didn't like the fact that we're friends, John," William retorted loudly, "He never knew anyone who took interest in me, so whenever someone did, he'd tell me to shake them off, or," The teen trailed off, not willing himself to look into John's eyes.
"I've got to say, that scar across the palm of your left hand has me curious." The boy said, leaning forward to look more in-depth at the said scar. John's father cut him on the hand with the pocket knife John had snuck out of the house with to look cool in front of his mates as a preteen. John instinctively pulled his hand towards his chest, giving the teen a strange look, his furrowed brows growing deeper in suspicion.
"I'm John Watson," John said, looking down at himself to see how he looked. John flopped himself back onto the seat, "I'm a first-year," John pulled his leg up with a grunt and pulled his wand from his sock. He smiled at Sherlock, who smiled back at him.
Five minutes after, William seemed to not care as much about partnering for the project as he made another insolent comment about how astronomy wasn't important. The Professor has had enough of him.
That was the only way to describe it. They had separate places to live, but since Bear wasn't allowed in John's apartment, he'd been spending absurd amounts of time in the library if only to coddle his companions, or one of them, at least.
William carefully placed the cigarette in between John's lips and noted how soft they were when his thumb brushed against it, it seemed to John. William shielded the lighter with one hand as he lit it with the other, John leaned forward slightly to get the little fire to ignite on the end of his cigarette. John leaned back and inhaled, expecting the hit of a cigarette's smoke to invade his lungs, but it was different than what he smelled at home. William put his hands in his pockets and kept inhaling through his mouth and exhaling through his nose when John coughed up a cloud of smoke.
"Then, I'm going, too," said John climbing to the same step Sherlock waited on. They stood side-by-side, John holding onto the railing, only occasionally glancing over at Sherlock.
"Hmm?" William finally looked over at John and rolled his eyes. "It's a nicotine-free cigarette,"  He answered. John shook his head.
"John, let's go wash you up, huh?" She asked, voice soft like she was helping him through PTSD or something. Here's the thing: John did have PTSD, John was crying, looking at the blood on his hands and remembering what his father did to him and his mother every night and every day. His eyes flickered to William's face, which was all bloodied up, enough for someone to not notice that his nose had been broken within the first punch John swung.
"I'm sorry," quickly lifting his arms to protect his head, accidentally getting some blood in his hair.
John walked back to his dorm and was a bit surprised to see his roommate anxiously tinkering with something on his desk. He quickly looked up, his somewhat greasy, unfortunately, straightened locks of hair jumping with him as he'd finally acknowledged John's sudden presence.
"Then, you probably know that it's really a kid doing all of this subconsciously?" He asked, cocking a brown to the boy who sat on the bed. The boy smirked and nodded, making John smirk, too. "Then, I suppose you'd already know that we don't have much time to try and save this child?"
"What do you deduce, John!?" William asked loudly as he quickly stood up and threw the papers at John. Once John saw them, his head snapped up.
John's hair was matted to his forehead and over his eyes as he desperately paddled himself to the shore. As soon as John could reach the sandy bottom of the lake, he was running to the dried beach. John laid Sherlock flat on his back and checked his breathing and heart rate,
The next battle was even more gruesome. More and more men died, more and more Medics refused to work out of fear, but John was there to be a medic. He couldn't let a couple ricocheting bullets near him get in the way. This was his job; this is what he's wanted to do since he was a boy.
"I beg of you," John said, spitting in Jim's direction. John felt a small tugging on the side of his shirt. He looked over to see Sherlock's eyes, half-lidded. He looked exhausted as his hand dropped again. Sherlock looked beyond John, towards the door. John turned back, expecting Jim to stand next to Dumbledore. Instead, there stood Mary, who looked at John's newly bruised fist. "Mary,"
"William," John called, "William, are you okay?" John must've been worried as he'd forced the door open to see William leaning over the sink with his right hand covering his right arm. "William!" John called as he rushed to William's side in an attempt at giving aid to his friend.
"What's wrong?" Victor asked, turning to look at the Ravenclaw boy, who looked down bashfully. Victor stepped closer.
"Hey, I'm sorry to keep you waiting; how long were you here?" John asked, grabbing a chair to sit on as he put his books on the table.
"Okay, so," John said, as he sat down, slamming his tray to the table, making William jump a bit. "Sorry. I was just saying, once we make sure no one else has found an accurate claim as to why the painting's a fake, we should definitely prove it!" Sherlock opened his eyes to show an expression that didn't look amused.
John watched in wonderment. His eyes went wide and his jaw went slack. Jacob laughed and John looked over at him. Jacob was a fairly attractive boy, taller considerably that John was with sharp green eyes and a face that even 'mommy dearest' could love. John's heart raced and his lips quirked up into an involuntary grin. He ducked his head down.
"One, I'm not a 'tinker-kid,'" He said, lifting his goggles and twisting his body s that he could wrap an arm around his chair, "And, two, from now on, take your shoes off at the door, please." He said with an annoyed smile.
"Maybe you should just give it some time, you know? Settle in -- see how things are," Mycroft suggested shyly. John had never seen Mycroft shy into a suggestion, but this Sherlock must be a different matter. Sherlock slammed his fists to the table, causing a startling crash.
"His name's Sherlock Holmes," John said, looking down as if ashamed that he'd done what Sherlock asked him specifically not to do. Jacob's eyes widened.
"My Nokia 9000 Communicator," William said, holding the mobile up, then opening it up for John to see,
"Um, Sherlock," John said, stalling once more, Sherlock groaned ("What is it, now?") and quickly walked to where his friend sat, staring at a particular file, the last file.
School was boring and John just wanted to go back to Hogwarts. Somehow the news of John being 'gifted,' had quickly made its way to the bullies of the school. John couldn't even use the restroom without being harassed. His home life was growing increasingly worse and still no word from Sherlock...!
"Mike Stamford," The man said, shaking John's hand. John looked him up and down, glad that post-war life hadn't done that to him yet.
Once the sun was set, and their blunts were inhaled to mere roaches, William decided he wanted to go inside. He threw his rolled-up blunt and stood up to go. John stood and felt an immediate head rush.
John was confused, to say the least, and maybe a little bit insulted, but John wasn't quite sure yet as he shook himself of the questionable feeling and opened up the letter from his mum. It was sent on printed paper. John excitedly smelled it and luckily, the envelope preserved the freshly-printed smell the paper provided. John sighed contently as he unfolded the letter from its brochure-like template.
"Why else would Sebastian say that it was your fault," Sherlock gripped the front of Sebastian's shit and hed him close to his face as he snarled with a low and dangerous voice,
"Don't let Greg know; he may think you were up to something," Sherlock scoffed, opening the door. John sucked it up for the time being and helped Sherlock drag the man into the house and quickly to the bathroom. Finally, Mycroft let it out. John patted the man's back as he retched into the toilet.
"You know what John's inner-eye-colour is, then?" She asked with a smirk. Sherlock faltered for a moment, feeling... embarrassed? He quickly snatched the paper back from the girl, who chuckled in response. Sherlock's face grew hot. He felt the need to make up some lame excuse.
"Allen, Castier, DeCadio, Holmes, Miller, Watson, and Zimmer," They heard from the other room. They both looked up simultaneously, "Drug tests; let's get it going, yeah?" The instructor reminded in a rushing tone. They both stood and walked to the bathrooms, along with a few others. 'Watson?' Sherlock repeated as he checked behind himself, 'Is John in here,' Sherlock immediately shook the somehow hopeful question from his mind. 'Why would he be here?'
At Dinner, Sherlock got a letter from Professor Dumbledore. He read it and sighed, looking at the Slytherin table. Victor looked concerned. "If the evidence is sufficiently supplied, we'll have to be taken it to Wizengamot and I'll have to testify as a victim of hazing," Sherlock said with a grunt, briefly looking at the Advisory table. "Everybody involved that night will be subpoenaed," He looked back at Victor, tensed.
"That boy," He chuckled as he let a hand comb through the front of his curls. "How'll he survive without me?" He asked himself, meaning for it to be a rhetorical question, however, he ended up pondering about it for a while.
Madam Hooch had them maintain their brooms and John was caught trying to steal glances to Mary, her eyes landing on his for a brief moment, then quickly looking away. They got their brooms all lined up and they stood to the left to practise summoning them. John would've thought that everyone would've gotten it by now, but there was a number of kids who still go whacked in the face by their brooms, which John thought was incredibly funny.
"Will," John said, causing the tall boy's head to snap up, revealing an expression of almost grief, "Hey, what's wrong?" John asked, hurrying to William's side, sitting next to him on the bed.
"I tried," He said as he continued, earning a sharp intake of air through John's mouth. As John quickly relaxed, he mused,
"Oh, this is rich! What'll it be, then?" The boy shouted back, throwing his hands up only to slap them back to his sides.
"They send one of these damn things every bloody morning...!" He shouted, aggravated that the time he took to go out and get the post, which wasn't even a minute, had been doubled, having to go back out at a different time each day to take this one from the lawn and shoo away the owl who delivers it.
"Awe, you're trying to protect me; that's sweet." John laughed as William huffed out an angry breath and stole a few chips from John's tray as revenge.
"Huh, I didn't know that," Sherlock muttered, but before he could explain his findings to John, a marble hit the back of his head. "Ah, ow!" Sherlock groaned as he swung his hand up to rub at the pained spot.
The ride on the boat was fun. It was supposed to be tranquil and calming, but Hagrid gave him a few playful splashes of water, which lightened it up for John.
"Look, I-" William paused to find the right words, then he began to chuckle, "I've never admitted defeat before, but I can never win when I'm around you, Watson." William didn't mean it to sound like John was victimising him, however, that John was so stubborn that William had no choice but to give in. John patted the seat of the bleacher next to him and said,
John was pulling out to remove the condom from himself when the door opened and there was a scream. An administrator ran up to the opened door to see John frozen out of fear over top of Irene, who had a shit-eating grin on her face. After they were both presentable, the administrator had them go down to the dean's office. The administrator followed closely behind as to monitor their behaviour. The information spread like a wildfire.
"Well, it's not my fault your plan went downhill so fast," William said, buttoning his shirt up, "Look, we got an A on it, he seemed impressed, what more could you want?" He asked as he was fumbling with his tie. John bounded over to help him, much against William's struggles.
William had ignored and avoided John for two and a half weeks. The boy felt worse and worse every day, reverting back to snapping at anyone who tried to talk to him. One day he'd been sent to the counsellor's office.
"Oh, I'm feeling quite well, but you're new here, and everyone wants to get to know you. You won't be doing much of that while you're here, I'm afraid. Plus, I need to study anyway."  He replied insistently with a smile that seemed so ingenuine that it could've broken John's heart if they weren't in public.
"Hey!" The boys silenced as a familiar voice shouted. Suddenly, a trash bin flew at one of the boys, the main one. The boys scuffled away and the boy who'd saved Sherlock was breathing heavily.
"I remember being able to walk after I left the library yesterday," Sherlock said, gritting his teeth, "One of those stupid students must've shoved me down the bloody  staircase!" Sherlock growled. John stopped, parked the chair, and walked out in front of the chair with his hands on his hips. Sherlock can't remember ever thinking this was cute before, but he sure as hell does, now!
What gave you the right to assume my weakest link needed help from you, muggle-born!? I don't care if you'd saved his life, it's still unacceptable...! However, I suppose it would be nice to have someone watch over our little Shezza when he's at school, so you're not entirely useless. Anyway, William refuses to allow the boy back for holiday, and I can only assume that your family is too poor to accommodate you for the winter, so I expect you to keep him safe, somewhat entertained, and out of trouble, which seems to be Scott, nowadays.
"We're allowed to bring friends," he said. John pushed Sherlock inside and parked him near the fire. Sherlock let himself fall asleep. He didn't even feel when John and a few other first-years carried him up to the dorms and plopped him into John's bed.
"What about your family?" John asked, "Did they know; were you brave enough to tell them?"  William stopped brushing through John's hair for a few seconds.
"Don't tell anyone I did this, but it's too good to resist," he said with a smile on his lips. John nodded. Jacob slipped his wand from his robe and wanted it into the air, saying some kind of incantation. Then, after a flash of light, there was a Bay stallion striding from the stars above. He only appeared for a moment, then dissipated into the sky again as if it had just been dust in the wind.
"It's going to be okay," He said, nodding. Sherlock nodded, too, tears still dampening his cheeks. John dried them up with his thumb, then smiled lightly. "Let's go save London," he said, his chest tightening slightly as he heard Sherlock's chuckle. He was okay, John thought, he'll be okay,
"It's never yours either," John said, causing William to drop his gaze from the cumulonimbus clouds in the sky signifying rain to look at John as if nothing else was there but him.
Once again, Irene had pulled John away from Irene. They decided to hang out at Irene's dorm. Her roommate was out with a class, so they had an hour of awkwardly sitting around and doing nothing to do. That was until Irene mentioned how much her back hurt.
Whispering, "Revelio," as he made one decisive wave. John repeated. A glow shone from John's wand and transformed the top book, revealing what it really was, which was a small bag. It was Sherlock's money bag. He grabbed it back from the desk and shoved it in his pockets.
"Probably to curse you for saving their useless son," Sherlock laughed. Once the ice broke in the group, Sherlock looked at John and remembered, "Hey, uh, I never really got to say..." He began but saw Dumbledore in the background slowly shaking his head. Sherlock trailed off as the old professor cleared his throat. That was strange,
"Hey," John said, chuckling, as he approached the two boys. Sherlock smiled. He leaned forward to give the boy a fist-bump, which was greatly appreciated by John's facial expression. John looked up at Victor. "I'm John,"
"What are you doing?" Jacob asked as John laid his jacket to the ground, smoothing it out flatly to the dirt.
Sherlock entered the Ravenclaw common room feeling confused. Why was Victor acting all strange and huggy at Sherlock? I mean, yeah. He's a Hufflepuff and that's what they're supposed to do, right? But, Victor hasn't really been like that at the beginning of their friendship, so... Was he just now considering Sherlock as a friend? Well, Sherlock wouldn't mind that, but learning that having a Hufflepuff friend meant that he was going to get hugged, maybe he wasn't meant to be a Slytherin after all...? But, Sherlock liked Victor and he didn't want that to be the determining factor of friendship. Surely, that wouldn't be okay for either of them.
"Sherlock could've died today, and you want to fight me? How friendly of you, Jim?" John scoffed, catching Jim off guard with a punch to the left side of his face. Jim grunted, dropping his wand. John punched him again and again. He took the front of Jim's robe and stomped on his wand, snapping it. John yanked Jim in to growl, "Get anywhere near Sherlock ever again, inside of Hogwarts or out, and this will be your bloody body, Jim," John pushed Jim backwards, letting him fall to his arse. John let out a growl of danger as Jim reached for his wand shakily, looking up to John with a terrified look in his eyes. "Off you pop, then," John shooed, fluttering his hand angrily.
"Don't lie to me, William." She said, sneering at him, "I always knew you were different than the rest of them," she said. Sherlock's eyes widened and his head began shaking slowly as if brokenly saying, no,
John nodded, "Pomfrey doesn't want your entire recovery to depend on magic, and neither do I," Sherlock put his hands through the holes, which were open on the backs, and pushed himself up. He could feel his legs, they were just too weak to support his weight and move, for now. John helped Sherlock clamber down the stairs, only losing his balance once. Thankfully, John was in front of him, there to catch him if he had fallen, which he had. Sherlock chuckled nervously.
"We're bringing him into the Hospital wing, Madam," He said, waving his hand to tell John to pull, "You can follow and help us... W-what was it again, John,"
"How does it feel? You'll be a free man when we wake up tomorrow," John said, smiling at his friend.
"Where were we going to put him again...?" Sherlock heard from one of the other boys, a fat one with buzzed hair and a dumb laugh...! "Ah, I remember, now; C'mon, Jim, to the lake we go...!" The boys laughed as Jim hissed at them to shut up. Sherlock's eyes widened and his face paled up considerably.
Before John's body could register, he was saying Sherlock's name. Then, it must've clicked in his mind because he scrambled to his feet and shouted "Up!" to a random broom near him. John swung his leg over the stick as he ran. He could hear Madam Hooch behind him threaten to give him detention, but John couldn't be arsed to care. His body knew something was wrong and he was going to help! John's broom still jerked itself as it sped, nearly flinging John off multiple times and he had no idea where he was going, but he let his body do the steering and let go with his mind. Eventually, John's broom smoothed its ride out and just flew.
"I think you'll be in..." Sherlock drew out, furrowing his eyebrows as if still unsure, "Gryffindor or Hufflepuff," he sat back with a smirk on his lips. John smiled as he leaned back, too. "My Galleons are on Hufflepuff, though," he assured, folding his arms.
Sherlock used his crutches to hobble into the bathroom. He bathed himself in private as he'd done all this time out of embarrassment for his physical state. Fully dressed, Sherlock began taming his hair and washing his face, when the other boys began filtering into the bathroom to take their own showers.
"Speaking of, how is he?" John asked, smiling slightly with unrealistic anticipation of him being awake and sitting up, but as John pushed open the curtain, he saw that the boy was asleep. John tightened his lips. He supposed seizures did take a lot of energy out of a person. He'd need all the rest he could get. John sat down next to him and looked at his pale face. He was still sweating, meaning he probably still had a fever. John placed his hand on Sherlock's arm and watched the boy breathe. His eyebrows furrowed and his lips were slightly parted. John couldn't imagine the amount of pain he must've been in,
At that accusation, Mary's face flushed and panic flashed over her face, "how'd you know that I was planning to walk down with John?"
"John, we're flatmates, best friends, and everything in between; what makes you think I don't know your NI number?" Sherlock gave a wry laugh, kind of like a scoff. There was the sound of a case shutting and being set to the wood floors, then rolling, slowing to a stop in front of the bathroom door, cracking it open an inch or two. "You should be careful where you put your pants, Dr Watson; wouldn't want you leaving the country without them,"
Days slowly and agonisingly slipped into weeks and John was going absolutely mad in London... No, just with muggles! It was awful!
"N-no, I'm not a hero; please don't say that," John said. Hagrid's door opened harshly and John tossed three more slugs from the jacket. John had Hagrid lay out the blanket and he transferred Sherlock to that.
William was hooked. He used to cover the pain of John leaving him. John only knew of the hash, although he still considered that as a drug. After the holiday, it took John a few months to start smoking again, although he wouldn't leave when William smoked, he actually seemed to enjoy the second-hand smoke in his lungs.
"Well," John started, feeling as if Jacob could prove the event to be true or false, "he said that the older kids of Hogwarts go out into the Forbidden Forest at half-past midnight and cast their patronuses into the sky as a kind of morale boost," John explained, "and he said that people from all houses usually go, but I didn't see anyone from Gryffindor leave yet. I'm starting to worry," John said, glancing into the fire with a worried expression as if to say that Sherlock might get burned one way or another tonight.
"I don't know anyone named Sherlock," John said, pushing back in his chair as if waiting for another reason for him to just bolt. The worse part is, Sherlock wouldn't have blamed him, "Sherlock is a pretty unique name; I would've definitely recalled," John said,
"It's all your damn fault," She began with a scream, however, ended the shout with a sob as she turned her face to the floor, holding onto John's defending arms as if he was the only thing she had. John didn't want to anger his sister with any more of his speaking. Harry's legs soon gave out and John followed her down to ensure her a safe landing.
"So, what's it like in there??" Sherlock asked, desperate to hear what the common room looked like compared to the stories that Mycroft had told him when he was younger. Mycroft... "Do you really think he hates me?" Sherlock asked, adjusting his books in his arms slightly to get a better hold.
"I, uh, I got in trouble, and I'm on campus arrest for two weeks, as well as having detention for the rest of this week," John said, basically sinking into his shirt.
"He's got a crush,"  They said simultaneously, however, their mum heard the older boy clearer than the younger one, who was muffled by the covers.
"You get back for Raider's, I know, John. So, is that a yes, then?" William asked, baring a nervous face.
"Say, Nox," Jacob instructed. John repeated and the light from his wand tip was snuffed out. They walked the rest of the way in darkness and quiet.
As they walked up to the circulation desk, Sherlock carefully slid his father's copy ID across to the man behind the desk, who looked up with a cocked brow. "What'll it be today, Mr Holmes?"
"Hey, did you see the news?" He asked, sounding nervously excited. John shook his head as he hadn't gotten the chance to check the telly yet today. Nonetheless, Mike showed John his mobile and they watched some breaking news segment where some houses in central London had been destroyed by a violent dark entity. John's face paled. He didn't know exactly what it was, but he knew it wasn't something that the muggle public should see...! John had no magical recourses, so he couldn't exactly look up what this date force really was, but he had a feeling that it wasn't a good thing.
John followed Sherlock to the Library. "Stay to the side, don't intervene unless things go sideways," Sherlock muttered as he opened the door.
"Yes, William It's me. Let's sit you down." John gently led William to his bed through the mess. As William lied down, he looked at his friend and his eyes softened at the boy. "Wow, this is way deeper than just an abrasion," John winced as he lifted Willam's hand to look at the injury. "Hold it, put pressure," John said, then looked around for a cloth. John quickly opened the drawers until he reached in to pull out his 'reassurance' shirt from William's dresser.
"Sherlock," he breathed, then quickly walked across the room to collapse at Sherlock's bedside, basically sobbing into his lap. Sherlock felt panicked, for more than one reason, though he decided to settle for awkwardly patting John's shoulder blades. "Thank God you're okay!" John sobbed.
Pushing it back into the proper place, John softly wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders and hugged him close. John lightly moved their bodies in a swaying motion as Sherlock cried in his shoulder, gripping the back of John's shirt. It took a few minutes, but John pulled away, placing his hands on either side of Sherlock's face.
"Yeah?" Jacob asked, sitting on the arm of the chair. "What kind of event?" John seemed unsure of telling Jacob about it.
"Excuses are the nails, Mr Watson," he said as a warning. Sherlock silently scoffed from his seat. He felt something in his chest that was almost akin to pride. He knew that saying,
"I'd like to say that I know you," John said, taking William back with his sad, yet hopeful tone of voice almost like he was asking permission to get to know William, "but I'm not going to push you, or pry into your life or past for you to open up. You have to do that for your own,"
"You need to stop this childish feud if you want to keep your spot on the team, Jossy...!" Greg scolded, making Jossy look down at her feet, suddenly falling quiet. John's eyes widened as Greg walked away to deal with the kids daring one another to snort a crushed chocolate chip cookie.
"I have a place," Sherlock said as if reading John's thoughts. "Y-you could join me for the night if you'd like," John looked unsure.
"I wanted to talk to you about something," John said. Jacob looked up with wonder, "later, though," John suggested. Jacob nodded and John sat down in the red armchair again. He began playing his Uke again.
"No, I-that's not," Joh struggled, "That's not what I meant; This isn't what I wanted!" He shouted over dramatically.
As he was looking for the address, however, Sherlock accidentally bumped shoulders with a group of boys his age. Sherlock turned quickly and apologised.
"Honey, John's here!" She shouted with a smile. Harry walked up behind the brunette and kissed her cheek whilst looking out the door.
"Yes!?" Sherlock looked plenty anxious, distraught as if he had no idea what this kind of contact even was, which was true.
"Friend from Hogwarts; we're popping out," John said, climbing the stairs, "don't wait up," Sherlock awkwardly waved to her as he slowly ascended the stairs himself. "Don't tell dad we're here," John called.
"Doctor Jacobson's office?" Sherlock mused, letting his eyebrows arch on curiosity. "Thank you," he said, straightening himself up, "come, love," Sherlock gave a small smile to John, who joined him, arm-in-arm for the support as they walked down the hall. Sherlock leaned in to whisper in John's ear, "turn back and wink at him," he said, "that's what Mum does,"
"Brewed the Polyjuice potion last night," Sherlock said, patting his satchel, which sat on his hip. John furrowed his eyebrows in confusion.
John opened his dorm-room door with heavy discretion. He thought of it as a covert ops mission: 'Meet contact, get to know him, live under-cover as a normal student,' It's how he made the more boring activities and opportunities in life more worthwhile in his opinion. John looked at the room to see half of it was already decorated. Books already on the shelves, famous rugby and football players' posters on the wall, making John feel a bit insecure about the amount he brought, or the lack thereof.
"Wouldn't dream of it," Greg reassured with a tightening to his lips as if trying to fake his best smile.
"Two points from both houses; don't let it happen again. Holmes, you should learn to focus better if you're going to make it in Ravenclaw," Snape said and slowly continued with the flow of his lesson. Sherlock gritted his teeth and continued to take notes.
"Altered pupillary behaviour is commonly present during and following epileptic seizures, Jacob," John hushed.he moved quickly to the other side of the boy.
"Is it exclusively Slytherin?" Sherlock asked, feeling a bit nervous at the thought of being in the middle of a group of Slytherin when he himself was a Ravenclaw, like it or not,
Sherlock skipped lunch to go to flying class with Mary, who also seemed to miss John. He'd have to catch up to his class if he didn't want to take it again next year instead of some elective.
William was more active in the school again. He went to lectures more regularly and he even tried to eat sometimes. He was back to normal before John Watson entered his life. Of course, William still thought of the blonde boy often, he'd frequently try to block the memories from his head. One fall midday, William was walking from class to class, fag in hand, headset bocking his hearing out with Paul Inka's 'put your head on my shoulder,' humming along to it, moving his fingers to what position they'd need to be to play it on the violin. Unfortunately, William didn't hear all of the kids running through the halls in a panicked frenzy, screaming, but as soon as the second shot fired, William was bumped in the shoulder by a passerby, fleeing from the scene, knocking his headset from his left ear. The screams startled William. They were so loud. William turned around and was frozen in fear. His face was of pure hatred.
"Why is it such a big deal, though? I mean, she's going to be okay," Sherlock said, furrowing his brows. "I mean, you act like she's been hurt or something," he murmured, looking down. Guilt could've done it, but John sighed, glancing to the ground.
"How'd you even know my NI number?" John asked, wrapping his towel around the back of his neck as he picked up his outfit from the basin. "Where's my pants!?"
"I don't know, I guess I'd like to be an actor...!" He shrugged with a chuckle, rubbing the back of his neck with a lack of confidence.
"Here," John said. Sherlock awkwardly tightened his lips and nodded as thanks, doing his best not to lose it in front of John like his body was screaming at him to do. John sensed the man was uncomfortable, so he backed up. He checked his phone, which was on the table, then sucked his teeth.
As John read, his smile dropped quickly. They were taking him from Hogwarts?! It wasn't even Christmas yet. John felt his body often with anxiety and he really hoped it wasn't actually going to happen. Just because his mum was worried, doesn't mean she should subject him to even more worrisome conditions at home...! What about his classes, his grades? What Did she know that they were going to be indicted to Wizengamot in the spring? Did she even consult Dumbledore on this matter, and if so, he allowed it?! What about Sherlock!?
"Amasing, what the brain can put together under gravity's pressures," John nodded, making Jossy chuckle with him She looked down, then back up at John.
"So, you want me to keep an extra close eye on our Londoner while you two work behind the curtains, is that it?" She asked lowly, her eyes scouring the floor of the police precinct she worked in.
"There's more than one?" John looked back to see the other one, which was blocked by a shelf of books from where he was sitting. John quickly turned back and brushed a hand through his hair. "Uh, I don't know if you're allowed to, or whatever, but uh, could you tell me how to work it?" John asked, feeling like an idiot as she chuckled.
John didn't know any better, so he agreed. I mean, the proof was in the name, wasn't it? " What about you? Do you have any idea where you'll be sorted, or are you just as clueless as the rest of those insipid children out there?" Sherlock asked.
"John, although I am not completely perfect with my memories; unlike me, you and many others, are worse off. I can move things out of my mind which don't help me. I think of it like boxes in an attic. I can move things out to make room for newer, more important information," William said, then furrowed his eyebrows as he tilted his head at John, "Why are you so obsessed with not failing? The worst they can do is send a letter in the post." John hesitated a moment as he averted his eye contact to the book yet he wasn't paying any attention to it before he muttered,
"C-coming, dad!" John called without looking at him. He looked at Sherlock who was now an inch or so taller than John when he was hunched over like this. His eyes were apologetic and sad, "Nice to see you again, Sherl," he nearly whispered before turning. Of course, John didn't get very far as Sherlock grabbed the boy's arm at the elbow to stop him,
"And my cologne," William sighed as he went through his hair with his hand. "If you're going to be this high-maintenance, you'd might as well keep your own things in here," William said, smiling. His tone put it out as a sarcastic sentence, however, he'd genuinely wished that John would consider coming to hang out more often.
Sherlock wasn't going to. He wasn't going to go to dinner, but something in him decided he would. He got out of bed and made his way down to the Great Hall where most students already were. Sherlock sat down at his table and picked at his food.
"Do you think it's true?" John asked nervously. William looked over at him, locked their eyes and dais,
He put his face in his hands, then looked down. "Oh, God," He muttered, finally noticing what he'd bloody done to his pants out of sudden desperation. "Oooh, my God," John groaned as he hopped off of the counter. He looked back and groaned as he saw a small puddle of cum on the countertop. Sherlock's cum, most likely. John felt like he had the sickening urge to both lick it up to taste it and throw up in the bathroom. It was free now, after all. He reached down to feel that Sherlock's cum was still leaking from him. Then, there was a spark of pure awareness.
"Mr Holmes, I'm glad to see that you've not held a grudge," he joked in his monotone voice. Sherlock gave an obviously sarcastic smile and found a seat to plop into heftily. He sighed. Had my own mother just disowned me...? He thought as the bell chimed loudly again, signifying the beginning of the class. The door burst open and the classroom looked at the door the best they could to find John standing there, breathing heavily with dishevelled hair and darkened smoke marks on his face, robe, and hands.
"Calm down, Captain; I'll put it back." The voice was elegant, unlike the first impression John had gotten from the actions of the teen.
She gave them the talk and led them into the Great Hall, where all of the older kids sat with their black outfits. The other professors and other staff of the school were up front. They stood in the front, looking at a wooden stool and an old hat made of a thick, brown material.
The boys were in a row again. John didn't like the fact that William decided to finish the project without him having a say in it at all.
"I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt," John said, his smirk just audible for Harold to hear. "I've got eyes; who should I Bluejack first?" He asked as he saw the three of them walking from the air terminal.
"Well, what changed?" She asked She was taken aback as she saw a smile creep up on the boy's usually cold, methodical face. William tilted his head down to hide the smile without getting rid of it. He never wanted rid of this gravity-defying feeling in his gut.
"N-Noo! John screamed, sitting up quickly. He was in a cold sweat and some of the other first-years that were going through their morning routines looked at him, startled and very confused. John quickly swung his legs out of a bed he'd not yet gotten used to and ran down the stairs to the common room. He was headed for the door when another perfect pulled the running boy back in a circle.
"I can't believe that I turned into him over that. I should have just listened to you," John said, chuckling bitterly to himself. William stayed quiet after that and they shared a moment of comfortable silence.
Dinner went nice. It was fun and Mycroft got completely shit-faced, so it wasn't a total loss of time. All in all, it was actually a pretty good night. As they were heading back to Mycroft's place to put him to bed, Sherlock drove, and they were talking about his addiction.
Sherlock woke up the next morning, ready to start the day off on the right foot. He'd go to breakfast, see if John had realised how stupid his question was, hang out with him, do some more questioning, and gather all the information they needed. However, things didn't really go as planned. Sherlock headed down to breakfast and was giddy with excitement as he thought of going to class with John, but John must've slept in because he wasn't in the Great Hall when Sherlock arrived fresh from his morning physical therapy session. Madam Pomfrey had declared Sherlock's legs were strong enough for only one crutch to be used, which was definite progress. Sherlock couldn't wait to tell John, who'd surely be proud of him for working so hard toward rehabilitation.
They shook hands and the bet was set. They casually talked and John got bored on the ride there so he lied on the seat with his feet up on the wall, strumming a mindless tune on his Uke as he hummed his boredom, "yeah, yeah, yeah...!" John muttered and adjusted his fingers on the strings as he played.
"How did you know I'm a Muggle-born?" John asked, tilting his head as their hands released from one another. John moved back into his seat more to get a bit more comfortable. Sherlock scoffed again, folding his arms once more, crossing his leg with a quick swing of it,
Sherlock frustratedly entered his flat. "How dare he!?" Sherlock grumbled as he threw his mobile to the ground and made his way to the crowded couch area and cleared it off with an angry swipe of his hand. "He can't just talk about me like that!" He shouted as he pulled a butterfly knife out of his pocket and began to fidget with it. Sherlock pulled his sleeve up and looked at his scar from all of those years ago and his heart began to throb. "He knew...?" Sherlock asked. "He knew, and he didn't do anything!" Sherlock shouted as he stabbed at the wall above the couch with the knife.
"Wait, no-!" John said, grabbing it back from him in a courageous act. John looked at the front page. It was him performing CPR on Sherlock on the beach, but how?! John's eyes narrowed as he continued to read the paper and his dad was growing more and more impatient by the active second. As if the thought of John even touching that newspaper was a sign of betrayal, John's dad had given his face a slap. John was caught off guard by the act of aggression, but unfortunately for him, he'd reacted with a punch himself, which started a physical fight. Punches and slaps were thrown and finally, John's dad pushed him by his neck to the wall next to the counter, where John grasped for anything. He ended up crashing a plate over the much larger man's head, making him let go for a moment. John scrambled for his escape.
She hummed as if thinking for a moment, giving her lower lip a little nibble, "You have talent, John," She complimented, "One thing's for sure: You are definitely not a Ravenclaw!" She laughed, "The hat did good, placing you here," she smiled.
"Wow," Mary said in amazement. She glanced up to see Sherlock nod proudly, "These are your notes?" She asked. Sherlock opened the book and spread out the papers. She scoffed with ironic amusement. "Your notes look like rubbish," She chuckled, picking up one of the note papers, which was filled with writing, all kinds of words in Sherlock's neat handwriting, but when packed and compressed into the margins of the book's pages, it looked like a mess.
William heard yelling from the dorm room. It was mainly Sebastian who was shouting, William only heard John raise his voice a few times within the argument, which ended with John walking out of the room, face red with anger as he looked as though he wanted to punch something.
"It's your first fag?" John asked, smiling back at William, who returned his spiteful smirk as if to say, 'I told you so,' silently.
It was one of those nights in John's boot camp. He glanced out the window when they were shining their shoes and the glistening of the stars, mixing in with the other colours of the night, reminded John of him and his gorgeous eyes. John needed to know why those eyes are forever in his mind, staring at him whenever he closed his eyes, begging him not to leave as their foreheads met in an act of trust for their final few moments of contact. John blinked slowly, as did William. In every dream, since John has left for deployment, that moment was on replay. John knew it was a bit petty, that he was only overanalyzing that moment, and that William has probably moved on from that moment as soon as he left William's dorm that evening. William hadn't smiled at him through the window of the building when he left, unlike when he went on a holiday. It was just a cold, analytical stare.
"I don't want to fail because this is what I got for going away. What do you think he'll do if I come back with failing grades?"
Once they'd made it to the base of the steps, Sherlock was pooped. He'd never thought it would take so much energy to do something as simple as going down a single flight of stairs. Sherlock had quickly developed a newfound appreciation for the disabled,
"Be upset over...?" He heard next to him. John turned to see that William was right next to him, looking confused. "Oh, has someone debunked the painting!?" William asked, his eyebrows flying up in slight surprise at the thought. John and William continued to walk down the hallway.
"So, it was consensual, then?" Willam asked, clearing his throat, obviously uncomfortable with his own words. John only nodded. He tightened his lips as he felt his mouth growing drier by the moment. William nodded in agreement, then spoke up again to ask, "Did you, uh, you use a, uh...?" John understood what he meant, and he nodded along with muttering,
"N-no, sir. That's not what I meant," John said, his head lowering in lack of self-confidence. "It's a nervous tick," John's neck and left shoulder twitched and his breath hitched. "I didn't mean to disrupt, sir,"
John, Sherlock thought as he let his hand grab onto the bottom of a shirt's hem. He saw John and how worried he looked. Sherlock wanted to correct John, that he had died, but a Ravenclaw came in and looked at John. John went with the girl, almost forgetting to even wave to Sherlock.
Flitwick was very excited to see Sherlock back to Charms class. The class proceeded as usual. Everything seemed boring without John's presence, annoying or not. He hated to admit it, but he felt like he became almost dependant on John to determine his mood.
"Your family will be very disappointed," He could vaguely hear from above himself as he blinked his eyes open.
"Do you have your wand on you?" Jacob asked, jogging up the stairs to the fifth-year dormitory. He came back down tossing his jacket to John, who held up his wand. "Come on," he whispered, "we've got to get there before it starts,"
John hit the ground and he blacked out again. During his one minute black-out, while Madam Hooch was still trying to make her way to him, John's vision returned to a moment when he was above everything. He noticed three boys pushing something.
"Hey," came the timid greeting. Sherlock responded with a hum, without looking up from his book. "I heard what happened; I'm sorry to hear it and I'm here for you if you need me," Victor placed a gentle hand over Sherlock's, which got his attention. Sherlock looked up at the Hufflepuff with softened eyes. He twisted his wrist around and squeezed Victor's hand and they sat in somewhat comfortable silence.
"Genetic and birth records," Sherlock growled the demand, making the receptionist hesitate, "every child, Muggle or not, born from around the same time my son, William, to about a year ago," the man let out a sharp breath as if sighing, John and Sherlock gave a quiet look to one another, "and an empty office, please,"
Sherlock headed to History of Magic class, hoping to see John there, but didn't. Sherlock felt his heart tighten with worry. It was okay, though; he was okay, right? Sherlock proceeded to Astronomy, where the Hufflepuffs were still whispering about how Sherlock had unintentionally made Mary cry a few days back. It made him angry to know that people made him out to be a bad guy, even though he's only but a loner, who doesn't value other people stealing his friends...! Maybe he was jealous, but he sincerely doubted it,
He looked behind him, then leaned over the railings. He saw that the level below him was lined up perfectly, so he threw his bag down and climbed over said railing, then turned himself around and jumped. As he landed, the shifting of the staircase below his unsteady feet had him off balance. John fell, grabbing his bag strap as he tumbled down the turning staircase. Kids from the safer side of the stairs looked, surprised that a student was daring and brave enough to be case hopping. John looked up at Greg, who was staring down in disbelief at John. He stood and went down to the safe platform, then hopped down two more levels to the first floor with a roll as he landed.
"Nah, mate. Mary's still in Jersey visiting her parents," John said, rolling his eyes. Mycroft smiled,
"Oh!" She chirped loudly. Sherlock harshly hushed her and all of a sudden, everything in his sight became clear, too clear. He closed his eyes and covered his ears. But, it was no use. He could still hear everything clearly. "Honey, open your eyes," She cooed. Sherlock trusted her, but when he did, he got a light in the face.
"I think I should talk to the Stamford house," John said, putting his trainers back on and tying the laces tight.
"So, you hanging out with a boy for a few weeks. That's you acting out?" She asked, chuckling. "I don't think so," She said, bitterly glaring at the boy.
Snape stood in front of the class with his hands steepled almost like how Sherlock does it. Though Snape doesn't place them under his chin as Sherlock had been doing most of his life, he still highly respected the gestures and similarities the two possessed. It only meant that Sherlock was bound to be a great wizard and that he belonged in Slytherin...! They were to brew a 'Cure for Boils,' Sherlock wrote in his notebook. He already knew the basics of how to make it, but he was hoping that John would stop tapping his God-forsaken fingers so that he could catch the rest of the lesson.
"I managed to control his convulsions and his vitals," Madam Pomfrey said as she saw John in the chair. "He's been asking for you in his sleep, you know?" She said with a smile. John felt his ears heat up.
"I thought you were," William blinked, half-surprised, "Irene sexually abused you, right?" He asked.
Thankfully, because the Hospital wing was on the first floor, they didn't have to figure out how to pull Sherlock up a flight of moving stairs. John was actually very bloody thankful!
"Careful, John," William warned casually as he slowly looked over to the coughing boy. John took the rolled up cigarette out of his mouth and inspected it.
Sherlock dragged his feet to charms class with professor Flitwick, the head of Ravenclaw, who saw Sherlock enter and smiled from atop a tall stack of books.
"And, this is the part when you leave me to go hit on Irene, who only wants to get into your trousers and dash," William said with a half-smirk on his face, however, he let it drop when John looked at him, disbelief in his voice when he said,
"You made Mary cry because you wanted them to leave you be?" Sherlock nodded, making John groan in exasperation.
"I'd just keep your distance for now, if I were you, Sherl," Jim said, tightening his lips. "There are some recently nasty rumours about what he'd do if given the chance," Jim looked around and saw that the halls were mainly emptied. "I've got to get to Flying class; I'll send an owl tonight," Jim called, beginning towards the opposite direction to where Sherlock was headed.
"Hmmm. Interesting," John heard as he was looking at the painting on the low-quality computer screen and saw a reflection that wasn't his own.
John's face was red and irritated and he struggled with carrying his trunk down the steps. Jacob reminded John of the levitation spell. John seemed unsure at first, seeing as his family is all muggle. John shrugged and slipped his wand from his robe sleeve. "Wingardium Leviosa," John aimed the wand at the trunk, which happened to comply with John's incantation as it lifted from the ground and John as if walking it like a dog on a lead, brought it to the common room and seemed ready to leave.
"Mate, it was a couple of times when I got really anxious," John said with a chuckle, looking at Murray as if he was an idiot.
"Bill, we're gonna need to carefully stand up," John said, urging the carefulness he needed for this task. John slowly stood with help from William and they stood to wait for Bill as he stumbled up.
"Here, I'll help," William said as he took the lighter and lit his cigarette before taking the cigarette out of John's hand.
"Excuse me?" She said, laying an indignant hand to her chest in feigned surprise, "I have you know that I am a pure-breed Slytherin with endless potential, unlike you two, Mud-blood and reject," she laughed. John growled in his throat. His hands shook and his face almost matched his robe's secondary colours in frustration.
John had to get out, so he grabbed his shoes and left the room, leaving William to stand there until he went after John once he realised how stupid and trivial the argument as over. John was sitting on a bleacher when it started to rain.
"It's too dangerous to try and pick him up because we have no idea what the state of his neck is right now," John explained, tugging the shoulders of his shirt to slowly pull him onto the jacket. Sherlock wretched up another two slugs. "If we move him the wrong way, it might damage him more so; I only turned his head so he didn't choke on the thick slime of the slugs' discharge,"
"Good news is Gryffindor earned 150 house points," John said, "bad news is that Professor Dumbledore doesn't like to be left in the dark and Jim Moriarty's a snitch," Mary's eyes lit up, then dulled with confusion.
However, John, unfortunately, couldn't roll him and help him around the castle all day every day as they occasionally had some classes apart, unbelievably enough. Professor Sprout has been getting agitated with the frequency of John's latenesses to Herbology.
Kids played Gobstones and used the levitation charm on one another, laughing and talking amongst themselves. John entered his line of sight and Sherlock stood to greet him.
"Sir, I, uh..." Sherlock began, genuinely anxious, "h-his tapping, sir; it's utterly infuriating," Sherlock managed, pointing a thumb over his shoulder to gesture to John, who looked up at Snape with nearly innocent eyes.
"I sure hope you haven't shot anyone this early in the morning, John," She said with a sigh, giving Fusco's desk, which was empty as the detective hadn't shown up to work yet today, a knowing look as she dropped a heavy file onto her own desk, "why are you calling me?"
"So, how did you send your brother a message, and get a response on the same day?" John readdressed that part on the topic because he was just curious. No telephone nor mobile worked that fast in John's household.
"Don't make fun of me, okay?" Bill said, frowning at his friend, who turned back and motioned for Bill to put the fag in between his lips. John didn't lean in as close as Wiliam when he lit John's first one.
"Hey, I'm talking to you," John said, walking after William as the taller boy ignored him. "What is wrong with you?" John shouted, increasingly angry by the time William reached his room. It was obvious the boy didn't want John around. So, John returned to his dorm, which had rarely happened for him in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, William took the nurse's advice and avoided John for the rest of the week. And, h, it was difficult. It was so difficult for William to not sit where John was sitting. It was difficult to not stop by John's door on the way to his own. It was difficult for William to not audibly scoff when he saw John get frustrated in the library.
"I think I'm fine sitting here with William, thank you," John answered, smiling, hoping she understand his wishes to stay at this table.
They ate sandwiches in the little tented area and talked. Victor taught Sherlock how to play Gobstones and he remembered the time John stood up for him.
"Are all tinker-kids this moody?" John groaned under his breath as he walked across the floor to sit at his bed and take his shoes off.
John nodded and began with the long list that made his hand hurt from writing so much. "How do you know they're wizards?" He asked, only but glancing to the boy, who added two more to his pile.
"I have with me," Sherlock groaned as he hopped down with a little bag, similar to John's musical coin pouch, and looked down at it as he sat on the seat heavily. He pulled out a paper and unfolded it to read the numbers. "A lot more than you at the moment, however, I'd wager seventy-five Galleons and eighty Sickles that you'll go into Hufflepuff,"
"You could try a flat share," Mike suggested and John replied with another bitter scoff as he took another sip of his coffee.
They lied there for longer than they thought they had, just listening to one another's breathing as John's left hand was on his stomach, his right hand was in William's as the taller boy slowly rubbed his thumb across the scar and brushed through John's hair once more.
"No, mate! Not until you promise not to throw Sam's cat out the window!" Greg's annoyed voice came to follow as the frustrated teen descended from the steps. John walked up to him, but Greg looked behind him and shouted at another pair of first and second-years, who wrestling really close to the fireplace.
John wrote the rest of his insipid blog post, and people commented and came up with their mad, somehow half-correct accusations about John's sexuality. Honestly, John had no idea who he was. He loved William for half of his life, however, John's made himself quite convinced that he could learn to love this 'Sherlock,' fellow almost as much. If only the man swung that way, John thought. John looked at his mobile and saw the time. He figured that it was time to go to bed.
Sherlock had been working in the mortuary for the past couple of hours and had just gotten to the most crucial part of the case. The door opened and Mike held the door open wider whilst Sherlock was quickly writing something in his book. There was someone else who entered the room, he bore a cane from the sound of it. Sherlock glanced up after the second man muttered,
"Oi," The officer said, "When you find yourself a girl, marry her, and invite me to the wedding, okay?" He said. John nodded proudly as he held out a hand to shake, but the older man instead wrapped John in a hug and patted the younger man's back. "You stay outta trouble, yeah?" John didn't respond. He didn't want his commanding officer to hear him sob. That man was like a father to the john. More of a father to him than his actual father ever was, really.
"Well, I still think about him," John said, making his daily rounds to administer medication to the patients in the infirmary tent.
"Spotting our three men, Mr Reese; they're flying together, booked the same hotel, called to order the same cab. They are personally connected, which is a convenient coincidence as they probably won't split up individually." Finch explained.
John was quiet after he left. He went through the motions of the first day and even though he was drained of energy and exhausted beyond compare, John couldn't sleep. He tossed and turned, even accidentally woke some people up. He couldn't get comfortable. William wasn't by his side. John's mind was constantly drifting back to that ever-repeating moment. He said it. John should be happy. The one he liked, liked him back, but he wasn't. The fact that William had said it out loud through his ever so apparent tears had somehow made it even that much worse for him. Now, his mind couldn't stop repeating and he'd more often than not, doze off and get scolded.
Greg glared at John until he saw who he was sitting next to. "Isn't that that Holmes kid who talked shit on professor Snape to his face?" He asked. John nodded, putting his bag on the ground. John opened it and pulled out his Ukelele. He'd begun tuning it by ear and strumming lightly to test as Jacob questioned the nonchalance of John's response.
Thanks to everyone who still reads this shit. I took a bit longer with this chapter but it's finally here, lol!
"I don't need to meet him to now that he's way too incapable of taking care of himself to even come up with a clever case like this." The consulting detective stated, folding his arms as if he were a child, pouting out to the streets of New York.
"After moving here, it was very difficult for me to get started with a history like mine," The old woman said sweetly.
"And, I might just finish the job that..." And, there it was. John Reese had begun listing the names of the boys, and girls, that participated in the hazing that night. Finally, Sherlock was getting somewhere...! John stood up and fixed his already perfect hair, somehow, "If you're truly as good as you claimed, you don't need a physical list. Besides, the paper is evidence, no matter how you destroy it," and, with a final kick to the stomach, John Reese was ever-so-casually making his way down the corridor, whistling some kind of tune to himself, then switching to a hum instead.
"Uh, things are complicated," William said, taking another swig of his alcoholic beverage, "I think I like someone at school," he muttered, causing his father to practically cough up a lung.
"Okay, then," Jim looked around swiftly before pulling his wand to cast, "Silencio," with practised swings to his hand, sending its effects on Sherlock, who only silently grunted, slightly panicked. Jim went behind Sherlock and pulled on the handles of the chair, excusing Sherlock from the table for him. Jim leaned over, "I'm so sorry, Shezzer," he whispered, "Please, pretend to look as impartial as usual,"
'Wait, what's going on?' Mike mouthed back, further furrowing his brows, knitting them together. John stood back up with a sigh and he stood closer to Sherlock than he could've ever hoped, looking into Sherlock's eyes with a smile.
"Look, I-I said I'm sorry, Ok--?!" Sherlock was shoved into the snow before he could finish. The boys laughed as Sherlock grunted. He tried to stand again, but his legs kept giving up.
John never disclosed his future wishes, other than his medicinal studies, with anyone. No one knew of his plans to join the army, no one. John quickly dismissed the phrase as just that. 'He can't've known. I don't even know this kid...!' John thought as he let out an annoyed sigh.
"Mate, no, you bloody weren't! You were walking towards he bloody jukebox!" The older boy shouted angrily.
"Unless he'd jumped out the window in the last minute and a half," Sherlock said, sipping the cup of coffee he'd been making, "He's not going to work," Sherlock informed. "Oh, hey. I told you I'd take your trousers to the dry cleaners," He gave a quiet whine to his voice.
As John walked with Mary to their seats, kids from their flying class, and even those who weren't, gave John high-fives and handshakes. It felt weird getting all of the attention. Mary saved him. Why weren't people recognising that?
"Hey," John said, sitting down. Sherlock sat, too. He seemed to have cleaned up, too. Now, his face and hands were only red from the burns he must've sustained from the explosion. His hands were wrapped up, but Sherlock got a glance at his wrists. They were bruised, but Sherlock had a sickening feeling in his gut that it wasn't from the explosion.
"This is Mary Morstan. She's a very gifted first-year transfigurer, and she'll make sure you pass this next exam, is that clear, John?" She asked. John immediately nodded.
"Hey," John greeted with a smile. Almost immediately, Victor wrapped his arms around John's shoulders. Sherlock chuckled some.
"No! I think it's cool; girls might think it's hot; you never know," John said, laughing at the end.
"But," John said, a bit dumbfounded, "Doesn't the Nokia 9000 Communicator come out in August?" John asked. William only nodded, then turned the mobile around for his own eyes to bask in the glory of the advanced technology.
"Right, and if you're not as moody as I claimed to be, then why have you not introduced yourself to me first? Isn't it a bit hypocritical to-" John started but was cut off by the boy's voice shouting,
"Yes, but that's only minor compared to what happened to you," he said with a nod. Sherlock tilted his head. Flitwick looked at John, who shook his hand horizontally under his chin, telling the professor not to delve too much into detail. The goblin-man cleared his throat and moved on to greet other students as Sherlock glared briefly at John, who must've been an admittedly good actor as he hardly reacted.
"Yeah, I'll see what my perfect says," John said with a nod. Before he could walk away, John was topped by Sherlock's hand on his arm.
"I finished it," William muttered out of boredom, rolling his eyes, yet he didn't think John was paying him any mind. He only nodded and hummed in response. William sighed and studied John from a reasonable distance.
"For God's sake...!" Sherlock mumbled, bringing his hand to his face to catch his sigh of utter annoyance. The two students looked at him.
"Good morning professor Flitwick," John entered first, as they'd agreed on their way to the restrooms, to surprise him with Sherlock's awesome presence, as he himself put it as John laughed.
The next morning, Sherlock felt giddy with excitement. He woke up extra early and snuck himself to the common room with a few hundred Galleons and a bag of Flew powder. Sherlock climbed into the unlit hearth of the common room and called to his destination, "221b Baker Street!" Sherlock threw the powder down and erupted into a flame of blue.
"What are you-?" He began, seeming tenser and tenser by the moments. Sherlock hummed, contemplatively, letting his eyes fall all over the boy, his face, his clothes, his limp... Interesting, Sherlock glanced up to John, who now had a book opened, but had his eyes trained on the two of them intensely.
The time said it was early enough for breakfast, so he decided to go. He sat down at the end of the table, where he would usually sit, but he tried to limit himself from eating like a pig as it would probably kill him. Sherlock pulled out a book and started to read when Victor sat next to him.
"Did you see how he reacted when I mentioned Jossy?" Sherlock asked, leaning against a wall outside of Ravenclaw tower. He was smiling as he twisted his hands as if they were screwing something in, on either side of his face.
"Well, how're you holding your wand, then?" Sherlock asked, arching a brown. John showed him the motions he used and Sherlock clicked his tongue, shaking his head.
"Well, we're running you there ourselves, so I assume it is," The man said with a bitterly satisfied smile, "Lestrade will run the paperwork, and before you know it, you'll be out of the Yard and in a comfy bed in Rehab."  The man widened his smile as the intern stood up to run said paperwork.
"And, I've only ever read those police reports. I couldn't find the evidence, the excerpts that I've included in my emails are direct quotes from the news, reports, and paper articles. Please, sir, if I could just get ahold of the clothes, photos of the crime scenes, his shoes, whatever, I can guarantee I can solve the case,"
William woke to a cold spot on his stomach, what used to be protected from the chill of his room by John's head, unconscious and blissfully calm. William opened his eyes to see John walking out of the bathroom, yawning as he stretched.
"I'm sending an owl to Dumbledore, immediately!" She shouted, running back into the castle and off into a side corridor. They couldn't stop or wait. Sherlock's state was becoming worse and worse by the hour and John really didn't want to think about how much time they had before something irreversible happened. So, John strained himself physically to make the trip shorter in time.
"You know the city better than I do, John. Look around and deduce," Sherlock muttered. John did as Sherlock suggested, looking around.
"John, you had an owl in an hour ago!" Jacob called as soon as John was making his way down the stairs to the common room. "B-but, uh... they insisted, so... ehr," John arrived at the base of the staircase and as he rubbed the sleepiness from his eyes, he heard a familiar laugh snort from deep, near the door.
"I think he stopped following me when I jumped off the stairs," He panted. Jacob's eyes widened considerably.
"Uh, yeah. So, Sherlock went... He went backpacking around in, uh, where was it?" Mycroft began but trailed off, seemingly confused or lost.
"This isn't right," John said with a breathy chuckle, "th-this really... she can't," John ran a hand down his face and halted until he remembered that his features weren't his own.
"Are you insisting that the girl that I like, is a lesbian, William?" John asked, almost reaching his breaking point, trying to breathe so that he didn't snap on his newfound friend.
"Ah, yes, but, headmaster Dumbledore advised me not to speak publically about that as we could be taken to Wizengamot sometime in the spring," John chuckled awkwardly and sucked his teeth, "Sorry," he shrugged.
Harry was glaring at John as if he'd just kicked a puppy and John knew why: He'd left them to deal with dad all this time. John's mum gently wrapped her arms around John's shoulders, pulling him in for a hug. "Usually we go home for holidays, not mid integration," John muttered as he didn't respond to the embrace, shouting the state of trust right there. "Uh, I have to go to breakfast," he said, gingerly pulling himself away from his mum, "Sorry," he tightened his lips.
They laughed for a bit and they studied there until it was time for dinner. They sat together until Victor had to interrupt, getting between the two. Victor sat closer to Sherlock than usual, which was weird. Definitely strange, but Sherlock didn't object. Should he have?
Sherlock left, off to find a phone box. Once he found one, Sherlock sat inside, looking through the book. "Watson," He whispered and let the pages flap amongst themselves, sorting out the different names, numbers, and addresses. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and skimmed along with the thin page that lay still in the book. "John H. Watson Sr?" Sherlock tore that page out and exited the booth.
"Shouldn't you be more focused on the two about to have their own bloody modern Warfare in there?" Sherlock asked rhetorically, then stormed from the Ravenclaw tower.
William found it especially difficult to accept when he saw John gave up, sitting in with the Jocks like himself and not wasting his time sitting and waiting for William to return to him. He also found it remarkably difficult not to think about John and how much happier he seemed to be without William there to alienate him from the crowd. William found it difficult to sleep on nights where he'd think about it. John hadn't tried especially hard to reach out to the boy.
Greg Lestrade came into the flat, his voice was heard by John as it can be assumed that he'd entered through the kitchen. "Giles, you've booked the same hotel for the three of us, haven't you?" Sherlock asked as he entered the sitting room.
"Jossy Carter, John," he smirked, glancing at John, who turned his head abruptly with a huff of frustrated air. That made Sherlock chuckle.
"All I'm saying is, it's a dangerous game you two are working for and approaching John Reese's best friend like that," Jossy sighed, then asked for a  quill and paper. She propped it up on a wall nearby, folded it up, and told him to make the meeting a little bit more discrete than today with Harry. John nodded and swallowed cautiously. "And hey, I'll talk to the others about making you a beater...!" She smiled, giving John's shoulder a pat. John nodded, not knowing what a beater even was. John made his way up to the dorms, which was louder because most of the perfects were worried about what the hell was going on downstairs.
While William was sitting at the table, drinking with his father as his mum was cooking dinner, he was pulled from thinking about John by his father's chipper voice.
John pulled Sherlock into the hospital wing and worried as Hagrid transferred him to a bed. Sherlock remembered John there, strumming that day. He was humming the tune to the song he'd played on the train that day. That wasn't even a week ago.
John left for his classes, which were Maths, Medicinal Science, then A.P. Biology. John told William to meet him in the Library at noon. William noticed John'd left his coat from yesterday on the back of his door.
"Fine, I'll go with Sherlock first whilst you figure out the plan, then I'll go with you and investigate the suspect undercover, okay?" John finally gave in, giving a compromise to both of them, but Sherlock had to sneer,
"Oooh, so tough, you are, with your bloody robe...!" The man mocked. John sighed as he heard his dad stop banging on the door to his bedroom. He slid down the door, where he curled up and sobbed.
"Well, yes, John. You are posing as one of the most desirable older women in the Ministry, after all," he muttered back with a teasing smirk. John let a grumble through his gritted teeth. He pinched Sherlock's arm, grinning bitterly as his friend yelped in quick pain, then giggled.
"S-sorry, it's a tick, is all," John tried to justify, but Snape knitted his eyebrows together in a deep furrow,
"U-uh, I'm not going to fall, Victor," Sherlock reassured nervously. Victor tightened his hold on Sherlock until her realised: "Oh, you're hugging me," He felt Victor's shoulders shake as he heard a muffled giggle from the boy's face, which was wedged in between Sherlock's neck and shoulder. Sherlock hesitantly let his weight shift to his right arm as he brought his left up to pat Victor's back.
Then, as John stepped into the shower and turned the water on, he felt his mind slip to the boy he'd partnered up with. As his hands traced over the skin of his neck and shoulder, John closed his eyes. His hands carefully slid down his arms as he thought of William's peculiar way of dressing in the most extreme formal attire John'd ever seen on a boy his age. John chuckled at the thought as he washed over his under-arms and upper-chest. John'd moved on to his lower-chest and upper-abdomen as he thought of William's hair. It looked so soft and so bouncy. John wanted to see if that boy's curls were even more active if he ran. John wondered how they felt. Were they soft? Was it silky smooth, or was it more of a fluffy feel? If John got his hands tangled in them, would each curl hug each of John's fingers like that jumper his mum made him pack? John let his hands trek lower as he thought of the boy's facial features.
"You've lost an unhealthy amount of weight since last night, John," He said, "You'll feel better once you've eaten, I swear it," William said un-steepling his hands from under his chin to look at the other boy. John sighed and handed William his notebook to go step into the almost completely vacant line for some food.
John was friends with Mycroft. They were as thick as thieves. So, of course, it was a surprise when Mycroft's apparent brother showed up late to a dinner, which he and Myc's boyfriend, Greg, were invited to. "This is my younger brother, William," Mycroft said, gesturing to the man, who'd taken off his black Belstaff and unwrapped his pale throat of the bright yet navy blue scarf and hung it haphazardly to the rack before turning back to the table and pulling out his chair,
It was true that John was an aspiring doctor, however, he wasn't accepted to the academy for his extensive knowledge of medicinal sciences. He was accepted for his deceiving physical records. Despite his short stature, John was a powerhouse, who was indeed also growing fond of the idea of going overseas to possibly be a soldier of some sorts. The problem was, John got frightened of the pressure he would be put under if he were on the front lines with the other forces.
John did his best to focus on his school work as his mum had told him to do at the end of summer, but it was really difficult. With Christmas coming up, John wasn't even sure if he was going home for that. All of the other first-year Gryffindors were. Their parents miss them too much for them to be left in a dusty old castle during the holidays. God knows there'll be drafts in the house, god forbid giving them colds...! John chuckled bitterly as he thought of that whilst walking from Charms class to Transfiguration with Hufflepuffs.
Sherlock did as he said he was, he listened. John talked and he stayed quiet. John had a lot to say and he looked scared to say a lot of it as if someone would shout at and discipline him for saying it,
