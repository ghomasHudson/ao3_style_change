is shopping." Sherlock gritted out, using John’s name pointedly and then turned to shout for Mrs. Hudson as he grabbed the shopping and headed for the kitchen, Mycroft raised an eyebrow at the bags and used his umbrella to gesture towards them.
John had the urge to slip his hand into Sherlock’s or wrap an arm around his Alpha’s waist but refrained, it was one thing for Sherlock to want to bond them together behind closed doors in the throes of a powerful heat and share a kiss in the heat of the moment when they were alone, it was another matter entirely for Sherlock to be affectionate in front of other people or so he thought anyway. Poor John nearly jumped out of his skin when Sherlock stopped dead, eyes going wide in realization and then turned to John to plant a great, soppy kiss on lips.
"Morning." John replied once they broke the kiss, Sherlock watched as John stretched, wincing at his sore muscles and the sting of barley healed bites and scratches being reopened from the movement.
was that?" John still had his head ducked so he flicked his eyes up at the detective who was now glaring at John over his shoulder.
"What?" John was starting to pull away but Sherlock couldn’t have that so he kept a tight grip on John and explained.
"You were taking too long so I got cleaned up in the pub bathroom. Hurry up and get out, you need to clean up too... and take our bags up to our room while you’re at it." Sherlock said coldly, not once looking at John. That was right, he couldn’t bond with Sherlock because Sherlock didn’t want to bond with anyone, especially John if the speed he took off at earlier was any indication. John nodded sadly and slid out of the car to grab the bags Sherlock had dumped on the ground, he tried not to wince when Sherlock backed away from him. As John was walking away he heard a loud hissing sound and glanced around to see Sherlock spraying a can of air freshener around and inside the car with his scarf held up to his face that he only pulled away to address John.
Sherlock wasn’t sure if the drive to Henry’s was strained or not, the silence between them wasn’t exactly awkward, especially with John chipping in every once and a while to break it but there was...
of all people had shared one of John’s heats, it didn’t matter that back then Sherlock had no interest or knowledge of John’s heat and it didn’t matter that he had been disgusted by the very thought of being involved in one. All that mattered was
, with bonding, even if the thought of John belonging to him was an appealing one and the fact he had quite liked the feeling of John’s body pressed against his and the smell of the short man, the
"Mr Holmes they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!" Henry called desperately and Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks, something about the way he said that was just.... Sherlock stalked back over to Henry who had his full attention now.
"John, you’re my friend but I want nothing to do with this, do you understand?" Sherlock said coldly and John winced but nodded.
"Thank you very much Henry! I’ll put a call in tomorrow to have Dr. Frankland’s work looked over, have a pleasant walk home!" Sherlock called over his shoulder, still pushing and tugging a protesting John towards the jeep sitting just beyond the trees.
Now back to Sherlock’s original point, Omega’s were sensitive to emotion before, during and after a heat so if one got it into their head that they wanted to bond with a specific Alpha, well, that’s what they’d do. Of course that’s taking into consideration the fact that most Alpha’s would consent to a bond, Sherlock on the other hand had no interest,
was it, Sherlock couldn’t take much more of this, anymore Alpha/Omega bonding crap and he’d snap! If he couldn’t forget about that afternoon then he’d do the next best thing, ignore it, it was the only logical thing to do and as long as John contained himself there should be no problem.
"It’s me. It was me. I’m sorry, Gary – I couldn’t help it. I had a bacon sandwich at Cal’s wedding and one thing just led to another..." Sherlock smirked behind the man’s back and Lestrade looked off to the side to hide his own amusement, it would be terribly unprofessional if he didn’t. When he looked back over at Billy it was with a face of incredulity.
"You go up, I’ll get this. We can talk then, okay?" He asked and John nodded, clearly still tired and slid out of the taxi slowly, once Sherlock was sure that John was inside he turned to the rude cabbie and paid him the fair exactly, there was no way the dick was getting a tip off of Sherlock after he’d disturbed his John. The cabbie grumbled as Sherlock jumped out and Jogged up into 221B, John was standing in the middle of the living room when he got upstairs, he was waiting for the detective.
"At night? You want me to go out there at night?" he asked robotically and Sherlock hummed in affirmation taking another sip of tea.
"I’m upset because my meathead of a mate decided for us both that I was getting pregnant on our first heat together regardless if I want children or not!" John snapped, his temper flaring up again and now Sherlock was even more confused. How could the Omega be happy about being pregnant with Sherlock’s child and angry about being pregnant all at once? He didn’t think he’d ever understand the Omega mind or just John’s in general for that matter.
He soon got his answer when his eyes focused on the destruction that littered the room and realization dawned when a memory from the past few days flashed brightly in his mind.
"Sorry, John. I win." Sherlock said smugly and picked up the stolen glass of beer as if to drink from it, of course he wouldn’t really, would be disgusting if he did. Fletcher’s eyes shifted back to him and he started rambling about bad feelings and imaginary friends who worked for the MOD, Sherlock just scoffed at him sceptically and looked to John as if to say ‘
"I’m going to put a call in to the local force, let them know what happened. You three should go back to the village; they can collect statements from all of you tomorrow." Lestrade told them after a moment of silence before striding off to the right and pulling out his mobile, Sherlock nodded at the man’s back and went to take a hold of John to pull him towards Grimpen but the Omega doctor shifted around him to head over towards Henry who had slid down to sit at the base of a tree, a blank expression on his face, John crouched down and laid a hand on the fellow Omega’s knee.
"This better not be another one of your crazy mood swings, Sherlock." John huffed, Sherlock winced and felt an immense amount of guilt fill up his chest, he hadn’t meant to muck John about, he just had a hard time dealing with his emotions and instincts, and he
"Well, those clothes’ll be irritating him so I’d recommend removing them and a nice hot bath will ease the cramps and muscle pain he’ll be going through. I can run one if you like whilst you deal with his clothes?" Sherlock gave the man a nod and moved back over John to guide the man gently onto his back; John gave a soft Omega growl at being pulled away from his snuffling mission but stopped when he saw Sherlock above him and reached for him instead. Sherlock smiled down at his mate and bent lower to kiss him softly, John purred and licked along the seam of Sherlock’s lips making the Alpha want nothing more than to deepen the kiss but he refrained and shifted his head to fit against John’s neck as he finished unbuttoning the Shirt John had started to remove in the car.
"That’s the point!" Sherlock snarled but John shook his head and drove forward again, Sherlock wasn’t having this, he knew John had a rough night but he needed
Sherlock was bored already, he was expecting something exciting when the doorbell rang! Not some posh, deluded, country boy Omega, who had clearly just finished a heat two days prior and was still experiencing hormonal imbalances, to come in to his flat and insist that he watch a stupid documentary about local superstition and a military base in the sticks. Sherlock could very clearly see that this man truly believed that he
"How about a nice cuppa and perhaps you could put away your harpoon?" She asked kindly but Sherlock just mumbled something about 7% before whirling around to point his harpoon at Mrs. Hudson making her jump and then started deducing her morning she shared in the company of Mr. Chatterjee, making the old Alpha uncomfortable.
?" He drawled in question and Gary snarled, not liking being ganged up on by two Alphas; Billy leaned over and nuzzled his lover’s bristly cheek to calm him down. The image brought forth the memory of John doing something similar back in that dining room earlier and Sherlock smiled lightly and glanced out the corner of his eye towards his own lover.
"Did you, er, get anywhere with that Morse code?" Sherlock asked and wasn’t that the greatest opening line ever. John huffed and started to march off, was this man actually serious?
’ when I last saw ‘im, must’ve gotten curious." Billy told him and although Sherlock didn’t understand why the man had put emphasis on ‘
"Actually, you could be just the man we want." John said and was pleased when some light shone in Greg’s eyes, mission accomplished.
when he was reacting to Fletcher, as far as John knew, Sherlock’s irritation had been because of the young Alpha’s taunting. Then again he did assume that Sherlock was infertile so he wouldn’t really have been looking for signs.
"Look John this is the only time I’ll ever say this but... I know I’m not the nicest of people; in fact I’m well aware that I can be absolutely abhorrent. I’m reckless, irresponsible, lazy, I can be downright disgusting when I want to be, I’m not the most affectionate human being on the planet and yet somehow despite all of that you’ve managed to fall in love with me and I you. You’re absolutely right to be wary of me taking on a parental role because you’ve seen no evidence that I can be anything other than a failure at it but I want to make something quite clear. I
"Quickly, prepare yourself. I need more." John wasted no time slicking up his cock whilst Sherlock pulled his fingers out, once John was satisfied he wouldn’t hurt Sherlock he gripped the man's thighs to make him rise a little so John could slouch for more leverage. Sherlock smiled at John’s ingenuity and moved forward so the head of John’s cock dragged over his hole, he hummed in satisfaction when John pushed up as he shoved down, the tip popping inside him.
"These records go back nearly two months." They heard Lestrade muse and looked back over to table, Gary was clutching Billy’s hand tightly in his own to comfort his Omega, and it was understandable considering the ginger man was trembling slightly.
"JOHN! WHERE ARE YOU?" Sherlock called from his the living room, frightening the life out of John who was just outside the door.
"John’s pregnant." All that could be heard in the building was a dull thud of a rather pricey umbrella hitting the floor, Mrs. Hudson’s cries about her carpet being ruined by a stream of tea that had flew from Mycroft’s lips and the deep, rich sound of Sherlock’s laughter.
"None of the cabs would take me." He replied and then dashed off to wash up, leaving poor John gaping at where his flatmate stood seconds earlier.
"Sounds like a good place to start." The detective confirmed John's fears and bit back a chuckle at the
corporal." John growled firmly, almost Alpha like and Sherlock’s control nearly crumbled to nothing, walking was definitely going to be a problem. Thank god for all the chemicals here and the slightly weaker sense of smell the Omega body possessed.
"Jesus Sherlock! I’ve been in warzones tidier than this! How are we going to explain this to the owners?" John groaned at the thought of the bill for the damages and kneeled to pull his holdall from under the bed frame; it seemed to be the only clean, undamaged area of the whole room.
Grimpen for all its faults and off putting surroundings, like Baskerville and the prison, could be absolutely breath taking. Henry Knight had put it best;
“Are you finished lurking then little brother? May we get on with our work?” Mycroft drawled causing Sherlock to growl at him as he slid into the back of the car beside him.
was there light in the first place anyway? Sherlock was sure the curtains were firmly closed the other night when he had claimed John.
." He called softly, pain evident in his voice, John ignored it, however hard it was to do and kept walking.
"You don’t have to, I think it’s lovely and our child will love it." Sherlock swallowed and blushed.
You would think it was the moment he had let himself fall over the roof edge of Bart’s that was the hardest to bear.
anything for him to give me the chance to prove to him just how much I care for him by deepening our friendship to something more solid.
"Okay, okay." Sherlock soothed and moved so he could unbuckle John’s belt and remove his jeans, by the time Billy had returned from the bathroom there was a pile of clothes on the floor by the bed and John was down to his white rimmed, red boxer briefs. The little ginger chef just nodded at Sherlock and gave him a thumbs up before making his way out of the room and back to his own mate. Once Sherlock was sure he was gone he removed the last item of John’s clothing and jumped up to lock the door, he gulped when he turned back to see a completely nude John undulating against the bed Sheets, half hard but not lubricating yet, Sherlock’s eyes shifted from the gorgeous sight to the bathroom and then back to John before he nodded and started removing his own clothes and dumping them to join John’s in the floor pile.
That was another horrible mistake Sherlock had made, he remembered stepping into the bathroom behind John and catching sight of the damage he had caused in his anger and
Sherlock had stomped into the bathrooms, unwilling to wait for John, who was taking far too long by the way. It was the stupid Omega’s fault anyway Sherlock snarled in his mind as he changed his bottoms. When the pissed off Alpha had been doing up his belt he’d caught a whiff of John’s scent on his shirt and promptly dropped his chin down to sniff at it gently.
"Ok love, you know what I like." John called as Sherlock practically ran from the bedroom; John glanced back down at the tiny blue scarf and could feel his eyes tearing up.
that jumper and there was no way his child was being stuffed into such a god awful piece of fashion.
It was just a shame that a certain consulting criminal was busy planning something else for their future at that very moment, after all...
! Yes. Mmmm," He sighed when John started pumping it in and out, it didn’t take long for it to stop being enough and Sherlock was begging for a second finger, then a third. He winced a bit in discomfort when John added the third, he had only ever got as far as two on his own so he wasn’t used to it. John noticed and dipped his head down to lick at Sherlock’s erection, the detective was not expecting that and he yelled and threw his head back, John smirked and then pulled the cock into his mouth, parodying his earlier actions with the finger.
John pulled back from his snuffling mission and grinned like he was high, that was the solution to all his problems; he would bond with Sherlock.
"Can't help, sorry." He gave Sherlock a look that said he really wasn't though but it changed to expectant when he saw Sherlock suddenly straighten up a bit with an idea clearly forming in his genius brain.
"John, get out of my way. He needs to be taught a lesson." Sherlock hadn’t stopped growling since John confirmed his fears and it only got louder now John was protecting the other Alpha. John did step away from the door but only to approach Sherlock and wrap his arms around his waist carefully, Sherlock was going through another phase of Alpha protectiveness and John didn’t want to antagonize him since that hadn’t worked out for him so far.
." If there was one thing Sherlock had learned it was that apologizing was painful, even if it was necessary, however he’d always make the effort for John. They stood there together for another moment before pulling back completely to get back to business, walking closer together than normal as they left the cemetery.
"Do you want me to help you with that?" Sherlock asked as he approached John but the little Omega just smiled and shook his head.
"As I explained dear brother, John is shopping. We’ve had some interesting news quite recently and John is buying supplies to prepare for our
John sensing that Sherlock felt undermined, innocently tilted his head to the side and presented his neck to the man in submission and that was the straw that broke the Alpha’s back, Sherlock stopped dead and John bumped into his back.
It didn’t take long for him to reach his destination, 8:03 minutes to be exact but it was long enough. He brought the car to a screeching halt a safe distance from the black ‘copter and was immediately greeted by a short, stout, Beta man who stood by the side of the vehicle.
"What furniture? Where are we going to put it all?" John rolled his eyes as he headed through the kitchen and called over his shoulder.
Sherlock had thoroughly enjoyed the little nuzzling match he and John had shared, he had lost himself in John’s lovely sweet, woodsy scent that was still laced with his own spicy, musky one and the softness of his greying blonde hair against his face, he never wanted to pull back from that moment but the sun had set and they had work to do. In parting, just to make sure that John knew his affection was genuine he had laid a soft kiss on John’s left shoulder, the one he had so needlessly slammed into the wooden frame outside and slipped the ointment into his hand before leaving.
?’ to the Omega who was trembling before his very eyes. Just like that afternoon at Henry’s when he had pinned John against that door frame.
"Hang on; you thought it was in the sugar." John said and Sherlock held his gaze, attempting a neutral expression and failing.
"Then why didn’t you tell me about your heat?" Sherlock huffed, loosening his hold on John. The Omega sighed in defeat and licked at Sherlock’s neck, he wanted Sherlock to be as relaxed as possible when he answered his question. The Alpha hummed in pleasure at his Omega’s attentions and returned the affection by nuzzling John’s soft hair. When John was satisfied that Sherlock was relaxed and pliant enough that he wouldn’t have another attack of aggression he stopped licking and nuzzled under Sherlock’s ear.
"Mmhm." John nodded and Sherlock sighed as if John was a child that couldn’t comprehend something simple.
’ leaving John sweaty and stinking of sex in the back of the 4x4. Wonderful, now things were going to get awkward again and this time John didn’t know how they could fix it.
"Look John, there are plenty of other things in here for you to buy for our child... I’m sorry I snapped at you, I’m just not used to all this...
"John, what is it? Are you alright?" John jumped a foot in the air when Sherlock’s concerned tone came from right behind him; he spun around with both the bag and his almost untouched packet of birth control hiding behind his back.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, obviously if he wanted what he wanted he’d have to play ball with Mycroft.
, he couldn’t blame John, it was one thing for an Alpha to resist his instincts, it was another for an Omega to do the same, let alone on the verge of heat and surrounded with Alpha pheromones like the ones Fletcher and then Sherlock where letting off. When Sherlock raised his head again he realized that the smell of John on his clothes had calmed him down and it was then that Sherlock had an idea and decided to do a little experiment when he returned to the car. He had made sure to be especially cruel to John and upset him, not a nice thing to do yes but necessary to test his theory.
"Even if the rest of the village and Britain don’t know you and your dad aren’t crazy, the most important person that counts does;
"Yeah. What?" He asked as he trailed behind but Sherlock couldn’t give him a straight answer as usual.
’ John’s mind supplied, this is what an Alpha did to an Omega to mark his territory; this is what an Alpha did when he had chosen a mate. John’s panic was rising, he had to get Sherlock off him
"Don’t be such a drama queen John, besides they must’ve know this was going to happen, after all, the ginger one helped me get you up here the other night whist you were...
“I’ve missed you so much. I don’t know how I’m going to get through this John, a month and a half away from you and I’m already falling apart.” Sherlock whispered, he didn’t get a reply, he didn’t expect one but John still leaned his head into Sherlock’s gentle touch making the Alpha smile sadly. Sherlock didn’t know how long he stood there stroking John’s hair and losing himself in the image of his sleeping mate before a high pitched whine came from the other side of the bed and Sherlock looked up sharply. He had been so caught up with John that he had forgotten about the other person in the room.
"Mmm. Wait 'til she finds out about the one in Islamabad." He drawled and John snickered and got in the taxi with their bags, closely followed by Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded to himself in acceptance, it was just going to have to be enough because he had to do this and there was no going back now anyway, no matter how much he wanted to. It at that moment Sherlock caught movement out of his peripheral vision when John started to move away from his position at the foot of Sherlock’s grave, Sherlock couldn’t tell from his mate’s body language whether he was relieved to finally be able to move away from the graveside or reluctant; possibly it was a bit of both but in the end it hardly mattered. Sherlock made sure to hold back for a moment before following John’s movements through the trees, he made sure to keep a good distance away from his waddling mate but never too far that he lost sight of him.
! Wasn’t that just adorable! Sherlock dug his thumb nail against his thigh to try and regain some equilibrium, too afraid he'd be noticed if he ducked his head down to sniff for John’s scent on his shirt.
"Let me explain what happened and then if you still want to gut Greg like a fish, I’ll let you, okay." He negotiated soothingly placing kisses all around the base of Sherlock’s neck and collarbone.
’ just fine when he pinned John down, rutting against him and rubbing his scent all over the Doctor in an effort scare of any other Alphas. Which was another thing, John hadn’t even seen Sherlock
"I’ll go Join Lestrade and give you a few moments to sort yourself out." And then he was out the door and down the hall before John knew what was happening.
John smiled at the title he a Sherlock both bore now, he had never hoped for one second that such a domestic picture could be painted of them but he was thankful for it every day he opened his eyes, wrapped up in Sherlock’s arms and remembered that yes... it
or Cluedo." John's heart stopped. Not Cluedo. Not again. John slammed the laptop shut and stood up to put it on the desk.
By the time Sherlock took the road that led into Grimpen the last traces of awkwardness had faded and he and John were now sitting in a comfortable silence, the relief they felt at the loss of the previous tension was palpable and John was having a hard time keeping a grin from his face. He managed in the end though, after all he didn’t want to frighten the natives.
“Don’ wanna. Miss you, don’ go.” John mumbled, the pain relievers and exhaustion making him sound drunk.
He reminded himself that his heat was due in the next week so it wasn't uncommon for him to have these kind of thoughts, still it wasn't practical to have them about Mr
"That only means my scent will stop bothering you and my emotions won’t be all over the place. It can’t undo what’s already started." Sherlock tensed and stretched out a hand to gesture towards where he had pinned John.
It wasn’t until Sherlock scrolled down to the bottom of the text that the building panic in his gut abated and he made a mental not to beat Mycroft half to death when he saw him next.
surprise and holding a pint of beer he had just swigged I between John and Sherlock’s little exchange.
Time passed slowly and bit by bit John calmed down, half an hour had nearly passed before John sat up from the floor and swallowed.
"No." He said and Sherlock snarled at him, Alpha pride bruised at the Omega's disobedience and all of a sudden Sherlock's biological instincts were telling him to flip his John on his belly and sink his teeth into that tender skin at the back of the neck to assert his dominance, but John wasn't
"Too much time with Sherlock much? Do us a favour John and don’t tell him, you know what he’s like." Lestrade pleaded when he saw the other Alpha approaching.
"You know what I mean." John once again went back to his food but a curious look Sherlock didn’t like came over his face as he took a bite, Sherlock ignored it in favour of taking another sip of his coffee.
"I think we should stop for some air." Sherlock said finally breaking the silence and John looked at him curiously.
What he couldn’t of known though was that Sherlock had be particularly bored during the night and had decided to pop down to Bart’s earlier that morning to get some knew experimental test subjects from Molly and in all the excitement of finally having a case, had forgotten to re-refrigerate the particular subject he was working on. That was why when John walked into the kitchen still contemplating breakfast he barely managed to hold back the manly yelp rising in his throat.
"And Sherlock will cover our expenses for the extra days. Is it ok for me to eat breakfast outside at the benches Gary?" Gary nodded still grinning; God didn’t the man’s face hurt?
let alone Omegas, heat or otherwise. Although he did go through a faze at Uni where he was fascinated by the chemicals the brain released during heats by both participants but his interest only went as far as what he’d read in books, he’d never actually experienced it in reality. Why would he need to?
"Oh! Sherlock you nearly gave me a heart attack!" She gasped jumping back; Sherlock rolled his eyes at her and apologized quietly.
That was why he and Mycroft had convened after the Irene Adler incident, they both knew by that point, Moriarty and his network had to be put down because as long as he lived Sherlock and, by default, John and the baby would always be in danger and Sherlock couldn’t keep letting that happen. Sometimes Sherlock wished he had never met John, never started making connections and friends, never started caring for anyone else but himself, just remained isolated and uncaring because if he was still that man then this, leaving everything behind, wouldn’t be so hard but then he would look at John, maybe sitting in his chair reading the paper and idly stroking a hand over his growing stomach or lying beside him in their bed and chastise himself for thinking such thoughts.
"YES! YES! RIGHT THERE JOHN! YES!" Sherlock screamed when John’s cock pounded against his prostate, he was so close and His cock was being rubbed so deliciously between their bellies that he didn’t even need to touch himself, he could just keep pawing at lovely, gorgeous, amazing John, who jumped behind Moriarty and told Sherlock to run, who was screaming Sherlock’s name right now and coming hard and hot deep inside him. Sherlock’s eyes rolled back into his head and he came harder than he’d ever come in his life, so hard that it splattered against his and John’s chin, so hard that he stopped breathing for a full thirty seconds and so hard that his vision went black and he passed out, trembling and twitching beneath a panting John.
!!" He yelled and slammed the harpoon against the carpet to emphasize his frustration and making John wince from the noise before he looked down at the Omega and pulled his shoulders back to take on a dominating, Alpha stance.
, you said." Sherlock avoided eye contact in favour of rummaging through the sachets in the little basket.
The most beautiful, enticing, sweet, heady scent Sherlock has ever come across practically punched him in the face causing the towel in his hand to hit the floor, his eyes darkened to near black and his cock to rose ‘til it brushed his stomach with his knot forming at the base.
"You go do your thing, Greg. We’ll be there in a mo’." John said gently, Greg nodded gratefully at the Omega and followed the two men in front of him towards the little sitting room but as soon as they were out of sight, Sherlock rounded on John.
and left. When the door closed behind him John shut his eyes and took in deep breath, Henry's little question, appropriate or not, reminded him of a small flaw in Sherlock's little jaunt to Devon. John was due a heat in the next week and that could happen when they were in Dartmoor, where John couldn't just pick-up and take a thirty minute cab drive to Harry's.
"Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there’s only one thing to do: Find out where it lives." The detective drawled and smiled at Henry. John gave a mirthless laugh and then winced when the force of it hurt his shoulders, Henry glanced at him concerned.
"Just a quickie, c’mon John. You can’t actually tell me you don’t find the thought of fucking me hard in Buckingham, completely
"Yes please, full English with extra bacon, a cup of tea, white, no sugar for John and a coffee for me, black, two sugars." Sherlock was about the stride out of the place when John jumped in again.
bit more unhappy than he was now. Speaking of the doctor, John looked over at him curiously when he noticed where they were heading and Sherlock did a little backflip in his head, it was nice to feel the man’s eyes on him again, he would’ve glanced back but he was too busy rolling down the window to meet the soldier approaching.
"Not until you answer my question about the shopping. You and John sneak out this morning, disappear off my radar and then you come marching in with bags of groceries minus one pretty little ex-army, Doctor. So Sherlock,
"Yes – if you’d ever bothered to find out. Look, I’m not your handler and I don’t just do what your brother tells me." Greg said as if he was fed up, John understood that, Mycroft’s interference had a habit of pissing you off. Still maybe he could make Greg feel a bit included in their little investigation.
child?" Sherlock asked quietly, vulnerable. He was sure he hadn’t misread John over the time he’d known the Omega, he’d seen him gaze longingly at little broods of families as they had torn through London on cases, he’d seen him play and laugh with Lestrade’s children when they were invited to the detective inspectors birthday party a few weeks ago, he’s seen him cradle a helpless infant in his arms who had been abandoned in a freezing house by a murder who had killed his mate and ran away to save himself but more importantly he’d see how happy John was when the child had accepted his comfort and affection, returning it with little gurgles and he’d seen how devastated he was when social services took the child away with them. He knew John wanted children; he loved children so it could only mean that the thought of having
There was no reply which either meant Sherlock was ignoring him or was too zoned into his case that he didn't notice the reply. It was only 7:45AM and John could’ve cried, he was so used to waking up after ten these days that quarter to eight seemed more like three in the morning, still if Sherlock was out on a case then that gave John plenty of time to shower and have breakfast in peace for a change without Sherlock having an Alpha temper tantrum ‘til John paid attention to his moaning, he only hoped the jam wasn't poisoned... again.
"Anyway like I was saying, my heat is due sometime in the next five days and I only just noticed the symptoms this morning so we do have some time. I normally don't do this until my heat officially starts but I'll take some birth control, that should rein in the hormonal fluctuations in my scent that are messing with your head and then I'll get packed okay?" Sherlock shifted around the bed warily.
Or maybe even seeing his heavily pregnant mate being knocked to the ground as he fell, thankfully in a way that no damage would come to their child, but no. Nor was it when John had clambered over to his body to check for a pulse and seeing the broken look in his eyes when he realized there was none. No, none of that was the hardest part, don’t misunderstand, all of the above were hard, so
be proof." John could feel Sherlock’s smug stare at the back of his head but he ignored it in favour of comforting his new friend.
It was the heat; that’s what the difference was, John had read about this in medical journals but never actually experienced it himself. It wasn’t that Sherlock had gotten stronger, it was that John had gotten weaker, his body sensed that the Alpha pinning him was displeased and wanted submission, it didn’t matter that John’s brain was saying ‘
"I’m sitting here in nothing but a sheet and all you’re tempted to do is lift an ashtray?" Sherlock teased and John looked at him and blushed. That was when Sherlock got the most brilliant idea, he had only meant the comment as a joke but as he did mention it and since they’d been sitting on their own for ages now with no sign of anyone coming, why not?
the thought of John leaving him for anything; it was hell just watching John go to the bathroom let alone take a cab journey across London to an unfamiliar surgery followed by God knows how long fiddling with a chip and pin machine in the supermarket.
All Sherlock had done since they had left the flat was bitch about how unnecessary this test was, which technically
John stumbled up the stairs to the flat, laden with bags of all shapes and sizes and if he was honest a bit guilty, he really hadn’t meant to spend that much money but... at least he wouldn’t be unprepared for when the baby arrived. John snorted at himself and just made it to the landing when all 6’2" of his lover came flying out of the living room and glomped him.
Or the phone call with John when he had ordered him to stay put and watch him fall after telling his Omega that the call was his note.
It took a little bit of time but John found them taped to the roof of one of the desk drawers and planted them under the Skull before
John could see the man didn’t understand and decided this was an argument for another day, there was a more important issue about this that they had to address.
"Any long-term effects?" Sherlock smiled gently and rested his free hand on John’s tummy, stroking gently.
"Um. We aren’t quite sure, can you book us up for three nights? We can always book an extra day or two if our stay goes well." Gary nodded.
was it, he couldn’t take anymore, he pulled back from John’s hold on his body, making the doctor whimper at the loss but Sherlock shushed him and pecked his lips.
"Better get going, actually. There’s a train that leaves in half an hour, so if you want ..." Sherlock trailed off and winced when he saw realization dawn on John’s face as the man slowly turned his head away.
because of this and that was just unthinkable, there was obviously some sort of misunderstanding here and he was determined to get to the bottom of it.
The story was that just as they had pulled into a familiar street about twenty minutes form 221B Sherlock had instructed Lestrade, who had made good on his word of a lift in spite of the shock the poor man had back at Grimpen, to take them to a little registry office a few streets away from 221B, of course John hadn’t known about this since he was asleep and curled up against Sherlock’s side in the back of the DI’s car but apparently Sherlock had contacted Mycroft on the drive back up to inform him about his bonding with John, though he omitted the part about John being pregnant, and asked if his brother could arrange a small ceremony for them to make it
"Dr. Tyler says you can head back in now, you’re test results are back." Sherlock made a frustrated noise and was about to resume his bitch-fit but kept his mouth shut when John shot him a look of warning when they stood to make their way back to examination room.
"No, I can't. Now will you just tell me what's going on so we can finish packing and maybe if we're lucky we'll catch the train that leaves in an hour?" Sherlock snapped, John's instincts told him to back off from the irritated Alpha and this time John did what he was told and took two steps back. Sherlock's own instincts were telling him that this was bad, wrong and unnatural, that he should apologise and comfort his distressed Omega; he resisted. AND FOR THE LAST TIME JOHN WAS NOT
John gently closed the front door to Henry’s house, not wanting to disturb the hyperactive man who was now sleeping off a strong dose of sleeping pills John had given him. A hound indeed,
"No we won’t! Well not just yet." Sherlock assured and John shook his head again and looked back out the window.
"Sorry, Sherlock. My heat must be closer than I-" Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and hauled him forward, just managing to choke out ‘
and he was enjoying it. In fact John was enjoying the affection so much that he lost track of time and it wasn’t until the last rays of sunlight disappeared that he realised they must’ve been in there together for at least a half hour.
"Good... Good." Then he started the car and they were back on the road to Grimpen, this time when John looked out the window he was smiling. Sherlock might be an arse but he was a nice arse, John supposed.
"Oh! Listen, on the moor I saw someone signalling. Er. Morse, I guess it’s Morse." Sherlock started blinking rapidly as if to clear something from his eyes.
"Well then, let’s get this over with shall we?" Sherlock called grinning and John grinned back and jumped in the car too.
"We’re more than happy to pay for the damage." John said and Sherlock gave him a glare which was not unnoticed by Gary, the man just laughed.
. Then John had gone all pliant and lovely and started telling Sherlock all those wonderful things and just melted like hot chocolate to let Sherlock fuck his mouth; he hadn’t been expecting that.
The good doctor was having a hard time keeping his amusement off his face and looked left and right a couple of times to distract himself, then his eyes landed back on his lover and he frowned and tried to glance around the sheet before looking off to the opposite couch.
." They heard as they walked past but then John’s footsteps faltered and sniffed the air gently, that man was an Alpha, a fertile Alpha. The only way John could smell that much detail was if the young Alpha had recently had sex, perhaps earlier that morning. Apparently he wasn’t the only one smelling it since Sherlock’s nose twitched as well and wrinkled in distaste but then another scent hit his nose and he flicked his eyes to John. John’s eyes were a little half-lidded and he was panting quietly, he was aroused, another Alpha’s scent was arousing John! If there was one thing Sherlock
? How could you be certain of something like that Lestrade?" Sherlock asked in a terrifying voice, although he feared he already knew the answer. Greg looked over at John for help and Sherlock took a menacing step forward, it seemed to be Greg’s lucky day when Billy chose that moment to bounce up to the bar.
"Right, get in and let’s go." Sherlock ordered and stormed back to the driver’s side and got in but refrained from starting the car until John climbed in after him, once John shut the door behind himself Sherlock cleared his throat to get the Omega’s attention.
go home and shag John so much that he never thought about shopping again but before he could put down the bags in his right hand to do that, John dragged him into
and 2) I thought you two would appreciate a lift back to London rather than a train journey." John nodded and thanked the man; he really did
." When the detective didn't move away, John looked up and his eyes nearly popped out of his head. Sherlock was covered head to toe in blood, after a subtle sniff to make sure that none of the blood was Sherlock’s own he asked the only question that seemed to come to mind at that point.
." John begged and pleaded with Sherlock through his eyes, the detective just nodded and smiled at the doctor before rising to his feet. John attempted to follow but his legs weren’t ready for it yet and he stumbled, he would’ve fell back on his arse if it hadn’t been for Sherlock who grabbed him and held him up, one arm around John’s back, one locked across his waist.
"John, I’m losing my patience, give me the keys." John just narrowed his eyes and backed up some more, he wasn’t expecting the tall detective dive forward and grab him by the shoulders though so he wasn’t able to hold back an embarrassing squeak of shock at the force of Sherlock slamming him against the side of the car whilst growling into his face.
"Why, are you joking?" That set the Omega off, now he was trying to draw out Sherlock’s protective Alpha instincts by bringing up his deceased father and not trying to hide any upset or control his hormones indicating distress, it made Sherlock want to throw up at such a pathetic display.
." John startled himself at the sound of his own voice and the more he sat there surrounded by that addictive scent the more he realized that, yes he
"They’d be for sale. I mean, that’s how it works." John finished but then realised he hadn’t told Sherlock about the Morse code.
"I told you; I saw the hound." John huffed, snuggling Sherlock and making the man smile and rub his chin against the top of John’s head.
smell that too but there is another scent beneath that one originating from here." Sherlock insisted as he sniffed and nuzzled John’s belly, John sat up on his elbows and looked down at Sherlock.
If it weren’t for John, Sherlock didn’t know where he would be now, no, wait, that’s not true, he knew exactly where he’d be; in that grave John was standing over. Drug overdose or case gone wrong, it didn’t matter because it was simply impossible to think that he could survive without John in his life, it was that thought that had him hesitating for one split second before he fell. Would he be able to survive without John and complete this mission? Would he ever make it back to John when it was all over?
"Yes, sorry, yes, excuse me." He said before blowing his nose on the train napkin he had clutched in his hand. Sherlock saw John smile from the corner of his eye and his face relaxed from the slightly irritated expression it had been displaying.
"Come on, then. It’s time to lay this ghost." Sherlock said gently to the Omega and pulled him slowly in the direction of Stapleton’s lab.
"How can you possibly know how to drive but don’t have a licence?" He asked incredulously as he pulled back when Sherlock went to try and snatch the keys again.
Sherlock leaped across the room, landing on the bed behind John and dipped his head down catch it with his tongue near John’s knee and licked the slick line all the way back up to the source of delicious fluid. Sherlock’s tongue flicked quickly over John’s hole once and his head shot back in pleasure, John tasted like liquid gold. Sherlock’s eyes had rolled back and his eyelids were flickering as a deep guttural groan tore its way from his throat, John whined in response and shoved his arse back into Sherlock’s face catching the man’s chin and leaving behind a wet patch.
.’ and then tossed John into the back of the car, face down on his belly, quickly following behind and jumping in after him to straddle John’s hips, making sure to slam the car door shut.
! Sherlock gulped noisily in the car and he breathed in again, he saw John’s neck twitch with the resistance of not turning to look over at him and frowned. The hell was wrong with him?
"John, stop." Sherlock growled, when the man tried to tug his hands away, John keened and flicked his eyes to Sherlock, looking suitably chastised and miserable. When John’s eyes locked with his he noticed the Doctor’s pupils were already dilated and this was worrying Sherlock, John had told him three to four hours until the beginning of his heat but the Omega’s pre-heat symptoms were happening too rapidly for that to be that case, he had to get John inside and now so he could find out what was happening.
"Trust me; we’ve had more heats here from guests than you’d believe so I have an idea of what state the room will be in." Gary assured him, it didn’t ease John’s guilt.
"There." Fletcher shoved his phone into Sherlock’s face and Sherlock snorted at the perfectly, normal looking dog shaped blur, walking across the moor.
"Yes, yes, yes!" Sherlock called and started thrusting himself down John’s throat, John for his part just relaxed his throat and took it, focusing on breathing through his nose and swallowing every once and a while to make Sherlock groan. Saliva was dripping down John’s chin and soaking into his collar and tears were running down his face at the force with which Sherlock was shoving into his mouth but John loved it, he loved it because Sherlock was loving it, the Doctor could tell from the way Sherlock was growling, moaning, groaning and snarling John’s name over and over again. He could tell from the sweat that was covering Sherlock’s face and pooling at his collarbone and he could tell from the way Sherlock had sped up at the end before he shoved himself so deep that John never even got to taste his come before it was pumped down into his stomach in thick globs.
"Here’s my, er, cell number. If I could help, with Henry, give me a call." He smiled at Sherlock and handed him a card. Sherlock spent the next two minutes asking questions that Frankland just danced around, annoying Sherlock who just gave up and held up the card.
"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It's very promising." That was the moment John lost his temper a little bit, he hated it when Sherlock was like this.
"Mmm, thanks Billy." John said picking up his cutlery and Billy smiled at him before heading back inside just as Sherlock slid up beside him with two cups and presented John with one of them.
"Sherlock! You stop that, you’re going to ruin your teeth love, now what can I do for you?" The old lady mothered and Sherlock cleared his throat and gestured to the bags at his feet.
assistance whist I am able to give it to you, I won’t always be able to give you such luxuries Sherlock, enjoy them whilst you can.” Mycroft gave Sherlock one last pat on the Shoulder and turned to head back to his own car but stopped when Sherlock called for him, back still turned.
stood and started prowling towards them but Sherlock bared his teeth in a violent, inhuman snarl to warn them off; the other Alphas simply snarled back. Billy and Gary who were stood behind the bar both shot around to help the two men; Gary marched forward and stood between Sherlock and the other Alphas growling lowly as if daring them to challenge his Alpha status in his own home whilst Billy made use of the distraction and steered Sherlock through the back way to the stairs and opened their room door when they got there.
"YOU JUST SOLVED ONE BY HARPOOING A DEAD PIG!" John screamed back, though to be honest he still hadn't gotten the full story on that yet but he did get the gist… he hoped.
Sherlock sent the text as quickly as he possibly could and grabbed his things and car keys, practically flying down the stairs of the B&B he was staying at and barely managing to get the car door open of his Audi before jumping in and tearing off in the direction of the field Mycroft had told him his transport was waiting in. Sherlock’s hands trembled on the steering wheel and he was panting in quick rapid breaths, he wasn’t sure whether he was excited or terrified but that didn’t matter at this point, all that mattered was getting to the field so he upped the gear and slammed his foot on the accelerator, thankful for the long stretch of empty road he was traveling on.
"Oi! Your fella ran out of here about an hour ago, he looked awfully upset, I wouldn’t worry though, he looked as if he was heading up to the ‘
"Sorry. Hold on, I’ve got stuff in my toiletries bag for that sort of thing." He said before clambering off the mattress and standing, Sherlock had tried to pull him back but he ached all over and it was too much effort, he sighed grumpily instead.
are you doing here?" Sherlock called causing John to wince and shake his head in exasperation. That was his Sherlock; always the charmer.
, I’m Sherlock Holmes and I notice everything. You’re pregnant John. I’m not lying and I wouldn’t tell you unless I was 100% positive that I had all the data." John swallowed and fell back, Sherlock was right, he wouldn’t have said anything unless he was sure.
"Secret supply? What've you done with my secret supply?!" He asked her frantically and she looked at John confused.
Sherlock went for a drive across the moors to think some more about his theory and the more he thought, the more convinced he became that it was the sugar, he and John had done, ate and drank all the same things since they’d arrived, all expect for the sugar because John was a strange man and preferred milk in his tea to sugar.
, I just want to care for you, please just let me." Sherlock pleaded, laying kisses on John’s face and down the side of his neck. John’s eyes closed for a moment before he nodded and turned his face back to capture Sherlock’s lips again and God, isn't that just gorgeous!
"I was terrified, Sherlock. I was scared to death." John continued quieter but still furious, Sherlock wanted to hug him and nuzzle at his hair but he didn’t think his pregnant lover would appreciate that right now.
"John I need some, get me some." He ordered and John shivered inside at the order but resisted complying, it wasn’t easy for most Omegas to resist a direct order from an Alpha but John had years of practice and a military career behind him so he was used denying Alphas.
Speaking of John, the Doctor and his interviewee were gone and it looked like they had been gone for some time, Sherlock frowned and glanced at his watch, it was 12:34am, the last time he had looked it had been 9:15pm, hm. He wondered if John had managed to get any interesting data from his time speaking with the therapist, suddenly a horrible thought entered his mind. What if when he wasn’t looking, John and Louise had hit it off properly? What if they had decided to have an ‘
"JOHN! PLEASE, IN ME, NOW!" Sherlock howled and John slid his fingers out and pulled off of Sherlock with a lewd pop, the detective was practically sobbing as John slicked himself up and got into position. When John was situated above him on his elbows, he started pushing in and Sherlock’s vision went white, nothing could ever compare to the feeling of John sliding inside of him, inch by lovely inch. He couldn’t breathe and when John’s balls touched his arse he couldn’t hold it back anymore and the loudest, roughest, most painful moan he’d ever uttered was unleashed upon the world, God have mercy!
Sherlock and John both moaned loudly at the sight of the clear liquid dripping down near John’s belly button, Sherlock slid a finger through it and held it up to John’s lips, he swallowed hard when the doctor locked half-lidded eyes on his and bent his head to draw the finger into his mouth, cheeks hollowing as he sucked up and down on the digit. Sherlock couldn’t look, he squeezed his eyes shut and dropped his head back but it didn’t help, it only made things worse, He could feel even more clearly the sensation of John’s hot wet mouth sliding and pulling on his pointer finger and hear the loud slurps the doctor made with each upward motion, it was torture and Sherlock loved it.
By the time they crashed through Sherlock’s bedroom door they were both missing their shirts, shoes and socks, their belts and trousers were hanging open, in fact John’s was halfway down his thighs and their bodies were littered with scratches and bites, some of them trickling blood. Sherlock moaned when a drop of John’s sweat fell from the tip of his nose and landed on a weeping bite mark on his chest, it stung beautifully.
"None at all. You’ll be fine once you’ve excreted it. We all will." He assured and John gave him bedroom eyes when he replied.
"Can you walk?" Sherlock questioned and John nodded but didn’t let go of Sherlock so Sherlock shifted them around so he could put a steadying arm around John’s shoulders and keep one of the man’s arms around his waist.
condition." Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John and nodded for him to continue, he gave a loud, gravely groan when John bent his head slightly to bury his face in Sherlock’s hard crotch.
John had never been happier in his life and he loved Sherlock all the more for the gift of the heartfelt surprise, especially since he could later appreciate how hard that must’ve been for Sherlock to ask his brother for any sort of favour pertaining to his personal life. Mycroft hadn’t made it easy either, acting all high and mighty with his smug attitude and fancy umbrella regardless of the fact it was a special occasion. After all those smug looks and jibes about domesticity from Mycroft that had Sherlock nearly hitting the roof, John had made sure to show his
John jumped at the loud noise so close to him and nearly slammed his head against the roof of the car, panting from fright, John threw a look over his Shoulder to see Sherlock standing outside the car again, bags at his feet and a clean pair of trousers on.
John looked up at the Alpha gazing down at him, pupils blown, face and chest flushed and John’s lubricant still dripping from his chin, he looked magnificent and after tonight John was going to belong to him. The Omega lifted his head to the side, presenting his neck in submission to the Alpha and Sherlock surged down to sink his teeth into the soft tan flesh, breaking the skin so John’s blood would run down to mix on the already come and lube soaked sheets before surging back up to kiss John hard.
Then they went to the Hollow and everything had fallen apart, it was all that stupid bloody Hounds fault! None of that mattered at the moment though as Sherlock finally managed to get his arse in gear and jog back down to the bar. Sherlock made a quick sweep of the pub on the off chance that John had returned but was disappointed when he saw no sign of his gorgeous little Omega, Billy saw him looking around and called him over.
"Where is my purple dress shirt? I've looked everywhere for it and I can't find it." Sherlock asked irritated and John raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms.
. John’s eyes widened and he screamed, his arm snapping around to grab Sherlock’s hair and press the man’s face against him hard whilst his tongue and fingers fucked him over and over again ‘til his arse was gushing and fluid was running in streams down his thighs and Sherlock’s chin.
later. Sherlock took one last glance at Baskerville and then made his way down the rock and back to the car, he had to get over to Henry’s and actually sneak off with some of the man’s sugar, Sherlock hoped that wasn’t as strange as it sounded but still as easy as it sounded.
"There’s an old mineshaft. It’s not too far. It was all right there." Gary confessed and Sherlock chose that moment to jump in after picking up on a key word.
"John?" Sherlock whispered when he notice the Omega’s breathing had evened out but there was no reply so Sherlock just wrapped his arms tightly around John and rested his cheek against the soft blonde-grey hair on top of the smaller man’s head, closed his eyes and sighed deeply.
’ like on the telly?" Sherlock gave an internal scoff at the DI’s poor attempt at a cover story, did the man really think that if he kept on pretending he was here by some sort of coincidence, Sherlock would believe him? Did he honestly believe Sherlock was stupid?
It was another awkward silence in the car whilst Sherlock drove up to Baskerville, only this time the tension was much worse. When John had come back, sliding into the passenger’s seat and asked where they were going, Sherlock just ignored him and started up car that now smelled of ‘
"Perhaps you should sit down for another minute, John." Sherlock insisted but John shook his head and put one foot forward, prompting Sherlock to do the same with a sigh of resignation. One step at a time and with Sherlock holding tightly to his blogger, they made it out of the pool and into a cab, as soon as Sherlock had told the cabbie the address John had slumped in his seat and passed out. Sherlock phoned Lestrade to tell him what had happened and that there was still a bomb sitting in the swimming pool, the DI assured him that he would head over to retrieve it with the bomb squad and that he’d search for any evidence for Moriarty. Sherlock knew there would be none.
Sherlock hadn’t meant to doze off and yet he clearly had since the last time he checked the water was hot but was now luke-warm, bordering on cold. He wondered for a moment what had woken him but then his eyes flashed open and he glanced down to see John shivering against his chest, sweat darkening his hair and giving his supposedly dry skin a dewy look.
"No, I can't leave London at the moment. Far too busy. Don't worry, I'm putting my best man on to it." Sherlock said seriously and then strode over to John patting him on the shoulder.
"Sherlock, I know you well enough to know that you know I want children more than anything and surely you have to know that if I
John groaned in exasperation and pushed himself up into a proper sitting position, swinging his legs around so they were dangling outside the open door. He could play that scene over and over in his head all he liked but John knew he’d never understand what was going through Sherlock’s mind, which left the question; what was going through
"Sherlock, around this time of the month, do you notice anything strange about me?" John asked slowly and Sherlock frowned and thought.
Once he realized what he was doing however, Sherlock jumped back and cleared his throat, avoiding eye contact with John and instead turned to pack away the shirt he was still holding, John sighed sadly behind him, he had been enjoying that but he knew it wasn’t right to give in to is Omega nature and he really had to let Sherlock know what was going on.
The confusion was overwhelming, his brain was shouting two arguing points at him and he didn’t know which one to listen to. On the one hand Sherlock had never been interested in bonding or heat, hell he’d never had any interest in
Sherlock could smell it as he climbed the stairs, although they were clearly using some scent masking medication because he couldn’t quite pin point a proper scent, just something...
A pleased rumble by his ear brought John back from his internal panic and he kept absolutely still when Sherlock dropped his head and rubbed his cheek against John’s, ‘
"Everything we did, all that I’ve gone through, it was all for nothing. He still got away with it and people still think my father and I are crazy fools, I’ve no way to prove them wrong." John firmed his grip on Henry’s jaw and tipped the man’s head up to lock eyes with him again.
"Why haven't I noticed these effects before?" Sherlock asked embarrassed, he hadn't meant to upset John, really he hadn't. He just hated all this Alpha/Omega biology shit.
Well folks that’s the end of this story, I wanted to go out on a sweet moment before the very end and I hope I accomplished that ^^; and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this as much as I have had writing it.
When Sherlock was up to John’s waist he slowly reached out a hand again and laid it softly on one of John’s, the former soldier whimpered and squeezed his eyes shut. Sherlock just held his hand there until John sensed there was no danger from it and opened his eyes again, this time they were slightly more focused like John was there but in deep thought. The tall detective took this as a sign to bend over and place his lips at John’s ear, he whispered soothing nonsense like ‘
Once John and Mrs. Hudson were securely in the cab and heading back towards Baker Street, Sherlock emerged from his hiding place and headed off towards the entrance of the cemetery himself, he had just taken a step through the gate when a black car with darkened windows pulled up in front of him and a door opened to reveal Mycroft casually sitting in the back.
." John gritted out and Sherlock had a feeling that if he didn’t concede at least a little bit, he wouldn’t be able to indulge in his new found fondness for sex for a
"Sir, Major Barrymore won’t be pleased, sir. He’ll want to see you both." Lyons said, now addressing John and completely ignoring Sherlock, which was just as well seeing as how he was having a hard time, no pun intended, controlling his arousal at John's little display, Sherlock swallowed hard and his eyes shuddered in an effort to keep open, what was wrong with him? Why did he keep reacting to John?
"You said a quickie but you stopped us finishing the first time." Sherlock lifted his head to grin at John and chuckled when the man snorted at his pleased expression. They sat there gathering their bearings for a moment before shifting around to make themselves presentable again, John pulled his jacket over the cum stain on his his jumped and smoothed out his hair, Sherlock just wrapped his sheet back around his person and shuffled up close to John who was looking around again.
"I knew something wasn't right! I've been feeling strange all morning! Why didn't you tell me it was your time?! When did it start?!" Sherlock yelled with a disgusted look on his face, John tried hard not to show his hurt at the look, he told himself it was just the hormones and not the fact that his best friend found a part of him, something he couldn’t control, disgusting.
Although that thought would make the next part of his plan slightly easier to go through with; part of John’s punishment for letting that useless lump inside his lovely body. When Sherlock finally entered the room where Lestrade was interrogating Gary and Billy, he had steeled himself to go through with his plan, he really didn’t want to do anything to harm John and he’d make sure no physical harm would befall him but still... no, he had to do this. Lestrade was flicking through a book of sales records when he strode in but looked up at Sherlock nervously when he heard the man enter, Sherlock just gave him a smug grin and padded over to the little mini kitchen off to the side to prepare some coffee for John.
"I’m afraid we won’t have time for that. We’ll need the full tour right away. Carry on." John ordered and
"Mind if I join you?" Sherlock drawled and Fletcher looked up at him and gestured for him to do so before turning his back to Sherlock again.
"I'll let you know next week’s lottery numbers." He said smugly and John chuckled at him, as if he would fall for that... again, Sherlock huffed at him, so much for that genius brains great idea.
"Do you want me to get some pain killers?" Sherlock asked but John frowned and shook his head, pushing Sherlock to lie on his back and then proceeding to drape himself across the other man.
“I’ll be outside if you need me Sherlock.” Molly told him and closed the door gently behind him but he didn’t hear her, his eyes were locked onto the blonde man on the bed who was fast asleep and breathing gently, a sight Sherlock never thought he’d see again. Sherlock took a deep breath and inhaled the Omega’s scent that filled the room and almost crashed to his knees in relief, instead he took quiet steps over to the bed and slid a hand gently through John’s soft greying hair.
"Yeah. No choice. So it’s over." Billy finished and Gary sighed beside him once more trying to get Lestrade to see the lightness of the crime.
"Be with you in a minute!" Was called back, bringing John back from his musing’s. Greg was looking decidedly uncomfortable now after Sherlock’s little PDA, he looked as if he wanted to say something but wasn’t sure how.
“Around two and a half hours, weather conditions permitting.” Willis replied looking quite proud but Sherlock was in a hurry so he just ignored the man and jumped in his side of the Helicopter, going through all the normal preparations before Willis could tell him what to do.
It was 9:15AM; A case that only took half an hour to solve was never a good sign, John sighed and mourned for the peace and quiet he never got to enjoy and started hunting for Sherlock's secret pack of cigarettes that he knew the detective kept for when he was going through a dry spell with cases like he had been lately. It was a little amusing for John to watch Sherlock being so stupid for once, thinking that he was so careful and that John hadn’t noticed when he’d been sneaking a ciggy here and there when he thought John wasn’t looking.
"We couldn’t control the bloody thing! It was vicious! And then, a month ago, Billy took him to the vet and, er ... you know." The man softened his voice near the end when he caught sight of his Omega’s distressed look but John needed clarification.
leave. It was better if Sherlock let John wake up properly and gather his thoughts before speaking to him about anything, besides Sherlock had to go to Henry’s and pick up some of his drugged sugar, which was the only possible solution he had managed to come up with the night before. Narcotics.
John and Sherlock remained locked together in the graveyard for a long time, neither one of the wanting to pull back from the kiss and let the moment pass; it was such a shame that breathing was a necessity. John was the first one to pull back a bit but Sherlock followed his lips, dropping one last chaste kiss on them and then resting his forehead against the doctors. John tilted his face up to nuzzle his nose against Sherlock’s who smiled lightly and nosed John back.
"But quite quickly." Henry lowered his napkin and started his inane story about the 'Devil' tearing his father apart and where John looked at him concerned and confused all at the same time, which was endearing really, Sherlock remained sceptical and indifferent.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Hurry up, John! We’ve got somewhere to be!" Sherlock growled before going back to his desperate task, John sighed resigned and walked quickly inside. After all he’d invaded Afghanistan and survived, he could survive this too,
"Yeah, sorry about that... I may have spent a bit more than you assumed as well, it came to-" John started guilty but stopped when Sherlock held up a hand.
"Hey!" John gasped and dropped his bags with a thud but Sherlock was too busy sniffing around John’s neck and running his hands over his mate’s body to check for any injuries to acknowledge him, John smiled and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back, running his hands up and down to soothe him.
"Is that when you had the idea, after the TV show went out?" Lestrade asked, giving Gary a challenging glare so hard that poor Billy cracked under the weight of it.
"Oh! For the love of…!" It was a Foot. There was a foot on the table. A bloody foot! A bloody male foot on the table… and the toes were missing.
"So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor?" John asked, Sherlock eyes left the departing figure of Lestrade and locked on John.
Sherlock wouldn’t have thought anything of it if John wasn’t on the verge of a heat, well, that and the fact he seemed to have grown a quick attachment to Sherlock’s scent. Oh yeah, Sherlock had seen John rubbing his face against the seats in the back, it was why he had ran back inside the pub to grab the air freshener, John was also unconsciously sniffing the air every two minutes to try and get another pull of the detective’s scent but then wrinkling his nose when all he got was a waft of artificial plum. Sherlock had also noticed that although John made sure the mark on the back of his neck was covered up, John hadn’t washed off Sherlock’s... uh ‘
"God bless, Henry Knight and his monster from hell." Sherlock heard and glanced up when John answered.
John didn’t know how long he sat there on his knees in the back of the 4x4 and to be honest, he didn’t much care either, Sherlock would just have to wait, he had to understand
"I hurt everywhere and my arse is full of your cock and come... I’m bloody fantastic!" John giggled like he was high and Sherlock joined in with him. Once their giggles had abated Sherlock dipped his head down to give John a through but gentle kiss which was returned just as enthusiastically.
?" Sherlock asked and John snorted, ignoring him. When John pushed open the bedroom door he could’ve cried, he was a man who couldn’t stand mess thanks to his army days and Sherlock was the exact opposite if the scarf and coat lying on the floor by the bed was any kind of clue. It drove John extra bloody mad now that he was pregnant too but despite the constant reminders to his husband to pick up his shit it still always found its way to the bedroom floor, didn’t matter what it was Sherlock had in his hands, it all ended up dumped for John to pick up later. John suspected Sherlock was normally aiming for the bed but that was no comfort to him when he was picking up a soaking wet towel from Sherlock’s morning shower.
, John. There will be a human being in the world with all my genius and your unyielding heart, a human being that will be a blend of the best of us both and that is more precious to me than any case, experiment or drug could ever be. Understand?"
must've happened to his father but it was clear there was nothing truly interesting here, just some delusion dreamt up by a child that had stuck his brain and carried on into adulthood.
"Are you alright?" Sherlock asked tiredly, raising his head to look at John now he had retained his rational mind in a momentarily release from his violent instincts. John’s head lolled back lazily so he could look up at his new mate in awe.
Sherlock’s mind was completely ruled by domineering Alpha now and there was nothing that could make him stop... or that's what he thought anyway but then he wasn't expecting the little cry John gave when his left shoulder came into contact with the wooden frame and the now palpable stink of fear in the air. The loud growl that had been tearing through the air from Sherlock stopped and his eyes that had dilated to black cleared, he jumped back fiercely and John gave a sigh of relief.
.’ of course that would be the moment that Fletcher pulled out a giant, concrete cast of a dogs paw and flashed it off. The young Alpha smirked at the look on Sherlock’s face and John pounced on this opportunity.
"Stop it!" He pressed John harder against the wood, snarling in John’s face and sinking his fingers into John’s shoulder. The smaller man whimpered in pain and pressed his chin to his chest, breaking any eye contact and hiding his neck to avoid further angering the furious Alpha. Sherlock didn’t seem to care though, the display only made him angrier and he pulled John forward to slam him back against the jam.
"Well John don't just sit there, answer the door." John groaned and jumped up, this was going to be a long day, he could tell.
"Why do you assume I’m asking for something? Perhaps I’m just concerned about my big brothers welfare." Sherlock pouted and leaned against the 4x4 as both John and Mycroft collectively snorted.
." John winced slightly at the harsh tone, which Sherlock noticed and was about to comment on but John interrupted him.
to comfort John when he was miserable, hence the twisty, crampy stomach. Sherlock glanced out the corner of his eye when John’s head swivelled back from the window to look straight ahead, Sherlock desperately wanted to say something to the man and cheer him up but not only could he not think of anything, he didn’t want to say something and encourage any ‘
"Should’ve known, you’d know… How do you know that by the way?" John pouted and Sherlock grinned at him.
Almost as if sensing she was being scrutinised, his daughter gave a grumble and opened her eyes to see who would dare disturb her slumber, Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat when he saw John’s eyes staring up at him. Of course she would have John’s eyes, it was the only possibility that made any sense given the ratio of her facial structure but still, it was a lovely surprise to see. The baby in arms must have been very confused and unnerved by his staring and sombre expression because she started to whimper and sensing that she was about let out an ear piercing screech that could potentially wake up John, Sherlock decided to follow his instincts and repositioned her so her head was on his shoulder to give her full access to his scent, with one hand holding her to him and the other stroking her back as he rocked her back and forth making shushing noises to soothe her.
"No. It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John. Its whole body was glowing." Sherlock shuddered, shook his head and turned to walk towards the car with John trailing after him.
Another possessive growl escaped Sherlock's throat and he cursed his stupid biology, this was another reason he hated Mycroft, why did that tubby arse get to be a Beta whilst Sherlock was born Alpha. Uh! He hated everything... except John, John was nice. Whether he was in heat or not, perhaps Sherlock should tell him that sometime, it might make him happy.
"Gosh! His symptoms are moving at some ruddy speed ain’t they?" Billy exclaimed from the door, Sherlock looked over at him surprised that he was still here; well he had a great opportunity and like John says ‘
The tour though Baskerville was pretty much uneventful and boring really, well at least Sherlock solved the case of Bluebell the missing rabbit and he got to wind up Mycroft which was always a definite plus. Sherlock did almost lose his cool though when Major Barrymore had started throwing his weight around, he supposed it was a good thing Dr. Frankland had appeared when he did, now if only he could get rid of the annoying old man.
"Mean anything to you?" He asked gesturing to the words written in his notepad, Sherlock looked as if he wanted to say something else but held his tongue, sticking to the case.
"Yeah, pretty much. Listen it's going to take us a while to get packed so you should listen to Sherlock and just head off now, we'll nip in later when we arrive and get settled in Dartmoor. I'll see you out." John confirmed and Henry nodded and made his way to the door followed closely by John.
John for his part was blown away, there was no way Sherlock was saying what he thought Sherlock was saying, all the same though, he slowly made his way back over to Sherlock and tilted his head to the side, contemplating for a brief second.
“Really Mycroft? Who am I supposed to be? James Bond?” Sherlock asked incredulously when he caught sight of the silver sports car. Mycroft gave a haughty chuckle and came to stand behind his brother.
"Vaguely. It's all very hush hush." John decided and nervously tapped his pen against the pad he was writing on, Sherlock asking about a top secret military army base was bound to make anyone nervous after all.
"It’s not specific to this place. It’s my brothers. Access all areas. I um-" Sherlock cleared his throat. "Acquired it ages ago, just in case." John shook his head and correctly translated it as ‘
"You were expecting us?" Sherlock asked suspiciously and the Omega flicked his gaze between him and John.
John was deep in thought as he climbed the stairs back up into the flat, ever since he had moved in to 221B, Sherlock had told him he didn't want to know anything about his '
"No way!" He choked and then stuffed his hand into the bag to pull out what was inside and... He grinned like a kid at Christmas; it was a miniature version of Sherlock’s blue scarf. So whilst he got crap for showing Sherlock a jumper, his husband was off buying mini versions of his own wardrobe was he? All the same, it was bloody adorable.
After getting cleaned up and wiping down his harpoon, Sherlock came striding back into the living room and started his pacing up and down routine again, a routine that had become a very common sight in the past weeks. John sighed and kept reading his paper, thinking that if he focused enough on the words in front of him then he might just manage to get through the impending tantrum.
"MINE!" He snarled and drove his face between the cheeks of John’s arse to lick and suck and nip and the Omega’s dripping hole, growling in pleasure all the while and causing vibrations to travel through John’s entrance making him yell.
"Go after her and apologise." John ordered but Sherlock just looked up at John like he'd just grown an extra head.
"I am." He stated matter of fact and got in, John nearly had a heart attack when the engine started up and jump into the passenger’s side, leaning over and turning off the ignition.
"Obviously. Suppose they just couldn’t bring themselves to do it." John answered before tucking in to his breakfast and Sherlock nodded and made a face of false understanding.
"Yeah! I know! Think I read it in a fortune cookie once." That just set them both off even more; John stood and pulled a giggling Henry with him, then he turned to Sherlock, cheeks flushed and a huge grin on his face.
"Grab that map and those binoculars; you’ll need them." Then he was out of the car and climbing up the largest rock to get a look around, leaving John sitting for a moment wondering what just happened. The truth was John wasn’t the only one uncomfortable with the silence, Sherlock was demented with it, don’t misread the situation though; he did like quiet, it let him think uninterrupted but after what happened... Sherlock was feeling a little
"John..." The man just cut him off and strode forward to warp his arms around Sherlock and buried his head in the man’s coat.
Hi folks, been a while right ^^' yeah sorry about that but stuffs been going on and times been an issue but look I'm back and stuff :D
"That’s Grimpen Village." John said and again pointing behind him, making Sherlock’s gaze shift again and then John glanced back to the map.
"Yeah, well I fancied another one." And in that one sentence not only had he confirmed Sherlock’s deduction but also the tone of voice the man used, gave Sherlock the reason for his sudden appearance.
"No, no, no, your exact words, repeat you exact words form a moment ago, exactly as you said them." Sherlock said impatiently.
“Fine, but be quick about it.” Molly gave another one of her heavily animated nods just before the doors opened in the lift when they arrived at the maternity ward and then led Sherlock to the private rooms at the back of the ward, making sure to lead him around the main desk so as not to be seen. It wasn’t until they reached the door of the room with ‘
"What did you see?" Sherlock asked bored and Henry shifted nervous of the Alpha speaking to him, God what was it about Omegas and nervousness? Molly was the same and it irritated Sherlock to no end, this was why he never bothered with them, honestly who would want a simpering pile of submissive boredom catering to there every whim without question or challenge? John was Omega and
When John started walking away looking like a kicked puppy, Sherlock’s instinct to go over and comfort the Omega, to wrap him in his arms and lick at his neck soothingly was overwhelming so he had pulled his scarf up over his face and breathed in deep the lingering scent of John, the urge disappeared and had smirked to himself and pulled out a can of air freshener he had snatched from behind the bar, to get rid of any lingering stink of sex from the car.
. Sherlock wrapped his legs tight around John’s hips and flipped them over so he was stradling John again and started to bounce fast hard on John’s cock. The doctor let out a beautiful sound that was a cross between a screech and a yelp, it was glorious! When Sherlock started rolling his hips as he bounced John lost whatever reservation he had left and shot up off the bed grabbing on to Sherlock hard and slamming his hips up against Sherlock’s bouncing arse, Sherlock was sure that if he angled his hips just right then John would...
"No, not until we need nappies and baby food. Do you want to see what I got?" Sherlock looked horrified.
It was big! 7" if John’s calculations were correct, that meant 11.5" during a heat including a knot. John stroked up and down the gorgeous length so he could admire it a bit longer, then just lunged forward and swallowed it down in one, Sherlock howled and shoved a hand in the back of John’s hair pressing the Omega down and choking him. It wasn’t the first time this’d happened to him so he’d built up a bit of a resistance to it, it seemed to be an Alpha kink; even female Alphas did it, in a manner of speaking since they
"This is, uh... are you, um... rich?" John stuttered and Henry glanced around dispassionately at his lodgings.
him" Sherlock snarled and was about to take off down the corridor the man had just left from but John launched himself at Sherlock, knocking him through the door of the closed dining room where they had sat the night before. Quickly before Sherlock had time to recover, John turned and slammed the door shut behind him, standing in front of it, arms spread wide.
“Love you too.” Sherlock replied to his unconscious mate and leaned in to kiss him gently on the lips before finally getting up and leaving the room as quietly as possible so as not to disturb John and Charlotte again.
John grunted when the pressure that had been building in his abdomen released itself and he came for the first time that night, come shooting from his cock and a gush of juices from his arse shot against Sherlock’s face, Soaking his lips and pouring down his chin to drip down his chest to the covers. Sherlock pulled back when John dropped face first to the bed twitching, he licked across his lips like a great big cat and crawled up over John, his leaking cock dragging a wet line along his spine, before flipping him over on to his back.
"Thank you." He nodded and trotted back over to the kiosk he was stationed at to verify the ID, John gave him a look and Sherlock smiled inside.
"Putting the bags in the car, John. Really I thought that was obvious." He drawled smugly and John narrowed his eyes and gabbed his finger towards the detective.
"That'll be him home then." John mumbled to himself and flicked the page of the paper he was reading, ignoring Sherlock when he strode in and thumped the harpoon on the floor.
"Ta. I’ll just get your change." Gary chirped and turned back to the till, as he waited John glanced down at a pile of receipts on the counter distractedly, he frowned when he noticed there was one for a large order of meat, far too much for a vegetarian restaurant. John looked up to make sure Gary was still distracted, then he quickly tore the receipt from the pin it was under and stuffed it in his pocket. When Gary turned to give him his change, he smiled and started making small talk, Sherlock strode back into view just as Gary had walked around the bar to stand close to John.
"Yeah. I’ve seen it. Only about a month ago, up at the Hollow. It was foggy, mind - couldn’t make much out" Fletcher bragged as he flicked through the photos on his phone and Sherlock scoffed, glad for something to focus on instead of the delicious scent in the air. He really
"Sherlock before we go downstairs I’d like to sort out these bites and scratches and have a shower, I feel bloody disgusting." Sherlock who had just got to his feet growled at John but conceded, he too needed a shower, he was certain there was come in the back of his hair. He was mollified somewhat when John grinned at him and gave him a kiss before he bounded off back to the destroyed bathroom followed by an unusually happy Sherlock and why shouldn’t he be happy?
"Yes Sherlock.... anything you say, I’ll do anything just don’t stop!" John’s eyes where clenched shut at the pleasure he was experiencing but it wasn’t enough, he needed that knot, his heat demanded it. John waited until Sherlock drew back before thrusting back in and pushed hard so he could flip Sherlock on his back and ride him. Sherlock obviously wasn’t expecting John to do something so dominant like that so naturally it pissed the big Alpha off but just as he was about to snarl and push John off he caught sight of his cock disappearing into John’s arse over and over again and instead ended up grabbing John’s hips to help him along, thrusting upwards against every one of John’s downward thrusts. John’s head fell forward as he bounced up on down on the Alpha beneath him who was hitting his spot with every thrust at this point and Sherlock wished he could see John’s face but the man was facing away from him.
"Really? You really believe that?" Henry sniffed loudly, his spirit elevating at the kind words and John nodded encouragingly and then had a silly thought that he knew would cheer the other Omega up.
’ whilst he clutched John protectively and ushered them both inside the taxi. Once the cabbie started driving however, Sherlock abandoned his enthusiasm to accompany John and swapped it for a whole novels worth of bitching. By the time they had arrived at the surgery John suspected the
“You know it’s a terrible thing, I’ve been in here with you nearly an hour and I don’t even know your name.” Sherlock whispered to her as he laid his sleeping daughter back down into the warm comfort of her blankets, a little snore that made Sherlock smile was his only answer. Once he was sure his daughter was settled into her temporary bed he checked the name on the side.
"Henry, it’s time to take you home." John coxed gently but Henry didn’t look at him, his eyes were still locked on the minefield.
would think. The annoying woman was completely charmed with his lovely little John, and really who could blame her, John was, as ever, the charming, sweet, funny man he was, not to mention his smile could light up a room and he smelled
"But I already do smell a change in your scent." John’s eyes widened, there was no way Sherlock could detect something like that this early, then again Sherlock didn’t know much about bonds so maybe that’s just what he
"No, wait. What happened last night ... Something happened to me; something I’ve not really experienced before …" John scoffed, if last night was all Sherlock was going to explain himself for then John didn’t want to know.
Sherlock padded over softly and slowly climbed in the bed, easing his body under the sheets and sighing at the warmth radiating off of John’s body. Hm.
!" John shouted when he realized what it was, it was his packet of birth control! He hadn’t taken any since... oh God!
"What is-" Sherlock started when he strode into the bedroom but froze when he saw what John had clutched in his hand.
After a moment of trying to get their breath back, Sherlock shifted them so they were on their sides and pushed one arm beneath John’s head as a makeshift pillow while the other slid over to stroke John’s stomach in a soothing gesture.
"It’s just, we don’t get inspected here, sir, it just doesn't happen." and Sherlock didn’t know what to say to that, lucky for him, John did.
' but unwilling to move first lest he challenge Sherlock again. Sensing his friend didn’t want to talk about this and feeling the same way himself, Sherlock just nodded and strode towards the door to ring the doorbell. He heard John shuffle up next to him but didn’t look over, he didn't know if he could look at him right now without choking on his Shame. They only had to wait a few moments before the door swung open to reveal Henry who smiled at them in welcome, noticing the tension in the air though he let his smile drop and glance between John and Sherlock curiously.
"Maybe we should just look for whoever’s got a big dog." John huffed in the end and that’s when Sherlock finally spoke.
"Listen; what happened to me at the lab?" John asked and Sherlock gave him an odd look before turning to grab a basket of sauces, trying to figure out a way how to explain that to his mate without it ending in him being neutered.
"Too bad. Did you get any information?" John smiled a little and glanced over his shoulder but kept walking.
"Mr. Watson-Holmes?" John and Sherlock both looked up at the small, plump woman who stuck her head into the door of the waiting room.
"It wasn’t easy watching it either." Sherlock mumbled and John lifted his knife threateningly towards him, Sherlock put his hands up in defence and continued to explain.
John calmed down after a few minutes but he didn’t raise his eyes up to Sherlock’s, instead he just cleared his throat, his walls coming down to protect himself.
"Mm. I don’t take sugar..." Sherlock pulled the kicked puppy face again and John relented and continued drinking.
"Sherlock!" John called out angrily and took back what he thought earlier, how Sherlock could be a good and thoughtful provider when he acted like such a child if he didn't get his way was just a ridiculous thought.
, he’d have to try and be good more often if this was what he got in return. Sherlock nodded and John gave him one last kiss before bouncing off to get a shopping basket, Sherlock breathed for a moment and then proceeded to lift the bags at his feet and head for the door, his instincts were already screaming ‘
Sherlock did as he was instructed and drove straight through to the main building and parked as close as possible so there wouldn’t be much of a walk, or run as the case may be, to the car. Once certain that the car was parked in a permitted space he and John jumped out to proceed into the main building, John still grumbling about getting shot. Hm. Paranoia, however justified in this case, was another sign of heat, perhaps John was closer to heat than either of them thought, Sherlock hoped not, it wouldn’t do for John to start lubricating in the middle of Baskerville; every unbonded Alpha within a mile radius would tackle him. Bad train of thought, Sherlock scolded himself and barely managed to stifle the growl threatening to escape his lips, he discreetly dropped his head to sniff at his scarf again and push away the possessive thoughts. God, this was getting ridiculous now.
." Moriarty drawled and snapped his fingers as he exited the pool, the red dots that danced along John and Sherlock’s bodys vanished and the both gave an audible sigh of relief.
"No, I said it would rein in my hormones." John ducked his head apologetically, he supposed he hadn’t been very clear about that.
"Stay." The Omega purred, eyes half-lidded and Sherlock swallowed, he wanted to but he had to get them a towel to dry off and he had to do something, anything lest he accost John’s body before it was fully ready for him, he still had to wait for the scent change and lubricant to start forming.
"Good Morning." Sherlock whispered and dipped his head to rub his nose with John’s; the smaller man smiled up at him and shifted his head so he could kiss his mate softly on the lips. Sherlock returned the kiss and not for the first time asked himself,
"I wonder what set my heat off like that anyway. I haven’t had one like that since I’d just returned from Afghanistan and that was because I was having panic attacks. I wasn’t especially upset the other night... well I was angry about what happened but not distressed in any way so..."
"Where are you?" He really didn’t want to ask since he knew when John was anyway but he had to if he wanted to keep this a secret form John.
"You’ve never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable. Some people who aren’t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others." John scoffed and rolled his eyes to the sky, yeah, Sherlock was back to his old self, he supposed it should be nice but he hadn’t made up his mind on that yet, he thought on it as he and Sherlock stopped in front of the pub.
"Nice touch." Sherlock complimented when they were inside Baskerville and he had calmed down somewhat, he saw John blush out the corner of his eye.
"Henry." John said again and slid his free hand up to cup the side of traumatised man’s face, this startled Henry out of his fog and he looked at John, tears gathering and falling from his eyes then dropped his gaze again.
sink their teeth in and claim him as their own but when Sherlock’s teeth had gripped at that tender skin below his hair it was...
"I thought that the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee and then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore. It was all
"That’s nice. That’s good." John lied and winced again when he took another sip before turning to place it on the mantel behind him, Sherlock watched him like a hawk, and in truth he was a little surprised that John had taken a second sip regardless of Sherlock’s facial expression but then again this was John and John would do almost anything to please him. It made Sherlock feel a little bit guilty about drugging John with tainted sugar but he had to know if his theory was correct.
Sherlock released the back of John’s head so the man could pull back once he had finished and John climbed up into his lap to place kisses and licks all around Sherlock’s face and neck whilst running his hands through ebony curls.
"I’ve told you; I’m on holiday." Lestrade insisted and Sherlock lost with little patience he had with the other Alpha.
. It really was a wonderful surprise to wake up to; Mycroft had even provided them with a pair of beautiful wedding bands as a gift and stood in with a still twitchy Lestrade as witnesses to their union.
"I’m. Sorry." He gritted out between clenched teeth and John smiled, he’d heard him the first time, he was just enjoying the rarity of Sherlock apologising to him.
shop. Sherlock Watson-Holmes was now surrounded with baby grows, stuffed animals, cribs and this was just
"Myself." He whispered miserably and it was true, he should be pissed off at himself for giving in to his base instincts again. John couldn’t control his body when he was on his heat but Sherlock absolutely refused to believe that same went for him. He glanced down at John who had strode over to stand at the base of the rock and was reading the map.
"Yes!" Sherlock moaned against John’s lips and started pushing John towards the wall by the side of the kitchen until he was pressed against it, he almost fainted when John’s tongue slid across his bottom lip, instead his eyes rolled back in pleasure and he opened his mouth to welcome John inside. If Sherlock didn’t believe in heaven before, he does now, John tasted amazing, sweet and smokey all at once and Sherlock would never smoke again because he had John and John tasted better than any cigarette ever could. Saliva was starting to slide down the corners of their mouths as their tongues stroked and swirled around each other and breathing was becoming an issue, he didn’t want to pull back but he didn’t want to suffocate John either so he did pull away but only enough to rest his forehead against the doctors.
"Don’t be silly, as long as you pay for the extra night’s I’ll be a happy man. My brother’ll fix up the room for free anyway and as I said this isn’t the first time this has happened. Now can I get you boys some breakfast?" He said clapping his hands together and rubbing them, grinning the whole time. John was going to protest not paying for the damages but Sherlock sensing his mate was going to make them poor for a while jumped in.
, the pleasure he’d felt from that pressure against his nape was like nothing he’d ever felt before and this was all just so bloody confusing! He supposed a reason he trusted Sherlock not to bite was because he knew the man but then again he’d
"Oh!" John cried and wrapped his arms tight around Sherlock’s waist when the man started up a quick and hard rhythm, hands stroked up and over skin and grabbed at clothing, lips brushed and sucked bruises on pale skin, and nails tore at a tan neck leaving long red marks. It wasn’t long before both of them were on the verge of climax, that was until Sherlock stopped and pulled off.
The panic Sherlock had been feeling since the Hollow only seemed to increase and he sank down to the floor at the bottom of the bed beside his and John’s bags and started breathing heavily, manic thoughts running through his mind.
’ that’s how it works and you were already in pre-heat so the drug must have interacted with your hormonal changes causing your adrenaline levels to rise and giving you a bout of unconscious distress that lead to a rapid heat. Simple." John pouted again, it wasn’t simple to him. Shrugging he went back to raking around for his toiletries bag; it had some salves and pain killers in it. He heard some shuffling behind him and saw Sherlock from his peripheral vision rearranging himself so he was sitting up with his back to the wall, sheets pooling at his waist exposing creamy skin that was littered with marks of all description, it was very distracting.
"Look all you have to do is keep quiet for five more minutes whilst he writes me a prescription and books me a scan date and then we can leave." John soothed and Sherlock nodded.
The tired Omega placed the bags of baby things in the closet by their bed and then proceeded to kneel down to pick up Sherlock’s mess, however when John moved Sherlock’s coat out of the way his eyes caught sight of a small green bag sticking out from beneath the bed... A bag from the baby shop? For a moment John thought he had dropped one but then snorted, this bag was way too small for any of the things he had bought today which could only mean... John’s eyes widened.
just pissed Sherlock off and he sat down moodily, glaring at the back of the other Alpha’s head, he composed himself enough to force a smile on his face.
' to get cleaned up, almost everyone's nose twitched and their eyes looked towards him, everyone including Fletcher who had migrated into the pub for a beer. Sherlock did take a little pleasure in the glare the little sod had sent his way but it was mostly overshadowed by the embarrassment he felt, if everyone could smell him, then everyone knew he’d lost control, surrendered his intelligence to the primal mind and that was the worst thing that could ever happen to him,
"I don’t think no’s and option right now John." Sherlock husked and ground his erection forward into John’s soft Jumper, all the while moaning like a porn star, John swallowed and felt a twitch under his trousers. Sherlock must’ve felt something too, if the smug look on his face was anything to go by, the consulting detective started pressing his arse back into John’s crotch and rolling his hips slowly against the man,firming John's arousal, John who started panting and whose arms had uncrossed so he could reach down to stop Sherlock’s gyrations.
the sugar." John said after swallowing, Sherlock knew what he was trying to and it wasn’t going to happen so he defended himself.
"Of course I can bloody drive!" Sherlock countered climbing back out after the Doctor and striding around to reach over and retrieve his keys but John twisted to the side to avoid the hand.
"Get me some." He snarled again but John held his ground and in fact made a counter argument against the Alpha’s demand, making Sherlock have to work just that little bit harder to supress his instinct to dominate.
Half an hour later and the silence was deafening. John and Sherlock had avoided eye contact so far and apart from the occasional sigh or cough, hadn't made any sound. John wasn’t sure how much more he could take so when he saw buildings in the distance he did an internal happy dance, it wouldn’t be long now and then they could get back to being the consulting detective and his blogger.
"Don’t be strangers... and remember, stay away from the moor at night if you value your lives." The man called and John licked his lips. Sherlock could feel the growl starting to build in his throat but he absolutely refused to lose control again, it had happened way too often today, instead he swallowed down the possessive sound and pulled up his coat collar. Sherlock almost glowed with happiness when the movement drew John’s attention back to him and not the little piss ant Alpha, except that John was looking at him funny.
When Sherlock came to, it was to the sensation of John’s tongue licking his stomach clean of sweat and come and warm hand stroking his thighs, he hummed happily and lifted a heavy hand to stroke through John’s sweat soaked hair, John tipped his head up and rested his chin on Sherlocks hip, smiling up at the detective.
"I don’t do that." He said eventually as he opened the driver’s side door and just before John shut his he called out.
"It's my heat Sherlock!" Sherlock's eyes went wide in shock at John’s exclamation and dove over the bed so it was firmly between him and the Doctor, John would’ve laughed if it wasn't so insulting.
"Always rely on John to send me the relevant data, as he never understands a word of it himself." Sherlock smirked and nearly rubbed his hands together in glee as John started to panic and get defensive.
"No, no don’t apologize. I’ve went a bit mad today, I know you don’t like the Doctors or shopping let alone this kind of shopping. We can just go home now, besides it’s probably too early to buy anything like this and I need to get dinner on anyway." John smiled at him but it was more reserved and less bright than the other smiles Sherlock had gotten used to over the last six weeks and he felt so very guilty for taking such a simple pleasure away from his little love, John shouldn’t have to be so apologetic about this, this was exactly the sort of thing normal couples did, in fact Sherlock could see many couples in this shop right now cooing over the miniature clothes, toys, cribs and all the other baby things. It was just instinct for expecting Omegas to start providing for their child before birth, it was called
"John - bed - NOW!" Sherlock growled  in between kisses and then shoved John hard so he landed on the bed amongst the pillows, the doctor grunted from the force and from Sherlock grabbing hold of his boxers and pulling the right off with his trousers, the pair went flying through the air shortly followed by Sherlock’s and who knows when they landed because Sherlock only had eyes for John’s gorgeous body. The doctor was perfect from the spidery bullet wound on his left shoulder to the soles of his feet and Sherlock had to reach down and wrap a hand around the base of his cock to stop himself coming, it didn’t stop the moisture dripping off the tip and on to John’s belly when he straddled the man though.
"So that’s what it feels like." Sherlock huffed a laugh at himself, just before he walked out the door he saw something blue from the corner of his eye and turned to look, Sherlock smiled when he realized what it was that had caught his eye and he just couldn’t resist picking it up, he was positive he had enough money in his wallet to buy this and still get a cab home so he weaved his way through the aisles, watching out for his husband so he wouldn’t see him, after all John wouldn’t let him live this down. He would play it cool and plant the item in one of the many bags John was sure to stumble in with later, his mate would just assume that he had bought it and wouldn’t suspect a thing. Genius!
"What now, then?" The posh man asked nervously and John honestly didn’t know, with all that had been going on today he hadn’t really been paying attention to the case, he supposed he should feel bad about that but... well. He did remember Sherlock saying something about a plan when they were talking to Fletcher though so he’d go with that.
’ grave and begged him not to be dead, to come home to him and their unborn child that almost broke him.
’. He knew he’d hurt the man, John’s face had said it all and his eyes dulled as he turned to look out the window, Sherlock didn’t like it, it made his stomach all twisty and crampy but he didn’t know what to do or say, his whole world view had just shifted and all because of one primal, instinctual act, even if he had now found a way to control it, however unconventional it may be.
"Ah! You'll come down then?" The young man asked excited and Sherlock felt like having a little bit of fun with his blogger and finally getting to the bottom of his earlier desperation.
"Nothing on the website?" He asked tersely and Sherlock jumped up to show him the adorable e-mail he'd gotten from little Kristy about poor missing Bluebell the rabbit, John was so caught up in reading the cute plea for help that he didn't really hear everything that Sherlock was saying.
John smiled when he caught sight of ‘The Cross Keys’, he wanted to find out of Sherlock had deduced anything yet from their little outing, usually the man would’ve started rattling off ideas as soon as he had seen what he had to see but the Alpha had been in a bit of an odd mood when John caught up to him and Henry and he just took off in the direction of the pub. John just assumed he was thinking hard and needed some peace.
"Twenty year old disappearance? A monstrous hound? I wouldn't miss this for the world." He confirmed and then strode back out of the room quickly. John stood gaping at the door, he'd been had, now Sherlock knew he'd have to think up a new hiding place for the cigarettes, one that John wouldn't find so easily. Not to mention, bloody
"It’s not true, is it? You haven’t actually seen this... Hound thing." He grinned in a friendly manner and Fletcher turned to regard at the other him suspiciously.
"It was just a joke, y’know?" Oddly enough the DI failed to see the funny side and stood up looking down at the pair angrily.
"Oh Yeah? Then where's your licence?" John prodded and Sherlock pulled back and looked away, clearing his throat.
Sherlock realized in that moment that yes, the Alpha who got John would be lucky and the thought that the Alpha might not be him...
"Oooh Oooh!" Mrs. Hudson called as she walked in, Sherlock ignored her greeting and just got straight to the point.
"Is there an Alpha back in London?" Sherlock asked softly still too relaxed from his Omega’s closeness and the soft huffs of breath against his skin to sound demanding but was pleased when John shook his head against the detective’s neck.
"How? Can’t pull off the ID trick again." John asked, Sherlock smirked at him and hit dial before lifting the phone to his ear.
John groaned and snuffled into his pillow when he heard the high pitched chime coming from his phone, for a moment he contemplated just ignoring it and going back to sleep but after some considerable time thinking about it, decided against that option since it hadn’t paid off for him thus far in life so he reached over blindly and grabbed his mobile off of the bedside table. It took another moment before the lazy Omega bothered to open his eyes and lift his head from where he’d buried it in the pillow to read the text that woke him up.
"U.M.Q.R.A. Does that mean... anything...?" That was when John noticed something wasn’t right, Sherlock hadn’t said a word and he was all twitchy and breathing deep, John just kept going though in an effort to bring Sherlock out of whatever crazy he’d sank into now.
John could taste himself on Sherlock, blood and his juices mixing to give a heady musky taste over Sherlock’s spicy one and his eyes rolled back into his head. He reached up and pulled hard on Sherlock’s hair to tilt his head to side deepening the kiss and causing all the blood, lube and saliva to run down their chins. As the kiss got more and more passionate John raised his other hand up and drew his nails down Sherlock’s chest so five deep bloody scratches formed all the way down the Alpha’s abdomen until he reached his pelvis where he gripped Sherlock’s cock,
Sherlock abandoned his study of the room to turn over towards the pillow cushioned wall that John was snuggled against beneath heaps of blankets. The little Omega was battered, bruised and still bleeding sluggishly from some of the bites and scratches littering his body but he was smiling and purring gently in his sleep. Sherlock couldn’t hold back the little smile that bubbled to the surface and curled himself around John, nuzzling the soft tufts of hair that were stuck up in all directions, the movements disturbed the Omega and a little whine was voiced followed by two sleepy blue eyes opening to gaze up at Sherlock.
would you feel to know that as soon as my heat begins, you will be able to sink your teeth deep into my neck and press yourself deep inside me, lock us together so that no one but you will ever,
"Yes, you said: fear. Sherlock Holmes got scared. You said." Sherlock couldn’t take the mocking tone John used thought he suspected he deserved it, he grabbed John’s arm gently and pulled him around to face him, tried to explain the feeling of terror when you think your own senses are betraying you but John just brushed him off and started walking off again. That’s was when words found their way back to Sherlock’s brain, when in that moment he thought John was walking away from him for good.
"Nothing?" Sherlock asked and John knew immediately what he was asking, of course Sherlock would assume that the reason John was reading the paper was to look for possible cases for Sherlock and not just because John wanted to read the paper, still, John started flicking through the papers for anything interesting for the detective.
"A bit. It won’t happen again." This seemed to mollify John but then a worried expression crossed his face and he gestured to his abdomen.
locked me in that bloody lab." Sherlock caved and thought it would be best to tell the truth at this point.
but he wasn't important, only John was and Sherlock preened under the impressed gaze. The idiot sitting across from him must have assumed Sherlock's pleased air was due to his own appraising stare and tilted his head instinctively to show his clean neck, devoid of a bonding bite. Sherlock just rolled his eyes again.
"What are you talking about, you’re busy? You don't have a case! A minute ago you were complaining-" John started frantically, he really didn't want to have to run down to bloody Devon all on his own, especially with a heat so close but Sherlock interrupted him smugly.
." John said flatly and Sherlock rushed over to pull the sheet from the cage and slide it open, when the lights blinked on John looked absolutely terrified and the smell of his fear was making Sherlock both angry and sick at the same time. He had done this, he had made John like this even if he had managed to prove his theory it was not worth the look on John’s face or the pallor of his skin.
"Just go straight up those stairs and take the first left, Dr. Watson. You’ll come out into a sitting room that’s used for meetings." John nodded absentmindedly to the palace attendee, too busy looking around to properly thank her and began slowly ascending the stairs. He was inside Buckingham Palace. Bloody
." Sherlock groaned when John bottomed out, John held him still  for a moment to let Sherlock get comfortable, then started rolling his hips up making Sherlock’s vision flicker. The detectives arms rose again to settle on the back of the couch at John’s shoulders and he pushed himself up and dropped back down again, hard.
"Damn! I must’ve left my things in the bathroom." John cursed and went to retrieve them but he stopped in front of the door, Sherlock yawned and looked up at him curiously.
true but John still needed to seek out another physician for his medical care throughout the pregnancy and
"Mm-yes- and we should-make good- on that-" John said in between little pecks to Sherlock’s lips, they shared one last deep kiss and then Sherlock pulled away completely to get into the driver’s seat.
"I didn’t tell you because the cramps started after our fight last night and I was planning to go back to London this morning and deal with my heat back home." John confessed quietly against the saliva damp skin of the other man’s neck and once again Sherlock’s hold tightened around John.
Sherlock? An Alpha who would sink his teeth into John’s soft neck and bond with him? An Alpha who would take John away from him...
Sherlock had a moment just before he paid for the little thing where he felt completely ridiculous doing such a boring task as buying baby things but then he looked down at the blue item in his hand and he smirked at the thought dancing through his head.
, I promise I’ll be quiet." Sherlock coerced and leaned forward to peck John’s lips and cheeks sensually. John tried to resist, he
"Aye! Billy’ll bring your meal out to you." He said and John scarpered out before Sherlock could somehow con him into paying for everything again. There were only two free benches left and John headed over to the one furthest away from the pub to wait for his meal, he didn’t have to wait long though, Billy came out after a few minutes with his plate and a glass of orange juice to place in front of the ravenous doctor.
He spent most of his morning driving but stopped back at that rock formation he and John had been around at the start of their trip, he mimicked his pose atop it again and stared into Baskerville, he’d have to think up a way of getting back in there so he could test his theory about the bloody sugar, perhaps, just this once mind, he could lower himself to call...
"No. That’s not right, is it?" Sherlock asked aloud his growl disappearing, he had been rotten to John all day, had been
it is! One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to ... to spy on me incognito. Is that why you’re calling yourself
." John managed to march a little further in front of Sherlock who was only just managing to keep his tongue in his mouth.
"... and see if anything attacks you." He finished and John’s looked at him like he was crazy, which if he was honest probably wouldn’t be far off the mark with the way Sherlock had been acting today, the bruises he could feel on his shoulders gave a throb at the thought.
"What’s up with you all of a sudden?" Sherlock, who had just started the car, sighed and turned off the ignition.
?" John shook his head, this man could be absolutely terrible sometimes; pity the man in question didn’t really care.
Reassuringly, John’s bag was still there sitting next to Sherlock’s at the bottom of the big bed and why the hell was there only
"No, I wouldn’t." John wisely chose that moment to stroll past Sherlock to distract him after getting the sense that the man was about to say something really rude. Lestrade pulled off his sunglasses and followed John’s movements with his eyes, something Sherlock didn’t like, not one bit; he narrowed his eyes as they exchanged greetings.
