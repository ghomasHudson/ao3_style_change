No. John told him he loved him and John wouldn't lie to him, not his John. A child, forced on John by a jealous wife and a private detective with criminal tendencies wouldn't be able to force their family, their pack, apart.
“Hmm. No one sleepwalking down there,” John purred into Sherlock's ear as his fingers closed around him. The detective's head fell back against John's shoulder.
“I presume there is no body, yet?” Sherlock opened the glove box. A business card caught his attention and he turned it around. When Lestrade wasn't looking he put it into the pocket of his coat.
Sherlock didn’t even look at her, just waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. She chuckled and walked away.
They went to the stores and picked up groceries for once and because Mrs Turner’s family was over for a visit, Sherlock let Leanna play with the kids.
“This is your heart, love. I'm in your heart.” John took a step to stand beside him, to watch over the city as Sherlock did. “We met somewhere down there, you and I. All because Leanna had a fever and you were so worried about her. Your braveness to leave your wife was the best thing that could have happened to us.”
John saw the Good Samaritan relax in front of the obvious ease of Leanna with the alpha, “Have a good day mister.”
“An Italian restaurant! Oh my god Sherlock, when you want to do something romantic you don’t do it in half measure!” This time John’s exclamation was enthusiastic. Trust Sherlock to be really thorough when he went to do something.
“She prefers to be alone right now. I will stay at Holmes Manor as long as she needs my presence. You should go home and see your child.
“Alright. I will be careful. I already ask to work part-time. And I have lots of vacation time to take if I feel tired, I will use it.” Sarah answered.
“Sherlock…” He croaked, pleading Sherlock to come closer with his eyes, his voice just couldn’t work right now.
“Irrelevant! Simple deduction. Now my daughter, she is what’s important.” The little girl, in his arms, was just beginning to have difficulty breathing.
“This week, an important bill will be introduced to parliament and I know it will pass. Neither my brother nor the press know yet and I think you should use the time left. I know you have thought about asking Sherlock before.”
“Not really no… It's been a year since I came back from the front, I'm not going to physiotherapy anymore, it should be getting better. Don't you think it should be getting better?" John couldn’t help feeling even more inadequate because of his limping. After passing all the exams I could possibly think about, he had been forced to accept that the pain in his leg was psychosomatic… He was a doctor; he knew it has nothing to do with willpower, so why did he feel so ashamed?
Greg's hand squeezed back as his eyelids fluttered, and Mycroft found himself staring into those warm brown eyes that he had thought he would never see again. He let out a relived laugh. "Hey," he said.
Jim paused, allowing three seconds for questions if anyone decided to be an idiot. Luckily, no one did. "Excellent." he said, grinning wider than ever. He practically bouncing in anticipation, excited at the very thought of all the misery Sherlock would feel once his brother was dead. He couldn't wait!
When John woke up to his actual alarm a few hours later, he found Sherlock dressed and lying on his bed, with his fingers steepled over his chin. His eyes were closed, but he wasn't sleeping. He looked to be in deep concentration.
hurt him," Sherlock insisted, even knowing that it wouldn't do him any good. This man was an idiot. "It was Jim Moriarty."
Now, Jim glared down at the picture in the front of Sherlock's file, recalling their brief meeting in the hallway a little while ago. How even under all the mud and bruises, Sherlock maintained a certain mystifying look about him, with wide pupils separating seas of grey and raven curls gloriously framing his stone-like face...
"Shut up, will you? I'm getting there!" And with that, Sherlock went on to relay the details of the entire night (omitting the brief moment he and John had shared in the hallway, of course) as Molly listened silently, nodding and gasping at all the appropriate moments.
"You two are under arrest on the suspicion of involvement in the buying and selling of illegal drugs. Anything you say can be used against you...."
The first thing Sherlock heard when he woke was the sound of hundreds of footsteps outside his door, all heading in the same direction. The voices accompanying the quick-moving feet were loud, confused, and panicky. He attempted to single in on a lone voice or two to figure out what all the commotion was about, but it was too difficult, so instead he opened his eyes.
"Who the fuck gave you permission to leave?!" His father yelled, suddenly. "And what did you tell the police?"
The moment the boys were dropped off in front of the school, Mycroft had split off from his little brother without a single word. Sherlock was fairly certain that Mycroft would never speak to him again, if he could help it. That he would do everything in his power to avoid him for the entire school year, and then graduate and move somewhere far away. That he would never return, never call home, and go to his grave believing that Sherlock had ruined his life.
"I- uh, well I...um," Greg stammered, seeming to lose his train of thought for a moment. "Well, I know you've been a bit stressed out lately, and....you know, I didn't see you at lunch, and when I came back you weren't here, and I....I got worried."
"I'm also very good at guessing relationships, usually," she added. "And I was so sure you guys were secretly dating."
Skidding to a stop when he reached his destination, Seb took a moment to catch his breath. Only a moment, though. Then, he checked to make sure he still had his last syringe.
"No, John! It's not only unfair, it's impossible!" John was surprised to see that he was speaking through tears. He hadn't even cried at the end of the fifth book. John chalked it up to Sherlock already being emotional from the extreme stress he was under.
don't even know who they were. I was just minding my own business when they-" she cut herself off with a shudder.
Molly smiled wide. "Excellent," she said. "Now, I suppose we should start on this lab sometime today."
"Well, it's obvious, isn't it?" Greg said, scaring Mycroft slightly with how calm he was being. "You've got to kill Moriarty. Just find out where his dorm is and shoot him. You've got a gun, don't you?"
"Whatever," said Greg, finally, Mycroft noted with relief, seeming exhausted of the conversation. He pulled a football out of his bag and started tossing it from one hand to the other, absentmindedly.
"No, he knows me," Sherlock said with confidence. "I could tell. The look in his eyes. The way he spoke to me. Like he knew exactly who I was. Dammit, he even knows that my average deduction time is three seconds-" he stopped suddenly, and John could almost hear the
But suddenly, Sherlock wished he wouldn't. He wasn't sure why, but he found himself wanting to talk to him more. To find out more about his mysterious personality.
Greg scoffed dismissively, still not bothering to look in his direction. "Really? Since when? Have you finally gotten bored not having anyone to make fun of? Run out of people who can tolerate being called an idiot every five seconds, have you?"
After some searching, John was able to find two empty seats in the very back. He heaved a sigh as he practically fell into one of them, sinking down lazily, and briefly considered just leaning back and taking a nap. It wasn't as if he had gotten much sleep the previous night, not counting the few hours during which he had been in a drug-induced coma. But instead, he sat up and scanned the auditorium for familiar faces. He felt like that was what Sherlock would do.
The final set of breaths came from above him, a girl who was obviously awake and standing. Short, feminine breaths that were full of impatience and anxiety.
But there never was, because eventually they both became exhausted. It was when Sherlock was kicking Mycroft repeatedly on the ground that they met each other's eyes and declared a nonverbal truce. Muddy, out of breath, and covered in blood, the boys crawled back under the tin shelter and had a smoke.
Only when he got to the part where he and Irene were wrestling over the gun did Molly interject. "God, please tell me no one was shot!" she yelled, her eyes darting immediately to John, who still lay apparently comatose in bed.
"Oh, I'm sure this is a trap," Mycroft said, his voice devoid of emotion. "But that doesn't mean Sherlock isn't in trouble." Mycroft shut down his laptop. He grabbed his cell phone, his gun, and his umbrella. "I'll be back later," he said, though not entirely convinced that he would be.
"Hmm," Greg pondered the question. "Will I get credit for being in the right century? Because I'm, like, ninety-five percent sure it's Clinton."
Before John could make up his mind about what to say, however, a third officer, this one female, burst into the room.
Harvey's smile dropped. In the same moment, the tension eased and Viktor and John relaxed. It was clear who had won.
They watched Sherlock pace and mutter for a few more seconds before John cleared his throat. "You wanted to talk to us about something?"
John just stared at him in shock. "Other than that....I generally just wait around for something exciting to happen," Sherlock admitted.
. How else would I be able to test my own hypothesis?" God, were all police officers this hopelessly stupid?
Molly's thoughts were interrupted when a loud THUMP outside the door disturbed the silence she had been enjoying. Frightened, Molly snapped her head up and froze. She took a moment to listen, but heard nothing else. Figuring it was just someone drunk-stumbling home from the party, Molly rolled her eyes and returned to her game.
Mr. Harvey stared at the boys for some time, as if waiting for John and Sherlock to confess, before finally speaking.  "I assume you boys know why you are here-"
"So how are you tonight Mycroft?" Jim asked casually. "Feeling a bit stressed out, I assume. Maybe a tiny bit angry as well? Did you like the little murder scene I set up for you in your brother's room?"
. He thought to himself, wiping drops of sweat from his brow. Everything, from the awful humidity to the ominous lighting, was telling him to go home. The city was dangerous at night. But he couldn't. He could never go home again.
Filled with sorrow and wanting nothing more than to die on the spot, Mycroft closed the door, shutting himself back into the darkened cupboard.
Sherlock looked at her as well, mentally kicking himself for not having asked her that himself the moment she woke up. What kind of friend was he?
Only a moment or two after Sherlock left, John's focus on his homework was interrupted once again.  This time by Molly, who entered without knocking and carried her book bag with her.
His boss had made it quite clear that Mycroft had no choice in the matter, that to refuse would be in violation of his contract, but Mycroft didn't care. To do this would not only be putting himself and half the students in this school in grave danger (this alone Mycroft could live with), but his little brother as well. And that's where he drew the line.
"Oh, so the moron lives," muttered a voice from his right. Seb knew that voice. He knew it all too well. And nothing other than the desire to see the face it went along with could have made him open his eyes in the thick of his immense discomfort.
"Hey! Why do you have to do that?!" John yelled, as Sherlock sighed and scraped the food out of his hair.
There was a pregnant pause, during which Moriarty calmly checked on his fallen comrade. "Perfectly aimed punch," he whispered, seemingly impressed as he examined the boy's nose.
Sherlock moved to check the clock by his bed. "It appears to be....4:32 in the morning. Why, do you have an appointment or something?"
For just a moment, he forgot that he hated him. "Jesus Mycroft, are you alright?" He asked, offering a hand to help him up.
came Harvey's voice, sounding frantic and out of breath, as if he had run all the way from the courtyard to his office.
shutting me out again," Molly muttered. She banged on the door loudly. "What are you doing in there?!"
Nobody answered. Mycroft could tell that he was one of those teachers who never asked a question that wasn't rhetorical. He didn't care what anyone else thought, ever.
All the same, Sherlock was one step ahead of his brother now. He had done a month's worth of experiments preparing for this night, and had discovered that the average amount of time he could be missing from his bed before Mycroft somehow detected it was two hours and twelve minutes. Sherlock knew that requiring himself to be home five minutes earlier than that would give him a buffer zone.
"WHAT?" Molly shrieked, while John laughed out loud. It was not unlike Sherlock to get sidetracked. He had no doubt that whatever Sherlock had been looking at was important, but maybe not to their current situation.
Sure enough, he detected the presence of three other people. The one to his right he knew for sure to be John; he'd recognize that gentle breathing anywhere, a sound that he had lain awake and listened to throughout countless sleepless nights. In his mind, Sherlock instantly relaxed. Just knowing that John was alive and near him allowed his focus to sharpen, and he was able to pinpoint the sources of the other two presences in just a few seconds.
Sherlock deduced all of this in three seconds, which frustrated him, as he was working on decreasing his perception time down to two seconds. Three was just pitiful.
"Hang on now," John said, grabbing the boy's shoulder before he turned away. Sherlock froze at his touch. "I want to know. Besides, I'm already awake. Just tell me."
"Honestly?" John said, staring right into Sherlock's cold grey eyes with his warm blue ones. "That scares the hell out of me, too."
"I hate you," said Mycroft, which Sherlock found so childish, considering his recent behavior, that he laughed.
"That's good," he said, then laughed. "Christ, you must really wish you could strangle me right now, don't you?"
"Hey," the voice of his roommate interrupted his thoughts, and Mycroft raised his head. "It's almost time for that mandatory assembly. You ready to go?"
Sherlock sighed as he pulled scrambled eggs from out of his dark curls, not even bothering to go to the bathroom. He acted as if it was a normal, if slightly annoying occurrence to have school breakfast in his hair.
As they pulled into the police station. Sherlock felt the need to say something that he'd been wanting to say for the entire ride there.
Panicking, Mycroft opened the door of the nearest supply cupboard. Thankfully, it was unlocked. He grabbed Greg by the arm and pulled him into the darkened space with him, moving the door so that they couldn't be seen, but could still see and hear what was going on in the hall.
Shaking his head as if to snap himself out of a certain state, Sherlock followed Irene into the dim room full of bad music and drunk teenagers, and John followed Sherlock– knowing that from this point forward, he always would.
"Yeah," said Greg. "I don't think he eats, though. He mostly just sits around with this blond kid named John, and apparently pisses people off for the fun of it. I caught one of my football players trying to strangle him this morning."
way that he could get out of this with no lives lost- but once considered, each idea dissipated like his clouds of warm breath exhaled into the cold. Moriarty had the upper hand, and could end Greg's life if Mycroft even stepped in the wrong direction.
When you get captured as a spy in real life, there's no fighting your captors and escaping to a nearby helicopter amidst bullets and explosions. Instead, your boss sends men to come rescue you. If
"That's what I said! I told her she was going to get caught and expelled. But apparently she knows the night security guard. Or at least," Molly added in a mocking tone, "She
Mycroft turned to witness a shocking scene. Greg was now on the ground completely unattended, as Sebastian was curled up in a pool of blood, resulting from what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the leg. Moriarty was already at his side, his face full of panic, which was the first expression Mycroft had seen him wear that wasn't smug superiority.
"Okay, because I was wondering," Seb remarked curiously, sitting up in his bed. "I know it's more part of your job than mine, but where exactly does the Lestrade kid come into play?"
For Greg had not stopped strumming the instrument since Mycroft had entered the room, and he could no longer take it. The way he sat with his shaggy brown hair falling in his eyes, combined with the beautiful notes he was producing with his callused fingers, gave Mycroft a strange but immense urge to grab the boy by his loose t-shirt and kiss him.
Greg laughed. "Sorry to break it to you mate, but it took me about twelve seconds to guess that he was your brother, and you two don't exactly look similar. It's the way you talk. Also, he seems to be under the impression that my name is Graham." Greg laughed again and resumed playing with his football.
drug dealer? Did you not see his shoes? His fingernails? God, the signs were everywhere. Your poor deduction skills disappoint me."
It was then that the remainder of Greg's stone cold anger crumpled, replaced by pain. His hard gaze fell away and his previously tensed shoulders slumped, as if being mad at Mycroft had been physically exhausting. "Do you promise, Mycroft?" he asked. "Do you promise that you didn't mean any of what you said in that cupboard? Do you
Mycroft felt relief, which quickly turned into fury. Why the hell did Sherlock insist on always making trouble for himself?! Would Mycroft have to start enlisting people to spy on him, just to make sure he stays safe?
"Well then I'll have to figure out the rest myself, won't I?" Sherlock said, his tone quite amused. "And if I die in the process-"
Besides, it was going to be done whether he agreed to do it or not. And he had to agree, it made the most sense that Mycroft should do it. But the consequences of failing....
With the resigned demeanor of the battle soldier whose job it was to wave the white flag, Mycroft lowered his weapon to his side before finally surrendering it to gravity.
Whether the last question was rhetorical or not didn't matter, as Mycroft answered it when his gaze immediately strayed to Greg's face and remained there. The sight of the boy he loved in the arms of the enemy, completely asleep and ignorant of the fact that his life was in Mycroft's hands, was the only thing that kept Mycroft from giving in to Moriarty's dare.
Then John found himself wondering how much Sherlock had to look at Molly to know what he did about her. She sat two seats to John's left in chemistry. Was it her that Sherlock was staring at when he seemed to be spacing off in that direction? Why had he been so quick to punch that boy who had his hand up her shirt, and to help her up afterward? Did Sherlock
White hot anger pierced through every cell in Mycroft's body, and he pushed Sherlock outside of their small shelter and on to the muddy ground and tackled him.
As the first month of the school year progressed, Sherlock kept waiting for the day when John Watson would grow tired of being around him, but that day never came. Even as Sherlock's reputation worsened with every person he pissed off, John remained by him loyally through every confrontation, most of which seemed to happen at breakfast.
He pointed to Seb. "Help Irene with Sherlock and that John Watson kid. I want them in the storage room on the top floor until further notice. Molly's already there and should still be out cold. Leave her there. I'll take care of Lestrade. Any questions?"
He turned to find a tall, thin man with wild blond hair and an unshaven face, who looked to be in his forties. However, the man could've been in his twenties for all Sherlock knew. Drugs tend to age people.
"Good," said Greg, but he didn't move an inch. "Now, I don't know what the hell happened to you, and you don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I know that banging your head against the door won't solve anything."
When neither of them answered (John because he wasn't able, and Sherlock because he simply did not care) the monster boy continued. "I was just wondering which of you was the insufferable prick who decided to grace the entire floor with a fucking orchestra performance at four in the morning. I'd like to beat the living daylights out of you." He cracked his knuckles as he waited for an answer.
Over the past few weeks, Molly's friendship with Sherlock and John had grown to the point where she was around their room fairly often, no longer so prudish about being in "the boys' wing". Sometimes they discussed what Moriarty's plans might be, other times they just chatted. She was really quite fun to have around, actually.
help me destroy Sherlock Holmes, and I don't want to worry about you betraying us because you've gone soft for him. You can stay professional, or you can go be a whore somewhere else!"
"I truly don't," Mycroft realized aloud. Though he at first had assumed that Greg was referring to the kiss they had shared, it occurred to him now that it could be a multitude of other things. Like the fact that Mycroft had almost died less than twenty-four hours ago, or that they were now connected to a murder investigation.
His laughter faltered as quickly as it had started, and Greg did not fail to notice. "Hey...." He staggered upright, taking a moment to regain his balance before joining Mycroft by the window. He rested a hand on his shoulder. "Are you ready to talk about it?"
Surprisingly- and John searched the crowd more than once to be sure- Moriarty was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Sebastian Moran, but he supposed that was to be expected if the boy was recovering from a gunshot wound.
There was no ambulance, and no body. All that remained were police cars and the uniformed men surrounding them, looking useless. Mr. Harvey stood talking to three of them, his expression and demeanor quite appropriate for the situation. However, even from his window, Mycroft could see behind the mask. Harvey was stressing a lot less about the dead boy on his hands, and a lot more about the confrontations with parents he would undoubtedly be facing in the following weeks.
"Lestrade," the man said, revealing a name tag from under his coat. "Officer Lestrade." He then smirked down at John in a condescending manner. "And hey, if you do end up going there, say hi to my son Greg." Then, without another word, the officer strolled off.
known to pay attention sometimes. My question is, what are you going to do about it? I doubt the headmaster would believe you if you told him, and I'm sure you guys have ruled that out by now anyway, so you must plan to handle this yourselves!" She seemed ridiculously excited. "What's your next move?"
"Not a chance," said Mycroft. He picked up his umbrella from where he had dropped it on the ground and opened the door to leave. "Don't you dare follow me Greg Lestrade."
"But they don't know the truth, Greg. They've never met him, and they underestimate him. Jim Moriarty is, in fact, a
"Well....you've certainly given me quite a bit to think about," John's dad said, with the most satisfied expression John had ever seen him wear. "Thank you very much, Officer...." He searched for a name tag.
John was about to argue this point when another boy dropped himself down into the seat across from him. Actually, 'boy' seemed like the wrong word to use for this monster of a teenager. He was huge and had a shaved head, dark circles under his eyes, and a scowl on his face.
John was sitting upright in his bed, showered and fully dressed, facing Sherlock. He seemed to have been waiting for him to wake up.
Irene rolled her eyes, somehow fearless even as Jim began digging for his weapon. "Oh sure, give yourself another body to deal with. Very wise, Jim."
Before Sherlock could answer, an announcement came on over the loudspeaker. It was the headmaster, welcoming everyone to Baskerville's and informing them that there would be a mandatory assembly that afternoon,but that classes wouldn't start until 8 am tomorrow.
John lay on the floor for a long time afterward, sobbing. Not really because of the horrendous pain he felt in his face and abdomen, or because he actually regretted not telling the police about his family at this point, or even because he was being sent to a school that would surely ruin his chances of getting into Cambridge.
"How is the plan supposed to work now? Everything depended on that first murder!" Irene argued, frustrated. Then, she glared at Sebastian. "You couldn't just kill the girl, could you? No, you had to be a
The "classroom" looked more like a lounge room than anything else, only there weren't any chairs. Just several cushions set up in a circle on the floor. Their teacher, a young blonde woman named Miss Sandy, sat in the middle of the circle, appearing to be dressed for yoga. Sherlock hoped to god that wasn't what they were doing.
over." said Jim. "Not by a long shot." And his tone was vindictive enough that Mycroft believed him.
Shaking aside the memories and yanking his mind out of Forbidden Territory, Seb checked his watch again. 8:55. It was time to head off to his next destination.
Mycroft knew his brother very well. He was extremely clever, even more so than Mycroft in some areas, but he was also extremely sensitive. Sherlock cared about much more than he would ever allow even himself to believe. Consequentially, he tended to let certain things to make him upset, and always found ways to punish himself for it. Whether it was by not eating or not sleeping, or even harming himself "for experiments", an upset Sherlock was dangerous, and it was Mycroft's job to protect him from himself.
After several seconds of attempting to restart his heart, Sherlock opened up the paper in his hand to read it.
"Well hello," said Moriarty, his tone disturbingly cheerful and his shark grin as wide as ever. "Thought I might find you up here." His attitude was smug. He had already won this round, and he knew it. Everything that happened after this was just tedious transition to the next level.
Silence. "And you are?" John asked, wanting desperately for this kid to talk, to stand up, to do anything but keep looking at him like that. It was unsettling. He was starting to feel violated.
"Yeah I would've guessed that. He's my roommate," Greg said with a smile. "Anyway, again, sorry about Viktor. I hope once football tryouts start he won't be so easily pissed off."
Irene leaned in close to him. "Honestly....at first, I wasn't entirely sure. I thought it would've made more sense to go after your brother, as
would be apart of this, whatever "this" was. Up to this point, Moriarty had seemed more like Sherlock's problem than his.
"Only that it was for something that she didn't do. Beyond that, I think we'd just have to ask her-"
There were more rules and expectations, but John stopped listening at that point. He simply stared out the window at the changing scenery, inserting a "yes sir" whenever his dad paused.
Finally sure he had everything necessary to frame a murder, Seb slipped on his black hoodie and gloves. He left his room not bothering to turn off the light behind him. If all went as planned, he would be back in an hour.
"Young man, would you mind telling me what the hell you're doing in this neighborhood at this time of night?" He demanded.
Greg looked like he wanted to protest further, but apparently decided against it, because he just shrugged and left.
The second thing he noticed was that it was still dark out, and he was still extremely tired. Had it been later in the day, or earlier that night, or basically
Molly pressed her lips together and shook her head fiercely, her brown ponytail swinging side to side. "John, we've discussed this. It's bad enough that one person knows, I'm not giving this even the smallest chance of getting back to the police–"
Jim strolled into his dorm feeling positively elated. He tossed the night security guard's key chain into the air with joy and caught it easily in his other hand. Never mind Irene's annoying sense of entitlement; in this moment, he was grateful that he had her. It was thanks to her manipulation capabilities that this key chain was in his possession, giving him the power to open any door in the building. Most recently, the door to the power room on the first floor.
They both raced out the door to follow the woman officer, and John thinks they've forgotten about him until one of the men hands a slip of paper to another officer outside the door.
Seeing no need to go to English with only five minutes remaining, Sherlock limped back to his dorm to shower. As he turned the corner into the B hall, however, he found himself face to face with Jim Moriarty, whose hands- Sherlock noticed immediately- were even bloodier than his own.
Mycroft considered this and immediately felt guilty about his snide remark. Greg really was just trying to help. While there was no way in hell Mycroft could tell him what he had been assigned to do, he didn't have to be a dick about it.
"Stop, stop!" John interrupted, and Sherlock believed that he had finally crossed the line. There was always a line with people, and Sherlock could never tell where it was, nor did he usually care. But instead of telling Sherlock to piss off, John said, "I can
"Oh shut up, Sherlock! Just shut up for once and listen to me!" Mycroft threw aside his own cigarette and turned to face his brother entirely. "You think I won't regret that for the rest of my life?
"Keep walking towards me until I say stop," said Moriarty, making a point to press the barrel of his gun harder to Greg's skull.
John and Sherlock's detention was just as Sherlock had predicted it to be: The boys copied the sentence
"And why are you telling me this?" asked Sherlock, freezing as Irene leaned closer to him, her breath grazing his neck.
The message was typed in standard 12 point, Times New Roman font and printed on the most generic paper, yet Mycroft had no doubt about who sent it.
In his defense, he had not expected his last job to take as long as it did. He'd had no idea someone could struggle that much.
But their parents' stone-serious faces made it perfectly clear that they were not joking. "No," said Mycroft. "No! You can't- I didn't even do anything! It was all Sherlock."
Jim groaned, tired of explaining it. "We have to burn him first. It's so simple; we destroy his image, ruin his name, make him commit suicide, and they'll never trace it back to us. Honestly, do I have to go over this
Mycroft pushed away the stupid memory and continued flipping through his book of advanced Korean syntax.
?! Sorry for what, for saying that I've basically ruined your life? That I'm so annoying and stupid it's practically contagious? You were just telling me the truth, weren't you? Everything you've thought about me this whole time? So what the bloody hell have
He had to hold back a joyous cackle as he tip-toed away from the room with the sobbing boy, eager to share this latest development with Seb and Irene.
"Er, hi," John said, ignoring his feelings of discomfort that increased the longer the boy looked at him. "I'm John Watson, and uhh....I guess I'm your roommate."
Sherlock's ability to focus on the world around him with such quick and profound clarity was undoubtedly his greatest super power, and the heart of his deductive capabilities. If a normal person's attention was a single wire, Sherlock's was more like a multitude of lasers that split off from his brain; indestructible beams of light drawn to any and all facets of the universe. He could see, understand, and perceive every sight and sensation around him all at once, just as long as there were no significant distractions.
Sherlock stared at him like he was being an idiot, which probably meant that he was. "John, must I bring up the fact that he
Mycroft didn't respond, but only because he couldn't make his voice work. his brilliant mind raced through every possible move he could make from here-
Damn it. There was only one person who ever used Sherlock's full name like that, and he was horrified to see him emerge from behind a nearby tree.
Sherlock immediately threw the bag of money at the man's feet. "I assume this will change your mind."
Then the man brought in his son Jim, who apparently felt like he had a lot in common with Sherlock and wanted to hear more about him.
Mycroft had already taken Greg back to their own room, but before he returned to join him he hugged Sherlock one last time. "Stay safe tonight," he told him.
Normally, Jim would have disregarded this question with a derisive scoff, but now he nodded. Giving his current agitated state, he supposed it was a reasonable question. "Yeah," he replied. "Definitely."
His father smacked him in the back of the head. "I said, are you going to get the hell out of my car or do I have to drag you out by your ears?!"
"Let me guess," said Greg, his voice light and humorous once again. "You have to assassinate someone?"
"Yes it is! I can see it in the casual touches, the prolonged eye contact, the smiles. You're both crazy about each other!"
"Every class here is remedial, Sherlock," Mycroft muttered, obviously angry about this as well. "They don't offer Advanced Physics."
Mycroft didn't reply. His eyes were shut tight. Every one of his muscles was somehow frozen and hot simultaneously. As hard as he fought to ignore it, his first and only instinct right now was to knock Greg backwards onto his bed and do the most wanton things to him.
The only mission on which Mycroft was ever captured, that one unfortunate incident in Ireland now responsible for all his current problems, Mycroft was ordered to answer all of Mr. Moriarty's questions honestly. He had to keep saying useful and interesting things, whatever it took to avoid death long enough for the rescue mission to get there. Fifteen year old Mycroft had never been more scared in his life.
half the time, that's how stupid you've made me!!! If it weren't for you, I would've killed Moriarty before he had a chance to put a plan into place! But you slowed me down! And now my little brother and I are both screwed! AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!"
"The lab instructions are on page 420 of your textbook. Work hard, because this counts as your test grade for the unit. Go!"
Seb grumbled to himself as he disinfected his skin up to his forearms. When the boys were finished cleaning themselves up, setting aside their bloodstained clothes to take care of later, Jim sat at his desk to look through some old files while Seb stood aside to wait for directions. "What's my next job, you're highness?" He muttered sarcastically.
"What are we going to do??" Irene asked. Sebastian was moaning in agony, gripping his thigh where the blood was leaking  steadily from the gunshot wound.
"Oh, I'm sorry!" Molly backtracked. "Is it alright that I know? I mean, I know you guys are hiding it and that's why I haven't mentioned it before-"
The bell rang then, and both boys stayed seated, glaring at each other. Three seconds later, they busted out laughing. They laughed so hard they fell out of their seats, and the French teacher glared at them until they left.
John nodded, but Sherlock, not sure if he was still being rhetorical or not, stayed silent. Mycroft sighed.
Lacking the willpower to deduce himself at the moment, Sherlock just crawled back into bed himself and continued not sleeping.
"We'll talk about this later, Sherlock. Right now we have to-" he stopped suddenly, staring at something behind Sherlock. The younger boy followed his brother's gaze to find the drug dealer, who still stood there awkwardly with his hands in his pockets.
"Oh, that's all?" Greg questioned with raised eyebrows. "I thought it'd be something interesting." He chuckled at his own sarcasm as the teacher greeted the class in French, beginning their lesson.
" Sherlock protested, panicking as John gingerly rubbed the ointment over the places where his skin had broken open. His touch was so gentle and caring, and Sherlock craved more.
The ropes that had held Sherlock's wrists together mere moments ago fell away, but still he didn't move. He and his friends were obviously being held on the fourth floor of the building, near the exit to the roof. Only Irene was there to supervise them, which meant that Moriarty and his other cohort were otherwise engaged, most likely on the roof....doing what?
Dixon ended up dismissing them both after a mere hour's work, looking quite unsettled in their presence. The boys returned to their room in fits of laughter, and Sherlock realised that just being with John Watson made him laugh more than he ever had before in his life.
"My mother needs me," he would tell himself after watching his dad mistreat her, even though she was just as psychotic as her husband when she was drunk. The truth was, they both hit each other, but his father always did the most damage.
"Someone told me I could find Molly Hooper in here," she stated viciously, her tone implying that if Molly
In one of the three chairs in front of the headmaster's desk sat none other than Viktor, their very first bully at this school. Only he was covered in cuts and bruises, and did not appear nearly as scary as he had months before. Probably because he looked so scared himself.
Wouldn't it be just perfect if the bloke turned out to be a complete psychopath who would end up murdering him in his sleep? John laughed at the thought, but grew increasingly nervous as he approached his room.
"No time. Moriarty has an unwilling accomplice, and we need to find out who it is before Mycroft does!"
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. John wasn't reacting the way people usually did. "Well....it's obvious that you've been abused your entire life, since your own bruises don't seem to phase you. You're used to them. Your father is the primary abuser, but your mother sits by and let's it happen. She's an alcoholic. One of your parents is bound to be, since you obviously come from the poorer side of your town and you aren't well fed because most of your family's income is spent on alcohol. The normal assumption is that the father is the alcoholic, but no, those bruises are too well-aimed for a drunk man to have made. That leaves your mother. But that's not all is it? No, you also have a troubled sibling. Most likely an older sister-"
John had turned out the light hours ago, and still his friend lay upright against his headboard with his eyes staring off and his fingers steepled in their usual position, sitting in absolute silence. John found this even more frightening than the frantically pacing Sherlock of hours earlier, because at least then he was talking. Now, he was as still and silent as a statue, and looking just as likely of ever coming back to life.
"Sherlock, what happened?" she demanded to know immediately. "Why are you all wet? Were you outside? Are you hurt? Did Irene do something? God, I
Irritated by his friend's lack of reaction, Sherlock flipped the light on. John flinched, blinded by it's brightness. "Didn't you hear me? I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!"
A small glint of fear finally showing through her dark eyes- much to Seb's satisfaction- Irene wasted no more time. "Most everything last night went beautifully, up until the end," she explained. "We know the boys' weaknesses, and I can still manipulate them. We can still kill Mycroft, and Sherlock can sill be framed-"
Back home, Mycroft was promoted by his boss and admired by his entire unit. Everyone said he was the best agent they ever had. He had survived a two hour long interrogation without spilling a single secret, even when told he was allowed. He had outsmarted the great and powerful Moriarty family with useless details about his stupid little brother!
John, meanwhile, returned to his maths worksheet, but did very little of it. He kept sneaking glances at Sherlock, who was progressing very quickly through the book, and wondering what it was about him....
But then an even more frightening sound recaptured her attention: the sound of a jiggling doorknob. Someone was trying to get in.
An hour after dinner, John and Sherlock were both lying on their individual beds in silence, but the lights were on and neither boy was sleeping.
"So, do you have a girlfriend?" John asked Sherlock the next day at breakfast, to start a conversation. John had noticed that his new friend wasn't much of a conversation starter, as he spent most of his time studying random people or otherwise just staring off into space in his "mind palace". There was a lot that John wondered about him, one being his relationship status.
He almost wished he could go down there and confront him, if only to tell him how useless he was. How, had it not been for his brother Sherlock, there would have been more than one dead body on the ground that morning.
"She was there, alright?!" Molly finally snapped, the venom in her voice making John flinch. "She was there when....right before I was arrested. She knows what really happened."
Just as he finished scrubbing his skin of the filth, Sebastian burst into the bathroom, even more of a mess than Jim had been.
"I don't think so, mister Holmes. Harvey told me to keep a close eye on you, and after what you've done, I don't blame him. I told him that I've always known you were nothing more than a delinquent. For the rest of the year, you are forbidden from leaving my class until you have to report to your next one. I will not have you causing anymore trouble at this school."
Irene pulled Sherlock down onto the leather sofa nearby. Beside it there was an end table with a small digital clock, along with extra alcohol and plastic cups. Irene immediately poured herself a drink. She offered Sherlock one as well, but of course he declined.
"Yes!" Sherlock exclaimed, showing John his pages and pages of notes. "And it only took me fourteen hours to narrow it down from 274 suspects to one! A bit longer than I had hoped, to be honest, but I'm absolutely sure-"
Absurdly, the mere sensation of warmth in Sherlock's face drew his attention away from the multitude of important matters he needed to focus on, and towards an issue entirely separate from it all: his feelings for John. He needed to kiss this boy a fortnight ago- at the very
"Oh there's no need for that," said Sherlock casually. "Wherever you want to take me, I'll go willingly." John could feel Sherlock's hand on his back, pushing him towards the door, silently begging him to leave. But John stood his ground, staring at the bold red 9:44.
Mycroft thought about the body he was sure he had seen lying dead on the school grounds, and knew he was right. Together, they supported Greg's weight on their shoulders and exited the roof, finally sheltering themselves from the cruel night air. Ironically, just as the rain was finally starting to die down.
For a split second, Sherlock's and Mycroft's eyes met before quickly averting from each other, leaving both boys to wonder what exactly that meant.
"....Oh." Sherlock had actually assumed John was asking him how he managed to be such an annoying prick, which he had been asked countless times by a variety of different people. "It's really quite easy, actually. It's just simple deduction-" Sherlock stopped with the realization that he was being modest, something he had probably never been before in his life.
"She just left," said John. "And you fell asleep on the floor, which looked a bit uncomfortable, so I kind of....carried you." He blushed, clearly worried that he had crossed some sort of boundary.
"Harry needs me," he would convince himself whenever she came stumbling home after hours of partying, with no one but John to put her to bed and make sure she didn't choke on her own vomit.
"Shh, it's okay," said Greg, sensing Mycroft tense up. He caressed his cheek gently. "Don't think about it. Just sleep. Sleep."
Suddenly, there was a creak and Mycroft snapped to attention. The door to the roof opened slowly, and from the darkened stairwell emerged the slim form of Jim Moriarty.
Sherlock smirked. This was obviously the first time tonight that something had not gone according to plan. "Drug tolerance is a funny thing," he said. "Annoying at times, yet somewhat useful at others."
But Mycroft, evidently, remembered. His eyes changed from despondent to hate-filled in a millisecond, and he smacked his brother's hand away. "I'm fine! Why don't you watch where you're going, prick!" And he had stood up and stalked away before Sherlock could think of a comeback better than
Startled, John snapped his head to the right only to see Sherlock taking his seat next to him, his hair still damp.
pretended," Mycroft groaned in exhaustion. Why couldn't Greg believe that he was sorry? But then again, he hardly deserved to be forgiven, did he? "You need to understand that everything I said that day, all those horrible things that I know hurt you, I only said out of frustration. They were
They waited until they were a safe distance down the hall, and Miss Sandy's phony-soothing voice had faded out of earshot, to let out the breaths they were holding.
"Pipe down Sebastian, I'm trying to help you," Irene snapped, applying ice to his bruised nose. "Besides, he didn't hit you that hard."
It was Halloween, and a quarter past six in the evening, which meant that the majority of his fellow students were at dinner. Sherlock was glad to be able to walk through the halls without the annoying sound of whispers and people scattering to avoid him.
"But a few weeks ago, I was informed via coded email that Jim Moriarty is free, now attends this school, and has inherited his father's dreams to corrupt the government. My next assignment: kill Jim Moriarty. In my boss's words, 'He's a stupid, overambitious teenage boy without a plan. I'm sure you can handle it.'
Sherlock knew this question to be rhetorical without Mycroft's signal. 'Dont you?' questions usually were.
Sherlock stared at him, his smokey grey eyes doing the thing where they seemed to be absorbing him. John shifted in his seat.
"I have a new plan," Irene responded. Her eyes did not waver once from knife in Jim's hands. "One that I think you will like very much. One that will burn Sherlock
John, who had been sitting mostly in silence for the past hour, snapped his head up. "We do?" he asked. What made Sherlock want to leave
Sherlock paused, wearing an expression that John had never seen on him before: a combination of speechless, embarrassed, and scared.
....anyway, apparently he was ecstatic when he found out that I was here as well. He wanted my attention immediately. Yes, Molly, he was definitely about to murder you today. You're quite lucky that friend of his wanted to have his fun first. But you needn't worry, as your life is no longer in danger. You see, the murder was just his plan to get my attention."
"You have no idea the risks you'll be taking by messing with Jim Moriarty!" Mycroft yelled, begging him to see reason.
*A/N: Everything might seem a bit random now, but it is all relevant and will connect to the plot. You'll see :)*
And during this time, he had thought much about how Greg had been used against him last night, how his painfully obvious love for the boy had nearly cost him his life. How Greg could have lost
"Simple," Mycroft kicked Sherlock's legs out from under him so that they were both on the ground once again. "I care about you, and what has that ever brought me? Endless pain and worry and disappointment, not to mention constant frustration at your stupidity!"
John wasn't really sure what had made him finally decide he'd had enough. There had been plenty of nights much worse than this one, yet John had stayed. Sure, he'd thought about running away millions of times over the years, but he somehow always managed to talk himself out of it.
"....Oh." It hadn't even occurred to John to search for the older Holmes boy, or Greg Lestrade for that matter. But it struck him now that he should have. The events of last night alone made it clear that, from here on out, they were all in this together.
Slowly but surely, Sherlock felt himself dissolve into these feelings stirring up within him, which was
They continued laughing all the way to their room, when they had to pull themselves together because they were both too weak from laughter to unlock the door.
Mycroft was typing up an email to his boss, who had emailed him days previously demanding to know why it had been a month and Moriarty wasn't dead yet. Or rather, he was staring at a blinking cursor, wondering what the hell to say.
Johns trailed off, blushing when he realized how much he had said without meaning to. Sherlock stared at him with intense fascination, his eyes absorbing him, but with a softness that John had never seen before.
"How are you finished already?" Greg whispered in frustration. "I cant even translate the first question-"
She then kissed Sherlock with such force that he honestly thought the breath would be sucked out of him. He flailed helplessly against the wall as she attacked him with her mouth, her hands grabbing fistfuls of his hair and her leg wrapping itself around his waist.
"Speaking of the plan-" Sebastian piped up, shoving Irene's hand away from his face, "what are we supposed to do next? You know, since the murder thing didn't work out-"
Mycroft relaxed and laughed nervously. "You're not going to guess it, Lestrade, but thanks for trying."
Once his luggage was unpacked, Sherlock flopped onto his bed with his violin and started absentmindedly plucking strings. This was what he was doing when the door opened, and in walked a short, blond boy with a bruised face, who looked as if he would rather be anywhere else in the world.
This logic irritated Sherlock, but he had to admit that John was right. "Well if I can't do anything, you could at least let me smoke," he said, not even giving John a chance to argue before he swiped the pack from his hand. Then, he turned to leave the room. "I'll be outside."
Mycroft blushed, but tried to hide it behind a roll of his eyes and an unimpressed scoff. "Very smooth, Lestrade."
"Oh, that....well, while he's never admitted to anything, I think it's fair to deduce from what I know that he's a member of a secret international intelligence agency," Sherlock responded, in a low voice.
"Well I can't thank you enough," John's dad replied. "I must say, this one has been giving me quite a bit of trouble recently. And you can bet that he will be punished for this."
A strong and sudden pain shot through Mycroft's chest. He couldn't take this anymore. The fact that this boy– this sweet and handsome boy who did not even deserve the displeasure of
Greg surprised Mycroft by sitting upright suddenly and facing him. His red, swollen eyes– full of the utmost disdain for their target– stared straight into him. "Bullshit, Mycroft! Bull-fucking-shit! You're
John sighed and turned his desk chair toward his friend, who was hanging upside down from his bed and looking quite bored. "I don't know, Sherlock. I'm out of recommendations."
Both boys stared at each other for what felt like an eternity from their opposite sides of the room. The mutual flood of relief between them was palpable, and yet it seemed like neither was bold enough to make the next move.
And indeed, John hadn't noticed, for he was too busy pondering the shudder that had run through his own body as he had run his hand through Sherlock's silky smooth curls.
"Will both of you shut up!" Jim Moriarty yelled at his partners. He was quite sick of their constant bickering. "I'm trying to think!" He then leaned back on his bed and resumed his contemplating. What to do next....
"Petty theft," Sherlock interrupted. "You're an undiagnosed kleptomaniac with dead parents and no friends. You were sent here by your grandparents who thought this place would help you learn to control your thievery. Little do they know you also suffer from a deeply rooted psychological need for control, possibly contributing to your stealing impulse as well as to your desire for threatening people and making them scared of you. However, you would never actually hurt anyone, mainly because of your fear of failure, and I suggest you quit wasting your breath by trying to convince me otherwise."
"You boys....are in so much trouble," he said in a freaky calm voice that made both Sherlock and Mycroft, ages fourteen and seventeen, nearly pass out from fear. "Do you realize how much money I lost because of you tonight? Not even counting the thousand pounds that
Sherlock attempted to shove her away, but she kept clawing at his arm. She needed the gun. Whoever had the weapon had control in this situation. He used his height as an advantage, holding it way up out of her reach, but she wouldn't let up, going as far as to straddle his waist to reach it.
"You know, I'm not as stupid as you think!" Greg snapped, surprising Mycroft by sounding angry for the first time. He ruffled his own hair, clearly irritated. "Sure, at first I thought you were joshing me with all this secret service stuff, but now I understand that it's probably real. No one just goes around writing letters in Korean and typing in secret code and....and wearing suits that effing nice!"
He went down one of the unfamiliar streets with caution, not knowing what he would run into. But all John could see were houses. Lots and lots of houses. Some were enormous.
Mycroft followed his order. He was about a foot from the psychotic boy before he was ordered to stop.
"I'm sure you are all wondering why you were called here on a Saturday morning," Harvey continued. "And I regret to inform you that the circumstances are.....quite alarming."
This time Seb's cry was due to his friend smacking him hard on the back of his head. "Don't move it, you idiot!"
"Oh believe me, I have more than one," said Sherlock, almost proudly. "You should've heard me in history class yesterday."
"Really?" Harvey's tone matched that of a parent who was entertaining a particularly imaginative story from their child. "Well, would you like to know what I think, Mr. Holmes?"
"You know, Sherlock," she said, finally setting the cup down, her lipstick leaving a dark red stain on the rim. "When Jim Moriarty found me this summer and offered me a part of his plan, my intentions were....much different than they are now."
Sherlock remarked mentally as he was confronted by a random student for the fifth time before first period.
in Korean. Frustrated with himself, he moved to consult his dictionary, only to find Gavin standing right by his desk, attempting to read over his shoulder.
the one with the organization who took down Jim's father. But he had always been obsessed with you, and I didn't understand why....at first."
Smirking, Sherlock sat up at last, his face warm with the blood that had rushed to his head from being upside down for so long. As fun as it was to be a smart arse just to annoy John, he knew that it'd be more polite to give his friend space while he was doing his homework. Because he cared about being polite now, for some reason.
In fact, that was exactly what he'd been doing just a few hours ago: watching over his sister as she slept off whatever drugs she had taken, while listening to his parents bitching at each other downstairs, and trying to read a book at the same time.
"A behavioral correction school??" Sherlock yelled in disbelief. "That's like a prison for teenagers! You're not honestly thinking about sending me there are you?"
"Well you left me to clean up the mess on my own, didn't you?" Seb bit back, turning on the second faucet in the bathroom to clean his own hands. "I was lucky the kid stayed passed out for as long as it took me to scrub the blood out of his wall!"
John was speechless. Molly, however, would not let up. "Sherlock, I don't know what your motivation is here, but please reconsider! You don't know Irene like I do! She's
Sherlock thought for a moment. "Well, there were a few years of carefree youth during which my brother and I attempted to learn all the languages in the world. That was fun....if you discount all the times we got beaten up for it."
Before John could decide where to go from here, the flashing lights of a police car coming around the corner stopped him dead in his tracks. Unfortunately for John, there was one huge downside to ending up in a rich neighborhood: paranoid rich people.
"Boys!" Their mother exclaimed. For a few seconds, she didn't seem to know whether to hug them or smack them. Fortunately, she chose the former.
Immediately, Greg sat up. "What happened? Where-" he looked around, obviously trying to piece together the events of the night, before his eyes landed back on Mycroft. "Myc....you're alive!"
"Oh yeah," Greg paused, obviously racking his brains for a new question that he would pretend was his original. Mycroft sighed, but decided that if the boy lied again, he wouldn't push it.
"You should talk," said Sherlock, smirking as he made an intriguing deduction through his brother's eyes. "How's Lestrade, by the way?"
But Sherlock was already out the double doors that led outside and racing through the humidity, following the shrieks. He turned into the alley on the right of the building, and John followed to witness the same sight.
The building seemed to be an impossibly perfect 3-D rectangle, with clear-cut sides and sharp corners. The evenly spaced windows that covered the front were tinted, but the reflection of the sunlight off the glass made them appear as a million square eyes. With the huge front doors opened like an eager mouth, the school resembled a monster. It looked just like the prison John had anticipated it to be, complete with a gate around its perimeter. All it was missing was barbed wire.
Disregarding her, Jim turned to his best friend, who probably had the most difficult tasks tonight. "Seb?"
Sherlock to go to prison," Moriarty said in a tone both fierce and finalizing. They were still out of his line of vision, but Mycroft was sure that the girl flinched at the sound of it. "I want him
Molly grinned, taking his last statement as a confession. "Trust me, it's not. I've seen the way he looks at you. He-"
It wasn't raining now, but Mycroft noted low rumbles of thunder in the distance, and England's normally ashen grey sky had taken on its pre-storm chromium shade. The boy found himself yearning desperately for the rain to come down already. He wanted it to pour down right as he was standing in the open and wash him away from this damned place.
Mycroft made no effort to push his younger brother off of him, he just stared at him with an unreadable face.
Sherlock felt an icy dread shoot through his bloodstream, but he tried not to let it show. "What the hell are you talking about?"
Their savior put his arm around the bully's shoulder (with some effort, since he was quite a bit shorter). "Now Viktor, we've talked about this," he said. "You can't be on the team if you keep getting into trouble, and I can't lose another good player. Now beat it before a teacher sees you."
Mycroft whirled around in his seat to find Sherlock and his clueless blond friend staring intently over his shoulder. Mycroft slammed his laptop shut, scowling at them. "That is no concern of yours," he said, trying to sound as his usual self, but was embarrassed to hear his voice shake.
"He wants to use this as an opportunity to learn who he's dealing with," Sherlock said in response to John's question, not looking up from a diagram of a skeleton that he was committing to memory. "He's giving us an easy task so he can talk to us simultaneously, probably to ask questions about our pasts."
John sputtered in anger and disbelief. "I- you- how can....do you even-ugh!" Unable to form a proper sentence, John just sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. Meanwhile, Sherlock continued playing his violin. Until about ten seconds later.
Mycroft knew who the limp person was seconds before Moriarty's accomplice came out into the open and dropped him onto the wet concrete. Of course he knew. Yet he couldn't contain the sob that escaped him when he saw Greg's body lying at the feet of the murderers. The boy was absolutely motionless and his eyes were closed. He could've been dead, except that Mycroft knew he wasn't. His fate had yet to be determined.
Until, that is, he walked right smack into another person, sending them both tumbling to the ground.
Sherlock shook his head, making a note to revisit Irene's answer another time. "Okay then, on to something else. What has Moriarty been planning these past few months? I want to know everything." Then, remembering that he had to keep Irene's interest if he wanted answers, Sherlock slipped his arm over her shoulders. "Can you tell me?"
Mycroft stared at him. This kid was insane. He was stupid. He was careless. He was so fucking adorable that Mycroft wanted to jump out the window just to make his heart stop doing this ridiculous thing it was doing.
"So are we going to talk about it now?" Greg asked Mycroft that evening, in a nonchalant tone that was very clearly forced. As if Mycroft wouldn't notice.
Without waiting for his friends to respond, Sherlock collapsed to the floor unapologetically and closed his eyes. He appeared to fall asleep right there on the carpet, but of course, you never knew with Sherlock. For all Molly and John knew, he was only in his mind palace and could still hear every word they said.
The moment lasted a few more seconds before Sherlock broke away to wipe his eyes. Politely, Mycroft turned away. He knew that by morning, Sherlock would prefer to act like that moment had never happened. He'd pretend to forget that he had sobbed into Mycroft's shoulder, and that he had allowed his brother  to call him William. And of course, Mycroft would pretend to forget as well. But he wouldn't really. He would never forget the promise he made to Sherlock, nor would he ever break it.
"I slipped Mycroft the note early on, as soon as I knew you were done with the Hooper girl," Seb recounted. "He should be on the roof by now. And as for Lestrade, he's sedated in his room. I'm glad I caught him when I did, actually, because he looked to be on his way out. Probably to follow Mycroft."
Excited with his progress, he quietly moved into a crouch and prepared to tackle her. However, his good fortune did not last. Irene must have noticed the abrupt movement in her peripheral vision, as she suddenly gasped and whirled around.
As they entered the room, Sherlock had to mentally command his autonomic nervous system to calm down before he was physically able to make any deductions. Even though every fiber of his being was screaming
run away from their problems. But that didn't stop them from grinning ear to ear as they silently entertained the prospect.
Shaking, Mycroft got down to his hands and knees, searching desperately for the proof that would finish the story, and praying to every god he knew of that he wouldn't find it.
Mycroft would never admit this, but he hated fighting with his brother. Even now, when he felt that he had a legitimate reason to be angry, Mycroft hated this fight. Not enough that he would do something ludicrous like
"NO!" someone shouted. Then Mycroft realized that actually two people had shouted: Moriarty and himself, but they were both drowned out by yet another, longer scream.
Meanwhile, just outside the door, Jim was grinning wider than a greedy child on Christmas morning. This....hell, finding the Holmes boys' weaknesses was already easy enough, but
Slowly but confidently, Greg stood up. "Well, I had no idea I was such a burden to you. I really wish you would've told me sooner, before I–" he cut himself off with a heavy sigh. "I'm sorry, Mycroft. I really am. I'm sorry I've wasted so much time and energy getting to know you, when you've never cared about me at all. I'm....I'm sorry."
Sherlock sat up much too quickly, giving himself a head rush as he threw the blankets off himself. He remained on his mattress for a few seconds, waiting for his dizziness to subside. But wait a second....
moronic piece of shit, no less? Damn," he shook his head, seeming sincerely disappointed. "I was just testing you when I had him captured. I though you'd at least put up a good fight."
"Hello?" said Greg loudly, and there was a scuttling of footsteps as whoever had just been there retreated not-so-silently.
John whirled around in shock, sending himself tumbling off the chair and to the floor, bruising his shoulder. "Ow! W-what?!"
"Watch me!" yelled Sherlock, turning and sprinting for the staircase. But the second Irene was no longer under the gun she lunged for him, taking them both to the ground. They became locked in an intense struggle at the base of the staircase, Irene doing everything in her power to keep him from ascending to the roof.
Sherlock shrugged. "We had a disagreement. It's alright though, I got a few good hits in myself. And I've already examined myself: nothing worse than a sprained ankle."
His voice was so heavy with sarcasm, however, that Sherlock almost laughed. He didn't though. He didn't want John to start considering him a friend, or even a decent person. Just because this boy didn't seem as repulsed by first meeting him as most people did, did not mean that his opinion wouldn't change eventually. Anyway, Sherlock wasn't here to make friends. He was here to serve a prison sentence for his parents (and hopefully get into just enough trouble to keep himself from dying of boredom).
"Uh huh," said Greg, still staring at his muscles. Mycroft, who had very little experience in being ogled at, did not notice. He just took some clothes into the bathroom to change.
Greg sat down on the floor as well and put his arm around his friend. "I couldn't agree more, mate."
The town of Baskerville was much smaller and more suburban than London, with few tall buildings and lots of open space. In fact, the largest building seemed to be the boarding school itself, which John could now see clearly.
John grimaced and nodded at Sherlock. Together, the boys stood up from their cushions and silently creeped out the door.
"Yes....funny enough, you were actually never a part of it," she added, much to John's surprise. "This is just a trade off. Just business." She pulled two syringes filled with a clear liquid out of her handbag.
Meanwhile, the Holmes boys stared each other down. Mycroft still stood on the ledge, and Sherlock stared up at him in absolute horror. But the stillness didn't last for long. Sherlock rushed up to where his brother stood and yanked him down to leveled ground, as if afraid that Mycroft would fall if he was up there for another second. Then, there was more silence.
In the week since Sherlock had been blamed for the assault of Viktor Jacobsen, the boy's usually sharp mind had been quite scattered and unfocused. All he could think about anymore was how nearly everyone in the school was convinced that he was a bloodthirsty psychopath. Add this to the fact that he still wasn't speaking to his brother, AND that his confusing feelings for his roommate hadn't gone away, the young genius could hardly focus on anything, let alone trying to deduce Moriarty's next move.
Greg pulled back, but no more than an inch away. "Tell me you didn't feel that," he breathed against his mouth.
"You know Sherlock," said John, as the boys took their seats, "I have some energy bars in my bag if you-"
"What? You'll kill me?" Sherlock laughed again. "Whatever Mycroft. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some research to do-"
"Oh well," Moriarty sighed. "If you've truly gone this soft, at least I know that a brilliant mind won't be leaving this world tonight. Just a sad, boring,
"Sorry," Sherlock replied simply, not sure what else to say about it. He could add that to the list of the many, many ways that all of their current problems were his own fault.
"I'm not saying anymore!" Molly yelled. "Just leave it! And don't you dare tell Sherlock. I don't need anyone else figuring out the truth." She shoved John aside with all her might and rushed off to class, and it wasn't until the bell rang that John shook himself out of his confusion and realized that he had to be in class as well.
"I'm not supposed to be doing this," she whispered. "But I like you. And I tend to want the people I like alive. Come over tonight if you want answers."
"I should have done it weeks ago," Mycroft responded simply, still staring straight ahead of him as he walked with purpose. And it was true. He had delayed this for too long, and he wasn't even sure why anymore. Consequences be damned. It was time to kill Jim Moriarty.
Once he finished planning his night practically down to the second, Sherlock Holmes set off to meet his drug dealer.
Irene had managed to enter their room without a sound, and was now closing the door behind her. Her normally flawless face was not only makeup-less, but puffy and discolored from lack of sleep. Her eyes were dark, too, but wide with stress. She appeared to have rushed here from wherever she had been before.
"It wasn't my fault," Mycroft argued, ignoring Molly's question as he picked himself up off the ground. "They were interrogating me-"
"You know these people," Mycroft muttered through the side of his mouth. "You help them solve crimes every other week. Can't you say something to get us out of this?"
Jim exhaled loudly and checked his watch. 7:30. Had Irene confronted Sherlock yet? Was she able to convince him come to the party? What if Sherlock didn't show up? Then the whole plan would be ruined.
He took a deep breath and said it. "Last night, Viktor Jacobsen was found dead on the school grounds. It has yet to be determined whether this was a suicide, or a premeditated murder. Though admittedly....detectives are leaning towards the latter."
The statement made John chuckle, his own anxiety somehow eased by the fact that Sherlock's may very well be even stronger than his. He felt inclined to help him along. "Me too," he admitted. "But I need to say something too. And I'm thinking it may be the same thing you're trying to say."
Jim stood up so aggressively that he rattled the nightstand next to him, knocking over what Seb assumed was a glass of water judging by the noise. He raised a fist as if he was about to drive it into Seb's face. He only held it up for a few seconds, however, before dropping it back to his side.
It was only then that Sherlock noticed he was shaking. Not only that, but his mouth was dry, his face was hot, and his heart was beating at an unreasonable pace. "Yes," he replied through gritted teeth, even though all signs and symptoms pointed to a panic attack. He took a few deep breaths to calm his nervous system, which had evidently decided to act up under the myriad of stressors he was currently under.
"There's an estimated four hundred cat people worldwide. It's estimated because the majority of infections and changes happen in countries where reporting and healthcare in general aren't that great. As of right now, you are the only known cat person in Europe. The last case of this condition on the European continent was a woman at the turn of the last century. It's her husband's journal that provides most of the anecdotal knowledge."
Which means Sherlock must like something about him. Must find some part of him attractive. He takes a deep breath and wills the nervous butterflies in his stomach to calm down.
Sherlock gives Mycroft the two finger salute and then he and John are down the hall and in the bedroom.
John infuses the flat with a sense of warmth that was lacking before. Sherlock knows that he is home now and that before he merely resided in 221B.
John still can't speak. He isn't sure what to say. He's tired and it's early and he's thouroughly distracted by the way Sherlock looks at this particular moment.
John thought the whole spitting your drink out in disbelief thing was just a television invention, but it turns out it has its origins in reality. He watches as both Sherlock and Mycroft spit out their drinks and exclaim in unison, "What?!"
John scoots closer and braces his weight with his right arm between them. He's careful not to touch Sherlock anywhere else. He leans in and kisses Sherlock's blush on his cheeks before trailing kisses down to Sherlock's plush lips.
Sherlock pauses his eating, his ears flattening to his head, "You didn't tell Mike what's happened to me, did you?"
He can see the headline now. 'Former Detective Sherlock Holmes, Couldn't Detect Way Out of the Cold.' Callous and unforgiving gossip rags. The only unchanging things in an ever changing world.
Sherlock faces John again this time clearly annoyed by his new emotive body parts, "Last week, when I went to do research for that banker case, I was scratched by a cat. Here." He turns up his arm and shows John the neat row of pink scratches, nearly healed. "I thought it was superficial and typically cats don't transmit rabies, so why should I be concerned?"
"I'm not her father. We wouldnt want her confused. I'm just...helping out. Until you find a new wife."
He strokes himself and uses his other hand to stimulate his belly and nipples; it seems to work as he experiences what feels like an orgasm, but is much more powerful and centered around his new opening, but he doesn't ejaculate. The force of it has him squeezing his eyes shut and shouting which turns into a cry of relief as the baby's head slips out of him.
"Oh for God's sake John, you're making me feel ridiculous." Sherlock sits up and frowns at John, who finally realizes he's staring and shuts his mouth with a click.
"Of course, John. Fine."  Sherlock hadn't even looked at John, he just continued to stare out the window blankly.
John gives a heaving sigh and watches him go. Lestrade sidles over and looks between Sherlock's retreating form and John. "So, uh, Sherlock has breasts now? Like proper centerfold breasts?"
It's always been wishful thinking. A dying wish. Maybe he's already dead and he's trapped in a horrible loop of watching his life pass before his eyes and when he finally reaches death, he'll relive it over again.
Carefully, he reaches down and pulls the tip of his tail up so he can take a better look at it. It's soft and heavy, but flexible. He moves it around and tests how flexible it is. He bends it over itself until the first twinges of pain.
But it is Sherlock, so perhaps he didn't mean it the way John heard it. He can be dense like that sometimes. John decides to respond with levity.
John tries not to focus on how he can feel the soft form of Sherlock's chest under the jacket and tries to explain to Sherlock why it's a problem. "Yes, but now it's different. Just trust me. You can't do that."
John's forehead wrinkles and his other hand joins the first keeping Sherlock from running, though Sherlock doubts he could run away at this point. He's not sure he can feel his legs. His whole body is numb.
He notes its limits and then gives it a steady, gentle tug. Again, he pulls until he begins to feel pain. He adds an additional mental note to never ever let anyone else pull his tail. The idea of the pain it would cause makes his stomach drop and his whole body shiver. He drops the tail and lets it resume its subconscious role of hugging him.
John can feel Sherlock's tension and stops his petting to grasp Sherlock in a tight hug and quietly whisper in Sherlock's ear, "It's going to be okay. It was just a dream. You're here in London, in 221b and I'm here and I'm not going anywhere Sherlock. I will never leave your side again."
John groans and feels his cock flex in need. He needs to touch, but somehow he knows Sherlock is in charge of this scenario. Sherlock is the one to decide how this will go.
Sherlock looked down at his breasts. "Looking like what?" He looked back up at John and cocked an eyebrow.
John walked in on the two of them sharing a deep soulful stare and then the man let himself out all without introducing himself. Of course Sherlock's boyfriend was a ridiculously posh man of little words. John told himself the sense of disappointment he felt at the discovery wasn't because he knew he was inadequate for a man like Sherlock.
If John had known what Sherlock had bought he might have had a chance to intervene before every officer in the yard was also staring at Sherlock's cleavage and clothing choice.
He feels so empty, so much so that he's not sure he can even be sad anymore. He's just tired and finally given up. He closes his eyes and lets out a sigh.
Sherlock lowers himself back down against John and the feel of their bare skin against one another is electric. They rut together again and it's wholly different without clothes on. For starters, it's a lot
He pauses for a moment and looks up into the empty canopy above him. He rests a hand on a nearby tree and gives a silent apology.
"I can hear you thinking and, yes, I'm rather exhausted at this point too. Shall we head to bed? We can continue this in the morning?"
Sherlock smiles at John and reaches out for him. John steps forward and Sherlock takes his hands. "Dance with me John?"
John sets Rosie down on the ground. "Ah well I suppose you're right then. If you have to get Princess Elsa ready for dinner." He gives her one more kiss on her forehead.
For a split second, all molecular motion seemed to cease. Mycroft swore that he could hear Greg's heartbeat behind him, even through the pounding of his own.
Sherlock didn't need to be told twice, for he had deduced in three seconds what Mycroft had deduced in two. However, it was too late for both of them.
"I mean, I thought i'd get out of coming back this year, but my dad's being a total dick," Gavin continued. "He says that sending me away has been the best thing for the entire family. And the worst part is that I never even did anything wrong! I don't deserve to be in here. My father claims that I'm 'disrespectful' which is a load of bullshit. He's just pissed that I don't want to be a stupid police chief, like him. I want to be something better! I-"
But before she could continue, there was a loud knock on the door. They shared a look of confusion. It wasn't Sherlock; he would never knock, anyway.
It was the obviously suggestive implications of that last line, complete with a winky face at the end, that really did it.
John groaned in frustration wondering, not for the first time, why he had such horrid luck. Some teens might have no problem running away; they'd just go straight to a friend's house.
"I find it boring and overrated," Sherlock interrupted, rolling his eyes. "The ridiculous notion of it being the most important is nothing more than breakfast cereal propaganda."
"Done!" he exclaimed proudly, motioning to his torn and bloodied clothes. "I'll admit, I didn't quite expect the struggle I received, but it was very exciting. And there is now a dead body lying on the grounds– appearing to have fallen from a window, of course– for all the school to see in the morning."
Jim had never felt more satisfied. He knew it had been clever to include Lestrade in the plan last minute. If he had gotten in the way, everything would have fallen apart.
John expected his dad to take the brochure and then carry on with his charade, but to John's surprise, his dad began to flip through it with legitimate interest.
"Mind your business dickhead, we're having an important conversation," Sherlock said back, making the entire class- even Mycroft- burst out in laughter.
The clock read 6:45 in the morning. No doubt he wouldn't be the only one peering out the window to witness all the commotion, but nonetheless he avoided opening the curtains more than a crack. He didn't want to make himself too obvious.
Greg blushed and continued. "Look, I understand that there's probably some things that really are classified-"
Surprisingly, Molly's hard gaze immediately softened. "No, not really," she said, and Sherlock raised his eyebrows. Never in his life had he met a female that
Sherlock just laughed. "Safe. There's a concept." But then his voice grew serious. "....You too. I mean it."
Finally, to Sebastian's severe disappointment, Jim set the knife down. "Alright, Adler," he said, taking a seat on the edge of Sebastian's bed. "Let's hear it."
The rest of the officer's words were drowned out as five patrol cars pulled into the abandoned hospital parking lot, sirens blaring.
John stared at Sherlock in awe, and the large boy looked for a second- unbelievably- like he was about to cry. Instead, he grabbed John's tray of food and dumped it on Sherlock's head before racing out of the dining hall.
Irene and Seb were already waiting for him, both looking sufficiently worn out. This pleased Jim as well, because he knew this meant that everything had gone smoothly tonight.
the idiot?" Sherlock yelled back, all amusement gone from his voice. "You're the one who didn't tell me that Moriarty's had his eyes set on me for years! I had to dig that up on my own. Side note, you should let your
Unfortunately, all it earned him were scornful laughs from the policemen and an eye roll from Mycroft, and both boys were shoved into a patrol car and driven to the station.
"You think?!" Molly squeaked, looking so angry that John wouldn't have been surprised if she spontaneously combusted.
"What are you doing here?" Mycroft growled, desiring nothing more than to be alone right now. "Shouldn't you be in class?"
would've tried to run away for fear that she would be hurt. Finally, I can assume that she's troubled (most likely on drugs) because it was your growing resentment towards her that finally convinced you to leave."
But that was all it took for Sherlock to remember what his brother had done to him, how he had betrayed him to the psychotic son of an international criminal, and yesterday's anger returned in full force. Sherlock's sympathetic look quickly turned to one of absolute hatred, and he turned back forward in his seat right as the bell rang.
Always intrigued by the misfortune of others, Jim followed the sound all the way to an empty classroom just off of the history wing. There, crumpled up underneath the windowsill and looking quite miserable, was an older boy Jim recognized as Greg Lestrade, captain of the football team and often seen hanging around–
"....Where the bloody hell did that come from?" Greg asked quietly, his voice shaking. "Have you always felt like this?"
"And judging by the crime scene Mycroft and I found...well, the reason why they killed him was obvious. His initial attack on Viktor makes much more sense now."
The moment of hesitation on Greg's part felt like a century to Mycroft. Finally, Greg broke down and closed the distance between them with a hug. "You have no idea how much it's hurt not talking to you," he said.
She ended it with a loud smack, finally prying their faces apart. "Goodbye, my love," she breathed, and walked away without another word, leaving Sherlock leaning against the wall to avoid falling over and wondering what the fuck had just happened.
If possible, the tension-filled silence among the students grew even stiller. The faint sound of the heater could be heard through the building's scattered vents.
being confused; it was possibly the worst feeling there ever was. He had to find out what Jim Moriarty wanted with him, but he did not have nearly enough information to just go skipping up to his dorm and asking him. For all he knew, Moriarty was just waiting for an opportunity to kill him. And Sherlock was positive that's what Jim's ultimate goal was. The file he had read on the laptop proved that.
that? "Yes...yes I'm fine." He continued walking, extremely grateful that John hadn't seemed to notice Sherlock's involuntary response to his touch.
At this point, John had no idea where he was going, and he didn't care. That is, until he turned a corner and found himself in an alleyway with a dead end.
Sherlock sat back and sighed with a mix of frustration and satisfaction. "Ah, so you finally admit that you have a boss now."
Sherlock waited by the door for John to get dressed, since he himself was still wearing his clothes from yesterday, and then the boys proceeded to their doom.
John followed the growing crowd of students to the main attraction in the entryway, which was a long table with three faculty members taking names behind it. He waited in line for the next available space.
Sherlock laughed. "I can do whatever I want, big brother. And right now, I want to figure out what Moriarty wants with me. Unless, of course, you can make my life easier and just tell me."
Sighing, Mycroft discarded the remainder of his cigarette and started back the way he came, his mind wandering away from the coming storm and back to Greg Lestrade. It always went back to him eventually, nowadays.
No response. Just the same, stony silence. His eyes didn't even seem to be moving, like they normally did.
John wondered briefly if he— and probably Sherlock— were the only ones who noticed that the man had left off the
Unwilling to answer himself on that one, Mycroft eased his hand out of Greg's. Then, very slowly, he inched himself out from under the boy until his head was resting on the blankets rather than on Mycroft's chest. He stood up, stretched, and turned to observe how Greg lay slumped at a ninety degree angle onto the bed.
"Okay," said Greg. "Now, I'm going to get off you now. And when I do, you're not going to resume trying to crack your head open. If you want to talk, I'm here to listen. Okay?"
"Hang on now," John protested. "Those thugs just attacked her. If there was a reason for it, she has the right to know."
On the way there, John tried to get some answers out of Sherlock. "What the hell is going on?" He kept asking. "Why are we in trouble?"
As the boys waited patiently for 8:10, Sherlock pulled out his phone again. He turned on the front-facing camera and used it as a mirror, checking his face and running his fingers through his wild curls.
thing he'd ever done! Did his dad not remember the time Mycroft was almost expelled for hacking into the school computers? And what about the time he was caught making business deals with the Russian mafia? How dare his father call Mycroft the responsible one!
And sure enough, there was a flash of panic in the girl's eyes that even John couldn't miss. Suddenly, she didn't look quite so tipsy. "Hold on!" she said, blushing when she heard how desperate she sounded. She glanced at the clock on her end table (which, John realized, she seemed to be doing a lot tonight). "I mean....you simply
"What do you think it means, Greg?" Mycroft growled. "I overheard his plans. He's going to kill me."
But before he could make it to the door, Greg was blocking it with his body. "Mycroft Holmes, you sit the fuck back down before I knock you on your ass!"
"You don't remember?" John asked. "He was all over the news a few years back for burning his baby sister alive."
A pinkish tint taking over his pale face, Sherlock continued boldly. "When I was kissing Irene....I wished it was you."
John and Viktor were frozen in their seats, mesmerized by the confrontation going on between them, and for about five seconds you could have heard a pin drop in the office.
John stayed silent, taking that as their cue to leave. Knowing how much his friend enjoyed having the last word, however, John expected Sherlock to give Harvey one last smart arse response. But instead, the clever boy simply nodded and exited the office silently with John and Viktor.
"Right, so I suppose I should bring you two up to speed," said Sherlock, turning back to his laptop as if nothing had happened.
Irene pouted, thinking it over for a few seconds before shaking her head. "Oh, but you see Sherlock," she said (John couldn't take his eyes off the clock if he wanted to). "That would take all the fun out of my job."
"Oh, it's Korean," Gavin remarked, noticing the book. "All those Asian languages look the same to me."
John stopped buying breakfast after this, officially ending their bullies' favorite tradition. From then on the boys spent their mornings in their dorm, where Sherlock continued to read the Harry Potter books with fascination, and John downloaded the movies on his laptop so that they could watch them together once Sherlock finished the series.
Sherlock just scoffed, and was about to continue playing when John marched over to his side of the room and yanked the violin out if his hands. "
Greg stood up, freeing Mycroft to so the same. Mycroft waited for his heart rate to return to normal before he spoke, and for the first time, he did not hold back.
Though it took his vision a moment to adjust (it didn't help that he was lying on his stomach, so that half his face was pressed into his pillow), the outline of his best friend sitting in a chair by his bedside became clear almost immediately, the rest of his surroundings but a shadowy silhouette in the background.
"Exactly what I just told you," Sherlock explained. "But I'm sure you can guess how that turned out."
"Speaking of manipulative," John piped up, forgetting his homework completely. "Are you ever going to tell me what she's blackmailing you with?"
Hours of this passed, and just as Sherlock thought that he would drop dead from overexposure to low intelligence, a secretary came in and announced that both boys were to be released immediately. Apparently, the police had managed to "negotiate" with their parents.
