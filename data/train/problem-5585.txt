With nowhere to go and feeling pretty bad about himself, Peter walked down the street away from wades house, unsure of where he was going.
"So are you going to tell us what happened," Pops says, trying to look calm to mask the concern and anger he was really feeling.
Tony nodded and kissed his husband one again. "We will get through this, for our son. We will love him and we will keep him safe and we will watch him grow, and we will do our best to ensure we NEVER have to go through something like this again."
"You know you're grounded, right? No going out, no computer, no gaming system, no Lego's, no Ned or MJ, nothing. You can keep your phone for safety reasons but that's it. And if you EVER, break curfew again you will have a shield agent with you at all times. Am I clear?"
"Well, he's not 20 but you guys are pretty close in age, he's 15. He is a genius just like me and as stubborn as Cap."
Tony finished pouring his coffee and finally spoke, "you know what Petey, I think it's about time we bring that tradition back. I'll call the rest of the team and we can start baking at
I will probably try to update this story twice a week, maybe more. Leave comments if you like the story, they would make me really happy! This is kinda short but I want to really get the story going so I needed to get through the death and the funeral.
"I know, it's just that I don't like going home and not seeing my dad in his workshop or my pops in the gym. I don't like how quiet the house seems without my dad or how unsafe I feel without my pops there. It's driving me crazy." Peter hugged himself tighter, leaning closer to deadpool.
“Peter... Pete drowned. He drowned because I couldn’t move to reach him. The last thing he said was I’m sorry and I was just... I was too scared to move. Everyone was screaming and crying and you told me it was all my fault. I killed your son...” Tony pulled his hand away from Steve and started running his temples. Steve could see Tony’s eyes watering
“I guess you’re still a rambler, huh?” Harry said, smiling slightly as he gave Peter a Vanilla Coke, his favorite soda since he was a kid.
Not much surprised Natasha but opening the door and finding her nephew, backpack in hand and looking miserable did. Being kicked out of the Stark-Rogers household for not telling the truth about the kid was bad enough, now he had managed to run away to her house.
"I would love to meet him Mr. Stark, but I still have to patrol tonight. I'll be sure to stop by next time!"
Rhodey not listening to Peter when he said that he should paint his suit dark green, black and gray because “Ellie picked my colors and she was better with all the artsy stuff”
The rest of the day went well, he got an A on his math test and he went to Ned's after school for a little while to work on Lego Ned. When he finally got home, he ate Chinese takeout with his family and fell asleep on the couch. His pops carried him to bed and Peter slept, thankful that tomorrow was going to be a calm day full of sleep and homework.
"I don't say this often, but I agree with Stark. Last time Peter picked he made us watch Clueless and I almost broke the TV" Natasha said as she and Pops walked in from the gym.
"Baby it's ok, we made a mistake. We should have built up to being gone a whole week by being gone one day one week, two days the next week, and so on."
"Is this about the fight you and dad had yesterday?" Peter can't help but let some anger deep through into his voice.
"You do realize that this? Spider man? It's over. It's done. The suit, your freedom, your powers, once I figure out a way to get rid of them, all gone." Tony says calmly after they arrive home and get Peter and Steve patched up, Peter dried off and into a change of clothes.
"Steve, its fine. Peter was in the suit for 10 minutes and he's perfectly safe. Bruce and I had it under control and Peter had a blast!"
"Hello darling, are you excited for today?" Steve said, grinning despite the nervousness about letting his only daughter go to an all day camp that includes swimming, alone. He knows it is a bit hypocritical of him to not want his daughter to go due to her small nature but he can't help but worry, similarly to how everyone worried about him all those years ago.
Tony sighed, "honestly Stevie, awe have spent years doing this job, risking our lives, fighting the good fight, I don't see the need to do it anymore. You're right, the recruits can handle it. Hell, Spider-man could probably lead the damn team. And Peter is growing up so fast, we spent his entire job fighting bad guys and risking our lives and I don't think it's worth spending the rest of his teens doing the same thing. So yea, I'm willing to be done."
Дорогая тетя Наташа, мне очень жаль, что причинил тебе столько боли. Я не могу потерять себя человеком-пауком и пока не могу пойти домой. Я иду куда-нибудь, где мне будет позволено быть собой. Я надеюсь, что вы можете понять, и я надеюсь, что мой русский в порядке, я знаю, что я был не так хорош, как Элиана, но я пытался. любовь, питер
"Steve when he was just a kid that none of us knew you were fine with him fighting, you saw him as an equal. Don't you think your son deserves that same respect?"
Tony looks at Peter, then Steve, then Peter again. "Pete, we talked about this. The therapist thinks..."
"I wouldn't worry about it too much doll, so, while Tony and Bruce keep an eye on the machine the rest of us should come up with a plan of attack. Pete, you need to go get ready for school."
When he was out of the room Steve fell back on the couch and put his face in his hands, "My boy is spider-man..." he whispered.
"But Tony he has bags under his eyes and he looks so relieved every time we call, I don't know if I can take hurting him like this anymore. It's hurting me too."
Steve hung up and Peter sighed, staring at the screen briefly before handing the phone back to his dad.
Peter watched as the last few aliens were taken down by his family, and then froze, realizing what he just said.
Peter didn't want to yell at his Pops, he didn't yell at his Pops really ever. But after hearing what he heard yesterday and now today finding his dad gone, he doesn't really care.
"Do I text him? Do I ask him if he wants to hang out sometime? Do I ask him if he likes me? No, that's too much. Maybe I can ask him to see a movie or to hang out... god, I don't know what to do!" Peter quickly texts MJ, asking her what she thinks he should do. She tells him to get a fucking grip and ask him to hang out. Peter rolls his eyes but decided to do what she said.
"Honestly though Petey-Pie, I think you are the lucky one. You got the best genes around with all the blond godly features of the Captain and all the doe eyed sexiness of Mr. Stark, blended together to create the most gorgeous guy around."
"Fuck off Clint, I really don't care if it's legal. What are they gonna do, sue me? They wouldn't dare."
"Don't worry, we will let you try it on at some point but now isn't the time. I'll call when the jet takes off and when I land"
"So I think that the life size replica of me that I am making out of legos is almost complete, I just need to finish my forehead and then my hair and I'm done!" Ned smiled just at the thought.
“Guys? What is going on?” Clint looks at the two Avengers, clearly concerned by the picture they walked in on.
"Daughter of Stark!" Thor booms, "Are you sure you wish to go to this Camp? Why not stay with us and swim here? Surely Stark has a pool you can use?" He continues, his voice loud but hopeful that Ellie will change her mind. Ellie laughs, "Uncle Thor, I'll play with you later! I have to go camp! Maybe I'll even learn to swim!"
Sorry if everyone seems OOC and if my writing sucks, I wrote the entire chapter at 1 am last night. Please leave a comment if you have any suggestions or if you like the story! This chapter talks a little bit about how Peter was affected by Ellie's death, Spider-man, and more. Fun fact, I came up with this story because I met a little 9-year-old girl named Eliana while I was lifeguarding for a camp and she reminded me of what you would imagine "the daughter of Tony Stark " to be like. She didn't drown though. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter! I'll post another one by around Friday or Saturday.
"If I was going on a mission with that shield agent who kept flirting with me and buying me flowers, would you be happy?" Steve's eyes narrowed briefly at the thought of Mark, who after one too many attempts at flirting with his husband almost got thrown out a window, before shaking it off and sighing, pinching the bridge of his nose with his fingers. "You have a restraining order against that guy and you would never go on a mission with that ass. Not without me."
His face fell when he realized that Peter was sniffling and his eyes were red, like he’d been crying.
"DADDY, IT'S TIME TO GET READY!!!" Tony heard his daughter scream as she ran down the hall towards his lab. He sat up abruptly, clearly having fallen asleep in the lab once again. He slowly got up, making sure everything that would harm his tiny but mighty Ellie was put away. She opened the door just as he was putting the last of his tools away and ran towards her dad's leg, Tony picking her up easily. "Eliana my beautiful girl, why do I have to get ready? It's 10:00 am and it's Saturday." She smiled wide and rolled her eyes, so similar to his, at him.
Wade looked into the kids eyes and saw just how sad he was making Peter, and even though a big part of him wanted to push all logic aside and be like “fuck your family, go be the kick ass hero I know you are”, he knew that the right thing to do was to make Peter understand that running away and continuing to be a hero without his parents permission was a mistake.
"I don't care if they aren't MY suits because you are OUR son, and we both didn't agree that you could try on the suit. I'll call you later Peter but you are grounded. No going out for a week."
"We've seen Spider-Man get thrown and kicked and shot at and bleed... that was our son! I want to go find every single thing that hurt him and shoot them down"
“My parents found out that I’m Spiderman, they don’t trust me anymore and they said I can’t be a hero. At least, not until I’m older.”
"Maybe we do, but it's not like I'm going to get the chance to date him any time soon. Even when I do tell my parents I'm Spider-Man and friends with him, I doubt they will let me date him. They kinda hate him. And they will think he's too old which is ridiculous since my Dad is like 15 years older than my Pops but my Pops is really like 52 years older than my dad. Can you please just, not tell them?"
"How could you trust them, but not me and your pops?" Peter looked at his Dad who didn't even look angry anymore, just hurt.
"No movie, you've got school tomorrow. But we will eat and tell you about the mission." His Pops responded.
Peter is full on crying now. He knows he is being hysterical but he can't seem to stop, he feels like he is having a panic attack.
Peter looked at him with tears in his eyes, muttered “fuck you wade”, and walked off with his bag in hand.
"I know we did that Pops, I've seen pictures. Maybe we can start a new tradition where we do them on the 13th, and instead of making all kinds of cookies we can just make gingerbread men and a gingerbread house."
I am so sorry but I could not figure out how to get to chapter 12, I know this chapter is short but chapter 12 is a bit longer and hey I finally updated so that's a plus. Again, I am so sorry and I will try to update again soon!
"Pops, I promise this has nothing to do with my separation anxiety and has more to do with you and Dad going to Costa Rica for an entire weekend without me," Peter replied quietly, his pops not believing a word of it.
Peter knew they would only give him a little while to figure out what he was going to say, but he was thankful for any time at all so he nodded.
"Well then I guess I just like icing no matter where it comes from and regardless of where it comes from myself, Peter and Eliana will be unable to stop eating it." Tony grinned at his husband as he took another spoonful of icing, causing his daughter and son to start laughing once again.
Tony nodded and pulled out his phone, calling Happy to make sure he got the jet ready. Steve went to his and Tony's room, packing quickly. As enjoyable and relaxing as his time with Tony was, he missed his kid more than anything.
Peter simply chose to shut his mouth, although his silence didn't last long once he and his pop finally made it to the living room and his aunt and uncles started asking him what had happened.
“Peter no. Your dads are probably looking for you right now. If you don’t go back home they are going to have the entire city looking for you.”
Peter reassured Natasha and Thor that no one needed to die, he told Bruce that a doctor is unnecessary and reluctantly told Clint that no, he did not get any hits in.
Sorry that this is so short and that it took forever but my cousins have been over all week and I have had like zero time to myself. I'll post a longer and better chapter soon.
I'm so sorry, my last season of swimming just started so 3-hour practices, plus more babysitting, plus getting ready for senior year means less time to do what I want. I hope you guys like this chapter, sorry that I don't post as much as I should.
"This is so cool! Yea I'm ready!" Peter activated the suit and began to hover above the ground. He was shaky at first and his dad was worried but then he got the hang of it. It was one of the coolest things he ever did. Uncle Bruce even took pictures of him and Tony in the iron man suits with the masks down and with them up. Tony couldn't help himself and sent them to Steve which resulted in a very angry phone call.
“I’m not just some kid, I have been doing my job and having a life of my own up until this point. I will never be a normal kid, I’m a hero just like my dads and nothing you or them say can make be believe any different. I thought if anyone would be on my side, you would.”
Peter nodded and jumped out the window, swinging towards Wade's apartment, still a little shocked by what just happened.
Three movie dates, 6 taco dates, one ice skating date and one fancy dinner that ended abruptly when Wade got into a fight with the waiter and Peter was on cloud nine. He knew that they were more like "hang outs" then dates because, well, going on dates with a guy 11 years older than you wasn't exactly considered ok in the eyes of most people, including the guy Peter was going on dates with. At least, that's what Peter thought.
After being bit by a spider 8 months ago (during a school trip right before Christmas break) and gaining his powers, Peter had finally started to feel like he had something about him that made him truly special, not just the male copy of his sister. Of course, his parents didn't know about this. They would lock him away forever and most likely try to figure out a way to get rid of his powers. He knew If either of his dad's understood it would be his dad, not his pops. His Dad, after all, thought spider man was an amazing hero and a joy to be around. His Pops felt that although they didn't know Spider man he seemed too young to be doing what he was doing. If only his Pops knew that it was, in fact, his 15-year-old son, he can't even imagine.
So sorry for the wait! College has been quite a time and I am almost done with my first year! I wasn't sure about this chapter but I hope you like it, I promise I know how this story is going to end it just takes time to get there. Please leave comments, I like them and they motivate me to keep going :). Thank you to the person who commented on Feb 6th, that was my birthday and I enjoyed getting a comment on that day. Also, I hope these pictures that I added in work! If they don't then i'm sorry!
Deadpool sighed and hugged Peter, partially because he felt sorry for him and partially because of what he was about to say next.
".... it's...ok..." Peter said quietly. His breathing finally slowed and his tears stopped, Peter hugs his dad tightly. His dad returns the hug and closes his eyes, happy to see his son calm.
Steve, however, despite how concerned he was, accepted that she may wish to swim sooner than her height (in Tony's eyes) allowed. So when she came home with the permission slip for the camp most of the girls in her grade would be attending, Steve knew he had to sign her up. Much to Tony's dismay. But Tony knew that they were not doing their job as parents by refusing to let her learn to swim and go to camp, so he agreed. Now, seeing the smile on Ellie's face as she quickly ate her breakfast and then ran to her room to get her new red white and blue swim suit, he knew they made the right decision.
It was cold when he fell in, that's all Peter remembered. Really, really, cold. The cold did not last for long however because all of a sudden, he was in iron mans arms.
"I think so too, I just wish we knew who he was. He seems so young and I just want to make sure he's taken care of."
"...so every time Spider-Man got hit, kicked, punched, thrown, that was you? Tony and Steve are going to fucking lose it."
"But you guys do like each other, he was holding your hand and you guys were sitting really close to each other." Clint pointed out.
Steve and Tony smile to mask their concern and give their daughter a kiss goodbye before getting back in their car.
“Well, it just lets you be a normal kid for a little while longer, you know? Enjoy life before being a hero sucks the fun out of everything.”
"I'm sure he's ok Tony. Oh and, don't worry about Bucky and Steve going on this mission together. Your eyes are way more dreamier than his and Steve loves you with all his heart."
"Nope, that was me, remember? I chose karate kid." Clint said while attempting to make the karate moves seen in the film.
"Baby no!" Steve rushed over and held Tony's face in his hands, tears now running down his face "I thought you hated me! I don't blame you for what happened to Ellie, I could never blame you for what happened to Ellie. I know you loved her and I know you always tried to protect her. We just couldn't protect her this time. I promise sweetheart I will never leave you, I will never take Peter away." He kissed Tony and then pulled back to look him in the eyes again. "You can't drink anymore though, or hide in the lab. And I can't hide in the gym. We need to stay strong, we need to be there for our son. We are going to love him and protect him and keep moving forward because sitting here, wallowing in self-pity is not going to make this any easier. We can get through this, we have to."
He grabbed one of his katanas and walked towards the door, looking through the peep hole. He was surprised to see that it wasn’t someone who was trying to kill him, but Peter! He opened the door and grinned.
"Pops... papa... it's my fault, not Tasha's, not Clint's, how could you just kick them out like that?" Peter looked up at his pops with tears in his eyes.
“I know that totally fucking sucks Pete and I think that you make a great hero, but maybe your parents are right that you should wait a few years.”
Peter, now with a tracker free phone, scrolled through his contacts and found the name and address he was looking for. He followed the map on his phone down the street, onto the train, off the train, and a few blocks until he reached his destination. Peter slowly walked up the steps and knocked on the door.
Lilly smiles at her and says "I'm in charge of the little pool but I will do my best." Eliana smiles and gives her a thumbs up as she turns and walks towards the big pool, and Lilly turning to face the little pool. Proud of her little pal, and the determination she has regardless of how scared she may be.
"Sorry Screw up Stark, didn't mean to ruin your lunch" Flash said, grinning and fist bumping his friend.
"No, my son is now in his room doing a project with his friend and so I'm staying home and controlling my suit from my lab."
Tony hung his head down as Steve continued to list the ways Peter was grounded until he just couldn’t hear it anymore.
"Hey! Clueless wasn't that bad" Steve said, attempting to defend his son while pulling him into a quick hug hello. "How was your day Pete, how's Ned?"
The tension in the room was difficult to handle. Steve and Tony could barely look at Natasha and Clint (who Nat had called after calling the super husbands).
Steve takes two steps forward and kisses his husband softly. When they stop looks down at his husband, who much to Steve's joy and Tony's annoyance is 3 inches shorter than him, and puts his arms around Tony's waist.
“Peter you can come in but I don’t think staying here is a very good idea. I think that if you just go home, maybe your parents will reconsider what they said.”
"Sam, I'm not letting my son be Spider-Man so don't try to argue in favor of it again. I know how you and Bucky and Bruce and Thor all feel."
I am so sorry! 3 hours of swim practice in the morning plus another hour and 1/2 in the afternoon every day managed to tire me out so I couldn't bring myself to finish the chapter. I hope this doesn't suck!
“Do you have any idea where he might have gone?” Tony said calmly, though the anger in his voice was clear.
With a final look around his room, Peter put on his web shooters, climbed out his window and slowly climbed down his dads extremley high tower.
"Look, Fury made the last call and he wants to see how Bucky and I do when it comes to fighting side by side. The mission is simple and once it's done I promise I will spend as much time as possible with you and Peter. I won't even visit him the next few weeks. Just please, Tony, try to be reasonable."
Clint flares slightly but chose to do as he said, the look on Steve’s face was enough to make him not want to get into an argument with the mans husband.
"Steve! Honey! Cap! Are you still mad at me?? Do you... do you hate me? Are you gonna take Petey away? Please don't take him away, please don't go away. I tried to protect her, I tried to save our princess but I couldn't do it and I'm soooo sorry! I loved her so much..." A very drunk Tony was crying hystarically now, he was sitting at his desk with his head in his hands, bottles of beer, vodka and gin all around him.
He had met Deadpool 3 months ago while on patrol and the two immediately took a liking to each other. Well, Wade liked Peter. It took Peter a little while before he got used to and began to like Wade as only a friend. Now, however, Peter couldn't stop thinking about the loud, strange yet funny mercenary. Peter knew that the idea of them being together was ridiculous and couldn't happen, his parents told him he was too young to date and despite Wade's flirty attitude he was sure the more mature... maybe not more mature but older man didn't want to date some 15-year-old.
"Dad, you can fix the suit and make it safer, you can track me wherever you go. I won't battle anyone after
Steve sighs, "Tony, I know I lied and I understand why you are pissed and just but please... please... forgive me? If you want me to stop meeting up with Bucky... I will. Just tell me how to fix it."
Natasha and Clint looked at each other, clearly having some sort of silent conversation when eventually Natasha spoke first.
"Peter, it's ok that you don't want us to leave. But besides Natasha and Bruce and Clint occasionally checking in you will have the house to yourself. Maybe you can invite Ned over and hang out with him while we are gone. We will be back before you go back to school and we will call you every day."
His room was red and blue and in the middle of the room was Peter, showing his aunt Natasha the new book his Papa had brought him the last time he went out of town. Eliana squealed with joy when she saw her aunt and her little brother and managed to wiggle out of Tony's grasp she went over to give her aunt a kiss on the cheek and to go talk to her brother, who upon seeing her immediately stopped talking to Natasha and started talking to her. Tony grinned at the sight and then went to pick up Peter.
Bruce not allowing Peter to use the little lab station he had set up for Ellie, and getting frustrated when Peter was clumsy because “Ellie was the most careful little scientist”
Suddenly Steve was no longer near his husband as Rhodey (who had just arrived with the others) pushed him out of the way and took control of the situation. Slowly Tony’s breathing came back to normal and Steve sighed in relief, walking to go get himself and Tony some water when the phone rang.
Harry frowned “It can’t be that bad. I told you when I crashed my dads car and when I ruined my moms tennis trophy.”
"Ned? I decided two teenagers don't need to sit locked in one room, inside a billion dollar tower. Why don't you and Peter... where the hell is Peter?"
Peter stared at his aunt, he’d never seen her look so sad. She still tried to keep her face fairly emotionless, but he could see the pain in her eyes. He set his sisters picture down and picked up the one of him.
Peter ran as fast as he could off the building and then shot his web, swinging left and right shouting with joy.
His family did not need to know that 1/4 of the time when he was "hanging with Ned" he patrolling as Spider-Man and the other half of the time he was hanging out with his much, much older patrol partner and hopefully future boyfriend. A certain mercenary that did not get along with his Father, pops, aunt or uncles. At this rate, he didn't know which thing his fathers would be most upset about, the lying, the sneaking around, Spider-Man, the crush on a 26-year-old man or that man being Deadpool.
“I have faith in him, Tony! But I don’t want to have faith in him! I don’t want to think about him being on the field or fighting Aliens or anything of the sort! I want him to go to college, fall in love, get a job, be happy!”
Yesterday he had heard his dad and pops arguing. He didn't know what it was about but when he began to listen in he started putting the pieces together
"Are you sure you want to go Pete? I'm sure your dad could find you a tutor and then you could just learn from home..."
That was the last real panic attack Peter had. Peter hadn't had a "separation anxiety" attack since the last time Tony and Steve had both left for a mission when he was 5. Tony couldn't help but feel wrapped with guilt at the idea that his son was suffering due to his anger.
"Yup. I know we've all talked about letting him join the team but I thought making him a new suit would be a nice thing to add onto becoming a member of the avengers."
Tony thought about this for a moment. Honestly, he wanted to let Peter try out the suit two months ago. He had all the safety measures in place and he knew Peter was prepared to try it on for a few moments. Steve, acting like the mother Hen he is, was worried that something would malfunction and that Peter just wasn't ready. But since when does Tony listen to anyone when he truly thinks he is right?
Peter was right, it was fun. Everyone made Gingerbread people who looked like them and his Dad, Uncle Clint and Uncle Thor got into an icing fight when Thor ate his Dad and Clint's men. Peter couldn't have been happier. More than anything else, Peter was just happy that maybe not every tradition was gone, and that maybe his family would eventually be completely ok.
Lying about the thing only made Peter feel worse. After defeating Goblin, he went to go have dinner and watch a movie at Wade's house. It was horrible and they made fun of it the whole time and then when it finally ended they went to sleep. Peter woke up when Wade's phone rang and realized just how fucked he was. He quickly put on his shoes and was about to leave when Wade kissed him quickly and said, "see you later Peter Pan!" Shocked but happy, Peter left. He was on cloud nine until he opened the door and saw the looks on his families faces.
As Tony got back to the tower as fast as he could, he thought about Peters last Panic attack 5 years ago (Think, Tom Holland in the impossible if you want a visual). Peter knew how Ellie had died and yet the idea of swimming didn't bother him. He was a great swimmer. However, when Peter was 10, his dad's realized not all scars heal completely.
Sorry! I got my appendix taken out and was so busy catching up on work and healing that I haven't been able to update!
Steve closed his mouth and took a deep breath, he nodded at his husband and remained silent the rest of the way home.
No one was excited to see Spider-Man but they allowed him to help, the job was too difficult to deny extra hands.
"Steve, honey, how about I make the call. You are a little too angry to handle this, why don't you help Peter back downstairs and I'll go make sure the school deals with the asshole who keeps hurting our kid."
Thor even said that if he were to bring the avengers to Asgard he bets that the one who his people would have loved the most would have been Ellie because she was the “kindest and one of the smartest young humans he had ever met”.
“Aunt Tasha no. I know they won’t. Everyone thinks I can’t do this. Even Wade.” Peter whispered the last part. Natasha had to stop herself from rolling her eyes, Wade wasn’t exactly someone she felt was good enough for her nephew.
Peter looked down and ran out of the room in tears. He grabbed his suitcase and started putting some of his clothes and the Spider-Man suit he took out of his dad's lab while he was talking with the rest of his family into it. He grabbed a drawing his dad drew of the three of them, a picture of his whole family and a picture of him, Pops, Tony and Ellie and shoved those things in his suitcase as well. The last thing he grabbed was his phone and his phone charger and he shoved his suitcase under his bed, planning to leave that night.
The first is one of Steve holding baby Peter, the second is Peter at age 4 dressed in a Willy Wonka type of costume, the third is Tony with an almost two year old Peter playing.
Peter looked up, slightly startled. “I can’t be home, my parents found out I was lying to them for months and decided to punish me. But they are being hypocrites and I want them to understand that I know it was wrong to lie but what I lied about isn’t a bad thing and they should be proud of me but they aren’t. I think they might even hate me and I...”
Steve sighs again, this is the fifth time Peter has asked him about this. Peter hadn't left his side since he and Tony told him about their vacation and Tony had left to go shop with Natasha.
Peter called the Pizza place, changed out of costume, picked up the pizzas and made it home just as his pops and the rest of his family were walking through the door.
"Exactly, so let's get Pete set up in a suit and ready to go!" Tony and Bruce checked to make sure everything was working properly, that Peter had all the pieces on correctly and that they were in the weapon testing room. Tony had a suit on as well in case he needed one to solve any problems.
Peter noticed a park and when to go sit on a bench so he could think about what his plan was. He started to think of a few options, so he made a list.
"He does, the set is still cool though," Peter replied quickly, hoping that no one caught on to the lies he was now spewing.
"I know what the therapist thinks! We don't have to listen to her! You rarely listen to your therapist!"
Now, however, he had a much easier decision to make than one about Spider-man or his non-existent love life. What movie would his family be watching? "Let's watch a kinda old film but a good one, Hugo?"
Natasha chose to step out, quickly informing the team, Pepper, and Rhodey about what happened to Eliana. Tears were in her eyes as she sent the text, but she shook them off knowing she needed to be strong for her two grieving friends.
"Steve, are you going to say something to your psycho fucking husband?" Natasha said, rolling her eyes. Steve simply shook his head which made Natasha sigh. Steve had his head in his hands the moment Peter was out a half hour past his curfew. His curfew was at
"Because we wanted to hear why you were around him before we considered calling your dads." Clint replied, shrugging his shoulders.
“I wanna go home I wanna go home. I miss my dad, I miss my papa, I miss my bed and my home. I want my dads”
Harry’s eyes managed to get bigger hearing that it was his dads lab. Peter couldn’t help but stare, Harry’s eyes were such a pretty shade of green.
"Peter what happened??? Your face has bruises all over it!" Steve grabbed ahold of his son's wrist to pull him closer to him, which caused Peter to wince.
"I go swim too?" he smiles and rests his head on his daddy's shoulder as his papa walks over and ruffles his hair, still holding his sister.
“You’re right. It’s time. But Tony... Peter being Spider-Man is just something that I cannot agree with. And he needs to know that lying and running away does not get him what he wants.”
"No. I haven't forgiven you yet Captain so don't call me baby and don't touch me." Tony says, taking two steps back.
"No. Absolutely not. We agreed, you see him on Sunday's and you don't stay long, that's it. You seriously think I'm going to let you go on a mission with your first love after everything!"
"I'm fine, now can someone please get me a slice of Pizza? I'm starving and I want to hear about the mission and maybe watch a movie."
"Hey Peter, hey buddy. Peter, honey, listen watch me breath and copy me, ok? In and out, in and out, in and out, nice and slow honey."
“This was after Ellie died. Your dads had both locked themselves away trying to deal with their grief. Eventually we managed to get them to deal with it together. When Tony finally came out of the lab you walked up to him and made that face. You would always do that when someone was sad, you would make a silly face to try to cheer them up. I took a picture of it. It made your dad tear up but it also made him realize that he needed to get it together and be there for you. You walked over to your pops and did the same thing. He just knelt down and hugged you and said that he was ok, and that you helped him not feel sad anymore. I developed the picture and kept it so that I would always remember how you saved your parents. That was the first real step in them healing from their loss, and they couldn’t have done it without you.”
"Aunt Tasha they will take the suit! If you tell them that I'm Spider-Man then I'm finished, I will have lost one of the most important things in the world to me and I will probably never get it back. You CAN'T tell them, I CAN'T lose Spider-man. I can't."
"Tony look, I know you are angry and hurt and rightfully so but Peter is having a panic attack and needs to see you now."
Peter was surprised to see everyone, including his dad awake and walking around the kitchen when he woke up.
Eliana seemed to think about this for a moment, "Alright, I think I can do it. I just want to try, hopefully, I do ok. And if I need help you'll save me right?"
Peter spent the rest of that Saturday with his dad's in their room, his dad clearly still upset with his Pops but both silently agreeing to let it go until Peter was calm and asleep.
Harry took Peters hand and brought him upstairs to his room. He went to go lay on the bed and pulled peter with him. Harry scooted back so his back was firmly against his head rest and Peter sat in front of him.
"Yes, I'll be ok Daddy. No, Papa, you don't need to stay. I promise I will follow all the rules and be safe. Now, can I PLEASE go?" Eliana said, smiling at her to dads concerned faces.
Peter sighed, relieved. Relieved that both his dads wouldn't be in danger and that Ned was now in his room covering for him.
"Steve, honey, relax. She is my kid, if she wants to swim then she will. If people are being mean to her, she will say something snarky back and they will back off. I would love to simply keep her in the tower forever but that will just piss her off." Tony said, trying hide that he has all the same concerns as his husband. "Now, let's go home and be overprotective of our other child."
"Honestly Steve, I don't forgive you yet and I don't fully trust you at the moment... But I'm not going to leave and I'm going to try not to be angry. But no more lies. If you lie to me again Steve... I don't know what I'll do. I don't want Bucky anywhere near this tower. You're over him? Fine, I believe you. But I don't want him near our home or near our kid, got it? I just can't face him and I can't imagine him being here, at least not for a while."
Lots of mixing and pouring and baking later, Tony and Eliana had managed to make at least 50 cookies that were absolutely perfect.
"Please, this is the only thing I have that she didn't have, you compared everything I did, do and want to do with what she did and I can't. I can't handle this anymore."
“Dad? Dad I’m sorry...” Tony watched as his sons web broke and he fell into the water. Tony tried to move to reach his son but he couldn’t, he was frozen. Tony watched as he sunk, then watched as the whole team arrived. Everyone was screaming at him and swearing, but the only one who he looked at was Steve. “You just killed my boy Tony, how can I love you now? He’s gone, Peter is gone, wake up Tony! Peter is gone...”
When Natasha woke she found a note on the air mattress. It made her feel worse than having Steve and Tony kick her out. Her nephew still didn’t know how proud she was of him. He still thought she believed his sister was better.
"And Pops, do you promise not to appear dressed as Captain America and give a speech about bullies? I'm just glad I was near the door when you tried to come in last year..."
Silence, their is nothing but silence until they get to the car. Once they get in, his Dad in the drivers seat and his Pop sitting in the back with him, Peter looks down at his lap.
"You... you can't... you can't do that dad... you and pops... you... you.... you promised no... no leaving.... without.... bye."
Peter groaned, not because he didn't want to go to school, more so because he needed to know the plan so that Spider-Man would be ready. But his pops was giving him that "I mean it, now." Look so he decided not to push it. He knew that he could handle whatever happened and that everything was going to be fine.
"Where the HELL have you been?" Tony screamed after checking to see if his son was injured in any way.
He walked over to his husband, Rhodey, Bruce and Thor. Rhodey was glaring at him slightly while Tony for the first time in years looked almost nervous while near him. Steve sighed and knelt down, grabbing Tony’s hands.
"Peter you promised you would be careful, how could you be so reckless!?" Clint said quietly, unfortunately, not quiet enough for the super soldier and Tony to miss it.
Peter sat back down on the bench and began to deactivate the tracker. He knew that his dads had put one in when they gave it to him, and about a month ago he figured out how to deactivate it. He never thought he would need to.
"You guys always compare me to her, she's been gone for a long time and yet for some reason, I'm always compared to her! I can't win. But Spider-man... he's a hero. He keeps my dads safe and he is strong and brave and he's everything to me. Please..."
Natasha looked at her nephew and sighed. She started to look at his features, how his eyes were big and brown like his dads, his smile belonged to his pops, his hair and nose were a nice combination of both of parents. She thought about the moment when tony pulled him out of the water and took off his mask. How you couldn’t see his eyes, Tony’s eyes, anymore. How his smile, Steve’s smile, was not there. The kid didn’t seem to realize that his dads weren’t the only ones scared when he fell into the water.
Peter’s eyes widened, for some reason he had felt like the guy standing in front of him wouldn’t even remember his name.
"You promise you'll be careful? When you're in battle, when you're swinging around New York, always?"
“Peter, no 15 year old kid should be a hero. You’re not a hero. The only reason why I fought along side you was because I was worried you would make a mistake and get yourself hurt. You need to go home, go apologize to your dad and pops for running off and focus on your friends and school, this whole thing is just proving how childish you are and how you’re not ready to be a hero.”
"Peter, you know we hate when you try to keep secrets from us," Pops says in his caring yet firm way.
Peter realized that option six was probably his best chance. Noticing a few rain drops on his phone, he put his hood up and started walking again. Only to stop when he remembered something important,
Sorry for the wait but school started and swimming was crazy and I kept writing this chapter and then starting future chapters and basically, that is why it took me so long to update. I hope you like it, if you have any suggestions I would love to hear them, if you like the story please leave a comment and I promise I will try to update sooner rather than later.
He pulled out the picture frame he took from his room that held two pictures in it. The first was of him, his dad, and his pops. They were all smiling and looking at each other, his dads were talking at some big event in Chicago and had allowed Peter to come on stage with them. The other picture was of his parents during a photo shoot right after they announced their engagement. His dad was kissing his pops on the cheek.
I am soooo sorry. I lost inspiration for a long time but I think I found it again. I promise I will finish this story. I know how I want it to end and it is no where near being over, I just have to get there.
Ned froze, not sure what to say next. "Um, um, he went to get pizza! He knew you guys were on a mission and he decided to go pick up dinner. He wanted to get some air for a bit, we've been in here for hours."
Steve hangs up and looks at Tony, "Peter wants us to come back home, he sounds like he's really upset. I knew this was too long for him."
Tony rolls his eyes and smiles slightly, wrapping his arms loosely around Steves' neck. "Dammit Steve, keep doing that and you might get forgiven a lot sooner"
Tony froze as he stopped himself from licking another spoon full of icing and giving Peter, who was sitting on his lap, his own spoon. "But babe you did a wonderful job making the icing, you can't expect me to stop devouring your wonderful creation..."
By the time Peter got there the battle was in full swing, and by the time it ended Natasha had a broken arm, Clint a twisted ankle, Thor and Hulk were fine and his Pop's seemed to have slightly hurt his shoulder. Peter had managed to get out with only a couple of bruises on his face and a slightly sprained wrist, mainly because the team refused to let him get too close to the villain (much to Peters annoyance). Despite all that, the Avengers managed to come out on top.
When Peter was finally calm and asleep and the rest of the team was busy, Tony and Steve stepped into the kitchen and talked.
"Peter this is unacceptable behavior! You are hurt and this boy Flash has bothered you for over a year now. I will not stand by and watch my son be bullied. Not like I was."
“They took my suit! They don’t trust me anymore, you should have seen the look on my dads face. He has never looked so disappointed. And my pops is so angry... I’ve never seen him so angry. I can’t live with them while they are like this, it’s too much.” Tears started falling from Peters eyes.
"Peter, I'm going to talk to your Pops and then the rest of the team and then we will have a family meeting about what we do next."
Tony looked at his husband, shocked. Steve had never been this angry before, and he had never said such harsh things. Tony’s mind started racing.
(Dear Aunt Natasha, I am very sorry that I have caused you so much pain. I can’t lose Spider-Man and I can’t go home yet. I am going somewhere where I will be allowed to be myself. I hope you can understand, and I hope my Russian is fine, I know that I was not as good as Eliana but I tried. Love, Peter
"...you think we compare you to Eliana a lot? You think that because you happen to be a lot like your sister that means we love you any less? Peter you are our everything, you are everything she was and so much more because your personalities were very different growing up and because we got to see more of who you were meant to be. But you do and say so many things that she used to do and say and you are a constant reminder that she never got to where you are now. She never got to turn 10! She will never have a sweet 16, she will never have a 21st birthday, she will never have a partner or kids or go to high school or college, you didn't grow up with a sibling. You grew up with a faint memory of a wonderful girl and that breaks our hearts. You are a constant memory of happiness and joy and yet you are also a reminder of something that we all lost. We have tried to move on but the loss of a child is something you never quite get over and you knew that, you knew the pain that this entire family still has in their hearts when we think about Ellie and yet you risked your life over and over, you lied to me and your dad over and over, you had your aunt and Uncle lie to us for two months. I understand where you might be coming from, hell I know your dad does because he was compared to his dads pride and joy, me, when he was young but to stand by our side during battles that we may not survive.."
"Hey, babe?" Steve begins to say once Peter starts making his puppy eyes again, "Maybe Peter should come with us?"
"OF COURSE I HEARD POPS! YOU KISSED SOMEONE ELSE! YOU HAVE BEEN SECRETLY SEEING SOME PERSON NAMED BUCKY AND BUCKY KILLED DADS PARENS! WHY WOULD YOU SEE SOMEONE LIKE THAT? WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO DAD? HOW COULD YOU LIE TO US?" Peter said, now crying though he's unsure why. Then, out of nowhere something snaps in him.
I am SO SORRY! I was so busy with my boyfriend (now ex), graduation, college stuff and family things that I just didn’t have the time to update. It’s summer now though and I have a new computer and more time! This chapter is kinda short but it’s just to keep the story moving. Fun fact, I know how I want this story to end, I just need to get there and that takes time. Thanks for all the comments and again, sorry it took so long.
"Steve, baby, you just aren't meant to bake cookies. I love you but these are the worst fucking...." "LANGUAGE" "...fudging cookies I've ever seen. Let me and Ellie deal with the cookies, you and Peter can decorate them."
"What!? You can't tell them! I would have to explain how I met him which would mean telling them I'm Spider-Man! Look, I met Wade during patrol like 8 months ago and we became friends."
Peter stood up, not wanting to look at his family anymore and began to walk away. But he stopped himself and turned to look at his dad one more time.
"Peter Stark-Rogers you are NOT a hero. You will NOT be putting your life on the line anymore and you will NEVER be Spider-Man again!" His Pops all but shouted in his Captain America voice.
Peter blushed while Deadpool had a conversation with his boxes about what to say and what not to say around Peter. Just while Wade told the yellow box to stop being such a fucking looney and to get his shit together, Peters "Spidey phone" (special thanks to his dad, even if he didn't know he gave it to him) rang.
So no, Steve had not planned on marrying Howard Starks son, raising two kids in a tower that cost billions of dollars, becoming and leading the Avengers and most importantly being around in 2023. But that's how life turned out for Steve, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
Peter quickly shakes it off, realizing he needs to think about it later. He has a job to do. With a deep breath, he jumps off the roof, swinging towards the battle.
"I know you're proud of me, I know you think I can do this. I know you're scared that I'm going to get hurt. But Dad, please try to push that part away. Please try to just focus on how proud you are of me and please give me another chance. I'm nothing without the suit."
Tony not allowing Peter to work on the robot Ellie built when she was 6 (that had stopped working two years after she died) because “Ellie explained exactly what she wanted this robot to do and how she would have fixed his problems, you wouldn’t understand her plan Pete”
Peter woke up. He almost started crying. It felt so real, god he wanted it to be real. He looked at his aunt who was in bed fast asleep. He knew she would be calling his parents in the morning, so if he was going to get away. He knew exactly where he was going next. He quickly wrote out a note and silently left, careful as to not disturb his aunt.
"Papa you can't make the cookies anymore." Steve looked at his daughter and then looked back down at his tray of burnt holiday cookies.
"Sorry sweetheart but no, you are stuck with us while your sister is away." Tony looks down at Peter and says "but maybe we can play with the robots today while your sister is gone?" Peter smiles and nods, but is still clearly upset about not being able to swim with his sister.
If they didn't remember her, he wouldn't see the twinge of sadness any time he or his dad made "puppy dog eyes" towards his pops, his sister was the master of them. He wouldn't see the happy yet slightly pained look on his dad's face any time he got an academic achievement at school because his sister had been incredibly bright and probably would have graduated high school by 12 is she had lived that long. The way uncle Bruce frowns ever so slightly when he offers to help in his lab, the tears that would form in his aunts eyes when he wanted to play spies with Natasha growing up, when he asked Uncle Thor to make his favorite lunch, Ellies favorite lunch and eventually Thor just stopped cooking, the firm no he would receive when he used to ask his fun uncle Clint if he could read with Peter in the vents, like Ellie used to, when he made gifts for uncle Rhodey who would smile at them sadly because he put the one his sister gave him in her grave, when he used to follow Aunt Pepper around and copy her bossy attitude, like Ellie used to and she finally burst into tears and told him to stop. If they didn't remember her, none of these things would happen. But he can't change that. They all remember her. And somehow he had managed to grow up to be so much like her in so many ways. He hated it. What he loved, however, was being Spider-Man.
"Well, I guess the boss has spoken. Cap, should we go finish packing?" Tony took his husband's hand and pulled him towards their room.
“Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers, it appears that your daughter was attempting to take the swim test and she was unable to complete it. By the time the lifeguard got to her… she was already gone.” the paramedic at the scene explained as calmly as she could.
"No, don't even try to say anything. It's done. You're done. Spider man is done. God and to think we were recruiting you when today's mission ended..."
“By the time the lifeguard got to her!?!? What the hell was the lifeguard doing???” Steve shouted at the paramedic.
"Trust me, I haven't really been able to sleep while we've been here either. All I can think about is Peter. But I also know we needed to do this, for both our sake and his..."
"I think we've got it covered Wilson." Natasha said calmly but with that fiery glare she tends to have.
"Peter, how can we trust you when you lied to us for so long? Gaining that trust back is going to take time... I'm sorry."
"Steve he NEEDS you, Peter needs you, the team needs you. None of us have even seen Tony in a month but Rhodey says he has started drinking again. Your son lost his big sister, he shouldn't lose his parents too." She knew it was a little harsh, but she also knew he needed to hear it. Just like how at this very moment, Tony was getting the "you don't want your son growing up around an alcoholic" speech. Steve sighed, knowing she was right. Without another word, he walked out the door and towards Tony's lab.
"Ok. Hey um, I'm going to ask Dad when I get downstairs but... well... I'm 15, I'm almost 16, you and dad said when I was 15 I could maybe try on the..."
"Glad to hear it," Peter said, smiling and rolling his eyes. That is until he saw the look on his Pops face.
Steve looked at his son who was trying his best to look fine and failing miserably. Steve began to feel a bit of rage, thinking about the fact that this bully was just going to continue to hurt his son and that his son was going to continue to let it happen to him.
All of a sudden Peters head was pushed down hard, smashing his muffin on his face and banging his head in the process.
Peter texted Ned and explained the whole situation to him as he left Wades house. He knew he couldn’t stay at Ned’s house because that’s where his parents would look first. He texted MJ as well but again, his parents would look there.
"Pops, I can't do this anymore. Can you and Dad please come home? I really, really need you to come home..."
Swimming has been something that Tony and Steve knew they should have taught their daughter but were almost too scared to do. Tony felt that she was so small, so fragile, that maybe it would be best to learn when she was tall enough to stand with her head above the water in the pool he had put in especially for her. The pool is 5 ft two inches deep all the way across, and she is 3'5" which meant she wasn't even close to being ready to learn in Tony's eyes.
Sitting here now, years later, Peter found himself just as calm as he was all the other times they had done this. He was glad to know that despite everything, he could still count on Harry.
“More than you’ll ever know мой маленький племянник. Now let’s get you some food and get you to bed.”
The first picture was of Tony holding a baby Eliana, the second was of an almost two-year-old Ellie looking up at Steve making a silly face, the third was of Ellie hugging Steve right before her first day of camp.
Lilly sighs, "If you think you can do it, you should try! If you are too scared, don't do it. You never have to do anything you don't want to. If you're too scared, it won't even be fun!"
Peter rolled his eyes at the comments about his dads but nodded slightly in agreement. "But I don't want to ruin their good time."
“We did listen to him, we just don’t want our fifteen year old child to risk his life every day.” Steve says, trying to keep a level head.
And Steve, any time Peter did anything slightly wrong would tell him that Eliana would not have done something like what Peter just did.
"About bullies. Yes, I know Pops but I can handle it! I'm brave and I'm strong and, and I know that I'm kinda tiny but that doesn't mean I'm not mighty" Peter joked while making a muscle (which although his muscles weren't as prominent as his dad or uncle Thor's, weren't too bad anymore).
"Hey everyone, why are you guys all up so early?" He said as he walked towards the fridge to get some juice.
Peter finished swinging around at 6:00, knowing that if he stayed out any later all the Avengers would be looking for him. Although he wanted to spend more time outside with his webs before school started in a few days, he knew his dads would not be pleased if he went anywhere without calling and asking first.
"Got a call from his mom that he needed to come home for some reason. Are you sure you're ok Peter?"
“Are we positive he didn’t go to Mjs or Neds?” Bruce looks around at everyone in the room, feeling the need to say something before an argument broke out.
Bruce sighs and takes off his glasses to rub his eyes, then puts them back on and stands up. "I think I'm going to go upstairs and take a little break, are you ok Tony?"
"14 months!? You've been lying to us for 14 months!?! During those 14 months did you not once think that during those 14 months you could have died? That when spider man was out on a solo mission he may never have returned and your father and I would never have known?"
"Really? Are you sure? That's great! I don't know which one I want to try on, there are so many options..." Peter begins listing off his favorite suits while Tony texts Bruce to come to the lab.
"Don't you two think it's time for breakfast?" Eliana and Peter nodded and Natasha got off the floor. The four of them headed towards the living room where Steve, Clint, Bruce, Rhodey, and Thor were all making breakfast and drinking coffee.
Peter sighed, relieved that his dads finally left but now realizing that although it was his sophomore year, he was just as nervous as last year. With a deep breath, he walked into the building, hoping the day would go by quickly.
"Steve, maybe it's time you go talk to your husband," Natasha said, trying to get her friend to do anything besides work out.
"Honey it's only for a week. Besides, your therapist thought it might be a good idea if we finally started working on the..."
"Tony you know you're not old and you also know what I meant. Don't you sometimes wish we were done with this? That all you had to do was run Stark Industries and all I had to do was help out around Shield and that we could just, you know, stop being heroes?"
Bruce walked downstairs with a few sandwiches, "so you're letting Peter try on a suit? Didn't Steve say no?"
Wade tried to put his hand on Peters shoulder in a comforting way but Peter shrugged it off, a hurt look on his face.
“I need everyone to listen here and listen good. This argument is pointless. Young stark is missing. We have all already lost one child. Do we want to lose another? I grieve for my niece everyday. I will not grieve for my nephew. Until he is found there should be no more arguing. No questioning of parenting, no blaming, none of it. We must find Peter and we must work together to do so. Understood?”
Eliana, who everyone referred to as Ellie, was her daddy's daughter in almost every way. She was a genius, ready for 6th grade at the age of only 9. She was determined and stubborn, though Tony swears those traits came from Steve, and she never stopped talking. Although, she did get a thing or two from her Papa. She hated bullies, she believed she could do anything and nothing would stop her, and she was incredibly small. She was just under four feet, but with her determination and her positive attitude, you would think she was a fully grown woman. Steve worried about her height, he knew that he and Tony were very stubborn as was Ellie and that she would get herself into trouble like he used to but both Tony and Ellie told him not to worry, that although she was small she was mighty. Ellie was a beauty, she had long flowing brown hair and big brown eyes, traits she clearly inherited from Tony.
Ned sat in the spinning chair in Peters room, messing around with a pair of Peters old web shooters.
“That was a low blow, Rodgers. You know damn well we stopped manufacturing weapons years ago. I know the difference between a weapon and my goddamn son, I just have a little more faith in him than you do.”
Tony rolled his eyes at something Peter's pops said, "Do you want to talk to Peter?" Peter took the phone, hoping to stop the argument before it got any worse. "Hey Pops! How's the flight?"
The next frame has two pictures. A picture of Eliana dressed for their Christmas party they were having that night, she wanted a picture In The new scarf that Rhodey has gotten her. And a picture of Peter playing dress up as a “pirate”.
Tony smiles at how happy he and Steve look whole holding their baby. He decides that he is going to put it next to the three pictures frame that holds pictures of Peter.
As Peter neared the store he heard a scream, all thoughts about Wade disappearing. Green Goblin was busy setting up explosives that would blow up one of the biggest banks in New York and all of the people in and around it. Without a second thought, Peter changed into his costume, only to see Deadpool in his costume running towards him.
"I can't have people on the team that I don't trust. Widow and Hawkeye will still be members of the Avengers, but I will not have them living under this tower. If they are willing to lie to me and Tony about our son's safety then who knows what else they would be willing to lie about."
