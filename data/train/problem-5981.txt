Oh if she had met Tony, she would have mothered him so much, Steve laughed quietly to himself, he could imagine taking Tony home in the Christmas break and introducing his genius and boisterous best friend, she’d welcome him with open arms, Bucky would have probably sized Tony up as someone who was his second friend that he’d have brought him, Sarah Rogers would have cooked up a meal for kings, telling them to sort out his room so they could sleep. Maybe she would have seen the way he looked at Tony, the way he treated him, she’d have forced him to bunk with Bucky in the guess room because
Peter woke up on the floor, his neck in a slight pain as he got up from the awful sleeping position. He rolled over on to his back and curled up in to the crab position to stretch out his back. Standing up straight from this position, the early morning sun streaming in from the window through the blinds. He could see the individual dust particulars floating in the air. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept that well. Peter spotted a set of weights in the corner, not much but enough for Peter to work with. It had been an hour or so before Peter heard a gently knock at the door.
Steve was finally starting to feel the heat from the wood burning stove, stretching his legs out in front of him, trying to heat up his toes first. “Howard gets obsessed on things, he found me in the ice but when I first woke up, I could just tell something had changed, he just obsessed on all the wrong things. Weapons, secrets and power. He just lost his belief in something better.” Clint gave a slight hum, “So he wasn’t always this dickish?” Natasha snorted, “Oh, no he’s always been that big of a dick!” The trio broke into laughter around the flickering light of the stove fire.
The shield ricochet off the far concrete wall, flying into the back of the Hydra agent’s neck. The body flew forward towards Steve. He held his hand out expectantly, aiming to grip the agent’s neck. He squeezes tightly, using his upper arm strength to throw the agent against the closest wall next to him. He continues to push forward down the hall. The agent collapsed down on to the floor. Clint held position up on the cat walk, bow and arrow drawn as protection over Steve’s shoulder. It wasn’t needed. Steve has been, in Clint’s opinion, on a rampage. He teased him with revenge, but Steve had taken it as gospel. His rampage had cleared the east coast of one of Shield’s largest threats. His grief’s a powerful and depressing motivator, according to the compulsory Shield psychologist, due to the serum’s power. Clint could barely keep up with the one-man army on days like this. He’d barely even had time to come to terms with Stark family’s death himself, but watching the guilt, eat his new friend apart, has been hard to watch.
Natasha, came through the door, holding carrier bags of takeaway food. Shivering as she kicked the door closed again. “Ok, I vote nobody opens that door till morning. At the earliest!” Clint’s voice was slightly muffled under the two blankets. Natasha walked past Clint, swiping the top blanket layer off Clint’s shoulders. Wrapping it round herself as shew walked. Clint let out a slightly pathetic whine. “When we get back, I’m filing a Shield report about the access to safe house in weather affected areas. No more wood burning stove, fishing cabins in the middle of fucking December!” Steve walked over to the bags. Dividing the food and handing it out to the pair, Clint poking a single hand out of his cocoon to take the food.
Tony and Peter returned back at the flat after purchasing basics like socks, underwear, shoes and watch for him, they threw their purchases down by the door, and threw themselves down on the couch. “We should probably start figuring out a way to get you home Peter, it might take us a while but I’m pretty sure we can do it. We just need to figure it out!” Tony reached over the couch to the note pad on the side table. “Let’s do this” Peter recounted his experience and the environment that he was in when he was sent back in time. Tony took notes through his whole story. Tony started sketching the layout of the room, with the dimensions of Peter and other objects in the room. They threw back and forth methods of solving this idea all afternoon until the phone rang in the flat. Tony sighed and went to answer the phone. “Tony here.” He hummed in respond to other voice on the phone, “ok thank you for the heads up. We’ll be out of here tomorrow hopefully. Thanks J.” Tony hung up the phone leaning his head on the wall above the mustard yellow phone.
“You should come to my class after lunch, keep your mind fresh, it’d be a shame to see a Stark’s genius go to waste.” Tony took a big bite of the roll, munching on it loudly, “Really? I’ve never been to a lecture before, you sure it won’t be too advanced for me?” Tony snorted, a couple of crumbs flew out his mouth, Peter backed away, slightly disgusted at the spit/crumbs. “That’s funny, dude, you’re going to be disappointed in the American education system. I spend my time perfecting my AI guidance system.” Tony finally swallowed the roll, taking a sip of the coffee to help it down, “Kid, it’s embarrassing for the lecturer, like you know the advanced moral ethics of modern robotics?” Peter nodded, worried for how actually stupid this lecturer was, “He’s convinced that it’s like, maybe it’s an old film for you, but this summer a movie called Terminator 2 came out and I swear he lost the plot after that!”
They took a moment, enough for Tony to get a little … bored. He held on to his aunt as she continued to cry into his shoulder, his eyes wandered around the room, finding interest in the fly buzzing around the phone. Aunt Peggy patted his back twice. Pulling apart from each other, “I could tell i’d lost your attention.” Tony laughed vibrated through the pair.
“Alright then kiddo, Steve go wait on the couch or so where you can relax and FRIDAY please get someone to bring the boxes down.” Steve wrapped his good arm around his husband’s waist for a quick hug and nodded, pulling away he reached to ruffle Peter’s hair. Peter’s stood and took it, as much as he ‘hated’ it he knew it would challenge his Pops to try harder and give chase if he resisted. Peter raised his shoulder in a shrugged position as his hair was ruffled, then Steve made his way to the couch, “What’s in the boxes anyway?” Peter asked.
Steve lost track of his thoughts again, as they crossed the state border. He had enough time to think through that if Shield wouldn’t let him go, then he would hide from them. He was determined to visit Edwin Jarvis properly and apologise for not being there for Tony, failing his job at protecting him. He could at least tell him the truth about how he felt. Jarvis was always Tony’s father figure, they used to joke that Tony’s actual name was Tony Jarvis and that would always make Edwin blush. Tony never quite laughed at that. Steve was pretty sure that Tony had wished that was true, that he wasn’t the billionaire’s son but the butlers. He’d considered, while staring over the mountains a couple miles back that he wanted to change his name.
“What? He’s 17, He’s had his health classes, he knows his parents still love each other, also he practically an adult!” Tony looked up to Steve across the kitchen island.
“Captain America saves the world. He never showed an interest in anyone but his country since the day his mouth died. Why are you different?” Fury’s face twitched but remained neutral. Tony knew in that moment, his answer. He stopped panicking and let go of the button. “See, that’s where you’re wrong. He’s had friends all his days, but just like everyone who ever fell in love with the perfect ‘Captain America’, you forgot one thing.” Tony stepped forwards, nose to nose with fury, staring past him, just to show how meaningless he was to him. “Take off the mask and they man making those decisions, the perfect human, is Steve Rogers, he forgets things, he likes to lounge on couches all day, he hates socks that don’t match, he’d eat anything as long as it doesn’t have broccoli in it and he’d hate that all you care about is what the ‘Captain’ can do for you!”
“FRIDAY, Scan the fancy glove for an radiation markers, then compare to the file we have on Loki’s scepter.” Tony called out, pulling over two stools for himself and peter. “Boss, the gauntlet is letting off no radiation but is transmitting a low level frequency. Scans show the molten liquid is infused with vibrainium dust and another unknown element.” Peter raised his eyebrow. Inspecting the gauntlet for himself Peter noticed the full bar of the unknown substance along the wrist of the gauntlet, incased by what appeared to be glass, with a small button next to the bar. “So, even just with the vibranium involved, this thing is gonna be like, stupidly hard to break open into its components?” Peter asked his Dad, who was tapping the sides of the gauntlet with an electric wire. Tony nodded, signaling Peter to hand him one of the flat head screwdrivers. Tony took the screwdriver from Peter, and attempted to wedge it under one of the wires on the fingers.
“So, you’re level eight clearance and he’s level nine, so I’m going to assume the Directors of Shield are level ten?” Natasha bounced back and forth on her heels, trying to lighten Steve’s bad mood. “Technically They are Level thirteen, and I don’t know anyone besides Cap, here whose higher than me. Never met a level eleven.” Barton just shrugged his shoulders, the thought didn’t sit easy with him but it’s never taken him long to gain levels and Steve doesn’t even seem to know that much more than him.
But it had been at least two months since Rhodey had last seen Tony or Steve for that matter but it was good to know Tony was at least alive and causing trouble again. Rhodey took the two sides of his jacket and pulled it tight across his body. It was still spring in North America, it was freezing.
Rhodey had just saved him from himself last night and Peter… wasn’t even born yet. A gift to meet him but a curse that he has to wait to meet him later. He fell backwards onto the bed, arms stretched above his head. Tony lifted his head up, chin tucked into his chest, the cheap wooden beside table vibrated with Steve’s alarm.
Steve took the box, with an apprehensive look over his face, Clint shrugged. He opened the box to find a pair of leather finger less gloves, exactly Steve’s size. “Step 2 – get him to put the gloves on.” Steve pulled off his current gloves, the crusted with the mud and blood mixed into them. Clint winced a little as Steve dropped them on to the floor next to him. Steve inspect the tan brown leather gloves as he pulled them on, they fit perfectly. Stretching out his fingers and curling them to work in the leather. He could feel something crinkling over the back of his hand on one of the gloves. Clint began to read aloud the finished letter.
sighed to himself, well, cross that bridge when they come to it. The car stopped at the entry gate. So close to home, he smiled to the guard, holding a single finger over his lips to silence him, pointing down to a sleep Peter, the guard nodded and signalled them through.
The truck braked hard as it skidded towards the group. The truck came to a halt a few paces in front of them. The engine cut out, and the driver side door opened. Clint jumped out and carefully walked round to the front, “Natasha!” He sprinted forward into her arms, squeezing tightly! She gripped tightly onto the back of his quiver. Steve lowered his guard, Smiling at the pair, he placed his hand on Peter’s shoulder and squeezed tightly. Peter grinned, jumping on the spot at the reunited team but he stopped when he heard the other truck door shut, whipping his around to see Steve.
Peter stepped away from Peggy, he bent down to pick up his Dad’s wrench in his other hand, inspecting the two items in his hands, the tears flowing freely down his face. He stood up and quickly ran his way out of the room clutching his parent’s things against his chest. The faint calls of his name as he makes his way down the fire escape stairs. All he can hear is the beating of his own heart as he collapses at the bottom of the stairs, sliding over and curling up under the stairs in the darkness. He hears the double slam of the doors a couple of floors up.
“Carter! Where is he!? Where are you hiding my son?!” Howard roared. Peter gave a small jump at the shock of the voice. “I saw him walk in here Carter. Where is he!?” Peggy stood prim and proper with her stance and gave a sarcastic tone, “Oh, is he your son now Howard? I thought it was the destroyer of property, or the Brat? Hmm, what is it this time Howard?” Steve rushed into the room seconds later, trying to find Tony and get him out of there, while trying to act casual to Howard.
His son had lost a year of his life away from his friends and his family, left with his past self. Steve wasn’t as sure of himself in the 90’s fresh out the ice, he’d always second guessed himself and all the decisions he’d made but Tony finally kicked that out of him after disappearing in early 1999. Peter is going to look older, a year wiser, a lot could change in a year and that worried Steve the most.
Thor gave a wide smile, “Stay strong nephew, we are closer now than ever!” he stood tall next to Peter’s bed. “I will not tell your father’s that you are staying in this…” Thor looked over his shoulders, back and forth, “in this, less than the acceptable Stark standard.” Peter nodded in thanks to his Uncle’s silence. “Sleep as best as you can dear Nephew.” Peter rolled over on his side, pulling the coarse blanket over his shoulders.
briefcase handle. The slightly too wide suit sat just off of Tony’s shoulders, shrinking his frame, his youthful features in an old man’s office. He looked so innocent, his boyish charms contrasting with the wood and crystal decor of his father’s office.
Steve tightened his grip and so did Tony’s subconsciously with his grip on Peter. “I don’t want to hear another word about your wrong opinion of your son. Tony is my friend, he cares about my wellbeing unlike you. Tony took me to the Smithsonian after I spoke to Dugan and Morita, He showed me my mom’s recipe book, on display, He showed me that not everything was lost from my life, Did you that Howard? Of course not. You thought throwing me into a battleground would fix everything!”
Rhodey inspected the queue to get into the club as a regular, he could see it fading off into the distance, since the locals had heard Tony start was out and about in Boston again, they turned up dressed to impress. A newly minted and single millionaire. Rhodey wanted to spit in all their faces.
“Well, that’s kind of you Stane but I’m more interested In everything female but if you have a sister, she’s more than welcome to join us for drinks.” A cheeky smirk appeared on Tony’s face. Stane’s smile dropped and he dropped his arms. “See you next week Anthony, you should appear in more boardroom meetings. I think Howard would like that.” He bumped Tony’s shoulder on the way out of Peter’s room. They heard the front door slam 30 seconds later.
Rhodey glared at the oversized, idiotic, absolutely useless bouncer. “For the last time. I am Tony Stark’s friend. I am here, right now. To take him home. So let me through.” The bouncer just let out a gruff of air from the side of his mouth. Rhodey was not amused. He’d been hanging around outside Grande Errore Club for the past forty minutes or so, Tony had texted him begging him to come save him from himself. Usually he would have played this off as Tony trying to get him to join him on a night out, the classic, ‘well, you’re here now Rhodey, so you might as well stay!’
It was like a punch in the gut. He had to land on his knees but he was only off balance for a moment, he stood tall shield at his side, ready to face the ten or so guard with their weapons pointing at him. Peggy pushed through the security line, followed closely by Pierce. Steve raised his chin, ready to put them in their place. “What are you doing here!” Steve tilled his head, face trained into a scowl. “I told you, I would come get my son if you hadn’t brought him here.” Steve glared directly at Peirce, “ Where is he.”
“Director Carter. Mr Stark. Didn’t think you would be joining us after your fall out with Captain America.” Fury titled his head, sarcasm might as well have been tattoo on his forehead. “Fury! Good to see you again! Acting super shady as always.” Tony pushed past him to walk down the ramp, Peggy followed closely, whispering between herself and Fury. Tony rolled his eyes, leading the way towards the compound. The security guard eyed him up and down, eyes wide in surprise, “You’re, you’re Tony Stark!?” He smiled in return, taking the man’s hand quickly to shake it, “and you are…” Tony leaned in to read the man’s name badge, “Stewart! Good to meet you Stewart, keep up the good work, keeping everyone in line.” Tony threw a look over his shoulder towards Fury, who raised his eyebrow in response. “Yes Mr Stark! Of course Mr Stark!”
There were two blacked out SUV’s parked perpendicular to the aircraft’s ramp. Barton and Romanoff are directed to the first, whereas, Steve knew the second one was for him, It literally said Stark on the door. He corrected his posture, here we go, he muttered under his breath. Steve walked over to the car escorted by two shield soldiers who saluted him once he was at the car door. He returned it and climbed in, dropping the shield first, he was surprised to not see Howard but Peggy. “Director.” Steve said while he shut the car door behind him. He sat in the seat next to the door. Peggy sat watching him in the seat next to the other door. “Drive.” A quiet ‘Yes Ma’am’ could be heard from the front. Peggy pressed a button to raise the partition between them and the drive.
“I’m just happy for you, you’re a very different man from the one that’s running around just now.” Natasha wrapped her hands around the large coffee mug, giving a light blow to cool off the top before her first sip. Steve drew in a quick breath through his nose, creating a quiet whistle. “I can’t remember this, neither can Tony or the family to be completely honest. It’s worrying, I don’t know what’s changed I don’t know what’s going to happen to us when we get home but we are going, no matter what.”
Tony looked away from Peggy, she was suppose to be on his side but Steve didn’t even know what was going on? He was alone for months because his aunt Peggy wanted Steve to produce the
“Uh… Yeah, whoops…” Peter fucked up. He knew it, this was a bad idea. What else has he changed now! He’s ruined his dad’s college experience and now he’s going to hate Peter for calling him gay and hate that Peter knows abo….
“He wants you to throw it for him.” Tony said, sitting down legs apart, leaning back into the chair with his arms crossed, using his heels to slightly move the chair around. Sat on the black, rolling desk chair by the ancient looking desktop computer, Tony was observing their interactions.
“Yes Jarvis, I have eaten this week… I know its early but I did sleep. Don’t worry I have a friend around…he’s very interesting… I don’t care what Roger’s thinks at the moment, he doesn’t care about me or our friendship.” Tony had a smirk on his face while talking to Jarvis, playing with the cord of the phone. Peter never knew the man version of Jarvis but his Dad spoke well of him, said he practically raised him. “Oh, we were just up having a catch up, weren’t we Peter?” Peter eyes shot up to Tony who had a devious smirk on his face, “Tell him what you want Jarvis, he isn’t speaking to me and I don’t want him here. So you can tell ‘Captain Rogers’ to go fuck himself!.. sorry Jarvis, speak to you later.” Tony slowly placed the phone back on the stand on the wall.
He turned to face Peter, who had begun to doodle on the edge of the note pad while Tony was on the phone.
“What the FUCK?!” Tony called out. “Did he get anything?” Tony ran through to his room to check. Peter shut the window and asked Karen to investigate the crime scene. “Peter, would you be able to put on the Spider-Mask, So I can use your enhanced lenses to scan?” Karen asked. “Oh Yeah!” Peter had totally forgotten he had the suit on him, Pulling out the mask from the compartment, he pulled it on over his head and watched Karen analysis the room for evidence. Tony came in as Peter was completing the scan of the room, he stood staring at Peter. Peter let out a confused, “What, What is it?”
Tony spotted Barton and Peter and jumped up and ran towards them. He took Peter into a crushing hug, gripping the back of his hair. “Are you alight!?” He pulled back and taking in the sight of Peter before punching his sides and added some strong slaps for good measure, “What, Were, You, Thinking!?” hitting Peter’s side between each word. “That was incredibly stupid! I don’t care what you do when you are back home! NEVER do that again to me!”
Not much was said once Howard was involved, he would rather eat his dinner in silence, this was one of the quietest dinners Peter has ever had in the Stark mansion, it hit him all at once, this was the last time the Stark family would be together. He closed his eyes and he took a bite of the turkey. He couldn’t whistle at the dinner table, even he would get strange looks for that, so he focused on the sound of Jarvis’ foot tapping very gently under the table.
Peter walked in taking in the sight of the expansive white room, the grand piano sitting front and centre, in the bay windowed area. Peter dropped the board games down on to the large glass coffee table, moving some of the magazines out of the way, noticing that the covers were exclusively of Howard. Peter flipped them over.
Peter continued to un-pack his supplies out onto the desk and bed. This was one of his two recovery nights a week, when he had time to sleep in a normal bed and hide from Shield for a couple of days before jumping back into camping in the forests. Finally finished unpacking the duffle bag, Peter grabbed the kettle and made his way back into the kitchen/bathroom/washing room. Filling it up he set it to boil on the stand. He sighed, rubbing his elbows with some soap to stop them from drying out again, he made his way back to his bed for the night.
November. 1991.” Thor kneeled down in front of Peter, “Peter, Its only been 12 days for us. You only left 12 days ago Nephew, this is most concerning.” Even Peter sat up at the information. “Wait, wait!  What? How is that possible?!” Thor looked down to the ground ashamed of his answer. “We do not know.”
“Why would you do that Tony!?” Steve looked flabbergasted, “I can protect you I swear, I will take more bullets if that is what is necessary, please don’t make me leave T.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s chest and Steve did the same on top of Tony’s arms. “I can’t watch you get shot on my behalf, not again, you said you were the Captain to protect the little guy, well, that guys going to kill more people besides me, I want you doing what you do best, finding the bad guy and beating them up.”
Tony smiled back at his assistant, fixing his tie and adjusting his sunglasses as he made his way down the hallway to his father’s old office. Taking in a shaky breath in the silence of the corridor. He clenched his fist, the corridor seemed to tighten in on him, he stopped dead in his tracks when a blonde man walked across his path in the hallway. Not Steve, he thought to himself, Steve would have stopped, looked at him, maybe even smiled. Or. maybe he would have ignored him, Steve was decent at giving him the silent treatment until he apologised but Tony furrowed his brow at the thought. If anyone had to apologise this time, it was Steve, his father was murdered. Steve’s best friend’s dad was murdered, or maybe it was just Steve’s best friend.
The doorbell rang and Peter jumped up and jogged to the door, opening the door, he was surprised to see Agent Coulson standing within centimetres of him, holding the two pizza boxes. The surprised of Peter’s morning had made him forget that this was the Phil Coulson in front of him and He. Had. Hair!  Who thick flowing locks, same basic smile though. “Next time you order pizza, please consider you have 3 of us outside as well.” Peter felt terrible, “Oh my gosh, so sorry Phil, I should have remembered, just this morning and everything… I’m so sorry, I can call them back?” Phil didn’t let anything show on his face, but internally he was caught off guard that the kid knew his first name, but he let his face soften a bit, “Not to worry, we called as soon as you finished your call. Enjoy.”
“When did they stop working for you…?” Steve noticed Peter staring at the star on the Captain America suit, “Since the serum kicked in, I can take them, they just do little to nothing. Tony’s been trying to make me some for a year or so now to help.” Steve sighed and leaned back against the counter, “It sucks but I can shrug off most explosives so there has to be a trade-off.”
He’d considered going out but with the risk of being spotted too great, poor Karen had been relegated to running possible return home plans for the last couple of months. Peter made sure his wallet was ready, he couldn’t open any bank accounts, due the fact he hadn’t been born yet so he was carrying a lot of cash that he’d earned around with him. He also made sure everything was switched off in his room before grabbing his clothes and taking them to the shower.
“And T …Tony as well? He’s my best friend…” Steve stuttered out. Peter’s face softened, bottom lip opening slightly surprised that his Pop would have ever been this nervous.
His senses were on fire, he tried to focus on himself, but they kept going further and further. He could hear the whistle of the wind through the keyhole in the front door, the scratch of Howard’s pen in his office, his mumblings were as loud as jet engine in his ears. He couldn’t get it to stop, the noises outside the house, the birds and the wind. He was going to pass out or die, which ever came first. Karen’s voice was in the mix somewhere. Peter, please listen to this file. Captain Roger’s prepared for this.” Peter took a deep breath and held it in. Keeping his eyes tightly shut. “Peter, I made this in the event that the serum takes full effect for you. Your Dad warned me that it wasn’t likely to happen, but I want to make sure you’re prepared, just in case… I’m not around when it happens…”
had any common sense this place was now a bad memory for Peter. His tightened his grip around Peter’s shoulder, Peter had fallen asleep pretty quickly once they’d hit the road, and that left him alone with his thoughts, or a single one to be specific, Bucky was alive. His best friend was alive, and likely still alive in his time, a new mission that he was going to have to pass by Tony.
Steve Rogers was marching his way through the dance floor crowd towards him and Tony. Oh Shit. Peter could tell he was still in his classic uniform, but it was hidden a large zip grey Shield hoodie. He had his ‘Captain America, don’t mess with me face on’ as the crowd parted, giving him dirty looks as he walked through. Peter couldn’t make a mistake here, he had to get his Pop’s to help him with Tony.
“No one stayed there, It was left empty and if I suddenly went back to 1945, then … I just wouldn’t be home… but you kid, you have a great big family by the looks of It, I could even say I’m jealous of them. You’re parents miss you, your dad looked like he’d been up all night finding a way to bring you home, you’re other dad was right beside him the whole way, I haven’t got anyone back in 45’ to bring me home, I have Tony, right now in 91’ and I think that’s all I could take at the moment.”
“Awesome! Glad he’s alright! Dad will be happy about that,” Peter reached over for some cereal that was in the middle of the white marble island counter, “So, what’s happening with that  gauntlet? Where are my dad’s anyway?”  Peter poured himself a bowl of cereal with milk and turned on the bar stool to face Peggy who had moved to tidy up on the other side of the kitchen. “The alien gauntlet has stopped releasing energy at the compound but the liquid your father describe is missing from the device. We assume it was used to create the electrical energy that was discharging in the lab. As for your fathers, they are taking a walk together around the ground after their … enthusiastic night together…” Peggy hesitated and rolled her eyes, clearly having been disturbed last night. Peter screwed up his face dramatically. “EW, GROSS, nope didn’t need to know that Aunt Peggy thanks for that, I was having breakfast, way to ruin it!” As if on cue Steve and Tony walked in the room. Tony in one of his many suits, this one was a deep navy colour with a black shirt on. Steve was sporting black trousers and a light blue shirt tucked in, with his signature sleeve rolled up to his elbows. Steve was stared at his son while he entered the large kitchen area. Caught off guard by the sheer similarity between his son and Tony in that moment, Steve felt like he was back in ’91 staring at a hungover Tony, the way the hoodie sat crooked on his son’s shoulders and the hair that travelled in every direction and that was long enough to create volume off Peter’s head. Steve had a large grin on his face, thinking back to when Peter was born, he and Tony always argued about whose features Peter would inherit most from, Steve had hoped it would have been Tony’s, and in that moment, Peter was Tony’s spitting image and Steve couldn’t have imagined he would have been any happier to win in an argument with Tony. Tony didn’t even see it. “Hey, watch your breakfast around that hoodie, I want that back free of any gross food drips from you, you hear me kid!” Tony wrapped his arm around Peter’s shoulders and squeezed a hug out of his son. Peter leaned into his Dad as Pops walked round to his other sided, reached for a red apple out of the fruit bowl and took a bite out of it. “Aunt Peggy was just telling me about your loud ass fun last night with Pops,” Peter looked up to his Dad’s face as Peggy stifled a laugh. Steve stopped mid-bite of his apple. Tony turned to meet Peter’s eyes, “Sorry, not sorry kiddo.”
They enjoyed breakfast in peace, relaxing in the autumn morning. The soft glow of the sun shining in through the two windows of the living room and kitchen. Tony was staring out of the window, lost in a world of his own when he said, “We should head out of the apartment, I can show you around campus and we can get some food, bedsheets and clothes for you. I could introduce you to Rhodey as well, just as like my new flat mate or something.” Peter hummed in agreement, he liked the sound of that, as much as he travelled with his parents over the years he’d never been to Boston and with the rare opportunity of exploring in the 90s as an added bonus. They both helped to clean up and place the dishes away. Peter noticed that it was way cleaner than it was yesterday when he arrived. Maybe him being here would be good for Tony, he hadn’t cleaned since Steve left for Shield and it had showed. They went to their respective rooms to get changed for the day. Peter decided on a white t-shirt and a pair of Tony’s jeans, they were too large so he borrowed on of his Pop’s belts to hold them in place and his Chuck Taylors. Peter waited in the living room for his dad. Tony walked out wearing black jeans, t-shirt and boots but also a very large oversized jumper, which had red, blue and green patches all over it with a black under colour. Peter was caught off guard and started to laugh uncontrollably. Tony gave a confused look to Peter.
“Come on in Peter, its cold outside and you need to meet Ana!” Tony turned around pushing open on of the doors, Peter could hear Tony voice echo in the large mansions hallway. “ANA! I’m back!” As Peter made his way up to stairs with Jarvis, he could hear the clicking of heels making their way towards Tony. When he finally crossed the threshold of the mansion, he found Tony getting checked over by Ana Jarvis. “Ah, Peter this is my wife, Ana Jarvis, Mr Stark is kind enough to let her stay with me here.” Peter smiled and tried to straighten up his jumper again to look presentable for Ana.
Even Romanoff opened her mouth slightly in a gasp, quickly looking towards Clint, who turned his own head back to her, he didn’t know how this was going to go down. “You asked me to protect Tony, when he’s in danger right now… and so is Howard. Where are they now?!” Steve stood up straight, hands gripping the centre of his belt. “Howard is an hour out. He’s just landed in DC, he will drive over here, drop it off, pick up another security detail and then hide in one of his many islands, as far as I know Tony is with his family.” Steve shook his head repeatedly. “Put me on security detail, now.”
Peter used his hand to cover up his laugh, moving to stand with Natasha and Clint. “Peter, I’m sorry but your Dad, is damn fine!” Clint stood staring lovingly at his Pops, letting out a snort. His Pops turned to look at them and back to Steve, who stammered as he asked, “You’re Peter’s Dad.”
Steve dropped to his knees. He couldn’t find a clear thought to follow. Peggy fell into her chair, “Where is the transport package now?” Peggy stuttered out as best as she could. “Missing Director.” Clint followed the Commander out into the hall with his computer set up. It’s the least he could do for Steve. If the Commander didn’t mention Tony, then it could be hope for the best. Romanoff just watched Steve, his head bowed his hands loose by his side. She stepped closer to him, she didn’t know what to do for him.
The next couple were taken in succession in the old flat, the pair surrounded by screws and metal sheets, clearly in the middle of a project of some sorts. But the photos that really caught Peter’s eyes were the ones of his parents. The first couple were of the two goofing around in Tony’s room at the mansion, Steve had taken the first couple of photos, Tony was kneeling on the bed, posing with the Captain America Shield, the mirror showed Steve relaxing on a couch that used to be in the room, his face wrinkled because he laughing so much. The next couple seem to have passed the camera onto Tony, Tony was in a workout plank position, Steve was dead lift Tony in this position by his lower leg and arm. The pair were giggling like idiots and Peter couldn’t help the smile that was forming on his face.
Tony just stood frozen, eyes wide shock. He stared into Peter’s face. Tony pushed off the wall and slowly moved towards Peter, who was near hysterical at this point. Tony took him into a hug against him. Tony just knew it. When the sensors went off this morning something big had come through the radiation energy detector, he knew it, he just knew it, but here was this kid, not much young than Tony on the floor in his apartment. From his future! He had a kid, who seemed smart and kind, probably due to his mother but who cared, he had a family, or at the very least someone who looked up to him.
Steve’s ears were ringing, he could hear everything, he needed to focus. He chanted to himself. He stilled his movements, keeping his eyes closed, trying not to squint or twitch to show he was conscious. The guard was marching back and forth outside his door. Steve took a deep breath in through his teeth. Exhaling, he opened his eyes slowly, giving his super hearing some boundaries, he let out a quiet whistle. He closed his eyes, recovering from the knock out serum. The colour began to fade back into his vision behind his eyelids. Opening his eyes once more he took in his surroundings. He found himself strapped to a metal contraption of some kind. His head held in between to metal headrests, his arms strapped out to his side and his feet bound together at his ankles. Strapped down in metal. He tested with his right arm to life himself out of the restraints. The metal creaked under the pressure. He wanted to roll his eyes, they never could get anything strong enough to hold him in place.
“Moving back to Campus, Wing-head, Director’s tantrum, I mean… orders. Security in the shadows though, if that makes you feel better.” Tony sarcasm bled through at the mention of his father’s orders.
His thoughts made him fall behind, he ran along the cat walk, leaping over the edge, he swung on the overhead piping, to land on a lower level of the cat walk. Bow drawn again, to watch over Steve.
The shooting stopped. The sounds of sirens echoed in the distance. Steve’s head lulled. He knew he was going to pass out soon if he didn’t stop the bleeding. He opened one of the pouches on the back of the belt, pulling out a handkerchief and pulling it round to his wound. He crumpled the handkerchief into his hand and shoved it roughly into the wound. He let out an involuntary hiss at the pain. Natasha rolled her eyes towards Steve “God, you’re actually a grandpa, handkerchief to complete it.”
Peter then spotted Steve standing to attention as he would a general, nowhere near as relaxed as Peter had seen him last night. Steve was looking with his eyes anywhere but Tony and Director Carter. “Ah yes you, Peter, you will need to come with us, I want to know more about who my godson is staying with.” Aunt Peggy raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow with a knowing look to Peter.  How the fuck did she know who he was??? Peter had no choice but before he could argue against the handcuffs or something along those lines wouldn’t be necessary, but Tony spoke up.
Peter knew what Tony meant but he wanted to go home, desperately. Peter slowly made his way into the room to catch up with Fury and Coulson, who were discussing charts with Director Carter. She turned as Peter, Tony and Steve approached her. “I’m glad you’re here Peter, you need to tell us, is this like the one that sent you here?” The small team around the Director stopped and looked directly at Peter, he drew in a breath through his teeth, “I didn’t get the best look at it but it’s the same pattern and colouration as the one I know.” The scientists all dived back into their charts.
“NO! Peter please don’t touch this! I don’t know what it will do, until I know I can bring you back safely, I don’t want you to touch this! Are you safe?! Are you with Shield, am I there?” Tony held his arm out, palm raised to stop Peter from walking forward towards him, a few tears in his own eyes. “Yeah Dad! I’m ok, you are taking care of me, we are in the compound of Shield right now… I’ll be ok, please… I just want to come home.” Peter stepped forward towards the crack, Peggy, Steve and Tony raising a cautionary hand to stop Peter from getting too close.
“Well we need to find out where the first plan is. If you think its suspicious we need to find it first.” Clint turned to pick up more papers. Steve stood frozen, fidgeting with his glove straps. He had a choice to make, go find the source of the problem, whatever the solider was looking for it could be at this bunker. Or go and protect Tony. A personal conflict for him. This had never really happened to him before, what he wants to do is not the best decision, but he actively stopping himself from turning the truck around to go find Tony and hide him from Howard.
The pair nodded at Steve’s answer, “So, I’m guessing its Stark on the other end? Also Wing-head?” Clint took the large bite of his food, chewing obscenely loudly. “Yeah, made them so we could call each other without Howard knowing, when I joined Shield last year, I left it at the flat… wasn’t my best idea to leave it behind.” Natasha continued to watch Steve and noticed he wasn’t making a move to answer it, “Wing-head is a nickname, during my first tour selling war bonds, I had this very cheap and
Holding Howard up by his shirt with just one arm Steve didn’t even look Howard in the eye. “you lost the right to call me ‘Ste’ in 1945. You lost the right to call me your friend today. You didn’t get to choose my friends in 1945 and you don’t get to choose them now Stark. I agreed to your deal on the grounds you leave Tony alone, you let him live in peace, free from you. I want you to remember this. When Tony comes home for Christmas, you must treat him with respect.”
Checking over his shoulder one last time he held down the button and gently called out. “Shell-head to Wing-head, you there big guy?” Tony rested the device against his lips as his elbow leaned on the arm rest, he waited a minute or so, taking in the view out the aircraft window.
He reached over and turned the remote on for the small tv. “Peter, I’ve run the numbers, we need your fathers to open the portal home from their side. But we need to make sure we are in the optimal location. I suggest at the compound.” Peter turned his head to give his attention to the mask, “I’m not going until the last second. IF I get home, I don’t want to see anyone, I’ll break into the compound and make my way home.” He turned his attention back to the news, effectively ending the conversation with his mask.
“That kid is going to get himself killed chasing the shooter!” Steve struggled through the pain, while not life threatening it hurt like fucking hell. Steve tried to get up but wasn’t thinking straight when he tried to use his injured arm to get up, he yelped in pain and fell back down with Tony.
“I’m so sorry I failed you Tony, you’re not alive here, not anymore, that was my fault, I just was caught up in Peter and Shield and you were alone with your parents I-“ Tony circled his wrist back around to silence Steve once again, “Wait wait wait! What are you on about! I’m upstairs?”
“Peter Stark, I am asking you and you alone, is this the portal that sent you here and will you just step near it?” Peggy’s voice started loud, and by the end of the sentence she had relaxed to a normal volume, but the room had gone silent.
Steve noticed once again that Peter had been true to his word, he knew this compound like the back of his hand, he was leading him back to the main entrance without even realising it, “So, this,” Steve gestured with both hands above his head at the wide expanse of an open area they were walking through, “is home to you? Bit. cold is it not?” Peter looked around at the area, “yeah, just now this is the boxing area for training, down the hall has... will have the back hallway to my uncle’s lab.”
Steve adjusted the straps on his gloves. He reached over the middle console and pated Clint’s shoulder, gripping it on the last pat. “We can do this. It’ll be easy. I hope.” Clint did a double take as he climbed out the car. Rolling his shoulders and cricking his neck, he jumped out the driver’s side.
“Aunt Peggy, can I … I have to ask, what’s…”Tony sighed. his shoulders slumping down, he picked up the briefcase and gestured his arm out for Peggy to make her way to the door. “Is Steve ok?” She stopped just short of opening the doors, Peggy turned with her hand still on the brass handle, to look back at her godson. Tony stood with both his hands on the worn tan leather
Peggy had sent the special ops team out to collect the kid, but it was made clear very quickly when they found two of the team unconscious and their tactical vest missing, that the kid had Shield training. Not unexpected of Steve to have the kid trained in case of kidnapping, she was surprised that Tony had agreed to such a high level of training, Steve was special operations at Level 9-11 combat training, Tony through his own hobbies was probably at level 3-5. Higher than he would ever need at a civilian level. But Peter, as far as the reports were coming in, was sitting near enough Level 11-13. He was taking out her highest-level operatives, he was ghost and he was seventeen. He shouldn’t be able to do this, she would need to get Steve and his team back soon to find the kid, but… that would mean telling them that the kid is alive.
“Dads? As in plural” Tony asked. He knew the kid would falter but just not that easily but now he knew he was looking for a guy, which narrows it down for him, Tony has been opened minded about being bi for a couple of years now, yeah society isn’t that accepting but he’s a Stark, always the morally contentious route taken.
“Peter, that was the coolest moment of my life so far.” Tony said in a sort of daze. “Let’s get packed I want to see how good her choice was. Can…” Tony hesitated, “Can you help me with Steve’s room just now?” Peter nodded, grabbing some empty boxes and heading down the hallway. They started with the desk, nothing on much interested until they came to the bottom drawer, Peter reached in to grab an old army tin box as he pulled it up Tony called out gently, “Careful that stuffs from the 20’s,30’s and 40’s, it’s all Steve has left of his mother and father that isn’t behind a museum wall.” Peter gently handed the box over to Tony who wrapped it in a couple of t-shirts to protect it, “I promised him once when I was in charge of Stark Industries I would get his stuff back from the display at the Smithsonian, no matter the cost, he said don’t be ridiculous but I can see it hurts him a bit when his mother’s secret recipe book is on display.” Peter wanted to cry, he’d never seen anything from his Grandmother on his Pop’s side, but he could imagine that his Pop’s would have loved to try and make something out of it just to try it for his family to taste. “He’s just glad it’s not on display on the cookie recipe page, I think he would have broken in and stole it if they had.” Tony slightly chuckled at the thought.
Rolling his shoulders, he opened up the duffle bag. Pulling out his sleeping bag and pillow, chucking them up to the top of the bed. He pulled out a black top and grey joggers he’d reserved for sleeping in. He pulled out the instant noodle pot from the bottom of the bag. Silently grateful he’d found a local supermarket with no security cameras, so he could stock up a few days of food and supplies. He’d considered trying to find a way to get the necessary ingredients to make more web fluid, but it could get him noticed and he wasn’t running out in anyway, but he knew if he didn’t find a way to continue the supply he’d be out in a few months.
“Captain, I’m sending you with this... dynamic duo to investigate the scene, Tony and Peter will return to your apartment with external protection from Agents Coulson and academy agent Morse.” Peggy had directed to this to Steve with no; ifs, buts or when’s about his instructions, Steve realises Tony had asked her. He couldn’t protect Tony and Peter if he was too far, especially if this lead was cold. He’s going to a crime scene. Where the shooter, whoever they are, will not have left any traces of evidence, that’s a guarantee but Tony wanted him to go, it was his job, a kids in danger.
Steve rubbed his hand up and down Peter’s back slowly, creating circles with his thumb. The motion reminded him of the late nights when Peter was an extremely small child but gosh darn did he have a set of lungs on him. He’d cry all night if he could!
“I don’t know but it’s fine right? We will figure it out!” Always the positive take with this Tony, his Dad was slightly less accepting of a positive outcome nowadays. Peter looked drained, the past couple of days finally setting in that he just wasn’t going home anytime soon without doing something about it. Tony decided Peter needed cheering up, of course the worst idea to choose from, would be Tony Stark’s. “We should head out, let’s get a beer at the student Union, cheap and cheerful, to celebrate moving in!” Peter gave his father incredulous look. “But! I’m 17 and I definitely don’t pass for 21, even my Pop’s doesn’t think so! I can’t we should just stay in! yeah stay in!”
The pair made their way up to the black metal and deep oak bench. Engraved with a family crest in the centre, vines, flowers and branches surrounding the entire design. Peter thought it looked amazing, running a finger along the vines, as he sat down, he followed it back to the centre crest design, “Its family’s crest, they didn’t have one until Howard asked my father what was most important to him, so Howard commissioned this to be made…” She looked lost in memory at a time long gone by, “He was a good man back then. Nowadays he’s more focused on all the money in the world, rather than moments like that one.” She gestured to the crest on the bench.
Natasha frowned when she threw herself into Tony’s chair, “and that is an excuse, How exactly?” Leaning back and crossing her legs on his desk. Tony half sat on the edge of Howard’s desk. He needed to start calling it, his desk, Howard wasn’t coming back for it now. “What does this change? Howard and my mom are dead and I’m here doing my job. You don’t need to be here, awesome, thanks for telling me my information is bullshit, go do spy things or whatever. Just leave me alone.” Natasha didn’t move a muscle. Tony just sighed. “Why are you here?” He took another large drink of his glass. Finishing the contents off, he made his way over to pour another drink.
“What happened to your wallet anyway?” Steve pulled out and handed Clint the fifty dollar bill. “Oh, nothing but why spend mine when I can get yours.” and with that Clint smirked and jogged out of the car park and down the street. Steve shook his head to himself and pulled the passenger door shut again. Left alone with his thoughts again. He shouldn’t let them wander, but he couldn’t help himself. He was heading back to his apartment, the place where his parents started their lives together and the last place Steve stayed with Tony, his stuff was going to be all over the place. Steve closed his eyes and rested his head back against the headrest.
The room fell to a deafening silence. Scientists hid subconsciously behind their desks but peaked over the top of their monitors,“If you thought he was dangerous, I am far worse.” Steve took a step forward in Peggy’s direction, the guns clicked loudly as they turned off the safety lock. “Where is Peter?” Director Pierce stepped forward. “I’ve had enough of your dramatics, guards arrest this man.” Peggy turned her head round to Pierce but Steve was much quicker, grabbing Pierce by the neck, holding him up and off his feet, he squeezed lightly, walking slowly down the room towards the door. “I’m sick and tired of Shield, thinking my son is a weapon, someone they can control. I’m taking him home. Far away from your
Natasha rounded the corner from the kitchen, wiping her hands on the tea towel, Peter glanced up over his forehead to look up towards Natasha, Steve looked up from Peter, he continued to run his hand through his sons hair. “Dinner’s ready if you want some?” Peter looked up to his Pops as he looked down to Peter, they both shared a look for a brief moment before simultaneously responding, “Oh yes, Please that would be perfect.” Natasha raised an eyebrow at the pair, who had broken into a quiet fit of giggles. She turned over on her leaning shoulder.
Tony had left to get changed, and when he came back, he was about ready to just carry Peter out of the apartment before he paced a hole in the flat’s floor. “Come on, relax enjoy it, you don’t have to drink if you don’t want to, just a couple of drinks and we’ll come home, ok?”
truck, bringing an alternative version of himself and his son to the future, his unconscious best friend he hasn’t seen in a couple decades because, you know, he died falling off a train over a cliff saving his life and now has appeared back into his life.
Tony couldn’t take his eyes off of Peter, who stool wrapped in Peggy’s arms, clutching tightly his Pop’s glove between his fingers. Tears running down his checks dripping quickly to the floor. Steve tried not to show it, but he even had tears in his eyes. The kid looked devasted, to have been so close to home and have it right in front of him, to have it taken away indefinitely. He couldn’t really process what he had just seen, a much older Tony Stark, who had exhausted himself to find a way to get his son home, his facial hair and general appearance unkept. But the biggest surprise was of himself at the end.
Peter turned to his Uncle form, “Hey, Thor what’s the update?” Thor moved them over to a bench further along the path.  “Pace has continued since your departure Nephew. Your dad believes he is close to finding an answer as to how to bring you home.” Peter sighed as he sat down. “Your hair is long young nephew. I didn’t know it would grow that fast?” Peter leaned back into the bench, throwing his hands into the front of his hoodie, stretching his legs out. “I’ve not had my hair cut since I got here, I really need to its been like 2 months.” Thor jumped up and stared off into the distance again. Peter just stayed in his relaxed position, watching as his Uncle stood frozen in place.
Maria stormed her way through to the living room. Peter stayed next to Ana, who was trying her best not to hear the yelling through the walls. “Howard is so harsh to the boy, he just wanted a friend.” Peter kept quiet, next to her, “you wouldn’t be able to fix that would you?”
He quickly made his way into Tony’s room, finding a white t-shirt, joggers and some fresh socks. He turned and ran down the stairs, by the time he’d reached the bottom, Howard was gone. He shoulder turned round the corner into the kitchen, Tony was still staring in the distance, Maria petting his hair down as Jarvis tweezed the last piece of glass out. Ana handed him the needle, Tony didn’t even flinch, but Peter had to look away. Maria took the clothes out of his hands, they had cut Tony’s t-shirt earlier, So Maria and Ana helped each other to pull the new white t-shirt over his head and carefully through his arm. Ana carefully handed Tony, the joggers and socks. She guided him towards her room and shut the door behind him. All of them in the kitchen stood quietly, Peter sat down in a chair in the corner, playing with the edge of his jacket.
I'm back!  Surprise! Apologies for taking so long on this chapter! Don't really have an excuse for the delay but rest assured we are in the endgame now ;). Hope you all enjoy this chapter and have your tickets book for next week!
Natasha rubbed her hands up and down her face, trying to clear her mind, there was a dead man in front of her, apparently. Damn she hated liars, especially Shield Directors. “Steve thinks you’re dead Tony.” Tony stopped typing. “Where do you think we’ve been the last two months?” Tony reached over the side of his chair, placing his thumb print on the handle of the drawer, it made a computerized beep before opening the lowest drawer. Pulling out two notebooks and some very classified looking files, which even Natasha knows that Tony shouldn’t have.Tony opened the classified file, spreading its contents out on to Howard’s desk. “Here,” he said pointing to a document near the edge of his desk. “you checked in with Shield, Austrian branch.” Natasha shook her head. “We’ve been in Russia and Canada for the last three weeks. These have been falsified.” She sat forward in her chair, “Tony, someone knows you’ve been looking at these.”
is going to be annoyed at him for … putting them on and meeting them half way at Shield compound in 1992.
“Server security in 1991 is not on the same level as I am. If we return home your Dad would be pleased to have these files to hand.” Peter would have spat out his drink if he could.
