“With pleasure. But first, a proper hello.” John didn’t move but gestured for Sherlock to come to him. He did half laying on John’s reclined form and half on the sofa, John wrapped an arm around the slim waistline and pulled Sherlock close. The first brush of their lips was like relief.  They sighed into each other in the slow exploration of mouths and tongues . John reached up and twined his fingers into Sherlock’s curls, pressing his palm to the back of his skull. Slow and exploratory was turning into hot and desperate. All that their relationship boiled down to. Need. A need that felt like it could never, ever be filled.
“No!” Sherlock chuckled feeling warm and relaxed. "I’m a consulting detective for New Scotland Yard.”
John could hear the rush of relief that he shared with his sister. Voltaire was the type of mad bastard that you can’t help but love, and each one of them did.
Our boys had just come off a beautiful and much needed holiday when Victor Trevor, showed up and caused a major upheaval.
John’s anger transformed into a desperate desire. Had John not been here at this exact moment he could have lost him. He pulled Sherlock into a kiss that left them dizzy. Both men realized how close they had come to ruin and they attacked, fueled by the adrenaline that only a brush with death can provide. They needed this. To feel this. It was quick, it was rough and it was perfect.
Sherlock blinked at John wordlessly. What the hell was this man made of? How had Sherlock gotten so lucky as to be loved by a man as determined as he?
Sherlock woke slowly at first, but the throb in his temple and the harsh damp pavement against his face sent tendrils of recognition screaming through every pore of his body. John! John had been...where? Behind him? Yes. But...that would mean...
“Fuck Sherlock.” John allows his body to adjust and revels in the fullness. Push and slide. Slowly deeper.
"No, we don't." Sherlock purred the words and pulled John down to rest the length of his body against Sherlock's hard frame. Desire like John had never know hammered throughout his body, his blood boiled and his cock ached.
“I’m sorry. Who?” John asked the question on pins and needles praying he was wrong.. Surly she didn’t mean...
"I do. But I doubt you would enjoy it as much as you think you would, John, it was a cruel little song thought up by idiotic prepubescent mongrels." A look creeped across John's face that Sherlock knew well.  "We were children John. You can't go kill them."
John moved to the other side of Sherlock’s neck, slender and still white in some places that John hadn’t assulted yet with his teeth or tongue or lips. Kisses and words were one and the same.
Move! John’s mind screamed at him.  John reached Sherlock on the floor and pulled him into his lap, Sherlock latched on with all his strength sobbing great anguished moans.
Founded by Mohammed Yusuf in 2002, the group has been led by Abubakar Shekau since 2009. From March 2015 to August 2016, the group was briefly aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Since the current insurgency started in 2009, Boko Haram has killed tens of thousands and displaced 2.3 million from their homes[22] and was ranked as the world's deadliest terror group by the Global Terrorism Index in 2015.
Sherlock was quiet. Mycroft caring was cringeworthy and put Sherlock very briefly in the awkward position of feeling something close to sympathy for his brothers plight. Sherlock sighed. He glanced out the window and caught sight of that robins egg blue sky that was all wrong.
Sherlock made it three blocks before he turned down an ally and slammed himself against a wall, sliding down to sit on the dank chilled pavement, folding his knees to his chest, he wailed. The pain was crushing, and his shuttering breaths burned his chest. Sherlock stayed there for hours. Screaming and crying into his coat sleeves hiccuping slight incoherent sounds. When he finally crawled out of the ally in the small hours of the gray London morning it was to find the nearest drug den.
John set about tidying the flat, the scrap having left it in more of a shambles then usual and with nothing else to do and so fell into thinking about he and Sherlock's burgeoning relationship. It seemed that the unattainable genius was finally his. Sherlock had folded sweetly into him last night as if it had been their way for a life time. The man was a vine, twisting and twinning his way around Johns body the same way he'd done to Johns heart all those years ago. He fit into the crook of Johns shoulder perfectly, the weight of him there creating a warm soothing pressure on his scar. They had slotted together from one position to another throughout the night subconsciously/consciously exploring each other, hands roaming and resting on warm exposed flesh, it had been dreamlike perfection. John, sign at the pleasant thoughts and noticed he was sitting in his chair. How did he get there? He wondered where Sherlock was in that moment.
"I don't know, it's not so bad." One corner of John's mouth turned up in a boyish grin.  Sherlock found that he was drawn in by that smile and felt pleasantly compelled to return it as well.
"Because you're a student here and Thomas can't be allowed to just basically bully you." Her porcelain face was red with anger.
"The dean would be more likely to expel me then defend me, once I deduced his two simultaneous affairs in front of both parties, my affairs stopped being important to him."
“Well let’s see. ‘I’ll take him from you, slit your throat and watch you bleed out.’” Sherlock repeated John’s words. “Passionate brutal and true to your word.” Sherlock drew back to splayed his hands on John’s chest and move his fingers over old scars.
“There is. Take your clothes off.” Sherlock leaned forward suddenly on the prowl. Now John laughed out right.
Sherlock had no words, his eyes were wild his lips worked in soundless disbelief, he took two steps, four...no more he staggered, a shaking exhale was all he had to offer, he crumpled to his knees in a loose wet heep a broken thing he sobbed soul deep and mournful trembling and curling in on  himself with sorrow.
“You were...dead.” Sherlock whispered. It hurt to say the words even in the face of their falsehood. “Mycroft...he...told me...you were...I came here...just to...be with you somehow. John...I thought you were...you were...” It was no use. The tears would have their way and clearly they were not done with him yet. Sherlock buried his face in John’s chest.
“What do you think Tiger. Should I kill them? Well not “I” kill them,  but have you kill them “I” kill them.”
*”At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18—, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library.”*
Sally had sidled up to Sherlock the second Lestrade was out of ear shot to spit her vile words at him. This was only one of the many things that made Sherlock dislike her. Never brave enough to be nasty to him in front of others, aside from Anderson, (who doggedly followed her lead) but always lurking waiting in the shadows like the coward that she was.
"Oh God." The words rushed out of John as a shaky exhale. To any on looker John would have appeared nervous. His breath was quick and he was nearly vibrating. But he was far from nervous. He was burning alive. His need to devour Sherlock was so great, John clenched and unclenched his hands at his sides trying to find some calm.
"Oh." Sherlock's eyes widen as a mind palace image of a naked John sprang to mind. Sherlock had seen John naked before, but far too briefly for Sherlock to have all the information to make a proper deduction. He needed more data. "Alright then. My turn."
“And will these commitments be...permanent?” Sherlock was too far gone to shy away from the implications of his question.
"Captain Watson, pleasssse tell me this call is finally about spine tingling pleasure and not mind numbing business."
"No. God no. Not my style. And even if it were, never with him. He's sleeping." John winked and headed off.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck. He's not in the park. He's in the revisor. It's a trap Lestrade." John felt his vision swim before his eyes.
When they reached the safe house they were greeted by Mercy, and Harbinger, the senior officer on site, and a full medical team at John’s request. His asset was carted off and properly tended to.
“So, Sherlock Holmes, what is it you do out there in the world when you’re not being captured and tortured by Russians?” John asked after he’d settled his knee between Sherlock's at the bar and ordered two glasses of Macallan 18 year old single malt scotch neat.
“Watson!” Someone else needed help. John turned to answer right into the path of a bullet. Pain ripped through his body blinding and hot. A black tunnel of confusion sucked John down. Why was he suddenly so cold? Where had the sounds of the battlefield gone? And why was everything...Sherlock? John’s thoughts echoed in his spinning head.
“Well good for us we have a man for that.” Her words dripped with sarcasm. “Do you know who that man is?”
"John." Sherlock's voice was imploring. He knew that John was going to pull the truth from him, he'd danced too close to the edge of it and John knew Sherlock's defenses were breached. All he could do was make a play for mercy. There would be none. John had seen the crack in the wall, and he meant to see it brought down. John fixed him with a look. Sherlock felt as if John had reached into his chest and taken a gentle hold of his heart. It was terrifying. It was John. "Are we a couple." John let the answer stand. He understood what it meant. Sherlock NEVER said a word when someone insinuated they were together. John had long since stopped wondering why, he'd speculated that it was because it made Sherlock uncomfortable, but John had never allowed himself to think about why. He had a good idea why. Actually better than good. He knew. Just as sure as he knew why he himself denied it so vehemently. The truth of it had been hard for John to face, but face it he had. And now it seemed that the young detective was ready to face it as well.
11pm Ruskin Park, covered walk. A small fire burned in what looked to be some kind of metal bowl. There was writing on the ground in front of the fire.
John, tossed the go bag in the back seat of the Land Rover and helped his asset to the passenger side. He walked back around and settled in the driver side.
"No you don't understand. It's not at all what you think." John took Sherlock's large hand in both of his. He looked down at the surprisingly delicate fingers and loved the dichotomy that was Sherlock Holmes. Male surly, yet some how not. Too graceful, and prim to be just a man. And far far too pretty. "I'm afraid that this is...overwhelming. I don't know, maybe moving too fast. And I literally don't want to hurt you."
"Well I suppose. I didn't notice you'd left." Sherlock's voice was soft and warm. Irene watched the scene in silence.
“And who do you think gets sent down those avenues Mr. Holmes? Me. The blunt instrument. As you so readily pointed out. The same man you requested for the exfill of your brother..."
Irene let herself in and sat about making the loudest cup of tea possible. When subtle clanging didn't do the job she dropped the empty kettle on the floor. Sherlock's eyes cracked open his voice heavy. "I hate you."
“Yeah, that’s the way of it when you fancy someone. They can do no wrong. Lest not for long anyway.” There it was. John cocked a half smile.
"Well, I guess that makes us stupid together, because I'm a doctor and I missed it too." John stepped right in Sherlock's path and held a glass of scotch out to him. Sherlock huffed, his shoulders visibly relaxed, and his lips involuntarily kicked up at the corners. He took the glass and just before putting it to his lips said.
"Fine. But you're not going to like the solution. If we stay, we stay together." Sherlock couldn't believe what his was suggesting, but it had to be done if John refused to leave.
“Now I get it. You like it. Me fresh from the field. In the field. Ooh you.” Both John’s hands found Sherlock’s curls now pulling him into a searing kiss coupled with grinding hips and throaty moans that left them both panting and hungry. John pushed away quickly and stood up grabbing his cock through his jeans. Sherlock rolled to his back and reached a hand up to join John’s. John let the wicked fingers work over him for a moment before he backed out of reach. Sherlock looked like a child who’d just had a lolli snatched away.
Sherlock often found himself regretting the fact that Irene had expertly deduced his attraction to John. She was rather good at spotting the things that people liked. She'd caught Sherlock on more then one occasion stop dead in his tracks just to watch John pass by. She had asked Sherlock countless times to go down to the pitch with her, and each time he had forced himself to decline. But today, in the sprit of truth or dare...
"Christ Sherlock! How can you be that big and that quite all at once?" John failed suprise when in truth his body was conspiring against him and his mind seemed inclined to follow if his deviant thoughts where any indication.
The auction was set up to take place in the main hall of the museum amid the grandeur of Pharaohs. Like everyone else Johns mobile was taken and replaced with a program and an unlocked cell. The program provided a lot number and a picture of each terrifying item up for bid. Bids were to be made on the cell to the pre-programmed number. At the end of bidding if you were the lucky winner you would be sent a time date and location with an accompanying bank account routing number.
You should know that nothing can keep me from you. So don’t imply that it’s been nearly two month as if I weren’t going to contact you. Nothing. Not the passage of time, not distance. Nothing. That’s what you need to know.
"I need to know if there are any repeat players. That person is most likely the one pulling the strings, and if not then they're someone's point man. We need those names."
Sherlock was pure abandon rocking his thin hips in timed responses to John's driving trusts. Sherlock's eerie beauty on full displaying in the grips of his passion, his curls were damp ringlets and his skin was a soft pink, John licked his lips watching Sherlock's dick jutting and bobbing from its nest of black, the sight was too much, John stilled Sherlock's hips with a vice grip and pounded up into a his slick heat...
“Hello John.”  Sherlock strolled into the room as if he own the place. John laughed to himself, in a sense he guessed he did. God he looked good. Black trousers so sinfully tailored the devil himself must have hand (hoof?) stitched them, white button front shirt crisp and strained suggestively across his chest.. Now he understood Mercy’s last words. Good luck indeed.
"Once you get rid of your moral blinders you may just be pleasantly surprised at what you're alright with Johnny boy."
"Then do them." The words were simple every day words and they shouldn't have made Sherlock feel a wash in heat, they shouldn't have made his breath heavy and his blood buzz in his ears, but they did.
Irene could feel the heaviness of Sherlock’s words through the text. She had to do something. She wasn’t sure if Sherlock would actually stop talking to her if she went to John, but it really was a risk she was had to take. She couldn’t call herself his friend if she allowed him to walk away from what she knew would be a full and happy life with John. And what the hell! She was after all quite the charmer, getting back into Sherlock’s good graces shouldn’t be all that hard.
John laughed. It was a lovely throaty vibration that took Sherlock by surprise. He could get use to invoking that sound. “Drink with me.”
John took the shot and decimated the mans right eye and the back of his head. Blood, bone and brains spattered the right side of Sherlock’s porcelain white face.
"Yes." Again, there was no space between ask and answer. Silent tears rolled over classic cheekbones.
"How could you not know how much I want you?" John bumped Sherlock's nose, cheek, lips with shadow kisses that weren't and hot ragged give and take. It was all John could do not to dig his hands into Sherlock's curls and devour him.
“Oh, well that’s aces! To have someone who can get past all that history, I mean just the needle use alone is enough to put most people off, let alone the drugs! This guy of yours must really be something. I’d love to met him.”
“That’s brilliant. And incredibly dangerous. Now I see how you fell into the hands of the Russian’s. I’m shocked as shit I didn’t have to come rescue you sooner. You live a very interesting life Sherlock Holmes.”
"If you must know John, cousin Brandabas, calls this his shag cabin. Hence the copious amounts of liquor and the unrealistic supply of condoms."
John sat himself up in the bed, in obvious pain but unhindered and just stared, more alive in that moment then he’d been in years. More afraid then he’d been on the battlefield and just as in love as the first day they’d kissed in uni.
“You misunderstand. A different dimension to the same brutality. Not changed. But different.” Sherlock continued his exploration as he spoke.
“Mmm. Really. Good news for the economy, what with the Brexit, and all.”  John spoke low into the barely there earpiece as he double cheeked his bow tie in the mirror and smoothed his hands over his jacket before he entered the grand ballroom.
“Donovan please don’t pretend that what you do in that head of yours passes for though.” Sherlock’s tone was dry.
"Nope." Sherlock popped the "p" with a nice loud smack. John giggled. He always loved it when Sherlock did that. It was silly and endearing, not to mention just how lovely it made his already perfect Cupid's bow mouth.
John, went through his night time routine as usual, when he was done he headed for Sherlock's room, a room he'd been in countless times, but tonight it felt different. The room seemed ethereal as if all the secrets luxuries of the room breathed their air into it and anyone who entered. To look at it things seemed rather simple, but John knew the posh secrets of this space. The bed itself was large, overly so for just one person, it was also garishly expensive, John had ripped the sheets off one day for Mrs.Hudson to launder to revile a beautiful blue and white cheeked Hastens Vividus. John had later learned it had been a gift from a Swedish client that was close to the royal family. The bedding was raw silk, and cashmere (as was Sherlock's favorite blue scarf, which was why the man himself smelled of it almost constantly) the periodic table of elements was actually hand drawn by some scientists. The scroll above Sherlock's bed was some thousand year old thing from one Japanese dynasty or another given to him by a member of the Yakuza. There where other bits and bobs too, a trinket that may or may not have been Faberge, a pair of spectacles that belonged to Albeit Einstein, an original copy of "Faust" by Goethe, the list went on and on. But none more valuable then the occupant himself. At least not for John anyway. He treasured Sherlock above all else, and he was bone tired of fighting it. That's why John, had thrown caution to the wind and kisses him. Their lives where for the most part dangerous and unpredictable. If any moment could be their last then the ones in between needed to be lived to the fullest. On cue, Sherlock walked in from the bathroom door. Blue silk clung to his damp skin, his wet curls now perfect individual ringlets. John had to turn away from the sight of him, because he was pretty sure that if he didn't he was going to attack him. Instead John climbed into bed and cut off his light. John watched as Sherlock pulled on a pair of pants and nothing else, God this was going to be a long night. John prayed that the killer would show up. Sherlock cut off his light. As soon as it was dark he spoke.
“Oi, been callin, I know you don’t like to talk well...you know, thought you’d text back by now.” Lestrade came to an abrupt hult at the top landing and gave Sherlock a puzzled look when he tried to side step him into the sitting room.  Sherlock frowned but didn’t move. Not out of the way at least, Lestrade moved a hair to the right Sherlock leaned into his path.
No answer. Shit shit shit. John sprinted up to his room, (pain be damned) threw on some clothes and called Lestrade.
"Well someone is smitten." Irene said as they walked back to the dorm arm in arm in a cloud of shared cigarette smoke.
"John, as much as I would enjoy your hands on me any other time, right now I'm freezing my head is pounding and I just want to lay down and have a cup of tea."
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh. “Tartarus? As in Judgment death and divine punishment? This is a far far cry from the deep abyss I’m afraid.” The 17th century mansion was architecturally stunning with all its stone and arches and beautiful appointments. “Divine punishment indeed.” Sherlock did a slow  twirl taking in the surroundings.
Sherlock rushed into the sitting room and John stood by the landing and watched as Sherlock hastily gathered up his skattered clothing, not looking back at John once. He slipped on his trousers and shoes, whipped his shirt on, did one botton, slipped into his Belstaff, shoved his pants and his socks into his pocket, snatched up his scarf and flew down the steps, John stood in the door frame and watched the man he loved more then life itself walk out of his life again. After the door slammed he'd stayed there ears ringing in silence for long moments starting at the last spot Sherlock had been before his knees gave out beneath him and he collapsed to the floor, John broke, rocking with his arms around his middle making an anguished sound as he cried. Eventually John fell into something like exhaustion and just slumped there in that spot. When he woke, he went straight for what would be his first of many many bottles of scotch.
“Answers.” Sherlock spoke through chattering teeth. “Well let’s see; by definition an answer is a thing said, written, or done to deal with or as a reaction to a question, statement, or situation. We are lacking a question. You’ve made no statement, and this whole situation is of your doing not mine. Therefore I can not help you.”
The man holding Sherlock shoved him roughly to the ground and kicked him in his side out of the way and then began to circle John in a half crouch knife in hand held out defensively.
After stopping at a few shops and finding the smallest Christmas tree they could comfortably carry they headed back to Baker Street for John to deck the halls. He said it was tradition in his house and Sherlock would just have to endure. After much obligatory grumbling and a good pout on his part Sherlock found a seat on the sofa and watched the assassin he loved fill his flat with Christmas cheer.
John only too eager to comply, buried his cock to the hilt and nearly came as the blinding pleasure coursed through his body.
“Herbinger,” John stood, his self possession and authority radiated. “I think you know that all the yes Ma'am and subordinate behavior were a courtesy. With that said, I'll take point from here.”
Sherlock tried to focus his tired heavy eyes on the ceiling at the over large spider that loomed there, legs seeming to crawl this way and that at odd angles, he must have lay that way fixed for hours before his mind allowed the thing to morphed into the cracked ceiling that it actually was. Through a curtain of gray fog Sherlock recognized not the first time that he was not good. He wasn't well in the head, and that fact shook Sherlock. His mind was bogged down and listless slow to start and difficult to keep going, like a cold engine with not enough petrol.  His body was no better. He couldn't seem to move stiff limbs heavy with a weight that no longer existed because he was practically skeletal, breathing was a tornado of glass shards in his lungs. But the worse part was the rambling around in his mind palace staggering from one dark disheveled room to the next desperately seeking...what? Something was missing something valuable, important, something precious was missing. He'd been here before, cut off from his mind, adrift. But no, not here. Once it had been...peaceful? Now it was penitence. For...what? He wept. Did he? He wanted to. God how he wanted to. But what he wanted wasn't an option, there were consequences here not options. There was only the fog and the cold and the pain and the work. One followed the other over and over unending. The work. Not the work that he loved, but the work they had forced him into here. The work that he only did because they kept him suspended in a stat of leaden compliance. That was the time he was allowed to surface, not much, but just enough to be functional, enough to do what came almost naturally, science and chemical of it all. At times the fog was light enough for brief peeks of sun to melt just the sharp edges of his icy cell. The warm strong sun. He had once loved the sun. And the sun had loved him back.
“Oi, Freak, didn’t think you’d turn up. No dead bodies for you to poke about, thought those were the only kind of people you liked?”
Sherlock studied John for a long moment. Beautiful John. His John. To be honest if that had been the description Sherlock were given...no John would not have fit his taste. Not on paper anyway. The basic outline did John no justice whatsoever.
"Looks bad." John said a little too softly to be speaking to a mate while running his thumb over the angry mark.
John slid one hand down to the small of Sherlock's back, the other firmly on the side of his neck as his thumb moved along Sherlock's jawline. "One day...yes. But not today."
John cut through an ally leading the would be assassin who had been following him for the better part of ten minutes. The streets of Jaipur where still a bit of a tangle for John so it had taken him a moment to find a secluded enough spot for their meeting.
"Not really according to the rule book, but for you I'll bend the rules sure." Hell I'll shatter all the rules of this world for you. John wanted to say. "It's Shakespeare. The whole skull and all."
“Would you still sleep with me if there were?” Sherlock knew the answer, John was a rare man and though he had clearly had more then his fair share of partners, few had been attached none had been married and John wanted no parts of infidelity.
“I know.” John managed to hissed against Sherlock’s ear and drove into him with a heart pounding breath jerking rhythm.
Sherlock had rushed ahead of John in his usual fashion of impatience and long legs and had been caught off his game by the man they where after. The murderer in question was a particularly nasty fellow who liked to cut and carve up his victims until they bleed out, and had showed absolutely no conscience up to this point and promised to continued in this same vain. Sherlock's great strides ate up the distance between he and the killer, but the man spun sharply and swung his heavy bag of tools into the darkness and smashed them into the side of Sherlock's head, the pain barely had a chance to resister before Sherlock was out cold. John rounded the corner seconds later, his eyes locked with the criminal standing over Sherlock, before they darted to the pron figure of his friend on the ground, he looked back up at the man with a murderous sneer.
No. You don't understand. There was something I couldn't figure out. When the Russians had me they kept talking about a clergyman, an unlikely priest and how the never thought they'd be working for the church. The man was young and apparently more rent boy then man of the cloth. It's him John.
"Oh yes. More of the same." Sherlock was bubbly and wicked as his draped his limbs over John's body.
He was in fact right. Members of the SAS, worked independently unless they were working in a group, but that group was still it’s own governing body. But now was not the time to add credence to John’s argument.
"God help me! Just grab the man and kiss him already!" Irene jumped off the desk yelling and prancing around the room.
“Do you mean to imply that your sexual prowess is greater then my intellect?” Sherlock asked through mild laughter.
"Stop. Just stop."  Trevor focused all his panicked attention on John, who didn't seem so small and insignificant now. "You'll never get loose, and I don't have time to waste while you try." John had cuffed Victor to one of the dinning room chairs. "Now...I'm going to ask you some questions, but before I do know this, I'm at the end of my patience and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get answers. So, with that in mind, where is he and who are you working for?"
“Stop. Stop. We have to stop.” John huffed and tried to sit up. Sherlock was having none of that. He draped one long leg over John’s thighs and nuzzled into the mans neck. John nearly died. The full length of Sherlock hot and hard in every way pressed against him made is head spin, or was it the lips on his neck that were causing his vertigo?
Sherlock reached his hand down between their bodies and wrapped his hand as best he could around both their cocks, precum creating a beautiful maddening friction. John tried to squeezed his thighs together and pressed his head back into the pillow, rocking his hips into Sherlock's fist. God, he was close. He had to break Sherlock's complete domination over him if he didn't want to cum in Sherlock's hand in the next five seconds. John shifted his hand reluctantly from Sherlock's perfect bottom, to run his middle finger down Sherlock's coccyx, down again to the tight ring of muscles, causing Sherlock's rythme on their cocks to falter just enough for John to gain control. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's narrow frame and flipped him over with ease. Sherlock's breath came out in a rush of surprise. John sat back on his heels and pulled Sherlock into his lap spreading his legs wide. John sucked his middle finger wet and pushed inside Sherlock's wanton quivering body, Sherlock bucked into the pleasure with a long low moan.
In the six years since Kings, Sherlock Holmes had become. He was the worlds only consulting detective he was a renown genius, a first chair worthy violinist and a consultant for New Scotland Yard. He was also still very much in love. That had not changed in the least. And even tho he kept that love locked safely away in a richly appointed heavily guarded room, in the deepest recesses of his mind palace, it was still as strong and achingly beautiful as it had been all those years ago. Years ago, when he’d had the chance to tell John the truth of his heart. That’s why he was sitting here now and had been for the past week, reading to John at his bed side, watching his weak struggle against the infection that ravaged his body. Sherlock felt utter heartbreak. Sherlock had followed John’s military career over the years, and had known every step he’d made every special commendation, every promotion he’d turned down, lives he’d saved and those he’d lost. John had been a part of him every day. He’d come to the desert land with the hope that he had been a part of John all this time too. Funny how things change. Now Sherlock’s only hope was that John live.
"A 7-percent solution." John made a face and tisked at his answer. Sherlock shrugged innocently. He'd thought it was funny.
"Like I said scared." John gave Greg a hard look and was about to speak when he was cut off. "I know I know, give you a lap."
They clung to each other they moved together in Sherlock’s grip hot hard and desperate. John’s hands roved over Sherlock’s body unsure where he wanted to touch him most. His curls, his neck, his cock. John’s gloved fingers settled over their cocks at the moment of climax he cupped his palm and tried in vain to stem the tide. They kissed each other deeply, lovingly through the shared spasms.
"You looked like you needed the rest." John's voice was low and private. "I didn't have the heart to wake you. Plus you're even more beautiful when you sleep if that's possible." John gently pinched Sherlock's nose, he winced.  John let his thumb brush Sherlock's cheek. "Sorry. Had to make sure it wasn't fractured. I'd like to see you later. Come to my practice."
“Please call me Sally, unless you like the whole rank and file game.” She slithered on to bar stool and crossed her legs showing off too much thigh in her tight red party dress. John found her tacky ham fisted and classless.
“Mmm. Not sure. I’m not usually the type to break up a happy home but if there is a Mr. Holmes, he’s clearly not the man for you.”  John, signaled to the bar keep for another round of scotch while he delicately rubbed his fingers over Sherlock’s knuckles.
“Yes well...” John let his words hang in the air for two reasons. One he wasn’t going to tell Mercy, that since Sherlock Holmes, the thought of being with anyone else seemed...wrong, and two he had just spotted Jim Moriarty across the room and his aptly named Tiger, approaching to John’s left. Why were they here? “Mercy, we may have a problem.”
“Hello Sherlock!” Molly was both shy and exuberant all at once tripping over her words. “You look... good...I mean nice, you look nice. Never seen you in jeans before, special occasion?” Sherlock looked around the party with an arched brow. “Oh,” Molly’s cheeks went pink. “This the party is the special occasion of course. Sorry. So...yeah it’s nice this. Are you enjoying yourself? I know you hate this kind of thing. Surprised you’re here. Why...why are you here? I mean I’m glad you came...just...”
Helloo. The Cold East Wind here. First let me say sorry for the long gap between chapters, I just got out of jail for stealing from PATPRECIEUX, in that last bit. ;) But really, I do apologize. 2018 came in like a Cold East Wind, and I’ve been caught up in it. From now on I’ll do my level best to publish a little faster. A little.
“Weapons grade uranium anyone?” Odin’s deep voice bellowed as he came into view pulling the yellow cake uranium behind him with the rest of the team following close. “Oi. What’s the hold up then?l”
John shook with laughter. “We don’t have to stay long. I’ll take my measure of the lucky morons that get to spend time with the man I love and then we’ll be off yeah.”  John braced for the tirade. This was the second time he’d said the “L” word and he was certain this time would not go unanswered.
"I want the other one. The one with the golden skin. Watch his blood run red over his beautiful golden skin split open."
"John...I...oh god...I...can't." Sherlock's thighs quivered, and John could feel the strain in Sherlock's body.
Greg finally turned to look at his friend. "Maybe you just need to get him out of your system, yeah?"
"And Shakespeare just rolled over in his grave and flipped you off! Can we please get to the smut?!"
“Alright.” But John didn’t take the path lied out in front of him. He had different roads he wanted to follow. “What about you?”
"Less people at the wedding. You know just what it means. You practically read my thoughts so why ask?"
Sherlock listened to the message twice more. Each time filling in the missing words at the end they were right there, so close, he could hear John holding them back. Sherlock whispered his response into the universe.
Sherlock flashed John a horrorfied look. “Oh honey those shoes!” Sherlock did his best Freddie Mercury which was alarmingly good and both of them fell into childish laughter and it took them a few minutes to wipe the tear from their eyes.
Sherlock came back and sat a cup down in front of John (who’d found his way back to the sofa to take a look at his handy work) then he sat crossed legged on the floor on the opposite side of the table, he held his cup in both hands smothering the poor thing as he blow off puff of steam. John chuckled. Sherlock gave him a look that was disarming in its quiet beauty.
"What's wrong love?" John's voice was soft and always a soothing balm. Sherlock raised his head and changed positions to better see this man he loved so dearly. This man who continued to astound him in ways he never anticipated.
John liked Lestrade immediately. He was what you would call a “mans man” in the truest sense of the word. He put John in the mind of his rugby mates in uni.
"Mmmm. Do tell Greg, it's all sorted." Sherlock took full advantage now of the new position sucking Johns neck, and running his hand over the knob of his hip bone, the flat of his stomach, and finding his goal. Johns cock heavy and hot. Sherlock sucked in breath as his fingers wrapped around Johns girth, making the older man jerk.
"John Watson." He said John's name as if it were attached to some great mystery. "No. It doesn't work that way. Or I don't think it dose, this is not my project."
Once in the room Sherlock sat himself down gingerly, and tried not to wence. Helicopter rides where not known for there comfort.  Coupled with the fact that John had made him run full tilt across an open clearing with John at his back L96A1 in hand the whole time sweeping the area. John did a quick check of the room, finding nothing out of place. Now he could focus on the reason he was here.
“So that leaves us right back at square one. Me trying to get you into the path of John Watson. The wheel turns and nothing is ever new.” Smoke hovered in the air between them.
Sherlock studied John, he was made golden by the fire stunning almost regal. Sherlock was always so fascinated by the way this man made him think and feel. “No my Gaelic king, that is not all.”
The room became utterly quiet from the level of shock. Not just from the fact they had learned that the man they had regularly seen for years was of the feline race, but of the fire of his words towards the woman he openly admitted was having relations with the man on the  forensic’s team.
“Right, of course you wouldn’t know. It happens to be a gentlemen’s club. One that I need to get to post haste. So please put your mouth to good use and finish your breakfast because you won't be using it once we get there.”
“An error on my part.” Next came the detective’s goggles as he tossed them on the table. “But there is not much to tell. Most of what you have seen is the extent of my…problem.”
The sitting room was the main area. Set up with a large desk by the window, book shelves, and chairs around. He could see why he would choose this flat. It was a prime area to work, have clients, and to live. A quick glance into the kitchen was enough to see various beakers and chemistry equipment to make a miniature lab. John figured he must be a chemist of sorts. This would be work from home, where he could easily make his own hours and he didn't have to punch a time card. Given the disarray of things and boxes cluttering the area John guessed he had already decided he was moving in, flat mate or no.
“Pity you didn’t arrive sooner. We could’ve all had breakfast together, like family.” The drawled out voice of Mycroft filled the room as they approached him.
“You don’t understand,” Sherlock shook his head and turned to face John. “I haven’t had real blood like this in a very long time. I gave up getting it straight from the source around the beginnings of World War 1 when blood was first manipulated to work as transfusions for the war. It meant I didn’t have to kill anymore. Meant…I could become less of the creature I was created to be. But the chemicals and the process over time had changed the way it tasted for me. Though it has gotten better than before with technological advancement over the years. Previously, it would sometimes make me ill. This though, this is better than anything I’ve ever had.”
Sherlock whipped his head around to her sudden outburst, but looking over her shoulder to John’s horrified face he knew the damage had been done. He was out.
This would be the second time in one evening that John had witnessed fear lace the detective’s eyes. What could a rock do to put him in such a state of vulnerability? As soon as fear came it had dissipated. He looked up to see the Inspector heading in their direction along with a gangly man who was wearing a blue zipped up plastic suit.
“Of course,” Sherlock could hear this uneasiness in John’s voice. “You don’t even have to interact with me if you so choose. All I require is blood. Nothing more.”
Guilt crept up in John and thought perhaps he approached on a sensitive topic. After all, how does one joke and talk to one who is already dead without offending them? What exactly was the social etiquette? Deciding that it was best to keep his mouth shut instead of inserting his foot again he muttered a quick gratitude and made his way to the bathroom. He found it with ease, though noticed at the end of the hallway was another door. The dark wooden structure hung on its hinges in a sinister manner the way no light played upon its frame. Shadows clung to it like cobwebs and the door itself was closed tightly as if it was a jail cell.
Sherlock had stopped long enough to allow lunch. For that John was thankful. However he knew he wasn’t the only one that was hungry. He couldn’t fool him. In the small cafe he saw how the detective’s observant eyes wasn’t concentrating on what kind of people were around them, but only concentrating on the ones that started drinking. He would watch one person consume their drink until another caught his eye and flitted towards them. A nervous twitch had started in his leg causing it bounce up and down underneath the table.
The kettle ended its cycle and John began to make himself a cup along with breakfast. True to Mrs. Hudson’s word it had only been one time since he had moved in that she had graced the table with her cooking. He didn’t mind though and soon set himself up a serving of cereal and sat at the table. But one thing she could be counted on was bringing Sherlock’s daily newspaper. It was her everyday religious duty. John glanced at the stories on the front page and frowned went he read over the article concerning the patient, Katherine Carmichael, and the story surrounding her murder. One thing he noticed it left out any mention of the detective.
“Yeah you should see the guy. Bad hemoglobin levels, anemic, pale as a damn ghost. Not healthy I tell you. Thanks.”
John took a brief look down to assess his clothes. He wasn’t exactly sure if he needed to be more dressed up or play it casual. It had been a good long while since he had stepped into a club. Way before his army days.
The case in said violation; a kelpie had started attacking a village drainage pipe into a lake. There were reports from muggles that there was supposedly a "monster" in the lake, as they heard groans and roars from within and a glowing "dragon" and fish at night. The glowing was only a recent occurrence in the past couple of years. Naturally the detective was hired and he took the case, not because he was interested in said monster, he was more interested in the drainage pipe. In the end he found that a power plant run by terrorist cell was illegally draining nuclear waste into the lake and the plot was shut down immediately. Now the kelpie was being relocated, the lake cleaned, and minds Obliviated of any "monster". Ultimately solving the Ministry's mystery of what was going on with the lake, the kelpie and the breach. So didn't he actually…help?
“Someone has to with all the sorts you get to the flat and your strange experiments.” She remarked giving him a sideways glare before returning back to John. “I’m going to the market. Is there anything I can pick up for you?”
“You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand. Your therapist thinks its stress. Fire her. She has it the wrong way around. You are under stress right now and your hand is perfectly still. You’re not haunted by the war. You miss it. It’s the A&E that gives you the coverage you need. Its the thrill.”
At this moment John fished out his phone that was given him by Arthur. He was going to conduct an experiment just to see how good this detective truly was. Could it be possible for him to crack a magically modified phone or would he be stumped? He wanted to know exactly what he was dealing with and plan accordingly. With a touch of a button he switched on the muggle safety and handed his phone to him with baited breath.
“Running after the devil is one thing. Staving off one, is entirely another matter. I believe it would be safer for us both if I went home. At least for awhile.”
From what he could gather at glance this strange man in some sense was familiar yet different. A duplicate yet not exactly the real McCoy. He was the same height, same build, even favoring his right hand to carry his briefcase rather than his left which was clearly the more dominant. He even had the same name which he read off the dangling I.D. badge clipped to the outside of his bag: Dr. John Watson. Sure it was a fairly common name. No doubt to be reused several times throughout history. But what were the odds? Here Sherlock believed the only thing that never changed was he himself. How wrong he was! Either way Sherlock had decided that this man was to eventually be his guest. Whether he wanted to or not. Now, after much waiting, it had finally come to chance that tonight was this night after careful preparation.
“What was her name, the bride?” Watson joined in, producing his own notebook to make his own findings.
Visualizing the scene of the crime was the upmost importance of his methods. It was like making a painting upon a canvas. Every detail had to be precise in order to see the full picture. Lighting, position, colors and shapes is what he formulated within his mind palace. Every once and a while he stepped back to view different angles to see the secrets that laid hidden to the unobservant.
If it was one thing he couldn’t stand, it was how the Yard liked to over exaggerate things, especially when it came to dissolving facts from fiction. And irritating him even more when they disclosed such preposterous stories to the paper for them to dress it up in scandal and gossip. He couldn’t help but let out a sigh of frustration.
“Your abilities. What exactly can you do? I know there are hundreds of myths and legends about vampires, but what exactly is the truth? At least for you.”
Muggles apparently learn everything from the "web" as it tends to house most of their news source. It still needs more research into it. But you will be using this. We have a laptop set up here where we can see any documentation you type out though try to be discreet. They say muggles can hack into these things. So you may want to pretend you are writing a book or something of the sort." He handed the device over to him.
"Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake." Sherlock smiled to himself.
“Very well. I’ll be back in a few. Nice meeting you dear.” She left out the kitchen door and made down the stairs. “But like I said, just this once!”
Settled in the cab Sherlock withdrew his phone from his coat and busied himself. John peered over at him and the wall Sherlock had made for himself; his expressionless face decorated him like a mask. A hard and subtle way of saying he did not want to be talked to or noticed. But John had other plans. He wasn’t going to let one misunderstanding ruin a possible interesting evening.
And just like that she pulled her veil down and walked away. Constable Rance was in such a state of fright. He turned in his badge because of what he saw.” Lestrade finished off the rest of his drink, concluding his tale.
Sherlock turned to see the newly showered John in his pajamas and house coat. He had been so engrossed in the blood he hadn’t even heard him finish his shower. He turned away from John out of modesty for his current state so not to disgust his flatmate and mumbled out a quick apology.
“ ‘Miss me?’,” John’s brows knitted together in confusion as he handed back the paper and Sherlock tucked it into his coat pocket. “Sounds like they’ve done this before.”
A telephone number was listed to inquire, he had called, and set a time with an elderly woman. Not that it mattered to him though he would've preferred someone closer to his age, but maybe he needed a change. Something quiet and mundane, like the elderly woman. And who knows maybe she needed a friend too.
“Oh for God’s sake!” Sherlock plopped in his chair, resting his head on the balled up fist of his hand. If looks could kill Sherlock’s menacing eyes could’ve easily killed an army by the way he looked at Mycroft.
John’s eyes darted to and fro. Now he truly was defenseless. With no way out, no home to return to, no weapon and a vampire lurking downstairs, what was he to do? His eyes drifted over to the end table by his bed and noticed a small note. Picking it up, on it was fine scrawled out cursive that had to have been made by delicate hand. The strokes of the handwriting looked so out of date he knew it could only have to belonged to Sherlock.
At that he opened a door and both entered a room cluttered with different assortments of muggle items and gadgetry from top to bottom. There was hardly any room to step or form a clear a path. Some gadgets were from older decades like a record player or even a pinball machine and some more modern like an iPhone.
The sounds of heavy artillery and the shouts of his men from his nightmares is what usually threw John back into the land of the living. He was no stranger to the curse of stressed induced dreams that wanted him to relive his every moment from the war like some personal circle of Hell. Every night he felt like it was a game of roulette of whether he would sleep peacefully or enter the battle once again. Though the night terrors is not what had awoken John this morning.
The morning came stead fast for John. The rays of sunlight brought mind a realization of hope to him. He had made it through the night. In a sense of urgency he bounded out of his bed and made towards the full length mirror by his closet door. He checked his neck, arms, wrists, and the plains of his body. Every inch of skin he inspected for any sign of a bite. None was found. He breathed out a sigh of relief and went to the window to find it still locked. Even his door. All was as Sherlock had said. He hadn’t bothered him. At least he was going to think that way. He hoped that the vampire didn’t have some key to his room where he could come and go as he pleased. Or was that superstition now null and void since now John was the one who occupied and lived in the room? Would Sherlock be forced to be an uninvited guest in a part of his own home until John gave the word to let him in?
Though however crazy it was John wanted to know. How did he get his knowledge of his time in the middle east, his fake story of an army doctor, he didn't even have a brother so who was he thinking was his brother or even his therapist? Just how? He wanted answers!
“Well I’m not going to lie it’s a fucking nightmare here,” Lestrade started. “Katherine Carmichael, a patient only 17, was found in a field about a kilometer down the road. In pieces, mind you. Definitely not for the faint of heart. She was getting treatment here at Brightwell Hospital. It’s a mental institution. She was reported missing last week and then found earlier this evening by a jogger. We have a doctor in custody right now. He has a hobby of collecting old surgical tools and one of his was missing from his office.”
"Yes," John heard the door open and footsteps come down the hall, but instead of coming to the sitting room the man entered the kitchen that was behind him. "I trust you had no trouble finding the place. Would you like some tea? I see you'd had a grueling day, job hunting has left you exhausted."
He waited a few more minutes until he heard the sound of water spraying from the shower head in the bathroom. He didn’t want him to see him like this. Not at his most lowest and unstable. He quietly eased out of his darkened room, shutting it with a soft click, and made his way towards the kitchen.
“The back of your collar had flipped,” Sherlock said as he straightened it back in place and withdrew his hand. “I can’t have my doctor looking unsightly before we arrive.”
“Oi! What’s all this then? Why does my kitchen smell like burnt haggis?” Mrs. Hudson cut off Sherlock’s wondering daydreaming mind with a shrill of her voice. Probably for the best anyway. Better off to keep his thoughts in check than to say something out of line in front of John. Least of all Mrs. Hudson.
John was taken aback by the offer and made a wary eye to the steps leading up to the extra room. So, he was prepared for him. Better yet what was it in the room that was ‘furnished and stocked’? He tried pushing back images of gruesome devices and bondage that leapt forward in his mind, but he couldn’t help it. That was a vampire’s thing wasn’t it? Blood and sex? At least it was in cheesy films. But what if he simply just had a spare room? A guest room like any other house if one were to expect company.
"How did you know about Afghanistan?" John asked even though he had only just gotten back from there not three months ago. It irked him that he knew. So far he hadn't seen any evidence that this man was a threat to the magical world. Other than maybe he was a little bit of a prick. The man once again ignored his question and wrapped his scarf around his neck, picking up his mobile and checking it.
Three months have gone by without incident until a new case explodes into mayhem. Leaving John empty handed for blood for Sherlock.
Dear God, the thought had never came to his mind to ask. Or should he have asked? Was one type better than the other? As if asking was somehow learning one’s preference to Chinese than to pasta. How the hell was he supposed to know what Sherlock’s preferred blood type was. Then again Sherlock said he needed blood. He never mentioned a type. He had a feeling that if he needed to know he would’ve said something by now.
The elevator came to a clang and the doors retracted apart. Stepping off into a overcrowded basement of people, desks, chairs, papers flying from one to another it looked to be a complete mad house. John's eyebrows rose at the onslaught of noise of catastrophe. Harry looked to him apologetically.
At that moment his phone chimed with a text and he withdrew it from his trouser pocket. Mycroft of course. His relation had been keeping tabs on him and his current state since he was still out of the country on official government business. Even from afar he knew Mycroft could easily supply him with an unsuspecting victim from his prisoner hoard. While the idea seemed like the more logical and sensible solution he could not bring himself to do it. He could not let himself go into baser instincts. He was still clutching onto the undoubted faith he had in his flatmate to get what he needed without turning into a ravenous lunatic any time soon.
“Are you sure you weren’t doing more than just…watching me for the past two weeks? Did you ever go into my flat?”
"Oh, Sherlock. The mess you've made." The land lady fretted over to the kitchen now busying herself in the makeshift lab Sherlock had put together.
“Hey John I saved this for you,” Molly had found John in the locker room at the end of the shift, his lunchbox in hand. “You were off in such a flash at lunch that you forgot your bag. I took it with me for safe keeping.”
'"Let's see if we can find out exactly who you are." he said to himself eager this time to play the role of the detective.
For the first time John felt comfortably at ease with the vampire and cracked a smile of his own. He didn’t feel like he was being drug around simply for Sherlock’s sheer will or entertainment, but as a companion. Sherlock was the detective and he was his flatmate assisting in his medical expertise, nothing more, nothing less.
“The paracetamol will kick in soon. I might even have a hot shower.” John leaned back against the counter, glass in hand as he watched the detective turn the knobs of his microscope ever so slowly.
“If you look carefully there are scratches on the outside of her window on the pane itself. Though there are no signs of forced entry. They are barely visible in the light, but at just the right angle you can make out five lines. Her murderer came here to get her and she was trying to save herself from them.”
"Very well. I'll send out some people. And as for anyone German, no not that I know of but I will look into it."
"Sorry Harry. Didn't hear you come out." He stood with the help of his cane and limped into the office of Harry Potter and took a seat. Harry came around and sat at his desk shuffling through his paper work. John wasn't sure if he was looking for something in particular or if he was just biding his time and beating around the bush so he wouldn't have to tell him he was no longer needed. He could read it in his face with the anticipation and the nervousness.
The doctor left the detective by the wall of the garage to finish his cigarette and started for the stairs by the side of building. He was glad that the vampire was finally starting to open up a little even if it was small minuscule information about himself. It was starting to make him seem more real, more human. This man once had a life, ambitions, dreams, a career. He had to say he was even interested in what he was like in his past life. But those would be conversations for another time.
His dark eyes flicked to the fridge and in a swift movement opened it. There nestled on the bottom shelf was two bags. He quickly grabbed one up and was surprised to find that it was barely cold.
Despite the request being even somewhat dangerous he knew he needed to do this for Sherlock. Yes, their meeting and living together was altogether strange, but his flatmate had been more than accommodating for him. He had let him live there under good pretenses and had eased his burden in life. This vampire, who had saved his life and always kept himself in check, never really allowed himself to be himself in his own home. It was time to change that.
“Diogenes.” Sherlock answered as if it was known fact, continuing to peer down at the him in equal confusion.
"Are you at Bart's, then?" John changed the subject hoping to shoo away the elephant in the room and get back on a more neutral topic.
“I want you in my mouth...” But the words were lost in the action. Sherlock gagged in his hungry rush to have all of John in his mouth at once. He pulled back and took John’s shaft more slowly, over and over until he adjusted to John’s size, until he was pressing his mouth against John’s balls and felt the sting of tears in his eyes.  John cursed and his legs trembled with the sudden electric pleasure. Sherlock marveled at the beauty of how thick and heavy John’s cock felt in his mouth and moaned around him. John bucked his hips in time with Sherlock’s mouth, the wet sound and the gold glent of mischief in his eyes as he slid off John’s cock was sublime. Sherlock’s lips stretched around the head of John’s cock and there was a wicked sparkle of tears when he swallowed John again to the root with another deep sound of triumphant pleasures vibrating down John’s cock and he felt the press of Sherlock’s soft palette. John threw his head back with a curse and nearly fell. Sherlock gripped his ass and kept him steady. But John slipped his grasp, swallowing hard, panting and taking a step back.
"Thanks for the offer, but fuck off just the same!” John lowered his voice to speak to Sherlock. “We stay here and make them come to us." John spoke in a whisper and then put his finger to his lips and signaled for quite. John moved his L96A1, to his back switching to his hand gun for close combat. He watched Sherlock's face and saw the moment the idea solidified in his mind.
“We only want the scientist. Give him to us and we’ll let you go.” The heavy Russian accent echoed off the walls.
Also, I'm in the process of trying to find a beta, in the mean time I really need you guys to let me know if I'm being too wordy and I'm boring you all to death. Thanks in advance.
"I know we do, but when have things between us ever come easy in this area. John I trust you implicitly, you know me completely and...I...love you."
“Lestrade this is J, he’s a friend staying with me for a while.” Sherlock smiled at John seeking his approval.
"Clearly you've forgotten who's captain. Give me a lap Lestrade!" John turned back to face Sherlock with a dazzling smile. "Sorry. Undisciplined lot. I've seen you around campus, it's good to finally meet you." John slowly let go of Sherlocks hand. "I hope to see you again soon. I've got to get back to the pitch." John stated off toward the field. He back peddled and called up to Sherlock. "Maybe you can come watch me play one day!" John flashed one more killer smile and turned to run back into the fray.
Sherlock opened his mouth to retort, John shook his head in the negative. Sherlock rolled his eyes violently. John suppressed a chuckle.
“Now?” John paused for a moment to enjoy the picture of pent up desire in front of him. “Now I plan on deconstructing you and fucking you speechless.”
John shook his head and stifled a laugh at Moran’s usual greeting. “This is a secure line Doyle.” John put emphasis on the ails Moran had used in India.
“Oh I’m sorry brother mine, I didn’t mean to give you the impression that I wouldn’t see John anymore. I simply ment is that all you had to say...”
"Done. But I'm sure there will be little to nothing of worth at a drunken game of truth or dare to interest you. It's just that brain of yours over thinking things as usual." They walked side by side at a brisk pace.
John passed the old gentleman wildly flailing his arms in silent protest without a second glance as he stormed toward his goal. The double doors. They opened soundlessly.
"So, did this spot of bother have a name?" Sherlock though he'd give her the chance to tell him the whole story before he told it to her himself.
"You lier!" He snarled. But his anger turned to fear when he felt Irene press her taser to his groin.
"God, I could have you a million times and still be thirsty." John rutted against Sherlock's bottom Sherlock moaned in response, one hand gripped his hip the other finding its way into Sherlock's paints to free his cock. Frustrated at the barrier of clothing, John spun Sherlock around and the race was on to see who could get naked fastest. It was Sherlock, who then hopped up on the table sending various beakers, Petri dishes, and droppers, clattering to the floor without a care. It was fast and hard from that point on and Sherlock screamed like the devil on fire and praised John's name like angels on clouds as John drove into him and fisted Sherlock's cock in time with each smack of their flesh coming together. Sherlock's release sent more equipment flying to the floor and a stream of white hot cum over his belly and chest. John was not far behind after such a sight. His own release was guttural and powerful.  Had it not been for Sherlock's legs wrapped around his waist he would have collapsed. As it was he lay froward resting his head on Sherlock's solar plexus struggling to breathe normally.
Sherlock ordered two more cognacs, and they wavered between comfortable silence, clever conversation and enjoying the smooth amber liquid. Sherlock studied John over the rim of his glass form time to time, the smoky sweet heat and John’s presence warming him in a way that was unusual, but not unwanted. What an interesting man this John Watson. He seemed well placed in whatever setting he was dropped into. He seemed well placed in Sherlock’s life odd a notion as that was.
“And that’s how it’s done. We’re finished here. But I need you in two days for the close. Don’t wonder off.”
John sat the empty glass down and walked slowly back to the sitting room he was in pain, but they needed to talk. If not about the kiss, then at least about the case. Sherlock was still standing by the sofa right where he'd left him.
“Four heavily armed guards patrolling at regular twenty minute intervals in my quardent. Pope, and Bishop are reporting the same. Over.”
“Her Majesty, needs an exfill. British citizen on Russian soil. Retrieve, relocate and secure until further notice.”
John looked down at his mobile unsure if this was the right move. He couldn't do this alone. It was an underground Russian black site for fucks sake with likely only one point of ingress and egress and John knew his limitations. That said, he'd been in the field with Moran before and tho the opt had gone horribly sideways they had worked well together. Still there was the matter of his psychopathic boyfriend. Fuck. None of that mattered. He needed to move on this intel sooner rather then later. He'd deal with the fallout later. John placed the call.
“Coitus Ensues.” Sherlock leaned over into John’s space just shy of intimate and waited for his confusion.
"Then talk to him." Simple. But Mycroft, knew it wasn't. Nether  he nor John had seen or heard from Sherlock, since that faithful night nearly nine months ago. John hadn't tried looking for Sherlock, because he didn't know what he would do if he found him. He didn't know if he was still too angry and would hurt him again, or if love was simple more important. Mycroft on the other hand had looked, and come up with nothing. He knew that the homeless network that was only loyal to Sherlock was helping his brother so it was like chasing shadows.
Sherlock sounded far more cavalier then he felt. What he felt was new, and not the least bit new and interesting, no, this was terrifying. Sherlock's body trembled, his chest felt like lead, and the tears where dangerously close. He wanted John, no needed John, to fix this. And the only way he could do that was to live.
"So, can I be invited to the next one too?" Paul looked up from burning his flyer with too pale eyes.
John spared a glance over his shoulder but didn’t turn from the steel table were he was cleaning his gun. He had known it was only a matter of time before he got a visit from big brother.
“I will do...whatever her majesty requires of me, for as long as she  requires it. All I ever really wanted to do was serve...”
“Absolutely not. Lovers are usually an experiment in some way or a distraction from boardum. Not...this.” Sherlock gestured with his glass at the surroundings.
They didn’t move. They couldn’t move. They could hardly breath. Eventually John was able to find enough breath and his last shard of strength. He slowly pulled himself from Sherlock’s heat, and smirked when the man in question shuttered as if douces in ice water.
"And Hillsten?" The officer jabbed his thumb to the left. "Thank you Collins." Lestrade walked over to the pile of rubble where Hillstan, was nursing his injury as best he could. "So let's have a look at you then." He bent down to have a closer look. "Not too bad. Look someone should have...I should have told you this the day you started. Don't get between those two. We've all learned the hard way, that those two are...like..."
His attention now settled on Sherlock who met his eye with reciprocation. No particular emotion projected from his features as he waited for him to answer his question.
The doctor was sitting across from her at their table, relaxed, head tilted back to catch the rays. One eye cracked open to watch her feeble attempts. Poor girl was trying as hard as she could. She had even sat on the more shadier side too. Taking pity on her he dug into his lunchbox and found a chilled water bottle.
“Well it’s certainly very Jack the Ripper. She’s been hacked to death. There’s two puncture marks on her inner elbow she may have been drugged and taken. Every joint has been dismembered but all the cuts have been made in locations for easy amputation. Could be someone with medical knowledge of that sort of thing, but they are all jagged. Probably done with a saw. Done in a hurry. She looks extremely emaciated.”
“Well, thank you all for a fascinating case. I’ll send you a telegram when I’ve solved it. Watson?” Holmes needed out, fresh air, something to clear his mind. Whatever this case had started out as he had a feeling there was a east wind coming.
"Ah, this must be him. Sher...lock? Who names their kid Sherlock? Not much information on him either. I'm going to have to start from scratch. His only violation has been since he's moved to London about 6 months ago with that one case Mr. Weasley mentioned earlier. Only now they want an investigation." He scoffed to himself and plopped the folder onto the nightstand. He laid back in bed and with a simple wave of his hand the lamp on the nightstand turned itself out. He still wasn't entirely sure if he wanted to do this job. It was muggle watching after all. How exciting could you get? Then again it wouldn't be a hard job. He still thought about ditching it the more he thought about it and going to work as a healer, but there was something….still something that kept nagging, no itching at the back of his mind.
Mike gave him a look and motioned his head towards the door, then it dawned on him. It was their cover story. Small and basic. John nodded and Mike knocked and opened the door. There in the back of the lab was a tall man in a dark suit, pipping a petri dish only giving the briefest of glances to the intruding visitors.
How was it that people couldn't find Sherlock's talent amazing? The cab arrived at its destination, police cars were surrounding what appeared to be a rundown abandoned apartment building with tape strung up to keep out on lookers. The two men got out of the cab and walk towards the police tape strung across the road, John struggling to keep up with the long strided detective.
“What’s buzzing around in your mind tonight? I know you are only half interested in the television as its been on that preposterous show with the doctor that flies around in the box. Also seventy percent of your focus has been on my book shelf and not even engrossed in that electronic contraption.” Sherlock’s voice brought John out of his own thoughts.
However, the man lost the match right at that second. In movements faster than John could see Sherlock plucked the umbrella out of the man’s grasp with his sword. It flew like a spear towards Sherlock as he caught it with ease and kicked back the man onto the sofa, his sword leveled at his throat. John all but gaped at the scene before him.
“Well I’m not sure about you, but I’m having dinner. I think I’m going to reheat that curry from the other night.”
“Oh?,” John took a quick look over his shoulder towards the windows and door. “A witness or a suspect?”
“Why do I get the feeling that won’t make a difference? Mrs. Hudson says you get all sorts. Besides this has to be the craziest thing I’ve done in a while.”
He sighed heavily and looked at his watch. Quarter till six already. Another fifteen minutes before his guest arrived and possibly turn right around and leave. Either way he had determined this would be the last one.
Puzzled, John stared at the message for a long moment, then looked across to the table where his laptop is laying. He pushed himself to his feet and walked over to the table, opening the laptop and pulling up the internet.
Lestrade nodded turning away from the pair as he radioed on his walkie talkie and giving instructions to the gangly man that John now learned was named Anderson.
” He thought as he looked down the hall to the siren calling door. Sure he had no notion of wanting to go in. That was invading privacy. But the fact he was warning him, heavily warning him, had to mean something. What skeletons was he keeping in his room? Especially if John was threatened with pain of death.
Sherlock hit the play button for the footage to continue. But as it seemed, the universe had other plans for the detective’s questions. It barely took thirty seconds for him to identify the man on the platform. How could he forget such a face? The way he walked and held himself with such flamboyant airs, his distinguished fashion, his devilish smile. The figure set a terrible dread within him.
what was he thinking? John looked down at the IV kit he had just set up on the metal tray table. Beside him was a pole with an empty bag. All of it ready for a donation. It wasn’t that he was opposed or weirded out by the sight of blood and needles on his own skin. It was the fact he was setting up this donation not for a live patient, but a dead one.
“There,” Lestrade pointed out to the set up lights in the field. “Help yourself. I’m sorry, but I’ve seen her more than I care too in one sitting. I’m sure you boys don’t need me to take you down there.”
“Thank God you’re here. Is this him?” asked Lestrade as he pointed towards John, his voice gruff in the cold night air.
“Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory.” Said Watson as he looked across the cab to the blank expression of the detective.
One of Sherlock's ears flicked back to John and his eyes narrowed back at him again. Surely he hadn't heard him right.
Sherlock took another deep breath. John wasn't sure if it was to calm his nerves or prepare for battle.
John gazed at him as he read the headlines. It was still hard to grasp at times that this man was a vampire. So far everything he had expected of the typical stereotype had been the opposite. Even though Sherlock had a striking appearance that would be considered handsome by anyone he just didn’t fit the idea of the vampire look. Though he knew movies overhyped that persona with actors and theatrical makeup.
When he arrived he saw that the lobby was still. Too still. Too calm. He knew this feeling and he hated it. It was the quiet before the storm. The retreating wave before the tsunami.
blood? Reasoning with himself he figured, no. He had taken careful practice to never getting a cut around the vampire. A habit he started from day one; changing every aspect of his life and daily routine to do so. And now he was going to be going against his hard trained discipline.
John must have been on the brunt end of Sherlock’s cryptic conversations for the day. He hated to admit that sometimes if not most, he felt out of the loop whenever the detective was on a case. This meant being in a constant lost in translation. As in Sherlock would expect him to know what he was talking about and he would have absolutely no clue.
"She's German," the rat faced Anderson leaned casually on the door way, his presence suddenly became known. "'Rache': it's German for 'revenge.' She could be trying to tell us something ..."
"I play the violin when I'm thinking." He announced as he typed on the keyboard of his laptop, "Sometimes I don't talk for days on end." He stopped suddenly as though a thought struck him. "Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."
John watched as the detective slipped on his long dark coat which had been draped over his desk chair, tail slinking up the inside. Flattening his ears against his head he tucked them inside a deerstalker cap he had produced out of his coat pocket. Some well fitted black gloves were next that slipped graciously onto his long fingers. John thought he looked down right ridiculous. He had seen old detective movies and never did he ever see someone look more the part. Though he was curious as to why all the concealment. Was he ashamed of who he was or was there more prejudice matters at hand? He was about to set off in a dash but stopped suddenly by the doorway, turning towards John in thought.
“Is that why you have been researching more affordable flats in the central London area despite your hospital job and army pension? Can you really live there even knowing you scrap by, living paycheck to paycheck? Please, stay awhile, talk. I know you are not scheduled for work tomorrow and there is no need for you to rush off. Trust me Dr. Watson. I will make this worth your while.”
"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring." In one swift turn he went back to the body. "Her coat: it's slightly damp. She's been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp, too. She's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it's dry and unused: not just wind,
A dead on arrival teenage boy. A uni student. Shrapnel was imbedded into his skin on one side. He must have seen the brunt end of the explosion and was unfortunate to have a piece slice into his carotid artery. A phone call to his parents was going to have to be made to let them know their son was in the morgue.
“Right. Last I remember vampires don’t exist,” John treaded his words carefully. “I could recommend a psych consult if you need help. Don’t get me wrong that was brilliant what you just did, but if you are having issues…” He trailed off.
"Ensured it? Ensured it?!" John's thoughts were sending warning bells to him. He hoped to God he didn't enter the flat of some raving psychopath.
"He's an old friend of mine, John Watson." Mike found this opportunity to introduce John and in return John caught Mike's glare at him. He could tell that Mike thought he was out of his mind for letting a muggle use a magical modified device, let alone a detective that was under suspicion of near breaking their secret. Though he couldn't help it. He liked to live a little dangerously.
Sherlock’s head tilted to the side this time not in scrutiny, but in consideration. As John had put it he did, technically, kidnap him. He could see how that may come across as a bit not good when trying to persuade someone in becoming their flatmate. Especially since he was now living with a vampire. But John continued to solider on. Taking each new day with him in tow and now even eager to go on cases with him. He would get through this. They both would.
The phone line suddenly went dead as he eyed the car by the curb. This surely wasn't part of the Obiliviator's job? Right? The more deeper and deeper he got into this case with the muggle, the stranger it got. Now he knew if he got into this car he wasn't sure if he would be coming back at all. This muggle who had easily called him from a phone box already knew his cover name for Christ's sake! Who was he?! The fight or flight was high in his system, but deep down he knew he had no option. He had to go. If he fled, Aparating away from this new fresh danger, his cover would be blown. On top of that there would be no video footage of his subtle kidnapping. It would be like he had vanished into the night.
The detective broke his repetitive walk, turning on his heel to give the doctor a confused expression. His hand that had a cigarette nestled between his fingers dropped from his face and he let out a plume of smoke from his lips before he spoke.
It finally donned on John what this was. It was a welfare check. This relation of Sherlock’s wasn’t just coming in to see who now occupied the vampire’s house but to see if he was being used as a food source. At least it made John feel a little better that he wasn’t the only one that thought he was going to be playing the part of a live in three-squares-a-day meal.
His heavy thoughts jolted him back from his internal ramblings to the present. Peering over to Lestrade, he schooled his features to one of indifference. There was no need to alarm the Yard if they saw that even he was starting to have his doubts. Especially if the possibilities of the supernatural could be in question.
John watched him with interest. He had saw his skills last night and was curious to put them to the test again. There would be no way Sherlock could narrow down how someone took their tea and wondered if he could stump him.
“You really want to know?” He quirked an eyebrow in an almost challenging way that only dared John to confirm his answer. When John nodded, Sherlock suddenly shut down his paper and tossed it onto the table haphazardly, clasping his fingers under his chin. The features that were once controlled turned menacing as quick as a stroke of lightening.
The man turned to him. His face blank of all emotion or even a surprised thought that a stranger had seemingly stalked him.
“This is ridiculous. Not one mention that you helped. Lestrade takes all the credit and you are practically swept under a rug.” He passed the newspaper across the table to Sherlock as he took a seat.
“Just last week I decided to look at a new flat. Yesterday I had it narrowed down to three. And you knew all of this because you decided I was going to be your new flat mate,
John pressed his lips against Sherlocks curls. "What in the hell are you doing here?" He spun Sherlock back around on his feet righting him and pushed up his balaclava.
Sherlock's blood ran cold, he felt tears sting his eyes and herd his heart pounding in his ears. John, saw the moment Sherlock's eyes went blank and struggled quickly up off the sofa to his side.
John slammed his fist down on the table causing everything on it and everyone around it to jump. In contrast his voice was low as he spoke with his head hung and eyes closed. “Give us the room.”
No John. I don’t think you *can* lose me. And just because some of the people you and I persue move in the same circles is no need to worry.
"It's fine John. I completely understand." Sherlock's chin jutted up and John could read the barely checked hurt in his eyes. He made to stand and John reached out grabbed his wrist and pulled him back down and he moved back in close.
“Ten years.” John’s own voice startled him with its aching far away tone as he continued to tangle his fingers through Sherlock’s mess of curls.
"John, you know I need to go to the meeting point." Sherlock was putting on his coat and gloves on as he spoke.
John flatly refused to acknowledge the leap his heart made at the mention of Sherlock's call sign, but leap it did none the less.
“Oh I see, “ Sherlock straightened a bit but did not remove his hands. “I’m forbidden to say the words, but you are allowed to just throw them around all willy nilly.”
Sebastian studied the psychopath in front of him. He had known Jim was insane from the moment they’d met, but to be honest that was half the attraction. It was the epitome of playing with fire. This was the man he loved. The man he killed for, would die for.
"Stop this Sherlock! He's not Thomas! I know how badly Thomas hurt you, I know that he was lovely to you behind closed doors. And I know how betrayed you felt when he denied you in public. But John Watson, is not Thomas Shipton. Will John break your heart? Maybe. I don't know. But he'll never betray you. He's mad about you. And you're mad about him. Don't let that pass."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Dean Greyson, and Thomas, are trying to root out and get rid of 'my kind', Paul is the link between the two, I'm sure of it."
“No!” Sherlock cursed himself for a fool the second the panicked word was out of his mouth. He’d shown his hand and now there it was that shark tooth smile that said I’ve won and you’ve lost. “What do you want?”
“You’re to go back into the field the both of you, as if you’re still on the run from the Russians, and when they come for you...” She hesitated looking for words that would some how make this acceptable.
The campus was a buzz with the apparence of the mysterious "Truth or Dare Night" flyers. The flyers outlined a campus wide game of truth or dare and had been taped to the doors of various students, seemingly at random.
Sherlock slowly lifted his head to look at John. Their noses almost touching. "You would want...more then this?" Sherlock's baritone was thick.
“You’re a fool!” Mycroft was angry and for the life of him couldn’t understand the uselessness of love or his brothers sudden willingness to fall under its spell. He had to wonder what made John Watson so extraordinary?
"I don't sleep." Sherlock interjected aiming for audacious, but came off sounding, breathy and enthralled. He sipped to distract himself.
"John!" John was brought out of his mind by Moran's voice and he realized his hand just hovered, not touching not moving not finding out if Sherlock were alive or dead. Fuck. He reached into the balled up mass to rest two fingers in the hollow of Sherlock's throat. Ice cold, and drenched in sweat. John thanked God. He thanked the old Gods, he thanked all the Gods, he thanked any Gods! He didn’t know or care who was listening or what the price. His soul had been forfeit from the second he and Sherlock had locked eyes.
John stepped into the cool Berlin night air, totally obvious to the old world beauty in front of him. Beauty was behind him, sitting quietly waiting just for him. But he couldn’t expect him to wait six months, most likely more. It was too much to ask of a new...relationship? Was that what this was? The past three days had been unlike any in John’s history. But just because it was beautiful and alien and familiar all at once didn’t make it a full fledged relationship. Did it? In the end it was all just semantics to John. He loved Sherlock, plain and simple. Fuck. So now what? The job was the job, just as it had always been. The problem was he wasn’t the same man. How could he be after...
Sherlock stood as John talked and took off his suit jacket and rolled up his cuffs before sitting back on the floor just a hair closer to John, now his long drawn out legs rested against John's from calf to thigh with Sherlock's toes occasionally brushing at John's waistband. The first contact make John giggle, the second made him burn. He shuddered to think what the third would do.
“I was just suggesting a bit of a cuddle.” John tried to reason more to himself then to the predator approaching.
“Allow me to show you how much.” The devil was in his voice and John knew he was in trouble as Sherlock slid down his body.
“John.” Sherlock let the name play on his lips for no other reason then to feel the mans name roll around his mouth. His hands wouldn’t stay centered in Johns chest, instead they roamed as did John’s. The action was almost innocent, both simply wanting to touch and be touched,  be as near to the other as possible. Not able to get close enough, needing to breath the same air and occupy the same skin.
Sherlock closed his eyes and willed himself not to speak. He didn't want to leave the practice but he knew if he stayed things with Thomas would only get more uncomfortable. Sherlock was just about to stand, when he felt a hand on his knee.
Those words. John could no long hold back. The sight of his cock, slick and wet in and out of Sherlock's body, the thick white cum covering Sherlock's belly and between his fingers as he slowly ran his hand up and down and over the head of his cock still kicking his hips up to bring John's cock flush with his bottom. John came, so hard he thought bones would snap, so completely he felt his heart would stop, so blissfully he was undone. The power of Sherlock Holmes.
