Sherlock came to the club to swim or box or brood, one ear always open for pertinent scandals while lingering over cards or billiards. He generally ignored gossip, but a juicy bit of information could prove to be handy later, he claimed.
Sherlock silently absorbs this short biography. He needs to know one important detail. “What was his first name?”
Their gazes met again, and John was relieved to see an answering gleam in Sherlock’s eyes, a mix of apprehension and wonder and want, the want soon rising to the fore. Sherlock ran his thumb across John’s cheekbone before he leaned down, brushing his lips over John’s.
Sherlock waited as John flicked his gaze down to his palm, and was relieved when he finally clasped his hand. John looked up at him, his mouth set in a hard line, their hands still entwined. When their eyes met, the hard line suddenly wavered, a small shiver passing through John's body.
Sherlock’s face flushed and he turned to put the violin back in its case. “I’ve been playing music since I was six.”
“Beautiful,” he says under his breath, then notices John has fallen behind. He waits for him to catch up.
Sherlock winced at her words, reminded again of his imminent separation from John. “That's very pragmatic.”
He sprinted to the hotel, out of breath by the time he pushed through the doors to the lobby and rushed to the reception desk.
He stared at the ceiling, willing the ache to go away. When it finally subsided, he hauled himself from the water, drying himself with a towel, trying not to bring the memory back to mind.
Sherlock scrutinized his reflection in the mirror, fussing with his tie. God, how he hated ties. But as John had pointed out repeatedly, the occasion demanded it. It wasn’t every day that one was invited to an earl’s holiday fete as a thank you for recovering several priceless pieces of stolen art.
I love the spikiness between Mycroft and Sherlock. Someday Mycroft will soften a little more, and Sherlock will realize how much they both care about each other. But not this particular summer.
Sherlock pauses, drawn to the last photograph. The man, perhaps 29 or 30 years old, gazes toward the camera, his hair cropped close on the sides. His chin and jaw are square, his lips thin. But his eyes — they are older than his face, guarded. He sits on wooden bench, his posture perfect. He wears a khaki tunic with breast pockets and brass buttons, a medical cross insignia sewn on the shoulder. Although his legs aren’t visible, Sherlock imagines puttees winding from his ankles to his knees above hobnail boots.
Sherlock looked away, clearly struggling to maintain his composure. “OK,” he said after a moment, “then I’ll confess. My real first name is William.”
His bed companion shifted, groaning a little and curling deeper under the covers. The night came back in fragments -- it had begun as a drunken evening out with a friend, stumbling home, arms looped over each other's shoulders, collapsing onto the bed, turning, bumping noses, laughing, then growing quieter. He didn't know who started kissing who, but it felt right, hands and lips freely exploring, giving in to a long-held curiosity. His name had been Michael...
Another rap on the door sent them springing apart, smoothing waistcoats and hair. John returned to the desk while Sherlock answered the door. It was the maid, Elizabeth.
Sherlock smiled back, feeling foolish for the bookstore incident, eager to sit across from John, excited for the next few hours together.
After dinner, his father was mixing a drink at the small bar just off the patio, catching Sherlock as he walked by.
The mid-morning sun is hot on the back of his neck as he draws out his hand. He lifts the tomato to inspect it, John rounding the corner of the garden to join him.
They shift slightly, and Sherlock slowly sinks down onto John's hard prick, his knees pressing into the sofa cushions, his hands braced on John's shoulders. John breathes shallowly, the heat of Sherlock's body surrounding his cock like a tight sheath.
John turned his head, catching sight of their blurred bodies undulating in the steamy mirror, soft angles, his cock curving up, slick skin pressed against skin.
The coat slid from Sherlock's shoulders onto the floor. John stood, reached for Sherlock's hips, pulling him closer.
Sherlock met his thrusts, one palm pushing into John's chest, another gripping the headboard for more leverage, their breath ragged.
John shimmers into view, the dark wood visible through his pale silhouette. “I was tired of waiting for you.” His lips play across Sherlock’s cheekbones. “My sister and I used to sneak sweets from the kitchen and hide in here to gobble them up.”
“Good, thanks.” She shook his hand, her earrings sparkling as she tossed her hair over her shoulder. “Nice party, isn’t it?”
Speed was of the essence. He roughly turned Sherlock by the waist so that he faced the wall, their trousers sagging around their ankles. “Put your hands flat on the table,” John ordered, stretching past Sherlock to grab the bottle.
John had no idea that Sherlock knew how to dance, much less that he could make it look so effortless. The only dancing John had ever done was a sort of half-drunk clutching and shuffling around a smoky beer hall crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with other couples, a scratchy phonograph or tinny piano playing. What would it be like, he wondered, to turn so smoothly, to be in step with someone, pressed close and anticipating each other’s movements, eyes locked together?
“And I've learned quickly, haven't I?” Sherlock's eyes went to the electric phonograph in the corner. “Maybe I could teach you a thing or two.” He pushed himself out of the chair, crossing over to the phonograph to flip through a stack of records on a nearby shelf. “No, that won't do… far too advanced for you… ah, here we are.” He held up a record with a flourish. “Something basic and rudimentary. A slow waltz.”
“Reuters?” Anthea suggested, absently running the rim of her beer bottle along her lower lip, still staring at the stranger.
Sherlock stood in a corner with a glass of wine, taking a moment to observe the Christmas Eve crowd. His mother was holding court on the sofa, his father refilling drinks, Mycroft playing backgammon with Uncle Rudy, John chatting with several neighbors.
He turns to face John again, knowing he'll have to leave soon, that this intimate interlude will end, as they always have to. He runs a finger over the top of John's hand that's relaxed on the bed, tracing the winding track of one bluish vein.
Sherlock kissed him, grateful, then smiled against his lips. “We’re going to need to stop at the pharmacy again.”
"Made some chicken soup from the leftovers. It'll help your throat." John handed him the bowl and set the mug on the bedside table.
He almost smiled. It was John's, one of his ridiculous bath products. John had always been one for long soaks, complete with oils and candles.
They stood across from each other, utterly naked, time temporarily suspended. The driving beat from below, a wail of sirens in the distance, a sense of impending violence in the city pressing around them. This could be the calm before the storm, the last few hours before everything descended into chaos.
“Easy… that’s it…” Sherlock locked his eyes on John, gauging his every move. “Gently… God, no! You're grinding -- stop, stop!”
“It is.” John answered quickly, then softened his tone. “It is, Sherlock. Almost everything I want.”
Something in John's words and expression made Sherlock's heart drop. There was a sadness playing across John's face, as if he were looking at something fondly from long ago, their summer already a distant memory.
Sherlock briefly fixed the offending bottles with a withering gaze, then settled his eyes on John. “The sofa.”
His hands stilled, then he cleared his throat. “Anyway, you're trouble enough to keep me busy, aren't you?” He was teasing, and nudged my foot. “Go clean your room. I've got to call your aunt.”
“I'll ring you, okay?” Molly fortified her glass with another splash of wine before threading through the crowd.
A mist gathers, gradually shaping into recognizable features. Sherlock finds it oddly fascinating, simultaneously looking
John felt his cheeks warm at the sarcasm aimed at his unoriginal comment, but he covered it quickly. “It suits you.” He ran a hand over his own stubbly jaw, pondering how obvious he should be. What the hell, he'd just ask. “Where are you staying?”
Sherlock furrows his brow, then notices the faint haze surrounding their hands has grown. John’s form is blurred, dissipating around the edges. It must take an enormous amount of energy to manifest a physical body, creating heat and substance. Perhaps anything else would be too demanding. His scientist brain has a million questions for John, all of which fade when he looks into his eyes.
Sherlock has also wrestled with this triangle and knows he must step aside. “You're her father. She needs you. She needs stability.” And I'm unstable, Sherlock thinks. “I understand.” He's already released John from any obligation.
As they exited the stage, John refused to look at Sherlock, deciding he shouldn’t tempt fate. Mike jogged up to both of them. “That was just getting interesting,” he joked. “Hope that doesn’t spill over into tonight’s festivities.”
He crushed out the cigarette and stood up, dusted off his trousers, then set off for the house in search of his violin.
John breathed in Sherlock’s scent, the warmth of sleep and bed and skin and coffee, and turned him by the hips, his finger untangling from the shirt, the fabric now rucked up at an odd angle, partially exposing Sherlock’s torso as John pressed into him again, this time to find his mouth, kissing him hungrily.
“But you did that thing you do, reading people… just like you knew I was helping my father this morning with one look.”
John reels inwardly as the words hit home, convinced they're meant for him. His eyes meet Sherlock's in the reflection and he worries that Sherlock can see every hidden thought, every fantasy, exposed on his face.
“Unsolved. Call in the paranormal experts. I don't know. But I don't think our ghost will be visiting us anymore tonight. Her work is done.”
He drops his hand that had been raised in farewell and the smile slips from his face. He listens for it -- the solid thunk of the heavy black door closing -- and the silence settles around him. These are always the worst few moments, the slow drips of time after their departure.
Sherlock’s soft expression crosses into annoyed embarrassment, as if he’s revealed too much. He snatches the phone from John’s hand. “Give me that. Your turn.” He scrolls to the next question, his mouth curving up with a touch of evil. His eyes lock with John’s. “What is your middle name?”
“Mum, I'm really not looking, okay? We're just here for the summer.” John rubbed at a stain on his hand, wishing they weren't talking about this. “But I'll deliver the cakes for you. Glad to do it.” He dropped the bonnet back into place with a loud clang, ending the conversation.
“Good.” John said hastily. “I mean, I’ll be staying here, too.” He paused, then licked his lips. “I’m unattached, like you.” There, he’d said it. John held his breath and several painful seconds passed.
Aunt Harry understood, though. She was a loner too. Once, when Dad was away on a trip, Harry and I were in her kitchen eating Chinese takeaway, and I asked her if she thought she’d ever get married again.
Sherlock gives in and starts the engine, turning the heater on high. Cold air rushes from the vents, making his sinuses ache. The small space gradually warms, condensation forming on the side window nearest him.
Fingers at the small of his back, cradling in the nook and slope of muscle, clothing discarded on the floor. Sherlock shivers, his skin overly sensitive as John runs his palms reverently down his back, over the curves of his hips, sliding around his ass.
Sherlock’s heart crumpled as he watched them disappear across the square, Molly’s hips swinging, their strides matched.
I crossed my arms and scowled at my feet encased in stiff black shoes. I hated those dumb shoes. No matter how many puddles or scuffs on the pavement I subjected them to, I couldn't destroy them. I kicked my toe against the floor. This was all Sherlock Holmes’ fault.
Sherlock’s eyes slowly opened, a bit dazed. His head sank against the seat next to John's. “Kiss me like that again.”
They finally broke apart, suddenly aware they had crossed over into new territory, something that could resemble a future together.
John hesitated, glancing back at the house, then down at his feet as if wrestling with a decision. After a beat, he pulled open the door and got behind the wheel, taking a moment to familiarize himself with the controls. He put the car in reverse and backed up, then pointed the Vauxhaul away from town and toward the countryside.
It felt like a hopeless task. The weeds would creep back in eventually, and all his work would be for nothing. Still, it would make his great aunt happy to see her daisies and snapdragons blooming again, free of choking weeds.
John shut the door, crossed the room, and took Sherlock's hand. Sherlock moved over so he could sit on the edge of the bed.
“It’s not a heart attack,” she reassures him, plumping the pillow behind his head. “It was a panic attack.”
“It's scaring away customers,” the wife had lamented, perched on the sofa in the Baker Street flat. “People say they want to see ghosts, but then when strange things happen…”
Sherlock stood up and walked to the window, agitated. Mycroft always had a way of making him feel inferior with his snide remarks and disdainful glances. It made him peevish and argumentative.
I sneaked a glance at him. He’d told me about patients who’d broken their own thumbs by keeping them wrapped inside their fingers when they threw a punch. He called them fucking amateurs. He sometimes swore in front of me, which was thrilling. “Yes, I remembered.”
“I couldn't save her.” John spoke almost to himself, remembering the long vigil by her bed, feeling powerless to help as she slipped away. “I was the senior physician and I couldn't do a damn thing to stop it.”
Sherlock’s hand drifted to his groin, imagining John's weight pressing him into the mattress, humping him through their shorts, peeling off his shirt.
They sink onto the bed, still kissing, and lie down on their sides, melting into the satiny sheen. Sherlock hooks a leg over John’s thigh, notching their pelvises together. His breath catches at the sensation of his cock pressing against John's, a wave of heat traveling up his spine.
Sherlock can smell John’s cologne, can feel his familiar presence. He thinks of their warm bed and soft sheets, the touch of John’s hands on his skin, the heat of his mouth on his body.
John's mind conjured up titillating images based on the noises: Sherlock in front of him on all fours, John’s hands caressing the pale skin of Sherlock’s round arse, drinking in the dip of his spine, the lock of dark hair coiled at his nape as he pushed the tip of his cock into that pink, eager hole…
She's painted the bedroom a different color since he was last here. Before it was a brash, cheerful yellow; now it's a blue-green, the hue of a melancholy sea.
John stared at him for a few seconds, waiting for an explanation, then looked away when none was offered. “You can trust me, you know,” John finally said, not meeting his eyes.
He sets the petal on the bedside table, then turns back to Sherlock, placing a hand on his waist. “I'm glad we took this case,” he says softly.
“John, you amaze me,” Sherlock sighed, his eyes full of mirth. He placed two fingers on the card and spun it 180 degrees. “That's not a W, it's an M. It's from Mycroft.”
Sherlock obliged, wandering off to find a large handful of twigs, sticks, and dried leaves while John went back for a second load.
Sherlock took a last drag on his cigarette and tossed the butt aside before slipping through a back door of the hospital. He knew the maze of basement hallways by heart, easily finding his way to the morgue.
He removes the picture from the tabs holding it in place, then turns it over. A name is penned on the back in a fading spidery script:
John's mouth tightened. “Fine. Forget it.” He turned on his heel and walked toward his bicycle that was leaning against a tree.
And Jesus, he’s tired of smiling weakly at the hints and jokes about setting him up with that single nurse in oncology or the gorgeous radiologist on the 4th floor. He’s not blind; the radiologist is bloody gorgeous. But so is his rather tall and infamous lover he never talks about.
John took a deep breath. Okay. Clean slate. He could do this. Just make a simple overture, nothing too obvious, just test the waters. He casually picked up his phone and fiddled with it, then flicked it over to the camera, bringing Sherlock into focus.
“Says the man who keeps body parts in the fridge. Remind me where those come from again?” John asks, climbing back up several rungs.
“I’m looking for more information about a Captain J. Watson, army doctor. Where he served, the name of his unit, death records, that sort of thing.”
“I worry about you being alone, alright? At least Mrs. Hudson was there to keep an eye on you, and could call me if there was a concern.”
We saw Sherlock fairly often, stopping by his flat to visit for an hour or two. I wandered around looking at all the strange things in the room -- the skull, different types of bullets neatly displayed in a glass case, a brass statue of a dog, insects pinned to a board -- and sometime he’d let me look through the microscope if it was set up on the kitchen table.
“He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1915, and the following year was sent to Basra as part of the Mesopotamian Campaign in what is now Iraq. He was assigned to help establish and run a new hospital near the city.”
A light nip on his bottom lip, a hand at the small of his back, noses touching, breathing in. A deeper kiss, growing bolder, a tip of tongue teasing beneath his upper lip, instigating a multitude of sinful thoughts about other places that tongue might probe.
Sherlock’s attention is drawn to the dark stain on the floor where she had just stepped. Something tugs at his subconscious, just out of his reach. “Uh, no. I think I’ll just stay here.”
He looped the towel behind his back, absorbing the last chilly rivulets. He hung up the towel to dry, then pulled on his blue dressing gown, the cool, silky fabric kissing across his skin.
He starts the fire to warm up the room, then passes the time by reading several scientific articles. On a whim, he begins scrolling through history sites, brushing up on his knowledge of World War I. He had deleted most of those lessons from school long ago. When the endless maps and campaigns start getting muddled in his head, he closes his laptop and switches off the lamp.
Sherlock rubs his jaw, tilts his head. “Have I ever told you... I like your hair this way. It's good.”
He’s not going to overthink it. He brushes his teeth. He shrugs off his suit jacket, unbuttons his shirt, folds them neatly, and sets them aside. He undoes his flies, slips off his trousers, adds them to the stack of clothing. He pulls on soft cotton pajama pants, reaches for a faded blue t-shirt.
John moved a little closer, their bodies merging into the shadows of the office, the space between them charged with an intense energy.
The windows were down so I could breathe in the tangy sea air. I was feeling a bit giddy. I really hadn't spent any time outdoors since… when? All I had seen the past year seemed to be the inside of classrooms and labs.
John slowly takes off his jacket and hangs it next to Sherlock’s. He hesitates, not sure what his emotions are. He crosses the room to the fire and holds out his hands to the heat, letting it radiate through his stiff fingers.
He sighed again, resigned to a summer of studying the stack of textbooks he'd slipped from the university library, taking solitary walks, and sneaking cigarettes far from the house.
Sherlock felt himself responding to Victor’s touch, his eyes drifting closed. Victor was a welcome distraction, an easy companion. He traveled frequently on behalf of his father’s business and had his own flat, their paths intersecting for an evening or a weekend. They enjoyed each other's company, never casting too far into the future.
John shivers, icy chunks of the snowball that Sherlock had thrown at him from behind sliding down his spine. He stalks forward, calculating speed, distance, and trajectory. He lets the snowball fly at Sherlock’s upper chest, relishing how the snow explodes upon impact, coating Sherlock’s hair and face in a spectacular shower of white.
When Sherlock wakes in the small hours of the morning, John is gone. He runs his hand over the cool depression in the sheets, the ticking of the clock too loud in the room, the emptiness oppressive.
“Fine by me.” John met his eyes. “And what about guests? I don't want to be in the way if you have a… special visitor.”
Mrs. Holmes lightly tapped the edge of her saucer with a fingertip, a habit that Sherlock knew all too well. It meant he was going to get a lecture.
“You know what I mean. I don't have to pretend to be somebody else. I could swear like a sailor and you wouldn't mind. Not many people want to think about death and disease, much less study them, but you think it's a wonderful idea.”
John shoots a guilty glance at Sherlock. “I suppose I deserve that,” John mutters. He lowers his head and continues to rub his neck as if it pains him. “I haven't been sleeping well,” he finally says.
Amusement flickered across Sherlock’s face. “Interesting word, kink. It can mean a curl, a quirk, or a cramp.” His voice lowered an octave. “Or an unconventional sexual fantasy or behavior.”
He never was very good at judging those situations; what was shocking to most people was merely interesting to him. Thankfully, this year John would be nearby to nudge his foot or deftly redirect the conversation if he veered off course.
The end of the night found him walking Sarah to her car, their breath puffs of white in the cold. She fished out her keys, then leaned against the driver’s door before unlocking it, looking up at John. “Well, I’m glad we had a chance to talk. I had a good time.”
John is surprised again when he feels Sherlock gently sliding the phone from his grip, his head bent near his. Suddenly they are close, so close, legs slotted together, feet touching through wool socks.
“I'm sorry,” he had started haltingly. “It must be hard to understand why we've been so...” he trailed off.
“Why don't you go on cases with Sherlock anymore? Then you'd be in the news, too, and no one would say I was lying about knowing him.”
Sherlock crouched down, arranging the kindling and a few smaller logs in the fire pit. He rummaged in his pocket, finding his lighter. He flicked it open and struck a flame, shielding it with his hand as he lowered it to the kindling. He watched it catch and burn, orange flames licking and curling at the wood.
Sherlock ran his finger down the side of his glass. He’d noticed John’s hands were bare, no wedding ring. With the professional news out of the way, he ventured into the personal.
He should go back to the flat and tell Sherlock that he was moving out. Maybe he should apologize. He didn't know what he should do.
How was it possible that he had let go of this brilliant, luminous human being, only to be given a second chance? Time with Sherlock was a precious currency he would not waste again.
“Small town, no one’s ever heard of it. My dad was the local doctor.” He slid his eyes to Sherlock. “But you already knew that.”
I suspected most grown-ups had a lot of secrets. I watched too much television (much of it without my dad knowing), soaking up stories about every kind of deception -- fake identities, love affairs, drinking and drugs and gambling, long-lost relatives that suddenly reappeared.
“Come for me,” he dropped silkily into Sherlock's ear. “Come all over the table for me, you posh, dirty boy. I want to watch you paint it.”
John was willing to be swayed by his pleas and took Sherlock by the hand, leading him to his bedroom. They climbed under the covers, instantly wrapping around each other, kissing throats and jaws and collarbones.
Sherlock drizzles more lube onto his fingers and reaches behind with one hand to prepare himself, never breaking eye contact. Desire coils in John's belly, a tight spring begging to be released.
John can't help but notice how long Sherlock's neck is, how the tendons flex as he shifts his head. He never tires of looking at him, truth be told. There never was a face, a brain, a human being quite like Sherlock Holmes.
“You're in a risky mood,” John murmured, sliding his lips to Sherlock’s neck and pulling delicately on his earlobe with his teeth. “What daring thing shall we try tonight?”
It’s at times like this that Sherlock wishes he paid attention to popular culture or watched the occasional Hollywood film. He gnaws at the phrase, wondering why it slipped from John’s psyche. Could John possibly think that
Time passed. Summers and Christmases went by, his contact with John dwindling, fading, put to rest. There were other lovers, other beginnings, private jokes and secret phrases, all eventually ending.
“Shut the door.” Sherlock waved his hand. “So you survived the history of furnishings as told by my mother.”
“Yes, hello, Stamford. This is Sherlock Holmes. About that friend of yours looking for a flatshare -- send him round tomorrow evening at seven. Have him ask for the landlady, Mrs. Hudson. She can show him around and answer any questions. The address is 221b Baker Street.”
Sherlock smiled to himself, enjoying Molly’s rambling as he finished wiping down the car, still thinking about John. The summer, he decided, was opening up a number of intriguing possibilities.
He hates this time of year. It's nothing like it used to be when Mrs. Hudson and John both lived here. He's kept himself busy at Bart's running various experiments and analyses, trying to block out the garish store windows and relentless holiday music by burying himself in the cool, quiet sterility of the lab.
I pressed my eye to the tinted glass, pebbled and distorted. I saw them, pale silhouettes made wavy through the glass, bodies enmeshed on the bed, blurred angles of long limbs jutting out, hands clutching a broad back, legs wrapped around thrusting hips, faces buried in necks and shoulders.
The entire situation had escalated out of proportion, a quarrel about Sherlock's rudeness snowballing into a heated row about his arrogance, thoughtless behavior, and lack of empathy.
John is at the door across the hall, and tries to open it. It's locked. He moves to the next door. Also locked.
The evening grows cooler and deep indigo shadows are spilling across the flagstones when they lean in and let their lips softly meet. Their entire day is in that kiss -- sun and salt air, the cafe and tanned skin, wine and fragrant peaches -- the lazy build to this moment of inhaling each other, capturing bottom lips, slipping hands up sides, fingers playing along napes.
He threw it over his shoulders then drew John into his arms, wrapping them both in its wooly warmth. John's hands slid around his waist, coming to a rest atop his buttocks.
Mrs. Holmes smiled. “I thought you might like to invite your friend, that John fellow. He was very helpful, and a good influence on you.”
“Helping to solve crimes. Estimating time of death, suggesting cause of death, providing your general expertise in disease and injury. Skill with a revolver wouldn't hurt, either.”
A recognition slowly dawns. The gaze they're sharing is not dispassionate. Rather, it is caution layered thinly over raw longing. The tension vibrates around them in the flickering shadows.
“Years of lessons, along with the violin,” Sherlock answered, tossing the butt away. “Mother ensured that we were civilized.”
Sherlock was momentarily taken aback when John pushed his hand away, even more so when John spit into his palm. He soon understood when John wrapped that wet hand around both of their shafts and began slowly working his hand up and down.
He gripped the oars again and started rowing, chastising himself. He needed to study and prepare for the Army. He couldn't afford to treat everything like a game or size up every pretty face as a potential conquest. He needed to grow up.
Guilt seized Sherlock's chest. He was upsetting her, just like his older brother, Mycroft, always said he did.
John continues to shake his head slightly, as if he can't believe this conversation is happening. “Is it enough?” His hands flatten on the table with barely contained rage. “No, it's not bloody
John closed his eyes, lowered his head as Sherlock’s mouth warmed the nape of his neck, his legs instinctively adjusting as Sherlock finally entered him slowly, carefully.
They loitered in the hallway, snogging, stroking fine fabric, losing track of time until the phone in Sherlock’s pocket vibrated loudly, breaking the spell.
Sherlock grabbed two pears from a bowl on the table and led John up the narrow back stairs, down the carpeted hallway, and into his room. He shut the door behind him, turned the lock, and set the pears on his desk.
John takes his coat, drapes it over a chair to dry while Sherlock drops an overnight bag on the dresser and goes to look out the window. John thinks he detects a slight limp to Sherlock's gait.
John lifts his gaze to Sherlock, not angry, not embarrassed, not flustered. Something closer to sorrow is in his eyes. “Don't be,” he says softly, then looks down again. “I should… I should go. Liv --”
John takes a breath, his hand unsteady. “Have you ever been in love?” He dares to glance up, not sure what he will find.
He paused on the landing and glanced through the door. He could see only a sliver of the sitting room, including the back of his arm chair. God, he wished he was sitting in it right now, feet stretched out, a drink in his hand, Sherlock reclined on the sofa and pontificating about one arcane subject or another.
He didn't know why he was cooking so much lately. To use up the damned peas, of course, but he supposed it was also the shorter days, the cold weather that made a cozy kitchen appealing. He enjoyed it, too, the colors and scents and textures of cooking, the satisfaction of crafting something by hand. It was relaxing after a long day at work or helping Sherlock with a case.
Sherlock will let John decide whatever it is -- however it is -- John needs them to be together. He will love him and wait and maybe, someday, that last wall will come down.
So instead of celebrating the case together over dim sum, it was walking home alone through the dark streets, the adrenaline wearing off, his raw knuckles stinging, up the stairs, into the empty flat.
John snatched him by the hips, lightning fast, pulling him tight against his body. Pressed together, chests rising and falling, the game had suddenly changed. Sherlock tentatively put his hands on John's shoulders, gasping when John pushed him up against the wall of the shed, kissing him with a hot intensity.
Ignoring the explosion of applause, John locked eyes with Sherlock, wanting to punch him right in his pretty face, wrestle him to the ground, pin his sinewy, writhing body to the ground, overpowering him -- he stopped, the image pumping more unneeded adrenaline into his already stressed system.
Five minutes later, John eagerly pushes open the same door, his spirits high. The silence and scent of disinfectant hit him in the face like a dash of cold water. He gazes around the empty lab, his plans disintegrating, his heart sinking. He shouldn’t have hoped so hard.
Confusion quickly ripples across John’s face, which finally settles into uncertainty as he looks up at Sherlock.
Sherlock sauntered into the office, taking his time to answer. “I heard New England is beautiful in the autumn. Thought I’d see for myself.” He placed his black leather satchel on the opposite desk, then wiped a finger across the wood, inspecting its cleanliness as he sat in the chair.
“Don’t bother. We can take care of that here.” He bent his head to John’s palm, running his tongue along the ink in a hot, wet trail.
John laughed, bending down to give Sherlock a long kiss. “I’m sure there’s a joke I could make about sliding down your chimney tonight...”
His world had been turned upside down in a matter of minutes, the kiss completely startling, unexpected. He touched his lips with his gloved hand, the roughness of the leather nothing like the velvety heat of John's mouth.
John swore there was something wistful in Sherlock's expression despite his teasing words, but it vanished, replaced by a carefully neutral gaze. John studied Sherlock, drinking in his dark hair that was turning lighter from the sun, the sweep of his cheekbones, the tender hollow of his throat that he now knew so well.
Sherlock licked John’s palm again, swirling his tongue in an elaborate pattern, then guided John’s hand between his legs, closing his damp palm around his cock.
John looks up drowsily, then sees the strange expression on Sherlock's face. His head swivels to the foot of the bed.
She looks at him evenly. “You might want to try it someday.” She glares at his shoes. “And get your feet off my desk.”
“Mr. Callaghan?” Molly scoffed. “He's 85. I don't think he’s likely to take a swing at a young chap like this.”
John paused, remembering. “One day, maybe eight months into my post, I was called out to an accident at a construction site. A soldier had been working on some machinery and slipped. His leg got caught in the gears, mangled up to the knee. He was just a young kid, covered in blood, unconscious … I was trying to control the bleeding, trying to keep his mates calm… and then the shooting started. It was complete chaos. I shielded the boy as best I could. Everyone was scrambling for cover, officers screaming orders over the gunfire… and suddenly I was hit.”
So he lets John set the pace, and gladly writhes under his caresses, turns his neck for more kisses, opens his knees so John can fit between them and hold him down, keeping him tethered to the moment.
Sherlock freezes, stunned. To his horror, his eyes suddenly ache, threatening to fill with tears. He blinks a few times, his throat thick.
He dragged himself to his room and leafed through a chemistry text, feeling like he already knew it by heart. He stared out the window, wondering what John was doing.
I thought back to when Dad and I had finally talked openly about their relationship. Sherlock had told him about our rooftop conversation, so there was no hiding it anymore. It was strained at first, and Dad was obviously uncomfortable.
It happened so gradually that it took Sherlock awhile to notice. A razor, a jacket, a pair of shoes, a book, several neatly folded shirts nested in a corner of a dresser drawer. More than a few items that belong to John have slowly found a permanent home at Baker Street.
We need to hurry to a press conference at Scotland Yard for a case Sherlock cracked, a sensationalistic one the media dubbed “The Santa Strangler.”
He kissed John back eagerly, his knee bending up as he turned into John's embrace. John's fingers laid lightly against his throat, his tongue slipping past his lips. The earth seemed to pulse with life above and below and around them, a deep vibration that Sherlock swore he could feel in his blood.
“Let me just say that the university is highly honored to have you both with us this year,” Mike rambled on. “Your courses are packed, there’s a waitlist a mile long… so exciting.”
“I wouldn't say that, exactly. But you… I’d say that you're a medical student who likes a good drink -- maybe too much -- and worries he’ll turn out like his recently deceased father… He was a doctor too, wasn't he?”
Sherlock lifted his head and she squeezed into the corner cushion, letting out a trill of pleased surprise when Sherlock laid his head back in her lap. She stroked his curls, watching the movie for a few minutes before turning back to her puzzle.
It's strange, how eagerly the public consumes the stories, yet he and John have become almost footnotes in their own history. He’s occasionally referred to as “the reclusive detective” along with his “author colleague,” the retired Dr. Watson. If the greater world has become aware of their cohabitation, it has done so with a shrug. Tales of gruesome murders, blackmail, and thievery are much more scintillating.
Sherlock glanced at her again, her eyes fixed determinedly on the road ahead. He mulled over her words about knowing the summer romance wouldn't last, almost envying her decisive action to make a clean break.
Sherlock wants to be calm and rational, wants to give John time to process everything he's just told him, but he's been waiting so many years for this chance that he can't bear it any longer. He winds a hand around John's in a sudden gesture that transmits every aching second of the decades they've spent apart. His throat tightens. He’ll beg if he has to.
I was growing bored and decided to explore the house. I chose a doorway and followed a short hallway into the kitchen, then turned randomly into another passageway and up several steps. These old houses were like rabbit warrens, all twisty and turny. I hesitated at the landing, then my eye was caught by two figures at the end of the hall.
“Fine,” Sherlock answers absently, his hand still holding back the curtain, watching the gloomy evening.
That was his problem, always wanting something else, never feeling that what he had was enough. He was restless, even though Mary spoke of returning to England in a few years, settling in a nice village, perhaps starting a family. The prospect was more terrifying than appealing, his life narrowing to a predictable pinpoint. While a small part of him sought stability, a larger part craved excitement and the unknown.
John’s mouth curved in a smile that reached his eyes, warming their deep blue color. “So am I.” He kissed Sherlock again, whispering against his lips. “Happier than I thought I’d ever be again.”
This was madness, rutting like two horny teenagers in a cleaning closet, but goddamn, it was exhilarating. John vaguely wondered if security cameras were installed anywhere in the office, but he dismissed it, knowing there wasn’t the budget for that level of monitoring.
Sherlock's voice played in John's head, and John half smiled, knowing he was exaggerating the peril of the situation. He often carried on internal conversations this way, imagining what Sherlock would say. They'd known each other long enough that his ability to predict Sherlock’s responses was uncannily accurate.
John waves a dismissive hand. “I’m half joking. Plus I’ve had two gin and tonics. Maybe more.” He sits down heavily in his chair across from Sherlock, who’s looking peevish. “What?”
The wet clothes were an annoying, chilling hindrance that needed to be discarded. Sherlock made a bold decision to move forward.
Sherlock drifts like a ghost himself through the house the next day, preoccupied and silent. Hannah gives him a wide berth until she brings him a cup of tea in the late afternoon.
White smoke swirled around Sherlock’s gloves as he lifted out the wooden frame laden with honeycomb, Mr. Holmes watching expectantly over his shoulder. They both leaned closer to inspect the bees’ work.
John ran his hand along the buttery grain of the leather passenger seat. He glanced up at Sherlock through long lashes. “Have you been bad?”
The candle flickers when Sherlock sets it on a nearby table. His shirt slips off his shoulders as he slides next to John again, his mouth honing in on John's.
“Don't be a martyr.” Sherlock picks up his bag and strides to the bathroom. “It's a big bed. I want the right side.”
“Sherlock's told me about her work,” John replied, sneaking a sly glance at Sherlock. “Brains must run in the family.”
“We should have declared a truce ages ago.” He nuzzled Sherlock’s ear, loving the way he stretched his neck in reaction.
“Cheeky,” John chided softly, moving his hand to Sherlock's neck, his thumb caressing the skin just beneath his ear. Their eyes met, ending their banter. The world fell away.
He flicked on a lamp and wove his way among half-emptied boxes, side-stepping piles of clutter and stacks of papers that covered the floor, finally reaching the desk littered with a microscope and numerous bottles of chemicals.
He was on his second smoke when he heard footsteps on the stairs leading to the balcony. He turned, surprised to see John. He was alone.
There’s a pause. “Not much, I’m afraid. We keep running into dead ends. I’m confident something will turn up.”
“I'll go first,” Sherlock said, his voice a rumble. He twisted the lock and stepped out, leaving John in the dim room alone with his tangled thoughts. Just when he should be distancing himself for his inevitable departure, damn if he wasn't falling deeper for Sherlock every second.
Despite his misgivings, he had come to this house because Sherlock had asked him to. John had thought he could handle it, thought it might be good for them to get out of the city, a chance to see what might happen once they were alone.
I pulled on his hand, not wanting them to start talking again. He was still gazing up the stairs, and I had to tug hard to get him to move.
He put the letter back into his satchel and picked up the newspaper that a previous customer had left behind on a nearby table. He scanned the headlines for the crime reports, trying to distract himself.
Rested, they continued on past shops and into a sprawling park, strolling by children sailing paper boats on a lake, gentleman walking dogs, couples ambling arm-in-arm.
Sherlock spooned more sugar into his coffee and stirred it methodically, glancing up. “How's the leg?”
“That's very kind, but you could take the photographs, couldn't you?” Sherlock asked, turning on his charm.
His own hair has gone almost completely grey. He needs reading glasses and his shoulder aches in cold weather. Time rolls on and there's nothing they can do about it.
John gazed at Sherlock across the restaurant table, glad to see him wolfing down forkfuls of pasta. It was rare that he ate so heartily, but they had just spent the day running around the city for a case.
John smoothed back a lock of hair from his forehead and glanced away. “I don’t know about you, but I'm famished,” he said curtly, striding toward the picnic.
He lowered his lips to Sherlock's, kissing him breathless, kissing his neck, his chest, swirling his tongue around the pink bud on the left, switching sides to suckle the right, eliciting a moan of pleasure.
John finally pulled back to look into Sherlock's eyes. “Are you sure… you're certain this is what you want?”
He could feel his mother's eyes on him as he strode to the garage with the toolbox, his shoulders tense. He was angry that he couldn't tell her that he
When the day of Mike’s party rolled around, John forced himself to change from an old hoodie and trainers into black jeans with a blue shirt and gray suit jacket. He didn’t really want to go, but he didn’t want to spend another night moping at home alone, either. He’d struck out with Sherlock and should just move on.
Sometimes the shadows fall closer to home. A rooftop. A crackhouse. A different kind of pain, an ache.
“Oh, we’ll leave the bees plenty for the cold months. They overproduce. I suppose they want to hoard every bit of summer that they can, just like us.”
Sherlock settles deeper into bed, trying to relax. There’s a reasonable explanation for everything, but he’s too tired to figure it out. His eyes grow heavy and he begins to drift off, his body warming under the covers.
He eventually turned around and headed back toward the lake, his hands tightening on the wheel when the boathouse came into view. Molly and John were sitting on the wooden dock, their bikes dropped in the grass and their feet dangling in the water. Molly waved and stood up, her yellow dress bright against the backdrop of the water.
Sherlock squints at the clock. 11:13 in the morning. He covers his eyes with his arm, his head aching. He tries to remember when he went back to sleep last night, but he draws a blank.
Somehow, the sight of his soft cock reminded Sherlock how human John was, that he was vulnerable and full of uncertainty, not the perfect golden god he’d created in his fantasies.
“I’ll go wash it off.” John started to climb out of bed again, but Sherlock gripped his wrist tighter, pulling him back sharply.
“In some ways I'm going to miss it when I go back to university,” she sighed, taking another bite of ham sandwich.
Sherlock pulls John closer, a hand curving around one firm arse cheek, locking away the inexplicable, choosing to focus on the tangible. “I thought for a moment it was a mistake coming here,” he admits. “But I was wrong.”
The first touch of lips is so light he can't quite trust that it's real. A faint meeting of mouths, a delicate brush as if they might shatter into a million pieces at the slightest pressure. There is a pause, a sensing of whether to withdraw or continue, then Sherlock feels John's fist tightening on the jacket, and their lips are skimming, pressing, clinging.
John held his gaze as he raised the veil, revealing Sherlock's neck, mouth, eyes. He lifted away the hat and netting, tossing them gently aside into the grass.
It wasn't there, either. John quickly pulled on his jeans and started another search for the laptop, a cold dread forming in his stomach. He looked under the bed, in the closet, in every drawer. He had used it just yesterday afternoon. Thankfully, all his cameras were safe and sound, which made the disappearance of the laptop all the more strange. A common thief would have taken the lot.
They left the pub, vibrating with anticipation. Maybe it was a mistake to do this, to resurrect a dormant passion, to follow John to his room, to reach for each other once the door clicked shut.
John tips Sherlock onto his back then disappears under the covers, trailing his lips down Sherlock’s chest, burrowing lower, his body a curved lump between the tent of Sherlock’s thighs.
Such thoughts made him harder, his balls throbbing. He gripped John's hair, pushing his cock deeper past John's pink lips. He tipped his neck back, giving himself over to John's talented tongue and rhythmic stroking, his breath quickening. He was close to coming, so close, so close… He choked out a stifled cry, shuddering hot bursts down John's swallowing throat.
How have they not said it, John wonders, those three words? It’s been implied, demonstrated, enacted, but never precisely spoken.
John picked up the dog tag that hung around Sherlock's neck, turning it in his fingers. “Seems to me you're not alone,” he said softly.
He replaced the photographs and slid the book back into place, then picked up his violin and bow, standing at the window without playing.
He went to his desk and unearthed a small black address book, then picked up the telephone, rushing through directives so he couldn't change his mind.
Sherlock had instantly recognized a sharp edge in John that other people didn't see. It resonated with his own inner darkness, which was a thrilling, novel discovery. But it was exactly what he didn't need. He had promised to do better, to
John swept the wine bottle into his hand now, jammed the corkscrew into the top, pulled the cork out with a vicious pop.
“Then what are you saying?” John challenges. “That I should just walk away? That I can magically find somebody else and live happily ever after?”
His legs felt wooden as he walked to the loo, hoping no one was behind him. He entered the dim hallway, noticing a wooden door across from the bathroom. Straightening his shoulders, he put his hand on the brass knob and turned it, slipping into the storage room with fake confidence.
He forces himself upright, places his feet on the floor. He stands, straightening his shoulders. Push it down, lock it away, keep moving. London is waiting.
Sherlock grasped John’s shoulders, grinding his cock against John’s thigh, precome spotting through his shorts. John slipped his hands beneath the fabric, kneading Sherlock’s buttocks, rutting against his hip.
The woman looked surprised, then brightened considerably. She tossed the towel to the side, then took several steps forward to shake Sherlock’s hand. “I’m Ivy Smith. My father usually has me do the photos of babies and children,” she said, turning to John, pumping his hand enthusiastically. “It’ll be nice having clients who can sit still for once. Now then, a portrait each?”
They gaze at each other solemnly, weighing the implications of this exchange. John slowly rises to his feet, stands on the bottom step, eye to eye with Sherlock. John's hand flexes into a fist, a sign Sherlock recognizes as stress.
Surprise shimmered across Sherlock’s face, and John stepped closer, drawn to him. “You are insufferable at times, but I wouldn't have it any other way.”
“In fact,” Sherlock continued, warming to his subject, “the receptor of interest, a protein called TRPM8 -- which stands for transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8 -- is an ion channel which, when open, allows sodium ions and calcium ions to enter --”
“Mrs. Hudson saw him first, didn’t she?” Sherlock deduces listlessly. “She’s very protective of her bins. She called the police.”
Sherlock considered this suggestion. His understanding of his mother’s area of expertise was rudimentary, but the work would help pass the time, if nothing else. “I'll ask her about it.”
The back of Sherlock’s neck prickles with the uncanny sensation that he’s seen the man somewhere before.
Sherlock blinked, slowly refocusing, clearly seeing the different paths that lay before each of them, the first steps already taken. “You'll do well there, John. This suits you. I'm glad for you.”
John finally rolls to the side with a sated sigh, throwing an arm over his eyes. “Christ, your hand is big,” he says drowsily, but with admiration.
“And I saw her once, too, on the stairs,” the wife added, nervously twisting the straps of her handbag. “There was a scent of roses, thick and sweet, and there she was, walking up the staircase, her back to me. I dropped the breakfast tray I was holding.”
Outside, the snow sifts down, blanketing the streets and houses, a soft glow emanating from behind the closed curtains of Baker Street.
“I’ll make us a drink.” Sherlock levels his gaze at me, pinning me in place. “Will you light the fire?”
Now he had to say something. “I was in the army until just recently. Stationed in India. I was a doctor.”
The balmy night seemed to draw every young person out of their house and to the town square where they sat at cafes smoking, drinking, laughing, flirting. John was surrounded by his friends, some of whom Sherlock recognized, others he didn’t.
“Yeah…” Dimmock shoved his hands into his pockets, frowning. “So do my parents. And they've been married for 25 years.”
John flopped his arm to the side and stared at the ceiling, his eyes heavy with fatigue. Sherlock was frightened by his own desires, he could see that. He couldn't blame him; if two men were caught together in a compromising situation, the consequences would be severe. They could be jailed, their futures ruined.
He picked numbly at the label on the bottle, sliding into a dark mood. He was relieved to have a distraction when a pair of shapely legs eased onto the bar stool next to him.
The nearest village was dull, and the sprinkle of summer tourists seeking fresh air and long hikes by the lakes were equally uninteresting. He’d read every book lining the shelves of his room. His parents did nothing but potter around the house and gardens, lost in their own absent-minded pursuits.
Sherlock tucked himself back into his clothes, trying to regain his poise. John soon rejoined him, suit jacket on.
“Take this,” Mr. Holmes grabbed a straw boater hat from a hook as they passed through the entryway and shoved it into Sherlock's hands, “and we'll find you a veil and some gloves out in the garden shed.”
John smiled. He actually found the three-day scruff on Sherlock incredibly sexy, the dark etching above his lip and along his cheeks and jawline eliciting certain primal urges. And apparently, Sherlock found the sandy shadowing across his own face alluring as well, for they’d fallen into bed right after a breakfast of hot tea and toast and simmering I-want-to-shag-you-now glances across the table.
“Come on me,” Sherlock urged temptingly, “come on my stomach, my neck, my mouth. I don’t care. Come all over me.”
Sherlock wasn't drawing away, John registered, but was leaning down, their lips inches apart, the room fading away to the narrow focus of their warm skin and breath and searching eyes.
“Well,” John is flummoxed for a moment as he peels off his gloves. He looks at Sherlock‘s back, wondering how to describe the constellation. There’s a map right in front of him.
John readjusted the satchel on his shoulder and the bag of groceries in his hand as he climbed the stairs, already thinking about what he would make for dinner. He had worked all day and pushed home through the evening crowd of Christmas shoppers and commuters, ready to finally sit down and relax.
“Hello, brother dear. I wasn't aware that you were offering your services as a private dance tutor.”
So did John's blue eyes, the color deepening as they shifted from mild amusement to a quick flash of anger. He noticed the way John had clenched his fist at his side, the faint smell of whiskey mixing with overturned soil and perspiration, the set of his jaw -- John Watson was clever, outwardly conforming, but hiding a dark streak that ran toward danger.
“Yes. … Of course I’ll ask him. For once I agree with you. I’ll let you know, alright? I really must dash -- yes, Mummy, I will -- must go -- client -- terribly urgent.” Sherlock ended the call, looking exhausted. He glanced sheepishly at John. “My mother says hello.”
John took a few moments before answering, turning his hands over to inspect the callouses on his palms from the afternoon’s rowing. “Yes… and no. Anyway, I'll be in the Army soon enough.”
That night, after the funeral service was over and the visitors had left the Holmes’, John had tapped lightly on Sherlock’s bedroom door. The house was quiet. Mrs. Holmes had retired early, Olivia was miffed for some reason and had holed up in her guest room, and Mycroft had vanished into the library with a laptop and decanter of brandy.
John watched as casually as possible, unable to hear their exchange, but able to see them shake hands. He noticed how Anthea tossed her hair again, then heard a snatch of her throaty laugh.
The first touch — a delicate lap of John’s tongue on the underside of his cock — makes Sherlock shiver. John holds his gaze, extending his tongue again, swirling it over the taut head, slow and deliberate. Snared in John’s blue eyes, Sherlock tries not to writhe, but his hips tilt up, wanting more, a bead of precome glistening at the slit.
Sherlock finished in his head. John may have been right to call it off. Maybe it would have been easier to part ways now and accept the changes ahead of them. But maybe they needed to consume each other like searing flames, burning brightly but briefly, scorching their way to the very end.
Sherlock appeared at breakfast freshly showered and dressed in a smart black suit paired with a dark blue shirt. John had pulled on an ivory-colored cable knit jumper over black jeans that he rolled up just above his boots.
“Fine. Busy.” Seeing several piles of brush and stacks of logs, it was obvious that John had been busy as well. He decided he ought to provide more detail. “I’ve been learning about beekeeping. It’s my father’s hobby. Now he’s teaching me so I can help.”
Sherlock pushed himself off the bed and returned to the balcony, lighting up yet another frustration-fueled cigarette.
Sherlock took a breath, then spoke. “That night at the bar, when you said you were unattached, I was trying to tell you--” he swallowed and looked away. “Trying to tell you that I’m not good at relationships. That I don’t want to get involved. But then as you were talking to Stamford, I realized you might be the first person I’d ever make an exception for. I panicked.”
Sherlock searches John’s face, several seconds ticking by. In those few moments, Sherlock gleans from John's expression everything he's ever dared hope for, a beautifully frightening revelation: John wants him. His heart pounding, Sherlock leans forward a fraction more and reaches blindly for John.
John had forgotten how quickly Sherlock made leaps in logic, and already felt three steps behind. Somehow Sherlock and Mike had met. “Mike and I were the same year at uni. How do you know him?”
John heard the catch in Sherlock's breath, and he slowed, imagining that his fingers sensed something new under the firm muscles and bones. As a doctor, he knew the power of touch, what it revealed -- the secrets hidden in tissues and bodily rhythms that could not be seen -- but this was fanciful, impossible.
“Look who’s here!” Mike’s voice boomed across the room and he beelined to their booth. “Just who I wanted to see.”
I squinted at my dad, trying to read him. All those late nights, long trips, and conferences… I often wondered how many were real, and how many were cover stories for him to be with Sherlock.
Sherlock looks at her and she meets his gaze. In that second, they both wordlessly admit to the possibility that something otherworldly exists in the house.
Sherlock's eyes were still closed when they parted, his hard edges temporarily blurred. John leaned his head back against the seat, watching Sherlock take form again.
Jonn grins and covers Sherlock’s mouth with his own, twisting his torso for better leverage. They nuzzle and lick and caress, small sighs and moans drifting into the shadows. John shifts, then Sherlock slides his legs a few inches, their arms maneuver, until somehow they’ve rearranged themselves so they’re sat facing each other, legs bracketing each other’s hips.
“He’s in a hurry, isn’t he?” Mike remarked, oblivious to the conversation he had just stumbled into. “Anyway, the party should be good. I’m thinking of inviting Sarah from internal medicine — you know her, right?”
But the thought of John's hand curling around him, John's mouth on his skin, their bodies entwined -- his touches unknown, unexpected -- was immensely arousing. A vivid heat unfurled in his belly and he could feel his prick hardening. Mortified, he pressed himself against the edge of the table piled high with books, biting his lip in a bid for self-control.
Breakfast was coming along nicely when John’s voice broke his reverie. “Good morning.” John sounded groggy, still waking up.
“I’ve invited Mr. Holmes to the guest house,” Anthea interjected. “Bit more lively than this place.”
And yet he'd said it himself -- they were only here for the summer, which was racing by. All too soon they'd be parting, going off to different lives.
“The police don’t listen. Most of them are idiots.” Sherlock settles back into his chair. “Would that bother you, having clients in and out?”
John managed to avoid talking to Sherlock for two weeks, spending as little time in the office as possible, sitting far away from him at meetings, barely nodding in recognition when forced within proximity of each other at obligatory social events. He didn’t want to interact with him, not wanting to stir up any more disturbingly primal thoughts.
“A package arrived about an hour ago. They said you’d be coming to check on a friend, and I should give you this.” The clerk leaned down and withdrew a large padded envelope from under the counter.
He had thought that maybe here, away from everything, he could test the waters with a meaningful look, a touch…
“So good,” Sherlock murmured, wending his fingers into John’s hair again, telegraphing how slow, how fast, how hard John should move his mouth and hand. John obeyed, lavishing Sherlock's cock with expert attention, lapping and swirling, sucking and gliding.
She seems to feel bad about snapping at him and makes a peace offering. “You’re still looking for a flatmate, right? I’ll ask him if he needs a place to stay.”
“My house.” Sherlock said impulsively. He warmed to the idea, suddenly seeing how everything could work. “The help has the night off, and my parents are going to some sort of charity gala. They’ll all be out late.”
Sherlock doesn't answer, still struggling to tamp down the mix of emotions boiling under his skin. The scotch, the lights going out, the Scrabble tiles, the glowing candles, locked doors, luxurious bed, lit fire,
John was about to start in again when he saw Molly spinning along the road on her bicycle, waving at him enthusiastically, causing her to wobble a bit. He lifted a hand in return, concerned she might fall, but she didn't seem perturbed. In fact, she was grinning and quite flushed.
Maybe he did go out on dates and I just didn’t know it. He was away a lot and often worked late, so maybe he had dinner or drinks with someone. I could be pretty blind about those kind of things. Thankfully, he never brought anyone home, and I was never forced to go to an awkward Saturday lunch to meet my dad’s “new special friend” like some of my classmates had to.
Sherlock sits on the edge of his bed, defeated. “I don’t know,” he admits. “I’ve devoted my life to science, and I can’t explain any of this.”
Sherlock had missed helping to harvest the first batch of honey while he was away in London and was only now seeing the fruits of their labor.
Sherlock lowers himself, eyes closed, taking in John’s girth bit by bit, pulling up slightly, then settling back again, surrounding his cock. John keeps his hands on Sherlock’s hips, following his lead, spellbound, moving in response to Sherlock’s increasing motions. They watch each other hungrily, creating a rhythm, a sheen of sweat gleaming on their skin as they plunge and thrust.
Sherlock innately understands and boldly slides his hand between John’s legs. Heat, stiff denim, even stiffer cock. He holds the bulge with momentary awe, his eyes widening further when John’s hand slips between his thighs in return.
Sherlock’s mouth curved up on one side, a faint color blooming on his cheeks. John loved that Sherlock blushed at suggestive remarks, his brusque exterior merely a shell for a much softer inside. However, John was discovering that softness co-existed with a steely curiosity. One moment John could be making Sherlock melt with pleasure, and within minutes he'd be the one gasping under Sherlock's long fingers and plush lips.
Now he was here in New York, as promised. The landing was smooth, customs a blur, the cab ride into the city an overpriced impression of warehouses, tall buildings, a sea of taxis, a Starbucks on every corner.
“I'm not one to give advice, but I would caution you,” Mycroft said, his voice uncharacteristically gentle. “Don't get involved.”
I suppose you could call it spying, but I didn’t do anything pervy like peek through windows or take sneaky photos. They just weren’t always as secretive as they thought they were. I guess they forgot that I wasn't a little girl anymore, and that I noticed more than they gave me credit for.
He stayed submerged, the bath growing tepid. He was reluctant to move, dreading the shock of cold air against his damp skin. But he couldn't lie here forever.
After several more minutes of waiting, John grew impatient. He fingered a smooth stone in his pocket, deciding he would have to take action. Stepping closer, he drew the rock from his pocket and took aim, calculating the speed, distance, and trajectory needed to tap the window hard enough to be heard but without risk of breaking the glass.
Rosamund. Such a weighty name for a tiny baby. But her dark blue eyes are calm, her crescent-moon nails sharp, her grip surprisingly strong when she grabs Sherlock's finger.
Without planning to, he cupped his hand over John’s crotch, palming his erection. John let out a huff of breath, and Sherlock slid his hand deeper between his legs, feeling the hard outline of what lay hidden beneath his clothes. John groaned, shifting his hips.
John gazed at him, biting his lower lip to quell the huge grin that was threatening to break out across his face. “Are you asking me to move in with you?”
“It's perfect,” John breathes against the base of Sherlock's throat, lost in skin and pleasure and the intimacy of their movements.
John pressed his lips against the back of Sherlock’s neck, interlacing their fingers. “I wish I could stay. I wish things were different.”
Men milled by, passing between their line of sight. It was Sherlock who finally spoke first, calling to him across the room.
He watches Sherlock's hands, remembering how they felt skimming up his back to his neck, large and warm, cradling his head as he wept against Sherlock’s chest just days ago. John rubs his forehead, a faint ache stirring behind his eyes at the memory. It was the moment he cracked wide open, and it was the moment he could finally start feeling something again.
“Lestrade phoned while you were out.” Sherlock had already pulled on his coat and was winding his scarf around his neck. “One of my favorites -- a poisoning.”
John smiled, relief flooding his face. He looked younger as he burrowed into Sherlock's arms, his morning beard rough against Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock held the jar of honey up to the window, fascinated by how it glowed like amber against the afternoon light.
Sherlock eases out of bed, slides his arms into a blue dressing gown. He worked late last night and isn't ready for this. He splashes water on his face, tries to smooth down the worst of his unruly hair.
Sherlock’s cock glistened in his jerking fist, his chest heaving. He gasped, his face contorting exquisitely. John watched through a haze, drinking in every detail as he climaxed with a long groan, his dark hair tangled against the white pillows.
Even the lake was dotted with other couples at night, summer romances in full swing. There were a handful of places they could go -- a quick snog in the car with the canopy up; a heated grope behind the boathouse; more languorous midnight encounters in the glasshouse.
he really, really wants more. Sherlock presses into the kiss, seeking more of John’s mouth, his scent, his very
John drifted into a vision of a rumpled bed somewhere, Sherlock caressing his injured shoulder, lips on his neck, legs straddling his hips...
“This wine is from a box.” Sherlock appeared at his elbow, squinting at the red liquid in his own glass.
