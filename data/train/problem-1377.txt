“You should’ve worn shoes built for the weather, you idiot. And, after Christmas, everything moves slowly. It’s nice to take the time to see the sky and feel the wind on your face. Time to be calm, to rest, to relax, to think. To reflect on this year and look forward to the next one. We have plenty of time to get there.”
Thank you everyone for sticking with this so far! I have properly planned out the plot now, so I hope you guys like what you read.
"It was amazing. How you worked out everything about me.” He blinked. That wasn’t what he’d expected. “I hope we meet again, Sherlock Holmes.”
A sudden shriek ripped the still night sky in half and Sherlock spun on the spot, determining the source. Whimpers, moans and sobs were coming from a narrow alleyway, filled with sacks of rubbish and a deep darkness. Sherlock plunged in.
“Fed up of you?” John started to laugh. The low chuckle pleased Sherlock to his core. He loved to make John laugh, even if he wasn’t quite sure what he’d done that was so funny. “Well I won’t deny that you’re an annoying arse most of the time. But somehow, yes, I’ve started feeling completely the opposite of hatred towards you. You’re a complete dickhead, but somehow I think… I’m pretty sure actually. I think I’m falling in love with you.”
Most of his guilt seemed to stem from cheating on Mary. He shouldn’t feel that way, considering, but there it was. He’d never cheated before. It said more about his mystery date’s appeal than anything; that John would forsake principle for a good shag. He’d cheated on a girlfriend, slept with a bloke for the first time, one who was clearly under the influence… and all John kept coming back around to was the colour of his eyes.
When he clapped eyes on John again it was from three carriages down, which was convenient for keeping John in his sights, but also keeping himself hidden. It had long ago stopped feeling like an anomaly and more like a habit, this following John ritual he’d begun after that first night, so it felt more jarring than he’d expected when John got off four stops early than the anticipated Soho exit. He jumped up at the last minute, just as the doors were closing, since the platform was nearly abandoned, and followed. He was lucky John didn’t seem to notice; his own head was down, lost in deep thoughts perhaps.
“What? At least I didn’t try to seduce you with references of gypsy daggers. I thought about it, but I didn’t. Give me some credit.”
“Thank god for that.” John had opted for the same, knowing he’d need a clear head for the night. Too bad no one else in the pub felt the same, since it was the last night before the spring term started. One last hurrah before going back to the grind.
They’re both gasping when Sherlock pulls off, John with the rush of a stellar orgasm, Sherlock with the lack of oxygen. John will feel bad about that in a minute.
John let a slow breath out before responding.  He cursed Sherlock seven times over and he knew his face conveyed this fact clearly. All he received was a smirk.
"Good. No comments yet but it's only been twenty minutes." She looks so proud of herself, as if she's done all the hard work. Did she have to chase down the shooter? No. Did she have to hold him down, get punched in the stomach while wrestling a gun from him? No. Did she have to sit down at the yard for hours while Sherlock argued over legalities with Lestrade and Donovan? No. Were they her words? No. Does he say any of this to her?
They can hear the bloke crash through the brush, cursing when he trips and stumbles. When he rounds the corner from the loos, it’s the bloke whose pistol John has borrowed.
Less than an hour later, under the cover of darkness, but for the bit of moonlight afforded, John and Sherlock, he finds his companion is named, lay on their bellies in the dust about twenty meters outside the rest stop.
He twists the shower knob until the right temperature flows, as cold as he can get, which, as Sherlock predicted, isn’t much. Trousers, shirt, and pants are discarded hastily for the promise of a good scrubbing. Escaping Sherlock is only partly the reason for wanting the shower, he really is covered in a days worth of sweat and dust. The lot of it drains away and John watches as the murky water swirls. He can hear the telly being shut off, even the sound of Sherlock pulling things out of his bag.
“Oh fuck." He jumped up, almost fell, righted himself, and ran for the door. “Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck."
"John, don't move, let me see." Sherlock was on the floor with him, trying to pull his jacket aside to see where the bullet nicked him, just between his seventh and eight rib on the left side.
“Un huh.” John looked at the skull again, as if checking to make sure it was, in fact, just human bone on a mantle.  “So,
“Not that I’m aware,” John answers the statement dryly, sliding the pistol down the back of his trousers.
“Oh,” the woman breathes, “aren’t you a long way from home, sir!” She grins at him like she’s found a rare and expensive jewel. He's never going to get over how easy it is in America to catch a woman’s attention. If the lads back home knew the truth in the rumour, they’d flock like seagulls - another British invasion. Too bad he’s hasn’t actually managed to pull one yet.
John shifted his weight to the side, off Sherlock’s chest, and breathed in the dark, herbal scent of his cologne. “No, of course not,” he finally answered. “It was going to be after a case.”
“Christ, that’s-” he glanced up at Sherlock, who was doing his best not to laugh outright, “smooth.”
John’s fists flexed at his side, and then his left hand came up to point right in Mary’s face. “You listen here. I have never, nor
They don’t talk the entire ride back to Baker Street. It’s awkward, strained; the atmosphere is choking John with the words not being said. Sherlock pays for the cab as well and John leaves him to it, not caring a wit.
“Oh, John, our food!” Sherlock cried out in alarm. He attempted to rescue the spilled Chinese but didn’t get far before his ankle gave way and he cried out, hobbling on one foot.
“What are we doing exactly? You can’t think Greg isn’t going to notice we’ve slunk off. I’d like to spend tonight in our bed, not a cot in a cell, if it’s all right with you.”
He remembered the incredible moments they’d shared just the day before. Stories of Mycroft’s earlier rotund days had nearly rolled John out of his chair.  The correctly predicted teasing over Cluedo had been especially memorable.
“No, I-” Sherlock makes a noise in his throat, one John interprets as ‘Don’t lie.’ “All right, yeah, I’m a little… confused. But I mean, I trust you know best. Who am I to judge?”
Sherlock took off at a sprint out the back of the tent, through the gauzy veils and underneath the heavy canvas, just barely remembering to grab his coat on the way out. He spared no thought for John as he made a break for the side entrance of the park, weaving in and out between trailers and vendors hawking sweets and boiled things. He was about to scale the side of the wooden fence along the outside of the park, when John slammed into it right next to him, and only then did it occur to him that John would follow. He grinned in excitement that John had not only followed but kept up. So he was right about the leg.
“It was obvious if you knew what you were looking for. I’m surprised you didn’t take his advice and keep quiet about what you discovered.”
"Fine," he snapped and then yanked the door John had leant against, knocking him completely off balance.
"No," Greg said immediately. "We can't let that happen. If they haven't spoken before that we need to pull Sherlock out. He'll make a fool of himself if we let him have the floor in that state."
“Right,” Greg scrubbed a hand over his head, “we’re still going to have to get statements. Just wait for me in the car while I clear this up.”
“Did you hit your head too?” John asked and reached out to place the back of his fingers to Sherlock’s forehead.
Mary's tone is teasing but he can see the real question underlining it. He also shifts in his seat, pretending it's an issue of turning fully towards her and not the frission of unease skating down his spine.
Sherlock merely gives him a look over top of his computer. He opens his mouth to comment on something else in the blog but before he can his mobile goes off. Sherlock sets the laptop down on the table and fishes the phone from his jacket.
Clara nods but John can tell she's still curious. "Were you...I mean... Before? I'm sorry, it's none of my business. It's stupid, forget I said anything."
“Yes, sir.” John shot him a grin, disarming and contrite in equal measure, and gave a salute. He left feeling a bit better, though he’d probably come to regret agreeing to the whole tutor idea soon enough. He’d not needed help studying since Year Nine, when Regina Hummel had decidedly
It had been a few hours but there was a good chance he could do it without prep and without extra lubrication. Only one way to find out. He yanked Sherlock’s belt open, the button and zip next, and then tugged until the offending material was pulled down enough for John to get at his goal. He kept the trousers partly on so Sherlock couldn’t spread his legs. This was new and he looked up at John in slight confusion. When John gripped him by the ankles and lifted his legs up, thus lifting his arse up, the goal became clear. He helped by scooting further down and John made quick work of getting his cock out one handed. One stroke and he was ready to line himself up.
“Jeez.” She blew on her fringe. “A football game I think. I can’t remember. Something about him being a friend of a friend, they went out as a group. I’m not really close with her other friends.”
His brother said nothing. They shared a look, a quiet moment alone with their thoughts and their smoke, but that was all. Sherlock was almost ready to try another go at fighting when Mycroft got up and flagged down his car, which had been idling at the corner.
“Let’s just say, I’ve been coveting your arse from afar for a very long time. But tonight is not the night.”
He trudged back to the table, hands in his pockets, probably looking strikingly similar to Charlie Brown.
Sherlock sucked in a breath so fast he nearly choked on it. He glanced down to see John grinning up at him, and, before he could respond, found himself pulled into another synapse-destroying kiss.
“Oh, freezing rain,” John mimicked Sherlock’s posh accent as he tugged his coat on. “That’s better, isn’t it? All I wanted was to sit by the fire with my mellow buzz and eat a whole plate of stir-fry and some egg rolls and some Coke and maybe a packet of Wotsits…”
John moaned into Sherlock’s mouth. “We’re going to come in our pants like teenagers at this rate,” he noted, though clearly not bothered enough to stop grinding his cock into Sherlock’s thigh.
Bill wiped a tear away. “Sorry, I had to. I mean, Christ, you acted like it was this great secret. Did you really think I’d give a shit?”
His grin turned sickly. Apparently the effects of the cough medicine hadn’t kicked in yet. Or perhaps he needed more.
"I...I didn't think that...yes," he huffed and, with a languid stretch, moved his arse closer. John smirked and took the hint.
"You..." John has to swallow against the urge to say something he'll regret, something he’s often found happening more and more. Or the sudden urge to rip the plate of toast from her grasp and fling it into the sitting room. That would go badly.
John continued to laugh, face planted into the couch. After, when he’d calmed down, he asked, “What were you saying?”
“Sherlock is more than capable of hiding your body, John, should he feel the need. Just don’t fall asleep here anytime soon, you should be fine.”
"It’s the first case post in over two years," he mumbles after a beat, hand to her waist. "I just wanted it to be good, you know? If you think it's too...flourishing...I can still edit."
Molly and Mrs. Hudson immediately looked over at Sherlock, and then at each other, neither having to say a word, both knowing all too well what Greg meant.
He nodded with wide, innocent eyes. “It was, until you ruined it. Are you going to make it up to me or not?”
care,” Sherlock snapped. “What do I care if you never shag me? Makes no difference to me. Go on shagging whomever you please, I’ll be
He shrugged. It was possible but Sherlock had no recollection of speaking to the man, or if Mrs. Hudson had mentioned it.
He plucked the thing from Sherlock’s ear, savoring the brush of a few curls, and held his hand out for the lighter. Sherlock scowled at him but handed it over, immediately shoving his bare hands back into his deep pockets. Served him right, making fun of John for nearly forgetting his shoes when he’d forgotten his gloves.
They rounded the corner at Baker Street and Sherlock jogged to a stop outside 221. Delightfully, John followed him right up to the door and inside. They spilled into the foyer with a laugh, both breathing heavily against the wall.
Mycroft sighed. “No, Sherlock, I didn’t. No need to thank me. Just keep yourself alive please. I’m sure they would appreciate you seeing your nineteenth birthday.”
John’s anxiety stops climbing, seems to hold steady. He’s already put his faith in Sherlock’s massive intellect, his vast wells of ingenuity, as stupid as that might turn out to be.
"Yeah. Not as interesting as some of our old cases but I thought you were right about getting back in the swing of it." He glances at Sherlock to make sure he's out of hearing range before he asks, "What did you think?"
"You see, ladies and gentlemen," Sherlock went on, "John Watson is actually a liar and a thief and a bastard but the worst of all these is he's a
able to visualize was John’s glistening throat as his torso wrapped itself around a willing male partner. He’d seen it enough times, after all, chasing John through club after club, watching him drink his weight in alcohol, before throwing himself at any and all who’d catch him. Which was a seemingly endless line of cheerful club goers. Sherlock had a hell of a time steering safe, clean men in John’s direction; it was almost a full time occupation. His reward was getting to occasional witness John in his element, dancing, touching, seducing or being seduced.
His tone spoke volumes and John didn’t miss his meaning. “If I wanted him dead, not even Sherlock would find the body,” he growled. “I want access to the bug in our flat. And don’t pretend there isn’t one, I’m not stupid.”
The constables looked at each other and then mumbled their agreement. One of the men uncuffed Sherlock.
“Nothing wrong with a classic,” she responded. “There’s something to be said for a good, old fashioned,
“John!" Sherlock cried. “Please explain to this woman why her pathetic attempt to goad me is not going to work."
Across the street, John choked down dolmadikias with a smile. Sherlock growled and startled a middle aged woman walking a dog. The dog didn’t even have the gumption to growl back.
He winced but nodded. He did try to pay attention after that but the rhythmic, dull way Gregson droned on drove John round the bend. The professor had missed his calling in public talk radio.
The woman’s eyes light up and she immediately dives into a story about how her best friend in college went to London for a semester but how she was unable to go and how she’s always wanted to and are fries really called chips and does the Queen ever leave the palace and go walking about? She's sinking fast, John can tell. He's just about to reach up and tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear, when a flash of shockingly bright purple catches his eye.
“Quit it,” she breathlessly whispered, contrarily tilting her head for better access. “You’re going to undo all the hard work I just did.”
"Too right, he aint," Janine snorted. "Fucked the groomsman at his own wedding reception! Even I didn't predict that one." She started clapping.
“Bye, John,” they both called out together from the back room. No doubt Laila was already confirming his bisexuality to Beth. He could just picture them snickering together. It actually didn’t bother him all that much.
“Do you see?” He groaned into his jeans. “Do you see now how we are together? This is rubbish. I’m going to have a bloody heart attack before I hit twenty-five.” At the very least go prematurely grey.
And then she started to go off. John turned fully in his seat, wide-eyed and actually quite impressed at the drama of it all. It was certainly drawing attention. He glanced over to see if Sherlock was watching, because obviously that was the point, to find the very last thing he expected.
She huffed. "Who do you think let Jim in on your feelings for each other? Me, that's who. Who do you think told him how to burn the heart out of you?" She asked Sherlock.
Greg picked up quickly where Molly had been going with this. Jealousy sparked pain, causing more consumption of alcohol. Nicely done.
“Baker Street, two twenty-one,” he snapped at the driver, yanking John in after him. He landed up against the opposite door, and, with a bit of wiggling, managed to get John on top of him.
“Kinesthetic learning, you said?” John asked, trying the word out, with another pointless tug on his bag.
, he chastises himself. And then immediately realizes it's a terrible thought. Sixteen year old girls were more apt, and certainly more excused, to feel anguish and self-hatred. At least they had the world telling them they were silly and ignorant and probably wrong about whatever their choices were. Nobody was forcing John to do or say anything- or
Sherlock gasped, eyes wide in shock.  "Oh, John. You were right. It is significantly bigger than your fingers."
He could explain, were he so inclined. Perhaps he’d just let his intellect speak for itself. He was no longer sure he cared what John thought, why he’d bothered thinking he needed to impress him.
“With just my hand,” he mused next, teasing, feeling bold. “What would you do if I used my mouth, I wonder?”
, his conscience mumbled. It had been one of the more transcendental experiences of Sherlock’s young life and John would no doubt be thrilled to know it, considering the obvious pride he took in his…hobby.
“You, an aggressive homophobe, wandering around the part of Soho notorious for its gay bars. Not a hard connection to make there. Sort of a cliché at this point, isn’t it?” He snorted, looking to see if John found the situation as funny as he did.
John bristled. He hated being backed into a corner, but she was right, he’d burst with curiosity if he didn’t know what they were talking about.
When their skin touched, John was shocked to find Sherlock’s hand was very warm to the touch. The assumption might have to do with his porcelain skin- the cool white of his flesh and his aloof demeanor should have denoted frigid tempatures…but it didn’t.
“I heard you were dangerous,” Sherlock gives a gallic shrug, “and yet you were taken out by a middle aged man with a limp. I guess we’re both disappointed.”
“’Summers in Toulon,’” John mimicked. “Not even Bath, fucking summers in France. Christ.” He shut up and went back to deep throating.
“I didn’t mean to either. I mean, to fall asleep. I didn’t mean to...” As far as defenses went, it was fairly weak.
He felt his defenses kick back in, seeing John becoming conflicted. “Absolutely not. It was an accident and there’s nothing at all to discuss. Now, if you’re finished.” He turned to leave but John stopped him again.
The man whips the car out of the drive, but, to John’s surprise, comes back around to the front, where John's own rental is parked. For a wild second John thinks the man is going to push him from the car to deal with the gang of probable mobsters by himself.
Sherlock reached out for the bag, apparently convinced of John’s sincerity, and then leaned over to pull a pack of rolling papers from his pocket. He occasionally glanced up as he filled the folded paper, his dexterous fingers easily pulling the buds apart. John watched the process with a fond smile, as memories of times gone by resurfaced. He would have been sixteen? seventeen maybe? His mate Paul had a cousin who sold pot and they’d gotten high in his uncle’s garage countless times. But then Paul and his family had moved to Bristol and there went John’s supply. He’d been with a string of girls in the preceding years who frowned upon such activities so John hadn’t smoked since.
Bernard tried to puff up, an intimidation tactic that might work on a lesser man, one who couldn’t read him like a book, but as it was, Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow.
The kid looked down at his hand as it continued to caress a woman’s fur lined wool coat. “It’s nothing,” he mumbled. “Any idiot with eyes in his head could do the same.”
Instead of looking offended John sat back against the sofa and laughed. ”All right, I won’t smudge your doodle.” Sherlock let out a tiny breath of relief. Perfect, idiot John. “So is it for a case or were you just feeling creative?”
Almost faster than John could track, they attacked. Well, Molly and Mrs. Hudson attacked, Greg sort of just stood there supervising. Mostly he stood there wide eyed and hesitant.
He didn’t stop to see if John followed as he ran up the stairs, but was yet again proven right when he turned to open the door to 221B to find John behind him. He waved him inside first, which John allowed with a nod. He looked around the flat in curiosity, noting the mess Sherlock was sure, but hopefully not finding it a deal breaker.  Sherlock tossed his coat at the sofa and walked forward with his hands clasped behind his back.
“That must be interesting,” John filled the tense silence, unaware of exactly why the brothers looked ready to do murder but willing to help ease the tension. So kind, his John.
More giggles escaped as John pictured Sherlock with a hammer and chisel, tapping away, making a mess for his landlady to find come morning.
“Oh yeah? And I’d like to take Jessica Alba out to dinner, but my dreams aren’t coming true anytime soon either.”
Sherlock went into deduction mode right away, his long legs ate up the floor as he made his way around the dingy flat. John couldn't help but watch in awe as he mumbled out deductions, observations, and critiques about Lestrade's men as it pertained to his work, or the hindrance thereof.  He stopped on a dime and flung his coat off, as the pace he'd worked himself into seemed to affect him temperature. A near unknown phenomenon in John's experience, but damned if he took it for the clue it was.  He flitted back and forth from the kitchen, opening cupboards and drawers, to the sitting room, where he flipped through books on the mantle and coffee table. A triumphant exclamation upon finding an ounce of cocaine inside one and a roll of pounds in another and then a scowl when Greg quickly reached out and snagged both from Sherlock's grasp. Greg tossed them to the C.S.I. on duty who quickly bagged them. John nodded in thanks when Greg turned his way with an eyeroll.
“Mmm,” he growled back incoherently, hand still in Sherlock’s hair holding him back. He tried casually sliding a hand up and down but John snarled and fell back off the bed. “You will wait!” He snapped. “You said I could have what I want, remember? Get naked.”
He gasped for air, shoved himself into the tight grip, dug his toes in, and then threw his head back as he came. The pleasure was indescribably intense and it spread out in waves from his pelvis to his toes and back.
John stared for a second longer than he normally would, watching as Sherlock expelled blue-tinged smoke slowly from his lips. Watched transfixed as it curled around Sherlock’s throat and chest as it crawled down, down into his lap. The rest was blown against the end of the joint to send ashes to the carpet.
The kid stared, looked John up and down with strangely sober eyes, and pursed his inappropriately full lips.
“John, I’m sorry. I should have said something. You thought I was nothing but a friend and I betrayed that with my desires. I’m sorry, John, I’m sorry. I won’t touch you, I promise, just don’t leave me. Please don’t leave me.” He tugged his coat up around his ears, a futile attempt to block out the sound of his own voice.
Sherlock stomped his foot. "Before I knew I had a choice! You never said a word, in fact, you've done nothing but deny it since day one!"
He pulled away slowly and very carefully curled up on his side. John frowned. What had he done? He laid his hand on Sherlock's hip but the man flinched away.  A pit opened up in John's stomach at this horrific turn of events. His instincts screamed at him to flee, to quit the room before he made more of a mess than he already had but he couldn't do that. Not with Sherlock, not about this. He crawled up the bed until he lay beside Sherlock on the pillow and, as cautiously as one would a wounded animal, he brushed the fringe away from his eyes. They were squeezed shut as if to keep John from seeing him.
John stared at his shoes as if none of this were happening. He'd rather they went back to talking about brains in jars.
He glanced up at Mrs. Hudson, who was watching them with a look - a fond one, but with a hint of hope in it that twisted John’s guts.
“Nah, man, Holmes says he’s got information on Lillian. Wants to talk to the boss,” Mitch informs his partner.
They were talking now, catching up, a light in Sherlock’s eyes speaking volumes. John had seen him sham before, this was genuine emotion. The words didn’t even matter, all that mattered was Sherlock laughing into his cup as Victor sat across, smiling shyly into his own.
He lay back against the pillows, arms behind his head as he continued to grin. "I'm not the one with the problem."
Sherlock tilted his head slightly, his body rolling to follow, and he studied John like he would a mold spore under a microscope. John willed away any treacherous blood thinking to redden his face.
“Yes, John,” Mycroft answered. “That is generally how counting backwards works. If you’ll both excuse me.”
That was how far John had fallen from his golden boy status, he wasn’t even aware of where his grades sat, in this class or his others. He hadn’t cared. Medicine was supposed to be his dream, the great accomplishment of his lifetime, and he was fucking it up already.
Slowly, so as not to tip the tray, and also so John didn’t think he was in charge, Sherlock rose from his pillow cover. The light from the window had him blinking away at the painful stabs to his retinas.
Sherlock looked up at that with more anger than John had seen in weeks. “I never once said I wouldn’t study with you,” he practically hissed.
John smiled at her and tried not to make eye contact with the barker, but it was too late, he’d seen Scarlett signal at the game.
Laila snorted into his hair. Eventually she pulled him away from her with a hand to the back of his neck.
Outside he stands on the kerb and attempts to flag down a cab. It’s not until a much longer arm reaches out that one stops.
John jumped, his skin heating to an embarrassing degree at being caught with his proverbial pants down.
Sherlock held up a finger, digging into his trousers for his phone. “Siri. Find opium dens in London.”
"Why don't we toast to John and Mary?" James suggested with a cheeky smirk of his own. It was good to finally see that smile again.
Sherlock stared up at the ceiling, tracing  the lines of the plaster breaks while he willed his tongue to unstick from the roof of his mouth instead of just wordlessly screaming. “Yes, you did. In the first half.”
Sherlock's mouth fell open but before either of them could discuss the issue further someone pounded on the door and demanded entrance.
He couldn’t help but to show off, a bit. “Your grandfather, the reason you decided to become a doctor for yourself, not just because your parents wanted it for you. You didn’t get the tattoo until you decided to become a writer instead, as a reminder that you could still remember your family history even if you didn’t fulfill that particular wish.”
He rolled away so Sherlock could sit up. He wasn’t sure if John could see his frown but he did his damnedest to broadcast it despite the near-perfect darkness.
He raised up and, with a small frown of concentration, moved them into alignment. Sherlock did his best to hold perfectly still, both to ease John’s path and to help memorize the moment as it happened. With the condom in place, it was hard to pinpoint the exact feeling - he’d have to have them tested soon so they could eventually do away with the thing - but soon the feeling of entering John became abundantly clear.
“They’re in the car, I’ll grab ‘em.” Mitch runs off and Miller points his returned pistol at Sherlock’s head so they stay put.
He handed John a card on his way out - a pass in Mycroft’s estimation, not that Sherlock cared - which John glanced at in confusion.
John found himself flung aside as the bloke rolled from the bed. He yanked his hood over his head, pulled it snug, and then bolted past Mike to the party beyond.
If he only had a minute, he had to be quick. It was risky but he had to, there were too many images flickering behind John’s eyes now to calm his raging body. The loo would have been more secure but there was a damn frosted glass door separating the rooms. That wouldn’t do at all.
“Boring,” Sherlock huffed. He flopped back down onto the sofa and pierced John with a glassy stare. “Truth or Dare?”
“Yes,” John drawled, confused. “I’m back now.” He removed his hands from Sherlock’s shoulders when the heat emanating from the man became too obvious to his receptive palms.
“I did?" He glanced at John, ready to apologize, but the look on John's face stopped the words in their tracks.
Before the lie could even fully form, he brushed it aside. He knew why he’d done it. Might as well be honest with himself- John had wanted to recreate that first night. Simple as that. He’d been desperate all right…
“Try not to look conspicuous,” he ordered and then slowly let himself float away from the group. John mentally rolled his eyes but followed as the man sank into the shadows in a manner befitting Dracula himself. John probably looked more like The Count from Sesame Street- the smaller, cuddlier version.
John flinched at that. It was enough. He had to stop the progression before she blurted out something he couldn’t recall from her lips.
The noise of the room was getting to John. The bass from the stereo seemed to be churning the liquid in his stomach into a giant tidal wave of promised revenge. He slapped a hand out at Mike and grumbled, “I need somewhere to chill out.”
“You’re not really mad, are you? Cause I was at work. I mean, you knew I was at work. I’ve told you before about how Laila feels about phones out during open hours.”
Sherlock was a terror. A mute miasma of plucked strings and flapping coat tails. A minefield of psychosis and human remains - one wrong move and something would explode. Ever since the cough syrup incident it was like living with a ringwraith, all black moods and hunting expressions. Sherlock hadn't taken any more questionable substances, as far as John could tell, but John wasn’t sure trading that for this was preferable.
is the song John is singing to Sherlock at the end there. It's another Bill Withers classic. In John's mind it makes up for the wrong pronoun fiasco in chapter five.
John probed at the corner of his lips with his tongue, the tender flesh stinging now that the rush of serotonin had fled, and was grateful Bernard hadn’t pushed him that far. His love of a challenge was going to land him in A and E one day.
John pressed his lips together against a grin, forcing the smoke to stay put in his chest until he was ready to set it loose. When he did, he blew the cloud up to the ceiling before passing back to Sherlock.
The whole time she talked, John just shook his head obstinately. “I can’t think that way. It’s too dangerous. If you’re wrong it’ll wreck what little bit of friendship we do have.”
stupid." Molly didn't like the look of that Bridesmaid. It might be petty jealousy but she didn't think so. Something about the woman set off her instincts. Something familiar.
John’s smile didn’t abate as he fiddled with his drink, sloshing the liquid inside so that the carbonation gave a hiss.
Sherlock was too busy sorting out the hot feeling in his gut to explain to John that he frequently sent out sexual signals like a homing beacon. There was something to that idea, the angry sexual punishment scenario.
"Oh no," Molly cried, "I know that sound! Somebody is squeezing a cat too hard, the poor thing. We've got to find it!"
“Not at all, in fact. I wasn’t to contact you at all. Had a lot of idea’s on how I should conduct my investigation. She’s a… difficult woman to work with.” Oliver chuckles at this, an agreement. “I decided to take matters into my own hands and dispense with the subterfuge. I’m to meet Ms. Barclay at the Lancaster Hotel in Houston on Monday to divulge my findings. Two o’clock in the bar downstairs, if you’d like to cut out the middleman and confront her yourself.”
“As pleasant as that would be, it would satisfy too many people at London Metro if I died from sexual frustration.”
“He left.” John glanced at the plate of sausages. “Suppose we’ll have to pay for that,” he noted absently.
Before Sherlock could answer, John pushed the door open and muttered an invitation for Victor to come upstairs. They filed into the sitting room, Sherlock rushing to make tea, leaving John and Victor to stare awkwardly about the room rather than at each other. John found himself vacillating between taking his chair and forcing Victor onto the couch or taking the high road and letting Sherlock and Victor sit together. What he truly wanted was to leave altogether but the curiosity was too much. Where had this man come from and why? Who was he really? And what was it about him that made Sherlock fidget like a man out of his element?
He flipped the DVD in the air and caught it; for a long while he did this, until it became obvious that John, despite all evidence, had not actually found his boring date to be boring, and wouldn’t be coming home.
“Where are you two off to?” Mrs. Hudson questioned from her doorway as they made for the front door.
John smiled, knowing he’d been obvious. “I just wanted to say, to ask, rather, that you… not do…” He took a breath and laid his hand gently down where Sherlock knew those damned track marks lay. “Will you promise me you’re done with this? I mean, I assume you’re clean now,” he rushed to say, “but I don’t know if I can handle finding out you’re not.”
“Don’t you dare,” Sherlock snarled. “I’ve been close all night, you could have had it at any time, and you’re going to rob me
John protested but Greg laughed him off. “Nobody will hear it from me, mate." John didn't comment on that. “It'd be nice to see Sherlock pair off with somebody though," he offered.
“Mmm, yes. I suppose by your standards,” he drawled, every inch the country lord John imagined he could one day be.
Before the man can effect a counter-maneuver, the most absurd thing so far happens. A gun appears in the doorway, a Sig Sauer p226, with a tanned arm attached, inching further inside. John, again, doesn’t think, just acts.
“Is it, Sherlock?” He snaps, looking for a response. “She’s not between us because there is no ‘us’, there never will be an ‘us’. I realized today I’ve been holding a torch for three and a half years, hoping that one day you’ll just wake up and say to yourself, ‘Oh, I think I’ll fall in love with John today.’ How sick is that? You’re helping my fiancée plan our
It seemed counterintuitive. Granted, Sherlock’s understanding of sex was limited - practical application only having occurred in the last three months - but the term didn’t mesh with his understanding of coitus. He wasn’t a child; he knew the platitude “when two people loved each other very much…” was rubbish but honestly, what would make a person engage in sexual activity with someone they hated? There were plenty of people he hated. The postman, Anderson - less than before but still on a low simmer - several classmates from Uni; the thought of them in any sexual context nearly made him retch.
"Think about that night in the skip...do you remember? We got trapped in that alley and you cursed at me for hours because it started raining. You said it was the worst night of your life. Think about that."
The tip of John’s tongue darted between his lips, but it didn’t take a genius to deduce that it was anything but sexual. John looked ready to launch himself across the table between them and choke the life from Sherlock. Tap, tap, tap went his fingers on the chair.
John sat up in bed to better see his friend. “No. She got me the job at the café, so we see each other at work a lot. I’ve helped her with some issues with an ex she had. We’ve had lunch together a few times, but dating? No.” It was a simplification of events but the truth was none of Bill’s business.
He pulled away to speak, replacing his tongue with a petting thumb. “Are you ready to come?” He growled.
John watches, interest piqued, as the twenty-something year old sets her bottle of cherry flavoured Coke down on top of the map, waiting a tic to see if the wind will send it rolling over the bonnet of his rental. When it stays put she beams at him.
He already knew the hinges were well oiled and wouldn’t squeak, so he pushed it open slowly until it was wide enough to fit his head through. John was in bed, his back to the door, curled up on his side, with only his head visible above the blanket. The magenta, yellow, and cyan flickers from the telly painted John’s dark blond head in multi-colored hues, and Sherlock’s stomach flipped to see him look so small and vulnerable. The previous night Sherlock had dared the same, the night he’d come for his coat, John had fallen asleep sprawled atop his blankets like a starfish, remote control in hand and mouth open on a light snore.  He hadn’t looked nearly so dejected, or so it had seemed... not compared to this.
." He spit the last so vehemently John had a split second to question if he really was a coward, before his rage wiped the need for introspection away.
John pinched him on the arm, which started a small battle of wills, distracting them from the argument for a short time. John eventually pinned Sherlock’s arms down and leveled a stare at him at that effectively kept him from complaining. He’d have to learn to circumvent that in the future, but until then he was stuck listening to John’s counter argument.
He quickly scanned over the various scenes John had drawn of them together, more ugly broken hearts throughout again. The drug den, with a small needle sticking out of Sherlock’s arm, Sherlock with X’s for eyes in Magnussen's bedroom, the confrontation with Mary in Leinster Gardens, Sherlock shooting Magnussen, Sherlock leaving on the plane. So many broken hearts. It was a wonder John had even come back after Mary was carted off by Mycroft’s men, if this was what life with Sherlock had done to him.
"Hmm? Oh, yes," he agreed with a smile at Sherlock, who continued to ignore him. John turned to Mary. "That is if the wife deems."
Sherlock’s second orgasm was less intense than the first, but with the added benefit of feeling John swell and shoot against his back, it was the better of the two. His bones turned to liquid and he fell against the bed a second time, swearing never to move again. With John on his back, it wasn’t a hard promise to make.
He needed to get it under control. How much longer could he hide his almost daily reaction to Sherlock’s presence? He’d been so sure he could end the stupid fighting debacle by a clean win. He’d
Sherlock was overwhelmed by the urge to crawl between John’s arms, bury his head into the crook of John’s neck, to feel the warmth of his chest against his own.
"Mmm," he hummed vaguely. "Not much. Over heard one of the cooks say they had lady fingers in the van but turns out it's a type of pastry. Boring."
“Yes, well, I don’t believe I was in my right frame of mind when I agreed to this little field trip.” His lips snapped the ‘P’ with precision.
“Yes,” he finally conceded. John readied himself to go in for the kill, before he was abruptly cut off. “His name was Victor. Still is I imagine. We haven’t spoken in a while but I assume he’s still alive.”
They made it to the loo and Greg locked the door behind them as soon as it shut. He turned to find Sherlock sliding down the wall; his bum met the tile with a thunk and his chin met his chest heavily.
Inside the confines of the police vehicle, Sherlock whimpered and slid down until his head met the cool leather material of the seat. It smelled of alcohol and sick but notice of it was tucked away in the background, as memory of why he’d gotten stupidly drunk on cough syrup began to surface.
John steadied him with both hands to his shoulders as he winced in pain. “Steady on. You’ve probably exacerbated the ankle. Daft git. Seriously, what did you come up here for?”
His arm came almost all the way back and sent Petrov’s club sailing out of his grasp with a crash. The man looked stunned and quickly put his hands up in surrender but Sherlock didn’t stop there. In a blur, he managed to slip the pipe between the man’s cuffed wrists and then wrench it sideways with both hands. The man cried out as he had no choice but to turn with the motion. His legs were then kicked out, the pipe flipped up, caught at the end, and then brought down sharply across his temple. John stood aghast as the perp fell, forehead bloodied and eerily silent.
Sherlock felt his brow had furrowed in his curiosity, likely prompting John’s question. “Possible case,” he muttered.
He watched, and felt, as John’s hands slid from his wrists, down his arms, to map the contours of his too skinny chest. What John could even find remotely attractive about it Sherlock didn’t know, but that he did was obvious. The way John’s eyes lingered here and there, his tongue making appearances every few seconds, the flush of his skin - the signs were there and Sherlock didn’t mistake them for anything other than sexual attraction.
A petulant silence followed immediately by, "Just hurry up. I can think of a thousand other things I'd rather be doing than this."
“Sorry,” John said with a unwarranted giggle, “got talked into a round of trivia and then somehow karaoke.” He slapped a hand over his forehead. “God, I must’ve been drunker than I thought.”
“Fuck, oh, fuck, yes,” he rambles at the ceiling again. It won’t be long now at all. Sherlock has already deduced how to hold his bollocks tight, tugging just so. John can feel his heels digging into the mattress, how his hips desperately want to kick forward. Sherlock seems to sense this as well. John looks down when Sherlock growls at him, which, if he wanted to last at all, is a mistake.
“What do you know, I’ve rendered you stupid.” John grinned down at Sherlock’s look of affront, just before he kissed those insanely snoggable lips again. He pulled back again to whisper, “I want to show how very not straight I am. Can I do that?”
Sherlock’s mind scrambled to catalog each new feeling, but he was unable. There was so much to take in, each movement sending a different sensation to Sherlock’s brain. He felt as if even the traveling of the signals passing up his spinal column was an act onto itself. Hot air, wet tongue, wide strokes, pointed ones, circles and stripes, there wasn’t a missed note, everything worked. The noises John made as he went even served to send Sherlock closer to the end result.
“Pathetic,” John heard from the sitting room. When he rounded the corner, Sherlock was sneering up at him. So much for the possessive declarations.
John cleared his throat meaningfully but the noise flew right over Sherlock’s head. To be fair, they hadn’t had a real ‘study session’ in the last two weeks. Once John had grasped the issue with his way of learning everything had coalesced rather nicely, and he’d finally caught up in his school work. Now they mostly spent their time on cases or generally just hanging out.
Mycroft continued on as if a break in the conversation had never occurred. “Speaking of fraternizing with denizens of ill repute, I ask again, will you please refrain from giving handouts to vagrants?”
John continued to stare, his head rocking back and forth in confusion. “No.” Christ, he didn’t even sound sure.
“Why didn’t you tell me? I would have come home sooner. Christ, if I’d known that I would have just stayed home.”
John took huge, wracking, sobbing breaths, lips still busing against Sherlock's. "I didn't know. You never-"
It was then that John noticed the gun in her hand. His whole frame locked down instantly, part of his instincts kicking in, another part baffled by the insanity of the image.
John’s eyes crinkled, just the way Sherlock liked, as he smiled warmly up at him and patted Sherlock’s shin - a careless, casual touch, like it didn’t even matter.
Sherlock looked down in surprise but with a small smile, like John had asked a good question. John’s step shifted unconsciously to something bouncier.
Rather than continue to wait, Sherlock spoke without prompting. “Mycroft, my elder brother. He’s my legal guardian while I’m staying in London. My parents travel a lot, you see.”
"What?" He thought back; yeah, Sherlock wasn’t wearing his scarf. Hadn’t for a while actually. “What does that have to do with anything?”
Mycroft gave his patented smirk, knowing Sherlock well enough to know that belittling Mycroft’s weight meant he was uncomfortable. Sherlock didn’t allow his shoulders to hitch in the slightest, lest Mycroft read into that as well.
Sherlock stopped frowning when John climbed back into bed, though he sat back against the headboard instead of crawling back under the blanket. Sherlock sat up as well.
"It's not nothing, it's sexual repression. You shouldn't let it affect our relationship, John, it's unhealthy."
Relief flooded Sherlock to see he hadn’t actually broken John’s rib; John wouldn’t be sitting up if he had. He watched as John’s hand slid into his coat pocket and slowly produced a handful of broken skull fragments.
Sherlock didn't mean to flinch but it happened anyway. He clenched his eyes shut, shutting John out, his embarrassment complete enough without seeing the derision on his face. The instinct to strike back came first but he
When Sherlock slumped back down, boneless and whimpering, John pulled away and set Sherlock’s legs back down gently. He noted the way Sherlock’s skin stuck to the leather upholstery, and thought the chair was probably the wrong venue for their activities, but it was too late to for that now.
Silence greeted him on the other end. Had he really surprised the great and powerful Mycroft Holmes?
John ripped the whole thing apart, buttons went every which way, and then John fell upon him to bite at his trapezius. The argument was forgotten immediately as his arms splayed out and they fell back against the mattress.
His explanation was abruptly cut off as John realized he was alone in the sitting room. He stared in confusion at Sherlock’s empty chair, noted that the plate of biscuits had been up-ended as if Sherlock had gotten up in a hurry. Instinctively, he moved toward the plate to clean up the mess, but a more pressing matter needed to be addressed first.
Whatever else Sherlock blathered about was tuned out as John registered the man at his side through a film of red. Why did god hate John so? That was the only explanation for the foolishness we was currently witnessing.
"We need a different strategy," Mrs. Hudson suggested. "Maybe we could shove them into a closet together and lock the door?"
Sherlock could only hope whoever the next student was, they weren’t a complete idiot. He’d had plans after Antoinette Riser’s study session. Things to see, people to snog.
“Mmm,” John groaned into Sherlock’s mouth. He had Sherlock by the sides of the head, both elbows planted by his ears on the pillow, as he slotted their hips together.
“Like that?” John teased, the bastard. “Me too. Ugn, there it is,” he moaned in pleasure as he did it again, a slow slide up and down, and added to the torture by making little noises in his throat. It wasn’t fair, it just wasn’t fair. Sherlock was too intuned with every detail, it wasn’t possible to shut off all incoming data.
He hits the stall and swiftly releases a torrent of ginger chicken, bits of spring roll, and Coke. Being face down in a Thai restaurant toilet bowl when he isn't drunk enough not to care is probably the low point of John's already shit day. He knows he's a right idiot, for more than the several reason's he can come up with off the top of his head, and there are
? I thought we had our chance to confess already but we didn’t, did we? If we can’t say it with our last breaths why would I say it just because you’re about to get married? Were you any more attainable for me with Sarah or Vanessa or Lindsay or Jeanette? No! Because we can’t do this! Just because you want something doesn’t make it okay!”
“Same as you, I imagine,” he answered, ignoring the second part completely. “I abhor humanity in general and the musical styling left much to be desired.”
The instant Sherlock understood he took a step towards her, to do what John wasn't sure, but before he could even reach him Mary already had the Sig pointed at his head.
The bottom falls out of John’s stomach. He’s just sexually assaulted the most interesting person he’s ever met. “Oh, god, I’m so sorry, I thought-”
“That wasn’t the proposition, John.” He snorted in amusement. “Though it was a happy divergence. Surprising and quite satisfying. Thank you for that,” he remembered to say, in case John was feeling unappreciated.
Sherlock looked up, suddenly sure he'd blow it somehow. “Why? Did you not… Was last night not…satisfactory?”
“Right,” John drawls, but to himself he’s wondering why he hasn’t thought of this already. It’s like he’s imprinted on Sherlock, an orphan duckling, following in his shadow without thought. He should have been thinking of this, because he has no idea what comes next. “As long as there isn’t a woman with a lit candle trying to show us the way…” He chuckles at his own joke.
Sherlock hummed noncommittally from his usual space at what had once possibly been a kitchen table. His face was hidden from view as he studied what was no doubt the next great scientific breakthrough of the century, which would quickly become notes scribbled on the back of an electric bill and relegated to the bottom of a cardboard box.
“Consultant, hmm? Do consultants need to hop across the Atlantic to chase drug lords though? Couldn’t you have guessed, or whatever it is you do, his whereabouts and just pointed the police in the right direction?”
John went as far as to shove Sherlock sideways into an alleyway. It took a moment for Sherlock to right himself but once he did, he moved to step around John. He wasn’t going to let John get to him. He wasn’t!
Sherlock shuffled uncomfortably. “I rarely partake so there’s really no need for it,” he tried to explain but John chuckled and shook his head.
John licked a stripe up Sherlock’s cock and, no hands, managed to get the thing back into his mouth. Sherlock went back to panting and squirming, this time his heels digging into John’s back as he pulled John closer. It was quite easy, John noted, to suck at Sherlock’s prick no hands when he was so hard his foreskin was fully retracted. Sherlock seemed to respond most when John sucked hard at the tip, so he concentrated there, only alternating to roll his tongue around it, letting his saliva pool enough to make the wettest bed to rut against. Before long Sherlock’s loud panting turned into loud groans, and then louder, urgent cries.
Greg slapped a hand on his back and leaned in to mutter, "No one gives two figs about it but you John. Or have you not noticed that Sherlock has stopped wearing his scarves lately?"
It was his first crutch. It wouldn’t be the last, but it was the only one that had stayed after all these years.
"Oh, is that all?" Mrs. Hudson scoffed. "And what am I? Chopped liver? What do you think I've been doing for the last four years? If it were possible it would have happened already. I
Sherlock continued to pace and mumble as John skirted him to hang his jacket up properly. He walked back to the kitchen to set about making tea, a distraction until Sherlock was done… whatever it was that he was doing.
"Do I get an apology from you, brat?" Greg addressed Sherlock with a smirk clearly seen from the mirror.
A look of smug accomplishment fell over Sherlock's face. "Really?" He teased the head of John's cock against his entrance and John hissed.
John hazards a glance behind him without turning. Sherlock is sitting on the edge of the bed facing John, waiting patiently for John to figure out what he’s saying.
, he thinks. The water turns on and John shifts uncomfortably on the bed. He can hear Sherlock moving inside the stall; the walls are so thin there’s an acoustic play by play of movement. As soon as Sherlock steps under the spray John knows, can hear the way the water hits his body and bounces off. He groans as he feels his prick start to fill out. It’s useless. He’ll never get over wanting Sherlock. The feeling has only grown since he’s gotten to know him tonight, how can he expect to deal with this temptation?
Sherlock was smart enough not to look at John as he blatantly lied about the timeline. John was smart enough not to correct this fallacy. His conscience would take the hit easily, he couldn’t risk them arresting Sherlock. They might be able to chance Mycroft pulling some strings but if it could be avoided altogether, all the better. Avoiding a trial meant avoiding perjury after all.
He looked the kid over again. He didn’t even look old enough to be in Uni in the first place. His soft curls framed his face like Cabanal’s Fallen Angel, his high cheekbones spoke of posh boarding schools and summers in Bath, his lips…
As soon as the train stopped he was off again, racing south toward the bustling club district. It was good Sherlock had the forethought to have bribed the bouncers so generously in the past, as it afforded him the luxury of bypassing the line out front, straight into the club without pause.
“C’mon, don’t be like that, it was just a silly question. What’s my favourite animal then? Go on,” he teased, knowing Sherlock would cheer up at the challenge.
She closed the door behind them and rested against it as if she were exhausted, which she probably was, day she’d had.
Sherlock really wanted John to move in. He’d apparently thrown a fit when he thought John wasn’t coming back, had attempted to wreck the spare room, John’s room, at the very thought. John tried not to read too much into it but… was it really that important to Sherlock?
I’m half naked on your bed. Too busy trying to hide your erection to work out why I’ve forced you to come out here in a towel.”
John growled but it was surprisingly sound advice, considering it came from someone who had been reportedly sex starved all day.  He lunged for the stupid coat and after some fishing, in which he came up with a string of Chinese fire crackers, a tube of women’s lipstick and a grape, he found the condom. It was rolled on with military efficiency. Without warning, he slipped two fingers inside Sherlock to test the remaining elasticity. Sherlock had the frame of mind to jam his coat covered arm onto his mouth to cover the loud groan.
He ran back out for their dinner, most of which was still salvageable. Sherlock’s broccoli had ended up in John’s stir-fry but it wouldn’t take much to figure out. A lone egg roll had lived up to its name and rolled right out into the street but other than that it was all accounted for. He ran the bags back inside, up the stairs despite Sherlock’s cry of indignation, leaving them on the kitchen table then going back for the overgrown man-child.
“What a noble goal,” Mycroft noted, glancing antagonistically at Sherlock. “Do let me know what you decide. I’m sure I can expedite the entry process for you.”
John turned and gave a nod to Mike Stamford, his dorm neighbor, as he approached. He watched as Mike’s smile faded upon seeing John’s murderous face.
A sound, a horrifying, flash-back-to-your-teenage-years-you're-about-to-be-caught-doing-something-embarrassing sound worked its way into John's ear canal and he instinctively threw himself backwards against the door to the sitting room. Sherlock hissed and then looked back in shock.
He pointed at the skull. “That explains why you lured me up here.” When Sherlock raised an eyebrow John answered, “Serial killer.”
John charged with a cry that would have done his Scottish ancestors proud. They went arse over teakettle over the coffee table, scattering books and an ashtray. John clipped Sherlock on the chin once but his wrists were pinned seconds later. One long leg wrapped around his and spun them into the underside of the table; John in turn bucked up, upending the whole thing, and wrenched away with a snarl. He ignored the way his wrists burned after being twisted out of Sherlock’s grip and went back on the offensive, throwing wild punches and hoping for the best. Mostly he just ended up punching Sherlock’s forearms as he blocked but it still felt good to land a few blows.
When John looks over, Sherlock is waiting expectantly, glancing at Greg like he was waiting on something specific.
“The worst,” Sherlock agreed with a roll of his eyes. “Come on up. She’ll never quit until we vacate the foyer.”
“She did! She said, ‘And if you don’t like it, you can lick my hairy twat!’  Left her girlfriend standing there in the hall and just ran out like it wasn’t negative five outside. I had to go get her and drag her back, the crazy bitch.”
She snickers but shifts uncomfortably, probably been teased mercilessly by peers for growing so tall, so fast. Her case had been one of John and Sherlock's earliest ones, so that put her age at closer to sixteen or seventeen, as she'd been a gangly pre-teen then, complete with awkward braces and a mane of wild curls.
.” She accepted her scotch like a Queen, no acknowledgment of how it had come into her hand. It was a wonderful performance.
“Oh, fuck.” John panted when a by-chance perfectly timed thrust hit just right. “I could come just from this, you brilliant, mad, perfect bastard.”
Gregson just shook his head. “I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, son, I really did. I understand you kids are going through a lot at this age.”
Sherlock frowned the whole way to the counter, through giving his name for the order to the wary bloke behind the register and until John nudged him with his shoulder.
Sherlock inclined his head. “True, but I’d never truly do anything to endanger either you or Mrs. Hudson.”
John looked up at the ceiling in confusion.  It became clear that he was still drunk; the ceiling spun to the left and his head tilted with it. Strange because he hadn’t felt so with his new friend- he’d never felt better in fact. But as he blinked over at Mike in the doorway he had to admit he felt sick.
for their continued support throughout this long process. I'd've given up if not for their 'OMG THIS!'s and 'OH NO HE DIDN'T's. You guys are amazeballs. <3
“Mmm, yes, quite.” Mycroft rose gracefully, despite his horrifically top-heavy frame. “I should be off. It was lovely to meet you, John. Do feel free to contact me should you need.”
Greg slapped a hand over both Molly and Mrs. Hudson's ears, virtually smashing their heads together in front of the door. Neither seemed to notice, they were far too busy crying.
John steadied Sherlock with a hand to his chest, his heaving, flushed chest, and pulled back out. It quickly became apparent that holding his lover down was not going to be an option. Not if they didn’t want to break Greg’s lamp in the process. He enraged Sherlock to the point of spitting when he pulled out but when he flipped the swearing git over John received a happy sort of noise.
Sherlock was about to ask if John had lost one of his contacts in the scuffle when he responded with, “You don’t make friends easily, do you?”
The sound of fingernails scraping on leather was horrendous but John certainly wasn't going to stop what he was doing to point it out.
“I mean, we could do charades, but you can barely stand and I’m not exactly full of excitement to jump up and swing myself around the room.”
John grabs his soap and makes a beeline for the loo, eyes dutifully forward until the door closes behind him. He rests against it, eyes closed to the sight of Sherlock casually strutting around in his magnificent glory. Christ, his thighs alone were going to haunt John’s dreams for the rest of his days, to say nothing for the rest of him.
Christ, his heart went into overtime at that and he knew he was blushing like a school girl. There was no way John didn’t see, not under the bright fluorescent lights of the waiting room.
“Yes, well.” John fidgeted for the first time, losing his nerve somewhat, and what a shame that was. “I had some questions.”
“I’ve said it before, John.” She sat next to him on the bed and took his hand. “He’s scared. He doesn’t have the first clue how to do relationships, and I think he’s fighting it like a baby fights sleep.”
Sherlock shook his head and then looked down at John. “No,” he drawled, “that doesn’t make any sense.” He thought back to that night, the way John had looked at him, how obvious the attraction had been right off, the whole reason Sherlock had even entertained the notion of kissing him. He’d felt wanted, but not only that, he’d felt safe. In the right hands, as it were.
“What-” Sherlock’s brow pinched. “What are you on about?” He huffed at the ceiling, trying to find coherence outside of John’s right pointer finger, which was making a nuisance of itself near Sherlock’s erection.
John explained, as apparently it was needed, “Yes. I needed time to think about your offer. It’s not as simple as you think, moving in, but I thought about it and decided you do need a keeper. You’ve proven that theory correct, good on you,” he deadpanned, nodding to Sherlock’s state on the floor.
“Mary? What did she need?” He casually pulls his mobile to check it for missed calls or texts. There are none.
"But it's worth the attitude, isn't it? The outcome I mean. He's going to solve this case in half the time we would have. The bastard."
But then there she was, on time presumably, at nine on the dot. John leaned in for a friendly cheek kiss, Sherlock was loathe to witness, and together they went inside. With that decided, he slammed the laptop shut and stormed from the flat.
“Don‘t be modest, Victor,” Sherlock drawled silkily, singeing John’s nerves with the familiarity, “your etchings are quite lovely.”
“Sherlock…” John hesitated, looking unsure of what, exactly he wanted to ask, but the softness precluded some sort of pity that incensed Sherlock further.
A growl escaped his throat and it shocked him enough to pull back. “Christ, look what you’ve got me doing,” he snapped in shock.
He walked further into the room to find Sherlock on his side beside the bed, staring off at the opposite wall. John didn’t know whether to be frustrated or mildly amused. He’d only been gone an hour and look what had happened.
Sherlock grunts so hard it’s like he’s had the air punched out of him. His eyes go wide and in the next instance John finds he’s being attacked by a tornado with arms. Grasping arms that apparently want him naked, sooner rather than later.
“Sherlock,” Irene purred, shoving a middle aged man out of the chair beside him so she could slide in. The man took one look at her, closed his mouth, and walked away. She hadn’t even taken her coat off yet.
John leans up against a tree with his cup and watches Sherlock as well, though what either man hopes to accomplish by standing around and watching someone else work he hasn't the faintest. It's just what they're used to with Sherlock. Waiting for scraps.
John perked up at this, not obviously, but his heart rate increased, his chest puffed out just a little bit more.
“You boys, I swear. You’re going to put me in an early grave. One of these days I’m just going to keel right over, and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself.”
Sherlock didn’t seem to like that one bit. He crowded right up into her face and snarled something in Arabic. Laila’s answering smile was angelic. It seemed she’d gotten exactly what she’d wanted. John wished her future courtroom opponents all the luck in the world.
When he heard the cap to the slick being opened, he turned his head enough to send John a questioning look.
“I thought we agreed not to go slowly," he growled. John grinned evilly, a fair warning to his frame of mind. “John, did we not just agree?”
“Why…” He had to close his eyes and will himself not to be ill for a moment, before he tried again. “Why are you taking care of me?”
John pulls the cloth curtain back and immediately registers his first mistake. A real whopper of one.
“Oh, thank god,” she braced one hand on the counter, the other over her heart. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, bisexual guys are hot but a hundred and fifty? That, my friend, is ridiculous.”
John stares out into the distance as if he's no longer a part of the universe, let alone the conversation. And to think, he used to like Greg.
“John!” Mrs. Hudson greets him in the foyer, where she apparently lives when the boys aren’t in. “I’m so thrilled you’ve started writing again.”
John frowned up at him in disbelief and, again just because he could, pressed his thumb into the lump. Not hard, just enough to remind Sherlock of the pain.
John moved to in front of the door and leaned in, carefully putting an ear to the wood. All was quiet. His brow wrinkled in confusion as he tried to puzzle out what had happened.
He didn’t want to make promises he couldn’t keep, he had just sworn to put more effort into his studies after all, but he was feeling pretty optimistic after the orgasm, so he answered in the affirmative.
“You’re fine, mate. You’re gonna be fine,” John crooned as they slid inside. He gave the cabbie - Sherlock was sure they were now in a cab - their address and Sherlock was pleased to learn they were heading home together.
“Now hold on,” John snapped. Barring the fact that this kid could see his reluctant interest, “Who the bloody hell is Victor?”
“Yes,” Sherlock vehemently snaps, as if John should know better. John wants to ask if he was stung on the mouth, but he’s already explaining. “I was three, it was in Mummy’s wild flower garden - absurd thing, planting wild flowers and trying to tame them - but I loved it there, I spent hours there as a child. I was studying an Emperor Moth caterpillar-”
With a snort, John reaches over and snags Sherlock’s mobile out of his hands, quickly reading the texts as Sherlock squawks and swipes at him.
John spots Sherlock’s belstaff as they trudge through the trees, following the snapped branches and claw gouges in bark, the remnants of the werewolf’s rampage. His mobile flickers to life with the last of its battery power, his screen full of missed calls and messages. With a sigh, he dials Lestrade and is treated to a loud scolding about going to crime scenes alone, abandoning them, telling him John is sick, and then going radio silent for hours. His hysterics are somewhat understandable, so Sherlock demurs, promises John is alright, and agrees to come in for statements.
Sherlock leans forward, pressing his lips to the unblemished skin of John’s chest. “I stabbed the wolf – you, in the heart.” A warm hand settles on the back of his head. John’s voice vibrates against Sherlock’s skin.
He runs through the facts of the case again, checking for any possible loose ends, but everything seems to be in order. The family was so grateful, they even gave Sherlock an expensive gold watch. A useless gift, and Sherlock told them so, since he primarily uses his mobile to tell the time. The odd occasion he wears a watch it’s a cheap brand that can withstand some rough treatment. He tried to return the watch so that they could give it to someone more appropriate – a grandparent perhaps, or the vain, businessman uncle who had made a nuisance of himself – but the family misunderstood him and became offended and he was forced to keep the watch for the sake of civility. And now the watch is sitting on the coffee table, ready to collect dust since John refused to take it and –
“Like it’s Sunday morning and I can’t remember if I had a bad night or a really good one, but I’m pretty sure I fell down some stairs at one point.”
Finger still snug inside Sherlock, John looked up and delivered a last, delicate lick to Sherlock’s tender, puffy clit, watching Sherlock’s eyelids flutter as an aftershock rippled through her. When she gazed down at John she looked drugged, lips red and parted, face blushing, hair damp with sweat. Sherlock was looking at her like John was the best mystery she had ever seen, like a locked-room murder and a serial killer combined, like she broke her crime rating scale. Biting her lip, John closed her eyes as the heat spiked between her legs, suddenly wondering if it were possible to come untouched.
“I agree about the tracking – that’s not on,” John says. “As for the pill…” he looks up at Sherlock, searching for something in his expression. Sherlock hardly knows what is on his face at the moment. “We don’t need it,” John decides, giving Sherlock’s hand a squeeze.
It was the longest they had been apart since becoming a couple, and she’d had to leave in the middle of a case. She’d warned Sherlock almost a month in advance, but when embroiled in a mystery, John knew that Sherlock tended to ignore or delete anything deemed irrelevant to the crime. It was no surprise that Sherlock forgot about the trip, and John had only felt a little guilty for laughing at Sherlock’s expression when she entered their room to find John packing her bags.
Sherlock pulled back and John reached out to tuck in a stray curl. “I know that look on your face,” John accused as she followed Sherlock to the door. “You’re going to experiment this to death, aren’t you?”
It stares at him with its burning red eyes, but Sherlock does not back down this time. Lowering the violin, he steps up to the bars. He doesn’t try to speak. The creature takes a thudding step closer to him and is stopped by the chains, against which it struggles briefly, futilely. Its head tilts, perhaps curious why Sherlock isn’t running when his heart pounds and he trembles minutely. Perhaps it remembers what Sherlock is capable of and is acknowledging him as a worthy opponent.
He leant against café wall, trying to make sense of what had just happened. He couldn’t even talk to John about it – that just confused things further. He was truly alone, for the first time in years.
“John, dear, why did you think that the waitress in that very classy restaurant needed to know about our financial trouble?”
“I don’t see why not. Nothing to rush home for.” Mycroft gave Lestrade a shy smile and he threw a grin back. Maybe this evening wouldn’t be so lonely after all.
Check the tags; there’s canon-typical drug use mentioned here and throughout the fic. You have been warned!
Eyes meet. Dilated pupils and desperate want reflected in each pair. For the first time, they look at eachother, and see what’s always been there.
Somehow, the 18 year old Sherlock was reminded of this moment as he stood, blood-soaked and lost for words in the doorway of Angelo’s Café. He had succeeded in leaving the schoolhouse, but after that… he didn’t like to think about what had happened that night. But the next day he changed schools and he hadn’t been off guard for a second since. Until now.
Sherlock feels the blood rushing to his cheeks at the noise he’d just heard come from his mouth, and that isn’t the only place blood is heading for. He may be oblivious to some social cues, but this is unmistakable; John Watson is behaving towards him in a… sexual manner. He doesn’t stop after Sherlock’s yelp-gasp-sound. He seems if anything to take it as a signal of encouragement, and he begins exploring Sherlock’s neck with his lips, tongue and teeth. Sherlock fight a very short internal battle between his morals - John is in a relationship and soon to be married - and the secret desire that has burned within him since he first laid eyes on Dr John Watson, 5th Northumberland Fusiliers. He satisfies his morals by accepting that he himself has not yet done anything, has not reciprocated. Right now this was all John, and although he isn’t about to stop him, his conscience can take it as long as he isn’t an … active part of the situation, whatever it is. He tucks his hands under his knees. Keep them out of the way.
“Hm. How to reboot a Sherlock Holmes. Ah. I remember.” An evil grin splashed across his face, John grabs a fistful of curls and pulls. This gives the desired effect. Sherlock yelps and launches himself at John, pinning him to the floor, both of them giggling and squirming. The same position they had been in not an hour ago, and yet so much had changed.
Nice airport is just off the coast, so as you sit on the beach the planes appear to be flying into and out of the sea - it’s pretty cool to watch. Hopefully I’ll get back on track and have the next chapter up by Monday, but who knows… keep an eye on my Tumblr @thejohnlockoutlet for updates, random ficlets and more bullshit from me!
“Ahhh, Sherlock! Do you perhaps need to get cleaned up a little?” Angelo was speaking. It wasn’t important.
Misery has been the background radiation of his life for so long now, he’d almost forgotten it wasn’t how people were supposed to be. His happiness was a lost cause, a childish dream he’d stopped chasing years ago. He tried to be content with contentment, or resigned to his resignation, but he inevitably ended miserable about his misery.
If you are unfamiliar with the English education system, Sherlock is in his last year of school, and A Levels are the exams that determine if/where you get into university. Clearly Sherlock is studying chemistry, but I didn't do A Levels because I'm not smart enough so I know nothing about A Level chemistry so it's kind of vague there, sorry! I'm not sure whether lots of schools had a gate to get out through the back of the field, but I know that some do, and it worked nicely with the plot for it to lead onto the street, so that's how it is.
The taxi pulled up at 221B Baker Street. Surely a far too posh place for John to be able to afford, he thought, disappointed. He was not a well off man, and having to travel so much by cab because of this damned leg was taking its share of his army pension. Anyway, such a dazzling man as Sherlock Holmes would never want to live with someone as boring as John Watson, injured army doctor. He would enjoy it while it lasted, he decided, opening the door of the cab.
Dinner is booked for 8 o’clock at Le Negresco Hotel. John buttons himself into his shirt and puts on a brave face.
“Surprise me!” He says it with a grin that doesn’t reach his eyes. Whatever flavour she choses will be the wrong one and they both know it.
“Yes, I um, don’t believe we’ve ever really met in person. Mycroft.” He puts out his hand and Lestrade shakes it, with a smile.
“It’s dinner, not the end of the world, you idiot. You can have however long you like with me, when we get home.” He took Sherlock’s hand, and pulled.
“I’m not… well, I can find somewhere pretty short notice. Stop over for a few nights with Stamford for the time being, if I need to go that quick. I hope it hasn’t made you too uncomfortable around me, I know this must be difficult for you, and I never meant for this to happen, to feel this way towards you-”
It had been raining earlier in the day, according to how wet the grass was on Sherlock’s leather lace-ups as he navigated past assorted bins, trees and sports equipment left on the field. Not many others used this gate, and Sherlock allowed himself off guard for a few minutes as he walked.
Sherlock knew that, when a child grows up friendless, it is common to invent a companion to abate loneliness.
“Hmm, I don’t mind.” John shrugs, by way of an explanation why his hand was on the knee for so long. “I don’t- oof!” He’d slipped again, losing the support of the knee as he’d gestured to indicate his lack of minding, and landing firmly on his arse. He looked up at Sherlock from the floor and the sight was so pathetic that Sherlock let out a snort, which became a giggle, which became hiccups.
You’d think I engineered this whole thing around the Nice/nice confusion - but actually I only thought of that as I wrote this chapter, having planned the whole thing… I just chose it because I went there on holiday this year, and I read a lot of Johnlock fics out there, so I was imagining John and Sherlock in that place. John’s shitty airport experience was nothing compared to mine though, I have no sympathy for him. We had issues checking our bags, my medication nearly got taken away in airport security - I had to take the whole night’s dose before we went through, we were stuck in a boiling hot corridor with no water for several hours while I was feeling like death from all the medication and there was no where to sit down. I nearly passed out! Then we were stuck on a grounded plane for another hour, which finally took off giving me the worst headache I’ve ever experienced in my life, I thought my skull was cracking open, it was hell. The saving grace was that I’d downloaded my favourite ever fanfic, Dear John by wendymarlowe, to reread. I owe that author my life, I’m sure! I don’t know why I’m writing this annecdote here, but things have kind of got away from me a bit. I’ll wrap it up now. Next chapter expected next Monday, or before!
Please let me know if you spot any errors or typos in this, all my writing is unedited or beta’d because I’m a stubborn bitch who doesn’t like to be told I’m wrong. This chapter was super tricky to write - I’ve wrested with it for hours, it did not come easy. I hope it reads ok! It’s very angsty-John-ful, but I’ve merged it with the next chapter so there’s some lighter stuff at the end! Bear through it!
Yep, I got ya. Sherlock and John haven’t bumped into eachother… yet. Check back soon for the next chapter! And, yes, Sherlock does have John saved as “Captain” in his phone. Of course he does.
to, and not tell me, I should know? We were talking about fucking wine and damn money and you bring that up? Fucking hell.” A cushion falls to the floor and John realises he’s kicking one of the cozy armchairs.
"Erm- Consulting Detective. And I wasn’t really ‘on the case’ – I just happened to bump into a maniac with a knife.”
The realisation hits John suddenly, unexpectedly, as he looks around the crowded beach. He is not enjoying himself. That, in itself, doesn’t surprise him, he’s been very aware of that fact this whole time. But what shocks him is the realisation that he probably- well, he probably should be.
“Posh little fucker!” She swept the knife around randomly, hoping to hit flesh. She was so close, Sherlock could smell the whiskey on her breath. He felt the knife fly through the air towards him before he felt the impact of it – a slice across the face. Blood trickled into his mouth and Sherlock decided it had been long enough for the victim to make a getaway. A swift kick into the darkness caused his attacker to be incapacitated long enough for him to run.
Sherlock eyed him suspiciously. He was visibly thinking things over. “France, yes? Nice?” Lestrade nodded in reply. “Isn’t that… I was sure… Where has John gone?”
“Well, there is something, actually, that I had been meaning too, um. Say. Discuss. Talk over, with you.” Sherlock was intrigued. The unsteadiness in John’s voice was a departure from his usual clipped military manner of speaking - the doctor augmented his language with complex metaphors and unnecessary vocabulary, but usually he knew what he wanted to say and he said it. Today, he was unsure of himself. He was nervous, and that meant one of two things; he was going to say something which made him emotionally vulnerable, or, more likely, it was about something that he thought might upset Sherlock.
He worries for just a second when he realises Sherlock is still relaxed but unmoving under his touch, but as John’s hand pauses on his chest, the hammering heartbeat tells him all he needs to know. Of course, Sherlock does everything his own way.
A passing car illuminated the scene for a split second: a man – husband, presumably – held against the crumbling brick wall, a knife held towards him, and Sherlock, a few steps away. Then the wave of darkness crashed back down.
Later on, they check in to their holiday apartment, exhausted. After staying up a couple of hours lamely trying to stay awake and read, they give in and decide to take an afternoon nap. Mary brings him a cup of tea in bed, and John smiles at her, feeling like finally he had something which resembled a normal life. He and Mary had a nice flat back home, they were married, they were doing well at their jobs - Mary had even been on a couple of business trips abroad recently. This is what John knew people wanted out of life, and that thought reassured him that he was on the right track. Everyone has doubts about big decisions, especially something as big as a marriage. It’s normal.
“He’s upstairs, and he won’t let me in, I’m so glad you’re here.” Mrs Hudson looked at him pleadingly. “You have a case for him?”
“Amateur sleuth, are you? Is that how you got in this mess, on the trail of some crook?” And he smiled. Sherlock didn’t quite know what happened to him when this smile hit him, but it felt comforting and terrifying at the same time and he wanted to both run away and stay with this smile forever.
Things that Sherlock had dreamed one day, impossibly, John may speak to him. He watched from the front pew as John spoke them to Mary, and as the church doors closed behind the couple and confetti flew, he felt the doors finally close on his hope for him and John ever to be anything more than friends.
Mrs Hudson seems so relieved when she sees Lestrade at the door it increases the pit of worry in his stomach. The woman is always in a flap, but beneath that is steely strength that is usually a match for Sherlock’s most severe tantrums. She looks out of her depth today.
An unusual man, an extraordinary man, a man who knew things he shouldn’t’ve been able to - John thought he should have been wary of him, but very little scared him since coming home from Afghanistan. Just one thing left that he fears, really: a normal life. The doctors and therapists who had worked with him after he was injured had said the goal was to return to “normal life”, and yet, the very thought of it… anything would be preferable. Anything.
I’ve been to a LOT of Church of England weddings, I used to be paid to sing at them, so unfortunately I have painful details about the ceremony Sherlock would have watched Mary and John have. The quoted text is said as the rings are exchanged, if anyone was wondering. Also if you want a sad half an hour, look at the rest of the vows and imagine Sherlock listening to this ceremony happening, I did this yesterday for research for this, and now I’m dead inside :)
He grunted in annoyance, and worked his way through the class deducing what they’d had for lunch. He was alone at his table, and he was glad about this as he thought about the breath of the girl who’d had garlic bread an hour ago.
