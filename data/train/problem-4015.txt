Dean has apparently elected to take a penalty on his behalf - Castiel watches from across the locker room.
“They’re autonomous creatures who value their individuality,” Castiel offers by way of an admittedly overly-simplified explanation.
Dean’s eyebrows rise comically high on his forehead and he’s silent for a moment. “Okay. Wow. Can’t say I was expecting that today.”
“That’s irrelevant,” he interrupts gently. “You have my gratitude either way.”
This fic now has eighty five people subscribed to it! (I wonder if I can make it to one hundred? 👀)
“Presumably. I’m not sure when I am right now, I feel disoriented.”
The march to Raphael’s office is long. Gabriel’s wings continue to give away his emotional state, while Prior-Castiel’s are folded tidily in a display of forced calm; he’s obviously nervous about this. Castiel can feel his own wings spasming with pain behind his back. It’s fortunate that the flow of time will cause him to disappear before the Angel Tablet’s energy can destroy him instead, because that would be significantly more horrible.
He groans. “Alright. What the hell was he bitching us out for?”
“Dean, this is my brother.”
“Shut up, Cas, I told you I wasn’t comfortable with this!”
Sammy stomps out of the kitchen like a toddler having a fit. Which isn’t even a fair comparison, because Jack is a toddler but he doesn’t throw fits. Dean snorts and goes back to his beer, definitely not feeling the equivalent of Cas doing an impatient foot-tapping in back of his brain. Nope. Nothing there. Cas is totally fine.
a prank. But I’ve played too many jokes on him and he’s not gonna believe me.”
“Because it’s… just not.”
“Why?”
Jack nods. “Okay.”
but… you know what I fucking mean!”
Dean stares at the wing. He didn’t even notice before how Future-Cas’ had been unhealthy or something, because these feathers are much fuller and neatly lined up, no tufts or clumps and very shiny. But that’s still not great. Dean’s massively not okay with what’s being suggested to him right now, yeah he’s pissed but just the idea of hurting Cas on purpose is so awful that he knows he’d never even
“Gabriel, at a certain point it should occur to you that I’m not here to broker a relationship between you and Sam,” he points out flatly. “It’s neither my business nor my problem. So no ‘test screenings’ of whatever it is you plan to say to him on his return, no harassing me while Dean is helping me care for my wings, and especially no more interruptions to my research. It’s ‘growing on my nerves,’ as the humans say.”
Cas turns out to be right. So from that point until everyone starts grouping up waiting for dinner, Dean describes some of the most random-ass shit he’s ever heard of out of this book, which gets Jack to giggle every so often alongside Cas’ running commentary on the curses themselves. And it’s so weirdly normal that Dean forgets how weird normal actually is for him, or the fact that he should even find normal to be weird at all.
“Yeah. I uh. I came to see you. It was Cas’ idea.” He trips over himself explaining.
The feather will disappear, just like Cas will.
“You scream in your sleep.”
Cas knows several things about Dean now: he likes pie, he writes a lot in the notebook, he hates nurses and doctors. And his sleep is constantly disturbed. Cas has been woken more than once already by his roommate’s night terrors, thrashing and screaming on the other side of the divider curtain.
Mary sighs heavily. “What about Gabriel?”
“And your solution was
Fingertips lightly prod his face. It draws his attention back to his broken nose and moisture gathers at the corners of his closed eyes. Why is Lucifer touching his face. What does this mean.
“He’s sleeping right now, is it important?”
They’re both already in their spandex base layers underneath track pants and sweatshirts so shedding their outer clothes is all they have to do before putting on all the pads (mostly because Dean figured it would be way less inappropriate). It takes him all of seven minutes to be almost fully dressed for a practice, by which point he has to help tie Jack’s skates and also realize that his right glove is
Sam does indeed arrive after lunch, if a few minutes later than expected due to the poor weather conditions.
“How can I
“Hm. No shit.” Dean flips it shut and tosses it aside. “Cas, how many weeks has it been since you heard the thing on Angel Radio?”
“You wanna run all that by me again, Cas?”
Maybe Gabriel should say something, but he has no idea what the right thing even is. Instead he staggers over and hugs his nephew, because at least that’s something he knows how to do. And Jack hugs back. So maybe that was the right thing anyway.
Castiel harbors some amount of disappointment in her for looking relieved when he says that Dean’s feelings for him are platonic and familial in nature. He’s aware of the views that were common when she died, but that doesn’t make it less irritating. Dean is her son, she should love him however he is. It leaves him to wonder how she would’ve reacted supposing he’d said Dean was in love with him.
“Yes,” Cas answers slowly. “Although they don’t seem to be having an effect. I see him receiving them each morning but there’s been no changes to speak of in regards to his behavior.”
The 2nd comes and they come back to the ice. Dean sits beside Castiel on the bench and they observe together, Dean muttering about some suggestions he could make to line change-ups during practice and Castiel pointing out minor things that should possibly be worked on by individual players. It feels like competent strategizing between the two of them, a C and an A clicking and working in sync like they should.
Dean drags his angel into his arms, kinda cradling, and it feels so good to hold Cas at all. Dean pats his hair and the side of his face, waiting for him to wake up and also for Jack to pull them both out.
Bobby glowers. “Tell me you ain’t dead already, you damn idjit!”
“You’re a fucking cheeseball, Cas.”
“This is my twelfth.”
uh, family like… the person you. Get married to,” Dean chokes out. Cas just stares at him in silence. “Oh c’mon, Cas! I don’t know how to be any blunter this time!”
And then Dean’s eyes open, and he’s back in the damn hospital room. He reaches over and shakes Cas’ shoulder.
“So prove it.” Dean’s arms cross. “You don’t got a halo or wings or anything.”
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
“‘Feathers’?” Dean asks.
“Yes, you can, but you don’t have to. Your reasoning is perfectly clear to me.” Death eyes him with a mildly critical expression. “The fact remains that you’re disrupting the order of things and causing problems.” A door off to the side opens. “Come with me.”
“Cas?”
you’re a dumbass, that’s something you said once.”
Castiel watches his own head drop and finally, now, he moves. “Hello, Castiel. I am your sign from God.” It’s not true and he knows it, but he must get this message across.
“THE GIRL WILL BE M-A-U-R-A L-I-L-L-I-A-N” she spells out. It makes sense, the name of her biological mother and of her foster mother. Dean didn’t expect anything less. “AND THE BOY IS R-O-B-E-R-T H-E-N-R-Y”
“Cas?” Why does this somehow feel like the Empty all over again. “C’mon, man, why do we always gotta do shit the hard way?”
“I started wishing I was her real dad the first time I held her.”
“It was Sam’s idea… Dean and Uncle Gabe made fun of me, but I liked them.”
Not such a smart move on his part. The blade tip buries itself in the floor and there’s a hand on his wing, a booted foot pinning him by his back, then the second boot slams down to shatter that wing and leave him screaming and crippled from the agony. He rips his fractured wing away, losing about a dozen feathers in doing so, and yanks his weapon out of the floor to stab Lucifer through the hip joint.
for it instead of me. You’ve caused trouble since your very first day in an Islanders’ jersey, so you’d be the one suspected of masterminding the entire thing. I’ll escape unscathed.”
Cas grumps.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re welcome,” Castiel answers flatly.
“Yeah, I know you didn’t. It’s alright. Many people don’t believe in angels and humans have free will.” Castiel sighs through his nose. This is not a topic of discussion he’s comfortable breaching with a child. “The short answer is yes, I was assigned to you.”
Castiel supposes it could be much worse. He’d never expected to have any after all.
stop getting weirder than it already is?”
“In my defense I was like, halfway to becoming a demon already when you snatched my ass outta the hot-box.”
Assistant captains aren’t usually the face of the team but somehow he’d ended up being that exact thing anyway. He wasn’t officially in charge of anything when he was “just” an A, and for awhile there he really wanted to change his last name, make it Campbell since his parents have been divorced for fifteen years now, and then he could just be any other assistant captain without all the branding and baggage and unreachable expectations to go along with it.
“So your brother threw me some cash, we’re gonna hit up a grocery store on the way so you can get some food for yourself,” Dean informs him as they wander through the hallway in search of the elevators.
“This is uh. A lace from a combat boot.” Dean fidgets with his pencil.
Cas, don’t be like that, it was a fucking joke,” Dean groans.
Dean’s face instantly contorts into some expression that even other humans would likely find dumbfounding. She flicks through the knowledge she extracted from Castiel and makes a determination - intense grief, masquerading as rage.
Sam and Bobby go outside, probably to keep talking without him being able to eavesdrop. Dean doesn’t care. Cas has been warned, they won’t get anywhere. Demons can be involuntarily summoned, but angels can choose to ignore a summons if they want to, so if Cas checks and finds out it’s Bobby or Sam trying to get him to show up, he’ll know not to.
When they’re back out on the ice again, it’s the first line and second D-pair that get sent out to start. Dean ends up between Benny and Kevin on the bench, and they all stand for the national anthems - the Canadian one comes first because they’re hosting the Habs for this match, then the American one. Dean’s heard them so many times by now that he could sing either of them without needing to look up the words.
Castiel resigns himself to the fact that this is inevitable. It doesn’t mean he needs to be happy about it.
Dean explains all of that to Jack when they stop for a quick breather and some Gatorade. He couldn’t stand it when he was learning to play and nobody ever told him “why,” just to go do this-and-such thing. Jack is a sponge, soaking in every last word coming outta Dean’s mouth. He’s a bright kid, Cas is probably really proud of him for everything all the time.
Dean rolls onto his back and tucks his bleeding hand to his chest, already figuring out that there’s some shards in there that’ll have to get plucked free with tweezers. He has to stop and think, now. It’s not super clear, but it’s coming to him slowly, how Cas fucking threw his dad across the room and then healed him. Except that wasn’t right away, apparently, because Dean first tried to blow Cas away with a shotgun.
“He wanted me to call and check in once I got outta my therapy appointment.”
Corbett, the rookie, snags a pass and breaks formation from the others, almost making it to the blue line and then flinging the puck up the ice to clear it and force the Habs out of the attacking zone. The Habs goalie moves out a few feet to whack it back towards the red line and it sails through the air to slam Spangler in the chest, who kicks it with his skate blade so he can grab it with his stick and carries it into the attacking zone. Dean’s almost holding his breath for a shorthanded attempt, but it doesn’t happen because before Spangler can do anything a Hab rams into him and the refs blow the play dead.
“Cas, I can’t - without you. Not anymore.” He takes a bite so that he can stall for time even though he’s completely lost any desire to eat. “Even after the leviathans, back then, I couldn’t really cope. It’s just never good news for me whenever something happens to you. Okay? So you - man, you can’t keep fucking throwing yourself away like this. I need you. And I can’t go through this again. It kinda eats me alive every time.”
“Yeah.”
“Okay, so according to Cas if I was an angel I’d be a seraph,” Sam comments, very randomly. He taps the outside of the bowl and then mutters to it in Enochian, a phrase that loosely translates to something along the lines of “taking the mundane to make it divine, and represent the soaring of celestials”. The bowl flares briefly in pale blue, then Sam reaches inside and pulls out a feather - it’s iridescent, a spectrum of colors, and is somehow indistinguishable from an actual seraph feather. “It took me a little while to figure out how to make this work, and Rowena made fun of me the whole time I was talking to her about it, but…”
Sam or Dean or me, make sure you know what the end result will be and if possible read the entire spell for yourself first. Otherwise you may be tricked by an egotistical dickbag like the Scribe of God.”
“Cas,” Dean whispers, lying facedown on the couch. His head really fucking hurts and he’s still kinda drunk, so maybe this ain’t a great idea, but he needs answers. Like right now. “Uh. I mean. Future-Cas. Guess I gotta specify. Listen, man, I-I gotta talk to you, okay? I get that you’re busy with whatever, but just. Five minutes. Okay? There’s some things I gotta ask you about before I go crazy. I.” He swallows. “I promise I won’t get mad.”
The door crashes open. Fingers are digging into the meat of his neck in exactly the perfect spot to hurt as much as possible. Cas can’t help a howl of pain, which is cut off as he’s hauled down and slammed face-first into the hardwood floor. His teeth mash against the inside of his cheek.
“Yes,” he insists. “If I just stopped and thought about it for two fucking seconds, I prob’ly could’a figured out that going after Billie wasn’t gonna do anything. Everything that happened that day was my fault, and I couldn’t fix it. And after it was all over and we got Chuck outta the picture, Jack took off for awhile ’cause he said he needed to take care of some shit, and… Cas, I couldn’t. I couldn’t tell him. So he didn’t even know why you were gone. I couldn’t even tell Sam. I didn’t wanna ruin everything for him, he got Eileen back and they… I fuck everything up, Cas. I break everything. I couldn’t do that to him. It ain’t like I’m great at talking about shit like this anyway but I didn’t even have the option to if I wanted, I was just stuck with this - this huge
“Yes.”
They pull apart just for a second so Dean can have some air, then press together again. Cas seems to be figuring it out a little bit this time. Dean whimpers quietly but that’s mostly because of the crying, because he’s a girl apparently and is crying his way through a kiss with this guy-shaped-angel that he has a thing for.
“I thought you hate touching people.”
“Who are you? How’d you get in here?”
“Cas, man, your fucking guilt complex is outta control,” Dean calls out, knowing how much of a god damn hypocrite he is by saying that. “Don’t you have anything
Sam signs excitedly. Then he slumps again and goes back to looking worried.
“It did when I was sent here, I’m sure the battery has lost its charge by now. And the muffler is loose, but that’s not of import.”
“I’m getting my medication,” he yells at his brother, immediately turning and leaving the room.
“You and Benny as a defensive pair seem to work well with specific forward lines, is that by design?”
1. Depictions of separation anxiety.
Jack scurries away happily and Gabriel gets back to the task at hand before Castiel and Naomi can try to kill each other or something. “So! Y’know that stupid throne room Dad has where he used to listen to prayers and plan smitings and stuff? It’s big enough that once we’ve got the first batch of angels we can orient them or whatever in there. Cas, follow me.”
“Dude, you
“You’re getting twitchy, you awake?” Dean rumbles into the back of his neck.
“If you keep interrupting while I’m helping my client, I’m going to drag you to silent independent art films from Europe every weekend from the time you get discharged to the day you die.”
For a second Dean thinks he might cry.
“Don’t take this the wrong way, Cas, but it’s kinda nice knowing I ain’t the only one here who’s got a family situation that’s totally fucked.”
No, that’s wrong. All of this is wrong and Dean can’t put his finger on why. He shakes his head a little. “Okay. Alright. Y’know what, I get it. You’ve got ‘faith.’ That’s - hey, good for you.” He means it, too. There’s moments sometimes when he gets kinda jealous of people who can hope enough to believe in something like that. He sits down again. “I’m sure it makes things easier. I’ll tell you who else had faith like that: Mom. She used to tell me when she tucked me in that angels were watching over us. In fact, it’s the last thing she ever said to me.”
Dean grumbles, rolls over, rubs his face. Cas watches him and wonders if this is what it means to feel
Gabriel says.
“Humans confuse me!”
Due to my clumsy dumbassery, there will not be an update on Friday because obvs this was supposed to be that update. Next week we will return to the regular posting schedule.
“That’s okay, I’ve actually been standing right next to her all week. She’s adorable and watching her puke on Dean-o a few days ago was pretty gratifying.”
not what Dean wanted to hear. “We’ve got Cas and Future-Cas, now. Cas is trying to open Purgatory, apparently, for whatever good that’ll do him. Future-Cas wants to stop him and will probably go to whatever lengths necessary to do it. They’re both massively dangerous to pretty much everything in existence by that logic, so we need to put an end to this whole mess one way or the other.”
Hands. Big, callused palms rest on Cas’ forearms, anchoring him gently to the table. Dean’s eyes are very green, and Cas uses this fact as his focal point, dragging himself back to the land of relative stability. He carefully and silently makes an assessment to determine what went wrong and decides that, in fact, Dean did not scare him on purpose. There was a misunderstanding here, a communication breakdown.
“One, it’s backwards again, even though I told you however many times now to learn to do it right, and B it’s the same one you’ve worn for our last eight games. Don’t you have any other ties?”
would name their kid Lucifer, so since that would be too stupid in a fic where I'm shooting for realism 99% of the time, I went with the name of his vessel instead. (For the record, finding out his last name is Vaught was SO HARD. It's never said in the show and only briefly appears on Nick's hospital bracelet in s14 according to the wiki.)
“The child and its parents are killed,” Castiel informs him flatly. “It’s necessary to prevent an extreme level of danger to a large number of people.”
That gets Dean to stop for a second. He starts pacing a little next to the rounded metal wall, arms folded over his chest.
“Don’t ask stupid questions!” he snaps, raising his head just enough to properly shout at her before dropping his face back onto his knees.
“Now we talk,” Castiel insists, glancing between the other three. “There needs to be a discussion.”
“You even know what you did wrong, here?”
“Okay. What is it.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Between you and Meg, his teeth will be nothing but holes by his next birthday.”
“Morning, Cas. You look like you feel better.”
have all morning to spend making up your own damn spell just to get back at the guy?”
Cas promises.
“Aren’t you supposed to eat lunch?” he asks.
Cas isn’t in the bunker. Figures. But maybe that’s better. Dean’s lucid at the moment, in a way he hasn’t been in weeks. So he goes for his phone. Cas can’t hurt him through the phone.
Between warm-ups and the start of the 1st, Castiel half-listens to John’s usual barrage of insults and demoralizing statements with the fact that he secretly has a small electronic… something hidden inside his helmet at the forefront of his mind. It’s recording everything it hears and remotely sending the data to Anna’s computer all the way back in New York, which will ultimately be transcribed and used as fodder for her article exposing the casual abuse of players by the Islanders’ head coach. There’s one tucked inside Crowley’s helmet as well, just in case one of the devices malfunctions or isn’t present to pick up whichever pieces of damning evidence are happening at the time.
Dean nods and takes a breath, then heads up the hall, glancing at the nameplates on the doors as they pass by. Why the fuck are there so many Robert Singers. He’s really starting to get the idea that Heaven is designed exactly the right way to inconvenience him as much as fucking possible.
Then a smite-blast flashes from somewhere. A hand wraps around his arm. Gabriel gets them out of Hell, and then they’re both useless, lying sprawled next to each other on a grassy mound.
“2013. I believed I would be putting Dean in less danger by being away from him, and in a sense I managed to accomplish that. Naomi and her subordinates have been hunting me through time but never managed to come close. Although… I’m concerned I may have attracted the attention of something or someone else. At times, I’ve sensed a very powerful presence searching for me. I don’t think it’s God or an archangel, but it’s up there in scale.”
“Yes, an absence of back pain is desirable,” Cas agrees.
He can totally do this, especially without his dad here to beat him senseless for it (again).
“YOU DUMBASS” Dean signs, given they’re not wearing their armored gloves at the moment. “WHY DID YOU BREAK HIS NOSE?”
Hey, guys, um... I can't really talk about the reason why, but I'm about to lose my access to AO3 and Tumblr for awhile and so updates are probably going to stop for a little bit. Know that it's not by choice and I'm really sorry about this, I know there's a lot of you who like this fic and I don't want to let you all down because you've been such a great audience. Hopefully this won't last for more than a few weeks or so. I love you guys, I hope this isn't too disappointing.
“Cas?”
Dean starts walking.
“Okay. And while you were busy stalking me like the superfan of a Hollywood A-lister, you still never figured out you should’a just asked me for help? Y’know what was going on that morning, Cas? I was so fucking hungover it took me like four hours after I woke up to even stand upright. I slept on the couch the night before for putting my fist through the bathroom mirror. Okay, I was never-” Dean chokes on his own words for a second and has to force them out. “I was never happy there. I wasn’t okay. And I would’a taken any excuse to get out, I just never came up with one good enough until Sammy showed up again. You could’a got me outta there but you didn’t.”
Dean’s mind is made up. Castiel understands that the brothers are now dead set on this ridiculous task and they’ll be undertaking the case with or without his help. Dean stares at him in silence and he frowns back for a long moment until Sam interrupts their silent argument.
“You prob’ly just tell the nurses not to let them in.” Dean pulls the thin hospital blankets slightly higher up, tucking the corner around him. “I’m prob’ly not gonna sleep, but you can if you want. I won’t make you go anywhere.”
“Nah, my best-friend-slash-unofficial-sister,” he laughs. “I’ve known her forever, we bonded over not being straight in high school.”
It’s bizarrely gentle, the way he asks that. Dean’s kinda surprised - usually Cas is a lot blunter than this. Apparently he suddenly grew some tact sometime in the last two days.
And this gets him a whole forty five minutes of deliberately frustrating an overgrown toddler. Jack’s going to need a lot of training, which is kind of a problem since there’s no way to know how long it’ll be before Lucifer finds his way back from apocalypse-world hell bent on vengeance. By the end of it Jack looks like he’s two seconds away from a tantrum and Gabriel’s decided that it’s really not fun to pick on a baby like this, there’s no challenge or reward. It’s not like he’s been deliberately screwing with Jack or anything, but still.
Dean, somehow, snickers at him. “Sure you will, matchstick.”
“Not really. I ain’t had such a good appetite lately,” he admits. It comes to him that they should seriously get on with the discussion that they obviously need to have, and plus maybe if they do have that discussion Cas won’t vanish on him… at least not anytime soon. “Wanna go out for breakfast?”
“Your new boss.”
He skids to a stop beside Victor. “Forty two.” He points. “He doesn’t pay enough attention to his flanks, the D-men will try to squeeze him into the boards.”
“’Cause I don’t wanna.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, but I can’t help you right now and you’re going to make me late. I’ll call you back after my appointment,” Cas promises, then hangs up so he can stuff his phone into the pocket of his jeans before zipping and buttoning them.
“You don’t like to take your medications,” he observes.
“Nope. Not enough angels, and even if there were they’d only be able to hold him back for awhile.” Dean snorts, suddenly. “And this is a rite of passage for you, actually.”
“Shut up!” all three of them shout at him.
His fractured wing throbs distractingly and the pain radiates from the break all the way through his shoulder and down his arm. Like always whenever something really awful happens to him, Gabriel is
“Yeah, Sam’s got her. What about the dad?”
The game resumes. Castiel, Crowley and Kevin take the ice, along with Benny and
“The first thing I knew you as. My righteous man.”
, but this is a ploy to get the Star in his personal space to chase after it. The bait is taken and
“Naomi.” His little brother all but spits the name.
“I’m. Sorry, what?”
“Got it in one, Clarence.”
“But why? Why does it have to be so hard?”
They watch the movie for some time in silence - or rather, Dean does. Castiel isn’t invested in it at all, instead using this time to process the events of the past few hours and attempting to subtly calm Dean down by being as relaxed as possible against the couch. It works to a minor degree, but “calm” is not and will never be Dean’s default state of being.
Gabe grabs him by the shoulder and Dean tries to brace himself, but whether it’s an aluminum deathtrap or some assbag angel he fucking hates flying in all its nerve-wracking forms. They “land” in front of some factory that fell victim to the rust belt forty years ago and he almost falls sideways before he gets his bearings back.
He does his best to follow Dean’s instructions. “How do I stop my family members from visiting?”
“Alright, alright.” Gabriel waves his hands at both of them before fixing his eyes on Naomi. “First of all, no more angel lobotomies. It just doesn’t seem to go well for anybody. Dad’s not around anymore, Mikey’s still boxed and never coming out, so you’re stuck with me. And if we’re gonna be making new angels to keep this place going, they need to be more like him.”
“What?”
It becomes clear in the following minutes that the Oilers are very shaken by the injury to their comrade. The Islanders are too easily able to pick holes in their defense, to wall off their offense, and before even the ten minute mark in the 1st Max has scored for them a second time. Privately, Castiel understands why this is happening, and almost manages a slight sense of pity for Edmonton. Last season during the playoffs Michael took such a bad hit that he ended up with four fractured ribs and needed to be carried off the ice, and when that happened the Rangers irreparably collapsed in on themselves.
“Jack, you know how when we were in apocalypse-world and every single person-slash-celestial-being was wigging out about you talking to Lucifer?”
“My brother Michael tied my ties for me when I was a child… but he tended to tie them too tight until they choked me, so eventually I learned to mimic how he did it. I never figured out how to get the large end to face the right direction,” he admits as Dean is fiddling with his own necktie for a few seconds.
Gabriel closes his eyes and tunes himself to the vibrations of the world, feeling for any giant-ass disruptions or surges of celestial energy. In the immediate area: Sam calling some sheriff way over in South Dakota to put out an APB, refugees bustling and getting in each other’s way, Dean bitching out Castiel over the excessive wing oil soaking through his old ratty flannel. Further out, tiny dots of the few celestial creatures still alive: a minute handful of cupids dutifully carrying out their tasks, one angel pretending to be a faith healer and accepting money in exchange, another angel guarding the Sandbox. No signs indicating Lucifer’s return.
“You certainly made an interesting choice in vessels.”
“Cas!” Dean yelps, bolting over and gathering him up from the floor. “Cas. Okay. How ’bout you lay down, okay?”
“You don’t have to thank me, Sam. I’m happy to do it even if you weren’t in the process of forcibly extricating Raphael from my life. It baffles me that being the youngest of six children only two of my siblings are worth speaking to.”
in his right wrist as pain shoots through his hand and up into his arm all the way to the elbow. But he’s the captain, they’re in the middle of play, he has to keep going even though he knows he just fucking broke a bone somewhere. Pain doesn’t matter. Winning this match does.
that always makes Cas afraid of what he’s about to do.
“One of each, they’re having twins. Maura and Bobby.”
“Hello, Jack. Were you good for Aunt Meg?”
It turns out to be a mistake anyway. Dean puts on a brave face, like he’s not incredibly fucking jealous that Cas gets to have a family. Especially because Jack is such a sweet kid. Dean eats a heap of sandwiches and doesn’t say that he wishes he could have this for himself. It reminds him of when he was nine or ten, there was stuff on the news about AIDS and gay rights and when he asked his mom what was going on she gave him this glossed-over explanation about how gay people didn’t have the same rights as everyone else. Then later when he was twelve, the first time he had a crush on another boy, he remembered what was on tv and what his mom said.
“You okay, kid?” Dean asks.
He wakes up and has breakfast like always, but after that the routine is abandoned. He gets dressed in his own clothes instead of pajamas - jeans, t-shirt, sweatshirt, shoes but no socks because socks are his nemesis. He doesn’t put on the light autumn jacket that he was admitted to the first hospital with, instead electing to tug one of Dean’s flannels over top of his sweatshirt. He has discharge paperwork and stacks upon stacks of bee doodles, plus the rest of the flannels and his weight blanket. All of these are piled into a reusable grocery bag. His cell phone and wallet and keys are all returned to him.
“Who wants to share first?” the therapist asks.
“Because it defeats the purpose of the exercise. Are you new? I haven’t seen you before.”
And, okay, Dean can feel Cas’ eyes rolling, too, even though he doesn’t actually have eyes right now.
“Dean, I would like to stay with you indefinitely…”
“Not yet, no. But he will eventually. I understand that you’re sick. I can heal you.”
he hopes it’s as simple as just picturing where he wants to be and then he’s there. So Dean closes his eyes like that makes any difference in this endless fucking dark and imagines his angel.
“I always call him during the first intermission,” Castiel says like it’s just a fact that Dean should already know.
“How old is he?”
“You’re not my fucking therapist, don’t tell me that should be good enough because it ain’t. Trust me.”
“I’m not! Are you missing any limbs? Did you at any point die? No! You’re
“Nothin’ in the fridge, and the cupboards are all that healthy shit Sammy eats.”
“I can’t help but notice that you still haven’t unlearned your spinelessness in the locker room,” Crowley snarks. “You do understand, of course, that you’re the

Dean would like to pretend to be angry but is unable to even do that much. Castiel can’t bear the idea that Dean will cease to pray to him, but as it turns out, this isn’t permanent. Dean’s voice comes to him again, and again after that. Always making an attempt to stop, citing how useless it is. But Dean still prays to him, still cries over him. And Castiel is becoming exactly as broken as Dean is.
“Dean.” He glances at Mom but doesn’t hold eye contact. “The man who wrote that journal wasn’t the man that I married. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
Cas’ shoulder twinges with discomfort, so he lowers his arm again and watches the ceiling. He could get out of bed and watch tv while he waits for Dean to wake up, but he’d rather lie here instead. His mind wanders - to wonder what Dean writes in that journal every night, to consider what Gabriel will say upon learning that Cas plans to stay here indefinitely instead (probably an unfunny joke), and ultimately to imagine an improbable world where neither he nor Dean have nightmares anymore and they snuggle up together in their sleep again because his injuries have healed and Dean kisses him awake in the morning…
“Okay. Okay. We’re gonna be free in a minute, and then you’re gonna wake up, right?” Dean hugs Cas closer to his chest and his wings wrap around both of them, totally by accident. “Dammit, Jack, get us the hell outta this place!”
“Jesse Turner set the bathroom on fire and we got sent home!”
Objectively, it’s kind of an awful kiss. Cas clearly has no fucking idea what he’s doing and yeah actually Dean
“Sammy, check this out, she’s already named Mary,” Dean grins.
Jack puts down the Gatorade and runs around asking everyone he sees for a marker, which ends with Castiel finding one on his behalf. Jack is very proud of himself for being able to write his own name, so naturally he wants to sign Dean’s cast like all the Isles did.
“Because he thinks it’s his job to take care of everybody and you’re… disadvantaged. Your situation isn’t ideal. And I’m sure this won’t come as a shock, but my brother is really messed up. He hates himself so much that all he can do right now is think about trying to help you because the idea of trying to accept help for himself is either unthinkable or unbearable. Just be careful, okay? He’s fragile, that’s why he’s in there with you in the first place.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel is baffled. “I don’t know what to say.”
“I’m only fourteen billion years old, cut me some slack! I’m still young at heart,” Gabriel smirks.
“Thank you.”
Victor Henriksen is their first line center, a veteran with another long-time Isle and a younger feistier player on his wings: Lee Webb and Cole Trenton, respectively. Dean butts heads with Victor and Cole every so often, but Lee’s a friend, and even ignoring that stuff the three of them together are a deadly defensive-forward line. It’s a major part of their identity as a team to be strong at defense, they aren’t bulldozers like the Lightning or the Bruins because they’re a cinder block wall instead.
They hang up and Charlie is giving him a Look.
“I think it’s close, yes. I may ha-”
“Quit riding the brakes,” Dean complains from the passenger seat. He hates letting Sammy drive his car for this reason.
“I don’t know, just stop tryna get me to go after Cas. I don’t fuck around with teammates, it’s unprofessional and shit.”
“If I still practiced the religion that was force-fed to me as a child, I would be actively praying for you to receive a catastrophic injury during tonight’s game,” Castiel growls, quietly enough that only the recipient of the comment can hear him.
like that an angel, if one showed up, wouldn’t just exude an aura of peace or whatever. Angels might even be vicious. And where the fuck is this all coming from? Every hunter knows angels aren’t real, nobody’s ever seen one in the hundreds of years since lore started to be documented…
“Yes.”
“I need more ativan,” Cas demands at the counter of the nurses’ station.
And Dean wakes up. His face is shoved into the couch cushion with the pillow over his head like someone tried to smother him and there’s already a crick in his neck even though when he presses the button to make his watch face glow it’s 2:33 AM - he’s only been out for a couple hours. Somehow, it takes until now for him to notice that his left hand is clenched around something. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he opens his fingers and a feather falls out.
He clearly doesn’t find it comforting at all but there’s really no point in calling him out on it, so Gabriel doesn’t. Instead he rolls his shoulders several times before removing his jacket and shirt in preparation. Sam is on the last two bites or so and stops chewing in order to stare as he gradually unfurls his wings. There isn’t space to fully open them in this room, but keeping them more or less folded behind his back isn’t an issue for the time being. He sits on the floor in front of Sam’s feet and waits patiently.
“Don’t ever do that again, Dean,” Cas begs. “You scared me.”
Maybe this is God’s will…”
“Gabe, I just got up-”
there must be someone else here,” calls his brother’s voice. “Because Gabriel has no reason to own two pickup trucks or several pairs of shoes in different sizes…”
Gabriel grabs Castiel by the shoulder and they imperceptibly materialize in the back seats of the Impala, much to his steadily mounting annoyance.
Despite his lingering gloominess, Cas can’t help a tiny smile that bubbles up. “Thank you.” These are all his favorites; trust his brother to come through on the little things.
and they don’t wanna work with me because-”
John sends the second line and the third D-pair out to take the faceoff at center ice, and when play starts again the announcement comes over the stadium speakers:
“Which farm is the vamp nest in?” Mary asks around a bite of her sandwich.
“So! Did I do better this time?” Gabriel demands, still smiling.
“I will now get up and change my clothes. You will also change your clothes. And then I’ll force-feed you your breakfast.”
“I hope they can fix your nightmares here.”
“Regardless, that was still inappropriate and an invasion of their privacy. Please don’t force me to do it again,” Castiel demands before standing up from his chair and leaving.
Besides, he loves her, he’ll be thrilled. Well. Maybe not
Dean’s been dead several times, but he only remembers being in Heaven once before, and not the institutional section where angels run everything behind the scenes like the part he was just in. This is a lot different from his Heaven that time that Zacharia was chasing his ass all over the place - it’s still calm and peaceful and all that shit, but these aren’t his memories, so it’s unfamiliar… even though he’s here, too. The little kid version of him, playing catch with Bobby when his dad actually wanted Bobby to do rifle training with him.
thing.
Castiel can’t help but feel overwhelmed with joy at this.
“Well, that might be a question for him, right?”
“But won’t you be less sad if you cry?”
“Hello Dean.” Castiel rests a palm on his shoulder and Dean rapidly spins to face him. “I promise, I
“Yes, I’m aware. Hello, Dean. I’m your new left wing.”
Gabriel whips out an angel blade and stuffs it into Jack’s palm. “Go practice stabbing things for a few minutes, kid.”
“I’mma bring you some when I can come see you up there.”
Cas looks down and plays with it. Dean hopes that whoever decided NHL players need to wear suits when travelling for games as well as for home matches died a slow, horrible death, because clearly that person never had to go to Texas in a button shirt and a necktie.
Dean rolls his eyes. “You wanna elaborate there, buddy? I don’t know a fucking thing about how your wings work.”
“Yes, Dean.”
“Yeah, hopefully.”
Emerging into the bunker’s infirmary again, he’s already piling everything up on the empty bed when he realizes Sam’s in here putting stuff into a bowl.
get healed. Enough’a the mixed fucking signals already, okay?! What the
“Hey, I’m gonna go grab some food. Will you be okay for a few minutes?”
“We’ve been taking bets on you, brother,” Lee adds, also starting to grin. “The pool’s up to like five grand now, which I’m pretty sure Garth and Tim just won… they’re the ones got closest to this, right?”
The following exercise is simpler in appearance, but in reality significantly more difficult: write down the names of five people who care about him. Cas is stumped for a moment because he’s not sure there are five… possibly three, tops. He scrounges his brain and begins listing.
“Great. Get the fuck outta here, lady. I wasn’t even bothering you guys or nothin’, there’s no reason angels should be flying down to hassle me. I got bigger shit to deal with.”
“I’m fine,” Castiel says, somehow pulling them both back onto their skates. He hands over Dean’s stick. “Are you alright?”
“Hey, whatever you want, pal, it’s your birthday. How do you take your burgers?”
Dean doesn’t even notice, though, because this is all instinct to him. Dean moves back a little further, skating diagonally, drawing the eyes of the Habs to himself before whipping it back to the blue line where Kevin’s waiting. The rookie winger catches it and takes off, zipping and darting around players twice his size to eventually wrap around the back of the net. He passes it before it can get stolen from him; Benny’s there to receive it and immediately send it to the other side of the offensive zone.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Dean, I’m led to believe that one of the innumerable reasons your childhood and upbringing were so difficult was systematic homophobia from society at large and especially your father.”
“I don’t know,” Sam shrugs. “I have no control over that.” He unfolds his hands and sits back somewhat in the chair. “Alright, we do actually have to talk business a little bit. Things are looking okay right now for your case, it basically hinges on me being able to prove that Raphael having agency over you is making you suffer.”
His wings aren’t perceptible to humans unless he wills it, so he briefly runs the tip of one along Sam’s shoulder and arm. Mostly Sam seems irritated at the moment, despite his hunger being satisfied by leaf vegetables and radishes. Maybe once his stomach is full…
Castiel rolls his eyes. “You realize that it isn’t a requirement for you to be in charge of everything all the time.”
“But it’s fun! Uncle Gabe gives me nougat bars and tells me jokes while he fixes my feathers, and he teaches me stuff about ‘how to angel’ as long as I’m good and sit still.”
There ends up being no explanation - by the time Sammy comes back, the feather has disappeared.
“I understand that, but your sister would probably appreciate having you out, and maybe you have friends who can help support you…”
It’s kinda disturbing but Dean can’t even care.
“What exactly was your thought process behind allowing that to happen?!” he bellows. “There was more than enough time for you to call for medical help or take some kind of action yourself, and yet you
Dean tries to ignore the fact that he also hates what’s happening here. This isn’t “his” Cas. This Cas is going to die soon. It won’t go anywhere for them because there’s no anywhere for them
And now another you showed up to warn me about it ’cause apparently Bobby actually dies from whatever it is you’re tryna do, and Sam’s gonna get hurt, you’re gonna get hurt, lots’a people’re gonna die, and none’a that’s okay, dammit! Why didn’t you just ask for help? We would’a helped you! We could’a figured this out! Instead apparently you’re running around with fucking
“Yeah, we thought that too… they’re real achy and stiff now, though, so it’s the kinda thing that was really only gonna happen once even if I wasn’t almost gutted.”
Cas returns his attention to his own empty page. If Dean can manage this activity, then so can he. He picks up his pencil and thinks of something he can draw besides bees… and inspiration strikes when a patient not part of this group passes by the open door of the room. He’ll draw what the demons look like. No colors this time, only pencil sketching with shadows. Demons are colored a little bit in real life but they’re mostly these ugly gray smoky things with horns and barbs and blackened eyes.
“And ‘angel’ is kind of an umbrella term, and you humans wrongly use it to describe basically every celestial being. Originally it was a specific power ranking and there’s two kinds. The functionaries have the stereotypical fluffy white ones like you see in paintings and crap. Garrison warriors’ are more like a charcoal color. Seraphim wings are kinda weirdly colored, they’re shiny and rainbow like an oil slick… Raphael had these bright gold feathers and he was always super stuck up about it like we should be jealous.”
“I regret lying to you. I regret Heaven’s intolerance. I don’t regret her existence. I love her very much, and I also love you.”
“Yes. Obviously.”
Castiel would roll his eyes if he was currently in charge of Dean’s motor functions.
“Cas, are you my psychiatrist?” Dean asks, suddenly and in a harsh voice.
scrambles to snag it back in time before the Isles can lose possession, and the five of them move in overlapping circles around the goal, snapping passes back and forth and looking for an opening to take a shot.
“He knew Sam would do something stupid to bring him back otherwise. And… he trusts me. I’m actually very honored and humbled that he’s allowed me to do this for him.”
Dean, emotionally and psychologically speaking, has already been a broken man for many years. But Castiel has taken this broken man and utterly shattered him now.
“I got what I wanted. Your father stopped beating you,” Castiel answers honestly.
“Yeah. Now I’mma be worrying my ass off over here.”
different!” Dean shouts. “I don’t got a choice with Sam, Cas! He’s my brother and we’re pretty much tied to each other no matter what. Okay, you - I let you in. I
On the other hand they keep Cole Fucking Trenton on their roster, who’s a dick about that shit often enough to make his teammates uncomfortable around him. Plus whenever their PR team picks a handful of players for those behind-the-scenes interview videos asking about their home life and hobbies and families it’s always the “safe” choices like Benny or Lee Chambers or Garth, never Jesse or Crowley or Max.
They arrive at American Airlines Center and congregate in the visitors’ locker room - on the walk up the hall, Dean snags Castiel and fixes his tie, which at this point is ridiculous considering he’ll be removing it entirely in approximately five minutes.
“Okay!” Jack grins, happily accepting the plate and immediately munching on his sugary breakfast. “Are we going to Heaven again?”
“Right. Yeah. Bobby, I ain’t sleeping with Cas.”
“Crowley.”
There’s nine of them hanging around, because Daniel is doing his interview so the rest of them are waiting their turns. He’s the only one of them who’s both straight and white, but he’s also an A-captain so he’s participating anyway because that’s what leadership is. They’re all in home jerseys, but with no padding underneath or anything, and these aren’t actual game jerseys either - they’re those Fanatics ones that fans can buy for a hundred bucks on the NHL site. Dean doesn’t actually mind that, though, because these ones are a really soft and comfortable fabric.
A forearm hammers down on his elbow to break his grip and he’s smacked across the face. Castiel manages to block some of the proceeding blows, but Dean’s fists piston into his stomach and head. Fingers wrap into the shoulders of his trench coat. A knee slams up against his abdomen. Dean throws him, sending him sprawling to crash into the pile of books.
“Bobby?”
remember what Dean said, it’s a trick, that demon is really a patient like he is - appears briefly. “Cas, you got visitors.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“It feels a little weird now, knowing I am. I never expected… why didn’t you make me wear condoms if this was possible?”
Cas’ face relaxes into something that’s painted over with shame. “You weren’t supposed to remember. I suppose it’s no longer of any consequence, though. The only reason you had to forget was because events needed to proceed the way they had before up to a certain point. If you became aware of my interference, history would’ve been altered and I couldn’t risk that. The apocalypse may have proceeded otherwise.”
It’s like getting sucked through a damn vacuum cleaner hose or something. Dean’s so glad Sam’s not here for the embarrassing yelp he lets out, because he’s fucking startled okay, he didn’t know it would feel like this. And then when he’s not getting sucked along anymore, it’s because he didn’t pop back into existence still standing, and now he drops about ten feet and lands directly on his face. He’s totally disoriented and just lies there for a second, vibrating from the impact.
take that the wrong way?” Gabriel laughs. “And thanks, I like my wings.”
passes to Dean passes to
“I should’ve done something, Cas was almost too late-”
“Tonelli and Goring,” Dean says automatically, right off the top of his head. “It happened last season in February.”
“Dude what the fuck!” Dean screams from the other end.
“Who’re you talking to?” Dean whispers.
are sent out, the first line and first D-pair. Castiel watches as these five veteran players fail to pull together, and it’s obvious that even after twelve games Dean is the missing component that’s supposed to cement them together. Play gets stopped on an offside five seconds after the puck drops, which leads to Victor snapping at
so if he wants to let you touch his wings you should totally go for it, it’s like rubbing your hand on a cloud.”
“I don’t know. I don’t think so.”
“Dude, if you start teaching her trickster shit, I’ll fuckin’ end you,” Dean threatens.
“She’s sleeping,” Sam says firmly.
“Sam and I were trying to cure you,” Castiel insists frantically. “We still are.”
“It’s really not needed to be hostile, we
“Wait here,” she directs, then flies into his room.
“You boys better try harder than you did against Montreal,” John is ordering them as they begin changing into their pads. So far, Castiel doesn’t find him nearly as insufferable as Zachariah Adler, but he still can’t be called likeable by any means. “All that summer and preseason rust better be long gone by now, we need to get in gear for at least the third seed in the playoffs as early as possible. No pathetic wild-card slot like last season.”
The Bolts goalie is obviously ready for that, though, so Kevin slaps the puck to Cas, who shoots but hits the blocker. Dean recovers it as it’s tumbling away, skating until he touches the blue line before sending it back to Cas again. Cas somehow manages to control the damn chunk of rubber with only one hand on his stick, letting go with his left hand for about two seconds so that he can bludgeon a Lightning player away from himself. It’s careful enough to just
“Because that’s what happened,” Dean mumbles. “The lace on my fucking boot snapped and I had to stop and fix it. So a buddy’a mine found an IED the hard way, when it should’a been me. The only thing we found was his helmet, the rest’a him was just… gone. There wasn’t even any guts.”
“Why do you tease, Cassie?”
“Dude.
“…alright.”
“That’s good, he got a ride home?”
Lucifer makes a shoving motion with his working hand and Gabriel is sent careening backwards into a wall, hitting just a foot and a half away from Castiel.
It’s not the worst idea. And if not for the Islanders as a team then for Dean’s sake alone, Castiel would
“Why?”
“Really?”
find a way to stop Cas without killing him.
Okay. Okay. Seriously, fuck this. Fuck all of this. Dean’s done.
“Cas showed up when I was a kid,” he babbles, not able to think about anything else. “He’s. He. Fucking
“Forgive me for asking, but I’m getting a sense that there’s something else about the situation that you find unsettling besides the obvious.”
“Yes, I’m well aware,” he agrees.
“I don’t know. I need to go back to my room.”
The other takeaway Dean gets from this is just how unloved Cas has felt. It’s not only the shame or the absence of affection, Cas never thought he deserved to be loved, either.
“Okay, it’s straight again,” Sammy wavers, wincing with an expression of sympathy.
There’s no possible way he can evade detection now, though truth be told that’s probably the least of his worries. His legs buckle and he collapses into a pile, wondering if this is how it feels to be food items in a frying pan being cooked by a human. His wings and his arms both collapse as well so that he can’t hold himself up or crawl, so his only choice is to roll onto his side and look for whatever danger will be coming for him.
“Why d’you hate hugs, Cas?”
Dean for a very long time now. If Dean was an angel instead of a severely traumatized human being, I would’ve already built him a nest several years ago.”
“Dean-”
“But you hate therapy.”
“Fine. Then Mom’s driving.”
“Why do you think it was him?”
Dean nods slowly, not breaking eye contact. He moves his hand to settle gently on the side of Cas’ face; Cas leans into the touch without meaning to, though he doesn’t fight it once he realizes what he’s doing. He’s not sure how they got here, but before he can ask Dean speaks again.
Castiel whips around, flinging aside the towel he was rubbing his head with. “Jack? What are you doing here, you should be at school.”
“Dean,” Cas says softly. “I know you don’t want to hear me say I’m sorry again, so I won’t.”
“Quiet,” he snaps, squeezing harder with his arms. “Agree with me that what you did was detrimental and unnecessary.”
“Lazy,” Dean teases, then grudgingly turns his eyes back to the book. “‘During our careful studies of the subject in question, we’ve at once gathered substantial information and raised innumerable further questions. For instance, Archangel Gabriel refused to speak on the topic of his siblings’ strengths and weaknesses, but explained in great detail why it’s so necessary for them to be able to harm one another.’ Okay, when the hell was Gabe gonna tell us he let the BMoL hassle him for this shit back in…” Dean flips to the inside front cover. “…fucking 1891?”
he snaps in Enochian over a private band of Angel Radio that only the two of them share.
The sound of his shortcomings eventually ceases, but not for long. It comes to him intermittently, Dean praying:
Cole is charging after the puck, but a Canadien is closer and scoops it up first. Dean and Benny struggle to catch up and stop a one-on-one situation, because Garth is good but he shouldn’t just get hung out to dry like that. Dean almost throws himself off balance while body-checking the Hab off the puck and snagging it for himself, but he gets himself recentered in time to saucer-pass to Lee Webb, who’s switched places with Crowley. The third four-on-four unit changes on man by man, and the last to get on the bench again is Dean once he has an opening to trade spots with Jesse.
instead of
Does he even care.
of finesse before approaching anyone else with this, I’ll put in the effort needed to help construct your little scandal with as few complications as possible. Do we have a deal?”
Even if he hadn’t done multiple treacherous things in short order of each other, and even if his remaining lifespan wasn’t likely measured in days at this point, Castiel would still not deserve to have Dean for his mate. It draws on something he’d said back before they became friends, after the raising of a greater demon and the breaking of a seal - humans are works of art. Not all artwork is comparable. Most humans, in Castiel’s opinion, are comic book drawings or children’s finger paintings. Dean, on the other hand, is equivalent to the sistine chapel. And Castiel is a wavelength of light and celestial intent, currently bound in a flesh container that lost its original owner and so would die and rot without his presence. Art is not and has never been made for angels.
As much as he appreciates awful people getting what’s coming to them, or practical jokes that leave the recipient mangled in some way, he’s been deliberately choosing things that will only annoy or inconvenience the overgrown Winchester without causing physical harm. Sure, he could totally fix any broken bones or wounds or accidental deaths that Sam might suffer, but he just doesn’t want to go to the trouble. So, harmless pranks it is.
“Actually, out of four older brothers, he’s the one who’s the nicest and most reasonable to me.”
They cluster in the left circle for the faceoff. Crowley slaps it backwards to
Cas yanks away. “DON’T TOUCH ME!” And now he does run even though it’s against the rules. He reaches his destination and slaps his palm frantically on the counter to get the nurse’s attention. “I need my ativan…” The words almost can’t come out because he isn’t breathing well.
“Great.”
The puck drops and the Oilers win it.
Play stops on a call for a hand-pass and the fourth line is sent alongside the second D-pair. Crowley doesn’t win the faceoff and so the Islanders are messily bulldozed back into their own zone, working to stop the Devils from screening their goalie and also to keep any good shooting lanes from opening up.
“Dean, you’re the one who dragged him in here all pissed off about this in the first place!”
“I thought they like getting attention.”
Would you believe me if I told you that, going into this fic, I did
“You and Cas, man, you’re killing me,” he groans.
He can’t even voice the thought, because it escapes him too quickly. He’s sure he was about to say
Castiel explains, spasming at the pain and causing Dean to flinch as well.
“Yes, in general. The most important thing is that she’s alright. She emerged unscathed.”
“Too literal, Cas. Anyway, if he still wants to start seeing you, you should give him a box of those Rice Krispy Treats that have the chocolate drizzles on top because he’s always eating candy anyway but Rice Krispy Treats are kinda their own weird thing-”
After spending all night making and then orienting a fresh batch of angels (to say nothing of hearing Naomi bitching and moaning about his methods the whole fucking time), Gabriel’s entire goal this morning before the humans start moving and making noise is to eat five pounds of chocolate-dipped strawberries. He deserves it after having to stop Naomi and Castiel from tearing each other’s throats out eight times.
“Um. No?” he answers, utterly baffled. “Why would you think so?”
“Thanks.”
Jack is a sweet kid.
“Sure.”
“And you better not come back here in a hurry, either.”
That tells Dean basically everything in just two sentences. Cas is a good parent and Jack loves him. More than that, Cas is Jack’s hero. John was Dean’s hero until John started making Dean into a hockey player. Dean was taught very harshly to do nothing besides obsess over how he can be better (as a teammate and a defender and just in general), to keep his grades in school just barely good enough that they won’t kick him off the team, that hockey is the be-all-end-all of his existence to the exclusion of literally anything else that life could offer. But that won’t happen to Jack. Jack will get to keep his hero, his dad, and will probably never get drafted into the NHL but that won’t matter because he’ll be healthy and functional and happy. Hockey will always be a fun game for Jack and not a way of life.
Dean and Benny go through their stretching routines together against the sideboards, and occasionally Dean notices Cas poking around and doing stuff - taking pot-shots at Frank, having a conversation with Kevin while skating backwards in front of his liney. The dude’s talented as hell and a great leader, Dean can only pray he doesn’t get traded for mouthing off to John almost as much as Crowley does.
“Why’re you giving me the bitchface? I’m not the one who turned you into Bullwinkle.”
“It makes my feet hurt,” Jack whines.
Dean works on that idea mentally for a second. “So what, eventually you’d build me a bed or something?”
“I like this tie,” Cas says, way more defensive than he needs to be over one of the most worthless-ass articles of clothing ever devised by mankind.
The second line is sent and the D-pair stays, the faceoff happens on the left dot. And less than a minute into the game a disaster occurs.
Which also makes perfect sense; Sammy’s son will be named after Bobby and also their paternal grandfather, one of their few blood relatives who wasn’t a total dick.
And then Dean’s phone buzzes in his pocket. He holds up a finger and answers without looking to see who’s calling. “Yeah.”
Jack’s wings flutter a little bit and the feathers puff up happily when Dean says that. “I’m learning to be an archangel,” he informs Bobby proudly.
“So what, I’m officially claimed for the halo patrol?” Dean snorts
amusing, he’s still got a stick up his ass despite being fallen for
Castiel’s grace is starting to rebel. It wants to be free, to heal the damage to his vessel being caused by the Tablet, to try and peel away the warding that’s trapping his older brother. He has no solution for that, though, because he’s not powerful enough. Still, he’ll need to come up with something. He can’t go unnoticed forever and the sigils dug into his skin are limited; they won’t hide him from a greater demon.
Dean doesn’t say anything for a minute, mostly due to mild shock. Eventually, quietly: “I’m sorry that happened to you, Cas.”
“Don’t you think you’re skipping a few steps?”
if we stayed put.”
“Dean-”
I debated long and hard whether to cut this chapter because on the surface it maybe seems pointless, but... this is just what autism is like. It's hard and it sucks and there's an absolute lack of control in these situations, when you very quickly get
fix what he did.
“I’m in pain.”
There is a baby girl in his arms.
“I know you know I get covered in monster guts every day that ends in Y,” Dean snorts as he pulls his t-shirt over his head.
Wings flap and then they’re alone. Cas slowly stands up, pulling Dean after him. Dean can move again, he’s whole, he breathes and he lives even though really he shouldn’t do either of those things anymore. He wraps both arms around Cas as tight as he can, because if he ever lets go his angel will just vanish again into some horrible non-existence somewhere.
On the one hundred and tenth day, Cas is finally due to return home.
“I’ll manage. Jack will make friends with every single one of your family members by the end of our first day there.”
“Cas, don’t.”
“So was that your girlfriend?” one of his teammates whose name he still doesn’t know asks when he’s taking a break for water.
Cas looks just in time for Dean to fall out of bed and onto the floor.
“Yeah, well, I
Cas knows him too well. Cas knows something’s wrong. Dean loves him.
“Rest assured, if there is a crash, there’s a very high chance you’ll be killed instantly, so you won’t feel it happen.”
Actually, the question Dean should
Cas moves to help and Dean essentially climbs upright using him as a ladder. Dean’s pretty green eyes are glazed over and half-awake, and Cas stumbles under the drugged weight of his friend. But Dean is cognizant, just uncoordinated at the moment. He gets Cas to lay on his stomach on the bed, and then lies down on Cas’s back. The compression is better than any weight blanket ever manufactured.
Castiel’s stomach does something funny when Dean says that. “You think I’m handsome?”
“The nice kind?”
Dean shuffles into the kitchen and pours himself some coffee, then promptly almost chokes himself to death when he starts laughing in the middle of trying to swallow. A newly-arrived Sam is much less appreciative of the spectacle.
“I’mma hold you to that, brother.”
“Alright, thanks buddy,” Dean grins.
“Yeah, I am,” Sam nods.
“What’s the word, Cas?”
- Zeddmore - is a center and the other three of them are wingers, so he takes the faceoff. Castiel finds himself positioned back on the blue line with Dean, possibly because he’s the only left-handed Islander on the ice at the moment so it makes for better coverage to have him on that side to catch any mishaps. Castiel isn’t spectacular at defense but he’ll manage regardless.
“Sam, in the absence of being able to explain myself to Dean, I should make this confession to you so that you can pass it on.”
He has to find Cas. He needs - he needs Cas to say something in that weird overly-blunt way, something about how Dean is strong enough to keep pushing it back. Because he wants to die, but he needs Cas to tell him why he’ll still be able to live. But maybe that’s not a good idea. Because the last few days when he looks at Cas, his face starts to ache. He gets these little impressions of something but then when he closes his eyes the after-image is burned in, blue-white lines of ragged wings and a flaring halo and the piercing gaze of a holy creature. Just being around Cas prickles on Dean’s skin and mind until it’s almost unbearable.
on the same team now after all.”
“I never tortured him on purpose. Try to empathise, Gabriel. You were very excited when Sam went to the difficulty of pranking you back. Think about how he shows love and affection to people, and then do that, along with offering him your absurdly dangerous book in lieu of a feather. Or, possibly, just give him a feather. He’s extremely intelligent and I’m sure it would take him less than an hour to understand the meaning behind it.”
“I can watch over you while you sleep if you want.”
“There’s no solution,” Dean says flatly. “The Book of the Damned was burned and that’s the only lead we had. You’re not gonna find anything else.”
“Ah, they’re great usually.” Now Dean has his normal smile. “We got some good talent in our younger guys, and y’know Cas scored half of our goals tonight, so we know he’s pretty awesome especially after taking a hit like that. I think we got a good season ahead of us.”
“No, and I don’t care, either.”
The plane is moving by now, and Dean seems to be paler than normal. Castiel makes an assessment based on the limited information available to him and takes a decision - they’re teammates, he should be supportive because that’s how teammates are supposed to behave. Castiel grabs Dean’s left shoulder in his hand and squeezes tightly enough to attract his captain’s attention. At the very least, the action should confuse Dean and therefore trick him into not focusing on what the plane is doing.
“I know. And you, as a human, are intrinsically afraid of death. Especially the deaths of your loved ones. Will it help you to know that I won’t be in pain when it happens?”
“Alright, Dean. You may see my wings, but only because I know that at this time it’s not within your power to injure them. I need them to fly and to travel through time.”
“Hey, whatever floats your boat. But some other angel would get freaked out if you offered.” Gabriel expertly starts picking at the coverts closest to Jack’s shoulder blades. “There’s other things, too. Your best choice would be Cas, if he’d ever bothered to try and teach you this stuff. But I’m sure he was too busy staring at Dean and drooling, so you’re stuck with me for now. Most angels pick a close friend or their mate for this.”
“Man, what?” Dean groans.
He sucks on the not-juice for a second. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Well, you and Sam got what you wanted for starters,” Dean snarls. “So congrats. All three’a you take first prize for ruining my fucking day. Okay, Cas, spill. You even think about zapping outta here and I start stabbing.”
And you would’ve also done
Pacing around in this fucking hallway, Dean doesn’t get how there aren’t more hallways, this is like an extra-long shipping container but with doors. The ends are closed off. Great. Fucking
“It’s not dissimilar in principle,” Castiel says slowly. “But humans are much more creative and varied about it from what I’ve observed. Much of our courting process involves our wings and feathers, and ultimately assesses compatibility to build a nest together. A mated pair of angels will groom each other and molt together once per century, or at least that’s how it was before the Fall. It’s reasonable to assume this behavior will be adopted by the new generation of angels that Gabriel is constructing in Heaven, since they have fresh and undamaged wings. But the few original brothers and sisters I have left are all in possession of destroyed wings and they no longer bother with grooming.”
to tell Dean those things, share those details, explain why recalling it is soothing or even joyous to him. It wasn’t a mission like he’d believed at the time… it was a start, the beginning of a long falling in love and him learning to cope with ideas and emotions that he’d never been intended to experience.
“Can we have pizza?”
Castiel’s feet leave the ice and he slams down to the ice after a check by - oh, who else. He’s already flinging his gloves and stick away as he gets back up, the whistle hasn’t been blown yet but he absolutely does not care about that or about the fact that they’re forty seconds into the match. Fists start flying. Castiel’s helmet is beaten right off his head and he definitely feels his nose break from the following blow; meanwhile, he’s reaming his knuckles into the side of Nick’s chest where he knows the padding ends until the Devils’ captain is unbalanced and they both topple down into a pile, still swinging at each other until the officials pry them apart.
Dean would throw something at him if there was anything around to do it with. There could’ve been a better version of Cas, one who could stop fucking up for two seconds and actually fix things.
“Are you fucking serious?” Dean yelps. “And - really, Bobby?
“A hockey player,” Dean says, and it doesn’t even feel like a lie because the truth is he never learned to want anything else.
“What? I never get to see him, so I’m gonna spoil him as much as I can,” his brother says.
“I fucking hate flying, man.”
Dean and Jack do a couple of cool-down laps around the outside of the rink before going to shuck their padding. The little guy put up with it pretty well, and Dean makes sure to tell him so as they’re stuffing everything into their gearbags. Jack looks tired, but proud of himself. A great combination on the face of a young hockey player.
gets his shit together.”
“I don’t understand why the rules are different for me than they were for… alternative-me.”
“Dean.”
“You poor sunuva bitch,” Dean chuckles. “Should’a been watching prob’ly anyone else to learn that, ’cause I suck at it.”
“Great. I don’t suppose you asked what this alleged bad guy did.”
They don’t say anything as he drives them home to the bunker. Right now, it’s all just too much.
“Yeah, but this is different. I can’t fall asleep when someone’s staring at me. You can’t stare because you don’t have eyes right now.”
Dean agrees.
“Dude,
John is yelling at them mercilessly for being subpar and it occurs to Castiel that the constant barking and insults is probably at least fifty percent of why they aren’t doing well tonight. He’s about to say as much when
“Hello, Dean.”

Mary shrieks in terror and then a flash of pain shoots through his upper back as she rips out fistfuls of his feathers in an attempt to catch herself. He hears her thump against the floor and when he turns she’s sitting and marveling at what’s in her hands, completely unconcerned about what just happened. Her own wings flap slightly, obviously in reflex. She doesn’t even appear to notice.
there things you’re possibly angry about, though?” Bela asks with a smile he doesn’t like. He’s seen it before when she was goading Dean.
Castiel considers Gabriel’s similar endeavor, a significantly more reckless and loud attempt at courting complete with the offering of a feather. His brother is ten billion years older than him, yet somehow inordinately immature about certain things. Castiel has been much more careful, once he’d finally taken the decision to offer himself to Dean. He can be impulsive and reactive, but in this case he’s been very deliberate in his actions. It’s important when building a nest, after all, there can’t be any haphazard attempts during construction.
On the ninety third morning, Cas eats one of his lemon puddings while meeting with his psychiatrist because his breakfast wasn’t particularly satisfying and also he enjoys citrus in most forms. (Except grapefruit - too bitter and unpleasant.) It’s a type of stimming, technically, and the main reason he’s constantly drinking orange juice.
“Because you
woke up like. Three minutes ago.” Dean rubs his eyes on his fingertips and takes a long gulp of beer while he waits for his brother’s words to sink into his brain. “So wait, he let you see his wings? Good for you, man. His are pretty cool-looking.”
“Are you okay?”
“You were tryna tell me a swishy wave of light could somehow be straight,” Bobby answers sarcastically.
“Go away, Cas,” Dean whimpers from where he’s stuffed his head under his pillow.
They find Jack in the dungeon of all fucking places, sitting cross-legged in a corner and staring at the floor. His wings are tucked tightly behind his back and his hands are balled into fists in his lap.
“You love it,” he accusingly teases.
“Well, I’m not starting from scratch,” Gabriel explains. “We’re gonna go find some souls and turn them into angels. That’s where you come in, you’re the one being all picky about this shit for me.”
“Yes.”
I swear to Chuck if Tampa wins game 5 tonight... >:(
“Hello, Dean.”
“Yeah, that makes sense… how long will it take?”
“Woah, you guys
The door closes. “Listening…”
Dean gets back on his skates and almost can’t curl his fingers around his stick, because of god damn course he had to hurt his dominant hand. When he gets another pass from Benny, it takes everything he has not to drop his fucking stick and clutch his right arm to his chest, and when he wings it over to Crowley his jaw clenches so hard he almost thinks he’s about to bite right through his mouthguard.
“Dude, you let my car get banged up by one’a Crowley’s hellhounds and I still haven’t forgiven you for the iPod jack.”
So he ends up in front of the PR camera again. They ask him to say why he waited until now to come out (which he of course lies about because the actual answer isn’t media friendly), and to go on about how supportive his teammates are, which is a bunch of half-truths. He makes jokes about how they were apparently taking bets on him the whole time and meanwhile on the inside he’s still kinda freaking out about that.
Victor,
“This is a good thing, Dean. I’m proud of you, and I’m sure Sam is, too.”
He sprawls on Bobby’s couch and pops open the book, but there’s a reason he usually has his brother do this part for him, especially when it comes to old text like this. It’s all tiny font with paragraphs crammed together, all looking the same, he loses his place constantly and inevitably gives up in about fifteen minutes.
“I’m an angel of the Lord. My name is Castiel, I’m a friend of Dean Winchester. He prayed for me to save you and so I’m here.”
But among the prisoners of this Prince of Hell is a shimmering aftertaste of archangel grace, blunt and muted somehow. Castiel takes this as an indication of powerful warding being in place. But it’s definitely Gabriel. He’d know Gabriel anywhere, the archangel who kept an eye on him when he was just a young fledgeling digging trenches under the oceans before he was gifted with tactical knowledge and assigned to Ishim’s garrison. He’d asked once why the moon didn’t have oceans and trenches as well, to which Gabriel had laughed and taken them both there. For a brief few decades, as a treat for his unusual curiosity, the archangel had allowed him to pound craters into the dusty surface until Michael caught them and sent them back to Earth where they were supposed to be working.
“’Cause you’re not a Ranger anymore.”
“Doesn’t mean it has to die. C’mon, Cas.”
Sam chuckles as he smooths a cluster of feathers. “Naturally.”
is the goalie in-net tonight, and Castiel is reasonably certain he’s the one Dean often complains about being inconsistent, so seeing the opposing team charge right for their defensive zone right at the start of the game is not comforting.
“Would you prefer Dumbass?”
The stick-taping ritual is actually one of his favorites, it’s almost meditative in a sense, and it’s also one of those weird hockey things where no two players do it exactly the same way. He wraps the handle eleven and a half inches down with a few extra layers at the end to form a knob, and the blade gets taped heel-to-toe. Ever since he was a kid falling over himself he’s always used black stick tape because it’s luckier; white tape is basically neutral, and when all his friends were putting red or bright blue or pink tape on their sticks he’d always done black because for him any of those flashy colors pissed off the hockey gods.
“Will do.”
know most hunters don’t make it past forty five years old. So maybe instead of worrying about what I wanted when you were a baby or anything John ever did to you, you should try to figure out how to be happier with however much time you have. So if you want to be a hunter then keep hunting, but if you
and return to the attacking zone. The two defensemen change out with the second D-pair and Dean drops onto the bench on Castiel’s right, panting and sweating and squirting a water bottle all over his face and neck.
Said together: “Don’t tell Sam.” And they share a conspiratorial smile.
“It wasn’t a particularly common occurrence,” Cas answers, looking sideways - Dean decides that probably means Cas came down to Earth to check on him at least once a week. It’s touching and creepy at the same time. “I wanted to make sure you were safe, you have something of a reputation with monsters on this continent.”
“I like Cas better.”
about Crowley. He’s a huge pain in the ass and sometimes he’s straight up unbearable to be around, but he’s also the only member of the team who’s not scared to get pissy with their coach. It also helps, probably, that he’s signed to a six year contract for one thing and for another thing he’s too smart and too good a player for the GM to toss just for getting mouthy. Dean almost chews through his fucking tongue trying not to laugh.
“Um. Thanks. That sounds… kinda ominous.”
Sam is close by and catches him before he lands on the floor. Castiel can’t even summon the strength to keep his eyes open and feels the baby being removed from his arms.
“I don’t know yet. I’m sure he won’t be anywhere near as bad as having my brother for a captain.”
“No, but my older brother was the captain so an exception was made.”
“Oh! Can I come, too? I always wondered what it looks like there! And maybe I can help. Also, I’d like to visit my mother.”
he’s gorgeous - no, fuck, no, don’t think shit like that. “Are you alright?”
“You need to calm down.”
“Okay,” the therapist nods, smiling at him. “Why is it broken?”
“Sure.”
watching Dean die slowly and painfully for absolutely no good reason at all! Was there some malfunction in your brain? Were you aware that you’re suffering from an utter lack of regard for his safety, now? Explain to me why you thought this was in

us for being interested?”
“I’m real, Dean,” Cas whispers, so quietly that Dean almost can’t hear him. These words are just for Dean. Sam’s not allowed to have them. “Jack rescued me. Now I’m here to rescue you. Everything’s going to be fine.”
Fifty six minutes after he’s been admitted, Cas’ oxygen feed is switched to the portable tank mounted to the underside of the stretcher and they wheel him away for x-rays. Both hands are photographed several times, then his ribs, his throbbing left shoulder, and finally his head because he may have fractures in the bones under his face.
“Dammit, Cas, I spent all day talking about shit already, can’t I catch a fucking break?” he groans. He downs the last few drops and gets rid of the bottle. “I need a clean shirt.”
“Technically. There are other small details. Feathers are important.”
“Whatcha up to, Gigantor?”
“No, I’m not that unprofessional!”
“Girlfriend?”
how you still haven’t learnt your lesson.”
Castiel fastens the strap of his helmet under his chin and gradually moves his eyes over everyone around him, still at the beginning of his struggle to equate faces with jersey numbers. It’s hard to say whether faces or names are harder for him, but numbers are easy and don’t usually change. He needs to match faces to numbers, and names will follow, or maybe it’s the other way around. So far he knows Crowley, because he already knew that bastard before coming here. He knows Kevin because Kevin is their shortest player and also the only Asian one, so he’s easy to differentiate. Victor and Max are both Black, but they’re not hard to tell apart because Victor has a much richer skin tone and also a beard. Everyone else is white, mostly the same shade of white, Castiel has no idea who they are except Dean because Dean is beautiful and stands out.
“Really?”
“And it’s a huge privilege.”
“Dean-”
Two days have passed since Cas was almost murdered by one of his brothers.
But that sounds wrong. Dean knows Sam’s wrong but he doesn’t know how he knows that. He only sorta
Cas protests.
“Hey, Charlie.”
What this means is nurses from other units of the hospital, and who aren’t familiar with the patients here. What this means for Cas specifically is one of them standing directly behind him, which is never something that goes well because it’s essentially his “instant panic attack” button. It becomes an ordeal, especially with Dean nearby to witness this and then starting to yell at the nurses as Cas’ legs go out from under him while he hyperventilates. That incites a code green called on Dean - multiple staff pile on him and inject him with tranquilizers before dragging him away. Cas is given his ativan and both of them lie on their beds in silence for awhile.
“Yes.”
Dean can’t move. At
“Sam-”
He gets out of bed. There’s no falling asleep again and he knows it. His clothes rub an invisible road-rash into his shoulders and hips. His slippers are padded with thumbtacks. He’s cold but sweats under his arms. Everything is wrong right now. Everything is wrong with
“Aren’t you lucky to have such a great brother?”
“Yeah, well, it ain’t. ’Cause you basically promised me he wouldn’t get free, and then guess what! I was about two seconds from getting my ass hauled back down to the Pit!”
Despite being seated, he falls backwards into the veil.
“Okay! Bro, bro’s boyfriend, bro’s boyfriend’s brother, by all means stay here. Baby nephew, follow me.”
” Dean snorts.
“Only if there are too many demons.”
It only rings once.
Castiel chuckles. “Alright, I’ll see what I can do.”
“Wait, really?”
“Why?”
“Wow, Cas. Be more petty.”
Cas explains.
They’re running out of time. Dean has murdered an innocent boy for no other reason than the Mark hammering against his mind for him to
Cas doesn’t run for the nurses’ station because they’ve told him multiple times to not do that. He really wants to, though, especially because his brother is following him at a brisk pace.
“Uh. I guess. Dinner went okay, maybe I can be friends with him.”
Castiel moves in closer so that their foreheads rest together. Dean’s arms slip behind his neck and Castiel subsequently discovers that kissing a crying person is something of an odd experience, but as that crying person is Dean Winchester he’s unable to have objections or reservations about it. He holds Dean close to his chest and then wraps Dean with his wings for an added layer of warmth and comfort.
“No shit.”
“Somebody there?” he whispers, opening his eyes and parting his hands. “Hello?”
“It’s worth noting that in my studies of humans, small gestures are also important.
“A little, I guess.” Dean swallows. “Cas… I don’t get it, man. How are you cool with this?”
A number of you who've left comments on previous chapters may recall my assurances to you back in chapters 8-9 that Dean deliberately overdosing on his medications is only the second worst thing that happens in the fic...
reintegration and briefings. It won’t be immediate but it should be doable.”
“Okay good,” he chuckles, kissing the back of Castiel’s neck again.
Dean thinks, not able to open his mouth just yet.
Castiel would get up and leave and trying to stop him because apparently that means Dean’s not in control of his players. Never mind that they aren’t Dean’s fucking players, he’s just the captain, not a coach or upper management. For fuck’s sake already. Of course Dean doesn’t say any of that no matter how much he wants to. He knows it won’t end well if he does.
Castiel holds still and relaxes. It’s been longer than he can be bothered to recall since the last time he’s had his wings groomed by a sibling and the sensation is a welcome one, even with less than twenty percent of his plumage growing in at this point.
“Gabriel please stop calling me that.”
“Bitch.”
On the surface level, what a human being would be able to see, Dean’s skin is pale as his blood favors his vital organs, anticipating further combat. His face reads of a simple and uncaring brand of destructive rage, indicating that he’s not fully cognizant at the moment. Any small action could push him into a violent outburst.
“You okay?”
“Dean,” Castiel tries again. He needs to get through, help Dean get control again. “Stop…”
“OH COME ON YOU LIVE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. I SHOULD GET TO BE FUN SINCE I WON’T HARDLY EVER GET TO SEE THEM IN PERSON” Dean points out.
A penalty kill of
Cas says randomly as Dean’s touching up a few last things with his can of spray paint.
“I don’t care, Cas. Okay? ’Cause you’re tryna fix this, and - wait, what happens if you do fix everything?”
too fucking risky, or literally any of the cities where Canadian teams live; hell, sometimes he’s too paranoid to even try when he’s home in New York. But here in Tampa maybe one in a thousand people will know who he is if he’s (un)lucky. So, that means that tonight after the game he can slip out of the hotel, hop onto Grindr, and get railed by some guy that he’ll never see again or even probably learn the name of.
That one gets Dean to stop walking, even though he already knows by now. This hallway is all of Cas’ regrets, things he’s ashamed of.
“Yeah, well, speaking of that, I got you some stuff to start with that’ll at least make the next few days a little easier on you,” Dean grins, already missing the weight now that they’re on the floor and Cas doesn’t have to cling to him for dear life anymore.
Castiel isn’t accustomed to feeling fear during combat, but until now he’s never been directly putting Dean in harm’s way just through his own participation. What’s worse is that Dean can detect Castiel’s emotions and is helpless to react any other way than his own surge of terror, when normally he’s absurdly brave. Instinctively, reflexively, Castiel’s wings flap in a futile attempt to remove them from the impending peril.
by you, okay?” he snaps.
“Hmm…” Dean chews, likely thinking. “That’s tough. I guess it depends who makes it. Apple’s usually right up near the top’a the list, though.”
“MAKE ME JERK”
Cas promises.
“Generally you call me ‘Cas’ in abbreviation if it helps.”
Sunlight leaks in around the edges of the curtains, catching in Dean’s short hair and causing it to glow in a way that’s nothing short of lovely. It looks so soft and Cas wants to touch it, but he knows that’s not socially acceptable and so he doesn’t. Instead he raises his lower arm to stare at his cast. Dean and Sam and Gabriel and Anna and Michael have all signed it; Dean was the first one to do so, right there in the hospital as soon as the nurse said it was dry enough to write on. His signature is also the largest one.
Despite further griping on Dean’s part, they do both get out of bed in a reasonable amount of time and Cas even manages to get him to change his clothes. Sitting with their trays in the day room, at a table in the corner beside the patient fridge, Cas realizes that he also hasn’t been eating very well while Dean was in intensive care. He concludes that first of all, he’s a hypocrite, and second of all they’re both equally terrible at self-preservation.
At least he’s managing to frustrate his brother just as bad as his own head is frustrating him right now. “Dean, the angel hasn’t been wrong yet! Someone’s gonna do something awful, and I can stop it!”
“It’s inscribed with the Word of God,” Cas explains gravely. “But it’s powerful beyond just that. An angel could potentially tap into its energy and become unfathomably dangerous as a result. I’m not aware of how one would go about doing such a thing, but it’s possible.”
“Your breakfast is here, and you should probably let Cas get up so he can eat, too.”
