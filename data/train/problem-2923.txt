It makes sense that Castiel isn’t a fallen angel. He’s not looking to get human experiences out of his days – instead, he seems to be equal parts confused and impressed about everything that comes his way.
“There’s a lot of older people in our affiliates,” Dean adds, “and we need to have some fresh winds blowing through their pants, if you know what I mean.”
Yeah, everything had changed, Dean thought solemnly. He stopped for a moment to admire the beauty of the ocean that reached into canals here closer to the heart of the city. He leaned against the railing and kicked some stones off into the blackness below. All kinds of lights were illuminating both air and water; some Christmas chain lights here and there, general lampposts by pavements and across the bridge and to the right, an allotment garden held some warm, welcoming candles and lanterns. This Christmas no snow had fallen and the ground lay as black as the ocean.
“Hah, there we go,” one of the voices say, and just as Castiel is starting to feel relieved because of what sounds like the end of the conversation, the phone in his pocket buzzes vigorously against his thigh.
“I respect your point of view, but I’m thinking about how well we are going to play together. If they hate me immensely, I’m afraid it will affect all of our performances.”
“So, what gives? You’re this grumpy old traveler who doesn’t know the US exists, don’t carry a phone with you, and honestly… You don’t seem too phased with me falling from the sky. What’s your deal?”
“You tell me. Are there people you’re concerned of? Is someone getting way past their limit with alcohol?”
It’s a beach. There’s apparently a portal over the sea, and for some reason it makes Dean laugh – the image of serious, holy angels tumbling ass-first in the ocean as their first deed on earth is hilarious. Castiel rolls his eyes, but it’s fond – and for some reason, it warms Dean’s heart more than he cares to admit. There’s something supernatural about most angels, but in all of his awkwardness and snarkiness, Castiel is so
The look in Dean’s face is of mild surprise, and Castiel realizes he might just have stepped over some boundaries. Sure, Dean could respect his opinion regarding the party, but it’s a whole other thing to suggest what Dean should do with his free time.
Castiel wakes up to his phone ringing, and that’s what makes him realize he’s fallen asleep in the first place.
Castiel doesn’t want to tell anyone what’s going on; they hadn’t talked about it, but he assumes a high-class man such as Dean Winchester wouldn’t want to be associated with this kind of activity.
“I like swimming, sharks or no,” Kevin says, calculating the sea. Then, he throws his shirt over his head, bounces off the bench and runs towards the vast ocean.
“Then come get me,” Dean answered. Castiel shuffled closer to the tree, barely hesitating, and when he was just a couple of feet away, Dean launched himself up, jumped onto the back of the couch and leaped back on the floor, and through the kitchen, and through the dining hall again, and up the stairs and into the master bedroom, and to the walk-in closet that connected to another bedroom. There, he fell down and let his momentum slide him under the bed.
He tries to put all of this in perspective. Is this is a thing to be overly panicked about, or should he just forget about this? Do these things happen to everyone at some point? Is there a person who is absolutely never at least a bit scared in their life?
It takes a couple of weeks to bump into Castiel now that their performances are over. Dean takes a couple of walks through Lynn Woods in hopes of meeting him, and also visits the theater regularly, but it’s his exhaustion that finally lands him in Castiel’s atmosphere.
The man makes it to solid ground and then just kind of stays there, on all fours, dripping water and sputtering. Castiel takes a hesitant step away, but something not unlike a nurturing instinct awakes in him--he should help the poor guy out. If he really dropped from the sky into a strange country, it must be miserable. Now he’s also wet, probably starving, and completely lost.
This isn’t exactly coming out of nowhere, but it still catches Castiel off guard. He inhales the fresh ocean air that comes from just around the block, and sighs aloud.
Sure, he could ask for an explanation, but he can already see himself deflecting the conversation. He would see James blaming him for things that weren’t his fault, and him blaming himself for not generally being better. The overwhelming feeling of not being good enough is never going to let him go, no matter how many gigs he’s played or how many times he tries to act like Jane.
“I don’t want to be telling you what’s really troubling me, since I know you’re smart,” he said, returning his hands on Castiel, this time on his hips.
He’s gone soft. He’s slipping. He needs to put the barriers back up, and never leave his house again.
“I don’t know what you’ve been told, but you should never refer to sex as bonking again,” Castiel chuckles. “No, angels don’t hold temples while fucking. And it’s hard to explain. When we came in through that door, I heard the portal. It’s a divine source of energy, and angels can hear divine sources of energy. Everything divine has a beat, or a melody, some even a full song. Human souls are divine, so they have a sound too.”
On Tuesday morning, Castiel meets his friends in the lobby of Winchester, Inc. Dean sent the details of their meeting place just before ten, apologizing for the lack of heads-up, but it didn’t matter — they had been ready to leave on short notice. Initially, they’d planned to walk, but a sudden rain flushed that plan down the drain. After a short argument about Castiel not being ready to take the monorail, they took a cab.
“I wish I still had time to knit, though,” Dean mutters. Castiel tilts his head and takes another look at the blue and white striped socks. They look even — Castiel hasn’t tried to knit anything in years, but his products are half too loose and the other too tight, some stitches so loose they’re on the way. Dean’s handiwork looks like a grandparent’s.
Dean nods, swallowing. He lowers his gaze to the bubbles in his glass and Castiel instinctively steps closer. They’re inches away now, but for some reason, the lack of personal space feels reassuring.
”Well,” Dean said, sighing at the view of Manhattan through his 12th story hotel window. There was something in Anna’s voice that made him hesitate, and then lie. He didn’t want to come off too eager - or a stalker, for the matter. ”I don't know. Do you have any relatives or anything near here so you could possibly meet up with me as you meet up with them?”
“What else, then? Food, check, drinks, check, entertainment, check. Boat, check and check. We’ll get all the people in there, no sweat,” Meg lists, “it’s a perfect spot. Of course, we’ll have to get there super early to get everything in order before the party starts. We need to build a stage and stuff.”
“I wanted to get to know you better,” Dean says. Castiel lifts his eyebrows. Is he really that forward? Is Castiel reading way too much into this?
“But I’m not sure what I’m able to do,” Castiel says, “I mean, if we practice choreography a bit, that I can get somewhat down… But I don’t know how to channel that confidence people have.”
“Yes, I remember him,” she starts hesitantly. “He came in a hurry, and left in an even bigger one. He told me to make sure you got the ring.”
Castiel squints. He doesn’t get the frame of reference here, and he feels bad already. He told James earlier that Bart isn’t a bad person, and he fears James will take the conversation there now.
This has long moved past wanting something. This has turned into a craving, a desire, a founding formation to his hierarchy of needs.
Castiel is shaking. Echoes of the collision are still loud and clear in his ears as he bends over to let out whatever he’d consumed that day, and he feels like he might faint. This is a whole different situation than the one at the harbor a couple of years ago – this isn’t anxiety, this is a
“Great. If you decide to come, meet me by the dock when we’re finished for tonight. If you won’t, I won’t hold it against you.”
“Why, hello,” Dean says, unable to look away from Castiel. This simple phenomenon makes Castiel feel like he’s the most beautiful entity in the universe.
”, he'd said and Castiel could almost hear his voice next to his ear, whispering and begging for forgiveness,
“Already making decisions about the rooms, eh?” she asks, a quirk of her lips hinting at something she's not telling.
Turns out, he worries over nothing, because Dean has this under control. As Castiel takes his first coffee break of the day, he’s surprised with a little origami star in his coffee cup. It unwraps into a long strip of paper with another sentence, this one with a drawing of a seemingly random airplane. Castiel reads it a couple of times and pockets it, drinking his coffee with a smile on his face.
“Nah, it’s fine. I just function on burgers and half-assed meat. If it’s something fancy you’re planning to serve at the party, it’s better that you make the calls.”
Castiel says nothing. He tries to look Charlie in the eyes, but she’s determined to get her story told without looking at him.
Dean scoffed. For a person who was seven, tops, this one seemed feisty. ”Hey hey! I'm being kind here!”
That had him busy until the next winner came, but didn’t bring him closer to his dream of something more dramatic.
“I was hoping we’d catch Zachariah before tonight, so you wouldn’t have to worry about that anymore,” Dean starts. “There’s been resistance towards change as long as we’ve been in the business, but until now, we haven’t been able to pinpoint the masterminds behind these operations. In addition to Zachariah, Crowley’s in on this. He might actually be in charge.”
They refamiliarize themselves with the first couple of songs from the Halloween set, getting a feel for each other’s energy and their overall sound. It’s decent — they’re not by any means a band in prime condition, but with a few tweaks they’ll make do for the bachelor party. It’s not a particularly high-earning job for them, nor will it reel in fame and customers. While they don’t measure those aspects when they’re putting in effort, they are allowed to get a little silly. Silly, in this case, means a couple of experimental songs, and after a short wrestle with Meg, Castiel scores the looper for a song, too.
It takes a couple of seconds of nervous breathing, but after that Castiel is performing. He’s trying to step out of himself just enough to forget to be embarrassed, and when that doesn’t fully free him, he reprimands himself. He has to do this. He has to do well. He needs to be at his absolute best to impress the people who hired him. He needs to bring in the money.
Apart from being way too familiar with their client, Balthazar’s obviously doing well. He chats away while they walk on the docks that seem almost maze-like. Balthazar rambles about technical qualities and details while they walk across the front deck of a boat to check out the interior. It’s nothing extraordinary, but it would serve the purpose; enough people would fit, and most would even sit comfortably.
Castiel bit his lower lip and let himself fall on the bed that was almost conveniently behind him. Leave it to university dorm rooms to be this small; he had almost no walking space whatsoever and most of the little he had was filled with clothes and books. He'd have to clean this up to find something to wear and this thought made his stress levels get into another internal elevator ride.
”That'd be super lame. To never have any arguments with anyone,” Chuck said. ”I'd be bored to death. Also, it makes me feel weird that people are manipulated by their soulmates like that.”
He gets up, puts on the light, and goes to look at himself in the mirror. A disappointment, that’s for sure. What if he dies here? What if this is the end?  It isn’t a self-destructive thought of
“Can I be honest? I can’t be in a relationship either. I’m… Sort of just coming out of something, and I feel I’m not ready to answer to anyone yet.”
As it would have been easy to guess, all of the rooms of the two-story house were stunning. Painted mostly white, the walls had invited in single pieces of artwork, some painted, some sculpted, and the dark hardwood floors gave enough contrast for the place to look like a home instead of a hospital. In the hallway upstairs, Castiel took his socks off to step on a large natural white carpet. He then turned to look at Dean, who thought it would be impolite not to do the same.
“Well, he was reluctant to admit that, but he did anyway. We’ll be in touch as soon as I get back to New York, and I guess in a couple of years there’ll be an opening in his schedule for me.”
Castiel tries to gesture Meg to please stop talking, because beach alone is enough for one day, let alone with Dean -- who apparently has become ten times more attractive since they last met, and if their last encounter was him quenching a thirst, now he’s in need of the fucking Pacific Ocean to slake it.
He’s finished with the tea by the time he’s done with the message and he feels anxiety just around the corner. He decides to leave his phone for the time being, and head into the bedroom to watch some Jane. She’s just about to get through with her school issues.
He makes a final round across the lower and upper decks, introduces himself to the bartender and her helping hands, and talks to Gilda a bit. Sam prances around the lower deck, seemingly nervous, so Castiel decides to talk to him next.
“Do you need one? I don’t think you,” Castiel’s sentence ends abruptly because Dean’s making him see those colors already, “I don’t think you need-”
“Yes, please. Also, take notes. If you need a pen and a notebook, take them, for fuck’s sake. I need you to pay attention today.”
Now, Castiel’s not that good at reading people, but he quickly realizes there’s still something unsaid. Sam hasn’t calmed down since his initial turn to awkwardness — he’s still tense around the shoulders, and fidgety around the hands. Is this due to the loss of his balance in Pitta?
to come along to Dorchester. Castiel doesn’t feel close enough to the guy yet to simply ask about it the next time they bump into each other, but that doesn’t mean he can’t try to lure info out discreetly.
“I feel this inexplicable pull towards you. It’s as if I’ve had a dream in which I was so lonely… Until I wasn’t. God, Cas, I was so fucking lonely.”
Castiel’s not silly — he already knows how the situation played out in reality. He feels like a jerk for purposefully misunderstanding the situation just so he could get offended.
“If you don’t deserve it, you shouldn’t be bothered to think about it further. I can’t make your decisions for you, but I’d say you need to either stop thinking about your infatuation, or stop thinking you don’t deserve it.”
Dean nodded and rolled his eyes before continuing. There was a sense of warmth in his stomach that was hard to diminish now.
At first, Castiel hears the sentence and doesn’t think much of it — mostly because nobody else at the table reacts, either; but surely enough the familiar feeling of choking, of his lungs filling up with infected, painful air, is there soon after. Before he can process it, he’s up from his seat and headed towards the cliffs that currently offer the only safe place in the area — Kevin’s swimming from the sandy spot along the coast, and the other groups are scattered on the grass.
“Didn’t ask,” Charlie smiles. Castiel takes a sip of the champagne, letting it turn in his mouth just in time to see Dean not only moved closer, but is still watching him intently. Castiel swears Dean’s eyes follow his Adam’s apple as he swallows the champagne — and Castiel’s brain fills the spot with a thought of Dean’s lips on his neck.
“For what it’s worth, I’d rather have an exclusive blend made by you,” Sam says with an earnest smile. “I’ll even tip you. I’m eager to see if you really are out of touch or if you’re as good as my research says.”
Balthazar turns his whole posture to challenge Castiel now. He’s onto him, but Castiel’s not sure what there is to be on to — he’s genuinely worried about his customer’s satisfaction, and if he seems too eager, that’s just Balthazar reading way too much into this.
Since Castiel is free on Tuesday, he decides to get out of his apartment. He packs some coffee in a thermos and crackers and grapes in a small box, checks his gear, and takes the bus to Lynn Woods. On a weekday morning the reservation is not too full, but it’s not like he’d mind either way — it’s huge enough for him to be able to find a secluded spot if that’s what he’s looking for.
“So, I’m thinking fireworks here. Apparently, we’re not allowed to set off our own fireworks from the deck, but a representative from the boating company is happy to come to our aid. We have to feed him, of course, but that’s beside the point.”
“Please, don’t,” he whispered, and wondered why those were the words he chose to say. “Please don’t.”
First, it’s time to check his work phone. There’s four calls from Dean, which is a soothing thing — he was afraid there’d be 40 and that he had really angered him. There’s a message too, but it simply states him to call when possible. With his chest feeling cold and empty, he dials.
Somewhere along the line, he stopped falling and entered a state of constant, painful bliss — like he fell through the roof of Heaven itself. The longer he thinks about it, the more certain he becomes; but at the same time, it’s both confusing and scary. He can’t say for sure he doesn’t feel anything for James anymore, because he’s always felt like home, but the distance between them has never seemed greater.
”It sounds like the rain has cleared. I think it's best for us to give the fishes some space. That is, unless you want to go see sharks. They’re right up the stairs.”
He lowers his gaze at the ring. Why had it had such a profound impact on him in the first place? It’s not like he owed James his loyalty after he’d left; but the thought of taking it off had felt like erasing a whole lifetime he’d lived, and however much he wanted to forget that at times, he couldn’t.
“We’ve met,” Gilda says, “oh my god. I - Of course I heard your name when you introduced yourself, Castiel, but I never thought to associate it with the Castiel that Charlie has been talking about. It’s next to impossible and I - I guess I just thought it’s a fashionable, rare name from somewhere in the eighties I-”
The surprised exhale that escapes Dean’s lips is delicious, and Castiel leans in to give him a short, chaste kiss.
A smile that Castiel didn't know he was wearing caught Gabriel's eye as he returned to the room with a purple-shaded dress.
“You’re tempting me with your words, but you don’t know what you’re implying,” Castiel says, but he can’t help the smile tugging at his lips.
The sun shines through the leaves, giving little warmth to the man’s clothes that hang on some lower branches of a birch tree, but at least the wind is picking up. There’s a couple of hours left before Castiel needs to set up camp and he’d rather do it at the edge of the forest – but right now, he’s stuck right here, sitting on a rock, sharing his food with a naked guy, hoping that he at least gets the irony of the situation.
“Apparently you’re going to talk. So go ahead. But there was no accident. I fucking checked. I thought something had happened, because I was childish enough to think that would be the only reason why you didn’t show.”
”This is confidential. You may not tell anyone what you hear here,” he says then, and Dean nods, mouthing an ’of course’. ”I… I haven’t read the policy Amanda gave us weeks ago. That’s why I can’t give feedback, or suggestions, or whatever they are wishing to achieve with the template webpages. I can’t meet my quota, I failed the bi-monthly already, and I’m well on my way to being fired.”
“My fingers are paper clips,” Dean says, and his voice echoes through the narrow walls. In this dream, the explanation is imperative, and Castiel understands it perfectly.
”Like I said, I’ve got friends. After Meg and I broke up, I’ve been spending my time with a couple of people who are in hard places right now. I’ve given support.”
She heads off to the balcony, and Castiel wraps himself in his trustworthy, nebula-patterned morning robe. Before following Charlie, he turns his focus to the ring; James’ heartbeat is solid and slow and quiet. He’s still asleep.
“So warm,” Castiel says encouragingly. “I’ll pay you to knit for me. Delivery time around next Yule.”
Castiel sighs and finishes up packing. He throws his trench coat over his dancing clothes and makes his way to the exit. He can hear Dean following him, and he’s about to snap at him for doing so — but then again, he was the one making his leave slowly enough, enabling Dean to come up to him.
“Five minutes,” Bartholomew continues, pretending to be looking at his fingernails. “Castiel, you know me.”
“Thanks for that input, asshat. Anyway, Castiel. Sorry about this. I know we’re not exactly being professional here.”
“You are-” Dean’s words are broken now, and his back is arching against Castiel’s hands. It’s a sight Castiel would love to remember perfectly, forever — he wants to remember every inch of Dean’s skin, and his breathing, and those beautiful, hot moans and desperate whimpers, and how each time that their eyes meet, Dean seems amazed by how good he feels.
And just like that, the instruments of the background tape become his heartbeat, and the nosy lyrics of Del Rey become the blood in his veins. His gestures are elegant, he makes eye contact with the audience that’s are either insulted or awestruck and his voice comes out with full force after opening it during the earlier performance. As the song comes to the second verse, he feels brave enough to take the microphone from the stand and walk around the makeshift stage a bit.
“I suggest you don’t think about your predecessor, nor mention him. At work, we have a policy of not discussing this subject. Of course, I have no control over my children when they step out the door. Still, under my roof, I hope that you respect this simple rule; I am not ready to deal with the returning grief now that it’s finally mostly out.”
He needs to see Dean soon, because if he wasn’t worried before, his subconscious surely makes him rethink that.
liked him. The guy was already a bit pissed with Castiel for never meeting up (and agreeing to get coffee once but bailing at the last minute), but of course he had to be annoyingly patient and kind and
but having already lived with him during college, that hardly seemed like the case. Besides, it would hardly count as a
Dean is standing a bit further away, leaning casually on a pillar, talking to someone. Their eyes meet across the room and Dean smiles. Castiel instantly gets a bit flustered, but manages to return the smile nonetheless. As he turns back to face Ruby, he still feels Dean’s eyes on him.
Balthazar wants to talk about clothing, and how much freedom he’ll have over Castiel’s appearance. Since Castiel doesn’t have opinions whatsoever, Balthazar draws rough drafts of wings on napkins, humming to himself happily. Castiel wants to argue, but he’s still thinking about James with hearts quite likely floating over his head.
Dean lets out a long exhale before carefully choosing his words. “I… I once dated someone with anxiety disorder. I had to find out stuff about that. I… It’s hard. It can be really, really consuming and hard to handle.”
“Yeah, I agree. I think it’s safe to say I fall somewhere in the asexual scale, but I don’t think I have a hurry to figure out where. Okay,” Dean huffs, “enough serious talk. Can we make out now?”
Castiel takes a seat at the bar table across from Eileen, who now stuffs new fruit in the fridge. They are still orange, little reminders of color that apparently still exists in the outside world. When Eileen returns her gaze to Castiel, he raises his hands in defense.
He remembers Sam again. He’d almost forgotten they met not only because he wanted tea, but because he was also interested in seeing them do their work. Will Castiel have to take this into account when choosing songs, or performances? He could ask his colleagues, but surely they’d say yes, because it’s possible that Sam is a future client, and he wouldn’t be able to disagree with them.
“I was really pleased with your performance. You all worked really hard for this, and I’m glad I was here to see you all thrive. Of course, the Star-Spangled Banner remains to be heard.”
“Ah, well. It's not like this is the first time,” Dean hums, and gives Castiel's neck a small kiss. “We do usually get turned down because, well, not everyone is tolerant.”
Castiel is going to be sick. He looks around for the bathroom, simultaneously pocketing both his phone and the damn ring. He can’t do this right now, there’s songs to play and people to please, and so, instead of letting his anxiety surface, he swallows it down. He
They’re going to need to talk soon, but until then, Castiel’s suddenly very interested in the conversation Sam and Charlie have started.
“I, for one, think you shouldn’t ask your crush out in a text,” Jo says with a shrug, not raising her gaze from the history book she’s reading. “Just say the words.”
Besides, he wasn’t good enough for James back then, so why would he be good enough for him now? No need to even think back to all those times he felt unworthy.
Luckily, a young woman steps in with a stroller and gives Castiel a warm smile, and the appearance of a customer stops his meaningless line of thought. “Hello there,” Castiel says, “how may I be of service?”
”Or he mine”, Castiel snapped and exited the car without waiting for a reply. When he met up with his brother next to the sliding doors of the store, he was already invested in his shopping list.
, ”I am perfectly fine. I can keep on a conversation by myself. No pressure. My costume is finished and my apartment's a mess and I want to escape life forever.”
Rowena places a card with an account number to Dean's hand and leaves. At that exact moment, Castiel feels his heart collapsing on him, so he shakes himself free from Dean's grip, mutters something of fresh air and beelines out.
The steel legs, powder-painted white, are individually packed for some good reason, and Castiel decides he’s more of use just opening them. Dean is obviously lost in his thoughts, and he’d also want to show his ability as a carpenter by finishing up the table.  Castiel lets him. He’s got nothing to prove here – they both know he’s better with taking care of the home after their renovations are done. He could let Dean shine with carpentry, and engineering, and fixing some old appliances. They’d found an abandoned fridge by the parking lot near the beach, taken it home, cleaned it up and after hours of hard work, Dean had also fixed the electronics. It was mint green and beautifully unmatched with their honey-yellow kitchen tiles.
When his eyes meet Dean’s from across the room, his moral pendulum decides to defy gravity anyway. Screw being superior to flimsy one-night-stands. Screw pretending to be cool with everything. Screw his stupid love-ish triangle, screw what Dean said at the beach,
“You alright? Don’t know your physical persona that well, but what I could gather from your body language out there, you were pretty upset.”
It doesn’t soften the blow. He wakes up to what might or might not be an impending panic attack, and the sun is up already and mercilessly pounding against his window. When were these curtains opened? He gets up and pulls them shut, which only makes the room smaller. He’s suffocating.
By the time Christmas was over and the days kept on flying by, it felt like the whole world had dullened into different shades of muted brownish gray. It was not like Dean'd expect anything to happen on the next New Year's Eve as he left the office. He was still certain all celebration should be cancelled. As he stood at the tram stop, clenching his suitcase tight against his side, he let out an almost desperate sigh. Was this how it was going to be? Escaping life forever, like a pigeon on those YouTube videos?
He was in an alright mood, although maybe a little disoriented by all the people he'd met. He still wasn't coming closer to the solution of the puzzle - instead, it started to feel like he himself was the missing puzzle piece. He'd felt a connection to all of the people he'd met, but it’d been shallow – like all of those people who had their birthplace in common would get along really well. Maybe, in a different universe, they would eventually even hang out. But now that the situation was this, it felt weird to think about bringing them all together.
“I’ve scanned through some old music and sang along,” he answers truthfully, “I didn’t know what you wanted, and I thought we could talk about it now.”
Just in case he’d forgotten, Dean reminds him that he is the most reactive person Castiel’s ever touched. His hands instantly clench on his shoulders, and when Castiel curls his finger just a little, Dean’s teeth gently sink into his lower lip.
“But I don’t do that anymore. I don’t have that longing I used to have back when I was new at this.”
It’s good weather to walk, and Castiel doesn’t want to push his luck by taking public transport. He sends a quick email to Tea Party chat, stating he’ll be back tomorrow, and soaks in the atmosphere of late spring. He’s got a variety of shopping options in regards of flowers — stores completely devoted to plants and gardening, supermarkets with extensions, and if he were to walk a bit further away, plenty of greenhouses scattered around the city borders. Since he’s already involving James in his plans, he decides to ask him for an opinion.
Castiel sat cross-legged across the room with some friends, apparently playing a game of spin the bottle or something as mature. As his gaze met Dean's across the room, he nodded politely. Dean’s stomach suddenly felt like it was filled with fluttering fireflies. This was
His voice sounded like this was a repeat. Dean didn't really need to smell it again, but he did it to humor Castiel.
“So,” Sam says, startling Castiel from his thoughts. “Do you think you deserve being harassed like this?”
The summer breeze coming from the ocean is warm enough to allow him a t-shirt. He’s almost late for work, but he stops every now and then to pick a plant or a flower here and there — his Summer Sale blends are not going to make themselves, and it’s still two days until the next delivery.
“I think it'd work, anyway,” Balthazar finally says, maybe for consolation, “as long as we don’t bring anything new to our setlist and have at least one practice together.”
As he takes a firm stance behind the register, his heart beats fast despite how ready he thought he was. He’s brought some items from the back room to make blends in the front, and for the Daily he’s aiming for a lavender-based white tea. Mostly, he’s doing it for the calming effect — he already put some lavender oil on the diffuser and it’s gently soothing him. For the first hours of the day, he’ll be alone. Meg will come at 1pm, and they’ll close up together.
Castiel has a question, but he’s suddenly hesitant. They walk across the slowly ascending side of the hall, and he tastes the question in his tongue — this could anger Rowena, and set their blossoming acquaintanceship on a wrong course.
So where does that leave them? Does Dean even want to see him again now that their business relationship is over and they’re free to carry on with their lives?
”Ready for legs?” Castiel asks Dean, who’s finishing up on the other side of the table now. Dean, clearly deep in his own mind, looks at him idly for a moment.
“Yes, I remember,” Castiel said, and there was a certain sense of amusement to his voice. Dean regretted every single decision in his life that had landed him here, ridiculed by strangers – and it was well-earned, too. This was a stupid idea.
Something just went through Sam’s head, and Castiel is dying to find out what it was. Does he know of someone close to him that could do this?
And he was glad that Charlie was available, because he needed a quick outlet to his feelings for Dean. Not bothering to open the conversation but typing right there on the screen notification, he tried to keep it short – emphasis on
Castiel shakes his head, although he feels warmth radiating from inside him. He puts on a torn black denim jacket, three different necklaces and countless bracelets and beads to work as his armor for whatever’s coming up.
”I was told that you'd be here”, Sam said and pushed both of his hands into his pockets before pulling out a transparent glow stick that was filled with glitter stars, ”apparently, you need to be recognized in UV lights.”
Until now. Now, it pulses with new-found vigor against Castiel's skin. He stares at it until his vision gets blurry. He sniffles and takes a deep breath, letting the comforting pulse of the heartbeat on his finger lull him back to sleep.
It had been a long day, and Bart told Castiel he’d reward him later with something he didn’t want to tell in advance. For the life of him, that was a part Castiel’s brain refused to remember. Instead, he remembered the bar now — it was mostly bathed in cold blue light, and the music was loud just the way music is always loud in bars. They sat in a booth, and some of them stood at a round table while they were drinking. Castiel stood there, sipping beer from a bottle, talking with Bart and Balthazar, and then a man came up to them — a restless-looking older fellow in a suit, his bald head shining in the lights. He’d given Castiel a once-over, leaned in, licked his lips and whispered:
There’s something about the whole scene that doesn’t sit right with Castiel as he goes about his morning routines on Monday. He can’t put his finger on it, and not even a jog by the beach can help with that. He remembers the mood really well, but it’s like something is completely missing. He stops for a moment to catch his breath and idly stares at the ocean. It’s right there, on the edge of his consciousness. Why is his memory failing him now?
”You wish it will be happy,” Dean snaps at Castiel. ”But there will be repercussions. You’ll assemble the cabinet.”
Castiel walks behind his friends, dragging his feet as he goes. When he lifts his hands to his face, he can smell the safety lavender essential oil he put on — and he has familiarized each of his bracelets in anxious situations before. Wearing them all, along with more rings than just James’, does add to his sense of security.
“Or I could, you know,” Castiel says, “practice the singing part here and we could have one practice, the final one, together. I'm not certain I'm ready for anything more, yet. I mean... I aim to come to work, but besides that, I think I need all my extra time at home, recovering.”
He lets Castiel do the moving. He can only imagine how important boundaries are for him, and expanding them absolutely needs to happen by Castiel’ terms. Castiel doesn’t really hesitate, though — he brushes his lips against Dean’s before pulling him closer and kissing him fully. Dean can feel Castiel leaning against him, so he squeezes him tighter with his arm, eliciting a beautiful, low moan from him.
Castiel shrugged for an answer, perfectly aware it wouldn't come across. He had once, half accidentally, seen a childhood photo of Dean Winchester – a black and white masterpiece still displayed on a photographer's website portfolio. So maybe he'd googled Dean's name and ended up there; witnessing
Something unravels in the man’s shoulders as he gets food in his system. For a while, it looks like he’s about to cry, but pulls himself together nicely before starting to talk.
"I talked to sam," cas says. dean grunts. he pours the detergent into the machine, leans forward to start the load running with his other hand.
what he wants is to reach up, tug on cas's collar, pull him down until he can kiss him, until he can be kissed. what he wants is for this all to be easy, but that's not going to happen. he'll take what cas will give him, and what cas is giving him right now is a look that dean can't quite place - somewhere in between longing and apology and grief.
he doesn't think about it when he's being thrown down a hallway by a couple of witches, and he doesn't think about it when he picks himself up off the floor, bruised and aching.
sam leans back against the counter, toast forgotten on the floor. he pushes his hands into his hair. “an uncle. you’re gonna be a
“you didn't give me a choice,” cas says. “you couldn't forgive me, and you couldn't move on. you were too angry. I left, but you didn't stop me. not even though -”
"i'm good with not talking," dean says, closing the hood and wiping his hands on a rag. he goes to scoot past her back into the bunker, but she stops him with a hand on his shoulder.
seeing sam and eileen happy together is great, sure. he’s happy for them, he tells himself, over and over. but he can’t be in the same room with them for very long before something in his chest squeezes uncomfortably. he looks everywhere for a case, and leaves as soon as he finds one.
“I don’t have many regrets in life,” she starts on a sigh. “making napoleon so short, perhaps. but none so much as what I did to young fergus.” she fixes dean a look. “you only have so long. fix whatever’s going on here,” she says sternly, “if not for either of your sakes, then for theirs.”
dean kisses him right there on the floor, and doesn't stop, even after he lets his phone ring all the way to voicemail - twice.
cas smiles. "if you'll have me," he says, softly. "besides," he reaches up, pressing his hand to where the baby's kicking. "I have a feeling someone wouldn't let me leave anyways."
dean's still stroking his face, petting his hair with frantic, shaking hands. "you're staying? you're here to stay?"
"jack," dean breathes. he reaches out, grabs his hand. pulls him in, although jack is stiff and hunched over. "of course you're staying. you're our son." he meets cas's gaze over jack's head. cas nods. "you're my son."
cas wraps both his arms more securely around dean and pulls him up to press his face into dean’s neck. it’s somehow both bone-crushing and overwhelmingly comforting.
cas gently pushes himself back, breaking the embrace but not completely letting go. “they were after me,” he says. “I didn’t want you to get hurt. I gave myself up.” he reaches between them, into his coat, pulling out a rotten-looking...thing. “I was able to break away and retrieve the blossom - it got a little smushed, but it will be fine. we should leave before it’s too late.”
"I never know what's going on with you boys," she says, "but if you ever need anyone to back your play-"
“babies can steal the calcium in your teeth,” garth says easily. “you should start using toothpaste with fluoride in it.”
“how are you doing - otherwise, I mean,” cas asks, gently, some time later. “regarding your - condition.”
they win their luck back in alaska, and dean feels the baby kick for the first time. and when they cross the border back into the continental u.s. from canada to a barrage of texts and calls from cas, dean feels something heavy inside him click back into place.
it’s different, after purgatory. the hostility is gone, but everything is still stilted between them, enough that sam notices.
"well," jody starts, "we could talk about why jack's not allowed to use his powers, or why sam and cas didn't seem to want you going through that portal."
"I think it's naptime, now," he says, reaching out to touch the cheek of the baby asleep on dean's lap. "but, after that? whatever we want."
dean shrugs. "pretty sure it can't be anyone else’s. still doesn't make a whole lotta sense, but he's the only option.”
“what?” dean says with some difficulty, considering the dental mirror stretching out his cheek. “I- how did you-”
there’s no one at the register - there’s no one left in town - so he shoves them deep into his pockets. the boxes are bulky, though, and he doesn’t want to have to answer any questions, so he tears them open and slips the contents back into his jacket. he shakes his head, locates the dramamine, and leaves, meeting the demon inhabiting the corpse of his son out front.
dean thinks for a minute. despite the stilted, half-there question, he knows what cas is asking. “i don't know, man,” he says at length. “haven’t really let myself think about it.” the whole thing shouldn’t really even be possible, with the hormones he’s been on for decades. not with everything his body’s been through since hell. “if i was younger, I don’t think i’d be handling this real well. now - I don't know. I don’t know.”
dean says nothing. sam turns to look at him more fully. he drops his toast, his face twisting into something like horror.
when he pulls up to the garage, he finally checks his phone. there’s a message from cas, which makes his chest tighten, and then when he reads it -
“kelly died when jack was born,” dean whispers. cas sucks in a breath, arm crushing dean further into his side. cas presses his lips hard into dean’s hair, and it hurts, just a little, but the pressure is grounding, solid.
God, Dean feels like shit now. Cas has been nothing but nice so far and how does Dean repay him? By lying to him.
Dean’s hand cards up to the back of his neck and into his hair. He tilts their heads more, his other hand coming up and running his thumb over his stubbly jaw. Cupping Castiel’s chin, his thumb on the corner of Castiel’s lips, he guides Castiel’s bottom lip down a little. Getting the hint, he opens for him. Dean’s tongue pushes in and Castiel takes in a sharp breath before letting out a low groan.
When she goes to make their drinks, Balthazar turns to him with a surprised look. Castiel narrows his eyes. “What?”
Dean lights up, probably too much, but he can't bring himself to care. "Really? I was actually just heading out to grab my brother and me some food too."
Dean straightens in his seat, elbows on the table and he stares Gabriel down. “Cas showed me a picture of his family at the club. I thought you looked familiar from somewhere. Didn’t even connect the pieces that you worked here. You look different in pictures.”
“There’s something I want...” Dean trails off, moving the tray of food to the bottom of the bed. He twists to his nightstand, where his clothes are folded. Reaching in the pocket of his leather jacket, he pulls out the sonogram Meg took. He turns back, resting himself against his pillow. He stares at it before holding it out to Cas. “Here.”
Luke hums, watching him for a moment before taking a bite. Gabriel seems to jump at the opportunity to speak after Luke doesn’t respond immediately. “Luke, how’s Lilith? Still up your ass at work?”
Dean’s heart sinks to his stomach and he straightens up in the bed, hearing those words come out of Alistair's mouth.
Dean brings his hand up and cups his jaw, his thumb working his lip out from between his teeth. “None of that, now.” He locks his eyes with Castiel and Castiel has to fight the urge to drop them. It’s damn hard, but he manages. When Dean sees he has all of his attention he gives a small smile. “I need you to listen to me, Cas, okay?”
“Just like that, sweetheart. You’re doing so good,” Dean says, letting out a sigh. Castiel’s eyes flutter open and takes in the man above him. His head is resting against the back of the couch, eyes closed, lip caught between his teeth, legs sagging to the sides, his body limp with pleasure.
Castiel hesitates a moment, taking the time to look in his eyes to see if he’s telling the truth. When all he sees is unbridled truth in those green depths, he lets himself nod again, but makes no move to speak.
He isn't dressed like anything special, or a bodyguard, but he's the only other person here aside from the secretary, the elevator man, the doorman, and Balthazar sitting on a plush couch by the entrance. That means he's his bodyguard, right?
Dean forces his ears to stand upright again and he chews his lip. "So, uh, if your family doesn't like me, what happens?"
The man talks with the pair, or, more like, Cas, for a minute. After what seems to be a moment of silence, and a lot of awkward shuffling on Cas’ part, the man reaches out and lightly trails his hand down Cas’ arm. Dean nearly loses it. He has his door half-open, ready to kill the kid, but Sam bodily throws himself over Dean. His little brother grapples for the door, and when he gets it, yanks it shut.
They talk about little things while they finish up their food, laughing when the other one says something funny, both of them trying to commit the other’s laugh to memory. The way Dean throws his head back and belts out a heartwarming laugh when he finds something to be particularly hilarious. The way his eyes crinkle at the sides and his body shakes with laughter. The way Cas will drop his head forward and try to hide his laugh, but he always fails and will shake his head and turn his head towards Dean, eyes crinkled, a wide crooked smile plastered across his face, a playfulness in his eyes that makes Dean’s heart sputter with affection.
That must have been what he was waiting for because he closes the distance between them after that. Their lips brush lightly, just a barely-there touch. Castiel takes a shaky breath in and surges in, his arms wrapping around Dean’s neck. He can feel Dean break out into a smile in their kiss and it makes Castiel’s stomach butterflies return.
I seem to be able to write more when I'm getting my hair done. I wrote a majority of this chapter while I was at the salon. I didn't want to keep you guys waiting too long, so I'm glad I was able to get this written. That being said, it isn't edited and I wrote it pretty fast, so there might be issues, but hopefully it flows well!
I don't even know how to say thank you guys enough for the support you've all shown me, and it's only the first chapter! I'm so glad you've all liked it so far, and are hopefully excited to see more. If you are, feel free to scream at me on here, your comments and constructive criticisms are forever welcome! Seeing how many people liked it has definitely made me want to keep writing, especially since I'm working on finals this week, it's been a real boost for me to read your comments. If there is anything you would like to see in future chapters, leave a comment down below and I might just add it in, I'm open to hearing your ideas.
"It is. I told you to come today because I was told my schedule for shooting ended after this last scene."
“I work for the FBI.” His oldest brother says with an air of nonchalance, but Castiel knows his brother too well to know that that’s what it actually is. He’s going to use this as a scare tactic. He can just feel it in his gut. He groans internally and eats his food.
Sam roll his eyes. Just to annoy Sam, he lights it and takes a deep pull, blowing it out before he cracks the window to release the smoke.
Dean runs his hands through his hair, his breathing starting to become erratic. He can’t tell him. He’ll kick him out or make him get rid of his kit. He can’t do that. He won’t.
Sam turns his attention back to his brother, slightly shocked at how genuine the words sounded. Sam was expecting Dean to make a lighthearted joke to lighten up the mood and tell him not to worry. What Sam wasn't expecting was Dean genuinely asking what there is to be disappointed about because he can't think of any possibility that there's anything to be disappointed over.
I wanted to take this chapter to give us all a little something we've all been waiting for ;) The boys talk, and progress is made in regards to Alistair. But I think a little romance between our two favorite boys was in order, finally letting them get their heads out of their asses. And a little fluffiness at the end, I hope you like it!
Coming to that conclusion, he adds a normal admissions ticket to the cart and checks out, cringing at the price it comes out to. When it’s all said and done, and he prints out their tickets, he closes the lid on his laptop setting it on his nightstand and heading downstairs to grab the tickets.
“Hey,” Dean says, still staring. He glances down and sees somewhere in the middle of the night Cas removed his shirt and put on a pair of pajama bottoms. That’s when Dean realizes he’s in a pair as well, only they’re not Dean’s. Dean feels his cheeks heat up, thinking about Cas replacing his pants with something more comfortable to sleep in.
Cas hums, but says nothing again, just letting Dean speak. They stay quiet for a while again before Cas says, “Why haven’t you seen him in a long time?”
Dean drops his eyes to the photo. It would be nice to have Cas treat his son like his own. He doesn’t want his kit to grow up feeling excluded and unloved. And part of Dean feels that Cas will make a good father. “I’ll try.”
“Hey, it’s okay, sweetheart. I’m here. Whatever you need, I’m here.” Dean lifts his head and gently kisses his hair before resting his cheek on him again. They stay quiet for another moment before Dean softly says, “If it means anything, I would have loved to have met her too.”
Dean snaps his eyes to the screen. "No way! How … what … when … how did she … Misha … I want to text Cas and ask him but I know he can't tell me…"
“That’s part of it,” Gabriel hums, sitting on a chair, his golden wings spreading over the back. “How you feelin, Dean-o? Kit okay?”
Sam narrows his eyes at his brother. “I admit I liked her back when I was in middle school, but I don’t know her anymore.” He shrugs leaning his butt against the counter crossing his arms over his chest. “Besides, she probably doesn’t even remember me. Hell, she has people probably throwing themselves at her all the time now and I’d look pathetic trying to contact her now only after I found out she’s an actress.”
on one of those in-between days, when dean expects he's near the end of both his pregnancy and the world, he finds himself laid out on the couch in the dean cave, head in cas's lap. ostensibly, they're watching a movie, but neither of them have even glanced at the television in the last half hour. dean's not even sure what's on. cas is looking down at dean, the fingers of one hand threaded through his hair, the other on his belly, and dean is looking up at cas, his hands wrapped around each of cas's wrists. the baby's been kicking on and off, and occasionally dean will move cas's hand towards the movement, but otherwise they're still.
“Yes. We do have churches,” Castiel holds that thought while he turns the soup can around, “but they’re mostly used for silent prayer, and some of our sacristans can guide testimonials. Our priest has mostly been taking care of the Mountain, a sacred place southeast from here. That’s where sacrifice ceremonies are held.”
“No, I can’t read thoughts. I mean I could – but I do need the human’s consent for that and I need to be touching them physically,” he pauses for a beat and lifts his fingertips on his own temple, “right here.”
When he gets to work the next day, there’s a tiny origami boat on his desk. It’s bold, almost neon pink, and has a star drawn on the sail of it. Castiel looks around and sees the top of his colleagues’ heads in the open concept office space. They’re all focused on their own work, keyboard chattering, and so he takes a seat on his saddle stool and spins halfway around.
“You’re in your head,” Dean says. He’s taken a seat on the edge of his bed, on top of the duvet, still fully clothed. Castiel is standing in front of him, and they’re still holding hands.
“Now, Cas,” he says, “I’m going to put something in your hands. You’re gonna tell me what it is before you open your eyes.”
Now, the phone’s ringing. His personal one is on his chest, and the work one is violently vibrating on the bar table. With a groan, he gets up to answer a number he doesn’t recognize.
He’s too nervous to check his phone. James could’ve lashed out at him last night after his disappearance. It’s a possibility and a legitimate fear Castiel’s struggles with, as he glances at his phone and flops down on his couch instead. He hasn’t sat here since pizza night, why hasn’t he been sitting here more? This spot has a view to the balcony and the flowers. His fuchsias aren’t big yet — they’re barely visible over the rim of the basket. Maybe soon?
“Thank you,” he says quietly, and that’s when Dean notices he’s still holding on to Castiel’s arm. He lets go and a blush covers his freckles almost completely.
is going on? How can James try to downplay what Castiel has been through? Didn’t he understand him correctly?
What was he even thinking in the first place? How did he get obnoxious enough to assume Dean would see past his anxiety and consider him a good person?
This time, it took Castiel longer to catch up with him. Dean listened to him scavenge through the house, until he made it to the bedroom he was in. For a moment, it looked like his luck had run out, but then Castiel decided to look to the en suite first. Dean slid from under the bed, tiptoeing towards the closet. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, he was running again.
Soon, he could feel someone staring at him from across the room and it took a while to pinpoint the culprit. A man stood behind the counter and looked like one of those people who would take you for a tour without your consent and make you pay for it. Even from a distance, Dean could see some of the color of his eyes. It was a piercing shade of blue, like the Arctic Sea or the moment before sunset in the winter. It was overwhelming enough for Dean to get lost in his dreams of finding his soulmate and telling them cliches about their eyes.
“Tell me now, then,” Castiel says, because he’s selfish, and he’s greedy, and he needs these words to soothe out the raw wound seemingly unrequited love has left in his heart.
Castiel frowns. How the hell did Dean pick up on that? Sure, there’s a lump in his throat due to the need to just yell all of his pent-up stress and inadequateness away, but hearing that through the phone needs some serious skill.
”I could visit, yeah. It's not like I have anything better to do with my time,” Dean said, effortlessly turning away from the sculpture he had packed along for the trip. It'd be only two weeks until Curator Mosby would want his new masterpiece. The more time passed, the more sure Dean was that he wasn't going to be able to pull it off.
Dean puts his hands on his hips and glances around. Their cart, filled to the brim with supplies collected from around the store, is idly standing next to him, ready to be kicked.
Castiel groans. His first thought is to ignore James completely and just get the shopping over with. James could do with a bit of worrying over him as revenge for being so tactless. Then again, the man doesn’t know he’s being tactless in the first place. No point in punishing ignorance. Castiel looks at sunflower seedlings first, and absent-mindedly takes a bag of sunflower seeds from the shelf next to them. He’s not sure if he plans to try to grow some on the balcony, but they are a joyous flower and god knows Castiel still needs his joy. After that, he decides to force himself off the trail of desperate, self-pitying thoughts.
Castiel hums approvingly and wraps his arms around Dean’s waist, effortlessly lifting him up. He carries him to the living room that’s now bathing in full orange and red hues of the sunset. It’s surreally beautiful, absolutely magical and as Castiel sets Dean down on top of the newly built table, they get stuck staring at each other. There, in their new home occupied with the patter of kitten paws running around, everything clicks into place. Finally, after nine years, everything falls together like it was never a puzzle to begin with – but a game of battleships finally finished, all forts and barriers crumbled down, leaving only the still surface of an ocean that went deep, deep and
”Uh, I’m drawing a blank here, sorry”, Dean says, his voice is concerned and warm but obviously lost right now.
“Actually, no. This place belongs to the Novaks. My parents travel the world for 11 months a year, and they left yesterday. I do have an apartment in town, but while I'm on vacation, I very much like to spend my time here.”
”I haven’t visited out of pity,” Dean says, sounding calm and collected enough to almost make Castiel believe him.
During the day, Castiel distracts himself from the call by thinking about deserving. He thinks about the time he’s spent with James, and the time he’s spent with Dean. James, for his part, feels like coming home, and even though there are unresolved issues he needs to bring up, he feels comfortable around him. Of course, in the back of his mind he’s thinking about meeting him as well — but is that something he wants to go through at this stage? He can feel another relapse day not far off, and he truly, truly hopes it’s not on the 4th. Pushing his personal boundaries by force won’t do him any good, and an upcoming relapse implies he’s not ready to meet James yet.
“Yes, yes, you can,” he answers, suddenly too winded to care how squeaky his voice sounds. Castiel kisses him again, moves his hand to the back of Dean’s neck and pulling him still closer, closer,
“I mean, I can do that,” Castiel says. “I’ve tuned it out since we first met, that’s not the problem. But either I’m tiring myself by constantly pretending, or your soul is louder than ever before.”
After Cas’ … breakdown? It’s been chaos. Dean has been living here for a little while now, and it’s always been rather peaceful. When he moved in, he was expecting some shit out of The Godfather, but it never happened. Instead, Dean had only seen Cas peacefully tending to his plants or reading files. He would leave randomly at all times of the day and have a lot of phone calls, but that was the extent of what Dean’s seen of him working.
“I’m fine, Balthazar.” He smiles to really sell it, but the look on his brother’s face tells him he isn’t buying it. He sighs. “If I need to be bailed out, I’ll come find you.” That seems to mollify him.
Gabriel sees Dean eyeing up the food as if it's his prey and decides to put him out of his misery. "You going to stare at it all day or are you going to go get some before you start drooling all over my shoes?"
Look at that, I'm updating a day early! There’s no Cas in this chapter, but I’ll make up for that next chapter. This chapter is establishing more of Dean and Benny’s relationship. Tell me what you think so far, I love reading all of your comments!
I didn’t necessarily wake up one day and think ‘Today is the day I’m going to start dating’. I just met him on coincidence and it played out from there.
"Dean told me on Friday that he doesn't want to be famous, and I know you acting like you two are good friends won't make him famous, but it will put a possible target on his back that he doesn't want. So please act as if he is just another contestant."
Sam shrugs settling back. “It was your idea, I stopped questioning your thinking a long time ago. You mentioned wanting to help the kids.”
Should he tell him? Hiding the fact about his pregnancy didn’t last very long, will he find out about Dean having a brother? This is if he doesn’t already know from having someone look into his past. Even if he did tell Cas, though, what would he do? His reaction to Dean’s kit was … surprisingly calm considering the kit is from another alpha.
The next day comes a lot quicker than usual, but it isn’t a beautiful sunny day they were all hoping for. Instead, it’s dark, cloudy, and a torrential downpour.
Cas glances to Dean for a second before turning his attention back forward. "Tammy seemed to think you seemed nice too."
“Hey, Cas, you alright?” Dean’s worried voice brings him back out of his thoughts. He looks over at his boyfriend and sees the concern in his eyes. “How much did you have to drink?”
Cas wants everyone to know Dean is his "mate" to show he's off-limits. And to be honest, for Dean's protection as well.
Dean gives a relieved breath and a watery smile. “Yeah, Cas, it’s me.” Castiel frowns, focusing on Dean’s face. His green eyes are filled with concern. “You’re back, you’re okay.” Dean pulls him into his chest and Castiel lets himself be manhandled. Closing his eyes is a mistake and he rips them open a second later. The image of the bloody man on the sidewalk staring back at him. Dean’s strong arms around him are a solid weight that helps ground him in the moment. His fingers card through Castiel’s hair and he hums under his breath into his hair.
Before Castiel can answer, Gabriel comes over, his voice breaking both him and Dean out of the other’s eyes. “Dean-o?” Castiel turns his attention to his brother and narrows his eyes at the interruption. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Dean finally look over at Gabriel. Castiel can practically see the gears clicking into place in Gabriel’s mind. When the last one locks in place, Gabriel snaps his wide eyes to Castiel. “
"I hope so too, this was fun for such a short endeavor," Cas smiles, making Dean crack a grin too. "But I'm sure I will see you, if not tomorrow, then Sunday at my panel. If you are staying of course."
Теперь у тебя есть причина быть дерьмовым на своей работе. Уходи, пока я снова не пристрелил тебя - Now you have a reason to be shitty at your job. Leave before I shoot you again.
“You didn't have to do that, Cas.” Dean hesitates to look over at the stove, nibbling at his bottom lip. “Is it chicken noodle?”
Dean only hums, smiling and takes a sip of his own coffee. He nods in the direction of the door indicating Castiel to follow. He does.
Today, however, Dean it’s rather quiet. A fidgety beta man came up and is now in Cas’ office. Dean is thinking about leaving the penthouse to get out, feeling suffocated, when he hears a gunshot and a man howling in pain. The scent of blood fills the air and Dean stiffens, head snapping to the office.
Dean stops laughing abruptly and Castiel feels he’s said something wrong. Not wanting Dean to draw away, he clarifies. “Why he turned out the way he did. Why he started killing people. I’m not saying I would do that, but … I get it.”
A chapter update on time?! xD I was really feeling this chapter and couldn't stop writing it and because of that it's like ... really long. Also meaning I could have missed spelling errors and whatnot, but I tried to catch them
Castiel chuckles, dropping his chin to his chest and shaking his head. “Sam was very nice. He didn’t put me through anything like my brothers did to you.”
Whatever he just said, Dean knows it can’t have been nice. The way the British man’s nose is scrunched and the disdainful tone he used when he spoke just now makes Dean want to hiss something smart back at the man.
Dean smacks his forehead with his palm and irritably groans, a little too loudly for public because when he drops his hand from his face he sees people staring at him in bewilderment. And just like that, Dean feels like an idiot. Just as Dean turns to get back in his car and hide from the world, he hears a little jingle and a door opening, followed by a voice he never thought he would be so overjoyed to hear.
“Oh, come on, Sammy, a little water never hurt anybody.” Sam narrows his eyes at his brother and Dean rolls his eyes. “Right, kill me later. Right now we gotta scoot boot and boogie.”
Dean is left to stand there in front of the cafe, thinking about any kind of comeback that could have saved him that wouldn’t have made him sound stupid, but he’s drawing a blank. So collecting what dignity he has left, he hauls his ass back to the Impala and goes home to avoid further embarrassment.
"I didn't think I was going to win, I was actually planning on purposely flubbing up just so I wouldn't because I didn't want people to think I'm pathetic. Hell, I wasn't even planning on playing until Sam practically threw me into it."
Dean nods starting to leave. "Not a problem." Anything to get moving and to keep Dean's thoughts elsewhere.
The beginning of the day is same old, same old. Classes are boring, students are rowdy and rude, and his brain is off in la-la land. He has tried to focus and is doing a decent job, but the longer the day drags on the more he is on cloud nine over last night’s events.
Okay, so Castiel really does want to be in a relationship with someone, and he is actually trying to find someone, but it is so difficult. Besides Dean is probably straight, judging from the reaction he had when Castiel said Jessica would be at the convention, which kind of sucks seeing he seems like a really nice person, but he will just have to get over it.
Inias is back a second later, sliding him his drink. “I didn’t know this was your kind of scene, Castiel.”
Dean sighs. “I’m gonna do it,” Sam’s eyes widen. “Later, cause it would be weird to ask him after we just spent the night at his house.”
Cas smiles wide and pulls Dean back in for another quick kiss, needing to feel his lips on his again. “I didn’t know you were a fan of
Dean feels a pair of eyes on him so he turns to see Benny smiling at him. Dean narrows his eyes. Now he just has to figure out what to do about Benny. If he wants to get money to save up, he needs to lose his shadow.
When Sam had told Dean about the show, he wasn’t necessarily interested. It sounded odd and he honestly wasn’t sure how Sam enjoyed it so much, but Dean will admit his quick judgment. Misha, the main character, is given so much life by Castiel that Dean was enraptured the moment he came on the screen, looked around, and flashed that big grin of his. If Dean were being honest with himself he would say his heart fluttered a bit in that moment seeing the intensity in those striking blue eyes, but he plays it off as if it was a completely normal thing, and not as if he had just formed the biggest crush on a man he had ever had.
Castiel narrows his eyes. “Shut up.” Dean hums, slowly leaning back in his seat, spreading his legs and watching Castiel with intense eyes. Castiel’s whole body feels like it ignites from the merely bubbling arousal before. Swallowing thickly, he nods. “I should … yes. Go. I should probably go to class … and all.”
Castiel is in charge of cooking with Gabriel, like always. Michael is on dish duty, and Balthazar and Luke are on prep. It wouldn't be so bad if Gabriel and Balthazar wouldn't make a mess.
“You’re gonna need the special, aren’t you.” He says this as a statement more than a question because he already knows the answer. “I don’t know how you do it.” Gabriel shakes his head and takes Dean’s money.
Sam looks like he wants to say something, rolling his bottle in his hands. Dean stays quiet, letting him think. He doesn’t have to wait long though before Sam is talking again.
"Sure is," Gabriel chimes, going to take another drink of Castiel's coffee, but Castiel swipes it before him and slowly sips on it. He sees Gabriel pout and Dean gives the tiniest of smirks. "Family is important to us." Gabriel finishes, eyeing the drink before looking back at Dean.
Dean pulls into the driveway and puts his car in park, making his way to the door. He isn’t sure if Sam is home already or not because Dean doesn’t know how mock trials work or how long they take, so when he opens the door and sees Sam’s sneakers laying there he is a bit surprised. Dean hangs his things up and kicks off his shoes peeking his head around the corner of the kitchen to see if Sam is there before walking in and over to the fridge. Sam must be in his room.
