“That’s… not great, but I mean-- You know what, we’re not doing this.”
“He is. My favorite person. I don’t think that can change. Although of course as Jack is a helpless infant who needs protecting from powerful forces of evil, I was forced to prioritize him, and I am certainly very fond of him also. I… feel very paternal sometimes, with him. But Dean… Dean taught me a great deal, about what I could be… what I am.”
“And you’ll get it.” Chuck says, touches his shoulder and sends him tumbling through the shaky chalk line between realities.
Dean’s stomach twists. He won’t, he realizes, without permission, he won’t if Dean doesn’t ask, for all the things he can see in him he isn’t sure of this, but he has to want it, doesn’t he?
.” Sam yells at the ceiling. “That’s not the rules we agreed on, you asshole--”
“Dean-- he’s still in there?” Sam steps in closer to both of them, and when Dean turns to him, it
“Like a massive dick, but he picked me up, Sam! Like I weigh nothing! What was I supposed to do?”
, and now they’re
“What year?” Cas asks.
The immediate look of guilt that makes itself at home on Cas’ face is almost childlike, broad and obvious.
He snaps his fingers and they’re in his… office, or viewing room, or… well, whatever he wants to call it. Sleek and eerie, with a wall of screens. Sam’s on one of them, but it’s the Sam of twenty-six or twenty-seven, playing pool in some bar. Another screen lights up, the chess game from The Seventh Seal. Another, Bill and Ted challenging Death to a game of Twister. A couple other screens light up with scenes Sam doesn’t recognize, one lights up with a scene he does-- himself, again, poker this time, and unlike the pool game, that was life-or-death stakes.
“Yes, preferable to the jar, I know.” He nods, his tone conversational. “You didn’t care for the strained carrots from the Gerber corporation, I recall the complaints, but for the record this is also a carrot. Remarkable that it provides such a different experience, but this one was cooked with red meat, and I do believe that makes some difference. Dean made this. Dean went out and got you a play pen, which will paradoxically allow you far more freedom. Please don’t-- Jack, please don’t put your hand up my nose, we’ve had this discussion before several times, it is not sanitary nor do I appreciate it. I accept that the concept of sanitation is beyond you at this point, but please think about not doing it on the basis that it is uncomfortable for me, the owner of the nose.”
“I’m never talking to him again. He might be low on angel mojo, but I’m pretty sure he can still kill me with a look.”
“I don’t know. I have not had ‘friends’ before.”
“She wanted your blood for a ritual.” Cas allows Dean to sag against him, brings one arm up to steady him. An invisible force nudges Sam back half a step. “I could not allow it. But I see you’re all right…”
“Dean’s not disappointed with you.”
“Yes. I understood that he feared bringing Lucifer into our orbit and exposing you to him, but I still had hope. When I agreed to take Jack, I was so sure that he wouldn’t be able to refuse… not if he saw him, held him…” Cas hangs his head, Sam spots a tear welling up, just one, rolling down his cheek. It feels wrong, seeing him cry. He hadn’t, in the video of the fight. He’d gotten angry and then he’d gotten cold and self-righteous and then he’d gone. “I missed this place.”
The nipples are still about where he’d expect them to be if he was going to wake up boobless. They still have the same amount of sensation, which… nice, but a gas station bathroom he’d just broken into to wash grave dirt off himself isn’t the ideal place to experiment in depth with that.
“Sammy’s having an off day.” Dean says, and when he’s gently cuffed upside the head, he laughs like it’s an affectionate in-joke, not a warning to shape the hell up. “Hey, I’m the good son!”
.” He growls, and with a tug Dean knows is effortless on his part, he has their bodies pressed together. For a moment it’s just the touch of his hand, almost light on Dean’s back now, that holds them together. That and some force as inexorable as gravity and twice as strong, that keeps Dean’s beating heart from pulling back when he can hear the hammer of Cas’ own against him. And then Cas’ other arm is around his shoulders, pulling him into a crushing embrace. Cas’ face is tucked in against Dean’s neck, he breathes in deep and there’s the faintest tremor to it.
“We’re clearly not wanted here. Do I want to poke around traumatizing a bunch of kids? No. We-- we can still make it to Spike and Rail. Because if-- if we were supposed to find this place, then we’d have been here a long time ago. We’d--”
“Were you hurt anywhere else?” Cas asks, clears his throat a little and looks down, and his eyelashes flutter just a little, in that moment before he meets Dean’s eyes again, and his are so earnest and so blue. He looks at Dean like he’s looking straight down to his soul, which is also something that’s been going on since the start, but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable anymore. It feels safe.
“Apologize for being a ‘stubborn, self-righteous ass-wipe’?” Cas says, mercifully with a note of good humor.
“I’m not saying we dump him in a cardboard box by the side of the road--”
“Oh, I gotcha, yeah. Hard to get a date when you’re on lockdown because the devil wants to walk around wearing you like a… Sam-suit.” He drops into a chair, grabbing a book off the library table and leafing through it idly.
He changes somehow, or moves somehow-- shifts in a way Sam can’t process, but is dimly aware of. Like a satisfied nod that his body doesn’t follow through on, like briefly sensing the puppetmaster and not the puppet.
Cas is steady enough and his posture’s good, but his first couple of shots still go wide, and he’s scowly over it, and the point of this whole thing isn’t to make Cas feel frustrated, it’s to let him feel in control of something.
his strong suit-- stuff like feelings, or thinking about what he actually wants. And we… didn’t grow up with a lot of acceptance. About anything. I mean, our dad disowned me for going to
“I wasn’t there for the Hun--”
Dean asks, before Sam’s time is up, before he’s yanked back out. Actually asks Cas to stay, without tiptoeing around it and trying to make it about what Cas wants or doesn’t want. He’s feeling pretty good about this, when he winds up back in Chuck’s office, he’s getting used to the idea of Dean and Cas
“Yes. He
not getting intimately acquainted with those until he’s got a motel bathroom to himself.
“Yes. Do you remember there was a boy, Jesse? I would have simply ended his life before he could cause further harm, but neither you nor your brother would allow it. Dean was so kind… he had so much empathy for that child, you both did. I thought, when I spoke to him about Jack, that… I thought I would see that same love and empathy, but he was so angry. And so afraid. He felt so differently, when Lucifer was involved.”
“Okay, what the hell was
“Five minutes?” His eyebrows make for his hairline.
“Sure.”
“Ten years.” He scrubs a hand over his face, his voice a little weak, a little wet. “And this-- here?”
“Mm. You are remarkably similar. You are still you, just… different enough. I might not have noticed it.”
“I am Sam.”
Apparently there’s a response to that he’s supposed to give, because Dean just looks at him when he doesn’t respond correctly.
“Okay. Good.”
“He’s not that little. I mean, he’s normal-sized. He’s a normal-sized man.” Sam stares at him. “I wouldn’t call him little. Besides, he’s a soldier who’s been around longer than the galaxy we live in. I know he’s not equipped for the modern world and he’s not used to having… needs, but he’s not a lost kitten, Dean.”
Yeah. Dean’s not kicking that baby out of the bunker.
“You were romantically entangled with a demon for a while, when we first met. I do not know your entire sexual history, Sam.”
“I will be a disappointment. He will realize… I’m not what I was. I’ve failed him.”
“I am making this sacrifice, and whatever happens happens. It’s up to you, to save your brother. Get it right. Because if you do not… I won’t be there to help you clean up the next mess. If I return to your side and you have accepted Michael, he will put an end to me for my betrayal. You have one shot.”
. He doesn’t even look like he
, but there weren’t any magic words.”
“Don’t what?”
Dean doesn’t sleep long. Cas, predictably, sleeps in. Dean sets Sam the task of guarding him while doing research in their room, while he heads out to question witnesses.
“Well… I’m gonna have to get those calluses back one way or another, but, um…” He rubs at the back of his neck, and looks at Castiel again, really looks at him. “None of the things that cause me pain, huh?”
It was Castiel who seared his brand onto the Righteous Man, though he had not meant to. Inside and out.
“Where is here?”
When Chuck puts it that way, it sounds insane. On the other hand, it also sounds like what he’s been doing, whether or not he’s been aware of it, since Cas pulled Dean out of Hell. Every major turning point that’s led to their having anything they could call their own has been because Cas has chosen them, that’s something they’ve essentially got god’s own assurance on, so why wouldn’t he stake everything he has left on Cas coming through for them again?
you want.”
“Wait, for real?” Dean’s brow furrows. That explains a hell of a lot. Like how it’s always angels and demons who have them pegged as a thing, how they have been since before either he or Cas really worked their feelings out completely.
“Shit.” He gets the door open, looks at the two beds.
The scale is imperfect, of course, but the table still adds a certain something.
He’s not sure if he envies this version of himself or not, all things considered-- he thinks he’s done okay with the lot that he was handed. But he wishes Dean had gotten to be this Dean. The Dean who slept with his head in Mary’s lap in the front of the Impala at age four, parked outside a rest stop, Led Zeppelin for a lullaby. The Dean who took over making the sandwiches for all three of them because they weren’t being parented, but at least in this world he had a mother who would absently pat at his head and tell him he’d done good. Call him the man of the house, even if the house was a motel room, then put the baby in his arms and go out hunting, and…
“If you win, I betray Dean. He doesn’t know I’m here. I mean, that’s what you want, right? You want the big betrayal?”
Sam doesn’t even have to turn around to know Cas is there. There’s no universe kind enough for him not to be.
“I don’t think my eyelashes have anything to do with it.” Dean snorts, coming into the room, hair wet. “Although they are very pretty.”
between them, the doubt’s got room to creep back in and Dean can’t work his way back up, can’t just go after him and say what he needs to, or…
“No, not without assistance, your legs have stopped working.”
“Bonded to each other.” He corrects, and he draws Dean in even closer, close enough that he definitely notices the whole inevitable ill-timed boner issue. “The earthly mark of our bond has healed, but I assure you, to any creature of celestial or infernal nature, that initial bonding is a
He should have realized, honestly. Why else would the highlight reel have started there, with that change? She had the same eyes, similar nose, could have been from the same bloodline, through a cousin somewhere. She could have been from anywhere, she was just there for school, same as him.
“Yeah, okay.” Sam starts, then stops. Reality flickers, off to the side, and he’s not sure for a moment if what he’s seeing is the real or the unreal, but there’s a wide empty lot overgrown with weeds that
“You were just going to stand out here all night?”
“Sam, Cas wouldn’t
“What are they so busy with this time of night?” Sam rolls his eyes.
“What part of ‘nothing to talk about’ sounded to you like I wanted to talk?” Dean glares at him and shoves about half an additional donut into his mouth.
“Excuse me.” He walks back out,
He should act like this is unexpected, he should demand answers, attack, something… but instead he just stares.
“We can stay out of your way.”
“Hey, I get fiber.” He argues. Sometimes, anyway. “How do you know what fiber is?”
“Dean…” This time he barely croaks the name out, his knees threaten to give for a moment before he finds the strength to move again, and they’re rushing each other now, slamming into an embrace.
He can feel the heat fill his face, and travel down his neck, can feel it stifling and itchy beneath the collar. Can feel the sweat on his palms from it.
“You do, for now.” Cas drops down to one knee and starts removing Dean’s boots, ignoring the instant-- but somewhat weak-- complaint that comes when he does. “You’ve lost a good deal of blood.”
“My fault, I fear I offended him. He… he believes that I see him… badly. That I hold him to a higher standard, and that I feel pity for him. I failed to explain. I see all of your brother’s best qualities, but if I was to pick a flaw in him, it would be his stubbornness. He does not listen.”
“Cas!” He jogs forward, scooping him up. He looks pale, pained… it doesn’t take a genius to realize he must have taken off by wing after walking in at the absolute worst moment, didn’t even think about the fact that they wouldn’t carry him. They’ve been broken before, and still not as bad as they are in this world… “Hey-- hey, look… Dean’s an idiot.”
“Sam, please.” Cas pulls away, stumbling a little. “Once, I might have impressed him. I’ve changed. It’s fine, there’s no need to pretend.”
“So far, no big display of powers. It gives me hope, that I can teach him responsibility as he comes into them in time. Excuse me-- it’s about time for me to change him.” Cas stands, the moment before Jack starts fussing. “I think I will try putting him down in the play pen afterwards, to see what he makes of it.”
“Just… Earlier, you seemed like you didn’t get why-- He pulled me out of Hell. And now he’s been kicked out of Heaven. So I owe him. And I’m going to… to…”
“More than I usually know what to do with. Dean raised me, that’s not something I just forget about. Living with him isn’t easy… that doesn’t mean I don’t care about the sacrifices he’s made for me.” He answers, with none of the defensive anger he’d have held back then. “The real question is, what does he mean to you?”
“Oh, hey.” Sam says, as they move apart. “You, too?”
“Cas…” Dean grabs for his arm, squeezes.
“I mean, he’s still a good friend to have. Just maybe… explain basic nutritional needs to him. I know you’ve never willingly eaten a vegetable that wasn’t deep fried or on a burger--”
Well. That’s… Sam’s not sure. Harsh, under the circumstances, but not out of line for a stressed-out Dean. He gets out of the car, slamming the door behind him, and he clearly doesn’t expect Sam to get out as well.
It’s the body he’s had in dreams before. If he gave himself the luxury of imagining what he’d have wanted his body to look like, this. Him, just… streamlined.
“He pulled me out of Hell.”
out by getting carried in here like you were dying! I should tell him.”
“Yeah, that makes sense, I’ll ask him. The one he never answers the phone for. Not the guy he dropped god like a bad habit for.”
“Why not? You aren’t allowed to make friends with people you pull out of Hell?”
“Why don’t you just knock him out, if you’re not friends?”
, because even the most emotionally available version of Dean is bad at this.
.” He flexes a hand, stares down at it, and then at his cereal.
“I’m not actually sure. I mean, yes, but if this is me here, then this might be… you know, the same vessel, but…”
He has other concerns, at first.
“Making some quick cash.” He flashes a couple of twenties. Not a great haul for a night of hustling pool, but given the hour, Sam assumes Dean had gotten his four hours and then gone back out to some all-night place, too restless to stay in bed. Taken what he could find at a time when there were no high rollers to clean out.
Suave Fantasy Dean has left the frigging building, leaving only Slack Jawed And Half Erect Dean.
“I was never meant to
“I’m… yeah, I mean, I know you guys are…” Sam hesitates, sounds out the word ‘dating’, lets it roll silently over his tongue once before he finds his voice again. “Together.”
“Good.” Cas’ breath is hot against his ear, and he’s no less growly-- if anything, he’s gotten growlier. “Because you are
“Well, he threw ‘em and they hit the TV in the motel room, but you know. Baby shoes, the weak-ass arm of an eighteen month old… didn’t do much.”
“Okay. Well… maybe what you need to do is just… feel weird, for now.” Sam nods, helpless. He gets having weird feelings you can’t put words to, he’s dealt with plenty of weird, but that doesn’t mean he has the answers Jack needs now. Cas might, but… “It’s gonna be okay-- we’re not going to give up until it is, I mean. I… I wanna try and fix something, and I don’t know if I can. It means I’m gonna go out for a little bit, okay?”
“No, don’t-- I mean--
“Wonderful.”
if he is.”
“Mm. It seems to be a common human need-- to be known or to be trusted. For another person to put effort into your care and well-being. It is something he’s lacked. I will do my best, then.”
“I don’t think I can beat you. I think Cas can. I think… I think the idea that there’s only one world where Cas chooses us is bullshit. We’re his family. No matter how much you mess him around, controlling every aspect of your big ‘story’, that’s what’s supposed to be real. So if there are other versions of the world where Cas isn’t with us, it’s only because you took him out of the story completely.”
don’t want to ask it… Jess’ friend, the, uh… the redheaded girl?”
“It is
It’s cute.
“What happened?” Sam hesitates between jumping out of his chair and looking Dean over himself-- it may be another universe, but that’s still his brother-- or trying to research faster, somehow.
“Beautiful. More beautiful.” Cas murmurs, his voice soft. “Everything here is more beautiful, than anywhere else in existence.”
It’s cute.
“Oh yes you are, if you want your dang Ding Dongs.”
“Maybe… ‘s dangerous. He’s just… he can’t do all that stuff. Should just… try and…”
“Okay, well… no big, the important thing is you’re here and you can help us figure out what’s going on with Dean.”
“There’s no way that’s all I need to know. The highlight reel was part of our deal.”
“It was my honor to be tasked with it.” He says, but even that seems too much like acknowledging Dean’s inherent brightness and goodness.
, he knows what
“You find us another job, I’ll make some cash.” Dean says, with a heavy sigh, pulling the Impala into a dusty parking lot. The Tap Room to one side, Sam pictures a honky-tonk bar with a rickety pool table. Gas station to the other side, they can fill up and take off after a little rest.
“If that’s what he says to you, I’ll kick his ass.”
“It’s okay to fall short sometimes. The important thing is… Well, I don’t know what the important thing is. I mean it kind of depends. Being human is weird like that.”
“But if I were still what I was, he would be better.” He says, and he almost touches Dean’s forehead, he reaches out and then he stops himself. “I don’t belong here.”
“We need to leave. Now.” Dean’s voice says, though it’s not Dean’s cadence, it’s not
He’s reaching up towards Dean’s cheek, Dean’s experiencing it in slow motion, Cas is reaching for his face, is
“Staycation.” He shrugs. “Earned it.”
“No. You are better than you think, but I did not come here to lecture you.”
“I guess we’ll be making a meal out of… that.” Sam sighs. Dean… He couldn’t even buy a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter? Then again, he didn’t know this was going to happen. They were supposed to be out on the road, miles from the next kitchenette where they could expect to spend a few days making sandwiches.
“Come on, get in the cabin.” He sighs, slinging an arm around Cas-- mentally preparing to pick him up and carry him if he resists, though he’s not sure how far he’ll get if he tries.
“Like I was saying, didn’t need protecting,
Dean isn’t sure which one is making him lightheaded now.
“Holy shit.” Sam groans.
He’s prepared for Dean to do a little fake-out. That’s how it happened before, and… okay, and Cas got blown across the country and temporarily lost his powers, but if he sticks with them through this and Dean doesn’t become Michael’s meatsuit, it’s still in the bag.
The next highlight reel doesn’t look good. Cas isn’t human, but his powers
“You’re
“You are such a dick, you pretended to fall over?”
Sam may be unaware of the inevitable ill-timed boner, but he still groans and rolls his eyes, Bitch Face Number Nine sweeping over his features.
Dean gives him a sour look, but he tosses him the keys anyway, as they head back to the car. Pulls a towel out of the trunk when they stash their gear-- not to wipe off more of the gunk he’d been splattered with, but to lay out on the seat.
And a Cas he's pretty sure he can trust to stick by them, with or without his encouragement-- no matter how difficult this Dean can be.
“Like a
Or… maybe Dean bought the tub when he bought the play pen?
“Can’t do what to you?” Dean asks, coming around the corner.
“It would be, yes. You would like me to obtain the corpse for you?”
So now there are two less vamps in the world, Dean is fine, everyone’s back home… and Cas is about as stir crazy as a tiger in a dog kennel. He’s literally pacing around the map table while Sam is passing out beers, coat flapping behind him like a manic beige bat.
“Except for the one you left.”
“This is humiliating enough, the man smelled my dirty laundry, I can only take so much.”
Dean, anyway? Drinking the pain away? Shedding a single manfully repressed tear? Doing the broken widower routine in a dark hole somewhere?”
“You know what happened to the last family I could lay claim to.”
“So… if demon blood is corrupting me, what? Does your blood… purify Dean, for this coming destiny crap?”
“... If it would bring you peace of mind.”
, he doesn’t think. “Dean… Dean, I think I see something.”
“You’re a whole bag of dicks, that’s not funny. Just for that, I’m not getting you a beer.”
And then he’s not in the bunker.
“You may not consume my beer, Sam.” She cocks her head to the side again for a moment, and then uncaps and drains the bottle. “That would subvert the purpose in bringing it to me and not to you.”
? Yes, he’s reasonably terrified, but he has to admit, it was kind to him.
“Dean… are you?” He reaches up, finds Dean’s wrist and holds on, the only thing he can do.
, I know my brother. He’s a pain in the ass. If you didn’t like him anyway, you wouldn’t sit up by his bedside.”
“Remember, it’s a smooth motion. You’re not just pulling the trigger, you’re squeezing down. You let up after the shot goes off. Think you got it?”
It’s the indomitable human spirit in action.
“All right, all right. ‘When’ you win, huh?”
Okay, whatever did
He lets the conversation drop, and doesn’t say anything when he catches Dean’s head bobbing along a little to his choice in radio stations. There’s a pretty solid middle ground of stuff they can both listen to without wanting to murder each other, if they’re honest, and maybe in this world they are. Maybe instead of fighting over it they just admit when something’s a bop even if it’s not in their preferred genre.
him. He stares at Dean a lot, but it doesn’t mean his awareness is limited to him. Angel senses.
She raises an eyebrow, but makes no comment. Sam’s not going to be in this world long enough to actually face the vamps head on. Though now he guesses he can chalk Cas’ presence up to there being a dozen of them, maybe-- does this Cas drop in to help them if they ask, on relatively normal cases? If Cas was actually hunting with them full time, he doesn’t think that’s the point where Chuck would drop him in.
“Oh.” He says.
He focuses on winning Cas over on the drive, doesn’t lay it on too thick. He can’t say he’s done this before, he’s not exactly sure what he can say to convince Cas without being able to tell him it’s already happened for him and it worked. All he can do is assert his trust in Dean whenever the conversation allows.
Sam steps in, wrapping his arms around Cas. True, he’s had days with various other versions of Cas, all of them familiar in some ways even if none of them have been his best friend exactly, but this… this is a Cas so like the Cas he remembers from back when, ready to sacrifice everything for a shot at saving the world with them, and this is the goodbye he didn’t get to have before Cas went with Dean and they lost him to the Empty.
“Maybe we should call Cas.” Sam adds.
where you brought us. Yeah, I’m fine. You’re just a little punch-drunk there, pal. You feeling solid yet?”
think about. Not until he finds Sam and finds out what kind of deal he made. He’ll worry about what might have marked him once Sam is accounted for. And if Sam’s not answering his phone, or any of Dean’s phones, then that means going to Bobby first and asking him where Sam is, because he is not ready to accept that something has already collected.
“I don’t have ‘feelings’ for Cas.” Dean snaps.
Of course, now that it’s out, there’s no way they aren’t having a conversation.
“Y’ello?” He brings it up to his ear without checking the caller-- only so many people it could be-- and reaches out to smack Dean’s hand away from the popcorn, because he keeps trying to eat their decorating supplies, like he doesn’t have real food going in the oven.
something for you. Help you with something normal, or-- or just… do something because you
“Oh. Yeah, definitely. Um, we’ve got milk, yeah.” He takes Jack again, so that Cas can grab the things he needs-- a bottle, a little spoon with a rubber-coated bowl, a jar of baby food. Sam doesn’t feel super comfortable with a baby, he kind of misses grown up toddler Jack-- had its own challenges, but Jack could walk around on his own, speak when he needed things, use a toilet.
“Why not? He gets that choice. But only when it’s-- only when it’s safe. Can’t… leave him alone like this, look at him. You know why he passed out? ‘Cause he’s not used to needing to eat, or sleep.”
“It goes the one way it can or we’re all pretty boned, got it.” Dean releases Cas at last, stepping back. “You’re really ready to be m-- to be our backup on this? Because it’s gonna be another level of betrayal, and you don’t have to--”
“You and me both.” Sam turns to offer Cas a handshake, to say something more, but he’s gone again. Outside, he sees the shadow of a figure in a long overcoat blink into existence in the flickering light beside a semi truck, and then it disappears. “Yeah, good talk.”
“I have literally never thought about that.” He takes a swig from his beer. “So what, it’s like… half there?”
In the morning, Cas is gone, but Dean’s awake, sitting up in bed with gas station coffee and a monstrosity of a breakfast created out of a box of donuts and a microwave breakfast sandwich that looks unappealing even by their life-on-the-road standards.
In Dean’s better fantasies, Cas asks what Dean needs, and he just says ‘you’. He falls to his knees, promises it’s Cas’ turn to ask anything of him, because he always asks too much and he never makes it about what Cas needs, but doesn’t Cas have needs? And in those fantasies, the ones he does his best not to think too hard about, Cas has
“I’m sure. And what would you like to do about it?”
“I’m telling you, Bobby! If I knew… I mean it’s gotta be something Sam did.”
Damn Chuck and his wanting to pull a surprise, because Sam’s got no idea what this version of
“Holy shit.” Sam pushes himself to sit, a blur at the corner of his peripheral vision. Oh, right. He’d brought Sam to safety, too. Of course he had, it’s not like he ever would have left him. “I feel like I left my stomach behind on that one.”
“I guess we kind of have a history of clashing with Lucifer…”
This time, the highlight reel starts in Stanford. Jess has a friend, a weird and kind of standoffish girl, a little protective-- not the kind of weird and standoffish and protective where Sam thinks she has a thing for Jess herself, but the kind where the two of them just have to agree to coexist and try and want the best for each other, until Dean shows up-- Sam has a whole list of crimes against humanity and against him in particular that Chuck has to answer to, but making him watch Dean hook up with Jess’ friend is the one he would really love to kill God over. She’s not exactly what he’d call hot, not the kind of girl he would have expected Dean to go for, especially back then, but she’s clearly into him, and it’s way more than Sam needs to see, before it mercifully cuts to the next scene.
“You. You love me.”
“That’s… that’s all you have to say about him?”
“Hm?”
“I debated telling her the truth, but I was worried it might be… too much. I still hoped to keep you free from any… interference. I believe she chalked the differences up to the stress of studies.”
about
Dean hits up a drive through burger joint before pulling in at a motel, where he sends Sam to secure beds for the night.
“Not okay. You want to tell me you don’t want to get back all the people Chuck vaporized? You want to tell me you don’t want to save the world?”
Cas rushes for the stairs before he even has his land legs back, he takes them two at a time. Dean’s name is leaving his lips before he thinks to call to him.
“I think they’re sheer agony, what’s your point?”
“... I don’t really get what you’re getting at here. I mean, yeah, I’ve killed him off plenty of times, I’ve killed all of you off plenty of times. Usually in less than satisfying rough drafts. But it’s not because I’m afraid he can
“But I didn’t
Dean emerges without Cas, and after a moment, the shower starts up.
It’s a dangerous offer, given Cas isn’t bound by human rules, where stamina and refractory periods are concerned, and Dean’s not a young buck in his twenties anymore, when he’s worn out he needs a little recharge time and maybe something for energy. But…
to slow down his body’s ‘time to get banged by an angel’ train, without actually letting Cas let go of him and step away, because no one needs Sam seeing the aforementioned inevitable ill-timed boner.
“Makes perfect sense. If he says no to you, it’s not a big deal.”
the one who was lost, I’m the one who lost you. I lost you… Cas, I--”
“Jerk.” Sam responds on pure reflex, before heading out after Cas.
Cas lets out an amused huff. “He misunderstood me. I wanted… I wanted his help with something. I wished to-- I wanted to arrange something fair, in exchange for the favor I-- Well. We didn’t get very far into that conversation.”
“I am waiting until morning?” Her head cocks to the side.
“He’s out looking for a lead on these vamps. Anything you need?”
since he was just a scrappy little thing. But he’s always been private about it and Bobby’s always allowed him that. Seemed like the least he could do for the grub.
He takes a step closer, staring Adam down, energy crackling around him. Sparks erupting somewhere, but not enough to illuminate much of the space they’re in.
Sam finds Jack in the kitchen, morosely not-eating his cereal.
In Dean’s fantasies, that question has gone a million different ways. Or, it’s gone a couple of ways a million times. In his fantasies, when Cas asks what he can do for him, Dean is cool and he’s suave and he says there is something, he steps into Cas’ space, maybe crowds him against a wall, and he kisses him, and it’s slow and it’s deep, and he’s in control.
-DEAN-
“Dean’s not a part of this deal, so it doesn’t matter.”
“No, nothing like that. I just… I thought I saw something…” Sam picks his way over to where he’d seen it, puts his hand out until it meets resistance, and after a little feeling around in what looks like midair, he gets a door open.
“I mean, I care.” He groans, letting go of his empty bowl, spoon rattling as it comes to rest on the bed. “I care that if he’s… I care that I can’t
There are four lumpy packages under the tree now, where there had been two the night before-- both labeled in Dean’s handwriting, one for Sam and one for their absent mother. Since Sam didn’t add anything, he can guess the other two were picked up when he went out to obtain the play pen, so it’s possible the tub was bought at the same time. And even if it wasn’t…
on Dean, in a way he’d never thought about before. The middle ground between fed suit and grease-or-blood-stained denim and flannel is just…
After any immediate danger is settled, and after he kicks Sam’s ass as necessary for even trying, then he can figure out the new body.
“Wait…” Zachariah takes a step towards him, and then it goes the way Sam remembers in his own world, with Dean ganking him. The difference, he guesses, is that this time it’s as part of some deal with Michael, rather than Dean avoiding the deal in the first place.
“Maybe.” Sam pushes the thought of his own world aside, and gets up to do the dishes. There’s the sound of fussing and crying from the other room, but only briefly, as Sam washes and Dean dries.
“Well… that’s something the four of us will just have to deal with when we get there.”
“Next settlement’s the Spike and Rail. Hold it together and I promise… If the 99 holds out and we don’t hit any monsters, it’s thirteen more minutes. You can rest when we get there.” Dean looks up at him, brow knit with worry. “I know we’ve been on the road a long time. And if you wanna stop… hell, we’ve been going a long damn time, maybe… maybe there’s no-- maybe we just stop, and stick with the next group of people.”
Sam holds up his hands and takes a step back, leans against the Impala and watches Cas and Dean conference, huddled up by the door to the warehouse. He can’t read Cas’ lips, mostly because he’s growling and grumbling under his breath and not moving them much, but he can see his expression past Dean’s shoulder, the earnestness in those difficult-to-read emotions. The importance behind whatever he’s saying. The open despair when he shakes his head and presses something into Dean’s hand, blocked by Dean’s body so that Sam can’t see what it is. He can guess.
“Good to know.” He actually laughs, at that. Well, he chuckles. Under the circumstances, it’s good enough. “Look, uh, Cas… if you and Rosemary’s baby are gonna be staying here, I-- I don’t know what kind of baby shit you’ve got and don’t got, but I figure, you know, with all the weapons and artefacts in the joint, uh… I ran out and I picked up a baby jail.”
“Seriously, Dean?” He pushes it back towards Dean.
“I don’t want to live in it.” Dean’s voice is cold, hard. Bitter. The look in his eyes communicates about as clearly as he would ever try to say in words, that he wasn’t going to put this knowledge on Sam’s shoulders if he hadn’t pushed for it, that he was a cornered animal lashing out when he’d have rather holed up in the dark, and sharing this truth was a last-ditch effort to stop having a conversation.
“It’s okay. Dean’s… tricky like that. Sometimes things are just touchy, but he doesn’t hold a grudge against a friend for long.”
“Well I didn’t do a very good job.”
It’s so familiar and it’s so right, and maybe Cas wasn’t away long, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t feel long. It always does. More than that, it’s the way he says ‘from you’... like it’s not about being away from the bunker, from whatever the quest du jour might be, from anybody else but Dean.
Sam turns, and immediately forgets what it was he was going to say to Dean, at the look on his brother’s face.
“It’s good enough for us.”
“Yeah, yeah… well, I got some words for him, not that I’m sorry you’re back.” He rolls his eyes. Sam’s their best bet for answers, sure-- Dean sold his soul for Sam, didn’t even get the full ten years most demon deals will get you, it’s natural he’d be looking for a way to pay that back. Natural he’d be looking for a way to get
“Sam left some of your things in the attic, but… I don’t know what’s there. Least maybe one outfit that didn’t crawl its way out of the grave.” He offers, in the kind of gruff tone he doesn’t expect is fooling anyone. “Son, if you’ve got meds you need or anything, I don’t know if they’ll be in there.”
“Yeah, he likes to hear the first thing you say and assume he knows everything.” Sam relaxes a little. “But I mean… I know he’s doing his best. He doesn’t want me to lead the same kind of life he had to, but now we’re in this together, and he doesn’t want me to leave, either… it’s fine, it just… Cas?”
Dean gives a sound, a hollow, half-voiced laugh that’s just a hair’s breadth off from being a sob. “Sure. That’s what I need.”
They’re going over the likely last resting place of one Frederick Graham, asshole ghost, when the bathroom door opens and Dean steps out in a towel. Cas actually looks up to the door before it opens.
“What for? So he can apologize that I found out so bluntly, so he can say that he never intended to let on that he knew about my feelings? And then I’ll lie and say everything is fine, knowing I’ve failed him so spectacularly that that spark of feeling I once thought he might have for me is laughable now?”
.” Dean gasps, squeezes him so hard. Dean’s cheek is pressed to his, Dean’s stubble catches on his, and then he’s turning, his open mouth pressed at the corner of Cas’ lips, he’s sobbing through an inelegant first kiss. “I thought I--”
“I don’t think so, but he definitely got
“I just… It seems whenever I begin to settle, I’m reminded of my past failures. And I don’t think there’s any making up for everything I’ve done. And I appreciate the thought, Dean, but it would take an astounding amount of alcohol to affect me now, and I’m really not worth that kind of waste.”
“What the hell?” Sam demands.
Van Nuys even though it could be another warehouse for all he can tell, and he feels like he might collapse, or puke. Adam very nearly does both, but manages to catch himself on both counts, before turning to stare at Dean with wary disbelief. If Dean wasn’t slightly… glowy, Sam doesn’t think he or Adam would be able to see much.
“No. I am not.”
“I’ll be fine.” Dean sighs, but it’s not what Cas needs to hear, because Cas just walks out of the cabin. “Fuck.”
Chuck throws Sam a curveball...
“Brunette.” Sam shrugs, daring another look, accepting that it’s less obvious than having Deanna turn around in her seat. He doesn’t know what she’s into but he knows the information his own Dean would want to know. “Stacked?”
“So what’s the plan?” He asks Dean, keeping his voice low.
So tonight he’s not letting anything ruin the moment.
“He walked out because he thought he failed us, he thought we wouldn’t want him without his powers, why do you think that is?”
“Yeah, hence the asking for a miracle.”
Dean groans as the recorded voice on the other end of the line reminds him to hold.
“You sure about that?” Dean asks, before taking a long pull from his beer. Lips pink and plump around the neck of the bottle, and the way he sighs after he’s swallowed, the way his head falls back… He sets the beer aside and shakes himself out a little, before returning to the table to make his own next move.
Cas’ smile softens, his gaze drops to Dean’s lips, and Dean feels his heart rate kick up a notch. This is going to happen, it’s really going to happen. Cas is so close, is looking at his mouth and holding his hand, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t a little bit terrified, sure, but it’s not like they haven’t been dancing around this since maybe that very first night in the barn.
“Seriously?”
There’s a startled laugh, from the bathroom, Dean swears and then his voice drops back down to the calm and even instructional tone, he answers Cas’ question-- Sam can’t make the question out, but he can tell that it is one.
He could do it a third time and Dean would let him. Maybe not across the forehead. But maybe not not across the forehead.
Cas, the Cas who’s fought by their sides for years now, this is a Cas who barely knows Sam at all, and hasn’t actually known Dean for much longer.
“It’s fine.” Cas lies. “I understand, I am hardly his favorite person right now.”
He’d settled on a compression undershirt, which apparently is for some kind of normal person sport that doesn’t involve fighting for your life, like running or cycling or something, and then a mostly tight-fitting tee shirt, and then a baggy button-up, and then a jacket big enough to hide how everything else fit on him, and then he’d accepted sweat as a part of his life because like hell was he going to find out the wrong way that he’d removed one too many layers in front of somebody.
And he stops. Can he ask or is he already supposed to know, why Cas is with them on a simple enough vamp hunt? Or is it not as simple as they thought?
. It’s the first thing he ever did.
Which he doesn’t want to think about in this universe any more than he wants to think about Dean’s conquests in his own. And that’s if she even goes for guys in this universe, maybe she’s still into girls.
The more he comes down from the panic and the vague aching dissociation of coming back from the dead, the more he can kind of feel the difference. Not just that difference, but all the rest of it. That, too, though. If he’d woken up under normal circumstances, he’d definitely have noticed that he’d traded his tits for several good inches of dick and also testicles. The testicles are going to take some getting used to, actually. And he’s
“My time spent as a human was illuminating and disgusting.” And he mumbles into Dean’s neck with just the right amount of pout on it, disarming. “I know what fiber is.”
Dean beckons him in closer, before leaning heavily into his side, hand coming up to pat halfheartedly at Sam’s back.
“I see.” Cas nods. “Then I will remain until he wakes.”
“Does he have a crib or-- I mean I guess like… a bassinet?”
“Hm?” He looks down at himself. “Hey, I’m not the one who made the ‘let’s all wear pants in the bunker’ rule. But you know how it is.”
“These kids… how’d they find this place?”
After a long silence that hovers between comfortable and awkward, they head back to the motel, where Cas disappears-- not with a flutter of wingbeats, just into thin air.
“Shouldn’t have let him come.”
“It had not occurred to me to do so.”
the Winchester who came to ask me to give you your pet angel back. And I figure there’s something I could offer… Where
“C’mere.”
“I mean if the hymen was a full barrier, then how would that… happen?”
“He’s just a… he’s just a little
“That’s not what was supposed to happen.” Chuck grumbles, waving an agitated hand towards the screens and starting up the next highlight reel.
“Not anything I’ve seen bef--” Dean stops, squints. “Wait. These are… depression era hobo signs.”
“I don’t care if you have other options, if you’re in trouble, you get your ass over here.”
“Sam? Is this a good time?”
“Because.” Cas tilts Dean’s head to the side. “We are friends and you were grateful that I agreed to come with you. And earlier… was not goodbye.”
Castiel has never had to describe anything as ‘cute’ before, in his entire existence, though he’s sure that he’s seen enough things that qualify, in his time watching Earth. But Dean, so human and so fragile… who had already cast aside his shotgun when it proved useless!
“Dean.” And Cas smiles at him like they’re sharing a secret, and Cas’ hand takes his shoulder, warm.
Or, not mercifully, because they’ve reached Jess’ death, and he’s not ready. It doesn’t matter how many times he rebuilds his life, or what he rebuilds it into, or who with, there’s no being ready for this. Dean holding him fast, dragging him back, the anguish on his face when he realizes he can’t hold them both, when the girl he’d hooked up with, a girl he barely knows, charges in instead, and Sam missed why she was there, how she was there, the Sam in the highlight reel doesn’t even seem to notice when she runs into the fire, but Dean…
“Woah, woah, I do
.” He says, jaw clenched tight and brows drawn. “I don’t believe in a whole hell of a lot nowadays, end of the world’ll do that to a man, but I got this. I got-- I got, I pull over. And I park her by the pumps. And I remember what it used to be. I know it’s not much and I know you think it’s crazy, but it keeps me going, Sam. And I-- I’m sorry, okay? That life’s not better. And maybe we shoulda just stayed with the doc and her family back in their shelter for as long as they’da let us, or at the truck stop camp, even if it wasn’t-- But I don’t know, Sam. It was just… it made my skin crawl and I wasn’t ready to sit still and accept that there wasn’t gonna be something better. Maybe I was wrong.”
“Oh.”
“Often. He is uncomfortable with what I have seen, and he wishes I did not know him so well. I don’t understand this, but I know it to be the case.”
“It must have been about more than only Jack… Maybe it was a long time coming, I don’t know. Maybe I-- Maybe there are some things which shouldn’t be forgiven, in the end. I’ve made many mistakes, and I’ve learned all too well about where good intentions can lead you. But I thought for sure-- I thought if anything would cause this rift between us, it wouldn’t be an innocent child.”
for Dean, like, consistently.”
“... Change what?”
Sam groans. “Yeah, okay, get a room, you two.”
“You and me both.”
“No. It can’t hurt.” He agrees, taking a bite. “The amino acid chains which make up the collagen in the meat have broken down considerably.”
“It’s what we
“No… not just-- I feel sad, about everything, but I also feel
Dean’s eyes go wide, his eyebrows shooting up, his jaw slack. “You were… wondering that? You’ve thought about Cas moving in?”
“No, Cas, you shouldn’t-- Yeah. Fine. Do whatever you want.” Dean groans, turning and letting his head thunk softly against the doorframe. “If you want to talk about how I spent my night, don’t.”
“Cas,
“Nothing-- nothing, just-- um. Forget it.” Sam shakes his head.
“What happened?” Sam steps in again, his hand going to his brother’s shoulder. “When you two were facing Billie… what happened?”
Sam holds his hands up in surrender and takes one of the donuts, though he doesn’t attempt to do anything with the dubious sausage, egg, and plasticky cheese of the breakfast sandwiches.
“I am very vigilant.” He chuckles, though it’s quiet and heavy with months of sadness. “I never need allow him out of my sight.”
But he’s not, because Dean is no longer cradling his face.
“You have no idea the things I had to engineer…” Chuck says, like this blow-up is his masterpiece.
“Yes, in order to go unnoticed during the night. Humans sometimes find it disconcerting if they see me stand in a parking lot not moving for several hours, this seemed neater.”
“No, you can’t, you-- you get back in that car, you--”
beautiful.
“He’ll come around.”
“We’re gonna pull through this. He’s going to do what’s right. And… look, maybe we won’t win everything we want to and maybe there are going to be sacrifices and losses, but-- But it’s going to come out okay, I have
“Thanks. He needs that. I mean, everyone does.”
Dean is wearing clean clothes, which isn’t a surprise, considering the gunk, it’s just… Okay, the jeans aren’t weird, they’re just jeans. The socks with the bright colored dinosaurs aren’t-- well, they’re weird, but normal Dean weird.
“Didn’t go so well?” Chuck asks, the room reeling around Sam, the screens cued for the next highlight reel.
“My room doesn’t need--”
those clowns and-- and I don’t even
Weirdly suburban soccer mom, to be openly eye-fucking another woman from the restaurant bar, but Sam doesn’t say that.
“Not like fate-of-the-world favors!” He rolls his eyes. “I mean… you know, just a… little
“I mean, so you have to know that the hymen doesn’t actually have to break, right? Like, you
“Of course. Is there anything else I can do?”
“Yeah, a walk.” And she pulls out a device Sam doesn’t exactly
“The point is!” Dean places a finger to his lips, and Cas freezes. “You could ask me to do something that isn’t about Heaven, or Hell, or monsters, or
“It’s not the same.”
to be?
“He, uh… he’s got good taste in music, that kid.” Dean refuses to meet anyone’s eyes, tossing and catching the lamb.
Dean throws his head back with a sigh, stabbing aimlessly at his plate until he spears something, sitting back up so he can shovel it in, and for a while, they just eat.
“Oh, hey, Cas.” Sam’s voice douses the building heat immediately. “When’d you get back?”
“No. It pained you. And… it was not a part of your soul. Are the changes acceptable?”
Dean just hums, already half asleep, and after Sam lays down salt lines, he ducks into the bathroom, makes sure the water’s running and that they have toilet paper and soap. He’s checking the kitchen sink when Cas comes in carrying basically all their stuff. Not the gear they keep in the trunk for hunts, but all their personal crap and a couple bags of what Sam hesitates to call ‘groceries’, given that Dean bought them at the last gas station, but… well, shit’s edible. He hopes.
, you are going to think very carefully about how you want to word the next thing you say to him.”
And that’s when it occurs to him to check
“This can be done.” His attention turns to the bathroom door-- no, not quite the door. The wall near the door, where the shower would be. “I made the mistake of asking a personal question, the last time we spoke. He informed me it was a personal question, I did not know.”
“Is it better?”
“Do I make a habit of refusing you favors?”
“Hey, Sam.” Chuck’s voice whispers in his ear. “You don’t want to know what happens if you get three strikes. But as it is, I had to re-set some things. You’re going in blind, buddy.”
“Didn’t need anything.” He shoves his hands into his pockets with an easy shrug that’s not fooling anybody. Because if there’s one thing he’s damn good at-- after ganking evil-- it’s blowing his chances with Cas.
“I’m fine.”
“And you were worried about crushing that one.”
Cas’ hold on Dean tightens, when Sam comes rushing in. He doesn’t know what to do with how he feels when Dean squeezes back.
. But we gotta move forward.”
“Yeah.”
Cas turns back to gaze down at him, and Sam figures he didn’t need to ask. There’s a look of tenderness and sorrow that feels too private to be party to, no matter how many times he’s seen something play out between them, or at least, start to.
“Yeah. Yeah, okay.”
“Right, right, it was ‘poopy-pants’.”
earth that’s gonna clear things up for you, either, because this is-- it’s too big for that, okay? Cas is gone, and he-- and I-- it’s just a mess, and it’s too big. Got it?”
“For you to have pushed Brady out, you had to be there a while, how did Jess not notice?”
“Am I? I’m sorry to hear that.”
“Yeah, maybe. Still not thrilled about what we’re gonna do if daddy comes calling.”
“Yeah, you usually don’t. Uh, I probably… can’t talk about this whole thing. Pretty sure at least one of us gets zapped with lightning if I talk about what I’m doing here.”
“You give us Cas back.”
There wasn’t much of a highlight reel this time, either-- Chuck had just said that the life he would drop him into wasn’t so different from the one he’d remembered. Dean would be fresh back from Hell and the two of them would be on the road again, and that’s that. The highlight reel mostly catches him up on the case they’re currently on. It’s definitely  not the same as the world he’d just left-- a couple of petty arguments in the car, Dean back from Hell, back behind the wheel, and immediately lecturing Sam about staying on the straight and narrow, no sign of Cas and no sign that Dean’s ever consumed any kind of blood... It’s early morning when he jolts upright in a motel bed, to see Dean slinking in.
“You can start researching without me while I take a shower, right?” Dean asks, as they pull into the garage.
“I see. My apologies.” His smile deepens. It still barely tugs his mouth into a curve, but it fills his eyes. Warm. Knowing. “What did you need from me?”
That’s sure as fuck a thing.
Every time the moment breaks, it shakes Dean’s confidence. Every time Cas leaves the bubble of his immediate personal space, or worse, leaves the room, because something’s happened to spoil the building
“I’m going to get up and go over to the bar. Real casual.” Deanna informs him, sliding out of her seat. “What kind of clothes am I looking for?”
The highlight reel is different, for once.
“Dean…” Cas moves towards him, his steps faltering, his hand stopping short of finding the mark on Dean’s shoulder. “Sam asked for my help, I agreed to give it. That’s all.”
.” He whispers, his voice low, and Dean shivers.
“Look, you just-- you can’t get it, okay?”
“I do not consider a mortal lifespan to be a very long time. And I do not mind waiting.” He nods, giving Sam a smile. “I believe in time we may have a smoother understanding of each other… and if we do not, it is still worth it to me to have tried, for him.”
“I can’t-- After I just-- The guy’s an angel, okay?”
“Winter chantarelles.” He says, holding one up. They seem to make up the bulk of what he’d found. Then again, there can’t be much out there-- at least, Sam hopes they don’t get reduced to lichen and birch bark.
“Anyway, something like that. He, uh, he standing yet?”
“Want to help?”
“Mm, no, that’s-- that’s good. Sam was, uh, Sam was just standing, that age, had to hold on to stuff. Couldn’t really walk even if I held him up-- but then, you know. I was four, and that kid grew like a weed, so… first couple months of trying to teach him to walk I ended up on my ass often as not. Jack’s a little too young to worry about that. Just… wanna make sure he’s, um… developing normally. Normal kid. No freaky stuff.”
“No, it’s good. I just…” Dean smothers his face into Cas’ shoulder, before he can finish the thought. That he wishes he could still see it, feel it raised and shiny. That it isn’t fair that Cas can, when he can’t. He can’t see his own ribs, either, but it feels like a potentially weird complaint to make, all things considered.
“Last night you were all ‘Cas pulled me out of Hell, I owe this to him’, but now he runs away and it’s ‘oh’?”
“It, uh… He did it for Jack, and he, um… I mean it-- it doesn’t matter, it’s not-- He did it for Jack, and it came due. That’s all.”
Deanna returns to her nachos, which is at least one familiar thing in an unfamiliar world. Sam’s other self has ordered some kind of roasted vegetable sandwich, which isn’t half bad-- he feels a little guilty for taking control of her body before she could get more than two bites in.
“No. The Empty took ‘em both. He… he summoned it, because he knew it would… He knew that if it came for him, it would take her, and I… I’d be left behind. He left me.”
, if it’s ever really, really important. Who’ll cut through them with as little bullshit as possible and won’t needle him for wanting to do the same.
“This is the best I could do. And it isn’t enough.”
“Dean--” Sam jogs down the stairs, but his hand’s already grabbing his jacket.
“Okay, has it ever occurred to you that you could, like… say any of this to Cas?” Sam groans. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m really glad you’re actually talking to me instead of throwing a bitch fit and pretending we don’t have feelings about anything, but… you guys keep getting into these blow-ups where you can’t talk to each other, and it really seems like at the heart of it, you’re both complete morons.”
“How am I handling being locked up because I’m an apocalypse-level nuke waiting to happen? Same as yesterday, I guess. Sure, it sucks, but… world won’t end. No one gets in, no one gets out, safe. I mean, hey, we always got delivery day to look forward to.”
Cas shows up and
“Yes. I do. I’ve looked at all our options, Dean, I’ve thought about this. It would be nice to hope that we would not have to make sacrifices, but at this stage in the game…”
, and it’s…
Dean’s at the bottom of the stairs when Sam brings Cas in, and Cas freezes as their eyes meet, his grip on the strap of the diaper bag tightens, knuckles white.
“Why did you bring me back… different? From how I-- Physically?”
“Or both.” He practically moans.
“Did you try just asking him if he wanted to stay?”
of this--”
Cas merely leans back in his seat, watching Dean circle the table, examining the pieces in play, and folds his hands.
Suddenly, they’re in a completely dark building somewhere, Sam can only assume
Cas just stares, which… is par for the course, really. Deanna comes back with two beers, though when Sam reaches for one, she holds it aloft and then hands it to Cas.
“Why would I do that?”
“Oh no, that’s your bed.” He interrupts Cas. “You’re gonna sleep, like… really sleep. You’re a person, you gotta… This is just something you gotta figure out, and you’re not even used to crappy motel beds, so... I’ll take the cot.”
“Maybe if you’d told him you wanted him to stay instead of talking about how you owed it to him to take care of him, he wouldn’t have thought he was a burden.” Sam snaps, curtains twitching in his grip as he looks out at the dark skies and the pouring rain.
“Okay, put an angel in me.” He says, doesn’t seem to hear Sam at all, and light floods the room, light Sam has to shield his eyes from, and when he’s able to see, Dean isn’t Dean.
Cas didn’t just bring back enough for both of them, he brought back enough food to feed at least four people-- with donuts left over, even if you scraped the insides of the sandwiches between two donuts a pop. Sam’s not sure what the fresh-faced twenty-two year old version of himself he’s supposed to be would have said, he knows he used to eat garbage often enough when he didn’t have a more appealing option, but with a brain that’s pushing forty, he can’t look at that thing without feeling the ghost of heartburn yet to come looming over his shoulder.
“Understood.” Cas repeats, nodding. “Deanna would like you to know you are not as funny as you think you are, but I imagine you were not attempting to be funny.”
“If nothing else, he’s a fast reader.”
“Yeah? How so”
. But he got us the mushrooms, and he’s really touchy about not being full-strength. And I asked, they’re definitely edible.”
“I have a different vessel in your world.” It's not exactly a question.
‘this is what a dad wears’ way, not in a ‘covered with monster viscera’ way.
“Predator or prey?” Dean asks, going on instant alert, knife suddenly in hand.
She’s, objectively speaking, very attractive. Full pink lips, kind of a natural beauty… short, honey-blonde hair, a spray of freckles that add to that sort of spunky-cute vibe, and… very perky, physically.
“Hang on--” Sam starts, but then Chuck is slapping him on the back and he’s spinning through nothingness only to come to in that chain restaurant somewhere, sitting across from a woman-- not the woman he’d seen on one of the screens. If he jolts in his seat or looks off, she doesn’t react, she just reaches over and takes a french fry off of his plate, dipping it into her milkshake before returning to her own plate of nachos.
“Yes, it seems my accuracy has improved slightly. I am more comfortable with this, it feels… sturdier. Though I am still mindful, they have so many delicate moving parts… not like a blade.”
He shakes his head. “Bones that had never been broken. Skin that had never known scars.”
“Cas.” Dean cracks a beer open, stopping Cas to press it into his hand, before taking the one Cas hadn’t slowed down to accept off of Sam. “Cool it.”
“Like… chinos and a sweater set? Blue scarf.”
“I don’t think this is the right one for me.” He says at last, carefully setting the gun down.
Cas eats one-handed, the meat fork-tender, until Jack fusses a little, and after some bouncing and cooing, he mushes up a little gravy-soaked carrot and then offers that.
“Try and have a family Christmas with Mom?” Sam frowns. Apparently it’s just the two of them bumming around the bunker for now… He’s not sure where their mom is taking her down time from the old Winchester family drama, but Dean…
“Apocalypse graffiti?” He kicks at the car-less door.
“I want you to stay here with Dean. He’s getting some sleep, and… and he needs it, but…”
It’s not like he’s not glad. He couldn’t afford to have them removed, not just the financial cost but planning out a recovery? He sleeps in his car as often as he sleeps in a bed, at a generous estimate.
, flawed as I am, weak, imperfect… When his hand first met mine, I was
“You want me to… shoot firearms until I feel better?”
-- even after the dirty work of digging himself free, his hands are softer than he can really remember them ever being. And not only that, scars and nicks are gone with the calluses. Not faded, but missing, as if…
“The terms of what?”
“When Cas comes back in here, I don’t care how much you tell him about your feelings, that’s up to you--”
“Yeah. Well.” He swallows, and leans in. Turns his hand to take Cas’, stilling him. Keeping him. “I still appreciate it.”
“What?”
When he lands, Dean is… hauling something big and wrapped in a tarp through the bunker.
“Hinted around? This is Cas we’re talking about, I don’t think hints work.” Sam laughs, and then he sees the look on Dean’s face and he stops laughing fast. “What did you say?”
“I wasn’t aware you had standards
“Yeah. Yeah. Uh, thanks, Cas.”
“Maybe. Want to hold a kid for a while. I don’t know.”
as nice as Dean’s fed shoes, only he’s wearing them around the bunker. “What are you dressed up for?”
“Don’t, okay?”
“The date humans celebrate as Christmas is meaningless to me.”
“Yeah, but-- Whatever, just… Look, should we maybe talk about what was going on when I came in last night?”
“So after all that, you like Dean more than any human you’ve ever encountered?”
“If you’re the good son, how come
Apparently this is a question he should know the answer to, based on the look Dean gives him.
Dean doesn’t believe she’s coming back. Not before Christmas anyway. He wants to believe, he’s probably told himself if he does this and that right, she’ll just show up and be a mother to them. But there’s no faith under it, Sam can tell.
“Anyway, I need to get
Sam… Sam’s gonna ask Dean about how he feels. That’s no slight on him, that’s… good, probably. It’s a sign that the two of them did something right, because Sam turned out a whole lot more like a normal person than Dean got a chance to, and that’s because Dean was the one raising him. There was only so much Bobby could ever do, the times he had them, but when he didn’t have them, Sam still had Dean, and Dean was a cushion between Sam and the hunting world. He was a cushion between Sam and
“I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.” He shrugs heavily. “Anywhere. Away. Heaven cast me out, Sam. I’m not… I’m not good for anything.”
“Sorry.” He hangs his head, for about half a second, which is something at least. “I had insufficient coverage. I didn’t sense any particular distress or personal need when you called-- Prayer is much more reliable. The phone keeps telling me I have only one bar.”
“Yeah.” Sam nods. It wasn’t exactly a question, but he answers anyway.
“... Great.”
“I’ll handle that, just… just get here, ASAP.”
This Dean is kind of leaning into it, actually.
“I’m fine.”
“Your brother know about this?”
He’s not totally scar-free, though. Going over all the other changes and the one merciful not-change makes that part clear. It’s a

“... Yeah?”
“I need to speak with your brother. Alone.” He grinds the words out without looking at Sam, although Sam’s pretty sure Cas still
“You’re still my best friend.” Sam shrugs.
“Hoo boy, we have… a lot to unpack there.” Sam collapses onto his own bed with a sigh. “How much can you tell me about this coming war?”
“At this stage you should still be walking.”
“What’s the point? I mean, what are we saving?”
“All right… so tell me what you’ve got, that’s of any interest to me. Because I mean, I’m your god. This isn’t like laying down a c-note when you’re hustling pool, Sam, this is the biggest league there is. And I am notoriously difficult to amuse. And notoriously difficult to beat. So I’d really love to hear what you think you can do better than your god.”
