He had just finished throwing his guts up for maybe the third time when he heard someone enter the bathroom. It was Cas it was always Cas, he always came no matter what. Dean found it hard to find it endearing right now, head in the toilet. Kelling down Cas started massaging his scalp at any other time he’d find it amazing, but right now for some reason he found that insanely annoying. Then Castiel cooed into his ear “Sweetheart, I love you. You know” rubbing cycles into his scalp he adjusted his position so he was sat beside him on the floor of the bathroom.
Dear Castiel
And as always I'd love to hear what you guys think? please comment below and let me know.
“Alpha, knot?” the Omega asked
He’s standing up he’s started to pace the cabin, walking had always helped calm his Omega. Not to day though. He could feel the engines starting to get louder. A voice came though the miasma of panic and fear “Sir” along with the scent of beta “Sir, you must take your seat”
Cas just held him close until the tears had subsided and eventually he spook softly “Hush sweetheart, all is forgiven” and for the first time in Dean’s life he actually believed that he was worth saving.
“Thank you Jody, I appreciate the help” taking the offered hand and walking her towards the door, once there he thanked her again for coming and ushered her out. Once the door was closed only then did hear Dean vomit again.
Dispite cas Informing Dean that his older brother would find something to critique so not to put massive amounts of pressure on himself; Castiel or the staff of the estate. Dean spent most of the following day cleaning and preparing the house for Lucifer's arrival telling the Alpha "that he'd rather at least attempt to make a good impression than to at least say he tried" to which his Alpha simply half smiled and promised to help anyway Dean needed.
Eventually Dean’s pace began to slow and become erratic. Cas started to groan above him “Omega I close. I close”
The smaller man’s anger was overtaking his nausea he managed to stand putting even more room between them. Even though he Omega was literally begging him to apologies and show his neck to his Alpha, unfortunately Dean was a stubborn son of a gun. He pointed an accusing finger at the Alpha still sitting on the floor “I was taken by my farther and I was almost mated against my will” he paused then gestured to himself “And you still want this” the disbelief obvious in his voice.
Cas wasn’t that type of Alpha to take advantage right? Right?
Michael had just recovered from the shock realising who this Alpha was and swung hitting Castiel in the face square in the face, but instead of making the Alpha back off it made him smile. Blood running down his chin from his split lip “Bad move” Cas grumbled just before his teeth made contact with Michael’s neck the Alpha howled in pain. Cas’s Alpha joined it but his was howling not in pain but vindication; for he had found the Alpha that hurt his Omega. As he tore away throwing the blood of the would-be rapist all over the room only just missing the trembling Omega on the bed. Dropping the dead husk of Michael on the floor he ran towards his Omega.
Thanks skrsq for giving the kick up the bum i needed to write the next chapter. Sorry it took so long; had a relative in hospital bloody Covid-19
“Now Omega, what was this about?” the anger in his voice decreasing he said whilst looking deep into those green eyes. All of a sudden Dean felt stupid, he had tried to make Cas leave him by picking a fight and what?
After a few moments he rolled them over slowly so not to make Dean sit in the wet spot. His arms coming up to hold his Omega close he started humming into Dean’s ear. With this bout of heat subsided for a couple hours. With his full factuality returned Dean froze attempting to pull away slightly. Cas didn’t want to force him to be held so he begrudgingly let him out of his arms. Unfortunately for Dean his knot wouldn’t allow him any further way. Dean was shaking, but not from his aftershocks, but from fear “Michael” he voice was sacred and hurt.
his Alpha. Throwing his arms around him pulling his close and smelling him deeply smiling to himself, he was home.
“But sir” the beta started again. Cas held up a had forestalling the tirade that was coming “Miss. Bradbury will explain she’s two rows down” he spoke harshly and pointed towards the rear of the plane. A few minutes later they were up the captain had informed them of something, Dean didn’t care too much he was just happy to be held by Alpha. Cas spoke “See Dean where up now, do you wanna look out the window?”
Later that day Cas arrived back to the room, the smell was the first thing that set him off. there was a strange scent in the room that wasn’t Dean “Sweetheart?” no response “Dean?” again no response “Omega?” upon getting no response that time it sent his Alpha into a frenzy.
So what did you like, not like want to happen? Please comment and let me know
It was obvious to Cas what was going through his mates mind, he thought that he was Michael. That made his alpha scream,
Her question was simple and matter-of-fact. Dean spluttered out “Pup?!”
Benny huffed and smiled “Yeah, don’t worry about me guys. Gabriel’s said and done worse” then started to laugh to himself.
That was until he heard something that made his Alpha take note and get angry "no...no. Michael" he might not be able to fight the Michael inside Dean's head but he could reassure him. "My sweetheart, my Dean." He started cooing softly. Leaning down to whisper into the other man's ear "I'm here, I'm always here and no matter what I'll always be here. For you" that was ment by a little snort-like intake of breath "you." He continued "I will always come when you call, your my everything. My love. My omega" he finished his soft cooing and reassuring protective scent helped what ever was going on in Dean's head as the next words out of his mouth was simply a long drawn out "casssss" ending in a soft exhale.
In all honesty he didn’t care for its thoughts right now. All of a suddenly realised what had happened he had a panic attack that caused Alpha to have to bite him. Shame overcame him, he embraced alpha in front of who knows how many people. “Alpha I’m s…” he started.
“F, Fat, Father” Castiel started
Somehow Dean ended up sat on a jet sat in first class and it was a complete and total mystery to him – well that’s not strictly true they had packed and headed towards the airport – given that Cas was no longer under caution for the events that lead to Dean’s heat and that the conference that originally brought the Alpha to the states was over, well it ended 7 days ago but Dean wouldn’t focus on that part.
Dean was floored, stunned silent “Oh my god he’s such a moron, I’ve got to go to him! Tell him I love him and that he’s gonna be a farther” he said all in one rush, barely halting to breath he had a mission. A simple mission drummed against the inside of his head
Alpha’s arms came up and wrapped round him “Soon Dean” he heard in his ear “Soon baby”
“Yeah I know its just how do I tell my pair bonded mate that I’m engaged to someone else? And to make matters worse I think he’s with pup” he quickly elaborated when her face dropped “his Omega told me” they both knew that Omega’s only come out when the person in question was terrified or were so happy safe that they felt secure beyond words, Naomi defiantly didn’t need to ask which one Dean was.
Sam wavered the gun for a second then raised it again. oh
His inner Alpha was still trying to be helpful.
Sam sat opposite him handing him his cup of tea, Cas didn’t drink it cause apparently American’s decide to put the milk in before the water and to make it worse they leave the tea bag in. Sam became very awkward and fidgety not looking at Cas. Eventually Cas broke the awkwardness and spoke “I didn’t mean to challenge Dean’s Alpha, in fact I didn’t know he was mated”
Spinning on his heal “and you” again with the finger “When someone comes out of the house with a shotgun for the love of god don’t make it worse!” he knew he was grasping at straws but he was pissed and tired, but instead of getting annoyed that an Omega was challenging him Cas smiled.
He wasn’t exactly confinable, but Dean was content to be sat on Cas’s lap, Cas on the other hand was more than happy to holding his Omega. Yes he was slightly terrified. He remembered his Mother’s words to him as a child, when he first asked about courting Omega’s;
“How dare you! He was to be mine!” Michael roared
Balthazar though it’s going to be one of those, he rolled his eyes and sent a texted his men in their rooms a few floors below
Dean stiffened, he supposed he’d have to talk about it at some point. “Yes” he said without reluctance or hesitation. Cas’s hand became just a little tighter after that. Jody smiled softly she nodded then continued on with the next question “When Cas arrived you were in the mid of your heat yes?” he nodded “What was Michael doing?”
, Dean had called him Castiel, never a good sign. “What’s wrong with me?” Dean asked again so quietly that Cas had trouble hearing him over the raw of the engines.
Cas chuckled at that “Yes, yes we are. Now can we finally get home so I can take care of you?”
“Think nothing of it, but it is time to go I want to be on the plane home within 5 hours”
Cas knew that the next sentence was a gamble, but if it worked he’d have this gorgeous strong omega that he hadn’t stopped thinking about for what felt like weeks even closer to himself. “Now, we shower then have breakfast; and if your amenable I’m going to knot you in the shower sweetheart” Dean went still for just long enough that Cas though his gamble had failed, that was until a huge moan came from the Omega in his arms.
Putting the Omega’s last words down to instinct he thought quickly and spoke softly “Oh no sweetheart, just had a chat with you Omega as all” buttoning his shirt back up as he did so.
Meanwhile back at the house, Dean was currently locked in his room awaiting the start of his heat, had ‘taken’ – more like forced down his throat – them dam pills about 20 minutes ago so Cas had maybe 10 more before he heat would start and that disgusting knot-head Michael would come in and, and… he couldn’t even contemplate what would happen next.
“Farther” Cas nodded. Receiving a grunt in reply.
“Thanks, he’s my sweetheart” he said, though in truth he was only half paying attention to the rest of the theatre.
“Sorry.” Sam grunted.
“Cas!”
Benny ran in drawn by the sound of raised voices and fighting instantly apprised the situation quickly he grabbed Michael who shouted “One day Dean you will be mine” on his way out. Cas picked John up and escorted him from the room. Leaving Dean and Sam a moment to talk.
Lucifer for his part smiled devilishly at his youngest brother “Of course brother, we will come by later” he gestured to his two companions Lilith to the right and Abaddon on his left; both Omega’s he had acquired for as he put it
that was before he met Meg and that whole incident put him off finding a mate how times change he mussed to himself. He was exited for Dean to meet his family, well aside from maybe Lucifer he was
A little later on in the evening Balthazar was on duty outside the Cas’s room, the night shift was pretty easy Cas never had visitors past 22:30; so it meant he could read a book or surf the web. Apparently tonight was not going the usual night. As a man came running up the stairs stopping after looking towards him. Balthazar rolled his eyes great Omega hoping to get in good with his highness.
Cas’s inner Alpha preened his Omega was asking, something about that made his hindbrain swell in delight.
Did that mean he still loved him? Maybe he did love him. Maybe?. “Because I’m broken mess; because Michael and John” another tear trickled down his cheek. His eyes glancing away from the Alpha. That was no mean feat when the Alpha was merely a handful of inches away.
Soundly benny honked the horn at another car. Dean froze he didn’t mind discussing things with another Omega, he was more censured that this conversation in front of another Alpha that wasn’t his mate. Noting this Charlie quickly reassured him “Oh don’t worry Benny here he’s probably heard worse especially coming from Gabriel am I right?” turning to face their driver
Then suddenly just as the doors where almost closed and Dean’s hope along with it, a hand blocked them from closing completely “Major what’s going on here? Dean why are you here?” oh that whisky honey voice Dean almost melted. Jumping towards that source; totally ignoring the other man standing there. This time though Cas was ready his arms came down to hold Dean close hands fitting over Dean’s perfect ass. As the Omega’s arms and legs hocked around him, like a spider monkey. Then Dean tucked his head next to Cas’s ear slowly breathing in and out soaking sent Cas up.
Noticing that something had changed in Dean’s sent Cas slowed his ministrations with his tough leaning back just enough to whisper “Sweetheart?” concern obvious in his voice.
“Where Sam?” Dean rasped whilst he shivered some more.
Apparently Cas was not going to be reassured so easy “Dean, sweetheart are you okay? I was too rough?” his hands finished their survey of the omega, thankfully no major cuts only a reopened mating mark on his neck; pulling away well as fair as his knot would allow. He refused to make it any worse from the Omega.
Sam almost broke at hearing that he nodded and a single tear roll down his cheek.
Please comment & tell me what you think :)
Cas knew that look, that’s the knot me now look. “Yes my bossy collared omega, I think I will” he slid his trousers and boxers off in one quick movement sliding back so he was resting against the head board “Come here sweetheart” he said as he held out his hand. Dean was over joyed he stripped in all of about two seconds and was climbing up the bed towards Cas. The Alpha knew that this was going to be something treasure for the rest of their lives together.
“Yessss” the ending sounding almost like a cat pur, sending shivers up Dean’s spine and into Cas’s chest. Cas smiled and continued his ministrations “do you know any other words Omega?”
“Yes thank you sister I will” he promised her.
“Heggglegftggggmeeeggg”
“Please Captain?” the third one asked
“Charlie?” his voice was rough and ill-defined.
"This was a test, which I think we've passed sweetheart" cas said calmly.
“Brother” The blond said his smile not reaching his eyes.
Apparently that didn’t stop the younger man, he kept moving slowly until he could look Cas in the eye. A single tear falling down his cheek “Cas, you, you found me. I’m sorry I didn’t mean to write that letter. I I…” he stammered at the end trying to convey how sorry he was.
Eventually they arrived and to say that Cas had slightly over exaggerated was a monumental understatement! Dean had lived in a two bedroom house in as he put it ‘butt fuck nowhere’ now he was living in a house with well over twenty-five bedrooms plus sitting rooms and three dining rooms. Like what place has three dining rooms? Though he was excited to see Charlie and Benny again; Charlie ran over and hugged him where as benny gave him a coy smile and a nod. Apparently they were to be his security; surprisingly he was alright with that.
I know that this wasn't the chapter you guys were expecting, but i promise that Sam and Gabe will get a happy ending eventually.
Then he suddenly realised he had totally forgotten about his Omega’s pleasure a flash of anguish shot through him. That was until Dean let out a little ooooh of pleasure. “That feel good my omega?” he murmured into Dean’s ear, the Omega nodded violently. “Bet this’ll feel better” he moved slowly outwards until he was almost out of Dean just the head holding the Omega’s hole open. Then slammed back in hard, jolting Dean forward the Omega crying out in pure pleasure his inner walls spasmed around Cas’s length; pleasure shooting up Cas’s spine
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi Dean, call me Charlie” the Omega smiled and offered her hand to Dean, he smiled and took it. She was happy and smiley definitely what he needed right now and to bot she was also an Omega meaning that Dean could ask about how the British expect their Omega’s to behave.
“So why tell…I swear of all my children you are the smartest and stupidest I have” Chuck was smiling and making a joke, now, seriously of all the times. Suffice to say that drove Castiel’s Alpha even more up the wall
“Okay Alpha, go save lives” Dean said to the retreating alpha. He definitely didn’t watch Cass’s ass as he walked away. In fact he was so pre occupied that he didn’t notice Charlie come up next to him and throw an arm around him.
“I need” he groaned pushing his head further into the pillow, simultaneously hiding the blush on his cheeks and pushing his ass even higher up into the air. A blush that he knew without a shadow of a doubt, that Cas knew was there. That thought pushed his cheeks further towards the red.
“Oh thanks Cass” Dean smiled cheeks blushing “Well you gotta stay for dinner”

Despite how adorable it was to be cleaned by Dean Cas was not going to let him get away without talking about it, “Dean” he rumbled he voice a little lower telling the omega that his Alpha wasn’t going to distracted. Dean paused pulled back looked Cas in the eyes and spoke perhaps a little too quickly, but it was from the heart and that’s what Cas wanted “It was amazing okay. I had you” then he went back to cleaning his Alpha’s neck.
“Okay babe” Dean said as Cas left.
Once he notice his Alpha was awake and watching him Dean smiled and grabbed the spoon from the soap he was making “eee Alpha! try it, try it pleeeeeeeease!” he eyes so full of hope of pleasing his mate. He held up the spoon to the Alpha who smiled and lent down “Okay, okay sweetheart” he said before taking a mouthful, instantly his mouth flooded with the liquid it was a little bland if he was being honest, but, the look in his Omega’s eyes beheld such hope and anticipation that he’d have a heart of ash to crush it.
Dean headed towards his old house, the walk would give him time to think how to explain the move to Sammy. What he didn’t notice was that there was a car following him. He turned down a side street only about 5 minutes away from his old home and 45 away from the hotel. When suddenly he was in the back of the car.
“Oh shut it, we’ve got a life to save. Have we not” he shot back, getting them back to work
“Cas!” he and his Omega, cried out as he came down to kiss his Alpha’s forehead.
Opening his eyes he could see why now, Cas’s mating gland had been punctured. He had bitten his alpha, quite literally His alpha. Averting his eyes not wanting to see the disappointment written across Cas’s face he silently chastised himself.
“Lucifer” Cas responded equally as cold.
“Castiel, you know as well as I your mother would never force you to go through with that, it was purely to ensure an heir; which we certainly do not need from you now” great even his Dad knew Dean was with pup, at this point the Omega’s going to be the last one in the country to find out and he’s the one carrying it.
Dean barely heard the conversation that was until Alastair’s voice rose higher “Excuse me?! How dear you tell me how to treat my Omega” he whimpered, there was no way in hell he wanted to be this asshole’s Omega.
After finishing his mouthful Dean tried to respond “I, I, I don’t know” he looked up trying to convey with his eyes that he needs his Alpha. Cas moved over kneeling down so he could look up into his perfect mate’s eyes , blue locking with green “Okay Sweetheart, I know you have a tendency to over think things sometimes, so I will make it easy for you. I am a world renowned cardiothoracic surgeon I can work anywhere” he said all without breaking eye contact and rubbing small cycles on Dean’s knee.
“Now get to bed it’s too early to be braking through all this”
“Omega Paramour” Cas corrected. Jody paused a look of query on her face. Turning to his mate Cas spoke again “You’re the Omega Paramour now, after your heat and since we’re bonded” Dean smiled; he filing that away for the future, something tells him it’ll be important later. His concentration was broken when Jody coughed “Sorry, but that answers the question if you two mated” Dean smiled, he never thought he’d enjoy being mated to anyone. But Cas was something different he was, well he was Cas.
“Okay sweetheart, I’ve got a couple more seminars should be done by midday” they hugged and headed towards the door the guards where off packing, it was the last day after all, everyone was ready to head home. They entering the elevator, one heading towards the conference floor the other to the lobby. When Cas’s floor approached he turned and gave Dean one last hug and a kiss on his forehead “Okay I will see you soon sweetheart”
Cas’s eyes instantly flicked up to the women sat opposite “He, was on top on Dean” he growled out, well he didn’t his Alpha did.
“Casssssssss” this time it sounded a little broken and wanton
“No, he is his own and he gave himself to me. Unlike you I did not try to take. Now you two are leaving as you are upsetting my mate.” Cas was rather eloquent when he tried to be.
Turning his head towards the Alpha, Castiel saw that inside his eyes he was scared and worried, like he had been that night he came to his hotel room. Dean swallowed hard and spoke “I saw the email from Lucifer” but before Cas could comment he continued “I woke up when you were asleep” the omega explained.
“Forever and always sweetheart” Cas coded into his ear “Forever” to the now sleeping Omega.
Dean groaned once more, as Cas licked across his tight hole he felt the instant need for more yet again. That need crystallised his voice inside him “Castiel, you will put that knot so deep inside me your need one of your Doctor friends to remove it. NOW!” but before he could continue the Alpha lined his already rock hard cock up with his hole and sank home. The movement made him jump though he couldn’t go far Cas had one hand firmly around his collar the other was still pushing his chest to the bed. “Oh my god, I forget how big you are sometimes” the smaller Omega managed to mumble out once the Alpha was fully sheathed.
Immediately after hanging up with her younger brother Naomi turned to her head of security Zachariah “Zach, we need to be heading home. Book the flight and inform the necessary people.” all without placing the phone down from her hand.
"So little one" Lucifer started once they had been seated, Cas was at the head whilst Dean was on his right with Lucifer at the opposite end with Lilith and Abaddon on either side of him. Neither of the Omega's looked at Castiel both were staring straight at Dean. "Naomi informs me that your very happy with my little brother"
Unfortunately Dean knew John better than that, coming to a stop he looked Sam straight into the eye. “Sam Winchester, what does the text say!? Cause I know for a fact it doesn’t say that” he grunted, he had to hear it otherwise…otherwise what? To dash the hope that he was nursing that their Dad would change whilst he was on a ‘business trip’ yeah right
Finally they pulled up at the motel, Balthazar ran in and got a room Cas carried his Omega wrapped in the trench coat that Dean loved so much to the room “Major, we’re get this round out of the way then we’ll head to the hotel”
“Gabriel is messing with you sweetheart. Or he better be. You see he Gabriel here maybe an Alpha but he umm” Cas had a hard time finishing the sentence, as soon as Dean’s Omega heard Cas talk he started purring
Sooner or later there was a slight nudge and a cooing Alpha waking him up, after stretching and moaning at Cas to just let him sleep next time, only to have an even more insistent Alpha waking him up. Once fully awake he heard the tail end of the two brothers conversation, Cas spoke normally “Now I believe Dean is going out. I’m going to head to a seminar. And you are going to do something Gabriel?”
He opened his mouth three times each time letting out a breathless moan till he finally managed to speak. “You! I need you” that made Cas chuckle. he knew that his Alpha would say something like
He slowly moved his hand up towards the not pillow. “Hey look who’s back with me” The not pillow said, it had a voice that was smooth and rough all at once, a that voice he remembered, but form where? He continued moving his hand closer moving the hair out of the way off the not pillows eyes.
Finally the message had gotten through Dean flipped on to his side facing way from Cas “Yes” he stated when he was settled, glancing over his shoulder to make sure Cas was coming. “Yeah that’s right were just going to spoon tonight, we will talk in the morning okay?” the Alpha confirmed.
“say hello dean” his dad intoned
What do you guys think? please comment and let me know
“Not much, sweetheart” Cas said over his shoulder not taking his eyes off the stove.
Apparently Dean was unconvinced stubborn to the last “but Cas I…” he said as he tried to pull away from the Alpha
“You mine” the Omega growled out.
Cas let out a slight growl “Never. You are Mine Dean Winchester”
Lucifer had arrived in his perfect car, as was to be expected with Abaddon & Lilith in tow he had been nice enough stepping out seeing Dean and Castiel waiting to usser them into the house. He still wearing the immaculate suite and bulled shoes. Lilith and Abaddon on the other hand were wearing all black dresses aside from their bright looking red leather collars Dean instantly noticed that neither had Lucifer's name on, his mind instantly being thrown back to the hotel back...back...not home but, back there. And Gabe's words jumped to the forefront of his mind "Cassie just had his perfect Omega offer himself in perpetuity" figuring it was best not to mention anything he let Cas take the lead
Hey lovelies, here's an extra long chapter for you all to enjoy :)
Dean whipped his face with the back of his hand and murmured to his Alpha “What’s wrong with me Cas?” his voice totally broken and wrecked.
“Omega I’d, I’d love to I’m just afraid once I do I will be unable to ever loss you” the Alpha groaned. Dean knew what Cas meant, if he ever left or died or anything where to happen to him, Cas wouldn’t be able to cope. It was time to make a decision either he could put the collar down, kiss Cas till they both where breathless and know neither of them would ever bring it up again. Or he could get Cas to collar him and resign himself to this Alpha forever and ever.
“please, I will be good Alpha I promise” he was begging now moving his hips a little more, attempting to get the Alpha to decide to mate him. “Promise” he groaned once more. Then there were hands on his face he was looking into blue eyes, and he heard the voice again “Oh sweetheart, you are good. You’re my Omega, my sweetheart. Just a little longer for me”
Please Comment it actually gives me drive to write chapters
Dean pulled his head back and locked eyes with his slightly – very – silly alpha “Shut up Alpha” he grumbled out as he fell back down for another kiss “I’m angry, god am I angry” he continued when he came up for air. He expected another apology, or well something other than his Alpha looking deeply into his eyes tears running down his face. After a moment when it was obvious that no reply was coming he spoke again whispering out “Cas you gonna say something?”
He huffed out a laugh “You know that’s the first time you’ve called me by my name without me asking Balthazar” his voice was an echo of its usual self. His Alpha was ridding him hard to do something, anything to not let their gorgeous strong willed Omega get away; but, what could be done? he could chase after Dean though that was likely to end with the Omega telling him that he’d never want to see him again or he could wait and hope Dean would return to him which would mean he’d just have to sit here and stew in his own pit of self-pity.
Unluckily for Dean he didn’t manage to make it to the bedroom before he was tackled onto the floor by his strongly built alpha. “Too slow sweetheart” the Alpha growled, that made the Omega both swoon and attempt to push his Alpha off to continue to run; his slick already coating his inner thighs and the floor beneath them. Cas was absolutely having none of that “Oh no sweetheart, I said I’d knot you where I found you”
Dean thought, they could untie bath in deodorant and maybe selvage some semblance of their combined sanity and respect. Dean was totally hilariously wrong, as Gabriel didn’t seem to understand the prospect of privacy as he marched into the bedroom hands on hips and saw the tied pair then started talking to his Alpha.
Balthazar took a deep breath and again spoke voice becoming harder “Sir you’re going to have to leave now” grabbing Dean by the arm moving him toward the lift, mumbling to himself
“How long do we have till we get there?” the Omega asked
“as in your brother?” he said over his shoulder to the man currently trying to hid in his neck. Cas groaned propping himself up on his elbow “I’m afraid so sweetheart”
the pain was starting to ramp up to high gear “Please Alpha” he practically begged
Michael hissed through gritted teeth. Fighting every instinct he had Dean followed the order, showing his vulnerable neck to Michael; mating gland and all. Talk about humiliating.
Then he stated to push in, and Dean’s eyes rolled back and he entered bliss. His Alpha was inside him, he was complete. Cas set a punishing pace grabbing a hold of Dean’s hips to pull him back, in and out. Dean went to grab his prick hoping to jerk it in time with Cas’s thrusts but was stopped when Cas growled and grabbed his hand.
“Yes sweetheart?” The Alpha said glancing his head over and something deep inside the Omega relaxed. His inner Omega purred ‘S
Cas’s Alpha helpfully supplied, Cas just smiled and let his Omega continue his menstruations. It was faultless, so perfect that he drifted off to sleep. Who wouldn’t? Their Omega cleaning them purring happily. It was absolutely perfect without equal the single handily the best moment of his life so far.
Cas’s Alpha answered for him “Yes, without hesitation or reservation” he stood holding his arms out for his Omega. Dean twitched forwards obviously wanting to be held by his Alpha nevertheless with a massive conscious effort he thought better of it and took a small step backwards. He started to stair daggers at the Alpha, though truth be told his heart wasn’t truly in it.
Instantly Dean felt the copulation to answer his Alpha “I feel empty alpha, okay I said it you can laugh now at my Omeganess” then started muttering about how he shouldn’t have said anything and how it was just stupid Omega biology.
that was tough, I'm going to go lie down now aha
“Nothing sweetheart” he murmured.
The Alpha holding him looked up and said quietly “You told me to ‘shut up’” and Dean just knew that if he were able Cas would have used those bloody air quotes. That made me smile even wider “listen here Cas I’m only gonna say this once. Your sister explained everything”
“But nothing, do you love Dean?”
“Welcome home Alpha farther” he didn’t look up, he learnt that lesson quickly growing up.
New chapter on Monday 1st June
“I’m so sorry I interrupted, I” Dean started to apologise Cas smiled and placed an kiss on his little Omega’s nose to shut him up. Dean gapped like a fish for a moment then fell into Cas the Omega in him demanding that they have this moment so he could mark his Alpha with his scent.
After they had finished their breakfast. Which Dean had stated that Cas should definitely make breakfast from now on, that made Cas smile and promise that he’d do it at least once a week. After washing up the plates Dean spoke “So what are you planning to do today? I’m going to head to dads and pack especially since we’re moving to England soon” he said with a smile, he was truly happy with moving halfway across the world, yeah it surprised him as well.
Castiel had fallen asleep about halfway through the flight, he was holding his Omega sue him he was after all only human. Only to be awoken by that beta flight attendant “Sir, Sir” his snapped from sleep to total awake in a second flat. His Dean was gone from his lap.
Dean gestured to himself looking down towards his ass, still on display waiting for Cas “Yes?” he asked again, the hopeful look returning
Cas mumbled to himself “Leave it to Gabriel to get the hot’s for my mates brother he was never had the greatest idea of privacy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Was watching you…” Cas started he was cut off my a small hand coming up over his mouth
“Hey sweetheart, how are you feeling” oh that voice so rough and smooth at the same time, he loved it. It was Cas. His Alpha. He didn’t say anything too happy to just sit and inhale his Alpha’s scent. “Dean sweetheart, talk to me please” oh that voice was now full of concern he should respond his Omega was telling him to listen to Alpha.
Coming up with a plan stated in his best convincing “Were all pretty drunk, we’ll go get him in the morning” finishing the glass in his had
Though she noted the movement Naomi didn’t comment, she knew what it was like to be in love, well more precisely she knew what it was like to be young and in love. “No sweet child he hasn’t, in fact Samandriel’s been hoping he’d find his match. You see he can’t officially marry until Castiel brakes off the engagement and he’s found himself a lovely omega he wants”
“Don’t mention it Dean I’m glad I could help” their drive was pretty quiet after that. Eventually Cas pulled up at the address that Dean had given him “Do you need any help Dean? I can carry you to the door, or you can lean on me if you wanna walk?”
his omega screamed at him inside his head.
Cas’s Alpha went a little – lot – nuts at the statement “w-wh-what?!” Cas stammered out. Unfortunately the moment had passed and a second later Dean came back to himself glanced around and turned to the Alpha. “Hey alpha, sorry got a bit lost to my Omega there” he said half-jokingly then noticed the colour Cas had gone and spoke again “You alright? Look like you’ve seen a ghost Alpha”
“Oh I love you Dean” Cas said after the toe curling aftershocks had subsisted.
“Yes, sweetheart it is me, I am here” he smiled down at the cutest thing he ever saw; Dean blushing.
John shouted, oh he was pissed
love you all ❤❤❤❤❤
That sent Dean’s Omega into a frenzy of panic “Cas. Cas. CAS!” he cried out as the Brit hit the call button tapping his foot with inpatients. When the lift finally arrived he pushed Dean into the open doors “Come on Sir; time to go. There’s a good chap get in the lift now” smiling slightly to himself he may or may not liked telling people to leave.
He was ripped from his train of thought when Cas spoke again “Omega” his voice had lost all of his anger, just full of sadness.
“But nothing, don’t you deceive to be loved?” Cas said once they separated leaning his forehead against Deans
Love you all stay safe ❤❤❤❤
They fell into a comfortable silence both waking up slowly, neither wanted to rush it. Eventually after what could have been hours, but, was more likely minuets Dean spoke softly his voice becoming one of concern and embarrassment “Cas about what happened last night”
special thanks to barreylover for giving me a kick up the ass to get back to writing
“hush sweetheart all is forgiven now go shower and meet me and Gabriel in the sitting room okay?” Dean smiled and scampered off towards the bathroom, making sure to shake his ass on the way to his Alpha. Leaving Cas to face his brother, sighing to himself Cas knew he couldn’t delay it any longer rolling on a tshirt and pulling on a pair of jeans he was ready to face all the questions Gabriel would have. In hindsight he was happy it wasn’t Lucifer he wouldn’t understand like Gabriel.
Chuck only let out a slight laugh at that, Causing his wife’s head to swing round “I swear he gets it from you sometimes” she said holding out an accusing finger. Though it sounded like a barb it was met by a cheeky smile and the response of “Yeah well, how else was an Omega supposed to get your attention? Hey?”
Amara smiled at this and spoke again “Good. He is a good Alpha, we raised him right. But sometimes he’ll need to be reminded that he is. Don’t be afraid to tell him would you?” her voice soft yet firm, he could definitely see where Cas had gotten that low rumble from.
from one blink to the next Dean presented ass up shoulders down, arms pulling his cheeks apart showing his tight ring of muscle a continuous stream of slick coming out of it, Cas’s inner Alpha marvelled at the sight of it. Overcome with possessive urges he lent forward and licked a line from Dean’s balls to his hole, it tasted like heaven on earth. “Thank you sweetheart” he grumbled out. Getting behind the Omega “Ready sweetheart?” the slight nod that he got from Dean was enough to start. He didn’t move fast or slow just one continual movement inwards till he was totally seated inside his beautiful mate, it was blissful so tight and warm his Alpha relished it.
He swallowed and steeled himself against the demons in his head “I just don’t understand how you could still you know” he voice was low barely audible but it was just enough for Cas’s hearing to pick up. He paused not expecting this, truth be told he didn’t really know what had caused this argument.
Sorry it took me so long, just had some personal stuff to deal with. Im back now so should have a more regular updating schedule from now on.
he mused to himself “Dean” he said whilst grabbing his arm turning him back to face the taller man, blue eyes locked with the Omega’s green for all of a second until Dean broke it.
The door was open and Cas was looking at him, his Alpha, his whole kit and caboodle. All the things he had planned to say melted away all he could do is look directly into those bright blue eyes. Cas stepped back and sat upon the bed, Dean followed standing in front of the Alpha just out of arms reach. Cas looked down trodden he sighed and whipped his eyes preparing himself for what must be said “I’m sorry sweetheart, it’s just I’ve always wanted an Omega like you to buy themselves a collar like that, for me"
For every mile Dean had put between them. Cas felt like a mile that he’d never get back. After Dean had ran out of the room he had sat there for maybe 20 minutes maybe an hour both could be right. Eventually though Balthazar came into the room “Your royal highness?” his usual bravado evaporated leaving only concern for his charge. Castiel was so lost to his own thoughts he didn’t hear – didn’t even register there was another person in the room until the beta physically stood next to his bed and all but shouted “Castiel”
Please comment and tell me what you think
(See the end of the chapter for
The instant his hand made contact Dean began shaking and it was plain to Cas’s Alpha it was not from arousal, having the effect of killing the inner alpha’s want to mount this omega dean. Dean peaked up “Cas?” he whimpered.
“Will you be taking it off now? is it just for the bedroom”  he finally asked, knowing full well some Omega's only wore it during sex, but still hoping against hope the answer would be no. Dean smiled he was starting to get worried that Cas was spiralling again “No Alpha. Never, I will always wear it” then amended the statement “Well aside from showers and swimming of course” that made Cas laugh slightly changing the position of the knot to eliciting another orgasm from the pair.
“Lafitte”
Sam’s were practically the same.
after a moment his face split in the most evil smile Castiel has ever seen on his brother “We’ll be by later this week, I suggest you head to the Palace and present yourselves to mother and Farther, Castiel” before Castiel could comment Lucifer turned on his heal and briskly walked way form the pair.
Love you all ❤❤❤
He smiled to himself. He checked the kitchen and guest room;
Placing the Omega down on his feet he looked down into those beautiful eyes and knew that this was going to be special no matter how much the Alpha within him wanted to flip Dean down and… no can’t think like that. Cupping Dean’s head with both his hands he began kissing him slowly opening Dean’s mouth with his tough, letting the Omega totally melt into him.
What he walked in on was something that even in his wildest dream he never thought he would see, well at least not tonight that is. Dean on the bed totally naked ass up in a textbook perfect presentation posture right down Dean’s hands pulling his cheeks apart and the little stream of slick coming from the tight red ring of muscle. “Yes?” Dean asked. Cas instantly felt his Alpha starting to take charge a ‘willing’ Omega right in front of him would do that to him, well would do that to any Alpha.
“That’s the story” he finished somewhat bitterly “I don’t remember what happened afterwards, looks like my Omega took charge after that” he added, more to himself than for Charlie or Benny. Dean paused swallowed and waited, expecting to hear…hear what? That he’s wrong to be annoyed or that he’s right; that he shouldn’t have come here and he should head home. What would be worse? After a tense minuet he took a deep breath and asked “Are you not gonna say anything?” his voice more nervous now than when Michael had grabbed him off the street.
Naomi, was dressed in suit had kind eyes and frost white hair stood and soft warm smile towards her unexpected guest. “Dean, sweetheart” she started, what she didn’t pick up on was the stab of pain the Omega opposite her felt; for only his Alpha called him that. “What brings you all this way without my dashing younger brother hey?” she sadly smiled towards him as she waved at a seat next to hers.
Leaning forwards his place a gentle kiss upon those lips “Oh Omega I love you. Of course I will collar you” he said in between kisses.
Moving slowly whilst the Omega was kissing him frantically Cas picked Dean up just like last night hands on that perfect ass, but, this time there were no clothes in the way so the tips of his index fingers on either side were just ghosting over Dean’s hole causing the Omega to moan loudly and his already hard prick to start smearing precum all over Cas’s belly. Slowly he made his way towards the bathroom housing the Omega up with one hand whilst the other turned on the shower.
That made the Alpha inside Cas sat up and took note;
what do you guys think? please comment with any ideas on how Dean's shopping trip will go
“umm yeah” the Omega mumbled and nodded at the same time.
“Hey sweetheart, how do you feel?” His Alpha’s voice rumbling above him made Dean feel safe and secure he did love it when his Alpha did that. He purred softly humming to himself. Cas nudged his shoulder into him signalling that he wanted an answer to the question.
Dean looked up he had just been mated, Cas had bitten him. Cas was his Alpha “Cas, you?” he queried. Cas not breaking eye contact smile large and spoke “Yes I did, my omega, my sweetheart” And all of dean’s Christmases and birthdays had come at once Cas was his, was his Alpha “Oh my Alpha, MINE!”
“Okay, to start with. I’ve got a message from mother” he said as he unfolded a piece of paper from his breast pocket. Gabriel coughed and spoke in a mock way of their mother “Castiel the Major tells me you ducked detail, firstly that is not like you. I and your farther are not pleased by this, you know how important it is that you are safe. Secondly he also informs me that you have an Omega with you, put simply you will explain the whole story to Gabriel. p.s. I hope this Omega means what we think it dose” going back to his normal voice Gabriel started “so brother wanna start”
“More than anything” the alpha announced.
The Omega straddled his legs kissing frantically “sweetheart” Cas rumbled when the broke apart for air. Causing Dean to look up “can we do this face to face baby?” Cas asked. That warmed the Omega’s heart Cas was asking rather than telling. Instead of answering him Dean decided to show his gorgeous strong alpha the answer. Grabbing Cas’s rock hard cock he started to slowly impale himself upon it. Luckily there was enough slick flowing out of him to make it manageable if not easy - Cas was almost a foot in length. Cas’s eyes rolled backwards, head hanging slack. “Fffff-uck sweetheart worn a guy” he groaned to his omega as he let forward and soaked up his scent.
Dean only heard “Bath" & "bed” which was enough for him to figure it out, surprisingly he was okay with having a bath, then him and Cas in bed. So he nodded once hoping that Cas’ll get the message.
He hurt, his stomach muscles ached he vaguely remembered that an Alpha said he’d take the pain away, but something happened and now he’s in the back of a car and it hurts. He was sat on a lap head in the crock in the neck, taking a deep breaths in he smelt it that whisky smell that made him feel safe and loved. “Alpha?” he groaned
“Oh, that’s brilliant Castiel, but, d, Does he know about Samandriel situation brother?”
“Nothing of note”
what most Alpha’s didn’t realise that the compulsion was so strong it acutely literally stopped him with one foot in the air. His head span round trying to locate the source of that voice, he locked eyes with a beautiful man with the most stunning blue eyes who was making his way over to him and Alastair.
“Cas, he at the hotel on main. Penthouse. Now Go.” Sam responded.
Dean assumed that Cas was fast asleep when he asked that question, so he decided to ignore the fact that his Alpha seemed to not want to talk about it – well he’d try anyway. He got up showered; got dressed and most importantly put his collar on. Walking into the kitchen expecting to see the Chef that always cooked their breakfast the last few mornings; he was shocked to see his Alpha cooking their breakfast.
slightly shorter chapter today, but i've got plans for the next couple chapters
Please comment it helps keep me going, i love hearing what you guys think
“I told him about the Samandriel situation”
“Alpha, can we move this to the bedroom? Please?” a slight growled and suddenly he was being picked up thrown over Cas’s shoulder a little squeak did not make his way out, not at all. Dean would deny it to the day he dies. “Alpha I can walk you know” apparently Dean talking was not wanted at this moment in time as a few firm swats landed on Dean’s ass.
Sniggering to himself Gabriel smiled “Okay baby brother I’m going to go try this American whisky I’ve heard about” then turned on his heal leaving a slightly pissed off Cas and totally mortified Dean laying on the bed. “So that was my older brother” Cas started as he snuggled back into his mates warm neck inhaling deeply. Dean half smiled to himself even Cas was having family drama grabbing Cas’s arm and pulling himself closer into the Alpha, starting to kiss his fingers “Yeah, I figured that” he said in between kisses.
Sam’s face fell he sighed “It’s from Dad Dean” no use dragging it out
“And what mated him?” Gabriel butted in smiling like cheshire cat
“Better now where back on the ground. So where are we heading?” glancing upwards he saw the smile forming on his mates lips. Oh that smile was more beautiful than anything maybe even Baby… it suddenly hit him that he left Baby back in the states. The moment of introspection wasn’t lost on Cas. What the Omega didn’t realise was that he had payed for Baby to be shipped from the states his inner Alpha purred softly at the idea of pleasing their Omega
“Oh Brother, you’ve gotta tell him. Before Lucifer dose you know what he’s like”
“Dean, Dean I’m sorry I didn’t mean to act so rudely” Cas murmured not breaking the eye contact, that whisky smooth voice wrapping dean in a blanket of warmth. But Dean could also hear what Cas wasn’t saying that he was ashamed to have acted so.
That was it Dean had enough of the constant soft and understanding looks his Alpha gave him. Pushing Castiel away he shouted as load as he could “How can you!” Not noticing the look of pain that caused the Alpha, or maybe he didn’t want to notice. It stung that look, but something inside him was telling him that he needed to push Cas away before he got injured or worse. Yeah they were bonded but even mates separate sometimes.
Cas was fascinated he couldn’t imagine what was inside the box, it was only maybe 12 inches long and about 4 tall and wide. Tentatively he stretched his right arm out and opened it, and there inside was a beautifully detailed black leather collar with the words
Messaged received and understood if Dean’s total surrender to the Alpha’s rumbling was anything to go by “So what happens now?” he whispered quietly. Expecting responses like “Now you go home” or “this was nice but only once” what he wasn’t expecting was the response he actually got.
Cas was worried that Dean had changed his mind, though judging by the slick now running down the Omega’s thighs that was probably not the case. When he heard the reason why dean faltered he knew that it was okay “Oh sweetheart, we can slow down if you want”
But before he could lose himself to how badly he fucked up, Castiel’s farther spoke up “Cas I like him, he’s definitely your Omega!” his voice was soft but he could tell that unlike his own farther when Chuck spoke everyone listened. Eventually Amara stood excusing herself, offing her hand to Dean “I wish to show Dean here some of the room” the question was directed towards Castiel, as the Alpha he had the right to say no.
Once dressed he walked back into the living room only to be met by Cas, a strange smelling yet somewhat familiar Alpha and a smiling Omega. “Um Cas?” he asked “Sweetheart these are you bodyguards, this is Captain Benny Lafitte” Cas helpfully supplied gesturing towards the Alpha then to the Omega “and this is Charlene Bradbury”
Cas smiled and answered “Hey sweetheart” he said softly smiling to himself and his Omega.
So taken in by the Alpha’s face he slowed and stopped his movements. “Dean” Cas groaned both as a statement as if that one phrase could shatter his entire being and question as to why the Omega had stopped.
One though went through him after reading the E-mail for the third time
Things get worse.
“Can’t you hate me” he couldn’t see the look in his Omega’s eyes, it would break him.
Just an FYI this chapters gonna be a rough one
That was enough to appease the Omega beneath him “fine” Dean grumbled forming a pout on his lips.
Gabriel on the other hand could tell that it wasn’t fine it was the furthest thing from fine “Oh kitten. How about this rather than fucking, I hold you and we talk, cause you obviously aren’t fine.” Usually Gabriel didn’t care or want to care what was wrong with the Alpha’s he slept with, but, there was something in Sam’s voice that thawed his want. And made him care. Trust he was as surprised as anyone
“And this must be Dean” The shorter Alpha smiled down at the currently sleeping Omega “well isn’t he just precious” and somehow Lucifer had always made precious sound ominous like the way golem would say it to the one ring. Then things went from bad to worse when Lucifer spoke again “Wake him up I wish to introduce myself” a pause then added “Now brother!” the command dripping with barely contained Alpha aggression and control.
“You stupid brit, Leave! You’ve got to go now. Dad can’t smell you around here. Leave now!” In hindsight leading with telling Cas to go wasn’t the best idea, woops. The look on the Alphas face betrayed more than simple rejection he was hurt plain and simple well for half a second until he schooled his features into something akin to something normal.
“Oh sorry about that” Dean said his face and ear’s going red with embracement.
“Of course I remember Alpha Doctor, Duke and filthy rich. And I’m a broke, stupid omega” he spat out bitterly, still holding the Alpha close. Why was he picking a fight with the most perfect Alpha in the world? Not even Dean really knew. From one second to the next he was span round and given a firm swat on his naked ass “Dean Winchester, no one will ever talk about you like that even you!” Cas roared Alpha voice full and strong. The instant his hand made contact with the Omega Dean felt safe; secure oddly loved.
“Dean?” he voice was rough, but still unmistakably Castiel not his Alpha.
“I’m sorry Alpha you startled me, as all” Dean murmured in his quietest most Omega voice ever, it almost killed him but needs must.
“Okay Alpha I sleep now” it was a statement not a question, Cas knew it, he merely smiled to himself and held his Dean close as the Omega slipped off into a deep sleep. A few hours later Dean was groaning softly whilst deep asleep the ‘excitement’ and bite had taken a lot out of him. Cas had resigned himself to only having one arm the other was supporting Dean’s head, the other he used to check his emails stopping when he found one addressed from his older brother Lucifer
“You know what, you always ask. Well this time it’s my turn. How are you Alpha?”
That was the first thing Dean thought. He was laying on something soft that smelled of his mate, his Cas. cracking an eye open he could just about make out the pillow next to him, something was odd the pillow had hair; it had black hair. Then the pillow moved, it wasn’t a pillow
Her face softened “No bother brother, I was just surprised as all, so tell me about him?” she said earnestly
“yes, and I don’t know what to do.” the Omega next to her said bitterly.
All of a sudden he was being held picked up and plopped down in someone’s lap, someone who smelt like honeyed whisky and Petrichor and mate and love and…then he felt sharp canines on his neck biting hard breaking the skin. And as if suddenly just like that all the fear and worry ran out of him replaced with security and clam. “Humm Alpha” he gowned out. Once the teeth withdrew a rough tough came out to lick over the wound. Then the alpha nibbled his matting bite calming the Omega further. His head was being pushed into Alpha’s neck.
“Yes Cas I remember, it’s just it’s all this is new to me as all”
He smiled and spoke softly “Alpha” the slight growl that occupied the statement sent shivers down his spine. He was about to start moving his hand again when suddenly he had an idea, quickly adjusted his position so that he was fully straddling Castiel’s legs between his and got his own cock out, pressing it against the Alpha’s. Though he was less than a third the size he knew exactly how good it felt to cum this way.
Cas moved Dean to the seat next to him and stood quickly nodding his head swallowed and spoke quietly “Oh right, fine I will go. Sorry to be of an inconvenience to you” and headed towards the door. The omega as per his character sat stoically in the seat he was left.
“OI STUPID ALPHA’S” she all but screamed at the four useless Alphas. That got the reaction she was hoping for; all four stopped and looked at the small Omega. Gabriel smiled, Sam faltered in his attempts to escape Gabriel grasp, Balthazar swung his gaze around the room and Castiel couldn’t stop the growling rumbling through his throat.
Castiel’s eyes shot up, his anger crystallising instantly focusing on Sam. “HE LEFT ME! BECAUSE OF YOU!” Cas screamed pointing at Sam. It might not have been the most rational thought, but Cas was pretty far from rational right now. Sam who had been standing and watching had all of one whole second before he had an enraged Alpha through himself at him. Balthazar jumped in just managing to grab Castiel; whilst Gabriel grabbed Sam – for no Alpha on earth could stop them sleeves when they’re attacked. In the struggle Castiel dropped the paper.
“you smell different sweetheart” he said after a few moments, not as a question but more as a statement
So to sum up Dean’s day so far it started with a monumental meh, then came the literal hottest shower sex ever, got worse when his Dad, Sam and that douche Michael showed up pissed Cas off. And now he was stood in the middle of the room waiting for Cas to shout or divert that anger towards Dean or any number of outcomes that were running though his head. What he didn’t expect was for Cas to grab him by the neck and back him up against the nearest wall, blocking the smaller man in with his superior size. Leaning down he took a massive whiff straight from Dean’s scent gland growing low in his throat.
The night of the dinner
Cas looked out the window seeing the two Omega’s quickly scampering into the house smiling and laughing together. He turned back into his seat and smiled who’d have thought him going on a seminar trip to the States would see him come back with a mate. The patient was a young beta with a serious heart condition upon arriving at the hospital he rushed to the OR to render his particular expertise. A few hours into the surgery his phone beeped he was elbow deep so the nurse read out the message
Blue, strong deep blue was staring back at him; then it hit him “Alpha?” he squeaked out, attempting to slid closer to
“I’m fine Alpha” whimpered and tried to pull his arm away from the Alpha. By now Cas had enough of this, using a little Alpha voice he rumbled out “Dean Winchester, don’t avoid the question”
That made his inner Alpha angry; for no one should make any Omega, least of all his Omega feel like this for there was no excuse Omega’s need to feel loved. A memory flashed through his mind of his mind of his mother chastising Lucifer the first time he called an Omega a breeding bitch, he was 11 and Lucifer was 19. He could distinctly remember their conversation his mother stood and pointed an accusing finger “You are not welcome to use that language Lucifer” coming from his mother that was worse than being dragged though the gutter.
He had to act quickly otherwise he would fuck Dean into the mattress hard. Cas was better than his basic instincts so he approached slowly voice low and soft “Dean? Dean sweetheart, you don’t have to do this.” Dean unfortunately didn’t move. So Cas went to place his hand on Dean’s back whilst he kneeled on the bed – It wasn’t the most comfortable position but it meant he could focus on helping Dean not what he Alpha wanted to do to Dean.
“Okay Dean, will, will you call me later” Sam responded smiling towards him
“Who the FUCK are you?” Sam growled still not lowering or even waving the gun. Cas just observed at the younger man barely blinking. Dean again tried to squirm out of Cas’ hold only to be met by a low warning growl from the man holding him close. As it turns out Alphas who are threatened don’t like the object of their protection to leave who knew.
“Sorry sweetheart, but Sam’s got something to say” oh that got his attention he had almost totally forgot about Sammy. Shit Sam the person who had not 3 hours ago was holding a gun to Cas. He jerked attempting to sit up and was only a little disappointed when he managed it
“Awesome is there anything else we need to get whilst we are out?” Benny asked to two in the back.
“Nope” Charlie said emphatically, crossing her arms over her chest and pocking her tough out to him.
When the two finally emerged almost 40 minutes later they were each carrying at least a dozen bags between them. They all decided to head back to the hotel. What none of them realised was there was a car had followed them from the hotel, then parked up outside the shop. A car that if anyone where to pass by would stink of Alpha rage.
“Yes” he grunted out, his Alpha bleeding even more into his voice.
“Yeah da morning, now pass the glass” John smiled leaning over the table almost falling, but, just managing to garb the glass and pour himself another drink. Sam only hoped that Cas could figure something out between now and then.
“Not at all, I will always tell him. He’s the best”
“Hell no, I’m just the diver” the gruff response was given, though it didn’t hold any malice. It was obvious they both knew something he didn’t. Throwing his hands up and letting out a laugh Dean mumbled out “Fine, both of you guys are asses sometimes” as he slumped back into the chair. Turning to watch the world roll by. He wasn’t sure why heading to Castiel’s Sisters was a good idea but it gets him away from the situation at least for a while so he wasn’t gonna argue.
Gabriel thought to himself and somehow he became a thousand times cuter “Oh I’ve stumped you” letting out a little chuckle “it is okay you can tell me you know I’m not one to judge” Sam seemed to be frozen like he brain was stuck in a loop. Deciding to risk it he leant over and rubbed Sam’s knee whispering into his ear “If you tell me, I will give you a treat” then licked along the shell of Sam’s ear.
"Little Brother" Lucifer nodded. Then turning to look at Dean he smiled "hello there again pressious" and there was still something extremely cold and off putting hearing the juxtaposition between the term of endearment and the way Lucifer's voice held no warmth in it what so ever. "Last time we met, you were fast asleep something about jet lag?"
his inner Omega was chastising him again. He though back
They made it to the penthouse where John and Michael watched Dean write his/their letter
Knowing he was on the right track Cas smiled and allowed a bit more Alpha voice to come out “Why not, I’m going to and you are most definitely going to love it” and if saying he was going to was working; then telling Dean how he’d feel about it was hitting the nail on the head because from one moment to the next the slick went from a trickle to a flood. Cas could definitely smell it now, like strawberries and sugar unmistakably Dean.
“Alphaaaa” Dean cried out.
“Yeah babe, he told me” Cas mumbled out.
Dean shocked him with what he did next, knelling down so he could catch his eyes. Smiling slightly once he managed it. “Well Alpha, how about you put the collar on me?” Dean cooed upwards, again looking like he was going to cry but at the same time he looked beautiful the freckles on his face caught in the evening light.
“Will I what Omega?” he asked him leaning close not caring that his notes were incomplete.
That set the three gentlemen back almost in unison saying “His Royal Highness?” one was obviously still inebriated the other two looked hug over to a greater or lesser extent. “My son is in there” one still drunk one slurred. “He’s my future mate” the other stammered, only the third looked rather pleased for about half a second until he managed to hide it of course.
So I may have finished another chapter woops aha
Once inside he turned towards the bathroom “Good, now you get him a cup of tea Sam, whilst I go shower and change I can still smell Alastair on me. Oh and don’t kill each other.” shouting over his shoulder, he stopped half way up the stairs half turning “and you better still be here when I come back” the bravado lost back to being the Omega that had to be helped in the parking lot.
As nice as it was to have an impromptu make out session in the back of the car. Dean’s Omega needed more! Of what he couldn’t be curtain, he just needed more. So as he dived back into his capture his Alpha’s lips again his hands travelled down his body sliding inside Castiel’s pants finding the slowly grown Alpha cock that ley within. Somehow he forgot how big the Alpha actually was he started moving one hand to massaging the knot at the base whilst the other started moving up and down the shaft. Slowly up and down, so focused on his task of feeling along the length that he totally forgot that Cas might not be in the mood. Glancing up through his eye lashes to behold Cas’s eyes slammed shut and a small blissful smile on his face.
He was getting lost in the scent of the extremely tall Alpha, that was until suddenly there were teeth on his neck and let’s say it was a good thing that he was being held up otherwise he would have ended up sprawled all over the floor with a shit eating grin on his face.
next chapters Lucifer's dinner duh duh duh!!
What do we think? who was in the car? please comment and let me know 😊
“He’s engaged!” Dean spat out just as he sat down.
p.s. Petrichor is the smell of dust after rain
“Yeah I do” the Alpha confirmed, with all his heart.
It reminded him of a story his mother had once told him a story when he had first presented as Alpha she and his father were sharing a bed just like this when chuck had a nightmere his mother apparently pumped the room so full of protective hormones that even the next morning the staff had refused to come in, chuck had been totally smitten from that day on. Cas had asked if he'd ever find an omega who'd he'd do that for? To which Lucifer had only teased him relentlessly and his mother and lent in and whispered "without a doubt my little seraph" seraph had always been the name she used just for him he had been a gift coming so late after all the other children.
“What? Why? on earth did you do that?”
“Naomi” Castiel nodded to her. Rolling his shoulders again, still not working the knots out. “How’s Singapore? Got…” he started before he was cut off by an obviously displeased Omega on the other end “So I hear you’ve gotten yourself an Omega hey?” Naomi started. “And Why did I have to find out from Lucifer of all people?” her tone was light and conversational, but her meaning was obviously she was annoyed by the fact he didn’t tell her directly.
Cas hared Dean whispering “Go to Cas, to Cas, to Cas” and suddenly realised what had happened. Dean was under the composition to come to him. It simultaneously warmed his heart and made him livid as there was only one other person who could send Dean to Cas; Sam – a problem for another time he decided.
“I don’t want him” Stupid omega having to follow those bloody orders all the time.
As the night wore on Lucifer didn't try anything overt to catch Dean out, but Lilith and Abaddon were both "on top form" as Gabe would say trying to make Dean uncomfortable or upset. It started with discussions on their respective Alpha's Knots, who's was bigger and would last the longest "well when I get knotted we're like that for a good half an hour" Abaddon stated to which Lilith replied "that's nothing, when he knotts me we're tied for almost a hour" then they turned in unison and looked at Dean to continue the conversation.
Cas had grabbed Michael by the hair pulling him off his Omega forcing Michael’s neck into an almost unnatural angle. His eyes totally deep blood red, Alpha inside him needing no,
Dean recognised that voice, who was it? He went to move his head then remembered Alpha had told him not to move. “Dean Baby?” he heard it again, he moved his head slightly then forced it back down. “Sweetheart please?” the voice sounded sad, his Omega knew that word. He could see the Alpha’s face who always said it. He could imagine his beautiful blue eyes; but he just couldn’t remember his name.
Dean was not getting breathless no sir, no way. And he most definitely not starting to leak slick on the bed absolutely not; just from Cas kissing his sent gland and whispering in his ear he…oh he totally was who was he trying to kid “Oh my god Cas you can’t just say things like that!” he breathed.
Dean’s inner omega was adamant the needed to get it. Dean had always thought that he’d never end up with one. He smiled to himself “Yeah I want to get Cas something”
“She did?” the relief that washed though his voice was remarkable.
“Oh he anything interesting?” Dean asked totally nonplussed
engraved on to it in stunning gold lettering. Cas’s brain all but stopped “Is that a collar?” he crocked out.
Gabriel smiled leaning back into his chair – Cas had never been one to show that much emotion. “So you chose Cassie hey? Well I guess you didn’t know that I existed” he said with a wink. Instantly Cas’s head swung round to steer daggers at his older brother. Whilst Dean became very uncomfortable. How was he supposed to turn down Cas’s brother without embracing himself or Cas, turning his head back to his Alpha “Umm Cas?” he whispered, ducking his head back into his usual spot at Cas’s pulse point.
“well” he said with a chuckle “I’m currently balls deep in my Omega, who’s by the way carrying my pup.” he continued then half smiled to himself and finished with “The only thing that’s missing is a bacon sandwich” that half smile blow up into a full blown grin, that was until what he had just said registered with Dean. Rather than kick or scream the Omega smiled inwardly and started to push after a few seconds Cas realised something was wrong his knot was starting to be pushed out a distinctly unpleasant experience at best down-right painful at worse. He managed to get a few words out “hey, hey I’m kidding stop trying to squeeze it out”
What neither of them realised was that Lilith at that moment asked Lucifer a question "why do you think Dean didn't have any wine tonight Alpha?"
He obviously was lost to his inner Alpha for some time; as there came another knock on the door and a near silent Dean pleading again “Please let me in Alpha” oh that was it his inner Alpha had enough of this. By the time he realised what was happening he was already opening the door. Only to be met with the single most beautifully heart-breaking sight he ever saw; Dean standing there teary eyed but still looking up at Cas with such reverence that he felt even worse for leaving him.
“I’m his roommate” Sam growled through gritted teeth. Dean and Sam had many arguments about telling people that they were related and live together.
I wasn't super happy with the Chapter but i needed them to be in the right places for the next one #sorry
“Dean?” now the concern which had been growing ramped up massively “What’s wrong with him?” Chuck asked quickly
Cas pulled back licked the gland again and whispered into Dean’s ear “Always and forever. My love” Dean was fast losing consciousness, the bite having the side effect of sending into an almost sleep like haze having just enough self-awareness to mumble back a soft “Love, Alpha” before he was taken to the darkness of sleep. Once the plane had landed and Cas had carried him out on his hip. Leaving his staff to collect the pair’s luggage. Only once they were inside the terminal did Dean then start to awaken. “Humm Alpha?” he said poking his head up to stare into those deep blue eyes.
The next cogent thought in Dean’s head was
“Yeah it was sweetheart” Cas lent down and kissed his beautiful Omega. Leaning back Cas became very still and quiet for a second glancing away trying to avoid Dean’s searching eyes. Surprisingly being knotted to someone face to face meant that avoiding the other person was particularly hard, nearly impossible. “Cas what is it?” the omega asked.
his train of thought was cut off when Dean started talking.
Cas turned his head “Dean you going to be out there all evening?”
“Well here’s what’s gonna happen. You and I are going home, then we’re going upstairs where you’re going to knot me at least twice and I’m going to tell you something amazing got it!” Dean said as he moved around the car to sit in the passenger seat. Regardless of the fact that both him and his Omega were soaking wet Cas was so on bored with that idea he quickly jumped back into the car, put it in first and drove Home, their home, where he and Dean would live.
“Don’t care, want you!” Dean whimpered into his Alpha’s neck again. Well that made the decision easy, they were going to bond fully in about 5 minutes in the local motel – the hotel was too far away. Certainly not what Cas had hopped or intended, he was going to make it so special have food; drinks nearby and shower his Omega with love and affection.
Cas’s sensed the change in his mates behaviour “Baby are you okay?” the concern growing in his voice.
“Right next question; Dean where you forced into a heat?” Jody’s voice cut though his little moment of introspection.
“I know, it’s just what do I do if he wants to leave me?” he asked rolling his shoulders again for what felt like the fifteenth time that conversation.
“Is that a good idea?”
flashed through his mind, then he saw and read the note.
Love you all RT ❤❤❤❤
Hey lovelies here's another chapter!
Smiling to himself he asked the question “ready?” Dean nodded. So Cas began he lifted Dean until he was almost out then slammed back in; to a chorus of ohhs and arrs from the smaller man. He set a punishing pace in and out, in and out. Dean was in total bliss his head rolled back arms came down, he was totally dependent on Cas and he felt amazing, every thrust caused every nerves in his body to sing.
Cas was about to start talking when a voice sounded from beside him “Oi I am right here you could talk to me you know” Dean didn’t even realise he spoke until all eyes were on him. His brain went into a little melt down at that, he had done the one thing Cas had specifically asked him not to do.
Hey everyone,
“Your regret this boy,
“Yep” Gabriel popping the p. then pointed the lollypop at Dean and continued “Cas has just had his perfect Omega offer himself to him in perpetuity”
his omega was preening its alpha loved him so much that he would hold him and bite him just when he needed it.
“Love you too, my sappy alpha. Now please stop moving, I can’t take much more” Dean murmured into his chest.
“Was it a bad heat darling?” Cas asked as Dean licked along his Adam’s apple that slightly tickled, Dean always managed to find the best spots on his body – some even he didn’t know about himself – Dean stopped licking for a second scrutinised the neck before him; then started up somewhere else a moment later, he murmured a “meh” between licks.
” John had gone full Alpha voice again hoping that he could blackmail Cas into handing over a small fortune for the Omega, what he didn’t expect was said Omega to punch him square in the jaw; He fell to the floor clutching his shattered jaw
Pulling back Sam saw the slight reddish bruise that his teeth had left on the shorter Alpha’s neck, it looked good and right, but it needed something more something else. “Loki” he groaned into his ear. Gabriel span around and jumped up throwing his arms around Sam’s neck pulling him towards his mouth, Sam was more than happy to be kissing Loki again. Somehow they made it inside the elevator heading to Gabriel’s room.
So to sum up, they went to the room to fuck and ended up spooning. Gabriel usually would take the small spoon but tonight he decided he’d take the large, something about this Alpha just wanted him to hold him close and listen to his story. So he listened to Sam talk about his life, his brother 'Dean' who sounded like someone familiar, but what were the odds that he'd be related to Cas's Dean? He listened to Sam talk about Jess, the Alpha that had helped him come to terms with his sexuality. He listened still when Sam talked of his father and how he had always pretend. The whole time he just held Sam and listened.
Taking the news that Cas already knew in his stride Dean smiled and nodded to himself “Ah well, at least you know now” he even allowed a little chuckle out.
“Yeah babe?” he said as he pulled Dean closer towards him.
“My omega cum on my cock, or you no cum” Cas growled adjusting his position to hit Dean’s sweet spot deep inside him. Dean whimpered he definitely loved it when Cas went all Alpha like this and that’s when Cas started whispering into his ear “My omega, only mine, mine, my omega”
“He will not want to see me, especially after the way I acted yesterday” Dean murmured and started to cry silently another kind of skill he picked up whilst growing up with a farther like John.
“Fine. Just stop moving please” the slight desperation in the Omega's tone telling Cas and his Alpha that their Omega was fully satisfied and done. Stopping his movements they smiled and held each other waiting out the knot just happy to be together and so, so much in love.
“well you did say you want me “to be here” if I remember correctly” despite the air quotes Dean was immensely happy that Cas had waited even though it had only been maybe half an hour.
A few minutes later Cas’s knot went down and he slipped out of his mate. Cas grabbed the wet cloth to help clean them up. Dean already hated the feeling of emptiness he’d have to figure it out and keep his mouth shut, no need to tell Alpha.
Dean was having trouble focusing especially on anything that wasn’t Cas’s hands or the sound of his voice. So the only word he could come up with was ‘yes’
Next time he woke up he was alone,
"Umm...welll...you see" he started when he was cut off by Lucifer himself who had been watching with growing interest "come now Sweetheart, you must know how long my little brother keeps you on his knot? Or it bearly adequate that you can't tell?" Before he could think about what he was doing Dean was stood up fist slamming down on the table "how dear you insult My Alpha!" He rawed "he's the best Alpha anyone could ever ask for! Hence why his name is on my bloody collar! And for your information" pointing at Lilith and Abaddon "his knot is so huge it makes me feel like I'm being split open!" Once his tirade was complete there was a sudden oppressive silence in the room that seemed to stretch on for hours.
hey everyone
Dean was totally taken aback he just wanted to die, this was his mates brother they were naked tied and stinking of sex. Fortunately Gabriel didn’t notice or didn’t care and started to berate the Alpha “So Cassie, get this mother hears a report that you duck your detail. Which is bad by the way. Then to make it worse you pick up a random omega…” he was stopped mid-tirade by a growling alpha, coughing to clear his throat the Alpha stated leaving no room for doubt or discussion “his name is Dean, now get out and once we’re decent you can do your 20 questions okay brother?”
“Are you sure Dean?” the question wasn’t leading just looking for conformation.
Cas was shocked. His Omega had tied pushing him away and started screaming at him. Taking a calming breath, he tried to think rationally. Even though his Alpha was rising to the challenge its Omega was portraying. Calmly he spoke to the Omega glancing up into the face of the man opposite him “Dean”
“Dean Winchester” Oh Alpha voice rumbled out, deep and strong, his eyes locked up into the deep blue eyes looking back into his. “You listen to me. You will be fine. We will be fine”
“It’s called a full English Breakfast, its got hash browns; beans; sausage; bacon and a few other bits. Trust me Sweetheart you’ll love it” the scent coming off the Alpha was pure happiness and light that Dean almost couldn’t cope, his Alpha was perfect absolutely perfect. They lulled into a comfortable silence Cas cooking Dean watching – well that was until Cas spoke “So Sweetheart wanna talk about that question last night?”
his Omega purred; Dean agreed whole heartily “you’re cooking for me?” Cas said once Dean finally pulled away. Somehow his hands had landed on Dean’s naked hips thumbs rubbing circles on the skin, making Dean giggle.
Sam repeated the instruction, but, Dean didn’t move for a few heart beats; and time was running out John would want Sam to drink with them. For the first time ever Sam took a deep breath and without raising his voice his Alpha rumbled out
“So Dean wanna see the kitchen? I bet that Alpha of yours would love a home cooked meal when he gets back and I’m sure Pam wouldn’t mind”
“Simple. You let him go” she said so matter of fact like he could almost believe that they were discussing a business transaction not his future happiness.
That title always annoyed Cas, he’d much rather be given praise for his achievements rather than who his mother and farther were “Balthazar call me Castiel or Cas hell even Doctor anything, anything but that please” that was the thirty fourth time – yes he had been counting – that he had told the Major and his staff that simple command.
“Now both of you apologies to each other” throwing as much anger as he could into his voice Sam always called this his ‘Omega voice’ there was a beat of silence. Dean staring both the knuckle head Alphas down
Sam went still looking between Michael and John not sure how or what to say. Obviously not getting the response he wanted Michael asked again “So Sam, where’s my future mate then?” that voice like sandpaper grating upon a blackboard. Without even thinking twice he let out “Oh he’s at the hotel” instantly regretting it his big stupid moth had let slip where Dean had actually gone, and this is why he shouldn’t drink.
“So you managed to get someone to mate you before Michael here?” John said gesturing to the Alpha next to him who was obviously about half a minute from losing his mind with anger. “And you’re some pompous prince or something?” John finished
Dean swallowed again and spoke quickly “bite me, please Alpha?” that made his Alpha preen with excitement, their Omega was asking for the bite. Logically he knew why, serval nerve clusters were located on the back on an Omega’s neck; that when bitten by their mate releases a huge amount of endorphins thus calming said Omega down. Mated biology had perks. He knew this but; having his Omega ask for it made him feel supremely lucky and loved.
Cas jumped on to the bed he pushed Dean’s legs grabbing his hands and pinning them above his head “Mine” Cas confirmed as he came down and kissed Dean hard sucking all the air out of the smaller Omega. Dean smiled up he had an idea “tell you what, would my big strong Alpha like to knot me in this bed” he said.
Seeing what was happening between Cas and Sam, Dean acted quickly pushing Cas down back into the seat and sliding back into Cas’s lap whispering into his ear “Cass calm down, Its okay. I’m used to it” rubbing the back of his neck little concentric cycles. It was working until Sam moved to exit the room wanting to clear his head. Cas’s eyes instantly swag around away from the Omega.
Eventually they were settled in the car heading towards Castiel’s country estate “Well that went well” Cas smiled and handed Dean a coke.
To say Dean was in haven even whilst asleep was a bit of an understatement to say the least. But something changes the sent changes from sweet to almost sickly, he whines in the back of his throat
Without even introducing himself the one that smelt of drink slurred towards the Omega that was sat in Cas’s lap “So you whored yourself out? As what revenge when I arrange a suitable match” that caused a whimper from the man on his lap and set his Alpha on edge, but Cas was a Royal he knew how to behave so he would keep his temper in check at least for now that is. Thanks to Benny he could figure out the two gentlemen’s, John the farther, Michael quite frankly spine chilling one and of course Sam who he had met a few day earlier.
Suddenly Dean remembered his neck was naked and that absolutely will not do “Cas where’s my collar?” he asked. That warmed the Alpha’s heart, despite everything his omega still wanted to wear his collar. He lent-over to the counter side grabbing the box “Charlie put it back in here for us” he said holding it up.
Cas the poor man could only see his naked Omega, leak slick beneath him “Mine, knot, bed” was the only response he could come up with all guttural and grants making Dean thrum with even more arousal “okay come one then” he said as he pushed Cas off just enough to present to his.
What neither brother realised was Dean was listing to the entire thing. Walking in sitting right on Cas’s lap facing Gabriel wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck. “Cas, don’t forget you shouted down my asshole farther” he helpfully supplied.
“Yes my sweetheart” Cas rumbled into his ear, smiling to himself when Dean pushed himself further into his hold. “’m not a sweetheart” groaned, though in reality Cas suspected that Dean didn’t believe he was worthy of such a term of endearment and in that moment decided that if it was the last thing he did he’d make Dean believe it.
“not what?”
Hope your all enjoying the story so far. On a side note this fic now has over 100 kudos and 75 subs. and I just wanted to say thank you to all of you <3 love you all stay safe RT ❤❤❤❤
“Okay Cas, and thanks for helping me out back there” regaining a bit of his equilibrium, stating to relax a little more.
“Dean-o collar are usually gifts that the Omega gets, it’s a sign that the two are so deeply in love they want the world to know. It’s more than matting bites or even marriage, its everlasting its forever” Gabriel helpfully supplied popping a lollypop in his mouth
Sorry I'm a bit latter than I wanted to be posting this chapter, I hope you all enjoy it. next one up soon
“Naomi’s, she’s back from her visit and is by far the most sensible of all the siblings. Care to explain what’s going on?” her face holding no judgment just concern. So he relayed the story of what had occurred earlier that day.
Cas half turned and spoke softly “I’m staying at the Hotel on main street, in the penthouse. Will be there for about 4 days” he paused and half smiled again “thanks for the tea” Sam couldn’t tell if that was some sort of Brit joke or if he actually meant it.
“but…” Dean went to continue he self-destructive thoughts. Cas lent forwards and planted a chased kiss on his lips having the effect of stopping him dead even making his cheeks pink a little.
Apparently he didn’t get an option as his stupid inner Omega decided for him “Yes” Cas half smiled and turned towards Sam and the living room.
Leave it to john to go all Alpha. Nothing new there.
Four days prior
Amara’s head inclined slightly as if asking the question again but this time directing it towards the sitting Omega, dean totally noticed that it was near identical to how Cas moves his head when he was confused by something he had said. Taking her hand he was led through a few rooms each one decorated with great works of art and adorned with beautiful furniture.
“I’m going to sleep bro, jetlag’s a bitch” Gabriel standing and heading towards the guest room.
Dean Grunted to himself getting up and walking towards the bathroom “Yeah Cas, I’m fine” that was basically Dean’s moto. Cas was totally not buying any of that he rolled his eyes
A few moments later Sam walked back in, ready to tell them that dinner was ready. Only to be met by a sleeping Dean and a content Cas. Smiling he left them to their intimate moment moving slowly back towards the kitchen. And for one brief moment everything was okay, that was until his phone beeped a text from an unknown number but Sam instantly knew who it was from
“Is there anything you’re not good at baby?” he said whilst siting on the stool.
Setting his Alpha in check Cas responded “nothing Lucifer is slightly” a little growl excepted his throat “I mean very traditional and conservative” the growl in his voice portraying how he actually felt about such concepts, softened to a soft pur as he continued “I am nothing like him sweetheart, you know that. Please tell me you know that?” Dean paused for a second then pulled himself closer to his Alpha muttering apologies and promises that he knew that. Cas for his part pulled his Omega even closer to his chest noting the soft ‘Oh’ from the smaller man. Placing his nose next to Dean’s head next to his scent gland, allowing his scent to calm the omega further.
He walked into the sitting room taking a seat, once settled he lent forwards grabbed himself a glass of the whisky “Okay brother I’m ready to answer some questions” after taking the first sip.
Hey everyone im back, hoping to for two chapters this week. Love you all Stay safe xx <3
Dean bless him was so lost to his Omega he didn’t even realise that Charlie had not only gotten up but had also dressed and somehow managed to get him in the back of the car. Coming back to himself slowly he heard the tail end of a conversation “I know lovely, but I can’t” he knew that voice it was definitely Charlie a pause as the other person on the phone answered “Yes, he needed me” another pause “thanks love I will talk to you soon, I think he’s waking up. Love you lots bye” she finished.
The room became still in addition to pin drop silent, filling with Alpha rage. The smell of honeyed whisky replaced with pure Alpha dominance. Sam bless him was trying to remain calm but having an Alpha pumping out pure rage was setting his Alpha off as well; seeing Cas as a challenge he growled low in his throat. that caused Cas to lock eyes with Sam obviously finding something to take his anger out on.
. The constant presents of his Alpha’s scent and that whisky voice helped calm Dean, those big strong alpha arms holing him close. Eventually he murmured “Alpha?”
“Yes, I’m gonna strip you down lay you out on our bed and make you scream with my tongue” Cas spoke softly his arms coming round to hold his Omega tightly the rumble of his deep voice reverberating through the smaller man in his lap. After a few minutes Dean slid back across the centre and keeping one of Cas’s hand firmly resting upon his lower belly.
The Beta above him smiled slightly, though he worked for the family and Castiel he’d consider the well-mannered Alpha a friend. “I know Castiel” he started his voice still holding the slight lit at the end “I’ve got his royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh on the phone for you” he finished handing the phone over to Castiel, who took it quickly starching out his arm to take it.
Dean pondered this for a moment, he knew that Cas would be better at it than him. so after a moment he swallowed nodded and spoke “Okay Alpha” that’s all Cas needed he started moving his hands still holding Dean’s up and down. Dean’s eyes started to flutter close feeling the waves of pleasure running through him “That’s it baby, feel good? Having my hands slid up and down our cocks.” the Alpha asked
(See the end of the chapter for
That set Dean’s Omega back firstly Royal highness, secondly and more importantly Cas? “G-g-go to Cas”
Balthazar walked around the corner, coughing to clear his throat “Your Royal Highness?”
"You will not!" Castiel's voice rolled out like an avalanche or the moment of continents. "Lucifer you maybe my older brother and senior to me in many respects, but, you will not and never will have the right or ability to punish my mate, my Dean! Do. You. Understand?!" And all Dean could think at that moment was '
As it happened Cas was the first to break the silence “Apologies. Sam was it?” that voice of his was almost back to normal; less of growl more a subtle purr
“In the old days they were the keys to the vault where we hold our riches. Now it’s just another title to dazzle people, we English do love our titles” Dean could defiantly hear the smile in his Alpha’s voice.
“He’s gone Father”
“Yes, I swear you always lead with the wrong thing. If you had started with” coughing to clear his throat he put on his best Castiel voice and continued “
“Why aren’t you asleep” Dean asked.
. His inner Alpha helpfully all be it angrily supplied.
Cas huffed, he suspected that at some point his head strong omega would have a thing or two to say later on. “Thank you sweetheart, now I’m off to a seminar if you need me or anything happens just tell the Captain; he’ll inform me” standing and excusing himself from the room.
"Greetings Brother" his Alpha stated formally.
Then Sam said one word low barely audible, well that was for everyone but Cas that was. “Dad”
“fuuuuuuuuccccckkkkk Alphaaaaaaaaaa” the Omega groaned, then Cas started to move and what little was left of Dean’s brain functions fled with the intense pleasure that his Alpha’s cock provided. All he could feel was Cas’s huge cock moving inside him and finally, finally they were safe and could focus on each other not Dean’s asshole farther.
Slowly he begins to wake, nothing how he’s use to awaking. The first thing he sees is absolutely perfect it’s Cas smiling down at him, but somethings wrong the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. He smiles anyway and snuggles closer.
The shouting brought Sam from the kitchen, instantly seeing Dean on his knees Dad and this strange smelling Alpha. Thinking quickly he came up with a plan. “Dad, welcome home. I got your favourite bourbon from Scotland it’s awaiting you in the living room” that caused John to smile and thank him leading Michael away talking about the mating and his plans for the money. Leaving shaking Dean at the foot of the door.
“Oh I thought you knew” Naomi asked confused.
Even though Sam was still getting to know Cas he could tell that this was meant by a palpable relaxation “Oh” Cas murmured as he herd the shower start glancing upwards.
“Aye sir”
Just as he arrived at the lift he felt massive arms came around him and pull him close “Where do you think you’re going?” the growl went straight to his core,
What happens next
After they had finished showering and headed to the kitchen to make breakfast. The chef arrived and cooked them burgers for breakfast, which Dean assured Cas was the best thing on earth after mind-blowing earth shattering sex that was. Cas being Cas just smiled and nodded chowing down on his own breakfast burger occasionally offering a bit to his Omega who was more than happy to accept. A little while later Cas got a message over the intercom from Captain Benny Lafitte that Dean’s farther and brother along with another strange Alpha calling himself Michael were here to see them.
“oh you did stay then?” Dean said totally ignoring the question Cas had asked him
Jody smiled at the small Omega “Okay Dean sorry to make this harder” unusually for an Alpha she actually meant it. Once he was finally out of the room he headed towards the bedroom. That was until his stomach groaned once more he barely made it to the toilet before he vomited his soup he had made for the two of them. Maybe it was residual heat hormones running tough him or it was the fact he just had to relive something truly awful. His Omega was totally unhelpful as per usual; only smiling like cheshire cat and purring non-stop.
“Yes baby?” he heard from behind him, the voice was totally washed out and raw. He was licking his lips probably teasing the frankly ridiculous amount of slick pouring out of Dean.
“Oh Alpha please it hurts” Dean cried as tears began to roll down his cheeks. All he could think that he needed the pain to stop, he needed an Alpha any Alpha.
“Technically I’ve meant Samandriel half a dozen times” the Alpha correct. After receiving a not so happy face from his Omega he continued “but yes that might have been better” he finished as he to let down the smaller man in his arms.
“Oh I see now Sam likes to meet Alpha’s hey” Gabriel whispered after pulling back and popping a sugary sweet into his mouth. Sam’s eyes were almost totally glazed over his Alpha had been totally taken in by this odd brit, everything he seemed to do was driving his inner Alpha mad with want and need.
Dean was in total heaven, but he needed more. So as soon as Cas started kissing him he moved his hands slowly down his body till he reached his boxers; looking up for permission he saw Cas smile and nod even as he continued kissing him. Dean brought the boxers as far as he could down, Cas handled the rest. Once reviled in all its glory Cas’s cock was hard and pumping out pre cum ready for the Omega’s tight wet hole, Dean paused.
That was laughable, look out the window Alpha was insane there was no way he’d do that “Nope I’m good here Alpha” closing his eyes again he was happy to just lay there like this. Cas chuckled he doubted that his wilful strong Omega would want to look out “Okay Sweetheart, we’ve got about 9 hours flight ahead of us”
“Sammy lower the bloody gun before you hurt yourself!” Dean shouted trying to be the I’m big, your small, I’m right your wrong brother voice. Admittedly it was difficult considering he was currently being carried like a bride. Sam either didn’t listen or didn’t care because the gun didn’t budge.
“We home yet?” Dean asked, apparently Cas had bitten him a little harder than he intended, as he was still a little – well a lot – out of it.
Thankfully Charlie was one of the lucky omegas that found Alpha Voices nothing more than annoyance “listen to me, Dean didn’t leave you” hearing that that stopped Castiel dead, in fact the whole room stopped. “Castiel come here” she said extending her hand, Balthazar judging that letting Castiel go wouldn’t result in him literally ripping Sam’s head off let him. Alpha practically jumped to her side without hesitation.
“So tell me what happened, cause he isn’t going to” Sam said. After Cas had relayed the entire events that led him to him being in their front garden. Sam smiled and thanked Cas for looking after his head strong older brother; but became serious a split second later “What exactly are your intentions towards Dean Cas?”
As he slid next to Dean he heard the faintest “Yes” emanating from the Omega “Good night dealing one” he said into Dean’s ear and kissed the sent gland just to drive the message home – this Alpha was interested but not tonight.
“Yes your mine” Cas confirmed; he supposed that was the answer. Walking outside stepping over the unconscious form of John Winchester, seeing Balthazar pulling up outside in one of their cars. “I’m taking you to a safe place sweetheart. I’m sorry that our first heat mate is going to be in a crap motel” the effect of having his Omega in heat causing Cas to become increasingly horny they had to mate soon.
“Oh Dean” The Alpha cooed again, his hands still making little concentric motions trying to calm his worried mate.
Zachariah a man who prided himself on following orders and ensuring all was to plan, didn’t take well to changes in said plan; though he didn’t let it show on his face. “Yes Ma’am. I shall do it as soon as you’ve made your appearance at the…” he started but was cut off by the annoyed Omega. “No Zach. Now. Castiel needs me home as soon as possible”
Fortunately Dean knew that Cas was the one and not just the one, the actual one, his one. “Cas, baby I know how you feel. Once you collar me, you don’t get to ever leave me. Never” and that prompted Cas into action his arms came up cupping his hands around the Omega’s face whipping away the tears that were coming from his beautiful green eyes.
Sam was working on dinner in the kitchen when it happened, when John came home.
RT ❤❤❤❤❤❤
What Sam didn’t realise that the shower had turned off or that Dean was waiting outside the room listening to the Alphas talk. Eventually Sam stood to go get started on dinner.
The next thing Dean knew the Alpha was gone. Had he done something wrong? Alpha was going to knot him, make the pain go away wasn’t he? Deciding that if in doubt it was the Omegas fault. He figured in his heat addled brain the best thing to do was stay in that position, and hope that Alpha would come back and forgive him.
What do we think? How will Lucifer treat Dean when they land?
as split second later Dean took off into the night and the only thought in Dean’s head was that simple command.
“And I you my Alpha” Dean said as the collar locked in place, he felt the tight but not constrictive weight around his neck. Feeling happy, wanted and most of all loved. Cas just looked down at his now collared omega felling his Alpha preening with happiness, joy and serval other emotions that he couldn’t name. All he could think about was wanting to please and love this Omega with everything he had for as long as he could.
Cas was having none of that, the scent of content Omega fast becoming sad and worried. He pushed his fingers on his lips quieting his Omega “Hush baby, we’ll be fine, it’s okay hush”
Little did either know Cas was raised right and that words was a truly awful to the extent that in the United Kingdom using such a word would land one with a hefty fine and sometimes prison sentences. Cas’s inner Alpha roared
a heads up the next two chapters will take place on the same night
“Thank you mother” he smiled and bowed slightly, etiquette demanded that he shows defiance. She was after all his immediate superior and mother to boot.
“About 2 hours wh…” Cas didn’t have chance to get the second part of the question out as he had a rather clingy Omega in his lap attacking his mouth yet again. Breaking the kiss he smiled and tapped a button sliding the partition up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Luckily that was when the self-proclaimed smartest person in the country ran in. The first thing Charlie noticed was that all the Alpha’s were too busy trying to calm and retrain a justifiably livid Castiel. The second thing she noted was the small piece of paper that had fluttered down on the floor. She knew one things for curtain, that was simple Dean would never leave Cas. Leaning down and collecting it, unfolding the letter it took her all of about half a seconds to decipher what was actually meant.
Dean smiled purring contently he cooed to his Alpha “Thank you, now how are you? Dad, Sammy and Michael being here must have been difficult” Cas was totally taken aback he had just gone full alpha and the first thing his omega did was check on him. He marveled at how lucky he had gotten to be chosen by this Omega, his Omega.
His alpha screamed again his anger renewed. He must find Dean! Dam his title, dam consequences, dam the world entire.
Dean huffed yes of course he knew other words he just couldn’t think of any right this second obviously. “yes” he stated.
Michael introduced himself straight away with the Alpha voice, what a dick.
“Rodger that” Benny half turned to her on his way out “Where we going Cher?” his voice holding nothing of the bravado it usually held, he was worried for Dean not because he was charged with his protection but because he actually cared for the man.
Once inside the room he placed Dean standing on the floor; he turned and locked the door. Turning back he saw Dean was already taking off the trench coat “Omega” the Alpha growled. Dean stopped his movement half way to shrugging off his coat “Alpha?” he asked halfway between a plea and whimper, Cas lent down undoing his shoes “You have 3 second to run to the bedroom, don’t make it I knot you where I catch you” he Alpha punching out every word. Dean squealed with joy – Omegas loved it when their Alpha chased them; its basic biology – he took off towards the bedroom, shrugging off the trench coat along the way. Cas gave him about 1 and a half before taking off after his Omega.
his omega was screaming at him to leave. He had to get off the plane.
even though Cas had said not to worry he was slowly driving himself crazy. Waiting there his fingers dancing in the air hoping that they would approve. Then he herd Castiel’s mother speak “Now introduce use would you?” his head snapped up and he took a half step towards his Alpha. Then faltered and stepped back
That made Cas’s heart melt – well was melt is a understatement, it was a pool of goo in his boots – his Omega needed to hear something he never thought he'd have to say anyone least of all his mate. He remembered back when he first presented as an Alpha hearing all his classmates talking about O’s like they were nothing but knot-hangers and all he could think was he wanted a Omega who’d love and challenge him. “Oh Sweetheart, I don’t care if all the kids we have are Omega’s or Beta’s. I will love my entire family including you my strong willed bull-headed strong Omega, who isn’t afraid of anyone!”
Cas groaned “Im sorry baby” sounding totally broken, he hated doing this to Dean, the wonderful omega shouldn’t have to worry about his family. Dean had two options, one he could slap Cas on the side of the head – awkward to do at the moment; two he could try to convince Cas that all families have drama. So he settled on the latter “Don’t be Alpha, we’ve all got family. And I guess I’m part of yours now. Actually what does that make me? Am I a duke now or an earl or something else?”
Gabriel on the other hand knew exactly what they were doing, drive an Alpha nuts then walk away and let their instincts to take over. It was so easy sometimes.
He realised what he just said, leave it to Dean to find the dirty side of things “Oh you think your funny little one” Dean gave an affirmative hum. Cas span Dean around and picked him up hands on his ass again “babe the soup” Dean huffed though it was a token defence, he was eye level with Cas now and even though he felt a little sore he still loved it when Cas manhandled him. Cas lent down and licked across his bite causing Dean’s toes to curl with pleasure.
. Making outside the hotel and sprinting towards John’s house, his peak physical condition combined with pure Alpha rage meant he didn’t feel the lactic acid building up inside he muscles.
“oh keys; what keys are these”
What do we think? please comment and let me know. Next chapter will be about Sam and Gabriel and takes place at the same time.
“But…” he started, but Dean had enough of this conversation all he wanted to do was be held by his Alpha as he waited for his knot to go down so he clenched his ass around Cas, causing the Alpha to moan deeply in throat as he shot yet another load into the Omega. “okay, okay I get the message Dean”
“He’s amazing, great and just wonderful”
What did you all think? anyone crack Dean's message? please comment and let me know :)
“Cas I guess you’re gonna be home late, Benny says you work late most of the time. Foods in the oven for you to heat up when you get home. Love you my big silly Alpha” she paused and let out a slight laugh “he’s even put a little heart emoji what a cute Omega you’ve got there Cas”
“Assbut hey, I’m gonna use that beautiful” the Alpha smiled
“Yes. So get the bloody car now!” she snapped. Causing him to smile and disappear out of the room. Turning her attention to Dean now she saw him to what appeared to her to be on the brink of tears. “Right then Mister” she started as she got the rest of the way out of bed.
He heard it speak again, but, he found it hard to come up with anything worthwhile. So he decided that simple is best especially at the moment he took a shallow breath then spoke. “Alpha” his voice was soft and a little wrecked, but it was load enough for Alpha to hear. Near instantly there was a soft purr coming from Alpha’s chest like the dull hum that would come from baby whilst she was in park. He was sad to leave her but it’s not like they could bring her with them, he had smiled at Alpha and told him that Sam would look after her. Cas was unconvinced, little did Dean know but Cas had already spoken to Sam and they had agreed to ship Baby home. – So relaxing he almost missed next words cooing into his ear “There’s my wonderful Omega”
“Ah im sorry sweetheart but I’ve got to go into work” he sounded glum, down and slightly relived. As he stood and walked down the drive towards another car, a black Continental Bentley that Cas had gotten for graduating from Medical school with honours. How had dean missed that? It wasn’t as good as American muscle cars like baby but he could appreciated a good car like that.
“Baby, there are many things I fell for you” Cas sucked a breath in, he was scared of what Dean was going to say next “But I could never hate you alpha” the air was kicked out of him
“Cause ‘m not…”
So what do you guys think? How do you recon John and Micheal will react once they hear the news?
blood. He smiled seeing the look of pure horror and realisation in the other Alpha’s eyes as he lent close and whispered “Hey assbut!” before throwing him across the room.
They had been sharing drinks and stories for the last few drinks, Gabriel found out that Sam loved books, family and oddly the Law; whereas Sam discovered that Loki was a shameless flirt. “So what brings you to this wonderful hotel hey Samshine?” Gabriel smiled as he finished his glass and gestured for another. He had been flirting with this Sam for almost an hour and figured that now was as good time as any to ask.  Sam froze like a dear in the headlights, Oh the reaction was what he had intended. “Well umm, you see I” he muttered, paused and then tried again “I…I” but couldn’t seem to get what he meant out.
“I don’t know” the Omega admitted quietly.
He remembered a promise he made whilst Dean was sleeping the previous night, it was maybe 1 in the morning Cas was simply watching his Omega breathing in and out; every 5 or so breaths Dean would huff slightly and maybe mumble a word or two. Cas would lean a little closer even whilst deep asleep he still wanted to hear whatever Dean had to say most of it was totally unintelligible, but, the words "Cas" "Alpha" and "Love" kept finding its way to the surface. It made Cas's chest go all warm and tightat the same time.
Then it clicked, Cas was a newly mated Alpha who just had a run in with three other alpha’s. Two of which were at best extremely irritable or at worse downright hostile, and the third actually touched his Omega. Cas was operating on basic instinct to claim what is his. They entered the bedroom and Dean was thrown onto the bed whilst Cas started ripping his clothes off. “Yes, I’m yours Alpha” Dean purred as he started to wiggle out of his own, somehow they ended up totally naked, but Dean didn’t care not one bit.
“Right so trust him, okay brother?” she concluded.
“Think? Alpha. I think this ‘house’ as you call it, is amazing” Dean said, took a swing of his coffee he paused then spoke with a subtle purr in his voice “plenty of rooms for pups, hey Alpha?” he had expected the Alpha to preen and smile instead Cas looked almost completive and withdrawn; for a brief moment before schooling his features. Dean was about to ask why he looked down when the Alpha’s phone beeped loudly and continually.
Dean smiled to himself this was a bad idea but boy would it feel good for a second or two “Hello dean”
Next to arrive were Sam and Gabriel barging into the bedroom hand in hand – Balthazar noted that they arrived together, a question for another time – both Alpha’s looking more worried that angry. Sam froze seeing the collar, Gabriel on the other hand sprang into action running over to his youngest brother kneeling down “Cassie? Cassie what’s wrong?” the concern evident in his voice.
Dean started to wake up slowly in increments, once they were settled in the car heading towards the Palace. Castiel had positioned his Omega in his lap head in his usual spot “humm Alpha” he groaned bearing his face further into Castiel’s neck
He was in a total spiral knowing that every second he didn’t go back out there was another second that Dean would never forgive him for. That was until there came a knock at the door. Cas stopped pacing eyes locked on the handle that tried to move. When had he locked it?
After a moment, Sam weighing up his options he took a deep breath and started “Fine, it says ‘we’re heading back into town, tell that useless” he took a pause, both Sam and Dean hated the next word “knot-slut to get my room ready’. Happy now” finishing the sentences as quick as he could.
