Instead, he brought down the knife ruthlessly into the man's shoulder, causing him to scream louder every time Sherlock brought the knife down.
Sherlock glared. "Serbia."
John would have said an inappropriate joke about how it should have been six six six with Sherlock, but his eyes were drawn downward to the top of Sherlock's legs. There were silver scars on the back of his thighs, each one covered in faint yellowed bruises. "What's that?"
Janine nodded, finding the first aid kit under the sink and taking some objects out. "Take your hand away." He did as told and Janine wrapped him back up and he had to admit that it was much less gentle than Molly had. She quickly finished with a few pieces of medical tape on his shoulders where he had hurt himself at Bart's.
Lestrade walked across the room behind them, deciding to save the day again. "Champagne?"
Nobody thought that it would be distracting.
Sherlock looked at him for a second in confusion, then snorted in laughter. He chuckled for a few moments, just grinning.
John looked up at him sadly. "So it's true then? You've actually got… you're…"
Sherlock smiled pleasantly, covering his fury easily. "Remember the question we thought we would never find out about
"Hey Sherl. I'm going to come in." Janine stepped through the doorway, leaving the door open, and peeled off the shirt she was wearing. Stepping into the shower, she wrapped her arms around Sherlock's waist, pressing up against him and kissing in between his shoulder blades. He leaned back on her a bit, touching her leg and brushing his thumb over one of the twenty three silver scars on her thighs that matched his fifteen. He had counted them a dozen times.
He was taking aim again.
Sherlock nodded a bit, looking around at the grassy yard surrounded by a fence. "I guess you could call it that. Much different from when we were the ones sharing a bunk and Sam ran the place. As strange as it is for me to say, I'll miss them."
Bright lights.
Sherlock shrugged, kissing her lips softly. "I was working my little moonbeam."
She just shook her head slowly, taking a few deep breaths and stepping away to fall onto the couch heavily. "So, you came to me. You came to me in the middle of the night because you had gotten into trouble for ra-
Sherlock smiled softly at his landlady before moving over to Greg who was sitting in John’s chair, also holding a champagne glass, reaching out to shake hands. "If course, that isn't the only reason we came over, but it is easiest to discuss."
"Three new voice messages from Gary. You should listen to them before you go." John froze for a moment at the sound of the man's voice coming from behind him, eventually leaning back and sitting down on the concrete ledge on the edge of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital, wondering if he should see why Detective Lestrade called or just get back up and throw himself from the roof. Finally he sighed and gave in, hopping off of the ledge and heading back over the roof where he had left his phone in his shoes covered with his jacket. The man who spoke was sitting next to the shoes with a slightly amused look on his face and his head tilted forward to let blood drip from his hair onto the ground. "I knew you would listen to them. It is quite pointless actually, those messages won't make you feel any better in the long run." The man looked back to the edge of the building. "Or more accurately, the next few minutes."
Mrs. Hudson kissed him lightly on the forehead, tearing up. “You do whatever you need to Dear, just don’t go leaving me alone again. Your life is much too important to me.”
He closed his eyes, taking a few deep breaths because he knew his heart was beating fast. Not because of Janine, no, but because his chest felt like it was going to implode due to the insane amount of pain he was going through. He was breathing heavily and his breath hitched whenever she touched his arms. Attempting to keep the movement of his chest to a minimum so he didn't start bleeding again, he let Janine kiss him wherever she wanted despite how uncomfortable he was. When she tried to go further down, Sherlock stopped her. "No. No. It hurts too much." His eyes rolled back in his head and legs gave out as his head felt like it was spinning out of control.
John smiled softly. "Being back. Being a hero again. You can't tell me you won't miss it in law school or playing the violin in Chicago."
"Okay."
"Okay, it was a man." Apparently he wasn't as good at keeping secrets as he had hoped. "Well, we talked for a bit as friends and he… trusted me. I swear, we were just supposed to stay that way, I didn't mean to kiss him, it just happened. We were both drunk out of our minds and I was just a little bit depressed and we were getting along so well that I ended up ruining everything. We ended up… having, um… you know…"
We'll go through a fight or two -- No harm, no harm….’ “
He tried energy drinks, but they upset his stomach. He tried drinking powdered chili pepper in water, popping ginseng capsules, rubbing his temples with lavender and mint balm. He tried Midol. He would have tried one of Mrs. Hudson’s herbal soothers but she refused to share.
“Oh yessss. There is that.”
Nods at the man in the mirror. Nods at me.
“No one’s paying us any attention.”
“If you had your way, John, we’d be dancing to The Specials all night long.”
“Yes, I might say that.”
He blurted out: “Sherlock, you’re missing a page here, did you know?”
“So why don’t we have a song?” John asked while they were doing the dishes after tea.
“Sherlock, I don’t really need to learn how to drive. I’m perfectly happy taking cabs and the Tube.”
In the morning, after Sherlock had unlocked the bedroom door and emerged from his self-imposed humiliation exile, he found John in the kitchen eating a greasy fry-up and looking none the worse for his late night. Sherlock shot him a look of disgust while searching for something to ease his hangover.
John immediately bristled. “You have a problem with The Specials, mate? Because if you do…”
JOHN WILL YOU PLEASE STOP THESE ODIOUS TEXTS.
“This is not a date, it’s a stake-out.”
“YOU…COCK! You trolled me, you utter fucking wanker!” John shouted. Sherlock only laughed harder and tried to embrace him, but John was having none of that and slapped him away. “I should just punch you straight in the face.”
He rose slowly, and wearily beckoned with both hands: "All right, Sherlock - come on, let's go. Get this apology over with."
“Noooooooo!” he cried out. “IT’S RUINED!”
“… OH, IT’S CHRISTMAS!!”
“So that’s what you were doing all day,” John said. “All right, I'm impressed.”
"You're not my petri dish. You're a man, and a human being, and you are my love, my conscience, my other half. My better half. You did nothing to deserve that. And I would not have you angry with me for all the world.”
“Not exactly. Cornflower, cyan…cobalt?”
“Just been lying there all day, have you?" John said irritably. "No time to do any shopping I suppose. Ta." Still angry, apparently.
“I’m lost without my coat,” Sherlock said mournfully.
Sherlock began moving his body with a more circular motion and John let out an involuntary moan, which made Sherlock add a bit of head bobbing to his increasingly energetic arm movements. John’s breath came faster and faster as he joined in the rhythmic shifting to and fro.
"Yes, I do. It’s time for some serious catching-up."
“Why not? I’d buy her some new washing-up gloves.”
"So, two dead and one who’s still alive. Are you searching for him? "
“And 30 seconds of very unscientific bliss with the man I love. I only regret I took such a roundabout way to get there.”
"My apologies too often fall short - you always say." Sherlock avoided the reproach in John’s stern blue eyes.
With much resentful huffing, Sherlock put it on and then twisted, spun, rotated, revolved and pirouetted about the sitting room, causing the shoulder cape to flap feebly about his shoulders like the wings of an ungainly bird.
‘Join me in a dram?” John asked, holding the decanter aloft.
Sherlock, hot on his heels, shouted: “John! NO!”
“What is it.”
“SHERLOCK! NO MORE, PLEASE!”
"Here's a little-known scientific fact for you. The average human being will spend two full weeks of his or her life kissing."
John leaned over and purred in his ear: “J’ai envie de t’embrasser.” [
“John?
“Song lyrics, John. Some lovely, romantic lyrics about stardust.”
“What the hell is that fucking NOISE?”
“Never mind, Sherlock, just – please get on with it.”
“Sherlock, about this wedding invitation…”
Sherlock opened the bottle and set free the aromatic scents of citrus, spices and woods to float around the sitting room. He dabbed a bit of it under his lapels and pocket flaps. Then he smiled and executed a gleeful, graceful coat twirl.
“John, please. You’re disrupting my blogging process.”
“OW!” Sherlock shouted, grabbing his face. “You bit me!”
Despite the conspicuous lack of imagination and, well….taste…. John’s inelegant attempt to pay tribute to their relationship was rather touching. Pity it was so full of stale sentiment, but on the other hand his heart was in the right place. Sherlock felt a sudden flame of deep affection for his devoted, resolute soldier and doctor with the soul of a poet. Well, the soul of an aspiring pop songwriter, at any rate.
“Hm?”
“ ‘Marry me a little, Love me just enough.
“No! But John, what it needs is some olfactory rehabilitation - that will restore its former glory!”
“Oh God yes.”
“I MEAN IT! STOPPPPPPPP!!!”
“All this is not enough of a buzz for you?”
“John, an hour of resentful silence is beneath you.”
“It’s…pink.”
“John, Bach’s Violin Sonata No. 1 is not dance music.”
John threw down the newspaper, stood up and stripped off his shirt, displaying the regimental tattoo on his muscular right shoulder.
“The truth is, John, I did the laundry but I didn't notice that red sweatshirt you just bought was in the hamper. I threw all the clothes in together, and…well, chemical processes and shrinkage and color transference being what they are…”
“Oh, never mind, Sherlock…”
“They’re not horses, they’re ponies.”
And God only knew what it suffered on the morning Sherlock took it to Bart’s morgue.
John put his hand over Sherlock's, which was busy worrying a loose strand of yarn on John’s jumper.
Sherlock then refused to speak to him until tea time, when John reached across the table and put a dab of jam on his nose. “Tu seras mon dessert ce soir.” [
“Sherlock, I don’t understand. How…?”
Nothing could satisfy Sherlock - he continued to be a bloody-minded git and to swan around in his dressing gown wallowing in his misery. John gave up trying to please him and slept on the far side of the bed with a pillow over his head to muffle all the plaintive sighs.
“French humour – an oxymoron if ever there was one,” Sherlock snorted.
“That’s nearly the color of my new tie.”
“Sherlock, I….tufjhdiohzz…”
LET’S RUN OFF TO CORNWALL AND GET MARRIED.
“ ‘Marry me a little, Body, heart, and soul.
“Sherlock, you are not literally a sausage – although may I say that in some respects you are quite round, firm and fully-packed. Don’t you find that complimentary?”
“That was unnecessarily cruel, John.”
Once John left for work, Sherlock reached underneath the sofa cushions and brought forth his latest experiment. It was nothing that could be kept in the fridge, stuck under the microscope, cooked in the microwave or dissected with a scalpel – although sharp pointed instruments were certainly involved.
John looked up briefly from his newspaper and said, “That’s nice,” and went back to reading.
“John, I promise you will never need to feel cold in bed ever again.”
"A few seconds of your time, John, and I won't ask for anything beyond that. Just accommodate me in this and there is no further obligation."
"Quickly, John! Tell me how you feel."
“Sherlock, it had to be done. It was beginning to fall apart – it needed mending, the buttons were nearly off, the hem was falling out. That bullet hole required reweaving. And there were those…stains.”
“Sherlock, I like guns, not internal combustion engines.”
“I don’t know whether you’ve noticed, Sherlock, but we’re in the middle of a drugs bust, most of Lestrade’s division is tearing the flat apart, your phone is ringing incessantly, Mrs. Hudson is nattering on about something or other, there’s a strange man standing in the hall, and…”
John came around the table and sat down on Sherlock's lap, and put his arms around his neck.
“Uh, what about your thigh...”
John’s miniscule supply of patience was rapidly depleted by Sherlock's moping, his refusal to eat, and his disinterest in pursuing any new cases.
“No, dear, I gave the last of mine to John when he was looking for something to nibble on. Would a sesame and fig bite do?”
Okay, then.
“Yes, but you’re here and my coat’s not.”
“The back seat of a taxi is not the most private place in London.”
“You’re a doctor, stop being so – “
(delete)
Sherlock whirled on him and John put up his hands defensively.
Sherlock gradually gave up his stiffly defensive posture and his stroppy attitude, and relaxed into John’s embrace.
“Actually, it wasn’t. But thank you for confirming it.”
Much later:
But something still nagged at John: why had he kept this such a secret? Sherlock loved to boast of his baritsu skills, his head-butting prowess, his narrow escapes from death and dismemberment. And…Greece? When had Sherlock ever been in Greece? And Irene Adler definitely didn't want to kill him, she wanted to…
“Well now I have no pants to wear.”
“You want a birthday poem?” John asked. “All right, I’ll give you one:
“All those people in that bus seem rather interested.”
“John, learning to drive is so simple, I can teach you in five minutes.”
"You. Did. WHAT." John's voice dropped to a malevolent growl.
“Dammit Sherlock. You promised me you were quitting those fucking things. They’ll kill you! And think of your TEETH. Spit them out.” He held out his hand.
"John, I…. I do understand how I've hurt you, although what I was trying to do to was..."
“What, John.”
Let’s see, how long should sleeves be? Long enough to roll up, he decided, so that John could keep them out of his soup and the dishwater and any corrosive experiments. Knit knit knit. Good lord this was boring. He turned on the telly for some crap daytime diversion. Oh look, a Who’s Your Baby Daddy marathon. Well, this one's far too obvious, that bloke with the Hoxton Fin...
“Sherlock, that looks like a load of doll’s clothing. Pink doll’s clothing. And is that my best dress shirt…”
John closed his eyes, exhaled slowly, counted to 10 and then said, “Sherlock, we’ve been all over that tattoo issue and it’s not happening.”
“No danger,“ Sherlock said thickly. The whisky was having its effect on him too, but in quite the opposite manner: he spoke slowly, deliberately, with strong emphasis on each word.
“Happy birthday, Sherlock.” John handed him an envelope.
“It...was.”
“You what?!”
“So happy. Happy. Sherlo…frorithjzzz.”
Meanwhile Sherlock, still struggling with his tongue, attempted to say: “It was the WASP that assaulted me!” but he was drowned out by John’s relentless cackling.
“All right, Miss Marple, let’s not get carried away here.”
John, however, was aghast.
John laughed. “No, Sherlock, that was me. I took your coat.”
Sherlock speed-walked next door to the deli and snatched a packet from the display next to the cash register. Ahhhhh. He dropped his money on the counter and went home to conclude his experiment.
But at the 5-second mark John began to thaw, just the slightest bit: Sherlock felt him relax and drop his shoulders. As Sherlock began nibbling very gently on his lower lip, John's heart began beating faster.
“Well, when’s it coming back?! I need my coat!”
“John, believe me. ..when I say… it was one of the defining moments….of my LIFE.” He nodded emphatically.
We'll keep unsaid… ‘ “
“NO!”
However, John wasn't inclined to express his love for Sherlock with such romantic gestures: the stoic Captain Watson's deepest feelings were demonstrated in gifts of service, loyalty, steadfastness and bravery. John followed Sherlock into the darkest, most dangerous places without a thought for himself, risked his life and health (and sanity) daily, and believed in Sherlock in times when everyone else turned away. But there were no flowers, no sweets, no Valentines. And John was utter balls at gift-buying, forever doing his Christmas shopping in Tesco at the very last minute, or picking up some daft thing at the corner newsagent.
“Wrong? How could a cupcake be ‘wrong’?”
“By my count you have mentioned my eyes 1,458 times thus far, not including the times you’ve insisted on discussing my sectoral heterochromia, my periorbital hyperpigmentation or my incipient blepharoptosis.”
“Oh I don’t know, Sherlock. Go to sleep.”
“I did no such thing.”
Sherlock folded his long arms around John and the mutant potholder.
“It’s stylish.”
Sherlock silently cut up his egg and toast, looking as though he wished John could be called away to a medical emergency. Immediately.
“For instance,” John continued, ignoring him. “ ’Avoir le cul borde des nouilles’ means ‘to have the ass full of noodles’. In other words, to be very lucky.”
“A special treat for tea, Sherlock,” John said.
“N’inporte quoi,” John said with an expressive shrug. “Tourne la page.” [
“Maybe you’d rather I called you ‘Fopdoodle’? ‘Fustilarian’? ‘Cumberworld’?!”
“That’s not funny.”
Sherlock lay wakeful and preoccupied, his fingers tented and tapping against one another. Faint illumination from the streetlight filtered into the bedroom and an insistent little breath of cold air leaked in through the loose window frame. He stared at the ceiling and turned over and over in his mind the case of the previous day.
, you might shut up long enough for me to enjoy it! And even that didn't slow you down!"
And then John bit him squarely on the nose.
“It’s so deliciously….pointy.”
John huffed. “Perhaps that would work if your upper arms were more developed, but since the only workout they ever get is lifting a tea mug...”
“I don’t think calling you ‘ducky’ is extreme.”
“YOU….knitted something? For me?”
“I don’t …dhsktnzzz.”
“Well, er…you, uh…it’s a dance – sort of – that is, an erotic dance or…um, striptease performed by, er… sitting on the lap of…well...” John subsided into silence and blushes.
I will never tire of letting him observe me.
I catch him looking into my eyes again, and he quickly looks away - adjusts his scarf, fidgets the buttons on his coat. It’s a game we play.
(send text/Y)
“I think, er.... I don't know what I think...Oh! Well, perhaps...”
“SHERLOCK YOU STOP THIS RIGHT NOOOOOWWWWWW!”
“…All right, so what if I did. I slept with your shirt because I missed you.”
“How romantic of you to point that out.”
Finishing his blog post, Sherlock snapped the laptop shut and headed down the hall to the bedroom for a proper nap.
Then Sherlock slowly, gradually began to rock from side to side on John’s lap, humming faintly to some internal tune. John found the sensations quite pleasurable, and he closed his eyes and began to enjoy himself. This was not nearly as unsexy as he’d feared.
“Then could you possibly explain what all that was about?”
“What are you eating. Are those Malteasers? Spit them out RIGHT NOW.”
“I swear I will never eat Branston pickle before bed again. Tossed and turned all night. Probably talked in my sleep too, sorry about that.”
“Of course I’ve had it cleaned! Mrs. Hudson usually works miracles with her clothes-steamer and something she calls ‘Persil’.”
Sherlock finally raised his eyes, contrite.
“But I UNDERSTAND formaldehyde!” Sherlock shouted.
Drifting from the speakers was a dreamy, jazzy composition with a romantic vocal backed by  the warm underlying notes of a saxophone.
John’s brain was operating much more acutely than Sherlock's, and he considered the case so far: Sherlock had been attacked by 3 assailants, 2 of whom were dead – he escaped with an injury – and now after an interval of many years, some murderous woman was still out there waiting to complete the fatal task. ‘The Return of the Greek Assassin’: his blog post was nearly writing itself!
“Nope.”
“WHAT, John.”
to you?"
Furthermore, doesn’t he know the color of my eyes by now? I’m not the one with eyes like the infinite blue of the heavens…. Hmmph.
“Tell me what you want.”
“Jesus. Why do I put up with you, you are such a fucking annoying prat.”
John returned from work the following day to an empty flat: Sherlock was nowhere to be found. As he walked through the kitchen he stepped on something hard and crunchy – one of those damned things lay crushed under his shoe. Well, at least that was one less for Sherlock.
“I’d like to pay a cab driver to tie it to his bonnet and drive it around London for a day, to instill all the petrol smells and soot and detritus of the city into its threads again.”
John’s laughter filled the kitchen, bounced off the walls, pounded Sherlock's ears. He sat stony-faced as he always did on the rare occasions when John laughed AT him - silent and resentful. Finally he assumed his usual defensive, elaborately-unconcerned expression. “John, I think my little joke has escaped you entirely,” he said stiffly. “Nevertheless, thank you for your thoughtful gift.”
“Edema – boring.”
“An experiment.” Well, it was….of a sort.
During the rest of the day, John took exceptional glee in sneaking up on Sherlock and whispering some filthy little phrase in his ear, then enjoying his slow burn of annoyance. Oh, that pouty face! John felt he was finally putting paid to all those times when Sherlock had flaunted his fund of esoteric knowledge. Sodding showoff.
“What about Wonderwall?” John said from the kitchen while making the tea.
“You’re grinding the gears. Don’t do that. Just…”
“Now this is your own fault, Sherlock, you shouldn’t have been snooping in my laptop,” John said, still chuckling.
“STOP. I mean it. Just stop it this minute. Now go put that back, I’ll sterilize it later. Better yet, just keep it and I’ll buy myself a new one.”
Two weeks passed. Sherlock said nothing.
“Sherlock - did you hear something?”
“…Driver, once more around the block, SLOWLY! And John, do you have another 20 quid?”
“We did that already. Now I just want a story.”
“Fruit fool.”
“And I have never divulged this to any man. Until tonight.” Sherlock looked searchingly at John. “I trust this will remain between us.”
After a cuppa and a half-slice of toast (which he simply played with until he reduced it to crumbs), Sherlock was somewhat quieter but still sullen.
“John, please. I just let the joke go too far, and… all right, that was quite unkind of me. And yes – you did a brilliant job. Very, very sexy.”
10 seconds... Sherlock drew John’s lower lip into his mouth and rolled his tongue over it; John’s arms fell to his sides and his eyes closed as his body responded involuntarily to Sherlock's kiss.
Finally he said quietly, "Didn't you get any pleasure out of that? At all? It was just…
“Until further notice, John, I am ignoring ALL of your voicemails, particularly those with heavy breathing,” Sherlock announced with real irritation.
“No, everyone’s looking.”
“If I what?” John purred, fixing Sherlock with his steel-blue gaze.
Thus John came home to find a serene and relaxed Sherlock lying on the sofa in his Thinking Position.
"And then I just let you have your way with me?" John answered, with a humorless laugh. "Sod off."
“A tattoo.”
“Problem?”
“Or maybe Mrs. Hudson could, I don’t know, spray it with something.”
"Hypothesis proven."
We won't have to give up a thing, We'll stay who we are.
John marched right over and took him by the chin.
I'm ready!
“In my coat,” Sherlock said.
John stirred, mumbling something about the morgue. Sherlock irritably nudged him with his foot.
Well now. That was actually rather virile when one came right down to it: “Standing strong…pointing toward eternity…” Awkwardly expressed, of course, but not exactly something one would write to a girlfriend.
“Like me,” Sherlock said, as he affectionately ruffled John’s hair.
Knit knit knit. There, that was probably sufficient. Sherlock held up the sleeves. Not quite the same length, but who would notice when they were rolled up? Although it seemed the sleeves had used up more yarn than anticipated – Sherlock briefly wondered whether there would be enough left for the rest of the jumper, even one made to fit a compact man like John. Well, yarn stretched, didn't it? Never mind, crack on!
John flexed his knees and knelt astride Sherlock's lap, moving forward and back, teasing Sherlock with the closeness and the heat of his body.
“Do you want to know what I really want for Valentine’s Day, Sherlock?”
“Quite a lot of blue there.”
And when John felt extra-chilly during the night, he found the coat hanging out of the open bathroom window absorbing the currents of vehicular air that drifted down Baker Street.
“John, you are disturbing the entire street with this vocal recital. Mrs. Hudson will be pounding on the ceiling with her broom again.”
After some restless readjusting John sighed and muttered Sherlock's name. Sherlock exhaled with mild annoyance: John was not the quietest of bedmates, even when asleep.
“Sherlock, you could always buy another coat to wear in the meantime.”
Sherlock sighed, put his glass to his lips, realized it was empty and set it down again.
“Get. Out.”
Look at him. The relaxed posture but the wary eyes of a feral cat. That superior brain churning behind the tranquil façade. I will never tire of being observed by him.
“Painting. Perhaps indigo, or sapphire…”
“I realize you are struggling to comprehend a complex human behaviour –“
“There was no one at the door.”
“Rib cage?”
Sherlock abruptly dropped his arms and pulled away from John, who stumbled at the sudden absence of support. Then he whipped out his pocket notebook and began to scribble.
“What?”
But when he came in with the tea tray, he found John standing in front of the sofa with a long piece of multicolored yarn in his hands, slowly drawing it from between the cushions. Hand over hand he pulled, as a pile of crinkled yarn slowly collected around his feet. Yarn yarn yarn. Sherlock froze – all of his beautiful knitting coming unraveled! John kept pulling.
JE SUIS FOU DE TOI [
“That repugnant word, anyway: ‘Cupcake.’  Reminds me far too much of Mycroft.”
“ ‘Marry me a little, Do it with a will.
“I’ll wager I can guess what that one’s about…but you’re still not getting any,” Sherlock said sullenly, and flopped over on the sofa again.
“What’s that, a poem?”
“It’s very mechanical. You like mechanical things.”
“ ‘Smell right’ - what?!”
By the end of the afternoon Sherlock decided the sleeve was probably long enough.
“When were you going to tell me about this?!”
“Yes, John.”
“Sherlock! Just shut it! You are a fucking wanker.”
I AM NO MAN’S SWEET PEA. STOP THIS.
“I'm sorry, but I’m finding this almost too difficult to believe. Are you sure I’m getting the whole story here?” He fixed Sherlock with his keen bullshit-detecting gaze.
Sherlock got over it by spending the night on the sofa.
John clasped Sherlock closer, and felt Sherlock’s answering pressure. Their dance became a long, swaying embrace.
YOU ARE MY ONLY LOVE, I WANT TO MARRY YOU ASAP.
“Oh, very well, John, you can stop flattering me now. Ready?  ‘In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London…’ “
John was not quite sure what to think. But he did know what to say.
“Oh! Here’s an idea,” Sherlock said sarcastically. “Why don’t you wear one too, and we can speed all over London on a cycle with a little sidecar. You’d ride in the sidecar, of course.”
John felt Sherlock's long body relax into his as they danced. How could he possibly forget that smile, on the evening of the day they met: the smile that turned Sherlock's angular face into a poignant combination of hesitation, happiness and hope. The firm clasp of his hand. His careless assumption that whatever he asked or demanded, John would consent and follow.
(delete)
“Boring. Now come on!”
But John refused to let up. “Oi, Onion-Bum!” he said cheerfully. "So your mum is the mystery woman you keep an eye on? Wait till the next time I see her!"
Sherlock sighed with remorse.
He opened his eyes to find Sherlock gyrating on him in a flamboyant display of…what the hell?
" - I know you're furious with me...” Sherlock continued in his special calm and condescending tone.
“John, that’s….terrible…er, terribly sweet.”
“There’s this song by The Arctic Monkeys...” John called down the stairwell as Sherlock opened the front door.
The only sounds in the flat during that that very long, quiet and resentful day were the clicking of keyboards, the ticking of a clock, the occasional hiss of the kettle.
When John Watson was in a good mood he liked to sing. He moved around the flat singing in his light baritone while making tea in the kitchen, tidying up the bedroom, classifying Sherlock's vast collection of books. Most of the time he didn't even realize he was doing it aloud, and most of the time Sherlock simply smiled with amusement.
Not to mention that head in the fridge incident
“John, I see no reason to stir from my own comfortable hearth for anything less than a double homicide with extraordinary circumstances. Certainly not for the dubious privilege of attending some pompous aristo mating rite in Brompton Oratory.”
“Full-frontal snogging under a shock blanket, what next.”
Days flew by. Sherlock became entirely too immersed in watching Hollyoaks. Knit knit knit. The jumper was progressing quickly enough, but when Lestrade phoned the project was jammed back into the sofa cushions again. It lay wadded up under there for several days before it was retrieved, covered with random sofa crumbs and fuzz. Then as Sherlock energetically shook it, out the knitting needles went flying – and by the time he’d wasted all that time turning the flat upside down to find them, it was difficult to tell exactly where he’d left off. He would simply have to guess. Knit knit knit. There. Back on track. Once John saw his new jumper, he’d forget all about the ruined one. At any rate, this one was certainly much more cheerful with all its bright colors.
Sherlock had given up the cigarettes long ago, but now that the nicotine patches irritated his skin, he had decided to try going cold turkey (again) and vanquish his dependence issues once and for all. John was so proud of him.
Violets are blue,
“Those are new pants, aren't they.”
“Stop that, now, you’ll unravel me.”
“It’s surprisingly comfortable.”
But before very long Sherlock craved both the intense high and the relative calm that came with satisfying his addiction; now there were no soothing mood changes to anticipate, no flashes of substance-induced insight, and he didn't know what to do with his hands.
"So that wasn't really an apology? THAT part was the experiment??"
"How could you ever think that ghastly dog’s dinner was a poem?”
Sherlock's new project occupied most of the next two days. The coat - and John - were subjected to numerous inconveniences and insults.
“Sherlock, there is always tea. Even if there are NO CLEAN PANTS. Do you EVER intend to do the laundry?”
So he responded with exaggerated courtesy and that patient, dangerous smile: "All right, Sherlock, what can I do to help bring this extremely unpleasant evening to an end, and I do mean an END. Just tell me what you want me to do."
“I fail to see how you can even focus when your forehead is pressed so closely against mine that our eyelashes are tangled.”
And then fell back coughing and wheezing from the noxious fumes.
SHERLOCK I WANT YOU TO BE MY HUSBAND.
“Oh. Yes, I tore one out and used it as a bookmark. Although now I can’t find that book I put it in. Annoying. No matter, there are still plenty of pages left.”
John groaned. “Sherlock, did you miss the part where I said ‘erotic’?”
“Come on, guess.”
"Killed him."
“Maybe never. I admit that I quite fancy the idea of you going commando all the time.”
“GET OUT!” Sherlock watched John flinch then leave the flat silently.
"John! Oh thank god." Lestrade sounded out of breath as if he had been running and he sighed with relief at the sound of John's voice. "Where are you? Why aren't you at your flat at this time of night? Are you alright? John?"
John nodded, agreeing. "Yeah."
Sherlock smiled, his eyes closing gently as he pressed his lips against John's head. "It is."
Hot tears.
Sherlock sat down on his chair, crossing his legs and pressing his hands together under his chin, relaxing his body.
Sherlock hopped from step to step after John, counting each step that he bounced down. “I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean. I was the first consulting detective and now I’ve retired. There's nothing I could really do now.”
Mrs. Hudson had jumped right back into conversation with Mary once Sherlock left the room and they began to talk about wedding dates. "Oh, I’m really pleased, Mary. Have you set a date?"
Theo smiled. “Oh, there are plenty of ways.”
the British government.”
I nodded and replied, “I think it would be better for me to learn how you guys speak, seeing as I don’t think everyone here will be as gracious as you to cater to my…um…more or less butchered English as Sherlock says.”
John smiled and said, “Absolutely feel free to come by anytime we are home. If you have any concerns or questions, don’t hesitate to ask us if Sherlock is not willing to answer them I most certainly could.”
I sighed, “You’ve changed Bill.”
I looked over at John, asking, “Like footie pajamas or something?”
His voice was smooth and rich like expensive dark chocolate, and I found myself at a loss for a response and stupidly stuttered out, “Y-you look a lot d-different than last time.”
Sherlock gave a curt nod and turned to walk out of the building John sighing and following after him. I grabbed my suitcase and ascended the step in hopes this was all a big misunderstanding, and Mabel was perfectly fine, but several factors told me this was wishful thinking, and when mysterious shit happened around a Pines, you can bet things were anything but fine.
My heart skipped a minor beat, but I tried to keep the shock off my face and said, “He does sound like an odd character, but honestly, I would assume with it being October it was probably some idiot dressed up in his Halloween costume trying not to get caught. If it’s okay with you I would have no problem paying rent here and keeping my sisters flat clean as well as keeping an eye on it in case that punk comes back.”
Suddenly everything around me slowed to a stop, and the environment took on a pale muted pink color when I found myself pinned to the patrol car by a full demon Theo who smiled devilishly “Now I am having second thoughts about letting William have you cause now you have presented yourself as my type…the mouthy twink.”
He turned to leave when another voice was heard from the stairs yelling, “Sherlock, I told you to wait!”
Sherlock chuckled. “Sounds like Mycroft when he’s dealing with his secretary.”
I lifted an eyebrow, “Not that I recall I never really analyzed the statue nobody had the nerve to touch it after Weirdmageddon.”
He turned to face me his mouth slightly turned downward making his once neutral expression take on a hint of suspicion “A young woman in the flat next to mine was handing out hand-knitted clothing I happen to refuse causing her to be stubborn and insist I accept a hand-knitted scarf when she made the observation mine was “falling apart at the seams” and it was hard to deny the quality of her knitting as well as get my flatmate to discontinue telling me how “rude” I was to the young lady, so I accepted it out of a gesture of politeness.”
-Dipper is touchy about people bad mouthing Ford research or his achievements.
He started to the door, and I had seconds to process what he said and started after him sputtering as I shut the flat door behind me “What? Why? I just met you. No offense I’m not the kind of person to accept help that is just thrown at me by a stranger I mean how the hell do I know I can trust you for all I know and again no offense, but you and John could be dangerous or untrustworthy in the long run though I highly doubt it since my sister would actively talk to both of you, and she has an excellent judge of character that seems almost invasive on many levels but still where is my time to get comfortable with you?”
I looked at him sheepishly, “I took kickboxing for several years to learn how to defend myself. I’m sorry you just really startled me. I didn’t hear you come in, and I have a bad habit of striking first asking questions later when people sneak up on me.”
Ch.3 Throwing Logic out the Window.
Again this man was fucking creepy, but like always, he was correct, making me respond. “I figured someone had taken her, and I have a theory who did it but no certainties though I know where I think I should start looking.”
The flight felt like it was going to drag on forever. I was unsure how long I could stay sitting fiddling with the sparkly postcard when we finally landed I had to control myself from launching myself out of my seat and off the plane the busy London streets calling out to me in a foreboding manner. I grabbed my bags, walking along the sidewalk of the airport, quickly texting Grunkle Ford that I had made it to London safely getting a relieved text back and a request to keep him updated on my sister's weird behavior. He hadn’t been able to come with me due to him and Grunkle Stan being in Australia when I got the strange postcard. I had received it two days ago telling me to hurry to London with no other explanation other than I needed to make it there quickly. Mabel had been studying abroad to see new places. After almost a year post graduating, she had found a college in London that she managed to get a rather prestigious scholarship that allowed her to attend without paying the ridiculous amount of money out of pocket. After completing her classes, she decided to stay an extra month before coming home, but a week before she arrived home, I received this postcard, which almost made it sound like she was in trouble. I caught a cab and had them take me to the address on the postcard.
Ms. Hudson smiled softly “Of course dear I will let you ride out the three month’s rent she put down before I start pestering you for money
I made myself dinner using the food in the house, knowing Mabel wouldn’t mind and hoping she was okay. I sat down and watched television for a couple of hours, finding nothing eye-grabbing on and finally clicked the flat screen off and moved to the guest room, not having the emotional strength to sleep amongst Mabel’s things cause that was asking for a night of bad dreams. I laid down curling up in the blanket dozing off when I felt a weird feeling like something wasn’t right, followed by the sweet smell of cinnamon, which I had never smelled in Mabel’s flat before.
Dipper looked back with a smile that was equal parts confident and cocky, saying, “I got a couple tricks up my sleeve that should protect me. If you guys want, I can safeguard your flat too. I should have enough supplies, I mean, I never travel unprepared.”
Bill sighed, “If I did Pinetree, she would be safe already whatever took her knows how to cover its tracks to almost an inhuman detail.”
I looked back at him in surprise, “Didn’t know you had a mom.”
As much as I tried to fight the pull of darkness, it held fast and dragged me under consuming me rapidly in a matter of mere minutes.
"NO. I am not your fucking science experiment!" John gave up on the idea of tea and threw himself into his chair.
Of course John knew all the dirty French stuff – those are the first things any schoolboy learns, and John had made good use of this knowledge in his younger days (well, he’d gotten a few face slaps too, but on average his technique had seemed to work well in pubs and at Uni parties). He could not wait to try it on with Sherlock.
“Your…FACE!” Sherlock managed to gasp out before breaking into great bellows. His body was seized with physical spasms of hilarity that bounced John about on his thighs, while John simply sat there bouncing and burning with fury.
JE VEUX PASSER MA VIE AVEC TOI [
“Sherlock, we’re in a MORGUE.”
“You’re right, Sherlock, my thinking was flawed indeed. It took me far too long to see that my love for you was real cause of all those shipwrecked romances. You’re my constant, my polar star. You’re why I’m here. And whatever you want of me, you may have – flaws and all.” John wound one of Sherlock's curls around his finger and pulled him down for a kiss.
“Truce?”
“ABSOLUTELY NOT!”
And because Sherlock - all evidence to the contrary - was human as well. And because human nature is inherently faulty and imperfect. And because, despite the great analytical brain he possessed, it was perhaps too easy to overlook the part of Sherlock Holmes that was still an awkward 12-year-old full of unfamiliar feelings and frightening emotions, whose best friend was his chemistry set and who found all of his answers about life in science books.
“Well, YOU eat them!”
“What did you just say?”
“To hide his booty.”
“Why do I need to learn how to drive. YOU know how to drive.”
“...Jeudi, Vendredi…”
Sherlock began typing, wondering what had suddenly inspired John to such heights of literary mediocrity. Then he smiled. His birthday was just days away, and since John was quite observant about birthdays, this poem was obviously meant for him. He pictured himself and John standing high atop one of the granite piles that dotted the Devon moors, looking out over the countryside. Up there the air was fresh, the morning light soft, and the wind ruffled their hair. Apparently John had some very fond memories of their adventures in Dartmoor.
“Is that my toothbrush?!”
Want me first and foremost, Keep me company.
Now John was nearly beside himself with anxiety.
"John, you are extremely skilled at communicating the exact level of your displeasure, most often by the relative force with which you slam the bedroom door."
“Er, John, thank you, but…. all of my personal care products are …”
Sherlock turned away and sinuously waggled his bottom at John.
"Oh all right, John, “ he said crossly. “But may I remind you, curiosity killed the….the….camel.”
“Your code-breaking skills could use some work -  what more pleasant way than this?”
He heard John coming down the hall and slapped the laptop shut.
"I am not concerned about my sperm count."
“Am I forgiven then? Shall I move back into the bedroom tonight?”
Then John ambushed him as Sherlock changed his shirt:
“Cheers, Mr. Johann Sebastian Snob.”
“She was the one who invited me to the theatre, she adores musicals. This one’s her favorite.
Sherlock fixed John with his serious stare and slowly unbuckled his belt, letting his fine Italian trousers drop to the floor.
“John, although you know that I love to dance and have acquired more than adequate skill in both traditional ballroom and ballet dance forms, I must confess that I know little about folk dancing. But if it will make you happy, then I am very willing to learn more.”
“Happy birthday, Sherlock my love.”
The music stopped. Sherlock and John stopped. And for an immeasurable moment in 221B Baker Street, time stopped too.
“No, Sherlock.”
"Sherlock, that is the last time I will EVER go to the cinema with you."
“Should I turn the skull to face the wall?”
“John?”
Sherlock stripped off his silky shirt and displayed his creamy-white and woefully underdeveloped arms.
Not much better but time was limited, and it was his night to cook.
“Sherlock…come over here this instant and I will give you one tattoo you will never ever forget.”
"No. Although as I said, it's absurdly easy to make you angry - unfortunately I simply do it without thinking. Most of the time.” The corner of Sherlock's mouth twitched. “But often I don't know what to do to make you NOT angry with me."
Might it possibly refer to their memorable interlude in Switzerland in the edelweiss meadow…
“John, kiss me.”
“Yes, that sounds entirely plausible.”
Sherlock slowly lifted the cushion and regarded John with terrible patience.
“Sherlock, you always laughed so mercilessly at my poetry. And you ridiculed the flowers, the Valentines – what else was I to think? You were not the most demonstrative of men either, at least in my experience. God forbid I should embarrass you with any sticky displays of affection. So I just suppressed all those foolish impulses to fill your pockets with love notes and cover the bed with rose petals.”
Sherlock seemed happy to see him (and the curry). He was still wearing his coat, and John good-naturedly remarked: “I see we’ll be three for tea this evening”.
“Yeah, that is the most fucking annoying part. You’re not ticklish.”
On the afternoon of the third day he heard Sherlock's step on the stairs and turned warily, dreading to see the human wreck now destroyed by the twin demons of his chemical and emotional addictions. John bitterly blamed himself for the part he’d played in bringing down his great love Sherlock Holmes, through his own foolish self-indulgence and incorrigible sweet tooth….
“Oh for fu…..” Sherlock groaned.
“Sherlock? Just stuff it right up your elegant arse. Sideways.”
“Just look at you, you idiot. Lying there flat on your back covered in bandages, zonked on painkillers, because you would NOT listen. Oh no, the great Sherlock Holmes always works alone! Why the hell would you listen to ME, I’m only a soldier with years of training. By all means, just go barging right through, no worries, I’ll be standing back here with our only firearm…
As Sherlock entered the kitchen, John turned on him: "And for your information, Mr. Exposition..."
Sherlock waited impatiently for John to leave for work in the morning, before rushing to check on the progress of “his” poem.
“Why don't you come with me. We could have a pants date. You know, where two people who like each other go out, have fun….buy new underpants together?”
“John, for so many years the only pair of cold feet in my bed belonged to me. But now I must warn you for what must be the thousandth time - if you insist on placing those freezing plates of meat of yours on my balls again, I’m going to…make you wear socks.”
“I was in a relationship with my coat
“It’s, uh…you know, that song…”
“John, kiss me.”
“That’s what ambulances are for.”
15 seconds... By now John was making contented little sounds (Sherlock loved those little sounds) and his hands rested on Sherlock's waist. When Sherlock escalated the pressure and added a little body English, John’s knees trembled.
“How sentimental you are, John.”
“You’re going to try fly spray?”
“Besides, John, nothing sparks romance like a tickle fight. Amongst adults, the tickle battle often becomes sexual foreplay.”
Out of the companionable silence John spoke: “Sherlock….tell me something you've never told anyone else before.”
“I definitely have voicemail,“ John said triumphantly, and turned up the volume on his mobile so that Sherlock's recorded voice filled the cab with song: “It’s very clear, our love is here to stay…”
He pretended to stroke something off John’s mouth, first with his thumb, then with his lips.
“I simply smell like myself, John, but if you find that pleasant then thank you.”
“Expiration date? Saturated fat content?”
Worse yet, if he had found it and the answer was No…
“Kiss please.”
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asked.
“Sherlock, you are going to have to choose: it’s either me, or a slow miserable death by malt extract, cocoa butter and glucose syrup.”
before I was in one with
Which of course only made the stubborn Army captain more determined to make Sherlock admit he’d been bested at something.
“Says the man who exists on Mrs. Hudson’s mince pies and thinks HP sauce is a vegetable.”
"Uh...no? Maybe." John stepped backward and unexpectedly fell arse-first into his armchair.
"And I did get something out of that. A 30-second lesson in humility – a concept with which I am not completely familiar. As you know.”
Sherlock looked around him, seeing nothing more or less erotic than the sitting room in its normal disarray with all of the lights on, the skull grinning at them from the mantel, and both of them fully clothed.
All the stings, The ugly things
PROMISE?!  SEE YOU SOON SWEET PEA xxx
“Mere battle scars.”
Sherlock made a woeful little face and nodded. John stopped pulling and Sherlock rescued what was left of his beautiful knitty scheme: two long snake-like tubes poking out of a larger sausage-shaped tube, all knotted and twisted and braided into a gruesomely gaudy jumble that even a circus clown would have thought about twice.
“But you ate the wrong cupcake!”
Sherlock smiled, knowing perfectly well why John had chosen this particular song. It told of a magical London night, two people in love, their excitement and confusion, the stars and the moon and first kisses. It was ideal for a dance at a wedding. Even someone else’s.
Which earned him a well-aimed cushion to the head.
"Don't you want to father children?"
“Rather….romantic, wouldn’t you say?”
“John! The Coat is back!” he announced rapturously, doing a theatrical spin in the doorway.
“Many thanks, you berk.”
“Suitcase.”
“Small of the back?” Sherlock suggested.
While Sherlock was napping on the sofa, John leaned over him and whispered:
“You did not tell me that there would be wild horses running across the roads up here, Sherlock.”
"WHAT." That malevolent growl again.
“It’s very simple, John. After I detoxed I realized that I needed to replace my destructive habits with something more positive but equally as compelling. Something to occupy me while my brain is in overdrive, and yet allow me to maintain the razor-sharp focus I need for deduction. An energizing surge of adrenaline and endorphins coupled with a warm afterglow of well-being. Something positive, pleasurable, easily accessible and calorie-free. Something that won’t isolate me from you. In fact, you are an integral part of my new plan.”
Passionate as hell, but always in control.
“Sorting the dirty clothes - that shirt happened to get caught up in the sheets, I didn't notice.”
He handed Sherlock his tea and said pleasantly, “Je voudrais vous voir à poil!” [
“The cabbie may object, Sherlock. He might charge us extra for creating a public nuisance.”
"I do apologize for winding you up," Sherlock said briskly.
“Goddammit, this is ridiculous!”
“I can’t twirl properly in this!”
Sherlock walked in, threw his coat on the floor, gave John a dazzling smile and waltzed into the kitchen.
“Go away.”
Roses are red,
“You are OVERLY ticklish while it affects me not in the least. I’m simply trying to desensitize you a bit to this particular reflex.”
Sherlock could be heard singing in the shower, his rich smoky voice drifting out on clouds of steam: “ '…In the hush of night while you're in my arms, I feel your lips so warm and tender…' ”
Sugar in your hands can be lethal
At breakfast the next morning John tried to mend matters between them a bit.
John, stark naked and furious as a rabid stoat, began flinging Malteaser packets and boxes out of the closet. “This shite’ll kill you!”
For John, that distressing mental image burst his erotic little makeover daydream.
But on the whole of it
He passed Sherlock the marmalade and said, “Fait-il chaud ici, ou c'est juste vous?” [
"SHERLOCK! How the hell old were you?!"
Sherlock shuddered. John had a serious weakness for sweets, and he was hooked on the cupcakes from that posh bakery around the corner. At least once a week he brought home a pink cardboard box of those detestable confections. He was nearly as bad as Mycroft.
“Most definitely. Come along, John, you know you want to. The moment our eyes first met at Bart’s, you were arse over tit for me.”
“It’s not?”
“Sherlock, it was your turn to do the laundry this week.”
Sherlock observed carefully, occasionally lifting an eyebrow or a corner of his lush mouth. When he moved his hand toward John’s leg, John knocked it aside. “Ah–ah, no touching.” Sherlock swallowed audibly.
“Don’t drive over that big rock, you’ll… never mind.”
“Oh, all right. Let’s at least duck behind that big black limousine.”
“…Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“Those would be healthier choices.”
“I believe I will,“ Sherlock said. He seldom drank: his vices were few and alcohol was not one of them. But at the successful conclusion of a case, in the late-night glow of accomplishment and celebration, perhaps a whisky was just the thing one needed.
“Hot cross bun?”
“Aha. Rental car. I thought so.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, but there were…body fluids on it, and that’s not good for anyone, least of all the coat. And you couldn’t possibly ask Mrs. Hudson to deal with those.”
“Truly Madly Deeply!” John shouted through the bathroom door.
“Well, not ‘biscuit’ literally… ‘dipping the biscuit’ means…”
Sherlock finally put on headphones to block out any more of John’s French language ninja attacks.
Good lord, this thing was going from bad to worse. “Rye” and “eyes” didn't come close to rhyming! The meter was nothing to applaud either, so disjointed and jolting as it was. And that trite Technicolor imagery belonged in an air freshener advert.
John began humming, then softly singing along:
“A kiss is always a nice surprise, Sherlock. But what was that for?”
The long kiss had flooded his body with an intoxicating biochemical cocktail of hormones, neurotransmitters and endorphins that lit up his pleasure centers like a pinball machine, and John Watson whirled about in the middle of a sexy, emotional, chemically-charged brain party.
“Oh, now I finally feel complete. All is right in my sphere, and I’m ready to take on the world once more.” He spun around again just from sheer exuberance, before flopping down in his chair with a sigh of supreme contentment.
“Nonsense, he’s much too busy texting his mistress about a dirty shag at a cheap hotel.”
“Quack.”
“See, you’re doing fine... John, the pothole!”
First John found it wadded up in the refrigerator’s vegetable drawer along with an aromatic bag of thumbs.
(send text/Y)
“Pretend you’re giving me CPR.”
Sherlock could hear John expressing his wrath the moment he opened the front door. The sounds of rattling crockery, clashing metal, and banging cupboard doors echoed down the stairwell. Angry footsteps to and fro. Muttered profanity and not a few F-bombs. All indications that John was making tea, his customary non-firearm-related solution to all of life's problems.
“But what would happen if I was injured and you had to take me to Casualty?”
“All right - that's enough, John. Now please stop.”
For the first 5 seconds nothing happened. Precisely nothing. Sherlock applied his lips to John's and pressed gently. It was like kissing Stonehenge.
“I need a massive jolt of sexual energy.”
“Mm, you smell nice.”
Look at him watching me in the mirror. He’s standing there waiting, idly pretending to look out the window – but I see what he’s doing. Watching my hands, watching me faff about with my tie, analysing me. He doesn’t know it but I chose this tie because he said he liked the color. I listen when he throws away those insignificant little remarks, they are as close as he gets to actual compliments. But I don’t mind. I deduce him too.
John put every last thing he had into the final line of the song, flinging his arms wide and throwing the newspapers in the air. Then he collapsed with a huge sigh on the end of the sofa near Sherlock's feet.
“What about my thigh?”
“Truce.”
“I wouldn’t object to dancing to this one,” Sherlock said. “Shall we try it?”
How true that had been. John had felt his world turn upside down in the space of a very few hours. He’d been swept into the unknown by Sherlock Holmes - and whatever his world had been before, it suddenly became one where he was no longer alone, no longer friendless, no longer a ghost of a man.
"Precisely. Making you angry is absurdly easy; I wanted to see how quickly it could be reversed. And now I have my answer - 30 seconds."
There was pouting. Days of pouting. John ruthlessly consigned Sherlock’s sugar-coated drug hoard to Mrs. Hudson’s bins, and heavy emotional weather descended on 221B. Sherlock was alternately manic and withdrawn, demanding Malteasers and sulking when denied. John largely ignored him and spent increasing amounts of time in his old room. He reproached himself for bringing those sweets into the flat in the first place – he should have realized he was tempting a known addict with a controlled substance.
John stood at parade rest, as unyielding as an oak tree - knees locked, arms behind his back, eyes fixed straight ahead. Sherlock took his rigid and stubbornly resistant body into his arms. And as he embraced John, he raised his left wrist away from John's shoulder ever so subtly and brought his watch into view.
A week passed. Sherlock said nothing.
“Well, I'm glad to see you’ve calmed down since this morning. Wait a minute, you haven’t…
John growled, “Mon aéroglisseur est plein d'anguilles” with such a sexy accent that Sherlock nearly exploded with lust.
“Of course you are. I’ve invited you to dinner, we’re sitting in a romantic restaurant with glasses of wine, there’s a candle on the table...”
“SPEAKING OF ‘UNSAID’!” Sherlock shouted. He threw off the headphones and flopped down on the sofa with a cushion over his head. John ignored the outburst and lifted Sherlock's feet to remove some old newspapers.
"...I am not putting up with any more of your unwelcome, ill-timed info-dumps.” He slammed a mug on the table for emphasis.
I’M READY NOW….!’ “
“How about a coffee instead?”
“Back of the ambulance?”
“Er….your new jumper?”
“John?”
By the 25-second mark John was fully engaged: body pressed hard against Sherlock's, hands buried in Sherlock's hair. His brain had replaced negative thoughts with feelings of exhilaration, warmth and desire, and he’d already forgotten anything that happened before the moment Sherlock took him into his arms.
Sherlock sat frozen in his chair, utterly failing to appear casual and looking like a squirrel with its cheeks stuffed full of nuts.
"Oh no. I know precisely where she is. I… keep an eye on her."
So when Sherlock discovered that John was writing poetry again - without a girlfriend in sight - he felt a tingle of anticipation and a not-unpleasant kind of romantic anxiety. He hadn’t really been snooping, he'd only borrowed John’s laptop because his own was much too far away down the hall in the bedroom. John had left a file open and of course Sherlock could not possibly bother to mind his own business.
“Oh, John,” said Sherlock weakly, gradually subsiding into giggles. “I was sure you’d catch on more quickly, since I was being so absurdly clueless. But you seemed to be enjoying it so much, and truthfully…well, you certainly have hidden talents that I never dreamed of.” He smiled and winked knowingly.
“…eiroribjzzzz…”
“And THAT, you sexy posh prat, is only for starters.”
How gratifyingly ironic that Sherlock now followed him as they moved together across the sitting room floor.
“Mmm. Me too. Let’s have dinner.”
“Ready, John?”
John grunted and headed toward his chair with the newspaper while Sherlock prepared the tea and biscuits, gleefully anticipating John’s surprise this evening when presented with his handsome new jumper.
He heard John come in the front door and start up the stairs. Shoving the jumper out of sight again, he quickly arranged himself on the sofa in his Thinking Position.
Sherlock could barely wait to see what else John had been typing away at while he had been opening a tin of beans for tea. The moment John went in to take a shower, Sherlock flipped open the laptop to read the latest installment.
“I’m not your date.”
Depression settled in like a dense London fog. Day after day, Sherlock lay coiled in his chair, pretzel-like, mournfully staring at the doorway as if expecting his coat to come waltzing through it at any moment. He looked like a patient dog waiting for the return of his absent owner.
“Those are pretty. Going in for landscapes?”
Look at him standing there before the sitting room mirror adjusting his tie. The knot is precise - this is a practiced motion. He’s done it hundreds of times, could do it blindfolded.
“SHIT!!!”
“Don’t talk to
“Mm, yes, that seems obvious.”
Sherlock held up one long forefinger to halt the conversation while he consulted his notebook again.
“It might benefit you to remember that.”
John sighed with annoyance. He was going to give that bloody verse idea just one more chance before he abandoned it and moved on to something else.
“Now – do I need any instruments, tools, props? I’m assuming no special clothing is required….there’s plenty of light for you to get a good view…. All right, let’s begin!”
“You just sit right there, posh boy, and I’ll show you what I’m talking about.”
“Ready, Sherlock?”
“Yeah, all right, very sexy, next time with disco music. Got it.”
John, who had seen every inch of Sherlock's naked body and then some, tried to remember any mysterious unexplained scars, and came up vacant. Maybe it was psychological damage? That would certainly explain a few things.
seen ‘Trainspotting’, you know.”
"I have formulated a theory, but in order to test it I first had to make you angry. And this provocation had to take place somewhere you wouldn't be likely to cause a scene - "
“Sherlock, I really do not want you using my toothbrush, you have your own.”
“Yes, you definitely know all about potatoes.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock responded crossly, which made John giggle. “Why don’t you save your breath and write that one down.”
“Shut it, Sherlock.”
“Oh yes. Sherl….marryyyyyyyybzzzz...”
“… and everyone will think we have granddad tastes, but…there’s just something about the lyrics.”
“Personally, I think your arse is full of – ”
The following morning John appeared in the sitting room wearing only his underpants, and merrily proclaimed: “Il y a une féte dans mon slip et je t'y invite!” [
“Here’s an idea – audiobooks.”
“Oh. Sorry.”
John didn't even look up.
He holds the jacket by the lapels, shrugs slightly to settle it on his shoulders. Dusts it off, tugs at the pockets and the vent. Buttons it.
“Well… I didn't mean you had to stop.”
"Er...." John shook his head to clear it a bit. Sherlock flapped the notebook at him.
“But that coat was not purchased from a store: it was given to me by an esteemed professor and my mentor, Dr. Bell.”
“But it’s miles of uninhabited countryside - you’d never have to worry about hitting anything!”
Then he suddenly grew very quiet, and murmured something almost inaudible under his breath: “
The only illumination came from the streetlights outside, filtering through the net curtains. John’s half-naked body was dappled with shadows and his Y-fronts gleamed whitely in the dusk. He stepped up onto the chair seat and planted his feet on either side of Sherlock's thighs, rocking from one foot to the other and wearing a provocative expression.
Sherlock frowned, drummed his long fingers on the table, looked everywhere but at John’s face. If he’d been wrong about the poem, then no telling what else he might be wrong about. Looking the fool was a new and abhorrent experience, but worse yet: John obviously didn't care enough to write any kind of poetry for him, not even a rubbish cryptography exercise.
Horrors. “Treacle” did not even begin to describe this blob of mawkish twaddle. It rivaled the outpourings of a love-struck middle schooler, written in pink ink in a boy-band notebook. Oh John.
“I rather think I’m looking at him.”
“Like a faint little voice saying, ‘Okay!’? ”
“John, STOP! Just stop. Now, when you step on the clutch you have to remember…”
“Sherlock, LET ME UP!” John pushed and shoved at him until Sherlock leaned/half-fell off his lap onto the floor.
Sherlock sighed with satisfaction, and stroked the lapel with the red buttonhole.
“John?”
I REPEAT STOP THIS IMMEDIATELY.
“Ignoring you.”
“First I was a sleeping pill, now I’m a chocolate bar, next I’ll be a….”
“All right, all right, calm down, Rudy.”
“Sherlock, this string hanging out of the sofa ….. what the hell IS all this?”
John only ever wrote him notes about tedious things like laundry and shopping, severed heads in the fridge and eyeballs in the microwave. Back in the day when he’d still had girlfriends, John composed treacly love poems on the laptop, then carefully wrote them out by hand before folding them lovingly and slipping them into a box of chocolates or a pretty bouquet. Sherlock would have died before admitting how much he coveted those little love-offerings. He had openly scoffed at the chocolates and flowers and sentimental verse, yet Sherlock secretly longed for some tangible evidence of John’s affection.
“John, if I may just say…I think you’ve coped splendidly so far, for having so little experience. Well, for having no actual experience at all. Well done. Except for that tailpipe and the front fender.”
