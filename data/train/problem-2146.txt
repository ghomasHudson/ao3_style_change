“So, what do you think?” Greg asked as they reached the pavement outside of the goodly estate.
“Wait, is that allowed,” Molly asked, “stating something false and then drinking yourself?”
Guilt, perhaps. Guilt for forgetting about him.
Sherlock hoped his inner turmoil went unnoticed. He didn’t want John to know about the way his insides squirmed around like a dozen pythons, even less so since John seemed to be perfectly fine. He just fixated Sherlock with those luminous eyes and let his tongue slip out to wet his lips a little too often.
He opened his eyes fast enough to see the dreamy expression on John’s face turn into confusion and then dismay as he beheld the tears shimmering on Sherlock’s cheeks.
Sherlock is just debating whether to enter Mrs Hudson’s flat and ask her what is going on or stomp upstairs straight away when another sound reaches his ears.
John couldn’t help but laugh, a hearty honest laugh.
As it was always the case in quiet peaceful neighbourhoods, the gossip that spread in the course of the investigation was bound to ruin more lives than the death of Ethan Nichols itself. And still, the murderer was on the loose. John wondered if a community could ever recover from a catastrophe like this, as he tried to clean up the mess of personal tragedies Sherlock had so cruelly left behind. Sometimes it seemed that all progress regarding empathetic behaviour Sherlock had made over the years vanished the second he couldn’t crack a puzzle right away. John couldn’t help but be deeply disappointed.
. Can you do that for me?”
John was threading through the early morning London rush hour, having picked up Rosie from friends outside of the city, his mind deep in thought. He didn’t even remember how it had started exactly. The past months were just one giant blur of pain and grief and sleep-deprivation. It must’ve been some few weeks after he and Rosie had returned to Baker Street. The flat he and Mary had lived in was simply tainted. How could he raise his daughter in the same rooms where her mother had laughed and lived and loved her? How could he cross a hall where she would never walk again, how could he sit in a kitchen that would forever be void of her voice? They needed to get away, to start fresh—or at least as fresh as John could manage.
“Anything you want, John. Everything you want,” Sherlock replied and pecked John on his forehead before going to put on his coat.
“We just want to talk to him,” Lestrade assured her but Laney only crossed her arms.
The addressee tumbled backwards at the sound penetrating the silence but conquered his shock remarkably quickly. It took him only a split second to raise the flashlight to Sherlock’s face who had to shut his eyes against the sudden brightness. Still, his vision turned painfully white. The next moment, he felt someone shove past him towards the garden gate. Sherlock grabbed at the stranger but only lay hold of a handful of fabric which was almost immediately torn from his grasp again.
This chapter's song is:
Warmth flooded John’s chest. He would never tire of hearing—or saying—it. He loved Sherlock. And Sherlock loved him. There was nothing better than this simple yet world-altering fact. Trailing his finger over a razor-sharp cheekbone, he said: “I love you more.”
“Home? I think you’ve forfeited the right to call this your home when you just left without a word.” Sherlock’s eyes, less criminative than his utterance but infinitely sadder, pinned John firmly to the ground but couldn’t keep his overcharged synapses from finally snapping.
The tall figure of his brother turned around, swung his obligatory umbrella around at his side, and approached Sherlock with the usual expression of smug indifference pinned on his face.
John loves him?
Since when did that mistletoe hang there? Had Sherlock put it up? Well, who else would have? Mrs. Hudson? She surely had been conspicuously quiet about their new living arrangements and maybe still held onto the misconception that he and Sherlock were a couple. Hanging mistletoe in their kitchen seemed like something she would find funny.
John is standing there with his hands stuffed into his jacket pockets, waiting for Sherlock to get closer. When they are only a few feet apart, he nods his head slightly and gives Sherlock a sheepish smile. “Hi.”
“Scoot! Doctor’s orders.”
This was tedious. Sherlock felt the cold creep into every fibre of his being, damp fingers gripping at his face and body. His legs were already numb from the strain of hunkering down for so long and his nose and ears would surely fall off any second now.
Greg swallows. So, it’s true. There’s something deeper, something more destructive happening to his oh so cerebral friend.
The Sergeant looked at him with raised brows. “You want to go there now? It’s the middle of the night.”
At once, John’s laughter ebbed away into a tender smile and his eyes softened. “Of course.”
“Oh.” Sherlock sat back in his chair. And he had thought that this whole situation couldn’t get any worse. “How?”
“What do you think of this,” Sherlock asks, raising his eyes to Greg’s for a minute before reading out loud what he has scribbled down on a fresh piece of paper. “
“Still,” John got serious again, “if the case is as high-profile as Greg said, we must expect a decent amount of press and I just want to know how we’ll handle that before I go and embarrass us both.”
Cal nodded again, his head sinking to his chest.
A second pair of rapid steps joined and then passed Sherlock by.
By the time the glossy black door comes into sight, Sherlock’s movements can barely be counted as walking anymore; Greg is lugging him along more or less, the additional weight and the exertion making him uncomfortably hot again. The appeasing effect of his pints is vaporising with each drop of sweat rolling down his back and, regardless of Sherlock’s emotional troubles, Greg wants nothing more than get out of this whole, delicate situation.
It’s alright if you don’t want to talk to me right now. I understand. I couldn’t have handled this any worse and I am terribly sorry, Sherlock. Take all the time you need. But please stay safe and don’t do anything you’ll regret later.
“I’m taking you up on your offer by the way,” John says later as the air around them is filled with the scent of sweat and the sound of light-hearted laughter.
An adorable shade of pink crept up Sherlock’s cheeks while his skilled hands absent-mindedly floated up and down John’s body. “Well, if I remember correctly, you bought some things at the chemist yesterday…?”
John took back his phone with a non-committal nod and felt his ego cheer somewhere behind his collarbone as Kristen put her headphones back on and jogged away.
“Something must’ve changed his mind.”
John reaches for his toothbrush and paste, then checks the mirror again.
For a split second, he ponders turning around and just running, running as fast as his feet can carry him. Yet, he forces himself to keep walking as if his heart isn’t cramping, as if his pulse isn’t hammering in his ears. His legs rebel vehemently and try to drag him in the opposite direction but still Sherlock finds himself within earshot before he knows it.
Sherlock was momentarily annoyed, but John wasn’t wrong. “Greg has the Scottish police on board; I have no doubt he could recruit them.”
“It's been dark for five minutes,” Lestrade continued. “Isn't he usually more on time than this?”
No such emotion reached Jonathan, too far removed from humanity. “I will take my chances.”
“My mother’s there, Sherlock,” John said abruptly, stopping as he looked down at Sherlock. He was angry with no one in particular, but prickly nonetheless. “When George said everyone was in Romania, he meant
“And you woke up where?”
!” John said, exasperated as he turned to face the window, arms crossed. He tried not the flinch as he pressed on his broken rib.
“As we entered the building, opposing sides, I felt him pause, and knew he sensed me too. Immediately, it became a race to see who could kill Mr. Holmes first. Sherlock, I do hope you understand that my intent was solely to speak with your brother; a discussion among friends. However, knowing that our enemies were also aware of Mycroft’s unique set of skills, the circumstances made it so that he had to be claimed. If I did not turn him, the others would have. And that, I am afraid, I could not allow to happen.”
“I don’t see a park,” he said, reading the signs on the shops across the road, which all seemed to indicate that they were closed for business, or for sale. “Anything green, really.”
John growled and, as he turned, a flash of white near his mouth was made visible. The two moved even faster, their movements increasingly vicious, and with the clear intent to kill. While little else that had happened so far made absolute sense to the observers of the fight, they knew enough that they were not to step in. Instead, they flinched whenever John deflected the vampire's attacks a moment too late. Thomas managed to throw off John's measured rhythm as he feigned movement towards Mycroft, and wrapped a pale, strong hand around John's throat. As spots appeared in his eyes, he felt himself slip from consciousness, and into a memory – one regarding his army training.
Before Sherlock could pose a very similar question, John asked, “What in the hell was that?”
The fog, thicker here than it had been on the road, made the interior of the barn dark enough that Sherlock couldn’t see where John had landed until his eyes had adjusted slightly. Before he could see his companion, he heard him.
John glanced around and shook his head; this one wasn’t a trap. He leaned closer and pressed his ear to the door; with the addition of fresh blood to his body, John’s senses were heightened. Even so, he heard nothing. He pulled back and straightened his shoulders, getting himself into a neutral, solid position. He drew one of his long, sharp daggers, and his companions drew their guns. Sherlock turned off his torch and slipped it back in his coat. “Ahead,” John said, turning his head slightly. Carefully, he pulled open the door.
“It's not organized,” he stated. “Humans panic. They see it as chaos, but there's always a pattern. I just can't find it.”
John crossed his arms and leaned back, murmuring the words, when realization flashed across his face. “Back in the day, there was a group that called themselves that, wasn't there? That group of American lieutenants.”
“Ah, of course, but wait,” Jonathan said, mocking. “You don’t wish to kill vampires, only keep them in line if they kill humans - as they are biologically engineered to do. Foolish,” he spat.
“No, definitely not,” John said, throwing a hand over Sherlock’s hip, and resting his forehead against the other man’s.
There was quiet, and John didn’t need to look at Sherlock to know the detective agreed. “You aren’t wrong. I don’t know why I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt.”
“Mmh,” John replied, this expression more certain.
“We aren’t bringing more humans into this!” John snapped, officially losing his cool. “They wouldn’t be enough, anyways. I need people who are currently stuck god-knows-where in Romania, people in England who I haven’t even had time to call. There isn’t enough time. There isn’t-” He was verging on hyperventilation. “Either we go in on a suicide mission, or we let more people die. There is no winning scenario here.”
“And you don't like the mystery of it?”
Leading the way, Sherlock looked back to make sure that John was following him, then slowed down as soon as the lane widened enough for both men to walk together. After what felt like an unusually long time walking through the dark alley, the pair came into a large space, bordered on all sides by the windowless brick walls of the buildings around it. In the center stood a barn, its painted exterior faded and cracked.
“And all this is without even mentioning your right breast pocket, which is clearly holding papers.”Sherlock reached quickly to the vampire's jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of crumpled pieces of thoroughly marked up notebook paper. “Dull. You're just giving yourself away.”
“Right.”
John smiled. “Either I bounce ideas off you til something sticks, or we walk around the city until we feel something.”
John gasped and sat up, eyes snapping open. Awake again. He tapped his phone – he had managed a full three hours before he had woken himself up. He pinched the bridge of his nose as he tried to blink the blurs in his vision away. Although he was not usually prone to nightmares – not since he had started living with Sherlock – the past month had been filled with them. He wasn't prone to being so affected by death, either, but he could at least start writing that off to lack of sleep.
Sherlock glared at his brother. Mycroft looked to his left at Greg Lestrade, who had begun flipping through a book.
“We can’t go through the streets carrying the big stuff,” he said, thinking just as quickly as he spoke. “That means we’re doing this without rifles and crossbows. Probably for the best. Sherlock, you’re taking my pistol, silver chains, and a shoulder holster. Greg, same idea, take the Ruger, bandolier and,” he looked around the bed, “a silver glove. Wooden and silver bullets for the both of you. You should have plenty of places for stakes, so grab a couple of those as well and make sure they’re covered by your coat. Oh, and whoever has room, take a crowbar. I don’t think we’ll be able to avoid it.”
John stood in front of his chair, unmoving, as he listened to the doors a floor below him close. All that remained in the room was himself, Sherlock, and a silence broken only by the clock, and the creak of floorboards as Sherlock stood up.
“You’re sure?” Caroline confirmed. Charles moved forward to George’s side.
Before it occurred to John what Sherlock meant, he started walking quickly too, followed by the others.
“No need,” the man replied, pulling off his blue gloves and tossing them at the nearest trash bin. “The cause of death was blood loss. Clearly. Any of the daily papers could have told you that.”
“You haven't,” John said, resigned.
“Won't you have a seat?"
Twenty minutes, one hailed taxi, and an uncomfortably close ride later, the four men – one of whom was at a total loss about what they were looking for, and another under the mistaken belief that he wasn't – were dropped off by the water and began their walk along the road. Against John's unexplainable protests, Lestrade had alerted his own team about his whereabouts, but left out any details about what he was investigating. Sherlock focused his flashlight on the beach, but seeing nothing, continued to walk with the group.
Circled in red pen were various number combinations. John looked at it for a second, but didn’t find himself any more illuminated than he had been five minutes earlier. “Sorry?” He asked.
“It’s not fine,” John said, voice choked. Softly, so gently John barely noticed, he felt Sherlock’s hand tenderly graze the back of his neck. Then, the hand fell, and Sherlock’s eyes, still locked on John’s, lost their light. His face relaxed, and John ran a hand along the consulting detective’s jaw. “Sherlock?”
Her companions missed the reference.
“Right,” John replied, not quite getting it. “So how do you know it was a murder?”
“Actually, I should get back to the office,” Lestrade said, glancing at the clock on the wall.
dead.”
“No luck?” Greg asked.
“Yes, and that,” Sherlock said, brushing dirt off what appeared to be a fragment of bone. “But I thought the smell was a given.”
By his calculation, a litre would do it. It would cover the major injuries and probably most of the superficial cuts, but maybe not the deeper ones. It didn't matter – he'd used less on worse injuries. Pulling out one bag, he untwisted the top and held it between his fingers, sitting back on the edge of his bed frame. Toasting the night, he tilted his head back and drank, emptying the bag and leaving only a single drop of blood on the edge of his mouth. Wiping it away, he stood and faced the mirror. His skin was flushed and his breathing was stronger. By the time he made it down the stairs he knew he would no longer be injured, and be able to tackle the more pressing issue of explaining himself to three men who could easily get him jail time.
John smiled mildly, knowing better than to interrupt one of Sherlock’s tangents. When he was particularly cross, everything became Mycroft’s fault. Especially, however rare it was, when Sherlock was worried about him.
“Indeed,” George replied. “Though not all vampires as old as me are as active. Many stay hidden, in crypts or in the shadows, feeding only when necessary. There is a certain standard of vampire, the old standard, which still hides in crumbling castles in faraway lands and inaccessible mountains. Such was the type that sought Mycroft Holmes while I did.
“Yeah?”
“Stand still, stay behind Mycroft, do not move,” John instructed, speaking to the three men through gritted teeth. No one spoke as he took his gun from Mrcroft and handed it to Sherlock. “It will buy you time. Lestrade, take out yours.” He turned, and looked around himself as he stepped forward, and the group, silent mostly out of shock, stayed where they were. Neither Sherlock or Lestrade questioned John, who had taken on an intensity they had never before seen in him. Looking from his left to right as he walked forward, John could feel eyes in the darkness watching him. He stopped in the middle of the road and stood still. Mycroft was immediately reminded of the way the man must have looked in his days as a soldier.
“We’ve taken on plenty of vampires - less than a week ago, as it so happens,” Sherlock said, reminding John of their alleyway escapades in East London.
“Are we going in the right direction?” John asked, his echoing him with a rumble; he regretted not having one of the granola bars he had tossed at Sherlock.
John smiled, remembering his teen years - he’d spend weeks at a time in the vampire wing, studying, during summer break. “Do you see the big red leather-bound book? Far wall, right beside the door.”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched as he broke eye contact and picked up his jacket.
Lestrade glanced up from his phone. “Oh, just the, you know, ex,” he said, sending off a text and slipping it back in his coat pocket awkwardly. “Today was supposed to be my weekend with the kids. Obviously this is a bit more pressing, so we’re going to have to postpone.”
“The wonders of vampire blood,” John said with a grin, looking at Sherlock.
John braced himself further, but knew he was right - he had very little power left to fight Sebastian, much less stay conscious.
“I'll try to remember that.”
“I’m under new management,” Sebastian called from afar, with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. He turned from John and began walking out of the central gates of the base towards a waiting vehicle. He likely would have continued walking, leaving John to the nightmare behind him, until a shot rang out over the sound of crackling flames. Sebastian didn’t notice he had been hit until he felt warm blood trickling down his cheek from a graze above his temple. The kind of injury only a master marksman could inflict.
John shook his head and looked away, moving closer to Mycroft.“What do you remember about what happened? And when were you turned? This has to be recent, you kidnapped me last month to find out why Sherlock was forging your signature to get into the archives on that museum case. You were definitely alive then.”
“Library. I was just waiting for you to come down to find out why,” John said.
A woman carrying a long oak staff bumped into John, and pushed him down just in time to swing her weapon over him. She struck a young vampire in a policeman’s uniform in the mouth, repeating her action again to knock him to his knees. With a howl, the vampire fell to the floor, distracted by losing one of his fangs.
John looked at him and started laughing. Lestrade - as usual, amused at the pair, but still out of the loop - smiled.
“The day prior to the first...” He glanced at John and didn't finish the sentence. “I was spending a late night at the Diogenes Club,” he said, eyes distant as he remembered. “I needed silence to finish some important paperwork. I don't know why I thought it was so necessary to finish at the time.”
John closed his eyes for a moment and breathed in, exhaling into a heavy sigh. “Old Town, definitely. The farther to the edges we go the less I feel.”
“Do you have a plan?” Sherlock asked John over his shoulder, firing off a shot that took off a vampire’s shoulder, bringing it to its knees but not destroying it entirely.
“Are you the only one here?” Sherlock asked. The day had just begun, and the pale orange light that streamed through the windows at the far end of the empty office suggested that the city was not yet awake.
“I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, then,” John said, pushing aside a stack of papers on the table in front of him. “As it so happens, I was planning on buying you a sweater.”
“Ten packages of crisps and a couple of condoms.”
removed from the current murder investigations."
“So that's the fangs sorted, then,”Lestrade said, a bit weakly as the amount of information he had just acquired fully hit him.
John, wakeful enough to argue, plucked it from his hands and took a bite from the opposite corner. Chewing it thoughtfully, he turned towards the table and put the toast beside Sherlock's tea cup.“The toast is fine. Maybe you'd be in a better mood if you'd slept more than two hours.”
“Greg? Are you guys all right?”
“Yes, obviously.
“Yes you do. Who?”
“About damn time,” John answered, and the pair headed down Holyrood Road towards the nearest cafe. John absently moved onto other topics of conversation - Sherlock’s previous trips to Scotland, brief musings on Lestrade’s progress - but the idea of the vaults persisted. Something about it nagged at him.
“Yeah?” the DI replied, out of breath, as he rose from behind a few decaying bodies.
“I know you too, actually,
“Well, we can’t fly – not with all the guns I’ve got to take, even if I could have one of my contacts forge the customs documents in time. Can’t call Mycroft, he’s out of network. One of the Elders has a plane, but he’s with the rest of them in Romania.” John leaned back in his chair. “This has been planned too perfectly. It doesn’t matter what happens, we always seem to be a step behind.”
“Borrowing,” he said at the same moment as Sherlock.
“This is the last catalogue I wrote up for that level of the vaults.”
“Hi Greg, it’s Molly,” the voice on the other end of the line said.
Molly was adding pins to a map on her computer as Greg dictated addresses to her, and Mycroft would occasionally interject with a piece of information, like the best way to approach the location, or which areas would be less populated. More often than not, however, he sat silently off to the side, slightly slumped over in his chair, dabbing with his handkerchief at a persistent nosebleed that was coming and going. Greg was concerned, but wrote it off on stress. Mycroft only hoped that as the clock crept closer to midday, he wouldn’t grow any paler.
“You can hardly expect me to have any interest in a case you can't tell me about,” Sherlock said, leaning back in his chair.
John abruptly dug the fingernails of his clenched fist into palm.
For all the skill Mycroft had at making travel arrangements and faking the information necessary to get him where he needed to go, he had nothing on Sherlock’s ability to act quickly to resolve time-sensitive problems. In the present situation, Sherlock had managed to call in a favour from a school companion of Mycroft’s who worked for the transportation minister. However reluctant the friend may have been to get involved in what Sherlock was planning, he was more than willing to provide him with an empty train compartment so long as no questions were asked.
Mycroft, who had until that point been consumed by the notion of drinking from John, had managed to ignore the movement of the man beneath him, but what he said made him pause for a moment – long enough to notice a certain darkness at the edges of his vision. Pulling himself a few centimetres away from the shorter man's neck, he was struck by a sudden powerlessness that ran through him from head to toe. Backing away and no longer holding on to John, he nearly stumbled, looking at the man before him with an expression of confusion. John stepped forward as Mycroft faltered and fell to his knees, his fangs retracting and the pupils of his eyes blowing wide.
Quietly, Mycroft asked, “Do I need to be given permission to enter?”
“I would have preferred to work with you, John, but I do not have time to argue,” Harker continued, and leaned back on his desk to survey his creations’ first kill. In the moment before the chaos broke out, Sherlock’s gaze landed on Mycroft, and the pair locked eyes. For a moment, possibly the first in their lives as brothers, they understood one another perfectly.
“Out,” Sherlock snarled, and even John jumped back. Watching the detective out of the corner of his eye, he moved the remaining bystanders out, and slammed the heavy door closed. Under Sherlock's hand, the man continued to struggle, fangs striking against his lower lips as they sought foreign flesh.
“Nope,” John said, shaking his head. “Not tonight. It's a bad idea.”
“We’ve met them,” Sherlock said, but Sebastian ignored him.
Coming to terms with the scene before him, John tried to get his bearings. Through the haze of smoke and flames, John clearly saw the tall figure of Sebastian directing vampires across the base. John pulled himself up using the flagpole beside him, and lumbered in his second-in-command’s direction.
John sighed. “Sorry, Greg. Hopefully this will be over quickly. If you do have to head back, though…”
Sherlock led the way to the table, and once they had room, he let John ahead of him. John slowly managed to get closer to the man Sherlock had pointed out, trying not to attract the attention of the three humans and one other vampire that accompanied him.
A smile briefly flared on John’s lips, and Sherlock involuntarily stepped away as far as he was able. A smile like that only appeared when John was about to hit someone.
Molly snickered, then fell against the wall behind her, sliding down it to rest on the tips of her toes. “Oh, Christ. What was that? Mycroft’s a vampire too now?”
“Quite right. Caroline, Charles, and I arrived early last week to resume our investigations. We left the remainder of our troops in Romania, which, it seems, was for the best. For the first time in months we received a lead.”
“Yes,” he confirmed, also speaking quieter.
Sherlock, reluctant to speak seriously, leaned on one elbow over John and looked at him, searching his eyes for anything that didn’t signal rejection.
“We got married in Romania, right outside Cluj-Napoca. After that, we moved to the base in Afghanistan. We had one perfect year,” John murmured, clearing his throat.
Sherlock leaned down to kiss John softly. John laughed and pulled away from Sherlock, running the pad of his thumb across his flatmate’s lower lip.
John looked away, trying to keep his temper under control, at the figures in the shadows. He knew who they were, in spite of never having met them. He made eye contact with Jonathan. “You’ve recruited Old Ones. Vampires who never integrated with society. You know you’re at opposite purposes, don’t you?”
“I’ll take care of him,” John said, ducking as a vampire swinging a blade passed by him. “Go - you’re the only one who can keep up with him.”
John nodded. “Not all information is safe to write down.”
“Right, sorry,” he said, apologizing again, and sitting up, ignoring Sherlock's questions. “What time is it?”
“It's not the deaths that I'm worried about.”
“Williams,” he said with a nod.
“It could be worthwhile for you, dear brother.”
Lestrade nodded. “The team working on the case though it might be the last murder, seeing as nothing happened for a week after we found it. Apparently not.”Her thoughts were interrupted by Sherlock, and she looked at him as he walked to the head of the table, leaning down to look at the neck of the body. After staring at it for what seemed to be an undue amount of time, he straightened and swept around the metal table, stopping a few inches away and staring down at her.
“What?” Sherlock asked, immediately analyzing every part of her expression.
“His what?” Sherlock asked sharply.
. Yelled it before you woke up. You were thrashing around in your sleep.”
“Van Helsing.”
"It's a bit late for you, isn't it?" John asked.
“About thirty, thirty-five percent total? Depends on the person, really,” John replied, glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock. Though he was tempted, he did not tack on a 'why' to the end of his sentence; questioning Sherlock mid-thought never ended well. He had learned not to interrupt the process.
“That can’t be right,” John said, confused.
“Hm.” Lestrade was silent. After a moment, he spoke again. “You seem to be accepting all of this a lot faster than me.”
John didn’t recall sleeping, but felt the remainder of that night, and ten hours of daylight pass quickly all the same. John sensed the setting of the sun outside, and slowly opened his eyes. For a moment, he didn’t remember where he was, or where he lay, until he felt a hand reach up to him from below, and wrap softly around his wrist.
“I know exactly how dangerous you are. That's why I came with you.”
“Only you?” John asked, looking around.
“This is a graveyard.”
“Soil from the land of the first vampire, to be correct,” Moriarty pouted.
Sherlock pulled out his phone, and John looked around. Down the street, a man was watering the shrubs outside his home; beyond him, two women walked slowly across the road and into a café. Were it not for the light fog that hung around the streetlamps, the quiet street would be fairly pleasant. The fog, and the possibility that there were slumbering vampires nearby, John reminded himself.
the murderer's behaviour has changed.”Before John could speak, he added, “And that was not an opportunity for you to suggest a motive.”
“This is alright with you?” Sherlock asked as he looked down at John intently, very reluctantly pulling away. He was desperate to get this particular piece of human interaction correct.
Sherlock assented, and started packing up.
“Yes?” John said, looking away from the ceiling. “The one that blew out half our windows?”
“This way,” Sherlock said quietly, conscious of the echo in the small stone room. He gestured at an arch ahead of them. There were few doors in the vaults, but every so often they would have to wait for Greg to pry one open. Some rooms were wide, but the group had to traverse across them hunched over. Other passageways narrow, and they had to progress single file. At one point, Sherlock had to stop and consider two forked routes; trying to transpose his map onto the reality in front of him was not as easy a task as he expected.
“That’s a bit of a let down.”
“Thomas,” John said.
“Oh, they were,” the waitress answered cheerfully, excited to converse with the great detective. “I’m afraid they’re closed at the moment. If you were hoping to do a tour this afternoon I could suggest-”
Keen on not dragging the ordeal out, he pushed his furniture back into place, placing his weapons unceremoniously on the top of his desk. By the time he had left the room and made it to the bottom of the stairs he looked, as expected, relatively untouched. As he entered the living room, it occured to him that he could have changed out of his clothes. At least in his present state he and the others looked equally unclean.
“That was the appetizer, making sure the book was functional. This is the main course,” he said, stopping at the foot of one grave and looking down at it, thoughtful. “We’re going to create daywalkers.”
“I'll see what I can do,” John said, glancing at his phone as he pulled it out. Over the doctor's shoulder, Sherlock saw that he had received multiple texts from numbers he didn't recognize. He shut off the mobile and turned.
John glanced up at Harker, whose attention had finally landed on Mycroft and Moriarty. The pair was locked more in a battle of wits than in brawn, with Mycroft attempting to back Moriarty into the wall.  Moriarty would occasionally dodge forward towards Mycroft, who seemed stable and control of his stake, to the extent that he didn’t notice Harker coming up behind him. John walked back towards Sherlock and borrowed his gun, firing a shot towards Harker, but missing, as a vampire came towards him and grabbed him.
In the darkness, he couldn’t see the tentative smile that pulled at John’s lips, but he felt the mood in the room get slightly warmer all the same.
Mycroft nodded and Greg offered a half-hearted ‘yep’ as he moved to follow her.
“So,” he said, getting everyone's attention. “We don't have much time. We should get started.”
“Good question. Sherlock, do you have enough?”
In the chaos, John noticed Harker slipping out through a narrow archway on the side of the main cavern.
“Don't be so sure,” Sherlock said, keen to get in the last word. He glanced at his watch. “Even accounting for finding a knowledgable vampire within the next few hours, we're late. Might as well get it over with.”
John looked at Jane, then to the inspector. “As far as the army's concerned. They declared me dead after I was involved in a certain... encounter.” He had chosen the word carefully, and still it tasted wrong in his mouth. “I never corrected them. I moved, started using 'Watson' again, and got on with my life. It seemed safer for the rest of my unit that way.”
“I could come in the morning,” John countered.
“That you can see,” she replied, uncrossing her arms and opening her mouth just enough that her fangs could be seen.
“We can give a vampire blood that will fill him with rage, take away his will, control him from afar,” he said, spreading his hands. “We can create them in whatever way we like.”
“But they're not yours,” John confirmed.
“Traffic accident on the road, couldn't get to the Chinese place you like,” John said. “And on my way home I ran into Sarah. It was awkward.” He hoped that explained his behaviour.
“I presume that means we’re on the right track, at the very least,” Sherlock said.
“Maybe not that bad,” John said, and leaned against the building beside him. “There's a club in London. It's hard to find if you're not looking for it, and it's even harder to get in. It's very nearly impossible if you aren't a vampire yourself, actually. It's where vampires and their – I'm not sure what the right word would be –
John then turned to face Lestrade, whose expression of shock was tempered only by his years of practice looking calm while working as a police officer.
Gabriel tilted his head towards John. “I’ll follow your lead.”
Sherlock nodded. “Very nice.”
“There are vampires in the world, there have been for many years,” he began. “They've been written about by nearly every culture, including ours. About a hundred years ago, the first vampire came to London.  Even then, the country was defended – in much the same way you saw tonight – by people who knew the threat that had come for them, and how to fight it. Specifically, these people were Arthur Holmwood, Quincey Morris, John Seward, the Harkers, and Abraham Van Helsing.”
“I did figure that,” she answered.
“My apologies,” Mycroft responded uncomfortably, suddenly self conscious. He didn't notice any blood on his own person – John must have cleaned him up. “How long were you waiting?”
Sherlock, barely visible in the gloom, raised himself up on one elbow and stared at John.
“Is this an interrogation?” The vampire asked, laughing madly before throwing himself back heavily towards the pipe. His hands, pulling in vain at the silver, grew more and more red, and his kicks against the wall shook the room itself.
John shrugged. “Not when avoidable. That going to be a problem?”
Opting to ignore the erection that was demanding his attention, Sherlock made his way to the coffeepot in the corner of the room and focused on it instead. Soon, he heard John waking up, though he didn’t turn to look - instead, Sherlock stared directly at the blank wall ahead of him. It was safer that way, he assured himself. It would be far less distracting than actually
“Yes, and at one point attached to a human body, which was also under her care,” John said, pointing out what he hoped was obvious, “So you owe her.”
John turned to him, a bit lost, but not very bothered that he had lost the thread of the conversation again.
“Skinwalkers,” John answered.
John’s left hand began to shake. He had run into Tom plenty of times before in Romania, Moldova, Spain - wherever a vampire of some significance was recruiting followers, Tom seemed to turn up. He was an enemy, to be sure, but very low-level. Until the moment Mary spoke his name, harmless.
“Are you spitting out dirt?” Sherlock asked, once he had placed the sound.
“I – well, Mycroft and I – were looking at a map of city with the crime scenes and the locations of a few other weird activities marked on it, and it looked like there was a pattern. Once you take out two of the murders, at least, they're the only ones that don't fit. Otherwise it's working on a lunar cycle – the murders are occurring on new moons and full moons. For the most part, anyways. And down the south side is the only area where a body hasn't been found yet.” His gestured as his voice faltered, and looked at Mycroft. “Right?”If the truth was his only option, he was prepared to use only as much of it as he absolutely needed to.
“No,” John confirmed. “Garden variety mind control.”
“You've killed my children, how rude of you,” a voice called from the darkness. A man, dressed surprisingly similar to Mycroft, stepped from the darkness. Standing with his hands behind his back and smiling serenely, he observed the four people before him with a look of amusement. The man was middle-aged and short, with silver hair that shone blue in the light,  and flipped over a phone in his right hand every so often.
“And so did you,” Lestrade said, softly but firmly.
“John Watson, Sherlock Holmes,” John said, looking directly into the figure's eyes. He opened his mouth and allowed his fangs to become visible. Though the man remained silent, he stepped back, and watched John intently as he guided Sherlock down the hall, to yet another flight of stairs.
“Fine, fine, but the paleness,” Lestrade countered, looking at her with an eyebrow raised.
John chuckled.“How do you figure?”
“What's wrong?” Lestrade asked, and was silenced by Mycroft, who raised his hand.
“Right,” John replied. “The guys that died, the group of Americans. They were selected at the same time, so they stood out.”
“Yes,” John answered. “Parts of it were pieced together from various hunts, but the basic story was still there. I'm telling you this because I think it will be easier for all of you to grasp how long vampires have been living among you, and just how dangerous they are, if you have a basic understanding of how they operate.”
“Yes,” John answered.
“Okay,” John said, following along.
“Yes, the case you mentioned. Clearing up that politician's scandal,” John answered without any seriousness.
John used his head start to draw the curtains closed and turn one of the bedside lamps on. In its dim light, painting a golden halo on the sheets, the bed looked undoubtedly inviting. Still, John felt his nerves flutter like a flock of doves being flushed by a hawk. Forcing deep breaths into his reluctant lungs, he untied his shoes and slipped out of them, together with his socks. Those were the most cumbersome items to remove and he didn’t need to increase the risk of making a fool out of himself any further. God, he had never been this bloody nervous. He hadn’t allowed himself to even fantasize about being with Sherlock like this—though his brain wasn’t as easily subdued when he was asleep. But waking up from confusing dreams and then maybe having a shameful wank to release his almost painful erection (thinking about anything but Sherlock, of course) was one thing. Following through with the delightful images his subconsciousness served him—That was at least as terrifying as solitarily crossing hostile lines, armed with nothing but a plastic spoon.
John stirred first and raised his eyes to the ceiling where the little girl cried for attention. Hearing Rosie’s distress brought Sherlock back, as well. He drew in a sharp breath and gained control over his limbs. He had already taken several steps towards the stairs, carefully as if the shards of his last protective wall between them could actually cut his feet. Mumbling that he would look after Rosie, he froze once again as John’s voice cut through the dimly lit room: “No.” This one word was cold and commanding, encrusted with his natural military authority.
who sparked my ambition to write this whole fiction <3 Loads of love to you!
“Okay then.” John straightens his shoulders and gives Sherlock a soft smile. “This was nice.”
“Dear God, will you just let it go already?” Sherlock said immediately with an exasperated eye roll. “Irene and I are just… friends or something resembling that, at least. There was nothing going on between us, ever. Unlike you, I have zero interest in women.”
As they sat down one December evening, both exhausted from assisting Lestrade on a case which unfortunately called for a lot of lengthy stake-outs, the flat lay in comfortable silence. Mrs. Hudson had already put Rosie to bed in her room where she, fortunately, slumbered now. John made tea and handed Sherlock a couple of gingernuts with his cup and a quiet smile before he slumped down on the sofa and turned on the telly.
“Why?” John asks dumbfounded and freezes in the middle of his movement.
“Yes, she is, well, at least when she’s asleep. When she’s in a bad mood, she can be a downright monster,” John said with a chuckle and carefully brushed Rosie’s cheek with his thumb, “but, God, I never loved anyone as much as her. That is such a cliché but it’s true. Having kids makes you realize what unconditional love feels like.”
Seconds thick as honey crept by sluggardly before Sherlock gained control over his limbs again. He wobbled slightly as he came to stand. For a moment, he feared his transport would fail him again and simply collapse under the pressure weighing on him.
The steps behind him stopped at the door and John turned around. The small grin that spread on his lips as he beheld Sherlock’s bare feet soon melted into another smitten smile as his gaze travelled upwards: Sherlock looked positively angelic with his mussed hair and his cheekbones sharp like two Damascene blades. How could someone not want to touch this heavenly creature in every way possible? In the crepuscule, John found his courage, closed the space between them and welcomed him with a passionate kiss. Sherlock sank readily into him, gladly accepting his guidance. John steered him to the bed until the back of Sherlock’s knees met the edge, forcing him to sit.
On the worn-out sofa, they indeed found a girl, tightly rolled into a ball under one of the shock blankets. Her ginger hair blurred into the orange fabric and she looked distinctively pale under her freckles. Even while asleep, she had her brows knitted in worry.
Mary eyes him in the mirror. “God, you look awful,” she says with a pitying smile as she prepares her own toothbrush. “I think there’s aspirin in my wash bag.”
Yet, Sherlock doesn’t move, still frozen in his curled-in position on the chair, his knees clasped tightly to his chest, eyes stubbornly fixed on the bubbling cheese in the oven.
“This is not the same thing, Sherlock. Don’t you dare compare this to Mary!”
“Don’t worry, love, you can stay home with Rosie. I’ve some very secret birthday errands to run.”
“I’m not gonna tell you.”
Why do they have to fly? He hates flying.
began to blast from the speakers.
It doesn’t really matter anymore, anyway. It’s not like anyone cares.
John stops short in the doorway.
“You do?” Sherlock whispered. Why did his voice suddenly sound so hoarse?
Sherlock gestured over to the hedge guarding the property. Something was rustling in them. Next to him, John fell silent as abruptly as if someone had pressed a mute button. Everything was perfectly still. Then, the rustling resumed, more forcefully this time.
“Well, I best be going now. Rosie is overdue for a nap and she gets unbelievably cranky when she falls asleep on the tube,” he says and heaves his daughter into his arm as he gets up.
“What did the good-for-nothing do now?” Mr. Rowley asked with an air of equal parts defiance and exasperation.
: gun violence
Sherlock swallows against his dry throat.
Sherlock sat down and let the morning replay again. His mind still felt clouded by all the unexpected emotions his nightly encounter with John and the subsequent slumber party in his bedroom had stirred in him. He was utterly embarrassed that John had seen him in a position of such weakness but, then again, it wasn’t the first time. If he couldn’t allow himself to be vulnerable in front of John by now their relationship was probably less strong than he had thought. Besides, John hadn’t judged him. John never judged him. He was admittedly quite peeved at him for keeping his nightmares a secret from him but that was it. Ever the good doctor, he had simply taken care of Sherlock, even if that meant to share a bed with his former flatmate.

“I really don’t.”
A few beats passed with only their breaths filling the silence.
“Because Greg invited us and I promised we’d show up,” John replied. “Besides, I couldn’t stand the thought of falling asleep on the sofa by 10 pm. It’s New Year’s Eve, after all. I just want to go out and feel young again, for one night, Sherlock. Lately, all I’ve been thinking about is nappies and teething and if Rosie should’ve started to walk by now. Dear God, I just want one night off, just getting a little drunk and talk to adults about adult stuff and be a little reckless and silly. So, can you, just for this one night, have a few drinks with me and chat with people without complaining? For me?”
Sherlock loves him and wants him to come home, to be— whatever John wants.
And it isn’t just the unexpected pregnancy that has hit John like a meteorite.
“Rowley? Isn’t that—,” Lestrade murmured and dug through the files on his desk until he triumphantly pointed to a list. “Yes, he was on Jason’s graffiti removal squad, got 120 hours for common assault.”
“What’s going on?” Greg manages to ask, pressing his hands into his sides against the stinging pain lodging there.
Sherlock shot John a quick glance, glad to see that their extensive nap had returned the colour to his cheeks, and smiled slightly as John met his gaze. They would take care of each other now. They were not alone anymore.
“Yes.”
“Greg?” Sherlock asks, no,
“No wonder that DC Fuller feels entitled to flirt with you then.”
“Thank you,” John called over his shoulder, already halfway up the stairs, taking two steps at a time.
“What?” all three of their guests exclaimed, their eyes, widened in surprise, springing back and forth between John and Sherlock.
Dark curls were drawn away from overflowing eyes as a head was raised again. “You will eventually.”
Sherlock squirmed at his side but John didn’t budge. “What memories, Sherlock? Honesty, remember?”
A first wave of relief puts out his worst fears but the worried voices in his head can’t be drowned out quite as easily. There are still too many possible threats.
After breakfast, they wrapped themselves and Rosie up in their warmest winter clothes and stepped out into the street. Frost glistened on the few cars parked on Baker Street. The air was crisp and smelled of snow as they entered Regent’s Park. John walked next to Sherlock who steered the pushchair to the right on the sandy footpath that would lead them over the York Bridge and on the Inner Circle. Rosie sat on John’s shoulders and squealed with glee as Sherlock reached up to grab the tiny gloved hand she was stretching out at him. As had so often been the case over the past few weeks, John felt his heart almost burst with love. He smiled brightly and let the warmth saturate his insides, safeguarding him against the chill that tried to soak through his winter coat.
“Have you thought this through?”
Sherlock threw him a sharp glance. “—and b) who would go through the ordeal to drag his dead body all the way here and lean him against the shed. Have you seen the boy? He was, what, 6’, 6’1’’—and rather on the heavy side. Dragging him must’ve cost some effort. He was already dead. Why not just leave him in the dark garden and get away as fast as possible?”
Sherlock trailed off. That girl’s face, freckled and framed by ginger pigtails, had kicked something off in his brain, an itch he couldn’t scratch.
And anyway, it’s no use worrying about the future now, with a week filled with spa treatments and three-course-meals ahead of him.
“Are all of the questions going to be sex-related?” Sherlock asked John under his breath.
Since I've never been to Norfolk and have no knowledge about jellyfish whatsoever, I'm sure there are a lot of discrepancies in this chapter :D Writing cases is an absolute nightmare but concrit is, of course, always welcomed! <3
“No,” he says with an apologetic shrug. When John bites his lips and turns to the bartender for another drink, he adds in an attempt to distract him: “Great wedding, man.”
The cab ride to the yard and the way John leaned into him, a warm hand on his thigh, had Sherlock’s great mood fully restored. By the time they arrived, he was almost giddy.
“It’s venomous,” corrected Sherlock without looking up from the body in front of him.
“In his room. We said our goodbyes and he said he wanted to order something in and prepare for school.”
On the telly, a home video is playing, the date stamp showing that it’s almost a year old.
“And your next best idea was to just pop round, unannounced as I may point out again, and, upon finding I wasn’t home, wait outside for me to come back?”
Sherlock raised his head. “Just tired is all.”
“I know, John. But it’s fine. Usually, I’m just not woken up quite this forcefully.”
I kinda wanna apologize for misleading all (or at least some) of you with the last chapter's cliffhanger. I couldn't resist it! :D And I desperately wanted to involve Mycroft in all of this :)
Sherlock gave a non-committal grunt, his brain too heavily marinated in endorphins to form an actual sentence. He barely registered where he was. As John continued his way to the main road, Sherlock followed him blindly like a sleep-walking puppy, his lead consisting of John’s warm hand in his.
Hello everyone :)
Sherlock took a sip and tried to keep a straight face, unsuccessfully as John’s laughter proved.
Unable to blink, he stares at John whose stance has lost its soldier-like quality. His eyes regard Sherlock with fond concern.
“I hope so. I messed up so badly when he told me all those things, how he had wished for something more between us for years and… I just didn’t notice how much he was hurting. If I can’t make this right… I can’t lose him again.”
“I went to Chelmsford—where I grew up—to visit my parents’ graves.”
John scoffs. “Oh please, the great Sherlock Holmes doesn’t have to do anything. You with your back-up plans and—and exit strategies.”
“Stella warned me about you,” he said in honest delight. “This is gonna be fun.”
“Actually… Would you mind looking after Rosie for a couple more hours?” John asked with an apologetic sigh. How many hours had it been since he’d last held his daughter properly?
That this arrangement had even worked for the past five years was a miracle, after all; Working on murder cases with a toddler on one’s arm was—a challenge, to say the least. In all those years following John and Rosie’s rather rash return to 221B Baker Street, neither John nor Sherlock have dared to talk about its implications for the future. They have simply enjoyed each other’s company, watched Rosie grow into a brilliant, funny girl, lived in the moment—because both know that those bits of happiness vanish faster than you can blink. You need to hold on to them as long as you can. The future will arrive soon enough and spoil all your plans.
“I said shut up.”
John’s eyes widen but his stance doesn’t lose any of its rigidity. “You… you could’ve told me afterwards,” he insists. “I would’ve understood.”
“I promise.”
He recalls the afternoon they spent at the florist all those months ago, looking at roses, lilies, and baby’s breath for the wedding. Mentioning his own floral preferences couldn’t have been more than a passing comment.
Sherlock bites his lip, the fluttering feeling in his stomach being replaced by a cannonball. Everything in his body revolts as his tongue forms the words “That’s… unfortunate.”
Lestrade and Sherlock had managed to subdue the vampires that attacked them, backing one into the jagged edge of a broken crate, and forcing the other out of the alley entirely. John, breathing heavily and picking gravel out of his bloodied palms, tongued at his split lip and stared in to the darkness, watching something neither Sherlock nor Lestrade could see. Mycroft moved forward slightly, guarding part of Sherlock with his arm, protective until the end.
John looked at Sherlock. “We’re a step behind.”
“Aren’t you supposed to be in better shape, as a detective?” Molly asked him in between her own deep breaths.
Slowly, he lifted a shovel up that had been left beside one of the graves. Harker had used it, he imagined, when he was burying his progeny. John considered that he could use one of the existing graves, but decided against it. Sherlock deserved his own, proper burial. John spent the last of his energy digging a long hole deep in the wet soil, considering Sherlock with every shovelful of dirt he threw to the side of the grave. Eventually, when he had no energy left to spare, John stepped out of the hole and walked to Sherlock’s lifeless body, cradling him once more as he carried him towards the grave, lifting him in carefully.
“I will not let you use these people whose lives you’ve stolen to start this war for you,” John said, setting his jaw and clenching his fists. It was almost time.
Molly started up the PC in front of her and opened up a map application and a lunar calendar, not sure if she would need either. She double-checked that the heavy, old rotary phone to her right was functional, and prepared herself to examine every book title in the room in order to learn what she kind of information she had access to. She was ready.
John rolled his shoulders, stretching, and muttered,“Your choice,” walking forward to greet the darkness.
“This kissing thing with both of our fangs out is going to be difficult. Makes it awkward to get close.”
“I’m not particularly graceful today.”
As he turned into the main room, he saw Sherlock absently plucking at his violin, staring at the pale, older man across from himself. Typing on the phone in one of his hands, Mycroft smiled and turned.
“Mycroft!” He called again, giving up.
quickly replaced by his mouth, which opened and bit down.
“Ah, Mycroft. No, I’ve assigned him to something much more vital. Your brother has, ostensibly, gone to find his maker,” George said with a wink.
John paused, gaping at Sebastian, as the realization hit him. “All this time,” he murmured. “All this time I thought you were on the side of the vampires. You want to see the hunters succeed?” He asked, baffled. “The problem was that you didn’t think I was going far enough?”
“What is?”
The remaining fighters began hauling up what was left of the still-living, though severely injured, vampires. Assuming the rest of the military would arrive over the coming days, they would be able to relocate the newborns until Harker could be found and destroyed. He had enough faith in his soldiers that they would find a safe place to keep them in the meantime. Lines of former officers, his friends, filed out of the room, greeting John as they went - some hadn’t even managed to say hello over the course of the battle, merely getting on with their work as directed. John nodded at each of them in turn, aware of their sacrifice. He didn’t want to imagine the mess all of these bodies would cause the Council.
“Coordinates for what?” John asked, quickly taking the paper back and trying to scan it for anything he could recognize.
He turned to the three men who were watching him, blood covering his hands and running down his neck. He looked at Sherlock momentarily, and for a second Sherlock swore he saw a flicker of sadness in the doctor's expression. “I should probably explain this, shouldn't I?”
“Apparently I forgot to submit one of my journals to evidence.” Sherlock looked down at Lestrade, then back to his brother. “Has John told you off yet for kidnapping him again?”
“The latest victim wasn't dead when we found her,” Lestrade said. Everything about his appearance suggested exhaustion.
“I guess I do,” John said, and sat on the edge of his bed, facing Sherlock. “You may not like it. Or you will. I don't know. I'm not to keen on the idea, but...”
“Don't you dare,” John said. “It probably would. I'd never hear the end of it for hurting his baby brother.”
For a moment the only sound that could be heard was the sound of thread whispering past skin.
Sherlock raised a finger, requesting silence, and John watched as the detective put both sheets of paper flat on the bed beside him. Staring intently at them, he ran through every code and numerical classification system he could remember. Gradually, a pattern appeared, and he requested a pen from John. Not long after, he smiled, and handed the sheets back to John.
“Do not mistake my curiosity for concern,” he replied, looking back at his vial of blood.
“One hundred years ago, the Council convened in this very city, and granted Abraham Van Helsing and all of his descendants the exclusive right to assemble the Head Families, and direct them with supreme authority. I’m calling it – bring the army back in.”
Just as the figure reached him, a knife sliced through the air, and just as soon as it had come, the vampire lay unmoving on the pavement. With his toe, John pushed it on to its back, and Lestrade let out a groan as the twisted face rolled to face the group. Its neck, nearly severed, let out a steady river of old blood, pooling around John's feet.
“Sounds like your type,” Lestrade said drily, taking an edge of the tense mood in the car.
Sherlock cleared his throat as the cab stopped outside of the flat, and the pair made their way inside.
“No, I need to, ah,” he searched for words. His intermittent glances at the fridge were enough to clue Sherlock in, and he gestured towards the small, humming appliance.
?” Lestrade asked, analyzing John again.
Lestrade readjusted his grip on his gun. “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.”
“Yes,” John said.
“It's not as though these deaths are an epidemic quite yet. You weren't so worried before.”
“I… agree with Mycroft, actually,” she said, looking at Greg, who was just about to offer his counter-argument.” Before he could interrupt, she said quietly, “I’d rather be well-rested and prepared, than efficient and surrounded by vampires.”
Sherlock's jaw clenched and he leaned forward. “I would have better luck.” The men stared at one another, in a battle of wits, before Lestrade broke and looked away, shaking his head.
“Molly and I were just printing off the map. Are we ready to go?”
Sherlock looked John over and shrugged. He began playing with his bow again, and for what felt like the hundredth time in his life, he wished that Sherlock would pay more attention to the concerns of others.
“Yes, you really should. You have coffee to drink as you contemplate all of the dead ends you've reached,” Sherlock said sarcastically.
– clawed at the ground ahead of him as he tried to pull himself forward, jagged bolts of pain running across his chest and through his arms.
The intruders to the base seemed to be exclusively vampire. That was strange enough - most vampires were, to a fault, antisocial. They didn’t - wouldn’t - organize themselves into large groups for anything, much less battle. Not since Dracula held sway over the Carpathians, anyways. More worrying still, they seemed trained, and foreign; these were not just local vampires causing havoc. John wouldn’t have been surprised to learn he knew some of the attackers by name.
“Yeah, this time a young woman. Didn't find her until this morning, either, so we aren't sure yet when she was killed,” Lestrade said, and John could hear the weariness in his voice.
“You're an awful shot,” John said, glancing at the third jar to break, and wondering what kind of flowers he should buy Mrs. Hudson this time around as an apology.
“Yeah, it is,” John replied.
“Not a problem,” John answered, nodding back towards him.
“The only vampires London has anymore are very good at hiding what they do. The only time a mature vampire would leave a body behind would be if it were trying to create a new vampire, and failed. Turning has its risks, obviously, but for a practiced vampire it becomes easier  - say for every ten people that are turned, one dies in the process. A pretty good success rate, as it goes, but it's rare for a vampire to attempt to create any more than two. There have been four deaths so far, not counting the ones you're responsible for.”
“Fine, fine,” John answered, particularly not-fine at that very moment. “Who’s leading the battle?”
Sherlock avoided snorting at him. “You were supposed to go to the nearest, cheapest restaurant for provisions. Clearly you were unsuccessful.”
“I've asked around for you, and I haven't turned up much,” she said, putting the phone down. “Not about these murders specifically.”
“Anderson, he won't be there, will he?” Sherlock interrupted, having overheard John and Lestrade's conversation, and speaking loud enough that the man on the other line heard him.
“Sorry, did you say through?” Greg asked. Sherlock shrugged.
Surprisingly optimistic, John walked over to his bed and flopped back onto the crumpled sheets.
“Nah,” John replied, knowing what his friend was considering. “Too many tourists. Too open. Would be a neat place to turn someone, though. There’s something to be said for using places of societal significance to turn someone. Beyond plain old hallowed ground, I mean,” he added, glancing over at Sherlock.
Across the road, John saw one of his higher ranking officers, Gabriel, moving quickly against two vampires to try and subdue them. John, coming around from behind, pulled one of the other man’s stakes from his belt and lunged at the stronger of the two vampires. Now evenly matched, the vampires struggled to fight against John and his colleague. As they backed the pair towards a fenced-in outbuilding, John glanced quickly at Gabriel.
One of the most underrated benefits of vampire blood was not its ability to heal wounds or its usefulness as an aphrodisiac, but its ability to slow the world down. John saw Moriarty’s stake heading for his heart, watched the candlelight illuminate it with a yellow glow, and knew he didn’t have time to stop it. This time, he didn’t expect he was going to survive; unlike Sebastian, Moriarty was aiming to kill.
tells us what just happened?”
Sighing, John put his hands on his hips and glanced across everything he had strewn across the bed. He’d faced worse odds, but usually had the benefit of more information. Sherlock chose that moment to come in, and started unfolding the two maps he had just printed, laying them out on the double bed that wasn’t presently covered in weapons.
Sherlock walked over and looked at the marks on the map, eventually perching himself on the edge of a chair to analyze it further. John sat down as well and pretended to thumb through a magazine, watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eye.
“Er - nothing you’re going to like,” she admitted.
“And I was second,” Sebastian repeated. “Not all vampires care to follow the Van Helsings, John. Neither do all humans, for that matter.” At this, Sebastian readied his fist and launched it directly at John, landing on his cheek and immediately breaking his orbital bone. The next few hits landed just as efficiently, bringing John to his knees. His gun fell, forgotten, into the sand beside him. Sebastian returned to loading up his Panther with the help of several vampires who seemed willing to obey him.
Sherlock glanced back at the vampire, shut off the light, and followed.
Sherlock led them in, and once everyone was in the narrow stone hall, John pushed on the door until it clicked firmly into place. Sherlock pulled out a torch from his coat and illuminated the otherwise pitch black cavern.
Sherlock blinked. “Oh, for Christ’s sake.”
John nodded, and zipped his coat up a little farther against the cold air. “So many uncertainties. I don’t like it.”
“Smells like rotting flesh,” John said, face screwed up in a frown. “We’re veering directly into not-good-very-bad territory.”
“You seem… better,” Sherlock said, choosing his words carefully.
Sherlock received a laugh, and felt a bit of the concern that was growing at the edges of his consciousness abate.
John thought about that for a moment, watching the sun as it reached the edge of a distant building, and departed soundlessly. He chased after Sherlock, but his friend neither slowed or responded to his questions, and left in his own cab. Even at Baker Street, Sherlock wouldn't speak, throwing slides and papers towards the trash before changing into pajamas and curling up on the couch.
“So, I started asking around to see if anyone's noticed anything weird - all for you, my friend, so keep in mind you owe me - and all I can come up with is a bloke in Wales who says a bunch of warehouses are being bought up in his area. I cant get any further than that with the public records office until I start mentioning you, because apparently throwing around the name 'Van Helsing' is the only thing that gets things done around here. Which is fine enough, because eventually they let me look into the property records, and lo and behold, who's the buyer but Simon Wilcox. Do you remember him?"
“Excellent,” Mycroft replied, picking up his umbrella and walking towards the stairs, looking back at John and Sherlock. “My car is outside. Have a pleasant evening, brother.” Sherlock didn't look at him.
Sherlock, still a little bewildered by the encounter, cleared his throat and began walking with John towards the door, not quite sure where the other man was going.
Sherlock nodded at the map behind him. “That's what you've been working on for the last few weeks, haven't you?”
John recalled the first and only other time that he had pressed that button. He was still young, new to the base that had just been established. Every rogue vampire created during the war that the humans were waging had come running, and John was more than willing to set his corner of the world in order. He had set off the sirens, announced to the base that “ladies and gentlemen, we are at war,” then proceeded to win the briefest, bloodiest, and most orderly battle in recent memory.
“Hello?” He said, after glancing quickly at the caller ID and tapping the speakerphone icon.
By the time Sherlock made his way outside, John was sitting on the curb of the road, two paper cups of coffee from the chain across the street waiting beside him. He handed one cup to Sherlock as he flipped through his phone.
Sherlock glanced at the pub to his left. “Dinner?”
“This is it,” Sherlock answered, sure that they were in the correct place. “Careful -” he began, but too late; John was already pressing his palm softly on the center of the door.
Lestrade continued, “Not that I’d ever be able to tell them what I’m doing here. That’s a kick in the bollocks, isn’t it?”
“You could have stayed in the army,” Sherlock countered. “Given time, I’m sure you would have been commended for maintaining most of the personnel and information you were in charge of.” Sherlock meant it as a compliment - it was not received as such.
Lestrade stared at him as though he had turned green. “A vampire has just broken in and
Mary shook her head. “He’s gone. Far away, already. You would never catch up.”
“Are the vaults open today?” He said, with a smile false enough that John looked up, brow furrowed, but undeniably amused. “Our map says they’re just down the road.”
“Who are you? Why didn't you just ask me why I wanted to talk to you?”
“Me neither,” Greg replied, pursing his lips. Something felt wrong – years of work on the force had fine tuned his intuition.
“Mycroft’s dead?” the group heard Greg ask through broken teeth, and John felt a rush of pride for the DI, still following the plan.
Sherlock was struck by the cruelty of what had just been inflicted on his friend. “Someone’s guarding against you, specifically, then.” Sherlock said.
Neither man spoke as John considered this.
“Maybe it was ghosts,” John said seriously.
“Your thoughts, doctor?”
"An absolutely useless excuse for a nightwalker, tried to turn his grandmother, the bloody idiot, and The Council had to sort him out. Never mind that. So I confront him, and he hasn't the slightest clue what I'm talking about, he just wants to get back to selling overpriced cocaine to public school kids, or whatever the hell kind of racket he happened to be involved in that day. So he's annoyed, trying to get me off his back, but he does say that he's heard about all the real estate purchases, and keeps hearing the word 'army trio' tossed around. Now I know that rings a bell, doesn't it?"
Mycroft sighed. “You knew I'd try to kill you.”
Molly looked around. “I have no idea.”
“My name is George,” he answered. “We have a mutual friend in one Mr. John Watson, I believe – and we must return to London at once.”
Lestrade looked at Sherlock, then John, then pointed at himself as his brow furrowed. John rolled his eyes and nodded.
“Oh, no, I insist. It would be a very short meeting.”
“Stop while you're ahead.”
To distract Sherlock from the annoyance he was now feeling with himself, John continued. “Next time I’ll leave you with a little more blood. Try to make the lightheadedness hit you less like a bottle of vodka, and more like a glass of wine.”
Molly glanced between the two men.
That gave Greg pause. “Wouldn’t it be better to go now? While it’s still light out?”
“Evening.”
“Book of the Undead,” John said, equally indifferent. “Virtually no one has seen it, much less tried to read it. Most vampires sincerely believe it was written in the hand of Dracula.”
Sherlock pulled at John’s jumper, then began work at the buttons of his shirt. He moved quickly, trying not to lose his nerve - he tried to tell himself that this was his way of slowing John’s panic, of taking his mind off the subject of their impending battle. He knew this to be false. He was selfish, exploring every inch of John that became available as his clothes came off, tasting and touching flesh that he had never before indulged in feeling.
expect when she came into her lab that morning was seeing London's greatest mind perched on the edge of a metal slab, holding a tape measure up to a corpse.
“That way,” John said to Sherlock, gesturing to the left with his head.
Looking up, John was surprised to see he hadn’t missed Harker entirely - his hand was bleeding and smoking where a silver bullet had nearly blown through his palm. The vampire, who had seemed more or less composed and human throughout their encounter - fangs aside - now bared his teeth and hissed, screaming something inarticulate at his progeny as he gestured towards Sherlock and John. Finally, one of the newborns broke out of the fugue state he seemed to be in, and rushed at John. Slightly late on the uptake, John was tackled and felt the vampire biting at the skin it landed on, across his arms.
“It’s holy water,” John clarified. “Spread as much of it around as you can. I’m not sure if these things are following vampire rules, but it can’t hurt.” Sherlock followed John’s instructions, and took the interior of the building while John poured drops of water around the perimeter, making sure to soak the ground by the entrance.
He slowly turned the stake in his hand, a finger brushing along its base. Jane tilted her glass, finished it off, and smiled, blood dripping down one of her fangs. She stood, facing the man before her.
“At least. Something of this magnitude had to be arranged by an old vampire, which changes the ratio. There could be a hundred new vampires in London.”
John sat up, and squinted at Sherlock. “You okay?”
“—stuff. I’m comfortable with anything when it comes to you but I’m not really sure what’s… appropriate and don’t want to embarrass you so I propose you determine our level of displaying affection in public. I want you to decide—if that’s alright with you—whether to take my hand or—”
Frustration is clogging John’s throat. “This is messed up, honestly. What are you expecting me to do?”
A white wall of fury blinded Sherlock at his words. After all this time, after witnessing the nightmares that still tormented him, John still hadn’t understood. He still didn’t get what Sherlock had done for him.
“Oh.” Sherlock nodded slightly, staying silent for a second before fixating John again with curious eyes: “Anything else you didn’t request?”
Only John is tethering him to earth, keeping him centred and safe with his lips pressed to Sherlock’s.
“So, do you love me?” he croaks out, a hint of the mischievous grin Sherlock adores so much tugging at his lips.
“Picking up—,” John echoed in confusion. “What? No.” Had Sherlock already decided that they could no longer live together? Even after John had told him that he wanted to make up, that he was sorry? Would Sherlock, after confessing his feelings, really throw away a chance of reconciliation just like that? That didn’t make sense. What the hell was going on here?
“Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment,” he stated, turning the card in his fingers before taking a closer look at the gift itself. It was a brand-new smartphone, the shiny display brightly reflecting the warm light of the sitting room. He valued the model at about 599£, a considerable sum to spend, even for a partner’s birthday present. “Expense of the phone says— Oh.”
Sherlock had just begun to disassemble the second bookshelf as a faint beep crept to his ear. Instantly, he stopped his frantic fumbling and stared at his desk. Panic arose in him. He had waited hours for this sound but, now that the moment of truth had finally arrived, he was incapable of getting up to actually look at the text he’d just received; the text that would be the signpost for his future relationship with John Watson. He just sat there, frozen, environed by the gigantic mess he had made, and felt his heartbeat stumble in his throat.
,” Mr. Beaumont said, clearly familiar with the procedure. “We arrived at 8 and stayed for the whole evening. The staff and our friends can vouch for that.”
“Breakfast. Yesterday,” Sherlock confessed after a beat.
“As you wish, your majesty,” responds Sherlock’s silky baritone. He has never been one for strict parenting, John thinks as another melody begins. He would spoil Rosie rotten if John didn’t interfere, his heart being simply unable to deny her anything.
“I’ve risked my life for you every single day for months, making sure that none of Moriarty’s henchmen would try to use you as leverage against me. And after I finally succeeded, after I had gotten myself beaten and battered, I came back and you were gone. You had moved on without me. I know you suffered, I know I put you through hell but I never doubted that you would understand
Are you still there? I really didn't mean to wait this long before posting again (felt like ages for me, at least) but I had work and some real trouble getting this chapter onto (digital) paper. I hope you are not disappointed with the result of my struggles :)
Sherlock painted the words on his jaw with light kisses: “I don’t want to forget any of this. Ever. I need to remember how you respond to me, what you feel like.”
John rinses his mouth, rummages through Mary’s toiletries, and takes out the little package with a grateful nod. He dissolves one of the tablets unceremoniously in his toothbrush glass und takes a sip. The bubbles tickle his nose in a way that John finds unbearably annoying.
“I hit back once and the only thing the police did was give me anger management therapy and force me to remove graffiti for hours and hours. They sent someone by our flat and nothing happened. No one actually cared. And things got so much worse afterwards. I could’ve taken it but my sister… She’s so young, so soft. And she’s stuck with them every day.”
Mellow smiles and bashful looks being traded, John cautiously closed the distance between them since Sherlock seemed still unable to move his limbs.
They seemed to have tapped into an inexhaustible spring of desire with their first kiss. Ever since that salvific confession, Sherlock was barely able to contain the pent-up want permanently humming in every fibre. He could still not quite grasp what exactly was happening to his body—hormones alone could never account for this unique sensation. But, whatever it was, for once, he wasn’t complaining.
“Not to my knowledge, no. I was here to prevent worse.”
His thoughts are torn from his musings when the speech takes a different turn. For a few equally confusing and excruciating minutes, Greg is sure that Sherlock is either trying to ruin the wedding after all… or has just completely lost it. He’s almost relieved as the reason for Sherlock’s peculiar—well, more peculiar than usual—behaviour reveals itself to be an attempted murder rather than a broken heart.
“For decades, I guess. I just never had the courage to accept it.” John met Harry’s eyes and let her overt joy infect his own lips until a shy smile bloomed on them. “That’s why I wanted to meet you, Harry; not only to tell you but to apologize that I was such a hypocrite. Always telling you to aim for something higher, to make better choices, and secretly being glad when things didn’t work out. I was… just so envious of you. You never pretended to be something you’re not. You were always true to yourself, no matter the cost. I admired you so much. And then I saw what happened to you after you came out. Every time Dad called you a freak or an abomination or a disgrace I had the chance to step up and share the pain with you but I didn’t. I was just so scared. Instead, I let you take all the shame and despised you for your freedom. Over the last thirty years, I didn’t spend a single day without hiding this part of me from the world and myself. Even after Dad was gone, I couldn’t find the courage to follow your lead. That’s what I wanted to apologize for. I shouldn’t have left you alone with this, because you never were. I should have been your ally instead of blaming you for my own cowardice. I really am so fucking sorry, Harry.”
John glanced at the street signs that were passing quickly. They would be home soon.
John had always been pleased to work on such a well-equipped, well-protected base. He felt a sense of pride that he was not only trusted enough to take care of it, but to take charge as well. His regiment was not especially well-publicized; certainly, the fact that vampires existed was all but forbidden to speak of outside of the highest echelons of the army. Nevertheless, John and his recruits knew that they were part of something important. Possibly part of one of the most important regiments on earth.
“Witnesses for what?” Sherlock asked before John could.
John took a step from Sherlock, whose eyes were wide as he drew his own conclusions. “It hadn’t come up yet.”
Sherlock’s finger ran down to the last set of items on the list. “These ones are all in code?”
John sighed. “I know, Molly. I do. We just don’t have it.”
John paused, and chose his next words delicately. “Some things are best left unknown. When Mary died…” His voice trailed off momentarily, and he coughed. “If I had sincerely believed that what was in that book would work, and that it would be a good thing, I would have let the base burn just to decipher that book and bring her back.”
The stake hovered a breath away from Sebastian’s rapidly beating heart.
There was silence, then a softly muttered, “that’s enough.” John turned over, ending the discussion.
Sherlock plucked John’s phone out of his pocket and smiled, pleased to be able to offer John something that no one else could. “We may not have Mycroft, but I’ve memorized every contact in his phone. We will be fine.”
?” He asked, incredulous.
“Fine.”
Slowly, John stopped squeezing his eyes shut with quite as much force, and regained control of his breathing. “Fucking hell,” he muttered.
“Mycroft?” He said.
When the doctor reentered the room, arms laden with granola bars, Sherlock looked up. “Some of these buildings were on the list Jane gave you. What's the connection?”
However, John wanted to keep them talking, now that they were here. And in the midst of so many graves, a part of John was desperate to learn what was being planned.
The detective inspector nodded, while neither Holmes made any sort of movement. John walked around the chair he had been pacing behind and sat down on the edge of it, glancing at Sherlock before he spoke, but keeping most of his focus on the others.
It was at approximately this time that the chained vampire realized that he was at the mercy of other vampires to free him, and let out an inhuman cry. Sherlock and John listened to it fade into the distance as they ran up the stairs and exited the building, moving swiftly past the guard at the door. Once outside, they glanced at one another, and without a word, took off running for the nearest major street.
Without another thought towards him, John immediately fell back to the floor, bit his wrist, and held it up to Sherlock’s mouth. The healing properties of John’s own blood had always been suspect, but John didn’t have time to experiment and make sure it was optimal. Even as he tilted Sherlock’s head back and guided the blood down his friend’s throat, he knew that it likely wouldn’t fix a mortal wound. He had never had to push its limits.
“Case a few years back,” Sherlock answered, and rang the bell.
“The families of the two people I killed, I will find some way to make amends.”
The darkness that crept into his mind, willing his muscles to move against his own will, slowly overwhelmed each of the man’s senses. As though in a dream, he watched as his hands clawed against the dark clay of the floor, pushing him upwards until he stood. His eyes blank and his expression slack, Mycroft looked out of his bodily prison into the darkness.
As Molly typed, she added the notes, Googling the locations for additional information in the brief silences where no one had anything to contribute. So far, nothing was coming up – the list of warehouses and abandoned buildings really did seem to be just a list of empty spaces.
In the moments before he lost consciousness, falling into the fog of his mind as his world went grey, he thought he saw John leaning down, guiding him to the floor.After a few seconds, he heard only the sound of a single heart beating.
“Yeah?” John asked.
"The problem with having enemies that will never die is that they can wait until you're at your weakest; they can bide their time, obsess over whatever it is you've done to wrong them, until it consumes them. Then they act. Sometimes that time is in the middle of a war, sometimes it's the single night you forget to sleep with a stake or a rosary - or maybe it's the night your wife goes into labour."
Almost hungrily, Moriarty paced among the men and women. “Well done,” he said excitably. “I’ll need to borrow some of these guys.”
“No,” Sherlock agreed. “Though I am intrigued. Was it fixed by your network?” He said, emphasizing the last word with a bit of bitterness. He still felt left in the dark.
“When I was thirty-four, I met Mary. Christ, I thought I was so lucky,” John said, laughing disbelievingly and looking up at the ceiling of the train compartment, doing his best not to break down. Sherlock, likewise, appeared grim for the sake of not letting his emotions get the best of him. He had expected, perhaps naively, that John’s past was more straightforward.
Tilting his head to the side slightly, Mycroft smiled, observing the shorter man's movements.
“I bit early, isn’t it?”
The other man continued to pace. “Even if I brought every seismic charge we have, it still wouldn’t be enough. We have no idea how many of them are down there!”
John looked from one man to the other. “Are we being taken off the case?” He asked, crossing his arms and nodding at the folder on Lestrade's desk.
Harker shrugged. “We disagree on the specifics of this war. I’m quite confident the humans will win - they’ve set down their bets on the opposing side.”
The faint outlines of four people could be seen in the gloom that hung heavily over the room.
A crowd had started to gather just inside the door, as those near the commotion in the back of the bar began to take notice of John, Sherlock, and the other man.
Sherlock still hadn’t spoken, and was not used to that change of pace. However, he also recognized when John was in the middle of formulating a plan. Seeing his flatmate work through his ideas felt excruciatingly slow, but for once Sherlock knew better than to comment on it. Eventually, John looked back up at George, and raised himself up to his full height.
“Would have been nicer twenty years ago,” he muttered.
“And you want me to go home?” She confirmed.
“That’s quite enough, isn’t it?” a voice said from behind him.
Thomas touched a fang to one of his lower teeth. “I do not take orders from -”
Slowly, John walked in, followed by a tall, pale man, an older gentleman in a suit – a politician? She could swear she had seen him in the background of a few news reports – a small, brunette woman, and a detective from the Met. She recognized him immediately, though she doubted he would remember her. She stood and walked around the table, stopping a few meters from John, who had also paused.
“Are we doing this hotter-colder style, or more like Marco Polo?” John asked, trying to get his bearings. He knew the city well, but not quite as well as London.
John checked the time on his blood-spattered phone. “Tomorrow. All of us are going to need to get as much sleep as we can get. It could be our last chance for a while.”
“We need to go,” John said simply, as distant sirens began to fill the air. Mycroft gestured to his car and in moments the group was off.
“You’re making coffee?” John slurred, not quite awake.
Sherlock, concerned, grabbed his upper arm and pulled John back to face him.
“Sherlock, will you be alright taking down some vampires?” John asked as he picked up a couple of the knives that had been confiscated earlier in the evening.
“Then who is that?” He murmured, a single finger pointed up.
“I very much doubt that,” he replied. “Call Lestrade.”
“Chasing a vampire back to Transylvania, a shipwreck, stakes and holy wafers, that all happened?” Lestrade asked, pulling what he could remember about the book from the recesses of his memory.
“Dull. Why?”
“Silver,”he murmured.
“Lunch?” Sherlock asked, hands in the pockets of his long coat. “All this walking should have earned it back.”
“You haven't invited a sixth guest to this meeting, have you, John?” Mycroft asked, looking up.
“Do you imagine he was serious?” Sherlock pondered aloud, tracing the fresh scars across the doctor’s chest.
“The book states that it can be done, and it will be - tonight,” he said, staring into John’s eyes a little longer before releasing him. “The things that book could tell you…” He walked towards Sherlock again, leaning in towards his ear, and murmured, just loud enough for John to hear, “we could bring back Dracula himself, if we wanted to.”
“Can we discuss this when we're not in the middle of the street?”
“Answer me, damn you, or I’ll aim a bit more to the left.”
John stared at him. “Are you worried?” What would a worried Sherlock look like, anyways?
“Fairly terrible, it’s happening tonight. Tell me you’ve found something.”
John felt the gun drop from behind his head, and Sebastian walked around John in a wide circle, keeping a safe berth. Sebastian looked much the same as John remembered, but a scar stretched between his right temple and through one of his eyebrows. John recalled inflicting it; it hadn’t healed well.
Sherlock seemed to stand up straighter, and any sense of excitement for that night fell away. His face became set and serious, and his hand - previously tapping on the band of his watch - stilled. He now had a  stake in the game.
“A vampire. As far as anyone in my family can figure, I underwent about half the turning process. I'm first human to come out of it alive, actually.”John smiled and shook his head. “Which makes me...” He trailed off, and Sherlock spoke for him.
“No!” he screamed, leaping forward to grab the detective, setting him down on the ground softly.
John looked warily at the entrance to the caves. “Psychological blast,” he said, a bit shakily. “Some vampires, not a lot, can create them. It temporarily imbues an object with a memory, or a sensation.”
“Someone will notice all this blood.”
The vampire paused briefly in his protestations to gaze at Sherlock, then John.
“Right now...” John surveyed the maps in front of him, and the guns on the table. Everything was in order, and there wasn't much he could do until nightfall. “Nothing, I guess. Rest a bit, maybe.”
The car pulled in to the cracked driveway that circled around the front entrance of the lobby, or what would have possibly been called the lobby in the hotel's better days. As it was, when the pair entered, they were met with a wave of stale air and dust. The foyer was sparse, decorated with a few outdated chairs and dim lights; all together, it was perfect for the pair.
Sherlock, too stunned to articulate his thoughts, nodded. He obediently drank from the glass John offered, and handed it back once it was empty.
The only person who moved was Sherlock, who leaned forward, his hands forming a steeple under his chin as a smirk inadvertently flitted across his face. Every puzzle came together eventually.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
“Who’s there?” Greg called as he looked all around himself, then stopped and groaned. “Why do I ask? It’s always vampires.” Molly readied her weapon and tried to use the faint light to see into the shadows.
“Such as?”
“Not yet,” Sherlock muttered and looked away, adjusting one of the dials on his microscope.
“Look and see.”
John himself began loading up gear, tending more towards hands-on combat weapons - blades, stakes, and what Sherlock thought was a sai being slipped into a custom-made slot near the back of John’s cross-body holster. One gun made the cut, along with several dozen silver bullets. Once zipped up, the group could pass as ordinary, if slightly uncomfortable-looking, visitors to the city.
Moving in the dim light of his bedside lamp, John laid out the map of London on his sparse desk and, with a red pen, marked down locations, some that were crime scenes, and some that were new.  When he finished, he crossed his arms and looked down at it.
“Pity,” Sherlock said, a genuine smile tugging at the corner of his mouth as he looked towards John. “Well, anyways, thank you for all your help…” He trailed away, and the waitress supplied her name. “Alice, great, thanks so much.”
“I'm getting dinner,” John said, pulling the zip of his coat up. “Try not to shoot anything while I'm gone.”
Molly was by no means unfamiliar with libraries, but it was not often that she had free time to spend in the British Library examining its extensive collections. It was an even less frequent occurrence that she was allowed access to the magnificent rare book collection that the library housed. During her present visit, she had bypassed the rare book section entirely when she was brought to the basement of the building through hidden doors and false walls.
At this, Jane seemed uncomfortable.
“It can’t be done,” John said, coolly, “least of all by you.”
over the soul of the elder Mr. Holmes.”
John was positive that whatever was going to come out of Sherlock's mouth next would be unpleasant and require more apologies than he had time to give, so he spoke first. “Makes sense. I know this isn't pleasant for you.”
“I hope you were going to call about taking a look at these bodies, because things have just gotten worse.”
Interrupting him, George said, “Sherlock, please, I would really rather not see our dear Doctor Watson maimed tonight, without good reason. If you must hate someone, hate me; I turned him.”
John sighed, and Sherlock wasn’t sure if he was going to reply at all when he finally spoke. “It’s more likely Moriarty was trying to get in a dig. Emotion trips you up when you’re trying to work, Sherlock – Dracula does the same to me. A great distraction.”
Sherlock nodded. “Certainly. It feels as though we’re coming towards a conclusion, but the particulars aren’t there yet. Tomorrow, I’d like to go walking across the city.”
Had he been able to see himself, he would have noticed the sunken blue rings around his eyes, which were gradually fading as he applied a hot towel to the area. Walking around helped displace the blood too, and Mycroft did his best to stretch out his arms and legs in the narrow room. He had neglected to bring an extra change of clothes, but knew better than to fret about it. After a few minutes, he was washed, brushed, and feeling far more like his usual self, ignoring the ever-present desire for blood. He ignored the voice in his head that murmured about that subject.
“Maybe we should just accept that
“Pardon?”
is a vampire, besides us,” Lestrade said, as he turned and sat beside Molly.
“Ah,” Mycroft said, covering the bewilderment in his expression easily. “Quite right.”
The vampire turned back to them, pulled a handkerchief from the jacket of his suit, and wiped the dust from his hands.
Without so much as glancing up, Sherlock a bite from the corner. “It's terrible.”He looked directly at John and held it up, as though displaying evidence.
“Christ, what was
“Harker’s left you behind,” John said, full of rage and unexpressed pain. With the benefit of being above Sebastian, he landed a punch squarely in the other man’s jaw. “It’s over.”
John listened. The sound of footsteps, unmistakeable in the silent flat, thumped overhead. “Fuck.” He muttered quietly.
“And they don't attract any attention, these vampires? It seems as though it would be something vampire hunters would frown upon.”
“You know all the bodies that have come in lately?” John asked as he stood.
“Do you have any great ideas you're not letting on to?” John asked, turning to Sherlock and enjoying the few moments of relative quietness they had.
“This is the first one since the empty crime scene,” she said, tilting her head as she tried to follow Sherlock's movements. “All the blood without a body.”
"John has my request under consideration. Has the detective inspector taken pity on you and allowed you back on the case?"
“Yes, I suppose so,” Molly replied, turning completely to face the body on the ground. A line of blood, following the path of the uneven floor, crept closer to them.
Sherlock waved for a waitress, who walked over shyly. From the way her eyes flicked between himself and John, it was clear she was a fan of the blog. Sherlock, averse to ‘fans’ as he was, was pleased - he could at least use it to his advantage.
John didn't speak.
She finished off her glass and sat back, closing her eyes and feeling the group that was walking towards her come closer. They opened the moment a hand started to press on the door, creaking in the silence of the room. The bar was empty, as were the tables around her – she had arranged for privacy, and she was sure none of the employees here would be foolish enough to disregard her request.
“Tell the consulting ten-year-old that, yes, Anderson will be there,” Lestrade said firmly, and John hoped Sherlock heard his tone of voice. “And I would very much appreciate if he didn't push him into the river.”
Sherlock sighed. “I don't see why it would be any more believable coming from him than it would be from me.”
“Where’s Molly?” he asked, giving a cursory glance to the three people he had just been introduced to. He flipped open his laptop and loosened one of the wires connected to a camera.
The older vampire sighed, and made a waving gesture at the man to his left. They made eye contact, and the gun was dropped to the ground.
“Oh, god,” Sherlock moaned, rolling his eyes and falling back into his chair. He crossed his legs at the ankle and stared at John. “You can't be trusted with sweaters.”
“Come right in,” Lestrade said, sighing and gesturing at the seats in front of his desk. “Everyone else is scouring the city. Half of my team's at the crime scene, the other half is still at the hospital. That's where I'll be shortly as well, but I though I'd speak to you two while I still have a bit of free time.”
“I’m sure you will,” John replied, winking, and began to make a path through the melee. The young vampires, who had formerly seemed slow and zombie-like as they got their bearings, were now moving quickly, fighting with hands and fangs, taking down humans whenever they could. Still under Harker’s spell - clearly Mycroft hadn’t been able to stop him quite yet.
“Hi.”
John accepted this plan, and immediately began making a call on his phone. He did not receive a busy signal, only silence. He tried a second number, and was met with continuous ringing.
Sherlock was caught off guard. Did he still have -? No, he was fine. “Yes, of course.” Sherlock said, as his scattered thoughts attempted to come together into their usual uniformity.
Sherlock found himself holding John’s head between his hands, insistently pressing his tongue at John’s lips until they parted. It was a curious thing, kissing – that was the sole thought that emerged with any coherence through the fog of Sherlock’s brain. Distantly, he realized this was the first time he had ever kissed someone for the sake of wanting to do so, to resolve some kind of sexual impulse.
Lestrade and Sherlock continued out, but it wasn’t long before Sherlock came back in the room, closing the door softly behind him.
“There,” John said, more to himself than the other men, as he directed the group to a large alley, directly between two abandoned brick warehouses. The atmosphere had become so dark that, though there was a streetlight in the passage, the end of it could not be seen.
John stared at her, mouth slightly open, then let his head fall into his hand, chuckling in disbelief. “Why am I surprised? There's no reason for me to be surprised. It's -” He paused and looked at the people still standing behind him. “Are you lot going to sit down?” He gestured at the other chairs around the table, which the group still stood a safe distance from. Taking the lead, Mycroft hung his umbrella over the back of an adjacent chair and sat down, quickly followed by the rest of John's companions.
“Not yet,” Sebastian replied, trying to get leverage as John hit him yet again. “You think this is the only plan we had? The only graveyard?” Sebastian was finally able to free one of his arms, and punched John in the side, pushing himself up and landing a kick in John’s ribs.
Moriarty didn’t notice his mocking tone.
"There are a lot of things I'm not telling you," John muttered as he climbed the stairs.
Sherlock turned towards the noise of the snarling creature, which snapped at the air next to John’s neck. John, rapidly losing air, tried to avoid being bitten. Once Sherlock willed himself to move, he lunged towards the arms of the monster, trying to pull them from John. However, whenever he came close to achieving a solid grip, the skin beneath his fingers would pull away in grey layers. If he had more time to consider the situation, Sherlock likely would have been repulsed. As it was, he could only focus on John, whose movements were slowing.
Mycroft's eyes narrowed. “How dangerous do you imagine I am, John? How fast do you believe I could kill you?”
“By the time I reached your brother’s office, the other vampire had already cut into the man’s neck. I did not know whether or not he had given Mycroft any of his blood. While your brother lay bleeding on the floor, as surprised as I imagine he ever had been in his life, I was able to distract the other vampire, and drive a stake through him in the confusion.”
“You've permanently scarred Lestrade,” he said, moving to sit at the coffee table across from John.
His room, upon first glance, appeared clean. It was only when he stepped closer to his closet that the chaos became more noticeable. An old oak dresser, turned to the side, had been disassembled to reveal a panel at the back of it that held a menagerie of weapons. Predominately made out of silver, the various blades and chains caught the light and reflected on the dark walls around them. On the floor lay a collection of guns, which John in his haste had lain out as he tried to decide which would best suit his task. He had chosen his army pistol in the end, but going through his usual routine gave him a sense of comfort. Now, he found himself opening a separate panel above the others to reveal a small refrigerator. Within, neatly arranged and labeled in a fine script were plastic bags – discreet, opaque, and kept on hand at all times, just in case. He had kept the men downstairs for a reason – they didn't need to see this. Not quite yet.
“Came in last night,” Lestrade answered, eager to be helpful. “Twenty-eight, male, a postal worker. Doesn't seem to have any connection to the other cases.”
“You put her in control of central ops?” John asked George, smiling.
“Mysteries are meant to be solved. All things have a logical end. Murderers always make an error of judgement, and reveal their cards, or reveal themselves.” He paused. “This one has not.”
“I appreciate it,” Sherlock said. “Next time?”
“Almost sunrise,”he confirmed. Knowing something was wrong, he glanced around the room in time to notice that he had left his weapon on the desk at the far end of the room. Just as he stepped forward, he was pulled back by Sherlock, whose eyes remained locked on the doorway. Looking up, he saw the figure enter.
Equally softly, John murmured back, “No. That's just the once.” Mycroft nodded and entered alongside John, pulling the door closed behind him.
“You're not going to ask why?”
Mycroft nodded, but before he could move, Sherlock spoke. “Stop.”
“We’ve been attacked by a dozen vampires in the last week, we’re about to go to what will probably be our deaths, and that’s what you’re concerned about?” John said in between deep breaths of air.
John glanced to the blood that still crept down the wall by the door, and could hear the words 'you see but you do not observe' echoing through his head as the implications of this ran through his mind. “Oh, for Christ's sake,” he said, throwing the silver off Mycroft's wrists and running out the door. After a second's wait, Mycroft followed suit, picking up his jacket and phone as he went.
“You can break his control of you, you just need to think a little,” John said, getting low so that if his opponent tried another run at him, he wouldn’t be able to knock him over.
“They're fictional,” Mycroft replied, in what John imagined was probably the most strained, 'pointing out the obvious' tone of voice the Holmes had ever had to use.
“Lieutenant?” John insisted, firmer this time.
John glanced over the papers, frowning as he turned the page, and wishing the robberies had been challenging enough to afford him another week of peace. Sherlock continued to throw darts.
“Sebastian,” John said. “Long time no see.”
“No more than usual,” John muttered.
John’s brief moment of hope ended, and he considered this.
Everyone waited, and John felt the air around them change, becoming harder to see through, as a light fog curled ahead of them.
“Half vampire.”
“Why?” He whispered once more.
“What are you doing?” John asked, horrified. He understood the wisdom in never meeting your heroes, but this was a betrayal he couldn’t have expected.
The car stopped at an intersection and the pale red light illuminated John's face while he spoke. “These deaths are the sign of a greater problem; the tip of the iceberg. Vampires don't just kill humans for the hell of it anymore,  that's not strictly how they operate these days. They either turn them, or drink from them and leave them alive. It's a survival tactic. You attract less attention to yourself if you aren't murdering your source of food each night.” He looked pointedly at Mycroft.
“With my bare hands,” John said. “Yes, I’m sure. Did any of you actually speak to Jane in person? Did she just leave a message? You’ve assembled
“That was you?” John asked, surprised. It wasn’t often that a vampire as old as George would share his own blood to turn a human. It hadn’t occurred in the last few centuries, in any case.
“I never said you didn’t,” John said, rubbing at his eyes. “Though, yeah, it’s a bit of a surprise.”
Molly touched the blood on her lab coat and rubbed it between her fingers. “What should we do about this?” She asked, looking down at the body.
,” Sherlock said.
“I think that’s it for me today. Night,” John said, nodding at Sherlock and pulling off his shirt, dawdling over to his bed. Sherlock looked away, uncharacteristically embarrassed, as John worked at his trousers.
“Was that English?” Sherlock asked, a hint of mocking in his voice.
“What, wouldn't you like him to be?”
“You were my second,” John murmured. “I trusted you.”
While stolen blood issued from his mouth, the vampire chuckled and moved his jaw forward again with a sickening snap.“Welcome back, Captain.”
“That's it?” Sherlock asked. John closed his eyes and focused.
On the other side of the room, Lestrade chuckled and put his own gun into its holster. “I’ve been trying to avoid thinking about it. So far I’ve managed to get them to lay off me by telling them I’m following a lead, and doing it on my own dime.”
Greg stared absently at the upholstery of his seat until he saw Mycroft shift around. Their eyes met and Greg offered a smile and a nod. Mycroft, whose eyes were focused on Greg but didn’t really seem to be
“No, definitely not,” John said, shaking his head. “Jane and I were texting regularly up until I saw her in person. She stopped responding immediately after we left; something was wrong. I didn’t have time to look into it, because why the hell would England be under attack after all this time? I’m an idiot, a bloody idiot,” he muttered bitterly, pulling the map towards himself.
“Yes, I know you are,” Sherlock said pointedly, narrowing his eyes as he stared at his companion. “You could start now.”
“So, you’re telling me that this door might channel a blast of memory right into my head? Are we sure we have to touch it?” Greg asked. The group was very nearly at the entrance to the vaults, and as Greg had been entrusted with the crowbar, he was most concerned about the process of getting into the vaults themselves.
“I mean…” John wasn’t entirely sure what he had meant. “Poor choice of words, never mind.”
“One more miracle,” he murmured.
This comment landed in the room like an iron weight.
“We don't have long. Did you bring your silver chains?” Sherlock asked.
“Of course I don’t blame you,” John said. “You had enough on your plate.”
Slipping through the door to the central command building, John started running. He had been reticent to do so outside, for fear of attracting attention to himself, but here all bets were off. “Sebastian!” he yelled, rounding the corner towards the stairwell. At the top, he glanced out the window, and got a better handle on what was happening below. By now, most of his soldiers were on the ground and fighting, but with a flash of unease John noted that the munitions building was surrounded heavily by enemy vampires. John was well aware that the building was not marked, nor was it named on maps - someone on the base would have had to point out where it was.
Sherlock glanced over at him. “In a better mood?”
“I do this professionally, you know,” Greg replied with a hint of defensiveness. “You’ve lost the dark circles under your eyes. Seems like we’re all getting our bearings again.”
“Not quite yet, no,” John said. “Sorry about this, Greg. It was really just supposed to be me and Mycroft here tonight.”
Thomas's eyes slowly returned to John after lingering on Mycroft for a few moments.“Well, I say
“This is you then, all of the deaths. You're turning humans.”
“No, Grant,” Sherlock said, clearly in high spirits - he tended to misname Greg when he was in a good mood. “Older, certainly, but also more accurate. Do you see the lefthand corner, where the vaults begin to curve upwards?”
“Oh, and order in some Italian tonight!” He called as he walked out the door, giving a final wave as he went.
“You don’t have an army yet, because you think you’re aiming for quality, creating these vampires, rather than quantity.” He couldn’t help laughing.
“A single point?”
“Great,” John said, rubbing his eyes. “Fine. We should get everything together, then, before everyone shows up.”
“John,” Sherlock said, then again more firmly, “John!” He was beginning to feel frustrated, not for the first time, with his best friend’s inability to listen to him.
John looked around at his companions. “We should probably get going. Not to safe to stay in one place too long.” He turned back to Jane as he stood. “Especially if we're being followed.” He moved forward and offered Jane his outstretched hand.“Williams.”
Sherlock, with a gloved hand, pulled out a small piece of paper. On it, in neat, red script, was the number fourteen.
“What about it?” Sherlock asked.
“When you went to the kitchen, before we came here. There was a reason for that.”He pursed his lips; it was foolish of him to underestimate the doctor.
With Moriarty being backed into a corner by Mycroft, John was able to turn his attention to the back shadows of the cavern, towards the Old Ones he had seen earlier. He had expected more trouble from them, but evidently they couldn’t be bothered - upon noticing John watching them, they slipped out with the subtlety with which they came in.
“One of the doors of the body cabinet in the morgue was open when I came back,” she said quietly. The realization hit Sherlock before it did John.
“My eyes are not what they once were,” George said, apologetic. “Particularly during daylight hours. These old bones are not used to being above ground at such a time.”
John finished off the glass and sat back, tapping the fingers of his right hand on the armrest of the chair as he watched Mycroft. After a moment, he stood.
“Our species are incompatible - you made us work with them. Work for them." Sebastian said angrily, lowering his rifle as he marched forward to John. “How could hunters trust someone whose mother is a vampire? Who is a vampire?”
“As I was saying,” George replied, smoothly turning his cold gaze towards Sherlock. “When one controls the government, they control the police. And in order to control the government, one must control Mycroft Holmes.”
There was silence for a while. “I guess so. Sorry, Molly.” Lestrade hoped that covered all of the "sorrys" he hadn’t said – ‘sorry you’re caught up in this. Sorry I didn’t ask you out at that Christmas party. Sorry you’re being chased by vampires with me.’
“Quite right,” Sherlock confirmed. “I try to observe and add to my database, not assume I know everything.”
Sherlock glanced over the figures, who were now illuminated by candlelight, and rolled his eyes. “Of course.”
Mycroft bent down further, dragging his teeth against John's throat and deepening the cut, running a hand through John's hair until he had enough of a handful to pull it to the side. As unconnected thoughts flitted through John's mind, it occurred to him that the deep gashes found on the bodies of some of the victims must have been due to Mycroft not simply biting down and drawing blood, but by fiercely wounding them.
For the first time that night, John saw a familiar tall blond head across the crowd. Stalking across the yard single-mindedly, Sebastian had a rifle of his own slung across his back and appeared to be heading in the general direction of the treasury.
“At Baker Street? Isn’t the top floor blown to hell?” John asked.
Once Charles was assured that she had settled in to the room comfortably, he left her. His directions were simple, requesting that she stay in the library and remain on call for the rest of them. She did not attempt to protest this, knowing well enough that her strength lay in gathering information, not in killing vampires. The more she thought about it, the more she was grateful she had been given an easy way out, a chance to be helpful but not at risk.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Humour me,” John replied.
“Why haven't I heard of any of these 'hunters'? Surely someone would have noticed them as time wore on and the novel became more well-known.”
John finished loading up his coat and clicked his revolver into place, hidden well inside his jacket.
Sebastian didn’t reply. Instead, he surveyed John, both hands still on his rifle.
“I'm pretty sure you do assume you know everything most of the time,” John countered.
Moriarty frowned. “Good work takes time, Doctor Watson. Experimentation. Once we perfect what we’ve been working on… Well. Some turns work out better than others.” He smiled again, and as he did so, two sharp, white fangs appeared in his mouth. Sherlock instinctively tried to move back but was held in place by the vampire behind him.
there's a murder tonight, perhaps it would...” He stopped talking, and glanced at Sherlock, who was giving him a look that John recognized as disapproval. He didn't need to finish speaking to see how transparent his lie was, and immediately took a different approach. “It's just a theory.”
“You don’t know?” Sherlock replied, surprised.
Molly looked at the door to the refrigerator, which was still ajar, and sighed. “I guess. Are you stealing blood?”
“The key to these murders isn’t in Romania, Charles,” John said, growing firmer in his convictions. “I would know if it was.”
Sebastian spoke again. “Imagine it - vampires throughout the world, virtually unnoticeable because they walk in the sun. All under Harker’s control - sleeper agents. They’ll go about their lives as normal - blood drinking aside - until their master calls. And when he does… the war can begin.”
As John put together his weapons, he sized up their group’s chances. At best, it would be four against god-knows-how-many opponents, and that was assuming Mycroft was present in the vaults when they arrived. Their worst-case-scenario was forty vampires, but that was only a rough estimate. The numbers were not on their side. However, the quality of their fighters might balance things a bit: John himself was once one of the world’s most talented vampire hunters. He’d gotten slower over the years, to be sure, but he felt himself getting better with each passing hour.
“Make sure he knows it wasn't up to me,” Lestrade said quietly, looking on the window on his right. “No one knows how to handle this.”
“I don't know who mine is,” Mycroft said, looking back up at John.
“We’re running out of time,” Greg said as Sherlock glanced at his watch, adding, “less than an hour until sunset.”
“No,”Sherlock said, nodding despite his words. “But I'll try to understand.”
Reluctantly, the group said their goodbyes. The moment they hung up, packing swung into full gear.
“I am so very glad to have you with us.”
John paused. “Another murder?”
“Finishing what the Count started,” he replied simply, as though speaking to a child.
“Hasn’t been a total loss,” Sebastian drawled. “We can create vampires that are perfect soldiers - they obey, they kill, they’re disposal.”
“Most of my people are out of town,” George answered. “We’ll make do with what we have.”
Sherlock put them aside. “Unimportant. What did the notes say?”
“Tell me about it,” John said. “We should have gone with Lestrade. I wasn't expecting
“I think it might rain,” John said, holding out a palm and distancing himself from Sherlock.
“Just a break in,” Sebastian muttered as he pulled a bit on the string. He took a drag on the cigarette that was resting at the side of his mouth. “Nothing to worry about.”
Lestrade smiled and turned back, adding,“Have her call the Yard. They'll sort everything out.”
“Obviously I don't,” Sherlock replied, scowling at John. “Don't be ordinary. No – this is simply the basic shape of the weapon that we should be looking for. Consider that all of the murders have occurred after dark, and all of the victims have exhibited remarkable blood loss.”
“Geyerrownbed,” he muttered, not quite articulate yet.
“That's... good.”
A bit off-kilter, she replied, “I’m afraid I’m not certain - they closed down for repairs last fall, and their reopening keeps getting pushed ahead. New custodianship, I heard.”
“No,” Sherlock said, his eyes going dark as he snapped at Lestrade and stared him down. “Do not finish that sentence.”
“Well, I -” He looked to John for help. John found himself suddenly fascinated by the floor tiles. “New body and all, I didn't really have time to call...”
John glanced up the street, and noticed that the light was thinner and nearly behind one of the buildings. “Best to hurry now, I think.”
“Ever the soldier, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft said, the feigned politeness he had used up until that point disappearing. He set his untouched glass on the table beside him. “Are you positive this is a war you want to enter?”
“Aside from trying to make sure you don't try to rip my throat out again?” He asked, gesturing to his neck, which he held one of Mycroft's own handkerchiefs to. Lines of dried blood ran down from the wound to his jumper, a great portion of which had turned a deep scarlet.
“I've seen plenty of dead bodies,” she said firmly, straightening up instinctively. “Death doesn't bother me. It's the violence – the fact you want me to believe that I was just attacked by a
“I wouldn’t rather avoid guns today, Miss Hooper,” an impossibly old voice said from the darkness; it was soft, but could be heard as though the vampire were in front of them. “We are not a threat.”
John nodded back curtly, and soon heard the heavy wood door slam close.
“It's always different. Always unique to the person, I've found.” Sherlock waited for him to continue. “You're hard to describe. Kind of like 221B. Not the tea, or Mrs. Hudson's biscuits, or anything like that. But, the smell of something in the kitchen having exploded, smoke and chemicals, the creak of the stairs - the way all that feels, that's how you taste; does that make sense?”
Molly walked closer to the pale body, and found a shiver run down her spine. As someone who spent most of her time around corpses, and was never very frightened by them, she found herself surprised at her reaction.
Mycroft took the mobile back, and began typing almost immediately. He passed Greg the phone once more.
John slowly lowered his arm. “We’ve found it, we should check it out, shouldn’t we?”
“Of course,” Molly replied. “You’re sure you’re going after them tonight? You can’t postpone? I haven’t heard back from anyone else. We need more time.”
“Detective Inspector,” Sherlock said, “Where’s Sally now?”
“Ah, fuck it,” he heard John say, as the smaller man turned around and pushed him back into the room, pulling his friend down to his mouth with a hand around the back of the detective’s neck. Sherlock smiled into the kiss and shrugged his coat off, relishing the intimacy and urgency of John’s every movement.
“Jim,” Sebastian said firmly, running out of patience.
Eventually, he shook his head and looked up at Sherlock. “Thanks. That was… good. Did you Google that?”
“Hi guys,” Molly said, her voice cutting out a bit as the train passed under a canopy of electrical wires. “How are things going?”
“Greg,” Molly murmured. “These are headstones.” She ran her hand over the surface of the stone, removing some of the dust. The names etched in it were too faded to read in the low level of light.
“It’s best we start moving this along,” Sherlock said, firmly. I would say we take the door here,” he pointed at the entrance they had taken earlier that day, “and loop around to the hidden vault along this side path.” He pointed at one of two plausible entrances to the underground cavern.
Glancing at each group of people, he analyzed faces and posture, before settling on a group in the corner. “There.”
Sherlock washed out the inside of two of the hotel’s mugs with a bit of the hot coffee, and then poured out two cups of black coffee. Sherlock handed John his mug, then sat on the edge of his own bed. The pair sipped their coffee quietly for a few moments.
John agreed. “I’ll call some friends who might be able to come up here and help us. If we start early tomorrow, we’ll have enough hours of daylight to put a plan together if we find anything.”
“A barn in the middle of the city,” John said, bemused. “Was this even on the map?”
John shook his head, jittery, and nearly leapt out of his skin when the hotel phone, on the table, started ringing loudly. Greg and Sherlock stopped moving and watched him as he read the caller ID.
“Then?” Sherlock prodded, and John shrugged.
As he read through the list, Sherlock had done some quick mental math. “How are you only a captain? Years of service, number of soldiers in your command. It doesn’t add up.”
“Well,” Sherlock said, considering. “Can it?”
John felt as though the air in the room left him. His mind raced through possibilities, all the ways out of the situation. “I could kill him.” He tried to swallow and was met with the prickling sensation of tears in his eyes.
“Damn,” Sherlock replied sarcastically, before leading the pair across the street. He glanced up at the castle in the distance. “Any chance-?”
As he turned towards his own opponent, he was surprised to see he knew the creature before him from a fight in Chisinau years earlier. He pulled out his knife, and after some grappling with the vampire, was able to swing his blade directly through its throat, decapitating it. He was beginning to wonder why Greg hadn’t had any luck firing, when he saw that two vampires of the group had his arms, and were holding him in place, not killing him. This moment of surprise was enough to put him at a disadvantage, and in the moment his knife hand dropped, he felt the end of a rifle touch the back of his head.
He turned his head back to Mary’s tombstone, the marble glistening in the winter sun that bravely fought its way through the clouds passing overhead.
Sherlock felt his cheeks softly tint pink and hoped that the dim kitchen light would not reveal all too much of it. He had been so sure that his secret affection for his flatmate had been… well, secret. Yes, people commented on their special bond all the time and Sherlock had never actually contradicted anyone’s assumption about the nature of their relationship—the hopeful spark of people perceiving something more between him and John was way too delightful to stomp out. But his reputation of someone unable to connect with people emotionally had been enough of a protective shield for anyone to refrain from addressing matters personally. Had they all known before he had? Had he been so obvious?
John has experienced this once before, this sensation of having his light spectrum widened, broadened. He had seen everything monochrome until he met—
It's mostly a fluff show :) Enjoy!
They parted and looked at each other, faces tinted red and gold. Sherlock let out an incredulous sigh of deliverance and John’s tasty, tasty lips turned up into a smile that beamed even brighter than a million candles ever could.
“Did the memories trigger you last night, too?”
“I understand,” Mr. Beaumont said, his voice a little colder than before.
“No, I mean, a real family. Not a makeshift arrangement with your sociopathic flatmate. This was never meant to be permanent, I get that now. And that’s okay.” Sherlock’s lips turned into a disillusioned smile. “Why would you settle for that?”
And Sherlock came undone in his mouth and under his fingers.
This chapter's song:
At long last, he says, “So, what can I do for you? You said you needed to see me?”
“Don’t you dare.”
“I can’t just rush off when there’s a child in the house.” He tries not to let the anguish this prospect causes him shine through his voice.
Greg arches his brows. “You don’t like beer, do you?” he asks flatly.
“How do you plan on keeping an eye on me if they’re both closed?” chuntered Sherlock but rolled to the other side of the bed to give John some space.
The thought lights a candle inside him, moths and other creatures of the night fluttering towards it and filling Sherlock’s stomach with a giddy, disbelieving trembling.
“I don’t know,” John admits after a beat. “But—”
John reached for Sherlock’s hand, pulling him close and melting a little at the sight of the elated expression his gesture evoked. With a coy arm finding its way around his waist, John captured Sherlock’s lips in a quick but meaningful kiss before facing Mrs. Hudson again.
Sherlock sets them on the floor and shuts off the telly.
, he finally picked up the phone and read the text.
“Not for anyone but you.”
“Every night, as Mrs. Hudson so kindly reminds me on a regular basis,” Sherlock confessed with forced nonchalance and added in a high voice, parodying his landlady: “’You can’t wake me up like this, Sherlock. I need my sleep. I’ll have to wear my noise cancelling headphones every night now.’” He rolled his eyes as John looked at him in obvious dismay.
“You do? I wouldn’t have taken you for someone who’s fond of pet names.”
John pointedly looked at the gun—“isn’t an option. You can still set things right. You stole a few things but we retrieved the ring and if you give back the other—”
” that lets her ride on his shoulders and teaches her about bees and stars and disembowelment (if John doesn’t watch him very carefully).
John gave him a pitying smile and set down his bags on the kitchen table. “I thought she was finally out of that phase?”
“Yes. Yes, right.” Sherlock emerges from his thoughts and pulls a few handwritten documents from the folder. “I’ve consulted this book and, apparently, my job is to simultaneously praise and make fun of John to entertain the guests. So, I made an index of his admirable qualities to include in the speech as well as a few thoughts on possibly funny anecdotes although I’m admittedly struggling with this part.”
But if it’s one thing he’s trying to achieve at this point it’s slowing his brain down for once.
“Yes?”
He won’t.
Through the daze of his dizzy brain, Sherlock sees John’s face shining down at him. “What now?” he asks, still slightly out of breath.
Sherlock knew—or at least strongly suspected—how unhappy John had been in the few months he had been married, not only because his wife had turned out to be an ex-assassin and shot his best friend. In John’s eyes, carefully covered with layers upon layers of self-preservation, swam something else, something like regret and longing and shame. Sherlock could catch a glimpse of it some nights, when John had numbed his sorrows with one too many glasses of whiskey. This look, this strange look he gave him, had grown so familiar over the years, its intensity waxing and waning. Lately, it had become so powerful that Sherlock was sure it would break through the surface at any moment. Or maybe he was just wishing for it, actively looking for the mirrored image of his own distraught face in those dark-blue eyes.
The weeks leading up to Christmas in 221B Baker Street entail some emotional revelations.
Hello everyone :)
The egg-timer shrills and Sherlock startles so violently he almost drops from the chair.
Molly sat down diagonally from him and reached out over the table to brush over his forearm in an attempt to lower it.
Quickly, Greg shifts the folder full of Sherlock’s notes to his left and hurries over to him, grabbing his shoulder. “Here, let me,” he says as Sherlock steadies a little, and offers him his arm for support.
He’s still not quite sure how to behave. This is not territory he feels safe on, at all. And yet, he doesn’t want Sherlock to struggle through this by himself. But what can he really do other than comfort him? Talk to John? They aren’t that kind of mates. Whenever they meet, they mostly talk about sports or how impossibly Sherlock behaved at the latest crime scene. Asking him if he has feelings for Sherlock would be awkward at best. Chances are John would just laugh it off or stop talking to him altogether. He isn’t the kind of chap who talks about anything profound.
“I’ve put her to bed like four hours ago,” John chuckled. “You basically were out for the whole day. Thinking ‘bout something particular?”
—he hated it. Between solving cases with Sherlock, taking care of Rosie, and working here he had barely time to eat or shower, let alone sleep for a decent amount of time. He sighed in exhaustion as he opened the last of the patients’ files he had to update and rubbed his tired eyes. When John finally locked the door to the clinic behind him, it was almost 11 pm. He sent a quick text to Sherlock:
He still couldn’t believe it. After all these years of silent, shameful pining, of suppressed emotions, lies, and self-restraint, they had finally allowed themselves to fall. And all it had taken were two months of living together again—and one ginormous fight.
Sherlock looked incredibly grateful. “Thank you.”
(I wanted to include one of their songs in this fic but had a hard time choosing. This one, however, evoked a complete scenario in my head. I hope you get the same feeling)
Sherlock wrapped himself tightly around John. “I love you,” he snivelled.
Cal hadn’t hurt Jason after all. He had just tried to protect his sister and manoeuvred himself into the shallows. He was only a kid in a hopeless situation. As soon as he’d hear that Laney was safe, he would not resist his arrest. Sherlock and John would make sure that Lestrade and his officers would do everything in their power to spare him a conviction. They would testify on his behalf if necessary. Everything would be alright, Sherlock was convinced.
Sherlock’s eyes were clenched shut as John moved in him—at least until John’s finger brushed over Sherlock’s prostate and they flew open again, his whole body arching and spasming at the new sensation. All but screaming, Sherlock clawed at John’s back: “Oh God, oh God, John!”
Sherlock loves him and John has fucked it all up.
When he returns with the order, a thought occurs to him. “Why don’t you write about the stag night? That was embarrassing enough; drunken shenanigans, you honking all over a potential crime scene, and getting arrested—checks all the boxes.”
“Yes, it is,” Greg sighed. “We’re talking about Chief Superintendent Beaumont’s son here. That’s why this case is so high-profile and I need your help to solve it as quickly as possible. His mother discovered the body behind their shed. He had apparently suffered a heart attack some time last night between 10 pm and midnight.”
But they can’t keep on living in denial about the lack of space for a rapidly growing child. They have to find a new place, to move on. They can make that work. They always have.
John’s voice darkened as he fixated Sherlock through his lashes: “Let me prove it then.”
Greg stomps up the stairs. This could’ve meant a promotion or at least a commendation. And now he’s got nothing to show for his efforts. He’d be reproaching Sherlock for it, loudly, if there was any point in it. But even if Sherlock knew what his little stunt has cost Greg today, he probably wouldn’t even apologize for it, so what’s the use in screaming.
I was so nervous to write this chapter and I'm still not quite sure if I met my own expectations. As a cishet girl, writing a coming-out, especially of someone who has suppressed their feelings for so long, is not an easy task. I really hope I lived up to it. Please let me know if anything bothers you or if my approach feels inappropriate!
“Something wrong?” he asked, quickly scanning John who was standing in the kitchen, hands on his hips, brows furrowed. That he was upset was clearly visible for Sherlock but the source seemed unclear to the genius detective.
“We could take Rosie, if you want to get rid of her,” Molly suggested in the rather awkward silence, setting down the champagne bottle and scrunching her face at her less than ideal choice of words. Her eyes flickered to Greg whose smile deepened even more. “I mean, if you want a night alone. I’ve barely spent time with her since you moved back in together. I’m beginning to feel like a horrible godmother. And you obviously need—”
Lestrade let out a sigh, hands running through his salt-and-pepper hair. With his foot he pushed the second chair in Sherlock’s direction, metal legs scratching over the floor. At the sight, Sherlock’s restless feet refused to carry him any longer and he collapsed onto the cold seat.
John lifted Rosie up on his arm and gestured to the grave on the left. “Say hello to your grandma, bumblebee. I’m so sorry you never met her. She would’ve loved you so much.”
Sherlock parked their rental car in front of the hospital in the next bigger town. As they got out, they were met by a petite woman about five years younger than Sherlock with a freckled face and sleek dark brown hair pulled back in a ponytail.
Acutely aware of Sherlock’s growing erection against his back, John turned in his embrace and grabbed a tea towel to dry his hands. Having Sherlock’s half-hard cock now pressed against his lower belly wasn’t exactly an improvement when it came to his self-control. On the other hand, John reminded himself, there was no need for controlling himself any longer. He was allowed to want Sherlock like this now. The dishes might as well soak for a couple of hours.
The realization hit John like a cannonball. The note. That bloody note.
“What’d you think would happen if you send me messages like these?!” he snaps at Sherlock, in the quiet of his mind scolding himself for having reacted so dramatically.
“Well, we’ve met years ago but things were… complicated. I always thought he wasn’t interested in anything romantic at all, especially not with a man, but—”
Whenever Sherlock had been sick as a grown-up, he had been completely alone. Whenever his transport fell ill and he was confined to his rooms, alone with his thoughts, nothing to console him; those were the only occasions Sherlock craved company. He always wished for someone to take care of him and guide him through the disposition, to sit by his bedside and coddle him as his mother used to when he was only a child with too much going on under his dark curls. Sherlock then usually cursed his mind for being too weak to fight off this sentimentality and fruitless wishes because, of course, no one ever showed up to look after him. Until a certain ex-army doctor limped into his life.
Sherlock stared at him with eyes wide in shock. “The clinic, oh God, I completely forgot about the clinic. Your vacation ended. Why didn’t you go to work?!”
: not to damage your butthole forever.”
The thought makes John’s chest clench with unbearable affection but still something less pleasant tinges the feeling.
This isn’t going as planned, at all. Greg sighs internally as Sherlock gets up, leaving his documents scattered all over the table. He ploughs through the crowd, not even stopping to pay their check. Hastily, Greg picks up their stuff and fumbles a few crumpled-up pounds out of his wallet. That was supposed to be his cab money, but whatever.
The last plates have just been cleared when Sherlock rises and clears his throat. Greg braces himself, clasping his beer glass tightly.
The metallic 221B shone golden against the door’s dark painted wood, an almost blindingly bright offer of salvation. A sense of homeliness and hope tingled in John’s chest at the sight. He lifted the squirming Rosie from her pushchair with some difficulty and mounted the few steps. Unconsciously, John raised his free hand and let his fingers trace the knocker, its worn out surface pleasantly cool and familiar beneath his burning skin. His heart pumped too fast. He fumbled with his keys for some tedious moments before he finally unlocked the door.
The tree they chose barely fit in the corner of the sitting room. It took the combined strength of both John and one of Sherlock’s homeless acquaintances to get it up the stairs, while the detective himself strolled idly behind, carrying the shopping bags and commenting on their suboptimal towing technique.
John’s anger is infectious; Sherlock feels it seething in his bloodstream. “What would you have done in my position? Wouldn’t you have tried to keep me out of the line of fire? Wouldn’t you have done whatever it took to protect me? Even if it meant never telling me?”
“Okay,” John echoed, running a hand through his hair to regain his composure. “I’ll better go then.”
Sherlock draws the curtains shut, something heavy and irritating twisting his stomach. Against his will, he feels a little abandoned, after all.
Mycroft had warned him, had tried to protect him from this, even if Sherlock hated to admit it.
“John, what—,” was all he managed to get out as he stepped into the room like a moth being drawn in by the flame.
“If she says
“Great, you?”
Sherlock left the room while Katie still recorded Ms. Brower’s statement. John followed him, thinking he might be sick if he stayed another second. In the coldly lit hallway, Sherlock leaned against the wall and covered his worn-out face with slim elegant fingers. John couldn’t quite hide his surprise to see his friend this agitated. Usually, a solved puzzle put Sherlock over the moon. Often enough, they had raised looks of reproach and anger when Sherlock had displayed his self-satisfaction a little too openly.
John comes closer, one hand wrapping around Sherlock’s wrist. The touch, tender yet determined, is rippling through his body like a tidal wave. John reaches up to his face and the glistening of something catches Sherlock’s attention, something golden reflecting the light from the streetlamp outside.
The figure has apparently spotted him, too, and rises. The streetlight’s gleam draws the outline of a man onto the pavement. In the semi-darkness, his features are still hidden from view but Sherlock doesn’t need to see his face anyway.
Leaving now, home in 15
“We’ve got people coming over and there’s not a single eatable thing in the flat.” John groaned. “I need to go out and do some shopping.”
Now that Mary is out of the room, John allows another of his worries to enter, one he has carefully factored out so far:
“When we found out, it was already too late. The cancer had spread, there were metastases everywhere. It only took three months—no chemo, no radiation therapy. She didn’t want any of that, wanted to go out on her own terms, without having to suffer through all of that. We had time to say goodbye at least. And after she was gone, everything just fell apart. Dad couldn’t handle the grief, started drinking. He and Harry bickered constantly. She was never a particularly easy child and, as a teenager, it only got worse. He hit her. Quite often. Two years later, when she came out to us, he just kicked her out. Told her to pack her things and leave—or else.” John swallowed heavily under Sherlock’s horrified gaze. He was incredibly thankful that they sat somewhat separated from the rest of the restaurant.
He loves you, mate. Don’t be an idiot.
“He won’t be there anyway if he’s not a total idiot,” Sherlock murmured, not trying to disguise how miffed he was by Lestrade’s general reaction. He was trying to help after all.
“I didn’t find anything about this on record, Sir,” Greg said, stepping closer to the sofa. The carefully supressed irritation in his voice made the air around them cool a few degrees.
“That’s enough, Sherlock,” John said, his voice calm but stale. He lifted their shopping bags off the counter and made for the door without so much as looking at the cashier or any of the other customers. For a second, Sherlock stood there completely motionless, his eyes following John out of the store. The sight of his back, upright and sturdy as always, extinguished Sherlock’s anger as if John had emptied a bucket of ice water over his head, leaving nothing but wet, charred doubt.
Sherlock gravely shakes his head. “I honestly don’t think your relationship with Mr Chatterjee would survive any delay of your romantic getaway. Even taken this weekend at a lovely, little bed and breakfast into account, chances are you will break up within the next two months.”
Something about this slip feels odd, causes a surge of adrenaline John can’t quite place but he knows better than to dismiss his natural instincts.
“Then why did we only drink beer on my stag night?”
“John has said it first,” Sherlock interjects, somehow sounding defiant, eager, and hurt all at once. “When he asked me to be his best man. He said—he said he wanted the two people around he loves most in this world, Mary and… me.”
When they returned to one of the busier streets, with wobbly legs and mischievous grins, midnight had already passed. Fingers intertwined, they threaded through the few people crossing their path when John’s phone buzzed in his jacket. He fished it out of his pocket with his free hand, determined to not let go of Sherlock. The cold light of the screen painted his face with deeper ridges and sharper edges.
“I love you too, Sherlock.” John rested his forehead on Sherlock’s, for a second overwhelmed by the sensation of that tight ring of muscles around his finger. His rapidly re-hardening cock gave a twitch at the thought of taking its place and John exhaled forcedly, trying to keep control, concentrate. Hesitantly, he moved his finger, twisting and bending and carefully looking out for any signs of distress from Sherlock.
The adrenalin pumping through John’s veins splayed the all too familiar steely coating over his muscles, readying every fibre for imminent combat. Time slowed down around him. Between two heartbeats, he could see the boy slip from his grasp, running through his fingers like fog he had tried to catch. He needed to act.
Now John, his shoulders weighed down by sympathy, chimed in: “You were supposed to be with Cal instead, Laney, weren’t you? Was he supposed to look after you? He’ll be worried sick if you’re gone, won’t he?”
“Yeah, well, hey,” Greg said, running one hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, visibly embarrassed by his lack of clothes. “Everything okay?” The question was directed at Molly.
It’s a shock, to say the least. They haven’t planned for it, have not even been lax when it comes to contraceptives.
Sherlock’s wet eyes take a little longer than usual to fix on Greg’s.
on a regular basis. You shouldn’t change the whole way you two communicate just because it’s his wedding. That’s just confusing.”
“Tomorrow’s your birthday!”
“Sherlock—,” she began once more as he bent down to seize another plate.
Greg’s lungs burn almost as badly as his worry. Like wildfire, his thoughts are spreading in every possible direction, devouring everything in their way. “What?”
, John was touching him in a way he had always longed for and Sherlock couldn’t help but thrust into his fist, letting his heart rule his head at last. His brain couldn’t have come up with something so spectacularly good in a million years; What use was his genius intellect in a situation like this? This was just like music, like dancing. He needed to let his body take control, to follow the rhythm of John’s panting, the melody of his kisses. He needed to let go.
As they said goodbye, John and Harry shared a tight hug that seemed to mend some of the broken bonds between them. His heart still light from the acceptance and reassurance his sister had offered, John made his way through the darkening city. Rosie had become increasingly grouchy since she had woken up from her nap and now fidgeted in her pushchair. It was about time that he brought her home, John thought.
But obviously, John had underestimated the obsessive amount of thought and energy Sherlock would put into this endeavour. His fault, actually. When was the last time Sherlock had done anything half-heartedly?
“When I left last night, some memories came up that I had successfully suppressed for the better part of the last twenty years. And they delivered convincing evidence…”
“Yes, you are.” John grinned and pulled Sherlock into another kiss. “The cutest thing I’ve ever seen.” Any further objections were successfully silenced until Mrs. Hudson returned.
“Just a second, Rutherford,” he stopped him. “How and where exactly did you find Laney?”
“You don’t have to happen anything around, do you? Lube, Condoms?”
“Well, he kinda had. But for a good cause,” John demurred.
John gives him a strange look and then another of his little nods before he lowers his eyes into his teacup.
“Are you sure?” John asked in barely more than a whisper, dropping his gaze to Sherlock’s mouth for a second.
And although Sherlock deeply and truly believed in the power of logic and science and anything that rendered superstitions completely moronic, he couldn’t help but close his eyes and pray as he blew out the candles:
.” He would recognize that voice everywhere, having heard it even for the two years its owner had been presumed dead.
“I’ll just quickly use the loo if you don’t mind.”
(I stole this one from Jane the Virgin... along with the general aesthetic ;) )
“Nothing happened,” he interrupted him. “I’m happy, healthy, and alive.”
Sherlock took another deep breath and closed the distance between them, uncontainable relief and longing flooding his system. “— absolutely amazing.”
Without another word, Mycroft pulled him closer and Sherlock sobbed into his expensive three-piece suit.
