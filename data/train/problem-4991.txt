By the time she arrived at his side of the circle, however, Dean looked like a deer in the headlights. He just blinked at her hand for a second, then said, “uh… no. That’s okay.” He glanced down at the girl sleeping on top of him, then looked wildly around. “Cas will get it.”
Confession: the blank page with just those words has been sitting on my desk for nearly a month now. I wrote them the morning after I sent off my last letter, having formulated a plan to write in pieces this time. Rather than sitting down at the start of November and trying to recreate all the stories and details at once, I had envisioned this letter as a sort of diary of stories, anecdotes relayed in real time, aimed to make you smile, to laugh, to at least be touched in some way. This was my plan.
“Actually,” Dean chimed in, “I sorta invited Cas to come back to Lawrence with me for a couple days. That alright?”
Dean hummed, apparently intrigued. “That’s an interesting idea.”
There was a long, dark moment before Mary spoke. “I see. And then you lied about it to all of us.” She was quiet, but her fury was palpable, even in whisper. “May I ask what exactly made you think you couldn’t, at least, tell your mother the truth? Have I been so aggressive in my hopes that you will find a mate in life that I have made you ashamed to be honest with me? Or, perhaps, afraid of me?”
“Ah.”
And perhaps that is where the problem arises. I am sure Mrs. Novak tried very hard with me as she suddenly took on the burden of home, farm, and family on her own. But the reality of my life has been to live in one home for twenty-odd-years and still remain utterly orphaned. Some younger ones stayed for years, but they were more my charges than my siblings. I gave them, as best I could, what I was without, because in my humble and supremely uncultured opinion, no child should grow to adulthood seeing affection as a luxury. From everything I’ve read and seen outside of Angel Farm, children are meant to be given love constantly and with abandon. They are meant to be positively drowned in it, and I am certain the sheer lack within my experience has played a major role in my less-than-rosy view of Mrs. Novak. Despite my reluctance to leave Alfie and Anna behind, I was still desperate to leave, and the departure has felt like a strange emergence into a life, rather than the next story in a life partially lived. I seem to have escaped a timeless, grey place, and I am determined, now, to see my subdued childhood experiences as unique rather than cruel. I wish not to dwell on it, but to observe its peculiarities in relation to the rest of the world. To learn from it, write it, share it. Perhaps I am not a victim so much as a prophet. Or perhaps I am simply a survivor. Either way, I intend to offer affection to the world wherever I can, in my “intense” and quiet way, even if I can only do so through my words.
“Makes sense.”
But now, if Dean wanted to move somewhere new without offending his father’s pride, he would need to come in to the conversation with a clear plan. John had always been something of a strategic thinker, a quiet presence with a mind constantly planning and adjusting. And he could get so wrapped around an idea sometimes that the merest question of the plan could feel like a personal attack. But if Dean could get in with a clear, rational idea of what was next before John got his heart set on his own set of outcomes, perhaps they could both emerge without hurt feelings or broken promises.
“Honestly? I was kind of looking forward to having stuff to do all morning. Something to focus on other than, you know…” Sam trailed off.
Archangel, have you ever learned one tiny bit of information and immediately needed to reevaluate your entire worldview in the light of your discovery? Okay, I’m exaggerating a bit— my entire worldview did not alter. But my understanding of the last few months was thrown into question with a toss away story.
So, in that regard, you should know that I am still having an excellent experience with the program. While a bout of the flu has been disrupting rapidity of my work over the last two days, I feel confident that I will be able to catch up quickly once I am recovered, and do not expect any true ramifications. The staff is helping me take care of my health, and I am doing what I can to prepare ideas through the fog of illness. I will update you further on the progress of my work in my December letter.
It started with Krissy and I. Krissy specializes in young adult fiction—I don’t know if I’ve told you that before—and she has been working on a piece of late that might benefit from some elements of a strong family dynamic among the leading characters. As in, an actual blood-tied family unit with all its highs and lows, rather than something found or built. She and I were both working in the lounge/living room, so I offered to help her at least talk through her frustration.
You’ll have to forgive my bluntness today. And I do mean that you will
“Cas…”
Cas blinked at him. “That doesn’t make any sense, Dean.”
“Good boy. I have trained you well.”
The afternoon slid into a breezy evening in bliss around him. Guests wandered the grounds of the property, some even venturing to the lake to snap pictures of the sunset. They cut the cake at dusk, lit from the trees and the mosquito lamps, and for the second time that day, Sam Winchester went off to remove white goop from his luxurious hair – this time in the form of buttercream frosting. Jess looked exceptionally pleased with herself.
Never in my life have I had a Christmas,
Castiel
This is a Christmas that loves.
Cas waited, but Dean’s words seemed to have cut off like a scratched record. “Dean?”
When I arrived a few hours ago, I immediately pulled Jo aside to discuss her course of study over the next week and a half. I think I told you that she’s considering a renewed attempt at undergrad – she came right to work for her mother after high school, but is now contemplating a change, and will need to undergo the usual testing. She is an incredibly bright young woman— I have a feeling my function to her will be more as a refresher of unused subjects than an actual teacher. We’ve set up some times, and discussed the various subjects we will cover, so we’ll dive into that tomorrow. Ellen has been so kind to invite me back, so I hope I can at least begin to repay her thoughtfulness by encouraging Jo in her academic aspirations. I’m glad I have something to offer in thanks— it makes my return feel less like an imposition.
To mark the completion of the program this month, Chuck is holding a ceremony here at the Estate— a graduation, of sorts, where our certificates will be distributed and a small reception will be held for friends and family.
Ellen mirrored Mary’s long-suffering eye roll and turned back to Castiel. “Cas, we put you up in the attic room for the weekend. Is that alright?”
“Yes, I know. But…” Cas stopped. He had a choice here. He could be dangerously honest, or he could be safe. Something told him this was a moment to be brave. To confess. “You remember that summer I brought Balthazar here with me for the week?”
“We don’t actually have to dance,” he told Dean, trying desperately to sound casual with the offer, even as his body lit up with conflicting desires. “I was just trying to find a way for us to escape.”
Dean’s eyes were huge as he apparently ran through the implicit possibilities. “I’m not sure whether to be scared or intrigued.”
“What?”
“Please do.”
Perhaps this shouldn’t matter. I still achieved something great here, and I was heartily praised for it. Dean even brought me flowers – jonquils, apparently – which was painfully sweet of him. But I barely had a chance to thank him, in the end, and even as I did he seemed a million miles away. Balthazar hauled in champagne for Meg and I, later in the evening, but I can’t imagine my gratitude for his kindness rang particularly true. It is jarring to feel entirely alone while surrounded by friends.
“That’s because it’s in my car, genius,” Dean rebutted, thoroughly enjoying himself. Addy had passed out in his lap, apparently so exhausted that Dean didn’t even need to keep his voice down as he bantered with the others.
“Yeah, good call.” An awkward silence descended on the room, charged with a healthy dose of uncertain anticipation. “What about you, Cas? Are you gonna kick my ass for keeping it from you all this time?”
And, oh, Cas was not prepared for the gut punch that would come with hearing Dean say Lisa’s name. Huh.
Dean chokes on his soda. “What, me? You want to bring me on your date??”
An answer didn’t occur to me until after I was settled back at The Garden, in the end. Not wanting to ruin the trip, I had put this tiny concern to the side of my mind during my time in East Jordan so I could relax and enjoy the casual atmosphere. But I pulled out the mental file when I got back to the Estate. I can’t really abide not understanding how I feel, if you haven’t noticed. I suppose I’m something of a chronic analyzer. But perhaps that comes with the trade.
“I know, I know. But it’s gonna take me longer than two days to forgive myself, you know? I neglected you guys for years, Cas.” He gave Castiel a long look before adding, “Especially you.”
you?”
As Cas relaxed into the familiar sounds and scents of evening at the lake house, he finally began to unwind. The day, on the whole, had gone fine. Fairly well, actually. It had been an excellent party, and outside of his own head, his interactions with Dean had been normal and straightforward. After building up scenarios of betrayal and disinterest for so long, it had been rather jarring to fall back into rhythm as though barely anything had changed. It had been even more jarring to Cas to realize how happy that made him. Whatever had happened in the last few years, they still had a bond, and Cas found that he didn’t want that jeopardized by anything.
“I know. Hell, that's what I want too, really, to be able to settle down and try my hand at being a real adult sometime soon.” His words had a rehearsed finality to them, like that might be all he had to say. But with a fortifying breath, he continued. “But I don't just want to be comfortable, or whatever, you know? Maybe it's naïve, but whoever I end up with...I'd like to be really happy, too.”
Rings were exchanged, as were kisses and words of love, and soon enough, Professor Moseley was pronouncing them married, releasing the wedding party to the house for photos, and the other guests toward the barn to begin the reception.
January 2018
Addy giggled again as the adults shook hands. “I’m not a monster!”
where hymns of classic rock soar to the rafters in harmony
I realize now how presumptuous that was, and how inherently foolish. Perhaps you have enjoyed my letters more than is usual, but maybe this is just your way. Perhaps in the nearly 15 years this scholarship has been awarded you have offered continued funding to a number of students, or even to all of them. I do not, I must remind myself, actually know you.
“Indeed,” Cas agreed. “And all the more impressive for the brief planning period, I’d say.”
I am grateful, truly, for your thoughtfulness, but please accept the return of this extravagant gift for what it is; a realist’s attempt at humility. You have given me far more than enough already, and I cannot stand to extort from you further.
As the final licks of the guitar slowed to their reverberating conclusion, Dean began to lean back, still holding firmly to Cas’s waist. He gazed into Cas’s eyes with an intensity bordering on desperation, and there was nothing to be done but gaze right back.
“Right in one. He called me in the morning, and I was about to tell him, but…god, he was so excited. I wasn’t about to fuck that up with my problems. You know how Sam is. He’d be ashamed to show his happiness ‘cause he’d think it was gonna make me sad or whatever. I wasn’t about to send him down that road.” He sounded utterly desperate to be understood, validated, and Cas could see how Dean would be hesitant to cause Sam shame. The kid gave guilt a whole new meaning when it came to his family.
Realizing that he won’t be able to open the storm door with his arms full of sugar containers, Castiel turns to the side and stacks the unwanted varieties on the tiny end table next to the door, where Gabriel’s keys and wallet usually live. Dean might be laughing at him silently, as he juggles baking ingredients in his brother’s doorway, but it’s impossible to tell through the mask. That’s a small mercy. Castiel chooses to tell himself the gorgeous man is merely grinning.
I’m finding it hard to believe that a month has passed since my last letter. It feels like barely a blink has elapsed between that first afternoon writing with the spectacular view of Lake Charlevoix in sight, summer breezes persisting despite the traditions of autumn’s arrival. And yet, I feel as if I have travelled far too many miles to have only seen one month go past. But here we are, October whisking our little band of creatives toward a lakeside winter bound in words, flakes, and blazing torrents of inspiration. That’s my prediction, anyway, given the month that has just transpired.
Cas doubted anyone else had noticed, but Dean’s demeanor seemed a bit off as the night wore on. It was nothing he said—his voice had been ringing with the others through the sing-alongs, and his commentary on Sam’s reminiscent musings was as humorous as ever, jovially ribbing with his elder-sibling-grin. But it didn’t quite sit right with Cas. The man was quiet tonight, at least more so than usual, and as the others shared stories with Laurie and with two of Jess’s girlfriends who had rolled up around dusk, Cas thought he caught an uncharacteristic sadness in Dean’s eyes. He seemed just as surprised by some of the tales being shared in the cool evening breeze as the newly arrived Trish and Sonya – anecdotes from Charlie’s recent LARPing escapades, from the Harvelle’s New Year’s trip to Colorado, from Sam and Jess’s encounters with clueless clients and problem patients. It was, Cas realized, new to Dean in a way that it was not to the others of their little clan.
Oddly, the next morning when Castiel comes down the stairs, he doesn’t sprint for the kitchen. He’s somehow calmer, as if the burning disappointment of realizing that Dean is apparently married to Lisa and a father to her child somehow alleviates Castiel’s own responsibility to be impressive should he be spotted through the window.
Castiel could have held that stare for centuries, lost in fields of emotion too thick to navigate. But just as Dean took in a shaky breath to speak, the next song started playing.
Ash, the bar back/handy man/occasional fill-in-fry cook is a bit of a mystery. For one thing, he doesn’t seem to have a last name. I’m fairly certain he sleeps in the bar most nights—usually on the pool table—but I can’t tell if this is by choice or necessity. He’s the sort of enigma of a human one imagines must have sprung unto existence exactly as he is today, mullet in full bloom, encyclopedic knowledge of computers, physics, and all manner of conspiracy theories fully formed without need for schooling. I’ve tried to picture it with all the skill of my writer’s mind, but I simply cannot imagine a childhood past that could come together to form such a man. He is a marvel, and I tip my hat to him for finding the corner of the world where he can flourish, conventions be damned.
Forever.
“No. I rent a very small ‘house’,” Cas corrected, smiling slightly as he acted out quotations with his hands.
The gaze held for the sort of moment that felt like an eternity. But, then, Dean looked away. “Oh.”
“Yeah.”
Ellen piped up, then, with a completely deadpan “You’re welcome.”
Caught, Cas just surrenders his last vestige of dignity with a grimace. “Certainly caught me off guard. Not that I have a problem with whatever romantic arrangements people might have with each other. But it’s not something one expects to see out in the open in broad daylight in suburbia.”
He crept in, suddenly praying that the car on the street out front belonged to a neighbor. With any luck, no one was home to see a stranger tiptoeing up to the front door in a trench coat holding a big manila envelope. He unlatched the screen as quietly as he could manage, just in case.
“Good night, Dean,” Cas replied, settling in contentedly to go back to sleep.
Cas nodded solemnly, highly amused by the gleam of worship in his friend’s eye. “The latest draft of the new book, yes. And,” he gave Sam a stern look and affected his best Chuck Novak impression. “’guard it with your life young man. Only the editor has seen that so far’.”
Eventually, he managed to croak out, “Hello, Dean.”
“So, what’s next for you,” Cas asked, hoping to refocus his friend on something more hopeful than lost love. “You said you’re going home to Lawrence for a bit?”
And the fact of the matter was that when Dean had walked away from the longest and most significant romantic relationship of his life, he hadn’t felt comfortable calling to confide in Cas. Rather, he had decided that there was no one with whom he could share his burden. It made Castiel wonder how he would have reacted if Dean had suddenly called for a shoulder to cry on. Would his resentment have made him respond with cruelty? Would he have even answered the phone? What kind of friend did that make him? No, this wasn’t all Dean’s fault. It was unfair to expect the man to know Cas was hurting without ever bothering to tell him.
As they open up their food containers to dig in, Ben turns to Dean. “Well, you two seem to be on good terms again,” he says, giving the man a knowing and vaguely probing look.
Jessica Moore did not, in fact, have the personality of a cardboard cutout. Far, far from it. About 5 minutes into her first Winchester Christmas party, Cas was already crossing his fingers that she and Sam would stay together for the long haul. For everyone’s sake. She was the most devious angel Cas had ever laid eyes on, vivacious and level-headed, a listener at heart but happy to banter with the best of them. She slid into place with the clan even faster than nine-year-old Cas had, and the vows this weekend felt like just a formality at this point. She had been one of them for years.
That made Castiel actually blush. Perhaps he had overstepped a bit here, too.
Maybe it won’t go anywhere. But Castiel is exceptionally happy he ran into Dean Winchester, after all. And for the first time in a very long time, he has a good feeling about something to come.
While the Millicent Greenwaldt Memorial Scholarship must come to an end upon your completion of The Garden’s program, Mr. Smith’s support does not, necessarily, need to cease in turn. He sees potential in your work, and should you wish to continue on after graduation in a similar manner, Mr. Smith would be interested in sponsoring your work further. Should you agree, he would be happy to offer a very generous stipend, which should allow you to live comfortably and without need for a secondary vocation as you begin your time as a professional writer. The monthly correspondence would no longer be required, though occasional contact would be appreciated so that Mr. Smith could continue to follow your work.
Never in my life have I had such a Christmas.
Heavens, Archangel, this letter is impressively lengthy already, isn’t it? Especially when one considers that I am not currently at school, and therefore have not been writing to you about classwork. But, then, I suppose this is to be expected when a writer is handed such a juicy tale. Perhaps it can’t be helped.
And then Dean said, “Fuck.”
The backyard of the Braedens’ house is huge. At least, it’s way bigger than Castiel had imagined it would be. Even the garage is enormous, weirdly tall and still wide enough for several cars. It has windows – what kind of garage has windows like that? Is it masquerading as a small house?
But this— returning to the Roadhouse, was something altogether new for me. There was no guarantee, when I left in January, that I would ever return. I knew I would like to, but my future was (and, truly, still is) too uncertain to know for sure. And while the Harvelle’s and their cohort had been wonderful to me throughout the holiday season, I couldn’t be positive that a return visit would be welcome even if I could manage it. I hoped, of course, but I could not be entirely certain their affection was genuinely as extensive as it felt when I left. When Ellen explicitly invited me to come back this summer, therefore, I was deeply honored. It put a warmth in my heart to be assured that I was wanted there, independent of usefulness. She and her family simply enjoyed my particular company, and they wished to experience it again.
, so I read your story in the winter issue last year, and… it was so good. I just wanted to make sure you could keep writing, whoever you were.”
Well, I’ve just been up all night experiencing one such impossible meeting of hearts, and I’ve never been happier to declare my previous world view incorrect.
Dean shook his head. “Nah. Bourbon.”
“Yes. For a time,” Cas replied dryly.
Well, I should sign off now. I promised Balthazar a long form letter of his own, since I opted not to visit him over break, and my hand is already beginning to cramp up. But at least the mild discomfort is distracting me from the fact that McSweeny’s is putting out my piece tomorrow. Fingers crossed for a good reception, Archangel!
On the one hand, there are probably explanations for all of this that make perfect sense. But, at least to Castiel, it all just feels…peculiar. True, he doesn’t have kids, and hasn’t been around people who do in a long time. But this whole exchange just doesn’t feel like a father and son. It feels like friends with mismatched ages, maybe. Or an older and younger brother. Cas’ confusion is back with a vengeance, and there’s no longer a Star War to distract him.
“Thanks, Jack. I hope wherever you are...or
They don’t discuss Castiel, though. Because that deal was permanent. And the hope is too addictive to ruin with talk of lost causes.
It felt like a sign. This phrase meant nothing! I must make it something! The spirit of a deceased motivational speaker had just possessed the body of my surliest professor to tell me so!
“I don’t need it, though, Cas, I— “
Cas startled only slightly when he heard movement in the bedroom behind him. Self-assessment time was over, then.
“I see.”
Castiel
Dean glanced at Cas again, clearly nervous. “Yeah, sure. What’s up?”
“...to settled down be.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean teased. “I’m pretty glad he snores, really. Means I get you all to myself tonight.”
Ah, I’m not sure I can write any more. My hands are shaking. And now Krissy is actually shaking me. I’ll leave you with this, Archangel:
The fact of it is, you are my benefactor, nothing more. And while your request that a writer write to you does, to be frank, invite a certain intimacy, I rather doubt this was your true intention. You wished to be certain your money was being put to thorough use, and perhaps to be diverted by the occasional pun in the process. It was foolish of me to expect anything more personal from a person who can have no interest in knowing the child behind the words.
It was going to be a long drive.
Ahoy Archangel,
“You and me,” Dean said, intensely looking at Cas through only his peripheral vision. “We were never, you know, ‘together’. We never kissed, we never dated. Hell, we never even admitted to each other that we might want that sort of romantic thing…”
As they reached the second-floor landing, Cas murmured, “I can’t decide if that makes you a great Best Man or a terrible son.”
But arriving on the shores of Lake Charlevoix I have found a whole new variety of reception. These are people who waltzed in with enough certainly of their skill that they apparently felt no need to fear each other. I had already passed the unspoken test simply by being invited, so any posturing was limited to the meet and greet, then thrown unceremoniously out in the lake. Awards and achievements will not make a bit of difference until the program has ended. It’s quite refreshing.
Kevin painted us a picture of the anxieties of a suburban adolescence, mired in the pressures of his race and his high-achieving family. Becky opened up about the bullying she had endured growing up, a shy and awkward tween with emotionally closed off parents. Bela enlightened us about some of the finer horrors and peculiarities of a British boarding school education, of a lavish life in the delicate world of diplomacy, of the fine but distinct line between parental approval and parental support. Garth told us about his transgender brother, currently in the midst of hormone therapy, and some of the trials their family has encountered as “one of the Fitzgerald girls” came to find himself. And Meg…well. It turns out she didn’t kill her parents, as we somewhat jokingly suspected. But I might not have blamed her if she had done.
Those are the main points of interest for the moment. But there is one final thing I would like to say to you, Archangel.
“At commencement,” Castiel clarified. “You brought me flowers, even though…You didn’t say anything.”
That, at least, finally got Dean to blink. “Uh, yeah,” he said, turning slightly toward the room to his right. “Why don’t you have a seat?” He indicated a seating area arranged around a brick fireplace, clearly making his own attempt at human behavior, but sounding a bit like a panicked robot. “Would you like something to drink?”
“Yeah,” he said easily, kissing Cas quickly with a playful smirk. “Very sure.”
It’s a near thing, but he manages to stifle the baffled, “why on Earth do you ask” that wants to tack itself on to the end of his answer. Not to mention the incredulous, “and what is the deal with your confusing love life” that’s been bubbling up for the last three minutes or so.
Dean glances at his watch. “Sure. You’ve got an hour before bed, though, so that’s all you get.”
“I’ve got beer here, too, if you’d rather,” Dean adds.
Warmed as always to be considered an honorary Winchester, Cas tenderly replied, “She’s pretty great, Aunt Mary. I like her quite a lot.”
I know, it’s all very Disney’s Cinderella, isn’t it? (Minus the evil step-sisters – my foster siblings are perfectly lovely). But thanks to you, the melodrama ends there. I shall make the journey Up North next month for three semesters of writing and nature and freedom, and Naomi Novak no longer has to endure the burden of my presence. No one loses here.
The mental whiteout was back, but this time was different. Maybe, just maybe, he understood. And just the possibility was filling him up with little tendrils of panic and loss. Slowly, he composed himself enough to clarify. “Told me what, Dean?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, staring into the dark with intent. “I spent the whole rest of the summer drawing it- I had just learned how to sort of draw people at camp the month before, and I really wanted to capture that day. I wasn’t very good, but I tried. Filled about half a sketchbook trying to get it all right- the proportions, the curl of the waves, the sail in the wind…you.”
“Ugh,” Cas ejected, pleasure in this plan evaporating immediately. “There had better be coffee.”
“Oh, okay,” Mary replied, rolling her eyes. “And where are you planning to sleep then, Dean? In your car?”
Cas couldn’t stand it – he had to intervene. “Mary, it was my idea.” Three sets of eyes turned on him. Well, he was in it now, so he let himself ramble toward a solution. “It’s not Dean’s fault. We just—he told me first, because he was worried about how everyone else would handle the news. And, frankly we were both concerned that this would dampen Sam’s excitement. You remember how he was when Cassie left? Or when Dean ended things with Benny? Hell, even when I split with Balthazar- he was devastated. This is supposed to be the best day of his life, and we didn’t want him so distraught for his brother that he couldn’t enjoy his own wedding. It seemed better to keep Dean’s news under wraps through the weekend, and ask forgiveness later. But we really didn’t want to lie to any of you. I’m really sorry, and so is Dean, so please don’t be angry with him. His heart was in the right place.”
“Glad to know I passed that test, then,” Castiel replies, positively giddy at this point.
“Came back for his funeral,” he offers with a dark chuckle. “Ran into Lisa at the Roadhouse that night, a couple drinks in. She talked me out of bolting again, starting over in yet another town someplace. Offered to let me stay here.” He gestures at the garage.
“Yeah,” Cas said, stars in his eyes of a familiar sunny green. “See you at home, Dean.” And though he rarely called Kansas his home anymore, for once the term had the ring of pure authenticity.
“On that matter from my last letter,” he pressed on, undeterred by the mild warning of Dean’s interjection. “My dear friend who wants to take me out on a very sweet date? What do you suggest?”
But Cas couldn’t help watching Dean as they all parted ways for bed. Once the door to the attic room was closed, he seemed to lose focus entirely, unloading his clothes into the dresser on his side of the room without comment, clearly lost in thought. Evidently Cas had not been imagining the man’s disquiet. He was practically vibrating with unspoken thoughts at the moment.
“I know,” Dean allowed. “You have every right to be. And for the record, I was planning to tell you and Dad tomorrow. You can interrogate me about it as much as you want back at the house. “He paused, looking up at his mother with guilt positively dripping from his sad, green eyes. “That is…if I’m still welcome.”
This is still what drives me to read to this day (and the Garden has one hell of a library, let me tell you). But this autumn has brought me a new source of magic by way of the creative process. This isn’t entirely new, of course—I did opt for a Creative Writing degree, after all, despite the apparent reality of my post-graduate circumstances. But this—this is new and utterly beyond.
Dean doesn’t seem creeped out, though. He just nods and says, “nice night for it.” He’s right, too. It’s unseasonably warm, and even with the sun creeping down past the houses, it’s truly a beautiful evening. “Listen,” Dean continues. “Are you doing anything tonight?”
“Neither can he,” Dean admits with a grim exhaling laugh. “But he’s always been headed for a nice settled life with a good fight for him to focus on, so he’s in the right spot.”
“True,” Castiel offered, unsettled by the bitterness in Dean’s tone. He was really furious with himself about this, wasn’t he? And he was taking all the blame for it upon himself. Which seemed to be very ‘on brand’ for Dean Winchester, but perhaps he was overdoing it this time. Castiel was not blameless, and he needed to set his own record straight, just as he had intended to do during their meeting tomorrow. “But you’re forgetting I lied to you, too.”
You must know by now how much I like Dean. He is beautiful, yes, and quietly brilliant, and immensely thoughtful, and I have gushed about him to you enough over these past few months. I guess I had seen our interactions as a game we were playing— the queer guy with the hopeless crush, and the hetero dude who is secure enough in himself as an ally to give as good as he gets without fear. But when even the tiniest flicker of possibility creeps in, that teasing suddenly looks dangerously similar to flirting, and that, Archangel, gave me pause. Because an unrequited crush is very different from something that could, possibly (at least theoretically) be requited.
Look, I know that twentysomethings ranting about their romantic lives is categorically NOT what you signed up for. And if you don’t wish to read this, that is fully within your rights. But the act of writing to you has so helped me over the past year, and I need that sort of help today. I don’t expect you to actually give me advice, of course— I have learned my lesson on that score, I promise. But I will imagine you at least reading my latest rambling, even if you actually threw the letter away unopened. I will picture you taking my thoughts in slowly, contemplating them in all your wisdom, and then beaming the right choice to me on the wind from the comfort of your easy chair. That, I fear, is the only outcome that will steer me right.
“Here’s hoping,” Cas offered.
“No!”
“What? Uh…” Cautiously, Dean took the envelope, his eyes glancing up at Castiel repeatedly as if waiting to be reprimanded. When no such response came, he finally opened it up, pulled out the small stack of cash, and immediately looked exasperated. “Cas – “
Dear Archangel,
Ellen emerged from the kitchen a moment later to shoo them all outside, where Bobby was, apparently, starting in on the grill. They all wandered out along the barn to join Sam in dusting off the old picnic table and tossing blankets over the hay bales that surrounded the fire pit. Cas got a huge hug from Jessica, whom he had adored since the first time Sam brought her home, and she immediately pulled him over to meet her mother and stepfather, Jan and Rick.
Castiel spent the rest of the day very nervous. It was irrational – there wasn’t any reason to believe he would talk to Dean Winchester again at all, so the fact that he is now in possession of a bombshell is irrelevant. Right?
The owner of this breathtaking property is one Dr. Charles Shurley. He inherited the estate from a rich father, as I understand it, and immediately locked himself inside to write his first set of novels. Now that I have seen where he wrote that series, I must say that the creeping paranormal quality of the story makes perfect sense. If I were living here alone, I too would come to believe in deadly flesh-eating spirits. I also might come out of the experience, like Chuck, behaving in a manner that is just a tad…let’s say “scattered”. He’s certainly what Hannah would diplomatically call “a character”. But I’m looking forward to learning from his method, if simply as a roadmap to locate inspiration within a world of utter chaos.
“You say that now,” she replied conspiratorially, “but, well, the night is very young yet.” She shifted Addy to her left hip to extend her liberated right hand. “I’m Ellie, by the way, sister of the bride and mother to this little monster.”
“Fine, fine,” Mary conceded. Then she added, somewhat grumpily, “You know, you could send me to the store, if you’re so worried about your precious biscuits.”
January 16 –
“Congratulations,” he replied, bending slightly closer to her level. “And what is your true name, Mistress Flower Girl?”
Dean glares at the kid, though with barely any heat behind it. “What’s your point?”
Cas shook himself as we watched Sam catch his brother midway across the lawn to deliver a well-deserved noogie.
manners left, so first he adds, “It’s good to see you again, Dean.” Then he turns more fully toward his house, and gives a little wave back, just as awkward as Dean’s had been.
Castiel, being without malice for mysterious evening callers, even of the unexpected variety, does not stomp as he heads down to open the door. He doesn’t make an effort to look any less schlubby and disheveled, either, but at least he doesn’t yell.
Unwilling to bend but not wanting to backtrack in their tentative truce, Castiel simply said, “We’ll agree to disagree on that part. But I’m hoping the rest of this will go toward the remainder of the debt.”
Charlie ever-so-maturely stuck her tongue out at Dean. “Well, I don’t see it out here, so I preferred not to assume.”

“Oh, I know. I’ve just gotta hope Jo leaves her knives behind when she comes after me.”
“I wasn’t sure which kind of sugar you needed,” Castiel offers apologetically as he shows off each of the labelled plastic containers in turn.
“I gave my notice a couple weeks ago. Said my goodbyes and took my time getting up here. Which was actually kinda nice, you know? I do love a road trip.” The smile that accompanied this was small, but far more honest than before.
August 31, 2018
The living room was empty, as the yard had been. But he could hear low music and voices drifting through from the kitchen. It smelled like sweet baked memories, and he took a moment to breathe in that perfect scent of “home”, eyes closed, and head tilted back in peace. Then there were footsteps on the stairs, a high-pitched squeal, and a flash of red hair launched toward Cas in an attack hug.
Cas echoed his nod and braced for the reaction. “I hated it.”
“No,” Ellen said, firm as ever in her loving way. “You, young man, are going to get a big plate of breakfast, and relax. If it would make you feel better to sit on the porch and boss us all around, fine. But you will not lift a finger today. Understand?”
Mr. Novak:
The wedding party processed solo, with the members of Jess’s quartet following Sam’s down the aisle while Trish played a soaring rendition of “Unchained Melody” on the viola. Little Addy followed, precious as a cherub in her tiny silver dress, tossing wildflowers with adorable precision just as she had, clearly, been instructed. When she reached the tree, she looked up at her mom with huge eyes and asked, “did I do it right?”, which generated a chorus of “awws” from the assembled guests as her father herded her over to a seat in the front row.
“So, Archangel,”
December 23, 2017
The food is, as promised, exceptional. Castiel thinks he can be forgiven for moaning over his first bite of the burger, even if it elicits surprised looks from both of his companions. His declaration that the burger makes him “very happy” seems to appease them both, though, and it even elicits a triumphant smile from Dean, so that seems like a win.
Dean’s kiss, once he had relaxed, was a revelation of sorts. He seemed to have mastered the interplay of firmness and softness, the give and take of things that makes both parties melt, together. His lips were soft and his tongue was lightly teasing and his hands were steady on Castiel’s spine as Castiel let his own hand roam along Dean’s neck and into his hair—
As a result, Jody wants me to throw that out the window and try something I don’t “know”.
“You’re one to talk about surprises,” he finally says, trying desperately to keep his voice relatively even. “Imagine my surprise to find out my high school crush who lives across the street is not only the sexiest man alive, but also miraculously is not married to his gorgeous landlady. Wonders have just been piling up on my doorstep for a while now.”
to meet the guy behind the words, and from the moment I did I was totally hooked. I mean…”
Mr. Novak:
There was a “harrumph” sound from the living room, but no further discussion of the matter.
Shortly after Sam and Jess had gotten engaged, Cas had received a call from the soon-to-be-groom that had begun with the unsettling question, “hey, can we talk –like, face to face?” A FaceTime call had followed (immediately, thank goodness), in which Sam had asked Castiel to be “completely honest about something.”
I will leave you with that for now, Archangel. I would like to dive into a new story idea this evening, and I must first write back to Alfie, who is struggling to decide on a costume for the school’s Halloween parade. Imagining his intense concentration as he makes this choice is bringing me the closest to homesickness that I have ever achieved, and I want to help him if I can, even from afar. Naomi (!) certainly won’t help—she thinks the only suitable costume for her children to wear involves wings and a halo. (Did I mention she’s a little fixated on this angel thing? Maybe that was implicit in the name of her farm, but it’s far more excessive, even, than that.)
“Yeah,” Dean answers. “He’s good. He’s out in California. He’s in Labor Law, so. You know. Plenty to do right about now.”
But that very afternoon marked the arrival of the gorgeous azalea you sent, and all that certainty I had built up about your disappointment evaporated in an instant. The gift immediately earned a place of honor at the window in my room, and the effect there in the morning light with the daffodil you sent before is quite stunning. I love them both, Archangel, these little pots of blooming joy that remind me you are out there, real and human, constant and supportive even when my own choices misalign with yours. Thank you, my archangel, for understanding. And for choosing me in the first place, for that matter. It means the world to me.
Dean looked stunned. “Really?”
“Nah,” Dean said, quiet himself now, his trademark playfulness finally returning around the edges. “He sounds to me like a normal schlub who’s in way over his head with this whole inheritance thing. I’d bet he relates a hell of a lot better to you than to any of the wholesome preppy kids he hooked up with in undergrad.”
I snapped myself out of my mental stall as best I could that night, and tried to reserve my confused panic spirals for moments alone staring at my bedroom ceiling. The last thing I wanted was for Dean to feel uncomfortable about his ever-so-subtle confession. I relegated my uncertain little fears to the very corner of my mind and worked my hardest to let things proceed as they had before.
she had one, frilly white dress and all) but I’ll let you know how that turns out.
Dean just nods. “Not a great match, all in all. But he’s a good guy. It was fun for a bit before the lockdowns started up.” After a moment, he adds, “He didn’t like Star Wars, though, so it never woulda worked out.”
In the falling stillness on the third-floor balcony, Castiel took a deep breath and let the truths of the weekend wash over him. He knew he needed to do some assessments of the situation—both objective and emotional. It couldn’t be put off any longer.
It’s incongruous and strange, but somehow it isn’t ominous. Dean wonders if it is a message. Or perhaps he just hopes it is.
Dean just nodded, though, before seeming to start a whole new topic. “I didn’t tell you why Lis and I really ended it, did I?”
So, we attacked Garth with questions about his relationships with the various members of his family until he got visibly flustered and called in reinforcements (Kevin). Within fifteen minutes, a text had gone around the student wing, and all of our classmates had joined in the fun.
Ellen still looked skeptical, but Mary had turned toward the dancefloor midway through Cas’s little monologue. She seemed to soften some as her eyes followed her youngest son’s joyous movements around the dance floor.
If he was thinking rationally, he probably would have admitted that Dean’s little invitation was a definite factor in the choice to come here. Yes, he was in town, but Ann Arbor was not tiny. Sarah’s office was on the other side of the main campus, and getting from there to here had involved a rather alarming volume of slow traffic and wild undergrads sprinting for the bus. But he was so twisted up about what the next day would bring – when he did, he felt, have to confess to Dean or risk imploding with anxiety – that he barreled on toward the nearest source of comfort.
All in all, it went fairly smoothly, all things considered. There was a small uproar around 12:30 about the lack of pins for the homemade wildflower boutonnieres, but the crisis was averted by Kevin, who sat down and made magic with some clothespins, twine, and a hot glue gun. That was about the point when Chuck’s book ceased to hold Sam’s worry at bay, however, so Dean dragged him upstairs for a pep talk. Whatever he said must have worked, because by the time Cas arrived in the attic room to get dressed, Sam had stopped breathing like a tea kettle and looked composed, if a bit subdued.
So, they left their underwear on. But they fell asleep curled toward each other, holding hands.
All Castiel could think was,
“But remember, I can see your bedroom light from here. Lights out is in an hour and ten. And I’ll know if you cheat – that blue light travels.”
He’s pushing a lawn mower.
I’m sorry, I simply cannot leave it like that, with a stiff word of thanks and nothing more. I meant everything I wrote to you earlier this week, truly, but the dry and pseudo-formal tone was uncalled for. You know by now: this isn’t my way, and I don’t want to leave off on such a disingenuous note.
(Don’t worry: it was just for the weekend.)
After I had allocated the ghost hunting plot to my band of teens, I decided to give a stab at some of the other concepts my classmates inspired, as well. Why not, I decided. Some of them were so fresh and outlandish— perhaps I could find something really new and exciting in the attempt.
This “family” I mention is quite miraculous, and strikes a fantastic contrast to the group I have integrated with at The Garden. Ellen’s daughter, the incomparable Joanna Beth Harvelle (or, rather, Jo— I understand the full title is only used when she is in “serious trouble”) works behind the Roadhouse’s bar with her mother. She is nearly two years my junior, a stunning young woman with long blonde hair and a knife sharp wit that puts even the nastiest customers in their place with ease. Legend has it she once made a 7 ft. Neo-Nazi cry by beating him in an arm wrestling tournament on his birthday. And the glee with which she relates that particular story is truly inspiring.
Cas squints. “In the garage?”
So, somehow, I started writing a story of two young adults fighting, largely alone, against the monsters of lore. My brother and sister team live in motels and have spanned the country several times over, saving lives under the radar from a young age, heedless of the truth that this fight should never have fallen on the shoulders of children. They do it because it is what they know and what they are best at, and by the time we meet them in my story, they think they’ve seen it all.
December 11, 2017
I believe I mentioned in my last letter that Bela was taking me to Traverse City over the weekend before Thanksgiving. Well, we went, along with Meg, and it was an excellent trip. The drive out was remarkably pleasant, given the unseasonably warm weather, and we arrived late on Friday with just enough time to order in food before turning in for the night. Money is, apparently, no object to Bela, but as this weekend was meant to initiate me into the concept of a “traditional American sleepover”, she reserved one large room with a single King bed, and we all piled in together. It was all quite cozy. And Meg even behaved herself throughout the course of this sleeping arrangement. Mostly.
“Wow, thanks, man,” Dean returns, eyebrows raised but tone impressed. At least he isn’t openly teasing Cas for his general dork-like behaviors. Gabe would be six jokes deep by this point. In the end, he points at the plain old white granulated sugar. “Just this one is perfect.”
Please, Archangel, I hope you will consider attending. It would mean the world to me.
Thankfully, the incomparable Mary Winchester saved him from having to respond. “What’s this about Rufus, then?”
So, he took a deep breath, opened the door, and resolved to just slip the envelope in the mail slot and be on his way. Hopefully Archangel didn’t have a dog that would tear it apart before it was found.
I know—it sounds unlikely, doesn’t it? That I, who know so few people in the world, should somehow come to close a circle between two groups of them…it’s like something out of a screenplay. But here I sit, writing to you from a corner booth that I’m told was once the favored after school haunt of one Dean Winchester.
Cas couldn’t decide if this was pain or ecstasy. Most likely both. And either way, it was raising tears in his throat.
Grinning, Dean got up and grabbed his toothbrush from the dresser, presumably planning to head off to the bathroom. “Ahh, yes. It'll be just like the good ol’ days,” he offered, winking at Cas in homage to pranks past. “You'll join us, right? I brought extra shaving cream if you're game to take part in some early morning Groom decoration.”
Cas nodded, confessing, “I was still sort of stunned by your dad’s relatively positive reaction by the time we got on the boat.”
And by the time he was back in the car, his daze had turned over to manic planning mode. He was already in town, anyway, so he had gone to a quiet bank branch and an undergrad-laden Staples, and he then had driven straight here. To the address he had written out at least once a month for a year.
Dean laughs again. “Well, brothers will be brothers.”
“Very,” Dean adds with an amused nod.
I write this letter to you from a remarkably comfortable lawn chair on a deck overlooking the glory of Lake Charlevoix. It is sunny, though sunset approaches, and a breeze is ruffling through my already disastrously messy hair. My feet are still coated in sand from a dip in the lake this afternoon, and I feel more awake in this moment than I ever did on Angel Farm. The world offers possibilities, breaking in these glistening waves, beaming down from these mountainous clouds.
“Ah,” Cas said, at a loss. “Well.”
So, have yet another “illegal” Thank You.
“That,” Dean tells him, leaning down to catch the gaze of those fathomless eyes, “was for leaving without letting me fucking talk.”
(Huh. That became some kind of free form poem. Cain will be thrilled to hear his classes are rubbing off on my work… Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my accidental Christmas poem!)
Dean shook himself as he returned his attention to his mother. He released Cas from his hold, and his grin turned back into a scowl. “Right. So, he is driving up tonight after all, but, apparently, he didn’t book a hotel room at all, in the end. Claims they were ‘trying to rob him with the weekend rates’. He brought a tent. But he says he expects he’ll be more comfortable in the flat bed.”
And, there it was: the sentence that made Cas short circuit. This was actually happening, and here Cas was having a crisis, and he desperately needed to figure out how to respond. Unable to find an alternative plan, he decided to own up. “Well,” he said, swallowing his last ounce of pride, along with its accompanying panic. “Right back at you.”
Dear Archangel,
Cas routinely wondered if any of the others were as saddened by this as he was, but it was just too personal a topic to broach with them. And, anyway, Dean was probably keeping up with them all just fine—Cas suspected he was the only one that had fallen completely out of touch with the man.
“You know,” Cas offered the little girl, “My mom used to call me a little monster, too. Which was especially strange since she named me after an angel.”
“What are…” he began, but the question died as he realized how little information he had to work with here. Instead, in a wild effort to find something polite to say, he tried, “Do you know…?” But, then, he didn’t have a name, did he? Heavens, this was a disaster.
December 7, 2017
Once, about six days after the incident with the rake, Castiel is making his way up the block at dusk when he is passed by a rather familiar black car. It slows down slightly as it passes him, heading up toward the tiny shopping district a few blocks away, and through the rolled down window he hears, “Heya, Cas!”
But it gets way weirder in the evening.
“Nothing,” Sam rushes to reply, eyes wide. He heads for the door with a little spring in his step. “I’ll go pack.”
So, the facts. He and Dean had reconnected: they had apologized, and rekindled their connection, and had begun to learn each other again. Dean had left Florida, likely never to return, and Castiel had offered his own home as a destination Dean might consider, at least for the remainder of the summer. In purest terms, it was all very straight forward and reasonable. But, of course, nothing is ever that pure.
Dean gave a disjointed headshake from his place on Cas’s chest, as though shaking off an insect. “It's not even really them, or the wedding. I'm not regretting what Lis and I decided, or thinking about getting back together with her or anything like that. I don't even really wish she was here, frankly. I just... people keep giving me that knowing look and saying it'll be my wedding next, and I just feel like I've failed, somehow.”
“Well, then,” Cas said, tone solemn, “as long as Aunt Mary is prepared, I'm obviously in.”
Gabe, being an avid baker when he isn’t working seven days a week, has many kinds of sugar. Hoping to get this interaction over with as soon as humanly possible so that he can spend the rest of his evening wallowing in shame and embarrassment, Castiel brings all the sugars.
The thing is, in his most embarrassing and annoying daydreams, this possibility had been floated by his traitorous subconscious. Because once upon a time, Dean spent a lot of time in that house right across the street. Not because he lived there, but because his girlfriend did. And he spent a remarkable amount of non-school time with said girlfriend, very likely without ever knowing that Castiel lived right across the street.
By the time dusk had begun to fall, all work for the day had ceased, and everyone was cleaned up and polished. Kevin Tran, Sam’s final groomsman, had arrived just after 6 with assurances that everything at Sam’s office was going just fine without him and he could stop thinking about work until after his honeymoon. As soon as Sam had relaxed (again), they all carpooled into the nearby town, where a charming catered rehearsal dinner had been set up in the hall of the Moore’s hotel. Professor Missouri Moseley, the chosen officiant for tomorrow’s festivities, was already waiting for them in the hall when they arrived, ready to walk the wedding party through the steps of the ceremony before everyone settled in to eat.
“Yeah, I know that,” Dean assured him. “Objectively, at least. I keep running those kinds of thoughts through my head like a mantra, and it helps. But then another damn relative walks up and gives me that same wink, like they expect me to be happily married to my college sweetheart by the fall, just like Sam, and I spiral down all over again.”
And wow, the face mask and mirrored glasses make it remarkably hard for Cas to make out what Dean’s face is doing. But it seems like maybe a smile? Possibly? “Oh, cool. I didn’t know you were back. Do you live around here?”
“You guys were all great with him, and he jumped right in with the banter and the bonfire songs and the weird card games, but…the whole time, I felt wrong. I wanted so badly to just be here with you all, but I felt responsible for him, for keeping him entertained, or something, and it basically ruined the week for me.”
“I swear it’s not my fault,” Cas promised. “But this has been happening to me all weekend.”
Dean’s brave enough to admit to himself how nervous he was when Sam brought up possible futures on the drive here. And honest enough to admit how relieved he was that Sam was including him in the contours of the various options. It feels different this time, and not just because Chuck is absent. This isn’t Sam finding a life with Jess or Amelia or even Sarah and leaving Dean behind. The discussion Sam wanted to have was about what they could do next together - not necessarily living together and breathing all the same air and doing all the same things with their lives, but together in the way other families stay together. They could move to the same town somewhere, maybe share a house while they get settled into general life or maybe not. They could stay at the bunker, instead, while they build something new, and then branch out on their own paths later. They could look at regular jobs that actually excite them, carve out little corners of the universe for themselves where they can be regular guys, but not have to blend in to stay safe. They could say goodbye to credit card scams for good and start off fresh, sell some of the antiques from the bunker and make themselves money, and go honest from here on out. They have so many options, to hear Sam tell it, and they can decide what to try as a group now - Sam, Dean, and Eileen. They can make those decisions without having to sacrifice each other or anyone else. They can find ways to be there for each other without holding each other back.
“Looks like we’re good to go with Plan A,” Ellen declared as the forecast wrapped up. “You’ve got some luck, there, kiddo.”
in growled words of deepest trust
Well, that’s where my project stands at the moment. If I hold on to everything I’ve written so far through the polishing and editing phase these next few weeks, I expect what I turn in to the professors in the end will be a novella of sorts.
There was a settling sense of déjà vu as Cass pulled into the space next to Bobby Singer’s ancient silver truck and let the engine of his car tick toward silence. It was bright and sunny, and he was in one of his favorite places on Earth, two cars away from a certain Chevy Impala that gleamed in the sun like it was still 1967. What else could possibly matter?
Archangel, I think I’m going to accept Jody’s offer. The pitch she gave was that I should come downstate after my graduation here, and start tutoring Claire as the new school year begins. She says she will happily recommend my services to other parents in the area as well – at least two of whom are apparently already interested in my credentials— and she would put me up in the carriage house on her property for an absurdly reasonable price if I would rather not search for my own accommodations just yet. This would afford me a place to work on my own writing while also building some financial cushioning, and would keep me in close enough proximity to the city in case my own writing opportunities expand from there. And, most of all, it sounds like the sort of setup that would let me step into the world with some sort of community around me. I cannot describe what a comfort that thought brings. At the moment, I can’t really see a downside to this plan.
“Come on, Angel,” he says, beckoning the love of his weird, long, messed up life toward the bank of the nearby river. “Let’s go for a walk.”
Apparently lost in the whiplash of the conversation, Dean shook his head slightly. “What?”
“Sure, I guess. For now.” He took a big breath, and squared his shoulders toward Cas. “Anyway. That is more than enough about me. And if we’ve learned anything tonight, it’s that I’ve missed a helluva lot about the rest of you guys.”
Dean shrugged. “That’d work. You okay with that, Cas?”
Castiel had no idea what to do with that particular minefield, so he shifted to another nagging question. “And the, uh. The last letter? From this week? Did you read it?”
Cas looked up at him in reassurance. “It should be.”
“But,” Dean repeated, grimacing a bit. “I’m a bit worried about going there without a plan for what comes after. I don’t want to get stuck, you know?”
Cas smiled ruefully. “I know. Or, well, I keep reminding myself of that fact, at least. But at the time I felt like the worst boyfriend on the planet. It took me a few months back up at school to realize that it was more of a tell about the depth of my feelings than a flaw in my ‘boyfriend skills’. It didn’t just matter if he got along with you all – I needed to feel like he was a part of the group on a deeper level, to really slide into place with us like Jess did later on. And I guess I didn’t love him enough to let that happen. That was a pretty intense realization.”
“So,” Dean offered, something final in his tone. “I’m working on it.”
So.  This weekend might turn out to be Cas’s own private disaster, but he truly was delighted for Sam, the incandescently happy couple of the moment. As long as he could focus back on the bride and groom, he could definitely get through this in one piece.
Cas winces. “I can’t decide if that’s an upside or a downside for him.”
“I don’t want to intrude.”
“Cas!” Charlie Bradbury yelled directly into his ear. It made him grin like a loon, even as his eardrum protested the assault.
Yours in Messy Gratitude,
October 7, 2017
“Addison,” she declared. “Addison Moore-Collins. What’s yours?” When Cas told her, she wrinkled her nose slightly and tilted her head in consideration. “Cass-tee-ell?”
In the spirit of the new year, I’ve decided to take another stab at a diary-entry-style letter this month. I have no idea how this will go, honestly, but it seems like an intriguing enough experiment to be worth the risk. So, I hope you enjoy this month’s series of small ramblings in lieu of the usual extended ramble.
Things progressed more predictably from there, though still with the unique flair of this bride and groom deeply ingrained. Dean gave an excellent speech, complete with AV support from Ash (the infamous Jar Jar Binks impression was even funnier when projected across the entire south wall of the barn) and a beautiful admission of his respect for his baby brother and brand-new sister-in-law. Ellie and Laurie, who had been named Jess’s “co-Best-Women”, gave a joint speech of their own to great hilarity, during which they jumped on the projector bandwagon to treat the guests to a variety of embarrassing photos of Jess throughout her life. John got up to give an unexpectedly emotional speech about how inspiring his son was to him, and Jan stood after to speak of the light Jess had always brought to everyone around her. And once it was clear there wasn’t a dry eye left on the property, Aaron invited the couple of the hour to the floor for their first dance.
working-not-working for the needy and the sad,
“Of course not,” she replied. “This ain’t a hotel, boy.” Sam clutched the manuscript close to his chest and gave Charlie his most defiant look. It wasn’t particularly intimidating, but, then, Sam had always been more puppy than attack dog.
“I do, yeah. And I think if you really look at the facts honestly, he’s not out of your league like you seem to think.”
May 8, 2018
Dean looked thrilled to hand the phone off. “Sure thing,” he said, and headed for the stairs.
“It’s in the trunk,” Dean called, looking relieved, but apparently starting to recover from his random bout of panic.
The true sarcasm queens, however, share the third floor with myself. To my room’s immediate right lives Miss Bela Talbot, the sort of person who you expect to have a roman numeral or “Esq.” at the end of her name. I haven’t worked up to asking her about her Cotillion just yet, (I am
Good grief, this has already devolved into unbearably formal rubbish, and I honestly cannot keep it up. Ordinarily I would apologize, as you are to be my benefactor and are almost certainly an elder. But, frankly, I think the best way for me to show you respect in this endeavor will be to offer you more honesty than such stiff rhetoric can afford. As I understand the situation, it was one of my snarkier, more satirical short stories that inspired you to sponsor me in the first place. So, I have to imagine you would prefer a more vibrant tone in my correspondence, anyway. If I am wrong in this assumption, please do not think me impertinent. Simply get word to me that you would prefer a more formal turn of phrase in future letters, and I shall…do my best.
Charlie finally released her friend as footsteps approached from the kitchen. “Is that John back, because I think we’re gonna need more—Castiel!”
“You little weirdo,” Ellie exclaimed, apparently stuck between amusement and exasperation. “You know Charlie!” But there was no getting Addy to talk now. “I think she’s a little star struck, honestly,” Ellie explained. “She hasn’t stopped talking about you two since you were kind enough to babysit last month. She thinks you’re the height of cool.”
Dean looked away with an uncertain huff. “Yeah, well you're a damn saint.”
“Not really. No one notable, anyway.”
Things weren’t quite as hectic downstairs this morning, thankfully. There were still quite a few people staying in the house, of course—Pam had stayed over in the room Sam vacated for his wedding night. But without the crunch of a strict timeline, they were able to linger a bit more over their food, chat and tease and laugh together before wandering out to roll rugs and load chairs into the rental truck.
They lapsed into silence again. Cas wondered if Dean was relieved, or if he was still looking ahead at his trip to Lawrence with trepidation. At least now he wouldn’t need to figure out how to break the news to Mary. But, then, they hadn’t filled her in on the permanence of Dean’s departure from Florida, so there might still be fireworks to come in the Winchester house.
The thing is, Archangel, I think being welcomed back to the Roadhouse like family opened my eyes to the reality of that particular void in my life. Looking at things with a coldly analytical eye, I have never had this sort of reception before. I never left Angel Farm for more than a school day’s length, and even if I had done, there would not have been any guarantee that the same children would be there on my return. I can’t honestly say I would expect a warm reception there. And given that my departure was so explicitly viewed as final, I’m unlikely to ever have occasion to test that theory. As for The Garden, I do receive happy greetings upon my returns here, but there is that top layer over everything, that sense of expectation, that makes the exercise feel somehow less urgent. We all knew when we left for break that we would all return again at an appointed time, so when that day arrives the reunion is no surprise. It simply is, and the impulse is to catch up rather than to rejoice particularly in the fact of the reunion.
So, as Dean stands there in the sun, he finally gets to watch his brother laugh happily with his girlfriend without dread gnawing at his insides. It feels damn good.
Meanwhile, across the street, Castiel simply stares in dawning horror as his neighbor welcomes her apparent lover into her home in a very public manner.
Cas looks at the kid, expecting to be met with annoyance. This boy has never met Castiel, after all. But he seems to be smiling, as best can be surmised through his Bat Signal branded face mask. Still, Cas hedges.
Shaking his head with a smirk, Dean gets up to follow. “Okay, lover boy. Let’s aim to head out by noon.”
But today, coming into a home full of his patchwork family exclaiming how much they missed him, his usual feeling of unfitness had receded some. He felt warm and welcomed and wanted. Even by Dean. It occurred to Cas that Dean hadn’t needed to come clean to him about Lisa. He could have shaken it off when Cas had called him out, and come up with another lie. Or if he really was some kind of lying asshole, could have just told Cas to fuck off because it wasn’t his business. But Dean wouldn’t do that, and Cas knew it. However much the pain in Cas’s heart had built up an aura of malice around the man, it simply wasn’t his way, and today had proved it. Dean seemed to have awoken out of a dream when he left Lisa, only to find a gaping hole where his friends had once been, and he was lost. Hell, just now, as he asked where Cas lived, the confused, ashamed echo in his eyes had been devastating. Cas never wanted to see that look directed at himself again.
Cas grinned at him, and they lapsed into silence, watching the crowd and listening to Dolly’s voice reverberate around the huge barn. Claire, Jody and Donna’s daughter, was cozied up in the doorway with the photographer, Kaia, and both looked a little flushed as they leaned their heads close to see the screen of Kaia’s camera. Dean seemed to have noticed them as well, and suddenly looked a bit too wistful for such a joyous day.
So, Krissy began to lay out the trouble she’s been having in her current story of focus: she feels grossly unqualified to write a standard family dynamic, having never really lived it. Her mother died before she can remember, and from then until age 13 her father was away on the road driving his truck much of the time. And after that… well, if you know anything about the Foster system, you know that not all homes are created equal. Krissy has some horror stories that, in my opinion, fully explain her drive to get to college so young. In any case, nothing in her history involves any kind of white picket fence or homemade pie made by a cheery, rested parent. The prospect of exploring a reasonably well-adjusted basic family unit was tying her in knots.
That’s not to say he suddenly wants to have a long talk with the guy about how thoroughly his life has fallen apart in the last year – he still hopes not to run into him in any capacity that might involve speaking. But the stark reminder that Castiel not only won’t ever have Dean as a lover, but clearly
I’ve joked at you before about being considered “odd”. I don’t feel sufficiently qualified to make a judgement of this kind upon myself, being so inexperienced in the alternative. But the feeling of being “other” has always been a pervading feeling in my heart. I was largely un-socialized until school, and while there the dedication to work ethic had been too deeply indoctrinated to allow me much beyond my lessons. Toss these facts in with children’s general resistance to unknown quantities, and you come out with a thoroughly educated outsider. I have known myself to be exactly this since I was old enough to consider the matter, and I have been resigned to all that could entail.
But Mary seemed mollified. “Come here,” she said, wrapping her son in a hug before holding him back for a scrutinizing look. “Are you okay?”
What a night I’ve just experienced.
And then, after a fashion, he prays.
Startled, he turns around. And there, in all his plaid flannel glory, is Dean fucking Winchester, hair gleaming in the sun, eyes crinkling around a pair of aviators, looking straight at Castiel and smiling.
Any thoughts Cas had that it would be easier to keep his gaze off Dean now that he’d had a taste was quickly disproven. They had resolved to keep their hands to themselves this morning—even if Mary and Ellen had shared the news with their respective husbands, that still left six people in the house who believed Dean was happily dating Lisa. No use giving them all the impression of infidelity when they’d all be leaving around noon anyway. Cas only had to hold it together for a couple more hours.
From the Office of Mr. Michael Smith
“Yeah, well, he’d love to make it a little more intense than that, trust me. He looks at you like tweens look at stray boy band members. And given how you wrote about him—” In a flash, Dean’s mouth snapped shut.
Dean and Cas exchanged a look as the women just stared sternly at Dean. This couldn’t be good.
“Leave your brother alone, Dean. For heaven’s sake,” Mary admonished, rolling her eyes for Cas’s benefit.
have I been less sorry
That was one—highly embarrassing, but at least concise—way to put it. “Sure seems that way.”
I was stolen from my room late Friday afternoon after classes, smuggled down to a car with two others, and driven off toward a two-day captivity in a luxurious hotel in Petoskey.
.” Dean’s head shot up with the word, tone vehement, almost fearful. “No. You answered her ad yourself, remember? And she accepted you at face value. None of them had any idea we knew each other beyond the time I ambushed you and Bela in Charlevoix. No one knew, I swear.”
It does occur to Castiel, now and again, that the mad dashes to the kitchen make very little sense unless Dean spends his days and nights standing on the aforementioned lawn to stare into the neighbor’s house.
Dear Archangel,
There was no way around it. He had to agree, even if his anxiety was on high alert. “Sure.”
I’m not sure I’m doing this story justice, Archangel. But please believe me when I tell you that what transpired from that point was, somehow, utterly enchanting. We’ve come to trust each other quite intensely with our work over the past months, the kind of trust that builds from respect and a mutual set of goals. But this was something more intense, even, than our usual discussions. This—seven of us laid out on the floor in the flickering firelight diving down in to the human experience as we’ve seen it play out— it was like a suspension. A floating moment, unique in the squall of existence.
The moments that followed were predictably comical: raised, incredulous eyebrows shifting with shocked slowness to unbridled maternal glee. Ellen let out a vaguely suggestive little “mmm” that set everyone to giggling, and then Mary was hugging both boys with a fierceness that indicated deep, deep emotion. She held them for a full minute before pulling back to simply stare back and forth between them. With a deep breath, she released them from her hold with a hurried, “Go on, then. We’ll see you at home.” Then, with a salacious grin, she added, “John and I won’t be back until at least five, by the way. The house is all yours.” Castiel was sure he had never seen Dean’s ears so red.
With a sigh, he watched Dean walk around the Impala, before sliding behind the wheel of his own car. Lord, he was already so far gone. It was a damn good thing Dean seemed to be in the same boat.
Claire, on the other hand, is more like a surlier teenage version of Jody. She’s only been with her Moms for a little over a year, so residual behavior from her time in the foster system hasn’t really worn off. She’s unsurprisingly wary, but seems to be beginning to entertain the idea that this might be the permanent home Jody and Donna assure her it is. She’s snappish and a bit obdurate, but more in the way of average teenagers than of a hurting child acting out. We’ve not started into actual tutoring yet, but I can already report she is very bright behind her cool façade. Once I manage to catch her up on some of the finer points she missed while being shuffled from school to school, I’m fairly certain she will pull even beyond the standard curriculum. We seem to understand each other, I think: I know how much she cares about making her Moms proud despite how little she’s willing to show it, and she knows I’m going to treat her like a Real Person both in spite of and because of her history. It seems like a good start, at any rate.
Becky is known for her epics, sweeping works with layers of characters and relationships, often in the Romance genre spaces. For her, Jody went a bit more down in the weeds for the assignment: she’s recommending Becky try setting some super tight restrictions on herself for an idea or two— a small scope (i.e. “2 hours, 4 characters, 1 location”), or trying an entirely new genre even if romance makes an appearance in the background, or even giving herself a word/page count and cutting down the story until it fits, no matter what. (Becky’s a bit terrified, I think, but I’d bet something really fresh will come out of this for her.)
But now that we’ve developed a deep degree of comfort with each other, things aren’t quite so firmly defined. We’re being encouraged to collaborate a lot more, both in the writing and in the critiquing. Most of our group sessions are set up more like workshops than classes now, with the professors facilitating and participating, but not lecturing or taking over. I quite like it, so far. Since our areas of focus and our styles vary so widely, it seems to open us all up to have such a mixture of ideas expressed. Any piece brought to class gets read into the ears of a poet, a romance writer, a thriller specialist, and a bunch of others all at the same time, and so can benefit from all the perspectives, rather than one line of inquiry. What better way could there be to avoid becoming mired in cliché than to stretch outside the box, stylistically? I did a fair amount of work on a couple new ideas during my time in East Jordan, and so far, I’ve been immensely enjoying the reactions of my various classmates and teachers to those pieces. I can’t wait to see in what directions their impressions and ideas ultimately take me.
“Sounds reasonable,” Cas offered after a moment, but Dean only sighed.
(Please forgive my lack of polish as I try to explain? We truly were up all night, and I could not wait to put this down, so I am tragically sleep deprived. I am not certain, for example, that “epiphanistic” is a legitimate English word. But within this warm bubble of dawn where people can learn from each other and make the world grow whole, I cannot be bothered to care about anything as trivial as proper English.)
I should get back to work now, unfortunately. Well, not “unfortunately”— I do enjoy the work here, especially these days. But I also enjoy writing to you, even when it feels like shouting into the void. Thank you for hearing my confession this month, Archangel. Thank you for being my void.
That startled a chuckle out of Dean, relaxing away any concern Cas’s laughter had caused. “Definitely how I’m feelin’ at the moment, yeah.
“Excellent idea.”
“Mmm, yes,” Cas replied. “Nothing like sleeping in a twin bed, three feet away from your new boyfriend. Sounds very sexy.”
After a few giggle-filled moments, Dean calmed enough to say, “Yeah, okay, Yoda.”
Ben rolls his eyes. “Fine, heck yeah. Happy?”
Right! Classes! Much of this has been, at least to an outsider’s eye, more of the same. We’ve been workshopping everyone’s work and sharing reading material between ourselves, everything I’ve mentioned before. It’s the specifics that have been particularly exciting, I suppose—seeing classmates have breakthroughs on problem pieces, or even having small breakdowns about deeply held issues. Several class sessions have devolved into therapy-session-like discussions. Especially with Pam at the helm, who possesses a sincere, measured tone of thoughtful questioning that any good counsellor should envy.
And then there’s the arrival of the food. The delivery person comes right to the back yard, for some reason, rather than going to the front door, and is greeted by name by both Ben and Dean. Aaron, who looks to be a little younger than Dean and Castiel, is cordial with them in the way of old friends, and even makes vaguely playful (or perhaps flirty?) conversation with Cas once they’ve been introduced. But before he can untangle that reality, the food has been dispersed, and Aaron is gone.
Beyond that, she simply wants me to aim for something honest in this project. My characters are allowed to act and think sardonically, if desired, (as that is my usual impulse…) but for the underlying tone of the story she wants me to forego sarcasm and parody for the purposes of this exercise. She complimented my work in that particular arena, which has been central to stories like the one about to be published and the one you read last year. But for this project she wants me to explore something else. (Don’t worry, Archangel, I don’t intend to abandon the one style I know you enjoy!) From there, she simply says “let the work expand as much as it wants. Let it have genres, even if it bridges them. Let it build out into the unknown, and do not be afraid.”
And then there’s my awesome boyfriend. He’s a writer— like, for real, even his writer friends call him the Energizer Bunny ‘cause of how much he writes. He’s even published. He is so much cooler than me, and I fucking love it. He might be clueless when it comes to how to properly load a dishwasher, but he fucking writes me poetry. Who ever thought anyone would want to write sonnets to
Cordially,
There was a suspended beat as soon as Cas finished speaking, a tiny shift in the air as the tone of the conversation stood on a precipice. Dean leaned back so he could see Cas’s face, and just started for a moment. Then they both burst out laughing.
So, Castiel pressed on. “I’m looking for…the person who lives here? I’m sorry, but I only know them by a pseudonym.”
There was a stunned silence at their little table. Dean was rarely so overtly bitter, especially around his mother.
Cas gestures vaguely back the way he came. “Just coming back from a walk,” he explains, feeling supremely weird about the statement as it leaves his mouth.
that it brought me here.
Dean’s response came out in a very small voice. “Hey, Cas.” He had not moved yet, still standing with his now empty hand held slightly out in front of him. He was clearly going to be no help in this state.
“Uhh,” Cas was jarred. This conversation was giving him whiplash. “You said that you two decided it had run its course.”
I was welcomed in to worship in this chapel pub,
“Oh, you do, do you,” Dean laughed, clearly catching on.
November 1, 2017
The truth is, I had no one on Earth to invite to my commencement other than you, you see? The crew in East Jordan has done more than enough for me during our brief acquaintance, Hannah is exceedingly busy and anxious with a new internship just now, and Angel Farm? Well, Alfie is too young to drive, and undoubtedly has better things to do with the new school year approaching. No one else there would be much interested in my life, at this point.
But more on that in the next letter, eh? What have you missed of my life since I last wrote?
“You love me,” Cas retorted before he could think it through. Then he tried not to panic as the previous tense gravity seemed to flood right back into the room.
Sam let out an exasperated sound. “He’s planning to sleep in his truck all weekend?!”
Dean wasn’t far behind, and gazed around with a reminiscent smile. “Man, just like old times.” He dropped his bag at the foot of his bed and plopped down, facing Castiel. “So, how are you, dude? I feel like I haven’t talked to you in forever!”
“I…” and, wow, that is not a question Cas has been asked in months. Even without the added Lisa confusion, Castiel suspects he wouldn’t be sputtering any less than he is right now. “Um, no, not really. Reading, I suppose.”
Dean still wasn’t looking at him, but he at least seemed amused. Completely incredulous, Cas shook his head. “Dean. I was a super nerd with questionable people skills. Where exactly did you think ‘cool’ entered into that equation?”
He thanked her, refusing to let her unquestioning acceptance choke him up again. He should be used to it by now, probably, but it never seemed to touch him any less than the first time.
Though, if he continues to leave Dean hanging, the night might turn back into reality far too soon.
The evening progresses in much the same way, right on through the end of the movie. Then things get confusing again.
I must sign off now. Mrs. Novak is out, and dinner needs making. But I look forward to writing again when I have things to tell, Archangel. Until then, adieu.
“Still. I trusted my Dean implicitly by the end of that ski trip. And yet all through the next six months I was still too afraid and ashamed to tell the truth.”
Sam, ever the adult, stuck his tongue out at Charlie. She responded with the international hand gesture for “I’m watching you”.
Somehow, Dean’s eyes got even wider than that. “Lisa knew?!”
“Tell him to stop apologizing, would you?” Sam asked, looking affectionately exasperated as he began to open the package Cas had pulled from his backpack. “He already called and sent me a letter. But it’s our own fault for putting the thing together on such short notice. His book tour had been scheduled months before we set the date. We completely under—HOLY SHIT.”
Dear Archangel,
Archangel, I’ve been kidnapped!
An unexpected turn, no? That I should come across yet another group of Michiganders who consider my new acquaintance Mr. Winchester to be a kind of family? Well, that appears to be exactly what has transpired, and to add to the irony, I’m learning even more about him here at the Roadhouse than I did when we were face to face.
Cas took in a slow breath. So, apparently Friday’s melodrama was back. Along with his over-emotional internalization of random song lyrics. Lovely. Well, at least he was consistent.
“I guess, but…” Dean turned back into the night, looking stricken. “You didn’t do it because of a lover, you know? When you were with Balthazar, it didn’t change anything about how you kept up with us. I just feel like a stereotypical sell out: I went chasing after a girl and forgot my family.
“Uh huh,” Cas agreed, raising an eyebrow. “And either Ellen or Bobby will be washing these sheets in the morning.”
“There was this day at the end of the week, I don’t know if you remember—”
“I’m working on it,” Cas offered, winking. “Maybe one day.”
“Just needed a change of scene?” Cas asked.
Those vacations had been a true highlight for Cas when he was growing up. It was always a rowdy group, with the Harvelles, the Winchesters, Bobby, and at least one of the two remaining Novaks. They would all drive up to Ellen’s lake house and spend a week or so simply being there together. It was pure heaven, as far as Cas was concerned.
So, for tonight I shall simply curl up in bed to gaze again at my beautiful flowers, wishing only that they could live forever.
Every word I had uttered and action I had taken in conference with Dean Winchester had been chosen under the erroneous assumption that the most I could ever hope to become to the man was some kind of friend. But suddenly I had to strip that parameter away, and I was left in a haze of wondering.
Sam responded with a dark look. “You don’t know the half of it. It was like sleeping through an air raid. And he was in another tent.”
Dear Ms. Middleton/Mr. Smith/Archangel,
feel to it— a world where supernatural monsters exist but most people still don’t believe in them. The concept was a suave, almost James-Bond-like character who secretly hunted monsters by pretending to be a government agent, and in this instance the hunt was focused on the ghost of a dragon haunting a castle. Even for a seasoned ghost hunter, my thought was that a dragon-sized ghost (who would still, presumably, be able to breathe fire) would pose a new challenge.
With Renewed Excitement,
“Heya, Sammy.”
“My room,” Dean told her, eyes still glittering in Cas’s direction.
Ellen recovered herself first. “Fine, but it is June, son. You couldn’t have mentioned this at any point in the last couple months?”
Castiel, for his part, was at a loss. When the silence had dragged on too long for him to handle, he eloquently ejected, “Um, I—“
“But even without any of that,” Dean continued, “we always had this… bond. It was easy and comforting and domestic in its way, sure. But there was also this extra level of excitement to share things with each other, because we knew the excitement would be really mutual. Passion, in its way. It was never like any other relationship in my life, romantic or otherwise.” He furrowed his brow. “At least that’s how I’ve always felt.”
The way she put it to me was this: “Try something big and personal, but outside your active life experience. Find a place where these two concepts meet, and let them combine. Meld them into something new and special and uniquely your own.” She encourages research and questioning of people, of course— how can one expand one’s mind without opening it up to learn? But she doesn’t want me to cut myself off from avenues because they are foreign. Instead, she wants me to use the tools at my disposal to learn about them, and then make them my own.
“Yeah, well, not lying to you for ten months might have been pretty thoughtful, too.”
It’s weighty, this admission, even if there’s a 50/50 chance he’s just talking into the dark. But it’s out, now. It’s done.
More unfortunate than wandering thoughts, however, is the excessive paranoia they have ushered in with them. This was, as has been stated, the one person Castiel openly prayed would not see him slinking back home with the stub of his proverbial tail between his legs, and that has not changed.
”? Who knows. We might split up at some point to write our own pulls from this joint brainstorm, but for now we’re having a great time sharing the process. I’ll keep you updated if anything dramatic happens, Archangel, I promise.
In the wake of this came a long pause. Cas’s mind was an echo chamber of the phrase “what the fuck”. And, again, Dean was the one to break the silence, this time with slow, deliberate words.
As they returned to their dance, Dean spoke up, a new sort of sly hope in his voice. “Do you have to go straight back home tomorrow?”
It’s not that I suddenly think less of Dean, Archangel. Sexuality is not some magical barometer of “goodness” or “badness”. It is simply a piece in the whole of a person. But I certainly needed to reexamine
“I’m sorry.” He didn’t know what else to say. His insides seemed to be bouncing back and forth between joyful back flips and sympathy heartache. Dean just shrugged. “When?”
Dean popped his head down from the top of the stairs. “I’d quote that adage about ‘too many cooks’, but you two definitely do not qualify as ‘cooks’.”
Dear Castiel,
I suppose I misspoke (miswrote?) just now – I had “interacted” with a smartphone before last month. Hannah has had one as long as I’ve known her, so I observed her using it when we were in classes or studying together. I never really handled the thing, though. Same goes for my classmates here at the Garden – I’ve observed their use of their own phones, even watched things on their screens, but I never really worked with them myself.
Let’s see, what have you missed during my October-long letter-writer’s-block? Well, early in the month we learned that Becky, our resident romance novel fanatic, is actually quite an impressive poet when she puts her mind to it. Even Cain, our most poetically inclined professor and the author of the assignment itself, was speechless after she finished reading a heartbreaking long form iambic piece about freshly requited love. Frankly, we were all shocked. I suppose given her tendency toward excitability and grand dramatic plot lines, we had all expected Becky to be a superficial writer, obsessed with idyllic romance to the point of cliché. But she has certainly proved us wrong over the course of our recent poetry studies. And shame on us for doubting her, really. Even the most predictable of tales can be deeply personal and fraught with nuance, whatever the literary world might proclaim, and we would do well to shed elitist views if we wish to open ourselves to possibility in our work. I’d say we all owe Becky for the reminder of that fact.
Cas Novak
Mary pursed her lips in annoyance. “I’m not gonna burn down the house just by touching the oven, Ellen.”
There was a weight to Dean’s words, something deeply important hiding under the guise of a repeated conversation. “And I neglected you right back,” Cas reminded him, trying to be forceful. “Largely out of spite.”
Greetings from the grey slushy north! It is March, and I have just arrived back from a lovely, somewhat productive but exceptionally rejuvenating “spring” break in Boyne Falls.
Enough about the past, then. I’m sick of it, honestly, and I defy the belief that all writers must be maudlin and subtle in their self-reflection. I am being set free from one hell of a cage, and I am determined to add a bit of irreverence to my life. (At least in writing—I’m told I come off as “odd, serious, and dryly witty” in person. And yes, “Odd” always comes first...)
“No point,” Ben replies, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Just making an observation. It’s good to see.”
All eyes were on him. He had no logical reason to object, as far as he could tell. At least, no reason he was willing to share with the class. There was nothing for it but to say, “Sure.”
“We’re not really sure,” Mary replied. “Dean’s waiting for word, but he says it doesn’t look good.”
Handing the tablet off to the kid, Dean jogs down to the curb, apparently determined to chat with Castiel from across the street. “Whatcha up to?”
“Yeah, exactly.” There was a brief silence, then, full of music and chewing. Cas wasn’t as tense, here alone in the dark with Dean, as he had expected to be. Whatever would be would be.
“Don’t mention it,” Cas replied, rumbling voice just loud enough to be heard. “I think it could have gone a lot worse.”
With no way out, he turns and calls back, “Hello Dean,” in his best impersonation of the voice of someone who didn’t just witness something very complex and unanticipated.
Well, too late now. He would just put it inside the screen door, and someone would find it eventually. It wasn’t going to get rained on with the sturdy porch roof overhead, anyway.
“Lisa and I had a fascinating conversation about our various dead relatives the first time you brought her home to visit,” he explained.
Cas sighed, reluctantly starting to understand the strange logic of this situation. “He’s going to be furious with you when you do tell him.”
Archangel—in all the chaos over the smartphone, I realize that I never told you about Christmas at the Roadhouse! So, in thanks for the gift, I shall set that tale for you as if it were a fictional story. (Just keep in mind that I have written this for you, draftless, directly onto this page. It is by no means edited or otherwise tailored for public consumption. It is a fresh, raw memory, rendered specially for you. Please do not judge too harshly or worry that your money is being put to poor use…)
for off-beat holiday classics projected above the bar,
“Ugh.” Attempting to look disgusted and failing miserably, Dean moved over to his own bed.
Starting to get wound up again by the thousand possible explanations bouncing around in his mind like Power Ball numbers, Castiel decided he needed to get things moving. “I’m confused, Dean,” he began, making sure no frustration or aggression crept into his voice. “The person who lives here – are they in?”
Dean’s eyebrows shot up at that. “I’m sorry, you bought a house?!”
I, who do not know your real name or profession or even generational identity.
All this is why I took the risk of inviting you in the first place, Archangel. I knew, objectively, that it was unfair of me to request such a thing of you. It was made plain from the start that I was never to know you, and how could I expect someone of your stature and importance to drop everything just to drive across the state to watch some twentysomethings receive a certificate? It is, on its face, an absurd idea.
January 12 –
What else? Well, I finished and polished up a new piece recently, a comedic short story reimagining of a biblical scene, of all things. It’s that moment early in the Christmas story where the Angel Gabriel comes to tell Mary she’s going to mother the son of God. Except, in this telling, Gabriel is a complete brat—an overly casual, vaguely bored jackass, making snotty jokes and slightly lewd references while he sucks on a lollipop and completely upends poor teenage Mary’s entire world. There’s something deeply disturbing about Mary, who I’ve always maintained got the raw end of the whole “human inducted into the divine” deal, being callously introduced to her role by a male-presenting being who thinks it’s all simply hilarious. Plus, I’ve always enjoyed the idea of the Christian angels having extreme personalities. Especially if those personalities lean perilously close to “asshole”. In all honesty, it’s the sort of day dream I used to have during childhood Sundays while Naomi and I sat through a third straight hour of Bible study in the chapel, (a game of High-Stakes Devout Chicken she liked to play with the other church ladies). The way I see it, power tends to corrupt humans with such regularity, so can these angels REALLY be all that different? Doubtful. There’s got to be a bad egg or two. Or, at least, a dork among their ranks somewhere. And the whole angelic order just reeks of Patriarchal Nonsense. Hence sassy dick Gabriel.
Dean smiled at that. “Yeah. It’s been a great weekend.”
Then another voice joined in the confusion, as the sound of footsteps began to emanate from a nearby hallway. “Char, you forgot your…”
Left, rather suddenly, alone again, Castiel tried to settle himself by taking in the room around him. It was a cozy space, walls of a soft blue circling a set of complementary furniture, mismatched just enough to suggest pieces were collected one by one across a lifetime. The sofa and chairs were quite clearly lived in, nothing freshly bought or plastic wrapped, but certainly well maintained.
“That’s where I live.”
Once inside, Cas skulks just to the side of the upstairs front window, where he’s pretty sure he can’t be seen from the outside due to the play of the light and the very thin curtain. He watches, like the creep he is, as Dean rakes the remarkable quantity of leaves that have collected on the lawn of the Braeden house. He has a whole system, with an old fashioned rake and a tarp, like he’s been doing this for so long he has it down to a science. He probably has been, come to think of it. That kid the other night looked about the right age to have been born just a couple years after they all graduated. Maybe the Braedens passed on the house to the next generation when Lisa had her kid, and this has been Dean’s domain ever since. It’s not like Gabe would know – he was rarely awake when at home even before the pandemic sucked up all his free time, and being nosy about the neighbors doesn’t interest him nearly as much as hospital gossip.
Then he puts them all down again so he can put on his mask before returning to the door with his haul.
A very annoying song.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean melted almost immediately, indulging in the contact as he adjusted into Cas’s space. “Thanks, Cas.”
I hope you’re having a lovely and restful holiday season so far. I certainly am, now that I’m set up here in East Jordan. I’ve been here for a little over a week, and have enjoyed it immensely.
“Well, but Charlie said…”
Even with the small army of helpers, the morning was a busy one. They needed setup complete before 1:00 at the latest so that everyone could get cleaned up and dressed before guests started arriving. Cas, wanting to be as useful as humanly possible, bounced from task to task without complaint, and by the time Rick, Trevor, and Kevin arrived, the space was really coming together. The yard had a soft, rustic feel, with old, mismatched rugs laid out in front of the huge tree that would stand as the altar, and draped over the hay bales at the fire pit for the reception. One long, slim, blue rug was laid out as the aisle, running up between the chairs and around to the side of the barn for the procession, and it had been lined with small bundles of wildflowers, expertly arranged by Charlie in borrowed brightly-colored vases. They had set out rows of folding chairs, and decorated the tables behind the guest’s seats, which overflowed with the weather aids Cas had helped sticker the day before. Parking instruction signs, painted on stakes, were set up along the lawn to ease the guests’ arrival, and dresses and suits were steamed and pressed en masse in the living room. The trio from the Moore’s hotel arrived around the same time as Dean’s college friend Aaron, who would be acting as the DJ during the reception, so they graciously helped him set up his equipment in the corner of the barn. Along the other side, Ellen directed the caterers to get the buffet laid out for dinner, placing what was needed so that food could be brought in seamlessly after the ceremony.
Apart from the work, all seems to be well. I’m fully recovered from my illness (have you burned the infamous letter yet? I wasn’t joking about that part.) And excepting some slight misgivings about the Christmas break, I’m in excellent spirits.
balm for the loneliest of holidays-for-one.
The rite itself was fairly brief. Professor Moseley, clad in what appeared to be judge’s robes of stunning blue, treated the assembled guests to her thoughts on the ingredients for a strong marital partnership. She gave the bride and groom her best advice, both as a mentor and as a friend, then led them through their vows. Through it all, Sam looked like he was glimpsing the face of heaven, and Jess looked no less enraptured. It was beautiful, by any standard, and if Dean seemed to be wiping his eyes by the end, Castiel couldn’t entirely blame him.
Let me explain. I’m not sure what you’ve learned about me from Dr. Visyak, but my upbringing was not what you’d call “overly pleasant”. I was an orphan, taken in somewhat grudgingly by a strictly pious farmer. When he promptly died, I was left in the care of his rather severe wife, who regularly assured me that she only kept me around to impress the other women at church with her generosity. Eventually, she also came to appreciate the government’s own generosity as regarded her status as foster mother, and she expanded her horizons to take in other children. I became useful, then, as I could be enlisted to look after the younger children. The ones she had chosen.
He’s shaking. He might be crying. He’s never been less sure that his words are being heard, and that includes both times he was in Purgatory. The weight of being truly free sinks down.
“Why?”
Anyway, there I was, sore in previously undiscovered muscle centers of my own body, attempting to melt into the world’s only comfortable leather couch, being plied with wine by a deeply unapologetic Meg Masters, when Dean texted me.
Anyway, I’m digressing all over the place. I should probably let you stop reading my nonsense so that you might return to your Very Important Life. As you do, simply picture me on this porch in the evening sun as Meg drops pieces of grass in my hair under the mistaken impression that I’m unaware.

After a week and a half, Dean finally smacks his brother upside the head and tells him to go see his damn girlfriend in person, already. Eileen, saint that she is, hasn’t gotten angry with Sam yet over the fact that they’ve known where she is since the day after Jack walked off into the sunset without making any effort to visit. But Dean is more than happy to get angry on her behalf.
, Castiel was here, and Dean was starting to kiss him back, and it was everything.
“I don’t know, magic?” Dean’s smile was brilliant in the moonlight.
“This isn’t really about me, though. I don’t want it to be, anyway. What I hate most of all is the thought of Cas stuck in that giant shitty void for all eternity thinking none of us really cared about him, you know? I thought he knew different, but now… I’m worried we never let him know. I’m worried he had no clue how loved he was, how important in a personal, visceral way. I’m worried he thinks he never really mattered.
Kevin, the sort of perfectionist who puts even the rest of us to shame, is being encouraged to relax his style to see what new can bloom through. His writing is often dense and intense, so Jody wants him to try something comedic— bits of satire, or sitcom scripts, or even standup sets— something wholly new and outside his comfort zone, either running with the formulas of the genre or breaking all the rules, depending on his mood.
For a long few seconds, Dean stands absolutely still, sure he must be hallucinating. His brain is filling in the moment with the one and only thing that could make it even better, surely. That’s the only explanation that makes any senses.
“I am your mother!”
Well. With that all said, I suppose this really is my final letter to you. In case you’re waiting with baited breath to know the tale’s end, allow me to share some exposition from the denouement of my graduate year.
The silence persisting between them seemed to thicken as the song began to wind down. The tempo had picked up toward a rock beat, but Dean didn’t seem to register the change as he rocked them slowly. The world, to Cas, had narrowed down to fingers at his back and a pair of broad shoulders, and he could swear he felt a magnetic heat radiating into him, twin to the cascade he sent out himself. Even the thought of that was exhilarating. Terrifying. That Dean might be experiencing this same ignition of emotion? Could he afford to even imagine that possibility? Would he ever recover?
We will also have a visiting instructor later in the year, as I understand it, but for the moment we are settling in to our first semester with just the four professors and the Estate’s staff.
The admission, so small and apologetic, sent Castiel to his feet. He needed to move, to pace across the room, to look at things. He crossed toward one of the inset bookshelves, and let his eyes land on a photo of a young man and woman. This was not the couple from the portrait – the clothes were from the wrong era, and the woman’s hair was light and long. It hit Castiel that this must be John and Mary Winchester, early in their courtship. With a measured breath, Castiel let out some of his jumbled musings, thinking aloud. “I poured out everything in those letters. All my childhood bullshit, the isolation.” With a jolt, another piece slotted in to place, and he turned back to Dean. “I came out to you twice, then? And I mooned over you
Option A assumed that Dean had deliberately backed away, wishing, perhaps, to appease his girlfriend or parents-in-law, or even just to escape into a more “normal” kind of life away from their quirky little clan of Kansans. Cas had thought that the impression he’d made on Lisa when they met had been a good one, but one never really knows, right? If she’d sensed Cas’s own yearning for Dean, perhaps she had felt threatened. The whole idea hurt, because he had always thought Dean would be more loyal to his family.
Sam just surveys him for a second. “Okay, let’s go.”
With gratitude and love,
It was a spectacular evening, clear sky and breeze whipping by to set the stage for the moonlight on the lake. Realizing with surprise that it was only 9:30, Cas opened the sliding window in their attic room and decided to sit on the balcony for a bit. He set his phone to play some soft music, and settled in to enjoy the distant water glinting in the starlight as the quiet descended.
The groom rushed down the last few steps to envelop Cas in a hug of his own.
And, in an instant, Dean’s face had shifted to wide-eyed mortification. “Okay, good point,” he said, backing away.
“Huh?”
But Castiel persisted. He needed to know. “All of them?”
I have a bone to pick with you. When I casually mention in a letter that I wish my lovely flowers could last longer than a few days, that is not an invitation to send me a potted plant! I would never be so forward as to casually request such a thing of you, my benefactor! And even if I did, you should not acquiesce such a wish- you will surely spoil me if you continue to shower me in flowers.
“Common misconception,” Dean allows. “But you assumed wrong on that one, too. In fact, you met my most recent ex earlier tonight.”
“Okay, a ‘rocker’, then,” Dean tried, exaggeratedly mimicking Cas’s hand quotations.
“Thank you for your excellent engine maintenance guidance, Jo. Even from afar, your expertise was, as always, appreciated.” Cas said, sneaking his hand around to ruffle her hair.
Or, I suppose it isn’t necessarily evening for you as you read…but it is currently evening here, for me, as I write. So, consider my greeting variable to your circumstances as the reader, I suppose, and I shall do the same. It seems a bit excessive to expect you to walk away and return to read the letter in the evening, after all.
With the wakeup call effectively complete, the morning of setup began in earnest. Jess’s portion of the bridal party was executing their various preparations at the Moore’s hotel in town, so the remaining setup for the ceremony fell to the Winchesters and their various helpers. When Cas arrived in the living room around 6:30, hoping to grab some food and a task, he found Mary, Ellen, and Sam all crowded around the TV with rapt attention.
There are two other employees of the Roadhouse who I’m told are no less “family” for lack of a blood tie to the Harvelles. Benny LaFitte, a bear of a man with a charmingly heavy Cajun dialect, splits his time between the bar and the kitchen, recreating Ellen’s recipes with impressive ease and designing fresh specials to entertain the regular customers. He tells me that he found his way to Northern Michigan from his native New Orleans by chance, hitchhiking north after the tragic death of his one true love until he found a place that “felt right”. (Jo tells me that this is a fable he tells strangers, and that when he gets drunk next I’ll hear about how his ex cheated on him with her boss and had the nerve to keep their pet tortoise when she kicked Benny out. Apparently, the tortoise is/was named Herman. No one is certain of the ex-girlfriend’s name, though. He refuses to speak it aloud.)
“He left everything to me, Cas,” Dean interjected. “Well, me and Sam, but…you know about that part. And it’s a whole lot of money. Grandpa put both me and Sam through college – though we told everyone that was all scholarship money, since Dad woulda lost his shit that we talked to his Dad at all. So, yeah, he left a whole big estate, and I handle it now. Or, I try to, anyway.”
And then, the ache of this emotional incongruity was only compounded by the openness of the quiet and the conversations we shared along the way. That day at the lake was like a religious experience. Dean, a man who holds his hurts and worries close so as to protect the ones he loves, was suddenly unencumbered, utterly relaxed in his trust of me. We lay there on the grainy beach in the afternoon light, and it was more than I ever could have imagined. Something about him is effervescent on any given day, glowing through like a beacon even in darkened hallways and grey, foggy dawns. But there in the yellow heat, Archangel, he positively shone, drawing my stare like the North Star. It would have been embarrassing if anyone had been around to watch me endlessly gaze, but I couldn’t seem to stop. It was like I could see his soul alight, glittering there on his skin, burning out into the universe with a purpose, even as he dozed in the sun.
He forgot to open the window.
Castiel blinked. “You…know?”
If he was being rational, he would have been able to admit that it wasn’t the car’s fault. It wasn’t even the CD- he loved this album. The problem was the trip itself. He was a single man driving home alone to attend a wedding, and he was miserable. Not because he wasn’t happy for the couple- it would be a lovely wedding. And he hadn’t been able to really see the whole of their patchwork family together in one place in 6 or 7 years. It was practically a reunion, and he was excited to see them all. They weren’t the problem.
He nodded. “I mean, clearly there’s some shit to come when everyone finds out I lied. And all those expectant relatives were annoying last night and tonight and stuff, but…” He sighed out toward the distant lake before continuing. “I think you had the right idea. Lisa would have taken care of herself just fine up here, but I would have still felt obligated to split my attention a bit. And I would have missed a hell of a lot.” Then he turned his gaze down with a frown. “More than I already did, that is.”
Castiel takes a long time to decide if he’s going to respond to this, push the cryptic statement a bit to see if it was meant to elicit his curiosity as it so thoroughly has. But, then, he’s embarrassed himself in front of this man several times tonight and that really just resulted in them laughing together. Fuck it. It’s been a shitty year – how much worse could a little push make it?
Thankfully, Charlie came to his rescue, breaking the silence by donning an air of false excitement and snatching the dice bag from Dean’s hand. “Whoops, I’m gonna be late! Gotta go! Cas, come on in! Good to see you! K, see ya!” The whole thing happened in seconds. And then Castiel was standing in a cozy foyer with Dean, and Charlie was gone.
“When would have been an appropriate time, though, really?” His anger had burnt out, leaving him just sounding exhausted now. “In March, when he flew down for a day to ask me to be his Best Man? In April, when he was calling me every day to agonize about rings and vows and tux fittings? Last month after the wedding shower?”
Castiel’s eyebrows continued to climb up his forehead as the list went on. But he couldn’t help himself. “And the jonquils?”
I’ve been trying to define the how and the why of it all. I imagine you’re thinking that’s a fruitless pursuit, and you’d probably be right. Why examine a transcendent experience when I should just be experiencing it, eh? Well, I cannot help myself. Call it a curse of my trade. I must wonder, explore, dissect. It has become my nature, for good or ill
“I could say the same to you,” Castiel counters, setting this additional astonishment aside for the time being. There were more pressing matters. “I could also say I very much assumed you were interested only in women.”
Yours in Anticipation,
Chuckling drily, Dean took Cas’s waist. “Yes, we do. Ellen will be watching, even if Mom isn’t. Come on.”
