John unfolded himself from his chair, pushed aside his thoughts and his hopes for clean laundry today, and accompanied woman and dog to the aforementioned crime scene. Anderson was at the barrier, and was their first obstacle as he had always been. This had not changed since MacPherson’s first case some weeks ago, “I won’t have a dog contaminating my crime scene.”
The expression on her face as they’d walked away changed the entire tenor of John’s day.
He hadn’t been able to answer Sarah’s texts, not that they likely contained anything but thinly veiled annoyance and resignation.
John scoffed. He had plenty of encounters, just none that mixed work and sex. He was in a position of leadership, and he needed to set an example. Actually, it had been a long while. At least two years. Jesus fucking hell. “No, I got that stupid nickname because—”
He lifted the creaky, rusty gate and vowed that the second he found her he was going to shout until he was hoarse and hold her until he stopped feeling so sick inside…
Sherlock’s voice dropped. “I could tell you more about your sexual habits or your propensity for danger and risk.”
John groaned, and shoved his phone back into his pocket, ignoring all of the texts.
The car wasn’t even locked. He could jump out, but he really wanted toad in the hole and his leg would bitch for days if he jumped from a moving vehicle.
He had called several times in the last few days, but nothing so blood-chillingly on point as this moment. John could not hear the entirety of the conversation, but a penny dropped behind Sherlock’s eyes. She ended the call abruptly.
Sherlock fumbled with the key card, ignoring Gavin’s words. They distracted her from her purpose. She had taken up languages and international customs not only for research, but for the Work. She had learned languages because she wanted to do it, but also because it would prove useful for John’s eventual postings, where she might take cases in the native language. She had long ago abandoned the flight of illogic that had been their separation in her mind.
“What she means to say…” Mycroft drawled.
Lies, all lies. However, it bought them time to get the whole story explained. John merely shrugged as best as he could, cuffed loosely as he was, “We’ve been working on a tangental case. Several parties have been interested in security at the bank where she worked. Her name came up.”
He found his friend’s commentary adroit and more verbose in this book than any of the others she’d sent. John had the feeling that she had, over the past few months, been opening up in small ways after recoiling for a time. He’d been sent novels in French and German, and he himself had grown bolder, sticking notes and mini-book reviews in between the pages. He’d wondered if her packages were screened for letters, and gotten a bit creative in response to that supposition.
“John, do be serious.” The woman in question looked up from her magazine as she sat on a chair, one she claimed to read for research purposes, though John knew better, “I am minding MacPherson. I do not intend to debate gender dynamics at this time. You should stop considering masculine coded work as more challenging.”
Carter looked to John, “Would you?”
“Three continents in one day in some kind of life saving surgical record…” Murray omitted the details purposefully to try and rile John, stole a crossword book, and wandered jauntily towards the doorway that led into the surgery space, “Still think you shouldn’t have told me the truth. I liked you better when I thought you were a whore.”
When he arrived at work, they were glutted with the first swoop of late autumn’s colds and bronchial issues. John spent the morning providing scripts for nebulizer treatments and steroids. Over lunch, John ate his insipid pot noodle, ignored the looks of interest from the nurses, and went to address Mr. Frank’s gout. It was simply nice to have a patient who had little clue who John was outside of being his doctor.
John called for the PCs to enter, and found that Evie Upton entered the kitchen. He supposed he owed Mycroft and Lestrade a favor. Evie was probably one of the less irritating locals. John greeted her, and filled her in quickly. What she might do was beyond him, but at least this had the veneer of going through the correct channels.
John shook his head to chase away thoughts of Gramps. He had been the reason John had made peace with his choice to join up. He had served in WWII, and on his few visits home, Gramps had been the only one not to ask questions John could not answer. Often in those silences, Gramps had given him answers he’d never known he was seeking, just with the simple filling of a glass and a knowing glance.
John started at her happy manner. They were fucking British. He was supposed to be nice to the waitress, who was doing him a favor, not the other way round. “I didn’t order—”
“Did you arrange it?” John asked, not fussed either way, placing the flannel that Hawker had been using as one of their own.
Sherlock headed out of the airport, only to see Mycroft there, tapping his umbrella. “Sherlock…”
Sherlock joined her brother and his partner and left the ward. She paused only to thank the nurse, knowing that this woman was a tangible connection between her and John, and that if anyone deserved thanks, it was the nurse. Though it was a risk, Sherlock took it.
“I don’t care!” Sherlock stabbed her screen with force, “I don’t care. Just, let me have some peace. The only place that matters is my mind palace, and you’ve disrupted its orderliness for the seventh time in this ride alone.”
Silently, he took a set of keys out of his pocket. The locks at Baker Street had all been changed, though John knew he would be checking every window and and lock himself. “Do try not to destroy the stove this time. The restoration expert had to be brought around with smelling salts and a considerable bonus.”
“That’s pretty sad.” John murmured, wondering how long this conversation would go on, “I hope she finds somebody.”
Sherlock’s hand slid into his own as Nan turned to fix the tea. John wondered if he was shaking. The last time he had come here, stood in this house was before he’d met Sherlock. Upon his release from rehab, Clara and Harry had hauled him up here for a long weekend of feeding up. It had gone just spectacularly.
John was, in every possible way, doing well. Harry was sober, functional. His career was taking off in leaps and bounds. He was happy. His career was finally stabilizing, and he was engaging in more overt work. He was up for promotion, as well. Sherlock could deduce that easily. Mycroft had cut off her reports at Christmas, not that they ever told her much. She had to rely on deduction for anything worthwhile.
Once back in the corridor, Sherlock found that the water on her hands refused to dry. Holmeses did not perspire. To suggest that her palms were slick or that her knees were knocking was the height of absurdity. It was the shoddy atmospheric conditions in this building, which was probably overpacked with gawking tourists bent on conspiracy theories that had no basis in rational truth.
John tried not to notice the CCTV camera that was pointed their way in the unseasonably warm spring night. He gave a jaunty little wave when Sarah’s gaze was elsewhere, and covered the gesture by offering Sarah an napkin. He and Sarah were standing in the glow of the shop, tearing into messy chocolate covered waffles having an actual conversation when John remembered to reply. He was already uncomfortably full, as there was no one sticking her own fork into his portion.
She accepted the truth in his words as John hobbled out to the parked car, refusing to allow her to pull up to the door like he was some kind of poor sod who couldn’t even leave this place under his own power. “I know it’s not about me, but I’m uncomfortable with the idea of you being so alone in London.”
“Are you telling me that Sherlock is
Sherlock Holmes hadn’t seen John Watson since his deployment date. It burned into her mind. She had read military briefings, received occasional images, watched a great deal of news. That was, until October, wherein she had stopped that arm of her research as abruptly as possible. It was an issue of safety.
He took it off and balled it up in his bag before he reached the end of the block. He was content to leave the sharp dressing to Sherlock, as he had neither her legs nor her gravitas.
Mummy and MacPherson made their way into the parlor, and John considered calling him back to him as the pair ahead of him disappeared into the parlor. The dog was either with him or with Sherlock, universally. She did not let her Network watch him, and she refused to hire out so much as a dog walker. Rather than risk his head, John followed along, wondering where Sherlock had loped off to that she had not taken MacPherson.
John was a bit shocked, and didn’t know how to respond. He was not a well-known figure, preferring to keep his reputation confined to the work he did within his service to his country. He was certain he’d never muddied the waters in Germany, but then again, she was the de facto leader of Europe and he’d had a scrape or two in his time.
Sherlock did not let on that she knew that someone was dying, somewhere in this vast complex. John was functionally atheistic, but he believed in things like goodness, like meaning, like hope and kindness, mercy and compassion. She thought about what she should say in this moment, and tried her best to smile, “Take as long as you need, please.”
“I am the world’s only consulting detective.” Sherlock announced, her bright eyes flitting over him, “You are from Scotland originally, extended family near Inverness. You were in the Army, your captaincy was a cover for something. Much of your work is classified. You hide behind jumpers and charm. Sometimes you wonder if you’re gay, but you lean towards women. There is something called bisexuality, John. You’re a doctor. Sexuality is not rigid. You’re left handed, but you can use weapons with your right. You favor football, and cricket, but you play rugby. You want a dog, and two, no, three children.”
John noted the glint in her eyes. She probably meant it. Most people did, in that rote sort of way. It was polite to say, but John really wondered if it was polite to talk about death, and death, and suffering, and loss. Then again, she likely had some romantic view of war, unsecured by reality. No, he realized, she was testing his mettle. She wasn’t saying anything mindlessly. She had a point, an intention. This woman was intent on observing his reactions, intent on emotionally manipulating him, reminding him of who and what he had used to be. He wasn’t up for a witty game.
“Mycroft has nothing to do with this, Victor.” John interrupted, “Sherlock and I covered for you, and there’s nothing Mycroft has ever done but open his home to you.”
Having got the part of the appointment that Laura most valued, they spent another hour discussing her test results, checking into progress Laura was making with various social service agencies that were helping Laura during her pregnancy, and so on. By the time she left, John was badly in need of five minutes to himself.
Sherlock clicked away on her phone. “You’re short, the bed should be suitable, for a man such as yourself.”
“That’s fine.” John stressed. It wasn’t ideal, but he hadn’t worked A&E in years, at least not civilian.
“He’s going to be fine, Sherlock.” John assured her, a new scent filling his ears over the bleach that had overwhelmed him, even with the open windows, “You don’t need to spray the flat down in bleach and lemon cleaner to insure MacPherson will be well.”
John, for his part, even got to the point that he came to await the Prince of Wales’s exits, just so he had cause to salute or present arms. Unlike most, he hadn’t ever intended to be a ceremonial guard. He wanted to be on the front, somewhere he could actually use his medical training and his skills as a solider to do his bit. But according to Ella, the army shrink they had him seeing, being part of the ceremonial guard for a time would help him transition back to civi life. It was a great honor, and it was also a way to help him understand what he really was a soldier. Or so they said, not that John agreed. An honorable discharge after his injuries would have been merciful. Ella insisted that would have been to his detriment.
Molly giggled in the background. Of course, Sherlock berated her for it. At that, John left the room. She’d get her phone back when she got it back. If a text came, well, she’d just have to wait until he’d gotten back.
However, when Lestrade called her from Mycroft’s personal cell number, something told her to excuse herself from the rehearsal and take the call. It was not as if she needed all of these rehearsals and refreshers for their own sake, and there was only so much data one could collect about young women in social settings in one evening at a dinner amidst their obligatory rehearsals.
“Oh, John…” Sherlock smiled that smile, the crooked, endearing one, one only he ever saw as she clicked away on her iPhone. “What makes you think I hadn’t already said hello?”
And there, he found the message that allowed him to settle and face his injuries. Whoever it was, well, she would be back, to end him or save him, he knew not. In the end, perhaps a death from an assassin with a penchant for romance and devotion would be the best thing coming his way.
“We don’t need money.” Sherlock blinked, standing in the doorway, “Actually, I do. I find myself in need of some items, and my credit card isn’t in my wallet. Do see if you can find it. Or leave yours out, it hardly matters.” Sherlock tucked her phone in her back pocket, “You ought to come shopping, Sarah. It’s dull. You’d enjoy it.”
John pulled out the menus they kept behind Billy for easy access, “Thai, Indian, or Chinese?”
John spent the evenings in the soft lamplight of the farm kitchen cooking meals Sherlock actually ate. MacPherson joined him trampling through the fields and skittered after the girls and barked at the goats. Chowley was given new life with a buddy to acclimate to the farm.
John slammed the button in his box, and rushed to the man’s aid. This wasn’t a drunken stagger.  When he got there, he saw that it was Sherlock. His aristocratic body was curled around a wound that was pouring blood. “Fucking hell, Sherlock, fucking hell.”  John knelt down, and quickly assessed the situation. Airway was fine, pulse was a little erratic. He was losing blood, but he’d survive the trip to A&E. John wasn’t doing surgery here, but he could if he needed to do so.
Sherlock thought of a long speech that burned on the tip of her tongue. She wanted to snap, “I have the backing of no less than five governments to stand in this spot. My father is interested in advocacy and charity, not very political true, but my older brother, well, we call him The British Government. They call him The Ice Man in America, but then you are prone to drama as a people. We Brits, on the other hand, mean what we say. Your President Obama plays golf with my father and my brother. My mother is a mathematical genius, friends, you may be told with the German Chancellor. Now.” Sherlock fantasized about snarling, “Would you care to spark an international incident? Or would you like to check again?”
“A case?” John ventured. He could probably still call Sarah. She would expect it by now. He’d only done it five times. This month.
“You were so sick, at Christmas.” Greg clearly was putting things together in a way he never had done before, and it was enough to profoundly shake him. He looked to John, “We were beside ourselves.”
John nearly dropped the paperback book he was holding, books that had almost instantly grabbed his attention. These few books were clearly well loved books covering several genres, science fiction, technology, classic literature. John was dying for some escapist literature. These had clearly been taken care of, though there were no names inscribed in the front, much to John’s disappointment. “What?”
When John blinked, she was gone, in a swirl of dress. John knew it would haunt his dreams, if he slept.
They decided to go for a pint, and James’s phone began to blow up about halfway through their first round. He simply chuckled, apologized to John for attending to his phone, and fired off a quick message before setting his phone face down on the polished wooden table. “I apologize. My sister is a bit possessive of what she loves, and consequently considers them off limits to anyone else.”
John affirmed that he did, and watched as it moved pointedly.
“What a ringing endorsement.” John muttered.
Before he could express surprise she noted, “I went to boarding school, John. My roommates were horribly attached to a sleep schedule. I can do everything in the dark except my hair.”
“Skulking about the barracks?” John asked, throwing his voice behind a hunch that was unfurling in his belly, “Oh, wait. Wrong Holmes, wasn’t it?”
John shoved a hand through his hair, “I just put some chicken in the oven. Do you want to stay?”
“We’ll find him a good home.” John offered, knowing full well that finding such a mutt a home Sherlock considered worthy would be hard. He wondered if Mycroft and Lestrade, now that they were married, would like a pet to begin their family. After all, pets were a good way to begin building a family with someone. She could visit and manage his care, and surely she would agree that Lestrade was capable. After all, he’d had some hand in raising her.
.. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- --- ..-
The dog lumbered away to his bed in the living room, and stared forlornly at the objects of his affection as John replied, “Whatever you think I need to know is what I need to know, Sherlock.”
His voice was careful, tutored. His sister had a faint accent. He did not. This spoke volumes. He had worked hard upon his entry to the Army to sound like Joe Bloggs, and in doing so, he had discovered a talent for languages. Sherlock knew that one day, there would be a moment in time that he cared only for truth with a depth that she would hear his real voice, and not the one shared with the world, even if accents as a general rule did strike her as inefficient. Gavin said she had an accent herself, though that was absurd, because she had never once discerned it for herself.
“If you refer, Dr. Marshall, to my single meeting with Dr. Norwood regarding observations I made—” The man went to interrupt her again, and Sherlock’s eyes blazed as she continued, “I swore to uphold the dignity of human life when I took this post! Is that lip service, or would you have had me look the other way when a man decorated by no less than four governments at the highest levels put a knife in a light socket because idiots on your staff were blazing failures?”
“You’re more ridiculous than Mycroft.” John retorted as he headed towards the dining room, following the sound of Sherlock admonishing her father for overfeeding MacPherson.
Sherlock inclined her chin in scolding, and informed him, “He stole my work, and I am going to get it back, John. In order to do that, I need for him to not see me as a threat to his credibility. I cannot arouse his suspicions.”
He’d known from the moment he’d met John Watson their first week together at Sandhurst's brush-up, very low-key, course for officers that John mind was uniquely perceptive and empathetic in a way that matched Willa's own depth, and, well, what was manipulating his brother a little bit in the face of her happiness? So, he’d dropped a few hints, and laid some tracks, thinking that, perhaps, for once, he’d been wrong. Given time, he’d known that he hadn’t been wrong about John Watson. Five years ago, he’d begun to test a theory. Predictably, Mycroft had followed the trail he’d begun.
John looked over his bags, knowing his toad in the hole was a lost cause. The doorman pushed a buzzer and two men appeared. One took his bags, his face impassive. John saw a flicker of judgement on his face, though he didn’t bat an eyelash. John guessed he didn’t buy frozen food, nor anything that said ‘by Sainsbury’s’ on the label.
“Pity.” The man retorted, setting the picture down, “I’d thought they’d be half the fun with her. As you see, Dr. Watson, I am capable of questioning my own assumptions.”
Lestrade followed Sherlock’s lead, and kept this professional, though John knew that the man who had taught Sherlock to fire a gun and ride the Tube was breaking inside. He could see it in the way Greg was clenching his pen, the way his body was rigid in his chair.  “Did he say anything to you then?”
Chaplain Parker did reveal something of note to John, something that stayed in his brain despite the drugs, pain, and exhaustion. “I came back to check on her, but when I heard her speaking so softly to you…I didn’t want to intrude.”
He wasn’t the person he once had been. He wasn’t the dutiful son. He wasn’t suffering in silence anymore. He wasn’t hauling his drunk sister out of the barn before she burned it down. And yet, every time he went home, it was as though every one of his self-doubts rose again to haunt him. There, on the farm, he was enough. It was enough for him, but he had never been enough for it.
“Entirely.” Sherlock turned right, and John saw why she had flung herself out of the government issue vehicle. “We’re here.”
John did not see the point of tramping about the countryside in packs of jacketed, booted, men. He had understood as it a solider, but he understood it not at all as a civilian. It seemed these men enjoyed feats of manliness, which included shooting at defenseless animals and boasting of their closeness to said creatures. John knew that there wasn’t enough coffee in the world to chase away the chill that had enveloped him after extricating himself from Sherlock’s embrace.
The Sat Nav guided them along the journey, the electronic female’s cheery voice John’s only company save the occasional noise and interested movement from the backseat that John took as an invitation for conversation with the dog. MacPherson was the better conversationalist of the two of them, but John was a doctor, and that meant being able to talk about anything and nothing.
John got the words out before his resolve failed, knowing that if he didn’t do something to alter the course of events, they'd end up back where they’d started. “We have to talk.”
“I assume you have done since last Friday.” John replied, knowing full well that there had been the span of days since they’d left London. There had been little to do here but think. John had seen the upsides of it in some respects, but now he questioned himself.
She moved away, and within a few moments of her exit, Sherlock came out in the blue-purple silk dress, and stood in the doorway, “This is sufficient. God, tea at the Landmark. Tedious. You’re writing the thank you notes.”
MacPherson padded along beside Sherlock as they headed out onto the pavement. She stood at the boot, deducing the space available to them. Ignoring the throb of his foot, John lugged the cases and set them in an impressive pile. The customers at Speedy’s were staring, and John didn’t need to be a highly trained soldier to know that the photos they were taking would soon end up on Twitter.
“Oh would you both—” Sherlock’s phone began to buzz, and she looked at it carefully before tilting the screen towards John before answering. It was Victor, calling again as he had done several times a day in the last several days.
“Greg.” Greg stressed, “You’ve only known my name since you were bloody ten, Sherlock.”
John dug into his peas. He didn’t think he had changed all that much. Sure, the nightmares were better and the limp was gone, and he no longer thought about eating his gun, but he was still John Hamish Watson. He still was addicted to danger, was at the top of his game, was still a bloody good doctor and soldier.
“Er, so you lost your dog, yeah?” Evie was a nice person, for all that she had once shoved worms down Harry’s dress. All told, Harry had deserved that, and more still.
John heard Nan reply as he got a glass out from the glass-fronted cupboards. “No.”
He talked.
“I really...” John tried, as Waller led him expertly through the crowds. They were heading towards the Palace. John forced himself not to stop. He’d gone into hostile territory before, this was nothing new. He had no one at his six, but that had never stopped before. Sweat beaded at his brow, and it had nothing to do with the heat. Likely, his body was trying to battle the cold chill zinging down his spine.
The room was dizzying in its detail. He had long ago been trained to walk into someone’s room, someone’s space, and read in it a single second. And yet, he could pick out few things that stood out to him as he returned to her room that stood out as particularly telling. Everything seemed to point back to the woman she was, rather than highlighting some facet about her.
The young man sucked in air, “The Lady!” He pushed out, “She’s...she’s...”
“How can they possibly be, if you neglect the very basic knowledge of cleaning from top to bottom?” Sherlock returned, “It is not that difficult! Have you never heard of gravity? No?”
John was going to interrupt her as he opened his laptop and began to set up an illegal tap on Sherlock’s cell phone. Then, however, she stopped. No further sound came out of her mouth as she she sank into a chair, and retreated to her mind palace. He knew he was seeing Vienna all over again. Something inside John shifted. He knew he should have killed Mr. Macon when he’d had the chance.
John was absolutely gutted that she considered that night to be the worst of her life. He could not imagine what it had been like for her, not one little bit. Somehow, he pictured her sitting at his bedside, rattling off facts that would impress upon him that he had no choice but to survive. “I’d like to hear about it. Right now, though…”
“A good home, with people who love him.” John corrected, meeting her raised chin with a firm tone.
Just as the Man in the Belstaff was winding down, another man, with silvered hair came along, “Sherlock! Leave the poor bloke alone. He’s only listening because he can’t get away.” He bustled up to Sherlock, and looked at John,  “Jesus, mate. I’m so sorry. Bloody Holmeses think the entire military is at their beck and call. Jesus Christ.”
By midmorning, Sherlock had tugged on her cherished wellies and begun to make notes on the various animals. There wasn’t that much work to be done these days as the small farm was bare bones in that the only animals left were the ones Nan couldn’t bear to sell off, but John manufactured excuses to stay in the barn and outside to avoid going into the house.
He had tourists out his bearskin, and he couldn’t do a thing about it, so thinking about the thinly veiled comments he might make about them on his blog was his way. Some Grenadiers thought about women, some counted sheep in their head. Some just fucking stared at point until their eyes crossed and they could take 15 steps again.
Sherlock ran through her projections very quickly. Every single outcome was laden with risk she was not prepared to take. But no. John needed her. He needed her. She needed to know that he was safe.
Greg’s grip on his glass changed. “John, are you sure? What I’m about to tell you…”
“Sir, the parties are gathering this way, if you’d be so kind as to follow me.” Waller spoke, a tone that was all that was polite. John saw, though, that he was being told to do just as Waller demanded.
The Japanese tourists laughed. John just dared that grown man to climb the fence.
John snuck a look towards his bearskin. This American tourist who was plastering herself to his side wasn’t doing anything but making him want to twitch. John fleetingly wondered if diagnosing her halitosis was worth his post.
Though Mycroft had been called away urgently, the camera tracked his movement to the end of the block.
She drew in a heaving breathing, attached her head to an invisible string and drew herself into effortless posture. Just like that, the vulnerable woman who had been shaking in his arms not five minutes ago was gone, leaving behind a self-assured facade in its place. She clicked a few buttons on her phone, and looked to Greg for a long moment.
Glancing at his watch, John knew that he had to get home, too, if he was to be seated on his lumpy, bumpy, secondhand sofa in time for the phone to ring with Nan on the line. John reached for his cane and came to his feet before they settled their tab and headed out onto the pavement. James offered him a ride, but John didn’t really want anyone seeing his drab bedsit building.
He also knew that he was quite connected with a man named James Armitage, who was wanted for several violent crimes, drug-dealing, and being a general piece of garbage. He had no doubt that this James was Victor’s drug dealer, among other things. James was a bit of a ghost in the way that spoke to people being in his pocket, and John had decided to run several things by people he knew. He still had informants, contacts, as it were, that had nothing to do with Sherlock’s Network, but who were just as reliable in their own way. If James existed anywhere, they’d find him.
Continue onward if you like domestic, AU, fluff, cases, etc. etc. etc. There will be a sequel. Probably like, tomorrow, or the next day. I'll link it HERE when I name it.
“Sherlock stayed on base at Rammstein until you went to Birmingham.” Greg told him, draining the last of his beer, “Naturally, she followed you to Birmingham until you followed her to London.”
Nan grinned as John returned to his seat, “Well, what?”
By the time John fruitlessly searched his memories of New York, they were back at Baker Street. It was getting on to six in the morning. Soon Mrs. Hudson would poke her head upstairs with an mandatory invitation to a post-case fry up, and soon Molly would bring MacPherson home where he belonged. But for now, he was faced with the monumental task of going in there and looking at their flat like everything about it hadn’t changed since he’d rushed inside to find acid boiling on the cooker.
“You see, but you do not observe, John.” Sherlock’s gaze softened as she chided him, “Send Carter home.”
John didn’t know what he was supposed to do, so he simply let the aforementioned Marsh take his measure. The horse was a beauty, glossy and ethereal. However, John saw a vulnerability in his eyes, and simply stood there, preferring to allow the horse to make the choice in their interaction.
Sherlock grinned, “I have yet to ascertain if they’re here, but if he was foolish enough to bring them, getting them back will be a simple matter.”
“So it’s only fair I suffer through the hell that is shopping with you.” John mumbled as Sherlock deduced a dress and found it lacking, “What about that gold one you got last week?”
Sherlock knew that his injuries were significant if those overseeing his care decided to call upon Americans to provide him care until he was stable enough to go back to the UK. The time between this place in Germany and UK soil was small, but meaningful. It could mean his life. John would not want to die anywhere but her arms. He did not know this in his waking mind, but she was the world’s foremost expert in deduction, and she knew it enough for both of them.
Sherlock found his reaction impossible to handle or comprehend. She sought out the John in her mind who focused on espionage. He had been a near constant companion during her time as a debutante, for the undertakings were similar. This John sparked something within her, so that by the time the plane landed, Sherlock had one plan. She was going to get to John, and keep him alive, no matter what it took.
“I just watch ‘em.” The man with undiagnosed Type II diabetes blubbered, “You’re angry at Michael. I just watch the animals a bit on the trips.”
She didn’t move, but John saw that she had a camping lantern resting in her lap, clearly borrowed from one of her many admirers. “Are you hurt?”
As Sherlock had predicted, it was barely a four, and they were expected to leave with Lestrade to head to his home in order to participate in the hellish ritual known as a Holmes family dinner. John did his best not to think of the Holmes’ parents as Mummy and Father, but seeing as even they called themselves Mummy and Father, the names had become something of forenames in John’s mind.
“I know. Mum was so proud, Johnny.” His sister replied, her voice echoing Inverness in a way that John’s own cadence had long left behind. Sherlock watched the way John shifted his weight. He was not ashamed of his service, but he was…regretful…that…ah, his mother…regretful that it distanced him from memories of his mother. “John, I’m sorry.”
And so, she simply spoke. She recited poetry, Burns and Pound, Cummings and Bradstreet. She knew as well as anyone that brain activity in sedated patients changed when someone talked to them, spoke to them of things they enjoyed. She knew nothing about rugby, but she played a passable game of Cluedo, so she set up a board in her head and deduced John’s moves. She hummed, songs she’d deduced years ago were the sort of song that made him dance around in his absurd way. She swore she wouldn’t complain if he hated Liszt and Mahler, if only he would wake up and tell her the words to songs she’d deleted.
John’s gaze flew to Mycroft’s in a single instant. “You have no right to MacPherson, Mycroft. Do you really want to attempt to remove him from Baker Street?”
“I owe you one.” She admitted, and John heard her clicking away at her computer. “What do you need to know?”
“You’re a bit overqualified...” Sarah shifted, and John wished he had left his PhD off the bloody CV. And maybe a few of the fellowships. He had just been glad to be doing something that wasn’t classified, that literally helped people, that he’d been honest.
“Yeah, well I blew it again.” John muttered, digging for the flask of tea tucked in the basket. “I’m not sure Sarah’ll want to go out with me again.”
It was clear to John that Sherlock wanted a word, and, though she would never admit it, a moment to collect herself.  John opened the door to find MacPherson sitting by the doorway, barely allowing Mycroft out before he pranced inward, as though he were walking on air. MacPherson made no bones about putting his front paws on Mycroft’s settee, and allowing Sherlock to bury her hand in his coat as she petted him. He was always quick to comfort them. Poor MacPherson knew what it was to be sad.
John eyed her skeptically. “If you go and try to kill yourself to avoid dealing with your apartment being searched, I’m dumping you at the A&E.”
“There you are!” She smiled, her voice sounding faintly of…somewhere else. Damn, he was down for the count, “Remember, you’re in the hospital, Dr. Watson. They’ve stabilized a few of your fractures, and we’ll have you shipped off to the UK in a snap.”
Sherlock’s eyes danced with merriment. “He deduced you, John. Naturally I made the deduction first.”
John laughed outright, liking the idea that staid James, unflappable James, had a sister devoted to pyrotechnics. “What did you do, mate, use her toaster and leave it on the wrong setting?”
John took his measure in an instant and knew him to be a snake. He was sorry to insult the species with the comparison, in truth. His pale grip on Sherlock’s waist and hand, though decorous, made John want to rip off his hands. Someone so without honor, without basic human decency, shouldn't even be allowed within miles of her. It was, however, not his choice to make.
John looked around, instantly considering the whys and hows and wheres and whats. He felt as though he was balanced on the edge of a knife, and it felt almost like Sherlock was beside him, quirking her expressive eyebrows and laughing, “The game, John, is afoot!”
.. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- --- ..-
John was putting milk in Molly’s coffee at the hospital canteen when he heard a voice call out, “Watson! Is that you, then?”
“John.” Sherlock’s sharp gaze, though soft, missed nothing in his face, accepted his truth for what it was and nothing more, “There are things you should know before you declare yourself. There are things between us. It does not behoove you to be…spontaneous, no matter how genuine you are being.”
John knew flirting when he saw it, heard it. “You’re welcome to try.”
“Mycroft is always absurd.” Sherlock insisted, “Mummy’s no better. Why must you do this to me?”
Sherlock submitted far too willingly to their detainment. Clearly, her protest had been for their observers. John yanked Greg close when he cuffed him, “Check for cameras around the body. Say nothing if you find them.”
.--. .-.. . .- ... . / .-- .- -.- . / ..- .--.
“Fuck.” Sherlock hissed, “Who called Piecryoft?”
Mummy ushered him into tea, and they had only just sat down to making banal chatter when John rose anew at the tap of feminine heels that were known to him as the Jaws theme was known to boaters. Anthea swanned into the room, took one glance at John, and arched an eyebrow before clicking away at her phone. John groaned inwardly as he offered her a greeting, knowing that where Anthea was lurking, Mycroft would soon appear.
John must have made some sound that clarified his thoughts, because she was rushing to tell him that he had been shot, that according to what she had been told, his actions had saved lives. John didn’t know if he believed her. People always said that, and so he tried to breathe through panic.
The question was answered within moments, as he heard shouting from Mycroft’s study. “You will leave John entirely out of your deranged thoughts!” Sherlock yelled, her tones clipped and forceful, “The only reason you should bring this up to him is if you want him to evaluate you for insanity brought on by gluttony!”
“Mike...” John took one look at those earnest eyes, and capitulated. “I can’t make a promise. I can’t.”
There was movement around them as the apartment was flooded with officers. John dropped his backup, and moved across the floor, stepping carefully across notes and theories to meet Sherlock, who had flipped off the cooker and launched herself gracefully away from Victor’s corpse, as the scent of burning flesh filled Baker Street.
He and MacPherson stood in the entry of Mycroft’s home when Mummy came bustling into the room, “Ah, John! How lovely to see you! And MacPherson!” She moved closer to them and paid a hearty greeting to the dog, who absolutely loved Mummy. After MacPherson was worked up to a suitable jolly wag and wiggle, Mummy finally looked to John, “You just leave him with me, won’t you? Go and fix yourself a drink should you want it.”
She’d kept Mum’s things, and cried like a little girl needing comfort, never once asking her own goddamned brother what he felt as their mother was lowered into the ground. He’d learned Hamish’s words, screamed at the top of his voice, well. Watsons don’t cry, and they don’t ask why. Harry had never been there for him, not when it counted.
John’s jaw unhinged. “You’re cleaning?
“I’m sorry, ma’am…” The woman’s gaze softened when she made assumptions about their connection. Sherlock cared not for her sympathy. She wanted her efficiency. “I am not authorized to let anyone onto the wards. You’re not in any access record I can locate, ma’am. Did you arrange your visit with the base?”
Mr. Macon himself was a ghost, for John’s searches had yielded almost nothing. He had a former friend with benefits at the CIA doing a bit of off the record checking.
John read the text that popped up on his phone.
“I don’t remember. Did I talk to a woman?” John asked, “It seems that you would know.”
“That’s why you went to New York.” John stated, knowing full well that her terror had driven her to seek out new data. What Greg did not know was that, two years ago, he had been in New York for a time. Officially, he had been there representing Army Medical staff to talk about needed drugs and medical systems in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had spent a week in the New Year at the UN with a tidy cover.
“My flat is...” Sherlock began to backpedal.
“Oh, and you’re supposed to be chemist!” Sherlock declared, picking up her handbag and stomping out of the bathroom.
John went in for the kill. “Why don’t you spend some of Mycroft’s ill gotten gains and splash out on something with running water, heat, and locking windows?”
“I’m a doctor.” John attempted to warn her off.
John didn’t really want to make conversation with anyone else who came by his post. After another fifteen minutes, it was clear that the point of his being here wasn’t going to be found in this room. John wasn’t a sitting duck, even if he was lame.
Thanks for reading. I like reviews, and love talking to people about anything fanfic.
Warning: Sherlock discusses Victor's assault, which includes drugging her. Mind your triggers, and if you need to, go ahead and search for "They sat in silence for a long moment" and you'll be past her discussion of his drugging her into a stupor.
“John did not budget his time well.” Sherlock returned, “I suppose he finds value in fastidiously cleaning his dentition before spending time in your company.”
He knew she would likely be back before the dog could eat, as he could not eat for four hours. It simply was important to issue any instructions she felt pertinent, though he felt it something a vote of confidence that she didn’t tell him how to pack the dog’s suitcase.
John did like Earl Grey, and free tea was free tea, even if it did come in absurd bone china. John sat, then, hauling a simple wooden chair over from the table to face his contemporary. He wasn’t going to give this man a chance to get between him and the door. “You and I have nothing in common.”
There were whisperings of a promotion. John wasn’t sure how he felt about it, but he knew he was in a good place for his career. He was balancing his more clandestine work with boots on the ground efforts in Afghanistan. He knew he was doing good there, and it was there that he hoped to stay. If they were still in Afghanistan when he had the choice, he would elect to remain there.
She put her phone in the pocket in her primly knotted Belstaff coat, “I am afraid John will be the arrested party tonight.”
John did not reply. He wanted information, not what he could see and discern. He could see that the sky was a cloudless blue as they made their way towards a door, and the summer heat was moderate, but insistent, the sun shining and glinting off his jacket like a sniper’s scope.
John resolved to investigate those flowers a bit more. They’d already had the dubious pleasure of decontamination showers before being given clothes from their wardrobes here at Baker Street. John had popped Sherlock’s shoulder back into place, taped her ribs, treated her bruises, and assured himself that her health was not, at least presently, further compromised.
John again cut through the bullshit, because really, this was more than anyone should be expected to endure. He figured they could have Victor in prison for murder within the hour if he would just get done with the meaningless rants and confess. “The reason she hates him, Sherlock, is because he’s a piece of shit, and everyone knows it.”
“Excuse me?” He turned from his paperwork to face her. To equalize the discussion as one of peers, Sherlock made a point to take the other chair, “Who are you?”
“Right then.” Pete blurted, coming up the steps. “Somebody call 999.”
empathetic and deeply, confusingly, emotive. They would get on well. They were chatting when a clinic nurse knocked apologetically.
The whole place had been repainted, the stove replaced, the flooring repaired. There was nothing to suggest that anything had gone awry, at any point. Their things were perfectly placed in their haphazard fashion on the table. The only clues that someone had been here were the awareness that the flat was spotlessly clean and the bouquet in the vase on the counter.
Sherlock made an approving sound.
John folded the paper and stuck it in his billfold. Maybe it was a map of sorts to that world, and maybe, one day, he’d find it, map in hand and eyes wide shut. John sighed. He was so fucking tired he was deluded. Jesus Christ, he probably had a concussion with the direction of his thoughts.
“I was raised around too many posh gits with mush for brains.” Mummy broke in, “And so I decided from a very early age that I would do with my children as Nanny had done with me, and raise self-sustaining people. I have never regretted it for a moment.”
Sherlock looked at him as though she could see the flesh melting from his bones. “Why would you assume he’ll do something you’ve already done? MacPherson is well aware of crime scene behavior, which is not something I can say for your team, despite MacPherson’s exacting example since his arrival.”
John could just see Mycroft cleaning Nan’s drafty stone farmhouse. “Nan, you’re evil.”
Outside, thunder boomed. The dog whimpered. Sherlock made a soft sound, one that tore into John like nothing else.
“Sorry I’m late, Doc.” Laura hefted a heavy cloth purse along with her as she boosted herself onto the exam table in a practiced fashion, “With them doing all that with the horses and what, getting here was a right pain.”
There will be more, but this ending is for those who would prefer to get off the train at this juncture.
It took John a minute to remember whereabouts he had been in that year in the autumn. He thought it the time he’d spent dashing around Iraq and Afghanistan on clandestine operations, sometimes sewing people up, sometimes doing the exact opposite.
Harry was his twin. She knew. She knew. John didn’t really have the words. “John, I’m sorry.”
Sherlock looked at him as though he was ant on her shoes. “My flat provides anonymity.”
“And you have yet to offer your name.” John observed, “Didn’t your dons bother to mention that point of social convention?”
Sherlock swallowed and continued petting MacPherson, who growled low in his throat at the sound of Victor’s smooth, plummy, voice. He was protecting his mummy, it seemed, though her concern was for him more than anything.
If John had been worried about MacPherson’s intrusion on the Work, he needn’t have done. As Sherlock would have said, focusing on the projections without data to back them up was a waste of time and the average person’s severely limited mental capacity. Sherlock solved cases in the dog park, and at the agility course facility, where she spent some mornings. As she had begun when he was hospital, she continued to train MacPherson to fetch things, including the household blogger, and taught him a slew of commands and began to integrate him into the Work without missing a beat.
“Dears!” A voice broke into John’s thoughts behind his dozing eyes, “I’ve only just heard from Mycroft. I’ve brought nibbles and dry clothes.”
When John expressed surprise at her talents with fabric and fibers, Sherlock snapped, “How many times do I have to ask you not to express shock at some evidence of my gender when it is stereotypically expressed?”
“Mate,” Murray was already biting into his third biscuit. John resisted the urge to wrestle the tin away, “A bird put that package together, and nothing says ‘I want to be Mrs. Dr. Watson’ like managing to get fresh biscuits to Helmand province.”
“I don’t want to fuck anything up for Sherlock.” Greg blinked steadily back at John, and John understood the glaringly obvious subtext easily. “You think you know, but you cannot possibly imagine how much she loves you. It would break you.”
John thanked her. He was not a little bit relieved to find that his credit card hadn’t been charged for the ergonomic bed Sherlock had been evaluating. She’d mused buying two, one for testing and another for use, if and only if her analysis proved it the ideal bed for a canine with orthopedic special needs. It had, however, been used to order a tweed dog coat from Mycroft’s tailor. John hoped Mycroft would take care of the tab, otherwise, they’d be eating beans for two weeks.
? I want him to come back from your sex holiday and give me cases. Dimmock is useless.”
Next to him on the sofa, he heard a small sigh, and the television flashed as Sarah pushed pause. John couldn’t recall what they had been watching. The woman’s expression on the telly suggested she had been right in the middle of something hectic, though. He’d not seen a movie in months, and had no idea of who the actress even was, though Sherlock did occasionally binge reality TV.
Sherlock sat effortlessly down on the chair John had refused and thumbed her phone.
“Mycroft Holmes is not a nice lad.” Sherlock disagreed, her tone chiding and shocked, “He’s the face of everything wrong in the United Kingdom, including the fact that nobody makes decent wellies anymore.”
John knew that if he had taken care not to hurt her physically, he had not been so careful with her emotions in the time they had been living together. He needed to apologize. “Sherlock. Don’t romanticize me. I have hurt you, been incredibly blind to your feelings, and—”
“What’s he got now?” Lucy tried to peer down onto John’s horrible, old, mobile phone. It was Harry’s cast-off. Good God, would she ever stop? It appeared Lucy would need to have words with Nana again about this phone thing. They needed to get the man an iPhone for Christmas.
Before Sherlock seemed like a lifetime ago.
That was something, right? The sound of that voice, however, stayed with John. He forgot its cadence, its intonation, but he did not forget the way the possibility of having someone there to miss him made him feel, even if it was only fantasy to make up for a lack of letters from anyone else but Nan and Gramps.
All night, they chased a down cabby and ran through London. John wondered how ever lived a second without her. They’d slept on a stakeout, having gone from the lab to Lestrade’s office because Sherlock was sure they were looking for a cabby. Sherlock had insisted that the cabby would come to them, but that she needed to lay in wait.
John was content to watch the people, but they weren’t content to observe him, for several people went of their way to be genial. A comfortable looking woman in a pastel suit ended up standing next to him, “Oh, hello.”
It was in light of this truth that Mycroft began to speak, “They believe he has every possible chance of survival. There will be nerve damage. He will never hold a scalpel again.”
John absolutely did not allow himself to think about the fact that Sherlock had just discussed her birth control and had plainly stated that she had a high probability of needing it for pregnancy prevention. Instead, he did the supportive and sensible thing, and put a pair of painkillers and a glass of water on her dresser.
John stepped aside, and let her into the space by the wide window. “You’re also addicted to your mobile.”
“Dr. Watson, I do hope you are well.” A voice spoke from behind him, cultured tones that John knew had been many a man’s last memory. The door latched behind her with nary a whisper.
“Come on, mate.” John sat up again, his leg stuck under the weight of the dog, “You’ve got your moose, and your bed, and your blankets.”
“I trust we’re done, here.” Sherlock continued petting MacPherson. He was no doubt trembling beneath his wavy hair. John could see his eyes, wide with determination that the monster that scared him so would not hurt Sherlock. He was a brave lad, he really was.
“Oh, someone stopped me, told me you’d want PG Tips and lemon biscuits.” She smiled, “It’s all taken care of, with their thanks for your service.”
John was being released today, though he knew the correct term was discharged.
“No, he just talks.” Pete allowed, “Tells you about yourself. Every scathing detail. He knew my mum had an affair. He knew my Gran…" Pete summarized, "He talks and then he never comes back.”
“Are you looking for a flat share?” Mike perked up.
“I suppose I’ll get used to standing in the way of science, yeah?” John spat out his toothpaste.
Following him continually for the fourth day in a row.
Hampton nodded off into the road, “No need.”
“Perhaps it’s missing the tinge of mold and connective tissue.” Mycroft remarked.
“Be nice to your brother.” John admonished, pushing dark curls away from an ashen face, “Doctor’s orders.”
“No.” John internally shuddered at the nuclear warfare Sherlock would rain down if someone suggested she do so, “Spend his money. On something he’d fine dull, or something.”
He questioned it as he sucked it in and stood at attention.
Sherlock understood at once that in addition to this being the present she could not find in the flat, this was a chance to get MacPherson out of London until Mr. Macon played his hand. They’d had another bomb threat just six weeks ago. “Thank you, John.”
, John thought. He couldn’t say that, though. He would never say that.
Janet nodded. John thought she suspected that he, too, had been around the block a few times. “We deal with a frustrating lack of supplies, a continual lack of communal support, long hours, low pay, and frustratingly little to show for our efforts.” Janet confirmed, “So, are you in for a two week trial?”
“She got me a new psychologist the day I’d decided to end it, and had the means to do it.” John told him, knowing that the time for secrets was past. “I’d written the note, everything. That same day, they hauled me down to the psych’s office, and I was given some vague explanation that I was now working with Dr. Phillips.”
Mycroft  did not move for the paramedics, and John frowned at him. Mycroft took a step back. He still had it.
The line went dead after a moment. John couldn’t think.
John rolled his eyes, and resisted the urge to straighten his desk. He had finger prints now, if he needed them, and he wasn’t about to defile them. “What is it, then, that I haven’t questioned?”
“I’m sorry to bother you—” John began, but he was cut off quickly. She didn’t spare him so much as a glance as she continued on with her work.
He wished he could be like the people lining the Mall, so taken away by the pomp and the grandeur. Instead, he was in what could only be described as a VIP section of stands, and John saw everything they chose to ignore. John saw reality, saw the boys who had been excluded for being too short or too tall, saw the women who had fought tooth and nail to be taken seriously, saw the sweat rolling off of the regiments as they marched and spun.
John gripped his paper cup of tea, the too-hot water having cooled to be tepid and tangy with the undertones of London’s water. John steeled himself. He knew what was coming would not be pleasant, not when Sherlock visibly detached herself from the world around her in self-preservation.
“I begin to think you are not as dense as Sherlock contends in her fits of pique.” Mycroft answered, “No more than six to eight weeks. I will extract you personally if I must.”
MacPherson trotted out from where he had been sniffing around the barn, and nudged his hand for petting. John complied, and the dog sat down by his feet, his craggy head tilting and his eyes wide at all of the sights and smells that surrounded him. John resolved to keep him close, for he had crime scene training, not barn safety training.
This entire chapter is born out of one bit of dialogue in the first chapter. Father Holmes tells John...
“The former.” John admitted, knowing that he had just requested and would receive a bit more pain medication. In truth, he would probably use a scalpel to remove his whole arm for how bad it hurt. “Thanks.”
“You as well.” John answered, “I suppose the blog is a bit of a laugh for people who know us.”
Pete snorted from where he was supporting Sherlock’s head. John quelled him with a glare.
He just didn't like that word right now, for obvious reasons.
“Yes, but I’m not giving it to you, or using it.” Sherlock replied, stuffing a bit of paper into the dregs of the coffee pot, which John was entirely responsible for binning. “She’s just gotten a divorce, compulsive liar, and quickly on the road to gaining fifty pounds and losing out on a possible promotion.”
John pushed open the door behind her, and wished her an honest farewell. He stood there for a long moment, watching her disappear towards Baker Street Station. Upstairs, he heard a rare happy wolf and an even more rare peal of genuine feminine laughter. Intrigued, John headed up the stairs to find out what was so going on that had filled both dog and woman with exuberant joy.
“They’re easy enough to fake and screenshot, no?” Evie asked as she at least pretended to take notes, “Chances are, they’ll—”
Quoted text in italics. Let me know if I missed any.
“I’m not contributing to the corruption of a minor.” John clapped him on the shoulder, “Tough luck mate. You’ll have to learn the same way we all did.”
, after the aforementioned historical figure, and immortalized in this
He was always going to be Umbrella Man in John's head.
“No, I’m just surprised you came, Dr. Watson.” Victor elaborated, “Sherlock has erroneous opinions about shooting. She fails to see how it assists the management of wildlife populations.”
“Who is this they?” Sherlock demanded, bursting out of the stairwell and onto her floor, “Clearly, they do not know John. He would never let himself die. He plans to retire after another few decades, to buy a small farm in his retirement. He wants a dog, several—” Sherlock was reluctant to discuss family planning with her brother listening in on the line, “He has plans. Nowhere do my projections include a possibility that he may…”
Sherlock’s body language screamed vague iteration, and her long legs disappeared underneath a skirt that brushed the bottom of her knees. “I’m sure it’s more than sufficient.”
“Asked me what kind of person would want to live with her. Wanted to know what I’d make of a person like that.” Mike colored a little, never liking to speak ill of another person, “If there ever was one, I suppose, knowing her.”
John was proud of the rhythm to his life. He’d spent much of his formative adult years as a solider, and he had got used to small routines that anchored him in the sameness and the chaos of military life. Small habits to keep him sane, in truth, were the carryover from being so responsible as a teen. Carrying the load of a sick mum and a sister who had never really given a shit about anything other than her latest obsession had shaped him.
John sighed, “You did leave everything everywhere for some inexplicable purpose.”
“No. Not that.” Sherlock shook her head, “It was just enough to render me aware of my surroundings, but to keep me silent, compliant. It was the worst experience of my life, barring that night in Ger—” Sherlock blew out a breath, finished the word, “Germany. Just before I felt the drug take effect, I tried to scream, knowing that it was pointless. I hadn’t tasted anything in the tea.”
Thankfully, the next day, he and Sherlock went to town, leaving the dogs in Carter’s care. There was a bit of shopping to do, and John was eager to remind himself that their lives were in London. He did the shopping as Sherlock texted and added random treats to their basket, and saw every friend of Nan’s it was possible to meet in the process.
John had no doubt that she would have a bevy of findings ready for dissemination upon Nan’s return. John wasn’t sure she quite wanted the input, but Sherlock’s heart was in the right place. She knew Nan was getting on in years, and was trying to lighten her load.
“I wouldn’t risk you, either, Sherlock.” John affirmed, “Not you, not MacPherson, not the Work, not even the severed head in the fridge.”
“Sherlock, just because I want something doesn’t mean that now is the best time for us to consider—” John cleared his throat, as yet another person entered earshot, carrying a combat bag with a dog on it.
God. Why was he so fucking trusting? Lucy was looking at his phone. He didn’t even have a passcode on his phone. He hung around criminals, and do you think they asked permission?
John couldn’t help but kiss the fine indentations on Sherlock’s freshly realigned shoulder. There was only the faintest bruising and swelling to indicate her pain or the trauma of the last day. “I just want to make sure you—”
With that, Lucy dashed to the door.
Greg grinned, “Well, she never did learn a new skill by half. And if she was going to learn to be social, she decided to learn from the best. She did make a few friends, but none eclipsed Molly.”
Sherlock stared over the top of the insipid magazine that allowed her to look like a fellow traveler. John hadn’t wanted Harry to come along today, but she was trying out sobriety once again. It wouldn’t stick, Sherlock knew, but the deeper motivation here was clear to her, just as it was clear to John. Harriet didn’t feel that a solider should have no one to see them off, even if their mother had died, their Grandmother was aged, and their father had absconded.
“I’m not backing out on you.” John promised him, focusing on Greg’s emotional distress rather than assure him of anything regarding his relationship with Sherlock. Those sort of assurances were hers and hers alone. “You’re not alone in this, Greg.”
The female paramedic glared at him, “Sir, we’ll make the determination.”
“Soldiers really do make the worst patients, as do doctors. Lucky you're not a farmer or you'd be three for three on the challenging patient lottery.” She replied, and John read her name tag and saw that her name was Jessica. Jessica from New Jersey, John thought blearily. “Try to get some rest. We’ll have your transport orders as soon as you’re stable enough, and we’ll have you home to your wife.”
“He wants what you want for MacPherson.” Sherlock returned, “It seems only MacPherson and I understand that he must stay at Baker Street.”
“And what did I find your work to be? Not paper after paper on fiber forensics, no, but a tawdry, grasping, plot to get a man who wouldn’t have looked your way had not your brother—”
John was drying himself off and throwing on the clothes that a sneaky Sherlock had left on the toilet lid when there came a knock on the door. John heard Molly’s happy farewell to MacPherson, and MacPherson’s nails skittering on the hardwood as he accosted Sherlock, happily woofing and jumping around.
Maybe they weren’t ready to talk. He knew they’d have to talk this week. There was time enough to figure out if she’d asked him for a relationship or something, because God knew he could never just have sex with Sherlock Holmes. The idea of a no-strings sort of sex holiday, at her parent’s estate, for God’s sake, was untenable and made dread build in his heart.
“But we both know that's not quite true.” Victor noted, “After all, I have it in writing, don’t I?”
Sherlock shook her head. Were there tears in her voice? Something inside John broke at the thought, but of course that was mere imagination. This was not something to push Sherlock to tears. Bodies were simply The Work. “No. I need a doctor, for him, though.”
The nurse nodded, but Sherlock didn’t see it. She simply stared at John, and began to tell him of his medical condition. She ran out of things to say there, and tried to think of something to say. She had nothing to say. She wanted to scream, to cry, to mourn this pain, but she owed John the strength he had shown at their last meeting.
John told her just what he had always told families in waiting rooms, “Best leave them to their work.”
“I’m just sorry he's a deal breaker for you.” John replied, knowing full well that this was not something Sarah wanted to work on with him. He said it plainly to spare her having to do so.
John put the letter away, and finished his dinner, ignoring the good-natured inquires. His mates shut up when he told them it was his sister. They didn’t know she was struggling with alcoholism, but they did know that John loved his sister. He’d never said, but it was part of him.
Sherlock was sneaky, he’d give her that much. She’d placed that file in his case, when she was spinning around fixing her hair, slight of hand and distraction coming to her aid. Still, it was pretty funny. Lestrade’s team members were digging around her rat hole of an apartment looking for a file the DI would seemingly have misplaced. It was only when he realized how angry Sally and Dimmock would be, both at the DI and at seemingly wasting their time, that John got Sherlock’s motive.
John didn’t dare say that Sarah wouldn’t still be in the room if Sherlock didn’t at least consider Sarah less hateful than the majority of people. He knew well that Sherlock’s acceptance, if not approval, of his need for pointless social interaction was important to him. They’d been through a lot of shit together over the last six months as flatmates. It was only normal to value her insights and opinions.
John proposed.
He still had no idea how he was going to fit all of this in the boot of the 4WD that had shown up in front of Baker Street this morning. The keys had been included in John’s morning paper, just atop an article about the Girl with the Deerstalker Hat’s fashion. “You could help load the boot, Sherlock.”
She shoved her slim feet back into her flats, and declared, “What, John, did you think I had grown up in a barn?”
“In other words, naturally.” Greg admitted, “She said it behooved her to learn various soft skills for the Work, for cases, but it wasn’t hard to discern that she was taking a scientific approach towards learning to get out of her shell a bit.”
“We won’t kill him.” John replied, “However, he’s going to tell us everything about our Mr. Weston. The more he says, the less likely he’ll find himself serving at Her Majesty’s pleasure.”
Well, John had been there, and all he had to say was that they had been inside and upstairs in the next thirty seconds, and Sherlock had been wearing dark tights. So yes, her legs were almost around him in the last shot, but it wasn’t as though anything had been going on, not really, at least in that respect. She'd just been a bit knock-kneed, picking her up had facilitated getting inside.
“I am not confused.” Sherlock told him, following him down hallways and around corners, knowing that this place contained people who had done things she would never understand. She had never understood John’s choice to go to war, never understood why a country would ask that of its people, but she understood well that she was seeing human resilience around her. “I am here to see John, and arrange for his transport to the a military hospital in the United Kingdom.”
Cannon dog is a bulldog named Gladstone, I think, but I gave them a Scottish Deerhound named
“If, Luce?” John grinned as his phone dinged, one, two, three, four, five, six times in rapid succession.  After a moment wherein they were both absorbed in their phones, he added, “That’s optimistic. He’s working a 7.75. I’m here on the 0.25% chance he won’t get shot gadding about London.”
Sherlock knew that wasn’t true. She would rush home and call her mother, and then her aunt, who had married an American man and given up a perfectly decent homeland for a place with too much fast food and no appreciation for accessorizing. Still, Sherlock’s sole aim was that this girl not tell John.
Even with his pension and Sherlock’s cases, money would be tight. He needed a job. And luckily, he had an interview at a nearby clinic in an hour, set up this morning. John hoped he’d make a good impression.
Sherlock put the phone on speaker, and John scanned the screen carefully, waiting for the connection to register in his programming.
Sherlock was not a total stranger to military installations. Still, landing at Rammstein was something that required careful concentration. Even at this hour, planes were queuing and depositing people and cargo at rapid paces. Sherlock was quickly and efficiently checked and ushered into a waiting car, which moved speedily on private motorways that were closed to the public.
“That would be lovely, John.” Molly blushed, rosy and pink.  “No one ever offers me coffee.”
He wisely did not press her on the subject of Wilhelmina. It seemed rather risky, and John was not willing to make a fool of himself by exposing the fact that he did not know someone she felt he ought to know. It did not do to look under-informed, not in his line of work. John made a note of the name, and thought again of his mystery benefactress. Somehow, the name just didn’t fit his understanding of her.
At breakfast, John joined Molly and Sherlock, who were discussing one of Molly’s latest cadavers. Sherlock was angling to get the fingers for experimentation, and John used their interaction as a cover to watch his own prey eat his own breakfast and annoy at least two of Sherlock’s aunts, who John knew were known to Victor’s mother, though she was not known to the aunts, who were figures in the charity scene. They were forever after Sherlock to endorse some cause. This morning, Sherlock had declared her charitable efforts to be the toleration of idiots in the world around her.
“Look...” John sighed, “Before you haul me off to some warehouse, try and chain my hands to a table, and try to make me listen to Barney for a few weeks, you should know that I never took the job, and I am not going to take it. If you want somebody to track her movements for you, pay someone else.”
John did not want to think about his mother, cold in the ground. He did not want to think of there being nothing left in Chelmsford save bad memories and the one bright spot that had been his education. He needed to get away. Afghanistan was as far as he could go from the hellhole that was his home life.
The six hundred and fifty mile drive passed rather quickly, considering the car was bugged and Sherlock slept most of the way. John checked twice to make sure she hadn’t been drugged, or more accurately, drugged herself. She’d done some massive experiment with every nicotine patch in the flat last night, and he wanted to make sure the drowsiness wasn’t some Sherlockian response to nicotine poisoning combined with dramamine and boredom.
It was, he decided, simply that he should not be here. He should be with Sherlock, wherever she was inhaling secondhand smoke, and fussing in her brisk way over her Network. He should be there, just to be there. It had nothing to do with Sarah, and everything to do with Sherlock. If she’d not been with the Network tonight, he would have never found himself in this tumult of thoughts.
It was this pronouncement that sent agony ripping through her body. John loved the Army. They didn’t understand, they were all stupid. The Army was John’s whole world. He helped people. He was a good man, a good man, who made a difference. He used his pain to connect with others, not build walls of ice and intellect. He was a good man, so far beyond anything they could even begin to comprehend. She wished it had been her. She would give up science, give up deduction, if it meant that he could do that which he loved and make the world a better, happier, place, just by being alive in it.
John finished his shift, thankfully without any intrusion of anyone interested in his Sherlockian escapades, though he did have to turn off his phone to avoid it buzzing like mad in his pocket. When he bade everyone farewell, he tried not to be personally offended at how relieved they all looked.
“No, oh no.” The shopgirl smiled, “I follow your blog, you know. I just wanted to say that I enjoy it. I hope you’ll keep writing about your new dog. He’s certainly stolen a lot of hearts.”
He would not spoil it. The conversation was lively, and John enjoyed watching Mummy and Father. He had long ago wondered how Sherlock and Mycroft could be at once so off-beat and so well-adjusted, and he knew that he had found the answer in observing the older Holmes couple. There was a balance and an accord between them that had shaped their children in the same way that his own parental discord had shaped John and Harry.
