“It’s ‘cohort,’ sweetie,” Tony told her, “and it means a group of people who sort of team up together.” Steve smiled at the soft tone he used for his explanation and the way Morgan nodded along, just like her father.
Morgan made an excited noise and jumped up and down. Tony walked over to the small closet by the entryway of the house and grabbed the tiny purple snowsuit and her matching boots. He kneeled down to help Morgan into the snowsuit one foot at a time. She wobbled a little but kept her balance by holding tightly onto his shoulder.
Rhodey had been the main “caretaker” of Morgan following her father’s isolation. Happy, Steve, and Peter would help when they could but Morgan was the most comfortable with her Uncle Rhodey, having known him the longest.
He had forgiven Bucky as much as he could, understanding that yes, of course wasn’t his fault, but as much Tony could forgive him, Bucky still had the same face as the guy who had strangled his mom in cold blood.
“Peter, what was I supposed to do? I’ve been trying to get ahold of you guys for days now, so I thought it would be easiest just to drive up here myself, then you’d have to see me,” she looked almost apologetic as she walked past him into the house.
“I know you probably think that because of what happened in your office you can’t, but you can, I swear. You just caught me off-guard there.”
Every day since the funeral, Peter had gotten phone calls from Aunt May, all pressing him about when he’d be going back to school. It wasn’t that he
“Garage. Tinkering,” Rhodey looked sort of disappointed with that, but it wasn’t like that was unusual for the man, especially when he was under personal stress.
Steve looked more relaxed than Tony thought he’d ever seen him, face free from worry and hair a little messy. He was such a natural with Morgan, though he knew the man didn’t think he was. Morgan was as adorable as she always was, but especially so with the costume. Tony absolutely did not giggle at the way Morgan was frowning with her whole face.
Happy stepped in, “Morgan, I’ll tell you a story, come on.” He tried to lead her to her bedroom, but she refused.
“Before then, I think.” Happy agreed with him and the two grabbed plates and cutlery for breakfast when Steve instructed them too.
They all sat down at the table and started eating. Steve helped cut her food into more manageable pieces and Rhodey read the news off of his Stark tablet.
Five seconds later, he was standing back in the same position. His lip was bloodied and the briefcase was empty, but other than that, he appeared exactly the same to the three men waiting for him.
“That’s too early for me to be up on a Saturday,” Tony complained and Steve shared a look with Morgan.
“Uh,” Steve stammered, “May, Happy, Sam, and Bucky… We should invite Wanda, she has no one else to go to,” Tony nodded in agreement, “and we need to figure out you and me too, I guess. Would you be okay with, maybe, sleeping upstairs-”
“Why would I leave the house when I’ve got all I need right here?” Tony flashed Steve the kind of fake grin that Steve recognized as his ‘charming businessman’ smile. The one he used when he needed to get his way. For some reason, it made Steve’s stomach turn and he focused on Morgan hobbling over to him. She walked very penguin-like due to her snowsuit restricting her body movement and it was endearing.
“It’s fine,” he said in a strained voice that suggested it was clearly not fine. He walked back to the office and shut the door with a force that made everyone jump a little. Happy looked appropriately guilty as Rhodey glared at him a little.
Halfway through, Tony took a seat at the end of the table. Everyone tried to remain unfazed but the tension was palpable.
Peter let out another whimper and Tony pulled him closer to him, cradling the back of his head to his chest. It wasn’t that Tony did have those types of thoughts cross his mind anymore, because he did. They were much less frequent, yes, but he didn’t think the basic ‘it should have been me, I was the one who deserved to die’ would ever really go away.
After Thanksgiving, Tony had decided that enough was enough: he was putting his head back into it and taking over his temporarily passed off responsibilities at Stark Industries. He tried not to focus on how ecstatic Steve was when he walked by his office (still with the door open, because apparently Tony was a child) and saw him with his laptop open, paperwork sprawled out everywhere. Steve tried to nonchalantly pass it off, but Tony saw his puppy-dog grin before he could.
So, he was taking advantage of the opportunity. He sat down at his desk slowly, careful not to shift any of the papers sprawled over the surface of the desk out of place. The desk stretched across the wall and had a wall windows in front of it. The windows doubled as displays for modeling tech and whatever else he needed them for.
“I don’t think he gets much of a say, but I don’t think he would,” Tony shook his head before calling out, “Pete! C’mere please.”
Really, Tony could do anything he wanted to as he wasn’t being hovered over like a child. He glanced at the files and SI paperwork and decided that they could definitely wait until Morgan was back in the house to distract him from them. Sure, Tony could tinker or work on specs for suits for a couple of the Avengers that were due for an upgrade, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.
“I did, didn’t I? Why did I do that? Now, you’re gonna be smarter than me in no time,” Tony pouted at her.
“I know,” Steve looked at him and Tony stopped. “Buck’s actually Jewish, but he always used to come over to my apartment for Christmas when we were kids every year.” Steve shrugged, looking back to his list.
“Steve, when do you do your stone thing today?” Rhodey called over to him. Steve didn’t look up from the spatula search.
“Did you get it?” Tony looked up and saw Steve picking up Morgan to put on his shoulders and then tap Peter on the leg to put away his phone.
“Is Mr. Stark okay do you think, Pete?” Aunt May had asked him in a hushed voice as they helped to clear the dinner dishes while Bucky had gone to grab the pumpkin pies from the kitchen. Bucky had claimed it was ‘un-American’ to have Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie and vowed to bring one when Steve, Mr. America himself, appalled everyone by saying he hadn’t picked one up yet for the dinner.
Tony didn’t say anything and so Peter continued, “Mr. Stark, just so someone’s told you it, I just want to say that it’s okay to let yourself be, y’know, happy… Pepper wouldn’t be mad at you for having a life after her.”
Here’s another chapter for you guys, I had a lot of fun writing this one (despite how absolutely depressing it is.) Enjoy!
Tony pressed his head against the glass and let out a slow breath, fogging up the glass until it obscured his view of them.
“So is leaving a suicidal man alone in a room with engineering… things…” Steve gestured at random equipment, “at his disposal.”
“Hmm, what?” He groggily wiped the sleep from his eyes and sat up. God, his ribs still hurt. He looked down at his chest and saw that the bruising was almost all yellow and nearly healed which was a good thing though. He looked at the coffee table to see a clean folded t-shirt waiting for him.
Of course, it was always on the back of his mind that soon enough, he would have to step up and return the stones. It had already been decided that it would be him, he was the natural candidate considering he had nothing to lose. Or at least nothing he would be willing to admit would hurt if he lost. Steve needed a bit of a breather between the funeral and going back - or so he said - and Bruce made it very clear that the very latest the stones could stay in their timeline was one week, so Steve would make the journey tomorrow.
“Peter, you’d be an idiot not to go back to school and you’re smarter than that, come on,” Tony looked so disappointed in him, but whether it was because he thought Peter was leaving or that Peter was considering staying longer, he couldn’t tell.
Twenty-five minutes later, Tony emerged, all visibly-forced smiles, and asked if anyone wanted a coffee or anything before the went home. Most of them politely declined and soon enough the cars were pulling out of the driveway.
to go back right away, she said, it was that he needed to make a decision so she could inform the school when he’d be back. Peter didn’t know what to do. Obviously, he knew he couldn’t avoid going back to school forever - nor did he want to - but he felt like the situation was too fragile for him to mess up; like everyone had their place in the Jenga tower that Peter thought was most likely a metaphor for Mr. Stark’s mental health, and that if another piece was taken out it would fall. He didn’t want to be that piece.
Happy held Morgan’s hand and as they began to walk down the hall, he pointed at Peter and motioned for him to come with them.
“I just,” his voice was still a little raspy and he had to stop to clear his throat again, “I just want you to know that you can talk to me about this kind of stuff.”
Even though it’s kind of hard to write a genius four-year-old, Morgan is such a blast to write! I imagine her basically being exactly like a Mini Tony, right down to the sass and the intellect (although she definitely gets a fair share of both from Pepper too lol.) Also, don’t attack Tony for snapping at Morgan; he’s still a great dad, just going through some pretty dark stuff atm.
“That’s right,” Tony nodded, “and when you compare that with how long the universe has been around for - hell, even how long Uncle Thor has been around for - well, then twelve years is a very short amount of time.”
“Not my fault. I know. But it still should’ve been me,” Tony finished for Steve. Steve didn’t have it in him to disagree, considering he had the same thought about himself.
“It’s an engine.” She corrected. “Well, not yet. It’s the start of an engine. Mommy says-” the girl cut herself off and her eyes began to water. “Mommy says I’m not allowed to play with real engines yet, but Daddy said he’d show me how to build a real one when I turn five.” Tears streamed down her face but unlike the day before, she didn’t start scream-crying. She turned away from the two men and ran over to Steve.
They all knew that because of the serum Steve would be completely healed within a day or two, but it sure didn’t make it hurt any less in the meantime. When they were done, Steve moved over to the couch and stretched out, keeping an ice pack on the blotchy bruising around his ribs. The bruises were already becoming lighter despite it barely being a few hours since they were sustained.
, he meant, “then I’m sure Wanda wouldn’t mind staying with Peter and Morgan, she loves the kids… and we could stick Sam and Bucky in my room and hope they don’t kill themselves… and if it’s okay with you, I could stay in yours…” Steve avoided eye contact and felt himself blushing even if the proposition wasn’t the least bit suggestive. “Just for the holidays,” he added, as if that wasn’t obvious enough.
“Daddy says that you can get really hurt but heal really fast,” she said matter-of-fact as she very gently traced the outline of one bruise.
“Since we’re down by one leader or trainer or whatever you want to call it…” Oh. She meant Natasha. Steve blinked rapidly to prevent any tears from falling.
He sat on Morgan’s bed and stroked her forehead as he sang quietly. She looked up at him with such awe. Steve knew his own face probably mirrored her expression. He crouched down right outside the door, unbeknownst to the father and daughter just inside. The song was slow and Steve was sure he had heard it before, although where he couldn’t tell.
Peter hovered by the pair before he felt an arm pull him into the exchange. It was then when he lost it, tears streaming down his face and neck. Part of it was, of course, Pepper’s death and the devastation that came with it, but there was another part of him that was crying out of the relief of having Mr Stark back in his life. He clutched onto the man and refused to let go now that he had him back.
“You know,” he started, breaking the pleasantly formed silence, “believe me when I say that this is something I never thought I would say… like ever… but I think you’re actually kind of good for him right now.”
“There. Much better,” Peter was almost proud of what he accomplished within two minutes of being in the office.
However, both men were willing to get over whatever resentment they held for the holiday season to make it perfect for Morgan. After everything that had happened over the past few months, this was something they had to make right for her.
“Oh, kid,” Tony stood up and opened his arms. Peter ran into him in the exact same way Morgan did and just cried into his shirt. “Hey, it’s okay, don’t worry about it.”
Steve wasn’t sure when he had fallen asleep, but he woke up hours later with a blanket pulled over him and little hands grabbing his face. “Uncle Steve, it’s dinner time.”
two chapters in one day?? (well it’s after 12am where i am, but i haven’t slept yet so yeah one day.)
aghjhslkdjfs sorry for the massive nearly year-long delay in updating. thank you for all the lovely comments on the previous chapters and thanks for reading if you've made it this far. i'm not sure what my plans for this story are moving forward but i'd like to finish what i started.
Tony covered his face with his hands and she climbed into his lap. He wrapped his arms around her and she wiped away his tears with the sleeves of her pajama shirt. Steve creeped back and went back downstairs, feeling a little guilty for having witnessed the private moment.
“Let’s not go there yet,” both men grimaced at the thought of Tony being told by SI’s Board of Directors that he needed to find someone as a replacement for his wife’s position and come back to work himself. It would not end very well, that’s for sure.
“Y’know, I never really believed in the whole ‘soulmates’ crap or whatever - I still don’t, but I just feel so lost without her. I don’t know how I’m supposed to move on. I-I can’t move on. And, yeah, I know things will hurt less in a year or five from now but I don’t even want them to. I just keep thinking about how one day Morgan’s barely going to remember her own mother and it’ll be because of me.”
The sound of Thanos’ snap was all Tony could hear. It was over. Again. He closed his eyes. He wasn’t going to watch his teammates turn to ash a second time in his life. One out of fourteen million. He should’ve known better than to hope.
“Because you have a second chance.” Tony stood up from the chair. Steve jumped up from his place on the ground, mirroring the man.
It seemed that Mr Stark had the same idea because for the entirety of the funeral he stood with Morgan on his hip and an arm around Peter. He didn’t have more than a nod for those who offered him their condolences, especially those on the Board of Directors for Stark Industries.
“For the last time: absolutely not.” This had been all Tony had heard in the two weeks since Halloween.
“Yeah, I’m gonna be an Avenger when I’m older. Daddy will build me a suit and I can be Iron Girl and fight the bad guys,” Morgan supplied.
“I was just saying how you’ll have your work cut out for you when you guys all get back to work,” Maria Hill raised her eyebrows at Steve.
That’s forever away,” Morgan’s jaw dropped and Tony had to stop himself from giggling at how cute it was when she was mad.
It was a Saturday, meaning Peter was at his aunt’s house and he was stuck in the house with the kid and Captain Nice-Ass. After a second of thought, Tony groaned, burying his face in his pillow, brainstorming all the ways he could suffocate himself without getting up. Unfortunately for him, not even five minutes later he could hear little footsteps racing across the hard-wood flooring and jump onto his bed.
“Daddy, aren’t you going to tell me a bedtime story?” The girl seemingly thought that since Tony had re-emerged from the office, their routines would fall back into place as normal. Morgan’s bedtime stories had formerly been Tony telling slightly fictional, G-rated stories of his time with the Avengers, but he didn’t trust himself to tell one in his present state.
The funeral gathered a crowd far larger than expected. That’s what happens when the funeral is that of someone who saved the universe, Peter guessed. Nearly everyone who had fought Thanos had attended, but Peter recognized faces from all over. There was a group he knew as SI employees from the times he
“How much more do I have to suck up to you before you’ll agree?” Rhodey still looked mildly unimpressed and Tony changed his approach. “Last time I appointed my successor it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made... Will you at least think about it for me? Please?”
“Mr. Stark, hi, it’s Peter,” he had identified the blob curled in a blanket and sitting in the office chair as Mr. Stark. “Have you thought about maybe opening a window in here? It’s kind of… stuffy.” As he said this, Peter carefully walked over to the windows and cracked them all open. He grabbed the miscellaneous protein bar wrappers strewn across the desk and threw them in the trash under the desk.
“I don’t know,” Happy answered honestly. “I have no idea. I mean, he can’t expect any of us to stay here forever. I have to get back to work too, and so does he, really.”
“Still,” Tony twitched, “seems like something I should know.” Steve didn’t have a response for that, so they just stood there, Steve tapping his pen against the notebook.
Of course, there was always going to be conflict, that was just a part of life. For the first time, Steve didn’t feel the overwhelming need to insert himself into it. Maybe it was because he finally found something to end the fight for.
“Kay… Cool,” Peter flipped back over, pulling the blanket over his head and Steve made his way out of the house.
“I’m really glad you’re here,” Tony said and meant it. Peter’s shoulders seemed to relax a little bit and he paused for a second before nodding at him.
“I just got a phone call,” Rhodey stood with Happy in the kitchen, both of them watching as Steve cracked eggs into a bowl to scramble.
“Uncle Happy got Chinese food!” She said excitedly as he grabbed the shirt and pulled it over his head.
Peter mouthed back at him, pointing to his chest. Happy nodded somewhat aggressively and Peter got up to follow them despite his reservations.
“I wanna be Iron Girl!” She squealed and Tony made a face. “Like Daddy… and Mommy too,” Morgan added after a moment.
“This is almost an engine. It’s like a...” Morgan searched for the right word, frowning slightly. Her eyes lit up. “Oh! It’s like a pro-to-type.” She said, breaking down the word. She looked up at him for confirmation and he gave a slight nod. He gripped her tighter as she continued to point out the intricacies of her design in terms that even Steve (whose experience with children was limited to those times where mothers would hand him their babies for photographs) knew were far more advanced than your average four-year-old. She was truly her father’s daughter.
He didn’t mean to start crying, but it happened anyway. He’d cried more in the past two and a half months then he ever had in his life. It was embarrassing, yes, but it wasn’t like it was unjustified.
“Daddy, look, I’m Auntie Tasha!” Morgan gave Tony a toothy grin and suddenly Tony was glad for the sheet because his eyes were welling up too.
“Can you grab the toast please?” Peter nodded and grabbed it, following behind him. “Was that your aunt?”
“Why are you here, Pete? Shouldn’t you be at school or something?” Tony said after a moment of silence. His words weren’t hostile and Peter had to remind himself not to take them as such.
To Tony, if Peter’s meltdown earlier had said anything, it was that the subject was probably to be avoided.
“I think you need to put some more thought into who you’re willing to just hand over your entire company to,” Rhodey put on the appearance of distaste, but Tony could see through his facade.
The sound of forks scraping plates was the only sound heard for a few minutes until the doorbell rang.
Besides, in complete truth, he really was busy with Mr. Stark. Rhodey and Happy has pulled him aside the day after the funeral and basically forced him to knock on Mr. Stark’s office door, as they thought Peter had the best chance of having the door opened to him.
“You could always come back to D.C. you know. It would be nice to have a mediator again.” Sam shot a glare at Bucky who rolled his eyes in response.
Steve started working on the ridiculously high stack of dishes by the sink with Rhodey, who had decided to stay the night after Tony’s mini episode.
PLEASE be warned that this chapter contains a TW for suicidal thoughts as well as a suicide attempt. It takes place in the last section of the chapter, so if you think you may be triggered by it please skip over it and I’ll quickly recap what you missed (non-graphically) in the end notes.
In an attempt to prevent a meltdown, Happy looked around the room until he spotted Steve. “Morgan, do you want to go show Uncle Steve the… thing… you built?”
Tony abruptly stood up from the table, scraping his chair backwards, and walked through to the kitchen. Rhodey got up and went after him before Steve could do the same himself.
Peter looked hesitant. “The kind who’s never really had any extended family to have over for the holidays before?” He said in a small voice. “It’s just,” he spoke up, “well, May and Ben were my only extended family before my parents… and when they took me in that was it. So, I’ve never really had a ‘big family Christmas’ or anything before.”
The latter seemed to be the current case, as Steve just stood by. He was about to sit down onto the frosted grass but Tony stopped him, grabbing his bicep before he could. He stood up and poked his head inside the tent, rustling around a bit before emerging with a second chair. Steve’s jaw nearly dropped. Tony placed it next to his and gestured down at it.
“Okay,” Morgan nodded. Steve expected the girl to get distracted by someone else, but instead she plopped down on the floor beside him and grabbed her junior circuit board from the coffee table.
“And I’m being called back to work. The amount of damage control needed is astounding. I mean, not only with the compound and everything, but when everyone came back there were the expected casualties caused by traffic accidents and that sort of thing. That’s not even to mention that a lot of these people have been displaced and now have nowhere to go,” Happy just blankly blinked at Rhodey in response. “What I’m saying is that I’m going to need to leave here within the next couple of days and what the hell are we supposed to do about Tony?”
She looks down and sees her chest wrapped in gauze and two wires trailing out between the layers. She follows its length over her shoulder towards another table where it connects to a car battery.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Peter witnessed Pops' brows furrow. "Shouldn't Peter have lunch first, Tony?"
“What witchcraft!” Hawk cries, pointing an accusing finger at their guest. “I’m a year older and I have almost the same amount of wrinkles as my grandmother!”
To him, it’s a small price to pay in order to give complete strangers just that bit of peace of mind.
“Right,” he says into the emptiness, voice a rasp, and pushes himself to his feet. “Let’s see what the others are up to.”
Bucky continues to wave his stick. “Oh, I noticed, just thought maybe normalcy will get those tiny cogs in your brain turning.”
“Is that even safe?” Steve gives her an unsure look, taking the towel DUM-E hands him, which he had fetched after abandoning his fire extinguisher.
“What?” he asks, incredulously, looking down at her. “I leave you alone for several hours, Toni. Not even a full day. What were you doing?”
"That party!" Toni waves to the remaining screen where the news continued to play and hurried up the stairs. A second later she hears Steve follow.
Pepper shares a look with Happy, but neither of them say a word in further protest. Instead, Happy radioes Jarvis’ car and lets them know of the change in plans.
kiss with much fanfare during movie night. There was idle chatter between everyone as they reached a lull in the movie they were watching (Peter couldn't remember what it was because he was sitting under Dad's arm and Dad was cuddled back into Pops and hope was blooming in his chest), when Sam voiced that he's never, since becoming an Avenger, received a Stark kiss.
The inside of the venue is buzzing with just as much activity as it is outside, though it’s more muted. But Steve watches out of the corner of his eye as heads swivel and follow them cut through the crowd and straight for the bar that Toni’s subtly tugging Steve towards.
Pepper's hands are warm as they curl around her own where they were fiddling with her own mug of coffee. His eyes are clear and Toni feels the tension between her shoulders release. "Okay," he says quietly. "I trust you. You've never once given me an excuse to not trust you, Toni. Question my sanity, yes, but never to not trust you."
So it didn’t really stick with her younger self how much courage it took for Steve to dive in after her thirty minutes later when she got a foot cramp so intense it had her flailing around in panic as lake water went up her nose, filled her lungs, made her choke (caused her to think clearly of circuits, lines of codes, wheels, a claw, maybe a couple of claws that could tug her out of dangerous situations–) before she was lifted above the water and she can breathe again.
Then he registers what he’s seeing. Toni isn’t falling anymore. Toni didn’t fall to her death. She back up and flying, twisting and looping in the air and headed back home.
“Good job on keeping your cool,” she tells Steve after a moment. “I really didn’t need you guys to continue the fiasco of the one Christmas we had together.”
This time though, there’s no Steve to save her. This time, she’ll have to use her head and save herself.
When they got hack home earlier in the day, she had left Steve to his devices to take a nap, slathering her healing shoulders with more aloe vera before she flopped onto her unmade bed. God, her conversation with Rhodey and lunch with Aunt Peggy had her mentally exhausted.
Steve tunes him out in favor of focusing back on his sword, a smile on his face. In the reflection of the blade, he meets a pair of laughing brown eyes.
“Well, maybe that should change,” Howard replies, shifting so his walking stick was perched in front of him, perfectly in the middle as he gripped it with both hands. If it weren’t for the obvious air of despair around the other man, Steve would’ve thought he was staring at the Howard Stark the media loved to praise and hate in equal measures.
, finally, they got him back. A little worse for wear, sure (if you count decades of brain washing, torture, and mind control, worse for wear), but he’s out of Hydra’s grasp, back with Steve, with
Steve saved her then despite his trauma with big bodies of water, and she’s looked up to him ever since.
That prompted Potts into action and Steve was hot on his heels. Toni didn’t sound like she was dying, but if Steve learned anything from being around Toni as she grew up, that was hardly a tell.
Steve can make out Toni’s familiar silhouette through the tint of the glass doors leading out to the balcony. He sidesteps and plants himself by one of the pillars next to the door, hidden from Toni and Potts' view, but still able to keep an eye on the room.
By the time Steve finished cooking, three hours have passed and Toni was still asleep, so he scooped some of the pasta and meatballs into a plate and placed it in the microwave with instructions to JARVIS to let Toni know when she wakes up if he’s still out.
“Not witchcraft,” Tony says on a grin, plopping himself in the seat across from Hawk which had been Steve’s until Rhodes arrived. “Just good genes, I’m afraid.”
Hawk sputters and promptly falls back from his log, making Bucky and Sam howl with laughter while Thor encourages Hawk to do it again. Loki only further buries his head in his tome.
It was empty save for him now that Edwin had gone back to New York to prepare for Howard’s homecoming. If everything goes to plan, they’d have Howard out by evening and have him on a plane bound for the East Coast.
“And Fury is just alright with sending his man out to a function like this?” Toni waves her glass around to indicate the room at large and side-eyes the man as she takes another sip.
Steve squares his shoulders, meeting Toni’s gaze in the distorted metal surface of the elevator. “It was tempting, but I figured you could use more adult influence in your life, so...”
Steve closes the door after him and turns to Rhodes, holding his hand out for his own handshake. “Keep the castle from burning down?”
“I’m so sorry,” Potts apologizes again as he lifts a length of copper wire up, hand dripping from said inorganic discharge of the device (whatever that means) and continues to pull and tug just as Toni says, “-and make sure you don’t pull out the magnet at- at the end of it!”
The courtyard is bustling with activity with last minute preparations as servants ran back and forth from the castle and between carts and carriages. Steve was stationed in the middle by Sir Carbonell’s carriage, reaching down to pat Valkyrie’s neck every time she snorts when someone comes a little too close to her.
“Thank you, Steve,” she replies and he nods, pushing off the car. He waves as Toni rolls the window back up and gives him a parting nod.
Toni watches as her bots clean up the mess that used to be the Shelby Cobra, pressing an ice bag to her head as she slumps further on the couch.
Peggy had teased him once before even though it had been the truth. Steve was not much good at rubbing elbows and coaxing deals out of people, but he can smile and nod like the best of them so it’s what he was usually relegated to during such events.
Bucky taps at his earpiece and answers through the mic tapped to his throat, "I'd rather he be pissed after the mission than worried during."
When Bucky received his after a month since his arrival from Wakanda, trigger-free yet not entirely the Bucky from the forties, and Pops breaks the glass he was holding after Dad leaves the room...Peter wondered, not for the first time since this all started, how long Dad was gonna ride out the petty wave for.
Silence reigns in the hallway once more with Stane watching Toni with a half-smile that wasn’t far from being incredulous.
A minute later, the elevator dings to announce Stane’s arrival before the sound of expensive shoes on linoleum floors fill the silence. Steve looks up at the appropriate time to find the man coming forward with his media smile. Steve braces himself.
Guys...I learned a whole new set of codes for this chapter...please...please validate my efforts with many praises xD
Steve checks the time, drains his coffee in one go and sends Howard a form nod as he stands up. “I’m ready.”
In the Stark-Rogers’ lake house living room, the glass top coffee table comes to life with blue lights before the picture is projected upwards to float just above the surface and rotate slowly.
“I’ll catch you inside, Hef.” Toni pats the man’s shoulder before sliding back against Steve’s side.
For a second, King Howard simply stares at him, before a small smile twitches at his mustache. “Yes,” he says, “I believe you are. Sir Carbonell, please, step forward.”
she types back and scrunching her nose at the way the suit looked in the titanium gold alloy. Not even her outlandish sense of fashion can stomach this. Then she sees the Roadster through the hologram screens next to the suit. Huh.
“It’s nothing, just a little snag,” Toni waves him off then reached for the reactor in her chest and twists. “There’s an exposed wire-” she grunts as she slowly pulls the reactor up, “-and it’s contacting the socket wall, causing a bit of...shortage.”
She hears a huff somewhere above her, though she can’t be bothered to check. Closing her eyes felt too damn good.
Hawk is the first to recover, having scrambled back atop his log. “Crown Prince, Prince Anthony Stark? That Crown Prince? The one who ran off to party, womanize, and drown himself in booze while we fought for our country? That Crown Prince? The one who holed up in the Winter Palace with the slaves he bought when we almost lost? That Crown Prince? The one who hasn’t even shown his face since we returned?
With the efficiency instilled in him by the Army, Steve finished getting ready for his morning run in less than five minutes and he’s jogging down the steps and just about ready to head out the door when he noticed the lights spilling up from the stairs leading to Toni’s workshop.
There was no fanfare when Wanda got hers, but there were some tears on the Scarlet Witch's part. They were at an Avengers' PR party (Peter was there as Tony's son, not Spider-Man because it'll be extremely awkward to wear the mask with a suit), and Peter was scanning the parameter next to Pops when he spots Dad and Wanda standing behind a pillar, away from prying eyes, Wanda's hands held in Dad's as he spoke to her in hushed tones without his glasses on.
He knew what they were thinking and he knew what was being said around base. Toni Stark is dead, they’re just looking for a body now.
Steve forced breath into his lungs and casts a look towards Rhodey. The other man looked exactly how Steve felt: murderous. “Shrapnel?”
There were bruises scattered across her face and bare arms, her lips were chapped with dried blood, but the worse of it was on her shoulders where the sun had burned blisters into her skin.
(Because for as long as Peter could remember, Uncle Rhodey was the Man of The Grill, no matter who's in Dad's life. So, to work next to Uncle Rhodey at the grill was a position no one should take lightly.)
“Don’t fish for compliments, Captain,” she says with a haughty sniff, chin lifted in faux derision. “It’s very unbecoming of a Knight. And his King’s Knight, no less.”
“Hef, you look great!” Toni stops her subtle fast trek down the carpet to greet an old man surrounded by beautiful women, his back to them.
“Good.” Howard stands as well and hobbles around his desk. “You’ll have access to anything you might need that SI can provide on the plane over. If you need more resources, just let us know and we’ll fake care of it.” He stops before Steve and holds out a hand and Steve takes it after a second. “Bring her home, Steve. Bring my daughter home.”
"Because you don't have a history with baby Stark." Natasha's smirk comes through loud and clear even without Bucky looking at her.
Toni smiles, breathing easier even with the weight of the reactor in her chest. "Have I ever told you I love you?"
“Here, let me,” Tony shifted the wig so it sat straight on Morgan’s head and smiled at her. “There.”
“Well, you managed to get Tony out of that goddamn office, so I’ll say thank you either way,” Rhodey stood up and slapped Peter’s back.
Lady Potts waves his concern away. “As you were, Captain. Sir Carbonell and I will check on the carts.”
“Oh, this makes things so much easier then,” Lady Potts says turning to Sir Carbonell. “But Peter will still be joining you.”
Toni stumbles across a worn tennis ball just before she reaches the door and lobs it across the room for DUM-E to chase. The bot gives a delighted trill as he wheels after the ball. Toni chuckles and finally makes her exit, regretting her decision to take the stairs almost immediately.
Steve twists at the waist to see behind him and finds Lady Potts making her way over with Sir Carbonell.
Steve huffs a fond chuckle as he shakes his head then looks around the open living area. “JARVIS, does Toni still like spaghetti and meatballs?”
“Those are my guns,” she tells the man next to her, barely keeping the bile from coming up her throat, “how did they get my guns?”
Apparently unperturbed by the dramatic display, Tony reaches across the table to give Hawk’s shoulder two pats, short and clinical as he says, “There, there. Let it all out, Master Archer.”
“Hey, listen.” State stalls her departure with a hand on her elbow, patting her arm. “Take it easy okay? I think I got the board right where we want them.”
He quickly got dressed and definitely broke several speeding laws on the ride over to the Malibu hospital Howard’s been checked in to. He finds a free spot in the visitor’s parking lot and jogs his way over to the lobby. Edwin Jarvis is waiting for him there.
Toni is barely aware the Christine follows her as she makes her way back to the red carpet. She stays a couple of steps away as Toni walks up to where Obi is still working the crowd of reporters. She gets as close as she can and taps his chest with the photographs, looking into his eyes.
“What the hell did you do to me?” she rasps minutes later, sitting up in her cot in a cold cave after she examined the damage done with the mirror the man handed her.
"Can't I try roughing it, Pete?" Uncle Rhodey's words were followed by a long rip as he tore the front page off.
If Toni stood a bit stupefied after a few seconds (see: minutes) in the wake of Steve’s...peck, we’ll...no one but JARVIS knew and she made sure he deleted any footage of it happening.
Anyways, I’m back, and I’m also sorry for taking more than a month to update!!! Hopefully, I won’t take as long with the next chapter. I have big plans for that one.
Steve doesn’t answer, but his shaky sigh speaks volumes, so Toni silently waves at JARVIS to pull up some screen so she could start fixing the problem with the ice. Toni is absolute shit and comforting and she knows Steve is absolute shit at receiving said comfort, so she does what she does best: pretend everything’s all fine and dandy.
“Must be used to it.” Steve raises his voice so his men can hear him, “Let’s hurry up, Knights! We have a big lunch waiting for us!”
“Are you proud of me now, Coulson?” Steve whispers at his reflection in the full-length mirror, tucking the tails of his long-sleeved shirt into the waist of his pants before pulling down his cloak from the hook next to the mirror. He spreads the fabric across his messy bed and promptly retrieves his sword and belt from the closet to be wrapped. The last thing he needs is any unnecessary noise waking the servants or, gods forbid, Coulson.
Ana was near tears as she gave Toni an earful about disappearing and Toni was properly chastised, wrapping her bony arms around Ana's neck fiercely when the woman swooped her into a hug, promising to let Ana and Jarvis know the next time she wanted to go somewhere.
The guards at the door salutes before pushing the door open as another guard on the other side announced, “His Majesty’s Knights have returned!”
Several times over the ten years of the war, Steve had fought side-by-side with Rhodes who became a Captain of a special task squadron several years before Steve. No one really knew what Rhodes’ team did, but he worked a lot with Natasha who always had nothing but good things to say about the other Captain and his men, so the common speculation about their squad is that they dealt with the behind-the-scenes battles that Natasha thrives on.
He would’ve been the biggest fool in the world if he never noticed Toni’s crush on him, especially since Peggy and Howard loved to tease him about it. It was supposed to go away, which was why Steve never let it bother him. She was twelve for chrissake! She was supposed to go on to find other boys her age to have a crush on, then turn fourteen and realize boys are disgusting, then turn eighteen and find herself a decent boyfriend that Steve would watch like a hawk, before finally getting married at twenty-one and rule the world.
“There’s still approximately two hours, thirteen minutes and six seconds left, Miss,” her AI interjects. “Might I suggest taking that nap now?”
“That Toni knows what’s she’s doing. She’s a grown ass woman, Steve, who’s been in this business for almost two decades now.” Howard exhales harshly on his end. “This isn’t anything new. She’s been to Afghanistan before.”
Tony is quick to recover, bating ridiculously long lashes at him. “My, my, Captain, so forward. Has no one ever told you it’s quite rude to ask a gentleman for his age?”
The door clanks open and Toni eyes her companion warily as he quietly urges her to raise her arms as he was doing. She follows, apprehension making her stomach twist and turn as a group of heavily armed men spill into the room. Their weapons are frighteningly familiar.
Pepper blinks, clearly thrown but quickly recovers. "Once or twice when you got absolutely shit-faced."
Natasha takes up the empty spot next to him, careful to keep some distance between them but settling a hand on his shoulder. It takes Bucky back to another time in their lives when they were still just two souls trying to survive and finding some form of comfort in the other. But that's not them anymore, definitely not him, and Bucky has to clench his hands to stop himself from reaching up to tangle his hand with hers instead.
“Shall I store this in the Stark Industries’ central data base?” JARVIS queries as she moves away from her desk to stand before the table.
Steve doesn’t mention the fact that Toni’s grip tightens around his hand and lets Toni ramble, “It’s not puss it’s an inorganic plastic discharge. It’s from the device not from my body- gently lift the copper wire, okay? Okay. You are probably way over qualified for this, so...copper wire.”
Peggy chuckles and Steve smiles at the memory. Yeah, Toni looked like she was doing her best impression of a lobster at the day ended and she was miserable the whole way home. It was good memory. He hands over the first plate to Peggy.
“I heard he didn’t even send a messenger ahead of him,” Hawk says behind him, quiet enough that the servant will not hear. “Just–
However, before he could say another word, the door opens a sliver and and Rhodey pokes his head out, affectively blocking the view into the room. He looks at Steve then the private and says, “It’s fine, the Captain can come in.”
She’s not young anymore and she could hear her Daniel gently admonishing her for spending yet another night in her office.
They don't say anything else after that so Steve fiddles around with the radio for a bit until he finds the sports station. By the time they arrive at the restaurant Peggy chose for them, the team Steve had decided to root for was ahead of their opponent by a mile. He gets out first, then walks around to open the driver's door for Toni, taking in the Italian bistro. It seemed so at odds with the hustle and bustle of Malibu but it also worked. Toni takes his proffered hand as she slides out from behind the wheel, thanking him quietly, before passing off the car keys to a waiting valet. Bistro the place may be, it was still Malibu, so of course, there'd be a valet. The hostess behind the podium recognized them right away, or at least, Toni, as she quickly comes forward to greet them and offered to lead them to their "usual table."
"That's cuz you came around late in the game, Wilson." Dad rolled his eyes, and Peter chose to ignore the way Pops seemed to have stiffen.
Steve feels like an outsider as he watches Potts panic even more, and Toni calmly guiding her assistant with what to do next-
He had waved her gratitude away because Steve’s just as bad as receiving thanks as she is. “If you’re really thankful, eat. And if you want anything g cooked, lemme know. I’ll see if I can do it, or order it as takeout.”
Sniffling, Peter bends down to take her into his arms and nuzzles into her hair when her little arms wrap around his neck and continues to watch the ceremony. His chest heaves with a barely concealed sob.
Steve tips his head to the side, not exactly conceding, but not disagreeing either. He can’t make up his mind about this right now, not yet. Howard understands, because despite their estrangement, they were friends first, and Steve owes the man his life. So, Steve doesn’t reply, Howard doesn’t stay to watch him go as he speeds out of the garage and into the dawn.
Toni waves them both off. “Don’t worry this is perfectly safe. Last time I did this was in a less sanitary environment with trigger happy terrorists watching, so I say this is a huge step up. Come on, Pep. Cap, you can hold my hand if it’ll make you feel better.”
-and makes sure he doesn’t squeeze Toni’s hand too hard, body coiled like a spring and ready to jump into action as the heart monitor beeps faster and faster, then, a sigh of relief as Potts successfully connects the new reactor and Toni goes lax in the chair.
It reminds her of the time she and her family went to vacation at one of their lake houses. They brought Steve who had just been defrosted for two months, hoping it will help sooth the man just a little. Toni remembers being very fascinated by him (still is), and as a ten-year-old she felt maybe she could do something for him. So, she begged and begged her dad and the Jarvises for a picnic/swim party. They agreed and within a few hours, they had a table set out near the lake dock with finger foods to tide their hunger while Edwin manned the grill with Steve. Toni could hardly contain herself as Ana helped her tie up her watermelon-themed swim suit and almost jumped into the lake if she hadn’t remembered her plan all along.
Toni grins, patting Steve on the arm because if she doesn't she might hug him and that's a big no-no right now. "You will definitely regret this. Go take a shower."
Steve looks up from typing a reply to Peggy about lunch as he caught sight of Toni. He pushed off the side of the car from where he'd been leaning against it, and asks, "How'd it go?"
“The second convoy lost contact with them ten minutes after they left the testing site, and when they caught up, everything was still burning, but Toni was gone. I already told SHIELD, and the Air Force is also on it, but Steve...I need your help. I need you to be out there looking for her as well.” Another sob. “Please.”
“Yes,” Peggy nods. “I’m going to see Toni later for lunch so I want you to keep an eye on something.”
Steve rubs at his eyes. “It’s the King’s orders, so I certainly think we can. And, you heard Lady Potts. The nobles know this is not the proper way to do things, but these are unprecedented times, and we must do what is needed to keep order across the nations. If that means escorting a lawyer across each capital then I will fulfill my duty as per His Majesty’s order.”
“Boom?” Steve parrots, but Rhodey simply sends him a lazy salute before briskly making his way back up to the castle. Steve shouts after him, “Rhodes! Why would Tony make things go boom?!”
Toni thought as much. "Well, I love you, completely sober and I couldn't ask for a better PA to run my life. JARVIS aside."
Natsha got hers first when she came down to the shop, a mug of coffee in one hand, and hot chocolate in the other. Peter thanked her with a hug, and Dad did so with a kiss to her cheek. She only froze for a second, before she smiled at them both and bid them good bye, leaving with a reminder not to overdo it.
Steve types in a quick reply even though Toni said he doesn’t have to. (He’s a stickler for any AI Toni makes, no matter how rudimentary, sue him.)
do?” He chuckles and continues to stir the pot. “What I did was save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there’s a lot of it left, and it’s headed into your atrial septum.”
Steve takes a sip of his drink and works of dividing the fruit bowl into the plates as Tony says, "Better now. Though, I don't think I've used so much aloe vera gel before. This is definitely worse than that one trip to the beach we did in eighty-six."
Potts sighs and Toni smiles triumphantly before saying, “You’ll be perfectly fine. It’s just like Operation. Just don’t let it touch the socket wall or it goes beep.”
They’ll see it later and smile before video calling their children, content in the knowledge that for now, their war is done.
“It’s not really my place to say,” Phil eventually replies, the furrow between his brows not quite disappearing. “Also, your charge has gone.”
“So Ten Rings,” Steve continues as he lowered himself in one of the seats angled across from Howard’s desk, a cup of coffee in one hand. “What intel do we have on them?”
Dad's laughter was cut short as they stepped into the kitchen and found Pops and Sam sitting at the bar, eating Chinese for lunch and hunched over a tablet.
She nods with false humor and quietly says, "Okay." But the smile drops because it's Rhodey...she'll never be able to hide from him. Not fully. And he can tell. He can always tell.
It’s a testament to how much Steve is holding himself back from making a jab at Stane that he doesn’t hear Toni open the door to Howard’s room, saying, “Toni is doing just fine, Obie.”
Steve narrows his gaze on the pair. He’s not a businessman like the Starks or Stane, but Steve can understand this kind of talk.
Steve also thanks whatever deity is listening for the music and chatter going about because he can focus on that instead of having to consciously stop himself from straining his ear to hear what Toni and Potts are talking about. As it is, however, he can still make out muted words every now and then. Still, it means Steve has no idea why Toni comes back in a couple minutes later, looking distracted as she makes a beeline back to the bar. (He ignores the warm bloom of relief that courses from his chest.) Coulson isn't there anymore so Steve dutifully follows her, only sparing Potts' silhouette a parting glance.
He wanted nothing more than to take a long, long, long nap until he misses finals. Yeah, that sounded good.
“Alright.” Steve nods to himself, his loot carefully tucked under an arm, while he carries his riding boots in his free hand.
The group dispersed and Rhodey taps her arm with another chuckle. Toni tries to smile. "I'm surprised," he says, taking her in with a quick sweep of his gaze from her head to her toes. "'Swear I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon."
“It’s doesn’t matter,” Toni insists, continuing the discussion, “we own the controlling interest in the company.”
They all turned to see Potts speed-walking towards them, looking a bit harried if Steve were to go by the other man’s rumpled clothes and wind-blown hair. “The office is in a bit of a hurricane right now,” he says as he comes to a stop around their little huddle.
She caught sight of the blonde out of the corner of her eyes after putting in Pepper’s order and tacking her own at the end. Out of all the people she could’ve bumped into at this venue, it has to be the last woman she fooled around with before her stint in Afghanistan.
“Good.” Howard nods, relief clear in the action before he reaches for her hand again and says, “Don’t tell anyone else. Any trace that this exists in you? You get rid of it. Okay?”
Honestly, napping’s suddenly the last thing on Toni’s mind right now, because her godmother’s coming, she needs to replace her old reactor ASAP, fix the damage she’s done by shutting down the weapon’s division–
Toni’s gaze remains on him, hard and cold. “Yeah, Steve, that’s a little hard to swallow considering you made it very clear you wanted nothing to do with me—with us Starks.”
The thrusters slowly power down and Toni returns to the ground. If she nearly landed on her ass at the last second, well, no one had to know and she could just have JARVIS edit the footage.
The panic returns tenfold as Toni claws at the gauze, ripping it apart until she was staring at the mangled mess that had become of her chest and a crude, silver device that sat right in the middle of it all.
Steve tells himself to breathe. Pause. Reassess the situation. Remove his personal ties from the situation. His next exhale is steady and short. The nerves in his fingertips stopped tingling. The strength came back to his legs.
But then Toni’s squeezing his hand one more time before releasing her hold and starts to pull the wires off of her chest. “Anyway.”
“I need a scotch. I’m starving,” Toni tells the bartender before turning to Phil. “Agent. Fury let you out to play tonight?”
Toni’s mouth drops open in indignation even if her eyes told him she was proud of him for the joke. It doesn’t stop her from punching his arm though. “Jerk.”
His phone rings. It’s Fury. “Captain, I’m gonna need you to stay in California, after all.” Steve can feel the Quinjet turning around. “Carter’s orders. She said she’d come over as soon as possible to debrief you.”
Rhodes pats his head, flattening the curls there. “You’ve stopped growing a while ago, Tony. Isn’t it about time you accept the fact?”
“What’s up, Cap?” Nat arches a red brow at him. The tight worry lines that had been around her eyes when they got Bucky onboard had disappeared. She was the Black Widow once more. “That was Stark?”
She saw them and waved before stumbling to her knees, holding out a peace sign as they came around to land. Rhodey was already rushing towards her even before the helo finished landing. Steve wasn’t too far behind him, though he hung back as Rhodey wrapped his arms around Toni, fierce but mindful of her injuries which Steve took inventory of.
"Hell no," Rhodey shakes his head sharply. "This has nothing to do with you being a woman and everything to do with the fact that you've been held captive by a terrorist group in a cave for three months. You forget that I was there in the room with you, Toni. Okay?"
Toni smiles, exhaustion clear in the action but still gorgeous as ever. Then her gaze flickers towards Steve. “Is that...” she points at him, smile going confused, “...Steve?”
“You don’t want to keep it?” Steve frowns and hands over the device to Potts when he held out his hand.
There’s already coffee brewing in the pot when he arrived, no doubt JARVIS’ doing with the help of the house bots. Steve quickly gets to work on breakfast as soon as he finished gulping down two bottles of Gatorade. He scrambles some eggs while the bread toasted, slathering one slice with butter and the other with blueberry jam, then when Toni’s tray was ready, he whipped up a salami sandwich to go with his mountain of scrambled eggs and brought them all down to the workshop with a huge mug of coffee and another bottle of Gatorade.
Toni tilts her head at the red and gold of the suit and smiles before checking the time. Then she types out,
The man continues to translate for the other who waves his arms around like some kind of showman. “He wants you to build a missile...the Jericho missile that you demonstrated.”
Stane’s jovial smile slowly morphs into a grim line as he sighs. “I sent the pizza to your place. If I knew you were here I would’ve just brought it.”
Leaning forward, Steve crosses his arms on the handlebar and drops his head forward with yet another sigh. He can’t leave. Not now, and not like this.
Tony snorts into his tankard before he starts to violently cough, a fist pounding against the table while Rhodes slaps a hand against his back.
So, now that the King had called them back, Steve was more than ready to go. Of course, he was expecting this, after Peggy told them last night that Prince Anthony was returning. But not even the reminder that Steve would most likely finally be meeting the
Steve had been grateful at the time. His Majesty had rewarded all of them with homes after all, so he needed to get everything sorted out, but also, he just wanted to sleep. And sleep he did as soon as Coulson told him everything was in tiptop condition and he shouldn’t worry about running the household just yet.
Tony leans to the side to see around Steve’s torso and says, “Nope, I’m just always annoyingly charming.”
Howard chuckled, a bit strained, but wraps his own arms around Toni's little frame, feeling as if he was finally doing something right for the first time since his daughter was born.
Toni almost does a spit-take. She, instead, chokes and graciously hacks up a lung as Steve pounds on her back. She wipes at her chin and looks up to the blond. “Peggy’s coming?”
Steve stares at the tablet in his hands, haunched over the device where he sat in the back of the Quinjet Fury had sent to pick him up from California. It’s been two hours at most since Steve saw Toni off into the care of her friends and family. He should’ve known she would’ve pulled something like this. He only wished it hadn’t come with such a dangerous repercussion.
Steve nodded. “Your ass is wet from leaning on the ledge,” he pointed out and Rhodey cursed and pushed away from the wet counter. It was a little bit petty, but Steve couldn’t help himself. Tony really was rubbing off on him.
“I’ll take it as a no, you’re not coming?” It sometimes irked Steve that Tony was incapable of giving a straight answer to any given question. He always had to weasel his way around it, even if it wasn’t a big deal.
“Mr. Stark, if you have a moment, could we maybe talk about Peter for a second? Privately?” She gestured to the living room as she said this and Tony stood up.
When Steve said ‘doll,’ it was sort of endearing, regardless of how forever tainted the word was in his head. Tony felt his face heat up, but whether or not it was from the godawful memory of his father or the change in tone Steve’s voice had whenever he talked to Morgan was unknown.
Steve looked up from Morgan’s plate to see the exchange, his fork and knife stilling in his hands. He looked between the father and daughter, taking in their physical similarities. Everything about Morgan was Tony, down to the colouring of her eyes and her hair to the curve of her nose. She had Pepper’s eyes shape-wise and the light freckles scattered around her face were also definitely her mother’s, but other than that she was practically Tony’s carbon copy.
. After Pepper. Tony didn’t have it in him to tell her that he highly doubted he would ever stop looking at time like that again.
He threw himself against the door twice before it broke open. “Captain Rogers, your ribs!” He heard Peter shout but didn’t turn back. He pulled the collar of his t-shirt over his nose as engine fumes poured out the door.
It was widely known that Tony Stark never shut up. Even when he was nervous or pissed off or drunk or depressed, he was always talking and making quips. He had been a nervous rambler since he was a child and it wasn’t a habit anyone thought he’d likely drop.
As they got there, Steve frowned immediately. He looked down at the garage door to see smoke coming from beneath the door.
.” Dr. Perry has assured him that it as normal to measure time and holidays in ‘how many days/weeks/months/years’ since a loved one has died. The substantial markers like the anniversary of the death would almost always be a big day, she said, but eventually he’d stop looking at every day like it was
“Daddy!” She catapulted herself off of the couch where she was sitting and ran over to her father. He bent down to pick her up and buried his face with her shoulder. “Daddy, I missed you.” She started to cry and he squeezed her tighter.
“Mr. Stark, please don’t take any offense to this, but I think maybe it would be good if you showered… Just so, y’know, you would feel a little bit more… fresh.” Mr. Stark actually let out a cynical little laugh and Peter almost did a double take.
Steve could hear all of this, obviously, but didn’t think to intervene. He doubted his opinion held any weight in the eyes of anyone, especially Tony’s closest friends, when it came to what was best for Tony. He poured the eggs into a frying pan on the stove and searched for a spatula in the nearest drawer.
“Nat’s shoes are too big to ever really fill,” Clint nodded and Laura rubbed his shoulders. He gave a thankful look towards his wife and grabbed her hand.
“No, sorry, it’s just.. No, Captain America won’t let me have any bacon…” He gave Steve a joking glare to which Steve rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I know… Okay, love you too. Okay. Bye.” He hung up the phone and Steve picked up the pans to bring over to the dining room.
“Look, I could bump up anyone on the Board and I’m sure they’d do a,” Tony looked for the right word, “decent job  - provided they don’t make a murder bot and try to kill me or something. But I’m asking you because I trust you and I trust your judgement. Everyone already knows you as War Machine and they all love you. You can still be War Machine, too, obviously. I know it’s not really your style, but I think you’d be damn good at it.”
“Well, when Daddy would tell stories about Spider-man, he told me that Spider-man’s real name was Peter. He’d always get kind of sad and tell me that Peter was like my brother, except he wasn’t actually my brother.”
“Yeah, squirt. Before… everything happened.” She nodded at him and methodically removed each piece of tape from the packages, careful not to rip the paper. She put each piece of wrapping paper aside like it was a gift of its own. She stared down at the presents for a long time before looking back up at her father.
Peter stood awkwardly in the corner of her room as Happy helped her to get ready for bed, assisting her in brushing her teeth and tucking her in.
“I’ll grab him, go and get the others,” Steve choked out as he picked up the man bridal style, ignoring the way his ribs stung.
“Because Daddy feels like shit right now, so just be a good girl and go to bed,” Tony snapped. The heaviness of the day was getting to him.
He took the job. Within a week, Rhodey was “begrudgingly” doing press to officially announce his start as CEO of Stark Industries (though Tony knew he secretly loved all the attention.) The announcement was good for business and stock prices - which had dipped down with the uncertainty that came with Pepper’s death and Tony’s disappearance from the public eye - went back up to higher than they were before.
Even Hank Pym, a man who had seemed to have a distaste for him since birth, had shaken his hand. “Stark, if you ever need anything… don’t hesitate to call,” he said with a nod. Tony knew it was obviously slightly forced, but hey, it was the thought that counts.
He felt a hand brush over his own and Steve grabbed it. It froze, as if caught. The fingers slowly grasped back and Steve didn’t have to look over to know Tony was staring at him.
As selfish as it was, Steve sort of glad that construction was delayed, because after his old room was rebuilt, what purpose did he have hanging around and living in Tony’s house? He wasn’t ready to leave, to go back and be Captain America again. He was enjoying his life for the first time since he got out of the ice, maybe even ever. There was no war to fight that couldn’t be fought without him now, no sense of impending doom.
As he got closer to the man, he saw Tony twitch, realizing who was there. He didn't take his eyes off the sky, even a
“You wouldn’t mind staying in Morgan’s room over the holidays while we have everyone over, would you, kid?” Steve asked him.
“я покончу с тобой,” Morgan did her best Nat impression and struck a fighter pose. Steve laughed, despite having absolutely no idea what she had just said.
It had been during their time at Avengers Tower and Steve had loved it, even if he wouldn’t fully admit to it. They’d never gotten around to watching any others because of a last-minute mission that ruined Tony’s attempts at team bonding over the holidays and instead thrust them back into battle. Pepper had been really pissed off over that one when he didn’t show up until after New Year’s Day.
Poor Tony :((( I’ll probably have the next chapter up within the next couple of days. Also, I considered writing what happened with Steve returning the stones, but decided against it because I wanted this chapter up sooner. If you guys would be interested in me writing a tie-in one-shot detailing it though, then let me know!!
Steve shifted slightly and saw who could only be Tony, walking across the house to the entryway and slipping on his shoes. Steve sat up and wiped his eyes with his hands before witnessing the other man quietly open and close the front door, slipping out into the night. He waited for a moment before standing up and stretching. He took a few steps before the floorboards betrayed him, squeaking under his weight.
“Ouch, Rogers, ouch,” Tony slapped a hand over his heart in mockery. The demotion back to using last names did sting Steve a little bit, if he were to be perfectly honest.
“So, uh… today’s a busy day, right? With the stones… and everything,” Rhodey looked around the table.
It hadn’t felt right decorating the house or carving pumpkins or anything, so Tony let Steve deal with all that. Tony had remembered from their short time living together that Steve was surprisingly very unfestive given the fact that his whole shtick made him appear as the human embodiment of the 4th of July. Despite this, Steve had still carved jack o'lanterns with Morgan and Peter and even bought a bag of candy for the very improbable occasion that any kids would come out to their highly secluded home.
It had been three days since the funeral and five days since the third snap. Tony had resumed his position in his office almost immediately and it was agreed that it might just be best to leave him alone, at least for a while.
“I’m not… like that, anymore. I ‘learnt my lesson’ or whatever so everyone can just stop with the kid gloves, alright?”
Steve sat on the slightly damp grass and pulled his legs up to his chest, looking very much like a child. It was quiet; both men admiring the stars, both men trying not to overthink what they’d witnessed together up there.
“I know, okay? I was in a bad place and I wasn’t thinking straight. But, hey, look at me,” he tilted Peter’s chin towards him so the teenager was looking at him in the eye, “I promise I’m not gonna do anything like that ever again.”
“I hope that-” Tony cut himself off in order to properly phrase what he was going to say. “I hope that when you’re here… you feel like we want you as Steve.”
Sam and Bucky has dipped out in order to do the latter and said their goodbyes earlier. Sam had tried to convince Steve to come for approximately a minute and a half before getting completely shut down. Tony was secretly quite pleased with this. Instead, Steve opted for cooking dinner for the remaining guests they had.
One night after dinner as Steve was scrubbing dishes in the kitchen he heard what sounded almost like singing and froze. He looked around and saw Peter sitting at the dinner table ‘live-tweeting’ as he put it.
This isn’t to bash Pepper at all, just so you know, I love her. But the first time I saw endgame, I thought of how interesting it would be to look into how Tony would cope if it would have been Pepper who died instead of him.
“Um, yeah, I guess…” Peter shrugged. “We haven’t really talked much about everything and I don’t know, I mean it’s pretty obvious that it’s really weighing on him.”
was writing an article on Rhodey entitled ‘Rhodes to Success’ which Tony thought was the funniest thing he’d ever heard. Rhodey did not share Tony’s amusement.
Rhodey hesitated for a moment before throwing his arms in the air. “Fine! I’ll think about it and give you an answer later. Happy?”
It had taken surprisingly little to get Tony to agree to it considering the alternative. The therapist was something that Tony had to concede was probably long over-due anyway. It was nice to talk about everything. Meaning
“I know you know… but I just thought someone should say it either way.” Peter stood up and grabbed the two dirty bowls. Tony watched as he put them in the sink, rinsing out the bit of melted ice cream in the bottom of each.
Steve was supposedly sleeping on one of the couches in Tony’s living room when he heard a door click close. He opened one eye, scanning the room for any movement. He saw Peter sleeping on the couch opposite him, dead asleep. Happy and Rhodey were each in a guest bedroom - having been the two guests who were more comfortable both with staying in Tony’s house and with being a little demanding. Morgan was upstairs in her own bedroom, hopefully sleeping soundly.
As Peter followed the two adults into the living room, he got the feeling he would probably have to be the one to mediate their discussion. It wasn’t that Aunt May and Mr. Stark didn’t get along persay, because usually it was totally fine. It was just that with everything that had gone on recently, Peter knew that neither of them had the most patience or tact at the moment.
“Sorry, Captain Rogers,” Peter shrugged a little and headed likely back to his own room, or the ‘Spider-Cave’ as Tony liked to call it. “See you for dinner!”
“I recorded her a message,” Tony said several minutes later. “I thought I was going to die fighting.. him. I thought it was going to be me, so I recorded her a little something that she and Morgan could watch back every now and then when they especially missed me and wanted to hear my voice again or something.”
Logically, Tony knew this already. Just like Tony logically knew that he wouldn’t have been mad at Pepper for moving on if it had been him who had died. It was more than that. It was every small reminder that she hasn’t there, from her untouched clothes in their room to the curtains in the kitchen that she picked out. Most of all, he saw her in Morgan which was by far the most painful.
Tony, usually the center of every conversation, spent the whole night gazing off into the distance as his friends and former colleagues exchanged stories and goofed around. He smiled along and nodded when it was appropriate, but Steve saw his smile fall as soon as the attention was shifted away and his face became blank.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Steve looked at him with purpose. Tony’s lip twitched upwards and he nodded back.
However, in the wake of Pepper’s death, he hadn’t said a word to anyone. It was a complete radio silence. The door to Tony’s office had remained locked for the past twenty-four hours. Rhodey wasn’t surprised, considering he knew there was a bathroom en-suite to the office and Tony was used to not eating for days at a time. Rhodey, Happy, and Steve had all pleaded with him to open the door to no avail.
“Hey!” Tony protested, mouth full of the admitted-delicious waffles. “You know,” Tony swallowed, “I don’t appreciate my daughter and Captain America in cohorts against me.”
“Look who’s returned from the dead,” Happy exclaimed, then immediately regretted his word choices as he saw Tony’s shoulders tense and his face scrunched up a little.
actually visited the tower (mostly just to mess around with Tony in the labs, but still.) It was strange to be in a crowd with collectively most powerful people in the entire world - the entire universe actually, but Peter tried not to overthink it or visibly geek out. Aunt May was somewhere in the crowd, but stood back to give Peter some space.
Forty-five minutes later, Tony returned downstairs fully shaved and showered. His eyes were still in their continuous state of ‘red and puffy’ but other than that he looked almost refreshed. He was wearing a fresh t-shirt and pajama bottoms and was drying off his wet hair with a towel.
“Yeah, we are, doll,” Steve ruffled her hair and suddenly Tony was reminded of his father. He’d call practically every woman he’d ever met ‘doll’ as he blatantly flirted with them, even in front of his wife. It had pissed Tony off so badly as a teenager to see his mother sit idly by while Howard made advances on every waitress, secretary, or intern he could set his eyes on.
It turned out it was actually Steve who had asked her what she wanted to be for Halloween. The four of them had been watching a movie one day and there were kids trick-or-treating on the screen. He asked Morgan and Peter what they wanted to be, to which Peter shrugged and said he hadn’t thought about it, and Morgan started bouncing up and down in excitement.
“What kind of teenager is fully okay with being kicked out of his personal space for nearly a week?” Tony crossed his arms.
“Tony,” Rhodey pleaded, “we need to talk about the funeral arrangements.” A quiet sob was all he got as a response. Rhodey rubbed his hands over his face and walked back to the living room. Happy sat on the couch, Morgan on his lap playing with a children’s circuit board set. She was building what appeared to be some sort of fan contraption, her tongue poking out from her lips in concentration.
“No, don’t you dare ‘Tony’ me,” he looked at his daughter who looked somewhere between immensely displeased and intrigued as to why her father was having a freak out. “I don’t want my four-year-old daughter in a suit prancing around and pretending to be an Avenger. Uh-uh, no way.”
He stopped when the door closed, listening to the crickets chirping for a moment before looking for Tony. He saw a figure sitting in a tiny chair, staring up at the clear sky. Steve made his way over, his hands in his pockets. He realized as he stepped off the porch that he wasn’t wearing any shoes, but he didn’t care enough to go back inside and find his sneakers.
So, he just avoided the topic, keeping his conversations with May as short as possible and pushing back the meeting she wanted to have with Peter and Mr. Stark as far as he could. He just needed a little time.
On Friday afternoons, Happy would come to the house and have dinner with Tony, Steve, Peter, and Morgan and then drive Peter back to Queens to spend his weekends with May. Happy would be there to drive him back on Monday mornings and thus, a routine was formed.
“Anyway, Daddy said that Spider-Pete had to go away but he never said where. Then, you came a few days ago and Mommy was gone but you were back and I just knew it was you.” Morgan smiled a little sadly. “Even though Mommy isn’t here, I’m very glad that I have my brother back, Petey.”
“They’re more than welcome to come,” Tony backtracked a little, knowing that Steve had picked up on his hesitance.
“Whenever Banner gets here,” he responded. Bucky and Sam were also coming over for what they deemed ‘moral support.’ Knowing them, they’d want lunch first so it would probably be some time afterwards. He said his to Rhodey who nodded at him and turned back to Happy.
He hadn’t made any decisions about what he was going to do with the company now that Pepper wasn’t.. able to run it. He was still the owner and still owned enough of the shares that he had the full ability to appoint a new CEO with little input from the board. If it wasn’t for the fact that the company couldn’t function without a CEO for the few years until Peter became of legal age, he probably would just leave it to him. That was the long term plan, anyway. Peter, then once Morgan finished school they would work out some sort of arrangement between the two of them to co-run the company.
“No! That’s not what I meant at all!” It was sort of what he meant, yes. “I just mean that maybe you should shower for you so that you would feel less like…”
They were right, because after a few minutes of gentle knocking and pleading, the door clicked open and Peter walked in. The first thing Peter noticed was the very unpleasant smell within the room. It smelled somewhere between must and something that could only be described as the smell of depression.
As guilty as he was about it, it was secretly a relief to him that she had more of his features then hers. The features she inherited from her mother hurt him enough as it was. If she had been born a strawberry blonde with blue eyes it might have just broken him to see her everyday.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! The next one will be up later today or tomorrow because it’s pretty much already written. After that, we’re out of the holiday stuff and into some exciting things I have planned out.
“I’m here because I know what it’s like to lose someone you care a lot about, and I thought - I thought I could maybe help a little,” Peter shrugged, realizing how stupid he sounded. He was just a kid, it’s not like he was gonna magically bring Pepper back to life or turn Mr. Stark’s life around. He scratched the back of his neck and looked around.
“Hey, hey, it’s gonna be okay. Besides, I have too many responsibilities to deal with, I can’t kill myself,” Tony quipped but it fell heavy in the air. Tony gave him a squeeze. “It’s gonna be okay, Pete, I swear.”
Halloween had come and Tony had yet to discuss it with Morgan since his little meltdown. Steve had taken Morgan costume-shopping one day, he knew, but what they’d picked out he didn’t bother enquiring about.
“I’m not saying it’s too small or anything, but how are we going to do this?” Steve looked down at T-chart he had drawn on the notepad he was holding and frowned.
“Alright.” She looked indifferent at this new information and Steve wondered how much she actually knew of his history with her father. He assumed not much.
“Yes, and the right thing is going with your aunt and finishing your education.” He was stern and Peter didn’t like it. “C’mere, kid.” Tony opened his arms up to Peter and Peter couldn’t stop himself from embracing his mentor.
Rhodey came back with Tony’s coffee and Steve put his head down again, cutting up the rest of Morgan’s bacon.
She wiped her tears on his sleeve and snuggled into him. “Hi,” she looked up at him. “Happy says you’re my uncle. Is that true?” Steve blinked, and stuttered for a moment.
Peter seemed to be settling in quite well, he spent most of his time working on his homework or tinkering with Tony (not in the garage - which had not been touched since The Incident - but instead in the workspace in Tony’s office.) Steve offered to help him with his homework early on, but took one look at one of his chemistry worksheets and realized he was way out of his league. Peter did take his offer of help when it came to English and History, both of which Steve prided himself at excelling in.
” Bucky repeats again, waving the stick he’d been using to poke the fire at Hawk who was sat one person away from Bucky, making Sam eye the piece of wood with concern as he was the one most likely to get hit should Bucky’s hand slip. “It’s been, what, a month, more than a month, and that’s the best you can come up with?”
If it were possible, Toni’s gaze turns colder as she quirks a dark brow at him. “Oh? So you didn’t walk out of our lives like we meant nothing to you and never once looked back?”
Once they were all situated in a triangle around the table, a server comes up and sets the glasses of water Steve ordered on the table, one for Toni and the other for him, followed by an assorted fruit bowl, three small plates, and three small forks. They thank him and the man gives a small bow before saying he will bring them the menus.
It's not far from her house, actually, the spot she wants to visit, and Toni can tell it throws Steve off when she tells him parks off the side of the road a mile from the mansion. But ever the soldier, he follows her wordlessly when she leads him down a well-worn, but easy to miss, path. It's a bit of a hike and not at all made easy by the afternoon Malibu sun, but Toni trudges on, letting the memories of another time she's gone down this same path wash over her. When they reach the cliff, the view still takes her breath away.
Steve nods. “Makes me wonder why I put the Valkyrie down in the first place if Hyrda was just going to pop up all over the globe after that. We’ll need to put together a strike team soon and start going after these bases.”
The kiss he gave her on the forehead was nothing new. It’s a thing he’s done since her eleventh birthday. But this one was no doubt the most heartbreaking one they’ve shared.
"I'll take it in my office." Howard got to his feet and dropped another kiss to Toni's forehead and says, "Want to come back down to the 'shop later and see if we can make a solar watch from scratch?"
In the silence that followed, Howard kept his eyes on Toni's work as she finished up with the watch, arm perched behind her to act as a backrest and to keep her close. They've known for two years now that Toni was smart, a genius even, though it's not official yet, but Howard doesn't think it needs to be official. He knows Toni is smarter than him, and that's all the confirmation he needs.
Fury raises a brow, one side of his mouth quirking up. “And by 'keep an eye' you mean, oversee? Another pet project?”
It was a space still completely foreign to Steve even after being back for over a month and he doubts it will start growing on him anytime soon.
She’s been cleaned up nicely, with all her nicks and cuts nicely disinfected, her shoulders wrapped in gauze, and her reactor carefully hidden by a dark camisole underneath the button-up shirt Rhodey managed to find her along with a pair of suit pants and a matching jacket.
Her hand went to her chest covering her heart, which she could vaguely feel through her reactor, beating at a million miles a second. She tried to catch her breath and slow her heart by slowly counting as calmly as she could, but she couldn't get Barnes' angry face out of her head. His image crumbled Toni, as she bent over trying to catch her breath, but it was at the edge of her grasp and she was left heaving.
Toni could feel her muscles contract as if to jump into action at any second. Even though her muscles felt like they were on fire, her body started to move on its own, knowing he would kill her if he got the chance. He wanted to kill her—she knew that for sure. She could feel it. She wanted to say it was because she left him on that roof and treated him like crap (that he was), but it felt like something else. But whatever it was, he shouldn't take it personally, as she treated everyone like crap—even when she didn't mean to. He wasn't special. "Yea, I don't buy it," she uttered, as she glanced around for Steve. They had gotten separated as she went from suit to suit.
"Yup, we're best friends," Toni responded. She could feel his eyes on her, and she did her best not to pay any attention. "We're already giggling about nails and boys."
The door to her hospital room flew open and a man in military uniform walked in. He was also wearing a 1940's uniform, which added to Toni's theory. Though this could be some giant joke, she wouldn't understand the point of that. Why would anyone try and make someone think they were in the past? What purpose would that solve?
It only lasted a second before Steve lifted his head up and gently pushed her hands away. "I think he gets it."
The Super Soldier laughed as he pulled back. He could feel his heart flutter at the sound of her voice. She was still upset, but her mood was improving. But he wished he knew what had gotten her into this mood. "I got you."
Toni let out a chuckle. "That's a game you'll all lose," she stated. "C'mon, Jones. Let's see that hand. Can you beat my four of a kind?" She put on her evil smile. Yes, he might beat her, but the chances were low. She remembered all the cards that were played and she knew what was left.
After getting over her shock of him pulling her into his arms, she relaxed into his warm arms. "Steve," she mumbled back, thinking she had sent him to his death. There was no way that she could deal with his death so soon after Bucky, and he wasn't supposed to die.
Toni let out a groan as the few raindrops became a downpour, and she was soaked within seconds. Her hair gained ten pounds as it was suddenly glued to her. Her clothes also gained a few pounds as they stuck to her body. Within mere seconds, she was shaking, and she knew she would be sick the next day. She would be a beast in a few hours, and it was at this moment that she wondered why she decided a run was a good idea. Toni was sore, soak, and cold, and she was feeling worst with each passing second.
Phillips smiled, sadly. "They're just copies of them, which I had made you. Perks of being a Colonel." He paused as he looked at them. "I thought you would like them."
. No woman should hold a bruise from a loved one: accident or not. So why Steve might not have meant it, Clint was never going to forget it, and no doubt, Natasha would as well. It wasn't like they didn't care or like Steve. They did, but he was super Soldier, while Toni was a naïve genius, who put others first. Sure, Toni could take out enemy base like it was nothing, but she was overly judgmental of herself and had no self-preservation. That woman would die of starvation before she would leave her lab. Shit, Barton didn't know how she was still alive. She was always second in her mind's eyes.
Her blood started to boil as she thought about how pathetic she was. Was that all she was good for nowadays? Just someone to pity? "Listen, buddy. I don't need your jacket," she snapped.
That took her breath away, because that was the last thing that she had expected. She wasn't quite sure what she was expecting, but that wasn't it. She wasn't sure what he was judging her genus on, because he only saw her reactor and heard her smart ass mouth. Maybe that was enough. Whatever it was; it didn't matter. What matter was getting away, though she was beginning to wonder if she could.
Feeling his own heart race, Steve didn't know what Toni was trying to get at, but he remained quiet, waiting for her to finish. He knew she needed to get it out, even if it broke him to hear it. This was all about her father. How could Howard do this to her? He wanted to slug him for that.
Toni forced herself to take a deep breath as she closed her eyes. She tried to picture Steve, focusing on someone who loved her more than anything. "Don't listen to him. He isn't here. He isn't here. Nothing to panic over," she told herself. "It will only get you killed." After a few deep exhales, she slowly wiggled her feet out of the vines, taking great care to not move her feet in wrong away. "Steve is coming. Steve is coming."
Even after everything that Maya had done and everything that happened, Maya held some part of the Toni's heart. Sure, the hold didn't compare to any of the Avengers, Pepper, Rhodes, or Steve's, but it was there. And Maya's death would haunt her like the others. Toni would- if she didn't already- blame herself for Maya's death much like with Bucky's death. No, Maya would never compare to Bucky, and her death wouldn't tear her heart in two, but it hurt.
"I do, and no, you don't," Bucky denies, taking in another deep sniff of Tony's hair. "It calms me."
DON'T KILL ME. Did you think Toni would let Steve have it easy? Nope. Let's hope whatever is in that letter will help.
"What gave it away?" she playfully asked as she mindlessly stared up. "Anyhow, what made you think Steve and I were something?"
she thought. She couldn't believe that she just said that. "Just my term for an idiot," she answered, trying to cover up the fact that she just referenced a TV show that didn't exist yet. It was a good TV show though.
In his thoughts, he failed to take account his surroundings, as he walked into a pile of rocks, kicking them over. They tumbled a few feet, crushing leaves as they went. The leaves, even in the wetness, cracked and crumbed under the weight; they crunched loudly, and there was no doubt that she had heard it, even in the rain.
Her heart was beating fast, and she was unable to catch her breath. "W-what are you going here?" He voice betrayed her in every fashion.
Toni couldn't take Steve's soft tone anymore, and she would rather face his anger. She knew how to handle him then. With his soft tones, she had no idea and wanted nothing more than to bolt, but there was nowhere that she could go. She was trapped. "Why was that?"
She closed her eyes for a second, trying to focus. After a few deep breaths, Toni opened her eyes again and stared off blankly for a few seconds. It wasn't until her vision cleared that she looked around the room, and it was a struggle to do so. She tried to get up on her elbow, but as she tried, she felt two hands on her shoulders pushing her down.
It took a few seconds before Toni's senses kicked in and she could think. She had a fighting chance, considering how many guns were in her hand's reach. As not to draw attention, she slowly reached for a gun, but froze, feeling a knife to her neck. Though she tried to control it, she shuddered visibly as she wondered how someone had gotten behind her without her noticing.
Again, I do not make any money off this. Marvel is own by Disney, who own everything which may or may not include your soul.
"Doesn't matter. You won't get pass me. I'm the security guard." She shot back, giving him a look. She may hold her tongue back while in that room, but she would give Rumlow everything she got.
"Why d-" Just as Toni opened her month to turn him down again, the door to the oddly shape room flew open, silencing her. In came Skully and a few of his soldiers, and Loki disappeared as if he was never there. If she hadn't heard the Stalker say Loki's name, she would have thought she was imaging the fake god the whole time.
He went down faster than he cared to admit, not that he had must time to think. With his mind so focused on the brunette, he had been distracted and unfocused, allowing someone to come up behind him. Unforgivable in his eyes. For that he was angry with himself. How could he allow himself to be weak over a woman?! Over anything. He was a weapon with a weakness, and a weapon with a weakness was worthless. He was worthless. How could he be worth anything if he couldn't produce? He was useless. No wonder his handlers were angry.
"Fuck!" she swore as she burnt her hand on the torch. She suddenly dropped the torch as she waved her burnt hand into the air, trying to cool it. After a few seconds, she remembered that the torch was still on. "FUCK!" Without thinking, Toni reached down to turn it off. She fumbled with it as her hand hurt like hell. She didn't need her tower to burn down. "Fuck!" She cursed as she realized which part of the torch she had grabbed. She had picked up the metal mouth with her already burnt hand. "Fuck!" After she had set down the torch, she stared at her hand for a second, watching it turn deep red before reaching for the first aid. She knew this was her fault as she allowed her mind to drift.
And poor Steve. His memories are really messing with him and it'll just be getting worse for him. By the end, he'll really, really hate time travel. Haha.
Shaking her head, she tried to gain control of her senses, but she couldn't. The water in the glass was mocking her and she needed to get away. Without a second though, she bolted. She could handle the pain, but that glass was affecting her more. The thought of water on her lips brought her back to that state of being tied down and she couldn't bare that.
The lawyer put his hand up, stopping her. "If you wish to return the favor, you can bring me a cup of coffee when you return it," he said, as he turned away from her again.
After a deep sigh, Toni added: "Fine, Spangles, I'm wearing your dog tags and I have no interest in taking them off."
Toni turned to the monitors and gasped. Rogers' group, who were being pushed back, were handling themselves at least, while the second group was not. They appeared to need some help. It shocked Toni that a small base had so many soldiers, but she knew that she shouldn't have been. This base was important. It held some important secrets, which they had been trying to steal.
get it to work, though she had been working on this suit for countless, sleepless nights. If Steve saw her now, he would be giving her one of his famous lectures and forcing her into bed… However, if he climbed in with her, she wouldn't be against the idea. That night that he slept with her was one of the best nights she had ever had. It seemed so long ago now, like some kind of a dream.
"Caring?" she uttered back. Caring wasn't a word that she would use to describe herself. Heartless was good, because it wasn't possible for her to have a heart after what she had done.
"We can be fucks up together," Steve said, closing his eyes. His fingers danced up her arms, trying to comfort her. He hoped he could get her to sleep, which they both needed. He could feel his own self start to drift with her in his arms. Even with everything going on, he never felt more relax than with Toni in his arms. He just wished he could calm her nightmares.
It was a mindless walk as all she could think about was Barnes' death. How he died? Did he die protecting someone? Did he feel anything? Was it a quick death? Did he suffer? Did he have regrets? Did anything pass through his mind as he knew his death was near? Though it was completely selfish, she wondered if he thought of her like she was thinking of him.
Before Toni could say another word, her father pulled her in for a hug, and it wasn't a short one. "I'm glad that you're my daughter, and I'm glad that you are you," he said. "And what Peg said, don't blame yourself, though I know you won't listen."
While Pepper moved from the closet to Toni's dresser, the genius eyed Pepper, her closest dearest friend, in shock. For once, she was speechless, unable to think of something to say. What could she say? She didn't want to start a fight with Pepper, not after everything. She couldn't lose another person in her life, not right now. Not so soon after Bucky and her father.
Forcing her eyes open, she found herself staring at Rogers and she was completely shocked by his appearance. There had to be something wrong, very wrong. "Steve," she uttered, her voice cracking, as the hold on her hand didn't die.
She didn't like seeing him like that. "Steve," she called again as she tried to sit up, but he wouldn't let her.
"You mean when you stole the Mark 2, right?" Pepper corrected, glaring. "That was a legal headache."
Toni shrugged. "A black eye never killed anyone." She allowed Peggy to take her away, because she knew it was better than to fight with her. Even on her good day, Toni didn't stand a chance again Peggy, who could kick anyone's but.
Steve stepped closer to Toni and put a protective arm around her. "We can do this later," he said, in his Captain's voice. It was a voice that very few disobeyed. Toni leaned into his touch, and Steve couldn't help but smile at that. However, it did nothing but drove his protectiveness. He knew Toni could handle herself, but he couldn't help it.
She opened her eyes and stared at him. There still wasn't any anger in his eyes, and she didn't know how to deal with that. Why wasn't he mad at her? "You don't understand. I could've stopped it. I could've stopped it all and Barnes could still be alive." She said. Her attention wandered to IVs in her hands and the urge to pull them out so she could bolt grew.
Her eye sight started to focus and she was able to make out the man. He was an average size man, and if she had to guess, he was slightly over 6 feet. "Who are you," she asked; her voice quaked as she spoke. She was barely able to get her words out.
Toni Stark had been tortured before; it wasn't anything new, but this was different. When she was held hostage in the desert being tortured to build weapons, it was nothing like this. They wanted her alive, so she could build the weapons, but this time, she wasn't so sure. Schmidt had said he didn't want to hurt her, but she doubted he would care if she was. He didn't want her to build him anything; he had Zola for that. He just wanted to study her reactor dead or alive, which she couldn't have; however, she doubted if anyone could figure it out.
Okay, it really bugged Toni that she had no idea of where he knew her from. "Why would I change? I was and am still awesome," she replied, knowing full well that she wasn't awesome a few years ago- before she became Iron Man.
Her words struck him hard, as her tone had changed slightly. If he hadn't spent so much time with her in the past, he would have missed it. However, he wasn't sure what that change of tone meant. "It's what you make of it, Stark."
"I see you talked Steve to bed," he turned to the bathroom. "He had fallen asleep at the door the last I checked."
This was as far as their conversion went, but she seemed friendly enough to have a real conversion with. In another life, he might've flirted back or attempted to. He was a horrible flirt, even after the growth spurt and he just had to smile. He just rambled on, until someone stopped him in his tracks. Toni would just stare at him and let him go, only stopping him when she had a good laugh. She loved it when he rambled. She thought it was cute. "Have a good night," he added.
"That isn't it," he said; his voice was all too soft. His voice reminded her of the Shrimp she first met.
It was around midnight, but the streets were anything but quiet. They were anything but dark. New York was a very loud city, and even at this hour, there were still hundreds of cars and trucks passing by on these streets. There were police sirens blasting, waking any sleeping person or persons, as cop cars were flying down these streets. Even the buildings were alive, as images were flashed against them. Plasma Screens plastered the skyscrapers flashes burr after burr and color after color, and these buildings were humming. They hummed as if they were live, which was what called a certain genius out even if it was unwise to go out at this hour.
Maybe, she could lift someone's wallet…I can't do that to some poor bastard, she thought after thinking about it. She couldn't do that to someone, even if she was a heartless bitch, because they probably needed it for his family, who was probably worse off than she. Though I could pay him back once I get to the future, she reasoned. Maybe she could-
He crossed back to her and grabbed her face again. He had thing about grabbing the face, didn't he? "I'm sorry that I struck you. I forget my strength at times," he stated as he rubbed the huge black bruise on her face. It was surprising that he didn't break her jaw. "Maybe, you will learn to obey."
Before, Toni would've taken insult to that; however, she couldn't find it in herself to be insult, not after all of the time that they had spent together. Howard still annoyed her though. "Geez, you know how to insult a person." She glared at her before she turned to Phillips. "Can I get the core and Tesseract so I can go home, where I won't be insult? Plus, I would enjoy sleeping in my bed," She asked, struggling against Howard, who still hadn't let go. "And can you let me go?"
"I don't know about the Capsicle part, but I would love to get back to my own king size bed," she said, kicking her feet over the side. "And a nice large steak with a glass of whiskey."
"A pretty thing like you wouldn't ever be a burden," Bucky said. "And before you ask, I won't let you go to a homeless shelter." At hearing the weakness in her voice, he decided he didn't want her anywhere near one of those death shelters.
Toni found herself in a familiar room, sitting in a familiar chair, as she was handcuffed to a familiar table. Besides her, Colonel Salt, who was sitting across from her, was the only one in the room. She had no doubt that Peggy and her annoying father were standing behind the glass watching her.
If it was possible, Steve's smile grew, and stopping Toni before she could finish, he leaned forward and captured her lips with his. He didn't give Toni any time to think as he gave her a deep kiss. His hands traveled up her arms to her face, cupping her cheeks. Toni wasn't sure when she closed her eyes and leaned into him, but she didn't care. She enjoyed the feeling of being in his arms. Steve's arms were warm, almost smoldering, but she felt safe with him. She felt like she could do anything as long as he believed in her.
A look of happiness appeared on Schmidt's face. "Increase the output by sixty percent. And speak with our other facilities to do the same."
Steve took a deep breath as he crossed to the bed and sat down; he remembered the first time that he met Toni. He wasn't referring to the time in Germany, when they were fighting Loki; no, he was referring to the time in the empty lot. It was when he didn't know about superheroes, magical items, or aliens. Those were the days that everything had made sense. Though finding Toni in that field did not make sense, he knew what to do and what not to do, well besides falling in in love with Toni, who seemed to hate him. She seemed to like Bucky, who didn't trust or like her, and that just annoyed the hell out of him. He cared for Toni, not Bucky. She should've liked him, not Bucky… Well, she did like him before he came Captain America, but after that, she looked at him differently, and Steve could guess why. Bruce was right: he was an ass.
Toni's heart was beating in her chest, threatening to pop out, as her breath became labored. "What?"
However, Killian was unaffected by the amount of blood dripping to the floor and copper smell filling the air. "The good news: a high-level position will be vacated soon."
His mind flashed back to the man in the alley, hovered over the Toni like prey looking at his food. His face was hidden, but Steve knew the face. Knew what that might. The man wasn't going to kill Toni. "So, he's a ghost story?"
"I thought Toni needed something else to wear. Did you see those clothes she had been wearing?" Steve asked.
"We knew about the Device that she was working on and it was clear that the person who stole the weapons," he said slowly, unsure if he should use that word, "knew as well. Her unnamed Device worked through a wave, and we had a device that could have interrupted that." He wasn't going to go into detail about the device.
Her father glanced at her before looking at Peggy, who was also staring at him. "Because I'm a bloke."
For the nth time this week, Dum-E is positioned at the door as if the robot is guarding the entrance, which is a scary thought. There's no telling what the bot will do to person trying to enter, not that they can get in when the lab is on locked down. And to make it worse, the bot has a fire extinguisher, which isn't good. Though Dum-E isn't normally a dangerous robot, the bot can cause quite a lot of damage without meaning too. Tony has been on the bad end of a few misused fire extinguishers, and he has the marks to prove it. "What are you doing, Dum-E?" he asks, giving the bot a look. "You should put that down before you hurt yourself… or me for that matter!"
However, it was Pepper who caught Toni's eye as it looked like she hadn't slept in days. It could be the way the light hit her, but the CEO looked tired as she spoke with Romanoff, granted everyone looked exhausted. They all looked like they were on edge, like no one had been sleeping. Was this all because of her?
The man didn't answer, only stared at Toni. His face was covered in dark shadows, like most of his body, and it was difficult- if not impossible-to make out any feature on his face. Toni could tell that he was a rather buff man, looking like he could give Steve a run for his money, which was saying something. Even in the darkness and bulky clothes, she could tell that he was a muscular, burly man, who handle his own in a fight and hold it well. She could tell that he was well build—not an ounce of fat on his body-through his clothes.
Uncomfortable in the silence, the lawyer turned to leave, without making a move to his jacket, but he froze a second later. He flexed his right hand as if he was in deep thought. "Do you wish for me to call anyone? Do you need me to get someone for you? I know this can't be easy."
He watched her walk away from him, but in his mind, he was watching Toni walking away from him. It was a mystery to him why he was envisioning Toni as Toni and Natasha looked nothing alike. Sure they were roughly the same height at five foot three inches though Toni could've been an inch or two shorter, but their shapes were different. Natasha was a curvier than Toni. Plus, Toni's dark hair, even when she had it up in a messy bun, attracted him every time.
Tony knows he shouldn't let it get it to him, but he can't. He likes being with them. He likes that they care for him. "Promise me," he says as he closes his eyes.
"If you go to bed, I'll talk to you in the morning," she said, lying through her teeth. "I'll take the couch."
She hated to see what that Barton would do if he found either the Doll, the bear or the photos. She would never live that down. "I supposed she may see Steve as one big doll to hug." She said, her voice cracking. "She might never let him go."
Bruce smiled weakly. "And when I asked her about it, she wouldn't answer, only dodged. I don't know what she was thinking, but the mere mention of your name got her heart racing. Now, I'm no expert in the ways of Toni Stark, but that means something."
Toni smiled and chuckled. "Well, when you get blasted on your ass, I'll be right where I'm needed to laugh at you."
But she was Toni Fucking Stark, and there was no doubt that she could survive an apocalypse. She could just hover above them in her Iron Man Suit and killing them all from a safe distance. Besides, they couldn't get through her suit, even if they did get to her. And if by some change that they got into the tower—not possible in any reality-, JARVIS would cook their asses. No, really cook them. Granted, that wasn't a cookout that Toni wanted to be invited to, let alone smell.
Toni let out a painfully sad laugh as she watched him step to her. "Why are you here?" she asked, not wanting to be bothered. She wanted to be alone to her thoughts, though she knew it would be unwise. Her mind was never a safe place when she was like this. However, she could peg the question: was it ever safe?
"I just don't believe you should be on the battlefield." He exhaled slowly as he pushed the documents in front of him away. He looked at her as he tried to figure out what to say. "There're reasons why there aren't woman solders on the battlefield. One being that men are physically stronger than woman."
Natasha didn't say anything and just nodded, but her stare was intense and it dug deep into Steve's soul.
Steve was getting angrier and angrier with each passing second. "Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny." He glanced at Banner for a second, annoyed that he was even there. "No offense, doctor." It came out harsher than he intended, but he didn't care, not with imagine of Toni's hand on his arm.
." How in the hell did he get that rank? She wanted to punch the person who gave it to him. "But I don't care! Just go."
With his annoyance growing, Steve swung his left arm forward, bring his shield down on his foe's chest. It broke his chest like butter, making a sickness sound as he killed him. It was harder than he intended, but his anger drove him forward as he just wanted Barton to shut it. However, you couldn't just tell Clint to shut up, as that would just keep him going, knowing that he had you. "Did you complete the objective?" He asked, pulling back his arm.
Toni didn't know when she came to as it was a never ending nightmare to her. Even in her drug induced coma, the nightmares didn't stop and seemed to tire her out even more. Sure, she felt somewhat rested, but it felt like she hadn't slept in days. When she came to, she just blinked for a few seconds as she stared up at the ceiling.
Rogers eyed him as he picked up the phone. He could've asked JARVIS to make the call, but both of them felt weird using the AI. "Who are you calling?" he asked.
Her smile got even bigger. "Vous n'avez encore rien vu," she stated as she leaned forward in her chair.
"And some drug dealer was murdered in Central Park," Clint added as everyone turned to Toni, who just frozen. She was a deer in headlights as she stared at the screen not hearing anyone or anything. On the screen, a picture of the man Toni had met in the park flickered for a seconds before it flashed to the bloody crime screen. It was a brutal bloody screen, though it was hard to make out most of it through the buzzy imagine.
Tony blinks for a few seconds as he pokes at the food in front of him. "Oh, is that tonight?" he asks, truly forgetting in his angst. "Sure, why not." He knows he shouldn't have said it, but he can't help it.
Why did she have to say it like that? It was true that he wasn't as hip as everyone else, but was that a bad thing? He liked the way he was, though he wished he understand the present a bit more. He was still stuck in the 1940s in some ways. But he was a one-woman kind of Man, and there was nothing he would do to ruin that, which included the kind of mission that Natasha had in mind. "I still think you should've let me after Rumlow. I could've gotten Toni's location out of him," he said, changing the subject.
"You don't need to tell me twice," she said as she walked to the control panel. They were so many odd buttons on the panel that Toni didn't know what each of them did; it looked the Enterprise from the Original Season. Sure, she would figure it all out in time as she was awesome, but they didn't have time to figure it out if she were to judge by the monitors. A hand full of guards were on their way to the room, and each were heavy armed. "Just keep an eye on the monitors."
Toni's eye almost twitched as she was almost home free. She could almost taste it. Balls. She knew it wasn't the end as there was a chance she could talk herself out of this situation. She was a talker, just ask anyone. "Is there a problem?" she asked as she turned around.
on his comrades, and then, he was a soldier. Even though she couldn't vouch if his nights were restless or not in the present (the past, a different story), he probably suffered from
a hero, always putting others before himself, but she just wanted to see him for more than once every two weeks. She wanted to sleep in his arms every night. She just wanted to be with him, even if he gave her one of his famous stares.
With her heart skipping and guilt growing, she was losing the fight. Feeling overwhelmed, her guilt overtook her, forcing her to relive his death.
Then what else could this be? Her mind wandered to the Device she created. Could it be the reason why she was here? One idea came to mind, but that wasn't possible, especially when that wasn't what she had been trying to do. Shaking her head, she paused on the thought. That could be the reason why her never wrong watch, which was missing from her wrist, was wrong…so maybe, it was possible. How else could she explain the 1940's shit and the Shrimp? She thought she imagined the tiny Captain...
The Captain didn't look up, feeling useless. He wouldn't help but wonder if he was only good for war, for battles. It seemed like that was all he was good for. He went out on missions, and when he was finished, he went on more missions, while she was here alone. How could he expect to have a healthy relationship with the woman he loved? She couldn't sleep, and he knew it, but he wasn't there for her.
Pepper stared at Natasha before slamming her fists on the door. "JARVIS, let us in!" Before she could hit the cold metal again, Steve stopped her. She glanced at him from the corner of her eye, ignoring the stinging in her hand. "Let us in!" she ordered, pulling her hand away from Steve.
Toni stared at him, and she could see the Future Rogers in him. "I know that and I admire that about you," she said with a smile. He was clearly taken back from that. "I want you to keep trying. However, just be smart about it. Don't give up or I will have to beat you."
Also, I was wonder who might be watching that 6 O'Clock news to see that kiss. ;p Same person who has that missing picture?
Toni knew that, but denial was her best friend and it would help her hide, which was something that she was good at. "Only people with nicknames can lecture me," she replied, as she shut the cases.
"So in other words no," Toni translated, bitterly. She didn't know what she was expecting but she would've thought that they knew something. Someone had attacked her and it wasn't random. Someone was after her for a reason. Did they know she was from a future? If not that, were they after her because she was a genius? It had her worried, because if they didn't know the reason, they couldn't figure out who it was. "What have you guys been doing?"
feelings. Those feelings of being alone. Of being worthless. Of being weak. She still felt like even now when she was awake.
He had told himself that he wouldn't see them until he was ready, but he needed to know, and it wasn't as if he went to see Peggy. He had tracked down Dum Dum in a nursing home, who he seemed to be enjoying as he bugged all of the female nurses. Though guys who flirted nonstop annoyed him, it was adorable to see old man Dugan flirt with women half his age; however, it could get annoying after a while. It had to do something with the fact that no one could be mad at an elderly man.
The CEO froze and turned to Toni ever so slowly. She was anything but happy. "This is not up for debate. You're coming with me."
Barnes narrowed his eyes at the nickname, his face puzzled for a second. It disappeared a second later. "Thank you," he replied, his tone changing. "Your obedience will be rewarded."
Rogers stopped in front a building, which she assumed was his apartment. "I was. I was worried that you weren't alive as I didn't think anyone could survive that. So I'm glad that I ran into you, because I couldn't get you out of my mind."
Toni's eyes twitched. "Why?" She asked, giving the JARVIS a look. "…Wait, scratch that. It doesn't matter, because I don't share for any reason. Sharing is not caring."
"In my defense, Toni was operating the suit while in intoxicated and she was a threat to everyone around," Rhodes countered. "Just ask Romanoff. She was there."
Shaking her head, Toni stared at the two elderly man, not able to shake the feeling that she knew them from somewhere. Not one to make friends with elders (or anyone), she didn't know many elderly people besides the people sitting on her board of directors. "I'm not anyone's girl."
Tony doesn't know how long he has been in his lab, as he can't keep track of the days, though he can ask FRIDAY if he wants to—not that he does. He doesn't need or want to be reminded of how long it has been since he had broken up with the two best things that has ever happened to him. He doesn't need to be reminded of the lo—nope, not love. Can't be— happiness that he has lost. He doesn't need to be reminded of how much of a failure he is.
"So you believe me now?" Toni asked as she narrowed her eyes at the stupid Colonel. Though she was glad that he did believe her, this was not how she wanted it. She took a deep breath, but Erskine was going to die no matter and nothing could've changed that.
Steve said those words, Toni's chest tightened, and her cheeks reddened. She knew Steve noticed, as he smiled upon seeing her reactions. "I just…" She started but drifting off a few seconds. "I know. It's just…" She didn't like feeling weak, like she was going to fall apart at any second. That wasn't sexy.
"Not just his," she replied, thinking back to Rogers and Barnes. She couldn't help but feel guilty and self-hatred, but she had to keep up her mask.
The expression on his face changed for a brief second, before he leaned forward and captured her lips in a long powerful kiss. He smiled against her lips after breaking a part. "What is with people thinking that I could keep up- let alone want one another dame?" His Brooklyn accent became heavy suddenly. "As soon as this mission is over, I'll be back for you, and I'll show you how much I want you."
"Maybe, he might listen then. Right, Soldier?" he asked, giving him a hard look as if daring the Asset to speak. "You're just a weapon, and it's time you remember that."
"It's cold in here, isn't it?" he asked, looking down to the opened pill bottle that hadn't been touched by Toni. "You should take one. I can see you are in pain."
After a long glare, Steve turned back to Toni to make sure she was still sleeping. He wouldn't be happy if someone wake Toni, and they would face his anger if they did. "So you don't think we're going to work?" he asked, eyeing Toni's best friend. He held Toni closer, refusing to let her go.
The idea that she could be killed by this man bugged the crap out of Toni. Because this was not how she saw it. In her earlier days, she wished she would die after a good round of sex. Now, she wasn't so sure, but this wasn't it. Okay, Rollins probably wasn't going to kill her, considering he did go through all this stupid shit, but she refused to let him have any control over her. She was fucken Iron Man, and she was going to get out here, kicking ass on the way out. She wasn't some victim. "Asshole," she hissed. Her hand dropped from face and turned to him. Her eyes dropped to his guns again, running a few plans through her head.
"Not as comfortable as the seats on one of my jets," he replied, sliding the hard case under his seat. "They're like sitting on clouds. You'll love them, trust me."
When Toni woke the next morning, she didn't remember much, only recalling Steve's arms wrapped around her. She recalled talking to him, but she didn't remember what was said. She couldn't even guess, but she slept amazing well in Steve's arms, like a baby. However, that didn't stop her from waking up alone, which was frustrating to say the least. She hated waking up alone, especially when she had a bad day. And yesterday was a
Toni leaned back and stared at her broken arm. Why did she care what others thought of her? It didn't change who she was or what she was able to do. She was still Toni Stark, one of the greatest minds on the planet and she would be damn if she let others define her….But you do! She argued with herself. There were a select few people could make herself feel like an idiot.
Toni stared at the now off lights, glaring. "Hey, Hey. This is not a make out party. You don't get to turn out my lights," she said, stepping slowly to Pepper's desk. She was slowly and surely getting the feeling back in her legs. "And I am not interested," she added, thinking of Steve. What would Steve do?
Barnes took a deep breath. "I'm not Steve." There was a half-smile. "If you want to go, then go. I won't stop you, but you don't have to."
Toni closed her eyes as she felt his arms around her; there was something warm about it. "Get in line," she whispered. She was too tired to fight against her father, even if she felt uncomfortable. Why wasn't he like this in the future? Why was he distant then? It wasn't because he was interested in her, though he did throw out a few one liners. It was like he cared, and that annoyed her slightly. He should've been like this in the future not now, though she would take it now as she needed it now.
"Toni, you're going to go crazy if you don't talk about it. I know you can't sleep and that you hadn't been able to sleep for a while."
"That sounds like a challenge," he grinned, as he closed the distance between them. With grace and speed, he swept the genius off her feet, pinning her against hist chest. Like she was nothing, Steve whirled her around before gently setting her down on the bed. "I like a challenge." His voice was low and husky. Putting her between his knees, he climbed on the bed and hovered above her. He hesitated for second before he dove in, lining kisses to her neck. He lingered on a few places as his mouth worked, drawing out a shudder from the brunette.
Howard straightened up and turned to the Colonel. "Yup, just set everything up, and we are ready for action."
Harley had the biggest, round eyes as he looked up at her. "Because it's lame, and you aren't a man." There was the slightest color of red on his cheeks as he said it. "You need a better name."
With a new smart phone in the cup holder, Toni pressed the button ignition and closed her eyes as the engine came alive. The purring of a fine toned engine was another thing that she missed, because there was something about it that called to her. However, it didn't have to be an engine as she got that same feeling whenever she worked in the lab. It was why she worked so often in the lab, and after this, she would probably end up in the lab more.
"Besides," Jones started, "we didn't see any device. There were some metals shards on the ground, but that could be from anything."
"Oh," she muttered, forgetting she had done so. She had changed it yesterday, because somehow the jerk, Steve Rogers, had gotten ahold of the code. She didn't want him, well anyone really, to have access to her lab. "Let her in," she ordered as she placed the device down.
Toni could tell the first man was furious at the second, and it worried her, but she wasn't sure why. There was no reason why she shouldn't trust the man, who was holding her. He only seemed to want her to move, which was what she wanted.
"Geez, Rogers, just kiss me already. I'm dying over here." She was beaming now as she spoke. "This is what I get for falling for an old man."
He smiled at the use of his first name. "At least, I'll always know when you're mad at me by the use of my last name."
There was no denying that. She was in no shape or form a runner. She hated running, only trying it because she heard running helped with the dreams. Now, whoever said that was a complete idiot and liar, because she felt worst after a run. Maybe, it was because running gave her all the time in the world to think. She felt like she was on fire afterward, but her mind was still running. And when Toni's mind had time to think, it felt like she was being crushed by the weight of everything. Her mind was an idle play thing. "Nope."
Would she really leave with Rollins without saying to word? No, that wasn't right. She didn't trust these assholes. "I do-"
Trying to calm herself before she walked over there, she took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Steve didn't like it when she defended him, and though she really didn't care if he liked it or not, she didn't want to irritate him on their last day together. After the other men were gone, Toni crossed to him wearing a big smile. "Hey! No sad face!" she cheered. "Turn that frown upside down!"
Don't worry, shouldn't take me too long for me to get the next chapter out. :) Maybe, the more reviews I get the faster I get the next chapter out. So hit that review button! Really, hit it!
People watching, Toni's mind drifted from the chair on his legs. Stark Industries had diversity, which both Toni and Pepper were proud of, and almost every single employee looked different, each with different stories. Sometimes, she just watched her employees and wondered who they were—what were their life stories. Sure, she played the path of a cold 'bitch', protesting her feeling until she was blue in the face, but she did care, though she didn't like to admit it. That was an invite for someone to hurt you, and that was the one thing that scared the shit out of her, which was why it took an army to get into her heart.
Howard turned toward them. "That chest piece works like an electromagnet though I cannot tell what's powering it. It's nothing like I had seen before. I won't know what that is unless I take it a part but I doubt she will let me do that as it is keeping her alive." He leaned against the table with his arms folded against his chest. "As for the other device, I don't have a clue. It keeps, for lack of a better word, eating all the power I supply it and spitting it back out, violently."
Toni's eyes widened as James Bucky Barnes stepped out of the shadows and toward her in predatory fashion. There was an angry scowl on his face, and it appeared like he was ready to skin her alive, as he walked toward her in his WW2 uniform. "No," she uttered, her entire body shaking as she looked over the man in front of her. Her mind had to be playing tricks on her. Had to! Because this wasn't possible. But this
Hearing his harsh tone, it filled Ton with a few different emotions. One was anger, because no one was allowed to talk to her like that, like she was a child, and she was close to snapping on him for that. However, guilt and sadness also filled her, because she had brought this pain onto him. "Why w-"
She took a deep breath as she laid her head down on the table. She was exhausted, and just looking at that device made her head spin. She couldn't think or function when she was this tired, but she couldn't find peace in her dreams. Though nightmares were common for her, they had never been this bad, and she didn't know what to do. If she asked Phillips for sleeping pills, she would have to tell him about the nightmares, which she didn't want to talk about with anybody, much less him.
Natasha took a deep breath. "What did you say to her to upset her this much?" She narrowed her eyes at Steve.
"Stay out of my head," he says again. He knows there's no denying it, but he still doesn't want her in his head. He can't have her in his head. Not now, when he's so broken.
"I don't want it," Tony replies as he waits for Rogers to leave. He can't deal with the Captain being this close not after watching that footage, and he's itching to call Pepper to tell her never to tell Rogers shit again. He doesn't need this.
"Toni," Steve huffed out, knowing where this was going if she kept it up. He had finally got rid of his little issue, and right now, he wanted to get her to sleep. He wanted her to feel safe and loved. He didn't want her scared to sleep. He didn't want her scared to be honest with him.
Her guilt and sadness over Bucky's death was getting to her more than she ever thought possible. How could she get over this when she could've stopped it? She knew he was going to die, and she let it happen… Then there was also the fact that she cared for Bucky, and now he was gone. She was never good at saying good-bye.
Wanda's expression softens. "It is not physical. It is emotional," she states, her accent thick. "Tell them, Stark."
Steve could see the expression morph on Toni's face, and he didn't like it. "This can wait, Fury," he said, reaching for her. He could see her flinch slightly as his hand made contact with hers, but she didn't pull away. "She needs to rest."
"Surprise to see yourself here?" he asked, taking a few steps closer to her. He had his chest popped out and his arms folded behind his back to show his superiority.
The Captain almost jumped at that. "What?!" He paused as he thought about denying it, but it only took him a few seconds to realize that it would be useless. "How did you know?"
Tony isn't sure what will happen, but he can't keeping running from his problems. Sure, he thinks love is a curse, but he can't be afraid anymore. He has to face the fear growing in his chest, even if this thing is impossible.
It felt like someone had punched him in the gut. It felt like someone took his legs out from under him. "Seeing things?" he uttered, his voice cracking.
her name on the building. Lately, she hadn't been a ball of fun, almost biting people's heads off. Sure, having Steve around had relaxed her, and for the most part, she was calm—which was noticeable, but she still was a bit off putting; still mouthy.
Toni took a deep breath as she pushed away from the table. "Can we just skip this part and someone- hint, hint, Stark- gives me back my core, so I can go home? I so need some Shawarma," she replied, looking at her father.
"I like you like this. I love the fear in your eyes," he said, as he finally gripped her tongue with the tool. However, before he pull, the door opened loudly behind him and judging by the footsteps, there were quite a few people who had just walked into the room.
Toni let out a small laugh. Barnes knew how to make her laugh even if he was an unbearable flirt. "You're something else." She pushed him off and this time, he let go. "I'm going to go now."
How could he be making a joke about this? "I wish I had a book," she replied, sadly. "I would've known what to do."
"Who told you?" Toni demanded. It was probably Peggy, who couldn't keep her mouth shut. She was seriously going to change her nickname to Loud Mouth.
she thought. She couldn't believe that she had let that slip; it was stupid. She was stupid. "I did not say that."
She wiggled in her chains trying to create some sort of lag, but the chains only drug into her side. "Bitch," she cursed, fighting through the discomfort. It was a dull pain, but it was radiating up from her side to her arms. It was also a numbing feeling that was taking over her whole body; however, she wasn't going to give up. She was going to get out of here, and someone was going to get beat.
"I know where Stark is," he revealed as he took a seat in one of the many chairs. To his surprise, the chair was very uncomfortable, and he almost forgot what he was going to say.
Her hand was trembling as she stumbled through the snow. She could feel her heart race as memories force their way forward. "Yeah, a little bit. C-can I just catch my breath for a second?" she asked, suddenly finding it hard to breath. It was like someone was sitting on her chest. It was like someone had put a bag over face that she was unable to get off.
The ringing of his personal cellphone was loud in the cabin of the stealth SHIELD jet even through the hum of its engine. It makes Bucky jump.
you,” Tony says with a shrug before his mouth twists into a wry grin, “Kinda hard not to. Word of your brave Knight-Captain and his loyal squadron is always quick to spread amongst the soldiers. Not a day went by that I didn’t hear of some unconventional plan going off without a hitch with Hatten’s Unshakable Shield at its helm.”
“I want two things.” Toni holds up the amount of fingers she’d need. “One, I want an American cheese burger, and the other is a press conference.”
"Fun," Stever repeats dryly, silently letting her know that he's on to her. But he sighs. "You and I have very different definitions of fun. Fine. It's been a while since I've been to one of these parties anyway."
Tony yelps when Rhodes flicks at his ear and sighs, saying, “Forgive him, Captain, he was raised in a barn.”
"Hey, Steve, did you bring a suit?" she asks, waving the screens away to return her attention back to Steve only to nearly have a heart attack because what the fuck, he's already watching her, clearly fully recovered. "Jesus Christ, how long have you been staring?"
It’s an, admittedly, handsome face. Now that his judgment isn’t clouded with irritation and confusion, Steve can appreciate the man’s features. He’s about Clint’s height but slimmer in build, clean-shaven, and under his tunic, he wears a tight black undershirt that wraps around his neck. Perhaps to fight off the remaining chill of spring? They did have a rather harsh winter.
From the rear, Sam blows a horn. From the front, Bucky raises the Iron Reign flag. From the middle, Steve takes a deep breath.
“This was– This was a Board of Director’s meeting?” Toni repeats in disbelief, shooting her godfather a bewildered look. “Who was going to tell me?”
“That’s unfair,” Steve frowns, unable to keep the expression off his face. “You’re the closest thing I have to a family in this era, it wasn’t an easy decision to make, but your father was going down a dangerous path and so were you. I couldn’t stick around and watch that happen.”
Steve checks it off his list as another set of his men carries the crate past him to be loaded onto one of the cargo carts.
"Nope. I don't think so." A loud bang echoes out after Dad's answer as the dummy explodes, flaming limbs flying out to the four corners of the earth. He turns to Pops with a frown. "Must be your age catching up to you, honey. See you at dinner."
Natasha gives him a pointed look as she passes by him when his phone rings again, a towel in her hands and making her way over to where Bucky was hunched over on a bench.
He sighs again after rubbing the sleep away from his face and casts his gaze around the moonlit room. At his orders, the curtains had not been drawn shut, so the full moon’s silver glow had full access through the massive windows, spilling across the floor, over the lounge furniture, the dressers, and the four post of the canopy bed.
There was a time in Steve’s life where he didn’t need an alarm clock to wake up. He’s learned to take life a little easier since then, however, so sue him if he grumbles a bit when he hits snooze on his phone after it goes off. He promptly shoves his head under one of the many pillows the guest bedroom afforded him.
