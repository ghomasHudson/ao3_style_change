"Did... What?" Victor laughed, squeezing Alex's hand. "John - what did I miss?" His mouth was agape in surprise.
"You didn't hurt me," Sherlock promised with a soft smile. He began to stroke John's back softly, kissing his shoulder and breathing in his scent. He blushed at the sentiment of it all but he nodded in agreement. "I need you too." He whispered.
"No. Let's stay here and build a fort." He said with a bright smile. He suddenly moved from underneath John and jumped up onto his feet. "Do you know how? I've never done it before. Well, I have but I was seven and pretending to be a pirate." He grabbed a few pillows off the couch and dropped them to the floor. "When's the last time you built one?"
"Good boy." Sherlock praised giving him one last kiss and then looking to Victor on the other end of the couch who was wide eyed and clearly aroused. He had no idea they were into this kind of thing. What was more it was shocking considering he always thought Sherlock was the submissive, even in their relationship he'd acted submissive. This however was thrilling, he smirked.
James Morgan     I share a confused look with Peter and whisper to him, “You did background on Lestrade, yes. You sure he hasn't been here before?”
Mycroft                 "None for me, Sherlock," I said, finishing my coffee as Rosie climbed into my lap. "Did you have a good nap, Rosie?"
Sherlock               I'm almost in tears, still swinging her back and forth in my arms, "She has the genetics for addiction and alcoholism. What if I've already started her down that path brother?"
Greg                      "It’s okay. we're from the British Embassy and we just needed to find Nina. I apologize for his idiocy, he doesn't know the language and just barges in everywhere." I waved for them to calm down and glanced over where Sherlock was recoiling at himself.
Greg                      "Do you actually want to get better and get back to work? You won't have me following around you then, moaning at you like a mother." I held out my hand for the pack, giving him a stern look.
Sherlock               Watching him I nod, lowering my voice a little to a husky bass, "I didn't want you to be with that other man. I did not want you to stand next to him. I really didn't want you to receive oral sex from him."
Sherlock               My attention is diverted just as Mycroft's finger twitches, huffing, "That's mine. Give it back. I was using it."
Rosie                     "We can show him Papa. He'll be pretty like us." The juice is weird. "More juice pease.
Mycroft                 I turned a deeper shade of pink. "No... that's nothing... that's just..." I stammered.
Mycroft                 "No need to panic. One small cup isn't going to hurt her. But she may be a bit out of sorts for a while."
Greg                      The cab with sherlock in had sped away before I could get in so I had to jog back to the embassy, my running routine meaning that I actually got back before them. I felt my phone buzzing and knew it was Mycroft calling me.
Sherlock               "What rubbish, "I snap as I set Rosie down among the books, "The pharmacy is preparing all the pain medication you need and releasing it to my care."
"Why is Papa still sad, Daddy?" John felt his heart give a pang of sadness; he wished Hamish couldn't recognize that so easily. Sometimes the little boy could even recognize it before John could. He put Hamish's food on a plate and grabbing his blue sippy cup and filling it with his favorite juice.
"You have no idea." John growled and started kissing Sherlock's neck. "Just in case I go too crazy, we'd better give you a safe word. So let's see..." He hummed, his teeth grazing Sherlock's neck. Sherlock moaned desperately, trying to get his hands free from John's control and failing miserably. "You can say Belgravia if you need a break, and... Hm..." He licked over the area he was attending to on Sherlock's neck, causing him to whimper. "How about Monaco if you need to stop completely. Now I don't care how you ask but if you want that uniform it better be
to use him. He wanted Sherlock to give him everything he really wanted. He was finally open to his own desire.
"Have you ever thought about his body, John? Have you ever thought about fucking him?" John blushed but he knew he couldn't lie.
"Sherlock you couldn't hurt me without my permission. I would have stopped you." He kept nuzzling his nose into
"I know he needs us. And I swear I won't be like this all the time. I won't be a sopping mess. I just... I haven't let myself... Feel." The only thing that made it obvious that he
"Do you have any idea how fucking amazing you look right now?" John grunted, slamming into Sherlock. "Completely shivering and moaning like a fucking animal. So desperate for me to fuck you senseless." One hand gripping Sherlock's hip hard. He was sure he was going to bruise it but he was too far gone to care. The table slid forward but John just followed it continuing to hold Sherlock up and pump over him. "God yes, Sherlock. Tell me what you want, tell me what you need me to do to you." Sherlock actually let out a laugh when the table slid forward a few inches. Christ they were getting so carried away.
"No, no, no. You only kiss your boyfriend or girlfriend. Not your cousin." He chuckled and Marius blushed a bit.
"Can you teach me, Papa?" Marius asked excitedly, clapping his hands together. "Mummy said I not take art lessons 'cause we couldn't 'ford to." He looked down as he frowned. John gave a bit of a frown as well. It was sad to see how much the boy and his family had suffered and to watch how much he missed his parents. It was hard to remind himself that both of these darling boys had suffered before coming into their lives. He could remember when they first brought Hamish home from the crime scene. It had taken him a long time to speak and when he did they found the only two words he could say were Mum and Dad. And when he said it, it was almost as if he was asking for them. He sighed as he realized Marius was the exact picture of what Hamish would have been like had he been older when they found him. He looked up at his son, smiling as he saw that Sherlock was easy in his embrace, holding the little boy as close to him as possible while Hamish snuggled closer and watched Mycroft set the rest of the pancakes on the table.
"God you two... Someone touch me, please..." John begged, groaning as he greedily pulled Victor's mouth back to his own, his hand sliding over the two of them and enjoying the pulses sparking through them under his hand. Sherlock groaned this was not the proper position to be in so they got to truly enjoy each other.
"You awake?" He asked softly, biting back his anger but knowing Sherlock could hear it in his tone. Sherlock listened to the words and understood then that he knew that he was high. A stone sank in his stomach. His blissfully quiet mind couldn’t provide him with the details of
"What's wrong? What happened? Are you okay?" He asked the questions quickly, wrapping his arms around him.
"I know." Sherlock said softly and sighed, he gently put a hand on Alex's arm. "I'm glad he's told you. I wouldn't want there to be secrets. Secrets destroy. I just think it's hard for us to remember that things aren't what they used to be. It was hard for me too when they first bonded because the two of them move so easily around each other and they both figured me out within moments. Jealousy is expected and it's okay. It means you really do love him. I really am glad you two are happy."
"Mycroft." John snapped by way of a greeting. He was tense already and the look on Mycroft’s face didn’t help soothe his nerves. He sank down into the chair in front of Mycroft, his leg bouncing nervously.
"Alright, but please try not to worry yourself sick. I'll be okay eventually." John promised and he couldn't even see Sherlock's face to read him properly. his vision was blurred again. He closed his eyes and tried his best to ignore the pain. Sherlock's phone vibrated in his pocket.
Holmes was silent, studying my face. I found that I was breathing fast, light-headed with exhaustion and dismay.
“Practice suggests a rehearsal,” I said, my attention still focused on his hands rather than the import of my words.
“It was nothing you did,” said Holmes. “I merely have a habit of observation that reveals certain facts about those around me, whether I will it or not. As to your drinking, I knew from the first day we met. You took out your watch when Stamford asked you for the time and it told the whole story.”
Before I could respond to this startling overture, I heard the footsteps that my friend’s keen ears had no doubt already detected and I sat back swiftly, distancing myself from Holmes by several feet. By the time the young constable opened the door, we were two strangers again.
“I have many hidden talents, my dear Watson,” he interjected, hooking one long leg over mine and pulling me closer.
Perhaps our most gruesome and horrifying encounter with the darkness that Holmes so often pitted himself against was the affair of the speckled band. My account of the case of the Roylotts and the night that Holmes and I passed at their home in Stoke Moran summarised the essence of the case and its singularly grotesque features. There were several aspects of the events surrounding that grim adventure that made it a particularly memorable one, however, and that were by necessity expunged from the version of events that I saw fit to lay before the eyes of the public.
“Holmes,” I whispered, very softly. “When we were in Montpellier, you mentioned one man whose opinion you valued more than my own.”
Phelps had noticed the direction of my gaze, for his took my hand softly in his and squeezed it wordlessly. I knew then that he had ascertained what lay between Holmes and I and that my prevarication had been useless. But in the face of his silent reassurance, I also knew that we need fear nothing from him. Holmes and Harrison began to stroll back towards us and I turned hastily towards Phelps. We were engaged in conversation about his plans for the grounds that summer when Holmes drew up soundlessly beside us. I had not realised that Phelps was still clasping my hand until he let it go. Turning to Harrison, who had also joined our small group, he took his arm and began to make his slow way back towards the house while Holmes walked swiftly over to the window of the bedroom where Annie Harrison waited. Ignoring my presence beside him entirely, he exhorted her in the strongest possible terms not to leave the room all day. To my surprise, he charged her to lock the room before retiring, remarking casually that Phelps would be returning to London with us that same evening.
He was smiling with rare unguarded joy, so pleased with himself that my heart stuttered in my chest. Giving up on words, I reached out one hand to grasp the back of his neck and pulled his lips to mine. He kissed me with a tender hunger, pressing his naked body to my clothed one, and I revelled in the warm orange glow of sunshine behind my closed eyelids and the light whisper of the breeze on my skin as I thanked him for his unexpected gift in every movement of my lips and every stroke of my tongue against his.
“Don't stop. What else did you think about?” I urged, as he knelt to remove the last of my clothes, lifting my feet one by one to gently slide off my trousers and undergarments as I lent on his shoulder to steady myself. Straightening up, he pulled me towards him, cupping my rear to pull me upwards onto my toes, so that my rigid member pressed against his. With a teasing swivel of his hips, he rubbed himself against my length. I bit my lip as he ran the tip of his thumb over my crown. He licked the bead of moisture from his skin, his eyes burning, and then grasped both of us in one large hand, beginning to stroke at a leisurely pace.
“Since the day we met, I have treated you as my equal and known that you were my better,” he continued. “It is you who insisted on painting me as a hero, though what you find admirable in the inhuman thinking machine you describe in your stories, I cannot imagine. It is you who treated me like a schoolmaster or a general, someone distant to be looked to for instruction but never to be trusted with your thoughts or your feelings.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says, or tries to say. It’s difficult to speak with John’s fingers jammed under his jaw and he’s feeling a bit thrown by John’s declaration, even though eliciting it was the entire point of taking the case.
"I yell at my brother all the time, John. You just don't want doing it now because I hurt myself," He let out a soft chuckle before kissing John again. "You can go back to bed if you're tired, you didn't get much sleep with me waking you up all the time.
"I promise to try to remember to slow down for you." He assured his soon to be husband. "Now, I think I should tell you why I brought you in here." He began, his heart suddenly pounding with nervousness. He took a deep breath and revealed his ring box. He looked at John, trying to study his reaction. He felt relieved once he smiled and Sherlock handed him the ring box and kissed his cheek. "Open it." He whispered and when John did as he was told, the gasp that came from him made Sherlock giggle. "It's gold. I thought gold would look better on you than silver. But what's really special is what's on the inside." He took the ring out of the box and placed it on John's finger. "The longer you leave it on, the word, 'Always' will be imprinted on your finger." He kissed his cheek again, some tears of actual joy coming to his eyes. "Do you like it? Did I make the right choice?" John laughed with joy and kissed Sherlock. It was clever and perfect and totally him.
"You're doing wonderful, John." He said, his voice thick with lust. "Now get his clothes off." Victor looked to John, a smirk on his lips.
me - that just make you perfect." John's voice was passionate but soft as he gushed about his lover. "Noticing small things like I don't take sugar in my coffee but ignoring big things like who the Prime Minister is. Knowing everything about every look I give you... It might feel like a curse to you but it is clever and beautiful to me." Sherlock looked away, his cheeks warming horribly. John loved him for all the reasons most people hated him. It was backwards and insane and it was amazing. The fact that those were some of the reasons why John loved him made his heart pound harder in his chest.
"It will all be fine, I promise." He brushed his lips with a soft kiss. He leaned into John's touch as he washed his hair, he honestly felt so much better in the cold water now that he knew he had his trust. "Don't even think about it anymore, it will be fine." He promised as he brought a hand to John's shoulder and rubbed it soothingly because he knew it had to be hurting.
"I was just tormenting you because you did the same to me all day." John said breathlessly, crying out when Sherlock started to pound into him. "Fuck, Sherlock. You keep moving like that we won't last long." He panted. Sherlock grinned which he knew John couldn't see. He pounded him harder and just as he clenched, he stopped moving altogether.
"Maybe if I can sleep for a bit I'll feel better, okay?  You don't have to sleep with me if you don't want to. You can go in the living room or turn on the telly if you want. Just keep the sound turned down." He kissed his cheek once more before drifting off. Hamish just nodded and snuggled into John, clinging to his shirt as he drifted off as well.
"Uncross your arms." John commanded, all the whimpering gone as he stood up the full height. Sherlock groaned deeply as he watched John become the Captain. This was what he wanted, to be in the middle. Commanding and commanded. Oh it was deliciously beautiful. "Listen to me well," John grabbed his hair and put his face close to Victor's so as he spoke their lips brushed. "If you resist my Master's orders or mine, I will tie you down and beg him to fuck me senseless while no one touches you." He grinned as Victor shuddered, John was good. "Uncross. Your. Arms." Victor usually was a bit more determined to fight, but he could tell how deathly serious John was. He swallowed nervously and nodded.
"Get him out of here. I don't want him to see." He whispered as he closed the kitchen door. Sherlock was sitting at the table while the medics worked on his arm. His expression was... Shattered. He almost looked as if he was the one who had lost his parents. Greg slowly walked into the room, keeping his eyes on the floor. "We did what we could, Sherlock." He whispered, trying to reassure him while not waking Marius. Who had finally cried himself to sleep.
"Yes but did you do things like this when you were three? No." Mycroft answered angrily, his arms still crossed as Sherlock picked paper, glue, and
"The last thing I remember is going out." He sighed with annoyance and related it as if it was nothing. "Victor and I went out last night. I thought we agreed to just go to the restaurant not too far from campus but it looks and feels like he dragged me to the club... Again." He sighed looking over at Victor as if he was bored. "Honestly can't we just go out and have one dinner?" Victor looked to John, his own face very pale. Realization flowed through his mind, Sherlock thought they were still at Uni. During his last year when he was moved to a school closer to Mycroft.
"You... You don't remember?" Victor asked with worry, he could see the emotion shifting in John and it made his own heart ache. His eyes glassed over.
"'Cause you and Uncle 'Lock go afder the bad guys, dats what 'Mish told me... Dat you and Uncle 'Lock stop the bad people." He said with pride and Greg ran his fingers through his hair.
"Ew, stop..." Hamish whined. The waitress was watching wide eyed from behind the counter, her face very red.
"You'll probably like the pasta and white wine dish, Mycroft." His voice was calm and smooth, Sherlock could tell that he was choosing his words carefully. "Sherlock says it's too soft for his taste but that's because he only likes really strong flavors. You will probably appreciate the subtle hints of flavor the wine brings to the food." John said it in just the right tone and Mycroft's jaw tightened. He may have actually blushed but he looked swiftly away. Sherlock was almost giggling as John deduced his brother. It was amazing to watch.
"In some ways, yea." Victor said softly, hearing John's breathing drop as he settled into a deeper sleep. "It's much warmer here that's for sure." He gently reached out, carefully, and put his hand on Sherlock's chest just below his shoulder. "I'm sorry Sherlock, I really am. For all of this. For bringing you into this whole mess and for making him hurt so much. Thank you for having faith in me."
"You could have had a concussion or head trauma. I should have made you go to A&E..." He said quietly.
Sherlock swallowed hard and handed John the phone. He couldn't tell him what was wrong. He couldn't speak but he could show John what had him so petrified. John took the phone and quickly flipped through the messages, he wanted to respond but he knew better so instead he put the phone behind him and took Sherlock's hands in his.
"Stop saying that, Victor, it's stupid. I don't forget anything." Sherlock insisted as he climbed into the bed. He rubbed his aching head. "I'm fine. I really am but you better damn well get me back to University by Monday. Exams are soon and I don't need to miss anymore classes." He said firmly and when Victor settled he got close to him wrapping his arms around him. "I think I must still be drunk or something because things sort of seem weird and the whole 'you hit your head' thing doesn't make sense." He kissed his cheek before resting his head on his chest with a contended sigh.
"I..." Sherlock looked at John, his face betraying the sort of mental anguish that statement brought on. Put off a case? He'd never done that before. He wrung his hands and resisted the urge to spin his ring. "I'll... Try." He said softly and smiled. "They're asleep."
"I'm sorry." He whispered. "I should have...I should have been here to remind you how remarkable you are."
He had been caught. And not just caught, but caught by John. By the one person he didn't want to know he was using again. This was it. This was the part he'd been terrified of. This was the part where John would decide to leave. It was over now.
"He comes 'morrow." Hamish yawned, nuzzling his nose into Marius hair. "We'll makeded cookies for him in da mornin'."
"Don't." Sherlock scolded softly, his hand turning John's chin to look at him. "It's perfectly natural for you to be jealous. I was. Maybe because of that it seemed like I was trying to flirt. Maybe I was. I do stupid things when someone else fancies my husband." He spoke quietly so as not to disturb Hamish. "But there is nothing wrong with how you feel. Are you ill? Have you been pretending to be healthy again?" His fingers deftly moved to check his pulse at his neck, his eyes narrowing. "Is something still wrong?"
now," Sherlock suggested with a sigh. He lay down pulling John with him as he wrapped his arms back around John. "I'm alright now. We can talk about what just happened if you want."
"I have thought about that before," he said, his voice muffled by the pillow. "I did more than thought about it actually, I sort of...fantasized about it. But, I won't tell you more because if I do we'll end up having sex again for the second time since we woke up." He chuckled as he felt John climb back onto the bed. "We haven't had to put on clothes today though. Ha! Now that's a benefit I never considered when I thought about being with you. We're going to be naked all the time now, aren't we?" He asked with a smile as he peeked out from the pillow.
"This is going to sound awful of me but I'm pretty grateful you were shot." Sherlock whispered, blushing just slightly.
"We worked together actually." Mycroft said firmly, laughing as she almost missed her chair in surprise.
"Dear, I suggest you start speaking normally again, your Papa can only handle you using improper grammar for so long." John said with a chuckle as he held both mugs of hot chocolate firmly in his hands. "Come on, you two can have it in the fort. Do you want to watch a Christmas movie?" He asked them as they all walked into the living room.
about him." Sherlock chose to ignore this statement as he opened the door Victor. Victor's smirk was too high on his lips, he was enjoying this too much. Sherlock wanted him out.
"I'm not happy." Sherlock mumbled but it was the truth. "I can't be happy. Not if you don't think you're worth anything. John, you're the most amazing, beautiful, and kind man I have ever met. You're a damn good doctor and I don't know many soldiers but even if I did I would say you were the most loyal. You're important John. To me. And... I really wished you thought the same way." Sherlock looked down, uncomfortable with the sentiment pooling in his stomach.
crying was the way his body shook. There was no sound to betray him. "I've never lost so many people during one case. Especially so many children."
"He is serious, we talked about it. I can help." John said softly, he'd only eaten a few bites of his toast before he set it down. John's hands were shaking though he seemed unaware of it.
"Please, what?" Sherlock asked getting close to John, his cock pressing against his thighs. "What do you want? If you want something you need to tell me. Maybe I'll be generous and give you what you
"Thank you dear!" John called after he found the peppermint oil. "I'll just heat up some water in the microwave. It's quicker than starting the kettle." John said and he heard the boys snicker from where they sat at the table. They were precariously balanced on the seat of one chair, sharing it. As they were almost too big to sit in the same chair they were in danger of falling. "Don't you two start. I haven't burned anything yet." He told them and they only giggled more. Greg found the marshmallows and tossed them to John. John set it on the table as he fished out the cocoa mix.
"It was mad, utterly insane. I fell into it." He was very red. "I trust them with my life and they are the only ones I would trust to truly care for you. If you want to we can talk to them... I'm not against watching you writhe under the work of the Holmes men. God especially not tied up and tormented by Sherlock..." He breathed the words in Alex's ear. "But at the end of the day you are mine and only mine..." Alex shivered and hugged Victor a little.
"How should I ask? Want me to get down on my knees for you and beg?" He whispered as John shoved him into the flat. Sherlock giggled and fell back onto the couch. "Already getting rough, oh I love it, John."
The one on the phone lowers it with a slightly troubled look, then nods to the others. With a yelp I find myself bundled into a large black car that's driven up besides us and taken to a rather ordinary building. Walking inside I get the sense of deja vu, half expecting to see my brother when I'm shown, rather firmly, into an office.
Sherlock               Striding into Mycroft's room I look around, demanding, "Have you two finished corrupting my daughter?"
Mycroft                 My eyes follow Greg as he walks out of the room angrily. I had done my share of snapping at him over the last 3 weeks, but he'd never snapped back... "Rosie, why don't we go to the garden for a little while? You can tell me how many bees you can find..." I took the little girl's hand and we followed Greg outside. Rosie took off running toward the flowerbeds, and I sat with Greg in the gazebo.
You must also help her to learn the periodic table. I promised her she could learn it this month -SH
Greg                      I gave him the biggest grin I could before heading in, sending a text to sherlock not to trust Peter if he's approached. Not to let on that you don't trust him as something is going on.
Greg                      I frowned at the text as I got dressed, trying to think back to when I would have come across that name.
John                      “You’re an idiot sometimes, you know that. Come here.” I pull his lips down to mine.
John                      “You still feel a bit warm. You should have called me last night. Or gone to the A&E. You need antibiotics.”
Greg                      I took a deep breath counting to 10 before I got in the car with Sherlock, it taking a few minutes but I was soon driving like I'd been doing it all my life. I put my phone on hands free just in case Mycroft texted or called, the radio not producing much.
Greg                      "Shit. Get down, everybody, get down!" I shout loudly to the people around me and the PCs are getting everybody to cover, my own jacket coming off to push down on his chest where he'd been shot. I was bending over him to stop any more shots hitting him.
James Morgan      I run my hand down to the hem of his shirt and start to travel back up with my nails on his skin. I place his hand on my hip. The sounds he makes are delicious enough to eat and make me hungry for more.
Mycroft                 Once Rosie had drifted off, I looked at Greg, sitting there with a silly smirk on his face. "What?"
Greg                      "Right. Well, yes please, Sherlock." I was glaring at sherlock and John myself while trying to get the blush in my face to diminish. I could see Mycroft trying to avoid my eye and I thought he was doing it because he thought it was ludicrous.
Greg                      "Thanks." I whispered, turning away to sort out the fresh bandages out and trying to remember what John had done to keep the wound clean. I was trying to distract myself from my thoughts.
Mycroft                 "In the last semester of university. One of my classmates, Eva, was quite besotted with me. I spent time with her, but... well... that was not where my interest was." I shrugged. "She'd dragged me to her bed more than once, but there was just no connection for me."
Sherlock               Grabbing my own mobile from the bed I toss it towards him, "Obviously you need to call and cancel. For a start, you're not gay. Then there's the fact you need to come with me tomorrow. I have a case from Mycroft we're working on now."
Greg                      "So it's all sorted." I smiled and knew we weren't going to be discussing it with Mycroft and I wondered what his opinion on it would be.
Greg                      "Why did she leave?" I asked with my eyes sympathetic, my heart honestly wrenching for him and I saw him shudder at just the thought of reminding himself of that again.
Greg                      It was mainly my work head that was keeping my hands so still and how I kept my cool driving. I could register John speaking words to Sherlock now and again, Rosie mainly clutching to Johns chest.
Mycroft                 I smiled as the little girl climbed into my lap, carefully. She knew I was still sore, after all
Mycroft                 I looked at Rosie in surprise. "Rosie, that's not a word you should be using, my dear."
Greg                      "I am not gonna be your slave monkey while I’m out here Sherlock." I said a little as a warning where the jet lag was still keeping up with me and he must have known I needed a coffee myself.
Mycroft                 I got up early, grabbing a few articles of clothing to throw them in the wash. I knew I would get scolded for carrying a laundry basket, so I wanted to get this started before Greg got up for the day. The twinge in my shoulder wasn't that bad, after all, and I was getting tired of being an invalid. I stepped into the laundry room and turned on the light, to find a large basket at the back of the countertop. I set the laundry basket down, and walked to the basket. Looking over the contents, I mumbled, "Dammit, that woman is determined. And not at all subtle." I shook my head at the assortment of toys, books, and catalogs, when my eyes were drawn to the boxes of condoms. I raised an eyebrow at one of the boxes - extra-large. Not for me... for Greg? Perhaps that's why he was hesitant last night? Interesting...
Greg                      "I'll take a photo for Papa, shall I? I can tell him that you sent it for him to see." I said as I pulled out my phone and let her press the button to take the photo. It was a good photo, showing Herbert's fuzziness.
Greg                      "Have you got a music player or a speaker in here?" I smiled reassuringly back at him where I should have guessed some things were still a bit raw. I got out my phone, looking through my playlists.
Mycroft                 I shivered a little at the touch of his lips, and raised my head to look at him. His deep brown eyes were soft, caring, concerned. I cupped his jaw in one hand and kissed him gently.
Rosie                     "Myca," I gotta whisper, "Gayg is asleep. He'll miss the pirate that sounds like Daddy."
Sherlock               My arm wraps around his waist, leaning into his side and gazing down at the sleeping child, before lifting my head to try and meet his lips gently, "I've told you. We owe each other nothing. You don't mention certain things I've done and I'll never hold you to things you've done. I'm just glad she's all right." pausing, I nod firmly, "Calling you was the correct thing to do, no matter what Mycroft thinks."
Mycroft                 The feel of his hands on my bare skin was exquisite torture. "You are a devil" I breathed, leaning my head back on the sofa
Mycroft                 "You have no idea how much I have wanted this..." I said quietly. my thumb brushing over his cheek.
Peter Harkness    “So the steaks here are really good if you wanna have a real American one. And you better order it Medium or Rare if you don’t wanna get deported” I laugh.
Mycroft                 "I have never deluded myself into thinking I would quit. It's you and John making that decision for me. " I grumbled.
Carlton                 I finish combing Mycroft's now trimmed hair and he checks it over quietly with my hand mirror before I remove the drape. Once again Rosie comes running over to help sweep up the trimmings and I see Greg did a wonderful job in braiding her soft blonde hair. "You going to help me leave these for the birds too, Rosie?"
Mycroft                 "I may have seen parts of an episode or two. I'm not in the habit of watching television, to be honest - I find most of what's broadcast to be mindless drivel." I shrugged. I shifted closer on the sofa, my hand coming to rest on Greg's knee.
Greg                      I nodded and softly started to rinse the wound out, trying to keep my face calmer but it looked more like anger to Mycroft. I put the patch over his wound and met his eye when he put his hand on my arm.
Sherlock               Starting to search with my phone I roll my eyes, "Well you were so busy snogging my brother goodbye that you got here late." I can't help but give a small shudder at that thought.
Sherlock               Hissing my next words, I shake my head, "That's a horrifying thought. Tell me, does his forked tongue give you any trouble?"
John                      I look over my shoulder at Greg. “Are you watching?” I turn back to Mycroft when he nods. I start pulling up the old dressing. “I’ve used the tape, so you have to be gentle when pulling it off. If it starts to bother him, you can wrap him up like a mummy.” I joke.
Rosie                     "ITS GAYG, PAPA! Don't be an idjit.  Ok. Love you. Bye bye now. Don't forget Daddy's ring". I go to the screens camera and kisses it.
Greg                      "Yeah, well, you have to be delicate with who's in charge. I don't blame you but I'm guessing you meet a lot of people, put your finger in a lot of pies." I said as I started cutting my steak, it melted in my mouth and I was going to miss this sort of food when I headed home again.
Greg                      "I knew you would, but I just like the whole supernatural aspect to it. How the new Mrs. De Winters is being turned into Rebecca by Mrs. Danvers." I smiled back, and it had been my favourite book for a long time.
Mycroft                 "And what exactly makes you think I plan to do that?" I snarled angrily, my voice getting louder. "You of all people know that I am not immune to that pain."
John                      We walk into the main hanger where there are planes parked on the ground and hanging from the ceiling.
Greg                      "Please. I hope Anthea wasn't too hard on making sure you were clean. It's just... We've had a bit of trouble lately and need to be careful with who we let in.." I explained as he started cutting and I thought I heard moans coming from the other room.
Sherlock               Hesitating I glance out in the lobby, then back to John, "Promise me before we're done here, we'll do it on his desk?"
Mycroft                 "Very okay." I said breathlessly. I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket, and without taking my lips off Greg, I pulled the phone out and tossed it across the carpet.
Mycroft                 "When I was young, I loved to cook. I could see myself as a chef... specifically, a pastry chef." I said. "Either that, or an artist. I love to draw..." I said wistfully.
Greg                      I explained to the guard who we were here to see and why, my feet carrying me through to the kitchen where sherlock had already pushed the chef aside. I waved at the rest to keep going, waving at the pair to get into an office-looking room.
Sherlock               Relaxing slightly, I nod, then shake my head, troubled once more, "She mentioned things in connection to James. Disturbing things. Taking back the country, some kind of work he was doing that she was fearful we would interfere with. I wonder if she planned to kill James as she wished to stop this work."
"No, Sweetie. Not all the time. I'm with you or Papa most of the time. I don't have a reason to be lonely." He assured the little boy as he sat the food down in the fort. He crawled into the fort and wrapped his arms around Hamish. "I'm happy." He said but he wasn't exactly sure of why he was saying it. He felt like he was happy but there was some part of him that maybe... Missed Victor still. He missed having someone to talk to. Yes, he had Hamish to talk to but it was nothing like Victor. He smirked thinking about the things he and Victor used to talk about. John hadn't spoken to Victor in about three months. He had been so busy with Alex, planning their wedding that they he didn't even have time to text anymore. "I'm fine. I really am, Sweetie. Papa will be too." He promised him before he started to eat his own food.
"All of it, Mycroft. It's all weighing heavy on me. I just want to relax and stop thinking about it, but I can't. If I try to stop thinking about the case, I think about the girls. If I try not to think about the girls, I think about Marius and how he's going to need constant love and affection. Or the case, or the Yard, or worrying about you, or John, or Sherlock, or Hamish... It's just stressful." He groaned, rubbing his temples. Mycroft changed easily and slid into the bed, gently putting his hand on Greg's back.
"John you can go back to bed if you want. I'm sure Sherlock and Greg will be back soon." Mycroft smiled as he walked over to help settled John on the couch.
"We didn't do anything and if we did we don't know how we did it." Greg answered with a chuckle. John laughed softly as well.
"I think so, yea." Victor gave him a half smile. He didn't pull away this time and they lingered for a few seconds longer than they should have before Sherlock called out at them to find out what was taking them so long. They returned to the bedroom and John prepped the injection for Sherlock before giving him the flu medication. Victor stood there with a pill in his hand for John silently demanding he take it before he lay back down.
"It's alright with me, love. So long as hands stay where they're supposed to." John said with a smirk but dissolved into a very horrid coughing fit. His lungs rattled slightly.
"Well Alex, if you two get time feel free to stop by here. Santa will be bringing a puppy so Hamish will want everyone to meet him." John offered, still smiling.
"Oh God, I want so much more than this..." He whimpered, finding John's mouth and kissing him over and over again. His hips still bucking forward slightly. He was panting and shaking and he absolutely did not want to stop kissing John, but he knew they would be at his brother's soon. "Oh John, you incredibly devious man." He smirked. John let out breathless giggle and smirked smugly at Sherlock.
"That doctor." Hamish said softly. "That means you help heal people and know what the bad men do to hurt people. That's what Daddy does. Or we could be pirates. All you have to do is close your eyes and feel like you are that person." He got a little toy out that had a teddy bear and the parts to fix him. "Doctor Marius can you fix him?" He asked seriously. "He was hurt stopping a bank robber." Mycroft smiled as he watched, leaning into Greg.
"Hm..." Mycroft hummed softly, not entirely sure what to make of the moment. He was rather envious of how comfortable Greg and John seemed. John seemed to catch on to Mycroft's distraction and a smirk crossed his face drawing Sherlock's attention.
"If you don' t mind, I'll just let you do it. My..." Shit he hated admitting how fucked up he was. "My bones are aching and my hands are shaking like crazy." He confessed and he looked to Sherlock as he came back down the stairs. "You went through my bag didn't you? Happy? I didn't bring anything controversial." He said with a faint smile.
"In front of all those people at the yard, John? You dirty thing." He giggled as they continued to kiss even more. He forced himself to pull away, smiling down at John. "No. No. See we're just getting started again, John." He warned with a smile.
drug. "Oh, that sounds lovely." He murmured as he parted John's legs and spread them wide. "You are such a perfect little pet." He lay on his stomach between John's legs, his own feet touching the floor. "Doing whatever I say. So loyal, John." He hummed as he brought his lips to John's thighs and began sucking on them each in turn, cataloguing every minute movement John's body gave him. John already wanted to move, his leg twitching involuntarily as Sherlock's lips connected with the sensitive skin and it took all he had to maintain his muscular control. He held himself firm, his breath and his iron hard cock the only things giving away how utterly desperate he was.
I drew in a sudden breath, expecting Phelps or his fiancée to recoil at Holmes’ insinuation. But both remained still and serene, as though unaware of what the question implied.
He trailed off as Holmes turned sharply away, walked across the room and shut the door in the faces of the small crowd in the hallway.
“You tripped,” he says. “Okay. And what about… What about last time, with the snake? Or the time before that, with the poison? What about when you went out of the window and I thought your brains were strewn across the pavement?”
He glanced at Holmes, still slumped in the corner, with overt suspicion. Holmes, seemingly unaware of his scrutiny, was as limp and glazed-looking as any of the drugged men I had seen below. It was only then that it occurred to me that perhaps his dazed air and red eyes were not part of a performance, but the real results of two days spent breathing opium in lieu of sleep, food or water.
“My dear Watson, I am sorry,” he said, his voice gentler than I had ever heard it. “I have not been myself these last few days, as I you surely noticed. In my conceited wish to prove myself I lost sight both of good sense and the bounds of friendship. Please believe me when I say that, extraordinary as it may sound, I did not anticipate how my words would affect you.”
John presses a mug into Sherlock’s hand as he makes his way past. Forgiven, then. He settles into his armchair and Sherlock slowly crosses the room and settles down in his own chair.
He favoured me with a brilliant smile that for a moment transformed him back into the compelling man I knew.
At that fraught instance, there came a knock at the door. Into the room strode a lady of medium height, with fine blond hair, an upright bearing and startling blue eyes. There was something about her face that gave a suggestion of great kindness and of innate strength. She was not classically beautiful, but I found her immediately appealing – she was exactly the kind of woman I had always pictured myself one day choosing to marry, in the days before the war, when I believed that my future held a comfortable medical practice, a partner who shared my interests and a clutch of children.
I arrived at Phelps’ home in Woking in a far less curious state of mind than one might expect. The question of why he wanted to see me alone paled into insignificance as my thoughts tended unceasingly to Holmes throughout the hour-long train ride. That he had begun to thaw in his attitude towards me was clear but I could not help but feel that, despite his air of indifference, my decision to visit Phelps without him had placed another wedge between us.
“You were there too,” he manages to say, his voice raw. “If anything it would have been a murder-suicide.”
Holmes stopped talking for a moment and pinned me with his most feline, calculating gaze. Suddenly, he took hold of the marmalade jar and, raising his arm as though about to bowl a fast ball, he flung it towards my head. He was still holding my right sleeve and, as he threw, his grip tightened like iron on my forearm. Startled more than I had been by any of the mornings’ unexpected events, and half wondering if he had gone mad, I lunged with my left hand and caught the jar just as it sailed over my shoulder towards the sofa, narrowly missing my ear.
"I refuse to be the princess," John said quickly. "Papa can be the princess since his hair is longer." He teased, kissing Sherlock's cheek. He could tell something was wrong with him. He was keeping his eyes closed for a reason. "I'd love to play pretend though. Papa can be the princess and I'll be...well, what do you think I could be Hamish? A king? A wizard? A hobbit?" He ruffled his hair smiling at him fondly.
"If it wasn't the truth you'd have lumped me in with Lestrade and the others the second day you knew me." He grinned. "Yes, I remember you kept talking about that for awhile after we got home." His eyes burned into Sherlock. "It isn't fair the imbalance of power in our relationship." He giggled softly, already aware that Sherlock's single touch to his hair completely derailed his mind. Sherlock gazed down at John with a smile.
"Oh no!" Hamish said and he pulled the sheet up to toss Greg a rope. "Grab on Uncle!" He shouted. "Marius - do something to convince the evil Island King to let us by!" He shouted eagerly, gripping his hand as Greg crawled into the bed.
"I know it is because of me." Mycroft said softly, squeezing Greg's hand. "They don't approve of us. But, you should still try. I had Anthea send then some Christmas presents from us. Just in case."
Victor loves Sherlock but has come to understand that he is not ever going to have his heart. So he basically takes what he can get.
"I'm proud of you," Sherlock hummed as he wiped his own forehead that was covered with sweat. "John, I hate to bother you but as soon as your done, I... I'm really hot." He panted slightly, falling back onto his chair. Victor looked at Sherlock, a frown appearing on his face.
Greg was intent on his task, his focus on the boy and the woman, so much so that he didn't see the shadow snaking its' way towards him. Sherlock however did and saw that the other man had stolen around the far side of the kitchen and was about to get the drop on the Detective Inspector. Sherlock swept over just in time to stop the pistol from colliding with Greg's head. The man seized Sherlock around the shoulders and the two struggled before falling to the floor.
"Oh I'm ready, Daddy. Let's go to the park." His smirk was a mile wide and his voice betrayed his arousal. John's cheeks were slightly red as he walked out the door, avoiding his husband's gaze.
"No. You sit. I'll rebuild." Sherlock insisted with a smile as he took John's hand and lead him to the couch. "Sit down, Dr. Watson. Dr. Holmes is in charge of fort building today." He laughed as he gently pushed him onto the couch. "I'm sure I can do it by myself." He assured the other as he began to recreate their large fort, quietly humming to himself without even knowing he was doing it.
you to tell him. He's already feeling guilty because he can see it. Don't you remember you can't hide anything from Sherlock bloody Holmes?" He smiled sadly. "I know you hate it but he hates this too. He's been texting me you know, trying to find out how to make you talk to him. Trying to ask me what to say that would make you think it's okay to open up. You two are idiots, talk to him John. Ask him to go on holiday or something with you for a few days - let Hamish stay with Mycroft or something and work this out before you explode."
Greg                      "Her flat would be a lot emptier if she'd fled." I muttered as I looked around and things like her phone charger and laptop were still around, most clothes still in the wardrobe.
Mycroft                 "Mmmm... staying here..." I mumble as my head presses against something soft... a pillow? My eyes refuse to open, but I can hear Sherlock talking to me. My shoes are slipped off, and a blanket surrounds me. "Thank you," I slur, as my mind, thoroughly inebriated, shuts down completely.
Nina Boucher      "I hung around in the back servants’ hallway for a bit to eavesdrop, and that's when I heard... I heard Willa start to cough... and knock silverware off the table" and I start crying again. "I rushed back into the dining room" I continue through my sobs, "but she was dead only a few seconds later."
Sherlock               I stand to one side, a proper sulk brewing now, watching John collect up everything with folded arms. My gaze keeps shooting back to the kitchen
Greg                      I looked into the car, jumping to the other side and I was glad when we finally started making our way to the embassy. I'd seen the way Peter had looked at me but I ignored it, my eyes looking over him when we were at traffic lights.
Greg                      I dropped off with Mycroft’s arm around me and one of my legs draped over his. I'd pulled the covers up at some point, blissfully snoring against his shoulder.
Greg                      I shivered and held my breath, blowing it out as he moved down my neck again yet I was following everything that was happening on doctor who. I had a lot of self-control and I shifted so my ground could relax a little.
Greg                      "Smithson?" I question as he leant forward and I ignored Mycroft glaring at me, it just being a simple slip of the tongue.
Greg                      "I'm fine. I'm fine." I shook when Mycroft came over and put his hand into Peters blood, everything seeming to be going in slow motion like a dream. I had to leave Peter on the floor and barely registered us leaving the room to find James.
Sherlock               Squinting after them I take a sip of my borrowed coffee, before squirming in displeasure, tipping it into a nearby plant before swirling around and making my way out the building at last.
Greg                      "Okay." I said in the same tone I had before and wandered into the kitchen, starting to sing a little louder than I had before.  I did have a goodish voice, according to my ex-wife when we first met. Mycroft’s snarling didn't scare me.
John                      “Hey! That’s a bad word. You can’t say that.” I scold her, trying not to laugh.
Mycroft                 "I was terribly chilled, so I suspect I did. I was a bit... out of sorts, too." I blushed ever so slightly, and tried to avert my eyes when John looked at me.
John                      “Interesting.” I say looking a little thoughtful. “You know, Sherlock is always a little loose-lipped when he’s sick too.”
Mycroft                 As I pulled on a pair of jogging pants and a loose t-shirt, I heard the doorbell ring, and some conversation as Greg answered it.
James Morgan      "It is disgusting! Everyone should try it once." It's nice to see a more playful side of the serious Doctor.
Greg                      "So, she's narrowed it down to what the poison was? What is it?" I hold back my smile and follow sherlock into the building. He was somehow still typing away on his phone, walking freely at the same time.
Greg                      "So am I.." I muttered with a small smile, meeting Mycroft’s eyes until he went back to tucking Rosie in. He had only smiled at me when I had come in with Rosie.
James Morgan      "Let's continue our not-date. Do you want to try the ice cream? Planetarium? They even have an indoor sky dive thingy."  Seeing his indecision, I take him by the arm that I didn't let go of earlier and steer him towards the Planetarium.
Sherlock               Without even glancing up I carry on what I was obviously saying to the empty bed besides me, "...so it seems the whole security team may be inept which means more work for us of course. You may have to cancel some of your attendance at the lectures."
Sherlock               Pulling on the trousers I realise two things. The first is that I'm still barefoot with bee painted toenails and the second is that since I last stayed here while 221B was being rebuilt I had put on a little weight, especially around the torso. Wincing I struggle to button the already tight shirt
Greg                      I had stepped back when he stumbled over my touch and frowned with how quickly he'd left. It was understandable, my feet taking me to my suite where I changed into some swimming trunks to take advantage of the embassy's pool. I had a small bag over my shoulder.
Greg                      I'd looked up when he came over and hummed in surprise when he'd just grabbed my face to kiss me. I didn't understand but closed my eyes anyway, putting my hands around his sides.
Sherlock               Suddenly my phone vibrates in my pocket, making me snatch it out and answer it, "Yes. Well? Wait, are you sure? Of course you are. You're nothing if not a professional. Good work." disconnecting the call abruptly I beam at Lestrade, "Gelsemium alkaloids Gary"
Mycroft                 I looked quizzically as he pulled away when the new song came on. I leaned back against the wall as his hips swayed seductively.
Mycroft                 I stared absently into my nearly empty glass... the alcohol was very efficiently numbing my senses, and I spoke slowly and carefully. "Some meaningless drivel about 'not being able to pass up the opportunity' I believe was the reason. How she cared for me deeply, but knew I would understand, that I would find someone else," I waved the question away like a swarm of gnats.
Greg                      I caught one of his hands when I'd lowered myself down onto him completely, my fingers squeezing his as we got accustomed to the feeling of tight heat. I looked down when he stroked my thigh and felt my insecurity feeling starting to bubble up again.
Mycroft                 "Don't be ridiculous, Sherlock." "Rosie, would you like some of my special lemonade? I made it extra sweet for you..."
Mycroft                 I chuckled. "Actually, Detective Inspector, it's probably more than I made him do it than anything else. I'm sure you've noticed he doesn’t take orders well. At least, not from most people," I shot a knowing glance in John's direction. After the curator finished his speech - in which he studiously avoided mention of the Holmes Family Trust's donation - Sherlock pasted on his most convincing smile, and stepped forward with the comically large scissors.
Mycroft                 I looked at him innocently. "I do not have anymore." It wasn't technically a lie, after all - the rest of the pack was in my desk drawer. I walked back to the kitchen grumbling, Greg right behind me.
Greg                      Over the next week, it became a lot more comfortable between us both. I was overjoyed when John asked us to look after Rosie while they went to Scotland and me and Mycroft hadn't yet talked about Caroline and kids.
Greg                      "Anyway, I was planning on doing a bit of gardening if you wanted to sit out in the garden, read a book or something if you didn't have anything else on mind?" I said as I sipped my tea and let Mycroft have the last piece of toast.
Greg                      "Well I'm no pinky... Let’s just say that." I grin down at my plate and I realised I hadn't had this sort of confidence for months. Maybe a year if my ex-wife had anything to do with it.
John                      “Right. Is that what you call whisky with an ‘e’ over here?” I sit back on the sofa with my arms crossed.
Sherlock               Ignoring him I swivel the laptop to show him some emails, pointing, "I'm going to contact Lestrade and tell him about my findings so far. I need you to go and get us coffee and then return so you can begin on her private account."
John                      “Sod this!” I throw the sheet off myself, not caring that my belt and fly are hanging open. My arms free, I’m able to assist Greg better.
Greg                      "Were not here to intrude on who you're paying your respects to, we just want to have a quick chat. If that's okay?" I said softly with a warm smile and nudged sherlock to do the same.
Mycroft                 I smiled at his quiet statement, and kissed him lightly. "You can always trust me. I would do anything for you." I said, leaning my head on his shoulder.
Mycroft                 I rest Rosie's head on my chest, and gently stroke her blonde curls. "A few more days, little one." I said softly.
John                      “No, I don’t normally eat much for breakfast. As we are always on the go. Just some coffee or tea and I’m set.”
Greg                      "I've liked men since I was 17 but never really told anyone and it's not a new thing, no, he would come around nearer the end of cases and I dunno. He just seemed mysterious, understood the hassles of a job like mine. We could have a decent chat if we had the time. " I explained.
Greg                      I'd had the TV on low anyway as I was looking through emails, reading through the latest from my brother who was travelling for a year when I heard Mycroft’s scream. It took less than a second for me to leave the laptop on the bed, rush out and then into his room to see him gasping for breath.
Mycroft                 "Let's just say she's very good at estimating. So am I," I said with a sly grin
Greg                      "I'll set up the laptop but there's no way in hell I'm waking her up. I actually want to sleep tonight." I said as I got up and knew Rosie would take a while to go back down again if she was woken up.
Greg                      I followed her into the gazebo and found some chairs for the three of us, letting sherlock sit nearer the end of the table to have a look at the honey he'd bought while I spoke with Nina. "It's about what happened with Ms. Smith. We want to know what REALLY happened."
Mycroft                 "So, I suppose you heard about Sherlock's little moment of insanity this morning..." I shifted to get more comfortable without dislodging my bedmate.
Sherlock               My gaze flicks back to him, filled with understanding, "You need to sleep. Of course."
Sherlock               Stuffing my phone away in my pocket I straighten, sweeping a hand down my coat to return it to pristine before striding in, confidence oozing from me as I attempt to sweep past security, shouting out to the guard, "Kitchen this way? Good, good..."
Sherlock               Striding up to the front door I check the names on the flats to one side before ringing the bell for Nina's flat
Greg                      I frowned at his comment slightly but left Mycroft with a blanket over his shoulders, getting a few hours’ sleep that evening before getting up early for a run. It had been a part of my routine for a while to keep fit and keep the cobwebs out of my mind.
Mycroft                 "Did you and Caroline have a whirlwind courtship like that?" I asked, genuinely curious
Mycroft                        Hearing a recognizable swagger enter my office, I took a deep breath and turned my chair around.  "Good morning, brother mine.  What brings you to the Embassy this fine day?" I glared at him.
Mycroft                 "Like a delicate rose, hearts will fade and wither, left untended, guarded from the sun. It takes someone else to make them bloom."
John                      His low voice shoots right through me. I lower my voice to a whisper. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you.” I reach out tentatively for his hand. “I shouldn’t have let it get that far. I made him stop though. Before... before...” I look away, blushing.
Mycroft                 Greg brought in a tray of food, setting it on the table beside me. I carefully balanced the bowl on the arm of the chair, and took a bite. "You are a true artist in the kitchen, Greg," I said, savouring the food. I wasn't really terribly hungry, my stomach a bit unsettled for some reason, but I managed to eat nearly half of it before I set the bowl back on the tray.
Rosie                     "Why was Gay naked? Are you and him kissing like Daddy and papa? Does he live here now?" Jumping up I throw myself at Papa, "they kissing! They in love! I'm gonna get a cousin and we'll play andhaveallsortsoffuntimesand... I don't feel so good." The juice did not taste ok coming back up. None got on my pretty dress cause Papa got it all over his pretty shirt. It hurts and don't wanna cry... " sorry Papa. I hurt. Lots." Ok, I gots to cry. Daddy says it how we feel better.
