offered to do anything around the house, especially not in the morning. Nonetheless, he sat in his chair and opened up the morning newspaper.
"Fine. I challenge you to figure out all of my secrets. Deduce me."
His thoughts screeched to a halt as he slammed into John, spilling scalding tea onto both of them.
John sighed and went back to brewing himself some tea. It was going to be a
"IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU HID AWAY THIS LITTLE LOVE LETTER FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND! TAKE A LOOK JOHN!" he threw the letter onto the floor.
"Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you landed us both under house arrest," John shot back.
Sherlock didn't reply. If anything, his ears got brighter.
"No, I think I've come to terms with it."
"Sit up, will you?"
"What the hell is this?" his father's voice was dangerous and low.
They spent their evening next to the fireplace. Sherlock was splayed across the couch, reading when John pushed his book down against his chest.
Sherlock sat in silence for a minute. He blinked several times before looking back up at John.
"If there have been multiple murders, why hasn't there been anything in the newspaper?" John asked.
Sherlock obliged, allowing John to sit, only to place his head in John's lap and continue reading his book. He saw John's smile in his peripheral vision and the next thing he knew, he was being petted like a cat. It was hard to focus on his book with John playing with his hair. The constant movement was soothing in the most peculiar way. It reminded him of a piece of his childhood that was so filled with holes. His mother playing with his hair and reading him a story as he sat on her lap. The book fell from his hands and he felt his eyes fill with tears. He didn't know why he was crying and yet there it was, a single tear rolling down his face. John noticed and stopped momentarily to wipe away the tear. His other hand placed on Sherlock's chest, the two boys stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. No, not an eternity. What they were experiencing existed somewhere outside the domain of time. They were together in the crushing vastness of an empty world, an empty universe, simply existing together. Sherlock slowly reached up to place his hand on top of John's. He needed to feel the skin beneath his own and assure himself that this was real. They sat on the ugly, old couch until the sky was black and the fire had long since burned out. Unable to stay awake any longer, Sherlock slowly drifted off. John watched him sleep for a while, admiring the peaceful look that was rare to see on Sherlock. Then, for the second time, carried Sherlock to bed and climbed in next to him.
Mycroft's smile dropped a bit before he replied. "Right again. I have a case for you."
John Watson woke up feeling more well-rested than he had in years.
"It's fine mate. You need to calm down though. You're acting like a complete nutter," John replied.
It didn't take him long to find Sherlock. In fact, he was in the first placed John checked, his bedroom. John opened the door to find Sherlock sprawled on the floor surrounded by papers, books, and his computer. He couldn't help but chuckle as he thought about Sherlock being so caught up in his work that he couldn't even be bothered to climb into bed.
The POV jumps around a bit in this chapter (as indicated by the lines).
"I think you know exactly what this is. I think you know where I found this little note."
"It's absolutely not okay! He invaded your, our, privacy for who knows how long. This isn't something a normal concerned family member does!"
"I don't know! Read, play your violin, watch shitty reality tv shows, explode the kitchen, do
"You're such a prat," John mumbled sleepily as he snuggled up to Sherlock's side.
Sherlock had woken up crying from a terrible nightmare. He dreamt that John left him, running away with some pompous blonde girl name Mary. What kind of name was Mary anyway? In his dream, Sherlock had tried to warn John that Mary wasn't who she said she was; she was a liar and a criminal. John, however, hadn't listened and ran off with this woman anyway. Sherlock had broken down in tears at not being able to save John. The tears were what finally released him from this frightening fantasy. He knew he had woken up, but being Sherlock he needed to make sure, needed to be positive that this was reality. And thus, he found himself on top of John. Well, he was on top of John for quite a while when out of nowhere he was flipped onto his back.
"I...I guess not." Sherlock replied. He looked at John in awe and grinned. "I suppose this will be fun after all."
"Make me a cup as well, will you," he said in John's general direction.
John was startled awake as Sherlock kissed him. It took him a few seconds to comprehend what was happening. Sherlock was on top of John and passionately, borderline violently, kissing him. In the interest of prolonging this rare experience, John chose to ask questions later and just go with it in the meantime. As they broke apart, gasping for air, John managed a hurried "Morning!" before proceeding to flip over and pin Sherlock under him.
"Things couldn’t be righter. They could be less caffeinated, but they couldn’t be righter. "
John stared incredulously at Sherlock and Mycroft. It wasn't like Sherlock to stand up for anything his brother did in general, least of all when it concerned him. Feeling like he had gone mad, he fell back into his chair.
"Sherlock, what are you doing?"
"I...I'm n..not sure dad."
Sherlock stood for a second in shock and then rushed to take a seat. He heard John get paper towels and mop up the spilled tea while muttering obscenities under his breath. After John had finished, he walked over and sat down across from Sherlock.
"Why didn't you tell me you were attracted to me?"
John just stared at his father in horror. He backed himself up against the cabinets, trying to distance himself as much as possible.
"Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."
"You remembered."
Sherlock Holmes woke up with the strangest feeling that took him a moment to place. Complete and utter love for another person.
"Tea, chocolates, wine, a gift card for the movie theater, and two knives...how thoughtful of you."
"What's in the basket?" Sherlock wandered over and began unwrapping Mycroft's gift.
"Anybody can look at you. It’s quite rare to find someone who sees the same world as you."
"I've got it!" announced Sherlock proudly.
"There's not much to say about the murders yet, so there's no reason to get the public worried yet. So, will you take it?" He aimed this last question at Sherlock who stared thoughtfully for a moment before jumping up.
"I can't believe you. You have done a lot of things to push me and Sherlock in the past but this...this takes the cake! You'd better have a good explanation for why you BUGGED YOUR BROTHER"S FLAT MYCROFT!" John's face was turning bright red at this point. Sherlock felt inclined to step a bit farther away.
Ten minutes later, they found themselves sipping tea in awkward silence back in the living room. Neither was sure of what to say. Finally, Sherlock broke the quiet.
John was worried about what Sherlock was thinking. Knowing Sherlock, he probably couldn't care less about John's feelings for him. He didn't seem like he understood relationships of any sort. But...for a moment he thought he had seen Sherlock's ears turn beet red. As he sat and pondered his predicament, one thought kept returning to him. One sentence that changed everything.
Sherlock stared up at John, shock and...aroused? He felt oddly hot almost like there were tiny needles prickling all over his body. Even he, as socially dysfunctional as he was, could feel the tension between him and John. It was then that a realization hit Sherlock Holmes like a ton of bricks; he wanted John Watson more than he had ever wanted anything in his whole life. Laughing, he stretched up and began kissing John once more.
"You have no clue, do you?" John laughed.
"Dad really I don't know what you're t..t..talking about."
"Sherlock, did you tell her?!"
Sherlock watched as John walked away. He felt a bit bad that he had gotten John stuck at home as well, but only a bit. He was still too overwhelmed with boredom to ponder over any one thing for an extended period of time.
"All boring. I need something to deduce, something...exciting."
John had considered it at first, but what was the point? Sherlock would see right through his lies.
Sherlock looked down into John's bright eyes, still slightly red from crying. He smiled nervously as his heart fluttered about his chest. Something had changed drastically between him and John last night, that much he could tell, but he wasn't sure precisely what. His worries were swept away the moment John smiled back at him. He had plenty of time to figure it out later. Right now, his attention was all on John.
They went about the rest of their day as normal. John worked on his blog, Sherlock played his violin, and Mrs. Hudson visited at lunchtime.
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock," John yelped. "Go sit down before you get one of us killed!"
"Oh come on, John. Think! There's always a way of finding something out." Sherlock encouraged. However, John was too frustrated to indulge in his game. The icy look he gave Sherlock stopped him dead.
"Well, as much as we would like to take it, we're currently under house arrest." John chimed in.
Sherlock glanced at John, hoping to communicate a course of action, only to see that his lovely doctor was woefully confused.
John's heart froze. When he had challenged Sherlock, he hadn't thought that...he didn't think Sherlock would be able to find out. He had only known himself for a few weeks. It had taken him a long time, his whole life really, to come to terms with the fact that he was gay. For Sherlock to figure it all out in a matter of minutes...
, and the signature
"NO SON OF MINE IS GOING TO BE A FUCKING FAIRY!" John looked up into his father's angry, red face. He had never been so scared in his life. He could feel the tears coming but couldn't cry now; that would just make his father angrier. He tried to stop, tried to keep it in, all as a single tear rolled down his cheek. He braced himself for the impact before he even knew it was coming.
One thing led to another until the two men found themselves lying side by side, undressed, and out of breath. Both were quite content to like there for the rest of the day until a knock at the door had them both jumping up and throwing on the nearest clothes. Sherlock was almost at the door when it swung open and in walked Mycroft. He was holding what looked like a gift basket and...smiling. Sherlock watched cautiously as Mycroft set the basket down on the table and turned to look at the two of them.
"It's okay John. I suppose he would have found out eventually."
John Watson stared open-mouthed at his flatmate who was currently attempting to play the violin while standing on his head. It wasn't unlike Sherlock to do some weird things, but this seemed a bit stranger than usual.
"He didn't need to. I'm not blind yet John, I can see the way you two look at each other." She giggled. "So...the room?"
"John, I know all of your secrets. I know everything about you already."
His father had always had a short temper. You never knew what would set him off. One minute has was smiling and laughing, the next you had a bruise forming and were knocked on your ass. Harry had gotten the worst of their father's anger. She was the troublemaker...but also the protector. Whenever their father went off on John, she was always there to pick him back up, to hug him, to tell him things would be okay.
His father's temper had hastily declined after the incident with Harry. At least once a day, he would go off on John for some reason or another. It was hard to continue going to school when every day you had to explain another bruise or cut to teachers who were becoming increasingly worried. He had lost all hope of ever being rescued, ever being saved from the hell that was his life.
"P...pardon?" he managed to stutter.
"Congratulations brother mine. I'm so happy you finally found someone. I really was worried that you would spend your days alone forever." Mycroft was practially beaming. "And thank you, John Watson. I'm confident in your abilities to take care of Sherlock and wish you the best of luck. You'll need it."
John figured he should probably find Sherlock before he got himself killed.
"Remembered what?" Sherlocked asked.
John's game worked well...at least for the first few days. Sherlock managed to keep himself out of trouble and John managed to write up a few cases for his blog. The flat was peaceful until the fourth day of their three-week imprisonment.
What was he going to do? Sherlock knew his biggest secret.
"Oh, shut up," Sherlock said but the corners of his mouth twitched up into a smile.
"Of course. You deserve it."
"Like what?" asked Sherlock.
"So, are you going to argue that you're straight?"
"Goodnight, Sherlock," John whispered.
He placed a light kiss on Sherlock's temple before turning to shut off the bedside lamp. Out of the darkness from the other side of the bed, he heard a faint whisper.
Then, she got herself kicked out. John watched in horror as she waltzed up to her father that day and spit in his face. She ducked under the arm he swung at her but wasn't agile enough to escape the second one that grabbed her. Their father dragged her to the door and tossed her out. And Harry...Harry laughed like hell. John looked into those gray-brown-blue eyes that so closely resembled his own as the door slammed shut.
John smiled, but he couldn't help but be worried. What if Sherlock found out...no, that wasn't going to happen. Sherlock was good, but he wasn't
"Look," John sighed. "We need to find something to occupy you. I don't think either of us will last through this house arrest otherwise."
"I'm f...fine Sherlock. B...bad dream is all. Don't worry." John managed to sputter.
"There's no way he could know anything. It's just not possible. He's not a bloody psychic!" John was frustrated and obvious to the nonverbal conversation occurring between Sherlock and Mycroft.
"Sherlock, what in the world are you doing?"
As John drank he looked up, surprised.
His father grabbed the front of his shirt before he knew what was happening. He was dragged into the kitchen and thrown onto the floor.
"I'm bored John," Sherlock replied in his usual, flippant tone. "I've never been so dreadfully bored in my entire life."
"I'll get it. You go ahead and read the newspaper."
"You what? Hold up a minute, we're you pretending to be asleep just now?" John was utterly confused and quickly becoming annoyed. Why had he chosen to live with the strangest man on earth?
John woke up at the lamp next to his bed was flipped on. He could feel the hot tears rolling down his face, but there was nothing he could do to stop them.
Sherlock rolled onto his back and waited as the blood rushed back out of his head. That was the only type of rush he would be getting for three whole weeks. He rubbed his eyes, just now appreciating the severity of his punishment.
"Terrific. I'd best be off. Congratulations again John!" And with that, Mycroft was gone and John was left wondering, as he did quite often, how he had gotten himself mixed up with these nutters.
I made a rough outline of this story. So far, we're looking at around 12 total chapters but I could add some filler fluff if you guys want it. Let me know...
Sherlock plopped down into his chair as he took the first drag. He exhaled as if had been holding his breath for months and grinned at Mycroft.
"Well, we aren't exactly normal are we?" Sherlock chuckled and looked at Mycroft. He felt like he should be cross with him, but just...wasn't.
"Yes well, there is one more gift for you brother." He pulled a cigarette out of his pocket and offered it to Sherlock who looked like he had just witnessed the second coming of Christ.
"What's my mother's maiden name?"
"Goodnight, John."
"Why didn't you just tell me, John? That's the real question. Why keep it a secret? I've never understood why people kept such odd pieces of information away from other people."
"Can I clean out the room upstairs now that you won't be needing it," she asked.
"I suppose so," replied Sherlock "Mrs. Hudson would be quite worried if she came up and we were nowhere to be found."
"I'll get the coffee then?"
"Sherlock, what are you talking about?"
"John, he knows. I'm not quite sure how, but I have a few ideas." He glared at Mycroft as he settled on the most likely explanation. It was just like Mycroft to do something like this. He should have thought about it before now. Mycroft's smile confirmed his suspicions.
"As you wish John. I'll...leave you to think. If you need me, I'll be in my room."
Instead of answering, Sherlock simply placed his arm around John's back and squeezed. John broke into tears once again but this time he wasn't alone. This time, he had Sherlock. They stayed like that for the rest of the night. Sherlock with his arm wrapped tightly around John and John pressed into Sherlock's side.
"Yeah, of course." It was John who blushed this time. He glared at Sherlock who was trying, and failing, to hide his smile.
"Here you are, John." Sherlock handed him the cup of black coffee before taking a seat in his chair to sip on the sugary cocktail he called coffee.
"Is that all? Don't tell me you came all the way here just to deliver a gift basket."
"Of course I was. You're missing the point, John. I've figured out you're secret!" Sherlock said, sitting up and beaming at John
"Just some essentials for any new couple."
"Are you sure?"
Sherlock got off of the bed and began pacing around the room. He had obviously stopped listening to John's questions.
"How long were you in here waiting for me to come find you? Have you honestly just spent the entire morning lying on your floor pretending to be asleep?"
They laughed and clambered out of bed, neither really wanting to ever leave.
"I'll need everything you've gotten from the crime scenes, files on any possible suspects, and a computer. This is going to be fun!" He ran to get John's computer and start working.
"You looked liked you needed me. There was no way I was going to leave you in that state. You were a complete mess."
"Thank you for last night, Sherlock. Thanks for not leaving me."
"Actually, I had that lifted a few days ago. I didn't want to ruin your fun so I 'forgot' to mention it." This brought a smile back to Mycroft's face as he explained it.
John choked on his tea and Sherlock looked rather amused.
"IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME JOHN? AM I MISSING SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THIS NOT BE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE."
John picked up the note and frantically read it. The words were blurred and unintelligible; in fact, they were complete jibberish. On the whole page, there were only a few words that made any sense.
three weeks.
John was surprised. Sherlock
He grabbed his bag off of his bed and quietly left his room, mentally saying goodbye to the only home he had ever known. At the bottom of the stairs was his father who was obviously drunk. He was holding something in his hand, a piece of paper, possibly...a note. John froze on the stairs. He knew what was coming.
"Reckon we should get up?" John asked.
He smiled to himself and bent down to pick up the sleeping Sherlock. He lifted him with surprising ease and carried him over to the bed. Just as he set Sherlock down, the man's eyes flew open and he grabbed John's wrist. John stood, frozen in shock, as Sherlock stared deep into his eyes.
“You know when you said that I could make constellations out of glow-in-the-dark stars?” John said. Then snorted a laugh. Then, “I don’t know any constellations.”
So why, then, why did his blood feel like acid when he looked at him?
“You don’t have the technology here to feed me intravenously,” he had spat. “What are you going to do?”
James’ idea. Not John’s. Maybe all this didn’t mean what Sherlock had assumed deep down, then.
is where Muhammad is?” John said.
Lestrade had already had a few glasses of something by the time they all arrived, by the colour of his cheeks and the frequency with which he swore, considering he wasn’t particularly clean-mouthed anyway. His being in such a state emboldened Glen to ask if they could have more beers, and the lack of resistance was a little worrying.
On returning to the kitchen, John had his arms crossed over his chest, his expression fighting amusement. “What are you doing?”
After a shower, it was suddenly difficult to decide what to wear. He was standing in front of his open wardrobe with only boxers on, a pair of jeans hanging over one arm, considering his options, when his phone chimed.
He found himself absently scrolling through their old conversations.
“Really?” Jamie replied, and his tone of surprise made John look up.
Did John think of himself as Sherlock’s friend? Sherlock had never considered it. That word had never come to mind. Didn’t know at all how John felt about him, actually. Were they friends? They were certainly in each other’s company quite frequently. But John had friends. Stamford, his rugby team – he appeared to be everyone’s friend. He smiled at everyone and anyone, chatted to everyone as if they were his long-lost siblings. Sherlock was nothing special to him.
John tsked. “All this talk of you not going to uni is dead bant, mate, completely dead.”
“How many more words?”
As they approached the fence of the paddock, Sherlock called to the horses, whistling and clicking his tongue.
Sherlock watched him.
“Really mature, John,” John copied.
John tailed off as he noticed Harry and his mum coming towards him.
Finally: “Now, to the winners.”
He had had half a mind to bring Harry’s lab coat, but had thought at the last minute that perhaps that would be coming on a little too keenly a little too soon.
He still remembered the way to his apartment.
I tried my hardest with the French, but if any people who are better at French than me spot any mistakes please please let me know in the comments!
” John half shouted, exasperated.
Also, this turned out way way way longer than I was expecting. You know when authors say things like 'I have no control over the characters, they do things and I write them, not the other way around'? Yeah well I discovered for myself the slightly worrying truth in that. Like, I had a list of things that needed to happen in this chapter but they only make up about half of it.
Two boys, the only colour against miles of white.
Sherlock shushed him as they turned out of the fringe of the woods and picked up the pace. They approached the art block from behind, and stopped for a moment against the wall.
, Glen,” John repeated, fists clenched so hard his hands shook.
They were walking up the lane towards the family’s stables, being careful not to slip on road that had been made lethal with black ice. The air was sharp with frost, the sky white. Sherlock’s favourite kind of weather.
The year nines and lower sixth fell over each other to get up the stairs and into safety first. John waited behind and ushered the thirteen year olds along, taking up the rear. Lestrade had reached the stairs and was catching up, but John caught a glimpse of a mischievous smile and a wink from the housemaster before he turned and leapt up the stairs as fast as he was able without slopping the hot chocolate out of the mug.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed. “New teachers are a blessing. I was banking on him being clueless.”
“Yeah, he’s great.”
John perched on the plastic bench and shivered. He tried to subtly bury his face in his scarf but to no avail, opting to ball his fists in his blazer pockets and make himself as small as possible, thankful for the shelter of the bus stop from the biting breeze.
The song ended as they turned off the main road and onto the one that led down to Doyle, and the silence was filled with chatter and laughter.
“Just because you can’t get a girl,” Anderson retorted, puerile and tiresome. “Oh, wait, not that you’d want to, you fucking poof.”
The boy took a breath. “I’m fine,” he said. “He was just so young, you know? Just a puppy.”
“That graffiti of a pig in the head master’s gown that appeared on the side of the cricket pavilion last half term.”
“It was my pleasure,” Sherlock said, and there was nothing appeasing or automatic about his response. As much as he would have liked to remain in John’s arms until the sun had set and the earth had stopped spinning and the sky had gone dark, he knew the Watsons were waiting to speak with John. So he said, “Speaking of your mother and Harry…”
“Both situations still require a motive, which I haven’t yet… what are you doing?”
The threat of the syringe had been lost in the excitement of the competition. John would only remember it later that evening, when he would mention it to Sherlock while they were brushing their teeth, whose forehead would crease.
Jamie frowned. “I guess? I mean, no-one gets on with everyone in their house, but he seemed all right. Why?”
And he also hadn’t realised. Made real, made it real. It hadn’t felt wrong, making it real, saying it. Neither mouth nor brain had stumbled, merely walked on like it was a step known to muscle memory. Either wooden or choreographed. Either or. Both.
, Sherlock thought sourly.
Sherlock seemed to be making a beeline for Angelo, marching through the entire first rugby team, who all gradually ceased their drills and stared as this stranger made his way through their midst.
“No, why?” John asked, putting in the code and holding the door open for the others.
“We were never together in the first place. Sherlock – ”
“Was never taught. Never had the necessity, nor the chance.”
“Stop patronising me, John,”
“So, as most of you will know, a couple of weeks after half term is the house singing competition.”
“Did you know he was gay?” asked Vlad.
“Be quiet,” Sherlock snapped, and John smirked. Angelo did as he was told, and then Sherlock seemed to settle on a plan. “What house is Staunton in?” John and Angelo began to answer, but Sherlock ploughed on. “Meet us there, Angelo. Five minutes. You know the code to get in, yes?”
John followed Sherlock downstairs with a rumbling stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You off?” John asked.
“Oh, it’s not really his thing, and my mum’ll screw if I leave the house.”
“And who’s this?” John asked, hesitantly touching the neck of the other horse who was snuffling at his hair.
“We should search his room – maybe one of you could interrogate?” Anderson said.
Sure enough, John stepped out from a changing room at the other end of the hall, and Sherlock’s hand drew and raised his pistol faster than he could stop it. John was wearing what looked like a life vest over a hoodie - but the vest was covered in wires and bulges and plastic and -
Sherlock watched his friend’s upside-down face, neutral in concentration, his eyes intense blue to match the intense light that almost seemed, from Sherlock’s vantage point, to be coming from his hands.
As soon as the bell rang at the end of the lesson, John was on his feet and out the door before his teacher could bring up his digression. Luckily she seemed to have forgotten about it after her conversation with Moriarty, but he didn’t want to take any chances.
“Hey, come on,” Victor followed him. “You didn’t even give me a blowjob for pulling that black out for you, and that was risky – ”
Sherlock met John’s gaze and seemed to scrutinise him for a moment before taking a breath and  -
Sherlock reached over the metal of John’s bed and whisked the sketchpad away for scrutiny, ignoring John’s protests. His eyes narrowed.
Sherlock panted, looking over his shoulder at John, then back to the small puddle at his side. If John wasn’t mistaken, he thought he’d seen a glint of panic in his friend’s eye.
“Mhm. Didn’t really occur to me that they’d even need to go to school. I don’t see what a couple of GCSEs are going to do for you if you’re going to be sixteen forever,”
“I don’t care,” John said, and surprised himself with the truth of it. “I’m going to be a doctor. This is training.”
a minute,” Sherlock said urgently. John sat down on the outer window sill, legs dangling down the side of the house.
There was a burst of noise. John felt rather than saw the guests’ heads turn towards the source of the sound.
Just then, Sherlock’s phone chimed. The boy brought it out from his pocket, looked at the screen, and made a noise of satisfaction. “See?” He said, holding the device out so John could see the screen. A text message from Mycroft.
began slowly and whimsically, Sherlock plucking at the strings. He and Mycroft were working together more harmoniously than John had ever seen them before. Sherlock coped magnificently with some impossibly high notes, and John realised how much he’d missed hearing his friend play. Of course, he’d heard his waltz, but there was nothing like seeing him move with the music, as if the violin was controlling him, not the other way around. There was nothing like seeing his face, smoothed over in concentration, calm even in the faster parts, of which there were many. John now understood why Sherlock had called it ‘technical’, though his face never betrayed any signs of difficulty. John couldn’t take his eyes off him; he was mesmerising.
“Well, there’s room for improvement,” Sherlock teased, and John pretended to be offended, putting a hand over his heart, before rolling his eyes.
It was still snowing lightly outside, so Sherlock and John decided against going for a walk in the village. Instead, they lounged in the drawing room.
“They can come and visit, and you can teach me French so I can get my degree eventually.” Sherlock hummed, amused, and John realised that he wasn’t joking in the slightest. He wanted to cook for Sherlock. He wanted to be a part of wherever and whatever Sherlock called home. Perhaps not in France, but somewhere safe. Somewhere quiet, where they could go on walks at night like this and not worry about what was lurking around every corner. The fantasy was bittersweet, coloured by the fear that was fuelling it and the knowledge that it was completely, utterly impossible.
“About me? Is it not about a case?”
“Ah, John, good, let’s listen to the recording.”
“Yes, yes, go on,” Sherlock instructed impatiently.
“Delete it,” Sherlock said immediately. “And how did you manage that?”
John glanced at Sherlock, and that smile got even wider, just for a moment, as he stood, getting his breath back, chest heaving, panting, but grinning, glowing, and Sherlock felt something inside him shift.
[in which Sherlock does some online shopping]
By the time they reached the front door, they had both nearly fallen over on the slippery path and had their mouths open, breath coming in irregular clouds of vapour and laughter. John’s hand touched the wood before Sherlock’s, so he wrenched the door open, but Sherlock pushed past him into the house.
, a jigsaw piece from a different puzzle. It was petty and jealous, but he wanted the bubble of his and Sherlock’s world to remain just that, a bubble. Sacred, almost. His.
“Oh, do mine, do mine!” Harry chirped.
“Richie,” the boy said, in a soft voice with a barely-detectable sing-song accent of some kind. “Richie Brook.”
“Where did you get it from?”
“Oh, I know you, the one John’s always banging on about, his genius bestie or some shit, right?”
“What do you think it means?” John asked, catching up.
John closed his eyes in comic bliss, grinned, wide, and it was funny in a way that Sherlock couldn’t quite work out, the nuts almost spilling out from between his lips. Sherlock snorted and threw a nut at his friend, which bounced off his forehead. John opened his mouth, presumably to protest, but due to the sheer amount of chestnuts stuffed in his mouth, no intelligible sound came out, but plenty of nuts did, somehow making John look even more surprised than before. Sherlock found himself laughing as his friend tried to catch the nuts tumbling from his mouth, but John laughing as he did so, which made the task nigh-on impossible, and both boys were giggling like primary school kids, nuts everywhere.
“Did he not have massive withdrawal? What with the cocaine
His breath curled into the air in a white mist.
“That’s what we’re trying to work out,” John insisted, “and I wanted to know, did Carl have any… enemies?”
As they walked upstairs, Sherlock was saying something about Mycroft and the spy, but John was only half listening. He was battling with himself whether or not to bring up what Mrs Hudson had just implied. It was his instinct to do so, to make a joke out of it. Because it was funny. It was the kind of thing he would joke about. But as soon as he’d opened his mouth to say something, his throat had refused to co-operate. Something about it made him hesitate. It felt like someone had turned off the lights and now he was fumbling in the dark.
John returned home with brown parcel paper, string, and a card.
He nudged his friend. “They’re checking you out,” he said, knowing that Sherlock would know who John was referring to.
“Oh, it tastes like petrol,” John said airily. “So it’ll make wine taste like candyfloss in comparison, and I doubt you’ll care by that point,”
If John had been the praying type, he would have been on his knees in the mud. Which, by coincidence, he was.
John grinned back, and felt something spark like a fuse in his stomach. “Oh, here comes the French bit, listen,” he said, tugging on Sherlock’s hands to pull him closer. He wound himself around the boy, still dancing terribly (he knew) while singing,
(See the end of the chapter for
John smiled to himself. “I know.” A pause. “Did I ever tell you about the time my family went on holiday to France and dad nearly got arrested?”
After a moment of hesitation, John’s reply came rushing out in almost one breath. “That’s the thing – he just won’t talk to me. About anything. About whatever’s going on in that head of his. All he says is ‘
“Ah, John Watson. To what do I owe this pleasure?”
don’t know about how your father died,” Sherlock reminded him.
Sherlock shot him a quizzical look, then his eyes widened as he caught up with John’s train of thought. “Carl Powers?”
There were loud, indignant calls of “What?” and “That’s not fair!” from the Year Nines, until the group of Year Elevens next to them politely quietened them with graphic death threats.
“Good morning, John,” he said, voice a little hoarse.
He straightened his legs, his backside rising, ducking his head. John gripped the edge of the railing.
“Hey, John,” Mike struggled to raise his voice above the din of the school streaming out of the slowly rotting doors. “We’re going to Speedy’s, you coming?”
“Jesus, Sherlock, what’re you looking for?” he asked, closing the wardrobe door.
“Hmm. There’s just one thing I can’t work out,” Sherlock began.
Sherlock was only just on time for biology. He made sure to slow his walking pace to a casual saunter before he got to the classroom, not knocking before entering.
Before John could ask what Mike was talking about, Mike carried on. “Anyway, that fight was the first of many. Glen, of course, tried to get revenge, and would probably have beaten Sherlock to death if Lestrade hadn’t been showing a prospective student's family around the house at the time and heard them fighting in the toilets. They were each given a warning and detention every day for a week, and they left each other alone after that. Even Glen isn’t that stupid. But there were a few other skirmishes here and there, and not only with boys from Doyle, either. One kid, Anderson -”
Adjustment of the duvet, a body slipping into bed beside him. Sherlock turned over and opened his eyes. John was looking back at him.
“She’s Viola’s half-sister, right?” John interjected.
“Well,” John faltered. “Of course, if you don’t want to do, then that’s absolutely fine – ”
Sherlock must have noticed his expression, because he began to explain what each one was, adding his own judgement about the edibility of each, finishing with completely denouncing the cheese-stuffed bell peppers as 'inedible'.
“I can’t see anything,” he told Sherlock. “Like, at all. He’d definitely dead, but I can’t tell how.”
“Sherlock. Look at me.” John said, fighting to keep his voice steady. His friend slowly raised his head again, and those eyes, so clear, met his. “You have to understand that you cannot do things like that. You just can’t. Not with me. You understand, don’t you? Not with me. You mean too much to me. If you’re bored, say so, and I’ll entertain you, but don’t pull shit like that. I was out of my mind with worry. I was going to – Christ, Sherlock, don’t do that again. Just don’t.” John felt a lump in his throat and tried to swallow it down, without success. “Please.”
evading censorship…” Sherlock turned. He was smiling. “She’s a good journalist. But she’s not smart.”
“Jesus Christ,” he wheezed. “I knew this game tomorrow was big but not this big.”
, sneered Glen in John’s head. “I didn’t say that.”
“Yes, but I wasn’t entirely…” Sherlock waved a hand at head-level.
“Nothing, it’s just that you don’t exactly seem like – ” Claus began, but John interrupted.
“That’s where he buried them,” Sherlock said. “Someone’s dug them up.”
sorry, but you’ll just have to go without.” At this, she rose, walked to him, and placed a perfect, poisonous kiss on his cheek.
“Actually, that wasn’t really a question; those locks of yours need a wash,” John said, ushering Sherlock into the bathroom.

He stood still for a moment, torn. If he missed football practice, he’d be in detention, but he couldn’t leave his phone, not now. Not if Sherlock was in danger, and it certainly sounded as if Sherlock was in danger.
He turned to John, and had never felt so relieved than when he saw that John was smiling – beaming, in fact, from ear to ear.
John shrugged. “You like to be in control, and alcohol takes control away. So I would have thought you’d’ve been completely miserable.”
John watched a tiny smile spread itself across Sherlock’s lips.
“What’s he saying?”

“Out,” called Sherlock as he opened the door and marched away into the corridor.
“Same as the earrings,” Sherlock agreed.  “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that both this and the Turners’ case began with stolen jewellery, but I can’t quite work out the connection yet.”
“Do you
Soon enough, the other passengers (whom he could count on one hand) began to do the same, and there was the screeching of the brakes on the track and the headlights and the scrolling text on the front was the same name that Sherlock had texted him, and John breathed out.
When the tempo started speeding up and the song approached the part where Sherlock had stood at the front of the stage, much to everyone’s horror, John turned to him.
[in which John and Sherlock lose their tempers]
“So you saw the circle, then?” Muhammad said with a small smile. “I hoped someone would. It was a small hope, but still.”
“But I’m nearly done,” Sherlock whined.
“Shit, was that tonight?” John asked. He was fully aware that it had been that night.
For all its terrible moments, Sherlock found being back at school… refreshing. To have a rhythm other than his circadian was calming. He had things to do, places to be: his mind had far fewer opportunities to collapse in on itself when he had things to learn and people to deduce other than his sterile brother and aunt. And John, of course. Living with John again was like cool water on feverish skin.
“Front page?”
“Yeah,” Smith said, snatching the paper. “He wasn’t the angel you made him out to be in your Herald piece, you know.” When John simply looked at the man, he went on, “Oh, yes, I read that. Very emotive, very stirring. But you missed out the part where he beat up my nephew.”
John’s fingers hovered over his phone screen for long moments as he tried to parse the uncomfortable cocktail of emotions he had choked down in the upheaval of moving schools. He found that it was impossible.
“No, no, I - ”
“Oh, do you have the money? I’ve got everyone else’s,” Mike asked. John handed him his and Sherlock’s shared sixteen pounds. “Sherlock, will you keep watch? Lestrade shouldn’t see anything as long as he doesn’t leave his house, so tell us if he does, yeah?”
,” Sherlock answered without opening his eyes. “It’s a poem by Ovid.”
It was stuffed on the Tube. It was only a short ride to the shopping centre, but it felt like a lot longer than that due to the discomfort of being squished up against strangers. And Sherlock. They weren’t quite touching, but John’s view was a very close-up one of Sherlock’s neck. Not that he could see much of it, as his friend’s usual blue scarf was wound protectively around it. Sherlock had once hand on the bar above their heads, making his coat fall open a little, revealing a typical light blue shirt. John had never really noticed how tight his shirts were – either that, or Sherlock had put on some weight since he’d first met him. John hoped it was the latter.
“Again, I didn’t fuck him,” John repeated, trying not to let his irritation filter into his tone.
“How is your new job going, Mrs Watson? I was sorry to hear about the cat,” Sherlock asked.
John frowned and turned back. He frowned harder upon seeing the caller ID.
“Probably best if you don’t say the hopefully bit,” John corrected. “Thank you Molly.”
He pushed it to the back of his mind.
“I know it’s fine. But?”
“John, would you like to stand up for me?”
“John?” He saw that the boy was shaking. “Are you hurt?”
“Sherlock!”
By the time Vlad returned with his laptop, the room had been cleared and a couple of people had left to get more duvets and cushions. The laptop was placed precariously upon a pile of pillows and Sherlock and John settled on their stomachs in front of it, others behind them, some sitting with their backs against the door, some on the bunk beds looking down.
Now she opened her eyes, and clumsily wiped the spit off her chin.
They took their toast upstairs and Sherlock sat on the floor while John fiddled with his laptop. He couldn’t remember when he’d given John his password, or allowed him to use the machine without asking, but he supposed he must have done. He was preoccupied with trying not to eat while scrolling through the local news’ website on his phone when some drums started up.
“I appreciate the concern, John,” Sherlock said, and John got the feeling he didn’t appreciate it at all. “But you are neither my doctor nor my mother, so you need not fuss like you are.”
“I think my mum’s going to propose to you at some point,” John commented, once they were out of sight of the house.
“I do,” John hastened to reply, “I do. I just - are you sure it was them? You were standing far away, could - ”
“So what did they bribe you with to get you to do house swimming?” John asked, only partially joking.
Instagram account - she at least had the sense not to present that information to the teaching staff via Dr Day, who read and signed off on everything that was published in the paper. Instead, she talked around it, alluding to his previous cases, something to do with Irene Adler, and… his swimming career. She focused on his swimming career rather a lot for such a short piece.
“It’s very easy to understand. Every single member of each house must participate in this competition - ”
“I heard your violin when I came in, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, looking at him, those eyes like an x-ray, cutting through to the meaning, speaking so precisely in the language that they had built up over years spent in each other’s company, their language of implication and layers. Sherlock knew what Mycroft was saying, knew that he knew that he was composing. And composing with a purpose. A recipient. “You could invite a friend.”
John nodded in reply, too preoccupied with worrying about Sherlock to respond properly. What if he messed up and everyone laughed at him? He took pride in his musical ability; that would affect him more than he would let on.
is of yours. It keeps my brain from rotting in this godforsaken hell-hole.”
“You? You never go into town,” Victor replied, narrowing his eyes. He didn’t even jump at Sherlock’s sudden appearance.
His brother had told him many a time that he was too melodramatic. Sherlock had always believed that he was simply honest.
, but John took no heed, “ – then I will. I have been told I have a bottomless stomach, so we’ll be fine.”
“We can’t,” Sherlock insisted.
“Shh,” his friend interjected as someone turned off the lights.
“You’re leaving?” he whined.
He was supposed to stay in front of the stage for the entire song, and John could feel the confusion spreading through the boys either side of and behind him as he climbed the steps and began to walk in front of them.
Mike popped his head round the door. “Sherlock in?”
“Is he?” Mrs Watson asked, and the curiosity on her face was barely masked as nonchalance.
“He told me.”
“I’m being serious,” his friend said, giving John one last shake before letting go of him and folding his arms across his chest. “You should do it, and soon. Before half term. You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don’t shoot, John.”
Angelo shook his head. “He never - he wouldn’t…”
right there
He felt John sigh against him. “Yeah, I know,” and the sudden cold air where there used to be skin was worse than Sherlock had been expecting.
“You think I’m… attr-?”
“You gave those little brats the canapés, didn’t you.” Sherlock said. It wasn’t a question.
Sherlock sat next to him. “
. He thought of Sherlock in the darkness, thought of Sherlock thinking of John and the dawn and the stretch of eternity into the night. But it wasn’t sadness, not quite, because as the poem coloured the dawn, so the dawn coloured the sky outside John’s window.
“Sleep well?”
John laughed. It was either that or punching the twat. “Fucking diva, you are,” Sherlock’s eye-roll was practically audible. “When do rehearsals start?”
Whistle, and they threw their arms backwards. The spectators roared, and Doyle came third, and John grinned.
“No, do it yourself,” John dismissed.
A couple of hours later, Sherlock was playing around with a few chords on his violin when John returned from Army.
“What does my presence matter?” Sherlock said, now having given up with his spoon and dipping his finger into the milk.
“Eddie,”
Kitty waved her hand in front of her. “No, no, I don’t want to hear it. Of course you’re good enough. And Dr Day likes you. Says you’ve written some really interesting pieces. I tend to agree with him,” she said casually, inspecting her nails. “You know the editor has a say in who takes over from them?”
“Can you see the old oak tree? Can you see the fields in the gap to the right of it?”
“Did you take it?”
They stood in silence for a moment, the horses nosing at their hands, looking for food.
“Muhammad?” John said quietly. “Can you hear me?”
He wasn’t sure who started it, or even if it was allowed, but in a millisecond the pitch was flooded with spectators. Girls running, shrieking, towards their boyfriends. Parents being slightly more dignified, their faces bursting with pride. And Sherlock felt a push on his back.
“Get back inside, Sherlock,” his brother said wearily.
“Oh, shut up, John,” said Sherlock from his wardrobe.
John’s veins were pumping lead around his body; he was becoming heavier with every heartbeat, and pulling on his pyjama trousers was a herculean effort. But he couldn’t sleep. If he did, who would watch Sherlock?
to – ”
Sherlock tried to pull his arm away again, but Victor held fast. “What’s in that?” Sherlock asked, nodding at the needle poised above the soft skin of his inner elbow.
“Jesus Christ,” John cursed quietly. “It’s like fucking Narnia.”
“And?” said John. “You like?”
Sherlock looked closer at John’s drawing and realised it was different to the one he had been in the process of however long ago ten minutes actually was. John noticed him looking.
Sherlock unclipped the final fastening and stood, loosening the jacket before throwing it across the floor. It skidded to a stop next to his gun.
“Yeah. His roommate, actually,”
“Just come and sit with us, dear!”
, he thought,
“And you,” John said, always fighting the urge to add a ‘sir’ when speaking to the man.
“Congratulations,” he said, and John took a step towards him and for a moment Sherlock thought he was going to kiss him, but he was simply squeezing past him to walk up to the stage.
Except that John and Sherlock were fully clothed beneath their duvets. As soon as the door closed, John ripped back his covers and sat up. “It’s hotter under there than I’d thought, Jesus,”
“I – I don’t know what I thought.”
John opened his mouth to say
Sherlock scoffed and looked away, but after a moment, his eyes flicked back to John and he seemed to be fighting back a smile.
John frowned. “Sherlock? You okay?”
John walked into his bedroom with a box of Halloween things in his arms to find it empty. “Sherlock?”
“Sherlock, that would be lovely of you, how sweet of you to offer!” John said, and knew his friend would be rolling his eyes.
In fact, so taken by surprise was he that he fell backwards onto his rump, feeling more foolish than he could ever remember feeling up to that point. He looked very stubbornly at her feet – toenails painted blood red – as they padded over to him. She crouched down, put two fingers – the same shade as her toes – beneath his chin and raised his eyes to hers. Her hair tumbled around her shoulders, her eyes were lined with flicks of green. She was not beautiful. She was terrifying.
That threw John a little, a flicker of confusion passing over his face, and Sherlock claimed a private victory. Victory over what? He wasn’t sure.
“Town?”
Molly gave Greg and Sherlock a small wave as she gathered her things and followed the man out.
“Who’re you texting?” John asked, barely intelligibly through a mouthful of rice.
“Borrow.”
He pushed on it, but with no result.
“John, hi,” he said shortly.
,” he imitated under his breath.
John’s laughter subsided into chuckles and he straightened up. “Christ almighty, that was amazing. I wasn’t expecting you to do anything,” he walked over to Sherlock and stuck out his hand. The ‘pirate’ took it and John pulled him to his feet, grinning at him. “You made those little girls’ night, you know that?”
John snorted. “If that’s what you want to call it,” he said, speeding up so that he reached the fence a little before Sherlock did, giving him time to crouch next to the gate that opened onto the garden and gather himself.
John watched Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. “No promises,” he replied, and there was just enough wryness in his tone to comfort John that the conversation hadn’t upset him.
John was on his feet, then, and so was Glen, and the other boys leapt up, leapt between them, arms out, hands on John’s shoulders.
“No-one,” John replied, returning to his mopping.
Therefore, the first time Sherlock saw the competition was a few nights later, at the awarding of the prizes.
Muhammad glanced at his friends. “Uh…”
“So you say that you weren’t, in fact, anywhere near Dickens at the time of the…” the head master sighed, rubbing his eyes. “At the time of the murder?”
“I don’t need to.”
“Ah, John,” he began, getting up. “Thank you for coming on such short notice, my brat of a nephew changed his plans last-minute and my sister’s at work, thinks the whole world revolves around him…”
John rolled his eyes. “It’s not about queen and country. It’s about helping people. It’s about…”
He didn’t want to risk calling him in case he was hiding from someone and he gave him away.
“Are you going to be there?”
The machine
” Henry replied with a cock of the head and raised eyebrows.
John watched her turn and walk off. He wasn’t sure what had just happened, but he had the vague feeling he’d been threatened.
getting better.”
Boscombe had won first possession. But that was alright. John preferred defence anyway.
Sherlock laughed, and John felt himself grin in response.
“A simple ‘thank you’ would be nice,” John said. “And what crisps?”
“Oh, this is my – ”
“Mm, yes,” John replied, and there appeared a small crease between his eyebrows, but before Sherlock could try to understand it, John was turning away and flicking on the lights. When he turned back, his expression was careful, and for once Sherlock couldn’t read him, so when the request came, it was a little surprising. “This is going to sound a little strange, but I need you to – well, would you mind, uh, taking your top off?”
“Uh, school?” John replied, locking the door behind him. “Why was the door unlocked, Harry? You’ve got to keep it locked when you’re home alone,”
you to come because I didn’t
Nutmeg whinnied and shook his mane. Aristotle nuzzled John’s cheek and Sherlock laughed.
Sherlock was still holding John’s arm. He’d forgotten. He let go. Neither boy acknowledged this.
“Encore?” he called. The crowd replied enthusiastically. Sherlock turned and said something to Mycroft, who raised his eyebrows and left his seat. “Alright. But this is the last one, and it’s only short.”
“Nothing,” insisted Sally, and while Sherlock had yet to teach John his mind-reading tricks, he could still spot a liar. “I’m only trying to help you out, that’s all.”
“Likewise, Mrs Watson – and you must be Harry,” Mike was saying, shaking her hand, and Harry smiled at him. “But I’m afraid we really do have to leave you now. I’d love to talk with you later, though, after the match.”
“How’re you feeling?”
He watched as John applied a plaster to the child’s knee, wiped his small, angry tears from his cheeks, smiled at him. John, the font of infinite patience and kindness.
John read the piece quickly, wanting it over with. Kitty had cleverly avoided any explicit mention of Carl or the
The man sitting behind the desk looked up as he approached. By his appearance, he seemed to be on the precipice of middle age.
“I wasn’t aware I had a curfew,” John replied, kicking off his shoes and clambering up onto his bed and collapsing. Sherlock had insisted on John’s swimming lessons being nightly since their first one on Monday, and the loss of sleep was catching up with him.
Eddie was staring at him with something like disbelieving awe which made John a little uncomfortable. John addressed him. “With your permission, obviously,”
John leaned in. “Come to the loo with me,” he instructed, giving his sleeve a small tug as Pullman launched into their final few bars. As soon as the music had finished, John slipped out of his seat.
“So I’m picking the air mattress. Simple.”
leads me to believe you acquired it at the same time of your loss, which subsequently leads me to believe that you were somehow involved. Bet there's a lot of guilt
“When Glen swung a punch at his head, Sherlock dropped, grabbed Glen’s ankles and pulled them out from underneath him. Glen fell backwards suddenly and heavily, and Sherlock was still holding onto his ankles tight while he fell so he couldn’t do anything to protect himself from the impact, and the back of his head slammed into the floor. The rest of us - well, except Vlad – rushed in to try to pull Sherlock and Glen away from each other, but before we could do anything, Sherlock was standing over Glen. He still had his shoes on, and he stamped on Glen’s stomach, hard, and again, with his foot twisted so he got Glen’s solar plexus and winded him. Then, Ollie, who was closest, managed to get his arms around the little bugger and drag him away, but not before Sherlock kicked Glen in the spine, which was exposed from when Glen curled up on his side to protect his stomach. Hmm, I kind of fancy a Magnum.”
Since Sherlock’s first moment of confusion on Thursday night, there had been several more over the weekend. It would have been barely noticeable to anyone who didn’t pay him the amount of attention John did, but Sherlock had paused in a long, rambling monologue on Friday, having forgotten a word. On Saturday, between bouts of vomiting, he had described something that had happened a week previously as having happened that morning. On Sunday, John had returned from the shower to find him putting his uniform on and had looked genuinely surprised when John had told him there was no need. Sherlock himself had seemed entirely aware of and unperturbed by these minute lapses, asking John what his face looked so worried about. John had tried to laugh his worry off along with his friend, but with little success.
He looked at his own, resting in his lap.
“He’s much taller than dad,” Harry said after a moment, and John tried not to think too hard about that.
“Our aunt came to stay.” Mycroft said wearily. “Well. Not stay. She moved in. We didn’t tell Sherlock because we knew he’d just refuse to come home from school. When he did come home on Friday to find her in our mother’s old chair, he went to his room and didn’t come out for four days. Needless to say, we all tried to coax him down, but to no avail.” He sighed. “When he did come out, finally, yesterday at around lunchtime, he was being uncomfortably civil. Even ate with us. I went to my study, thinking it was all right to leave them alone together, but not five minutes later, I heard the door slam and Sherlock was striding down the driveway with a bag over his shoulder. Viola – our aunt – looked so much like our mother when I questioned her about it. Anyway, it was only after a few hours of worrying that I realised he’d go to you.”
“I still feel nauseous,” Sherlock replied, and he sounded unsure. “I haven’t eaten a thing for over a day and I still feel nauseous. I don’t understand.”
“Fuzzy, yes, I know,” John finished. “But you’re going to get drunk at some point in your life, right? And I always think it’s best to do new things for the first time with people you trust.” John raised an eyebrow. “You trust me, don’t you?”
Here, Sherlock stepped up to Nadia and held her by the arms, smiling, before letting go and going back to the marks on the floor. Nadia seemed a little alarmed, but at least she was listening now.
He was holding a cup of something, and he was standing there in his ridiculous coat, scarf wrapped around his neck, those gloves on his hands, right in between his mother and Harry – to whom he gave a tight smile. Sherlock was watching him, and the weight of those eyes, grey as the sky above, on his own tethered him to the ground beneath him.
Whispers of anticipation shivered through the assembled boys.
John was wearing his regular first team uniform that he wore to practices, but the shirt was slightly different.
Sherlock had the good grace to exhale a dry laugh. “No, admittedly. When I saw Nadia coming toward us, I could see she had a problem of quite some weight she was on her way to get guidance with – even you probably saw that.” John was about to protest the use of ‘
John ignored him and continued reading Robert Frost.
“It was purely self-serving,” John said. “If the attention’s on someone else, he gets all sulky.”
“Now.” Sherlock confirmed.
Kitty looked between him and Sarah. “Who’s what?”
Nobody. Nobody else would have given him tea.
He walked very quietly down the length of the bathroom, steps virtually silent. The room was completely empty, save for him and the other mystery occupants. He held his breath as he got to the last few cubicles. Now he was closer he could tell it was two people – young, male, whispering things like “Hurry up,” and swearing under their breath. He doubted they knew they were not alone.
“Are you okay?”
“What are you drawing?”
Molly gave him a quick smile, nodded, pushed open the door and was gone.
Sherlock got dressed into his pyjamas and half-heartedly did the bare minimum of his anthropology homework before asking again.
Except he didn’t hear the second syllable of his name, already airborne.
“You know I will always believe you,” John found himself replying, so quiet it was almost a whisper in the falling night. “Right?”
“I’ll never be able to again, your singing made sure of that,” Sherlock dead-panned.
John nodded.
Sherlock felt a smile tug at his lips. “I’m not sure I would say trust…” he joked, and John rolled his eyes.
“You’re so brave,” one of the other PDS kids whispered shyly, a girl in year nine from a school three streets away, with angry, blackened skin blistered across her right cheek.
Sherlock put his cup down.
“Thank you, Sherlock.”
“Not quite. Not unbearable, but not optimal.”
John stopped in his tracks. Didn’t know whether that was addressed to him or Sherlock. Didn’t matter. Dropped Sherlock’s hand. Expected him to tell him not to – which he would have ignored – but heard only silence. Turned around, marched back to Angelo. And punched him square in the nose.
“Nah, I’ve sworn off relationships for life.”
John shook his head. Sally was wrong.
“Excuse me?” John replied.
“Wait, you knew about this?” he asked Sherlock.
John felt heat rise to his cheeks at the memory of the dream and risked another glance over at the sleeping Sherlock, suddenly worried he somehow knew. Sherlock was perfectly still; John could see his chest rise and fall in the grey light seeping into the room. John wrenched his mind away from the dream, but in doing so recalled once more the feeling of Sherlock’s tongue on the soft flesh between his fingers and felt a sharp twist in his stomach. He sat up. His breathing, his heartbeat - now they more resembled their nightmare patterns.
John began the story and felt himself smiling at the memory of a time more simple. Before long, John heard a quiet snuffle from Sherlock’s bed. He trailed off, not bothering to finish his sentence, and listened to Sherlock’s breathing. How strange that in a matter of days, they’d be back to sleeping in silent rooms with only their own breaths for company. How strange that John felt sleeping alone to be the exception to the norm, now. That he missed Sherlock’s quiet company when they slept apart.
“Obviously not,” John said seriously. “But just take it, I don’t want to go back still holding two beers.”
“Don’t bother.”
“I’m sure Doctor Smith would appreciate it,” Jamie said sarcastically. “That guy’s a real bastard.”
“Don’t pretend you’re oh-so-aloof that you’ve forgotten.”
“Well, yes, I mean – “
“I wasn’t on my phone, miss,” he insisted again, holding up his empty hands for emphasis.
“Christ, Sherlock,” he said, smile breaking into a grin now, “don’t look so scared. You’re forgiven. And I’m sorry about all the things I said. There. We’re all good. Yeah?”
“Concussion.”
“It very much bloody is,” John said, grabbing him by the shoulders. “Do you have a younger sibling you’ve never told me about?” Sherlock stared daggers at John. “We’re skipping bio,” John decided. “Come on.”
“It can’t have been Angelo,” Sherlock said, and John tried not to resent his lack of empathy. “There’s no way he could have had access to a needle, or the sort of substances you’d need to inject to kill.”
“Three’s a crowd in social situations, not when you’re breaking into a kidnapper’s house!” John exclaimed, wrapping himself in a towel and opening the shower door.
“The joys of cunnilingus, Sherlock, yes!” John said. “And it gets dirtier, listen.”
“Quiet, everyone,” Eddie ordered, but to no effect. The boys continued chattering and shouting and laughing. “Guys? Can we have some quiet?”
“You don’t seem very afraid,” the man cocked his head towards him.
“Goodbye, Richard. Have a good day,” Sherlock called over his shoulder to the boy. “What the hell were you thinking?” he hissed at John, guiding him firmly by the arm behind a building. “You remember what we said about not being able to tell a soul?”
The reflex to burrow in the very thing that made him feel like fleeing.
[in which Sherlock buys a pair of gloves]
“Yes, it is.”
John stopped skating. Sherlock was no longer next to him. He spun around.
John opened the door. Mike was lounging on his bed, looking at his phone.
“Goodbye, John.”
After a minute, John found himself giggling and triumphant, having somehow made his way onto the top step of the ladder up to his bed, holding three smaller parcels in his hands. Sherlock stood on the lowest step, reaching up, but soon realised he had lost and stepped down, defeated.
Harry checked her phone for the umpteenth time. No further word from Sherlock.
“So, obviously you were in the same house. It must have been hard when he died, right?”
John turned away from watching Lestrade fan himself with a clipboard and looked to see who was competing for Doyle.
John snorted. “I’m as good as.”
Sherlock was still. So was John. The world had frozen, held in place by tendrils of the mist that was descending outside the window. The only movement was pencil over paper, the only sound the whispers made when they came into contact. The night deepened. Ever so,
“Not everything has to be about cases and mystery and impossible problems, just let yourself relax for two fucking minutes for once,” John replied, trying to keep his voice down.
“True that,” agreed Harry. “And you’ve got to take stupid amounts of selfies and spend hours talking about boys and do each other’s hair and paint each other’s toes,”
“I…” he said. He didn’t know what to say. He had begun to say
“No fuckin’ way, you’ve given it to me now,” Claus retorted, slapping away Glen’s hands, which were seeking Claus’s pocket.
“How he died.”
“Good morning, John.”
John pushed open the door to reveal a small, comfortable-looking room, crammed with sofas of all sizes, colours and materials, a table football set, a pool table, a television at the end of the room, and a tired-looking piano. As he had hoped, there were two boys lounging on one of the sofas, who looked up when he entered. John pushed the door open a little more and began.
“No, wait, don’t put your top on,” John said, and Sherlock didn’t want to analyse the way his stomach flipped. “Come into the bathroom and I’ll clean you up. Come on."
“What kind of a song – ?”
Sherlock didn’t reply, and John opened the door for him into their room.
He opened the case and lifted out the instrument. It had felt very foreign when he first played it, after having snapped the neck of the one that had once belonged to his father. But now if felt as natural as if it were an extra limb, an extension of himself, and much more articulate than he could ever be.
John’s mind skipped back over that sentence, faltering slightly – did Sherlock just say he had nice arms? John was suddenly hyper-aware of every brush of Sherlock’s skin on his own. It was so rare for his friend to compliment him, it was a shock each time. It was a reminder that Sherlock noticed him – noticed different parts of him for different reasons; sometimes it felt like he didn’t even realise he was there at all, so those little acknowledgements didn’t come often enough. A small thought half-formed underneath all of that, however, a small thought about
“Why, Sherlock?” When the other boy said nothing, John’s heart sank. “Oh, no. You’ve got a plan, haven’t you? God help me.”
“Well, fine isn’t good enough,” John said, taking it off and sitting down again. The second parcel contained a dark blue garment.
just said something. Like Sherlock had put together the final pieces of a case. Like Sherlock
Eddie considered it a moment. House competitions were about collaboration, team work, volunteering one’s natural strengths for the fun of it, and building good relationships between houses. And winning. Eric was in.
There was a pause.
“I know where the Guinea pig is,” Anderson said, and began leading them through a corridor.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. His silence was worryingly at odds with his fountain of deductions on the football pitch. A silent Sherlock was never a good sign, but especially so that night.
“Uh,” John looked at his watch. “Ten past twelve, why?”
Sherlock looked at him. John’s face was stretched from the effort of not laughing. “Punk… kin,” Sherlock repeated slowly.
Sherlock cocked his head. “Plausible, although it would be better if – ”
John laughed.
He took his violin from the table and went downstairs, turning left into the old cottage that was attached to the main house.
Sherlock spun around suddenly and was in John’s personal space in two strides.

“Right here,” John assured him, and Sherlock began to sit up. “Brought you sustenance. Tomato soup, some bread too.”
“So she’s lost it, case closed, right? Why are you interested?” John asked.
?” Glen shouted from the front of the group. “You’re one lucky bastard, you know that, Watson?”
“I’m fine, John,” he said, trying to back-track through his stream of thought – or not-so-thought, more like monologue –  to find anything offensive. Perhaps… perhaps all of it had been… insensitive. He wasn’t even high yet, pills take longer than injections – oh, no, there was the pulse rate, climbing, climbing – he shouldn’t be around John when the high came proper, he’d surely notice, and for some reason Sherlock didn’t want that. No, he didn’t want that at all. “I’ll just leave you to your… whatever. Not that either of you were particularly enjoying – goodbye.” He cut himself off, John’s face was darkening. Darkening in the dark. Funny.
“Because someone’s got to fill my shoes when I go off to LSE, and I see real potential in you.”
She curled up into a ball and screwed her eyes tighter shut.
“Got it. Okay, see – yup. See y– yes, I know, mum, see you later. Bye.” He hung up and exhaled. “I have to get going, Sherlock.”
“Bye, John,” he said.
“Hey, what stroke’s that? You look like a frog.”
John hadn’t been in Dickens since the incident with Mr Bradstreet’s pets. It was a different experience to walk through its corridors in Angelo’s wake - younger boys hastened to move out of their way lest Angelo flatten them against a wall somewhere. Angelo’s room was messy and stank of feet.
A deep voice came from somewhere off to Harry’s left. “Biology. Do you think I have the time to be extracting eyes willy-nilly?”
The screen showed a stock photo of a child with his face painted green with sunken eyes and stitching. He considered the picture. “I’m not letting you paint my face green.”
John had no idea what a gala was, but he assumed it meant race, so he shook his head.
ever – receive and I don’t deserve anyone fucking composing – oh my god, I know I’m rambling but, like,
John smiled.
never seem to end well.” Sherlock had seen the results of what the boys of his year had termed ‘serious’ relationships crash headfirst to the ground due to the very nature of the environment they lived in; rumours spreading faster than cholera and hormones running high, undiluted in constant company and a dearth of privacy.
“Perhaps.”
“Hey, that’s not fair!” Henry shouted. “We’re your guests!”
“Breast stroke,” Sherlock said. “I’ll teach you that one next, if you like.”
okay.” John heard him take a breath. "
“I’m not going to ask you to show them to me unless you want to, they’re private. But what kinds of things have you been drawing?”
“See you, Sherlock,” he said, finding the handle of his suitcase again and looking back one last time before shouting back to his mum that he was coming.
– before grasping his hand.
“Oh really? I bet my hot chocolate is three hundred times better than some little café’s,” John jested.
“Oh god, too much information, John,” Sherlock recoiled, scrunching up his nose. John laughed – thank goodness – and stretched, yawning.
It was said so casually, but it put a concept in Sherlock’s head that had never dared appear there before.
Sherlock smirked. “No. That was why it worked so well.”
Angelo seemed to be experiencing several emotions at once. After battling them all for a moment, rage seemed to win, and he whirled around and stormed out.
“You think something’s going to happen at the competition?”
There was a dull weight somewhere deep in his chest.
“She is, I think,” Harry agreed. “I think it’s David. He helps.”
John rolled his eyes and continued with his sketch. He was starting to find Sherlock more amusing than scary, and smiled to himself.
Muhammad shook his head. “They only came down a couple of steps.”
John returned that gaze. Something about that girl made him feel like a cat with its hackles raised.
“I’ll stop if you
“Well, then, Mrs and Ms Watson,” Sherlock began, over-emphasising his accent for comic effect. “Would you like the grand tour of our humble abode?”
“Who is it?”
John frowned. “Yeah…”
He knew John suspected he had done what he had. He knew John wanted to confront him about it. He knew that that conversation would not end well – not through lack of goodwill. They were both exhausted, completely and utterly, frayed to breaking point, and Sherlock knew that he was stubborn at the best of times. He had hypothesised at least thirty four ways it could end, and none of them were desirable. It was the rugby practise and Stamford’s obsession with physical fitness that had saved him from the threat of a confrontation for a short couple of hours, but it was only for a short couple of hours.
