Cas tossed the butt of his cigarette onto the pavement and turned his head to look at Dean. Dean almost had to look away because Cas was giving him that
“You would think, the third time someone you love is ripped away from you, the pain wouldn’t be so sharp, ya know? But this…” Dean shook his head, his fists clenching. “This feels worse than the first two times. This feels like I’ve been ripped right down the middle. Like someone took a chain saw and just –.” Dean made a buzzing sound with his mouth, and used his hands to act out the motion of cutting something in half. He laughed after that, a cold, empty laugh that actually scared Cas a bit. He winced.
Dean’s mother had died when he was four years old. She worked at a diner that caught fire. Sam was only a baby, and his father tried to be strong for them, but losing Mary probably hurt his father the most. When Dean was in middle school, they moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota to be closer to their Uncle Bobby. That’s when things started getting bad.
Cas turned to face Dean once more, and although Dean expected Cas to be angry, he just looked…sad. He looked at his hands and started fidgeting with the sling on his arm again. Dean simply waited, unsure of what else to say.
“I know you are,” Cas soothed, taking one of Dean’s hands in his own. “But I think it would be good to get some extra help, that’s all. You’re already my soul mate, Dean, and nothing is going to change that. But you don’t have to be my therapist, too.”
Castiel came highly recommended, so when his resume reached Dean’s desk, he already knew he’d make first cut, but then he saw his raven black hair, his stunning blue eyes, and his pink, kissable lips in the picture attached, he threw out all the other applications. Working with the younger man has been a bit of a challenge, though, because he is absolutely oblivious to how attractive he is. He dresses plainly, speaks softly, as if he’s trying to remain unseen, but Dean sees him. He can tell the boy has a crush on him, catches him staring every so often, hears rumors around the office, but resigns himself to the fact that he’s probably not Cas’s type. Castiel isn’t usually Dean’s type, either, but there’s just
Cas’s feminine voice startles Dean; he’s still not used to the sound. He tries not to act surprised when he sees her, though. “Kevin,” Dean laughs awkwardly, feeling like he’d just been caught reaching for the proverbial cookie jar. “It’s nothing. Time for lunch?”
“I told you, man, the chick at the counter said his name, and the guy called him his boyf- no, he’s not with him right n- would you listen for a second? Just shut up!”
Castiel threw the linens down with a huff. “I’m sorry Sam’s dead, okay?” He hissed, barely restraining his annoyance. Dean had every right to be upset, but Cas was not about to be the on the receiving end of Dean’s meanness. “I miss him, too, you know. You’re not the only one dealing with this. He was my frien-.”
Cas rolled his eyes while he walked toward his closet. “Dean, I doubt that the fact that I’m wearing your clothes bothers you at all.”
He didn’t even notice them on his way to the bathroom a few minutes before. On his way back to his bedroom, however, a red one floated by and caught his attention. Curious, he made his way out of the narrow hallway and into the open space that served both as a dining area and living room, only to find it filled to the brim with balloons. There are at least four in every color of the damn rainbow, and Dean’s first thought is that it’s a prank.
“Yes, there’s evidence that a shifter definitely shed here recently. They must be in the crowd downstairs.”
Later that night, they’re lying naked on the floor of Dean’s office, both worn out, sore, and satiated. Cas has his head on Dean’s chest, and Dean’s arm is around Castiel’s back, rubbing the skin there. Their clothes are strewn all over the chairs and the floor, Dean’s desk is a total mess, but he can’t find it in himself to care right now. He found his missing piece, his angel of Thursday.
As usual, Mayor Winchester walks straight past Castiel and into his office to continue his phone call. He leaves one door open, which usually means he’s expecting some sort of early meeting. Cas sighs, and gets back to work writing out the schedule. He looks back at Monday and sees a 9AM spot open for an office meeting. He makes a mental note of that and keeps working, answering phone calls and making memos and sending important emails.
“Where the hell could he be?” Cas continued, voice hushed. “I was in a fucking coma for crying out loud! You think the man would come out of hiding to make sure his own son is still alive. I just don’t understand – yeah, yeah I gotta go, too. Please be careful, Anna. And call Balthy. I don’t care, you can’t be home alone for that long without… okay, and what if something did go wrong? My decision is final, Anna. Call your cousin. Wow, thanks, love you, too.”
“Shit!” Cas yelled, and he must have jumped a foot in the air, “Dean, what the –- how long have you been in here!?”
When he reached the bus station, Cas sat in the seats outside. It was April, and the air was cool at night. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a row of payphones.
That evening, when he gets home, Dean wraps the presents and places them under the 7 foot tree in the living room. He ended up buying Cas a watch, as well, to replace the old one he’s been wearing for years. He checks the stockings above their fake fireplace for good measure, relieved to find them empty. By the time Cas gets home, Dean is already in bed, but he feels Cas place a short kiss to the back of his neck when he slips under their shared covers. Dean falls asleep easily after that.
"And," Cas continues, "I knew I’d terminate the pregnancy if you weren’t on board. I’d do that for you."
Kevin and Sam are back at the bunker, working on the tablets, and – in an effort to get out of doing actual work – Dean finds a case and takes it. Sam bitches and Kevin moans but Dean waves them off; they’re safe, and that’s what matters.
They get back to the motel, and Dean tries not to make his disappointment too obvious when Cas isn’t there waiting for them. He’s not there the next day when they drive back to the bunker. When they arrive home, Dean checks Cas’s room, and sighs when he’s not there either.
Cas kissed him then, and it reminded Dean of the first time he’d done it – softly, slowly. The whole time, Dean repeated
Dean’s entire body relaxes with relief at those words, and he moves his hands to cradles Cas’s face. Cas is smiling, and Dean shakes his head.
Dean was silent for a beat as Castiel’s words hit him, hard. They weren’t delivered maliciously, but Dean could tell by the words he chose that Cas was definitely pissed off.
“Kids?!” he exclaimed, and Dean heard a click, alerting him that the call had ended. He looked down at his phone, a bit confused, but then he heard uneven footsteps coming towards him.
Dean turned the faucet to hot and let the water hit his smooth skin. He thought about his schedule, wondered where could get pie – his favorite food, and then his mind wandered to the subject of
Meg laughs next to him, punching him the arm. “Oh, come one, that was fun! Can’t wait to hear how things go for you at work on Monday.”
Sam chuckles and closes the book he’s been reading, tucking it under his arm as he stands and pats Kevin on the shoulder. “We’ve all been there, buddy.” After he leaves the den, Dean stands and puts his phone in his pocket, then plops down next to Kevin on the couch.
“Cas woke up,” Dean said in a breath, smiling despite how fragile the world felt under his Converse shoes. “He’s alive…Sammy, he’s okay.”
Two hours later finds them half naked, half asleep, and wrapped in Dean’s blankets, and before drifting off, Dean smiles and declares, “Best. Birthday. Ever.”
He didn’t have class for another half hour, but Castiel could not stand being in the same room as a shirtless Dean Winchester and his stupidly
Dean Winchester is sitting at his desk, and Cas notices immediately that the Sunday paper is open in front of him. His blood goes cold.
When he heard this, Dean dropped the smirk he’d been wearing on that mouth of his, shifting his position to sit up straighter. “She’s
Castiel sets the coffee maker and makes the coffee black. He truly can’t think of anything else the mayor might want. Is his boss really
It had been nine years since he last saw his older brother. Excluding the attack, the last time they saw each other, Lucifer was being kicked out of their house.
"Yes, that's exactly what I'm telling you. And I'd like your blessing, if you think he and I are a good fit."
“Oh, okay, sure.” Cas managed to finish eating in under five minutes, and called Anna to give them their check. Anna sauntered over, trying way too hard to be sexy, but Dean thought it was cute. When she got to the table, she flipped her hair and smiled.
When Bobby calls a few days after they've wrapped up a hunt, Dean doesn't expect it to be about anything important.
That much was true. Although Dean thought it was much simpler just sticking with your soul mate, he didn’t agree that people who chose not to do so should be treated any differently. That was just stupid. Unfortunately, their father had a different opinion.
As if to confirm Dean’s assumption, the man then ended his conversation with a laugh and said, “Have fun telling Lucifer about this one. Told you we should have beat up that Castiel kid some more.”
Castiel breathed a sigh of relief when they arrived at Dr. Bradbury’s downtown office in one piece, with a couple minutes to spare.
“Patient had cardiomyopathy,” Dean explains, “I’ve been on his case for weeks, and his wife finally convinced him to do have surgery to repair his heart. We get a fresh echo, prep him for a septal myectomy, get him to the main OR, put him to sleep, vitals are stable when we start, everything’s fine. We go through the chest, break the sternum, get to the heart, put him on bypass, everything’s still fine.”
Anna scribbled something down, and then turned to Castiel. “And you’ll have spaghetti and meat balls, with water, because you are the epitome of boring.” She slammed the notepad shut and placed it in her apron as she walked away. Castiel wasn’t surprised that she knew what he’d order. He was a simple man. Plus, they
“It’s nice to finally meet you, Sam,” Cas said, “Although, I do wish it was under different circumstances.”
Cas sighs as the car pulls into the motel lot. “You’re so willing to die for everyone else, but no one is allowed to die for you.”
“The panic attack,” Dean remembered suddenly. That was the first time he realized something was definitely wrong with his boyfriend. “In the car, after I drove you home from the hospital.”
Dean can feel himself smiling as he puts the car in park. He really is gone on Cas, and he couldn’t be happier. “Love you, too.”
“Cas?!” he exclaims, stepping into the room. He slides a hand through his hair, the way he always does when he’s too baffled to speak. “You’re…you’re a –.”
“No, silly,” Cas replied, laughing. “I just want your opinion on something. Sam suggested something to me and I’m considering it.”
“You know what I’m good at?” Al mused, completely ignoring Dean’s questions, “Torturing people. That’s my special talent. I know, I know, I’m young, why would I want to do something like that? Well, college is expensive, the pay is great, and The Garrison pays really well.”
and Cas’s body reacts before he can stop himself. He sighs into the kiss, and his hands find Dean’s waist, sliding around to his back and pressing their bodies even closer. It’s all too much and somehow still not enough, but soon he’s running out of air and breaks away to catch his breath.
Castiel thought. He hadn’t meant to bring that up just yet. Dean’s eyebrow were raised as he waited for an answer, but just then, the door to room 3A swung open.
Cas yawns again, and eventually drifts off to sleep. Dean can hear her deep breaths over the sound of the Impala’s engine, and he has no clue as to why, but it soothes him. He relaxes slightly in his seat, and feels Cas’s toes tickle the side of his thigh. He glances down, and spies the beginnings of a blister on the back of her left ankle. He makes a mental note to get Cas more comfortable shoes – and more clothes – once they get back to the bunker. He would stop and buy a pair now, but he knows they need to get back as soon as possible. There are rogue angels out there looking for Cas. Luckily for her, she has an excellent disguise, but that doesn’t mean she’s safe.
Dean couldn't pretend he didn't want this, but where did Cas learn to kiss like that? How did he get so
“Sammy,” Dean began, “you don’t have to make excuses for me, okay? Just because I’m hurting doesn’t mean you have to –.”
“It’s a trait we all share, yes.” Dean heard an elevator ding again and stepped out of the car, making his way over to the passenger side door.
“Yes, I know, but Dean,” Cas reaches out and places a hand over Dean’s own, which rests on the table, “Dean, if you were killed because of me, I… I don’t know what I’d do.”
Castiel’s lips curled into a smile, “Well, I’d rather not talk about this in a public bathroom. Can we…go home?”
"Going through something?" Dean stops to look at Anna. "Is something wrong with Cas? Did something happen at work?" The Novak family owns a hospital downtown - Novak General Hospital - and most of them work there, too. Cas was a nurse, but made the salary of a starting physician. Sometimes things got hectic, but Cas always told Dean about it when he got home…not that he’d been very chatty, lately.
A few weeks later, Cas was in yet another town, and had enough money to rent a small apartment a couple minutes outside of the city, where he worked at a local pet store. The area was usually quiet, but the neighbor to his left was the exact opposite. It took Cas a week to get up the nerve to complain, but when he did, he found that his neighbor was only a college dropout with too much time on her hands. Her hair was dyed purple, she had a metal bar in her earlobe (
Of course, getting jumped behind a gas station by a couple of angry angels may have helped in persuading him to get his ass back to the bunker.
The class laughed. Professor Crowley raised his eyebrows and shook his head, but didn’t comment. He started writing things on the board. “To keep things simple, the person sitting next to you is your lab partner. Get to know them well; you’ll be responsible for half of each other’s grades. Go on – mingle.”
They stand in the living room for a long moment, their eyes locked on each other’s. The only sound comes from the fake fireplace as the Christmas lights and decorations fade from Dean’s vision, and soon, all Dean can see is Cas. His beautiful, loyal Castiel, worried about something he has no reason at all to worry about.
Dean blinks, twice. He hears the words this time, loud and clear. But his mind is still trying to decode them.
“You two are early,” Sheriff Mills greeted as Castiel and Dean walked into the office building. Police officers rushed around them, carrying coffee, bagels, and classified documents.
Dean throws his hands up in feigned exasperation. He knows they’re right, but he’s not about to admit it. “What am I, a stay-at-home mom? I’m going with you, Sam.”
"Why didn’t you say anything sooner?" Dean asks quietly, offering his hands to Cas, who takes them without hesitation.
Balthazar gave Castiel a brief hug before sitting in the chair beside his bed. “How am I? I should be asking
When Dean made it to the parking lot of his dormitory, he pulled his phone out of where he had stuffed it in his jacket pocket and dialed Cas’s number. It rang only once before Cas picked up.
It only takes a few seconds before the hooting and hollering starts. Cas keeps his eyes closed but he can hear people snapping photos with their cameras and whisperings of,
Dean sat still and stunned, with no clue how to proceed. Cas had freaked out, like totally went psycho on him. From what Dean could see, he had repressed a really bad memory, and now it was crawling to the surface, putting a crack in his chassis. Dean wondered what this Uncle Zach character could have done to Cas, but he didn’t want to think about it. It hurt too much.
Dean doesn’t remember ever feeling more at home in his life. It’s in that moment that Dean knows everything will be alright.
Dean’s face flashed something like embarrassment, but Castiel didn’t catch it. “Uh, nothing. Man, this pie looks good. How’s your spaghetti?”
“What do you mean you haven’t seen him in a month?” Dean heard Cas whisper, and he didn’t sound happy. Although he knew it was wrong, Dean couldn’t help but eavesdrop. He closed his eyes and listened in.
Castiel doubted Dean’s sudden happiness. He moved his hands to Dean’s shoulders and shoved away lightly, until he was looking Dean in the face. “Then why did you look so…so somber, on the phone?”
"Oh my – no, Cas, just –," Sam pauses to take a breath. He smiles, then shuts his laptop and motions toward the couch. "Here, sit down."
"Dean! Sam found this shirt and told me I could have it! Ya know, since it doesn’t fit you anymore."
Meg winks at him. “Listen, Clarence, as the daughter of the police captain, my father taught me to notice things. I hang around the station, I go to all the fancy events with my dad to make him look like a ‘family man’, and in order to keep myself from dying of boredom, I people watch.”
“Well, uh…” Dean squinted to read the name tag on the pharmacist’s top, “Tessa, I’m basically the worst caretaker in the world and forgot to get my boyfriend’s prescriptions filled.” He pulled the doctor’s list out of his jacket pocket and ripped off the prescription slips, sliding them across the counter. “So, if you could fill these out for me, I’d be forever grateful.”
“If you want to,” Cas lifted his body away from the table and placed his hands on his neck, “don’t get too much stuff, though. Since you’re uh, leaving soon.”
Cas nods, “The depth of my feelings for you is… exponential to what I’ve ever felt for another person, angel or human. I could drown in it. Part of me wants to. I just didn’t know how to tell you.”
you, kiddo, you’re Ben! Who wouldn’t want a badass like you by their side?” Dean winks, and feels relief when Ben smiles at him.
“Well, are you gonna tell me who broke my hand and three of my ribs? Who made half of my face a gigantic bruise?”
She looks nervous again, but not uncomfortable or out of place. “Have a good night,” she says softly, and her hair catches the light of the lamp as she nods toward Dean. “And thank you, again.”
would do this to me! How can he hate me for something I had no say in, whatsoever?” Cas was staring at Charlie, as if she actually had an answer for him. She responded, though, very gently.
Castiel takes a moment to respond. Dean assumes he’s trying to cope with the physical counterpart that usually accompanies extreme emotion, or something. Sam would know.
his eyes shined with hope and relief, and he was smiling down at him, and Castiel had never seen something so beautiful.
Walking towards their table, hair dyed bright red and wearing a skirt so short he thought it must be child-sized, was his little sister.
"Well, I know how much Dean values tradition, and since your parents are deceased, I thought asking you for his hand would be most appropriate," Cas explains. He'd asked his siblings about this, and they'd agreed. They would never steer him wrong. Right?
“Yeah,” Dean replied, breathier then he anticipated. When Cas’s attention suddenly shifted to Dean, he coughed a few times, looking from his watch to the window and anywhere but Castiel.
Cas seems slightly uncomfortable with the idea, but doesn’t flee like Dean thinks he will. “If you insist.”
“Yeah, there was an incident, and Cas, he…” Dean trailed off, looking down at where his hands were folded on the counter. Guilt rose in his gut and threatened to pull him under.
Dean made a placating gesture with his hands, “I was gonna tell you, Cas, I swear! But we got caught up with your therapy and then this whole thing, and it just…it wasn’t the right time.”
“It was Lucifer,” Anna’s voice cut in, soft and frail, yet firm. She’d been crying, Castiel could tell. She slowly walked into the room before closing the door behind her. When she looked up at Castiel, her eyes were red. The red in her hair, though, was fading.
“Hey, angel, I missed you this morning,” Dean said, attempting to recreate the sleepy voice that drove Cas nuts.
love, he loved fiercely, with an almost unruly passion. He thought of himself as an all-or-nothing kind of guy – he either couldn’t care less, or he cared way too much, and it terrified him. Love was weakness. Love made way for loss. His father had loved his mother and lost her. Dean loved Sam more than anyone and almost lost him. The way things were going, if he told Cas he loved him, it would only be a matter of time before Cas was gone, too. Hell, Cas was already standing bruised and broken right in front of him. He couldn’t say it
After half an hour of making out, and a few minutes of apologizing every so often when Dean got a little too rough, Castiel finally agreed to let Dean tell him about the conversation he had with Alistair on another day.
Meg throws her hands up with her fingers crossed, “Honest to God! One time, I think you were supposed to accompany him to a meeting or something, take notes for him or whatever you do –.”
“Oh goodness, I’m sorry, you guys are just adorable. I’m so sorry; I’ll be more professional, wow, shame on me.” She cleared her throat and Dean had to laugh.
Dean smiled against his lips, and Castiel realized that he might already be a little bit in love with his soul mate.
Dean remembers saying that. He also remembers only half-meaning it, but of course, Cas was never one to pick up on sarcasm.
It’s then that there’s a knock on the door. Sam and Dean share a look; they both know who it is, and Sam winks at Dean.
"You think he’ll be ready to go soon?" Sam asks quietly. They’re in the kitchen, and Dean is watching Ben play a video game in the living room. Bobby says he found the game system lying around in his basement, but Dean would bet 50 bucks that the old sap went out and bought it brand new for Ben.
the words looped though his mind; he recognized that voice. He’d memorized it from Cas’s voice mail message.
“I thought it was an appropriate response to what I was feeling at the moment,” Cas mutters, “what I feel for you.”
Cas hums a reply before Dean hears retching again. Every fiber in him wants to run into the bathroom, but Cas insisted that he was fine, so Dean resigns to bed once more. A glance at his watch tells him that it’s already past noon.
“He won’t skip his graduation,” Dean kept his voice low in the empty kitchen. “Prom was one thing. I wish Sammy had skipped his Junior Pr-.” Dean bit his lip. He had been trying not to think about Sam so much, which was not an easy task. That was why he slept all day long. The nightmares didn’t plague him if the sun was still up. If he fell asleep by 5:30, he wouldn’t wake up for twelve whole hours. His mind and body were exhausted from the sadness that Dean dragged around like suitcase missing its wheels.
, he realizes. Or maybe more than a little. He bounces his leg nervously and tries not to think about that.
It’s Dean who breaks the silence, striding forward to capture the other man in a tight hug just as a sob escapes Cas.
Suddenly devoid of all hunger, Dean crawled back into bed, setting an alarm on his phone so that he and Cas wouldn’t sleep though class. He slipped under the covers and Cas adjusted his position, grunting a little in the process. Dean smiled, wrapping his arm around Castiel’s waist and rubbing his back to settle him.
Al laughed, and the sound made Dean cringe. “Lucifer had a…vendetta of sorts. Apparently his family disowned him? Anyway, he blamed Castiel, told us all if he ever got his hands on him, he’d kill him. And guess who found poor little Castiel, right here, of all places?”
“C’mere, you idjits,” he said before pulling both boys into a crushing hug. Dean was immediately reminded of the day after his father died, and how Bobby had hugged both Sam and Dean in the same fashion. He tried not to dwell on that, though; he wouldn’t be able to hold it together.
“You can’t just let someone assume you want them to stay, and then plan to leave,” Cas said quietly, unsure of the emotions he was currently experiencing.
asks for coffee. It’s been said that he likes to brew it at home himself, drink it during his commute. Rumor has it that his fitness coach brother has him on some sort of smoothie diet, which is why his physique is so godly.
Cas returned from the hallway bathroom to find Dean sitting on his bed in their shared room, holding one of his many plaid shirts. He wanted to ask if Dean was okay, but the look on his face made it clear that he was not. So instead, Cas walked over to his side of the room and rummaged through his poorly thrown together suitcase, looking for a towel. After finding one, he dried his hands and face and hung the towel on the corner bed post.
The interrogation rooms were located on the bottom floor of the building. When they arrived, Sheriff Mills introduced them to a detective who was already there. “This is Detective Turner. He’s been chasing down The Garrison for years –.”
Sam,” Dean grunts, making his way to the back door and following Cas outside. The grass outside is wet and Dean wishes he were wearing his boots and jeans, not this rented tux. He searches everywhere but can’t find the damn angel.
Dean laughed and shifted his body to lean on his elbow. He let go of Cas's hand to rest his arm around Cas's shirtless middle. "Yeah, Cas, that's normal. Comes with the whole human thing. We crave affection or whatever."
“He gets that way with people he cares about, especially when they’re hurt.” Sam gestured toward Castiel’s broken hand. “But he means well. He did the same thing to me after the truck accident.”
Castiel released a shaky breath and practically flew forward to wrap Dean in a hug, which Dean readily returned. He wasn’t even aware that he had doubted Dean’s willingness to stay with him through all of this, but now that Dean had made it clear that he wouldn’t be leaving, Castiel felt tremendous relief. They stood wrapped together for a few minutes, Castiel’s arms around Dean’s shoulders, and Dean’s wrapped around Castiel’s waist, one hand rubbing his back.
and Dean can’t bring himself to be mean. Which is odd, because Dean can be mean to just about anyone.
"I missed you," he says before he can stop himself, "Fuck, I missed you, Cas," he repeats, and Cas kisses him again before wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders.
"'Course!" Sam pats him on the back. "I mean, I think you're insane wanting to marry Dean while you're both residents and drowning in medical school debt, but hey! Guess love makes you a little crazy."
"What did those dicks do to you, man?" Dean asked, trying not to think about the fact that Cas was shirtless and sitting on his car, or how hot that was.
“So it’s not just me! Finally, someone agrees with me about a member of the opposite sex!” He grins then, pointing at Dean, “Wanna call dibs?”
Dean sighed, and squeezed his hand. Castiel squeezed back, suddenly a bit nervous. He still had no clue how he ended up in the hospital. The last thing he remembered was walking home from the library Sunday night, and then…
"Go away!" he yelled, the first words he said aloud since he got back to his apartment that Monday. The words cracked uncomfortably in his throat and he sat up, intent on getting some water, when the person at the door yelled back.
Dean opens the front door quietly, not surprised to find the living room in a bit of disarray, baby toys strewn all over the place. Dean kicks off his loafers and hangs his work bag on one of the hooks by the door, then tosses his keys and wallet into the ceramic bowl sitting on the table in the entrance way. Cas specifically placed it there so Dean would stop losing his valuables. He isn’t sure what he did to deserve a man like Cas.
“Cas, it’s fine,” Dean assured him. A short laugh escaped them both, and Dean found himself stepping forward to wrap his arms around Cas’s neck and kissing him gently on the lips.
“I need some air,” Dean grunted, still heaving from his outburst, and Cas was pulled out of his thoughts.
“You leave that boy alone,” Castiel warned, and felt Dean’s hand tense up in his own, so he clarified. “He’s clearly too good for you,” Castiel said, somewhat sarcastically, “and he’s already interested in a nice girl.”
Shaking his head, Dean pushed himself off of the floor and took a few steps until he was in front of the sink. He turned on the faucet and splashed cold water in his face a few times before looking up at his reflection in the mirror. He looked pale. He hadn’t eaten in seven hours. He hadn’t slept through the night in a week. Dean had nightmares about Sam, about how he died, about being in his body, or in the car with him. Dean saw Sam every time he tried to sleep, and always woke up screaming.
“Sam didn’t have anyone,” Dean continued. “I was in college and Dad was… he was really busy with work and Sam was forced to deal. It really messed him up for a while. But you?” Dean faced Castiel again. “You have me, Cas. I’m here for you, whenever you need me.”
“You’re telling me! I’m pretty sure the only reason I’m still passing is because you’re my lab partner.”
One tear managed to fall, but Cas wiped it away with the pad of his thumb before moving his hand to behind Dean’s neck and massaging the tense muscle there.
“Why not,” he answers, and grabs a book off the top shelf that he’s been reading when Sam isn’t home to catch him. It may or may not be an old sci-fi novel. He puts his drink on one of the tables and plops down on the chair next to Cas, who smiles at him before turning back to his own book.
They’re going at each other with angel blades, but Cas keeps knocking Dean’s out of his hand. He goes to retrieve it,
She had the number 8 written on the back of her neck. Or was in an infinity symbol? He couldn't remember. He wasn't exactly sober when she showed him, too interested in getting more physical and less verbal. Well, that was over now. He had promised himself that once his tattoo appeared, he would stop sleeping around. Not that he was a whore or anything, he just enjoyed feeling wanted - male, female, didn't matter.
Castiel flinched. “Sorry, I’m sorry,” he said without turning around. “I don’t think I can talk about that.”
They walked back to Castiel’s bed, and Dean settled in first, pulling Cas down next to him gently. They didn’t bother with the covers; just lay atop the comforter already placed on the mattress. Cas lay on his back, his right arm slung around his middle. Dean wrapped an arm around Cas’s waist and entwined their fingers before placing his head in the crook of his neck. It was nice to finally have Cas safe in his arms after so long. Dean almost felt relived, but then he remembered Cas’s panic attack in the car. Physically, Cas would be fine, Dean knew that much, but there was something going on in that beautiful mind of his that Dean knew they’d have to discuss, sooner rather than later.
Dean was swinging a crowbar at the Impala’s trunk, over and over, pained sobs escaping with every swing. And with every hit, Cas flinched – he had never seen Dean so…so
"I do, Dean. I'm sure you and Sam spent a long time searching for me, I just... I did not want to be a burden for you. I did not want to put you in danger."
"What are you talking about?" Sam asks, and then groans again as he stands. He picks a t-shirt off of the bed and slides it on over his head. "Did something happen?"
“Don’t… know what… you’re talking about,” the man said between gasps, pushing against Dean, but Dean was bigger than him. The man was tall, but scrawny.
you, Dean. You’re so far from okay, and don’t even try to tell me you’re not, because I see it. The bags under your eyes, the way you flinch every time your phone goes off – how long has it been since you’ve had a burger?”
“Oh really? I thought...” Dean says, pouting at the stick in his hand like the object has personally offended him. He is either an extremely talented actor or he genuinely doesn’t know how to hold a sword. Hesitantly, Dean finishes his sentence with a quiet, “could you show me?”
“I see Castiel so intoxicated that he is struggling to walk and, you know, would you let him out again to wander the halls like that?”
Castiel doesn’t even realise how much time has passed – it could be seconds, minutes, hours – when Prince Dean graciously steps back, clearing his dry throat and saying, “Right, uh, lets um... go then.”
A plural groan resounds throughout the crowd as the men put away their sticks and pack up their uniforms, heading away from the place of conflict, casting gloomy looks his way in the process. Of course he is going to be the one to blame, he shouldn’t have expected anything less. Slowly, he tries getting up but accidentally slips and leans his weight on the bruised arm. He should be lucky it’s not broken, although it does feel kind of funny. He will probably check up on it later just in case. Dean doesn’t so much as glance anybody’s way as he angrily stomps away towards the castle.
The herald commences in listing off another two names after which each respectful title, a scrawny, identical figure claims. A certain “Prince Balthazar” and “Prince Gabriel” bow so deep and drawn-out it almost becomes mocking and Dean ponders whether the display was purposeful. You could tell they were brothers of the closest kind, both donning golden locks and the same petite build. Uncomfortably, they are both also wearing an uniform, uncanny smirk that edges between that of playful and polite. Dean observes the squirming Sam beside him. He couldn’t lie that he wasn’t a bit shaken himself.
Finally, with the youth gone, he approaches Anael, fully aware of what may be going on here. Finally, she seems to awaken from her trance and gasps at finding her brother just a few feet away, seemingly having witnessed their departure. Resignedly, she huffs and invites him into her room, knowing that there is no escaping the questioning that is sure yet to come.
“No worries, and anyway, if you need anything, me and Dean are in the eastern wing, - you know, the big, spiral-y tower? You are welcome to drop by anytime.” Sam pauses, considerate in his behaviours before he starts shaking his head, deciding better against it. He settles for “I hope to get to know you, at least properly, soon.”
As soon as Anna opens the door, he is scolded and ushered inside like the no-so little child that he is. It’s kind of sweet how she cares so much for him, and he wouldn’t mind it if it prevented him from pursuing his plans all the damn time.
Resignedly, Castiel deflates in his chair, clearly unwilling to speak about the matter, the touchy subject surely haunting him. Reluctantly, he musters, “uh, well it was one of the maids.”
“Twas a mere moment ago. None of you jerks noticed me gone when I stayed behind in one of the side closets near the throne room, and that was where I spotted them.”
“Yes,” is his simple answer. The brothers exchange a look that says what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-this-guy, both quite confused at the fellow prince’s behaviour. A beat passes between them and when Dean thinks they aren’t going to get anything else from him, he speaks in a sad, guilty tone, “the young girl is fine, I assure you but it might take a while for her to realise the truth. Please hear the verity from our point of view, I promise it was a misunderstanding. I fully understand if I cannot grace you with my presence any longer, however I hope you would be considerate enough to not judge the rest of my family upon my actions. My apologies but I truly did not take into consideration the Lawrencian custom, I must say I should have familiarised myself with them beforehand. I take full responsibility for what happened so upon a sinful man’s dying wish could you please leave my sister from any harm. It has truly been an honour to have personally met you both and I also understand any punishment that you may wish to inflict upon me. I will take what I deserve but I am afraid I-“
is Dean’s sarcastic retort dripping with silent disgust, as a shrewd grimace grips his face. Ever the wiser, Sam must have noticed the long list of inaudible cursing racking up in Dean’s mind because a prominent spark of pain (due to the former’s boot contacting harshly with his toes) silences his mind, forcing Dean to focus more on muffling a whine to the best of his ability.
“Anyway, there’s no harm done if I show that I’m interested, right? Hopefully Dad might think it’s a suitable match and then there won’t be any need to pawn me off like a chess piece.” Castiel throws her a look. “Fine, I know what you’re going to say. That I’m too young, but Caasss,” she emphasises the name with a long whine, “I’m going to turn sixteen next month. Dad promised that he was going to start looking for suitors.” Her bottom lip protrudes, accentuating the pouting face of the moody teen before him. Cas is determined to not give in so easily.
The flat statement holds no true meaning behind it but Anael still abruptly leaves them with a wink and prowls over in her iconic hungry stance.
“Casssss,” Dean whines lifting his frail, limp head, emphasising the last syllable as if saying the whole name is an immense feat due to slurred pronunciation and tongue twisting letters indicating that he has had too much to drink. “I thought we were on a... first. name. basis,” Dean sasses, “besides, the niiiight isn’t even oooover yet.”
Surely as expected, Michael halts the processions and calls out, “Right lads, time to switch it up a bit, don’t ya think? Swap partners!”
“Nobody...” Anael starts, but after seeing the harsh, questioning look he gives her, she resigns to just telling the truth. “Okay, fine, he’s one of the stable boys, but you cannot tell anybody. Promise me, Cas.” She wears a hopeless look of despair and her eyes shine in the candlelight. Cas knows that at weak times like these, when she feels the most vulnerable, his sister often spills too much information, so he keeps quiet. He may just feel a slight pang of empathy and guilt for using her like this to get information, if he wasn’t so curious about the situation himself.
“What do you need me to do?” Dean asked, attempting to ignore the fact that they were both in the shower while only one of them was fully nude.
The woman laughed, and Castiel and Dean gave each other equally confused looks. The women then held out her hand.
With that, Alistair walked off, stooping once to pick up the phone he’d dropped earlier before turning the corner and disappearing from Dean’s sight.
safe, finally safe from my uncle, and my long lost brother decides he wants me dead and everything is screwed up all over again. Not only that, but my father is nowhere to be found and I don’t –.”
“Whoa, whoa, he only mentioned you once, dude. Said you like to come around and ask for help on your English papers.” Then Dean chuckled, “He called you awkward. And he hates your khaki’s.”
Castiel walked over and sat down, pulling his legs underneath him. Dean reached down and picked up the blanket, throwing it over both of them and leaning back with an unnecessarily loud exhale.
Dean drops his hands and raises a brow. “What aren’t you telling me? And does Anna know, because the last time I saw her, she looked like she knew something. Also, did you tell Charlie, too, because the level of sass I got from her on Friday -.”
“What just happened?” he asked, looking at Dean before looking at himself, and then out of the window. “How long have we been sitting here?”
into the kitchen with a flap of his wings. Dean’s sharing a beer with Sam when his head snaps up at the sound.
Sam steps away from his desk, leaving the coffee cup there to sit on the loveseat against the far wall of the small office. Cas follows, sitting down next to him.
Dean walks over to the passenger side door and gently pulls it open. Cas shivers as the cool air makes its way inside the car, but she doesn’t fully wake.
Kevin nods slowly, and Dean moves past him to get to the bunker’s kitchen, leaving Kevin standing confused in the hall. Before he turns the corner, though, Dean yells back, “Oh, and she’s not some chick, she’s Cas!”
Sam was intrigued when Dean told him about his tattoo. Apparently, he honestly hadn’t expected Dean to get his tattoo until he was at least 30. At that, Dean had called Sam a bitch and reminded him that he didn’t have
“You’re more important,” Cas blurted, closing his eyes tight. He breathed, “This is more important, Dean. Family is more important. What kind of best friend would I be if I made you do this alone?”
“Thank you,” Dean whispered, and Cas felt the words more than heard them, the slight vibration in Dean’s voice and his breath on Cas’s neck making them both shake.
When Dean didn’t answer, he heard Castiel sigh and move away from the door. When he was certain that Cas was gone, Dean huffed and sat down on the edge of the tub with his head between his knees.
Dean chuckled, but stood still so Cas could finish buttoning his top. Afterwards, he smoothed his hands over the fabric, over Dean’s chest and shoulders, and stopped abruptly when he realized what he was doing.
He glanced at his watch and realized it had already been over an hour since he stormed out of Castiel’s place. He remembered how he left, what he’d done to Cas’s things, and he felt overwhelming guilt.
"I am sorry, Dean, you did tell me not to do that," Cas says, waving his hand over Dean’s chest, and just like that, it’s dry. "I will try harder to remember."
“No! I mean, yes, kind of. I mean – we’re just friends, sir, I swear. I didn’t mean to cause you any trouble with Captain Crowley, I’m sorry if –.”
Dean exhaled so much air, Castiel thought he was going to fall over. He squeezed Dean’s hands with all his might.
It starts after they work a case with Rowena, which, in hindsight, should have been Dean’s first clue.
Dean's heart sank, "Hey, no worries," Dean assured, "You know you can talk to me if you need to, right?"
When Gabriel went to respond, Castiel cut him off. “Oh, don’t encourage him,” he sighed, putting his water back down. “I can
“Oh, no, of course not! Shows me that you’re gonna be a great employee!” Balthazar patted him on the shoulder before walking behind the cashier counter and motioning for Dean to follow him. He wore a grey v-neck, jeans so tight Dean himself felt uncomfortable, and dress shoes. His British accent made him sound cool, so Dean didn’t mind listening to him speak.
“Now that we’re all here, we can begin introductions. I’m Professor Crowley, and this is the lab section of your 400 level biology class. Lectures will be on Thursday’s, at the same time – 10am. Um, we’ll go around the room, and you can tell us your name, your major, and something about yourself.”
Dean had gone to see him off, along with a few other mutual friends. Cas had saved Dean as his last goodbye, and when they made the announcement for his flights last call, Cas had dropped his bags, grabbed Dean by the collar, and kissed him within an inch of his life.
Dean narrowed his eyes, nails digging into his palms to keep himself from lunging at the man in front of him, “You.”
Dean all but spits out his drink on the lady next to him, apologizing when she eyes him suspiciously after his coughing fit. He recovers, finally, and looks around the room for the person to blame. He spies Cas directly across from him, standing lazily against the wall like he’s already drunk, which isn’t possible.
“It’s for the best,” Dean reassured himself, picking out a box of cereal and making his way toward the dairy section of the store. “You need some time away or you’ll go crazy, you know that.”
Dean slid forward on the Impala’s bench seat and reached for Cas’s hand. “What isn’t Lucifer? Cas, what’s going on?” He rubbed a thumb over Cas’s fingers. “Talk to me”
“I missed you, too,” Cas replied, smiling. “But, of course, I was out for twelve days, so I probably wasn’t even thinking about you.”
Dean clears his throat and takes a step away, keeping one hand on Cas’s waist so that she can find her balance again. Once she does, he moves his hand to her back to lead her to the bunker door. “Alright, let’s try this again,” he says lightly, trying to convince himself that he is simply being a gentleman.
Dean rolls his eyes, but when he looks back at his brother, he figures Sam recognizes Castiel’s tone of voice because his jaw is practically on the floor.
"I know it’s a lot and I know you don’t like surprises but, dammit, it’s your birthday, so I figured you could make an exception."
“Don’t go ratting me out now,” Gabriel replied with a wink, which made Sam flinch a little before he walked out of the room. Gabe turned to face Dean. “Who’s Jess?”
Castiel looked from Anna to Balthazar. “What is she talking about? We haven’t seen Luci in over a decade, how could he have done this?”
"To keep you guys safe! And John wasn’t the best father, but he raised you boys to become two of the best hunters in the game. You’re still alive, ain’t you?"
“Hey,” Dean said, his hand pressed to the small of Castiel’s back. He looked like he was trying to hide his concern, but Castiel saw right through him.
“It’s okay,” Castiel soothed, putting his lips to Dean’s temple. “I’m alright, babe. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Well well, Castiel,” Lucifer sang, “I don’t remember you ever being so authoritative. I’m impressed.” He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms, mimicking Castiel’s posture. “Is that what happened to your arm? Someone hurt you?”
“It’s ironic, I know, seeing as Sammy died--.” Dean’s voice caught in his throat. He should have known he wouldn’t be able to talk about it that easily. But Cas didn’t move to smother him or coddle him, so Dean swallowed before continuing. “– since he uh, died in here. Right...” Dean ran a hand over the steering wheel before dropping it back into his lap. His chest felt tight and his eyes burned, but he refused to cry again, “…here.”
“Nothing, just making sure,” Dean sighs with relief and hopes that Cas doesn’t push for more. When she doesn’t, Dean smiles at her. “Wanna get outta here?” he asks, and ignores the voice in his head reminding him how he uses that line in bars to pick up strippers.
complicated. He quickly put back the tapes he was holding and walked to the register, looking for some sort of business card or –
"Why didn't you tell me?" he asked, eyes glazing over, but Dean could only shrug his shoulders. Cas sighed, and hugged Dean again for a long time. Afterwards, they walked into the the apartment, Cas leading Dean by the elbow into the bathroom.
“Maybe because the woman in our kitchen is wearing your clothes? I mean, I’m not complaining, she’s making lunch. She’s also pretty hot from what I can tell, nice a–.”
“What?!” Castiel sat up and walked to Dean’s desk, where Dean was pointing at the screen of his laptop. There it was, in black and white:
“Tomorrow, I guess,” Dean mumbled, “Don’t worry about it now, babe, you deserve a rest. It’s been a long day.”
When Cas closed his eyes again, Dean leaned his face in to kiss him briefly. When he pulled away, Cas’s eyes were still closed.
Castiel laughed, “Well that’s the whole point, isn’t it? Therapists start with a blank canvas of their patients. The more we talk, the more he’ll get to know me, and then he can figure out how to help me.”
Castiel can’t help but stare. Firstly, because both men are quite beautiful, and secondly, because he’s got about a hundred questions right now.
He turns back toward Dean, says “I’ll see myself out,” then quickly does just that, closing the door behind him.
“Well what are you waiting for?” B poked his head out of the door to look at Dean, who put down the cassettes he was holding.
“Alright, alright,” Cas replied, reaching to grab the other bottles, but stopped. “What the hell happened to your hand!?”
“Hmm, this week,” Castiel mumbled into Dean’s side where his head lay. They had maneuvered themselves into a position that was awkward, but comfortable. Castiel’s legs trapped one of Dean’s between them, while his broken hand rested low on Dean’s waist. Castiel hummed with pleasure every time Dean ran his fingers through his boyfriend’s messy hair. Dean’s free leg was bent, his foot tapping out silent rhythms on the mattress. His other hand was placed behind his head.
“I know a great place downtown, designed to look like a diner from back in the day. The pizza is delicious and the pasta is divine, but the pie is from heaven itself.” Dean was beaming. It had been days since he’d had some quality pie.
“Agreed,” Dean says, paying extreme attention to his phone so his eyes don’t give him away. Cas may still be Cas, but now Dean is very,
After the first tattoo healed, Cas went back to the shop on his own to get feathers tattooed onto the backs of his forearms. He’d seen a picture of it online (the internet was a magical thing) and thought they would be a nice reminder of his lost wings - a farewell of sorts.
When Bobby released them, he stuck his hands back in his pockets and sighed. “Dinner’s almost ready, and the spare room is all fixed up for you guys. Go ahead and get your stuff up there, then wash up before coming down to eat, ya hear?”
“Yeah, we are,” Dean smiles, running his fingers through Cas’s messy hair, “I can’t believe you want to put with me forever.”
“I’m sorry I couldn’t get him to say more,” Castiel apologized, but then Dean was squeezing his shoulder again.
“Oh, Castiel, don’t be dumb,” Lucifer chastised. He moved an arm up to rest his chin on the palm of his hand. The chains attached to the cuffs at his wrists rattled. Castiel guessed that they were about two feet long, which meant that his brother wouldn’t be able to get very far if he tried anything. “I have my sources. You have those things when you’re at the top of the food chain.”
Needless to say, they don’t make it to the party that night, but their stockings are filled with rattles and pacifiers in the morning.
“I like ‘sunshine’ better than ‘princess,’” he said, blinking his eyes open and adjusting to the onslaught of sunlight.
“You will never be safe with me here,” Cas says, and Dean has to remind himself that he means Sam and Kevin, too. “I do not want to put you all at risk.”
Maneuvering was awkward with the cast on Cas’s hand, but they managed easily enough, making sure every inch of Cas’s skin was lathered with soap.
Cas smiles at that. He and Dean hit it off in their intro classes, becoming fast friends within the first semester. They started studying together, and later hung out in their free time. They developed a strong bond after that, and from then on, they became inseparable.  Friendship turned into romance, and right after they passed their board exams, Dean finally built up the courage to ask Cas to be his boyfriend.
Castiel was about to mention that he loved Dean, but then he remembered that Dean hadn’t said it back. His shoulders sagged a little, thinking about that, and he decided that he would rather not discuss his love life with his boyfriend’s little brother – Dean would probably lose it if he found out, anyway.
“I’m…angry,” Cas admitted, “and I just want to put this behind me so I don’t have to think about it anymore. I want him gone. I want him dead –.”
attracted to Cas, as he discovered during his shower earlier. That makes things different. Doesn’t it?
the muscle. “You’ve got nice legs,” Cas said, his voice an octave lower than it had been seconds before. Dean suddenly realized what was happening.
"What? Oh," Cas bent both arms at the elbows, "yeah, I got these when I lived somewhere in Wyoming."
Sam Winchester almost spits out the coffee he’s sipping, manages to swallow it down before it gets all over his computer and paperwork.
"You're upset," Cas said calmly, sliding off his flannel top. "Don't worry, I can't read your mind, but I can still read
Dean feels a hand on his shoulder and opens his eyes to see Castiel standing beside him. When they make eye contact, Cas nods confidently, and Dean knows that, somehow, Cas heard him, and he’s on Dean’s side.
“Right, well after the truck incident, I was really messed up. Couldn’t even get near the impala without freaking out. You know what helped me?”
Dean closed the door and rolled his eyes. He got into the driver’s seat and looked over at his boyfriend, who was still laughing, and biting his lip to keep from doing so.
the Detective emphasized, holding out a hand, “Now we’ve got one of the top dogs in a room. It’s too good to be true. Call me Rufus.”
he shouldn’t have agreed to this arrangement. There’s no way Cas can handle doing this five days a week, ten hours a day, on his own. By the time Dean gets home, he puts Jack to bed before eating his own dinner and passing out. Cas truly has done
“Yeah,” Dean said again, “the police found the asshole that almost killed my boyfriend, and we’ve got to like, confirm it’s him, or something. Today.”
"I missed Sam. He know just how to get you all flustered. It’s cute." Cas is grinning, and Dean rolls his eyes, moving to pick up the pie to place it on the kitchen table.
“Ya know,” Dean shrugs uncomfortably, “I think Cas… is uh…hot.” The last word is barely audible, but when Kevin’s left eyebrow rises to meet his right, Dean’s sure he heard it.
Sam stands and places a hand on Dean's shoulder before speaking. "Ben's with Bobby," he says slowly, "He's safe there. For now."
he thought aloud as he ran out of the bathroom and scrambled to throw on something decent. A white polo and khaki pants would have to do. He checked the schedule he had taped onto the wall next to his bed and grabbed his biology book, a notebook, and stuck a pen behind his ear. He quickly slid his feet into his new Sperry's, took his wallet off his desk, and ran out the door, hair still wet.
“What happened to your hand?” Dean asked, reaching for Cas, but the other man turned and stalked into the apartment. Dean followed and shut the door behind him. “Castiel?”
” Cas whined, and rolled his eyes, then hissed when a bit of shampoo got in them, “Fuck.” He moved to rub his face with the back of his free hand, but Dean stepped into the shower then, hoarding Cas toward the pouring water so he could wash the soap out of his eyes.
"Ben," Dean starts, much gentler this time, "hey, buddy, I didn’t realize that was you. Everything okay?"
“Sam is gone,” Dean whispered, breaking the silence. Cas reached out and grabbed one of Dean’s hands then, and Dean didn’t pull away. He brought his head up and closed his eyes, and Cas could see that one tear had made it past Dean’s emotional fort.
Dean can’t argue there, not that he really wants to, and apparently, neither does his libido. Rolling his eyes internally, Dean clears his throat and thinks of an excuse to leave the room.
have resources, but they’re not gonna take down a cartel with little old me.” He smiled and motioned toward the chair on the other side of the table with a nod. “You’ve been standing by the door this whole time. Come on in, we’ve got all the time in the world.”
“I do,” Dean replies, surprised to find that he’s practically breathless. Being so close and not kissing is sensory overload. Dean feels Cas
Monday comes too soon, and Castiel finds himself feeling sheepish as he walks off the elevator to his desk that morning. Thankfully, the Mayor isn’t in yet, so Cas has some time to get his shit together. He and Meg
Dean chucked. "You'll figure it out. But for now, I'll get an actual first-aid kit, and clean some of these wounds up for ya. Sound good?"
The supermarket outside of campus was close enough to get to by foot, so Dean didn’t mind walking. It was almost noon, and the sun shone brightly in the cloudless sky. It was too hot for jeans, but Dean hadn’t done his laundry in a while, so he didn’t have much of a choice when it came to clothing. The white t-shirt he wore was the only clean top he could find. It clung to him uncomfortably.
Cas leans up, scratches the back of his neck. “The uh, the newspaper article? It was all a ruse,” he explains. “Meg thought it would help me finally get your attention.”
“Alright, so uh…the other day, um…” Dean cleared his throat. “Cas told me he loved me.” He saw Sam’s eyebrows move upwards and sighed. “Yeah, that happened. The Sunday I brought Cas back from the hospital.” Sam dropped one eyebrow and Dean sighed again. “No, I didn’t say it back, Sammy.”
“Oh, thank God!” Balthazar exclaimed. Dean could hear him rummaging around for a few seconds before he spoke up again. “I’ll get Anna from her school and meet you at the hospital. Did you tell Gabriel?”
"In a couple days, I’d say," Dean replies, equally as quiet. "He’s still hurtin’, that much I can tell. But the past two nights, he hasn’t come running to me in tears, so." Dean shrugs, a mixed feeling filling his chest - part sorrow, part…pride?
"It is good to finally meet you," Cas smiles at Ben, and it looks genuine. "Sadly, I must be going now, but I hope to see you again soon."
“And you must be Castiel! How nice of you to join us.” Said his professor, purposely trying to embarrass him, he could tell. He had a thick Scottish accent, and wore all black.
“Oh, come on, you’re all seniors in here, right? You’ve done this a million times, quit your complaining. One at a time now,” he pointed at a blond girl with glasses in the first row, “you can start us off.”
"Hey, you said it yourself - airplanes are flying metal deathtraps. I was simply taking precautions."
voice carries warm and heavy around the shape of his name. Dean can only nod, because this has to be some kind of joke. For a brief moment, Dean thinks,
Dean turned his head and spotted Bobby on the front steps on the house, hands in his pocket, looking the same as always. With one more glance at Cas, he stepped out of the car, Cas following suit. Bobby walked down the steps to greet them both.
Dean pulled on a green crew neck and some jeans, reasoning that it was actually still too warm for a jacket.
Before Dean can answer him, Cas is up on his feet, holding a hand out to help Dean up. The other man takes it, hoists himself up, and follows Cas into the living room. Cas sits them down onto the couch, holding one of Dean’s hands in his own and squeezing.
he reminds himself. He had a busy, but relatively stress-free day at work. Now is the time to support his husband.
“So I’ve been told,” Dean chided. “I’m Dean, by the way. I, uh, hope you can read that chicken scratch. Doctor’s, I swear. It’s like they never learned how to write!”
If he told Cas he loved him, once those words were off his tongue, there’d be no taking them back. Once he said
When he walked away, Anna made a face at Dean, placing her hands on those pretty little hips of hers. “Sorry, sweet cheeks, college ain’t cheap. I take all the discounts I can get.”
"Does the whole family know?" Dean sighs, "I was telling Nurse Bradbury back at school, I love Cas to death, but lately he’s just been so…"
“Yeah, I did. And she’s devastated for you, Dean. Asked me to send you her condolences, but I know you hate that, so I didn’t mention it. But yes, she knows, and she didn’t even get upset about me staying here in Kansas till the end of the month. But now,” Castiel threw his hands in the air and then let them droop by his sides before making his way out of the kitchen and towards the living room. “I’ve been replaced by a car,” he mumbled.
“Wait, Dean,” Cas reaches for his phone and laughs when Dean holds it up over his head, “Okay, but what if --?”
Dean could hardly speak between the fits of laughter erupting from his throat. “Dude, dude – AHAHA – you should have seen your FACE!”
“You just want some alone time with your boyfriend,” Gabriel huffed, but fished out his phone and left the room anyway.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean reaches down to shake her, but pauses to grab one of her hands instead, squeezing it. “We’re here, sleepy head.”
Looking away, Dean bit his lip and nodded slowly, but then he looked back up at Cas and shook his head.
“I think I know how to handle my own brother,” Cas interrupted. Dean could almost feel him seething.
Dean walked into his Politics class a couple minutes before noon. This lecture room was large, with about 200 seats in total, but he spotted some familiar faces near the back. He made his way up the steps that lined the seats and squeezed between Kevin and Ash. They both had heard what happened.
point. He was in no shape to be driving for too long, and he was definitely not stable enough to be left alone for three months.
Cas laughs outright. “Whatever you got me, love, I’m sure I’ll adore it,” he mocks, pecking Dean on the lips. “We’re not supposed to open the presents until later tonight, anyway.”
“She said it’s more comfortable,” he grunts, shifting his position on the armchair. “And I mean, come on. It is.”
“Shit,” Dean whispered, grabbing it off of his dresser and silencing it. He winced as Cas mumbled and rolled over, but thankfully, didn’t wake. Dean breathed a sigh of relief and stepped out into the hall, leaving door ajar. He put the phone to his ear.
“He was one of the three guys who beat the shit out of me,” Castiel grunted. He felt his anger start to grow again; a firm heat in his gut, rising steadily. He needed to see Lucifer. He needed to get this over with. “Where’s my brother?”
“Dean,” Castiel began, “I’m not going to leave you.” He cleared his throat before continuing, “And I know it, I’m so sure of it, because –.”
Castiel chuckled and slid his right hand below the table while Sam wasn’t looking, squeezing Dean’s left knee. Dean stiffened a bit, but kept eating, avoided his boyfriend’s gaze. When Castiel moved his hand away, however, he caught a hint of a smile on Dean’s lips.
“They found him,” Dean stated, moving his hands to rest on Castiel’s hips, his mouth curving into a smile. “Cas, they’ve got him.”
“You were going to propose,” Dean says suddenly, like he’s just now putting all the pieces together. His voice is hoarse, and he loses his footing slightly, grabbing the back of a chair to keep his balance. “You were going to propose?” he repeats, a question this time, like he’s not so sure he believes it.
and as Dean realized this, his first instinct was to run. But then, Cas tightened his arms around Dean's midsection and breathed into his neck, and all the willpower Dean had built up in preparation to let go went right out of him.
Dean tried to forget about that now, though. Cas was asleep, breathing deep and calm, and once he was absolutely positive that Cas wouldn’t hear him, Dean whispered,
"Well I don’t get to enjoy my present for another nine months, so I don’t wanna hear any whining from you." Dean says with a smirk. "But at least I get to gloat about my husband giving me the best gift ever."
They hadn’t mentioned the looming therapy appointment once during the entire weekend, so Dean had completely forgotten, until he was at work on Monday, and Balthazar was fussing at him.
Dean thinks, and immediately feels an ache in his chest. Cas has nothing – no belongings, no possessions – just the clothes on her back.
Cas nodded, and then squatted to dig through his bag for something. Dean furrowed his eyebrows when he saw a pack of Marlboro next to another pack of Lucky Strikes, as well as a mini first-aid kit. Cas pulled out the pack of Marlboro and stood up.
Dean looks up. He isn’t sure what to say to that, or why Cas is asking. The angel is being weirder than usual.
Balthazar rolled his eyes. “She’s outside on the bench being a drama queen. I assured her that you were fine, but we hit traffic on the way here and she got all anxious again.”
Dean sighed. “Well, yeah. I mean, not that women don’t make spectacular doctors,” Dean corrected, and Cas hit him again. “What?”
“Well, well,” Professor Crowley began, folding his hands, “do you have more important things to be doing?”
Dean sniffled, and Cas could tell he was tearing up now, and all he wanted to do is hold Dean and convince him that he was okay, but he still couldn’t get himself move.
Castiel got up, stuffed his phone in his pocket, and began walking towards the door. “If you’re going to act like a nine year old all year, warn me now so I can sign up for a new room.” He was being mildly sarcastic, but the look on Dean’s face told Castiel that Dean didn’t catch that. He really didn’t know why he was so irritated. Gabriel pulled stunts like that all the time when they were home. Maybe it was because he had just met Dean?
Dean wondered how he could have forgotten about his best friend. He hadn't told anyone about what happened, but he told Cas
back in college, but now they’re just friends, and this is supposed to be for show, so Cas tries his best to get into it. He pulls his best friend closer by the waist and opens his mouth. She catches his drift and moans into the kiss, adding tongue.
almost, with one hand on his financial advisor’s thigh and a sly smile on his face. Mr. Ketch looks unphased, but he is playing with Mayor Winchester’s tie while they speak in hushed tones and in
running things, at the top of said food chain?” Castiel asked, “Did you use your resources to track me down?”
“Yes, I suppose you’re right,” Cas mumbled, sitting up straight in the bed. “You don’t have class today, do you?”
"Cas, Sam and I can take care of ourselves. The important thing is, you came back. You're safe. You're here now."
"Nah, we can go out front. But uh, you should get some of these cuts checked out." Dean had just noticed particularly jagged cut near Castiel's collarbone. "Wouldn't want them to get infected."
“What? It’s not like anyone got hurt,” Gabe tried, but Castiel remembered how bad things got during Spirit Week last year, when a mysterious Trickster decided it would be funny to switch out the salt in the dining hall kitchen for sugar.
“He’s 29, he’s practically a man,” Dean jokes, “He’ll be fine. Besides, he wants to go and pull a stunt like this?” He points to the article in the paper, the one he hasn’t been able to stop thinking about since it came out yesterday. “He’s going to have to deal with the consequences.”
Castiel was still looking at Dean and could see him clam up almost immediately, raising a hand to scratch the back of his neck and pinch the bridge of his nose.
“I’m just gonna miss you, is all,” Dean muttered, taking another bite of cereal. Dean hadn’t realized he’d been staring. Why had he been staring?
They had just made it inside their dorm room when Castiel was about to respond, but then Dean dropped Castiel onto his bed, laughing and throwing himself down beside him.
he thought, taking in his appearance. He was average height, average build, and had short dark hair. He wore jeans, boots, and a dark green jacket.
“Don’t worry about the records. Today counts as overtime anyway.” He waved a hand at Dean, and then pointed at him. “But I expect to see you here tomorrow, Mr. Winchester, and
Castiel Milton was the first kid to ever stand up to Dean, besides Sam. It was the second or third week of school, Dean could never remember specifically, and Dean had just failed a biology quiz. Cas sat behind him in class and saw his grade. When the bell rang, he caught Dean in the hallway and offered to help him. Dean, of course, vehemently rejected Castiel’s offer, called him a nerd and told him to leave him the hell alone, or else he’d bash his face in. Now, usually when Dean threw a fit like that, other kids ran in the opposite direction. But as Dean would soon come to know, Cas was not like other kids.
Here's the next chapter! There will be 9 parts in total. Bless you all for reading, please enjoy! <3
“Not your fault,” Cas tells him, playing with his tie. “I’m just glad you’re here now. I’m sorry the house is a mess.”
“You get stuck with the night shift?” Dean asked as he approached. The girl looked up from her magazine, startled, but then she smiled. She placed her magazine underneath the counter and pushed a strand of dark hair behind her ear.
"Dean," he said softly, pulling the bag back over his shoulder and rising until he and Dean were face-to-face. He looked worn, and upset, and tired, but Dean imagined he didn't look much better himself.
"But nothing. I can’t keep him, and for the life of me, I can’t find any of that boy’s kin anywhere. You’re the next best thing, and he
After Dean graduated high school, and Sam finished middle school at the top of his class, they packed up and drove back to Kansas in John’s old ’67 Impala, which Dean claimed as his own. When they arrived, Castiel helped them get settled in, meet some people, find jobs. They lived walking distance from Sam’s new high school, while Dean drove to campus and spent time at Castiel’s apartment. Much to Dean’s surprise, everything turned out alright. Sam easily made friends at his school and did extremely well; Dean took enough classes to be eligible for loans and grants, and took up a job at a local car dealership. They spent their summers back in South Dakota, while Castiel went to Montana to see his family. For three years, everything went smoothly, and Dean was happy. So happy, in fact, that he had stopped waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Dean heard Cas grunt before answering, “I’m fine, I just –.” Cas let out a frustrated sigh and Dean decided it was then appropriate to slowly open the door and poke his head in.
Sam instantly started coughing, a sad attempt to cover his laugh. Dean stared daggers at Castiel, and in return, Castiel blew him a kiss and asked, “Can you get me some cereal, sunshine?”
“Sarcasm, Cas,” he said, chuckling and pulling Cas along. He let go of him for a moment to open the passenger side door of his baby before shuffling Cas inside,
Dean throws the car in park and rips the keys out of the ignition with a little more force than necessary.
“Huh? Yeah! Yeah, I’m good. We should, um, probably get back soon. I’ve got…homework…and stuff. You know.” Dean hoped that excuse worked.
“Don’t play stupid, I heard you!” Dean shouted, leaning more heavily on the student, “You friends with that son of a bitch Lucifer? You help him beat the shit out of his own brother?”
When he heard the door close behind him, Castiel felt both furious and absolutely petrified. Furious because, not five yards away, sat Lucifer, eyes still closed, as calm as ever. All Cas wanted to do was punch his face in, but his body ignored every signal his brain sent telling it to
“Mmmmm,” was the sound coming through his lips, eyes closed while savoring the taste in his mouth, and Dean didn’t know what to do with himself.
He walked over to his bed, sitting down and pulling Dean down beside him. Dean looked a bit confused, but his attention was focused on Castiel.
“Right.” Dean still felt horrible about ditching Cas, but he had asked him to come with, didn’t he? Which was probably worse –
Dean grins, and Cas tilts her head to the side, eyebrows knitting together. This only makes him laugh.
A short story about the events of that night and a couple photos of the kiss take up the whole bottom third of a page. Cas can’t believe how easily the press fell for that stunt. He also still can’t believe he went through with it and is almost sure that Meg must have drugged him somehow. That or hypnotized him. Either way, she definitely knows how to use her popularity in her favor. As promised, Castiel hasn’t lost his job, but he’s not looking forward to seeing the Police Captain any time soon.
“Sure thing, blue eyes,” Dean whispered, pulling Cas in close – holding him, shielding him. “Let’s go home.”
Dean steps around Cas to enter their master bedroom. He pulls his own phone out of his pocket and places it on the charger on his bedside table, then picks Cas’s phone off of the dresser and turns off the alarms for the next three day.
“Thanks for…doing all of this. Making food, or whatever. You really didn’t have to, I’m sure you’re still tired, and –.”
“That is a velvet box,” Cas answers plainly, pointing at it, his eyes never leaving his boyfriend’s, “and inside that box, is a ring.”
Dean’s hands were on him in no time, checking him over, offering him water, which he sipped from a straw before placing it on the table to his side.
Dean and Anna stopped giving each other looks (having eye sex, basically) and turned their heads back to Castiel.
Cas must have caught on to Dean’s desperation, because he climbed into the passenger seat without a fight. Dean walked around the hood to get to the driver’s seat, turned his keys in the ignition, and shifted the car into drive. As he was pulling onto the main road, Castiel spoke up.
Sam shrugged. “I don’t see what the huge deal is, Dean. You either love him or you don’t.” They were sitting on a bench outside of the mathematics building, waiting for Cas to get out of calculus. It was Friday, so Dean didn’t have any classes. Sam had the same math class right after Cas (
Cas blinks a couple times before nodding, pulling her legs out from under the rest of her body and sliding on her shoes. Dean is still holding her hand when she steps out, and it’s a good thing he is because Cas takes all but four steps and trips on a crack in the worn pavement, landing in Dean’s arms with a yelp.
“Mmm,” Cas mumbles, already leaning against the door. She kicks off her shoes and pulls her legs up beside her, squirming a bit in her skirt before finally settling down.
“That’s what soul mates are for, right?” Dean smiled and grabbed Castiel’s hand, pulling them away from the door. “Let’s get out of here, huh?”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas finally says as Dean pulls his car into their driveway. “That sounds really nice.”
It was Cas’s turn to blush. “Oh. Okay, well good.” He bit his lip. “Could you, uh…” Cas moved his casted arm around. “I’m gonna need help getting, um, dressed.”
“I’m your brother, Dean; I should have been in the hospital with you!” Sam exclaimed, startling a few students sitting at tables around them. “Not trying to win over some girl I just met!”
“Sure thing, babe,” Castiel answered sweetly. Dean groaned before walking away towards the breakfast foods. Sam finally let himself laugh.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean managed to squirm his way out of the hug. “I finished moving in and decided to head on over. That’s not a problem, is it?”
“I’m not judging you, babe,” Castiel teased, “but I feel like… if I don’t talk to anyone, I’ll never be…okay. Ya know? A lot of things happened to me when I was in high school and I could never talk about it. I wanted to keep Gabe and Anna safe.”
“I can’t believe we just did that,” Cas admits once the car pulls away from the sidewalk. “Oh, god. I regret it already.”
And then, he’s walking out of the room, and Dean’s got a lump in his throat that doesn’t go away until he’s passing out an hour later.
“I have,” Cas responded, taking a seat in the chair closest to Dean. His eyes were tired, and his body slumped as he propped his elbow up on the table and rested his head in his hand. “You still haven’t answered my question.”
“Yes! It’s my number one priority. There’s nothing more important to me right now. Except perhaps my family, but that’s it!”
Cas can’t help the grin that plasters itself on his face. He pulls the ring out of the box, tosses the box behind him, then slides the ring onto Dean’s left hand. As soon as it’s on him, Dean swoops down and kisses Cas on the mouth, his face wet with tears once again.
But it is gone too quick, gone like the wind. Dean is the first to turn away, leaving Castiel as cold as ice in his wake. It is the precise moment when reality hits him in full speed like a train heading full force down a track of spurning. The point when Cas finally realises the true mistake, the one who was truly in the wrong here was him. The crushing denial that this shared memory never happened between them, never came to the surface of their world. A withered seed in the infertile soil never to bloom again.
“What are you going to do when he finds out that you have been lying to him all this time? When he finally uncovers the real you behind all the layers of lies you tell every day?” The words are harsh with the intention to hurt, but it’s the truth. She needs to see how toxic her little cunning plan is, and that if the secret ever gets out, this royal environment is far from forgiving.
, "Eden is so much more powerful than us, their army is of a vaster scale, they have more supplies, and their men are really well-trained in close combat, yet they are going to come here willingly of their own accord to help a weaker kingdom in defeating an enemy which we didn't even know about until three weeks ago, never mind Eden which lies so far south, and even then Dad didn't want to tell us until last minute about his little feud. I'm telling you, man, they are up to some shady business and we will be too blind to notice when they stab us in the back. No wonder Dad was so hesitant in his reply."
In all honesty, he would prefer to stick with his brothers and sisters. Every person he has met after that point in life has been a pain, annoyingly undermining and approaching with caution like he is a ticking bomb. That’s why he is forever glad to have Anna and Gabriel. They see him for what he truly is, they know his internal struggles and they don’t judge him even if they hear rumours about him all the time. But then again, they are officially informed of his condition and are intellectuals of some sort (Gabriel not so much) so they obviously know that there isn’t anything wrong with him.
Chortling, they join the cracking joke and Dean is glad to have eased the agitated tension between them. It’s the second time he is impressed and rather shocked at Anna’s personality, but it just proves to show that he should really get to know this family better. Sensibly, it should be his top priority to make everyone’s lives easier and it would at the same time get the king off his back, Dean thinks as his thoughts return to the cold conversation they had yester afternoon. However, more positively, he silently admits that he is feeling more than a little excited to show his guests more of the Winchester way of life, and in turn learn about theirs, incredibly eager to start this possible new friendship. He already has a feeling that these two are a few of the better siblings, easier to get along with, but under no circumstances will he judge others by gossiping tales of young girls. Besides, that’s what he’s expected to do anyway.
It must have been far too long a moment that Dean sits staring and speechless that he must have caused a great deal of unnecessary worry on their part; even Sam shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Determined to relay his decision, he shakes off his reverie and meaningfully replies the long awaited response of, “Alright, what do you want us to do? We need a plan of action if we don’t want the entire castle to have heard the story by midday.”
As predicted, the flock follow the brothers up the smooth, stone stairs and through the dense, wooden doors of the building, finding themselves inside the belly of the main foyer. This particular part of the castle was nothing special, just a plain crossroad that stems off to lead to other parts of the castle, yet something seemed to catch their attention and halt the entire party completely. And alas, Dean Winchester knew what that something was.
But as green eyes race to meet with sad, blue ones, he swears to stick by their side and help out in any way he possibly can and they will start by dealing with any false accusations first. It would be the least he could do as one of the available representatives of Lawrence.
“Alright, Cas, I know. I just hate how my life is planned out from the very beginning. Where is my say in this? Maybe I don’t want to go off to some faraway land and marry an old, rich man, to whose my only function is bearing his heirs. Maybe I don’t want to leave my family.”
Now it was Castiel’s turn to roll his eyes but he luckily refrained from saying any more as to not crush the innocent child’s dreams. She is too precious for this cruel and dangerous world.
“Dang, Cassie. It’s even bigger than the one back at home,” Gabriel comments, elbowing Cas in the process. It would be a lie to say he isn’t a tad fascinated himself. He had always enjoyed sparring, training on a daily basis and taking pride in delivering swift, strong moves when thrust into action. Maybe it was due to being trained from a very young age, maybe his eagerness should take the credibility, but he has to admit that he knows enough to get through the battlefield, and apparently according to Anna, that was being humble about it. “I’ve seen you train, Cas. You’re amazing.” Being under Michael’s care and granted personal training was and still is probably one of the greatest and most unique experiences that he will forever be grateful for. It taught him the skill of agility, speed and strength, and everything else a knight needs. Obviously he is nowhere near as extraordinary as Michael, but a man can dream, right?
“Did you seriously just get your ass kicked? Or did you just feel sorry for them and let them win? Either way, you better start explaining why I now have to pick you up off the floor. I was going to stop by and say hello, you know make sure you aren’t standing off to the side like a loner, but I’m certain Michael wouldn’t let that happen anyway. I had a spare minute but as soon as I get here, you boys are packing up early, so what happened? You guys set your sticks aflame again in all that feistiness you all got piled up in there or what?” Anna lists off in one breath.
They all stand upon the King’s arrival, and are quickly allowed to return to chatter amongst themselves. Other than Balthazar standing for no reason to toast nobody in particular and the odd joke from Gabriel, it’s boring. He would rather go to sleep in his warm, comfortable chambers than be present here, but since this feast is in their honour he shall stay for the celebrations. Even better, he would rather carry on his conversation with the buoyant prince.
However, to His Majesty's disappointment, only one of the replies had agreed to act the savior in this time of critical emergency, and the once-friends that John had thought he had in the other realms became quite questionable.
“Cas, you listen to me. Don’t you dare think that what they are going to start saying is true. It’s not and you know that. You are the kindest, bravest and smartest person I know and nothing is going to change –“
Observing the men in the hall below, he sees many already beyond drunk and he wonders if there will even be anyone sober left by the end of the night. In addition to this, as the insignificant tickle of a bell is sounded, he also sees some of the Lawrencians are quick to punch the loud Edenish soldiers to silence who are not yet familiar with the custom, causing said laughter to die in a fit of sputtering coughs as the increasingly louder ringing causes King John to ascend above them all. A blanket of deadly silence falls over the hall, sealing all secrets within just like the heavily barricaded double doors.
“No, Samantha, I don’t swing that way. I’m authentic. I’d rather find out how bad they are first hand, so I have a valid excuse in front of Dad. Now get moving and clear up that big mess of yours,” Dean says, pointing to the ever-growing pile of inks and papers sprawled across the library desk, “I expect you to find me in a few minutes, bitch.” And with that, Dean leaves the room in search of his pompous ass of a father.
“Well, did you’re dancing skills impress her by any chance? And by ‘dancing skills’ Cas, I mean a duck can walk better than he can. I nominate Dean to show you, it’s hilarious.”
“Yeah, only because she won’t even let me anywhere damn near that guy,” Dean grunts out, anger starting to bubble inside him again. “What the hell, Sam. Who does that? And don’t you dare give me any of that ‘you would have done the same thing’ crap, because I know not to take it too far, okay? I know that when somebody is intent on something, it is in their best interest to listen, not dismiss the idea completely. She won’t even hear me out, Sam!”
you with, so don’t try to tell me otherwise, because you know that between me and him, trust is a one-way street.”
Sure, Dean is glad to be of any help he can to make his new guests as comfortable as possible but he is still curious as to how this even came about, I mean, he has got to ask just to make sure.
In truth, it all happened far too quickly for him to fully register what was going on. One minute he was talking to Dean and the next he is stricken to the floor. Before he has a chance to piece together the flurry of memories, a certain redhead plonks down beside him.
He spots Anna sitting in her usual seat and smiles when she gives a little wave. The long table is full except for the two kings and his brothers Balthazar and Gabriel, but that’s no surprise really. As soon as he settles in his chair, Anna grabs his arm wildly and to say he hasn’t seen such childish excitement in her eyes in such a long time is an understatement.
Cas is interrupted by a harsh tug on his sleeve from a raging redhead plonking down heavily beside him. The man in question turns away and sharp, quick whispers follow, just out of earshot. Annoyed, the agitated woman has flames in her eyes as she gradually raises her voice and repeatedly smacks her brother’s arm lightly in between each sentence like a misbehaving child. The whispering voices grow louder until they aren’t strenuous to hear.
He can only manage five bites despite going extremely slow, and the additional strain on his tendons cause the pain to return in crashing waves of agony onto the swelling area, much stronger than before, so he decides to just give up now before he damages it any more.
His running thoughts are interrupted before he even gets halfway across the floor of swaying bodies, as a strong force pulls his arms back making him swivel and stumble into a solid, warm chest. He grabs onto the fabrics hanging loosely from the figure to steady himself but it hardly helps him keep aloft as the warm solid flesh starts violently shaking as a low bellied, loud rumble of laughter erupts from deep within said chest. It has a distantly familiar ring to it and Castiel droozily lifts his heavy swimming head as he takes into account the sharp angular face the soft full lips and the constellation of freckles in bursts across skin amongst valleys of green. Suddenly, realisation slowly fades onto his face as he acknowledges the not-so mysterious figure standing before him, only a few inches apart.
is going on so he speaks hastily before the King makes his presence so as not to get his favoured friend in trouble.
“Aw, shit. Believe me, I truly didn’t mean it like that, it’s just...” the prince falters in his speech, evidently taking a breath before saying “weird, I guess. Could we like, skip the formalities? I’m kinda used to everyone calling me just Dean, and I definitely don’t act like a prince.”
“No worries, you could almost say what a coincidence,” Dean replies, stifling a chuckle. “May I ask for one dance?”
A curt scoff is enough to awaken him from his thoughts. “I knew it,” is all Sam has to say to have Castiel enveloped in a flood of red, hot embarrassment at being caught staring. He really should know better when it comes to Sam. It kind of makes him feel as if the whole silent exercise was on purpose, and he shouldn’t be surprised if it was, but Castiel is too busy trying to cover up his mistake to dwell on that much longer.
Reluctantly, Castiel rolls out of bed with a deep groan and heads over to the washing basin, ever the not –so morning person that he is. He changes into his worn, simple training underclothes; a set that he holds onto dearly, being one of the last gifts he ever received from Naomi. With the soft, tan cotton swaddling his body hinted with faint traces of lavender that remind him of Naomi and better days gone by, he heads out in search of Anna to borrow a set of her larger leathers that he could wear after breakfast, when he hopefully heads out to train. Everybody was promised new leathers upon arrival, with there being an upcoming war and all, but Castiel doesn’t think he can wait any longer to get measured for a new fit, before actually doing any training. It’s like an itch under his skin and an excitement brews below his body’s surface for finally being granted a return to the activity after being locked away in a carriage for two weeks during the long journey here and then spending another week locked away in his isolated room. As giddy as he ever can be, he prances down the castle corridors to the morning meal.
At least their father has the decency to acknowledge people like this cock-sucking donkey, no matter their place in the hierarchy, which, coming from John, is quite honorable in itself. Never mind, at least it has become very clear as to whom he should avoid in the upcoming weeks.
“It’s Cas-ti-el and I do believe it has been to my greatest pleasure, Prince Dean, but I have yet to explore the rest of the castle.”
“Maybe she doesn’t see it yet. Give her time to realise that you haven’t and aren’t going to tell anyone and in fact, want to help her. I have observed that she is quite the independent lady so give her the freedom and respect that she has fought for. I have a feeling that she is too clever to stay angry over such a petty little thing like this for long.”
“Alright, when you’re done fangirling, I suggest you move your ass and help me with the last of the preparations. I’m going to go ask Dad where he wants us, and check around, see if the rooms are ready –“
. Everyone always bosses him about like he doesn’t have a mind of his own. Maybe they actually think his mind has ran away somewhere ever since that incident.
Castile scoffed and leaned back.  He was just tired of pretending, pretending to be their perfect angel, their perfect son who would do no wrong.  He looked at dean when he suggested they do something, raising an eyebrow.  “Like what?”  He asked him.  He shrugged a little.  He ignored his smart ass comment and just decided to add on to that information.  “My parents are gone until Sunday night, so about... 5 more days.”  He said softly, wondering if he should’ve said that or not.
Dean was casual, not really thinking anything of what he’d done with Cas because it honestly didn’t really mean anything to him. Just another fuck was all it was. He’d almost forgotten about him, until a few days later when he got pissed at someone and needed to get his anger out, or calm down in some way. He was walking down the hall, ready to smash his fist into a locker when he saw Cas. He smirked, walking over to him. “Hey Cassie, long time no see.” He said. “Let’s go on a walk.” He said, though he had a devilish look on his face, his tone also giving Cas the hint to not disobey him
“Quiet! Today is the day we can finally train! You can show me your skills, how does that sound?” An uproar of applause is enough of a positive response from them so he continues. “I want to see what level you are all at. We’ll start from the basics and progress from there. You will be working in pairs in the upcoming weeks, but no excluding, alright? Or I will hunt you down,” booms Michael’s voice, a threatening promise so deadly true that Castiel can only nod to from experience seeing him target Edenish boys in the past. “For our first activity, you are to split off and find a partner. Practise all the basic moves, stances and then the real fun begins when we actually spar and pick up the pace. Any questions?” Michael’s tone never leaves any room for argument but he asks the question nevertheless. “Alright boys, let’s go.”
“I don’t think you realise just how truly we’re fucked without the help we’re getting. So, I’m just going to lay it out, plain and simple.” He can see the dark storm rolling over the hills of green in his eyes, clouds of captivating terror, and suddenly John is stepping into his personal space. “You are going to go out there and please their extravagant asses for as long as it takes to get us through this war. I don’t give a damn about what you have to do. So, I’m telling you this, man to man, that if you fuck this up for us, that’s on you.”
“Oh really? So tell me and the rest of the court what it does look like then because we aren’t blind, that’s for certain-“
But as night fades into dawn, he falls asleep dreaming of other knights in the battlements fighting bravely among green fields and valleys within clear orbs of hypnotising power.
Blindsided, Anna carries on, “oh, you needn’t worry about anything else, my princes. I have already talked out what I can with the washer women and spoken to the Edenish guards. I specifically told the men to go to each member of the court and apologise on my behalf for the disruption. They were to deliver a whacky story as to why they might have heard a scream at such an early hour.”
A sharp stab of pain clenches his chest at hearing the brutal truth laid out by Anael before him. He can’t imagine the hardships that Anael is facing right now, - correction -, he can, and its way worse. But this ignites a new burning hope that one day, when he sits upon his father’s throne, he will change the system, no matter how long he has to wait and that’s a certainty. He will fight for his sisters and brothers till his dying breath.
“Cheerio! I’m off to admire my liege prince and future husband from a closer perspective. You coming? I’m a kind person and I like you, so we can share the prize if you like.” Chuckling, Anael winks and turns her back on him without delay.
Spotting a drowsy Garth stood post at the small side door, he strains a loud murmur which is gladly enough to catch his attention. The guards aren’t really supposed to be talking on duty, much less to the princes, but Dean is desperate to find out
“The only thing that I would kindly ask you about is if you could get your men on board with it too,” Anna says on a more serious note, “that way, everyone follows along and nobody gets suspicious.” Anna finishes with a cheery, fake grin that emphasises her mocking pretence of an innocent young princess, but who in reality has many tricks up her sleeve, the ultimate gift horse.
Before Dean can muster a valid excuse for his actions, he is interrupted by the hushed growl of Sir Robert Singer, Dad’s adviser, from behind, “listen to your father, boy.” Grumbling under his breath, Dean zooms in on the tedious exchange of pleasantries between the two monarchs.
Unnecessarily loudly, Dean’s chair scrapes against the hard stone floor producing an unpleasant grinding sound that earns him attention and bitchface #17 from Sam. He can’t help it if his legs are cramped and he needs to stretch. So what if maybe some of his chair scrapes across the floor in the process and simultaneously causes the desired effect on the others?
“Well, I thought you looked a bit lonely there. I didn’t want you to miss out on the fun.” The prince joins both sets of hands together and gently pushes one backwards as to guide Castiel to follow the correct moves. The melody of violins is upbeat enough to attract lots of attention, so it is not long after that they are twirling at a steady pace among a flurry of fabrics, gowns and boots. Regretfully, he can confidently say that he feels the wine kicking in. He has no idea how Dean isn’t throwing up right now.
The complex analogies and wishful thinking is enough to send him into a swirling haze of messy thoughts and headaches. That’s enough thinking for one night, so he decides to head to his room because it is already past late.
He gulps for air, but its path is constrained as Castiel’s thoughts return to Anael. Worry clenches his heart as he thinks it’s all happening
There looks to be more news coming his way though, so he refrains from commenting for the time being, despite how hard staying silent may be.
“What now, Dean?” Sam replaces the heavy book upon the small stool, next to the armchair he is lounging on directly before the fire. The blooming days of summer choke out the remaining life of chilly spring but sometimes the strong season relapses in a final push before it takes its last breath and is banished for good. As Dean enters the room, he brings with him the howling winter storms in full force. A dark mood quickly settles upon the room like the frosty fallout of flakes.
Sam stalks through the halls in search of the princess but to no avail he stumbles around the castle like a lost puppy. Giving up, he goes where his feet lead him, one foot after the other, head hung low and in his own subspace of conscience, lost to his thoughts. Aimlessly, he steps into the throne room when from the corner of the large palace window comes a loud hiss. Confused, Sam lifts his head as curiosity gets the better of him and he goes to investigate. The weird noise comes again, probably from behind the curtain, until he hears the call of his name. He has never heard of talking snakes before, even from the exotic trainers who all those years ago brought in animals on display for the Royal family’s entertainment that Sam had never even heard of. The harsh whisper speaks his name again, but this time commanding him to follow his words.
Sam is in the middle of describing the time Dean left a rotten fish in a poor trader’s cart, when in their fit of laughter they don’t realise the shadow that has crept up on them from behind.
“Aren’t you too drunk for this?” Castiel tries to politely ask, but all condolences seem to fly out the window as fear grips all his senses for worry if he will be the one to throw up tonight and that certainly won’t be a pretty sight. He wouldn’t want to be the one to ruin the party.
Reluctantly, Dean’s sagging posture slowly melts into the correct stance. So he does know how to fight – great, what a waste of time. Patience is running thin with him right now, so he initiates the first strike, which to no surprise, Dean blocks skillfully without batting an eyelash.
Castiel releases a tired sigh. Unfortunately, since the little misunderstanding that happened last week, any plans for weapons training were delayed by a whole seven days and with nothing to do, he had spent those sad, lonely hours bored out of his mind, maybe reading a book here, or sorting through his chests there, between taking visits to Anna’s bedroom too. Both understood that the time was needed to clear things up and sort them out, threaten a few people here and there to keep quiet, but by the time the week was over, they were both out of their minds, with nothing to do except hang out together, despite what others might think. It was quite frankly annoying and just wasted the time that he could have spent training already, but with the rise of the sun comes a new beginning to the day with a chance to start exercising his strength again. He just hopes that no word has reached the ranks yet. Castiel doesn’t know what he would do if he couldn’t train with Michael or worse, even at all.
In a sheepish expression, the prince looks down at the floor as a tint of colour blooms across his face.
Although, this agreement in itself was relatively unusual and perked his interest because unlike most of the replies he received in the past, it weirdly did not enclose any demand for payment, trade or alliance, just permission to be hosted warmly at Lawrence city's gates and space for housing their soldiers and supplies. The Kingdom of Eden's army would need to set up at Lawrence so that both forces can march forwards in cooperation, and John needed to discuss plans of attack or otherwise with their ruler, King Chuck, anyway, so that is how on this fateful day, the Winchester family find themselves increasingly antsy as they await the infamous Eden company to arrive.
Unexpectedly, there is a stifled snort from between them as Castiel explains, “by that she means she threatened to slice their throats in the night if they ever told a single soul about today’s events.”
Simultaneously the two brothers lean in to one side as to better hear the heated argument currently exchanging between the siblings.
Being the solitary, stubborn man that he is who never asks for any help, he struggles in silence for a while until Anna notices and discreetly helps him grip the utensils, even if the numbness prevents him from a proper hold. After all, he needs both hands to use the cutlery in the proper royal fashion, and he wouldn’t want to lower his reputation more than it already is, with acting like the common folk, or worse eating with his one other hand, which would be plain shameful. He is a royal after all.
He doesn’t even give him a chance to reply before he is being dragged away by the wrist and lead onto the floor centre, interwoven like a puzzle piece between the claustrophobic crowds of swaying bodies in time with the music. As if on cue, the tempo of the strings changes to a more upbeat, festive tune and the men and women alike fall into step with a traditional folk dance. Castiel acknowledges that this activity would be more fun if he actually knew what was happening in the whirl of colours and spinning lights.
“Good afternoon, Father,” is the firm greeting Dean offers in his attempts to announce his presence, without spooking the wild animal.
Castiel stands rooted to the spot as he watches on as the capturing, breathtaking man strides away, with a false pretence yet still managing to leave behind a warm, longing presence in his wake.
“You can’t give in! They can say whatever they want but I am going with you, whatever your punishment might be.”
“Well I am incredibly sorry but if you don’t mind, I’m feeling rather tired right now so I think I might head to my room.”
Then quietly, as his shadow grows along the wall and eventually fades into the distance, he adds to the empty darkness, the ghost of a presence “you are going to regret this come dawn.”
“So, what’s the news?” Sam asks, breaking the tense silence. Confusion settles across Cas’ face until realisation clicks into place and fear replaces his eyes. Immediately
He is a virgin to the purest extent. He has never come close to any man even friendship wise after his rumour got out, and he utterly refused with girls. He would get teased by it, sure, but he never let it affect him. He knows the men like to joke about, but those words never truly mean anything. They will forget about it in a few weeks time and he won’t be mentioned again until the next season they’re out hunting together again.
“The name’s Gabe,” the offender holds out his hand in a sign of peace and good intention. Apparently, that’s enough for one to become friends Sam thinks as he takes the warm flesh between his. “Oh and skip the formalities why don’t you, after what we’re about to do next all your princely dignity will fly out the window.”
“Some other time, kiddo,” Gabriel huffs, “come on, I gotta take you home so dear old daddy won’t start worrying.”
Thinking there is more to the story, Dean waits in silence but the pause stretches on and Anna has already turned to stare hard at her cold breakfast. Confusion muddles his mind as he replays the story in his thoughts, seeking out the horrid, sinful deed that has managed to get his guests so worked up over. Unimpressed, Sam glares daggers his way and he is about to give in when suddenly it all clicks into place.
Determined, Castiel follows Anna into the changing room, where a whole assortment of worn, stinking leathers can be found, some he hopes he never has to wear. On the side, he locates two piles of sturdier leathers with the royal emblem in the middle of a wooden bench, and both siblings are quick to shuffle into them, strapping each other tight. Nobody is around, the room completely barren, but despite this, they deem themselves ready and head out onto the yard anyway. Surprisingly, the yard is already partially filled up with groups of soldiers standing off at the outskirts, just waiting around because most of them had already changed before breakfast. It’s a little intimidating, not knowing any familiar faces among the crowd.
Slowly, the congregation sets off again down the narrow, winding route with Castiel hovering nearer to the back and keeping Anael company. They converse about nothing in particular, - the visit so far and likewise –which deflates him with gladness that the usual interrogation is over until eventually, Anael asks the inevitable.
“Sorry about that, I was curious and in desperate need of a dance partner,” Dean says while chugging down a gallon of wine he had picked up along the way. He drains the cup to the last drop and leans over, swaying to each side as he fails to keep his balance.
That seems to be enough to get a reaction out of him at having his bowlegs called out on. Castiel would love to join in on the fun, but he has a queasy feeling in his gut to abort because he is approaching dangerous territory here. And, as per usual, his gut is right.
Stepping into the bathroom, he shoves the towel in an empty basin near the washing station grumpily strutting into the centre of the room. Looking around, it is a rather spacious bathroom, one Castiel thinks is way too generous for a guest. He also notices that the tub is already full with searing, scented water, probably reserved for Anna but out of the goodness of her heart she must have given up her ‘me-time’ for him. Castiel feels a sly smirk work its way onto his face as he proceeds to lock the door and strip the wine-stained clothes from his aching body. As he lowers his sore, aching flesh and allows himself to loosen his tired, aching muscles, he shuts his eyes to the world and lets the worries of his world drift off into the water, lets the heat sap all the pain away, as he floats into a meditating headspace, one he hasn’t realised he needed until now. Words can hardly describe the high, care-free feeling of having no worries or objections to worry about, to finally let go of the burdens of today and the days to come in the short hour that he can spend by himself. The time passes too quickly before the water has turned cold, and the candle is just a mere stub glued to the dish, the flame dangerously close to snuffing out as it flickers its guttering flame every second, a sure warning that he has already spent too long in there. He really can’t help it. Castiel makes haste with drying and changing for bed.
“It can’t be nothing if I have heard it halfway across the continent. And anyway, I could do with a different sparring partner.”
Winchester Castle looms over their heads; a vast and stunning beast preening in the dull afternoon shimmer at the expense of the stray, ogling visitors. The architecture is stunning;  an astonishing  work of art Castiel is sure must have taken years to articulate to perfection, the amount of care taken into consideration to ensure every minute detail was to the highest of standards for the King, very clear and becoming clearer yet with every step he takes towards it.
“Okay, but um...” Dean clears his throat as he buys time to think of how to phrase the next awkward question properly. Soon enough, Dean finds that there really is no way to word this comfortably. “You err... didn’t um.... do anything, right?” Dean tries to leave it on a hopeful, positive tone but fails miserably in comforting the targeted audience.
On this particular morning, the hall is full with soldiers despite the early hour, standing, laughing and throwing food, their loud chatter filling the enclosed space. Sunlight pools in through the high windows, illuminating the castle with its early summer glory, and birds are chirping away as they take flight outside. Castiel thinks it’s a really good day for training. He thinks it might even be a good day in general, which for him comes very rarely nowadays.
Not exactly new information. Looks like Gabriel’s just trying to get on his nerves again. Not exactly new information, either.
“From what I’ve heard it’s got somethin’ to do with some maid. The poor bird must’ve seen somethin’ she shouldn’t have because she won’t speak to anyone. Just sits there cryin’ her eyes out.”
“Last time you said exactly the same thing, and you were so drunk, you plummeted 15 barrels in the winery and you ended up sleeping in the stables.”
Once Castiel is settled, Sam holds out two cups for the serving girl who was waiting against the wall to fill them up and promptly holds one out for Castiel. He takes it with an expression of thanks, but refrains from voicing any other thoughts. Sam isn’t seeing the need to talk, just sitting back and observing, maybe sipping on his wine from time to time, so Castiel ties up the ends of any conversation starters that he might have had. He lets himself relax a bit, reclining in his seat a little more than usually acceptable and lets his eyes roam. The floor is filled, the maids who have finished their chores for the night join the cluster of masculinity and all is a joyous free entanglement of limbs as everyone dances with one partner, then another. He spots Dean within that compressed crowd as well, swaying merrily with his sister, as they whisper dirty promises into the other’s ear with only the low hanging moon to bear witness outside. It’s a rather appealing sight to look at. Anael hooking her long, slim palms onto those strong, broad shoulders, always a pleasant smile upon her swollen red lips when within the prince’s perimeter.
Logically, the guards should have alerted him if plans have been changed for the evening communal activities, but he is distantly hearing the clamour of cups being smashed against chalices and the merry, joyous laughter bursting his way through the door. Even so, the guards on duty should be escorting him right now, not the bloody prince.
his body seizes up and Dean can’t say he has ever seen a look of such intense, concentrated terror upon the Prince’s features. It’s worrying and Dean has a wrong feeling in his gut that whatever he’s about to hear is not going to be pretty.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, Cas. I’ve been trying to get you alone because no matter how hard I try I can’t get past Anna, she won’t let me talk to you or her for that matter. Please, hear me out.” If they weren’t currently occupied with the activity, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine Dean begging on his knees. With a strained grunt, Cas lowers his weapon, a general consensus for Dean to continue  making his point. “Alright, so you’ve probably already heard my apology but I’m sorry, I truly am. I was wrong to have made that assumption and I see that now. I went to your sister Anael and she said she would pass it on for me, my apology that is, but I guess I should have known better. And there is nothing between us for that matter.”
“No thanks,” Castiel quietly replies under his breath, cringing. A clearing of a throat shakes his train of thought away as another voice announces its presence.
“Okay, but seriously, today was fun and I would love to try it again. You know, you’re not as bad as I thought.” Sam thinks he can pay to be a bit more brutally honest with this guy, he doesn’t seem to take anything seriously and that for once might be a good thing.
Apparently Castiel is the broken one, the odd one out among his siblings. Never having to spend time with another girl had been a gift and curse and had worked up until last year, when Chuck had probably deemed Castiel fit enough for starting a family of his own. Forcefully he had been made to court at least half of the wealthiest girls in the Edenish Kingdom which didn’t even turn out too well. There was one instance in which Castiel was paired with a pretty young thing called Hannah and they had been together for a whole six months before it all fell apart. The poor girl was really eager – even stood bare in the middle of the room once as to catch his attention – but he didn’t see her as anything more than a friend and it utterly broke her. Don’t get him wrong, he can acknowledge somebody else’s beauty, but the romantic feeling was mutual, and since that day he swore never to be in a relationship again. He always ends up hurting the other or himself, and he can’t take the ongoing glares from Chuck again.
Reluctantly, Castiel withdraws from the magnificent site of the throne room and turns to see Anael holding up a disturbingly worried sign in her eyes targeted Gabriel’s way, to which Cas shoots back a too-curious-for-his-own-good-don’t-you-think-?
“Come on little bro, you really think I’m gonna screw up? It’s only a few cups, and besides, I don’t need a babysitter.”
He hears tentative, soft footsteps pad over and meet at the doorframe. Prince Sam’s lips are pressed firmly together in a thin, tight line and he hopes aloud that Castiel likes his room.
But what could have happened to lead a young girl so reluctant to speak out? What had she seen? Most castle business is kept under highly strict circumstances so none of the servants know even a glimpse of their plans. Also, they have locks on their doors for a reason. True, Dean never chooses to lock his door, but he has never had a reason to. In fact, the more sensible it is to keep it unlocked so that he can escape the room in the event that he doesn’t meet the same fate as their mother. Their mother’s demise is still a fresh wound on his heart so he doesn’t talk about it much. He likes to keep it bottled up on the inside, all the anger at the cruel world pent up to the brim. Inside where he can keep everything under control and put on a show when he needs to. Inside where there once was a bright soul now lays a gaping hole, leaving behind the broken shell of a man.
“Yeah, I think we can finally put the thousands of men to good use,” comes a voice from behind. Surprisingly, Sam comes over and perches on the free seat beside Anna, happy to keep them company since his brother is not here. Speaking of, he hasn’t seen him for quite a while, all of this past week really, but just as he finishes scanning the entire room, there the elder prince strides in, with a beautiful young girl on his arm which he recognises as his sister, Anael. Annoyed, jealousy pulls tight in Castiel’s chest as he watches the two laughing and skipping down the aisle, absorbed in each other’s world. All he can think of is what happened? How has their bond evolved so much over the last seven days? Surely he can remember the crude words put in place by Dean to describe his sister’s ‘annoying’ personality. Wearily, Sam glances his way after noticing the display before them, unusually stiff and straight postured, whilst Anna turns her knuckles white by choking her cutlery with a deadly grip. Castiel can tell just whom she wishes was chocking under her hold right now when the redhead’s fierce eyes strike the opponent before them.
Satisfied, she is met with the acceptable, small shake of the head by Sam so she starts up again, this time taking on a tired, pleading stance. “So being the kind, caring sister that I am, I let him stay the night and you can probably figure out the rest from there. What a nasty shock it must have been for the woman who walked in on us at the break of day.”
She drawls out the first syllable on her tongue in a slow, seductive growl and there is no mistake behind who her thought process could possibly be tearing apart right in this instance.  Castiel is determined to play coy and files that thought away for later.
Dean looks into both of Castiel’s eyes respectively, an extensive, hard stare that’s almost calculating or forming a plan. Not to be rude, but if this carries on any longer, as always he will be the one who is called out for it, undoubtedly by Balthazar, and he’s quite frankly too tired to put up with that again. Politely, he eventually averts his gaze to Michael, a silent thank-you for the good word, to which he gives a curt, stoic nod, more like a bow of the head.
Heaving a loaded sigh, Castiel faces his nuisance of a brother, and waits expectantly for what is surely another crude joke. Surprisingly, that indeed is not the case.
At least he doesn’t have to wait long for food to arrive. Dinner is served – a myriad of all types of dishes you could think of. The second course brings even more variety onto the table and the third fills their stomachs to their maximum capacity. Whilst distracted, he takes a moment to gain his bearings and look at his surroundings. Looking down the long table, he sees that most seats of honour are filled by his family, but some are indeed left empty; the spaces for the few lords and ladies of Lawrence who couldn’t make it tonight because they were too tired.
“That wasn’t complaining, Jerk, it’s called examining the evidence and testifying whether the client’s case is valid or otherwise. I was merely practicing and exposing my skillful attorney side.”
The prince doesn’t even let him finish the sentence before he is stuttering out a long list of “no,no,no” ‘s accompanied with a look of utter shock and fright.
The group is eventually strayed away from the captivating artistic view and lead to complete the rest of the tour.
“Nothing.” Whereas Sam would usually be trying his best to hide a smug, devilish grin, now only a faintly amused, slightly perplexed look remains. “What was that for?” he inquires instead.
Unfortunately, the prince has a point and he’s really not up for argument right now, so Castiel resignedly huffs out an agreement. Dean looks about as giddy as a stable pony but when confronted to fight and reminded by Michael to “get on” with their training, he’s about as hopeless as a four-year-old, maybe even worse than Samandriel.
Hearing the scowl she receives beside her, she adds, “and I was in my room because I got Lord Zachariah to take your brothers to bed if they got out of hand. You don’t have to handle everything yourself Cas,” she says in a sweeter voice, “and that includes this.”
Dean hangs his head in shame but it is gone in an instant as he schools his expression to a cunning smirk and says, “I can think of many things I’d like to watch go
They were at war. Who knew that a small dispute between two kings from faraway lands could cause a battle to commence in full scale, engaging entire kingdoms. There was much at stake here, as with any major battle, yet even the commoners knew how much of a blow this will be to the Kingdom of Lawrence.
At that, her face falls, dumbstruck that her plans weren’t so secretive after all, before a sly smirk curls her lips upwards.
There is a bright, golden glow emitting from a slither under the frame, so Castiel hopes to find Anna in case he accidentally misjudged the room to be someone else’s in his alcohol induced haze. Mustering up the courage, he straightens his posture as to look as sober as possible and he raps three long hard knocks on the plank’s centre.
The beautiful woman evokes a newfound confidence in him, so Dean seals the pact with a flashy grin of his own, closely resembling his signature bold, cocky nature. He seems to have zoned out because he soon finds himself adorning a virtually busted kneecap by one Samuel Winchester, who when confronted only cringes at the exchange, sporting a look of “
Since when does Dean Winchester do anything stupid? More like outright nonsensical and foolishly dumb would be more accurate. True to his word, Dean proceeds to leave the premises after a few minutes of snooping around and do the dumbest thing in the history of Lawrence that he was specifically told not to do.
Dean walks five steps before turning around once again distracted, and Castiel has to refrain from rolling his eyes as he wonders if he will even succeed in getting this stranger into bed. It’s usually easier than this, but then again, he would be using other methods... Who knew it was so hard to put Princes to bed? No wonder Chuck gave up a long time ago.
Castiel leaned back as dean continued to drive, watching the forests and everything pass the car.  He looked at him when he parked, getting out of the car with him and eyeing the box he was holding.  He saw him pull out a rolled cigarette, probably weed, making him freeze.  His parents warnings immediately shot through his head when it came to drugs.  “No, I’m not stupid.”  He glared slightly.  “I’ll have sex with you, but I’m not gonna risk killing myself.”  He leaned away from him slightly, watching him with a small grimace.
Castiel did as he was told, sucking on his fingers and shivering.  He felt dean touch him as a tease, making him moan softly around his fingers, swallowing and trying to continue.  He was terrified still, and there was no way he’d be able to stay calm or relax during any of this.  He did his best to not bite down on his fingers, forcing his mouth to stay open.  “H-uck.”  He tried to say fuck, but the fingers in his mouth made it rather difficult to speak.
Dean smiled softly when Cas returned, and even more when he put his head on his shoulder. He put one of his arms around him, keeping him close. He liked being like this with Cas, it made him happy while they were both calm. Dean felt like he could relax around Cas, and that was one of the things he really wanted, to just be able to relax around someone. He didn’t know what they were either, but he was honestly fine with that. For now at least. He was just enjoying Cas’s company.
Castiel was not expecting the smoke being blown into his mouth, making him sigh and groan softly.  He pulled away from the kiss when dean spoke, staring at him before narrowing his eyes slightly.  “No.”  He said softly.  “I’ll get into the backseat, but you,” he poked his chest.  “Get to take my clothes off.”  He smirked and kissed his lips before gently biting his bottom lip, walking away from him and climbing into the backseat, laying on his back and propping himself up with his elbows, waiting for dean to get in as well.
Dean rolled his eyes jokingly. “You really think I’m this deep person, huh?” He said back with a soft chuckle. “The only secret I have is that I watched tentacle porn once.” He said with a laugh. He then mad the motion of wiping his hands clean and sat back. “Not a secret anymore though, so I’m all clean.” He said with a smile
Castiel was panting softly, his hand against his heart as he caught his breath after dean pulled out.  He yawned and sighed to himself, looking at dean lazily.  “What’s your stance on cuddling?”  He mumbled, closing his eyes for a moment to relax.  He was exhausted, and now, since he was in a very different mind set, he wanted to cuddle.
Castiel watched dean and saw the focused expression on his face, smiling brightly.  He nodded approvingly, grabbing a small measuring spoon and some baking soda.  “Good job.”  He said softly.  “Now, add this,” he handed him the two things.  “Scoop, scrape, pour.”
Castiel unwillingly put deans dick in his mouth, gagging slightly but trying to relax his throat as much as he could.  He breathed through his nose softly and closed his eyes to focus, focusing on his teeth, what his tongue was doing and how far dean was going down his throat.  He /did not/ want to throw up in here.  He began moving his tongue around him, feeling drool go down his chin as he sucked slightly.  He forgot about his teeth, helping him keep them away from the sensitive skin as he continued to move.  He’d never admit this to anyone, probably not even himself but, this was /awesome/
Dean gave a quick look around and then walked into the living room, “this couch seems fine then.” He said, patting the arm rest that was on it. “Get on your knees and put your arms on the back of the couch. Oh and take your pants off.” He chuckled, pulling a condom out of his back pocket and setting it on the nearby coffee table
Castiel smiled a little, shrugging a bit.  “I think you’re pretty interesting.”  He smiled, grabbing his boxers off of the floor and slipping them on.  He shook his head, sighing softly.  “Just tell me whatever you’re comfortable with telling me.”  He didn’t want dean to feel forced to talk him, he just wanted to get to know him.  He patted the spot right beside him on the couch, telling dean to come sit next to him.  He leaned back against the couch and sighed softly, looking at him and holding his knees to his chest.
Dean slowly opened his eyes, for a split second not realizing where he was, though his memory soon came back to him. He nodded softly to Cas, still being half asleep and just complying to whatever he was saying. He yawned and stood up, following Cas to his room and honestly looking like the most innocent thing ever in his half sleep state
Dean laughed at Cas’s comparison, “what? You don’t want me to do your hair and put little butterfly clips in it?” He joked back. What Cas said sounded awesome, though. Spending most of his times it’s Cas, smoking and fucking sounded like a dream come true. “We’re gonna fuck til I can’t feel my dick anymore and you can’t walk.” He chuckled, still being a little high and just letting his thoughts pour from his mouth. “Bet you got a lotta places in that big ass house where we could fuck.”
Dean smiled at that, knowing Sam would love going to a fair since he’d never been to one. “That would be awesome, Sam would love it.” He said with a smile. As long as he was able to sneak Sam out of the house while John was drunk, there would be no problem going to the fair. And Dean wanted Sam to remember his childhood as going to the fair and doing fun things, not sneaking out and staying away from their dad
Castiel sighed deeply and walked to the couch, hesitating before pushing his clothes off from the waist down.  He had to keep thinking about what would happen if he didn’t do this, that he’d be kicked out and left broke on the street.  He had to think about that over and over again, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to do this.  He got into the position dean asked him to and closed his eyes, shivering at the cold air touching his bare skin.
Dean raised a brow at first in reaction to Cas’s comment, but he couldn’t help but he intrigued by him. He smiled and laughed softly, “what’s up with you? You just got the best fuck of your life so far and you’re already being an asshole again.” He said, though he truly didn’t sound angry. He pulled up his boxers and pants, getting himself put back together
Dean smiled when Cas thanked him for saying fine, though when he heard what Cas whispered, he couldn’t help but feel a shiver run down his spine. His eyes looked a little wider, but he smirked. “So you think you’re the one in charge, hm?” He purred, liking what Cas was doing, but not willing to submit to anyone without a little bit of a fight, or teasing. “You’ve got balls.. but I don’t think you’re exactly the.. dominant type.” He chuckled
Dean rolled his eyes, a playful expression still on his face though. “I did, but that’s just to fix your small comfort zone issue. Once you get over that and you feel like fucking whenever, then I won’t have to.. say those things. But I know you like to, so why stay mad at me? We could do this as much as we want, and it’s not as much fun if you’re angry the whole time.”
Castiel snorted and scoffed.  “Yeah, when you had me pinned up against the wall.”  He laughed.  “And not to mention, you were already kissing and touching me before you even asked.”  He rolled his eyes.  He glanced back at dean and saw his pout, smiling and shaking his head.  “Aw, did baby green forget that there are consequences to his actions?”  He smirked and cocked an eyebrow, putting the dishes onto the drying rack, keeping eye contact with dean.
Dean moaned deeply when he felt Cas’s nails on his back, loving the light sting of it. He stayed at a slower pace for a little while, allowing Cas to get used to the feeling again before starting to speed up. He held Cas’s hip with one hand, making it easier for him to thrust into him deeper and faster. “Fuck..” he breathed, “you feel fucking good..” he said, his finger tips slowly starting to press into Cas’s skin enough to leave bruises
. That is, until one lousy, impatient brother blasts through the door, waking him from his soothing, meditating trance.
Further down the tapered, lower floor corridor are two more rooms fashioned for Balthazar and Anna. They are a little smaller than that of Michael and Uriel’s but superior because no other building is obstructing the afternoon light as it comes in through the significantly larger windows. The two siblings walk into their allocated terrain, but not before taking a moment to say their goodbyes. Balthazar being the idiot that he is, walks up to Gabriel at the door frame and salutes a “so long, partner” like he is going off to war. Behind them, a low tired voice mutters “save your remarks for the real deal.” Gabriel, ever the comedian, wipes fake tears from his cheeks.
When Castiel’s mother had passed away, the young boy had suffered through his grief by becoming a little less talkative, unenthusiastic and hung out in his room all day. He still acted normal and relieved all his worries on Anna and Gabriel and they are still close to this day, but her death changed his life forever. He had silently suffered like that for two years, spending his early teen years in a state of perpetual frustration; Chuck never really knowing what to do or how to handle it. He eventually agreed to getting help from the outside like this was some sort of serious matter, but he did physically and mentally improve, happy to return to his family and finally feel well again. He is sure that the rest of his siblings had suffered equally horribly, but he guesses that as the youngest to have understood the situation to its greatest scale, it just showed the most visibly. He admits that he is still somewhat affected by the death now, but he is better now, has moved past it, and is living a stress-free life right now. Well, as stress-free as it gets with the upcoming war that his father had voluntarily thrown them into.
“Hey, don’t you want to find out at least a bit about who we are going to be dealing with for the next few months?”
“At least someone is, and you’re too young for far distance travels, so it doesn’t take a genius to figure out the rest. Obviously nothing is official yet, but I just have this nagging feeling that my time has come.”
“May I present His Royal Highness Chuck Novak and his seven children,” booms the loud voice of the herald, officially confirming that all of Dean’s nightmares are becoming reality. Dread engulfs his numb, throbbing body as the Winchesters witness each Novak steadily climb out from the grand, colossal chariot emblazoned with sparks of lustrous gold which catch the light with the slightest movement.
“Looks like I’ve got competition,” Prince Dean says in a light-hearted tone, “you can prove yourself to me someday, if you like.”
The atmosphere around them comes to an abrupt halt as Sam and Cas share a look of confusion. The lighthearted tone is gone instantly and instead the air is laced with awkwardness.
“Trickster? Mischief? That doesn’t explain what you’re doing behind a curtain, Prince Gabriel. I don’t even know you that well, my prince, but don’t you have other duties to attend to?”
If the two siblings are scared that they are going to receive harsh consequences they are truly mistaken. How bad can it be? At most they might get strict word from his father but nothing major that they should seriously worry about, so why is there a twisting, nauseous feeling in the pit of his stomach that this is a problem on a whole other scale as he takes in the mirrored fright in each pair of blue eyes.
“We are to greet them at the inner gate. I don’t want them parading around the throne room without clean shoes, so you better hurry up and get outside in five minutes.” Without waiting for a reply, John walks away briskly, strides purposeful as his cape cascades behind him in waves.
All appetite is lost when the merry pair plonks down at their end of table, much closer than any of them wish for. The remainder of breakfast is spent in complete silence, save for the giggling whispers of the new happy couple amongst the royal table. More than once he has to restrain Anna from launching the tightly clutched knife in her palms into the prince’s throat but he can’t blame her. With every passing minute he has to listen to that sickeningly sweet talk, he feels bile rise up the barricades of his throat no matter how many times he tries to swallow it down. He doesn’t want to make it obvious how much he hates it here right now... and the worst part? He doesn’t even know why. They are not at blame here, and even though he wants to curse Dean for what he implied that day, he cannot be at fault. Maybe it’s just him and Anna who are acting childish in this situation right now? Its funny how looking at this from a different perspective allows one to perceive one’s own wrong doings.
“Well, that’s my queue to leave,” says Balthazar standing up and at the same time draining his glass at once. He skips off and disappears into the crowd, probably trying to find some poor girl to hit on, or guy for that matter. Castiel just prays that the Edenish will not be as foolish to fall for Balthazar’s antics.
Castiel wasn’t quite sure, but it almost looked like Dean’s eyes dimmed, immediately losing their brightness as rejection caught them before they bursted out of their sockets with hope, almost as if Dean didn’t want him to go, but then again, it was probably a trick of the light. Without another word, Castiel bode the fellow princes farewell and wished them a peaceful night of rest. When he leaves their presence, he feels empty, like he left a part of him behind in the process. It brings about an ache in his chest and he longs to go back there, to get to know these people properly, the men he will soon be fighting alongside. Because that’s what this truly is, right? Two kings penning a flock of men in one barn, readying them for slaughter on the battlefield. As much as Castiel wishes this not to be true, he knows he can’t deny it. That is why he knows he shouldn’t be getting carried away with some stupid celebration, a pretentious parade of toasts to a better life, when in full spectrum, they are just cheering on the execution of their own heads.
The other stress-free aspect of his life is that people tend to leave him alone. You can look at it one way or the other, but Castiel gladly takes it as an advantage. Even though he is healed and the doctors claim him to be completely normal, others are in outright disbelief that this could be possible. Because how could the boy born to the womb of a mentally crazy woman ever truly be normal again, especially since he broadcasted his episode to the world?
Sam gestures to the empty seat beside him that was previously taken by Sir Singer, who is currently preoccupied in a game of experimentation of how many flagons of wine the human body can hold. He seems very determined on winning and sharing his findings.
Next door lives Uriel. The servants look like they have already fashioned his space with those ugly curtains and matching sheets that he insists on bringing with him everywhere. Castiel feels a wrong, hideously seething joy from seeing his brother assigned such a sad, gloomy place. He also doesn’t seem to be the only one, because from the uninterested, bored look Prince Dean wears upon Uriel’s depart, it is clear they share the same opinion.
“No. As a matter of fact I fully believe you to be fully capable of holding and swinging your own sword, if any of the stories are even half true. I am no fool, Dean.”
“Where do you get off threatening me?” Cas had asked, fury afire in his blue eyes. “Maybe you were the tough guy back…wherever you came from, but that’s not gonna fly around here. I don’t know what your damage is, Dean Winchester, but for a new kid, you’ve sure got a lot of issues. Every day you’re either flipping everyone off or throwing temper tantrums, and if everyone else is okay with that, fine. But you will
“But Anna, last month when I asked you if Dad knew you were working, you said – …so you lied to me? Why didn’t you just tell me that? I could have… Anna, come on, I wouldn’t have freaked I just – well yes, because you shouldn’t be home alone! You’re only 17 and you still need superv- … Okay whatever, can you get a hold of Dad now?” Dean heard Cas sigh then, and opened one eyes to see Cas let his head fall into his hand as he moved his legs up to rest his elbows on his knees.
A perky redhead stepped into the hall. She wore a zebra print skirt, and polka-dotted button up top, and plain black heels. In her hand was a blue pen with a smurf bouncing from the top of it.
again, and Dean is trying to figure out what the hell is happening when the doors to the gym open and Sam walks in.
Although Cas hadn’t contacted Dean for the past eight months, he didn’t forget their last conversation. Hypervigilance became a priority for Cas. He used a fake name and made up a sob story about why he didn’t have any identification, or money, or memory of what had happened to him. To his surprise, people actually bought it. If a few people began to get suspicious, though, or if Cas got word of angel activity nearby, he would disappear, moving on to whatever town that was at least four hours away.
a red and blue plaid flannel, and a gray zip-up sweatshirt. Dean squinted for a second before smiling.
“Cas is gonna wake up, Dean,” he’d said confidently. “But you need to be a functioning human being when he does.”
"Hey, Red," he says, squeezing her in a hug before leading them into the mall. All of the storefronts they walk by announce sales and discounts. "Ready to help me find something for your brother?"
Dean is livid. Cas knew he would be the second he decided to jump in front of him as a demon headed straight for them. He wasn’t sure he’d survive long enough to endure Dean’s rath, low on his grace and fading fast, but somehow, they survived. Now, here they are, back in the Impala, bloody and bruised, but alive. Cas’s hands twitch with the urge to heal Dean’s wounds, but he thinks that maybe now is not the best time. Dean would only scold him for wasting what’s left of his power.
He is more than satisfied with his partners, but he always thought he could maybe use just one more.
final exam sitting on the desk in front of him, and for the life of him, he couldn’t focus. He looked up at the clock for the fifth time to find that another ten minutes had already passed. It was a two hour exam, and Cas had wasted half an hour arguing with himself over whether or not he should go with Dean. The worst part was, he was choosing between two perfectly acceptable courses of action – go to his own graduation, or go to his best friend’s brother’s funeral.
“– my family moves around a lot. Haven’t even moved in yet, actually.” Dean chuckled. “Kinda hopin’ to stick around for a while, though. The girls are smokin’.” He winked at the blond in the front row, making her blush furiously. Castiel wasn’t sure if she had fallen for Dean’s bad boy looks or his southern drawl, but made a face that said
Cas strolls in, sans trench coat or tie, just black slacks and a white button down with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Dean has to physically rip his eyes away. If Sam notices, he’s smart enough to keep his mouth shut.
Thank you so much for being so patient! It's a little short, but I hope you enjoy the chapter, lovelies! <3
Dean sighed, realizing how exhausted he was. Maybe now, finally, he’d actually be able to sleep at night.
Desperate to change the subject, he cleared his throat and put out his hand. “Well, Dean, it’s nice to meet you.”
It felt like an eternity passed before Cas finally opened his eyes and his breathing returned to normal. A tear or two slipped down his cheeks, and Dean used the back of his fingers to brush them away.
Pulling open the door as quietly as possible, Castiel stepped out of his room and towards the living area, where he found Dean curled up on the couch, Castiel’s blanket discarded on the floor. Dean was a moderately heavy sleeper, but he could always sense when people were around, so Cas wasn’t too surprised when Dean started moving around after a couple minutes.
he’s having, feelings he doesn’t want but can’t seem to get rid of, and Cas isn’t moving. Instead of getting off of him, Cas is
Dean keeps his eyes on the road as they make their way back to a nearby motel for the night. He’s got a knuckle-white grip in the steering wheel, and his breathing is still heavy from the fight. Cas isn’t sure what to say to fix things, so he tells the truth.
Castiel was at an impasse, to say the least. Graduation was a big deal. His mother was expecting pictures, and his brothers were planning a party of sorts. He had already begged his family
“Look, I know it’s not really any of my business, but you’re my brother’s soul mate, so you’re kind of like family now, anyway. I want him to be happy, but he won’t be happy if you’re not alright. From what Gabe has told me, you’ve been through a lot.”
Castiel heard several gasps, including his own. Crowley only raised a brow, and said nothing. Dean took that as an opportunity.
like a mantra in his mind, hoping beyond hope that Cas would feel it somehow, that he would sense the love that Dean couldn’t speak in words.
Dean moved to a sitting position, resting his back against the head board of the bed. He felt as if he’d slept all night, but he figured it was because he wasn’t worrying too much about Cas anymore now that he was back. Suddenly, Dean remembered the list Dr. Henricksen had given him before releasing Cas into his care. His jacket had somehow found its way to the floor and Dean reached for it, flipping it over and digging through the pockets. When he found what he was looking for, he pulled it out and tossed the jacket onto his bed. The list was a bit extensive, and had a couple prescriptions stapled to the corner of it.
“I won’t be!” Dean yelled as he bolted out of the front door, looking both ways before jogging across the street to his Impala.
"It’s… it’s too much, isn’t it," Cas is frowning now, and Dean realizes that he must have looked disappointed.
Castiel turned his head to look at Dean, only to find him fast asleep. How long had they been sitting there? Had Cas fallen asleep as well? He looked at their hands again, how his pale skin contrasted with Dean’s tan, freckled complexion, and tightened his grip. They wouldn’t talk about this, that much Cas knew, so he decided that he might as well enjoy the comfort while it lasted.
Dean reminds himself again – is defenseless, vulnerable, and naïve to human culture.  “This guy, did he…hurt you? Touch you?”
The weekend had flown by, since he had spent most of his time mother-henning Cas. Well, either that or making out with him,
“Of course, sir, right away,” Cas says quickly, then zips out of the office and heads straight to the office kitchen, where he immediately pulls out his phone to text Meg while he starts up the coffee machine and pulls a water bottle form the fridge.
“What are you, my mom?” Dean scoffs, walking further into the room, “Just uh, wanted to check on you, is all.”
“You will,” Dean nodded. He bit his lip. Three words were caught in his throat, threatening to come up like word vomit if he stood still any longer.
On Tuesday’s, he sees Amara Darke, a principle at one of the local high schools. Dean was making a speech at the school, talking about how important it is to stay in school and blah blah blah. He must have impressed her, because she called his office the next day and asked him out to dinner. She’s a dominant herself, but lets him take the lead when they’re together, so he gladly keeps her around.
Ketch clears his throat, takes a sip of his water. “Yes, especially when I did not have one when I came in this morning.”
“Sorry,” Castiel whispered, quickly reaching for Dean’s hands and holding them in his own. He frowned at the bruised skin on Dean’s right knuckle and kissed it. “I’m sorry,” he said again, looking back up at Dean, “Something seems to be wrong with me.”
“One problem at a time, Dean,” Cas said, leaning on the top of the passenger door. “You worry too much.” He slipped inside of the vehicle, pulling the door closed himself.
He spun around quickly, looking over his shoulder, and gasped. Two large wings, one on each side of his back, were drawn into his skin. Castiel stared blankly at the mirror.
“Yes, Mister Mayor?” Cas calls from the door, taking a tentative step inside, hands behind his back like he’s waiting for orders.
okay? Don’t beat yourself up over this, or else I’ll be forced to kiss you every time you look even the least built guilty.”
Dean had to laugh. He was so glad that his boyfriend and his brother got along so well. He wouldn’t have been able to choose between them if they didn’t. On a whim, he spun Cas around and kissed his lips. Cas made a sound of surprise before melting underneath Dean’s mouth, curling one hand around his neck. Dean smiled and pulled Cas closer by his hips. After hearing a few annoyed grunts as well as soft “aww’s” from fellow students, Cas peeled away from Dean and took his hand.
Castiel had grabbed Dean by the shoulder and shoved him up against the lockers, making a sound so loud, the students around them hushed and stared.
Dean shook his head. “I know, I’m a horrible person, but the truth is… I think… I do love him.” Again, Sam raised a brow. “Okay, okay, I
was the best solution?” Dean asks, incredulous. “Why didn’t you just toss me your angel blade? Come on, man, how could you be so stupid!”
