“Of course. I’ll get a couple of steaks. Please tell my adorable Nephie that I look forward to seeing him and his friend within an hour.”
“Dean must be a really good cook. I like these hash browns,” says Jeremy. “Oh Cas, before I forget, I wanted to tell you that the cookies were great. You’re a decorating pro. You should have a YouTube show.”
“Have you not watched the Hallmark Channel lately? For most Christmas movies, there’s always at least one mysterious character who’s really Santa, or an angel, or an elf. You guys are just a little ahead of the curve.”
“One of Ajay’s shot glasses. I can replace it at the bookstore. I’ll clean it up myself. Just, later, ok?” Jeremy’s looking for his ball.
“There’s so much that’s changed! We should wait for Rowena so you and your dads can hear everything at once. But the reason is that things are as safe as a universe with free will can get. Team god gave up omniscience. They still see all the possibilities, just not the end. It’s like a weather forecast. We shouldn’t have threats from cosmic beings for at least a hundred years. Ghosts and witches should be as bad as it gets, so instead of being a guardian on high alert in heaven, I can be a mom with you on earth.”
Dean is sitting at the barstools instead of behind the kitchen island for once. He’s drinking some orange juice, like Cas suggested. Miracle chews a toy underneath his seat.
“I think that tube caught some serious air a few times. So what did you think, Jack? Was it like flying?” asks Jeremy.
Jack walks into the room with Miracle and just catches one of Jeremy’s dramatic annoyed groans, so he asks,“What’s wrong?”
“Speaking of our dog,” Dean says as he looks at Miracle lying on his back on the bath mat, “I thought that after dinner, we’d have the boys keep him in their room overnight.”
They do all the corny poses they can think of, including a dumb perspective pic with Jack holding Miracle, and Dean somehow getting the dog to lick so it looks like he’s licking wheat Jesus’ face — or maybe eating it. Given that Jeremy’s found out they all believe in angels, it seems odd to him that they don’t find this sacrilegious. Also, they’re not really at the best angle for any of this, but hopefully they’ll like the results. A few more family shots and finally they’re done. He packs up and sees Dean walking over. “Ok, your turn, kid.”
The WIP that was supposed to be my first multi-chapter has called me back, and I'm now working on it, too.
Everyone switches seats, and Claire pretends to get offended at Dean stealing Cas and the love seat, and she and Kaia go join Jody and Donna. Patience and Alex try out the futon mattress on the floor with the Tsum Tsums. Charlie puts on Rudolf and leads everyone in saying, “deviance from the norm will be punished” at appropriate times. Dean cheers “Yay, gay dentist”which both amuses and annoys Cas, because he’s not sure that it isn’t inappropriate. Finally Charlie yells “deviance from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable.”
“So do you two think you’ll be able to get enough to eat?” Cas asks as he sits at the large table they picked.
“Kristen Stewart should dump her ass,” says Jeremy. “I get her not being out, but lying to Kristen that she was, and then asking her to pretend to be something she isn’t — it’s too much.”
Alex smiles, “That’s for you to hang on to for next year, in case you get invited to an ugly sweater party.”
Cas says, “You might consider fixing up the house while you have time for a project — maybe start with something small?”
“Thank you for coming,” says Charlie, giving Kelly a hug then motioning her in. “Do you remember my mom Gertrude — she goes by Gertie?”
“That concludes my presentation for now. I will take further questions over a whiskey later.” Cas, Jack, Claire and Sam give brief polite clapping. This time Dean yells “suck up” to Claire who throws a donut hole at him, which he catches in his hand and pops in his mouth.
“…so if you’re ever in serious trouble — not like grades, but life and death, like a car accident — pray. You can pray to the archangel Gabriel.”
Cas nods and offers a hand to Gertie, who accepts it to get out of the squashy couch, but then steps aside to wait for Charlie. Cas pauses a minute, than offers the leash to Gertie, who seems honored. Miracle looks up at Gertie waiting for permission to walk. They follow Eileen across to the foyer.
Cas walks toward him slowly until their noses are almost touching. In that quiet dangerous interrogating voice that Cas can call upon, he says “So you’re saying that not only will it be quiet and non-distracting, if we should make some noise, we wouldn’t disturb anyone.”
Since Jody’s household hasn’t seen Charlie in a long time, she’s been commandeered for a while, but when she gets free, she finds Jeremy. “Hey kiddo, my mom sent you this. She says there’s a note.” She passes over a brown paper lunch bag, and Jeremy pulls out the note:
“She normally doesn’t want to meet anyone, but she likes to tell me what color people are on the inside — I mean made up colors,” the woman blushes apparently wondering if that came out offensive or weird or both.
“The Ball of Twine was east of where we hit 70, and since we were heading to Denver we missed that one.”
“Fair enough,” says Mel, sliding next to Sam. “By that logic, Kelly has to come sit by Nat and the akvavit bottle. It’s a drink-with-dinner thing.” Eileen sits on the other side of Sam, and Jody sits next to Eileen.
“It feels like a long time ago. It wasn’t really, but we’re both… different. It was… really bad, but don’t think anything like it will ever happen again. We’ve talked about it. We have a friend Mia who is a counselor. We talked with her. I can still talk to her if I feel like it.”
Kelly produces a small handheld vacuum from nowhere and takes care of the popcorn, telling everyone she used her “mom powers.”
“I won’t say no to your cooking, but no cleaning up from you guys,” answers Dean. “Anyway, no cooking for anyone tonight. When our missing Queens get home, they’re bringing pizza and wings.”
Sam decides to accompany Gadreel on his people watching. It’s not clear whether Sam thinks someone needs to keep an eye on him, or if Sam wants to have a talk, but they head out to the restaurants and lodges in the village.
“Thanks for letting me come along with you guys,” says Jeremy obliging Dean with a polite if somewhat uncertain handshake.
Sam calls for everyone to have a break, and most people scoot for the kitchen. Jack and Claire decide it’s time to move on to the cheese balls.
“Thanks Dad,” chirps Jack with a big smile. Dean stares a bit. Usually Jacks says Dads referring to them in plural, or he calls Cas Dad, but that Dad and smile was just for him, so he feels a bit stunned.
“Wait a minute, says Dean. “How far is it? Do we have to go into the lodge to get keys, or do you have them?”
“Maybe you two need a rest in your room,” Dean says with an eyebrow wiggle directed to Jody and Donna.
Cas shakes his head in a no motion, but doesn’t say anything. Instead he puts an arm around Jeremy and gives him a sideways hug in the hallway, which is really awkward when two people are sitting on the floor. Nevertheless, Jeremy welcomes it and can’t help a guilty wish that his dad were a little more like Cas. Soon after, Dean comes out of the bedroom and into the hall looking awkward and rubbing his neck. Cas immediately says, “I think we should switch places,” and goes in to see Jack. That leaves Dean to walk forward and sit down to join Jeremy.
The kitchen flows into a large dining room, with two matching long tables, which flows into a foyer near the oversized front door. To one side is the living room where the high panel of windows is. There’s a TV above the fireplace, and a mix of squashy old furniture and a new sectional. “How much you wanna bet that they bought this to replace the old stuff, found out it wasn’t comfortable, and just left it all together,” comments Dean patting the back of the sectional.
red head Queen, Handmaiden.” says Charlie walking in. She goes to Jack first with a squeal and a hug. “I’m so glad you suggested I drop by.” She plants a big kiss on Jack’s cheek leaving a red mark. “Oh my god, what have I done! I always hated it when my relatives did that to me. I must be getting old. Sorry, Jack.”
“Sure. Just another reminder that John didn’t know his father cared about him. John winds up becoming an abusive dick, uses your college fund to buy ammo, and tells me to kill you if you get dangerous. Then we have a sweet kid who I wanted to use as a bomb, but that’s ok because he survived, we got him to college, and now he has a trust fund.” Dean gets up.
“Jody and Sam think it’s a good idea. Masters degree nurses get paid a lot more, and I could specialize. I just don’t know how much college I can stand before I go crazy.”
Sam leads them to the living room where Jody and Donna are simply themselves, but perhaps Rowena goes for being more gently welcoming than usual, and Charlie tries to be low key.
Alex and Jeremy also note the effect the movie has had on Claire, Charlie, and Dean, and soften their expressions. Alex says, “I guess you and I have high expectations.”
As many times as he’s crossed the midwest on I-70 Dean knows about the wheat Jesus billboard, and the enormous ball of twine that they — thankfully — won’t be passing, but it still takes him by surprise. Considering Jack was temporarily God, having an interest in wheat Jesus seems odd, but apparently Jack is now into kitschy tourist things.
“Sometimes I am,” says Alex with a smile. “I guess it’s different kinds of strengths. Being smart enough to know how you — or anyone —
“So, do we figure they’re all going to bond over manual labor,” asks Charlie with a smile reaching for her coffee.
“He said that since Sam is taken he wants to be a Novak. He’s supposed to be my older brother now in any cover story.”
“Yeah, you deserve that. At Thanksgiving, my parents were saying, we’re always going to be family. They’ve been trying to break it to me all Fall, but I wouldn’t believe it. Then when I was on the phone with Dad talking about finishing finals, it felt like he was hiding something. He’s no good at keeping secrets. He wants to transfer to a different job and he’d have to move out by a certain time. It was like the divorce was going to be real, and I blamed him. I said I didn’t want to go home. It hurt him, but it’s true. I just don’t feel like I can handle being home with them yet.”
“Now nephie the utility kilts you can wear whenever, but that black kilt is formal, so keep it nice.”
I've decided that I'm going to stick with these guys to narrative Christmas. We're roughly 2 weeks away in the story, and so at this rate, I'm thinking I might finish with Christmas in May. It may have 5-6 more chapters, but I'm leaving it a question mark so far.
Jack come in with Miracle on a leash, so he knows he needs to be on good behavior. Miracle sits politely with one ear lifted through Charlie’s introduction of the late-comers. Gertie asks to pet Miracle and he goes placidly. When Gertie comments on how nice he smells, Sam gets a suspicious look.
“C’mere wiggly,” says Dean softly. Cas has already changed from being on his back, to big spoon, to little spoon in about ten minutes, which means Cas going back to sleep is hopeless, but he doesn’t want to start getting up. Dean pulls Cas to his chest for a cuddle and closes his eyes. Dean is surprised when he opens his eyes again, and the room is a little brighter and Cas is on his side looking at him.
Dean stands, too. “Thank you. Now get over here. Hey, kiddo.” He reaches out and hugs Jack and then Charlie. “You, too, J. I’m huggy in my old age.” Jeremy goes over without protest.
“Look Dean, you don’t have to freak out about it. We’re not going to be millionaires. No one is. I say trust fund and it sounds like a lot of money, but it’s for who we designate and it’s just housing and education. It’s not just Jack. Claire and Kaia haven’t figured out what they want to do yet, and once Patience gets her undergraduate degree, she’ll have medical school. We can make it easier on Alex getting her nursing degree. We can include Kevin if he’ll take anything from us.
Everyone gets ready to walk to their next stop, and Cas flaps a flyer with a picture of the Big Blue Bear at Dean and Charlie, before folding it to put in his back pocket. Dean shakes his head with smile, while Charlie, gives a big wink and goes to whisper to Cas.
“Ok, I found the switch to shut off the vents. Thanks!” yells Kelly, turning off the hot air to the back row, and maybe making it a little cooler with her own methods.
Kelly shakes the container of whipped cream, and turns to Sam and Eileen, “So are they always like that?”
After an excellent dinner with Dean’s meatloaf and Jody and Donna’s sides, they make their way to the rec room. Jody, Donna, Patience and Alex nab one sofa. Claire and Kaia grab a loveseat. Dean, Cas, Jack, and Jeremy have the other sofa, while Charlie and Kelly are in recliners. Charlie’s recliner has a drink holder on one side and a remote holder on the other, and she clearly is treating it like a captain’s command chair. There are also futon mattresses and blankets at the ready for when people start moving to the floor. Dean gives Miracle his puzzle toy in case he doesn’t get enough attention and gets bored, and Miracle takes it under the pool table. Charlie starts the rom-com and everyone settles in.
Characters have memories of people and events mentioned in past seasons: Henry Winchester and Abbadon, John Winchester's infamous quote about Sam's college fund from ep 1.20. Forecast calls for light angst this chapter and next, to be followed by fluffier content.
Jack goes off to hug a new person, and Jeremy’s mouth might be open, because a different girl with long, wavy dark hair is staring at him with a concerned look on her face.
“Sweetheart, if you’re happy, then everything’s good. C’mere.” Dean opens his arms. Cas goes to him, and somehow Dean manages to pull them into one of the bunker’s club chairs with Cas on his lap.
“Don’t eyebrow me if you want me to make polite conversation with the kids,” returns Dean with a flirty smile. Cas leans in and they share a kiss, and then they both back up, Cas turning to wave at Jack. Dean looks down at Miracle inside the fence, “Ya ready?” As if in answer Miracle turns around in a circle. Dean opens the fence again and he jumps into Dean’s arms, with Dean having to wiggle a bit to hold him. “You’re gonna need a longer work out. You’re getting too used to getting carried,” Dean says to Miracle who just squirms around and licks his face. Being the best husband in the universe, Cas doesn’t point out that Dean could just stop holding him. Miracle is an average-sized dog, but Dean often carries him around as if he were a teacup poodle.
Charlie laughs, “At least we’ve been texting. There used to be times when we’d all just drop off the map.”
“Oh!” Jack turns around from the foyer to face where Sam and Eileen are standing together. “Sam, do you have something I could put in my hair to make it neater?” Since he might be a little far for lip reading, and doesn’t know the ASL for it, Jack points to Sam and mimes putting something on his hands and brushing his hair with his palms.
“Dean Winchester, your lines are terrible. I’m getting out of here to sit with the boys. Maybe you should take a cold shower.” He makes a show of holding up the coffee and putting it on the nightstand so Dean knows where it is and he grabs a key card. Dean realizes that Miracle hasn’t hopped up asking for bacon. “Speaking of Miracles…?”
“Yeah, that’s fine,” he says quickly looking at Cas for confirmation. Cas simply looks relived that he didn’t have to frantically signal Dean with his eyes to say yes.
Cas hums. “There are benefits to being flexible.” He raises an eyebrow and gives Dean a pointed look.
They hug again, and Cas remains quiet, letting them have this moment. Kelly and Jack part and look up. Kelly says to both Jack and Cas, “You can pray to me if you need anything, and I’ll always be able to come now. If ever I don’t come, pray to Gabe because something’s wrong. Cas, that goes for Dean and Sam and the rest of the family, too.”
Jeremy scrunches his forehead up a little at that one, and glances over to Cas and Jack who are trying to signal, “Don’t ask.”
Jack, looking a bit like Cas, says, “I hope you’re not expecting him to be polite all the time. You do know he’s in parent mode?”
“At Illinois? Indiana? Anyway Ajay is the favorite son,” says Jeremy “and so he says, ‘no problem, mom, I’ll do it for you’ and she’s all pleased about his sacrifice. Well, you can guess…”
Jody gives him a hug, too. “Donna said it all. We just didn’t get enough time, so you make sure we see you again. And you can always bother Alex and Patience at USD.”
Nevertheless, Jack starts off, saying, “Ajay’s mom thought that Asha, his older sister, needed to learn to cook traditional food, and she really didn’t want to. She finally made a deal that she would put 100% into learning how to cook…”
“I know Eileen got the whipped cream, but it looks like you and Cas robbed a Starbucks,”comments Sam. At Dean’s annoyed look Sam puts up his hands and adds, “Hey, I’m not complaining.”
“How come he gets to have Skittles as his color, but I can’t have a fish,” says Jeremy with a smile.
“My first swim coach always said that swimmers should have some weight bearing exercise. What would you think if I joined you sometime?”
Jeremy and Patience launch into a surprising number of funny stories about being in high school athletic teams, including pranks involving stuffing lockers full of ping pong balls, helicopter parents adjusting the position of competition livestream cameras, and dealing with long charter bus rides.
They zip through the happy faces and donuts so other people can use them, but take a little longer at the wall of hearts because Dean and Cas decide to goof off. Dean makes exaggerated heart eyes at Cas who pretends to be annoyed, holding Dean at arms length. Then Cas relents and Dean pulls him as if to dance, and they dance a bit and do a spin. Jack applauds, as do a few spectators, but then Jack tells them to do a serious one. They both roll their eyes and then stand about a foot apart facing each other, and they just look at each other. Jeremy only takes a couple pictures and then says that they should call it a day. There are other people waiting, so they head back the way they came.
Miracle is laying down on Jack’s lap, not minding him researching tourist spots with his phone just above. Jack pauses and rests a hand on Miracle who gives a squirm of protest, and then settles down again. Jack ignores some alerts and turns to Jeremy. “So what did you think of the Dads?”
Jeremy has a displeased look, a bit like the time when Jack started grilling everyone on the order of operations. He vaguely points at the direction of the stairwell, and says, “But if there was an emergency that woke you up after you’d gone to bed, you’d have to put on your shoes anyway.”
Sam cuts Cas off before he’s gotten his name out, with an enthusiastic “Hey Jeremy, we’re heard so much about you and we’re really glad you came.” He’s clasped Jeremy’s hand for a hearty shake.
Deans nods. “Look, Jack and I cried over it already, and right now he just needs a little normal college kid conversation. We should set up a Skype with Mia for Jack and me, and you and me need to talk with her, too — but for tonight — I’m sure Sammy. Let’s just do as normal as we get.”
Charlie says, “OMG. Are you guys not catching that Gabriel’s probably going to be down for Sam and Eileen’s wedding! You guys are gonna have an archangel at your wedding!” She’s gleeful.
“Not sure. Thankfully the boys never came down to tell us what they picked. Otherwise they would have heard the conversation.”
Patience considers. “I try not to read auras, because it would be too much information all the time if I were attuned to it, but I can do it.” She says, “Sit.”
“Understandable,” says Charlie keeping a curious ear on the conversation and glancing at Sam at one end of the table.
Kaia runs off, but the other two come over. The one with long straight dark hair and a black and white YOTES sweatshirt has a couple of fat Tsum Tsum-style pillows which she holds out to him and he takes without question. Adjusting his grip, he holds out a hand, “I can take something else.” She hands him a couple of canvas bags and a rolling suitcase and they walk to the house. “I’m Alex. This is Patience,”she says indicating the young woman with a backpack following in a red and black University of South Dakota sweatshirt.
“Hey, that was one of Donna’s donations to the pantry, so you can’t say anything,” says Dean giving Miracle one of his own treats.
“Oh, hang on and let me talk to Charlie,” Sam steps back and motions for Charlie. “Hey, it’s Rowena. She wanted to know if she should go ahead and come.”
“Solids are good ‘cause the backgrounds are going to be busy or have bright colors,”says Jeremy and for the first time on the trip he rolls his eyes at Jack’s parents. Dean smiles, pleased at the eye roll.
Donna seems amused for some reason, but just says, “You betcha. You tell your parents hello and thank you from alla us for letting you stay.”
“If you open it you’ll know,” Jeremy says with a smile. Jack goes ahead, and finds inside a pair of boot slippers. They pull on snugly and shouldn’t slip or slide.
A blonde woman leads them downstairs to a bedroom he vaguely remembers from the tour, and once he puts the pillows and bags down, she introduces herself with a hug.
Jeremy complies and they soon have whipped cream, candy canes, a shaker of cinnamon, marshmallows, bottles of chocolate and caramel syrup, and some mugs set out on the island counter.
So I learned a great deal, and I’m hoping the next thing I write will go smoother. I’m working on a season 13 fix-it fic. I won’t start posting until I’ve finished writing, because I hate not knowing how long something will take as much as a reader does. It will be more destiel-focused with a heavy load of Cas’ parental feelings. It will have a different Jack — not college-ready Jack, but just-born, kid-like Jack per 13.01.
Sam walks back to the living room and says, “Rowena’s coming in an hour, and she’s bringing dinner.”
“Yeah, of course. There’s no rush. Take another day if Jack and his friend want. Take two. Make sure
Arlette unsuccessfully stifles a chuckle, but gives an innocent enough face. “I’ll bring your drinks over in a minute.”
“Perhaps not such a long time. Well, I won’t be maudlin. Give us a hug, then.” Jeremy gives her a hug.
Jack and Jeremy gravitate to Cas’ conversation with Gertie, which moves from knitting — apparently Cas is learning — to books and movies. Gertie is thinking about volunteering to sort items at a library some evenings. Although it’s entirely behind the scenes without public interaction, she wants to know what young people are reading and watching. It turns into an opportunity to compare what everyone enjoys, and for Jack to talk about Baby Yoda.
Cas stops signing his conversation with Eileen, and raises an eyebrow but before he can say anything, Alex raises her hands defensively and says, “I was just joking to lighten things up. It’s not like we can talk about this, so no way to tease anyone,” she grumbles.
“I love you, Cas,” answers Dean with a big smile and sparkling green eyes. Cas leaves slowly closing the door with a loud click.
Jeremy has no idea what to say to that. His dad nods as if he’s spoken. He slides over to the awkward middle section and snaps his lap belt. Mel pulls the car out and heads for the road. Nat pats Jeremy’s hand. Jeremy gives his hand a squeeze, and Nat squeezes back with a small smile.
Charlie says, “We skipped the all the bedrooms except for Kelly’s. If I stay overnight for a sleepover I’ll probably take her top bunk. Nice job on the pool noodles, by the way.”
“Just some wondering about who will or won’t be at the reception. Do you think you’d be back from spring break in time to go that Saturday?”
As Dean walks in, he sees there’s a very professional looking young woman at the check in. She greets him (not too bubbly) and is ready to take his reservation information. As she confirms a king room and a double room, Dean turns on the charm. “The king is for me and my husband, and the double is for the kids.”
Dean announces to everyone, “My only request is for Mel to sit near Sam, ‘cause I only made one vegan main, and I want to sit it in front of them.”
Dean peers over the island to see that Miracle is in the middle of the kitchen, on his back with four legs sprawled out, snoring.
Dean yells from behind the kitchen island, “Rowena! Miracle’s been spoiled since you took him to Vail!”
Dean thinks it’s nice to be in the know before everyone comes to the house tonight, and he hears the stories getting repeated. Well, not everyone. It won’t be the enormous circus that came to their wedding, but it will be a big group of friends. Dean can’t help a big smile at the memory, and gets called out immediately.
Sam says, “use the side door by the garage, just in case,” since he knows that will be out of view of any windows.
Jeremy smiles much bigger this time, and nudges Jack with his shoulder, “See Jack?” He leans a bit more towards Dean. “I call them the Canada geese. I mean that as a compliment, because geese are scary and Canada’s intimidating af. There’s a reason there was a goose game, right? Anyway, I’m pretty sure Canada’s crew will rule the world someday.”
“Nice!” says Dean. He goes over and checks out the large pool table. “Felt’s in good shape and it looks level. Not bad.” There’s also a small microwave, mini-fridge, and wet bar on the shorter part of the L, with an open square of comfy furniture around a large flatscreen. “This is definitely a good movie night room, and I already promised at least one with Charlie.”
“We saved your gifts to open after dinner,” Jack says to Jeremy, pointing to boxes around Jody and Donna’s little tree.
Jack hands back the phone and gets his out. It seems to take less than a minutes before he says, “Check your account.”
“Got it,” says Dean. “Hey, why don’t you get the full tourist experience? Don’t just drive — join us on the mountain.”
“How about some pecan pie for Cas, and apple for me?” Arlette smiles, “Sure thing!” They’re left to their meal, and Dean does go ahead and help Cas out with his fries.
“I agree with the dumping, though,” says Alex. “When you’ve had my dating experiences you go for one strike and you’re out. And I don’t think the actors have enough chemistry to make me want them to stay together. Isn’t Aubry Plaza in this? She would have been a better girlfriend,” says Alex.
“…I know it’s supposed to be a big family holiday, but do you think Jeremy could come? It’s just that he had a big fight with his dad, and he’s sad and angry…”
Dean looks up into the rearview mirror to see the back seat. “So how are we doin’? You know…emotionally and all that,” he says.
“Yeah, that’s impossible,” Alex says. “I’ve been working in a hospital, and my go-to is calm and straightforward. I’d never manage dealing with so many people otherwise.”
“I live in a telenovela. You’re right I should have seen it coming. What did Gabriel say about it?” Dean asks.
She goes over to two young women who avert their eyes as soon as he looks over. He might be imagining things, but he thinks he hears the phrase, “in shock at least five minutes,” from someone.
“She said that no one could help but love a baby, and that I should have the feeling of being loved like that. She said my memories would come back when I was old enough to understand them. I wanted to do it, but I didn’t like the idea that I might grow up to be somebody different. I wanted to be me. I just wanted you to love me for me.” Jack’s voice has calmed, but tears are steadily rolling down his face.
Dean grabbed his hand and pulled him into the Roadhouse. As soon as they walked in, everyone started clapping. They stopped and looked around and saw so many faces: Ellen, Jo, Rufus, Aretha(?!), Bobby, Karen, Pamela, Ash, Einstein (?!), Charlie, Sam and Eileen and other Bobby and other Charlie — and was that
Kelly and Sam take Baby. Everyone will meet Jeremy’s parents for lunch. Dean, Cas and Jack will all go back with Kelly and Sam in Baby. It will be a full car on the trip back, but it’s only two hours or a little less, and Jack likes getting squished with his family.
The group also watches Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964). This version of Rudolf has been critically viewed in recent years as capitalist propaganda, a subversion of capitalist propaganda, and as gay subtext. By Charlie's voicing of the capitalist propaganda, she subverts it. Similarly, Dean is connecting to the subtext. As one piece in the NYT says about Rudolf, "its central conflict is the way people who are different are constantly shunned and humiliated."
“Jeremy King, it’s very good to meet you,” Rowena puts a hand out for a handshake and Jeremy suddenly feels like he’s been given a pop quiz. Even as part of him thinks he’s supposed to shake with a firm hand, he takes Rowena’s hand gently, and just holds it more than shakes it. He feels like he’s possibly failed for not bowing and kissing her hand, but he manages to say something.
Cas goes to get the door. Dean grabs clothes, but doesn’t rush to throw them on. He figures that whoever is out there can wait. It’s heaven dammit. He hears Cas say, “Hello Mary,” and pauses. No other hello is forthcoming from Cas, so he finishes getting ready.
“You shouldn’t get it again, I also repaired some nerve damage and helped out your receptors. It won’t change your thoughts, so if you’re having trouble with intrusive thoughts, you need to see someone Mia recommends.”
Dinner feels like everyone is ready to take a break from bigger emotions and dive into holiday small talk. Sam looks relieved that he’s not the only person willing to eat the vegetable lasagna, as both Cas and Jeremy share the pan with him, while Dean, Eileen and Jack pile the meat lasagna on their plates.
“That was nice of you to talk to her, too, Jeremy. We seem to attract a bit of weirdness. I guess we haven’t scared you off yet?”
After a little time, Cas smiles. “Do you remember hearing about ice sheets that have almost Swiss cheese-like holes making them melt faster?”
Jack has a triggering event relating to remembering Mary Winchester. Dean has a moment of anger. Mention of Amara and choices made in heaven.
There’s a whoosh sound, and Alex and Patience are in the kitchen. Everyone stands up as they run round the island. Alex announces, “Claire decked Jeremy for real, and he kicked her knee out! Snapped a PCL or LCL for sure.” Patience nods in agreement.
“That was all Jack and J. They found and picked out 3D shape patterns from four different sites, and I knew where to outsource the 3D printing to make it happen.”
“Oh, sure. Just including an ex-deity, an ex-angel, and a guy who’s retired from killing monsters. Yeah, I’m seeing more of a Halloween thing.
Charlie asks, “Dudes, you think there’ll be people from…down there, or upstairs at Sam’s ceremony or even at the reception?”
“Don’t bother. Besides, he can show off how strong he is,” Dean says, earning a raised eyebrow from Cas — which Dean doesn’t seem to mind in the slightest.
“I...  we have a friend coming, “ says Dean. Arlette nods and sets a paper place mat next to Dean, and lays cutlery on top of it. “You boys have questions about the specials?” They chat for a few minutes and Dean decides to order a burger and fries for Cas and a BBQ plate for himself, which for some reason makes Sam roll his eyes and say, “Uh huh” like it’s some wise pronouncement.
“Oh, don’t worry about it,” says Kelly. “There’s only one small bag and pool noodles, so I can grab it myself. Rowena and I went in together on Christmas gifts, so she’s bringing them.”
After that talk in the Impala, Jeremy’s a bit unnerved, but he promised Jack he’d take all the kitschy tourist photos he wanted, and it seemed the perfect way to get time using the DSLR, so he concentrates on setting up. It helps that Jack always seems able to change emotions quickly. There’s a trampled path and circle in the tall yellow grass where other tourists have stopped. He’s running around it letting Miracle chase and bark at him, with Dean jumping in to play-growl at Miracle occasionally, working the dog up to release his energy. Cas just watches them full of affection. Jeremy snatches a little of it in video mode, before yelling to Jack that he’s ready. Cas has Jack’s phone to take pictures on it, too.
“What are Queen Aunts for?” she says with a smile at Eileen and Rowena. “You’re pretty much adopted, so you have to deal with it.”
Dean, Sam and Jack come down and Jack is immediately surrounded by Kelly, Eileen, Cas and Charlie ready to gush over him. Even Gertie comes up and asks to inspect the design of the knitted sweater. Jeremy gives Jack a wave as a joke, since he’s half-hidden behind so many people.
Eventually, they decide it’s time to go back in. Dean and Cas clean up the s’mores, while Sam and Eileen take care of the fire pit. Jack helps Jeremy take his tripod and camera set up inside.
Alex says, “It’s not like we haven’t seen the albums everyone got. We’re prepared, so we won’t get all emo on you.”
Dean still isn’t quite sure how it happens, but he is sure there’s a happy ending once they get on the road again.
Cas nods and goes to scratch Jack’s lower back which gets a groan and a “Thanks, Dad,” and starts Jack toward alertness.
About that time they decide to clear out as other people are circling, but they’ve had a good ice breaker, and are ready to tackle some more rooms. As they walk, Dean notices one that’s entirely pink from the furniture to the walls.
“Yeah, I never liked the idea of telling people you’d been married to anyone but me, so I approve. But Jack’s trying to show his friend that everyone can be still be one big happy family. We’re the example, aren’t we?” Dean looks a bit uncomfortable at the idea, but Cas just smiles.
“I agree everyone needs warning, but they’re used to cover stories. You’d be surprised at how normal talking about our family can sound. Jack has a doting Aunt Amara whose work prevents her from joining us. Jack’s uncle Michael and your half-brother work with her and are inseparable.” He notes that Dean snorts a laugh at that comment, and with wry smile Cas continues, “I’ve been told we should refer to them as the Milligans.” Cas scores a look of surprise from Dean.
“This is perfect Rowena,” he says. Knowing how huggy people around here are he just goes ahead and reaches out, and gets a warm maternal hug and a stroke of his hair.
“Yeah, I figured you’ve got so much going on there that he shouldn’t count on it. Well, you know where everything is. I should clean off the coffee table — and DO NOT say let me help!”
Cas is most knowledgeable on angel gossip. Given the civil wars and multiple factions, only a dozen or so of the angels back from The Empty are restored to full powers and freedom in Heaven. All angels have their wings back, but most are limited to shared areas of heaven and the throne room during their Growing Period, as Jack calls it. Humans have plenty of other names for it, including: Being Grounded, Clipped Wings, Angel Probation, and Angel Quarantine. Most of the restored angels make regular but brief visits to their house to see Cas. Samandriel is one of Dean’s favorites; although, he’ll never admit it and refuses to call him anything but Alfie.
In this AU world, you'll see lots of names of people and beings who should be in Heaven, Hell or the Empty, who aren't where we left them. There's been a shuffle of location, and I hope to give some glimpses of how that happened in later chapters.
Arlette brings drinks and napkins and says, “Food will be out soon, so I’m going to warn you now — leave room for pie.”
Kelly speaks up, “Rowena, Patience hasn’t had a vision with monsters in some time. What can you tell us about that?
Dean gives the sisters and Jack a normal amount of Champagne, except for Kaia who asks for just enough for one toast.
Dean says, “Son of a bitch,” realizing that Miracle might eat too much buttered popcorn off the floor, and manages get him interested in a chew he’s been keeping in his pocket instead.
Jeremy adjusts some pillows and turns on his side to face Jack. “So instead of going to camp, you went actual camping with your Dads?”
Patience says sternly, “I’m not interpreting the family. You’ll have to go with your own impressions of people.”
“Thank you,” Jack says, taking the compliment for them. “Here’s a blue noodle. Mom got a bunch of Duck tape colors.”
“Sammy, I get you’re trying to make the Winchester name and the Men of Letters something good. I respect you for that, but I’m out and staying out of all the Winchester family crap. Cas, if you and Sam want to figure out something to do with Henry’s money, fine. I don’t want to make any decisions about it, not ever.” He stands up and runs a hand over his forehead and through his hair. “Look, I’m going to take a nap before dinner. Just yell at us when it’s ready,” he looks to Cas. “Unless you want to stay?”
Gadreel shakes his head no. “I confess I’m having difficulty stomaching reading the news, but I feel obligated.”
“I can’t tell you everything anyway, but I know they do love each other. They just aren’t in love romantically. They were never in love that way. There was this time when…I was… I was just with my mom, and we were away from Cas, and we weren’t expecting him. And he came in the house, and he was just so happy to see me that he laughed. And then he saw my mom, and I could see how much he cared about her. He thought he’d let her down but she said I was wonderful, so that meant Cas hadn’t let us down. Then she just hugged him. It meant a lot for me to see them together, but it’s not like him and Dean. It’s ok that my Mom lives far away, because through Cas and Dean and Sam, I have a really big family of amazing people. Most of my aunts and uncles aren’t really related to me. We have a saying that ‘Family don’t end in blood.’” Jack shrugs and smiles.
a big happy family: Sam and Eileen, Claire and Kaia, Jody and Donna, Alex, Patience, Charlie… and that’s just some of our Earth-side family. Kelly is making a special trip from heaven for Christmas and she’ll update us on our heaven-side family. When it’s time, we’ll see them again. I’m very happy Dean.”
Kaia doesn’t say anything about her age, but does say, “I try to stay away from anything that alters my mind and my emotions. I don’t need anything to make my bad place go away anymore. It’s gone.”
“Side pocket,” Jack calls with a wink. Then he quickly makes a double-ball jump shot, earning a few gasps and applause, but since he’s not being strategic, he loses on Claire’s next go.
“I promise to do my best to convince Jeremy to come with us. I have it blocked off and color coded in all my calendars, so even if he doesn’t, I’m not going to miss it.” Jack loves their little KU family meals. Katelyn, Cara, and Carmen are all so much fun, and really nice, Jack can’t imagine anyone not wanting to hang out with them.
“Dean, you should carry Miracle. The website says small dogs are allowed in, so if you carry him in, they’ll think he’s small,” says Jack
“I really should. She’s been traveling around with me on my work trips, but I’m a little selfish. I still want to keep my time with her to myself. And she likes to have some time on her own, too, so I don’t want to dump her into a situation with a lot of people.”
“You want me to grab a little of everything for you?” Jeremy asks. He seems a bit surprised at himself for the offer, but motions to Charlie’s plate.
“Tragic backstories,” says Patience wryly, as Alex gives her a side hug, and Kaia gives her a sympathetic look. Claire huffs thinking about Patience’s dad still alive and knowing where she is but not contacting her.
“M’am that’s a philosophy I can get behind” says Dean pulling out his most charming boyish smile, as she walks over and adjusts a phone plugged into a sound system.
Mel’s smiles very big, and says, “I hope to get to know Jack better. He has a natural joy and pleasure in every day life, and it seems like he must get that from, you.”
“Dearie, I’m bringing one of Kelly’s coworkers — on loan you might say. She won’t like that so you’ll have to tell her not to get her feathers ruffled.”
Dean shakes his head with watery eyes. Cas is going to feel all the emotions stirring in Dean through their bond. He’ll probably be pissed off that his husband isn’t happy in heaven, so he doesn’t envy Mary, but Cas is always forgiving and able to see the pain that others still carry, even in Heaven. Dean thinks that Cas will probably be better at helping Mary than he is.
“Keep Jeremy this week and see if he’s ready to go home in time for Christmas Eve. His parents are flexible. They’ll come pick him up, or get his car if that makes things simpler, arrange travel…They just want him to be safe, and not alone. I told them not to, but they sent me money for his expenses.”
“Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday,” lists off Jack as he pours some more orange juice from the table carafe. “I’m not running that long — a couple miles or 30 minutes. I don’t think I’ll want to run as much as Sam, but so far I like it.”
Then suddenly Jack wasn’t there, but Amara was. She smiled and said, “I’m happy for you Dean.” She gave him a kiss on the cheek, looked over at Cas with an even bigger smile and said, “I felt the bond you two have a long time ago. I just didn’t understand it right away.” She clasped their hands together and it felt like a blessing of sorts. Then she turned and both she and Jack were gone.
“Thanks, Jack. Good choice,” says Cas, heading to the stairs. Even with his hands full of damp dog, Dean manages a flirty-look and a wink signaling to Cas that he didn’t mind the wet t-shirt at all. Cas just rolls his eyes at his husband and continues up the stairs.
Everyone whooped and screamed. He heard a few shout “Kiss him!”, so he stood up and did so, passionately, as Cas returned the kiss with the same intensity. There was a dog’s bark, and then some laughter and then things got a bit more quiet. He and Cas parted and they turned. “Jack!” Without thinking that this was god, Dean gave him a hug, and so did Cas. Jack didn’t fight it and instead returned the hugs quickly saying, “It’s good to see you Dean. I thought that you might want these.”
“K, got it,” says Jeremy. There’s a pause, then he says, “Well go ahead and let’s get it over with.”
“He was pretty impressed with Kelly,” says Sam with a grin, thinking about the amount of akvavit consumed at the table.
“Carrot and stick. The carrot is that we know what’s going on and they don’t. There are artifacts and spells based on aspects of Chuck’s power that don’t work now, and their monitoring of the demonic shows zilch. They don’t understand and it’s driving them insane. Plus, there’s finding accounts, and then there’s finding out what they did with the money. That last part is the stick. Let’s just say that they don’t need any attention. That’s not how I wanted to handle it, but there’s no court system for suing amoral secret societies.”
“Love you Cas Dad,” she says, then she gives him a kiss on the cheek, and gets up and goes over to Kaia, and they leave to go to their room.
Jeremy realizes that he still hasn’t said anything, but that doesn’t make any words come out. Kaia tries again.
For the coloring book room, Jeremy quickly sets up the camera, adjusts the ring light, and tells Cas what to push on the DSLR. Dean hands them a couple oversized crayons for props, laughs at them, and takes some pics on Jack’s camera, too. He wisely doesn’t say that he’s laughing because Jeremy looks like a storm cloud and Jack looks like a beaming sun.
Kelly smiles, “Like may not be the right word. I find the idea that it passed the equator twice in a ship so interesting. I think about how each trip must be similar, but unique. Think of all the differences in humidity and pressure affecting oxidation and what you have in your glass. So many amazing small pieces. Lots of things are like that. I’m in awe of the gas bubbles in whipped cream holding things up to make shapes.”
Dean sighs and closes the laptop. “Yeah, we need to make sure nobody walks in talking about Jack’s archangel uncles, our werewolf godchildren, or any of the really crazy shit.”
Claire hugs Cas tight, and Kaia leans her head on Claire. Jack squeezes Kelly’s hand and then whispers something to her. She nods then whispers back.
Jack nods and gives her a lopsided smile. She gives him a little nudge, then they rack up. Claire shoots an excellent break, and goes on to win in her clean, efficient style. Everyone applauds.
“But not too much land and not too big a house. I don’t want us to have more than we can keep up with,” adds Cas.
Canada says, “Tell him I’ll be on good behavior — and Jack, you might have to frowny face him to get him to agree.”
“After we’ve been out in the snow, everyone’s gonna want all the heat plus the seat warmers,” Dean says in a loud grumble.
Sam makes sure all the responses are positive. Even though Claire looks significantly at Jack, expecting him to pull out a phone, he just smiles, has a cheese ball, and waits.
Dean is about to say something else when this time Kelly gives him gentler warning press on his foot from the other side, and Kelly glances at Dean, then Jack. Dean wonders if she’s sending angel communication vibes or if he’s getting better reading her, because he understands it to mean that since Jeremy is Jack’s friend, he should let Jack take the lead in responding. Dean glances at Sam who has a hint of a smirk on his face, guessing at the communication going on.
“Mary is a bad ass. She’s in heaven now. I’m looking forward to seeing her again, but it’s sad knowing that it’s my lifetime away.”
Sure enough, Miracle’s light fur makes a good contrast and gives the eye something to rest on. He seems quite happy to pose. Dean is won over, cooing at Miracle to get him to turn his head one way or another at Jeremy’s direction. Jack stands next to Jeremy duplicating some of the shots on Dean’s phone.
My unrealistic goal is to finish this by May 22. Will that happen? Not at the rate I'm going, but stay tuned.
Claire shoves her hip against one of the loveseats to move it closer to a sofa first, then goes to give Jeremy a half hug, half back slap. Claire and Kaia take the loveseat and the rest fill in the sofa.
When he joins them, he sees Mary on the couch with Miracle in her lap and Cas in the kitchen getting a pot of coffee going. He goes to sit next to her and give Miracle a pat. “Hey mom. I know we’re all still getting used to time in Heaven, but aren’t you here a bit early for our Game Night?”
Jeremy follows them back to the mudroom and discovers the intricacies of dog drying. They’re in there over half an hour when Sam comes poking his head in. Dean and Jeremy hold on to Miracle so he doesn’t zoom out the narrowly opened door.
“I think you can go ahead and bring me a to go box. There’s no way I’ll be able to finish all this.”
Jeremy, Patience and Alex come through the foyer into the living room with even Alex looking amused. Claire looks at Jeremy like he’s a completely suspicious character. Jeremy tries
“What would you say if I ride with you when you go pick up your parents. You know how Dean and Cas are, they’d be happy to follow in Baby, and Mom, too. We could say hi to them and then come back.”
Dean has a quick memory flash of Cas saying “The voice says I’m running out of minutes.” Just because he can, Dean gives Cas a quick but tender kiss that Cas returns sweet and loving before they slide out of the booth. As they leave, Cas grabs the pie and Dean gives their server an additional tip besides what’s on the table, and says, “For setting up the table for Miracle.” She nods a quick thanks and waves as they leave, needing to clear some dishes. He turns to Cas and says, “Let’s get this show on the road.”
“He’s committing to spending more time with his son, so he’s moving to Kansas in January to be closer.”
“Cas,” Kelly calls after a while, beckoning him over with a tilt of her head and a smile. Cas jogs over and she wraps him up in the hug along with Jack. He gives her a kiss on the forehead, like he used to when she was pregnant with Jack, then stands back to look at her, but now that he’s human, he can’t see a form to her grace. “It’s good to see you, dear friend.”
From the opposite end, Mel loudly and cheerfully says, “Don’t worry, I’ll be driving — but he doesn’t get affected by alcohol easily. And he’s not a big drinker year round, just a weirdo who feels like he needs to consume akvavit at every opportunity around Christmas.”
“No, I’m good. I’ll need to go up to my own room at some point to see the boys’ pool noodle project. Maybe another time though, I do want to learn.”
“If you want to crash here, you can take Ajay’s bed. I know he won’t mind. He wants me try to get you to move in with us sophomore year anyway — that way we can ditch Kyle.”
Cas hears part of the conversation and tells Dean,“I was interested in different things as an angel.”
“I thought I could fix it. I thought that if I pushed him — me — the one who’d seen him be a leader and protect whole encampments, he’d realize something was wrong.”
Kelly shrugs, “I try to work the slow way anyhow. Everyday things are fascinating now that I have shrimp goggles. You know this whipped cream is a gas and a liquid, but we think of it as a solid because of the rigidity of the tiny bubbles? Sometimes I like to count the gas to liquid ratio for fun.”
“It was hard, but being a pie, I was able to wrap my head around it. I’d normally hard pass on store-bought crusts, but Kelly went and got them for me, and I didn’t want to make a mistake with vegan ingredients.” Dean sets down a lovely looking pot pie in front of Sam, then heads back to the kitchen.
Dean took another good look at Sam. “Did you have a good life, Sam? How long did you live after…I died? You don’t look any older.”
She puts Gertie’s contact info in and says, “She could probably adopt a few surrogate grandkids. Send her a pic with it on later.” Charlie winks and gets called back over to the sisters.
“Yes, they do. I feel I should say that his mom told me it’s an amicable divorce. She said that they were friends who decided to get married and raise a child together, and they’ll always be friends divorced or not.”
Canada asks, “What’s up with King?” King is Canada’s usual way to speak to and about Jeremy, mainly because it mildly irritates him. Jack thinks Canada’s true preferred method is to yell in a booming voice, “Yo, Kiiiinnnngggg,” so that she sounds like a drunk frat boy. It’s funny, but really irritates Jeremy, so Jack made Canada promise to keep that to once a semester, or a special occasion.
Cas looks thoughtful as he sees his own reflection in the bathroom mirror behind Dean, but he just nods.
“That sounds pretty deep,” says Jeremy. Alex rolls her eyes, Jeremy protests, “I’m serious. I hope I remember what you said.”
Although Cas and Dean suspect Rowena just wants to buy Jack all his clothes through his college career, everyone is willing to go with that plan.
She stifles a laugh, smiles and says, “Yeah, we wanted to meet you. I’ll get my sisters. Stay here.”
“Gadreel, thank you for the news, and… thank god,”says Cas getting up to help Dean grab things for the table. Gadreel nods and has a hint of a smile.
Both Jack and Jeremy look a little sad, but then Jack breaks into a soft smile. “Besides, I know we have an angel watching over us.” Jeremy looks surprised at that since Jack has never seemed religious, and even more surprised when Cas turns around and says seriously, “It’s true, but we should take precautions anyway.” Dean just chuckles and says, “Yeah, I wouldn’t want to live down having an accident on… anyone’s watch.”
“Maybe. Right now I’m mainly working with weights and gardening. Well, it’s less gardening and more trying to rehabilitate all the empty lots and spaces around us. Are you running every day?”
He turns to Alex, but she interrupts with “Don’t get too emo. Patience says we’re going to see you soon, ok?” Patience gives Alex an annoyed look.
“You can take Miracle off the leash, Gertie. I think he’s calm,” says Cas. Gertie undoes it and hands it back to Cas. Miracle jumps on the couch and puts his head in Gertie’s lap much to her surprise and pleasure, as she gives him scratches on his head.
“Oh yeah! Got it,” He pulls himself back up and sees Jack’s upside down face at the side of the bed. “Case feels cracked, you better check it out,” and he reaches out to give it to Jack. “Brah, sit up or you’ll fall on your head or something.”
“I think Canada might be a little psychic. Or maybe she just guessed you were wearing it because it’s your favorite sweater. I have a psychic cousin — you know, I’ve told you about Patience? — so it wouldn’t be a big deal if she was. You shouldn’t let it bother you that everyone calls it your groutfit. It looks comfortable, and
There is now a third long table, spaced out to make sure there’s more than enough room for 19 people to eat without crowding.
Cas whispers, “Dean, our child has learned from the best, and will be able to defend himself against anyone trying to take advantage of him.”
Cas takes over. “Jack, why don’t you and Jeremy see if Miracle needs some water? We’ll pay the bill and give Sam a call to let him know the schedule.” As the boys slide out of the both, Cas places a hand on Dean’s thigh just to ground him a bit. Dean nods at him and puts a hand on top of Cas’ to give it a squeeze.
Justice on Earth," and she has a long, thin, multi-colored scarf, that looks like something Charlie would wear. Right now she seems happy and even a bit playful, waving at the car with a smile. She seems to frown from the noise from the Impala entering the lot behind them, and Dean thinks maybe he should have had Sam bring his Subaru. She’s probably judging Baby for being a gas guzzler, but what’s done is done, so they’ll have to suck it up on first impression points.
Dean gets up and says, “Ok campers, you will be tempted to put your marshmallow directly in the flame, but it will catch fire if you do that. We’re gonna hang out, talk, and let the fire die a bit, and you want to roast over the low flames or the embers. Rotate frequently.” Jack listens carefully to Dean’s advice, and Patience looks over the fire trying to determine what will be the best spot, but Alex and Claire are united in eye rolls. Kaia sighs and leans on Claire. She says, “I’ve had more than my share of roasting things over a fire. Would you please make my s'mores?”
“Time runs different here. I just meant to take a ride in Baby and gather my thoughts — think about what I wanted to say to him. Next thing I knew, I got out to look at the scenery and you were here.”
“How did these kids wind up being morning people who exercise, Cas? I thought kids their age were supposed to sleep until noon.”
Jack goes on.“I was on my group chat, and I worked on a surprise for today.” Jack looks at his phone. “Coming around 10 a.m.”
My apologies for any pool errors. Although, I actually was taken to play pool on a date in college, I don't know the game. The pool scenarios are half research and half The Gamblers episode.
Sounding a bit offended by the idea, Dean asks, “Why wouldn’t they come here to get you?” He then covers a wince when Cas kicks him under the table for asking such a blunt question in that tone. Cas frowns realizing he kicked a little harder than he meant to and puts his hand on Dean’s stroking it in silent apology.
The hallway leads into a large kitchen in a welcoming light apricot color. There’s big built-in fridge and freezer, but instead of the sterile-feeling stainless steel of the bunker, there’s a large, semi-circle marble island, with a cooktop and rinsing sink. There’s a counter above the work area and a row of barstools. Anyone who cooks can have an audience or some conversation. On the wall side are the ovens, a full sink, and the appliances.
known several months ago when Sam prepared the cover story for Jack’s fall semester” huffs Cas with an expression somewhere between amusement and mild annoyance. Dean finds himself smiling again. For one thing, Cas looks adorable when he’s annoyed. For another, it’s a miracle that minor family squabbles are all they have to deal with from heaven these days.
Mel turns to Jeremy. “Don’t let us bore you. You should hang out with Jack and his cousins. Here, take a non-alcoholic one.” Jack looks at Cas and Dean who give nods, as Jack takes a bottle of cider. Jack says to Jeremy, “Alex and Patience are up here and Claire and Kaia are in the rec room,” and leads Jeremy back. Alex and Patience wave, and Mel and Nat wave back. Dean murmurs that he needs to check on things in the kitchen, and offers to take the bottle there for Kelly. Mel hands Dean her enormous bag, and with a blink or two, he takes it all to the kitchen.
True Love, so I’m pretty sure I’ll live with them as long as I want. I guess I could go be with Sam and Eileen. I miss Sam. He always understood me and supported me. But I know Cas would do anything for me. He’s even chosen me over Dean before. He’s chosen me over everything. I feel like the only real fights they had were over me.” Jack trails off and looks a little sad.
“You don’t need to apologize. We’ll never know how much of every decision was us, and how much was Chuck warping things. It was always to his benefit for me to blame Jack. At first, I treated the poor kid so bad because I blamed him for Cas being dead. When Cas came back from the Empty the first time, I saw how much he loved Jack, and I let myself care for him. I stopped seeing Lucifer when I looked at him. The kid always looked just like Cas and I couldn’t see it until Cas was standing next to him. Then when Jack killed you that went out the window.” Dean pauses to pace around. Mary remains silent watching and waiting. After a minute, Dean turns and looks at Mary. He swallows, and starts again.
“Come now, I’ll sweeten the deal by bringing dinner. Would you all like Japanese, or will you demand that I bring pizza and wings.”
“Bless you dearie. Speaking of blessings, I am pleased to report that the Balance is achieving what we hoped. Jack can have his own life and not be God. Amara was significantly injured by Chuck, but she should eventually regain her full strength. However, by choice, Michael and Adam will continue to assist her. They should be able to visit earth in a few years. Gabriel is looking forward to being earthside in a couple of months, and he will still be the family’s guardian.
Arlett is laughing, chattering softly, occasionally looking over at Dean and Sam. Rather than seeming irritated at a strange human adjusting his hair, Cas looks content.
Dean had to stop and laugh at a family of werewolves being the keepers for a Men of Letters bunker, but it seemed fitting somehow. There was more to tell but they had an eternity, and they pulled up to the roadhouse, to find the sun lowering in the sky.
Once he’s gone, Jack catches Rowena up on everything she’s missed, including the Sparring Incident. Rowena clucks sympathetically, and keeps an eye on the stairs.
Kelly has more craft supplies, and the sisters make paper chains for the small tree in the rec room. Jack and J cut out some stars. They decorate the tree and after they’re done, everyone settles in to watch Jack and Claire play pool.
They find the room with two queen beds just across the hall. Jeremy has a slight tinge of guilt for not going to find the room with two fulls, but since he’s sure that it’s all the way down the stairs, he’s going to ignore it. Jack settles on the bed closest to the door, and they sit. Jeremy takes his shoes off again, and rolls his eyes when he sees Jack’s hesitation. “I may find it completely gross, but if you’re set on wearing your shoes on your own bed, go ahead.”
To Jeremy’s annoyance, Jack opens the car door before he’s come to a complete stop, so he says loudly, “Brah, rude!” He also grumbles, “I didn’t think the car would even let you do that,” as Jack runs out.
Jack disappears back up, but a minute later Jeremy hears him say, “I admit to seeing some down sides to the top bunk.”
Instead of the impressive front door they saw driving up, they go in a door by the garage that leads to a large mudroom and laundry with cubbies and coat pegs. There’s a bench, boot trays, a farmhouse sink with sprayer, and a stacked washer and dryer.
He pulls J’s car closer to the front entrance to park. He raises his voice a bit, “Hey Jack and J! We’re at the hotel! Rise and shine!” Jack stretches his body and lifts his arms up. Jeremy rubs his eyes but his body is still in a slumped half ball. By the time Cas comes with Miracle walking on a leash, they still haven’t become vocal, but Jack is at least out of the car. Dean takes his opportunities where he finds them.
They can hear the ping as Jack sends it, and the waitress comes up. Everyone keeps it simple with burgers, and they get in an order before the rush of people starting to come in.
“Unfortunately, the greater chaotic energy in the universe means witches may be more powerful. This will require more magic and protection spell training for hunters. There will be more and more civilians who have traces of psychic ability. More people will more likely be able to see auras, or sense feelings from close friends and family.
“Yes!” said Cas before he was finished, and there was a titter of laughter and some “awws”. Dean somehow knew which one to slide onto Cas’ finger, and Cas slid the other on his.
Dean says that he’ll have to give Miracle a bath before he gets to jump on everyone. Deciding that they all have things to do, they get up and head for the parking lot.
Rowen says, “Let’s move on. We anticipate there will be more ghost activity for hunters since we are low on Reapers to guide souls, in addition to the imprecise nature of probability. There should be fewer monsters that prey on humans due to the lack of demonic energy. That spell development I’m working on is to make a way for hunters to bypass the salt and burn and essentially throw a ghost to a reaper to get them on their way.”
“The number of Reapers has diminished, and they now collect people based on probability forecasts, since they don’t know exactly when everyone dies. Tracking billions of people keeps everyone busy,” says Gadreel. “It’s nice for the fates to have something challenging to do. Otherwise they get…unhappy.”
After a few minutes, Jack says, “Dad! We’re wearing our coat’s already, I don’t think we need that much heat.”
Jack nods and then pauses as Miracle decides that he’s interested in what they have and jumps down to come beg. “You’ve got your own treats for tonight. Are you ready, boy?” He gets back up to find something for Miracle.
Dean says, “J, everyone already knows that you do. I sure as hell know. So take care of yourself, and call us anytime.” Then he gives him a hug.
“I know that looks rough, but with our adopted moms being sheriffs, we’ve learned a lot of self-defense and martial arts. Jack is the family’s special boy, and he gets protected and spoiled. He likes being able to take care of himself and
“Ok, I’ll talk to Gadreel later. For now he’s your driver and arm candy, but why are you telling me this and not Kelly.”
Before the third game, Jack and Claire both sigh. They smile at each other and Jack says, “I think it just depends on the break.” Claire nods in agreement.
Dean taps his fingers. “So how long is Cas going be? I have half a mind to go out there and take the phone out of his hand.”
“That I am,” says Dean as Cas walks over, coat over his arm. His hair has that end of day disarray that looks so good on him, and he practically hits the woman with his deep blue eyes. “Hello,” says Cas in his gravel voice. The woman behind the desk blinks a few times and then looks at Dean with a slight blush on her cheeks.
Dean looks like he’s been slapped in the face for a moment. He backs off, inhales and sits next to Jack. In a surprisingly soft voice, he says, “Hey sweetheart, what’s going on?”
Jack gives his wave and heads with his backpack to the bathroom. Jeremy surveys the mess on the table and spots Marvelous Marvin on the sofa. He shakes his head and starts cleaning things up.
“But I spent a two hours decorating them using piping bags and watching YouTube videos as guides, and the carrier was my idea.”
“J, you are not gonna believe the breakfasts,” answers Dean. “I brought all my cast iron pots and pans, so a grill is just the cherry on top.”
A petite woman having a little bit of difficulty carrying a girl who looks about 4 or 5 years old, comes up to Kelly. “Excuse me, this is bit strange, but my daughter is going to be very disappointed if she doesn’t get to say hello to you.”
Charlies immediately says, “Oh, yes, she should come. Mom, do you want to head back, or would you like to meet her?” Charlie’s voice is encouraging, but she looks uncertain.
Sam says, “This place is really close. I’m sure everyone can tolerate the temperature for the ride over.”
Jeremy considers saying how it looks like Rowena needs a bodyguard at all times — which Gadreel obviously is — and it sounds as if Jack’s uncles and Aunt Amara leaving wherever they are will cause a foreign government to fall, but instead goes with, “No, not at all. I’m just kidding.”
Jack said, “You’re not being married by God. The profound bond you have is something you both created of your own free will. These rings are just a symbol of it.”
In a normal voice, Rowena says, “Thank you, Samuel. Now I must supervise the catering.” She goes to check with Charlie and Gertie to make sure there are options they’ll like.
Sam is packing up half his food and has managed to wrest away half of Cas’ burger from Dean. Arlette comes back again with two plates. She sets a piece of apple pie in front of Dean. She then sets an enormous piece of pecan pie in front of Cas. It looks like a quarter of the pie.
“They were there one time, but it was mostly with Mary and Bobby and their friends. We should sleeping on the ground, and build a fire. There were little kids there and I remember doing a shadow puppet show for them. Sometimes there were buildings with dirt floors, that kept out the wind. In the morning Mary would give me a can of something to heat up, or maybe I’d share a protein bar with her.”
Dean might sniffle a little before he yells, “Ok people, let’s get in the vicinity of the cars. Cas?” As he walks to the car, Dean sees Cas sitting in Jeremy’s car front passenger seat. Dean comes around to the drivers side, and says, “Sweetheart, have you been here all this time?”
“Yes. I’ll text you and Sam full names and Mel’s — Melanie’s — email and phone number. Sam can call Jody. We need to let them know we’ll have a guest.”
“You guys were lucky I caved and gave you my whole morning! Seriously, I should go. I need to interview someone later and I want to get ready.”
Dean shakes his head in exaggerated mock exasperation, but promises to go along with whatever is planned. He shoots Cas a quick, private look, which Cas picks up on with the slightest of nods. Looks like Jeremy’s still not ready to talk about going home.
Further into the movie, Jack looks concerned with Jeremy’s tight grip on the popcorn bowl. “You can hold Marvin,” he offers.
Cas likes to get Jack whatever he wants. Sam tries to be a practical dad, talk about things rationally, and use phrases like “wants versus needs.” He was the one to set up a budget and accounts for Jack at college. Sam dutifully reviews monthly statements with Jack online. Dean figures that given the deprived childhoods they’ve all had, a few things here and there aren’t going to break them, or turn Jack into an asshole. Also he figures that Cas and Charlie have the Big Blue Bear souvenir covered.
Patience puts a hand over her mouth. Jeremy sits down near Jack. Patience and Alex fill in next to him. Claire looks narrowly at them, as if they’ve taken a side. Cas puts an arm around her and Claire relaxes back in her seat, comfortable between Cas and Kaia.
Deans starts. “So what’s the story with our Mountain McMansion? Is this Kelly and Rowena? They’ve already miracled and magiked Jack’s college fund. I’m ok with that, but we don’t need heaven and hell competing to put us in a higher tax bracket.”
“Sam, I’m glad you’re back.” Cas steps up for a hug, but quickly says, “Sam, this is Jack’s friend Jer…”
Kelly gets a framed picture of her and Jack. Sam and Eileen get a picture of themselves laughing together in the living room that neither of them remember Jeremy taking. Kelly rolls her eyes and says that she was there and Jeremy specifically asked them if he could take some pictures. Dean teases that they were just too much in love to really notice anything.
People are finishing up so, Eileen gives Sam a look. This time Sam stands and makes the announcement. “Rowena, Eileen and I have an announcement and a request. We’re getting married March 17
The Sunday after Jeremy leaves, Jack and the sisters take over the kitchen, create their own snack concoctions, and head down to the rec room to binge watch some shows. Jack sends Jeremy a supportive, emoji-laden text, but doesn’t try to start a conversation. He knows that Jeremy has a lot going on, and a lot of talking with his parents ahead of him. While the binge watch rolls on, Jack texts Canada, who insists they jump on FaceTime.
the same as dirt from the bottom of your shoes. There’s no comparison between eating on a bed and wearing shoes on a bed. Just think of the germs!”
“Thanks! This is great,” she says taking it from him. “Anyway, there was someone with the background we were looking for in St. Louis, but that didn’t pan out, so Mom and I left early for Denver. I’ve got to get back to the Tech Center for an appointment this afternoon.”
Sam drove and caught Dean up with a few aspects of his life. How he’d started out intending to pass on lore and train hunters, but once he and Eileen had a child, he just couldn’t bear to be away any length of time. Maybe it was trying to not be John Winchester. Maybe part of it was missing Jack, but he just couldn’t do it. He wanted to be a dad. To avoid becoming a homebody house husband, he did a lot of volunteering to tutor kids in his community, and took classes on all kinds of subjects, but it was Eileen who worked and traveled for a while. They made good friends who sometimes stayed at the house, and helped like an extended family. As Sam's son Dean got older, Sam got a job at a local non-profit, but family always came first.
Kelly realizes that it’s pretty damn hard for an angel to cry and feeling more inhuman than usual makes her a little less happy, but she sighs and decides it’s worth it to be what she is for Jack, and she knows that she still loves fiercely. That makes her smile, and wonder why smiles are easier. She gets her usual hot chocolate and Dean makes a little wreath of chocolate sauce on her whipped cream. She throws a wing around Jack at the table and feels content.
“Son of bitch!” yells Dean. Sam sits again, woozy from relief, having anticipated a cosmic event. Eileen strokes his back. Cas and Dean on the other hand look more upset and agitated than they were before.
“The divorce is still happening and she’s planning to stay in Missouri for now, but they’re friends, so we can expect to see them both. In fact, I have a request, and I’m supposed to text him soon. So what do you guys say about inviting them to dinner on Christmas?”
Jeremy noticed that Gertie slipped out, and follows to look for her. He goes to the alcove on the top floor and finds her on the first try. She’s in an armchair knitting with Miracle sleeping on her feet.
Sorry this took a while. I made some changes to the tone of this chapter that had me cutting and rewriting sections I'd already done. It was a spur of the moment decision months ago that had me expanding the original small little Christmas exchange one shot to my first multi-chapter fic.
“Are you sure you want to encourage Dean?” Sam asks, pointing at a drawer with cowboy themed cutters, including a hat and boot.
“That is, Rowena, Queen of Hell, will give us an update on her domain and Team God — with help from Gadreel and Kelly. I’ll follow up with the new family non-profit. Rowena, please continue.”
Mary sighs. “Forgiving isn’t just about fault. It wasn’t my fault that Jack killed me, but I took a chance that maybe I shouldn’t have.”
Annoyed, Jeremy sets some bones down on his plate. “So of all your dad’s, Cas is your father, right? Is he the one you’d live with if he and Dean didn’t stick together?”
“Jack brought you some coffee.” Dean grabs it and silently takes a long sip as Cas continues. “The boys are going down to the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant. They thought they’d spare you a trip downstairs and got you this first.” Cas presents a foil-wrapped package. Dean hands the coffee back for a minute and unwraps a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich that is very heavy on the bacon. He groans in appreciation and takes a bite.
“Kelly whooshed us on ahead so you’d know what happened without J hearing,” says Patience. “She’s going to wake him in a minute. Of course, Claire didn’t mean to hit him. She was doing her I’m-gonna teach-you-to-block thing, and he turned when she didn’t expect it…. I think his kicking her knee out was all fight-flight reflex when she hit him. I mean, he wouldn’t have wanted to hurt her either.”
Jeremy looks surprised, but recovers quickly, and smiles. “I enjoyed visiting your family. I guess I have to accept that my best friend is going to use FaceTime like my mom instead of texting like a normal person. Don’t abuse your privilege.”
“Yes, it’s a good sign,” answers Kelly. “You sure, nothing disturbing?” Kelly looks carefully at Patience.
Kelly gets up from the dining room and goes to give Jack a kiss on the forehead. Jack glows at her affection and Dean and Cas’ warm smiles.
“About a decade later I realized that if you really had minded me being in your ‘personal space’ all those times, you would have moved backwards instead of making me do it,” says Cas raising an eyebrow.
“Everything’s already set. Enjoy your stay,” she says to Cas, and then suddenly finds something to do further down the counter.
Claire kisses her temple, and puts an arm around her. With her other hand she takes a glass and raises it, “To us, because we’re all so badass.”
Cas, Gadreel, and Sam look equally shocked, but Cas recovers and says, “While I have a hard time picturing Gadreel on a roller coaster, I think he’d enjoy watching people. What you do say, Gadreel?”
“Oooh, I didn’t know there were still cheese balls. That would be excellent,” says Claire with a bigger smile.
“Bring it in, Queen,” says Dean standing as Charlie gives another fierce embrace. Miracle jumps on Dean’s chair, and is on the verge of barking hellos to the whole restaurant, excited by all the activity. Dean turns around to grab him, as Charlie slides over to Jeremy.
Kelly speaks. “Lots of angels just want to follow orders, but they do want the orders to make sense and be moral. Hell is the best place for that now. It’s almost all monitoring and reporting.”
Jeremy looks at the cookie closely and sees that Cas drew in feathers with thin gold frosting lines over the white wings, so he spent a lot of time on it. If he thinks it’s another weird thing to do if you believe in angels, he keeps it to himself. “For some reason I like these better than typical angel cookies, too.” Jack looks up from giving Miracle a rawhide chew with a big smile.
“Rowena, there are are plenty of us here to unload your car,”says Sam. “Wait a minute, you’re not bringing anyone from
When they finally get back in the car at the end of the day, all the phones ding. Kelly takes over driving, because Dean goes a bit crazy when Rowena sends him a picture of her and Miracle on a sophisticated-looking chaise lounge in front of a log fire surrounded by many good-looking people cooing over them. The text reads, “Took Miracle to see friends in Vail.” Miracle looks suspiciously shiny, and has been styled with bows. Dean suspects the thumb on one side of the image is Gadreel’s. Jack forwards the picture to Jeremy, who replies with a thumbs up emoji. He then sends back a picture of the Flatirons and a text letting Jack know that they didn’t go home and have been tourists in Boulder. Then Alex and Patience’s group chat gets the picture, too.
Jeremy takes the tennis ball and throws it straight up into the cold, but bright blue sky. He watches it carefully and catches it as it comes down. He feels lighter, as though his head is as clear as the sky. He walks toward Dean who has his hands full holding Miracle. “See if you can get it back in that outer pocket for me, J.” Jeremy has it in the wide pocket of Dean’s jacket and is walking away before he realizes that he now has a nickname.
“Heh, heh, yeah. That was a good one,” says Dean with a big smile that crumples into a frown. “So you had a flashback about Sam going bad?”
“Ok, remember, Nat sometimes has a crowd thing, so let’s not all stand around the door to greet him. If he needs to go be by himself, don’t be offended.”
Jeremy looks slightly nervous, and says, “Hello Kelly. Uh, is there anything we should be doing, like unloading your car?”
“Uh-huh.” Dean opens the back seat to arrange things. “So if we got everything, then I just need to bring Miracle…”
On Monday, Mia has a long online family session with Dean, Cas, Sam and Jack. It’s pretty straightforward and doesn’t require any shifting. Afterwards she tells them that her practice is bursting at the seams. She’s looking for people with supernatural experience to help her expand. Sam tells her that he’s sure Charlie and Eileen would be willing to keep a lookout.
“I’m still on the dreamy guys!” yells Charlie as she goes to give Cas a big hug. “I know better than to kiss you. I might have a revolt of my subject over there,” Charlie jokes as Cas returns her big affectionate squeeze.
“I get that. I guess nowadays mistletoe is a consent issue waiting to happen. We’ll have to save it just for us next year. Here, turn around, let me do you.”
Eileen gives a hearty laugh, and says, “I don’t usually sign everything I say, but Jack is learning ASL, so I’m going to sign more for him to learn. Don’t feel you have to follow everything. Come on, Sam. Let’s get their stuff.”
One of the men who’s wearing a well-worn light-blue button down and reading glasses, says, “Now you can’t come to Texas and not have pecan pie”.
Kelly is particularly mesmerized by the s’mores experience as a new angel and it overcomes her suspicion enough to make her ask Gadreel sit next to her, and give his perspective as an old angel. From afar it just looks like being excited about getting to eat s’mores, but she talks to him about seeing the chemical reaction between the gelatin and sugar in the marshmallow and the difference between chemical and physical changes. Having been around a very long time, Gadreel finds her enthusiasm amusing, and actually cracks a few smiles, and they talk about whether or not carbon molecules always taste the same.
Gertie stirs some soba noodles and skims knitting patterns on her tablet at the end of the table opposite Sam, but is still attentive enough to push a platter a little closer to Charlie who passes it to Jeremy.
There are exactly six pictures. There’s the one of Dean and Cas in the diner back in Lebanon, looking at Miracle, the sunlight coming in makes it fuzzy, soft, and unfocused. There’s the selfie of Jeremy and Jack on the mountain when they went tubing with squinting and smiling and the sunlight making rays across them. There’s one of Jack, with Marvin next to him, looking at his laptop and not the camera. The lighting is dark, so the light from the laptop illuminates just Jack and Marvin. If one’s completely honest Jack looks slightly creepy, because of the intensity from concentration. There’s another of Jack, Alex and Patience, with Jack facing away. Alex and Patience face the camera, but aren’t looking at it, and they’re all sitting on one of the big landscape rocks. It’s a good picture, but left un-cropped it looks far away. Another dark picture is around the fire pit making s’mores. The viewer would have to know Claire and Kaia to guess who it was, but you get the impression of two people very close. The last one is of Nat and Mel on Pearl Street in Boulder. They’re backlit so you can’t see their faces well, but the lighting helps show that their fingers just lightly touch as they stand looking around at different things.
Cas squints at it and then squints at her. Dean says, “So why does Cas get the big piece?” She smiles. “Because my brother David over there loves pecan pie, and when a stranger came in years ago, I gave that stranger an enormous piece of pie, which I knew he’d wind up sharing with my brother. And now that stranger is my brother-in-law Jimmy.” She pauses, “Well, the in-law part was a long time coming, but it didn’t matter.”
“No, I’d be terrible. Besides, I’m not sure that I believe the whole do what you love thing. I’d like to keep enjoying things I want to do — not try to make money from it.”
Bobby stood up and greeted Sam, giving him a bear hug, but he soon turned to Dean and said, “I went ahead and put the word out. Almost everyone is inside now.”
Eileen has been watching carefully, and she comes up. “Luck had nothing to do with it. We chose each other, and we choose you. Come here.” She gives Jeremy a hug, and everyone seems moved close to tears.
“Not from around here” chortles his friend, pleased at having the proper set up to finish what sounds like an old familiar line. They both have a laugh and share a look as their hands slide together. The movement is just registering in Dean’s brain, when Arlette comes out of the kitchen with an enormous tray.
“They’re in a math class together. We ran into him and his parents on Family Weekend, but I don’t think Jack knew him very well then. We just said a quick hello. It took several weeks into their study group for them to start ‘hanging out’.” Dean can’t help a smile. Even though Cas didn’t make finger quotes, Dean could hear them in his voice.
“Ugh. I’m better at reading it than speaking it. I can’t roll my R’s and I sound like an embarrassment to Spanish teachers everywhere. I wonder if the advisors would let me switch to Latin?”
Cas squeezes Claire, “and we haven’t heard much out of you and Kaia, Claire. Maybe you two, will want to strike out? We don’t want to get far from you two either.”
Patience looks surprised, but brings up her hands as fists and then opens and closes them quickly suggesting small starbursts.
” and then hits video. Jeremy is used to Jack’s strange emoji and symbol messages, and so he obeys. He might be a little annoyed though. “Brah, you know I hate FaceTime. Why are you torturing me?”
wouldn’t say that at lunch. Dad’s weird about the Dane-Danish thing.” Cas gives Dean a significant look.
Dean makes a waving motion, as if to sweep the appreciation away. It’s still a little awkward between Dean and Sam, but without most of the earlier tension. Sam takes a hard look at Dean, and then exhales and says, “Ok, spill it. What else happened.”
Jack lets go and gives him one of his funny smiles — the ones that are a little lopsided. Jeremy asks, “So how are you?”
“I’m texting them that we’re going to park the cars first. But look, you can see them already. They’re over there” Jeremy says pointing. “The blonde woman is my mom.”
“Hanging dry wall doesn’t sound like a small first project,” says Cas as Jody nods in concerned agreement.
Dean got down on one knee. Cas’ eyes widened. “Cas, I love you. This wouldn’t be my heaven without you. We can make it anything you want it to be. I just need you. I want you by my side from now on. Will you stay with me?”
Sam brings out a little smart speaker for the kitchen, and the family divides between baking and poker. At first Dean rocks out, but he let’s the others send some playlists, too. Kaia and Claire rejoin, with a little teasing from Dean about having a rest, for which Jody gives an uncomfortable look. Then they join in and play a round of poker, too. Despite the scare some of them had, it’s a fun day.
When they get back to the house, everyone goes separate ways for private conversations. Dean, Sam and Cas go to talk about something financial — apparently with it being important to finish before the Sisters arrive. Jack goes to the rec room with his laptop to to chat with Canada and write some emails, because he’s hoping to go through add/drops. Jeremy goes to the bedroom to FaceTime his mom and dad, and winds up calling one of his aunts, too. Gadreel disappears somewhere. Miracle gets bored and whines a bit upstairs, but eventually goes downstairs to sit with Jack. Communication must go well for everyone, since no one looks troubled when they all meet in the kitchen later looking for snacks. Dean and Cas take Miracle for a walk. Sam checks in with Eileen, who doesn’t give much in the way of details about her day but promises to take care of dinner and bring Charlie; although, not Gertie. Rowena texts a few times to Sam. Not long after that they get word that the sisters are about to arrive, so they head outside.
Gertie says, “I’m going to tell you a secret. Sometimes when someone says that they don’t like crowds, it’s not that they really dislike being around a lot of people, it’s that they dislike how they might act in the crowd. I’ve always liked people. I was considered an extrovert when I was younger — Charlie gets that from me — but I was in a car accident that put me in a coma for years. It was just me and my memories for a long time. Sometimes I’m not sure what’s real and what isn’t, so I can blank out or have a conversation with people who aren’t there. Both those things tend to upset people. Today’s been a very good day, but every day is different. Every person is different. Your father might have a phobia, or be an introvert, or something else may be going on. He might be like me, but I doubt it. You’ll have to ask him, if he seems open to it.” She shrugs, “I probably shouldn’t have said all that, but I’m in a good mood today, so guess I can handle a few mistakes.”
Alex reaches in a bag and holds up a black sweater. The text reads, “Merry Whatever” and in the center is a grumpy cat with a Santa hat on.
Cas and Dean get a picture of Miracle in the pink room at the selfie museum, which makes Cas laugh, but they have another gift. They tear open the wrapping on a picture of Cas and Jack in front of the pink angel wings. It’s striking, the size of a small poster, and professional-looking. Kelly says that she wants one, as does Sam. Dean puffs up with pride, and can’t stop looking at it. Cas can tell he’s going to have a hard time getting it out of Dean’s hands, but manages by telling him it has to be carefully wrapped back up so it doesn’t get dented when they pack the car. Dean then immediately wants to find some bubble wrap, so Cas lets Dean do what he wants.
“That there are plenty of times we were all covered in blood and guts with no shower around, and you just told Jack to go take one because he got dirt in his hair playing with Miracle. We’ve got a different scale these days.”
“Wow. Jack painted you two as the friends who had a child together, right? Just like Jeremy’s parents?”
creepy. The side closest to the stairwell is in the hill, so no views or windows.” Pointing down the hall as he walks, Sam rattles off, “These rooms are storage and electrical, that’s an office with a sofa bed and a printer, a small bathroom with a shower. You keep going down the hall, you get the rooms with windows facing out from the hill slope. You’re gonna love this one.” Sam flings open a door into a large L-shaped rec room.
“Maybe your classmates aren’t mature enough for you. Are you going straight through to do a masters?”
There are some high pitched squeals of joy involved in saying hello that catch Miracle’s attention and have him putting his ears up.
“Don’t judge me,” she says with a raised eyebrow and a hint of a laugh. “I’m behind in setting up a new IG.” Once everyone is seated, she says, “Jeremy, it’s great that we all have some time to spend with you while you have a free schedule — no classes or exams.”
“Plus, he’s so honest. He always talks about things that are hard. Jack brought up having a bad spell with Dean in the past. He told me about them talking with Mia. It just made me feel like he could cope with anything.”
Gadreel insists on taking Charlie and Gertie back, and lets everyone know that he’ll stay elsewhere overnight and be back early in the morning ready to drive people to wherever they want. There’s a round of byes, a passing of leftovers, and Cas and Dean walk out with Charlie and Gertie.
Eileen stands, too, and says and signs, “I asked Sam to marry me, and he accepted!” There’s chaos, as almost everyone goes to hug them. Jeremy, who looks awkward at having wound up at a major private family event, tries to avoid a hug and just say, “congratulations,” but gets hugs from Sam and Eileen anyway.
Sam looks as if he’s preparing to give a speech, but then he just says, “This is it. This is where we’re all staying….so, surprise?”
They don’t exactly sleep in heaven. It’s more like closing your eyes, letting it be dark, and feeling time swirl around you. Not sleep exactly, but refreshing to the soul, and a good excuse for stretching in bed and enjoying the sensation of a new day. Dean rolls over and feels Cas’ wings blanket him a little tighter.
“You taught Sam well, and he probably didn’t see any red flags. Guess we need to start nudging him home.”
“Oh, that makes sense,” says Jack sounding older already. “He’s supposed to text when they get to the hotel. That should be pretty soon.” Jack stretches his back and arms, and Kelly stretches her wings up, and flicks them back down.
“Nope. Mom’s vegan, so vegetable lasagna with sauce and cheese was something she made a lot of on the weekend as a compromise for me, even though she doesn’t do dairy. I was supposed to learn to cook for myself but that didn’t happen. She’s really organized about stuff like that — cooking for a week on Sunday. She made a lot of my stuff in advance.”
Sam blinks at him a little. “Ok, so Jack’s friend — a civilian — is helping Jack through trauma from being in an alternate universe and Mom being in heaven, and you’re ok with it.”
Kelly stops, with Jack and Jeremy behind. Kelly nods and with a big smile, looks right at the girl and says, “Hello, I’m Kelly. Nice to meet you. Hope you’re having fun here today.”
“No, but I didn’t mind. You only dropped off for an extra twenty minutes. We had a good night — at least seven hours.”
The steam goes out of Patience, and she’s quiet. Then she just says. “Ok, so I’m going to medical school. I just have to finish jumping the hoops.”
“Shit,” says Jeremy again, feeling at a loss. “I shouldn’t have told you I was upset about my parents getting divorced. It’s stupid. They’re not arguing. They’re not mad at each other. They don’t treat me bad. Honestly, I know I’m spoiled. I probably got that car out of divorce guilt. Lots of people have it worse. I’m being an asshole.”
Miracle gets excited, barks a bit, and tries to follow, but Dean grabs him and says, “Hey, hey, boy. Slow your roll. Well, it’s too soon for a full dessert after that meal, but I think I’ll make some hot chocolate. They’ll get cold out there, and I’m pretty sure it’s something Kelly can taste.”
After a little time, they’re brought to a half-booth, half-table in a semi-private room. Since they sit four on each side, Kelly sits herself next to Nat so Sam can sit across and not be in an awkward position for eye contact while talking.
“Every single large vacation rental I looked at had a rec room with a pool table, so this was impossible to mess up.”
Speculation ends when Gadreel’s and Sam’s phones beep. Gadreel who’s been silent the whole time says, “The ‘missing Queens’ are almost here. I’ll go out to meet them.” However, no one is willing to just remain sitting, and they go outside to meet Eileen, Kelly, Rowena, and Charlie. Gadreel takes a large number of shopping bags from them, and Rowena provides some directions. Sam looks relieved to have Eileen back after being separated all night and all day, and practically picks her up for a kiss, and for once Eileen looks like she might blush. They get teased when they walk in the house, and Sam and Eileen announce their wedding news. After hugs, Jody gives Sam a hard time about the Sioux Falls family being the last to know.
“He’s coped with more than he should have, but he’s only human. I’m just glad that he has a friend like you.”
Donna goes up first. “Hey kiddo, we didn’t get to see enough of you. We need a longer stay next time.” Jeremy is pleased that everyone seems to feel that there’s a next time coming up.
“We’ve only been on vacation a couple days. What about the mountain scenery?” Asks Jack. Jeremy gives a signature dramatic groan, and startles a bit as Cas grabs his tripod so he doesn’t have to carry it.
“When I started playing the ScholHalls it was for promises to swap cleaning shifts with people, attend hall meetings — stuff like that. Now that everyone is wary, it’s just for fun,” answers Jack.
At that Gertie, openly says, “See!” to Charlie, who shakes her head with an exasperated smile. “Thank you so much, Kelly. I’m glad to know that you really did become an angel, and it wasn’t a dream. It makes me feel better.”
“I didn’t like the idea of sharing a bedroom at all. You know, only child — never had to. So how did you get so comfortable with the idea of bunk beds and sharing a bedroom?”
There’s a few laughs, but while they talk, Jack wondering when he should start wearing his kilts on campus, and Rowena trying to explain sporrans, Dean sighs. “Sometimes I just wish we could be there.”
“Just make sure you run on level ground and have good shoes, so you don’t get injured.” Jack and Jeremy smirk and smile over Cas being a protective Dad as Cas tries some hash browns. “These are good, but not as good as Dean’s.”
Cas turns from his conversation. Cas says, “I heard that, and it’s not true. There’s a lot of you in Jack — especially bravery and faith in people. No one has faith like you.”
“Cas, I’m serious! If Rowena can work Amazon deliveries, we should be able to have a network and emojis.”
“Charlie’s been searching for US Men of Letters accounts and chapter house land deeds to see what we could legally liquidate, since we’re taking apart the old infrastructure, and putting it into the non-profit. When she was doing it, she found records on a lot of old wills, including Henry’s. Apparently it was a common thing for the members to leave their assets to the organization if they didn’t have heirs.”
My Tumblr reblogs are full of baby!Jack, but I also like the idea of Jack choosing not to be a baby. I put that idea here, but no offense to baby!Jack.
“Jeremy, will you stop and let me in?” There’s one last louder thud, and then a crash, and a loud, “Shit!”
Jack wins the first game playing a straightforward, deceptively simple style. It gives the impression of someone who just happens to be on a streak of easy shots. Claire does every shot of hers with a bit of drama, leaning on the table sometimes, letting her hair drape so it looks like she’s shouldn’t be able to see. She double-banks when she doesn’t have to, and gives Kaia flirty looks.
“The most important thing is that they made an effort — to give Jeremy space by letting him stay with us, and now by getting to know us,” says Cas.
Kelly smiles sweetly and says softly to Dean and Cas, “You two don’t need to worry. If there’s a problem he can’t handle, I’ll handle it,” she says, ending with a smug look.
Rowena sighs and says that she needs to go off to do a little work that’s important, but she’ll be sure to be around to see Jeremy off Saturday morning, if not before. Gadreel insists that he should go along, so he’ll return when Rowena does.
Sam looks uncomfortable. “Well, I can swim you know…,” seeing Dean’s exaggerated shaking head, he adds, “remember, you were the one who was better at sports, including swimming, when we were kids. I’m just exploring some new options.”
The lesbian holiday rom-com they are watching is "The Happiest Season," currently still on Hulu. For this particular experience, Jeremy and Alex are my self-inserts. I felt like I was going to have an aneurysm watching everything Kristin Stewart's character (Abby) went through. However, reading some reviews, I discovered that many people were moved by the movie, and I wanted to reflect that.
“Ajay is Jeremy’s roommate. They’re all in the math class together. Dean, I don’t think we can figure out Jack’s feelings by how much he mentions any one friend.”
“Hold on.” Dean gingerly picks up  the specially acquired cookie carrier and passes it to Cas. Cas makes a few adjustments of the package puzzle that is the trunk, and nests the carrier between a throw blanket and a bag of stocking stuffers. All of a sudden Cas looks a bit ill.
“A gift’s a gift,” says Claire. Alex raises and eyebrow at that and smiles thinking about Claire and the coyote sweater.
“Alex is well past. You know, old,” Patience teases with a grin as she taps her, to which Alex just rolls her eyes. “This year for me,”says Patience.
“Shush,” whispers Cas as he looks over the many packages mentally checking off lists. Dean does his own inventory of the snacks already in the back seat.
Seeing Jack work quadratic equations, Jeremy knows that underneath Jack’s ever smiling pleasant face he’s stubborn af, and there are some things he just doesn’t give up on, so he lets out a put upon sigh, holds out a tray of cookies and says with a smile, “Have a cookie and shut up.”
Gertie looks like she might be about to ask why, but she closes her mouth and motions to a storage bench and pillows. Instead of sitting on the bench, Jeremy sits on the floor with his back to the bench.
Claire and Kaia stayed at the bunker for a while, helping to teach hunters, until the bunker was finally locked up as more of a storehouse and emergency backup location, like some of the old Men of Letters chapter-houses. The key eventually went to Garth’s sons, Castiel and Sam, for safekeeping, and the plan was for it to stay in their family.
Heads up: while this is going to be very tame fic, I realize that I can't imagine Dean not swearing some more, and not have some joking about middle-aged sex. So I will bump the rating up to teen when we get there.
Ok, probably some of you might be wondering things like "is this going to be a romantic thing with the OC and Jack?" and "what is everyone's gender identity." I'm really not intending to fill in a lot of blanks, and I'm thinking that Jack is really just wanting to build friendships. This friendship could be a foundation for something else later, but that shouldn't come up in this particular story.
Donna and Jody go out to start the fire for s’mores. Charlie puts the tv on a crackling Yule log, and Sam reinstalls the smart speaker in a new location for Christmas music. The doorbell rings, and Miracle starts barking, running for the door.
“Ok so the non-profit is a private education and wellness foundation and not a charity. We don’t go in and fix a problem. Our main job is to give people the information and funding they need to take care of the situation themselves. We can also provide scholarships.
“You’re like the little brother that I definitely didn’t want,” says Alex with a smile. “You’re on group chat with Patience and me now, so don’t ghost.”
Sam laughed, “Dean, I had a long life. Longer than anyone who hunted before us I think. Eileen and I were happy. I have a grown up son, named after you. How do you not know?”
Jack tells Dean, “I won’t be able to talk to her again until I die. I don’t remember if I saw her. Heaven felt like it happened so fast. I don’t remember everything…”
There’s no answer. Jack is silent, already under the covers and staring at Marvin as if Marvin can answer some questions he has. Jeremy sits on his own bed and looks across at Jack, “Are you upset, too? Mad at me?”
Mel says, “Don’t worry, I brought other things for the rest of us.” She has an enormous bag on her shoulder that she reaches into and pulls out a bottle.
Rowena nods and starts again. “Team God had to give up omniscience to allow for Free Will, and is now subject to some elements of Chance and Chaos. Therefore, heaven has a new priority for forecasting and projecting odds.
“It’s mainly the Old Angels that spent a lot time on earth that get obsessed about a taste — so Gabe. Sweet is the easiest human taste to learn. They can eventually turn off the whole molecule thing, but takes a very long time and and a lot of effort. I think Balthazar concentrated on wine as soon as it got invented, so he can taste subtle things. I was lucky, since Jack re-made me. I can taste most things that are sweet or very strong in flavor — and also peanut butter. Sweet and spicy food is good. But eating whipped cream from the can is just a thing I did before becoming an angel.”
“I guess that’s what happens when you call them kiddos, hon,” Jody says to Donna, as she walks in and sits next to Jody, getting a kiss on the cheek.
Once the hot chocolate has been drunk, and the boys have gone off to take noodles and tape upstairs, Cas rests his head on Dean’s shoulder, as Dean rinses mugs.
Sam answers while Jack chews lasagna. “Two are. Patience is like Jack — a first year but a little older. Alex has been working as a nurse assistant for a few years, but she needs her full nursing degree to advance and supervise, so she went as a transfer student. Patience wants them to graduate at the same time, even though everyone has told her there’s no rush. Patience tested out of some intro courses, and can catch up to Alex in summer school, if she sticks with the idea. I think Patience wants to help Alex focus.”
“The Dean Winchester I used to know would never have planned to stop for the night somewhere two hours from his destination,” says Sam with a bit of awe in his voice, but Dean doesn’t quite catch the tone.
After that, a generation gap develops in the tour, as Jeremy and Jack aren’t that interested in the amenities of eight bedrooms, so they’ve taken out their phones. Meanwhile, Dean and Cas debate the pros and cons of the bedrooms with — in Sam’s opinion — entirely too much focus on the showers. However, that may simply be because Sam and Eileen already picked out, and have been living in, the king master suite with the oversized tub for several days. Dean and Cas ultimately pick a king suite with a steam shower but no tv, leaving Jody and Donna the last king suite with a private balcony, and a television.
Cas just stands with him as they watch Jack run up to Sam. Sam and Jack release each other. Jack starts signing to Eileen. Dean leaves Eileen’s side so Jack can
“Dean and Cas are both nice and you all seem happy, so I have to assume something pretty bad happened? It wouldn’t make it right but… Shit, are you ok?” The color has gone from Jack’s face and he might be trembling a little. Jeremy jumps from his bed and gets in front of Jack, crouching a bit so his face is at the same level.
“It’s good. Maybe a little on the light side for christmas,” says Alex. “I’m more of an eggnog girl.”
“Yeah, and there’s a couple of wind farms just further down on our way to Denver.” Jeremy looks uncomfortable again, but “Uh Dean, would it be ok if we make a couple of quick stops for pictures?”
Cas walks next to Jeremy as he juggles his pack and prepares to get in the driver’s seat of his electric car. Cas lowers his voice conspiratorially and says, “I think Jack will be as worn out as Miracle. If he falls asleep that may make you drowsy, too. You have a holder or hands-free, right?” Jeremy nods. “Just call us and we’ll keep you company.” Jeremy hands Cas his phone, and Cas puts his number in.
“So, an electric car and an upset young adult who may or may not be romantically interested in our son?” asks Cas.
“No way Sunshine. I’m excited every day that I wake up and see you. It’s just that being a retired dad is gonna sound boring to everyone else. Especially a kid Jeremy’s age.”
Kelly walks out the door, and since no one is around, she indulges herself in a snap. She then knocks on the door to Charlie’s very nice hotel room.
here. Look, I don’t care if Jack freezes Hell over and turns it into a ski resort with lines to get in — the idea of any of our family being in Hell is not something I can handle. It doesn’t mean that I want to have another happy family dinner yet, but I’ve made a home with Cas, my friends are close by, and no one is suffering.” Dean thinks about his father and grandfather Samuel and wonders when he’ll be ready. “Mom, things are good with you and me. I learned my lesson. Amara tried to tell me that I needed to get to know you as a person, and not as a saint on a pedestal, or an apple pie image. I shouldn’t have done that to you. It took me a long time to figure it out.”
“Well, she’s right, but I don’t need to be so angry I can’t talk to you. You want to try maybe tomorrow after we both have a night to sleep on it.”
“I worked with the Winchesters and Castiel on a project some years ago. I’m afraid that I overstepped some boundaries. I’m thankful for their hospitality considering the mistakes I made in the past. I’m assigned to Rowena a short time, and then Michael has some suggestions, but I’d rather not speak of work now.”
“I’ve got my pans seasoned just right. Not gonna leave that to chance,” says Dean perfectly serious.
Jeremy goes to collapse on the couch and Jack flicks the throw blanket lying on the back of it to land on Jeremy’s head. He leaves it, and just lies there making disgruntled sounds. After cleaning the broken glass, Jack takes a look. By now Jeremy has made a space for breathing, but is otherwise covered up.
“Send me that,” Jeremy says to Jack, and then squirms slightly when Dean and Cas look at him. “Uh, my parents will like seeing stuff from the trip.” He then looks down determined to focus on the menu. Very softly he says, “I have to text a few times.”
“Uh, oh. I nearly forgot,” says Sam as he goes to pull Kelly aside from the group. He whispers a few words and the lights flicker. Dean looks over to see if Cas noticed, and he meets Dean’s eyes gives a slight nod to indicate he has. Dean raises an eyebrow and Cas gives the slightest of shrugs.
Jody and Donna are doing a couples spa day as an early Christmas gift from Rowena. The younger members of the family are outside around the fire pit space which looks like a mini-amphitheater. They’re tasked with shoveling the walk to the pit, and sweeping out the remaining snow so it doesn’t melt and freeze overnight as ice. Sam also gives them a bucket for any old ashes. It’s not supposed to snow overnight or tomorrow, so things should be set for tomorrow’s slumber party, as they’ve taken to calling it. Dean and Cas sit for a chat with Charlie, Sam, Eileen, and Kelly around one of the dining room tables before baking day starts in earnest.
They have time to kill while the Tesla charges, so they sit around the picnic table sipping drinks and chatting. Jack has a hot chocolate and Jeremy has indulged in something just as sweet looking, but with caramel. Although the wheat Jesus sign is within easy walking distance, Cas isn’t crazy about all of them crossing 25, so they’ll get into Baby to make the three-minute drive over. Since they got word of Jeremy’s seat belt question from Jack, as he walks the boys to Baby, Dean explains that the Impala came with just lap belts, because shoulder straps didn’t come out until the 70s. “I knew we’d have Jack on the road trip, so I installed shoulder straps in the back seat a couple weeks ago. The buckle is a little weird, but it retracts like normal.” As Jeremy slides in Dean continues, “Of course Jack’s ridden in this car a long time without them.”
“Are you assuming that I’m going somewhere other than home? Brah, I’m not a beach for break person. I can come back to Kansas anytime, if I’m invited.” He turns to Charlie, “Is there still a dragon roll left you can pass me?”
“I suppose I enjoy seeing everyone get riled up when I flirt with you, but I deserve at least a decade of flirting with you that I didn’t have.”
“See? You’ll never be tempted to sit on a bed in your outside shoes, and in the event of emergency, you can run in them.”
Sam goes to the hallway to mudroom where it turns out there’s a wine chiller. He pulls a bottle of champagne. Rowena nods in approval.
It was a small diner on the outskirts of Austin, painted brighter than most. Usually that meant an intense 1950s vibe, but this was much more laid back. There was rose-tinted natural light from a large picture window showing the setting sun. Something inside of Dean relaxed as they walked in.
Jack sits on the rug in front of the couch, and pulls out his phone to texts for a while, knowing that ignoring his friend is the best bet. He texts Sam, then catches up with Claire, snorting a few times. Then he reaches for his backpack and pulls out Marvelous Marvin. Jack pushes it under the blanket. Yet another groan, slightly more disgusted in tone comes out, but Marvin doesn’t reappear.
Kelly looks across the table at Gadreel with a hint of suspicion as she pushes a piece of spicy tuna roll onto some wasabi; however, he’s polite and apologetic at every turn. He has to speak at an angle, but Gadreel manages tells Jeremy about himself.
“You’re lookin’ good kid,” says Dean indicating Jack’s sweater. It’s a simple, light blue sweater with a dark blue collar and cuffs, but the color matches his eyes and somehow looks classy. “Early Christmas present?”
“It’s a cross between photography studio space and an art gallery. I take outdoor pictures, so it’ll be something new. I can try out using a ring light,” adds Jeremey.
When Dean and Cas get down to the dining room, they find Jack and Jeremy eating oatmeal, fruit and yogurt. Sam is running his juicer. Gadreel sits with a newspaper and a cup of black coffee that’s probably for show.
“One last news item, given the change in energies, I will be transitioning into overseeing the chaos and magical energy balances. Next year I will lose my title as Queen of Hell.”
It’s obvious that they understand each other very well, and both can turn on being entertaining and distracting. Although Alex gives familiar nods to Patience’s stories, they’re new to everyone else at the table, even Jack. Everyone smiles and laughs. Jeremy and Patience both seem to run out of steam though, neither being natural extroverts. That’s when Jack whispers something to Jeremy and then to Charlie, and they go to the living room to fish out a large box from under the tree.
Jack is still smiling and walks over to the foot of the bed to face Jeremy. “I think you have some crumbs.” Jeremy looks down to see crumbs on the top of the bedspread. “You know, some people don’t eat in bed because of crumbs, but you can just brush those off,” Jack says in a knowing tone. Jeremy sees where this is going and responds accordingly.
“Cas you certainly are my dearest friend,” she says, sounding very human — sincere but amused with him for some unknown reason. “It’s good to see you.” She turns to Jack and with a smile says, “Baby, I’m so excited. I’m going to be based earthside.”
“Nah, you just got pretty. Let Patience and me do the chocolate chip cookies while Dean and Cas do the fancy ones,” says Alex.
?— those were just a few he noticed clapping and whistling. There would be time to talk to everyone later.
Gadreel comes by from his perimeter check. Kelly tells him how she misses yawning and settling into a good nap, and he says that the closest he gets is focusing on the movement of time. Kelly looks unsure. Gadreel explains that it’s not human linear time, but the rivers and eddies that swirl around the space fabric like one finds in a liminal space. He thinks about it and taps her head to pass the thought. She nods and goes to the other recliner. Gadreel turns out the light and goes to heaven to check in.
“It’s no trouble,” says Dean. As soon as his hand is free, Miracle jumps into Dean’s arms. “This trouble-maker is Miracle.” It’s a bit tricky to give Jack a hug this way, but neither Miracle or Jack seem to mind getting squished against each other, and Jack gives Miracle a ruffle on his head and receives a lick or two to his face.
young people present. Sammandrial still chooses to look like Alfie, so I’d look like I was cradle-robbing — not to mention that Jack and Jeremy would likely try to make friends with him and he’d need a more detailed back story. I thought that as awkward as it might be, you are the most mature person about these things, and Gadreel did see the error of his ways and redeem himself. Gabriel said that Gadreel needed to get out more, and Adam and Amara agreed. Michael made some remark about Gadreel currently being heaven’s least embarrassing choice. ” She gives a flick of her hand indicating slight dismissal of that comment.
“Ok, as long it’s angel question and answer time, do you need to snap your fingers? Cas didn’t,” asks Sam.
“I’m taking the bunk beds, so obviously I needed pool noodles,” Kelly says with a smile in her eyes. “Jack can climb up and hang out with me occasionally. And rather than compete with Rowena on gifts, I thought we should join forces.”
Jack gets up and gets a box from the dresser that he must have just brought in, and that Jeremy hadn’t noticed. He also grabs two bottles of milk from the mini-fridge. Jeremy takes a milk container from him and scoots onto his bed to sit with his shoes very pointedly off. Jack takes the hint and sits on the edge of Jeremy’s bed so that his shoes aren’t touching the sheets. It turns out that the box is a special carrier with a handle and drawers, and Jack pulls one out. They look like fancy custom-made decorated cookies. All the typical Christmas shapes of candy canes, wreaths, and stockings are there. The gingerbread men have plaid on though.
“No, neither of them are staying overnight, and Kelly’s picking them up from a local hotel, not Denver. Maybe if her mom feels comfortable they’ll stay to dinner.”
Dean and Cas let Kelly take the lead in being mother hen, making sure that Jack and Jeremy have layers, waterproof snow pants, and all the small logistical concerns for an outing. Even if they’re college students, neither give eye rolls, or any other signs of minding Kelly’s fussing. Jack seems especially content and cheerful. When they head out the door, Kelly throws the keys to Dean, who discovers he’s driving an 8-person SUV, as she wants to join Jack and Jeremy in a 3-person row. Dean shrugs, not one to mind being the driver. He takes a couple minutes to familiarize himself with the basics on the dash. He gets some heat going, and then starts up with Cas navigating from his phone.
Cas has a smile and watery eyes, and he shifts over and embraces his husband. That might turn into a kiss that turns into another deeper kiss, and…the sound of a Demi Lovato song plays loudly.
Dean wonders if it’s strange to be so worried about about Jack being at college, considering he remade much of heaven — but then the load of being God had become too much, with both Jack and the universe threatening to crack. With Amara trying to hold everything together, it took the help of heaven, hell, and many they pulled from the empty to create a new balance, but they’ve managed to once again re-write their story. What’s a few more minor details, thinks Dean. He stands up and stretches, dislodging Miracle from his feet. Now both of them are ready for some movement, and he’s about to get one of Miracle’s toys, but Cas is back already.
“Got it,” Jack gets Miracle’s travel bed out, and puts it on the sidewalk table that’s in front of the window booth with paper table tent that reads reserved. Jeremy raises an eyebrow at Jack as he and Dean get Miracle comfy.
Cas gives another softer laugh and a smile that crinkles up by his eyes. “So what do you you two have planned for us? You told me we were taking pictures, and I know we need to leave after checkout at 11.”
Dean refocuses as Cas continues, “Since they can’t leave Heaven, I doubt it will matter. No one will be running into them.”Cas’ phone signals a text alert, and he moves quickly to retrieve his phone again, leaving Dean with his thoughts.
“Dean! I..” and Cas’ words were broken off as Dean kissed him and they held each other. When Castiel parted to look at him he said, “I never thought you would return my feelings like this.”
“Jack, are you able to get any time to play?“ Dean asks giving him an affectionate nudge with his shoulder.”
Everyone who’s staying up wanders back to the rec room, while most head for bed. Dean doesn’t stop in the kitchen to check its cleanliness.
Dean moves toward J’s mom as Jack and Cas greet J’s dad. Dean introduces himself to Mel, who seems to enjoy the mix of a firm handshake and nail polish on a man, and decides Dean is weird enough for her liking. Nathan looks at Cas and Jack as if they make sense to him, and he says to Cas, “You can call me Nat.”
“Yes. I mean he already knows what’s in your heart when you see him, but sometimes a person has say the words anyway. Cas is next on my list. I thought I should talk to you first. He’d expect me to,” Mary says with a wry smile.
Jack looks up and says, “Yeah.” He takes out his phone to check his messages again, runs a finger over the crack in the case, and then pockets it. With a smile, he says, “My mom texted earlier. She’s coming early — tonight.”
After Jack gets downstairs, everyone decides to hang out in the rec room. Jack lets them know Jeremy is calling his mom, but they’re interrupted by the group chat.
Also, still hoping to finish all this in the month of May, just not sure when it May it will be done.
“I’m gonna take video of you walking around opening day, and make you watch. Then you’ll see how every damn person there is trying to get in your pants.”
“It’s ok. Look, let’s just concentrate on the good, ordinary visions. I haven’t had those before, so maybe the world’s getting better. Anyway, no talking about my father until after the holidays. He made his choice, and I’m not ready to give him a different one.”
“I’d be happy to.” Kelly touches her forehead with a light sweeping motion. She looks thoughtful for a moment, and then brushes a finger down around the back of Gertie’s head.
They do mange to get a few of Jeremy off guard. Cas yelled, “Say story problems,” instead of “say cheese” and Jack started laughing while Jeremy had a confused expression, on par with some Dean has seen from Cas. Dean let Miracle run up and jump on him, which resulted in a smile, and him dropping the crayon. Dean also employed the sneakier strategy of taking pictures with his phone after Cas said they were all done and he had a small relieved smile.
Rowena, who has been standing, sighs and pulls up an ottoman to sit down. She says, “Some Demons are still in hell, just not allowed to work with humans. Demons are complicated because no matter how twisted and cruel, there’s a human soul underneath. They’re all a terrible amount of work. There’s only a small number of demons cleared to have contact with human souls in hell. I believe Dean and Cas have met Cecily? She’s doing quite well — proud, ambitious, yet surprisingly fair and civil — but she’s unusual. Some are becoming human. Some are going through the memory process…” Rowena shakes her head.
“Cas, can I have this dance?” Cas simply nodded and they fell together so easily. There was a smattering of applause again, but this time he saw other couples come and start dancing around them, giving them space in the middle of the floor, but some just watched and talked or waved.
Eileen somehow gives them simultaneous slaps on their arms. “Be nice. Rowena just likes being an auntie.”
Jeremy doesn’t roll his eyes, but it’s a near thing. He smiles and says, “Yeah, with people, not just landscapes. You’re the first to see.” He hands his phone over.
Dean puts out his hand for a fist bump, and they’re sealing the deal as Cas and the boys come up. “The gift shop is closed on Sundays,” Jack says.
“Hot damn. Eileen, you are so smart. If you waited for him to get up the nerve, who knows how long that would have been,” says Dean.
“Hi Aunt Rowena!” Jack bounds up and gives her a big hug. “Jack, you’re a handsome boy, but more importantly, you’re kind one,” says Rowena softly while they hug.
“Oh Dean, you went through too much, but I still have some things I still want to try to make right.”
“Yeah, Jack is good with little kids. They always like him,” says Dean. He uses the rear view mirror to make sure everyone is seated and buckled in, only to see that Sam and Eileen actually took him up on his advice and are doing some serious snuggling in the back row. Resolutely ignoring them, Dean says, “Ok, heading home.“
Jack pops back into the conversation. “I think she’s a little worried about Alex getting frustrated with college. Alex complains about USD non-stop, but she doesn’t let anyone else say anything about it, so I think she secretly likes it.”
“There was another place I liked, but it had weird, creepy antlers all over. Even antler chandeliers. I figured if we stayed there, we’d have to burn them because,” Eileen elbows him, “because they were so ugly,” Sam finishes.
Jody and Donna don’t miss what’s going on with Claire, and both of them have tears in their eyes. Donna passes Jody a napkin for her eyes and a kiss. Patience smiles and shakes her head a little.
“It’s good to be prepared. What if there’s an emergency and we have to run out? I don’t want to take time to put on my shoes.” Jack pauses and then turns toward Jeremey with his eyes narrowed. “You
“Kate-lyn is with a K. And Candy is Candace. I understand that she’s an extremely intelligent and poised young woman. They call her Candy ironically. I think her real nickname is Canada.”
Miracle has followed them up and has his head resting on one of the noodles. Jack’s got Canada’s vid ready on his laptop.
“I enjoy seeing a happy customer. Why don’t you boys take a look at the bakery case to pick one out?” She points to a case that had been hidden behind the two men at the table.
“It can wait. Once Sam gets his stuff sorted out, we can start working on getting a house to fix up and move out of the bunker. Sam will probably need us to do some work for his organization, so we’ll be busy this time next year. I’m enjoying having time with my husband and my kid.” Cas scoots closer and puts a hand on Dean’s thigh.
There's been a bit of a reboot from the canon finale, and Jack doesn't have God!powers or God!knowledge. He's a human being. Cas is also human.
“I haven’t seen a blue quite like that before, and you have some red-orange-yellow going on. My specific read is that you’re going through some stuff that it’s none of my business to know. You’ve got a lot on your mind. My general read is that you tend to be loyal and stick to things.”
Jack doesn’t feel he should say much about Jeremy’s family, so he limits it to, “Mom and the Dads went with me to meet Jeremy’s parents for lunch before they left.”
Jeremy proves to be his mother’s child by yelling “down with late-stage capitalism” in return, and gets pelted with popcorn and cheered at the same time.
Charlie starts to pass out some of Jeremy’s gifts, but the younger group wants to wait on theirs until tonight when he’s around.
“No, but I didn’t get an clear idea of what exactly that means. I’m not expecting an answer, though.” Jeremy checks the door and the room, and seeing it clear says in a soft voice, “Claire’s wrestling holds freaked me out a lot more.”
“Ok, I admit she does show how to anchor it neatly. I might not have done that, and it is for your mom so it should look nice.”
Sam answers. “They’re around somewhere. They had an impromptu girls’ night, and stayed up late — or early. They may still be in Rowena’s room.”
Dean turns to Donna and Jody. “You two have been living together — what, four months?” asks Dean with a smile and a raised eyebrow.
“Jack, I do love you. You’re my kid. You’re my son. I don’t deserve you. I don’t deserve Cas, or this life I have, but I fought for it anyway. You fought for yours. We should all enjoy this life we have. You should be happy and know we all love you.”
Canada doesn’t press for lunch details, or ask questions about the divorce. Jack thinks she’s very respectful of personal privacy and considerate. She even admits, “I’ve been laying low on texting him, ‘cause King has fewer brain cells when under stress and I didn’t want to freak him out.”
After dinner, everyone realizes that all the luggage from Baby still has to be sorted, either taken upstairs, or put away in the kitchen. Plus, Dean and Cas hide some gift bags. Jeremy is surprised when Jack puts his bags into the room with two queen beds, then sits Marvin on the bed near the door.
Ugh, retrieving phones is the worst, thinks Jeremy. He has to roll over and shove his arm into the space between the bed and the wall without being able to see what’s under there. He feels around hoping there’s nothing grosser than some lint.
I cherished my two comments, so a very special thank you! But a big thanks to everyone who stuck with this to see where it went. Thanks for your click, your time, and your attention.
Cas cocks his head. “Were you assuming that not being ‘pet friendly’ would have made any difference?”
“Finally,” he mutters as he sees Cas approaching in front of the glass door. Suddenly, there’s a strange silence in the diner as the song ends, but no instrument picks up again. Then a voice without accompanying music sings,
“They’re teenagers, so I want them close, but not too close. I wanted a little privacy for my husband and me, so definitely not adjoining rooms.”
“Kids nowadays just don’t savor the humor in torturing people with awkward situations like we do. It’s for the best,” says Dean with a wink and a smile.
For some reason that puts both Jack and Jeremy into giggles. After Dean and Cas recover from seeing Jeremy laugh for what feels like a full minute, they find that Charlie has melted, and she agrees to come. She has to pull her laptop out of her courier bag to get a reservation confirmation for the selfie museum, even though the time is sold out.
“Yeah, that was really something,” Dean says and nudges Cas’ ankle with his foot. Cas gives him an enormous smile back.
Claire and Kaia scoot off to the rec room. Patience and Alex cut through the dining room to wait at the barstools. Jack, Kelly, Cas, and Dean go to stand around in the foyer. Everyone else stays in the living room. Gertie and Miracle are already up in the alcove. Rowena has made Gadreel promise to pop in somewhere unobtrusive later. Sam and Eileen go to open the door.
