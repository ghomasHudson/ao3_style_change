‘Cas,’ Dean says, pitching his voice low and soothing. ‘Come on. You wanna leave this for the night now?’
‘I thought afterwards about - you saying you didn’t want - the things that had happened to you. That was why I was worried you-’
‘Well,’ says the guy with the accent - Dean doesn’t know him, but he’s short, sounds British - ‘That’s a sight for sore eyes.’
The cold thought curls in his stomach that maybe this is - maybe this is it. Maybe this is Cas taking what he’d wanted, before he hands Dean over to Michael for good. It grows in his belly like nausea, the longer Cas goes without answering.
‘Please,’ he says, gesturing into the church. They’re standing in the vestibule at the very entrance, and Castiel has not burst into flames yet or burned out any of the lights. He’s not sure it might not yet happen, though. ‘You’re welcome to come and look around. I haven’t made many changes - people like what they’re used to, as I’m sure you know.’
Dean lets his fingers slip out, wiping them, visibly exhausted. His eyes fall closed, lashes splayed against his cheeks, and Castiel pushes himself back into action, unfolding one of the bundled up blankets to spread over his shoulders. Dean flinches when the soft weight touches him.
It’s the second night in a row that Castiel backs out of Dean’s bedroom, cautious and faintly scandalised. It’s the second night that Dean hears him slide the bolt closed on the outside of the door, although maybe tonight it’s for a slightly different reason, like Dean’s gonna start following him around trying to defile him or profane his honour or something. Tonight, Dean lies awake on his back on the bed, and wonders if Castiel is in his own room now. On his own knees, praying.
Dean moves instinctively, then tries to fight it. It means he sort of rocks on the bed, sheet wrapped around himself, muscles tensing. Even with the heat broken, the room must stink of it; any other alpha would be wild with it. Dean’s been here for days, bringing himself off and sending out
need, stop you smearing fluids all over the upholstery. Or you can have a little hissy fit about it, and the good doctor here will have to give you a medical examination, and we’ll have an answer for the courts, so to speak. Your choice.’
Dean snorts. ‘Sit down. And you,’ he lifts down a skillet from above the range and brandishes it at Cas, ‘drink some coffee and remember some grammar before you get bossy. Is Bobby up?’
Cas doesn't look like he's seeing anything at the moment. It's the same sort of wild-eyed, terrified expression he had when he walked out of the service, earlier, like he's not really in there.
He bucks upwards; one hand scrabbles for Castiel’s arm at his neck, and something in Castiel snaps, forces him higher up against the table until Dean’s feet kick urgently to find purchase against the floor, against anything. Why does he keep
Crowley shrugs. ‘It would draw a lot of attention, though, if you testified. You’d have to leave it a week to start things moving, anyway, until after the election. I’d go down the physical evidence route.’
He gasps when Michael is suddenly upon him - the slam of a hand against the wall, and Dean’s back hitting it hard, so that the edge of the paneling jabs into his spine; Michael lets his scent off leash for just an instant, hard with rage and dominance, and Dean hears himself yelp. Michael holds his face close to Dean’s, dark and cold.
Her eyes flick to the Bible on the nightstand. ‘I bet. Come on; downstairs. Don’t get used to me cooking you breakfast, I’m not here every day and when I am I’ve got better things to do, so this is gonna be your job. But a couple of eggs isn’t gonna hurt either of us. You know your way around a range at all? I’ll talk you through it.’
It doesn’t matter. Cas is his alpha, even without a bite. It’s his alpha who slides inside him, fits their bodies tight until they’re skin to skin, sweat sticking them together. It’s his alpha who ruts against him, rocking Dean against the mattress and gasping against the shell of his ear. It’s his alpha whose knot catches at Dean’s oversensitive rim, who pants and kisses and groans, ‘I love you, I love you, I love you-’ as he comes inside him, and holds him, and stays.
Dean’s past answering. He doesn’t argue, and when he sees his narrow, iron framed bed in front of him, he collapses face first onto it and passes out almost immediately.
It’s not a sexual dream, so it’s okay. When he wakes up, his cock is soft between his thighs - it’s the first thing he’s aware of, straight away, the horrifying fear that his body might have reacted, that they’ll have to take him back to the hospital and begin it all again. He thinks he might die if they begin it all again.
‘Yes,’ says Castiel, uncertainly. ‘Sorry.’ Is it usual to engage the horse in conversation? He does not wish to be impolite.
Patient engaged in regular electrical stimulation and aversion therapy as usual: for the first time since the photographic plate was provided by the Patient’s mother, images were included of the omega male with whom the Patient imagines himself bonded. The Patient reacted most violently and was further restrained with a harness.
Dean backs up so far the back of his knees hit a padded armchair, and the British guy says loudly, ‘Oh,
Naomi nods, understandingly. ‘Eventually. But, Dean, you can’t expect him to be the same. You have to think about what’s best for him. Castiel understands that. He wants to get better.’
‘Stop it,’ Cas growls again, and he’s close now, close enough that Dean can feel the heat of his breath against his skin, close enough that he can tilt his hips towards him to make Cas flinch, close enough that when Cas jars the bottle again Dean’s mouth chases after it, messy and needy and fucking pathetic. Amber liquid splashes against his collarbone, runs down the neck of his shirt.
His thoughts are on Dean during the journey. His thoughts are always on Dean, now. It is some sort of illness, he thinks. Some sort of sickness in his blood. Some sort of weakness he possesses that the rest of his family does not, that he dares not speak of for fear it will become all the more real. Instead, he recites scripture under his breath over and over as if casting a spell, weaving words around him, some sort of holy shield.
‘Didn’t mean it as an insult. Did you put anything on your face, yesterday?’ She hands him a cup of coffee and doesn’t wait for him to answer. ‘There’s vinegar in the larder; I’ll mix some up with water and make a cold compress.’
He’s expecting an argument, or a snide comment at best; he’s not expecting Dean’s face to light up as he approaches the horses. He’s wearing his usual shirtsleeves and worn pants, but in concession to the late spring warmth he has rolled the sleeves to his elbows and foregone the vest, which Castiel isn’t sure would be appropriate if they had guests - or if he were a stricter master - but they don’t, and he isn’t. Castiel had assumed Dean could ride, based on the stories of his travelling lifestyle as a youth, but it hadn’t occurred to him that Dean might enjoy it, or that Dean might - as he is now - smooth a gentle, blunt-fingered hand across the neck of the black horse and croon, ‘Hello, sweetheart. Hello, gorgeous. What are you doing here?’
He knocked on Dean’s front door several times, but there was no answer. He checked his watch again to make sure he was there on time, and when he looked up Dean had opened the door, standing there barefoot in jeans, chest and hair wet from a recent shower and his face freshly shaven. Castiel gulped.
Sam took himself in hand and slowly fed his cock into Cas' sloppy hole. Dean's come squished around his dick, adding to the warmth surrounding him. When he bottomed out, Cas moaned, Dean capturing the sound with his lips. Grasping the primary bones of his wings, Sam started a steady slide in and out of Castiel, using his wings to pull him back onto his cock. He watched as Dean kissed Cas deeply, swallowing the sounds the angel made and pushing his hips up in counter to Sam's own motion. Once again the pace picked up and all three participants became frantic for more friction to push them towards release. Castiel broke the kiss with Dean to yell out Sam's name as he came again, Dean following him over the edge. The tight squeeze of Castiel's ass was all it took to make Sam's hips stutter as he came into the angel, adding to his brother's load.
“I’ll even let you set the whole thing up, sit next to me, whatever it takes to make you feel okay about this, Dad,” MJ told him. “We need that information.”
"Remember when we first found out about Chuck's books, and during our research we found out about Sam girls and Dean girls and Sam-slash-Dean girls?" Dean grimaced and nodded. "Well, since Becky posted Chuck's unpublished works online, the fans have developed what they call OTPs-One True Pairings. The majority of the fans seem to think that you and Cas are destined to be together." Dean and Castiel side-eyed each other at that.
“Probably both,” Gabriel replied. “Like I said, time is a fickle thing. They gave me all the information we need to figure out where the problems started, what the results were, and where we could fix it so when they go back to their own time things will be different, hopefully better.”
Dean was warm and comfortable. For a change, he awoke slowly, savoring the heavy feel of his limbs and the fuzziness of his mind. He pulled the blanket up closer to his chin as he tried to slip back into his delicious dreams, but it was a much thicker blanket than he'd had on his bed before. Cracking an eye open, he saw he was holding the top of Castiel's wing, which had been draped over his naked body. He rolled his head to one side to see Cas watching him, and the angel's mouth quirked up at one corner.
He took a couple bags from Cas and led him back to the kitchen, exaggerating his bowlegged stride. He wanted to get Cas good and riled up, see what the normally prim and proper man would do. Dean pulled out cheese and ground beef and bacon while Cas pulled out veggies and a strange Tupperware container.
, Dean, is your prostate." Fingers deep inside Dean, he gently rubbed at the bundle of nerves, alternating pressure to test the various inhuman sounds he could pull from the man. Dean tried to move his hips against Cas' hand, but Cas held him firmly to the bed with his angelic strength. Cas slowly increased the pressure and speed until Dean's dick was leaking a steady stream of precome and tears were streaming down his face, begging for release.
Using the pan Cas used to saute the peppers and onions, Dean quickly toasted the insides of the buns and put them on plates. Before he could start building his burger, Cas instructed him to grab them some beers and relax while he finished up. Dean grabbed the beers, but instead of sitting he hovered over Cas as he built the burgers, slathering on the chipotle mayo before putting on the burgers and stacking them with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, peppers, and onions. They both heaped fried potatoes onto their plates and sat at the table to eat.
working emotionlessly as he always had, because he knew Gabriel was feeling emotional enough for everyone in the room.
Lucifer took another step towards MJ, putting a hand on her shoulder. “You’re not so bad, kid. Come visit me sometime, will ya?”
When the song ended, Castiel sat there dwelling on the lyrics. He could feel the shift in consciousness as he replayed it and listened again, from naïve youth to wisdom as the song progressed. Yes, he definitely enjoyed this music, and he clicked the link for the next song from the group.
Samyaza reappeared about a hundred yards away. He held a wicked-looking sword, like a scimitar. Definitely not standard issue from Heaven. He crouched low into a coiled attack position, the black ichor slowly dripping from his neck and leaving droplets in the sand. Gabriel imitated his stance, rotating his sword by the wrist a few times. A pained look flashed across Gabriel’s face, then both beings began their charge towards the other, swords held high.
“Love you too, Daddy.” Everyone laughed at that, happy that while their entire timeline had been rewritten, some things would never change.
Sam and Gabriel just stood there, looking between Dean and each other, trying to figure out what the hell happened.
Sam took the ring from Castiel and flipped it around in his hand, examining it. It was completely plain, not too thin or too girly for his brother, and on the inside of the band was inscribed a single word:
"That would be it!" Gabriel said, pointing a finger at Sam. "Now we just gotta find which ones have a Sam and Dean Winchester that teenage girls obsess over and narrow it down to the right one. Difficult, but it shouldn't be as hard as actually getting there."
Tagging for violence and major character death (but it's Supernatural, so take it with a ring of salt).
"These boys know there are no more chances," Billie told Gabriel, "and they know they're not going anywhere but the void. Let him go."
Cas nodded agreeably. After wiping his mouth and fingers of grease, he reached under his seat to pull the music from his own bag. “Why is the piece called
“Dean-o! Sammy’s up, and the docs say he’s gonna be a hundred percent in no time. His memory might be wonky for a while, but it’ll all come back to him.” Gabriel gave Dean a hug as well, though much briefer. “Kiddo doesn’t remember the fight you guys had, though, so please tell me you kissed and made up and are still doing the show.”
“No, assholes blew their way into the bunker a few months back, damned near killed Uncle Sam. As long as Samyaza and his goon squad are still out there, we’re on lockdown.” MJ was in a full sulk now.
Gabe lifted a finger and opened his mouth to argue with Cas, but Sam interrupted him. “What I want to know is what kind of deal I made with Rufus to make them both First Chair.”
Dean and Castiel were maybe about two hours from the bunker when they got the call. Gabriel’s grace has recovered enough that he could have gotten them and the car home, but they still had two items on their
Gabriel cupped her face in his hands and lifted her eyes to his. "What happened to you, sweetheart?"
Something else niggled at the edge of Sam's thoughts. "What do you mean, before Bobby comes into his true power?"
“Gimme my boy,” Dean said, holding his arms out to take Sammy from MJ. He smiled at the weight of his son that he hadn’t seen in twenty years. He pulled on Cas’ grace through their bond and tickled Sammy with it, making him giggle and his wings pop out. Twenty years of being bonded to his angel had taught Dean a trick or two, and now he stared at his son in wonder and pride as he examined the tiny wings. They were so much like’s Cas’, inky black, but rather than the iridescence of Cas’ wings, Sammy’s were tipped with a shimmery jade green.
. He was so fucking sick and tired of all the shit raining down on his family. He was sick of all the bullshit in the world. He resented Chuck for putting them in the middle of all the supernatural shit, expecting them to be that fucking firewall between the light and the dark, resented him for not being there for the world he created.
. Everyone knew Dean was a flirt, even thought he was a player because of it. Fact of the matter is, Dean wasn’t a man-whore; he liked the chase, but the follow-through left a lot to be desired. The people he pursued tended to be lacking in one way or another, and he couldn’t force himself past it.
Dean moaned when Cas’ tongue ran along the roof of his mouth, making him shiver. Deepening the kiss, his hands snaked around Cas’ waist and pulled him tight against him. Both men breathed heavily through their noses to avoid breaking the kiss, but as Cas squirmed for air their groins made contact and both of their eyes widened at the feel of each other’s erections.
“There he is!” Dean yelled, running into the room and grabbing Sammy from his brother. “Little guy seriously freaked me out! Gabriel,” he said, turning to the archangel, “anything we can do to keep him still while we’re holding him?”
“Uh huh,” Dean said, “I just bet you are.” With the innuendo, Sam started turning several shades of red, making Gabriel and Dean laugh. “Seriously Sammy, are you
take care of him, then attempt to get him to sleep." Dean got up and followed Cas, mumbling something about giving Cas a hand. As the two men left the room with the baby,Gabriel and Sam exchanged eye-rolls.
Cas smiled wide at him. He turned around to face the car, pushing Dean to do the same, so the garage lights were at their backs. Cas closed his eyes, his grace flaring just enough to brighten all the lights without popping the bulbs. Dean looked at Sammy in awe, seeing the faint shadows of his son’s wings against the car. They reminded him of the little cherub wings he’d seen on greeting cards. He reached out to where he though the wings might be, but although he didn’t feel anything baby Sammy laughed and clapped his hands together.
"I believe it's affecting me as well," Cas replied. "I'm unable to move at the moment. Maybe if we act as though we're giving into it, we can break free of it before it takes hold."
He closed his eyes and thought about kissing Cas last night. He could get lost in that man’s mouth. Dean dragged a hand up his naked hip, Cas’ hand there in his mind’s eye. He could almost pretend it was Cas touching him, and his dick stirred beneath the sheets.
Finally remembering that the trumpet player was the one who dragged Sam over to introduce to Cas, he replied, “yeah, he’s my kid brother. How do you know short stack here?” He heard the short blonde humph at the comment, but he just grinned widely.
"Hey, Cas," Dean said, "all's well that ends well in the state of Misery. I'm gonna grab a shower then hit the rack."
As Dean was taking his next turn, Sam tried distracting him by saying “so, MJ and Kevin?” The horseshoe slipped from Dean’s hand, falling far short of the post. He looked up at his brother’s smirk and said, “dude, don’t make me think about it.”
scream of rage he threw his phone across the room, shattering it against the far wall. He stalked to the fridge and pulled out a beer, popping the top and taking a swig before he started pacing the room.
“Angels and Nephilim are conceived only by bonded pairs, regardless of gender. Conception occurs when their graces, or when grace and soul in the case of an angel/human pair, converge in a moment of pure love, happiness, and ecstasy. In humans, the body is formed first and the soul follows. In angels and Nephilim, the grace is formed first and the body follows.”
MJ smiled at that. "I'll take Sammy while you take care of Papa. You need anything, just yell." She looked at Gabriel and Kevin, making head motions towards the door. They got the hint and they all left the room, closing the door behind them.
no one was mentioning that, although Cas still had his own room, he was sleeping in Dean's room every night.
When the boys returned to the bunker, they found Mary, Gabriel, and the kids in front of the television, but Sammy was nowhere to be seen. Dean had assumed the baby was with Cas and went to find them, but Sam stopped him. It looked like his family planned some kind of intervention.
"Either way, it means we need to resolve their timeline and get them back to their own time as quickly as possible. There is no telling what effect he will have on events in our own time," Cas reasoned.
Bobby shrugged. “Pops started putting instruments in my hands when I was a baby. This is the only thing that stuck,” he said, holding up the guitar. “I think he really started teaching me when I was five or six.”
MJ straightened her shoulders and closed the distance between her and Kevin before looping one arm through his elbow. “We have a date,” MJ said confidently, chin held high. “Kevin’s taking me to New York for dinner and to see
And with that thought stuck in his head, he checked out Cas' hair every time the angel checked in with him.
"Like that, Sammy?" Gabriel whispered playfully in his ear. He gave another gentle tug, getting another gorgeous moan out of the man.
"By getting Kevin involved and getting that list of Grigori, we had already made a small difference in the future," Dean told them. "Now we have a more definite target-Samyaza."
“How else were we to survive?” he asked, anger creeping into his voice. “We were cut off from Father and the rest of the Host. We were slowly becoming mortal. Without our grace, we would not have been able to protect our families. We brought them into this
the vacant eyes. With remorse for the loss of yet another brother but the satisfaction of winning the battle, he told Samyaza “justice has been served.”
“I do have my files and notes on the Thule in my bags, if you would all like to help me look over them. Perhaps we can help each other to eliminate both threats,” Toni offered.
Sam was reclined on the couch, book in hand and a pile next to him on the floor. The poltergeist would have to wait, because whatever the hell was going on now had to be addressed before whatever this was escalated.
“Actually,” Cas argued, “I think it is a very good idea. Since she is a Nephilim, she may be less susceptible than you as a human or I as a full angel. Between my ‘angel mojo’,” of course Cas used air quotes, “her strength and speed, and your skills, it would be much easier for us to handle the witches as a team than to let you and Sam handle it on your own.”
If anyone had noticed that Dean and Cas stood a little too close to each other now, smiled at each other a little more, or brushed against each other more often than could be considered casual, no one was mentioning it. And
Still holding both of Cas’ hands in his left hand, Dean stood and pushed his chair back before getting down on one knee and pulling the little black velvet box from his pants pocket.
Gabriel dropped his arms to his sides, moving his sword out from between himself and Sam. Sam reached up and removed Gabriel’s headphones, hearing faint strains of
"Not gonna last, Cas," Dean panted. "Need you to come for me, angel. Come on, wanna feel you come on my cock." And that was it for Cas-he arched his back and his head slammed back into the pillow as he screamed Dean's name, his tight hole clamping down on Dean's cock, thick streams of come shooting from his dick and coating his chest, running over Dean's hand.
“It’s not a bad idea though,” Sammy said, smiling up at Gabe. “How about we call it a long engagement and see where it goes?
“NO! No, I mean… crap, let me start over. We let you in, and it was weird at first not just being me and Sammy, but we got used to it. Then we liked having you around. Then we didn’t like when you
"Guy looks like a douche," Dean muttered, earning him a frown from Gabriel, and he shut the door loudly behind them. They all turned to him with a
“Long story short,” the boy said, “we’re from the future, twenty years from today; our bloodline is already tuned to the wards and we don’t need a key.” He took a breath and looked at the girl. “You wanna read them into the game?”
Before Sam could reply, screaming started over at Lady Antonia’s casket. They watched a few bodies fly, reaching for weapons that they weren’t carrying, not expecting to need them. Gabriel dropped both his angel blade and archangel sword into his hands, tossing his angel blade to Sam. Castiel dropped his angel blade into his hand, tossing it to Dean and leaving himself defenseless.
“Sure Sam, talk to me,” Gabriel said, coming into the room and taking a seat next to Sam. Sam was taken aback by the lack of a nickname, which made him think maybe Gabriel was going to be serious about this.
“For God’s sake,” Dean said, wandering in with a beer in his hand. “Take the bitch on a date if it will keep him from whining. You guys should be okay if you stick close to home.”
. The leaves stemming from it were hearts, and it was all set in a deep jade green. When Gabriel looked at the inscription inside the band, he burst out laughing. Confused, Sam took it from him, and when he read the inscription for himself, he turned several shades of red and face-palmed himself.
“Seriously, Sam. Cas knows better. I’m not saying that Gabriel doesn’t, but he’s older than dirt. Maybe he just didn’t care because he remembered what it was like at the beginning; Cas wasn’t around for that, so he didn’t know what he was missing.” Dean clapped him on the shoulder with a lewd grin. “Think of it this way Sammy, you’re so damned good you made an archangel think with the head between his legs instead of the one on his shoulders.”
Sam smiled. “Awesome. Dean sent us a gift basket. I think he liked the results of the information we gave Cas.”
He was happy that Gabriel had found Sam. Sam was a good man-smart, funny, kind-hearted. Gabriel was all of those things as well, but he was flighty. Sam grounded him, and Castiel was pleased with the effect Dean’s brother had on his cousin.
Bobby snatched the phone from Sam. “Did she try the whole ‘Daughter picks the music, Daddy shuts his cakehole’ thing on you?”
Crowley huffed. "Very well, my dear. Until next time," he said with a snap of his fingers, and disappeared.
“I do know,” he said, standing up. He held a hand out to pull MJ up, too. “But you’re a smart cookie, you’ll figure it out. Now, tell me what you brought me, before your feathered cousin comes to take you away from me again.”
the hem of her skirt and pulled a wicked-looking blade from a garter sheath, a look of surprise on her sons’ faces.
They spent some time catching up with Claire, hearing about her classes and the lore she'd been reading up on. It made Castiel and Dean both happy to hear she was getting smarter about hunting. They both still worried about what would happen to her, how she became the badass hunter the kids knew in the future, how she got that scar, but for now she was happy, healthy, safe, and being her usual bratty self.
Dean took another sip of his coffee, smiling bigger than his brother ever remembered him doing. “I’m feeling great man, better than ever.”
“Is he even old enough to drink?” Sam asked Dean. Then he looked at Kevin and asked, “are you old enough to drink?”
“Not bad, kid.” A skinny guy with a beard sat down next to him on the park bench, startling Bobby. He’d been so absorbed it seemed like the guy came out of nowhere. “’Course, you’re hitting those strings a little hard. Something bothering you?”
Dean thought to himself as he cranked up the radio and pulled the tarp off the old ‘67 Impala. Iron Maiden’s
“Hello Dean, Sam,” Cas said, addressing Dean more than Sam. “I’m glad you have both made it back safely.”
“Thanks Cas,” Dean smiled at him. “Wasn’t as bad as we thought it would be, just a wendigo. Some Trekkie thought it might have actually been a Klingon.” Dean laughed. “Wrong Broken Bow. We caught it sleeping and were able to take it down and burn the
"So let me get this straight," Kevin said, no pun intended, "Bobby is from a long-cultivated bloodline of hunters, Men of Letters, a descendant of Cain, the son of Lucifer's true vessel, and the son of an archangel?" He turned to Bobby, grinning and shaking his head. "Dude, no wonder your ass was being hunted. Once you come into your true power, you're practically the Second Coming. I wish I could write this all down!"
Sam took his turn hugging her, then grinned at her sheepishly. "We wanted to introduce you to the family."
And then there was Cas. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get the image of the angel on his knees out of his head; his chapped lips stretched obscenely around his dick, sky blue eyes glassy and framed by full, dark lashes. And then there was the hair. Dean hadn't grabbed Cas' hair, didn't touch a single strand, but when he stood up his hair looked liked he had just been thoroughly fucked. Did it always look like that?
Gabriel wandered into the kitchen looking for food he didn’t have to snap up. He wished he could snap himself up a large stack of pancakes with real maple syrup, chocolate chips, and whipped cream with a large mocha latte, extra syrup and extra sugar, but he fucked up so now he had to deal with the fallout.
She took a step back, eyeing Lucifer warily. “If that’s where he is, why would you tell me? Is it a trap?”
MJ's hair was back to shoulder length, this picture obviously a stolen selfie sitting behind the wheel of the Impala, grinning like a madwoman.
Sam’s bad mood at his surprise being spoiled melted. Dean was practically bouncing now, like he always did with a new piece like this. It was getting harder and harder to find sheet music for the cello for the kind of music Dean enjoyed, so he’d taken to transposing it for him. It gave him something to do in his spare time other than spending too much time in his own mind, and he wasn’t about to talk with Dean about what’s been going on with him lately.
Gabriel hopped out of bed, snapping his fingers to clean up the evidence of their early morning lovemaking. Sam propped himself up on his elbow and watched as Gabriel walked to their dresser naked and start pulling out clothes. "What do we have going on today?" he asked.
Castiel just sat up and shrugged. "If that's your choice, Dean. I'll just go find Sam and see if he has paired up with Gabriel or not. He may be amenable to 'hooking up', and he is very well endowed."
Sam didn’t know where to start. “I’m concerned we’re not more-I don’t know, skeptical?-about this whole situation. You know, our future kids showing up, their whole story. We’ve all just accepted it as truth without doing any kind of digging. I mean, there’s not much we can dig into considering it’s about the future and not the past, but still, when do we ever take anything at face value? And since when do good things come into our lives that don’t turn out to be something trying to destroy us? And then there’s the fact that they hedge on any personal questions. I feel like they’re hiding things from us, things that will affect us. It worries me. We’ve been through so much crap we should be able to see through any bullshit, but I’m just not seeing any. It’s a lot to deal with, and I just don’t know how to.”
They sat there in the library for another hour, alternately flipping through notes and books and sounding theories off each other when Cas' head popped up. He tilted his head to one side, looking down the hall to where Dean was. Then his face crumpled and he disappeared. A second later, they heard Cas scream like he was dying.
Once again, Sam and Gabriel were hiding in their room. It wasn’t a grace-filled sex-fest like last time, but more taking the time to heal each other’s wounds. When the sun went down and the stars came out, they slept tangled up in each other. While Castiel and Mary sifted through notes on the Grigori, they told stories to each other of their lives before they were an ‘us’. While MJ was in the nursery with Baby Sammy trying to get him to sit up on his own, they simply touched each other and breathed each other’s air. And while Bobby sat in his room trying to comprehend his parent’s evolution, they whispered promises to each other that one day they’d be the best parents ever.
Sam looked at Dean and Cas; they were looking at each other, Dean's arm over Cas' shoulder and their foreheads touching, seeming to have an entire silent conversation with their eyes. He wondered if that was part of their bond, once again feeling a small pang of jealousy.
“But if we change anything about their timeline, will they remember that, or will they remember what they went through the first time?” Sam asked.
Dean from the past inched slowly towards Cas. "Hey angel, you doing okay?" he asked. "I'm still learning about all this angel crap, but seeing short stack standing over you with that angel blade scared the shit outta me. You wanna read my mind, make sure you can trust me before you show off that peanut?"
After about a minute, the hall erupted in loud applause and wolf whistles. The conductor hit the podium with his baton to clear the noise, but when he announced, “First chair goes to Castiel Novak,” the room became a cacophony of clapping again. Dean slammed his cello into his case and stormed off, Charlie eyeing both men before following Dean.
With a smirk and a cocked eyebrow, the archangel said “Property of Gabriel.” Sam just laughed and pulled him in for another kiss.
He had no idea when he started developing an infatuation on the man, but he found himself smiling, thinking that maybe it was time for him to get into a little trouble.
And just like that, relief flooded his body. If you asked Castiel, Dean’s smile was brighter than the sun as he took the box back from him and pulled the ring out.
It was finally over. The Grigori were no more, Lucifer was back in the cage, and Crowley wouldn’t be coming after the kids. The Thule had been eliminated, and Kevin came back to MJ. Everything appeared to have been set right; it was time to get back to the bunker and make preparations to get the kids back to their own time.
That made Sam laugh, really laugh. As much as he loved his expanded family, sometimes he missed the times when it was just him and his brother. There were times on the road, between hunts, when they would talk, laugh, cut-up, and just be brothers. He’d have to convince Dean to do this more often.
"Hey Cas," Dean said, licking his lips, "I think you might wanna take off. I think that compulsion thing is hitting me again."
Gabriel slowly lowered her back to the bed, holding her close and dragging his lips across her face in pseudo-kisses of sorts. "You okay, sweetheart?"
"I really am your favorite, aren't I?" Gabriel asked playfully, quickly nipping at her other nipple, making her squirm.
“It’s an amazing movie,” Sam insisted. “It’s a World War II movie set in Germany, about two boys as close as brothers who are rebelling against Hitler’s Germany and the Nazis using American music and dancing.”
“It might be a moot point,” Sam told him, “we found out Bobby isn’t a viable vessel. He can’t be possessed by an angel, even if he does give consent.”
The guy heaved a sigh, pulling the guitar from Bobby and picking at the strings as he talked. “Family,
Cas chuckled. “I don’t see what good that would do,” he said, “but if it makes you feel better, I’ll hold him down for you.” Dean laughed at that and turned to kiss his angel on the cheek.
“Don’t threaten me with that bitch,” Crowley spat. “I remember the spell, I have the ingredients, but there’s just no incentive for me to do anything about your little…
“Come on!” Sam growled in frustration. “You always pick the movie. Let me have a chance, will you? Besides, it has Christian Bale in it. You loved him as
"Everyone agreed that if they were going to help care for Samuel that he should have his own room, so as not to disturb us," Cas told him. "I know you value your personal space, but since I spend more time in your room than mine I have moved my things into your room. I hope that does not bother you." Cas looked calm as ever, but Dean could feel he was worried about his reaction. Dean was actually just surprised he hadn't thought of that sooner.
He turned to Dean. “When you saw how well MJ fought, how strong she was, how she kept a level head, you allowed her to hunt with you and Uncle Cas. Hunting people, saving things, the family business. She was ecstatic, because all she ever wanted was to be like you.” Dean’s ego went through the roof at that. “She saved your butt on more than one occasion because you were too lazy to do your research or you rushed in with a ‘kill them all, let God sort them out’ attitude.” And there went Dean’s pride, right down the drain.
"Yeah," he said hoarsely, "they're great. They're awesome. She pulled that 'Daughter picks the music, Daddy shuts his cakehole' thing on me though, had to endure almost three hours of rap. It was touch and go, but we all survived."
"I had not thought to ask what has become of Claire in the future," he said with shame in his voice.
Another blast shook the bunker. Kevin grabbed MJ's hand and started running down the hall, Mary following with the baby. Bobby held his ground with the two angels.
“How about we work on my aim in a little bit,” he asked Sam. “Pops, think we can check my flight status?”
Gabe beamed and leaned down to capture Sammy’s lips in his, prompting Dean to drag Cas out of the room to leave the two lovebirds alone. He never let go of Cas’ hand though, thanking his lucky stars for all their good fortune, and praying he didn’t just jinx himself.
Dean watched with his hand wrapped around his dick. He felt as though he were touch-starved and crawling out of his skin. If he didn't fit himself in there somewhere he was gonna die, figuratively and literally. With a little maneuvering, he pressed himself up against the wall by Cas and slid down, getting on his knees between the angel and the wall. It took him a minute to get Cas' dick in his mouth, considering the force of both Gabriel's and Sam's thrusts, and when he finally managed it he was seeing stars from his head hitting the wall. Castiel reached down with one hand to cup Dean's head to prevent further injury.
Time ceased to exist. Dean picked up his pace to accommodate Cas' cries of "please" and "more", which soon turned into "faster" and "harder", pulling Cas' legs over his shoulders and pistoning into him, hitting his prostate every few strokes. Their breaths became moans which became cries of ecstasy as they got closer and closer to the edge. Dean wanted Cas to come before he did, so he reached out and started stroking Cas' leaking erection. Dean didn't know a man could get so wet, the amount of precome providing a slick glide as he brought his angel closer to his orgasm.
"It's just weird seeing Dean being so open and tactile," Sam explained. "He's always buried his emotions, especially since he carries all that guilt and feels like he doesn't deserve happiness or good things. I guess Cas is helping him see he does, and I'm happy for them."
Dean looked over his shoulder at Gabriel, who nodded back. He turned back to Crowley and said, “I believe MJ’s original offer was you don’t harm the Winchester line, we don’t harm the MacLeod line. Take it or we start searing the place with holy light.”
“That puppet master demon was trying to get our attention,” he explained. “He was expecting you and me to show up, then was gonna use a pair of those mind control bracelets to make one of us kill the other. He wasn’t expecting Cas or MJ to show up. One human, one angel, and one Nephilim is way different than trying to mess with two humans. MJ and I totally kicked ass, while Cas exorcised his demon ass back to Hell.”
"The bad fish taco was just for shits and giggles," Gabriel said, another gumdrop sailing into his mouth. "Nothing like playing to urban legends."
Raising his other arm, Dean pulled Sam close to him, offering what comfort he could. "It's gonna be okay, Sammy," he whispered, stroking Sam's hair. He pressed kisses to Sam's temple until he felt him relax against his side. When Sam looked up into his brother's eyes, the mood shifted from one of comfort to one of need.
Castiel’s anger grew as they prepared to play. Had Dean played on his affections merely to secure his place in the hierarchy? His current attitude certainly seemed to support the theory.
Dean laughed at that story; yeah, he could definitely see himself protecting that car as much as his own child. “What were you driving after you got your license?”
Gabriel grabbed another bundle of black rope and proceeded to tie the lower harness just as he described. However, as his hands worked the rope, Gabe’s hands wandered. He stroked Sam’s skin, fingers straying to his half-hard dick, over his testes, and along the crack of his ass. Once done, he slid two fingers under the rope and ran them around to make sure nothing was too tight or pulling on anything it shouldn’t.
Dean slammed back his beer before saying, “I don’t wanna talk about it,” getting up and leaving the room. Castiel did the same with his bottle of tequila. “Neither do I,” he said, and followed Dean. MJ just heaved a frustrated sigh. It was gonna be so much fun around here until her dads pulled their heads out of their asses.
Gabriel and Cas looked at each other briefly before Gabriel explained, “the kids are getting worried about their timeline. They miss their families and are worried about them.”
Cas ran his hands around Dean to stroke his back. “These make me feel more desirable,” Cas stated simply.
Gabriel snorted. "I didn't choose this vessel for its height," he said with a smirk before turning back to grab another book.
“C’mon Cas,” he said, holding out his hand to help his friend up, “let’s go get to know our daughter.”
Mary looked at her son in sympathy. She had never wanted her boys to grow up knowing about the monsters that hid in the dark, and she definitely had not wanted to see them become hunters. However, after seeing the men Sam and Dean had become in her absence, she couldn’t see them any other way and couldn’t be more proud of them. She hoped that Dean would be able to have his own child hunting with them, and be able to focus on the hunt instead of trying to protect his daughter.
“You’re very perceptive,” Sam tells him, wrapping an arm around his son’s shoulders. “You’re right, that’s been on my mind a lot lately.”
Alone now and not knowing what to do with himself, he looked around the room he was standing in. There was a fairly new drum kit, and Castiel wondered who got the most use out of it. He saw the cello that Dean regularly used at practice, sitting next to an electric cello. He had never tried one before, never having the desire nor the opportunity, and wondered how it sounded. Then there was the piano. He admired the old Steinway baby grand set up to one side of the room, chuckling at the thought of Sam’s large frame sitting there. Sitting on top was a couple stacks of handwritten sheet music, and Castiel indulged his curiosity by flipping through the pages. He was a fan of Sean Connery as James Bond and had never seen a Bond movie that he wasn’t in, but he knew the theme to
“Oh, come on Cassie!” Gabriel chided, jumping down from his perch on the counter. “It’s easy to explain!”
This one's a little more non-con than the others, because really, Dean should know better than to piss off Gabriel. Doesn't mean he didn't like it though ;)
He grinned up at Sam and said, “Cassie got me a gift!” with pride. Sam was curious and tried to peek in the bag, but Gabriel playfully slapped his hand away. “Nuh uh, mine.” Sam gave him the sad puppy dog face and Gabriel rolled his eyes at him. “I don’t know about you, but I’m ready to take a break.” Sam nodded and took his angel’s hand, trying to sneak a peek in the bag he was holding.
“But what if you’re not?” Bobby asks, pretty sure this became more about the guy than about him. “Right, I mean.”
Castiel turned his face to look into Dean’s eyes and rest his forehead against his hunter’s. “For you, Dean.” Dean thanked him with a quick peck on the lips.
As it turned out, Castiel and Dean had very similar tastes in books. They ordered coffees from the Starbucks and sat and talked for several hours about Vonnegut, Safran, Robbins, and more eclectic contemporary books like
Sam joined Gabriel, his mom, his brother, and Castiel in the kitchen about twenty minutes later. He was confused because everyone was just hanging around but there wasn’t any food or drink out anywhere.
“I’m in love with a human,” Gabriel said with a small shrug, trying not to wake up the baby. “Anything that puts a smile on Sammy’s face is worth knowing.” He took another long sip of his beer, popping his lip off the top of the bottle.
"Danel, Anane, Turel, it's been a long time," Gabriel said, "but not long enough. You don't have any business being here."
Dean sat down on Cas' other side, giving him a shoulder bump and chuckling. "Yeah, and you especially don't have to apologize for your wings, dude. They're badass."
“That’s okay, I can work with that!” Gabriel said excitedly. “There’s a ballroom dance school out in Wichita that hosts dance nights. If we leave pretty quick, we can grab some dinner before it starts!” When Sam sighed and waved his hand, Gabriel shot out of the room to get ready.
Castiel also laughed, which surprised Kevin because he had never seen Castiel laugh before. He tried to get Dean to repeat the ‘pull my finger’ joke, but Dean laughed too, saying he didn’t want to lose power when they were all drunk. Gabriel all-out guffawed at the thought of Cas doing that.
When Cas' whines and moans reached a fever pitch, Dean pulled back and sat up. He grabbed Cas' hips and started pounding into him relentlessly, making Cas cry out and
glad I wasn’t there for that conversation,” Bobby admitted to MJ. “I wouldn’t have been able to keep from making jokes.”
Gabriel slowly reached for the hilt of his sword. “It was too high of a cost, brother, and it damned you all.” In one swift movement, Gabriel pulled his sword from its scabbard as he turned, bringing the tip of the blade to Samyaza’s throat on the upswing. He held steady, the tip biting into his opponent’s flesh. Where there would be the bluish-white of grace, there was black ichor slowly trickling from the wound. “It has to stop.”
Crowley walked back to the booth, cocking his head to one side as he sensed what she was. "A Nephilim with Dean Winchester's phone. Does he know?"
“This is quite excellent,” Cas said sincerely. “Your brother is an amazing composer. While I would never deem his choice of careers a waste, I will say that should he ever decide to pursue composition and arrangement full time, he would be highly paid and fervently sought out.”
They knocked on the door, and MJ opened it. She gestured them in, closing it behind them. “We gonna wake her up now?” MJ asked. “Kinda wanna to know what bastards did this to her so we can kill them.”
"I'm guessing whatever's been messing with us pulled his wings out," Sam said. "There's a lot of wing kink in the online fanfiction."
“Hey, Papa,” MJ said, “can I see your angel blade a sec?” She really hoped this went the way she thought it would. Cas just tilted his head at her for a moment before flipping it in his hand and handing it to her. Once in her hand, she walked over to her dad and drug the blade over the arm not holding Sammy, causing a thin line of blood to surface.
Sammy popped out of Dean’s hands again, back into Sam’s lap. Dean huffed and picked him up again, but Sammy just popped right back to his Uncle Sam. “I’m his favorite uncle,” Sammy told him with a grin. Once again, Dean picked up the baby, and once again, the baby popped back into Sam’s lap.
“Daddy,” she said, trying to get his attention, but he wouldn’t look at her. She sighed before continuing. “I know you don’t agree with me,” and at that, Dean snorted, “but I think differently than you do. Can’t we just agree to disagree on this and move on?”
Lucifer’s nostrils flared and his eyes narrowed before he broke into a wide smile and started laughing, giving a golf clap to go along with it. “Well, well, well, little brother, I knew you had a hard-on for humanity but isn’t this just too much? At least you can count this one’s arms and legs on one hand, am I right?” He laughed again before turning to Bobby. “Come on over here and say hi to your Uncle Lucifer son,” he said with a wave. Gabriel’s arm held tighter to Bobby’s shoulder but the boy just shrugged it off  before walking right up to Lucifer.
Gabriel dropped to his knees, lifting Samyaza’s head by his hair. The leader of the Grigori was finished, the black ichor from the chest wound now pouring out at an exponential rate and consuming the flesh and bone. Gabriel lifted the head so he stared into
Dean threw a stack of sheet music on Castiel’s chair with a smirk. “Think you can keep up, Cas?” he said, the nickname dripping with sarcasm as always.
The kids were packed and ready to go. Dean had picked up an old Army surplus duffel bag to pack as much of baby Sammy’s stuff in as he could. MJ and Bobby had their own backpacks packed and ready, which were currently on the floor. As Sam and Bobby worked on the spell together, Dean and Castiel spent the last few moments they could with their children. They were huddled together in a group hug, holding onto each other and whispering how much their dads would miss them and making MJ promise to look out for Sammy.
Dean from the past felt uncomfortable, weird watching someone else kiss his angel, even if it was himself. He excused himself from the room, smiling at the happy family. Just outside the door, Gabriel, Sam, and Claire were waiting.
This time when Sam looked, Gabriel's dick was much bigger, fattened up so that it barely fit in Gabriel's palm.
Dean came around first, but Sam quickly followed. They explained to the angel that the dance club was a front for the Thule, and that they had Gabriel.
"Shit," Dean and Sam softly swore at the same time. Sam took Dean's hand in his and helped him up. They just stood together and watched Gabriel's monster cock ream Cas' ass, impressed with Cas' ability to take something that fucking big. "That is both disturbing and hot as fuck," Sam said, leaning into Dean and running his lips across his brother's shoulders. "Think it's the spell or the compulsion?"
"The point is we work as a team. Things could've gone sideways fast, and with none of us knowing your plan, anything could have happened to you and we would've never known." Dean sighed, deflated. "You scared me, sweetheart. I don't know what I'd do if
Dean nodded. “Cas,” he said, turning to his angel, “do you remember where you buried the horsemen’s rings? Think you can dig them up for us? That’s the best I can think of on such short notice.”
Castiel drove home from Dean’s a little less embarrassed and a lot happier than he’d been in years. He had been content with his life, but had forgotten how much he missed intimacy. He snorted to himself; he obviously missed it so much that all he needed was a good tease and a light touch to set him off.
“Regardless, we are working without God’s plan here. Nothing is set in stone, and time will work itself out the way it is supposed to.”
Dean had known Rufus Turner his entire life. He was a friend of Bobby Singer’s, who was pretty much his surrogate dad. He knew Rufus loved music but was all sorts of tone deaf, which is why when he had the opportunity to join the Board of Directors years ago he jumped on it, hoping he could help the KCO become just as famous as orchestras in the larger, more popular cities. Dean just didn’t have a clue what the old man was up to this time.
"Because sometimes it just can't be written," Kevin explained. "Chuck explained to me that there are some Unwritten Times in the history of Heaven, like most of Jesus' life before he came into his faith. By writing some things down they become prophecy, but sometimes it's more important to let the players make their own choices, become the people they're meant to be, before writing things down. Writing these things down is like setting up a domino chain; think of it as making sure the first piece is in the right spot before putting the other pieces in place. Not to say I know what God is thinking," he said, slightly chagrined, "but maybe after all the shit prophecy has put you and your brother through, he's letting everything fall into a better place before setting the dominoes back up. Without a prophecy in place right now, anything can happen."
“Pretty much,” Sam snorted. “Dean’s so stubborn, he’s not gonna see this as anything than an attack on him personally. He’s not going to care that Cas wants to be good at what he does, he just wants that damned chair so he can hold on to as much of our mom as possible.”
MJ yawned and replied, “just that she’s British Men of Letters, and that she was a real bitch back in the day. She died before I was born.”
So here she was, back on American soil, to get the full story from the Winchesters themselves. At the time of her arrival Sam and Gabriel had already retired for the evening, so they set Lady Toni up in a (heavily guarded) room and told her they would bring her up to speed in the morning, when all of them could be there for the discussion.
"Yep!" MJ said cheerfully. "He's been vessel-hopping since Amara knocked him out of Castiel, trying to find the perfect vessel so he can regain control of Hell. The way I figure it, we cage him and you and I are both happy campers."
Lucifer just sighed and shook his head. “That has got to be one of the most absurd things I’ve ever heard.”
"True enough," Gabriel told them. "An angel's wings, especially for a soldier like Castiel, are their primary weapon, but treated properly, well," Gabriel made an explosion noise, complete with hand gestures.
Dean simply couldn't wrap his head around it. He knew how big his and Sam's (unfortunately) dicks were, and cramming them into a small opening like that couldn't be comfortable, let alone pleasurable. He'd assumed Cas was just going along with all of this because of the compulsion, acting like he enjoyed it for his and Sam's benefits.
"My guess?" Bobby shrugged. "He went to our time. Probably thought he could find the answers we need there."
He trudged through practice, playing well enough not to garner any attention from the conductor but not really putting his full attention into it. He was so amped up for the challenge he had to remind himself not to bounce his knees throughout the four pieces they worked on that day. When the conductor called it quits after almost three hours, Dean shot out of his chair and raised his bow, signaling for his attention. The conductor just sighed and waved a hand at Dean to go ahead.
Castiel, on the other hand, was still not a happy papa. Kevin was scared shitless of Cas, but Dean promised the Scribe that he would work on it before MJ was born. In the meantime, he actually suggested that Kevin take MJ on one more (PG-rated) date before
“Deal!” she said, running up to Dean and throwing her arms around his neck. He hugged her back, holding onto her for a moment before letting her go to get ready for the day.
“About two hours worth,” Gabe said thoughtfully. “It’s November now, but the benefit’s not until May. Would that be enough time?”
back to life, because he couldn’t live without him. The depth of that feeling stunned him, filled his heart to bursting. With one hand to Gabriel’s lower back and one hand tangled in his hair, he pulled this man as close as he could and kissed him, pouring his own love into him, hoping it would be enough to convey how deeply Gabriel touched his soul.
Gabriel wrapped his arms around Sam’s waist. “I’ll give you one hint,” he said with a sweet smile on his face. “I’m doing this because I love you and want to give you everything.” He reached up on his tippy-toes and planted a chaste kiss on Sam’s lips.
“Did you know that a cat’s penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?” Sam imitated Cas’ gruff voice. “I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.” The room broke out in more laughter.
me do anything, I earned it. I’m strong, fast, smart, and a damned good shot. And unlike you, I don’t internalize everything and make poor decisions because I’m riddled with guilt.”
"Sorry about this, Cas," Dean muttered into Cas' chest, not making any attempt to move yet. "You know I'd never force this on you, you know?"
“Why don’t you ask your Uncle Cas?” Gabriel said, eyes not leaving Cas’ face as he waggled his eyebrows.
“Sounds like a date!” Dean said happily. Cas graced Dean with one of those big smiles he was looking for. This was gonna be
The next few hours passed in a similar manner, with Dean and Cas trading flirty remarks and innuendo as they practiced. Somehow along the way, their chairs got closer and closer together until their legs were rubbing against each other. Dean didn’t know about Cas, but he’d been playing with a raging hard-on for at least half an hour.
He cracked one eye open and looked up to see Dean. He was so deep in his mind he never heard the hunter approach. Either that, or Dean is just that damned good. Maybe a combination of both. Dean crouched down next to him, bringing them eye-level.
“Well, it was difficult to enjoy when the scientific terms were not only incorrect but the made-up ones sounded completely ludicrous.”
“Hey!" Dean yelled at her, but she held a finger up to him. “Sammy,” she said to get her brother’s attention. “Owie.” She pointed to the cut on her dad’s arm, and when he saw it, he actually squawked before slapping his little hand on the cut. This time, there was a slight blue glow, and when he moved his hand, it was as if the cut was never even there. “Da!” Sammy said again, laughing and clapping.
After the burgers were eaten and a few more beers drunk, Gabriel snapped up a horseshoe pit. Sam, Gabriel, and Bobby teamed up against Dean, Castiel, and Mary while MJ tried to convince Kevin to try holding baby Sammy. They joked and laughed and played as the sun set in the west, painting the sky cotton candy colors.
The boy took the bag of rock salt from Dean and started laying down a line across the bottom of the door as the girl answered flippantly, “angels, demons, and maybe a deity or two, I didn’t have time to take a survey.”
Cas looked at Dean and tilted his head to one side. “Sam is right to worry. If Gabriel leaves the bunker in his current condition then he is at risk for attack, putting both himself and his unborn child in unnecessary danger.” Dean rolled his eyes and whispered in Castiel’s ear for a minute. Cas looked at Sam and Gabriel and asked, “where would you two like to go?” without his facial expression ever changing. Dean crossed his arms over his chest with a smug grin.
When he was eight, he had his first and only nanny who was younger than fifty. In her late twenties, she was just as hard-working and firm with him as his other nannies had been, but she was softer somehow. She smiled much more than anyone he knew, and she always engaged him with questions. One afternoon after picking him up from cello practice, she handed him some sheet music. It wasn’t classical music, but she had told him it was one of her favorite songs and that it reminded her of her mother, and did he think he could learn it for her? Wanting to keep her smiling, he did learn it, and played it for her every chance he got. When his mother heard it, he had a new nanny the next day.
As Cas fell forward into Dean's arms, Dean slipped out of his body. Sam watched as a thin trickle of come leaked from Cas' ass. Removing one hand from Cas' wings, he reached forward and traced his rim before pushing the come back inside, causing a chain reaction of first Cas to shudder against Dean, and then Dean to shudder. Fascinated with the reaction, he continued tracing the puffy ring of muscle with his finger, occasionally dipping in, until Cas was squirming against Dean and whimpering.
“Ha!” MJ laughed sarcastically. “Like God would lift a finger to help us. After what happened to Uncle Gabe, if I ever met God I’d probably kick his ass.”
"A female with Dean Winchester's phone, why does that not surprise me?" he said dryly. "What do you want, girl?"
Groaning, he rolled over and pulled his pillow over his head. Why was he even thinking about Winchester? The man simply infuriated him with his cockiness and brash demeanor. Yes, the man was a decent cellist, but that didn’t warrant the size of the man’s ego. Neither did his dazzling smile nor his sparkling eyes or…
"Hey Cas, I think his is bigger than yours," Dean sniggered, pointing at the blade. Cas huffed while Gabriel just laughed.
“That’s not the point!” Dean started pacing MJ’s room, muttering under his breath. “Cas, can you track them down?”
Dean pulled his hands down his face, torn about what to do. He wanted his daughter out, but she also had a point. He looked at her again, her eyes pleading. He turned around and told Crowley “what she said. Release Bobby now, MJ will stay until the contract is signed. That’s our final offer.”
Just then, a blast shook the bunker. Gabriel, Castiel, and Bobby all dropped their blades from their sleeves. "I think they found us," Gabriel said grimly.
Gabriel announced himself by first knocking, then entering Castiel’s home with a loud, “hey, Cassie!” Castiel looked up, then looked back down at the clock in the corner of the computer screen. It was late, and he had done nothing productive that day. He smiled at himself.
“When Cas found your brother in Hell, his soul was torn to shreds. He would never have survived being pulled from the pit, and what was left of his soul would have been lost in the Veil. Cas actually used pieces of his own grace to put Dean back together.”
Dean wrapped one arm around Cas and the other around Bobby. “I know what you mean. Let’s just give them time to heal, okay?” Bobby just nodded and the three of them wandered off to let Sam take care of Gabriel.
“So yeah, if God could let something like that happen, then I don’t think I’d want his kind of help, you know?”
Dean gave Castiel a red-faced death glare as everyone tried their very hardest not to laugh, and not succeeding in the slightest.
"So what's with the visit?" Claire asked. "I mean, I know I'm a ray of sunshine and a joy to be around, but you guys usually don't show up unless something's going down. There a hunt up here I haven't heard about?"
. The conductor counted off, and the two men started the first few measures of the song softly. It crescendoed quickly, both hitting the strings with their bows aggressively. They glanced furtively at each other throughout the piece, neither man smiling. At the bridge, Dean started finger-plucking the strings as Castiel took the soft yet dangerous melody, until they crescendoed yet again into an explosive performance of the chorus. While it hadn’t been rehearsed, the performance was spectacular, rendering everyone in the hall silent.
Sam was leaning against the door to the training room, arms crossed over his chest as he watched Gabriel’s movements. The former Trickster never ceased to astound him. While he never underestimated Gabriel’s power, he often forgot that Gabriel was an archangel almost as old as time itself, a warrior, a messenger of God. Watching all that glorious power in a deadly dance was both humbling and arousing. Not flinching even once, he watched as Gabriel got closer and closer to him, his love for and faith in the archangel never faltering. He couldn’t help the smile that spread across his lips as Gabriel stopped right in front of him.
"Okay angel, here we go." Dean removed his fingers from Cas' now open hole and placed his hand on his hip to steady him. He stroked himself a few times, slicking himself with his precome before he lined the head up and pressed forward slowly. Dean couldn't believe how tight this was, and he probably would've stopped already if Cas weren't squirming and making whining noises. When the head of his dick slid in with a slight pop, Cas' back arched and he cried out a soft "oh!"
Dean took Cas’ hand, then pulled him close. “Not yet, you haven’t,” he said with a smirk, then kissed Cas hard.
Hours after the soldiers’ bodies were discovered, records came to light about the illegal trade of weapons between some of the officers on post. It had also come to light that Specialist Rose Williams learned of this and, after reporting it to her commanding officer, her commanding officer was ordered to silence her. A full inquiry of the base’s chain of command would happen once they arrived on American soil.
Dean came back over, looking even more frustrated if it was possible. “They said he’s almost out of surgery, the doc would come down and talk to us after.”
"Same actors?" Dean asked curiously. He really hoped the guy who played him in this universe wasn't a soap star like the other one.
Gabriel scoffed. "He'll be fine, just gotta get a handle on things. As for anything else, who knows," he said cheerfully, throwing his hands in the air. "Love ya!" he said flippantly, then snapped again and he was gone.
With fierce determination, Deanna pushed Gabriel's hands away and stepped back. "What the hell is going on?" she demanded.
“He gets his brains from me, you know,” Gabriel said, nudging Sam in the side with his elbow and winking at him. Sam laughed, “he got his brains from me, he got his deviousness from you.”
After grabbing himself another brew from the fridge, Dean leaned against the counter, thinking about what Sammy was asking of him. Their mom was killed by a drunk driver when Dean was only five, Sam barely a year old. Sam didn’t remember her, not like Dean did, all smiles and sunshine and warm pie and
. “Why would he do that to me?” he whispered. “Doesn’t he think I’ll stay without it? Doesn’t he know I love him?”
Castiel worked his way around the war room sorting and stacking the files on the Thule Society and boxing them up, picking up coffee mugs and plates of picked-at food and returning them to the kitchen, and righting and repairing furniture and knick-knacks that had been kicked and thrown in fits of rage over the past few days. He worked silently and stoically as Dean paced around with a fifth of whisky in his hand.
Neither man missed how their brothers looked-positively wrecked, and not in a good way. Dean knew Sam and Gabriel still hurt, but never knew what to say or how to say it to let them know he was sorry and that he was there for them. Maybe his son was a genius and knew just what his uncles needed to help heal. He smiled as he told Cas that, and his angel just nodded. As for himself, Dean knew just what they would need when they got up. After all, pie heals all wounds.
He knelt up between Dean’s legs and hooked his hunter’s knees over his shoulders. Cas pulled those sinful-looking briefs down just enough, stroked more lube up and down his erection, and slowly fed his cock into Dean. Inch by inch, Dean took it with a whispered prayer of “yes, Cas, yes,” on his lips. When he was fully seated, balls to ass, he held until Dean nodded his comfort. Cas pulled back about halfway, rocked his hips back and forth a fraction, then slammed into Dean, both his dick and his grace nailing his prostate in one quick strike.
A week after the accident, Sammy was still in a coma. Gabe said they’d been on their way back from running an errand when the Ford F-250 dually ran the stop sign at the intersection at 55 miles per hour, T-boning Gabe’s Honda Accord on the passenger side. While the momentum threw Gabe’s head through the driver's side window, Sammy had taken the full force of the hit, crushing the right side of his body and leaving a small crater in the side of his head. Gabe had morbidly referred to Sammy’s head as looking like a piece of modern art, concave with shards of glass jutting out and blood dripping down the side, like crystalline flowers dotted with deathly raindrops. The thought made Dean want to vomit.
"Whoa, okay, I missed you too, angel." His head was spinning as Cas worked his tongue and lips down his body. Cas ran the flat of his tongue across one nipple before flicking it with the tip and Dean's back arched involuntarily. Cas liked that reaction, working Dean's nipples with his lips, his tongue, his teeth, until Dean was panting. Who knew his nipples were so fucking sensitive?
Dean was sitting in one of the recliners under the pretense of watching the show Bobby had turned on, but in actuality he was watching Cas. The angel had taken to wearing jeans and tee shirts more often, only donning his suit and trench coat when they had work to do. Today he was wearing faded light blue jeans that hugged his ass and thighs deliciously, and the black AC/DC tee shirt he had on would ride up just enough to flash a creamy strip of skin under the hem every time he bent over to blow raspberries on the baby’s tummy how MJ had taught him.
“Yeah, okay.” Bobby replied. He looked over at Gabriel and said, “I know I did that spell right, but now I’m thinking it failed because MJ and I still need to be here. Everything happens for a reason, right?”
Gabriel took the presents from Castiel and put them with the gifts that he and Sam had gotten for Bobby. “Ever been to a birthday party before Cassie?” Gabriel asked him with a smile.
Hours of unpacking things from boxes and reading labels proved fruitless for getting the kids back to 2037, but it was still amusing. Dean had found a hat that made him look like Indiana Jones, and he set it aside for Bobby. They’d found bottled monster parts (presumably for spells) and tried to gross each other out. A spelled box uncovered a pair of enchanted shoes that reminded Dean of the time they dealt with a pair of cursed ballet slippers, so they took a break while Dean told MJ the story about that hunt. MJ found an almost empty jar of powder with a label that simply said “itch”, and she shook a little over her dad’s head. After ten minutes of him scratching and her laughing, he grabbed the jar from her, uncapped it, and flung the few remaining contents at MJ. She stood there waiting for the itch to start, but nothing happened. MJ smiled smugly while Dean continued to itch.
baby and you're an awesome dad, but you don't have to take care of him by yourself. He has Cas, who by the way doesn't
he felt good and didn't they deserve that? Grabbing the lube from his nightstand, he went back to Cas' room.
Dean smirked. Yeah, he timed his shower to get the best reaction outta Cas. Fucker sat there all day at practice looking adorable as he concentrated on his sheet music and his playing, Dean just wanted to sit on his lap and muss him up.
“If by ‘normal’ you mean through the vagina, then no. Angels and Nephilim carried by vessels are not typically conceived physically through intercourse, although it is not uncommon for a bonded pair to be engaged in intercourse at the time of conception. A uterus is not a prerequisite for conception or carrying a fledgling.”
The windows rattled before they shattered inward. Present Dean ran to cover them. "Angels to the west!" he yelled. To past Dean's shock, an angel blade materialized in present Dean's hand. Present Dean just smirked at him and said, "it's Cas', perk of the bond," then turned back to the window to keep an eye on the advancing angels.
Hell, he didn’t even really know what being bonded meant. He figured it was like being ‘angel-married’ or something, but sex wasn’t a necessity. Would Cas mind if he went out and hooked up with someone? Would he spend the rest of his life not getting laid? Sex wasn’t needed for an angel to conceive, but would Cas want or expect sex from him?
"I didn't measure it, I felt it," Cas amended. "In my mouth, and when he penetrated me. It was a very pleasurable experience."
Castiel turned around in Dean’s grasp, draping his arms over his hunter’s shoulders. “I am an angel of the Lord, Dean,” he said seriously, “I am not ‘adorable’.” Dean could
"So, what? You get off on gay porn?" Dean was getting angry now. This woman had fucked with their lives and didn't seem to get it. "Why don't you go out and get laid instead of just writing about it?"
Dean took Castiel’s hand and smiled at him, and Castiel felt warmth spread throughout his body. “Yeah Gabe, we’re good.”
“And worst case scenario?” Dean asked frantically. The angels looked at each other for a moment before Cas answered solemnly, “he may be comatose.”
Bobby knew his dad, and he knew that look in his eyes. He knew how Sam Winchester let his guilt weigh him down, and he knew what his dad needed right now.
kind of nervous. He told MJ stories about how he met Dean and Sam, listened to her stories about her family. When the waiter came, MJ ordered for both of them.
"I'm sure he'll be just fine," Dean told him, slapping his shoulder. "Like you said, part archangel."
"I think whatever's been fucking with us knew about Dean's tendency to play with things and set that up," Sam pondered out loud. "Lots of Team Free Love fanfiction out there."
The surgeon bent over Gabriel’s abdomen, and starting at the edge of his pubic bone used the angel blade to make a thin incision up to Gabriel’s navel, slicing the skin. Gabriel screamed in agony, the pain so overwhelming he couldn’t move. The surgeon ran a gloved finger down the incision, separating the skin and exposing the muscle. He used the blade again to slice open Gabriel’s abdominal muscle, revealing a small amniotic sac.
me. I didn’t even— But that was exactly it, wasn’t it? You did choose me. You always did. It didn’t even matter to you that you were working with a demon, you just wanted to
— and not to mention the drinking problem and violent streak. There’s plenty of things wrong with him. If he were to look at it on paper, all his traits listed down, that shit would scare him too, send him packing and running for the hills or whatever.
stop. So you better come back to me, okay? You’re gonna come home to me and we’re gonna have a nice long chat and you’re gonna let me love you back, ya hear?”
He’s so tired and honestly, all he can do right now is to go along with the tides. So he stays where he is and embraces the vulnerability, God knows he hasn’t allowed that for himself enough times.
He’s never been good at talking about his feelings, let alone his feelings about Cas. Everything’s usually so tangled up that he couldn’t make sense of it, the uncertainty of whether it would ever lead to anything, the resolve of accepting things as they were even if it was just a shadow of what he would have wanted, and, as always, the fear that he’ll leave for good this time.
He tries to... Hell, he doesn’t even know what he’s doing, not really. He’s drunk and for the first time in a very long time, he’s allowing himself to feel without worrying about the consequences after. The alcohol in his system settles, numbing and sharpening him at the same time. He’s both participant and audience in this pain-comfort midnight screening brought to him by his fuck-all traitorous memory and abysmal self-preservation. Remembering the departed or something like it. A retrospective of his and Cas’ time together or whatever the fuck. Just— Looking at it all now, with what he now knows for certain— It should’ve been all so obvious.
“You know, I almost cracked once.” Dean huffs at the memory, mirthless and melancholy. “At the crypt when Naomi ordered you to kill me, I wanted to tell you then. It didn’t even matter that so much shit was happening. I just wanted to tell you how I felt; I wanted to tell you that I love you and ask you to come back to me and
. If it was the last chance I was gonna get, I wanted to tell you at least once. I wanted you to know. But— But I couldn’t. I got so scared so I— I told you I needed you instead... I told you I needed you because that was easier than saying I love you and then still watching you leave. I never even said that to anyone, not since my mom died. I couldn’t tell you I love you and have it thrown back at my face. And besides, you weren’t
and like what he sees enough to fall in love with him? That— It doesn’t even compute. Even in his world where he deals with shit normal people should never have to deal with in their lives, like ever.
“But I should have told you then, huh? I should’ve— Maybe you would’ve stayed and maybe you would’ve never met Metatron and maybe you would’ve never fallen at all and maybe I wouldn’t have—” Dean lets out a shuddery breath, shaking his head. “God, I hurt you so many times, Cas. How could you even— I threw you out of the Bunker when you didn’t even know— And all that so soon after I
But Dean feels cracked open, his heavily guarded walls toppling down to strip bare his soul, unable to keep himself from spilling everywhere. Then again, it’s not like he’s strong enough to keep himself together right now anyway.
I hurt Jack. I even hurt Sammy. So I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I'm gonna try to be better. I promise, Cas. M'gonna be good and be the man you saw me as. For you. For both of us.”
“I thought I was going crazy. I kept seeing you everywhere after I came back. You were walking on the side of the road, sitting at the back of the Impala, standing outside by the window, staring at me in front of the mirror, you were behind me, beside me. You were everywhere and yet— It felt like you were just at the tip of my fingers, but no matter how fast I run I still couldn’t catch you.”
“And then— Well, we both know how that played out.” Dean’s jaw snaps shut, a feeling that jars him to his very core bubbling up inside his chest. Just the notion of Cas willingly leaving him. That— That— He needs another drink.
for Cas. For himself too. Plain and simple. 'Cause if there’s one thing that deserves Dean’s undying loyalty and faith, it would be Castiel’s love.
When it was all said and done, with God defeated and Jack gone, the first thing Dean does is cry. He crumples himself in the little nook in the library where they keep the good liquor, ignoring Sam’s heavy disappointed sigh and worried eyes until he’s left alone. He cries until his face is itchy with dried tears, until his body is stiff from hunching into himself for too long. He doesn’t stop until his voice is hoarse from repeating the same words of regret—
It should make him angry, but most of all it just makes him sad. Devastated. Gutted. For the things and the person that he would never be able to know or feel or experience differently. It’s like everything that he’s been trying to bury ever since Cas got taken decided to come out all at once. Feelings that demanded to be felt and thoughts that refused to be repressed, it’s all drowning him now.
It’s interesting for a couple of reasons, but mostly because the results from Wichita are in Dean’s pocket.
Dean ignores him. He has not tasted whiskey in years. The bottle feels right in his hand. The glasses are still set out on the table; he ignores those too, cracking the lid.
This time when Castiel follows her, it is in something like a daze. When he glances back at the dining hall before leaving, it is as if nothing has happened. The omega women are scrubbing the floorboards, their eyes on the ground. He wonders, faintly panicked, if he has made a terrible mistake, but by then he is being walked back through to the handsome receiving room, being handed a stack of printed pamphlets (‘True Alphas and Proper Omegas: An Instructional Guide to Omega Care and Rehabilitation’ reads the topmost one; when he turns it over, there is an advertisement for Phineas Jones’ Fine Carriages on the back), and the Matron’s nasty smile is back in full force as she passes him Dean’s papers.
‘My brother,’ says Michael, and this time Dean almost closes his eyes against the accusation. ‘He came up to spend your heat with you, didn’t he? We know what he’s done to you.’
. He has yet to fully comprehend any of those things himself; but God loves them, that is an immutable fact, so it cannot be wrong for Castiel to love them too.
‘I have to,’ Castiel tries to say, ‘I have to punish you.’ It comes out like a croak, like his mouth is dry, and he swallows.
, Cas. You wanna hear that? You want me to cry about it, “shit, please forgive me Castiel, sorry I’m such a fucking piece of shit asshole, please can I still go to heaven?” Sorry I’m such a - sorry I had to buy food for my fucking brother, sorry I couldn’t stop ‘em, sorry I did what I was told, sorry for all of it - that what you want?’
