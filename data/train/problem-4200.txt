Castiel got off of his bed and walked over to his box of books. After some searching he found his faded copy of The House at Pooh Corner. He hadn't read it in years, not since he was about four and what eight year old would actually bother with reading a children's book. He was grown now and read things by Kafka and Hemingway because that's what adults read. Right?
"I won't but you have to be careful, Cas. Michael already has his suspicions so you're going to have to be more careful," warned Gabriel, hugging his little brother.
"Why? Don't tell me you're getting soft? I've heard you've been hanging out with this kid a lot. He seems kind of like a fairy to me," said Azazel, looking over Dean and Castiel suspiciously.
“If you want me to come with you,” Cas said, somewhat breathlessly, as Dean sat back in his seat again. “I will.”
So, Dean threw the car back in drive and, with Cas by his side, went to track down Jack and get his free pass back to the one place that needed him. To find his way back to where he truly belonged, beside his brother and his best friend—his love, if he was being sappy about it, which he might very well never be—roaming through the same damn country that kept turning up different ways to try and kill them. To take his final chance and live it the way he always wanted to—the way he always needed to. And, when it was finally time, to go out in the blaze of glory he knew he deserved.
"Cross my heart and hope to die," said Dean, using a finger to draw an x over his heart and holding his hand up in a faux oath.
And almost as if on some perfect timing, Dean and Castiel both heard the noise from the bushes behind them. Turning to face the rustling, they both saw Gabriel with the rest of the Novak boys in tow. It was almost as God himself sent Castiel a blessing to change their moods. Or maybe it was a curse.
It was already fast asleep, making itself comfortable on his pillow. He was happy that he was able to take the little thing home but he had no idea what to do to take care of it. He had to make a note to ask Gabriel or Michael to see if they knew what to do. But the main thing crossing his mind was the idea of a name. No matter how hard he thought, nothing stuck.
"I think that sounds nice," Dean said with a soft smile. "Maybe I can try reading some of your work then?"
Hours had passed and Castiel was still stuck on the piano bench, his fingers growing numb from all of the practice. It didn't help that the summer heat made the room even hotter. He had only managed to get the first part of the song down. That was good, right? It only took him most of the day.
The four of them had split up into groups of two. Dean and Castiel on one team with Jo and Sam on the other. The second they entered the maze, they split up in an attempt to reach the end first. But the only problem was that it seemed that the farther that Dean and Cas went in, the more and more it looked like they were lost. It didn't help matters that it was now night, with only the moon to act as their source of light.
It seemed like twenty minutes had passed as Castiel just sat there twiddling with his fingers when Naomi came back into the room with a small packet of papers in hand.
Castiel opened his eyes to see an old train yard. It must've been there since Dean's parents were kids, some of the trains looked as if they weren't even in use anymore. The more Castiel looked at it, the more he got curious as to why Dean was so excited to show this to him.
Dinner had ended and all of the Novak children had gone to the kitchen to clean up. That was except for Michael who ordered Dean to follow him up the stairs and to the attic.
"Oh no, I'm perfectly alright to handle this on my own," said the man, walking over to the counter and dropping the box right on top of it.
With the help of Castiel and Dean, Benny finally managed to pull the door open with a loud creaking noise. Clouds of dust rolled out of the old train car and a strange smell came from somewhere inside.
"Yeah, I'll be fine. Name's Charlie," she said in a bright voice as if she didn't just get hit in the head. The cheery tone caught Castiel off guard, not to mention her wide smile as she shook Castiel's hand.
What did bother Castiel was the movie that Sam said they were going to see. He had never been the best with anything horror related. Hell, there were passages in the bible and his father's own sermons that made Castiel uneasy and scared. His frightful nature was something that Gabriel found funny and would often jump from behind corners to scare him. But the worst would have to be Lucifer, who made it his mission to have Castiel living in a state of perpetual fear. The thought of seeing a horror movie would only make Castiel even more terrified in that old house.
Dean had fought a wince in turn, keeping his expression impassive, if a little annoyed at being scolded. He hadn’t thought about who would be watching him as he did his dying deed. He was too busy doing the deed itself.
Even more confusing, Bobby only shot Dean a wink. “Sure you ain’t,” he replied cryptically, then smacked Dean on the shoulder through the window and walked away.
Emotions warred in Dean’s head as Cas’ words and the reality he was being presented with processed in his mind. How was he supposed to ask Cas to stay with him? He’d lost him so many times—this was the time he finally thought he’d never have to let go again.
“Do you remember— No, you weren’t there for that one, actually. You were busy being brainwashed.” Though Dean couldn’t see the wince he knew Cas made at the mention, he felt the presence of it like a niggle of guilt somewhere in his gut. He ignored it, but he told himself to be a little easier the next time, if he ever had to bring it up again. “Kevin had us hunting down hellhounds on this ranch Crowley had commandeered, and I remember—so
But, impaled he had been, and he’d spent his last moments saying goodbye to his baby brother, which, okay.
“Thought I’d have you for longer,” Bobby griped, but he was smiling. “You gonna take her for a spin? It’s pretty nice ‘round here.”
praying to me to see if I could answer, and I was very insulted by that.” Dean couldn’t help it, he snorted in response to that. The smile Cas gave him in return was brief, but wry. Dean knew Cas too well not to think that was funny, thinking of all the prayers he’d given to him over the years and how they all had gone when he hadn’t realized Cas couldn’t answer. Cas sobered up before Dean could live out the short moment of amusement and continued, “but I understand the fear you had. I know why you didn’t want to let him go. I understand the need you felt for him to stay, just in case you didn’t get to say goodbye. Sam was the one thing you couldn’t let go silently, not again.” He lowered his voice to that deep, soft gravel and finished, “I’ve been there. I know what it’s like.”
“Back in the bunker,” Dean said, then had to stop and allow himself a moment to recalibrate as the end result of that event rushed to the forefront of his mind and begged him to blurt out whatever came to mind first. Because thinking before talking was never exactly Dean’s strong suit, but he’d be damned if he let this one get away on him too soon.
But Cas only looked at him, that same, small smile curling his lips again. “I’ve come to realize over time that I don’t need heaven,” he told Dean gently. “Not when I’m with you.”
“Hop in,” Dean replied, looking out the windshield instead of directly at the angel, something about the sight of him so close flashing memories he didn’t want reminding of right then. He smacked his hand against the door, the sharp noise dispelling them. “We’ve got some things to talk about.”
“I don’t think I’m being given a choice on the matter,” Cas replied, and he was right. He wasn’t letting Cas out of his sight anytime soon. Not when he'd finally gotten him back again.
Annoyed, Dean wrenched his gaze away to glower out the windshield, watching the corn sway in the wind. It took Cas reaching out and grasping Dean on the arm to get him to turn back again, and his other arm burned with a phantom contact. He knew Cas’ hand had been in this position many times before, and something in his body remembered the very first time like Cas had never let go.
this place, anyway? I feel like I could drive for forty years in one direction and get absolutely nowhere.”
“You helped take care of God, Dean,” Cas replied, dry as ever. “You gave him free passes on the stupid mistakes he made. I think he’ll be willing to give you a free pass in turn on the one you made.”
“I want to go with you,” Cas asserted quickly, once again aware of Dean’s turmoil before he could say anything on the matter.
Cas stared at Dean with a hard expression. “Regardless of what you want to tell yourself, you were worth dying for to me. I was happy with the saying. You can’t deny that. It was why the Empty came at all.”
, Dean had always told Cas. Because needing someone had always meant more to him than loving someone. It had never occurred to him until he was losing Cas for what he thought was the final time that anyone could be the source of both. It terrified him, that fact that he both loved and needed Cas, but he was willing to push past that fear if it only meant never losing Cas again.
Dean Winchester had gone from the world in a way he was embarrassed to admit to—in a way so far from what he’d wanted that his first step into heaven had been half a cringe on memory alone.
Dean took another long pull of his beer, that information processing in his mind. He felt no pull to immediately go visit them like he might have in another life, but he also didn’t feel the need to wonder why that was. He had all of eternity to see them, after all. He’d do it when he felt like it.
Dean pulled the car over again, just so he could specifically twist in his seat and stare at Cas dead-on. “What do you
“You two always were particularly dramatic,” Cas said, like he was imparting some especially insightful information on Dean with that statement.
So, he’d asked Sammy to stay, and he’d gotten his goodbye. And, as fate would have it, he probably would have survived that time if he’d only just bothered to shut the hell up and let Sam go get help.
, was my perfect ending. Me dying on a hunt, Sam living on without me, getting to do the exact thing I’d deprived him of without me there to drag him down again. It was what I had always wanted ever since I got him back in the game and realized what I’d done.”
But Bobby was right, and Dean knew that. Dean knew he had given the moments that probably would have ended with him alive to Sam as he bled to death in his arms. Dean knew it had been a dumb move at the end of it all. He was aware of what he had done. In fact, it would haunt him for the rest of his afterlife.
Dean felt something in his chest twinge sharply at that, like a guitar string brutally plucked. It resonated up his sternum and nearly hurt, whatever it was, and he forced himself to swallow around it. He glanced over at Cas, only once. Cas was already looking back. “You, too, Cas,” he told him, and if there was a taste of fury to his tone, Cas didn’t call him out on it. “You did, too.”
Dean couldn’t help it—he straight up gaped at Cas in shock. How had that not occurred to him? How had it not occurred to him to even think to
me you—” He worked his lips around words that didn’t sound right, things that felt too wrong coming from someone like him. Nothing felt right. It all felt too late.
look and reminded him, because he was the authority on the matter, after all, “It wouldn’t be the first time you’ve done it.”
He let Bobby rip at him a little longer, not saying a word in return, and then he let Bobby hold him close again, because he knew Bobby was only upset Dean was there at all, and Dean had no right to take that indignance away from the man that basically adopted him as his own and kept him alive during hunts that could very easily have gone just as wrong.
Hell, he’d spent so long on that goodbye that Bobby had stuck it to him the second he’d walked over the threshold of his heaven house and wrangled him into his grasp. He’d hugged Dean close, given him a moment to breathe in the life he’d forgotten how to miss as desperately as he used to, and then he wrenched Dean away again, not too soon, with a fury worthy of the very depths of Hell blazing in his eyes.
Dean looked up, and Cas was smiling at him. Not with a grin, not with any kind of emotion that could even come close to being elated—just a gentle, simple smile, so similar to the one he’d given Dean just before the Shadow had taken him away. It was nothing grand, nothing earth-shattering, but Dean was pretty sure his heart forgot he wasn’t alive in the first place and stopped dead in his chest right then and there anyway.
“Hey, someone has to tell you. And I’ve got plenty of time now to make up for lost ground.” Dean scoffed, craning his neck to look out the window. “How big
Cas’ eyes widened minutely, a muscle fluttering in his jaw as he visibly clenched it, and he turned to stare out the windshield. A poor choice of words on Dean’s part, but he hadn’t realized until after he’d already said it.
Dean frowned up at Bobby. Bobby wasn’t pointing in the same direction he’d said John and Mary were. “What are you talking about? I’m not looking for anyone. I just got here.”
It was already dark by the time Castiel had made it home but his family didn't seem to mind much. Dean had walked him back so that way he wouldn't get lost, though Cas was sure he could've made it back just fine.
"And? Is it real gold? Nope, so what do I care about any of that stuff for? I already know I'm going to be working in my dad's car shop so what's the point of school anyways," said Benny.
"No, I just let him win. Benny needs all the reassurance he can get that he's still popular with the girls," Dean laughed.
"Come on, Castiel. You have to do this," he said to himself. Castiel stood up straight and made his way to the porch where he knocked on the screen door.
"You're timing is impeccable, Cas," Dean groaned, taking his friend's hand and standing up. He wiped his hands on his pants and wiped the mud off of his face, leaving a dirty smear of dirt across his cheeks. "It really is something else, you know that?"
The night before his father called and said he was spending the night at a friend's place which meant that he and Sammy were free to do whatever they pleased. Though whoever his old man was staying the night with did cross his mind, his father didn't really have friends, Dean decided to ignore that thought and let the night go by with ease.
"No, Dean. I'm going to help out Jo and take her home. If she hates it here, then I won't make her stay any longer," said Castiel.
Everyone cheered, getting up and putting themselves to work. Benny tried his best to fix the roof, using some of the slats to cover the holes and an old ladder to prop himself up. Jo went about cleaning the place, dusting here and there and picking up any trash she found. Castiel was helping Dean by holding the door. He held it upright while Dean screwed back into place. And Sammy… Sam just watched them all.
"Um no thanks, I'm out. I've seen The Uninvited," said Gabriel, "I don't want to die at the hands of any ghosts."
Dean could only stare blankly at his brother who was busy trying to build a small town out of his faded blue and red blocks. Sam interrupted the silence with a hum. It was the old lullaby that his mother would sing to him. How Sammy could remember the thing was beyond him, he was so young when it all happened. His mind went to those old days, when Sam was a baby, their mom was alive, and their dad wasn't… well, nothing was the same as those days.
"Where are you going with this, Lucifer?" Castiel muttered, his eyes glaring holes into his older brother.
"Too old," hummed Gabriel, closing the door behind him and waiting for them to finish seeing their friend.
"Yes, you do. Now let's get you to bed," said Bobby. It took all of his strength to lift up John and walk over Dean but he did it. He left the young boy there and carried the drunken man to the back of the house, to his room.
The boys' Father turned to look at Castiel with an eyebrow raised. "Are you going to run off as well?"
"It's fine, at least I'll look cool when school starts. So in a way, I guess I should be thanking you," said Benny, groaning at weight on him.
"We were just talking about what we're going to wear for Halloween. It's just around the corner, you know," said Jo.
"My dad came home as soon as he heard the news. He didn't help anything, he was worse off when he came back and with everything that happened here, he broke. Bobby and Ellen heard about what happened and ever since they've been helping out in any way they can. And you know the rest.
"Hey, how do you two feel about gettin' some candy?" asked Dean. He wasn't at all surprised at Sam's shout of happiness and looked at Cas.
"Where do I start?" Castiel sighed, laying on his back and staring at the ceiling. "He has really nice eyes. I think they're my favorite part. I really like his freckles too. I've tried to count them but I always lose count around thirty seven…"
"I didn't steal shit! You're piss drunk and lost it," Dean shouted, fighting back the tears. He knew he was lying but John usually never noticed. His father would black out and Dean would take that as his chance to take some money for Sammy and him. He guessed his dad wasn't as drunk as he thought he was the last time he did it, how else would he have known?
"I mean look at him, don't you consider that a tragedy. All things considered, the broken arm makes him look better."
"No, Father says it's a holiday meant to celebrate demons and it's pagan background is an upfront to God," Castiel said sadly.
Castiel shrieked and turned around to face the stranger but tripped over himself and landed in the pond. The duck flew away in a fright and Castiel looked slowly up at the stranger.
Castiel only half listened, his gaze on the children playing on the pavement. He again saw the redheaded girl from his class only this time she was walking with several books in hand. Not a moment later, her head was hit by a kickball and she tumbled over.
Castiel's jaw dropped, his heart racing. How could his brother have known about that? What else did he know? He was sure he was careful with everything he did.
"And what if you're the only person I trust to even do that with," asked Castiel, his cigarette burning out as well.
"That's because he finally has someone who might let him cheat off the homework," said Jo, popping up from her seat behind the boys.
"Okay, now look. I know you're all extremely nervous about all of this but trust me, he'll be more than fine," said Gabriel. He tried to put on his best smile and opened the door for them.
part of the way he actually wanted to go, he had to give whoever was fucking his horse dry now that Chuck was done with that little bit of credit, at least. It wasn’t
And then, after a moment, he added on: “You know, I think I didn’t even mean it when I said it that time, either. Even then, I knew it wasn’t true anymore. I just didn’t know how to come to terms with that. All I wanted was for Sam to understand where I was coming from.” He huffed a bitter laugh. “Never expected it to actually happen.”
“You stupid son of a bitch!” Bobby had said in his Bobby way, all coarse and caring with a bite that set you straight. “You bleeding
“Shh, he doesn’t mean it,” Dean consoled, stroking the steering wheel through the open window, then cracked open the door and slid into the seat. “It ain’t heaven without you.”
“Not gonna lie, this isn’t what I thought it would be,” Dean said after taking a long pull of the bottle.
“Jesus, Dean,” Bobby half-laughed, coming up behind Dean with a mildly disturbed look on his face. “It’s just a goddamn car.”
So, instead, he removed his hand from the shift, turned the car off, and twisted in his seat to look directly at Cas, only to find him already staring back, waiting for an explanation. Dean barely even thought about what he wanted to say before he was blurting out, “It was an accident. Something went wrong, and I paid the price.”
Once again, Dean might not have had the words—but this time, he didn’t need them. Not with Cas. Cas had them himself, and he knew how to interpret where Dean couldn’t figure out how to speak.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. “Really took that ‘don’t ever change’ to heart, didn’t you?” he grumbled, then held up a finger. “Rhetorical. Don’t answer.”
Dean pressed his lips together. He wanted to tell Cas no, to try and convince Cas not to give it all up for him. For one human—something he’d never been able to forget about—
Bobby seemed to sense Dean’s quiet disregard for that fact. “Someone else also followed you along up here,” he added on slowly, and Dean felt his heart nearly rocket up into his throat in response. He looked sharply at Bobby, fear coming back to life in his gut.
But when Dean followed the pointing finger Bobby gave him in response to his startled reaction, it wasn’t Sam standing in the distance like he’d been afraid of. Elation replaced the panic swiftly, and Dean nearly jumped out of the chair as he delightedly loped his way towards the love of his life.
Cas didn’t answer. Dean didn’t move. For a long, almost painful moment, neither of them did anything at all.
No, he’d gone out with barely a fizzle, taking care of some cleanup job his dad hadn’t managed to finish in the twenty-odd goddamn years he’d been hunting through the same country he kept running beneath his wheels, on a wayward jut of rebar in a barn by a stupid fucking vampire.
Bobby opened his mouth and then hesitated, like he wasn’t sure what he was about to say. “He had some help,” he ended up responding cryptically, and then ignored the inquisitive look Dean shot him in turn. “Pretty neat setup, though. Your parents are right down the road.”
“I know, I should have let Sam get help,” Dean said quickly before Cas could offer any kind of verbal response, turning away again so he couldn’t see Cas roll his eyes in reaction to the haste. It would make him backtrack, or change subjects, or say exactly what he didn’t mean to say, and he had to get the right thing out while he had the ball rolling. “Bobby already tore me a new one over that. Do me a favor and don’t add to the carnage. I’m still healing.”
was the Han Solo here, after all. Cas ignored him and said, “Let’s go find Jack, then. Before Sam gets into something he shouldn’t.”
“You don’t have to say anything, Dean,” Cas started while Dean collected himself, but Dean held up a hand and shook his head, stopping Cas before he could go further.
"You know when I think about it, your head could serve as a pretty nice ball for our game. Don't you think, Crowley?"
"No, I can't," said Dean, looking down at Castiel, "Bobby can't take Sam tonight so I have to watch him."
"A what?" Castiel asked, looking up from his book. The most confused look came to his face as he tilted his head to the side, Dean would've thought that it was cute had he not been so frustrated.
“I like to eat, alright? You don’t see me saying anything when I see you stuffing your face at the Roadhouse,” groaned Benny, his voice sounding tired and faded.
As Dean made his way closer to the paved road going into town, he decided to turn his head around to get one last look at his house. His jaw practically dropped to the ground at the sight of his father running after him, drunkenly tripping over himself.
"She was so beautiful, Dean. I'm telling you, I think I'm in love," swooned Benny, leaning on Jo dramatically.
They both laughed and Dean asked to hear the song again. Castiel gave in and cracked his fingers (in an attempt to show off) and played.
After the awkward silence, they both agreed that that would be their secret. Dean held Castiel closer to him as they worked their way through the maze, confident in his decision making. It may have taken another twenty minutes but the two of them were out in no time at all.
A Novak dinner is a bit of a chaotic occasion as Dean had soon come to learn. It was filled with bickering, shouting, and most of all laughing. These were all sounds Dean had grown accustomed to, of course, but it still amazed him how they all were.
"Gabe, you don't have to go bringing up someone's past like that. It's unbecoming and face it, Uncle Marv has too long of a list if we're going there," Michael said, holding back a smile. He was clearly proud of his little brother coming to his aid.
"Ah, now that is a story to tell. Go get your game and I'll tell you all about it," said Castiel's grandfather, smiling at the thought of that memory. His blue eyes had that classic Novak fire behind them that Castiel seemed to inherit, like a raging ocean whose waves break the very rocks they crash into.
"The same as always, just pick," said Andy with a roll of his eyes. The Winchester brothers always made it a habit to come in and annoy him. It passed the time.
Dean, Castiel, and Charlie walked over back to Jo and Benny, the two of them with their jaws dropped.
Dean smirked and rolled his eyes. Would he love to live with them? Hell yeah. But with Sammy, he didn't want to become even more of a burden than he felt he already was. They were too nice with him as is. It would just seem like he was mooching off of them, though they would never say that.
"Nothing, I just lost a bet," said Dean, looking down at Cas and smiling a little at the sight of Castiel's still dirty face.
"Well seeing as how you and Dean are pretty much inseparable, it wouldn't phase me if you two got up to anything," said Lucifer, his snake-like smile spreading across his face.
He was about to head up the stairs before he thought for a moment about the bloodbath that could be happening up there. It would probably be best if he just waited it out and picked out a room from what was left rather than get in the way of his siblings. He was the youngest after all… well besides Anna.
He had moved away from the only home he had ever known, made a best friend who he couldn't ever imagine living without, had his first kiss, watched his first horror movie, gone to the carnival, made a fort, the list was endless. Though the more he thought about it, he wouldn't be able to put most of his favorite parts in there. They were too scandalous and even he, an eight year old, knew better than to tell people.
Castiel's mind was racing, his heart about to burst. He was so focused on Lucifer's thinly veiled threat that he jumped when Naomi tapped his shoulder.
Did it bother Castiel that the moon was full? A little. Okay, maybe more like a lot. He cursed himself for watching that damned film and yet he was still happy that he did. Doing things like that wasn't really something he was used to. But being around Dean somehow made it a worthwhile experience. He would have to ask Dean what other films were showing but Castiel was sure Dean knew exactly what would be best to see. After all, it was an amazing movie, just scary. Too scary.
As sad as it was to admit, their summer vacation was coming to an end and it was looking like they had all run out of ideas on how to spend the last little bit of it as well.
The brothers continued to sit around and laugh while playing around with some of their cousins. It felt like forever since they had seen some of them so they made sure to have as much time with them as possible.
"Nope, not on my floor," said Dean, kicking the trash can towards his brother and not a moment too soon.
It was a shame, had Dean known about her before he might've called her. Not for the potential that she could've been super hot but he'd always wanted to try out Dungeons and Dragons. He just knew no one that played it.
"Sorry, Father. But it's true, his coat didn't even help him in the rain on his way over here. He was practically drowning with how wet he was," said Gabriel.
“Yeah, you’re right. Benny. I’m going to have to lift you up, you going to be okay,” asked Dean, feeling Benny’s forehead.
"Dean! You're no fair!" shouted Castiel as he ran as fast as he could after his asshole of a friend.
And so began another round of their bickering, Jo fighting in Sam's honor while Benny did his best to get under her skin. Sam watched on until he got bored and went back to playing.
“No, stop. You did that the last time I tried to tell you something to your face. You’re not giving me an out this time.” Cas pursed his lips, eyebrows pulling together slightly in that familiar way they always did, but he kept silent and allowed Dean to continue speaking. “Back in the bunker,” Dean tried again, ignoring the way his mouth once again went dry in response. “I didn’t think you were capable of that, to be honest. That’s why I didn’t— Shit, what you said to me— When you
Dean looked at Cas, the moment with Billie coming to mind so sharply that something in his chest fluttered in response. He’d been trying to let Cas talk about it when Cas was ready to, but, now, he was almost certain Cas was never going to mention it at all. And Dean couldn’t keep going on pretending it hadn’t happened. It was too important to Cas—it was too important to
He hesitated, then said, “It wasn’t until years later I decided that was complete bullshit. I guess it was already too late by then. I’d said what I wanted, and fate had decided not to listen to anything after that. To anyone.”
Cas hadn’t let his grip on Dean’s arm go yet. Dean reached up and placed his hand over Cas’ and squeezed. Cas squeezed back. They released each other’s grip at the same time, holding the gaze for a beat longer.
And then Dean realized: he hadn’t needed to say a word—Cas had already known. Cas had always known Dean the best, and Dean had always been too emotionally destructive to allow himself to acknowledge that someone was capable of that at all.
“I’ve always had an enhanced awareness for what you felt when I was able to understand it at all,” Cas corrected. “However, I chose not to remark on it most of the time, because it was clear you didn’t like it when I did.”
Finally, in a voice that almost seemed like it was coming from someone else, he said, without looking anywhere but his white knuckles against the black of the steering wheel, “Me too, Cas.”
“Is it heaven?” he asked drily. “Is that what’s got you so up and attentive to what I’m feeling? I barely even had a chance to be bothered and you’re already up in my grill.”
Excitement sparked to life in his chest, radiating out and zipping up his spine. He blinked rapidly, cycling through expressions of elation as it all came together in his head.
Cas looked over at Dean, hands folded neatly in his lap, and the scenery passed by around them, turning his dark hair flickering shades of golds and greens. Dean could see them flashing out of the corner of his eye.
“Is that—” Dean started, confused. “Is that possible? Can you just live on Earth like you did before?”
one, like they were some hotshot new monster of the week and Dean had been green all over again, meeting an early fate due to an ill-timed failure to move the right way at the right time.
“You can’t rain hellfire in—” Cas started as he dropped into the seat and shut his door, then stopped when he realized Dean wasn’t being literal.
But Dean didn’t know how to tell Bobby any of that. He didn’t know how to explain to Bobby why he’d done it. He didn’t have the words. He wasn't even sure he even knew them in the first place.
"During the war, my old man was sent off to Germany and Sammy and I were left with my Mom. Times were already tough but with my Dad gone, my Mom got herself a job at a factory. I usually stayed home and watched Sam but one day she just didn't come back home…
"Just place the boxes in over there and you can get going," said Father as he ran his fingers through Castiel's messy, black hair and kissed it before heading into the kitchen. Castiel could hear his mother shriek in surprise before there was another sound, laughter. He shrugged and did as he was told, placing the boxes in the living room.
"That would ruin the surprise, Cas. Trust me, you'll see it soon," said Dean, hugging the blue-eyed boy from the side.
"Whatever Winchester," was all he had to say as he picked up his ball and trudged away, Crowley following not too far behind.
"Whatever, just don't touch my stuff. Got it?" he growled, heading up the stairs and back to his room to sulk.
Castiel didn't know what to expect but was excited to go. It might've been a new home that he wasn't quite fond of but he did have one thing here that he didn't have back in California. A friend.
“That’s nice and all Jo but could you do us all a favor and run ahead to call an ambulance. You’ll have to head to Castiel’s place because I don’t have a phone at mine,” said Dean through gritted teeth.
"Or what about that time you tried to shoot a shotgun and ended up shooting your own foot at Aunt Rachel's wedding?" Raphael said, looking up from his book. It was rare for him to ever take part in this kind of matter but Castiel guessed that tearing into Uncle Marv made for a special occasion.
There was that phrase again. Dean would always use it to just end a conversation and leave things at that. It might've taken Castiel a while but he finally learned it meant to just stop talking. He was beginning to hate hearing that. But he knew Dean needed his space so he decided to just drop the whole thing. It wasn't worth the argument.
That was a bit weird too. What does she do that she didn't want Dean to know? Was she ashamed of her job? Was she a dancer? That would be pretty hot. Wait, that probably shouldn't be the first thing to jump to. Maybe she just has a job that he could easily find out who she is if she said it. That's more than likely the right answer.
"Y'all have to buy something if you're going to be in here," said the store owner. His nametag read Andy.
Castiel just turned his head to watch Dean laugh at his friends before he too got into the argument. The three of them were going at it for as long as they could. Cas found it funny but still kept his eyes on Dean, his mind racing with ideas on why Dean would want to become a firefighter and none of them good. He wanted to know more but knew he shouldn't push his luck. It was rude and Castiel hated to push people too far. But still, maybe it wouldn't hurt to just ask once.
"It is a really weird thought, maybe we'll just fall for girls with those colored eyes then," Castiel laughed nervously.
By the end of it, he just wanted to sit there and try to relax but begrudgingly got himself up. He looked in the mirror and groaned at the sight of a monocle drawn on his face with the words slut written across his forehead.
"I'm sorry, that wasn't very good," said Castiel, looking down at his fingers that were now in his lap, gripping each other.
"Well I guess I better get going, I'll see you whenever you get back from church. The sun will be up still by then, right?" Dean said, turning around and waving goodbye.
They all walked as quickly as they could, Benny in Michael's arms. When they got back, Mrs. Novak ordered Benny to be laid on the couch while she looked over him.
"Oh that? He tripped on a pebble and fell down that hill by old man Walker's place," Jo said with a shrug.
Almost to be expected, Michael and Naomi listened intently with the occasional head nod. Lucifer was picking at the scabs on his arms. Raphael fidgeted with his fingers, his eyes trained on the birds outside of the windows. Gabriel had somehow managed to sneak in some candy and sucked on them while playing with Anna, her little  hands pulling on Gabriel's fingers. Castiel kept a bible open and pretended that he was following along to his father's preaching but was on a completely different book of the bible, skimming through the chapters.
"Madame Missouri," Dean corrected himself, watching her as she traced her finger along the lines of his hand. "Well what does it say?"
"You're still here? Jesus, Castiel. I thought you would've been done with this hours ago," sighed Lucifer, trudging his way into the dinning room and sitting next to his baby brother.
"Get up, Dad! Get your ass up, you fucking piece of shit!" shouted Dean, kicking John over and over again. Tears started to trail down his face.
Dean just rolled his eyes and went into his room. A minute later he came out with his hands behind his back and stood in front of his brother.
The boys began to move some of the old boxes around, looking for the cause of the smell. Charlie tried her best to help but ended up getting distracted by a box that was filled with hay and books. What such a box was doing in there was beyond her.
Lost in thought, Dean stumbled into the fantasy section and began to look through there. Sam already had the big names. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, if you could name it Sam read it five times over. Maybe if Dean found something super obscure his little brother would be happy.
Immediately, Castiel jumped up and ran over to her. This ended the conversation Dean, Jo, and Benny were having and looked to see what Castiel was doing.
"We'll split up into two teams, the winning team has to do the other's chores at the Roadhouse for a week."
“Oh Benny! I’m so so very sorry, you know I wouldn’t have done that if I knew that was going to happen,” Jo kept repeating.
"Nah," said Dean and waved his hand. "If I want to learn an instrument, I want to learn something cool."
"Damn it! I thought I finally found something your nerdy ass hasn't read yet," Dean said with a shake of his head.
"Dean!" Castiel exclaimed, turning his head to see Dean's head over his shoulder and looking at the music sheets.
"I don't care about what you think, Cas! This is my life and I've handled it pretty good so far by myself."
Dean just nodded, stood, and left the tent. He was confused as the rest of his friends about what that woman meant. She must've been crazy with the fortunes she was giving out. They obviously couldn't have been real.
"Don't get a big head now," Benny warned, looking up from his napping place in the dirt. "If it gets any bigger you might topple over."
"Well is there anywhere we can go? I kind of want to try smoking these things right now if I have to wait here all day like this," Dean whined.
"What is it this time? I don't have any money," said Dean, worried about what another bet would cost him.
After turning off his lamp, he looked for the heaviest thing he could find and ended up with a baseball bat that Raphiel had given to him years ago. He got up from his bed and made his way to the window, taking his time with each step.
"Seriously, Cas? If I wanted to be lectured to I would've just asked my mother for advice. Is Dean there?"
"It's um… my name is Castiel," corrected Cas, embarrassed by the shyness in his voice. He must've sounded like a baby in front of Dean, though Dean looked like he didn't really care.
"I told you that because I didn't think you would use it against me, you bitch!" Dean groaned, his face red with shame.
Before it hit Castiel right in the face, Dean's hand caught Azazel's wrist and pushed him back. Castiel looked shocked but was happy to see Dean back him up.
The two of them chatted for a little bit longer before Bobby got back into his truck and turned the ignition.
"Thanks, that's pretty awesome," said Dean, surprised but not minding the sudden act of kindness… no matter how weird it was.
Castiel slowly looked up and at his window. Through his curtains he could make out the faint silhouette of a figure. A slender one that somehow made it to his window and Castiel only had one thought. Wolfman.
"Yeah, I don't know if it's just him but his whole family is weird so I figured it might just be a California thing," said Dean.
"That won't work, we need to get you enough for a ticket," mumbled Dean, who got to thinking, "I'll be back in a jiffy."
And with that being said, so far Castiel's first day was going by swimmingly. He was having the time of his life. He found out the school library had many, many books that nobody bothered to check out. He also learned so many new things while giggling with his friends. It was an all too new experience for him that he never knew he needed.
"When grandfather lived in the old country, they used to play music together as children," said Castiel fondly.
"So what were you doing up so late?" asked Dean, looking up at Castiel. His head laid gently on Castiel's pillow.
"They're a fictional race of short people with really big feet. They're from this book I've been reading, it's pretty good!" Charlie exclaimed.
"What?" Dean stopped in his tracks and looked at Castiel. He never heard his little book loving friend to ask about anything like that.
When Castiel had finally noticed, he jumped a little and waved nervously to her. Jo only nodded her head and walked out, following close to Dean. She knew he was hiding something and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.
"You don't have to be so rude Luci, moving can be quite the ordeal for anyone. Castiel's antisocial behavior just happens to make him the black sheep in our old town," corrected Michael, "Who knows, maybe all the hicks in Lawrence have social skills on par with our little Cassie's."
"New girl?" Dean asked, surprised that there was more than just Cas who ended up moving to Lawrence.
With a loud slam of his bedroom door, Dean pushed his dresser just enough to keep the door from opening. And just as he thought he was somewhat safe, the sporadic pounding against his door began only seconds later.
"You're just looking for something to complain about, huh? Didn't get enough sleep last night, did we?" smirked Raphael.
With a quick puff, Dean had his cigarette lit and then offered the flame to Castiel. The raven haired boy moved his close to the flame and locked eyes with Dean while he lit his cigarette.
With a little bit of elbow grease, Dean was confident that he could get the place looking as good as new.
Castiel blushed and pulled away, causing Dean to laugh. Shaking his head, Dean picked up the wooden slats and handed Castiel the tool box.
"I don't know about that, Cas. Church isn't really something I think I'm allowed to be at. I mean have you met my Dad? I'm pretty sure I'm banned for life or something," Dean joked.
The younger boy led Dean to an older looking building behind the church. When Dean asked what it was, Castiel told him it was the annex. They apparently only used the place under special circumstances like celebrations or baptisms.
"That's great, Cassie. At least one of us is making an effort here," said Gabriel, rubbing his hand in Castiel's mess of hair. "Once school starts I'm sure I'll be the most popular guy in school, but until then…"
"Well look at it this way; with that little attitude of your's, this'll do you some good," said Cas' Father, "this will be a chance for us to spread the good word of the Lord. Salvation is important."
Slowly getting up, Castiel made his way to his door. He turned his head to make sure that Dean was still sleeping before closing the door quietly and making his way to the bathroom.
"I'm not playing, Dad. Get up!" Dean growled, kicking his father's side as if he were trying to kick a ball.
He pitied him but also felt like he understood him a bit more. Castiel couldn't even imagine what it was like for Michael. The thought of having the same happen to him and Dean made Castiel want to die and to see Michael live his life still working to his fullest inspired him.
The nice cool breeze was a welcome change from the usual summer heat the children had gotten used to. It made their weekends much more bearable with the only downside being that it became less and less appealing to go to the pond for a swim. Summer hadn't even ended yet but with weather like this, the children were happy it was close to fall.
"And then right when I thought I was a goner, he came over and shared his snack with me," said Gabriel, telling his brothers of his new friend.
With that Dean had bolted up from his seat and ran to the phone, picking it up and waiting for the operator.
"I think we should go to the theater and see how long we can go between films before they kick us out," laughed Benny.
He felt sorry for all of them but he knew that if they saw their friend again, it would've made them feel a little better. Gabriel walked up to the counter and asked for Benny's room. Five minutes later they were in front of their friend's hospital room.
It hurt Dean to see Castiel like that but he had his reasons and he liked to stick to them. But as the seconds passed, he began to feel the sharp pain in his heart getting worse.
Dean could only give her a smile and a nod before looking back at the grave, listening to her leave. It really was nice to see her again. He would have to make a mental note to take her up on her offer but for now, he only wanted to be with Cas. He only wanted to see his ocean eyes again.
"I already did, they're on their way. Let's just get him to our home so he won't be dying out in this heat," said Michael calmly.
He couldn't help but stare at the text, not really knowing what to say. Sam had left a few hours ago and Dean just laid on his couch, staring at the message. He would type something, leave it as a draft only to delete it and try something else.
That caught Azazel by surprise and he just shook his head, turning away to leave. Castiel wondered how bad their fight must've been for Azazel to have that reaction.
Dean ate his food happily but out of the corner of his eye he could see Cas and Gabe whispering. Gabe shook his head which caused Castiel to jab his stomach with his elbow. The older brother thought for a minute and looked at his mother.
"You're goin' to the Novak place again? You might as well live with them at this point," laughed Bobby.
"Hey Dean, do you think Dad'll get mad about us being here?" asked Sammy, looking up at his older brother as he took another bite of his candied apple.
They all turned the corner when Benny gasped and pointed to a girl. Her brown hair was done just like Veronica Lake's and her dress looked to be the most expensive thing any of them had ever seen. When she smiled, it was almost infectious to the point the boys began to smile as well.
When they both reach the board, Dean pulled down the paper and read over it. It looked like it had been there for months with no one even bothering to give her a call.
"It'll be fine, Cas. You just gotta have faith in me, I'll get us out," Dean said, trying to cheer the other boy up.
They waved goodbye and marched their way to the paved road to wait for the bus. First off was the bus for the high schoolers with Michael, Lucifer, and Naomi getting on board. Before Michael left them, he put Raphael in charge while the rest of them waited for their own bus.
"I didn't buy this damned phone just for you to go and waste my money calling your little girlfriend," Ellen growled.
Charlie handed Castiel the book she had been carrying with her. The title was printed with big bold letters on the cover labeled
It took awhile for the children to all find a place that they thought would work out the best for their secret fort. Castiel had suggested that they use the shed next to his own home but sadly found out that it was locked tighter than Fort Knox. Jo suggested using the attic of the Roadhouse but Castiel said his father would never let him anywhere near a bar. Benny couldn't think of anything. In the end, during one of his old man's tantrums, Dean had run out of the house with Sammy and ended up finding an old shed about a mile away from his home.
"I'm sorry, Naomi. I'll get it right this time," said Castiel. He could tell she was about to go on another one of her legendary lectures that could make this lesson last for another four more hours.
The two boys had managed to make it back to Jo and Sammy, the both of which were taking bites out of a candied apple. Jo had taken to Castiel almost instantly, bombarding him with question after question. Cas didn't seem to mind, however, and answered all of them with a shy smile. The two talked for a while while Dean tried to sneak a bite of Sam's candied apple, earning himself a kick to the groin.
"Sorry," said Sam as he looked up at Castiel. It was obvious the kid didn't mean it but as long as he said Castiel was fine. He grew up with empty apologies from all of his siblings so hearing one from a stranger didn't bother him one bit.
Bobby came out of the room and closed the door gently before walking over to Dean. He helped the boy up and pulled up his shirt and coat to see the damage.
"Like… uh, bothering old man Walker?" Jo said, her voice sounding as if she already knew her idea was bad as soon as it left her lips.
The house was filled with Novaks. His family decided to have a surprise get together so now the household was filled with aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews. It was a good thing their new home was so big or else there wouldn't be enough room to fit all of them.
"She said she needed help with the essay for this week and I was stupid and offered to help her," Jo groaned.
"A telephone, Dean, it works pretty well too," said Jo, pointing to the rotary phone behind the bar.
Castiel couldn't help but laugh at his brother's poorly timed joke. It wasn't his fault Gabriel happened to let out some little jab at his uncle for leaving his wife for some twenty year old bartender. The man had it coming for commenting on Michael's inability to find a girlfriend. He was only sixteen after all and when he wasn't spending his time corralling his siblings, he was hard at work studying. Castiel always did find that an admirable trait of his brother, though he would never say it. Michael already had a big enough ego as is.
Dean held his hand out and Sam took it, the two walking alongside each other through the ever growing crowd. The older boy was walking with a purpose while the little one just strolled along, letting his big brother push past people.
"Don't be that way, Sammy," said Dean. He moved out of the way and gently nudged Sam to stand in front of Castiel. "Introduce yourself."
"I thought you liked him more because of that thing he does with his tongue," Jo whispered in Dean's ear.
“Drive that way, ‘bout twenty minutes,” Bobby told him, jabbing a thumb in a direction Dean barely paid attention to as he caressed Baby like he hadn’t seen her in years. “You’ll find someone you’re looking for.”
“You lost so much, Dean,” Cas continued where Dean didn’t say anything at all. “I’m not happy you’re here already—far from it, actually, I was furious when I first found out. You didn’t even
Bobby held him, grumbled a bit more, and then, when he was satisfied with his tongue lashing, sat Dean down on his porch and slapped a beer in his hand.
When the three of them made it to their classroom, it was practically empty. The only people in there were Benny, a group of girls, and a redheaded girl sitting by herself in the corner.
It was then that Castiel saw a duck in the pond and his mind soared with possibilities. Instead of a duck, he saw a dragon and like any knight, he would have to fight it. He made his way slowly to the foul beast, hiding in bushes and and grass until he was certain he could attack with ease. He jumped out from behind his hiding spot and pointed the dull blade at his enemy. The duck looked at him with curiosity.
"Yeah, her name was something like Linda or was it Lois? I don't know but Benny just kept on trying to chat her up," sighed Jo.
Benny screamed as he landed on the hardened floor, his arm bending in an unnatural way. While the bone wasn’t poking through the skin it sure looked like it wanted to. Dean ran straight to his friend’s side, checking out the damage. Jo screamed and apologized over and over again. Castiel could only stand and watch.
"Easy, Castiel. I just came to tell you that your friend is on the phone," said Naomi, petting Castiel's head gently.
It was old and looked as if it was held together by a thread. It's windows were cracked, the door broken, and the roof had several holes that needed to be patched. But the children didn't mind any of that, to them the old shed was a home away from home.
Dean just rolled his eyes and walked into the tent. The scent of old candles and lavender hit his nose like a train. Shadows seemed to surround the whole place and envelop it all in darkness except for the center of the tent. There sat an elderly black woman who smiled kindly at the boy.
"I bet!" exclaimed Dean, "I would love it too! The thought of living by a beach makes me real happy, I bet everybody living in Cali lives next to one."
Dean led the way with Castiel not far behind him. Charlie and Jo held onto the kitten, petting him. Benny walked at the back of the group, taking his time and taking in the sight of the setting sun. They all had been walking like this for about thirty minutes when Jo looked at Castiel and giggled.
"So nobody else has owned this book before? Nobody on the more attractive side?" Jo chimed in, leaning against Dean.
“I know Dean,” she said, looking up at him with a soft smile. “All that matters is that you were there in the end. I know that made him feel a lot better before he, y’know…”
Dean grumbled to himself as he wandered the bookshelves of the old Lawrence bookstore. Reading wasn't really his thing, he'd much rather be home relaxing to some Kansas or AC/DC to be honest. But he wasn't here for himself, Sam wrote down that he wanted books for his birthday so Dean was stuck trying to find something his brother would actually like.
"I went to that old bookstore on main and the guy just gave it to me for free, he was kind of weird about it."
Dean sat at the corner of the table and next to Castiel who was waiting patiently for everyone to calm down to begin to eat. Gabe sat next to Castiel and Lucifer. He was busy trying to make a paper airplane. Lucifer was having an argument with Michael who sat next to him. Mrs. Novak was next to Michael at one end of the table, setting up her plate. Next to her sat Anna who was busy sucking on a pacifier. Naomi was next and busy trying to figure out her schedule for the next day. After that was Raphael who was busy eye fucking the ham. Then Mr. Novak was sitting at the other end of the table who stood up and smiled.
Castiel could feel his eyes begin to tear up as he held onto Dean. Dean had this far gone look in his own eyes, it was almost as if he cried over this a hundred times over and had no more tears to shed.
When Castiel stepped into the building, he smiled and waved to the girls who were sitting on an old couch. Jo had her fingers in Charlie's hair, braiding it effortlessly.
"We're about to have dinner so come on in… I'll go get you some clothes," said Gabe and went to find some clothes while leaving Dean in the front hall.
It was nice though that Dean didn't have to join in their uncivilized behavior because Castiel had tapped his shoulder and handed him a plate with the best he had managed to find. He took the plate and winked at Cas almost instinctively which caused Castiel to blush.
"Wha?" Dean felt his heart skip a beat, his own face blushing. His first kiss? He always pictured it being with a hot girl or something but the thought of it being his new best friend. Well that just made it even better.
Dean stood silently before shaking his head no in defeat. The most he had ever done was hold a girl's hand before and that was when Jo was still trying to walk. Does that even count?
"You think so? I'm just glad I found you, I finally got rid of Gabriel only to find myself lost," said Castiel, licking his thumb and rubbing Dean's cheek clean. "It was a miracle I found someone I knew."
The fact that it was his own room that he didn't have to share with his siblings was also a plus in his book. Much better than sharing one with Gabriel and Raphael, much better indeed.
"I'm surprised, he actually managed to make it through the whole thing," said Michael, the faintest sound of a laugh escaping his lips.
The sun was already setting when they finally managed to make it to the old house they were soon to call home.
After ten minutes, the Novak children were finally ready to leave for school. They were all lined up from oldest to youngest, waiting for their father to finish his morning prayer with them before they could leave.
Dean had called all of them to the pond near Castiel's house to talk about it yet no one really had an answer. Benny and Jo just kept on bickering about whose idea was better while Sam just shrugged it off. Castiel was stuck in his book, not really focusing on anything at hand. It was hopeless. School was in less than two weeks and Dean wanted to spend it doing something big, something bold. But it seemed like none of his friends could really agree on what to do.
Just like Dean had thought, Castiel was absolutely terrified by the film. Several times during the movie, he would scream and hide his face behind either his hands or Dean's arm. He didn't mind much, he was just more concerned about how the other boy would feel once he was home alone.
"Because you're about to eat my dust," said Dean as he punched Castiel's arm and bolted across the dirt road in front of his house.
The phone from the kitchen began to ring. Lucifer snickered as he walked away, waving goodbye to his baby brother.
"Don't listen to him, he's an idiot. Lucifer just likes to get into people's heads and mess with them," Naomi said, rubbing Castiel's back.
"I don't know because she said it was a newer phone and she had to transfer over all of her contacts and some of them might've not gone through all the way. So maybe she always had that number?"
While Sam kept Andy busy, Dean handed Castiel some gum and chocolate. Castiel did as he was told but he looked so awkward and nervous anybody with a brain could tell what they were doing. Lucky enough, Andy didn't have a brain.
Now for the other children, they didn't care all too much for the topic at hand so instead went back to their previous conversation on Halloween costumes.
"You have all disappointed me. I'm going to take a swim in the pond to cool off and when I get back, you all have to have an idea on how to end our summer vacation," Dean huffed and turned away from his friends. He walked over to the water, threw off his shirt and jumped in.
