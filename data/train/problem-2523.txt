Cas was almost disappointed, but only because he’s never really had that. Not that he wanted it, right? “Yeah, I have enough food. Follow my car.” He jumped in the car and led Dean to his studio.
As Cas stares at the invitation his best friend just handed him, he can’t help but want to strangle her. “We don’t even get to pick our own?” he asks. “You’d think if your plan is to throw a Halloween sex party, you’d at least let people pick their own partners.”
“No. Dammit Cas, can’t you just let someone in this world give a fuck about you? You’re my baby brother and I’d like it if you didn’t
His green eyed devil wouldn’t be back for seconds and Cas frowned at the feelings that stirred inside of him. He shouldn’t care... they haven’t even fucked yet. This dude might suck in the sack... but even as he thought that, he knew it wouldn’t be true. This was about to the the best fuck of his life and then they would part ways
“Yes. I was lucky enough to only have a mild case. I tested positive last week after I felt the symptoms for a few days, I didn’t have a hospital stay.”
“Hiya, Cas.” Dean was happy his voice sounded strong, and didn’t give away his true needy feelings inside.
“Sure I did, give me the bag.” Dean snatched it back to continue his search, finding another bottle and shaking the bottle towards Cas aggressively. “That’s what I thought.”
Dean laughed at the stinging pain in his lip and sucked the blood from it, his eyes dancing. He wiggled a little, testing Cas’ grip on his throat but his angel
Cas slumped onto the ground when Dean fucked his way through his own orgasm and there was a ringing in his ears as Dean came back into focus and he laughed. Actually,
the time. But the man grunted, first sitting and then laying on the plush rug that covered the hardwood floors. Cas didn’t bother looking at Dean as he straddled Michael and slowly sank down, moaning a little louder than strictly merited as he felt his ass stretch further to accommodate him. “Fuck, yeah. So big, baby.” He bit down on his bottom lip and leaned back, bracing his hands on Michael’s thighs and his feet on the ground. He bounced eagerly as Michael thrusted up hard, the sound of his body smacking against Cas’ in the process loud enough to drown out most other noises. He tipped his head back as far as it would go and got an upside-down view of Dean
Though as he gives it some more thought, he’d bet all the money in the world that she’s making Benny come as Bruce Banner, and if that’s the case…
“Wait I got one! Four, she’s married to a chick. Deano here doesn’t have the right parts anyway.” Charlie slapped Dean’s back and walked away.
eyes. The release felt good, and the power balance in his life returning to normal felt even better. But this time, the hunger returned almost instantly. Everything about that felt muted, weak,
Luckily for all of them, Charlie sees the desperation and giggles at them. “Just go, you two. You won’t be able to function, anyway.”
“Erm… yeah.” Cas felt himself blush and couldn’t help but laugh at whatever was going on in his chest.
Cas’ mind is sluggish, but he recognizes that something is changing with them. As he flicks his tongue playfully across Dean’s bottom lip, he realizes with a jolt that he got off without an excess of lube
Dean was dumbfounded at how quickly he got on board with the idea of fucking a dude, but now that he was, he was a little pissed at himself for waiting so long. If Cas’ mouth was any indication of what other guys could do, he’d been robbing himself of awesome orgasms for years.
Dean tossed his bag on the seat between them and started his car. He attempted to clear the red from his vision long enough to breathe and ask an important question. “Did you ask for this?”
Dean reached down to tug Cas’ hair with a satisfied look on his face. “Get to watch you this time, sweetheart.” He spread his legs and propped himself up on his other elbow. “Wanna see you jack off while you blow me.”
Dean blinked at the photo but didn’t miss a beat at Cas’ story. He poked the picture of Cas, “Look at that, the eyes are all wrong. And his bags are in the trunk, if you don’t believe him. I’m trying to get him outta the city.”
“Good boy, Dean. Breathe for me, you're still so tight.” He slides a hand down Dean’s spine until his broad hand closes around his neck. Powerful hips snap, and Dean’s shoulders dip further into the mattress each time until he's suffocating in the best of ways.
“Yeah, course I can, angel. I’ll be back, okay?” He got dressed quickly and reminded Cas to call if he needed anything else, then left.
His back arches as he tries to push himself to all fours, but there’s no escaping… not that any part of him truly wants to. The tighter Dean holds him, the more forcefully he pins them together, the surer Cas becomes that he’s been ruined for anyone else. “Do it, Dean,” he whispers. “Please. Let me feel it.”
Dean grins and rolls his hips again, baring his neck a little for Cas. “Good. But first... how ‘bout you give me some more of that Christmas spirit?”
“I get it,” Dean repeated. Once upon a time, he’d have actually done what Cas was thinking without hesitation... but it seemed the further Dean was pulled back into reality and faux normalcy, Cas was pushed farther from it. Like they were trading places.
"Yeah, Car. Like anal. Like I kinda wanna fuck you in the ass, that clear enough?" Dean grinned, trying to make sure she knew he wasn't gonna be a jerk about it. "I'm just sayin', I've been a good boy lately."
“Absolutely, I’m not saying yes until you do.” They laughed it off together but Dean had already been planning on doing exactly that.
Dean doesn’t move, he’s happy Cas has the same desire he does but having to wait until next Christmas sounds like torture. That eyebrow has Dean wanting to drop to his knees right then and there, but before he can even respond with words, Lisa wraps her arms around him from behind and slides a hand in the front of his pants.
The more minutes that ticked by, the more he started to doubt himself. By the time his phone vibrated, Dean had cleaned the rest of his mess from earlier, changed his sheets, vacuumed his room, drank
So, when Charlie insists that he comes to her annual ‘Santa’s Lay’ party, he's cautiously optimistic. An annual party means a tradition he's not yet a part of, but that's okay. He's got this. How bad can it be?
“Couple of weeks? Dean, it’s a mandatory 30 day quarantine, it’s more than a couple of weeks. This virus is no joke, and uh… speaking of that…” Charlie trailed off, and the tone of her voice had him more nervous than anything else.
Dean kept a rough grip on Castiel’s hair as he guided his length over the man’s bottom lip, spreading the precum over the pink, chapped skin. He pulled his cock just out of reach. Finally back in control, he was no longer in such a hurry. “Lick your lips. Tell me how I taste.”
Dean averted his eyes and shook his hands to get the water off as he searched for a paper towel. “Not in the ass.”
“I kept waiting for you to make a move. I realize now you were just trying not to pressure me, but...” Cas reached down to squeeze himself, breathing heavily. “I was starting to think you didn’t want to.”
him sounded too fucking enticing. Even if it was only for a little while. Castiel parted his lips for Dean, allowing him to have everything he wanted and by the time the kiss ended, he was fully hard in his suddenly too tight jeans, his entire cock on display as he reached down to palm himself.
Cas hesitates for a moment and then gets up, moving to Dean’s side of the booth. “I obviously can't say what the future will hold, but Dean… I think you're remarkable.” He places his hand gently on Dean’s thigh and leans in to kiss his cheek. “And eventually, you're going to get tired of hearing me say that, because I have no filter when it comes to pointing out how much people amaze me.”
Dean wasn’t able to respond with words. He pushed inside with a moan, his eyes slamming shut as Cas’ tight ring of muscles let him by. He bottomed out quicker than he meant to, but Cas felt so good he wasn’t about to last long regardless. “So fucking tight.”
Dean opens his mouth, desperate to explain—no words come out. Panic starts to make his heart race and his skin feel hot and cold all over. If he can’t talk, Cas won’t understand. Cas will leave.
“Really sorry for botherin’ you,” the guy—Cal?—says for like the third time. Dean had been chopping onions in the kitchen when Cal knocked on the doorframe and asked for help with his truck. Apparently, Sam had sent him straight to Dean, and if Cal’s skittish attitude and the way he shifted his weight from foot to foot were anything to go by, he’d rather have gotten no help at all.
They're looking at the pictures on Cas's phone first because he took more. There's a few more that make Dean snicker—Sam trying and failing to get sand out of his hair. Eileen and Jack and Dean throwing seaweed at each other. There's one where Dean took a particularly nasty smelling bunch right in the kisser, but he can laugh at that too because while it was disgusting it was also really funny and the moment Cas caught looks straight out of a cartoon.
Dean swallows. Cas is leaving. “Sure.” Dean inclines his head towards the TV. “Wanna watch somethin’?”
Dean claps Cas on the shoulder, “C’mon buddy, l-l-let’s go.” And then he trips over his feet in his haste to get away and the only reason he doesn’t fall flat on his face is that Cas is quick enough to steady him. He doesn’t turn around to check if anyone saw that, just makes a beeline toward where he’d parked Baby.
,” he reads. “I’d like to learn how to surf one day, it looks like fun.” He puts the cap down and picks up the juice, then turns to Dean with a smile. “Thank you!”
Dean would rather keep doing the kissing thing but there’s something in Cas's voice that makes him pay attention. Baby creaks when he shifts in his seat and sits up straighter.
Instead of getting with the program, Cas sighs and gets up and starts collecting the plates. “Come on, I'll help you clean up.”
With a sigh, Castiel lets the door click shut behind him and then sits down on the bed behind Dean. Dean doesn't verbally acknowledge him but Castiel can see his back tense.
Cas cups his cheek, and Dean gasps when he feels the touch of his Grace, barely keeping himself from flinching away. And then it's quiet, and dark. Everything falls away, and the pain goes with it.
Castiel looks at the photos for a long time, and then quietly and carefully wraps the album in the wrapping paper Dean had used.
Dean’s just an asshole that yells at his family when they worry about him. A man that doesn’t let his partner near him and lies to him about the reasons why.
The banner that spells Happy Birthday is already hung up over the table, and Eileen is retrieving the cake they'd baked from the fridge. They'd hid it at the very back, behind Sam's extra healthy smoothies (that, to Dean's delight and Sam's dismay, Jack finds just as disgusting as Dean, though he is more polite about it).
Something desperate arises in Castiel and he leans forward and steals a second kiss. Dean smiles into it, his mouth sticky with syrup, his soul so strong and so fragile in Castiel’s hold.
Obviously, this is affecting Dean for reasons Castiel doesn’t know, but he’s content to wait until Dean is ready. And if he’s never ready, that’s okay too.
Cas and Jack are playing Scrabble on one of the beds. Dean would ask where they got it from, except the motel probably provided it and also he doesn't care. Jack asks Dean to join, then looks absurdly guilty when he remembers why Dean can't. Dean just waves him off. He's tired and he wants to lie down, he just doesn't want to be alone.
A lump forming in his throat and his legs shaky, Dean only just manages to open Baby's driver's side door before he collapses into the seat. The plate in his lap, he leans on her steering wheel with a hand over his eyes, his breath shuddering wetly in and out.
Dean hasn't said a word since he cried earlier. It's not unusual for him to go nonverbal when in distress or when he has a bad speech day, but Castiel isn't sure which one it is right now. When he asks about it, Dean blocks three times before finally getting out "T-t-too ha-a-ard-d-d."
If they didn't have guests, Castiel is sure that Dean would long since have made himself at home with his head on Castiel's shoulder, snoring directly into his ear.
separation anxiety. It can't be that, because that's a level of pathetic he doesn't know how to deal with.
Dean snuggles back into Cas and nudges his phone back towards him. “C’mon, show me what else you got, big guy.”
“Dean… is this what you meant when I asked if it had something to do with Michael? Because what he did to you—”
"For m-m-me?" The paper crinkles as Dean opens the bag to look inside, and then his whole face lights up. "Dude,
Dean sounds pouty and defensive. Feeling that warmth spread through him again, Castiel is quick to reassure Dean, “If there are things that never end, I do hope that this is one of them.”
Cas gives up trying to move Dean and goes back to stroking a hand over Dean’s back and his hair. “Please talk to me. I don’t… I don’t know what to do, Dean.”
A painful, electric shiver of panic zips through Dean. He can feel his face heat, and Sam must mistake his shame for embarrassment because he huffs out a breath of laughter.
"D-did you even look f-f-for me?" The corners of Dean’s mouth are turned down and his shoulders are rounded and small. Under other circumstances, this would lead to Castiel softening towards him, giving Dean the reassurance he obviously needs. Right now, all he wants is to get out of the store as fast as possible and the delay is irritating him, chipping away at the last vestiges of his patience.
Cas still looks worried, so Dean nudges him a little with his shoulder. “Hey. We're g-g-good, 'kay?”
Eileen and Jack shake with laughter while Dean glares murder at Cas. Unfazed, Cas reaches out and wipes something off of Dean’s chin. “You had some syrup there.” It sends the other two into another round of laughter, which is completely excessive in Dean’s opinion.
Sam hesitates. "Maybe later, when he's feeling a little better. Don’t take this the wrong way, but I think right now, the  two of you are just going to distress each other. Cas—" Sam heads off his impending complaints, "listen. I know it's important to you both to take care of each other. And I'm not saying that's bad. Couples should be caring for each other. But right now, neither of you can take care of the other. So let us help."
Dean needs a moment to digest that. There’s a part of him that wants to insist that what Cas is talking about is Dean’s job, that it
Carefully, Castiel lies down next to him, choosing to leave the lamp on for now. He tucks the blanket over Dean and curls his fingers around his wrist where it’s resting beside his head.
Dean sighs, and squeezes Cas's hand again, and then leaves to go enjoy their excellent water pressure for a precious five minutes.
Dean's so busy scowling at them, he totally misses Cas taking Dean's plate. When Cas puts it down in front of him again, there's a helping of vegetable filling on the side, crowding in on his nice and tasty beef.
Dean would rather stay standing, but he’s far too exhausted for that. He sits down in one of the chairs while Sam sits down at the edge of the table.
Dean shakes his head. “Nothin’, just um.” He drops his gaze into his lap where he’s nervously playing with his fingers. “Wanted to say thank you. It wouldn’t be the same, if you. If you weren’t here—” Dean’s throat clicks, his lashes are wet. He licks his trembling lips and tries again, “Sometimes I still wake up and I, I just get so scared.”
So far, Dean’s never had a seizure two times in a row—which, yeah, would be bad. But it hasn’t happened. And even if it did, the sensor would alert Cas anyway. And Cas knows that and he knows that Dean knows he knows.
A part of him wants to hold onto his anger, but it flows out of him with every mile Baby eats up. Shame fills the empty space it leaves behind, leaving him with heartburn and a persistent prickling heat behind his eyes. His phone has gone silent.
Sam looks after his brother for a moment and then he sighs, fumbling with the keys. Eileen puts a hand on his arm and starts signing, expression soft with sympathy. Castiel turns away to give them privacy, trying to settle into a more comfortable position. It’s just then that Jack returns from using the restroom in the diner down the street
resting. You know there's no way to completely ensure he won't have an episode. They just happen. And when they happen, we deal with it. As a
“Obviously there’s still some leftover grace inside of you,” Cas continued. “Theoretically, as you’re a vessel, it shouldn’t harm you. But it’s possible that whatever Michael did to ‘keep the door open’, has done something to you. Or it has something to do with you trapping him inside your mind and him violently breaking out. There’s—”
He’s aware he’s crying again but he keeps his eyes shut and his body tense and still. Cas sounds wrecked too when he asks, “Is it just me, or—”
Chuck had looked at Dean then, contempt written all over his face. “Like you. You know, if you’d just done what you were supposed to, I’d maybe have shown mercy and snapped my fingers and
“It’s alright, I can—I can talk about it, a little. ‘Bout nine years ago, when I still had my apartment, there was a break-in. Never even saw the intruder. Or I guess if I did, I can’t remember. He shot me in the head. Bullet’s still in there,” she says, tapping a finger against her temple. “Did some real damage. I can’t hunt anymore, can’t work. I lost my home. If I don’t get my meds every day, I’d die.”
Cas doesn't move his hand away but he also doesn't move it at all. “Do you want something, Dean?” He asks, all quiet amusement. Dean can hear the kid try and fail to suppress a chuckle.
Any other day, Dean might use the opportunity to jerk off, just for that extra bit of relaxation. But today, that'd be a recipe for disaster. He doesn't think he could look Cas in the eye after, or even be around him without blushing like a repressed maiden. No, no, no. Not doing that. He turns the shower to cold until the urge passes, and that's it.
Getting up on shaky legs, Dean digs through his drawer for a towel and after making sure the coast is clear, sneaks into the showers.
He was about to turn his attention back to the movie when Cas put a hand on his shoulder. “Dean,” he said, his tone more serious than before, “I just wanted to say thank you for this. I’ve been—I’ve missed spending time with you like this.”
Cas shifts on the bed, avoiding Dean’s eyes. He looks like he’s as surprised as Dean is by what he just said.
Castiel sits down in the chair beside the bed and takes Dean’s hand in both of his as Dean lifts it up to be held.
Watching Dean now, Castiel feels a responding ache in himself, as he always does when Dean is hurting in some way. But there is fondness there as well at seeing Dean trying so hard to do this for Jack.
“Dean,” he’d said, with such gravity, like they were standing at the altar about to say their vows. “I would like to kiss you. May I?”
“I wished I could do more to help,” Molly is says, her voice heavy with regret. “But actual hunting… I can’t do that anymore.”
“Since when is it cheesy for me to say that I adore you?” Castiel teases him gently, something about Dean being shy like this drawing out his playful side.
“Can’t g-g-get it right. ‘S l-l-like I’m tryna write fucking K-K-Klingon upside down with a broken ha-ha-hand.” Angrily, he shoves some of the balled-up papers away, and they roll off the table and fall to the floor. There’s tension all the way down his back and his eyes are red and glassy.
It's not that Dean doesn't know how to ask, it's that he doesn't think he could handle the answer. He can't handle a lot these days.
Frowning, Dean takes one of Cas's hands and squeezes. “Cas, c’mon. Don’t do th-that. T-t-talk to me.”
“Okay, one, two, cheese!” Castiel announces and then clicks on the shutter several times. Dean makes a funny face and then laughs when he sees the result.
“You know you do the same for me, right? When things—well, when things go bad, I feel like you’re the only being in the entire universe who I have any connection to. I know I can go to you, and you will understand.”
Swallowing hard to keep the emotion that wants to spill out of his mouth and eyes contained, Dean nods. Eileen reaches out and squeezes his arm, her grip warm and strong. He only just manages not to tense up. When she lets go and moves to get out the cutlery, he takes a deep breath and blinks his eyes to keep them dry.
Dean hums in reply and fiddles with the coffee machine to have an excuse to keep his back to Cas while he tries to remember how to act like a normal person. Or like normal Dean at least, instead of humiliatingly twitterpated Dean.
When he’s ready, Castiel helps him stand and steadies him while he walks. Dean shields his eyes with one hand and stumbles every couple of steps.
Dean scowls, and says nothing, and adds sugar and milk and a pinch of cinnamon to his coffee since no one is paying him enough attention to notice anyway. He could dance the hula for all the attention Cas is giving him.
He opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue, and he doesn’t wait long for what he’s after. “Dean,” Cas grunts, spurting hot, delicious come exactly where he wanted it. Cas’ movements get erratic as he empties fully but keeps moving, gasping as his thighs start to shake.
The walk up to the door was done in a haze as guilt pooled in his stomach. Nick opened the door before Dean could even knock.
He gently removed himself from Cas’ grip and tilted his head curiously. “You presented yourself like a corner slut. One of the first pieces of information you offered about yourself was how much you
He tucks his knees up to change the angle and moans like a whore when Dean hits his sweet spot — and between that and Dean's hand, Cas is a goner. "Fuck racing. Come with me... Gods, I'm so pissed I won't feel you fill me up," he growls. "Come, Dean. Now."
The kiss gets messier as they get closer to release and the whimper Dean makes after a particularly hard thrust has Cas tugging Dean’s hair and biting his lip almost desperately. He shifts just enough that the head of his cock brushes Dean’s tip, and it sends him over, coming in spurts between their bodies.
Cas hated himself for that slip. He didn’t fucking beg. But no one had ever had him writhing this way before. He would have felt shame if Dean hadn’t slid his fingers inside his tight hole. Cas didn’t fuck as often as of late and wondered if Dean would notice.
“Yeah actually, he has blue eyes and is named Castiel.” Dean took a step forward. “Think he might be interested?”
Cas started laughing, but realized the movement was about to do exactly that, so he stopped. “Then I suppose we’ll just have to kick everyone out early so we can do it again. Do you think I was too loud?”
He shook his head with a laugh and clapped Benny on the shoulder. “In all seriousness, thank you, man. You really did me a solid here, and I hope it’s not another two years before we see each other again.”
“No, I want to. I want to be able to say ‘I’m going to my boyfriend’s house’ and it just be a normal thing. I want to think and talk about you freely with the ones I love. I can sit here for weeks and worry about how they would respond, or I can walk in there and get it done. I choose the latter.” Dean’s fond smile made him blush again. “What?” Cas asked when he took too long to speak.
The atmosphere in the kitchen was light and joyous as he entered the room, which was a much needed change after the last several days. “Morning, assholes! Party’s over, huh?” Dean grinned and swiped a piece of bacon from the plate.
“He’s pan. You remember Lee from last year? They dated for a couple months and broke up over the summer before he moved away to Texas. He’s been out for like a year - you seriously didn’t know?” Charlie looked at him like it was unbelievable, but how would he know? Jocks are almost
Cas pushed back and tried to tweak his nipple again, but Dean grabbed Cas’ wrist so quickly his eyes widened. They locked eyes and Dean could see the beautiful blue disappear as his pupils blew.
When Dean was finished pumping gas, he drove the rest of the way to Sioux Falls. He had no idea where Cas actually lived, but he knew his hangouts. He tried the bar and the diner they’d gone to and came up empty. He drove past apartment buildings looking for his car, remembering that Cas mentioned a studio one time. Still, nothing. He searched the town for hours and wasn’t any closer to finding his angel and he had no way to contact him, so he finally decided to give into his hunger and started looking for a place to get a meal. Not a half a mile later, he spotted Castiel's car in the parking lot of a coffee shop.
“Same here, Cas. Fuck… come over. I know that shit would be even more amazing if I could touch you.”
He tries, but he can't get any words out. Everytime Cas opens his mouth, all he does is moan, rocking up and sinking back down on Dean’s cock and reaching up to brace himself on the ceiling. Finally, he manages a “fucking fuck, I love your cock” as he starts moving faster, his own length smacking Dean’s torso with each movement.
She huffed a laugh. “Oh, you know me. No way I’m gonna let something as stupid as a cold take me out. I’m a damn queen, plagues are for peasants.”
isn't worth fucking up your life. I don’t deserve your help, if you want to save someone so bad, find someone worthy.” The look in Castiel’s eyes was heartbreaking, he
Just the thought of Dean being in his apartment had his cock swelling in his sweats. This would be the first time he blew Dean without a blinder on, and by the time he walked back out, he was actually excited for it.
Cas was still smiling. “I don’t know, I think it has some bearing. Maybe you should call him back here so he could tell you there is no case.”
Nick smiled to himself as he pocketed his phone and got back to work. Maybe those idiots would work it out on their own after all.
Cas watched him strip before doing the same, “I meant to ask that day but I was a little distracted.” They hadn’t spoken of that drop yet and Cas didn’t want to.
“Interesting. I was under the impression from the questionnaires you completed before starting that Castiel’s father had passed on, almost ten years ago in fact,” she deadpans, then turns to Cas. “Is that not right?”
Cas nipped Dean’s jaw with a grin, “Feeling bitey today baby. You sure?” He joked as he lowered himself to Dean’s cock, licking it before Dean could respond.
Cas chuckled, “I think that mouth can convince me a little better than your voice.” Cas’ voice was deepened with arousal, this may not be the real Dean but Cas was fucking horny.
They still haven’t talked about it. Cas isn’t surprised, and he’s also not complaining. While he’s accidentally, absolutely fallen head over heels for his supposedly-straight best friend, he’ll take what he can get. As it turns out, that includes — but isn’t limited to — multiple orgasms a day.
“After what you just said, I’m picturing you on your knees with your pretty mouth wrapped around me, and I’m fucking my fist, slow and hard. I just added some lube, and fuck, with your noises in my ear… It all feels incredible. So fucking good, Dean.” Dean heard some shuffling, and then the slick sounds of wet flesh coming together. “Can you hear that, Dean?”
“Yeah, please do.” Dean kissed him, his hands wrapping around the small of his back as his tongue slipped inside Cas’ mouth for the first time.
Dean hummed, rolling over to bite Cas’ neck. “Yeah. Woulda been better if you still had my dick in your mouth, but I’ll take what I can get.”
blood. “Bite me harder next time baby, or maybe I can just bite you and taste your blood while I ride you against this raggedy cross.” Cas rutted up against Dean. “You gonna let me up?”
Today wasn’t Tuesday but he still always smiled at the man’s garden, even if he wasn’t outside. He ran up and watered it for him, then went on his way, hoping he wouldn’t run into anyone from his past.
Cas slid off his clothes and straddled Dean, lining himself up. “Who’s angel am I?” He asked, as he slid painfully slow down Dean’s cock, relishing the burn.
And there it was, Nick’s wall became sound. “Woah, you really think I would rat on my brother?” Dean could see the anger on Nick’s face. “He isn’t a drug addict okay. Can I close the door now?” If Dean wasn’t a cop, Nick would have slammed the door a long time ago.
“Jealous of what? It’s just a dude to me. For one I’m not interested in dudes and for two, if I was, he likes me more than you anyway.”
Dean’s cock was pressing painfully against his jeans by the time Cas finished. “Jesus Christ, Cas.” He pulled him into a sloppy kiss, his hand wrapped tight around the back of his head. He broke it abruptly as he heard David’s shoes slamming against the table in an effort to slide himself off of it. Dean’s predatory grin turned quickly lethal. “Playtime, angel.”
For a moment, Cas doesn’t move at all. His hand stills, and Dean thinks he might’ve said something wrong... but the purple, pulsing head of Cas’ cock says otherwise. “Dean... you’re beautiful.” He squeezes himself and a bead of precome leaks out, running over his finger as he twists his hand. “So beautiful.”
“No, I’ll be right there, I’ll even wear my red lace lingerie. You’ll see it before and after he leaves and you can touch all over me while he sucks you off. Deal?”
“Yes, Dean?” He asked breathlessly. They bore into each other's eyes, both men trying to find words before Cas’ phone began to ring, breaking the trance.
They didn’t last long at the dance. The decorations were superb, but it was boring. Especially when all the “cool kids” skipped it all together for that party. After thirty minutes, Charlie was pulling Cas’ arm back toward her car. “Let’s go have some real fun.”
“Kinda hard to get off when it’s obvious as hell you aren’t into it. But whatever, it ain’t like you taste the greatest either, y’know.”
“Nope. You?” Dean asked, not even bothering to ask Cas if he was gay — not that it was a secret. Dean wasn’t the first person to guess right about Cas.
Dean closed his fist around Cas’ throat before he could think about breaking his own rule and killing him without blood. His own eyes took on a wild glint as he squeezed, no longer attempting to control but attempting to kill. He was aware that Cas’ legs tightened around his waist and pulled him in further, he
“It’s Thursday. We have school tomorrow, but I don’t think you will be there.” She told her friend she would be right back and steered Dean down a hallway. “Where do you normally stay when you sleep here?”
Cas slid Dean inside his mouth, knowing this was about to drive him crazy. He bobbed and hummed, pulling out all of his tricks to get a reaction out of Dean, so when they finally found a spot to pull over he would be so turned on he would fuck Cas’ ass
As they walk in, it's immediately clear that their relationship is flourishing. They're so close to each other that it's a wonder they're able to move forward at all — it brings to mind children at a picnic doing a three-legged race, though it's not something that comes across as awkward or unmanageable. They simply can't stay away from each other.
Dean walked in and left the door cracked, probably for Cas’ sake but it really was unnecessary, Cas knew he was safe with Dean. He always knew that. Cas’ issues were his own, and he felt shitty he had put so much on Dean.
When Cas popped off, he gazed at Dean through hooded eyelids, his pupils blown with lust. “Fucking delicious, sweetheart.” Cas’ voice is hoarse from the blowjob but he sounds pleased and the praise from Cas sent a chill up Dean’s spine.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks once Dean’s turned the engine over and eased Baby back into traffic. A sudden stab of fear goes through Dean that Cas could think Dean might be embarrassed over strangers knowing they’re a couple.
Carefully, Castiel wraps himself around Dean from behind, tangling their legs together and putting a hand on his chest. Dean’s t-shirt beneath his flannel is soft and warm from his body heat, and beneath, Castiel can feel the beat of his heart. Dean doesn’t move his arm away but he goes pliant and leans into where they’re touching all the way down their bodies. His heart rate changes from stressed to relaxed, and his breath slows and deepens.
“I’d like to see them try,” Cas growls, darkly, but a beat later his shoulders slump. “No, actually I would not like to see them try. I would like to see you safe, not threatened.”
He leaves, and Dean clenches his jaw against the stab of pain that goes through his heart. His movements sluggish and his limbs feeling heavy as lead, Dean peels himself out of his clothes at a snail’s pace until he’s down to his tee and underwear. He shoves the pile of clothes off the bed and down onto the pillows arranged around it for protection. Then he crawls under the covers and lies down.
Dean scowls at the commanding tone and grumpily gets up and stomps into the bathroom. When he comes back, Cas is still where he left him, and though he seems exasperated at Dean’s—totally justified—grumpiness, he opens his arms and lets Dean settle against him again. Dean hugs his arms around Cas's waist and Cas reaches over and turns off the bedside lamp, enveloping them in darkness.
“I just wanted to get some water,” Castiel grouses, but Dean isn’t having it. He pushes Castiel back to sitting and fills the glass at the sink. Then he curls up on the bed next to him, watching the TV with a closed-off expression.
Dean moves on to the leek while Eileen cleans up the potato peels and drags the biggest pot they own out of the cupboard. They chat idly while they work, and when the soup is bubbling on the stove, they move the cutting boards and knives to the sink to be washed with the dishes later.
A silent sob claws its way out of Dean. Tears have begun to fall thickly and his chest constricts. Dean lets his head fall, cradling it in his hands. He cries freely and quietly, emotion racking his body. Silence fills the room, disrupted only by Dean’s anguish, so intense it’s almost palpable.
Heart heavy, the angel pushes on. “But I think I know- I think I know now. Happiness isn’t in the… having. It’s in just being. It’s in just saying it.” Hot tears pool in his eyes, threatening to spill over. As he speaks, Castiel feels a new sense of acceptance. Love. That feeling behind his ribs - love - it grows and fills him. It drowns out his qualms, reminds him that
“Wait, there is-” he stammered, momentarily unsure of himself. “There is one thing she’s afraid of. There’s- there’s one thing strong enough to stop her.” Castiel turns to Dean, watching as his expression turns to that of confusion. “When Jack was dying, I- I made a deal to save him.”
Dean tries to say it back, but the words won’t come. Trying to speak feels like trying to swallow broken glass, and all he manages is a mangled breath.
Crumpled on the ground, Dean sits with his eyes wide and tears clouding his sight. When did he start shaking? He looks down at his hands and sees them trembling, but they feel distant. Those don’t look like his hands. His gaze darts around the room, instinctively assessing for any potential danger. Green eyes pass over the space the Empty emerged from and linger on the space where Castiel stood just moments before. Dean can’t find it in himself to move. His breathing is uneven and he feels uncomfortably vulnerable.
A gurgling sounds from behind Dean, and he turns, eyes fighting back tears, to get a glimpse of the entity about to take away his best friend. Viscous black void materializes and oozes towards Castiel with malice. Billie breaks through the door with a loud smash, causing Dean to snap back towards Cas with trepidation. Dean’s blood runs cold and his insides seem to contort and writhe; his breathing quickens. This can’t be real. Everything is happening too fast. What’s going on? Why can’t he stop it?
It’s not until Castiel is sitting in the Impala with Sam and Eileen, Baby's windshield wipers fighting against the falling snow, that he realizes he’d left without their goodbye kisses.
will give up and crawl back inside Dean, let him fall asleep—but then show Dean its memories in his dreams. Memories of Dean’s body moving on its own. Walking around—dressed up fancy like a doll. People looking into his eyes, not realizing that it’s not Dean who’s staring back. Hands, hands reaching for him, caressing his shoulders, his back—
With hardly any traffic on the road, Dean slips into autopilot as he relaxes deeper into his seat, easing down on the accelerator just a little. He’d needed this.
With the spell still going strong, and the risk of bumping into Cas loitering around, it won’t be safe to head back downstairs for a while yet.
Dean chews at his lip. He wants to take Cas’ words at face value, but it’s hard to, especially after all the time he’s been convincing himself that Cas’ hand was forced somehow, or that they’d stripped him of his grace as some kind of punishment. The fact that Cas
“There’s a… thing,” Dean answers, stilted. Crowley raises a brow, restraining himself from snarking back in reflex at his usual verboseness, prompting him to continue. “It’s making people tell the truth.”
“You-” Kevin starts, yawning widely, “y’know that Froot Loops are probably gonna make them hyper, right?”
“How is it?” Dean asks. He’s hardly touched his own plate, expression shifty as he watches them eat. Sam’s suddenly a little nervous about the delayed payback thought he brushed off earlier.
“Crap, I forgot to charge my phone yesterday.” Kevin frowns, chagrined, putting his phone away and getting back to making dinner for himself and Cas.
Dean’s left standing by himself, a few feet away from Sam, who's staring at him like he’s busy reassessing reality.
Dean freezes up, in surprise he tells himself, because he’s still got hunter reflexes and Cas’ silent stalking around somehow manages to pass under the radar. Not because of anything else.
He doesn’t manage to get anything useful from the sheriff’s department, unsurprisingly. The sun’s already setting by the time he gets out and he’s resigned himself to going through the old papers at the library to find anything that rings any warning bells when he gets a text from Sam. Thankfully they’d had a little more luck on their end.
“I, that is-” He stutters. Cas looks away, shoulders slumping. Dean stops, staring down at his own hands gripping at the fabric of his jeans in a white-knuckled grip.
“Gotta say, I’m kinda surprised you still kept all that junk I gave you as a kid,” Dean says eventually, speaking more to the box in Cas’ hands than the guy himself. He realizes a little too late that it wasn’t quite the right thing to say.
Sam glares at him from beneath wet bangs for a second before giving a huff of laughter. He reaches over for the shower hose and sprays water at Dean who screeches and tries to hide behind a still giggling Cas.
They take a break for lunch before moving on to check out the doctor’s office exhibit. Once again, Sam gets roped into joining them, with Cas as the doctor and Dean as his nurse, treating Sam’s ‘injuries’.
It’s not exactly a habit per se, given that it’s only happened a few times since Cas’ unexpected return, but it’s got the makings of one.
“Let’s go,” he says, snagging his jacket from where he’d tossed it on the booth seat and heads for the door, not even bothering to pause and shrug it on.
“I swear Sammy, I’m not kidding. Something’s been off the last few days. You know I don’t say half the shit that goes through my head but it’s like I can’t help myself lately.”
The Empty materializes Death’s scythe while leveling Cas with a look. “Tell your pet human to stand down or I stop playing nice.”
apply to them because Cas keeps rambling on, lost in thought. “You bought me new clothes recently and regularly provide me with food, but I don’t trade you sexual favors for them.”
Dean grumbles a bit more before pushing himself up out of bed. He washes up quickly, reluctantly putting his sweater back on before he leaves the room to ward off the chill of the bunker. He makes his way to the kitchen; grabbing two mugs and filling them up from the carafe before trudging down the hall to the library.
Dean takes a deep breath in through his nose and doesn’t respond, turning back to the pans in front of him. Just because Crowley isn’t a demon-shaped threat anymore, doesn’t mean he isn’t annoying, first thing in the morning or otherwise.
He frowns when he doesn’t get a reply, squinting in their direction. Either they were arguing with each other much less loudly than Sam would expect on whether or not it was worth coming in for lunch, or they were planning on actually listening to him for once.
“Jeez, alright,” Dean says, caving under Cas’ pointed, expectant stare. He glances around quickly, making sure no one’s in earshot, before leaning in closer and lowering his voice. “So basically a sugar daddy’s a guy who buys chicks expensive stuff in exchange for sex.”
Dean gets really excited when they wake up one day and there isn’t any rain at all because it meant they could
“There’s got to be some way out of this,” Dean blurts out, even as Cas shakes his head. Dean wants to reach out and grab him by the lapels of his trenchcoat and shake him till he takes it back, but the pain and panic have him rooted to the spot. “I’m not going to lie down and just let it-”
"Cas, listen, I think I’ve got an idea where to look, but I need you to go find Kevin and stay with him, okay?"
“I was afraid,” he admits quietly, “of what she might try. Whether I’d be able to stop it if there was a next time. It wasn’t that I didn’t trust you.”
“W-what?” Oh, how the tables have turned. Dean can feel the tips of his ears burning, probably matching nicely with the hot blush on his cheeks. He can’t help the strained quality of his voice as he asks “You saw me? When?”
“Dean kicked me out of the room again,” Cas says, sulking and clearly not caring about what he’s just admitted to doing. Sam’s not sure whether to laugh or groan in frustration; he’s not sure either of those reactions would go over well with Cas, more likely he’d be annoyed at the former and uncaring of the latter.
He’s about to put it back when Sam, who must have watched it all happen, suddenly appears at his elbow. “Cas,” he stage-whispers, “Buy it for him. Trust me, you’ll be his hero.”
“I’ll be right back,” Cas had said, squeezing Dean’s hand and then walking after Sam out of the room.
The rooms are nice, much nicer than what they usually get for 70 dollars a night. Dean almost falls asleep in the shower, and then again when he makes the mistake of sitting down on the bed, but there's a nice little Mexican place right next door, and he's starving. He herds everyone in there, and while Jack ate the rest of the stew after he woke up in the car, the mother hen in Dean is only appeased when the kid gets a serving of nachos and starts wolfing them down in a manner eerily similar to Dean himself.
Dean licks his lips as he searches for the right words and pushes his nose against Cas’s chest. Cas’s warmth and his steady heartbeat are making Dean extra sleepy and that’s nice but it’s also making talking extra hard.
Whatever ‘talking’ means, Dean’s got to face it eventually. He’s still mostly a coward though, so he texts Cas
A part of Dean didn’t understand why that wasn’t good enough for him. He felt like he was watching himself from a distance, not getting why he was acting the way he was but also unable to stop himself.
They sit and watch the waves and the growing light in companionable silence. Dean must have felt a little cold—he’s wearing sweatpants and a hoodie that’s a little too big on him because it’s actually Castiel’s. It’s navy blue and very soft—one of the items that Dean insisted they get for cuddling time. Dean’s gotten into the habit of “stealing” it, though only after Castiel has worn it at least one time, something that he still doesn’t quite understand.
“Kid’s had a rough day yesterday,” he says, which is neither a yes nor a no to Cas’s question. And, oh fuck, is that his voice? He sounds like a wreck. He chugs more coffee and then grimaces—it’s barely lukewarm anymore.
None of them particularly care about Christmas, but Christmas is also a human thing, and Castiel doesn’t want Jack to spend it fighting monsters. Maybe it is selfish of him, but he had made a promise to Kelly to care for Jack, and he intends to honor it.
He hears Sam pad around the room but doesn't dare open his eyes. Even the little bit of light filtering through the thick curtains is too much.
“‘S a-a-all goin’ s-s-so well. Th-that’s usual-l-ly when stuff st-t-tarts goin’ w-w-wrong f-f-for us. A-a-and I can’t—I
Picking up the mitt, Dean points it at Sam sternly. “Don’t let that woman go, Sammy. She’s good for you, I like her.”
Sam’s standing next to Dean, a plate piled with ribs in his hands, the two of them ribbing each other as usual.
“Stupid honeymooners,” Dean grumbles and then decides to soothe himself with his ice cream. Stupid little brother. Stupid sister-in-law. And stupid husband-who-should-always-be-on-Dean’s-side who started it all.
After, Dean ushers him right back to bed. Completely ignoring Castiel's protests, he turns on the TV, gives him the remote, and then busies himself with laundry.
He falls quiet. Even without looking in the rearview mirror, Castiel can tell that Mary’s looking at him, that she’s been listening intently.
Eileen chimes in with, “Maybe try a bath. We bought Epsom bath salt. You can say you stole it from us, he’ll like that.”
The son of a bitch has risen to stand on its hind legs. Its unnaturally thin body sways back and forth like a dead tree branch, towering over them, staring them down. It oozes
, too. With the relief and the joy of finally realizing that he was home had come the memories and the flashbacks. The migraines that came along with them left him in agony, and more than once Cas had to knock him out, Dean incapable of doing anything but puking and shaking so hard Sam was worried about seizures.
“I d-dunno... guess he n-needs m-more—more t-time, or w-w-w-whatever.” He gestures vaguely and Cas frowns.
He’s off to dreamland shortly after and everything is nice until he wakes with a gasp and a racing heart from a nightmare slash flashback of that moment when Michael dragged him under, taking over control until all Dean knew was the black water he was drowning in. Only half-awake, he reaches out for Cas, and when his hand meets only empty air, he clutches the pillow in front of him until he’s calmed enough to sleep again.
He freezes halfway up the steps when he catches sight of Cas at one of the tables, cheek propped up on an open palm, head tilted down to read a thick, old tome with yellowing pages propped open in front of him.
“Angels have no need of possessions of any kind,” Cas tells him. “But humans define themselves by what they call theirs. This body-” Cas cuts himself off for a moment, jaw clenching tightly. “Jimmy deserved better than this. He was a good man, his body was never meant to be mine to keep, but he’s gone and I’m… all alone in here.”
to have drinks with the guy? Come on,” Dean cajoles, “I owe you a round or two for all the work you did with the tablets.”
“I’m not mad at you, for any of the things that’ve happened,” Sam says, feeling like he needs to. “I- I think I understand, maybe even better than Dean, why you did the things you had to.” He hesitates, but the next part’s as important to acknowledge as the rest. “You kept trying to make up for it too, didn’t you?”
Sam reads between the lines easily enough. Nightmares aren’t new to him, but they would be to Cas. He hadn’t thought too much on it when he found Cas already busy at work in the storeroom before he got there; now though, Sam sees it as the attempt for a distraction that it is. Not that it seems to be helping.
Charlie shrugs. “No clue. I think he headed back to his room after he hung up the tinsel everywhere.”
Sam picks up the frame, turning it around as he moves to put it back on the side-table. The now-dead witch smiles sunnily back up at him from the photo.
“Yeah Sammy, just paying for my coffee.” The familiar name clicks in Castiel’s mind before he can figure out how to grab the coffee back. He's relieved enough that he almost slumps onto the counter. “You want anything? Gabe makes some of the best pies, you've gotta try some.”
Sam shakes his head with a rueful smile, glancing down at the open tome in front of him and then at his laptop. “I’ve still got a lot to do for us to start making some headway in reorganizing this room. Just bring me back a turkey sandwich or a salad.”
“Tell me what?” Dean demands loudly, glancing between the Empty and Cas. Cas doesn’t look at him. “Tell me what, Cas?”
Mulling over what he’s been told so far, he glances at Dean in consideration, only needing a moment to confirm a suspicion, but keeps his gaze trained on him until Dean scowls in discomfort.
Dean clears his throat, staring intently down at his plate even as he can feel both Sam and Cas’ gaze on him.
“Cas?” He’s already of half a mind not to say anything, but then Cas turns to him, head tilted expectantly. The question is out there before he can stop himself. “How much do you remember?”
Cas waits for his hand to fall away before pulling Dean back into another kiss, longer and more lingering than the last one. Eventually they have to pull back to breathe but they don’t move far away, just enough to look each other in the eyes. Cas smiles.
At Dean’s continued narrow-eyed look, Crowley relents, sighing a little theatrically. “Casting spells doesn’t always require that something be ‘original’, spell ingredients themselves notwithstanding. In fact, there’ve been many a knockoff made and bespelled to mimic the effects of the object that inspired it.”
Shopping with Cas isn’t like shopping with Sam. Dean heaves a family pack of Chocolate Fudge ice cream in their cart, and instead of berating him, all Cas does is scratch ice cream off the list.
Because Dean has transformed into a thirteen-year-old girl overnight, he lifts his hand and gives Cas an embarrassing little wave. Geez, what is he going to do next, pretend to have accidentally dropped a tissue? He beelines it to the coffee machine.
“Of course, Bear.” Then he frowns as he seems to remember something. “I think Jack is on to us. When it was determined that we would not be going to SeaWorld because the animals are being exploited there, he said he was really happy that he at least saw that
“The prices were surprisingly reasonable. Besides, I could persuade Sam that we would have to put up with your whining the entire time otherwise.”
“Sure,” Dean says and signs. She comes to stand at his side at the counter and together they go to town on the potatoes, peeling and chopping. Dean’s feeling like it’s a creamy potato soup kind of night. Maybe with leek in it and some buttered bread to go with it.
Dean wanted to, he did, but he couldn’t. From far away, he watched himself yell and fight and kick out his legs until finally, Cas reached for him—”I’m sorry, Dean”—and then it all went black.
“No. Just a few stray cats and people sleeping on the streets that I didn’t want to disturb or scare.” Cas's tone suggests what he thinks of anyone having to sleep outside and in fear for their safety with so many perfectly functioning houses standing empty, but Dean’s not awake enough to discuss humanity’s failings right now.
Dean does but either this one was ruined in the wash or Cas bought it without Dean's approval. "Don't like the texture." He drops the offending thing down on the bed and rubs his palms over his thighs. "Feels like what nails on a chalkboard sound like. I want the navy one."
Maybe now that they’re back home and there’s no rush, Cas will hear him. Maybe Dean can be really, really brave and pause the episode halfway through and tell Cas the rest of what he’d wanted to say.
Sam unplugs the drain and washes the soap off his hands, then looks at Castiel with soft eyes, leaning against the sink. "It's better than you hoped for?"
For the next half an hour, he just sits and watches the waves. It’s so soothing that he startles when his phone vibrates in his pocket with an incoming call. It’s Cas, and Dean quickly swipes to accept the call.
For a while, Castiel sits and sulks. He has to admit, though, that it does help to lie down, as he still feels quite weary. The uncomfortable twinges that had plagued him yesterday have lessened, but he knows better than to try and use his grace yet.
One kiss turns into the next, and the next, Dean slowly melting into relaxation beneath him. There’s nothing but the sounds of their breaths and their mouths and the shifting of fabric on skin as they adjust their position slightly. The calming scent of chamomile from the cream wafts up as Dean rests his still upheld hands on Castiel’s arms.
Dean half expects Cas to remind him that he’s had sex all but once and his only request is not to get stabbed after, but Cas actually pauses at that.
This is exactly why he tries to keep such a tight lid on his bullshit at all times. Once he opens up, it just keeps spilling, and he can't make it stop.
“We ate lunch together though,” Jack pipes up, looking confused at the sudden tension. “Me and Dean. He ate just as much as me.”
Cas sounds composed, but his eyes are shining with emotion. Dean’s fingers clench in his shirt, and it takes him a moment until he can speak. Even then, his voice is shaky. “Thanks.” Dean curls himself tighter around him, closes his eyes against the heat that’s building behind them. “That, um. Th-that means a l-l-l-lot.”
Dean chews his lower lip and nods. “Yeah.” He doesn’t deserve Cas trying to take care of him. Picking up his fork, he starts stabbing at his eggs again. They’re probably cold as well. He inclines his head at the research chaos around them, “You find anything?”
anything hits a little close to some really unpleasant memories. It’s been long enough that the reminder doesn’t evoke crippling fear, but his heart picks up speed and his grip on his knife tightens.
Dean leaves Sam's food on the stove for him to graze on when he comes back. He prepares some more coffee, and this time even remembers he's not a Neanderthal and pours Cas a cup as well. Then he takes his plate of eggs and sits his butt down on the chair across from Cas, shoving some dusty books out of the way.
Gesturing at Castiel to shimmy down the bed, Dean climbs between his legs and makes himself at home with his head on Castiel’s chest. He pushes his sleep mask back down and rubs his cheek against Castiel’s shirt.
“The counterspell that Sam cast worked,” Castiel counters, trying to hold back his own irritation. He’s weary and sore and just wants to go home. “And we found the object, solved the case. My grace just needs to recover. It’s fine, Dean.”
"Yeah, b-but you said-d-d you'd wait." Dean is pouting now, his tone changing from angry to hurt. "A-a-and then you just l-l-left me th-there."
Dean needs a moment to let that sink in and Cas must understand because he falls silent and rubs a thumb over the back of Dean’s hand.
They'd already brought most of the dishes down earlier to free up the tables, so now it's mostly bottles that need to be brought in for recycling. Castiel had hoped that Dean was allowing himself the rest he was clearly in need of, but instead he finds him at the kitchen sink, scrubbing away.
Alone together in the Cave, Cas cupped Dean’s face in one hand, one thumb stroking the skin under Dean’s eye. Even that soft touch was almost too much already, sending Dean’s heart racing and his skin prickling. Dean didn’t know what to do with his own hands and felt like the clumsiest person alive. Like he was going to fall apart any moment because he’d been wanting this so long.
"He probably would, but I think, silently, he'd agree. He just doesn't like it when people know he's a… softie," Castiel says, trying out the term and making Jack laugh.
"It's fine," Dean grumbles, embarrassed and annoyed by it. He throws the blanket to the side and kicks his pants the rest of the way off, then stalks over to his dresser.
“When you blow them out,” Eileen says as Jack sits down, “close your eyes and make a wish. Sometimes, they come true.” She winks at him.
This has happened a lot lately—usually during cuddling time but also at bed time or when Dean wakes up during the night and can’t settle back into sleep. He says he likes hearing about things Castiel has witnessed, and Castiel is happy to share his memories with him—the ones that weren’t taken from him, that is. He has told Dean about ancient warriors and beasts and battles long-forgotten. About the first sword that was forged, the first stars that were named.
. Blindly, he fumbles out a hand and tries to grab whatever is smelling so nice, and then frowns when he’s only met with empty air.
Startled, Castiel flinches strongly enough that it makes Dean, who had been dozing with his head on Castiel’s shoulder, grumble and try to move even closer.
Cas nods sagely. “Hamsters are hard-wired to forage for food and hoard it. And also to nest-build. However, if given the wrong materials for that they can injure themselves severely. Dean got his foot caught in his blanket nest this morning and almost fell flat on his face.”
Dean hadn’t wanted them to make a big deal out of his birthday, uncomfortable with being the center of attention. Mary had been the only additional guest, and though Dean pretended to be grumpy about it all, he had eagerly put on the silly party hat and blown out the candles on his birthday cake.
Cas looks rumpled and exhausted. He closes the door behind himself and sits beside Dean at the edge of the bed.
“And then… when I kiss you.” Cas closes his eyes, grip on Dean’s hands tightening. “The way it feels, it’s overwhelming. Addictive. It’s nothing I’ve ever felt before and I can’t get enough and sometimes. Sometimes that scares me.” He pauses. “I want you, Dean, I’m just… bad at it.”
“I texted her from your phone on the way back to the motel. She was very relieved. And sad, of course, since now, we know for sure that the people who were taken will not be coming back.”
Putting an arm around Dean, Castiel rubs gentle circles between his shoulder blades with his thumb. Dean makes a pleased noise and then asks, “Tell me a story?”
Dean would wonder where he went wrong raising him, except he knows exactly what went wrong in terms of food when they were kids.
They share a moment of silence, and then Cas sighs. “You got a message from our contact, Molly; she’s asking you and Jack to meet her at a diner near the beach in an hour.” He tightens his hold on Dean’s hands. “I know you don’t need me there, I know we said we would split up to cover more ground, but I still don’t wish for us to be apart today.”
"It's not my fault this place is abominable," Castiel counters haughtily while he starts to put their items on the conveyor belt.
Settling back down and shifting his legs so his thighs won’t cramp, Dean rolls his hips experimentally and Cas sucks a sharp breath in through his nose, clutching at him.
long, making Dean salivate just from looking. One day, he’s going to sit on that thing and ride it until they both forget their names. Maybe while wearing his Stetson, just so he can annoy Cas by making a million cowboy jokes before, during, and after.
“I better get back. We’re about to rewatch Tombstone, but Dean expressed a craving for mini marshmallows.”
“I mean, they’re probably gonna dry up soon,” Dean is blabbering, likely made even more uncertain by Castiel’s stunned silence,  “so it was dumb, really—”
Swallowing thickly, Dean tries to clear his suddenly blocked throat. Cas withdraws his hand, and Dean’s heart lurches painfully. His skin still tingles where Cas was touching him.
Cas sounds like he really wants to know, and Dean does really want to tell him. But the truth is too terrible. Too damning. He can’t say it.
idea,” Sam’s voice begins to shake and Dean feels his own throat close up when he sees the way Sam’s eyes shine wetly, “what it was like to find you like this? To pull your
Birdsong rises with the rays of the sun. A gentle breeze goes through the tall grasses, and Castiel shifts closer to Dean, keeping him warm. It's only now that he realizes that whatever was rattled and uncertain inside him has settled and is reassured.
Faced with their uncooperation, Dean had caved. He’d dealt with staying in the infirmary over night, with being checked on frequently, with slipping back into sleep constantly.
Dean slows to a stop. He wants to check on Sam, but he can't fucking be around Cas right now when Sam is also there. Not while he feels this stupidly fragile. He needs to get himself together first, get some control back.
Shifting around, Dean glares up at him, but the effect is completely ruined by the pink flush to his cheeks and ears.
A jaw instantly goes for his throat, but he blocks it with his left, teeth ripping into his forearm with needle-sharp pain, and then he’s sinking his knife into its heart and the hide-behind crumbles at his feet.
But Dean’s too tired to argue, so he just gives Cas his take-out box for safe keeping, and then guides Baby back onto the road.
Cas's lips are a bit chapped, but his mouth is soft and warm. Dean sighs against his cheek, his eyes closing the rest of the way. Cas might not be the most experienced kisser, but he appears determined to learn as fast as possible. Dean is happy to let him ‘practice’, and even more happy with the fact that Cas has started to take control of their kisses more and more as he gains in confidence.
Down the hill, he can hear the noises of Sam and Jack and Eileen engaged in a snow fight, and further away the fireworks in the city. All of it fades into the background until there's just the soft crackling of the fire, and Dean's heart beating against his, and the stars above them, silent but bright.
Dean thinks he’s watching the movie, but he must get lost in his head instead, or maybe in focusing too much on trying to enjoy Cas’s nearness. There’s a tentative touch to his arm, really just a grazing of fingertips, but he flinches anyway.
