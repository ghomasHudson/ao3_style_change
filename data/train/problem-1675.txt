And then, mercifully, it lets go, in what seems like a careless whim.
“Oh, and when you do it, it’s not?” John replies with sassy rhetoricalness complimented by a lazy hand gesture indicating a certain failure in the sleuth’s logic.
He watches the detective's shadow play by the door as the he paces, attempting to subdue his stormy thoughts, which John knows he will only let fester and torment himself with. After a long stretch, he somehow, reluctantly, tears his eyes away.
“Hold on a second. Are you saying, now, after
Before he has the opportunity to take a breath, it pulls him back down. He hears his mind squirm with a whimper he can’t make. He knows the surface is whirl-pooling above, reaches for it with his hand, but the monster arrests his other hand, immobilizing him. John would shriek out of physical and emotional agony at the tastable closeness of respite, if only he had anything left in his lungs and his throat wasn’t powerlessly mute. He gnashes his teeth vexedly as a pinpoint touch runs along his crackling, failing nerves, trailing across his collarbone. Then partly to the dismay of his fading consciousness, the tension throughout his frame softens from the taming influence of the touch. He feels it run up his jugular and withers against the delicate yet pleasurable sensation of it, surrendering in spite the failing pressure in his head. It holds him down for what seems like a specific duration, then lets go.
Sherlock looks the deceased over for any indication of poisoning or foul play. When his scouring search turns up none so much as a pin prick, he leans back on his heels in resignation. He stands up over the eighth body they've encountered in not even so many as days on the case, looking conflicted. John himself is conflicted too, and when the tox screen reveals he had died of myocardial infarction his feelings are confirmed that this was something he could have prevented.
“Well, I don’t know, Sherlock,” John shrugs, so very wry, “That’s the point.”
John hears Mary’s voice resonate from the hallway on his right and looks up to the source of the sound.
Mary: Maybe throw in a breakfast diary while you're at it?
Sherlock hums.
So I just read the last chapter of this and... no. Turn around. You don't need this ok, you don't. You want a happy fic with lots of fluff right now. You do. Don't shake your head at me just do it.
He looks around him and spots a little CCTV camera with a big round lens, perched above him on an electrical cable. He’s not exactly surprised.
“Yes, I know, that isn't news to me. I
Sherlock sees the conviction in his eyes and somberly feels as though he has to comply.
"Then what would you have me do? What
be good enough?" John demands helplessly, starting to grow aghast with his absurdly excessive demands.
"What, now?" John asks, seeing that it's well past midnight and there's a small hurricane happening outside, slapping trees against window panes and the like, your usual saturnine weather.
He watches the quiet ebb and flow of the tide, suspiciously scanning the rocks of the continental shelf, and looks for any unnatural disturbances in the water. Despite ripples of underwater kelp forests and the occasional collision where water meets stone, little else penetrates the surface. After a few minutes of nothing particularly remarkable happening, he stands, turns, and heads into the brush.
“Yes, and somehow I don’t find this half as amusing as you do.”
"You have to watch your tongue, darling," John says, chopping up vegetables and tossing them into a pressure cooker, "You're only five years old. You're not even supposed to have a full vocabulary yet."
the room, shielding his eyes with a hand.
Much to John's alarm, Sherlock touches the sample to his tongue. They haven't yet ID'ed the body and have no idea of the victim's medical history- he sees the endless list of life-threatening pathogens Sherlock's just exposed himself to fly before his eyes.
"What is it you want from me?" Sherlock demands, exasperated. He puts a hand on his waist, which means that he's intent on being obstinate or/and vexing at the present moment. "That's the more pertinent question. Lately you only seem concerned with my whereabouts when there's someone else trying to get a leg over on me."
he thinks as he closes the collar over his neck, which he's left open at the top two buttons, per usual. His improper nature rebels against the rules and restrictions of a full suit. He puts the medal around his neck, then does the silk bowtie over it.
” he murmurs as he comes to, his voice cracking with sleep.
? Is this a joke?“
John is about to press the issue to clear up any outstanding suspicions when Sherlock asks, "Are you just going to stand there?"
He returns John's expression of relief with a burdened, heated glare that takes John completely by surprise, something hateful, insufferable, like jealousy written all over it. "I would think you've mortified me enough haven't you?" he demands with an alarming amount of vehemence, as if he's the object of some cruel joke- although John feels a bit off-set by that and can't help but feel like he's the one who should feel embarrassed-- after what he just said? Sherlock turns his back, obscuring his face so that John can't see whatever weakness it may betray.
"Oh dear, what's happened?" Irene asks, taking off her sunglasses. Somehow John had been rather hoping they'd seen the last of her. For some reason, he finds he's developed an even greater dislike of the woman than before and feels vaguely threatened by her presence, although he can't really explain why.
“Are you so convinced of that? It’s disheartening Mary, how you think I do not bleed.”
"Excuse me?"
"You infernal maddening-" he breathes. He's always doing this, constantly slipping out of his hands- so wantable but unhavable, like he's been designed specifically to drive John nuts. Sometimes he truly wants to bite his head off. She has her hooks in him and he refuses to see it, too enamored with his desire to solve the case. He can't see she's using him.
“I’m not coming back in—“ he insists tiredly.
“It’s a bit..” John’s voice echoes in his head, sounding oddly surreal and foreign.
Don't ask me."
"Say, John, you don't actually like this guy, do you?" Anderson asks John suspiciously, arms crossed. John rolls his eyes, aghast. Not this again. "I'm not a homophobe, really. It's just- him? Really?"
“Problem?” Mary blinks innocently.
"Cantharidin venom," she supplies, "It only works on men."
"Obviously," he says, making John's jaw go slack. "Or does that bother you? Do I need your permission, captain?" he asks mockingly, walking away. "Oh, do close your mouth," he grouses, annoyed at the unadulterated look of shock on John's face, "I do things that offend your delicate moral sensitivities. I will never fit into the proper, normal box in your head. Get over it."
“Where were we?” Sherlock asks the still-incapacitated blond he’s still bent over.
“If you’ll excuse us?” he inquires with a beautiful smile indistinguishable from a genuine one, placing a hand on Mary’s shoulder and disappearing into the archway entrance along side her.
"Christ, would you stop being so infernally-" John starts, meaning to put a hand on his shoulder, but Sherlock swerves around the chair he's all but snapped in half and leaves before he can.
Sherlock frowns under his unrelenting stare, possibly reading his thoughts. John wants to tell him something but he hasn't any idea what he means to say. Don't go on a date with her? How about we do a mold experiment instead or stare at ashes under a microscope? And while you're at it, how about you swear off women entirely and go back to your asexual ways where you whittle away the hours plucking strings on your violin or destroying power lines with hydrochloric acid?
of being herded against him,
“You don’t need to be nervous,” Sherlock states intrepidly, taking the first step, “I approximate there are nine and twenty ways you could mess this up, only seventeen of which would be completely detrimental and irrevocable.”
“Why not?” John wants to know, leaning on one locked elbow with a fawning expression on his side-cast face.
“Stop it. Stop it. Please,” he hisses angrily, biting the water. With a flail of desperate, trapped-animal power he kicks free from the monsters grip, and touches his hands to the slope of rock. He inserts his digits into the crevices of its sheer slope, and pulls himself up.
The infantrymen holding him seem to think that makes good sense and nod to each other. Terror runs ragged in the soldier's breath, wishful words of objection catching in his throat. They throw him forward like a human sacrifice and he falls to his knees in front of him, unable to move, like a rabbit caught in a wolf's crosshairs.
“Was I? God that was a long time ago,” Sherlock mutters dismissively.
” his voice quavers despite sounding stern, having risen a decibel.
“Or the sofa, if you must,” Sherlock says, as John finds himself being hauled toward the living room, “Go to sleep. I can make breakfast.”
“You’re serious.”
John stares at the back of the head rest like he's contemplating ways to assassinate it before he gets up and joins Sherlock on the pavement, the wind picking up and rustling restlessly between them.
John might just pull his own face off. "It was a
John obeys and Sherlock walks away from him in a temper, then stops still. John looks at him, confused because there seems to be something coming out of his back, seeping onto his shirt.
“You have this pathological desire to win, even if it kills you,” she says. The comment disorients him. There's something admittedly unnerving, even foreboding, about the almost-literal phasing of it. He doesn't quite understand what he'd done to betray that information, or how she'd gleaned that from a simple chess game.
There was no need for things to get out of hand.
"She's delusional isn't she?"
After a moments thought, the chimera bristles, overcome by aversion for the species, and resolves to simply leave the man there in his coughing fit. He gives the sand a push and swerves, fins slithering in an arc behind him as he crawls back through the shallow water. He wades in several feet and sinks in, tail flashing reflectively.
Plain…
John is gripped by how precariously too-good-to-be-true it seems, the impossible sound of laughter, the unreal touch of Sherlock's head against his, and feels like he ought to be waiting for the other shoe to drop. The way the light dances playfully in Sherlock's eyes undoes John at the seams, pinpointing every known weakness he has, every razor-thin fissure in his armor. It's one of those rare moments when he feels like he actually
(See the end of the chapter for
John is trying to stomach the sight of Mary dancing away with someone else and ignoring everything Sherlock is saying, until he gets to that last line, which succeeds in destroying John’s train of thought completely.
“Boyfriend?” Sherlock hazards uncertainly, hands merged together and face turning partway in John’s general direction. John closes his eyes as he responds with unerring control.
It’s surprising, the level of incomprehension, this from the species that named itself for being the smartest. Finally it looks around, but it appears its vision is equally poor. It does not detect an ulterior presence, and the creature does not reveal himself to it, so eventually it gives up trying out reconstruct what happened, reverting to its machinations along the beach.
right in front of me—“
John sighs in defeat and heads to the door. Mary and Sherlock follow, but then he turns around, hand on the knob.
“Sherlock what are you
“Darling, he’s not—“ he begins, then starts laughing uncontrollably, burying his head in his hand, “oh please stop.”
He swallows when it makes the first move toward him, one hand stroking through the sand, the other crossing over gracefully in front, with the slinky, rolling shoulders of a jaguar pawing through desert. And then there's an cursory, even polite pause, as if to say "aren't you going to run?"
After all, it’s only appropriate to ask a question if you want to know the answer.
He sits there, its fangs hovering above his neck, and counts the milliseconds, trying not to move or make a fatal error. He exhales slowly, trying to stop himself from acting out in an irrational way. He begins to wish it had just gotten it over with and instead of playing with him in this sort of cruel waiting game.
” Greg drawls unenthusiastically, suggesting he is preoccupied with his day time job, which largely consists of failing to catch criminals and paperwork.
"I'd never hurt you," John insists like he's trying to convince himself more than anyone else, but saying that only makes the hypocrisy of his words all the more glaring. Sherlock doesn't have to point out that he's hurting him plenty, even as he demands to be let go.
“No wonder you’re—!“ Nigel says excitedly.
"Sorry, sir, couldn't stop him," Donovan apologizes in the entryway. Lestrade looks at her with a beleaguered, why-me face. "Should I have used force?" she asks, uncertain.
John tilts his head at his wonky behavior. It's obviously not proper to be amused by this, and much less to let the amusement show on his face. Sherlock had PTSD, which he knew as a doctor and someone who suffered from it himself, was no laughing matter.
SHERLOCK: WELL THERE'S NO HARM IN FLATTERY IS THERE? EVEN IF IT SERVES MY PURPOSES.
So this was the closest thing I could find to what John is wearing. But Sherlock is still wearing this.
Comment below
that refuses to let her have him.
“Sherlock..?” John asks uncertainly, retracting his hand.
"Honestly John you pick the most opportune moments. I nearly had her," Sherlock says, meaning to go after her. John's hand tightens on his wrist, barring him from moving, much to Sherlock's exasperation.
"Yes..." he says, having thought that much was obvious.
“The footage is
“How do you propose we do that?” Sherlock replies, slumping into his leather armchair and aligning his fingers in a prayer-like manner.
John deflates, giving the wallpaper a sour, tongue-chewing look, “Have I now, detective?”
Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes. He doesn’t have time for this.
." John takes that to mean Sherlock has no idea what his rights are, if he thinks playing the violin is one of them. "My greatest mistake was letting that man become unelected Fuhrer of this country."
- apparently amused by his little outburst. John swallows, her laugh snuffing out his anger, and replacing it with equal parts horror and confusion.
John shivers at the response, feeling sick. He feels light headed and leans a hand on the rock. “No,” he croaks.
“I'm not-“ Sherlock snaps around, ready to inflict some select words on whoever dare suggest he’d act upon trust issues or insecurities or jealous compulsions more befitting a snubbed ex-girlfriend.
He has to stop him for a second, placing a hand over his. "What is that?" he asks. More like,
"Do it then, instead of talking about it. If you think I am so outmatched, so in over my head, so deranged and a danger to myself to extent that my sanity is in question, as you put it," he says, looking over his shoulder at John with hooded eyelids in an undeniably manipulative way that tugs at his heartstrings, making John suspect Sherlock is very much aware of what he's doing to him, and that that perfectly-calibrated look was intentionally designed to guilt-trip him to death, "then straight-jacket me, Doctor, if I am in such desperate need of correction." John curses, looking at Sherlock like he's the arrow in his achilles heel, "But if you can't, don't think, even for a second, that I am going to simply
“ He seems tense.
Mary: I see.
. He has to ask her now. He needs nothing short of a legal, signed and dated confession to get anyone to believe him. "Does it always start like this?"
“I couldn’t help but notice, dad, that you are in love with your—our— ‘flatmate’?” Air quotes.
way, at
"You're going to get yourself killed," he says, at the end of his rope, "I'd sooner kill her myself than see you go through with this."
“It’s no use, you know. He won’t eat it,” John sighs, picking up his box of indispensible jumpers. He’s half convinced Sherlock has taken up a hunger strike just to get him to come back home. Rummaging through the box's contents, he sees that the Christmas jumper with the red collar is missing. He glares accusatively at Sherlock, splayed out on his armchair.
His thoughts slow to a grinding halt and his vision goes red.
"I don't
"You don't need a translation for that?" Sherlock smirks, poking fun at him for not being fluent in all languages on the planet.
“John stop it!” John turns and sees Molly in the hallway, teary-eyed. There's a basket case for you. How anyone could still love a man after witnessing first hand his severely flawed personality is a mystery in itself.
The silence is grating- even so the television repels him. He turns it on anyway. He tries some crap soap channel as a distraction but it fails to keep his thoughts from roaming, until it breaches the ever-pervasive topic of how person A cheated on person B with person C, at which point he clicks it off. The worn floorboards creak as he pads around, reaching for a medical journal that affords him little distraction. He ends up glowering at the blank television screen, rubbing his temple.
to ABC. This is a ratings-driven, for-profit project now, partly kickstarter-funded. This is our director, Mike. And this is Stephanie our producer, a self-proclaimed shipper fan –“
“He’s not going,” she says blandly, head leaning on his shoulder, the weight of her back against his forearm.
, Sherlock," he whispers in frustration, "You're making me do this."
Sherlock is completely silent now, while Mary’s soothing voice tries to guide John back to a more healthy train of thought. The brunet looks away, hiding the flush on his cheeks. John’s fingertips press and knead into the lean muscle on his inner thigh, smoothing up the sleek textile of his slacks. Sherlock can’t refuse him, John knows he doesn’t have the power to. He can’t scream either, has to keep all the feelings encased in a mask of composure. Table manners.
They proceed to go through the entire rack of bodies, but the corpse is no where to be found. She tells him it’ll turn up in a weak attempt to raise his spirits, but he knows better. He’s forced to reconcile with the sad reality of the fact all it takes to make a body disappear is a coroner who’s not a coroner and a good mop.
The man's breath hitches. Gingerly, he removes his hand, his fingertips shaking like an addict suffering withdrawal. Then he quickly makes himself scarce and disappears from view, vanishing into the depths of the cavernous alleyway. The soldier clutches his neck, catching his breath, and can't shake the feeling he just brushed shoulders with death.
“Why? It’s not like you have a sign on your head that says
,” John clarifies, checking to see he’s hearing the detective correctly, “that you are not, after all, her father?”
“Married!” she blurts at him finally.
"We can go to the women's if you prefer," she offers.
There's a stillness in the air as the dust settles. When Sherlock meets his eyes, he's giving him a dark look that makes John shiver. He's literally standing between Sherlock and a case, and this is not going to end well.
"Yes, now. There's been another," he says with his usual curtness, dialing Lestrade to tell them they're en route.
“There’s nothing in the database at that time but the coroner on call filled out an investigation form around then,” she says, tapping the latest entry on the clipboard spreadsheet. “We might of put it in storage. It should be here—” she says going to the freezer. She looks up the chamber her colleague wrote down and slides it open. Not surprisingly it’s empty.
“Do you think I’m dreaming right now?”
. You blend in quite nicely doctor,” her fingers link around his wrist. She leans forward and John smiles gently at her without reciprocating, playing the waiting game he learned in secondary school that drives girls crazy. She smirks, so she wants to play too. “On the outside you can almost pass as a normal person,” she says leaning forward more. John hms, his once-playful eyes now withdrawn.
"That doesn't mean she hasn't committed the crime, just that she hasn't been caught, which is a result of your forensics personnel being idiots. Clearly she's been exploiting the fact."
Of course Sherlock would say something blunt and brutal and below the belt, no matter if it turns John upside-down and inside out. Sherlock probably doesn’t even understand that, just that he can use it to his advantage: weaseling his way into his heart, twisting him around his little finger, getting away scot-free, and that’s all that matters. He wins. John is painfully aware there’s nothing he can say to that.
She laughs at that.
Needless to say, the news falls ungracefully on Mary’s unsuspecting ears. She looks as though the world around her has been shattered like so many fragments of a not-so-fortunate mirror getting ploughed over by a stampede of monster trucks. Her eyes dart to John, who’s minding his tea, in a demand of how he intends to answer for this. He sees the look on her face, and his expression goes from one of sheer innocence, to one that is slightly miffed and glaring narrowly at Sherlock.
"Sherlock, get back," John growls, aiming his Sig at Moriarty's croonies.
"Then why are you fighting me on this?" John strains to understand, following him to the window and turning Sherlock by the arm to face him. In his frustration he finds himself unable to keep the tone of the conversation from becoming heated, the volume of his voice rising uncontrollably.
(See the end of the chapter for
John doesn't know what to do. He tries to step off, lifting one foot over, but he's paralyzed. It's an illusion and still he can't do it. Why hadn't he thought of this so casually when Sherlock was jumping? It's fucking brilliant. To break the fourth wall, he has to go through Sherlock first, the one thing he can't, his Achilles heel. Why is his mind so torturous?
“This is what you did with Janine, ” John decides to say, his voice controlled, cold, and hard.
“So I gathered.”
her."
," he says, taking the icy cup away and going to the kitchen to make two fresh new ones.
Sherlock: It’s uh in my mind palace so its technically not real. Second floor.
Anyway, so tragic how Sherlock got demoted. You know, I'm going to stop talking now because Sherlock is giving me a scary look. If you want the next chap pay me in kudos. bye
“Oh come on,” he sighs with his elbow braced against the leather, gazing down at John listlessly. “You can’t tell me I didn’t do it right.”
"why do we live together in a flat? Why do we eat dinner together? And lunch? And breakfast? Why does he help me with my homework and tie my laces and brush my hair? Why do I sleep in his bed when I have nightmares if he’s
“You broke his collarbone!” John explodes in outrage, standing from his chair.
“Sherlock I think you are brilliant, wonderful and perfect all the same, but you are literally impossible sometimes.”
“Then who did?" he says, "No one else I know has a penchant for signing their name into the back of people's necks after snapping them.”
“I thought you just said she was still on sex holiday!” Sherlock hollers from the kitchen. John visibly cringes, hair standing up on end. But it occurs to him that Mary is supposed to be on said holiday.
"Then whose am I? Yours?" Sherlock interrupts in what sounds like an accusation, because that is what John seems to be suggesting, with this stunt of his.
"I dread to think what would happen if he discovered my little pet crush on him, Mary. So much so that I hardly know what to do with myself. Help me, Mary.”

Sherlock deflates at the unfavorable verdict. “It tastes normal doesn’t it? You thought it was John’s. You know what he was going to give you?
He had been, needless to say, confused and disoriented in the time the police took to arrive on scene. His statement has some credibility issues. Not only is it possible what he saw didn’t happen, it’s more believable.
and it terrifies him.
know who it is?
Only three minutes in, she’s down seven pieces and Sherlock has concluded he can finish the game within the next ten moves. Another minute and he’s planned out several, redundant routes to capture her king, drawing from a series of dusty, antediluvian strategies she’ll never have even heard of. Eight minutes in and he's locked down inevitable success- there is no possible move she can make to win and the game is over. Now it’s just a matter of letting it play out.
John is becoming intimately familiar with the meaning of the term
“Come on, sport,” he says, traversing the monotone, light-bleached room to close the drafty window facing the street, “If we’re late, they’ll assume you opted out and bail.”
The kitchenette is bathed in mournful, austere grayscale, poorly lit with weak hints of light glancing off the overcast sky, fading in through the pale-beamed aperture of the window. The dilution of light gives the illusion of timelessness, casting a dark slumber over the various culinary and experimental artifacts that occasion the counter- boxes of unrefrigerated tissue samples, dispersed groceries, an unsheathed kitchen knife…
Eventually she stands back up to take her leave. "In any case, I didn't mean to interrupt."
Sherlock’s eyes slide over to his smoothly. “It was on top of a train. A moving train,” he smirks, “It was practically James Bond.”
"That is not what I'm saying!" John says, aggravated, twisting him around. "Sherlock, you know I don't think that. You are the most brilliant, mad, admirable man-"
“Stop it!” it shouts, and John feels his back slam backward into the stone.
"I've never needed his help to put criminals away and I don't need it now," he hisses under his breath. He scales back up the steps to their flat, willfully being elusive. John bites his tongue, wishing he could manage to explain how it isn’t about that, how it has nothing to do with his mettle as a detective or his capacity to solve crime. Not liable to let him escape so easily, he follows after him, up the steps back into the living room.
“You have a problem with authority, much like the criminal underclass,” he snips, recovering his usual calm and detachment.
Is this the part where the wakes up? Please just let it be the part where he never wakes up again.
He feels extremely wary of it all. It's a dangerous thing to go chasing after hopes that can't be sustained.
“A thing?” Sherlock cocks his head in feigned ignorance. He is fully aware she had a lunch date, with Scottish physician scientist who has an unusual penchant for ice lollies but the benefit of being himself and not the unfortunate, stood-up fellow in the cafeteria is that he gets priority.
John is starting to consider the possibility that his flatmate is actually a masochist. It would explain a lot of things. "Are you sure this is about the case files, or merely that you hate your brother?" he levels with him.
It's John's turn to be silent and without words, feeling his jaw go slack. He's nothing short of amazed at how Sherlock's sheer strength dwarfs his own, how he can simply press <override> on everything she's done, but also dumbfounded at the idea
"It was a girl, wasn’t it?”
JOHN: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Thanks to an opportune flash of static in the sky, John can discern a patch of rock penetrating the sky line 20 meters away. He seizes the opportunity and crawls toward it before he loses his orientation again. He only makes it about halfway though.
"What, do people not usually point that out to you?" John demands, irked. "God is the male ego really this fragile?" he contemplates to himself, following him out the door. For the love of- Was this what women had to deal with all the time? It was utter garbage.
her walk away without a single murder conviction."
“Oh, is
“Hello,” Mary copies him.
He hadn't been able to finish because Molly had turned around and slapped him across the face. Not the petty kind of slap you use to bring someone to their senses or make them apologize. It'd been laced with actual vitriol, a direct affront that she'd done without even thinking, swift as a reflex. She slapped him because she literally couldn't stand the sight of him.
Mycroft sighs. "Her reach extends well above me, John. I’m afraid almost nothing short of a governmental coup will be enough to rid London of her influence.”
“Couldn’t you exercise just a little sensitivity? I’m not asking for much, just a modicum would be nice,” he says, “I mean, how do you think that made me look?”
and so much of it is directed at
"No bitching about Sherlock today?" Rose asks as John is making dinner.
John's eyes gravitate from his hands back up to him, wondering how he can possibly know to play it like that. If Sherlock's never felt anything close to being lovelorn, how can he capture an emotion he's never felt and isn't feeling? It's the most brutal thing he's ever listened to, like looking into a mirror.
are the one that's attacking
5. ARE YOU CUNNING OR MANIPULATIVE?
“So are you the other one, then?” Sherlock returns out of curiosity, arms crossed and perfectly poised. The remark seems to baffle the youth.
John blinks.
Then it occurs to John that she's actually making fun of him. His jaw clenches tight and something sharp and bitter twists in his chest. "Don't let me stop you- enjoy staring longingly at Sherlock all by your lonesome for the rest of eternity," she smiles warmly, giving him a wave as she leaves.
SHERLOCK: I THINK MY SENSE OF SELF WORTH IS ACCURATE AND WELL-FOUNDED.
He swallows, glancing toward the door. "Perhaps we ought not to be doing this here," he says evasively, "If someone came in-"
?” John asks, blinking back at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
you walked her down the bloody aisle.”
"You don't understand- Someone is doing this to me!" Sherlock pays him no heed.
“I’m sorry Dr. Watson, but that’s all I’m at liberty to disclose. If you’ll excuse me, I have several more autopsies to do today.”
"Of course," John stammers, flustered not only at the implication, but the way he says it, his voice like a purring car engine. John quirks a self-stabbing smile, "Why wouldn't it be?"
John scowls, bewildered at how he can get away with jokes like that (of course, it's partly because he lets him). He crosses his arms, now completely convinced the vital organ beating in his chest has been robbed on purpose and the dastardly bandit is just standing there, red-handed yet unwitting. He scintillates on the threshold, his bloody waistcoat open at the chest and gleaming silver where the sunlight hits it around his waist, cinched against the small of his back. He's far too cheeky to be allowed. There has got to be some legal provision against it somewhere, just like there are speed limits and box junctions.
He’s running up the staircase in his mind palace, past iron railings and marble floors. He bursts into the drawing room on the second floor, where he pulls out file cabinet with case files dating back to 2007. There, on October 9th, 2007, is a murder victim shot to death in a Battersea parking lot. In the case file is Anderson’s forensics report, portraying the splitting image of Alexander under the name of John Doe. Bullets recovered from the body indicate the murder weapon is a .44 Magnum Desert Eagle- the very same Gabriel was carrying.
“If anyone has reason for these two not to wed, speak now or forever hold your peace,” is not usually something the pastor feels compelled to say, however on this particular occasion, he hesitates to preside with an official announcement of matrimony because he detects the presence of hell in the room. The question, of course, is met with silence, but this particular silence speaks much louder than words.
“You’re making fun of yourself Sherlock,” she tells him lamely.
"Alright, you got me. I was going to make it rain hell on earth before I let that man get away with what he did," she says like the idea is laughable, "As though I was going to let him die happily in a cottage in Nice."
"Dad?" Mary’s voice sounds like glass, her deep blue eyes weighing down on him as though she doesn’t recognize him anymore. John swallows, feeling a sudden surge of guilt.
"That is assuming you buy the idea he underwent a midlife change in sexual orientation," he says, his hand leaving hers. He looks away, turning the file back to the colder cases with the scores of women Oscar slaughtered.
"You're right. He's
JOHN: DEPENDS ON SHERLOCK.
"Hundred."
Mary: Make it past two. You know. To observe any potential changes since I left.
It's been a week. Absolutely nothing has changed. Sherlock is just as dead as he was seven days ago. Just as sombre. Just as still. Looking just as he did in life, in a nostalgic, brutal, and cruel kind of way, his image a perpetual reminder of everything he did so royally wrong.
“Are you going to get that?” John asks Sherlock, who is gazing out the window. John is otherwise preoccupied at the moment, struggling to get their power back online not because of the storm, no, but because someone’s corrosives inexplicably made their way into the circuit breaker, which has since gone haywire.
"You seem to have taken a keen interest in his death, given that he's a rapist," she says in response to his history lesson. Sherlock's eyes flit up again, then lower to the closeness of her mouth, lined with the classic shade of her lipstick. The color is a match to what he found on the victim, but the chemical composition? He would need a sample to test- She kisses him, catching him off guard. The force of it pushes him backward, making him release a noise of surprise. He freezes, his back rigid against the wall. Then he gives in to that ever-present desire to prove himself right and lets his eyes fall shut.
Do u prefer fluff or angst?
He quickly runs out of ground and his back presses up against the wall. He falls against the bookshelf, a tome on the
“So what do we think about this Nigel person?” Sherlock asks as they file out of the office, John a pace ahead.
"Do you really want to see him?" she asks, in all earnestness.
“Speaking of the devil,” Sherlock smiles.
, or you can go on and tell her I’m not seeing anyone,” John tells him in his authoritative, putting-his-foot-down voice. Keeping his eyes trained on Sherlock, he jabs his finger toward their daughter like he’s telling a dog to go fetch.
"What?" Sherlock snaps irritably at John's unrelenting glare. The way he looks- you'd think Sherlock has done him the disservice of swiping his jammed toast or something. The vibes he's giving off are so dark and menacing it would make any six foot tall man feel small, not just Sherlock.
Sherlock issues a surreal, deeply unsettling laugh, and John feels everything veer up-side-down at the sound of it. "Is this the part where you tell me 'this is going to hurt me more than you'?" he says. John is disturbed by how much he relates to the sentiment.
After all he had done the same thing not 24 hours earlier- repressed every natural emotion and reaction until all that was left was a rancorous demeanor and a few cutting, biting remarks- effectively suppressing the trauma until it was ironed out into a tame, picture-perfect semblance of
When Sherlock finally does say something, it's "The ratio of the second and forth fingers on the strangle marks- it's off," which seems to make little sense to anyone other than himself.
Mary giggles at him. “Perfect. You really are perfect,” she grins, completely besotted by him, “Can’t I marry you?”
Sherlock is completely behaved and contained, and sends John a quick, broken look, asking him to stop, but John isn’t finished with him yet. Sherlock has indulged in petty torture, resorted to much baser tactics of punishment, one too many times for the doctor to let this one slide. Now John has it in for him.
-“ he says after him, more to the flailing tail end of his scarf than to him. Sherlock isn't paying him any attention and John is quickly losing his temper. His attire, by the way, was annoying too. He'd decided on a grey suit instead of black, and switched his blue scarf for a red one- what was he, a christmas present? The most grievous transgression was that he'd ditched the coat today. Why had he ditched the coat. It was all very unlike him, soft around the edges, inviting, alluring,
“No," Sherlock looks and sounds deeply affected, tightening his arms around him, "You’re okay now, John. You’re fine. You’re going to be fine.”
He takes Sherlock's head gingerly in his hands. At first he just wants him not to be scared to death as he is, and then he's lost track of what he's doing in the mess of emotions. Whether he's holding him or kissing him or the breaking the rules on what-men-are-supposed-to-do-if-they-are-NOT-GAY he has no idea. Probably all of the above.
"Naturally. It's the seventh victim in a row," Sherlock says, and John has to wonder where this newfound sensitivity is coming from. He actually appears to be rather sore about this case come to think of it-- the way he often looks when John has tragically disappointed him by separating the eyeballs from the pickle jar in the refrigerator or buying salt that isn't laboratory grade. He would've thought the detective would be thrilled for what was shaping up to be either a 9 or a 10 in the midst of what has been a monotony of two and a half's, but he doesn't comment. After all, he's not the fanatic of the two of them, he likes to think.
SHERLOCK: YOU KNOW WHAT’S GENERALLY CONSIDERED POOR JUDGEMENT? ACCUSING POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS, POTENTIALLY SOCIOPATHIC PERSONS OF POOR JUDGEMENT.
Mariage D'Amour is not actually by Chopin, but everyone thinks it is for some reason
Sherlock’s trying not to grit his teeth, biting softly on his index as it twirls restlessly over his canine. The pleasure surpasses another tier and he ends up biting down on his knuckle to keep the vocals at bay. “He’s sorry.” He obviously wasn’t before, but Sherlock looks very sorry right now, John thinks, smiling a smug and black-hearted smile that comes across tender and sweet as he looks into his fiancée’s eyes. “Yes, I think so.”
John feels himself shaking uncontrollably, nails digging into the palms of his hands. "That's not possible."
“Hey dad. Dad.” Mary shakes his shoulder, but John’s head swivels lifelessly. “Daaad,” she whines, like seven year olds do. She huffs when she finally grows tired of shaking him.
Mary looks shocked. "What, seriously?"
“Just don’t choke.”
As a spur-of-the moment whim manufactured by his emotionally-unstable brain, John casually leans forward and gives him a thank-you kiss, befitting the theme of the conversation. Dark lashes fall closed in the second their mouths meet, but open instantly after, the detective's expression remaining immaculately still, collected, neutral.
when I found it conducive to extracting information out of her. Not that you would know, but seduction is a multipurpose tool. It's one- if not the most- effective methods of interrogation."
"Yes sorry about this last minute thing. Sherlock was off on a case and I got called in-" John offers explanatively.
Before, John had admired him and made no effort to keep his attentions a secret (since Sherlock never missed a thing anyway). Sherlock hadn't minded in the slightest and had in fact liked how John's eyes followed him around. He'd always give him a smirk and return the look for a brief moment whenever he caught John looking at him, as if to say, "I am extraordinary, aren't I?", looking like a cat that got the milk. But John feels like hasn't any right to be looking at him like that, not anymore, not after what he'd let happen. Sherlock is on the mark in pointing out the emotion for what it is, shame, but has horribly mistaken it's direction. John isn't ashamed of him, he's ashamed of himself. Every time he looks at him it only serves to remind him of how miserably he failed to protect him.
At some point, in the context of his own screams, he hears those of someone else. And then another, and then several more, this time closer. His abusers let up and stop trying to tear his arm out of its socket, their attention turned in the direction of the commotion.
“Yes but I’m allowed,” Sherlock says by way of explanation, despite the fact that it explains nothing.
“Sherlock.”
“What?”
“Can’t we wake him up already?” she whines, looking up from her father’s peacefully clocked-out face.
John leans his hands against the counter, his head angled downward, his jaw wired shut. Steam travels upward from the basin, catching the glare of the clouds.
17. DO YOU GENERALLY LACK THE ABILITY TO REACT EMOTIONALLY?
John has half a mind to smack him across the face. "You don't think that."
“No way…” Nigel teems wide-eyed and mind-blown, thrilled at his discovery, “You have two dads!”
He shifts up and flops back down, grunting at the recurring pain in his shoulder which seems to grow more vindictive by the hour, and wishes momentarily that he had some of the military grade morphine he used to hand out so liberally.
“Might be difficult for someone with trust issues,” Sherlock admits, finding it significantly harder to breathe with John’s wingspan wrapped around him like an anaconda.
Sherlock grins as he saunters into the restaurant on the Strand where he and the woman are meant to rendezvous, thinking that with any luck, he'll have his serial killer by close of business day today. He takes his seat at the table reserved for them near a panoramic window showcasing the Thames, and waits to see if his killer will show. It's a shame he couldn't bring John along for it, (but from what he understands, dates are intended for two people and not three).
“We don’t need this. There’s no reason for us to jump ships, we’re both Golden Globe nominated actors. You can find a new cast.”
There's no service or anything in particular to commemorate his death. It seems the local mortician and parish have gotten tired of the formalities and would rather take the weekend off than cater to another one of Sherlock's fraudulent demises.
Upon dropping the load by the growing pile of combustables, he ventures a glance back at the seascape. The creature, still surveying his labors, brazenly returns his gaze in silence. Its demeanor exudes the feeling of almost haughty arrogance, the way it so boldly meets his eyes and basks flamboyantly on its throne of bedrock, not feeling obligated to explain its proximity. John looks away, removing his cursory gaze before it becomes an incautious stare, and repeats his trek down the shoreline to gather more driftwood.
“You have something of mine.”
He returns to his flat with a wet cat look on his face that sends the alarmed Mrs. Hudson scuttling away. Upon entering his flat, he sheds his blazer and whips off the necktie that’d been irritating him since this morning, throwing it on the backrest of the desk chair as like it’s something out of a thrift store dumpster and not Prada. It’s as he’s unbuttoning his collar that he catches a glance of himself in the hallway mirror. He rings his fingers around his throat, taking stock of the bruising around his neck. The imprints are particularly intriguing to see on himself- the classic sort of markings you see immortalized on the corpses of cut-and-dry murder cases.
John is so far beyond words right now. He can barely hear himself think with his pulse hammering in his head like this.
"Suspect what?" John blinks, at which Sherlock grins fiendishly, apparently pleased by the comment, and goes on his merry way.
John looks up at him questioningly. “You’re looking at the man responsible for the brutal murders of twenty nine individuals, still unaccounted for, between the years 1974 and 79. You know, the one I told you about.”
,” he says with conviction.
"He's not dead."
"You're right I'm not," he says, scanning through ads for cardio machines and the latest pharmaceuticals.
It’s the first thing he’s said since he got up at the crack of dawn, pacing back and forth along the carpet like he can't stand not being in two places at once. His shoes make clicking sounds as they stride over the hardwood floor.
“Yes,
Anderson plucks out a business card from his pocket after giving him a wary look and hands it to him. "For when the bodies start showing up in your flat. You call me," he tells him in all seriousness, making sure he's been understood before striding off. John is too miffed for words.
John literally just stands there, unable to think of anything to say. The steely, cold look in her eyes paralyzes him. It occurs to him how wrong it was to blame her for everything he did, when Sherlock's death was enough to handle as it is.
"Would you?" Sherlock says, handing the tie and pendant to him.
Sherlock grips the side of the blonde’s head. "John. Please don’t," he pleads, ineffectively. He tries pressing a kiss back, but John clenches his teeth, choking a sob.
"You? Catch me?" she repeats amusedly, "Is that what you think is going on here?"
He's shaking head to foot, struck by how real all of it feels, although in staring back at the monster that is so far beyond what his mind is willing to believe, his mind gives up on trying to understand, rejecting the idea that any of it could be, for all intensive purposes, real or actually happening.
Sherlock demands, incensed and needlessly belligerent, “Are you content to just
JOHN: GEE, I DON’T KNOW. BAD?
"So you've decided to have your way with it," he says, in summary, with all the morally reprehensible implications.
“You look beautiful,” she says, which is a euphemism for worser things, most probably along the lines of 'I despise you to your core'. Mary feels her blood run cold at the venom of her mother-in-law’s voice.
"Mycroft was so angry, he had the dog put down the same day," she recounts. John feels a twinge of sorrow hearing that, how he risked his life to save something only to have it taken away anyway. He can understand why he never mentioned the dog. "Of course, that didn't fix the problem. He gets too attached to things."
"Sherlock?" he asks again, leaning into the door. The silent treatment. Stellar.
"You're saying that life-and-death battle going on over there is a stunt?" she asks dubiously, as the ominous sound of someone flatlining permeates the waiting room. Some on-call staff bustle by in an otherwise typical, mundane night at the hospital.
"Oh look the both of you here. Look at that, bug," Clara notes the novelty when she catches a glimpse of the two of men, and turns to inform the toddler with a shoulder pat.
“No. It- what I want--”
Mary wanders back into the living room, finding Sherlock motionless on the settee. “You
“Kiss him?” Sherlock retorts, amidst scanning through police reports on his phone, “I fail to see how that would improve the situation.”
"Oh... Nothing," John says, which inevitably means something, something 'serious'. He's giving Sherlock with the 'test me, I dare you' smile. Sherlock is happy to oblige, having never been a man of caution.
It stopped. Only a fraction of a second before it would have sliced his carotid and reduced him to a puddle of six liters blood on sand, it stopped. Perhaps on a whim, spur of thought, change of heart, who knows.
the case files?"
He ultimately gives John a flat-out categorical "no," with no further comment or explanation, and turns on his heel. To his credit, there's really no way he could have said it plainer than that.
you-" John insists, or rather implores, willing him to consider that surely that warrants an exception. He needs him to acknowledge somehow that what happened was not just something that came with the territory in the line of work, that they can’t just sweep it under the rug and carry on with business as usual.
He manages to convince himself that the notion of shark-eating men is ridiculous. And backwards. And that even the most horrific depictions of mermaids in folklore don't do that. But the thought stirs up a vague memory, something from a myth, fairy tale, or dream, of sinister, siren-like creatures that pull sailors under and drag them to their deaths.
“H-hey. Hey. Hello. My name is..” the water murmurs over the rush, to John’s absolute disbelief.
so much?”
Sherlock knows what that tone of voice means. It means it’s time for a
The smile vanishes from Sherlock's face and he pauses, processing that, which Mary sees and interprets as hurt. She turns on her father, who is making his way across the living room.
“Just because I made it doesn’t mean it’s unfit for human consumption.”
The words come out harsher than he'd imagined. Sherlock does a soft intake of breath and stiffens, and John realizes that he's gone a bit too far. But Sherlock keeps his face unaffected as stone, maintaining a facade of indifference. Rather than deign to respond, he doesn't broach the subject at all, but rather bows out of the conversation, aloof and miraculously unaffected as ever.
“Now. You have to teach me now,” she decides.
Sherlock is leaning above him, cradling more and more of his weight, and John feels himself swaying backward, their noses aligned, touching so that he’s staring down the end of Sherlock’s nose, not his own. It’s ridiculous. The more John tries to avoid him, the further Sherlock leans in, constantly nudging John back. It’s flirtation, really, it is.
"What? I'm not obsessed with you."
"It was a long time ago. We had to get rid of the dog. It was causing certain... uncalled-for complications." Mycroft says, nursing a nicotine craving with one low-tar cigarette. "Who told you he had a dog?" Mycroft enquires, keeping his other hand in his pocket, shielded from the cold.
John’s mind is blown. Possibly broken. “What?”
“Are you really crying?” Sherlock enquires in amazement, rounding the bend of the mattress. The window-light reveals he is in formal attire, a dress shirt, sharply-cut, pleated navy trousers and black wingtips. “That’s not very English,” he tsks.
Then, unexpectedly, he's gone. In a swerve of footstool tearing across the ground and a flash of silver eyes, he takes his leave, as if having taken offense to the soldier's unchecked stare. It's only seconds later that the soldier recovers his senses enough to notice the cloaked man left a coin, still spinning on the table. He hollers after the man to call his attention to it. But he's gone out the back door in a furl of cape.
Instead, to her amazement, he folds. He slips past her and actually
"You don't have anything on me," he retorts.
When John tries to hold him, Sherlock actually bites him, and when John touches his fingers to his mouth it comes away with blood. He blinks at it, and then Sherlock in dismay, his mouth curving upward at the absurdity of the situation.
"John what would you say if a woman asked you out?" he asks urgently.
“No, what?”
John stares after him, then sinks his face into his face hands. Just talking about it with someone else makes it seem more real. He hadn't been able to say it out loud. He's hardly able to admit it to himself, much less others.
But Sherlock is so convinced John is feeding him lies Sherlock can't bear the sight of him. "It wouldn't surprise me," he answers the forbidding look on John's face that's a truckload of octagonal stop signs warning him not to continue, "It would certainly explain a lot."
John looks at him and can only wonder
normal? Perhaps
“I think I’m lost. Do you think you could help me? My name is..” the vortex trills confusedly.
“Stop talking.”
“Okay, Sherlock,” John turns around with a cheery tone of voice, “let’s pretend for a second that you
“First, it was ‘I’m not gay’ now it’s ‘you’re not a parent’. You know you only have to say things once, to produce an effect,” Sherlock informs him with patronizing didacticism, “After that it’s just moot.”
"So you do think so little of me," he says using a tone John had been on the receiving end of from many a scratched lover. He refuses to believe what John would have him think, that his struggles are futile and his defeat inevitable. "All those things you said were just lies." John's breath hitches.
“Would you rather be bored?” she asks from behind him.
SHERLOCK: NO. IT'S JUST THAT OTHER PEOPLE DISPLAY TO MUCH OF IT. IT'S HARDLY NECESSARY AND OFTEN SERVES AS A HINDRANCE AS YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED.
“Having a daughter,” she elaborates, semi-baffled. Sherlock quirks his head to the side.
"Are you going to eat anything?" she asks, when he dismisses the waiter's pestering suggestions.
"He seems tense," John remarks.
John turns around sharply, half expecting to find Sherlock there, admiring how his evil plan is working. Instead he finds his sister, Eurus, looking at him with an amused smile.
“Don't be absurd,” Sherlock says, attempting to push his way past as he's slipping on his gloves. “She bested me last time, but I’m not letting her get away this time."
Harry comes in to retrieve something from the fridge, cracking open the door. “Yeah, John any time you two need a ‘sex holiday’ just ring us up,” she gives him an askance smirk, and John looks momentarily alarmed, then glares back humorlessly, his arms crossed and spine straight with militaristic standoffishness.
John struggles to offer some alternative explanation to "Um, he is otherwise occupied?" but Sherlock has since ventured down to the first floor and joins them, his voice sounding from behind John. “You can stand up now, John. I wouldn’t waste your medical attentions on him,” he says casually, leaning against the wall.
Assuming he might be able to translate, Lestrade angles at John, who shoots him a look that means don't look at me.
my Listerine use.
"No you're not!" Sherlock finally puts his foot down, narrowing his eyes at John's wide-eyed expression, "Yes, I'm all fine with the progressive nonsense until you actually get hurt. Then we're going to have problems."
It had been inexplicable to him up until that point, but in listening to him, it starts to makes sense, in bits and pieces, why she had done what she had done. It wasn't for any of the typical motives a criminal might have to attack the investigator of their own crime. It hadn't been conflict of interest, cover up, collateral, or anything of the sort, that had brought her to his doorstep.
"Nevermind," John sighs. It was an equally stupid and pointless question. He shouldn't even be entertaining the possibility that what Eurus had said during his earlier visit was anything other than a manipulative design.
"What was that about?" John asks, turning to him.
"Enough!" John is getting royally pissed with his manic need logicify everything. "What you're doing to yourself is far worse than what I would ever do to you. You might not think of yourself this way Sherlock, but you are flesh and blood, and when your body finally stops so will
While enjoying himself a pint, one soldier notices a man perched at a out-of-the-way corner table amidst the commotion. The soldier can't help but stare, intrigued by the strange, brooding atmosphere of the man sitting at the bar, not drinking anything. He has a cloak thrown over his shoulders and an unusually aristocratic, regal bearing that is at odds with the commonplace, unrefined backdrop of the tavern. He keeps to himself, very poised and still and waiting, far away from the appeals of the various brews they have on tap. But he also appears to be curiously on-edge, nervously tapping his fingers, giving off the impression of an addict trying to restrain himself.
The infantry is celebrating their return to reserves after a brutal season on the frostlines, squandering their commission on lagers and spirits at the tavern. The crowd consists of a total of two dozen soldiers of the northumberland fusilier regiment, flooding the bar and stirring up a riot, loud and obnoxious and hollering at the bar maids.
Mary goes wide-eyed and checks her pocket, pulls out the elusive booklet. She flips it around. “Oh. Well, shit.”
"Can we get back to waltz?" John sighs, mildly irked he hadn’t noticed that his very own limbs, which, whence last he checked, had been moving predictably in triple meter, had been casually repurposed. Not that he minds learning ballet particularly, just the being-taken-for-a-ride-as-if-he-were-a-bloody-Chevrolet part, blissfully unaware he’d even been high-jacked. Does he not own his body anymore, has it been commandeered as part of Sherlock’s transport?
Emotional distress? After a brief spell of shock, he’s amused, his lips bending upward into a smirk.
. If you cannot not satisfy that simple condition, no matter what you do, you will never be their father,” Sherlock replies with the dispassionate boredom one might read a dictionary with, because that’s essentially what he’s doing.
"I don't."
“That I exist. Me. I’m the data,” she says, flailing her arms.
“Not dead yet, I hope?” are the first words to greet his ears as he comes to. Hazily, he registers the figure of a man standing over him, silhouetted against the overhead LED lights. He's dressed in all-black, night raid gear. His face, however, is uncovered, revealing a striking head of blond hair that is in stark contrast to the rest of his sombre attire.
"But you I would blackmail rather than bait."
He looks at John in incomprehension. "John, unhand me-" he commands, but when he starts forward, it's like walking into an unmoving wall.
“I’ll just be a moment,” he says, walking promptly away.
“So,” he admits, a little bashfully, “For all my deductive powers, I am unable to eliminate the possibility you may be marrying the tall one.” He points to a figure that looks remarkably like himself, rapidly walking backward down the center of the room and reverse deducing the identity of the mayfly man's target.
"He said, and I quote, 'Sherlock, if you do not oblige me, I will strip you of your statutory rights, one by one.'
But a wave of stormy ocean flattens over the stone, and his nerves jitter out of control again. His eyes flutter down to the blackness of the surrounding ocean, beginning to spiral around the circumference of the rock, like an ominous mixture stirring in a pot.  The rush of water whizzes around his ears with a hissing
The point of a... what? Come again? John wonders vaguely if this is some bizarre dream. "Where are you going?" he asks irrationally after him. Seeing him walk off like that does things to him he would never admit to. He's wearing a cologne that wafts around him, sweeping over John like a wave as he walks by.
“Um, funny story that…” Nigel says shiftily.
Sherlock looks at Nigel tellingly, with raised eyebrows.
“You can keep doing what you’re doing.”
That realization is the most crushing part- how he had discarded everything Sherlock had said and done in favor of the idea he didn't mean any of it. Everything he thought he knew about Sherlock had been wrong. He wasn't a sociopath as he had so fixedly, blindly believed. Sherlock had died protecting him and John hadn't even realized it, only to discover it all now, months after the fact.
As he walks down the hall the temperature nosedives to below freezing. He crosses his arms and tries to keep his teeth from chattering and freeze-drying off.
"Don't you think it's romantic?" she asks curiously, because that’s the impression she’s gotten thus far.
"What?" she says.
There’s a sharpness to its gaze that shouldn’t be there. As it leans forward it sets John on edge— the way its eyes cut into him him with an incisiveness that seems to convey its mind is just as sharp as it teeth, implicative of that silent, deadly weapon— intellect— and a more volatile, passionate nature smoldering beneath the surface, like fire tiptoeing around gasoline.
Mary frowns.
The last time John and Sherlock had a
“What do I want.. What do I want?" It laughs, like he's being absurd, "I want
"I'm afraid you can't. He's being prepped for organ donation."
"I have no idea. I'm making it up,” Sherlock mutters offhandedly, and John looks taken aback, flummoxed. This is even worse than looking into his eyes and miraculously knowing waltz… Whether or not it’s possible to know what Sherlock’s going to do before he does it and why he would subject himself to the sheer awkwardness of making it look like he can, he can’t say, but he knows that he must be doing this on purpose, setting himself up; there’s not way he’s not, except for the reality of the fact that… he’s not.
"Nothing?" Rose asks, quite astonished. It's a first.
John can’t believe his ears. “Now you’re just being ridiculous.”
Mary pauses to consider this. It hadn’t occurred to her.
“On the contrary, John,” Sherlock smirks, irises burning in the ambient firelight, “I’m listening. Always listening." He sinks back on his heels. "And I’m not liable to leave.”
Before John realises what he's doing, he's leapt forward to squeeze him in a hug, so sudden and desperate and senseless that he startles Sherlock. Mistaking the nonsensical outburst of affection for violence, Sherlock panics and struggles against him in alarm. Despite his spurned advances, John tightens his arms around him, trying to get him to understand he doesn't want to hurt him (which, though a noble endeavor paved with good intentions, is kind of backfiring).
“I didn’t want to say it,” Sherlock disclaims.
"Get away from him," the words seethe out of him, sounding more rottweiler than human, rage having the curious effect of making John profoundly articulate.
"Yet your killer remains at large." Having already made a beeline to his desk, Sherlock slams a sheet of paper on the table.
“The indiscriminate manner in which this serial killer operates is unlike anything I have ever seen,” he mumbles pensively through his fingers, “Jumping from city to city, across nations, like they are trying to outrun something... Or chase something."
First three chapters are prologue and may be skipped if you prefer to get straight to the point fyi
Sherlock stares at her as they rotate in space, undecided, his breath caught in a sort of amused, standoffish silence.
Wrong?
The brunet parts his lips and runs a thumb over the line of incisors, marvelling at the sad state of his canines— almost non-existently small and only in one set, while the merperson knows himself have eight and four additional smaller ones, and the wounded shark overhead to wield well over three-hundred.
in their not-so-distant past where they got handcuffed together in a more permanent sense. "No, I got it," he assures him.
"What?" she gives at his ominous, very-pleased-with-himself smile. His finger rims around the edge of his wine glass, which his restless mind has repurposed to cater his fidgeting habits rather than its conventional use as an aid to sip brain-slowing concoctions.
The after-party follows in the reception area, where Mary and Nigel are talking to their friends, one of which that claims Mary was the girl who used to beat Nigel up in secondary.
“Hello Ajay," his murderer had said, "And, goodbye.” Followed by the shot of a gun. Then the impression of an outstretched hand appeared like a shadow against the filtering light and griped his shoulder, pulling him upward.
Sherlock: Done.
Sherlock is pacing back an forth, circling him like he's trying to find a way forward but can't. He's wrestling with himself, coursing his fingers through his dark curls like he wants to pull his hair out.
“How about we play a game?” she asks.
“Is this a joke?”
“Oh they didn’t tell you?” the screenwriter shrugs, “BBC1 finally caved and sold
“I doubt he’d be much help anyways. If you can’t deduce it I don’t think he can.”
“Well since she was crying I thought I’d give her something to actually cry about,” he remarks as he moves between aisles. Greg gawks at him, which he nearly misses in the process of hunting down the rogue evidence box.
“No?” Sherlock asks, perplexed by John’s curious behavior. The doctor is standing in the doorway, clenching his fists and staring fixedly at the ground.
"Sherlock,
Before he can stop himself from asking, it's out there. "What did she do to you?" So much for treading lightly.
At Sherlock's look of condescension he tries "Umbrella?" but the suggestion is met with equal disdain, as though John has scandalously asked him to convert to Satanism. John lets it drop, acknowledging that in this particular bout of tug-of-war, it is inevitable that pragmatism take a backseat to fashion- and the ongoing boycott on Mycroft-themed merchandise.
“It feels like you could vanish into thin air,” John says, eyes running over him in fascination. Sherlock lets go a little, possibly because he likes the attention.
John bristles. "
"John, you didn't-"
the caller resumes awkwardly, finally on board. Fourth wall. As if in a play. Should he take a bow?
“Looks like you got into a bit of a..” John vaguely indicates his partner’s state of disarray, “skirmish.”
Rather than relief, John feels something eerie run through him.
“Hm. You know, that’s not very surprising, seeing that you’re
JOHN: WELL, I DON’T BUT HE.. (HE THINKS HE’S A SOCIOPATH.)
“No.”
“Of course its for selfish reasons. This is classic manipulative behavior, the hallmark of any self-respecting sociopath. He wants me to think he isn't one but I am not liable to make that mistake again.”
“Magical pixy horses.”
“Hey, don’t shoot the messenger, alright. I work with what I’m given.”
The evident truth that belies all these actions: John Watson has decided to partake in intensely passive-aggressive practice of angst dishwashing, as patented by his fellow flatmate and co-parent, Sherlock Holmes.
When they finally find the position on the rack where the case box ought to be, they lift the lid to an unpromising blank box that looks like it’s just sitting there as a placeholder.
"Mycroft brought him here to keep him safe," a voice echoes behind him, suddenly interrupting the pin-drop silence. It scares the living daylights out of him. He blots around to see Eurus stroll in casually, his heart hammering in his chest. He has to marvel at how she even made it in here, seeing that she left dead bodies in her wake when she visited last. Since then the whole site has been on high alert-- but apparently not high enough.
“What’s so funny?” he frowns.
The cold nips at his nose and cheeks, stealing away the feeling in his hands and feet as he continues staring at Sherlock endlessly, in spite of her taunting him about that earlier. His thoughts go back to what she said- that she could fix him. Was she telling him what he wanted to hear? Was she conducting some sort of psychological experiment on him? Maybe she was just toying with him.
Or perhaps it proliferates, becomes too blatant to ignore, like that large, white elephant, audience member of one, sitting all sophisticated and in its element over there by the lamp shade and window sill and displaced breakfast table.
“What happened? Did you get into a fight?” John asks.
“You’re angry with me aren’t you,” Sherlock asks with feigned innocence.
the way he says it.
Perhaps it's a natural conclusion to draw, one that may even be true, but he struggles to follow what she's playing at exactly. He can't tell what bearing this has on the game, if any. He’s aware some players use psychological tactics to intimidate their opponent, however it's weak ploy normally used to gain an edge, not to salvage a hopeless situation.
"Not only have I saved you, I've killed for you. And I'd do worse." He doesn't like the way it sounds like a threat, but he doesn't shy away from it either.
"And why is that?"
Sherlock is having difficulty following so she decides to spell it out for him. "Let me rephrase. Don't you think you should be running in the opposite direction?"
Sherlock doesn’t answer the question, turning his face away so that a curtain of curls fall over his face. John hates to bear witness to how he keeps repeating these uncharacteristic mannerisms, one after another, textbook symptoms glaring him in the face. They don’t suit him at all.
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I boring you?" John asks, peeved. God forbid, Sherlock should ever find himself bored.
“John,” Sherlock whimpers.
3. DO YOU HAVE AN EXCESS NEED FOR STIMULATION OR PRONENESS TO BOREDOM?
“Hello Wallace. I don’t think we’ve spoken yet,” Sherlock glances at Mrs. Davenport’s much milder counterpart. The man wears rectangular, cinereous half-frames around his celeste irises, and is marked by Norwegian-decent, platinum-blonde hair. He wears a grey three-piece suit that complements his wife’s dress.
John continues unbuttoning the shirt, his hands unsteady. He was naturally about to ask what had happened but now he’s having difficulty raising the question. That flinch spoke volumes. He’s usually more astute about the trend in women- the low eye contact, aversion to touch, erratic behavior— It’s impossible for him to ignore that Sherlock’s exhibiting the textbook signs of trauma. John's hands start shaking, so Sherlock silently takes over, undoing the buttons himself.
“It’s true. I’ve seen it,” she insists.
Then he hears a splash, and his electric green eyes dart to a plume of white twenty meters above, disturbing the placid face of the ocean. The source of the excitement is a rapid manoeuvre of the caudal fin of a great white, its light silhouette circling in the shallow depths. He lifts off the floor in a swift arc of motion and ventures toward the predator with energetic, powerful thrusts, until he is close enough to identify what has sparked the shark's interest.
11. IS YOUR BEHAVIOUR ANTISOCIAL FOR NO GOOD REASON?
"Sherlock?" he asks, uncertain if he'll get a response, "I've made more tea."
“It was the Altoid you took afterward that was the determining factor,” he says that like it's a conviction to murder in the first degree, but in the heat of the moment John fails to comprehend what the Altoid, on top of it all, could possibly mean, other than the truth of the matter which is that he likes British mints that taste like green tea. So does Sherlock. So does everyone. Who the hell doesn't?
JOHN: IF I APPEAR THAT WAY IT’S LIKELY BECAUSE YOU’RE KIND OF WASTING MY TIME.
“That’s bullshit.”
"We're going to Camden," he informs John, doubling his scarf around his collar.
He strides across the living room and stands face forward in front of Sherlock. Despite the fact that he’s standing directly in Sherlock’s way, Sherlock makes no change to his present course, intending either to push him aside or run him over.
Sherlock frowns, looking up from the glow of the screen, his expression so starkly clinical and laden with skepticism that it speaks for itself.
Sherlock finds himself marveling at the ineptitude of the average Homo sapien. “Come on, Lestrade. The number that follows seventy-eight thirty-four,
“Oh and Mary—“ the mother begins, reclaiming Mary’s attention.
“Do you need the body now? I kind of had a thing—” she says awkwardly from the stairwell.
“Your life must be a running nightmare,” says Sherlock, taking a sort of cruel delight in winding him up.
“He is!” she yells, flustered. Thankfully, Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind the potentially disruptive increase in volume.
Sherlock removes himself from his arms, preferring his corner of darkness to letting John see how aggravated he is, which is immature, granted, but even so John sort of understands, (because when where either of them ever really mature?). Well, at least he would understand if John were someone he actually needed to hide his emotions from.
"The more you talk, the less it seems like you have any understanding of what forensic science actually is."
“Who are you talking to?” they inquire contemptuously. Mary rolls her eyes in annoyance at their approaching interloper. Sherlock steps toward the gate again to get a look at the child who has summoned their attention.
Against him or
Mary warily pushes the plate away, scraping the bottom against the acid-burnt table top. Sherlock frowns on the gesture, closing the fridge door.
“Oh hi Sherlock. Can I call you Sherly? I’m your new screenwriter. Will Donahue.”
“No thanks.”
"What does that mean? You're saying we're looking for a woman?" Lestrade takes a step back and points to the cadaver, or what's left of it anyway. "You're saying a woman did this," he repeats in contention, his eyebrows rising up past his hairline incredulously.
“We don’t want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Just stick to your lines, don’t say anything interpretable as atheist or unheterosexual. It’s probably best to just avoid the mother-in-law completely—“ They finish their ascent up the flight of stairs and discover a few miscellaneous relatives of the groom at the entrance. Sherlock’s voice becomes quieter and quieter as they approach the doorway. “—but if you do accidentally walk into her just be polite and say hello—Hello,” Sherlock greets a particularly stark figure at the door.
