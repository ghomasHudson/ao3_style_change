"But something's gone wrong?"
“Alright?” He asks gently. Sherlock blinks, turning away and visibly pulling himself back under control; his spine stiffening and his face smoothing.
He heads for a Christmas shop a few streets over, deciding upon an experiment that will provide him sufficient kinetic release. He will be near useless if he can’t get his transport under control by the time John returns.
you didn’t offer that fact to the young DI to garner additional favour.” His voice has a cold, cutting edge, like bitterness.
"What does he want?"
“John.” Sherlock says the name as if reminding himself of something. His eyes are closed and he is breathing rapidly. John takes Sherlock's thin wrist and presses his fingertips into it to check his pulse. It is thumping wildly.
He couldn't face
"Does this have a point?" His tone is dripping with irritation. He rises to his feet, his eyes locked on John and his head tilted to the side; a bit like a snake ready to strike. John knows that he' is running out of time to turn this around.
There is a man clothed in white, a surgeon. His hands are sweeping, plunging, pulling and stitching within a sea of red. Such carefully choreographed motions. He is an anchoring point, his golden blond head like the sun around which all the others are swirling. They spin away and glide back, joining in the delicate and precise interplay. All the immensity and complexity of the universe distilled down into this ballet.
At the back of the file is a picture of the young girl in question; Kali Prasad Singh,
… You will see her again.” The figure steps forward with its hand stretched out in a placating gesture. Its voice is deep, certain and soothing as it rolls over Billy. “Things go on. And then, her time will come and she will join you. Others watch over her.”
“You want to know what I was like when I was a lad?” John’s eyebrows raise. “I’m surprised you haven’t somehow deduced that already,” he says with a spark of humour in his eyes.
There's a surge of something warm in John's chest and it makes his thoughts feel fuzzy on the edges. Somehow, that simple gesture and the accompanying look, make him feel…
"Sherlock?"
“Um... There’s quite a bit.” He tries to laugh. It comes out tight; nervous and ashamed. He rubs at his ear. “Are you.. um... wanting... a play-by-play, full accounting, then?”
hands are wrapped around his prick.
A tear, crystalline and shimmering, is clinging to her jaw. It relinquishes its hold and slowly slices through the air. When it splashes into her cup, the entity snaps back to the operating theatre before Henry can look up.

Don't be dull, John. I don’t have the time nor the patience for your imbecilic, guilt-ridden, sexual identity crisis. Obviously, it was
I think dryly. I look him over for a half moment, weighing my options. I'm unsure how much he knows about my sudden financial strife and I'm not sure how much he cares to know. I lift my chin, settling into quiet defiance.
Sherlock blinks up at him, wide-eyed with shock. John nods and then his eyes move down Sherlock's body as he wets his lips. That look in his eyes is even more devastating than Sherlock ever imagined; determined and hungry with just a hint of something sultry and mischievous.
It’s only when I see the rare flicker of tension in her face, and note how she's shifted back in her seat with a wary stare fixed on me that I become aware of just how viciously I've reacted. The sound of my roar is still echoing in the room, I am gripping the arms of the chair tightly and leaning forward, practically snarling at her.
“Is he-”
“Your body clearly indicated that - what you wanted was - it was
She flutters her hand in the air as if to bat away my silliness and continues gathering up abandoned dishes. "Not with the
Generally when John noted that a man was attractive it was only in that slightly irritated or perhaps envious way that one notes things they wished they had been fortunate enough to be genetically allotted. He supposed it was just some primal sizing up of the competition. John’s thoughts had run squarely along those lines the first time he saw Sherlock.
trusted Sherlock at the time. There had been a look in the consulting detective's eyes; a deep burning intelligence and the ability to ask the right question, that one just hovering in the back of her own subconscious but not quite breaking through. He had solved the case in a dramatic, adrenaline-fueled rush, sparking and igniting everyone around him and drawing in power from John, Lestrade, Molly and,
“What is it?” A deep baritone voice growls from within the room and before John has time to realise that
We hoped you enjoyed the journey as much as we have enjoyed the learning experience of writing together!
Sherlock shifts back and blinks around, his mind running over John’s final words and trying to decipher it.

John pauses and just looks at him a moment. Then he lets out a soft breath. “Gorgeous
in a voice that was broken and vulnerable, so alien to the typically cool, calm and apathetic man, John felt his objections ground away. He didn’t want his friend to suffer alone.
I look over at Sherlock, confused that he isn't pouncing at the chance to demonstrate his cleverness and skill. If anyone deserves to be ripped to pieces by his brilliant insights, it is this pompous, self-righteous prick who requested Sherlock's help only to manhandle him and treat him to non-stop attempts at insults, humiliation and degradation.
"Yes. And?"
. Not with the right person and not when you love and care for each other. It's beautiful and wonderful and just… really,
John knew that this moment would be forever burned into his mind. The image of Sherlock, usually so cool, placid and self-assured clutching himself protectively in a trembling heap of limbs, a single quaking hand cast up in the space between them as harsh words of rebuke spilled from his flushed and quivering lips. Fuel for new horrific nightmares.
“I think your clothes were taken due to a significant amount of
“Coming in, then?” The woman drawls, gesturing at the seat across from herself.
"John?" His voice is heavy with confusion. He must have at last turned and looked for John, wondering why he hadn't taken his usual place at Sherlock's side.
After all his efforts, he stands before his wardrobe; dressed and groomed, precisely as if it is any other day. Yet, he finds himself staring at a reflection that is alien - unrecognisable to himself. He glares into the reflection's eyes, shining bright with the ember of something new and a little wild. He wonders if the act of seeing can change the observer, as being observed has been scientifically proven to change that which is observed.

____________________________________
Unsure where I am, but determined to put as much distance as possible between Mycroft and I, I shove my hands in my coat pocket and start off in the direction that Mycroft's car had transported me from. I keep my head down and my shoulders hunched against the damp, walking briskly. As I scan the street for an entrance to the Tube, the whole odd and unsettling encounter with Mycroft runs circles in my brain. My instincts tell me there's something more to it; some purpose or truth hidden beneath the surface and only glimpsed in the gaps. My fingers flex inside my pockets, longing for the comfort of my gun, though it will be of no help in this situation.
"What do you want, John?" His voice is low, cold and clear; cutting right to the heart of the matter. He stares up at John with eyes naked with confusion and hurt as raw as the moment when John had fled, but now anger has joined that volatile cocktail. It weighs on John once again how all his efforts to prepare for their reunion have been thwarted with incredible efficiency. He seems personally doomed to get everything to do with Sherlock impressively wrong, like he's the very definition of
John's thumbs are making small circles against the thin skin on the inside of Sherlock's wrists that are pinned between them, reminding Sherlock how much John is in control of this moment.
This part is familiar; the devastation as reality crashes back in.
John's blue eyes going dark and simmering with rage. His jaw and fists clenching.
Everyone does.
His mouth pulls down in a frown as he wonders what could be the differentiating factor between this fight and every other experience. He has fought in close physical contact many times, with a variety of people, and never had any arousal. He has had a multitude of experiences with John that have not evoked arousal either. His initial reaction had not been
Watson sits straight up, hands scrambling at nothing, confusion swirling in his brain and fear pounding in his chest. His body is damp with sweat and he has the oddly terrifing impression that it was his body landing on the bed, as if dropped from a great height, that awoke him.
” Sherlock says waving his hand dismissively. The disdain for John’s first choice of information for disclosure is obvious in the downturn of his lips and the exaggerated crinkle of his nose.
is going to stick around."
He grips Sherlock's hand and whilst Sherlock tries to keep his arm stiff, the man pushes forward and leans into Sherlock's space encasing the seized hand in both of his own.
” the stranger agrees, “Arrhythmia.”
“It’s obvious where the primary culpability lies…”
"There’s little use in pretending, I know who you’ve been with and it's not difficult to deduce what you’ve been up to." He pops the last two words like small explosives. He's shockingly angry; eyes cold and lips curled up around his teeth like he's ready to bite.
Sherlock struggles to find an answer that will not betray his jumble of conflicting emotions about the prospect of John making love to him.
"You look awful," he says at last. I scoff. He's hardly one to talk. He's wearing the same suit as yesterday. I'd wager that he hasn't slept a wink.
Sleep did not come easily but when it did it was with images of Sherlock dancing behind his eyelids;
John's shoulders drop immediately once he's inside. Not only is it comfortably warm and dry but the plush seats and the rich smell of leather, wood, and roses envelopes him. This car is more chic and luxurious than anything John has ever been in before. He can’t help but look around with awe. All the expensive materials and refined details speak of quality that only a disgusting amount of money can buy. When his gaze drifts back around to the woman, her smile is slow and knowing.
the arrogant bastard I know and-”
“Sir William’s office – the bank’s former Chairman. The room’s been left here like a sort of memorial. Someone broke in late last night,” he says peering into the glass panels of the office.
” John turns his head into Sherlock’s neck and his mouth is right by Sherlock’s ear. His familiar scent fills John up, curling through him like warm smoke. He was unaware he had been missing that so deeply. John’s lips barely brush against warm flesh. A small sound escapes his chest; pain and want. Sherlock shivers and melts a little into him.
John lifts his gaze to Sherlock’s neck and then drags it back to his eyes. His blunt tongue does a sweep of his lips and he clears his throat, lifting one eyebrow.

“Yes, did do
“We haven’t finished talking.”

Sherlock huffs, “I’m fine, John. I wasn't
"No, I'm not saying-" John takes a deep breath and eases back onto his heels putting his hands up in a placating gesture. He hadn't meant to put Sherlock on the defensive for being aroused. "It's fine, Sherlock. That's all fine."
The first time?
He can feel a wet patch forming near John’s tip. He whimpers in spite of his efforts to stay silent. He runs his fingers through the dampness and quickly touches it to his lips; tasting cotton and John’s essence. The flesh of John’s neck is growing tacky with sweat beneath Sherlock’s cheek. He barely restrains the urge to lick that too; taste him with sex and adrenaline in his pores.
“Why?” Donovan goads.
Sherlock risks a look at John across the darkness. He is softly running his fingers back and forth over his lips. He lifts his thoughtful gaze and catches Sherlock's stare.
A sensation of warmth unfurls in Sherlock’s chest. He sighs and relaxes into his body's positive response a moment before allowing himself to push further. He turns his head into John's neck and inhales his unique scent and lets his mind move slowly towards the idea of a less chaste touch.
Sherlock freezes, every muscle taut, hands cast out, as if the calm this situation demands is something tangible, fluttering at the edges of his grasp; a butterfly he can wait to alight and then pounce upon.
want to tangle with.
"I'm curious." John does a half-hearted shrug. That strange smile hasn't left his face and Sherlock hates it - it makes him feel as if he's missed something or there's something he should be anticipating but can't.
"It's good to see you, John. It's been a while." I appreciate that she doesn't lie and say that I
“I’m here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
It is the most I can do.”
"Possibly. I do go there on occasion."
John lifts up the blankets to assess the rest of his body for injury. He finds that he is completely naked and he quickly lowers it back down. He'd expected the need to go shirtless with the location of the wound but not to be stripped of everything.
John purses his lips and clenches his jaw. He's, of course, accustomed to Sherlock's biting pronouncements telling everyone to ‘shut up’ when their idiotic babble is inconsequential. However, he obviously isn't going to back down this time. He gives a tight shake of his head back and forth and his voice lowers the strain behind the calm is obvious to Sherlock in how slow and carefully he is speaking.
Victor never sees John coming. John smashes into him like a battering ram and Victor goes flying sideways into the heap of trash. John is on him instantly; knees in his chest and fists pummeling relentlessly; blind with rage as bones crack and flesh breaks under blow after blow.
He doesn't respond but, from my position behind him on the escalator, I can tell that he is grinning. There's something almost coy about his expression. He tips his chin down to his chest and I notice that he is breathing heavier; a sudden anticipation and tension threaded through him.
John is done with that.
Everything in the room stands still as they stare at each other. Captain Watson is covered in blood, wrist deep in the young soldier's chest, hand cupping the broken heart and trembling with emotion.
A muscular shoulder pressed against cheek, sustaining head against warped gravity.
"Just… you know…
Considerably less shaken, he turns a critical eye to his own chest and arms, examining himself in the full length mirror on the wardrobe door.
"May I observe something?" She asks.
Sherlock scrutinises him, sharp eyes darting over his features as if he can read all John's intentions if he just looks hard enough. John half fears he can. If there was ever a time for the universe to give him a good turn, this is it. He just needs Sherlock to give him a chance.
"Don't know, -
“Christ, was it me?" His voice is so heavy with despair, that Sherlock feels it as a weight in his own chest. The spinning, pushing, pulling of that connection is agony. "What  - what did I do, Sherlock? Did I-”
I’ve been itching for a fight for days and this will do me.
“Go on, then. Show me what you like.”
“I called.”
is holding the broken bodies of babies and children - victims of stray bullets, or missiles, or bombs - as their families wail with horror and grief.
"Yes and I can identify a rugby player by the calluses on his left hand and brief physical contact with his musculature," he says stiffly without looking up. His skin is flushing even hotter at the memory of blurting out that deduction when John's hand caressed his cheek. He tightens his jaw and forces the air slowly in and out of his constricting chest. He diverts his eyes to the window and tries to focus on the city zipping by. They must be getting close now. This cab ride has taken a small eternity. This is torture.
He is deep in thought, and automatically going through the motions, when they trudge through the door of 221B. He hardly manages to remove his coat and scarf and toe off his shoes before John is pushing him to the couch.
“Amazing,” he breathes, his voice dropping to that low rasp. Sherlock instantly stiffens.
The soldiers move away to unload more casualties and Watson is left with the thrashing young soldier he has taken as his personal charge since he threw the Private over his shoulder and carried him out of the line of fire.
"Precisely." Sherlock shoves his mobile into his pocket as if he's proven his point and the case is closed. "
"Are you… er…is this..." He doesn't have the wherewithal to finish that sentence.
Looking down to see the contrast of John's hands gently and tenderly moving down pale chest, over ribs, down stomach -
Admittedly, John had gone to bed last night trying desperately
why should I feel a need to refrain from reading the file of a case he's abandoned.
They both know that the tension between them has reached a breaking point.
“Two trips around the world this month,” I remark, “You didn’t ask his secretary; you said that just to irritate him.” I infuse my voice with teasing and conspiratorial notes. I want to give him the chance (that Sebastian denied him) to reveal how he'd worked it all out. I can tell he enjoys that bit and, frankly, I do too.
_______________________
at least. Sherlock straightens his spine, and clasps his hands behind his back. He looks past her to the building beyond.
Victor has done to me. I deserve a whole lot more too. You have my confession. So let’s just get this over with. Send me to prison. I should have been sent there two years ago. We’ve only been delaying the inevitable.” He puts his purple and yellow splotched wrists together and shoves them forward across the table to be cuffed. His eyes are gleaming, fierce and bright. His bruised and swelled features give him the haunting look of a vicious animal, cornered.
“Well, I have somethin’ for ya.” Donovan takes a note from her pocket and holds it out. She lets Sherlock come to her. He takes it carefully and she pauses, staring up at him, her dark brown eyes searching, as if trying to puzzle something out.
Watson shakes himself, glancing around as he marches to the second bed and picks up the chart. Cold chills run down his spine as he realises the numbers match those in his dream.
Sherlock looks over his shoulder at him and lifts an eyebrow. "She's a dominatrix, John. Recreational scolding is her specialty." He returns to his inspection of the photo, now pointedly spreading his entire palm on John's pillow.
I sniff and stare straight at her for a moment before I give in with a stilted nod. Suppose we've got to face it if there's any hope to solve this.
Irritated to the point of wanting to throttle him, I manage to get into the building with a bit of my own charm, by slipping in with a woman on her way to her own flat and casually chatting her up.
“Why?” John presses.
“Stop bullshitting and tell me the truth. Have you been physically intimate with another human before last night? Am I your first? ”
Lestrade has moved to the same position he was in as John examined the body; arms folded over his chest, leaning back against the wall. Sherlock picks up the note and reads it.
Sherlock’s head swirls with a sudden shift in perspective. Before the day Irene drugged him he never would have believed that John liked him in
The soldier on the gurney is a boy, really, maybe nineteen, with no threat of stubble on his smooth, desert-sun freckled face. He reaches out his dirt and blood encrusted hand towards the figure as they pass and it lifts its thin, white hand in reply. Fingertips nearly touch but, before their hands can meet, Captain Watson steps forward and firmly grasps the soldier's outstretched hand in his own.
The hammer clicked.
Then slowly it transformed. The thing he was measuring became hot flesh and smooth skin. He realized it was Sherlock and his mind struggled to graft his previous endeavor onto this new canvas.
He straightens his spine, slides into his coat and scarf and faces the day with the solemn determination of a soldier marching into battle.
“John,” he whispers. His eyes latch onto John like a lifeline.
Wane shafts of London light creep around the wooden scrollwork of the three high windows, casting rays over the mahogany bookcases and thick persian rug of the Diogenes Club’s Stranger’s Room. A muted beam catches the profile of Mycroft Holmes as he sniffs his sharp nose, tips his chin up slightly and narrows his eyes at the figure briskly pacing before him; hands clasped behind the back and long coat snapping at calves with each quick pivot.
"Who’s this?” Donovan’s head tilts to the side as her eyes narrow on John.
"Step out of them," John instructs.
Yet, no matter how much John tried to rationalize that persistent hunger out of existence, the feelings had only intensified with every mind-blowing deduction, every adrenaline-fueled chase across rooftops and every quiet, scotch-tinted evening sitting by the fire exchanging stories and witty banter with the marvel of a man. That fierce desire for
“Alright then. Get on with it.”
"So, what?" Sherlock can see Sargent Donovan straight ahead standing by the police tape. He's locked in on her like a missle.
Sherlock’s body, like his brain, is an oddity. By acceptable standards of attractiveness he considers he is far too lean and gaunt and, with his pallid skin, he can hardly be taken as a model of health and well-being. His height provides him some advantage; useful for intimidation. However, he must acknowledge that many of his features are more valued among the fairer gender; prominent cheekbones, above average lip volume and facial feature symmetry. Sherlock knows himself lacking in the more masculine features of a broad forehead, prominent chin and brow and chiseled jaw.
"I’m a friend of many.” She leans towards him and her voice drops to become more intimate and teasing. “And you, John Watson, seem like a man in need of a friend." A devilish grin settles on her lips that makes the hairs stand up on the back of John’s neck and alarm bells go off on the back of his brain. The look in her eyes right now reminds him of Mary in some respects; cold and possessive.
“I said go, John.” He remains focused on Victor. “He’s not dead but he will have to go to hospital. I don’t think he had time to see you. I can argue self-defense. He won’t press charges against

“Sherlock?” John takes a cautious step towards him, hand outstretched. He wants so badly to touch Sherlock; to fold him into the sanctuary of his arms, to take him home and tend his wounds with the gentle tenderness he deserves... show him at last what it is to be
"Whoa. Hey. Nope." John rises quickly and has him by both shoulders. He is pulling him to his feet. "Gotta warm you up right. Trousers now."
John stands there, shifting nervously from foot to foot, eyeing his phone and every car that slows at the intersection. He blinks in surprise when a sleek black car with tinted windows rolls up beside him and an attractive woman steps out of the driver seat. She moves around and opens the back door,  looking directly at him the entire time.
I stare him square in the eyes, with a grin spreading over my lips.
"No. No. Wait!" I violently shove him away so I can sit up. My head is swimming like I'm more than half drunk. I am breathing heavily. Everything is throbbing in time with my rock hard prick. I ache. Every fibre aches. I can't make my scattered thoughts assemble. I need to pull this thing back from the edge it's teetering on.
"Sorry, but what's
… just a
for a case. He didn’t even seem to pleasure himself from any indication John would typically have of such things. Though he supposed that it was ridiculous to assume that Sherlock didn’t do anything related to sex just because of a lack of evidence. If anyone was capable of being discreet and covering up evidence it should be the world’s only consulting detective.
To fulfill whatever desire that would
“Inhale,” the figure whispers as it materializes from the darkness to crouch in front of Captain Watson.
"So I surmised," Mycroft almost sneers at this, which makes me wonder how exactly Sherlock sent his
Ten seconds.
“That’s absurd. What happened - It wasn’t him and it’s not about hurting him. It never was-” Sherlock bristles.
“Well, good thing... I hear they have the bubonic plague,” John says with a smirk. Sherlock blinks then smiles back, relaxing a little with the comfortable warmth of companionship John offers.
“We're going to get you patched up, Private McDonnell.” As Watson crouches to lock the boy in a reassuring gaze he finds the young man's eyes wide with terror and awe. He is gazing over at an empty corner, his lips moving soundlessly in something like
The door buzzes again, making Sherlock jump, and Hopkins sighs and rises to walk to it. She chats with the man in the doorway quietly and then shakes her head and shuts the door behind him. She scratches at her eyebrow as she slowly returns to stand by the table.
Three men saved; only Private McDonnell was ultimately lost to his injuries. Tomorrow, the sun will rise over McDonnell's family home and then the call will come - that awful, dreaded call, and other hearts will rip to shreds, never to be made back whole again. Death doesn't just happen to the soldier, it's an explosion, the blast radius radiating out in rings of devastation, leaving a legion of walking wounded in its wake.
“Thanks, lov- Sherlock.”
"Oh!" She sucks in a breath as revelation lights her eyes. “It's
He had already made that mistake once, he did not intend to repeat it.
Sherlock lets his eyes drift open. He feels strangely peaceful and settled in his skin now. He picks up the tray of medical supplies.
“Rather be home anyways,” he says closing his eyes and settling back again. “Just going to rest a bit before we get evicted.... Try not to make trouble,” he mumbles his voice growing thick with the pull of sleep.
John sighs into his ear.
________________10________________
Sherlock."
A voice cuts through the haze.
John feels the familiar sting immediately, but he rolls over on top of Sherlock, covering him as he pulls up his British Army L9A1. In the space of a heartbeat he’s shot the gunman square between the eyes. The murdering bastard crumples into a pile on the floor. John holds him in his sights a few seconds longer before he lets out a long breath and collapses around Sherlock.
“Me?”
"Fine. I'll deduce it, then," he says at last with clear irritation. His eyes flick over John and his expression transforms into that sharply focused and analytical gaze he'd used when studying the corpse at the crime scene.
He has accepted it. John is John, Sherlock is Sherlock and what he feels and his friend does
“We’re done now,” I say, voice so low it is almost a growl and it is, without a doubt, a threat. Mycroft lets the silence hold; a show of power to remind me who is in control here.
Somewhere, deep within, there is a lush, dark room replete with every sensation Sherlock has ever been able to steal from John... but he
“Who?” Sherlock mumbles distractedly, watching John gesture tightly. There is a person obstructing Sherlock's view of John's full body and he wants to reach out and pluck her out of the way.
"You have questions." Sherlock says quieter and with deliberate calmness. He waves a hand through the air with forced casualness to indicate John should proceed. He continues to look straight ahead.
a very good hiding place.”
John jerks his chin towards the tray. “Eat,” he instructs. “It'll help.”
Sherlock makes a sound of frustration in the back of his throat. He taps his mobile, turns the screen towards John and thrusts it under John's nose. It takes a second for John's eyes to adjust to the brightness of the screen. A map comes into focus with a little blinking blue tracking dot right over John's dorm room. Up at the top of the screen it identifies who is being tracked.
After all, Sherlock made it clear from the beginning that he abhors sentiment.
That settles it. I can't walk around like
John is panting. His body is rocking into the touches and everything is moving with that rhythm. Can almost imagine...
Across the darkness a shimmery, iridescent vestige of John is leaning forward.
Sherlock is vaguely aware that she desperately wants them to stop looking at her, so he turns his eyes to stare at his own hands as he processes the information.
that would take everyone else with him.
They stare at each other a long moment as something heady passes between them. There's a shift in the air, like the world is letting out a held breath. Then Sherlock gives a small nod and he releases John's shirt as he turns his gaze back to the wound. “Tell me,” he demands softly.
This was a smutty one-shot that the reader prompting keeps driving forward.
... merely
“Don’t worry, you’re doing fine,” Sherlock says still a little breathless; parroting his response from back then. “Twenty minutes, John,” he adds, thinking the time limit will put the doctor’s mind at ease.
In the hallway Sherlock freezes in mid-stride. He throws a hand against the wall to steady himself and smooths his other hand down his bare chest and abdomen. The part of him that seems bound to John won't stop its relentless flailing about within him. The sensation of things shifting underneath his skin and writhing around in the hollows of his interior is no less disconcerting for its familiarity due to John’s uncanny ability to evoke it. There is a buzz running through his frame and a fission of anticipation bubbling in his chest. The closest thing he can associate it with is the intoxicating high when he realises that a formidable game of pursuit is revealing itself. He knows all his faculties will be tested but he is eager for the challenge.
... but I
"Right." With a nod I step forward and slide into the seat across from Mycroft. To my surprise, Artemis doesn't follow. She shuts the door behind me and I see her through the window leaning casually against the fence as we pull away. She's sucking on her lolli and looks just the way I'd found her, as if she's waiting to spring her next trap.
here.
communicate,” I say low and slow, as I look up at him from under my brow. “What's going on?”
Sherlock moves closer and, with his back nearly against his own silhouette on the wall, he discovers the optical illusion Raz has created. In the same position as Sherlock had been that night, the image of John leaps into three dimensions and John appears as he was that night, staring at Sherlock. Sherlock’s breath catches and his heart pounds as John’s intense expression fixes on him. He lets his head bow, the emotions of that night tumbling over him and making his eyes burn. Then he pushes away from the wall and opens the note.
“That's not what your instincts are telling you.” The man's face is placid, almost serene in its lack of expression. Yet, his eyes are trained on John with the keenness of a falcon. “You've superb instincts. You should trust them more.”
there was the matter of
“Oh, Christ.” John breathes. “Sherlock.”
"No." He slams the door shut again. He looks down at himself. He's barefoot, in his threadbare pajama bottoms, and an old t-shirt.
John snaps back to the present when a thoughtful hum vibrates through the air of the too quiet bathroom and he feels a tentative touch to the center of his chest. He opens his eyes, looking down at the top of Sherlock's curly brown head, crouched at chest level and turned slightly to the side. A thin, elegant finger is gathering in the texture of the curly, sandy blond hairs on John's chest. John clears his throat. Sherlock quickly retracts his hand turning away to reach for the gauze tape.
Watson searches the shadows in front of him.
It's no small feat, however, four days later Sherlock has managed to effectively distract himself completely from John Watson. He has cloistered himself away in his dorm room and become happily engrossed in experimenting on the proffered liver that Molly provided him in exchange for tutoring her in organic chemistry.
“Whether I am ready or not, you've been more than fair,” Sherlock says with a slightly amused smile. John tilts his head in puzzlement; not missing the reference but failing to understand what Sherlock means.
" ... and neither does my boss," Sebastian interrupts with a stern edge. "I hired you to do a job. Don’t get

” he replies softly. Her face flickers with amusement before it crashes down into sadness with the heavy truth of that statement.
"Unsurprising," Sherlock mutters, turning towards the window and sinking into his coat; his collar offering a bit of protection to obscure his face from John's view.
“What?”

up for this sort of circular conversation first thing in the morning.
“Are you certain?” The figure tilts its head as if doubtful and Billy stops and nods, his expression going soft and wistful.
He might as well have scratched it into the floor with his dying breath. It spoke volumes, while saying

“Such fatuous creatures are these humans-” Mycroft's tone reflects his patronizing pity of both mankind and Sherlock.

He clung tighter, his body shivering against the shock of understanding his powerlessness. He tried to push back that dark cold flood of fear and doubt; to fight it and wrestle back control like he had every day since he lay beneath an unrelenting sky and felt his life blood draining into the thirsty desert sand, but it was resurging. There was a slowly creeping sense of awful knowing; a knowing in his bones that other human beings now had the power to destroy him. It was not in killing or hurting him where they would succeed, he’d never feared that, but it was by taking away the thing that made his life worth living; his purpose. No matter how vigilant or careful, no matter how brave he was or how hard he fought this too could be taken from him.

John's face does a complicated thing, warring between a precocious smile, guilt and embarrassment before it settles on a small, almost bashful grin. "I looked you up."
Bit kinky.” John is pressing fingers to his own lips again to hold in the giggles that are trying to escape.

“Don’t be coy John, it’s an insult to my intelligence." His expression turns fierce. He leans forward into my space; ferocious and challenging. "Of course he isn’t interested in
"Fine. Yeah. Good…" I force a wane smile, unable to stop from glancing up to the corner as I carefully weigh what I say. "Busy - I mean, I've moved. Living in London now and doing a bit of…

On the heels of that first revelation is the insight that he manipulated me into this position. He'd made the first move. The confrontation a moment ago; that irresistible enticement of danger and the challenge of overpowering him, had been a subversive strategy right out of his psychological game of seduction playbook that he'd used with me from the moment we met until the night I'd exploded inside him. He's telegraphing his moves and I’m naturally falling into that familiar battle rhythm.
Without really realizing he’d always been waiting for something, in that instant, like switching the lens and seeing the same thing made anew by powerful new optics, he could see his life in sharp focus and knew he

This time, Sherlock is certain he moves towards John; is gravitationally pulled, actually, needing more of John.
and the way there was a constant battle in their fervent encounters. It is all familiar, yet John is unique. Like a new flavour of chocolate with subtle variation that makes what is enjoyable even more appealing for its distinctness.
There’s too much on the line to be selfish and trust in this absurd impossibility.
“Nothing. Just left a little message.” Sebastian holds his security card against the reader by the door to unlock it, then leads the way towards the desk. He steps aside to let Sherlock get a better look. Hanging on the plain white wall behind the large desk is a framed painted portrait of a man in a suit; the late Sir William Shad himself, it appears. On the wall beginning to the left of the portrait and over the man’s eyes someone has sprayed what looks like a graffiti tag in yellow paint. The first part of the tag on the wall looks vaguely like a number 8 but with the top of the number sliced open, and above it is an almost horizontal straight line. Across the eyes of the portrait itself, another almost horizontal straight line has been sprayed. The yellow paint has run trails down the wall and over the painting from that indiscernible design.
"The girl seated at the table, then - Molly, I think is her name - she's a friend.”
"Artemis," she retorts, "Goddess of
"Too early. We're losing him," a voice suddenly says from the darkness around us. I turn towards the source and there is only the skull on the mantle. But, as I stare at it, its eye sockets become alight with a flickering blue flame; that light increasing to reveal the space more and more, like someone with a torch is approaching from inside the caverns of those sockets.
Sherlock opens his eyes and studies John’s sleeping face. He looks like his is concentrating intensely.
"Wait." John throws out a hand just when Sherlock reaches down to pick up the case. Sherlock scowls at him but John keeps the hand extended until he disappears into the loo. He returns with a bath towel in his hand. He spreads it out on the bed and hauls the case up onto it. Then he steps back, allowing Sherlock to proceed, as if this is all quite normal behaviour.
“Yeah, his numbers…” he glances back at the man, standing at the foot of the bed with his hands folded behind his back. “The numbers aren't looking right.” He reaches out and grasps the patient's wrist to take his pulse. The patient's skin is cool and tacky. “Probably just an error,” he mumbles as he stares at the clock and mentally counts the throb of the patient's heartbeat against his fingertips. However, there is a stirring in his gut telling him that there is something

Sherlock has joined him on the top landing now. He keeps a guarded distance between them as he searches the former DI’s face for the anger he expects him to harbor. He anticipates a punch and he is debating if he should dodge it or let the man get it out. He deserves it, after all. Lestrade just smiles at him warmly for a moment, then shakes his head.
Sherlock flops face down on his bed and immediately winces at the sharp objection of pain from a part of his anatomy he has done well to successfully ignore for years prior to a certain jumper-wearing, cabbie-shooting, ex-army Captain hobbling into his life. Now his insistent cock, pinned beneath himself and the bed, reminds him of just how dangerously desperate and desirous he has become. He grips the sheets in both hands and growls in frustration into the mattress, clenching all his muscles tight and breathing harshly,

"Idiot. Idiot. Idiot," Sherlock mutters as he proceeds to pull a pair of tailored trousers that match his suit jacket from his wardrobe.
Sherlock sniffs in a sharp breath through his nose and tries to turn his head to look at John and discern what he's saying. John sits up a little to allow him. He can just barely manage to see a bit of John's face. He is smiling warmly.
, John. As ever, you
Sherlock's eyes snap open, alarm hardening into anger at being denied.
“Ok. So you've found one word,” John laughs. He is panting and starting to perspire from wrestling with his surprisingly unwieldy companion down the first flight of stairs. He props the wobbly detective against the wall at the first landing a moment. Sherlock's large, silver eyes are blinking slowly and trying to focus on John's face.
, at this rate." she coos, shooting a devious look over her shoulder at them and throwing him a wink.
“You kissed me.” It is a petulant accusation. Sherlock really can’t be expected to hold back the floodgates when John said he ‘didn’t want to wait’ and kissed him.
or treated him like something so precious.
… on with it then.” Sherlock’s voice embodies the most casual of interest but he can't focus on anything on the screen before him. He blinks several times to bring it into focus and finds that his subconscious has decided to look up the average neck size of males in the UK.
... and myself.” She doesn't elaborate. She's already focused on her mobile.
Five weeks have passed since that first innocuous experiment and two since John’s aborted blanket attempt.
Victor is a mess. His face is swathed with bandages and a metal contraption has his jaw wired shut. The way his purple-ringed eyes widen and he squirms slightly upon seeing Sherlock makes something like satisfaction curl inside Sherlock, straightening his spine a little.
This place; the bedsit, the emotional devastation, it is all so uncomfortably familiar. This is the inescapable cycle of his life. The wheel makes another turn back to those days before he met Sherlock or those days when he thought Sherlock was dead.
John hunches his shoulders and turns up his coat collar against the brisk night air. Shoving his hands in his pockets, he shuffles quickly along the pavement, tipping his chin down to hide the pained grimace creasing his face. His eyes scan the shadows; knowing he won't find what he is seeking there, but he is unable to stifle the need to try. The hair standing up on the back of his neck and the gooseflesh raised along his sides have nothing to do with the wet chill in the air.
"Your pupils are dilated. Face flushed. Signs of stress."
But there is something he has to do and this will work to his advantage.
John stands on a tarmac. Behind him a small, personal jet is taking off.
In the light of this new day, having been nourished by love and stripped bear by the gauntlet of truth, he feels reborn; ready to face the promises John had lain before him.
They know where I live (arranged it, in fact)… and, come to think of it, I'm not especially eager to get home and face Sherlock (since Ella was of no help).
for so long. Something undefinable until the moment when John came through that door and he instinctively knew the ex-army doctor was everything he had never really expected to find.
As John looks up, their eyes meet for just a second before Sherlock focuses on John’s hands. “May I?” Sherlock’s voice is hesitant; quiet  and a deep rumbling in the space between them, like the logs shifting in the fire. John nods and slowly shifts forward in his chair.

- as an insult. John sighs and frowns slightly as he looks towards the fireplace. The air in the room feels heavier and colder as Sherlock presses his lips together hard and mentally curses his lack of verbal filters.
“I thought you'd gone, and my Mind Palace is all dark and I can't find your room, and you won't come when I call -” Sherlock rambles against John's neck.
The young man opens his mouth and instead of words the sharp blare of a heart monitor alert goes off. John jolts and finds himself sitting back at the administration desk, the room quiet around him. Disorientated, he scrambles to his feet and looks around.
"Whoa.. um.." John steps back but Sherlock's hand darts out to grasp his ankle and hold him in place. "Um. Ok…" John mumbles, heat beginning to crawl from his chest to his cheeks. His heart is pounding. Sherlock is pushing up the cuff of his pajama bottoms to examine his ankles.
I shift and settle into a wider stance, stable enough to dodge or throw a punch. I tip my chin down so I can watch the other two in my peripheral... but, Mr.

but a gunshot wound nevertheless.” Sherlock’s tone is imperious but he shifts a little to hold John tighter. They stay intertwined together for long moments until John feels the darkness creeping over his vision; the coldness slowly taking him over. He is frozen to the ground and can't move or breathe well. The need to drift off to sleep feels irresistible.
She laughs and it actually seems genuine this time; for herself rather than for show. “Yes, that sounds like something he’d say.” John is a bit thrown off by the distant look of respect and something nearing exasperated affection that's taken over her expression. She turns her eyes on him with careful consideration.

Henry's smirk is lopsided and his eyes are sad but determined. “Never.” He shakes his head back and forth. “But if I don't tell her - if I never take that chance - I won't be able to rest in peace no matter what comes in the great hereafter.”
"I'll keep it as well."
John’s head whips up and he stares at Sherlock in awe and horror. Sherlock's head is hung, his dark, curly hair falling down over his eyes. He looks so young - small and defeated.
"Dinner?"
mistakes. He finally lifts his head and slides out of the booth. He tosses a large bill onto the table;
“Are you speaking to me?”
It hurts.
“Sorry, what?” John’s anger falls away into confusion, his brow furrowing. He adjusts his stance. “I’m sorry but weren’t we about to have a row?”
His mind makes the circle
You make me hurt you, you know? It’s like you want to piss me off. You know how it makes me. Yet, you
No one had been more surprised and humbled than John at the depth of that instant, unspoken trust that formed between he and Sherlock. Furthermore, John was aware that he was Sherlock’s

On the edge of consciousness, thoughts running thick like honey, the shadows of the room begin to slowly collect until a dark, wispy form in the vague shape of a man looms over Watson's bed. A weight pressing on the center of his chest, like a hand, and he can't move. He struggles to understand this shape and to discern its substance and features.
“With you on top of me... it most certainly
“Wait…
Instead, I throw open the door and trudge up the stairs, fully expecting Sherlock to be seated in his chair, off in his Mind Palace and refusing to speak to me once again.
“This is not the first, Sherlock. That makes four over the last three months.” Mycroft sits back, eyeing Sherlock sharply. “One or even two can pass unnoticed, put down to circumstance, but four is a clear pattern and one must ask, what is the distinguishing factor? The common variable?” Mycroft pauses, taking up his tea cup from the saucer. He hovers it before his lips, watching Sherlock over its rim.
“Don’t tease me,” Sherlock warns. “You have no idea, John...
The look you gave me when I stepped out and started saying those vile words he was whispering in my ear, I thought you would never trust me again. I felt like I should have done more to keep you from ever seeing that, feeling that way. You trusted me. I always felt honoured that you trusted me. I always trusted you implicitly as well.

He thinks he can feel it starting to curl around his heart.
"Nothing...
… when you're on top of me.”
“Wait a goddamn minute-”
“No." His tone has a sharp edge of irritation over the air of flat disinterest. "Molly is a mutually beneficial acquaintance. We barter; exchange favours for goods and services." His tone goes flatter. "Most of my associations fall within this realm."
“Everyone has friends.”
Besides, I’m not particularly fond of the idea of him seeing Sebastian alone.
“Stress and pain will do that to ya.” John’s hands tighten momentarily where they are steadying him on his waist, then relax. It’s just a brief, reassuring, squeeze but it makes warm, liquid heat flood through Sherlock and settle into his bones. He’s flushed all over now but some of the tension drains out of him.
He quietly slipped back into the sitting room and stood gazing down at his softly sleeping companion.
John narrows his eyes. "Why would you help me?"
What the fuck?
"Who’d wanna kill him?" I press.
He can taste John on his lips, feel the inside of his thighs pressing into John. His hands are gentle and warm and he is so very afraid to hope - afraid his imagination is misinterpreting the information, skewing it to reflect his own desires. Sherlock shakes his head back and forth, gritting his teeth to keep in the words pressing against the back of them from escaping.
He considers her with pursed lips for a moment. "Your greatest enemy, according to him."
“Alright. To your feet.” He wraps Sherlock's long arm around his own neck and holds on to it. He uses the thrust of his legs and the leverage of his shoulders to pull Sherlock to his feet. The drugged man makes a choked whimper.
Sherlock's eyes sweep back up over John slowly and then he gives a small shake of his head back and forth.
In this moment, Sherlock knows he is so fucked. There is no possible way he is going to survive this. This is an invasion and Captain John Watson takes no prisoners.
John turns and runs. He doesn’t stop running until he is all the way back to his bedsit. He slams the door behind himself and collapses onto his knees in the doorway. He just kneels there with his head hung in defeat.
“I ha’en’t much to say. I speak through my artwork mostly. But did want you to know, it means somethin’ that you always appreciated my work… And you’ve been good to the homeless network... seen we’re worth something…
“I’ll go make some scones for you boys," She turns and begins a careful decent down the stairs. "Sherlock’s bound to be hungry once he’s solved it. Always such
"I'm curious, why would a star rugby player need to reach out to his controlling ex-girlfriend who he's been desperately trying to escape? Why does he have no one else to turn to in his hour of need?" She pauses and there's a expertly measured cruelty to her dry and dispassionate look and her cutting words. "Is it perhaps because he's surrounded by friends but still determined to be alone?" She is near expressionless, other than the lift of single eyebrow at him that seems to demand a response.
“Speaking of which,” John awkwardly continues Sherlock’s thought. He rounds the wall and takes the grocery bags into the kitchen. “I believe I was to share a fact
Sherlock tries to catalog the sudden onslaught of sensations. The curling of that searing, hot serpent tangling itself through his muscles, around bones and squeezing vital organs. Things shattering and hemorrhaging from the pressure. Heat eviscerating his insides, the chemical cascade confusing pain for pleasure, sending little electric shocks radiating through him. Tension in muscles he'd forgotten he had as his body tries to contain the damage. Swelling as blood pools form in his lower half from what must be internal bleeding. Blood rushing away from the brain so fast that his vision is going gray.
Hopkins looks down and keeps her voice deliberately even and calm.

My mind returns to that image burned in my brain of Sebastian disparaging him over his skill. Though all vulnerability had been immediately shielded by a familiar, cold mask of indifference, I can't deny that the flicker of pain in his eyes inspires a fierce, irrational protectiveness in me. I want to counteract the sting of Sebastian's insults and to take the potency out of whatever backhanded, degrading methods of seduction he is trying to use on Sherlock. I lean closer, my mouth just behind his ear and my voice pitched lower.
"I just  - I mean to say that I didn't want to take advantage-"
“Don't." Sherlock steels himself and makes his tone cold and slicing. "I've told you already to call me Sherlock, and I haven't been kissing

What if the truth lies in those little cracks of vulnerability and those flashes of raw and beautiful humanity that drew me to him on that first day? What if the hungry way he looks at me sometimes, and what happened between us that first night, and what he said on the sidewalk in front of Seb's club haven't been games or attempts to use or deceive me, but him letting his mask slip. What if,

before he somehow ended up on the floor.
“I want you to know I will take it under careful consideration,” Sherlock concludes stiffly, his eyes wide with alarm at the gravity of his own words.
John took a deep breath, closed his eyes and surrendered to his fate.
He leaves the lights off.

and find that my credit card is suddenly 'not authorised.’
It is not so easy to adjust to this new awareness of himself. He is, at first, possessed with an absurd amount of paranoia. Thinking the truth must be as obvious as it feels, he attempts to avoid people altogether. It becomes increasingly difficult as the day wears on and he is forced into proximity with his peers. He tries to avoid being noticed. Every time someone catches his eye or opens their mouth to speak, he is certain it is to expose him.
I watch Sebastian watching Sherlock who is intensely focused on the graffiti. My hands ball into fists at my sides as my thoughts stray to dark and sharp-edged; images of Sebastian forcing his way into Sherlock’s space, enveloping his hand with both his own, gripping Sherlock’s arm, digging his fingers in and repeatedly thrusting his tongue against the inside of his cheek as he talked, creating a suggestive bulge. It seemed like... well..

but that is not exactly true. There is Hopkins and she seems to be in his corner. She’d stayed true to her word and given him some work once he’d seen to himself. She’d even managed to get Victor on drug possession with intent to distribute, and got Sherlock involved in a domestic abuse support group. He found that he missed being around people so he didn’t talk much, just listened, and didn’t mention any of the things he deduced about them.
"Hey, hey!" John steps towards Sherlock, as if to stop him. When Sherlock looks up sharply, pinning him with a glare, he freezes, lifting his still raised hands a little higher as if to show he means no harm. "Listen, Sherlock... I just wanted to
He is a dark storm of fury as he sweeps through the flat and marches up the stairs to John’s bedroom.
The early morning light is sickly, promising another rainy day. Everything is washed out in shades of gray which makes it especially difficult to discern one particular wisp of a man in a long dark coat. John hits his stride as he mauls over Greg's warning.
Just as the figure makes up its mind to take this risk, the door on the landing above them flies open and they both startle at the jarring noise.
I expect him to continue - to tell me whatever it is that he finds important enough to break in on me at this ungodly hour, but after a few moments of silence, I look up again and find Sherlock is staring at the bed with a distant expression.
The sirens are close; a block away maybe.
"My last patient should be done by 4. Come back then and I'll interview you for the job."
“Just tell the truth. You’re afraid I'm going to tell someone.” Sherlock feels himself plummeting with each awkward, fumbling, piteous excuse from John's mouth. He is sick with it. Sick with the thought of how John must see that night; some dreadful, regretful, mistake. Sick with how John must see Sherlock; some undesirable, inexperienced and incompetent victim of his drunken revelry. Sick with how John is taking this sacred thing and contorting it - perverting it by attaching his own ugly meaning to it.
"John-"

“Yeah. I thought so too.”
“Right.” I bite down on the urge to curse him out and instead tuck my gun in the back of my waistband, covering it with my jumper.

“What do you really want, Sherlock?” John's body presses into Sherlock, moulding around him. It is warmth and pressure and Sherlock's every nerve is a live sparkler of fizzing, crackling heat suffusing his insides. Sherlock's entire body is alight and he aware of every sensation, every brush of flesh or fabric like all his skin is suddenly an erogenous zone. It makes a humiliating sound, like a choked whimper, slip out of Sherlock. John definitely has his full attention now.
Sherlock leaps up over the bench, startling Molly back into her seat in his haste to get away. He bursts through the side door, skids down the hall, flies up the staircase, and doesn't stop until he's in the little lab behind the offices on the third floor that no one ever uses, aside from himself.
The room is suffocating. Airless. Watson slowly draws his hand away, braces himself with his fists against the cold metal table and hangs his head. “He's gone,” he mutters down at the table, shock and pain edging into his tone.
Meanwhile, Sherlock has continued right on with talking and inspecting John's things.

Sherlock's cool fingers go to work probing at the angry flesh around the wound to try to determine the severity beneath all that blood. John draws in a deep, hissing breath between his clenched teeth as pain shoots through him and his vision swims.

Fear screams on all my nerves as if I'd awoken to gunfire and bombs exploding.
All of these are equally terrifying, which is why Sherlock spent the last month and a half (when he was supposed to be
There's a click of the switch and John rubs his eyes at the shock of light flooding from the smaller room. Then there’s the rapid-fire clacking of plastic rings sliding over the metal bar as the shower curtain is yanked back.
His voice rumbles in his chest.
John notices a small bandage on his forehead just below his hairline and that his shirt is still the one from the warehouse. It is torn all along the bottom, from when he made the bandage, giving him the disheveled appearance of some washed out stockbroker reduced to begging. The dark burgundy stain over the left side of his chest is a mirror to John’s own wound, a stinging reminder of those desperate and yet somehow glorious moments when they had clung to each other in the cold and dark. In that moment he could almost have believe Sherlock loved him back.
He convinced himself that if Sherlock was not going to come to him it was better to let his gunshot wound fully heal before forcing the issue and seeking him out. After all, he wanted Sherlock to see him healthy. Given what Sherlock must be going through in grieving Mycroft, he didn’t want to inflict more emotional pain by showing up wounded.

“Right.” Andy bows his head again. There is a long silence and Sherlock feels like the air is too thin as he studies the pots, thinking about the subtle imperfections in them.
Lestrade laughs. “No one called you that
- and this rare moment of directness and honesty is about to slip away without me comprehending it
“Sherlock.” It is an inhaled breath; a gasp like a blow has landed to John's chest, and it pulls all the air out of the room. A pained expression washes away John's sternness. His eyes flick down to Sherlock's neck then up to meet his stare and, even though his pupils are dilated, consuming the dark blue of his iris, his expression has softened.
Flesh giving way as fist makes contact with John’s strong jaw.
the time, anyhow,”  he concludes. Sherlock scoffs, running a shaking hand through his tousled hair.
"It wasn't a bad childhood," Sherlock feels compelled to say as he carefully rolls towards him and shifts the covers higher. "They were the best minders money could buy. I spoke three languages fluently by age five and was a concert level violinist by age seven. I'm years ahead of my peers in my studies. In fact, all this, being here at University, it's just a formality, really. I know more about each of the subjects than the idiotic professors. I remain because it's something to do - gives me use of the labs and equipment."
He has never considered Sherlock to feel even remotely similar and could only imagine what sort of derisive thoughts he had on marriage in general. He is humbled by the potential of this unimaginable, mind-blowing, anomaly of a genius giving over so much to himself, an ordinary, unpolished, broken ex-soldier.
“Christ-” John gasps, breaking away. His chest is heaving against Sherlock's palm as he drags at the air in big gulps of breath. Sherlock’s seizes the opportunity to slide lips over John’s chin and nip at the line of his jaw, then throat. John makes a strangled sound, fingers flexing into the meat of Sherlock's shoulders.
John makes a sound in the back of his throat and it seems like acknowledgement of Sherlock’s shift in demeanor.
“Company's nice, Sherlock.” He beams at Sherlock. “B’sides I'mm comfortable,” he mumbles. He tucks his hands into his armpits, and wiggles a little, as if burrowing more comfortably against the floor.
Sherlock seems different. The set of his shoulders is all wrong, like a heavy weight has been hung around his neck. I only manage to catch his eye for a second as Sebastian leads us across the trading floor to the office of the bank’s former Chairman, Sir William, but there is a worrying undercurrent of sadness in his expression.
answered the question. “You can best please me by changing my bandage,” he snarks with a shrug.
“Aspiring doctor,” John says not taking his eyes off those exquisite lips.
“I think he did. Or I think
Sherlock freezes when he gets to the wall that had been in the video. They’d stopped there, breathless, leaning back and just looking at each other, chests heaving, hearts pumping, hands brushing.
Sherlock lets out a harsh, vaguely disgusted breath through his nose, and pushes past me to stride after her. I can't decide if I am imagining it or if he intentionally keeps his gangly form and large, fluttery coat positioned between me and the flirtatious secretary just to obstruct my view.
Released from John's gaze, Sherlock sucks in a breath and forces his gaze to the window. He sits up straighter and relief washes over him to see police lights ahead. As the cab slows, he shoves too much money at the cabbie and nearly leaps out of the still moving car, fleeing before John pries more out of him. Unfortunately, within a few steps, John is right beside him again.
It is so tempting to just relax into that embrace, to indulge another quiet fantasy of intimacy, but that is
Everything else falls away.
John sighs and rubs at his neck. "It's just… not the same, is it? Paying people to look after you isn't the same as being cared for by someone who actually wants to because they love you."
The room is spinning. His head sags forward and he feels himself sway from side to side and suddenly John is beside him, guiding him back to lay down on the couch. He is staring up as the doctor  hovers over him, filling all his vision. There is alarm in that expression. His lips are moving but Sherlock can't hear him over the thunder of his own heart. He can't move. His body is not his own.
He grins for a moment at the revelation, unable to contain the rush of affection for the brilliant but surprisingly idiotic genius. Euphoria swells in his chest and rushes in a warm wave out to the tips of fingers and toes. He exhales for what feels like the first time in months. As the wave passes and his mind clears and sharpens, he pulls his shoulders back a notch.
"You little-"
“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. No. Just-” Watson grabs at gauze and shoves it into the chest cavity as a wellspring of blood sluices around his fingers. Each pump spills more into the chest cavity. Even as he frantically pulls out the soaked cotton and rams in more, the other doctors and nurses begin to step back and go still, some dropping their heads and some turning away. All knowing the inevitable result of such a rupture in the heart.

"Up here." Once Lestrade is satisfied that John is properly suited he turns to lead the way. "What'd you say your name was?" He asks over his shoulder to John as they weave their way around the clusters of police milling about on the spiral staircase.
John leans in and Sherlock can feel John's arousal brush against his own; hard and surprisingly broad and long.
It's all so awfully unfair - the way John looks at him; the intensity, the attentiveness, the way those dark blue eyes always follow with an air of protectiveness and slight possessiveness. It's so easy to imagine
The unseen figure steps forward and leans in so that it and Captain Watson are nearly nose to nose. With a furrowed brow, it listens to the Captain’s tumbling thoughts as it studies his eyes. He is looking directly at it but not really seeing it. The spark of curiosity burns softly in the man's dark blue depths while the lines of worry and confusion crease the corners of his eyes.
” She says shakily as they embrace again. “Well I shan't do it again. Can't chase me away, for all the good in the world.” Sherlock buries his face in her small shoulder, breathing in that familiar scent, like cinnamon and apple rum. The world, his little part of it anyhow, does feel good.
It isn't exactly comfortable, against the cold, hard floor, but John feels that familiar, calming effect of the world narrowing down to him and Sherlock and the comfort of being able to hold onto the most important thing in his world. He slips his arms inside Sherlock's coat to firmly wrap his arms around Sherlock's lower chest. The heat is
Completely unaffected.
John lifts up off Sherlock and then warm palms are grasping Sherlock's bare thighs where the robe has bunched up to expose the back of his legs. John’s hold is firm and confident as he pushes Sherlock's legs apart and settles on the bed between Sherlock’s thighs.
It’s only then that I realise, with a shock, that I'm flirting with him. Perhaps no one else would typically think of my attempt to get him to share his deductions as a form of flirtation but I know, from what he'd said that first night on the couch (when he had interpreted all my behaviour leading up to that intimate moment), that he takes my enthusiasm for his skill as a territorial display; a way of declaring my interest and staking a claim. It doesn’t matter that that had never been my conscious intention, that is what it is now. It's an established code. Proceeding will be interpreted by him as a clear signal that I'm willing to recommence that twisted courtship dance from our first day together.
John clears his throat. He looks Sherlock over slowly. He is on his back on the couch beside John with his long, elegant body folded like oragami to allow enough room for John to have half a cushion to sit on the end. John saw the invitation in it and was more than willing to take the seat Sherlock obviously wanted him to. Even so, a few moments after John settled into this spot, Sherlock's bare toes managed to snake their way under his thigh.
. However, sometimes, when his mind is feeling particularly masochistic, the fantasy that unfolds is slow, deliberate and tender. This seems one of those rare times when his mind decides to torture him with the version of John that seduces him with a slow determination while exuding love and protectiveness. Sherlock begins to tremble. This type of night never fails to strip him bare and leave him emotionally shattered.
French phrase - means
Standing in the place where John first lay on the floor and staring at his mussed bed, he concludes that, logically, there is no value in dwelling on something that happened in the past. No amount of reflection and analysis will alter it. It is unlikely he will ever encounter John again, since their paths had never crossed previously. So, it is a closed matter that he must put aside and move on from.
He won't say it.
“Right. From the top then,” John says and chuckles softly. He looks up at Sherlock from under his brow and has the nerve to actually look embarrassed, eyes crinkling around the edges in a way that is probably meant to be disarming. Sherlock firmly reminds himself that it’s absolutely
“You know her?” He inquires.
I drag my eyes from the file up to his face. He is watching me with his head tilted back so, even in our relatively equal positions, he can look down his nose at me. It's
like a knee-jerk reflex. A latent self-defense mechanism, triggered by John drawing closer.
“You took time to call NSY but couldn't be bothered to buzz me in?”
flicker over his face but John quickly suppresses it.
The familiar sound of Sherlock’s voice, made strange with its raspy threads of want and desire, at last broke the spell over John. He stumbled backwards, his foot landing on the creaky board by the door, and both men’s eyes snapped towards him. John realized with a second wave of horror who the man was, Victor Trevor; one of the
“Meant to be viewed up close.” He turns and jogs away, his words trailing after him, “A commentary on shifting perspective and reality’s subjective nature.”
skillset in all of London and the surrounding areas."
Sherlock’s vision is white on the edges, but he is able to discern John’s face, flushed a lovely pink, looking a bit bashful and wolfish all at once - which should be impossible. It somehow makes Sherlock’s heart lodge just north of his sternum, keeping his barrage of contradicting thoughts corked inside.
I am,” John continues, his voice thick with confusion. He lets out a loud sigh. This seems like an argument that might happen with himself inside his head but, due to lack of inhibitions, Sherlock must suffer him having it aloud. “I mean I don’t notice blokes. I don’t look at them
Sherlock stares at him for a long moment, then nods slowly.
“You took your time,” Sherlock interrupts my assessment of the room almost immediately. I glance up at him, surprised and confused. That he is actually speaking, rather than just ignoring me is probably the most telling sign that he is hoping to distract me from looking too closely at the room.
Sherlock peeks over his knees and see John's eyes scanning over his frame for injury, horrified by the idea of having harmed him in some PTSD fueled night terror. Finding no visual indication of physical harm but taking in his crumpled, trembling form, John's face plunges into mortification. “Oh, God, I didn't -” He looks down at his own groin, apparently fearful he had become aroused in his sleep and tried something sexually aggressive with the man pinned beneath him.

For a moment we just stare at each other, the tension building.

“I’m losing him. Shit… McDonnell? Stay with me, Private.” Billy turns away from the light, towards the table where Captain Watson is urgently working to repair his broken body. The image of the Captain is thrumming through the misty gray of the operating theatre like a light through the fog.
” He fixes her with a cold stare
This is intolerable.
"Wrong!" Sherlock declares, whipping off his latex gloves. "It’s one possible explanation of some of the facts." He steps up to Dimmock, his posture like a coiled snake ready to spit venom. “You’ve got a solution that you
“No, don’t be like that.” John tips his chin forward so his bottom lip brushes firmly against the crease of Sherlock’s.
have. Also he said she still hasn't accepted that things are broken off though it'd been weeks. Seems - you know-” She gestures again at Mary and John, as if to say the rest is self-explanatory. Her face has gone crimson to the tips of her ears and she drops her chin to her chest.
John doesn't say anything for a long moment. He wants to find the words to make this right but he's pretty sure that words won't do.
Sherlock watches it again and again, picking up the slightest nuances. His nose is nearly pressed to the screen of the absurdly large display TV as he watches John’s face, drinking in every flicker of emotion like he is dying of thirst. His chest aches and he can hardly breathe. Each time John’s face fades to black there is a split second of panic before the voice breaks through the darkness and Sherlock’s heart starts again. The video loops three times and then all the electronics flip back to their regular programmes.
I let out a disbelieving sound that's not quite a laugh at the absurdity of Sherlock, a highly capable and deadly MI6 agent, being considered a
Sherlock searches his mind for something to say. He can't tell John that he has never really wanted another. That the thought of most people repulses him and his personality takes care of the rest.
"What? What's wrong?"
“Intriguing, as always,” Sherlock says thoughtfully as he steps closer to study the image of John. Raz has managed to capture his profile perfectly and up closer the dark shapes have subtle shifts in colouring, that gives him depth rather than the flat silhouettes they appear to be from afar.
" My irritation is sparking into fury now. "He's just a flatmate. He's arrogant, rude, and self-absorbed. We hardly speak - ignores me most the time." I can't modulate the volume of my voice. It's increasing as I reach my emotional boiling point. "I'm really
Though he couldn't get out on a mission this time, he'd thought himself safe in post-op, since the camp limits visitor access there. Obviously, this one got away from his minder to ogle at the wounded, like some gawker at a morbid, freakshow.
He is chasing a ghost through his past, really, and he doesn’t understand why. He starts to set his fork down, feeling his appetite waning. The meaty hand clasping his shoulder startles him.
“Phone.”
John doesn’t move. His hands just rest there. Sherlock closes his eyes. He thought he knew John’s hands, but
There had, of course, been John Watson and Lestrade but also John’s wife and the landlady and even that pathologist that Sherlock had insisted work his cases with him. There had even been a brother.
“Sherlock Holmes.” He strides forward to meet Sherlock confidently, eyes roving over him from head to toe and hand already extended to shake.
With John touching him, and his soft words, and his eyes that seemed to glow with genuine arousal, it had been easy to forget what was

and worthy of praise they find it annoying - infuriating even. They mock him for failing to control it - tell him to shut up, or to piss off. They often try to attack him. Sometimes they've succeed. Though he long ago resigned himself to not needing anyone’s acceptance - to at last have it, offered so simply and freely, feels...
John sighs and lifts his head to look around the bedsit. It had taken a few days walking around like a zombie before the full force of it hit him. It had come on worse than any panic attack; the emotional pain overwhelming to the point that it was made into physical agony. The bitter hopelessness of his shattered existence was just too unbearable. He lay in bed for days wanting to die just to stop feeling.
“I love you.” Sherlock spoke the words straight ahead, not indicating to whom they were directed, but John
he added forcing himself to feel the body beneath him as alive and, for the moment, safe within his protection. The warmth creeping into his skin chased the cold fear away and his shivers dissipated.
It is a Thursday evening and he is bent over his microscope in a little pool of lamp light at his desk, with a pipette in one hand and a neat row of slides waiting to be examined, when a knock comes on his dorm room door. He ignores it at first, hoping whomever it is will go away. However, when the knock comes again, he sighs and puts down the pipette. He begins to grumble in irritation, when it occurs to him that it is likely to be the equipment he’d ordered, which he specifically requested that the delivery service not leave at his door (for fear it might get swiped). Oh, it's Christmas! A perfect gift right outside the door, waiting to be unwrapped!

nor does she point out how edgy I clearly am. My fingers are tapping on the arm of the chair and I hadn't even noticed. I stop them by clenching them into a fist. "How have you been?"
I pause for a half second, eyes narrowed on that deceptively simple message. Sherlock hasn’t sent me a message since… well, since last time I was abducted by Mycroft. And once again, the text is a not-so-subtle demand for me to return to the flat. It's more than coincidence, I’m sure. I shove my phone back in my pocket and distractedly continue my line of thought.
“Right,” he repeats as he withdraws his hand from my hold and throws a brief glance at Sherlock. There are things I can't read about what he is communicating with that look but there is clearly a question there. He returns his eyes to me while thrusting his tongue into his cheek and ducking his head to scratch at the back of his neck. He clearly wants to ask something or make an inappropriate remark but wisely chooses to leave it. He instead turns to lead us into his office.
… yet…
"No cane," she notes, glancing at my leg.
. That endless cycle of guilt, despair, longing and anger is futile and exhausting but he is unable to stop it; as if tracing the path another time might reveal the elusive answers to the riddle his life has become.
His brain explodes into a cacophony of noise and sensation. Irrepressible anger surges out and possesses his body fully.
"Sher-"
“Oh, H-”
He cannot sit still and let himself be undressed - having John's hands and eyes on him - without having a
He doesn't quite understand what irritates John so much about Irene. Her passive aggressive attempts to engage Sherlock are, of course, blatant manipulation. She has only one weapon in her arsenal, her sexuality, so of course she tries to turn it on her one worthy adversary. He has never reciprocated but each new text message from her over the past month and a half has elicited an increasingly protective look from John.
Rarely is the universe lazy and sometimes…
John’s dark blue eyes, warm and reverential in the cold warehouse. Strong arms open, reaching out, welcoming.
I go into the half bathroom and splash some cool water on my face, trying to scrub away the last wisps of the fog of sleep. It feels like more than a night of bad dreams. There's an eerie feeling lingering, like an angry ghost, in the back of my brain. It makes me irritable. There's an urge to punch someone or scream right beneath the surface of my usual control.

On the table, the body of McDonnell jerks and Captain Watson feels the heart’s wall tearing in the palm of his hand.

as a form of leverage." The way he says the word ‘encounter’ - as if it tastes bitter in his mouth - makes John pause and try to work out what's really going on here.
He saves some, and loses some.
Well, now is the time to match his courage.
“Sherlock, I can see why you thought you could persuade us you did this. The fact that you
"Hi Mary. Sorry to bother you. I wouldn't normally do this but I'm really in a pinch. A friend took me out in the city and then ditched me. No money - no way back to campus. I'm sharing my location. If there is any way you can pick me up and take me back to campus I’d be grateful.

John respected that. He did. He threw himself at women with a near pathetic amount of vigor. He feverently hoped he would be satiated with each new romance or sexual escapade. He told himself that what he felt for Sherlock was merely infatuation; the allure of something new and decidedly dangerous.
John forces his eyes open. He can only take in a blurred vision of Sherlock leaning close; dark hair falling over pale forehead, eyes red rimmed and manic. John reaches up and touches his cheek, assuring himself he is solid and real. The cheek is warm and wet with tears. He lets his eyes slide closed again, holding on to that warmth.
As Sherlock concludes the expressive dance that naturally accompanies a particularly spectacular deduction, he angles his body towards John and waits for the inevitable words of praise to tumble unbidden from
“John.” Sherlock reaches up and cups his hand around the back of his neck as comfort and strength.
Mike’s voice, the door that he is propped against is flung open and he stumbles inward, smashing into a tall, lean bloke wrapped in nothing but a bed sheet.
The figure gives a quick shake of its dark head back and forth and its curly hair takes seconds too long to settle, like the air around it has less gravity.
Sherlock reaches past John for the lamp but is halted by John’s hand landing firmly on the center of his chest.
How naughty,” Irene purrs. “Must've been
With all the energy he can muster against the massive gravity within his body, he throws John off of himself.
seemed to hover around him. Consciousness ebbs away, slowly retreating like the tide clinging and swirling in little rushes against the sand. The edges between thought and dream begin to blur.
Some hours later, he comes back from the depths of his mind to find he is wandering the empty streets of lower London, his thighs and calves aching from the distance traversed and his lungs burning with the last drags of a cigarette. The weak light of morning and its promise of the typical flurry of people, with their intruding barrage of useless data, forces him back home to that empty dorm room, haunted by the absence of John.
Sherlock bites his lip. There isn’t a good way to answer that directly without giving everything away, so he side-steps it.
"Oh, don't bother with
- on my crime scene. Out." He motions and turns to lead us from the room. I catch a glimpse of Sherlock’s face falling into a dark glower as I turn to follow the DI. I get far too much delight from that. And though I wouldn't really go so far as to flirt with someone I don't have any real interest in, as we leave the bedroom I decide to stroke the DI's ego a bit by telling him what a good job he is doing.
Sherlock's long, white fingers are spread against the black surface of his desk, his marble back is straight and rigid, and his expression remains stony as he stares off into the dark of night. He's so beautiful but, at the moment, so
I want
It seems that John's
The undertones of expensive leather upholstery, sickly sweet woman's perfume and faint whiffs of Mycroft’s aftershave.
John rolls his eyes and mutters something that sounds like
Sherlock raises his head slightly to watch Hopkins enter the room. He watches her feet, a vague recollection of their previous encounter skittering across his awareness like a flickering bulb. He makes a single deduction; he is to be charged with attempted murder. They would not have sent a member of homicide otherwise. The scrape of the chair as she pulls it out grinds through his head and he raises his hands to cover his ears, realising his whole body is shivering. He closes his eyes tightly, bowing his head to shut it all out;
Surprisingly, her gaze sweeps casually up and down my body and the lush, dark crimson of her lips grows into a deeper smile, flashing the white of the teeth below as her stare settles back on my face.
“You bastard,” Lestrade says and then he is reaching for Sherlock and Sherlock makes the split second decision to let whatever harm Lestrade needs to inflict on him happen. What he does not expect is for Lestrade to wrap his arms around him and pull him into a tight embrace, every bit of it communicating that he missed Sherlock and is happy to see him. Sherlock’s mind scrambles in confusion.
“I - I was trying to put his happiness first. I was trying to be a supportive friend,” Sherlock snaps defensively.
The way Sherlock had come back to life and sucked all the air from John's lungs had nearly stopped his heart.
John has not expressed an interest in that sort of intimacy, as other versions had. That was something Sherlock had at first welcomed because the loss of John in the Victorian era (his name had been John Watson then too) had nearly broken Sherlock.
John folds his newspaper a little roughly and puts it on his table looking at Sherlock more pointedly. He looks down for a moment and when his eyes come back to Sherlock their expression has changed. They are decisive and determined. He smiles warmly.
and saying things… things he really shouldn't say. John opts for yanking Sherlock's shoes off, throwing his legs up on the bed and tucking him under the duvet.
John gazes into his eyes, taking the opportunity to evaluate his state.
“Telling the truth, as you did for the 11 days prior and now I am asking you one more question,” Sherlock says impatiently.
John seduced him with his quiet charm; a slow invasion of his head and heart and now his body.
Sherlock squares his shoulders to John and straightens his spine, facing the truth full on.
“Alright now?” John’s voice is steady but there is obvious strain. He is using his arms to try to keep his full weight off of the man beneath him.
He sighs, flips the chart closed, props his elbow on the table and rests his chin on his fist, letting his eyes drift closed for a moment. By necessity he dips into unconsciousness easily, but sleeps lightly; listening for any signs of distress in the patients lining the room.
“If they're goin’ straight for tongue down your throat, you're kissing the wrong boys, Love,” John muses.
He takes a moment to mentally debate if he should text or call, then decides to go with a text. Maybe she'll ignore it but at least there won't be another screaming match if she’s not in the mood to help. He types it out quickly, trying not to overthink it.
The earth and mint scent of John.
“I did not find you in my first life. What they now call ancient Rome… Social status did nothing to spare you dying in the street from a stab wound in those days. You… well, it wasn’t you, precisely… but the you that belonged to that time… I later learned your name was Justus.” Sherlock smiles to himself. “Seemed as appropriate then as it does now. Sherlock looks back at the wall and straightens a photo from the early 1900s.
Sherlock swallows and stares down at his phone in his hand a moment. His palms have gone sweaty. In fact, his whole body feels overheated. The coat, that was his shield, is beginning to feel suffocating. He wonders if John was right about that list of potential symptoms;
“Mmm… not all of us can live like
He's doomed. He's somehow been coerced into more time in close proximity to John. Nothing
“You don't even know what I'm going to say.”
John looked over the tall, gangly man, made small by his feotal position, and sighed in exasperation. Something had to give and, as usual, it was probably up to John. He breathed in and out slowly, his annoyance simmering below the surface. As difficult as he found these things, Sherlock likely found it near impossible to discuss any issue that may be at all emotive. He obviously needed something from John but he apparently couldn’t bring himself to ask, so it was up to the doctor to give Sherlock the opening.
everyone else. In keeping with his utterly incomprehensible and astounding character, Sherlock feels

to him. He is unprepared for the dangerously coy smile that takes over John's face and the way his eyes sweep down Sherlock's body and then back up again.
“Stay,” John says firmly in a low murmur. He lifts up and one hand briefly presses on the back of Sherlock’s neck, holding him firmly to the mattress, before it begins an agonizingly slow path down his spine. Even after the heat and pressure of John's body draped over him leaves, Sherlock doesn't dare move. He stays still, hands clasped behind his back, eyes crushed closed, panting into the mattress.
I think I might just enjoy it too.
John considers for a few disorienting seconds that he might be hearing things again. It would be true to his luck that the universe would send Sherlock’s ghost to sabotage him just when he is about to get a little relief. However, interspersed with that unquestionably
Sherlock’s eyes drop to the bloody gash again. He looks pained as he moves his fingers to skirt the deeply splayed flesh that is spilling a steady stream of John's blood. His lips form a tight line that John has come to recognise as embarrassment.
“What happens now? Where are we going?”
"I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards," I try to joke, but it's dry humour. I give a sidelong look to Sherlock but his face has tightened and gone dark again. He doesn’t say a thing but suddenly swirls out of the room and strides towards the entrance. I have to nearly run to keep up with him.
He'd seen right through to the heart of the matter.
Forget the other stuff.” He scratches at his head thoughtfully. “Well, can't say I understand it all, but I guess he called in some favors - well,
With one quick jerk John is hauled into a dark alley and pinned against the dirty brick wall. Sherlock is looming over him, that incendiary look in his eyes, a knee between John's legs and long, slender fingers clutching his jacket at the collar.
“Mmm. Don’t know,” John mumbles. Then his hands come up and land on Sherlock’s ribs. Sherlock freezes. He can still leave. He
He turns to go and plops back down with a thud, his legs giving out involuntarily at the shock of seeing John emerging from the side door of a building across the courtyard. He is different in the morning light; hair glowing golden in the sunshine, strong shoulders tense. His face is a storm cloud and he is shaking his head back and forth vigorously. He's arguing with someone. Sherlock studies the etch of his frown, the twitch of his eye. This is a completely new side of him.
“Seven. Biggest fear?”
John's gaze drops at the same time as his stomach. "He said that?” He rubs at the back at his neck as a familiar guilt swamps him.
Sherlock's POV
In the space of several thundering heartbeats two revelations burst across Sherlock’s brain as explosions of light, colour and earth-shaking sound.
The intent of the game never changed; it was, as always,
"Come on. Let me in.
For a moment Mycroft doesn't respond. The gaze he has fixed on me is cold and analytical; as if he's weighing and measuring me against a thousand rubrics in a flash. His expression betrays no clue to his stream of thoughts or the conclusion he reaches.
"What?" John moves forward, his hands sliding between fabric of the gown and Sherlock’s t-shirt. They slip over Sherlock's shoulder blades to push the gown up off his shoulders.
He hates that they can't understand.
They crash to the floor in a heap, a grunt of air escaping the sheet-clad fellow below him. John hears the door swing wide on its hinges and slam shut somewhere below their feet. They lay there on the wooden floor of the dim room amongst the ill-defined shapes of books piled high, overflowing stacks of papers and objects John can only vaguely guess (within his altered state and the low light) are scientific in nature.
"Is that a

by taking things wrong.
“Ok. yeah,” John concedes with a grin, keeping his eyes resolutely on Sherlock’s face. “But, Christmas was a week ago and... as I recall the agreement was
“I’m already breaking every rule just letting you in here.”
John waited and waited and it became more and more difficult to pick up the phone or simply show up at the door of 221B. His doubts grew.
Some kind of negotiation?
“Don't worry, Greg, I can handle myself,” John calls with a wink that makes the DI snort and shake his head.
Gary’s voice drops lower as he stares with slight reprimand at Billy, “And the fire.”
“You won’t even listen to a goddamn word I’m saying throwing this - this bloody
The sound curls around him then, a warm tendril tugging him up above the tent, above the base, further and further away, until the world below is little more than pinpricks of light against a field of black. He looks across the blue curve of the Earth and there, as he watches, a creature begins to form or, more truthfully, reveal itself; clothing itself with robes of moonlight and shadow. However, Watson instinctively knows this image is for his benefit. He is certain that this entity is, in its purest form, unfathomable. It is the darkness between stars, the center of a supernova, the raw cosmic dust that forms everything.
“Goodbye, Henry Nahyt. I hope we don't meet again for a very long time.” Sherlock says. There is a burst of light and a rush of fire that shoots from the entity’s hand and through Henry’s chest as it shoves him back into his body.
That’s all there is to
"Remember how they never leave a note?
Sherlock bites the corner of his lip and turns his head to the side. His eyes cut briefly to John standing behind him, and John knows exactly what he's planning. Most of what's going on here is over John's head but it seems that this Lestrade fellow is asking Sherlock to go running off to help him with something and John can tell that Sherlock is going to do it. He's going to use this opportunity to escape and John can't let that happen... for several reasons.
The irony is not lost on the detective. He needs John to solve a

of all people, and the self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath knows himself to be eminently unqualified to be anyone's emotional support.
He digs and digs at the memory, but he can’t find the missing scraps. He tells himself that he can’t draw a conclusion from what his fragmented and distorted recollection seems to indicate.
When his eyes come back around to me, I catch and meet his stare with a hard one of my own; a blatant challenge. That’s all it takes. His jaw clenches and his chin tips up as his eyes narrow on me. Then he shares a quick look and a subtle nod with each of his colleagues. They fan out around me in an attempt to close in from all sides. They are moving in slowly and casually; apparently not wanting to make a scene... but I have no such compunction. I plan to start swinging the moment they lay hands on me.
The insufferable chair is the first victim. Flung across the room with ease, it crashes against the wall and noise and motion erupt in a frenzy around the room, further overwhelming his frayed senses.There is no logic to his actions, he is in psychological free-fall and there is only the conviction that his body must rid itself of this build up before it rips him to pieces.
"Sherlock-" I shake my head in denial. "You don't know what you're asking of me.”
It was too easy. Too good. That’s why it
or he might explode.
“What?”
Sherlock's body is rocking now; the
“Sherlock, just -”
John pauses but Sherlock embraces the opportunity to at last twist free of the coat. When he turns to glare, it’s completely wasted on John’s back. John is already turned and he is walking away to hang the coat on the back of the door.
“Oh,” John breathes. He holds himself still as he looks up into Sherlock’s eyes and really sees him for the first time. Sherlock is wrecked; his eyes wide and glassy, his lips trembling slightly, his face, an even more ghostly parlor than usual, is so open and genuine. He is completely unguarded and that raw vulnerability is breathtaking. It lodges in the center of John's chest, just below his sternum and stays there, searing hot and painfully heavy.
Sherlock just shakes his head back and forth, putting on a look of innocence. I glance down and see the glint of metal of a rather menacing sword pushed back under the chair he is sitting in. He has his foot atop it in an effort to hide it from me.
We’d almost died, we would many times more, but it was never a question if I was willing to walk into hellfire and certain damnation with you. Nothing has ever made me feel more alive than you. I was always willing to lay my life on the line for you because living life without you would
He readjusts in his seat, the swelling flesh in his jeans over the memory becoming too uncomfortable. His cheeks are blazing hot. He scrubs his hand down his face trying to wipe away the imaginings and bring his brain back to decent, respectable thoughts.
“I am requesting…
“Well
“Hardly.” Sherlock shifts his hands a bit, still clasped in the center of his back, and deadpans, “Does this appear very convenient?”
new sensation in his body.
... and she always said that the secret to a happy marriage is that the commitment is not something you do once in a church in front of a bunch of people, it is something you do
“You're death,” Henry gasps, sliding back towards the door. Fear still prickles at him, though it is dulled by a remoteness; as if everything that is happening is a step removed, and muted by a soft peace flowing through him.
The crack of flesh on flesh seems abnormally loud echoing through the alley. Sherlock’s head snaps to the side with the force of the blow but he turns his head slowly back to look at Victor. John shifts forward, ready to intervene but he hesitates, flexing his hands at his sides. What right does he have if this is just a lovers quarrel?

but he looks nothing like the man that dashed away from the crime scene hours earlier. He's a right mess. His clothing is disheveled and soaked through with the rain. There are smears of something that looks suspiciously like rotten food on his trousers and shoes.
