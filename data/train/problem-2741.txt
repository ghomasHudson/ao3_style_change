“Ah, I’m so sorry man, we haven’t been introduced. Dean Winchester, at your service.” Dean gave the demon his biggest shit eating grin and hoped that his reputation preceded him. Dean was happy to see the recognition that crossed the demon’s face. He was less pleased when the asshole started laughing.
“Yes. Thank you for your assistance Sam.” Sam smiled at Cas brightly and got to work. Since they had already spent a day gathering ingredients, they just had to combine them and cast the spell. Sam did the actual spell work as Cas sat in a chair and tolerated the cold gunk being used to paint sigils on his back. Sam chanted in Enochian and for a moment it seemed like nothing had happened. Then there was a flash of blue light on Cas’ back and the sigils disappeared.
“You don’t want them?” Cas glanced so hungrily at Dean’s fries that Dean couldn’t help but be impressed with the guy’s restraint.
It took him less than an hour to find the area Sam had described, and most of that time was spent hiking as he didn’t want to drive directly up to the witch’s hidey-hole. Using binoculars to scope the place out, Dean noted that the building looked like little more than a dilapidated cabin, complete with a collapsed roof in one corner. Dean imagined that must have been where Cas had blasted Sam away from the fight, the debris looked recent. For a healer Cas must be one helluva powerful witch, the damage to the structure was impressive.
“Tone it down, Cassie. I’ve already told your boy toy here some of the highlights, but let’s stick with the important life-saving stuff for now.” While frustrated, Cas gestured for his uncle to continue, figuring it was the path of least resistance when it came to getting information from Gabe. Cas leaned into Dean, not really noticing he was doing it until Dean threw his arm around Cas, meeting him halfway. To Cas’ surprise, his intangible wings seemed to have a mind of their own as they curled around him and Dean. Cas hoped that whatever Gabe had to say wasn’t going to ruin what he and Dean had been tentatively building between them.
“Oh, you only see my wings?” There was a part of Cas that kind of liked that. It’s not that Dean could see things that normally ony Gabe and Cas saw, it was that Dean could see things about just Cas.
“Yeah, hah, grooming. I think most people talk about it like that for the non-human primates though, Cas. But I don’t mind ‘grooming’ with you.” Dean smirks and Castiel is still not sure what is so humorous. Regardless, this is his gift to Dean and he is not done yet.
“Just shut up and get the other one!” The second lid was wrenched off and Dean shoved it into Sam’s arms. He took a second to reload his gun which made him feel slightly better, even if the bullets hadn’t phased the monster. Then Dean picked up the other lid in his free hand. When he glanced over at Sam, his overly tall brother was looking at Dean like maybe he had finally lost it for real. Dean just shoved Sam towards the back of the building.
“Yeah, yeah. C’mon, let’s get this cleaned up before they bring back our candy bars.” Dean took one of the wipes the volunteers had place around the room and before he could think about it too much, he raised the cloth towards Cas’ face. Dean gently wiped the smudge from Cas’ nose as the angel stared at Dean with a soft look in his blue eyes that Dean couldn’t quite identify.
“Sam Winchester, you need to tell him that! If you’ve never known Dean to have even considered hooking up with a guy, it will help him to know you support him. I’m sure part of him understands you wouldn’t be bothered, but it helps to hear it.” Sam nodded solemnly still looking at his brother who was busy flipping through the chocolate making menu and laughing at something Cas had said.
“Uh, yeah. I was just saying that she said she’d stop by the bunker in about a week. I’d hoped she would come for Christmas but she can’t make it.” Cas reached his hand out to gently touch Dean’s shoulder for just a moment, wishing he had a reason to keep his hand there longer.
“What? What? You just text me to say you and Sam found the trail of a YETI, and then refuse to answer your phone? What if I couldn’t find you in time? What if I hadn’t already figured out it was a witch? I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU IT WAS A WITCH IF YOU HAD ANSWERED YOUR PHONE. Instead I make it just in time to see the two of you throwing yourself off of a mountain!” Dean was all ready to get angry and defensive but found himself defusing as the whole “it was just a witch” thing sunk in. Crap. Cas seemed to have run out of words and was now just glowering intensely at him.
“C’mon Dean, we have to hurry. She’s already murdered two people and I left Cas behind! I’ll never forgive myself if she hurts him, we have to go!” Dean dragged his feet as he took in his injured brother’s current state. He was covered in scratches and rapidly forming bruises, and seemed to have a long trail of drying blood originating from his skull.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel replied seriously. Then Cas turned to see one of the volunteers bringing back their peppermint bark experiment. Dean reached out to take the wrapped bars while Cas thanked the volunteer for helping with the event.
“I’ll remember to leave my ID at home next time I’m compelled to play vigilante.” Dean snickered at Cas’ dry sarcasm. “Nothing is missing.”
“Dammit boy, you want to tell me what the hell is going on? I just saw you lot appear out of thin air.” Bobby took out a flask without relinquishing the gun, and proceeded to splash the whole group. Gabe decided to ignore the holy water and the gun and flew another small hop into the house having seen a couch through the door. He put Cassie down gently and started to evaluate the state of his nephew’s wings, and therefore his Grace, more closely.
“Please, Gabriel. You have to save him.” Anna’s voice trembled as she clung to her archangel brother, clutching a small bundle tightly to her chest. As Anna’s knees gave out, Gabriel picked up what was left of the angelic warrior and flew her to the house he was currently using. She continued to plead with him as Gabriel placed her gently onto a soft couch in the living room.
“What were you thinking? What if I hadn’t been fast enough?” Dean let Castiel rant at him for a few moments, standing up and dusting off the dirt from the back of his jeans.
“Cas, you’re practically a planetarium. It’s like there are whole galaxies in here. I could look forever and never see all there is to see.” As this is one of the better human descriptions of angel true forms, Castiel feels content that he has shown the man he loves much more of what he really is. That Dean shows such quiet wonder at this glimpse of the heart of Castiel makes him feel safe to take another risk, one that means even more. He presses his wings in to bring Dean even closer, until their chests are almost touching. Cas pulls the smaller gift out of his pocket and lays it in Dean’s hand. Dean’s eyes are alight with curiosity as he peels off the paper. He shoves the crumpled paper in his coat pocket and lets the pendant that had been within drop, carefully holding the chain in his fingers. He squints at the pendant, a feather preserved on top of bronze, and then gasps.
“You can see them?” Dean nodded in affirmation. “They’re magical in nature, no one besides Gabe has noticed them before, and he’s the one who put them on me.”
Castiel lets himself feel all of the emotions that had been let loose from his time as a human. It’s a risk, even with everything that’s happened between him and Dean this past week, Castiel is well aware he could be setting himself up for disappointment. He just doesn’t have it in him anymore to resist the feelings pounding at his grace enforced walls. He wants to feel the joy at Dean making a room for him here in the bunker, for telling Castiel that he belongs here. He wants to feel the bubbly happiness at the absurd bee pillow on his bed, the swooping feeling of loving Dean more than he has loved anything for the entirety of his existence. Maybe he’s diving off a ledge with no ability to fly, but he refuses to stop every glorious feeling permeating his being as he drags Dean back to the Christmas tree. He gazes up at the doll version of himself propped up on top of the tree, takes in the Scooby-doo ornaments he’d brought home to make Dean and Sam smile, wrinkles his nose at the truly awful taste earlier Men of Letters had in décor, and indulges in a goofy grin at the lights he and Dean put up together. He dives towards the handful of presents underneath the tree and picks up two small ones carefully wrapped and garnished with curly ribbon. He pockets the smallest of the two, and turns around to press the larger of them into Dean’s hands.
“Hey, Charlie just texted me asking if we wanted to go to some Christmas shopping thing with her tonight. I thought this would be a good chance for Cas to get in some more holiday experience.” Sam just laughed and told Dean that they should get ready if he wanted to go and his brother rushed off to tell Cas.
Dean wasn’t easily impressed these days, but even he had to admit that the tree growing out of the grave was unlike anything he’d come across before. The historic cemetery in the middle of Missouri had its fair share of trees, but they had come here for this one. Cas stood next to him looking like he was attempting to interrogate the tree with his mind. For a moment Dean was distracted by the angel, smiling a bit at the memory of the time Cas had insisted on interrogating a cat. Luckily, Cas had gotten better at blending in, so at least he wasn’t actively asking the tree questions. There was the sound of someone clearing their throat to Dean’s other side and Dean directed his attention back to the cemetery’s caretaker, Mrs. Paige.
“Hiya, Dean-o. I’m Cassie’s Uncle Gabe. You mind letting me get a closer look at my nephew there?” Dean glowered at Gabe, obviously suspicious.
“And look how they’re all in each other’s space. Anyone else here would assume they are already dating.”
“I’m sure he will appreciate it Cas. You make him better, you know. He’s cares for himself more when you’re here, I don’t worry about him as much.” They had made it to the roof and Cas turned around to look at Sam with a solemn expression.
“I have to admit, this is a pretty cool place.” Cas agreed with Dean and pulled his drink towards him, only then noticing that the notably handmade mug was covered in bumps that were painted to look like bees. He glanced up at Dean only to find him watching Cas in anticipation. A smile slowly spread across the angel’s face.
“Did you hit your head Dean?” Cas’ voice was so gravelly and sexy. He tried to move Cas’ chin to make him say more. Cas just caught Dean’s arm and looked up at Sam. “I think he has a concussion, give me a moment.” Sam nodded and went to check out the Yeti. Meanwhile Dean was enraptured by Cas’ eyes, they were just so blue.
“There’s something shielding you, but I’m sure the Demon Coven will be interested regardless. They’re always in the market for unusual supernatural creatures.” Cas’ blood ran cold at the mention of the Demon Coven. While all dark magic was tied to the demonic, the Demon Coven dealt directly with Hell. According to Rowena many of them welcomed demonic possession and while Castiel’s Uncle Gabe had told him very little about his parentage, he knew that his mother had been killed by members of that coven when their house had burned down. Cas had been an infant at the time.
Thank you for reading my first attempt at Suptober. While the issue discussed is a tough one it's one to which I can personally relate and was inspired by my recent day long argument to get the medication I needed from my new insurance company (continuity of care, my ass).
“I’d like to give you your Christmas present on Christmas Eve. Just us. I know it’s traditional to exchange gift on the actual day but -” Dean cut Cas off before he could continue.
Cas had taken the time to share his sister’s story with Dean as they walked around the festival that first night. While Anna’s situation hadn’t been quite the same, Dean understood why Cas felt compelled to talk to him. Dean assured Cas that while he’d had times where he struggled with depression because of the constant pain RA caused him when untreated (and sometimes even with his medication), that he wasn’t going to give up. Dean told him how Dr. Barnes had changed his life when she got him on his current medication and that he trusted her to help him make it through the issues he was having now with his new insurance company. Then he winked at Cas, tipping his mouth up in a smirk, and told the blue-eyed man that he certainly intended to take care of himself if it meant he’d get the chance to see more of Cas.
“You said you could kind of taste the peppermint bark we made, right? The have peppermint flavor on the specials board, if you want.” Cas nodded and let Dean order coffee for Castiel and hot chocolate for himself. While Dean was ordering Cas looked around at some of the artwork hanging on the walls, keeping an eye out for their last scavenger hunt angel. He was contemplating a painting that seemed to be an abstract version of a human eye when Dean came up behind him holding two mismatched mugs.
“I convinced Cas to help me take down a witch that started to gain a local foothold while Rowena’s been gone. She’s killed two people and I was worried she’d kill a lot more before Rowena gets back next week. You know how that type of thing attracts hunters, and by the time they got here Cas, Rowena, and I would become targets as well.” Dean wrenched his arm away from his brother’s grasp in anger.
“That would be acceptable.” Cas paused to look out over the cemetery again before opening the passenger side door of the Impala. Dean noticed the angel’s hesitation.
“Yeah? I’m all ears, sunshine.” Dean’s grin is mischievous as Cas runs a thumb along the bottom of Dean’s lip.
“Oh, wait up Cas.” Dean quickly pulled out a value pack of toothbrushes and handed one to the healer along with his toothpaste. Cas gave him a grateful smile and closed the bathroom door.
Dean took the paper from her as they continued walking. It was listed as an all-ages window and store hunt with different prizes every night and Dean laughed as he saw what they were supposed to be looking for.
“Yeah, well, you’re the only one that matters.” Crap, did Dean just say that out loud? “Uh, I mean, c’mon, don’t you want to participate in Christmas traditions? You did ask me for help with that, right?” Cas was staring at him, as if trying to solve a puzzle but Dean just nervously pushed the event booklet into the angel’s hands. “Er, if you don’t want to look for ‘angels’ you can see if there’s something else you’d like to do.” Cas gave Dean a quiet smile and put the booklet in his pocket.
So, tonight Dean would get his new boyfriend to teach him about where he came from with the very thing that Dean used to remember his origins. After that, Dean would share his mother’s apple pie recipe when he came over for Thanksgiving. He’d probably bring more than one pie; it was always good to have extra. He’d meet Cas’ brother and just maybe, if he was lucky, Cas would stick around long enough to meet Sammy for Christmas.
“Cas!” Dean threw the stake towards the angel who managed to catch it neatly without even looking. Ducking down as the creature threw itself towards him, Cas pushed the stake up and underneath the monster’s rib cage with more force than a normal human could have managed. Dean breathed a sigh of relief too early, the vamp surged back up and made another run at the rapidly tiring angel.
“Well, that cost way more than I was originally intending to spend on Dean, and she won’t have it ready until tomorrow night, but I think it’ll be worth it.” Sam honestly looks excited just for himself, so Charlie just punches his arm and grins.
“Okay, so obviously angels have wings, and you can project a shadow type image. You also said they can be used protectively to an extent – don’t they need to have some amount of physical presence in this plane for that to be possible?” Sam really did want to help Cas, but he was also geeking out a bit. How often did someone get the chance to learn this much about angels?
While it’s not exactly a question, Cas understands that he needs to put this in more human terms. “Yes, Dean. You would be accepting that what we have is more than just friendship. I love you Dean. I am content with just being by your side, and if you do not love me the same way nothing has to change. However, these past days have allowed me to hope for more. So, I am offering you more. I am offering you me, if you choose to accept me.” Castiel’s hand has moved up to cradle Dean’s face, but he needs Dean to choose what he wants and does not move further.
Reaching out a shaking hand, Dean sunk his fingers into the softest and yet most exhilarating thing he’d ever felt. Cas’ feathers were awesome; they were like silk and steel at the same time. When  he’d touched Cas’ back the previous night, the sensation had been severely muted in comparison to the full experience. Once Dean started touching, he wasn’t sure how to stop.
“It’ll be fine, it’s not like we had a big Thanksgiving planned or anything.” Cas hesitates for a moment wondering if a handful of partial dates was enough to justify spending holidays together. Then he decided he’d already chased after a man he didn’t know because he overheard his private conversation so maybe what he and Dean were doing wasn’t meant to be traditionally paced anyway.
“Okay, let’s try the roof. We’re in the middle of nowhere so it’s unlikely anyone will see you.” Cas agreed and proceeded to walk outside, still shirtless. Sam almost said something about it being cold and still snowing on and off, but then remembered it wouldn’t bother the angel anyway. Sam grabbed his coat and hat and followed Cas outside.
“Crap, crap, crap!” Before Dean had time to spin back around, he felt as if the bottom of the lid dropped from under him as he heard it crunch on gravel. With the last vestiges of his adrenaline he managed to throw himself off of the lid and roll – right into the Yeti. Dean only had a moment to stare up into the face of the vicious spitting creature before hearing a pop-pop noise and then the hairy snarling thing tipped over. Onto Dean. Dean felt his head crack on the ground. “Ermph!”
“Nah. I was trying to get rid of any junk lying around. It was just something to do since while we don't have a case.”
Dean also knew that Sam worried about his health. Dean had been diagnosed with RA shortly before his brother’s graduation when pain that had been manageable in the past began to interfere with Dean’s ability to complete simple tasks. Early on Dean had written off the joint pain as a result of working too hard at the garage, or overexerting himself keeping their older house maintained. Dean tried the usual remedies of exercise and eating (somewhat) healthier at Sam’s insistence, but Dean continued to have unexplained pain. He finally went to see his doctor when he had to keep his arm in a sling because of unbearable shoulder pain. Dean knew he hadn’t injured his shoulder; he’d been paying close attention to anything that may have been a factor in the constant stream of inexplicable injuries, and there was absolutely no reason why it should feel as if he’d hurt his rotator cuff.
“Well come on then, I suppose I’m helping you.” She turned around quickly as Gabriel followed and jabbed her finger into his chest. “You will owe me archangel, and I plan on collecting.” Gabriel laughed.
“I’d appreciate it, jeans aren’t great sleepwear. Do you mind if I grab the shower first? I don’t think I’ll be able to stay awake much longer.”
“Sorry Sam. It appears that they do have some degree of physicality. Hopefully that will be enough for Dean to be able to touch them with the addition of the other spell.” Cas tipped one side of his mouth up in a half smile, obviously pleased that his idea was working out so far. Cas noticed Sam shivering. “We can go inside now, thank you for your help Sam.”
“Charlie,” began Castiel sincerely, “I want to say thank you for the Christmas gift.” Charlie practically beamed at Cas.
“Dean. Are you listening?” Dean pulled his eyes away from the tree and turned towards Cas who continued to keep his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“I’ll do everything I can Sammy. Fill me in quickly and then go back inside and stay there until I get back.” Dean listened carefully as his brother went over the information he’d obtained and then briefly told him about where they had found the witch and how Cas had made sure Sam had an opportunity to escape at the older witch’s own expense. Dean popped Baby’s trunk as he listened and loaded one of his guns with witch-killing bullets as Sam talked. He also grabbed one of his hunting rifles, grateful he had witch-killing ammo for something more equipped for distance. This lady sounded more dangerous than Sam had initially anticipated and Dean would rather not get too close if he didn’t need to.
“Mrs. Paige said that the victim may have been a descendant of Captain Abbot, but she wasn’t sure. She suggested the Historical Society again, if we needed further information. She did say that she knew Louisa Abbot when she was a teenager. She was one of several teenagers she used to call the police on for breaking into the cemetery after hours to party. Mrs. Paige said she hadn’t really seen her in more recent years.
“Eugh! No fair Cas!” As gross as the feeling of melted chocolate in his ear was, Dean couldn’t help laughing. Their peppermint bark was in a freezer to help it set faster, although they had been told by one of the volunteers running the event that two bars takes a lot less time than a whole pan. When he looked up at Cas’ self-satisfied grin and chocolate smeared nose Dean dissolved into laughter all over again. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this good.
“Can’t say I know what you’re talking about, Cas. I mean, you’ve gotten kinda glowy before, but I assumed that was part of your healing mojo.” Dean let out a whoop of joy, he saw the Impala just ahead. Glancing down at his phone he didn’t hear Cas’ response as he noticed he finally had service. “One sec, I wanna call Sammy and get him to clear out of Rowena’s in case they trace you back to her.”
“Let’s go back inside. You should sleep for a while, so we can exchange gifts with Sam in the morning.” Dean frowns in response to this suggestion.
“No. My affinity for healing is rare but not unheard of. Rowena never mentioned anything being unusual about me.”
“Well, what do you want? From Cas, I mean.” Dean took a moment to think about that. What did he want? Putting aside the idea that the guy he loved was an actual angel, and Dean was just some run of the mill human; putting aside the idea that Dean was an absolute mess of a human who in no way knew how to even be in a relationship… well pushing all of that away, Dean wanted to be with Castiel. Like, all the time. He wanted to hold hands, to kiss him, to wake up and have those amazing blue eyes be the first thing he sees, to, as much as he cringed to think it, basically live out some sort of chick-flick fantasy with the gorgeous angel. Not that he was going to say any of that.
“Are you kidding, Charlie?” Dean growled. “Obviously, it fucking snowed, we were awake for that part last night!” Charlie continued to look at him expectantly and eventually he caved and hauled himself to the bathroom since, apparently, he didn’t have a choice but to wake up. He was originally just going to splash some water on his face but decided that a shower sounded like a much better way of not being an asshole to everyone for the rest of the day. That and caffeine. As he showered, he allowed himself to fall back into the memory of Castiel’s lips, the surreal feeling of only him and the angel existing as the falling snow muffled all the sound.
“Hey, you found it!” Cas had discovered the last scavenger hunt angel. Dean turned to ask Cas if he still had the checklist for the game and was startled to find those startling eyes much closer than he had expected. His heart stuttered and for a moment Dean forgot to breathe. Cas’ eyes were wide and his breath soft and smelling of coffee and peppermint. Dean found himself leaning in as if Castiel’s lips were a force of gravity, and unexpectedly the angel started leaning in as well. Dean gulped air and – heard the scuff of a foot just behind him. Dean jumped in his seat and turned to see Sam and Charlie.
“We aren’t. Gabriel is transporting us elsewhere while Cas recovers.” Sam made an indignant huff on the other end of the line.
“I guess… it’s about showing Dean something of my true self. Giving him a part of myself so he knows how much I value him.” Cas seemed to want to say something else but stopped short. Sam honestly thought the whole thing was stupid romantic, and while his brother wasn’t big into talking about feelings, he doubted even Dean could fail to react emotionally to Cas’ present.
One of the servers led them to a circular corner booth and brought out waters and menus for while they waited for the rest of their group. Dean pretended to be looking at the menu as he silently studied Cas on the other side of the table. He was always drawn to the angel’s intensely blue eyes, so much bluer than his vessel’s had been. Dean had thought maybe it was just his imagination that he could see something of the true angel in those eyes until he had spent more time with Claire. Jimmy’s daughter had her father’s eyes, Cas’ eyes weren’t quite the same. They were deeper somehow; it was why Dean sometimes forgot that he was staring at the angel for awkward amounts of time, it was like he could drown in the stormy blue irises.
“Of course, I’m rather fond of Sam, I’d hate to see him killed by evil witches.” Dean chuckled in appreciation of Cas’ dry sarcasm.
“I dunno, maybe she’s looking at the other stuff to do here since her booklet is in your pocket.” Cas looked unconvinced but turned back towards Dean anyway.
“Huh, maybe you’re right. I mean, I figured a lot of Dean’s recent effort was because he felt guilty about something Cas told Mom, but volunteering for a cutesy Christmas event seems bit above and beyond if that were the case.” Charlie nodded eagerly.
“Good. Do that. Call me when you get there.” Dean hung up the phone and handed it over to Cas. Dean closed his eyes as Cas dialed, and took a few deep breaths. Sam was going to make him go grey well before his time.
“Thanks. Sorry about that, I’d have healed myself hours ago but these cuffs are suppressing my magic.” As Cas guzzled the rest of the water, Dean leaned over to take a closer look at the cuffs. He hadn’t seen anything like them before, but he recognized some of the sigil work. Despite the exotic appearance the locking mechanism seemed simple enough.
Despite only having been in the area for a short time, the witch Sam had wanted to hunt down seemed to have an elaborate set up. It reminded Cas of Baba Yaga stories, which was in no way reassuring. Animal bones hung from the ceiling of what looked to be an old root cellar. A beat-up wooden table was near the center of the room and featured a massive cleaver along with unidentified bloodstains. There was even a large cauldron over a fire pit, bubbling with some sort of mystery liquid that smelled truly terrible. For one insane moment Cas wondered if this was some sort of prank, maybe he’d fallen asleep watching Hocus Pocus and was having some sort of bizarre nightmare. There’s no way a real-life murderous witch would have a setup that looked right out of a Halloween movie, right?
“It will be. I need him to live, please. I can feel myself fading, there isn’t much time.” Gabriel looked at the baby again, knowing that he shouldn’t save the boy, that it was far too dangerous. As if sensing Gabe’s internal debate the infant opened his eyes. Gabriel was startled by an intense blue stare. Even with a fraction of a soul and diminishing grace there was something about him, something Gabriel felt compelled to protect. Sighing deeply, Gabe knew he’d do as Anna asked, after all, when had he ever played things safe?
“I would like to experience Christmas with people I care for. Sam is teaching me some of your local holiday customs. Will you come help?” Castiel may have resorted to the head tilt Dean always responded to. He was not above ‘fighting dirty’ when it came to Dean’s happiness. Dean gave Cas a genuine smile and pushed him towards the door.
“Uh, hey man. I actually came out to ask you something else, but I think this just got awkward.” Cas took a deep breath already knowing it was Dean standing behind him. Cas’ habit of muttering to himself when anxious had gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion, but never quite as badly as this felt. Sadly, his fervent wish to turn invisible on the spot was being ignored by the universe and he found himself staring into striking green eyes while wondering how he could possibly salvage this situation.
“I promise I’ll give you the whole story later. Short version, the Demon Coven may be showing up at Rowena’s place – or anywhere associated with Cas. So, get somewhere they can’t find you. Maybe call Charlie and see if you can hang out with her while we figure this out. Oh, and let Rowena know before she comes home.” Dean could practically hear Sam thinking over the phone.
“Okay, okay. Give me a minute.” Sam tried to be patient as he heard soft tapping noises, likely from Charlie’s keyboard. “Here’s something. It’s maybe ninety minutes or so away from you guys, but it’s not far from where I am. There’s this historic riverside city that has something called Midnight Madness where all the stores are open late into the night. They have a bunch of sales and decorations, but from the event listing it looks like mostly locals show up, and it’s semi-remote. Ooo, didn’t you say they’d been baking together?”
“Gabriel. What’s wrong with him? Does he just need to sleep off the magic drain?” Gabriel glanced over his shoulder to see Dean hovering, his face a mask of worry.
“I’d really like to kiss you right now, and I don’t want to stop kissing you anytime soon.” Dean’s lips are on him as soon as the words leave his mouth. The last coherent thought has for the next while is that Dean does taste like pie, but also, he feels like coming home.
“Why would anyone give you an infant to care for? The child is hungry. Go off with you. Fly away and get something to feed the babe.” Rowena continued to her library and started looking over the spines of the books, Gabe trailing behind her.
“Well, no, but I do have a crazier idea.” Dean knocked over one of the bins and started working the lid off of the top. “Come help already!” Sam and Dean together popped off one of the massive plastic lids just as the door shook with the Yeti’s weight. The thing screeched in rage and pounded harder.
Cas exited the bathroom wearing only the sweatpants that had been loaned to him, as it seemed pointless to cover up the flickering feathers on his back until Dean had a better look at them. He found Dean pacing the room while anxiously chewing on his lip.
“I’m sorry she couldn’t be there for Christmas,” Cas said softly. Surprisingly, Dean reached back to stop Castiel’s fingers from moving away. Cas froze, not daring to move a muscle.
“Cas? Castiel? Hey man, you gotta get up.” Dean gently cradled the healer’s head as he spoke, hoping he wouldn’t be jostled too badly if he came around. It had absolutely nothing to do with Dean’s intense desire to trail his fingers along Cas’ face. Dean was relieved to hear Cas grumble, and stunned yet again by hypnotic blue eyes as the man slowly rejoined the waking world.
Castiel was not usually a pessimist. At worst, he thought of himself as a realist, but all things considered, he now found himself locked into a doom and gloom mindset. Really though, he wasn’t exactly prepared to deal with magic binding handcuffs, he hadn’t even known something like that existed. He’d learned on one especially drunken night that Sam could pick locks as he broke into Uncle Gabe’s liquor cabinet. Sadly, it had never occurred to Cas to ask his friend for lessons, he’d just stood there, jaw hanging open, and more impressed than he likely would have been if he’d been sober. Glaring resentfully at the painful cuffs, Cas desperately regretted not having branched out from his more law-abiding hobbies.
“Yeah, and it worked. For the record, I’d have done that even if it wasn’t to trick the thing though. Better me than you.” Dean was maybe angrier than he expected. He realized he’d been worried about how long Cas would last against that thing as he noted cuts that weren’t healing and the way the angel was swaying as he tried to hold himself upright. He also noticed that the blue in Cas’ eyes was in no way diminishing as he glowered at Dean.
Cas thought that maybe it was a mistake, but after last night he didn’t want to be away from Dean. Once he had pulled a blanket over his exhausted friend, Cas changed into the pajamas Dean had given him again and laid down beside him. He stayed above the covers and just watched Dean sleep. He didn’t tell Dean anymore that he’d watch over him as he didn’t enjoy being called creepy. Dean didn’t seem to understand that watching was part of who Castiel was as an angel. While he had rebelled and fallen it didn’t change his need to watch over the man he pulled out of hell. It would be like going to long without air for a human. Cas needed to watch Dean, to protect him, to assure himself that he was safe.
While a lot of magic users tended to rely on their arcane talents, Cas had been raised in the human world until he’d graduated high school (a year early) as his uncle insisted that Cas should be able to navigate the human world as well as the supernatural one. Gabe had also taken the violent death of Cas’ mother to heart and had signed his nephew up for martial arts lessons from a young age.
“He’ll calm down. You could try a more sincere apology though.” Little brothers were obnoxious, especially when they were right, thought Dean. He frowned at Sam but couldn’t keep it up as he sat on one of the beds with a heavy sigh.
“Oh, I’ll do more that remind you, I’ll help you throw away the damn key.” Dean frowned, evidently more pissed off at Sam than even Cas had been. Cas watched as Dean schooled his features into a false calm before the hunter resumed the conversation. “Can I ask, what are the tattoos you were just touching on your arms? I mean, I get if they’re personal, but the part I saw was kinda shimmery, it looked cool.”
“She died the same day as I was born, I never knew her. Uncle Gabe is the only family I have. My uncle doesn’t even have a picture, he had to take me and run. He told me she was killed by the Demon Coven, and that she’d saved my life. Like you probably saved mine today. I’m sorry I haven’t said it yet, but thank you Dean.” Cas’ voice dropped lower, fingers dancing over the feather sigil before he found himself looking up into sad green eyes as Dean reached across to place his hand alongside the tattoo, weaving their fingers together.
“Fine, tell us what you do know since Rowena isn’t here.” Cas was quickly losing patience with his uncle. He’d had Cas’ whole life to explain all this angel stuff and yet he waited until the Demon Coven discovered him to talk about it.
“Two spells. One will make it easier for me to redirect my grace through my wings. When they were damaged by Metatron it became more difficult to make use of them. The second is specifically for Dean to give him temporary access to the astral plane, if he focuses on it. Gifted humans can do this anyway, and his temporary abilities will only work if I can meet him halfway.”
“Yes. Aspects of angel wings can retain physicality in certain circumstances as well. For example, a feather removed from our wings with purpose can retain enough of a, hm, echo of our grace to retain physicality. The purpose of this spell follows a similar principle. The difficulty is in maintaining it for a period of time without draining my grace too badly. It’s also strange because my wings are already altered when I’m in a vessel to be proportionate to the human body. They are only a reflection of my true form, so I’m attempting to alter and alteration.” Sam thought about that for a moment.
“Alright, asshole. Time to talk. What the hell does your coven want with a healing witch?” The demon sneered at Dean.
Waking up slowly, Cas found that standing wasn’t really an option. His head throbbed painfully, forcing what little remained of his breakfast to almost exit his stomach. Fighting back the nausea, Cas saw that he was in what looked like a human sized bird cage with some sort of magic disrupting cuffs locked onto his wrists. The sigils on the cuffs flared up when Cas tried to pull on his innate healing abilities to soothe the throbbing pain that seemed to move through his whole body. He felt like he’d been run over by a car or something, though at least there didn’t seem to be any broken bones to worry about. Taking a few deep breaths to try and clear his head, Cas took a closer look at his surroundings.
Dean eagerly buried his fingers in Cas’ thick dark hair, deepening the kiss. Barely coming up for air, Dean idly wondered if they’d be skipping out on peach pie tonight as well – not that he was complaining. Cas pulled away all too soon, but the look into his darkened eyes was enough to convince Dean that this wasn’t the last he’d taste of Cas that night.
“Whatever, bitch. We’re fine by the way, thanks for asking. Why are they tracking us, and how are they tracking my car? Bobby went to go tow it from the diner where we got attacked. Do I need to get a hold of him and tell him not to bring it to the salvage yard?”
As usual, things had not gone according to plan. Dean had arrived to see Cas holding the mutant-vamp at bay, but clearly struggling to gain an upper hand over the creature they didn’t yet have the means to kill. Dean knew better than to jump into the middle of that fight, it was more important to finish Rowena’s spell. He dumped the ashes in with the rest of the material. Luckily Cas had left a copy of the actual spell out by the bowl with all the ingredients. The incantation was pretty straightforward and Dean quickly scooped up the resulting concoction on two fingers and began filling in the sigil carved into the tree. Dean picked up the branch Cas had sharpened into a stake and touched it to the sigil, running through the incantation one more time. In a brief flash of light, the sigil was absorbed into the stake.
“Yeah, okay. I’m not great at apologies, but he’s right, I should have answered the phone. I was just so caught up tracking the Yeti-witch thing, I dunno, I just didn’t think.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“You basically just need to feel close to one another, these bonds aren’t really physical, that’s just one way to activate them. Cassie will start getting noticeably weaker if the soul drain starts again.” Cas and Dean both indicated that they understood.
“Well, something happened. How do you feel Cas?” Cas started to shake and make pained noises. “Crap! Cas, are you okay?” Sam crouched down in front of his friend, not sure what to do. Cas held his hand out indicating that he needed a moment so Sam waited anxiously while the angel curled over his stomach breathing heavily. Slowly, Cas seemed to breath more normally until he finally sat up.
“Do I even want to know, guys?” Dean encouraged Cas to tell Charlie about their cartoon adventures as they walked over to wait in line with Sam.
“My grandmother called it a pie, so it’s a pie. Think of it as a sheet pie if it makes you feel better.” Dean still knew it wasn’t a pie, but out loud he conceded that sheet pie was an acceptable compromise.
“Well, if you’re really sure of what you want, you should go and make it happen. I’ll be even more awesome and help you out.” Charlie took out her phone and spent a few moments messing around with it. Then she passed it over to Dean. He smiled as he read over the screen advertising an all day viewing of Christmas movies at the building that was originally a theatre back in the 19th century. Apparently, the current owners had kept one of the viewing rooms maintained for special occasions.
“Yeah, how’d you feel about hunting with me once you feel a bit better? I bet you’re awesome at research, and we could stay together longer while we figure out this bond thing. Even if you decide to have Gabe bind your wings again, I could use a badass hunting partner. I promise I’m much better at this than Sam.” To Dean’s relief, Cas grinned at him.
“Shit!” Cas yanked off his t-shirt, balling it up and holding it to his forehead in an attempt to stem the blood flow and focus in on Dean. Reaching out to heal him, Cas was thrown roughly towards the passenger side of the vehicle as (was that a fucking boulder being thrown at them?) the intensity of the assault increased. Cas knew it was a magical attack, likely a telekinetic witch and/or demon, but without knowing where the bastard was Cas didn’t know how to stop them.
“I’m okay with that if you are. Don’t feel too bad Dean, I usually don’t talk as freely with people either, but the feeling of being safe with you makes me more willing to share my thoughts.” Dean smiled again and leaned into Cas. For a moment Cas just enjoyed the feeling of Dean’s weight pressed into his side, but soon enough he found himself fighting sleep once again.
“Dean. There is one over here.” Dean walked over to Cas while dodging some of the crystals hanging from the ceiling in the New Age-y shop one of the kids they’d passed had tipped them off about. Cas had stopped trying to restrain his smile, he was enjoying how much fun Dean seemed to be having playing this silly game.
“Thank you, Dean. It’s usually not this bad, but between whatever the Bizzaro-witch did to my back and the magic suppressing cuffs I feel more drained than usual.” Dean was concerned about Cas mentioning something being done to his back, but figured he’d say something if he hadn’t been able to heal himself. Dean polished off his burger and got up to paw through his duffle bag.
“Cas is fine, just drained. I’ll let him explain later, I’m not getting into the middle of magical nerd stuff with you two.” Actually, Dean felt that Cas’ angelic nature was his story to tell, it wasn’t up to Dean to share that with anyone else. “Anyway, Gabe got to us at the diner. He’s not driving his car, so don’t worry about that.”
“Now, but we should go outside to the rooftop. I will require space for this. You may want to get a coat and your boots. I believe it is still snowing.” Dean passes the potion bottle to Cas with an eager grin, and rejoins the angel with his coat and shoes in record time. Cas feels his excitement build as he leads the man he loves to the rooftop where Sam had helped him work on this gift only days before.
“Cas, the binding thing sounds messed up. If not for me, you wouldn’t have lost it in the first place. Let me help, man.” Dean was scowling at Cas now, but Cas matched him glare for glare.
“Hey Cas, are you okay?” When Cas looked back up into Dean’s face, he knew his eyes had teared up a bit, but he smiled fondly at Dean nonetheless.
Dean reached Cas and crouched down beside the unfairly attractive man. Dammit, Dean had to get these impulses under control, the need to start petting the very unconscious man’s hair was weirdly compelling. Sighing deeply, he took another few moments to try and better assess Cas’ condition and wasn’t encouraged when he found matted blood and bruising on his head. He remembered Sam mentioning Cas had been buried under the roof when it collapsed so it was a safe bet the guy had a concussion, and Dean was pretty sure you weren’t supposed to sleep with a concussion. Or maybe just not sleep for long? Dean wasn’t sure but he figured he should at least try to wake Cas up.
“Oh. Yeah, you’re right. Okay then, I’m bisexual and I want Cas to be my boyfriend.” Dean felt a kind of high from saying all of that out loud, as if he’d been carrying something heavy for years and he finally had the chance to put it down.
“Er – it was because of the mistletoe. The one over the window seat, and yeah, Cas wants to learn about holiday traditions and he looked kind of sad when he assumed I wouldn’t kiss him, but I wanted to, but maybe it was just the mistletoe? Now I don’t know what to -”, luckily Charlie cut Dean off.
“Hey asshole, leave my goddamn angel alone!” Dean knew the shotgun wouldn’t work against the creature but it got his attention, and with the impact to its shoulder and the stake still protruding from its ribcage the monster snarled as it barreled towards Dean. Dean was backed up against the tree as Cas turned on him with a horrified look on his face.
“Can I look? Is it okay? I don’t feel any different.” Dean sounds almost disappointed, perhaps worried that the potion did not work on him.
Cas’ wings were the most amazing thing that Dean had ever seen. At first glance, they were as back as the darkest night and as sharp as steel – warrior’s wings. That was only the surface though. As their bond settled and Dean saw Cas’ wings more and more clearly, he saw they weren’t actually black. Every color seemed to shine throughout the angel’s wings, a rainbow of colors shimmering in the light. More than that, it was like looking into the night sky. The colors of stars, nebulas, planets, and comets were all contained within Cas’ wings. As Dean looked deeper, the sharpness was lost to fluffier softness, almost as if Cas was relaxing under Dean’s gaze. Dean would never forget this first glimpse of Cas’ true form. Never before had Dean been able to visibly see how much Cas loved him, but he saw all that and more reflected in the angel’s wings.
“What are you guys talking about?” Dean looked between Cas and Gabe with confusion pinching his brow. Cas gestured at Gabe’s massive wings that should have been really hard to miss but Dean still seemed lost.
On the astral plane, Cas’ slowly healing wings curled lovingly around Dean. Cas sighed in contentment, wanting nothing more than to stay here with Dean for as long as possible. He was beginning to hope that, just maybe, Dean wanted the same thing.
“We only have one more on the list. Where haven’t we gone yet?” Castiel lifts an eyebrow as Dean pours over the small map of the historic city he’d found in the event booklet.
“So, you are trying for blackmail, clever.” Charlie rolled her eyes. “Actually, can I see the pictures?”
“Okay, okay Dean! Calm down, I’ll call Charlie and Bobby, okay? Charlie lives closer so I’ll see if I can crash at her place while I talk to her.”
“Yes, tactile communication for comfort and bonding. The PBS special on primates said it’s called grooming.” At this point Dean is laughing hard enough that he bends over to try and catch his breath.
“Why… why would he say that? He’s always chosen us over Heaven, chosen humans.” Dean started to internally panic at the idea of Cas deciding to leave one day.
“Honestly, that’s how my grandmother made it once I was old enough to pay attention to the recipe. She made he own crust before that, but none of my aunts or uncles have the recipe and all I remember is the homemade crust tasted more of butter. Oh, and it was flakier.”
“Er, actually I’m just shadowing Dr. Garth for the day, but yes, I have heard stories like yours. My sister, Anna, went through something similar. That’s why I wanted to say something to you but wasn’t sure what. Then I actually saw you and, well, you saw. I’m not really good with subtlety. I apologize if I made you uncomfortable.” Dean threw his head back with a barking laugh and Cas found himself staring at the beautiful man yet again.
“She’s telling the truth Dean; I barely had any myself.” Charlie snorted in response to Sam’s accusation.
“That’s easy enough.” Cas didn’t even warn Dean, one moment he’s standing there looking at the angel expectantly, the next he has a faceful of feathers.
“Well, they have a chocolate making event that people can sign up for. Here. This thing runs every night up until Christmas Eve.” Sam’s phone pinged and he saw Charlie had sent him the link to the Midnight Madness event. He clicked on the chocolate making link and grinned.
“It means that I would very much like to fall asleep while you keep doing exactly what you’re doing right now.” Cas enjoyed pulling another laugh from Dean, but was asleep before he heard if Dean replied.
Unfortunately for Cas, the murderous witch in question happened to walk into the room at that moment, dashing any of the healer’s hopes that this was just some sort of Halloween movie-induced dream. There was no way his mind would have come up with the Mary Poppins lookalike that strode into the root cellar. The woman looked like she’d be more at home running a PTA bake sale than tossing what looked like chopped up brain bits into the gurgling cauldron, but here they were. Castiel dry heaved at the sight, once again barely managing to keep down whatever he’d eaten last. The choking noise had Bizzarro-Mary Poppins turning around to look in his direction.
“Okay. Do you want to do something then? Try another pie recipe? We still have peaches.” Cas’ smile widened. Now that Dean thought about it, he hadn’t ever seen Cas smile as much as he had been recently. Dean smiled back, happy that maybe his plan was working and Cas was beginning to feel more like he belonged here with them. With him, a small voice in the back of Dean’s mind insisted.
Later that night, after grabbing burgers at a drive thru, they poured through the case notes together hoping to find something they had been missing. Dean didn’t even remember falling asleep until he woke up to Cas rolling him onto a pillow and laying a blanket on him. He mumbled a drowsy thank you and sunk into a dreamless slumber.
“Uhh, well, there’s kinda a reason but – I’m, um – I…” Dean didn’t really know what he was trying to say here, he just knew he felt all twisted in knots over the kiss last night and what it meant, or didn’t mean. Charlie took pity on him.
“Yeah, Singer’s Salvage Yard, my sorta Uncle Bobby’s place.” Gabe placed a hand on Dean’s head, first pulling out the information of the location he’d mentioned, and then flying them just outside of the house he’d seen in Dean’s mind. Dean stumbled as they landed.
Somewhere in the back of Dean’s mind he worried that the amazing man in his passenger seat would eventually see the fucked-up Dean, the guy who’d decided to abandon his own father to protect his little brother. The man who’d spent years burying himself in hunting supernatural creatures just to avoid having to handle any of his personal issues. That voice would grow louder, Dean was sure, but in the meantime, Dean preferred to be the guy who’d woken up to a feather tattooed man turned koala, having attached himself to Dean after they’d both fallen asleep next to one another the previous night. As far as Dean was concerned, that guy had it made and he’d try to be that version of himself for as long as he could manage.
“Don’t worry about Bobby, he’s just updating my brother on the situation and then he’s going to go get my car. Answer the question.”
“Not exactly. She said it had to be the specific tree that grew out of the grave. She also said it wouldn’t be enough by itself. I’m looking at the spell now.” Dean decided to leave Cas to it and work on getting their gear together. It was still a vampire after all, even if it was some sort of mutant version.
Since the Harvest festival they’d only managed to meet up for coffee a few times, but they had a date planned for tonight. Dean had asked Cas what his favorite baked treat was and Cas had immediately responded with peach pie. Dean had then brought Cas a slice of his bakery’s peach pie while Cas was studying one night and while Cas had enjoyed it, he’d eventually confessed that he’d meant his grandmother’s recipe when he’d talked about it earlier. That had led to Dean insisting Cas share the baked good that was better than his peach pie and Cas had agreed to get a hold of the recipe.
“Okay, so you said the second spell is one you already knew would work. You want to try the first one and see if it works?”
Once Sam left, all Dean had was the memories of his family to keep him together. He applied for a small business loan and used nostalgia to keep moving forward through the ache of loneliness. He kept telling himself that his family hadn’t abandoned him. Death took his parents, and his brother was an adult now and needed to live his own life. Sam had even tried to get Dean to move with him, and possibly that was another downside of nostalgia – Dean wanted to stay in the place where he grew up. The place where his mother had lived and Dean had, for the briefest of times, felt happy and safe.
“No. I mean I know some things he likes – like bees.” Sam snorted. “But I want to show him that I really do, er, value his friendship, y’know?” Dean was skirting around the idea that he wanted to show Cas that he valued him, just his presence in his life. Who was he kidding? He wanted to show Cas he was loved, but without actually saying it. Dean wasn’t even sure angels could be in love. There was a reason Dean kept his feelings buried, and it wasn’t just because he couldn’t imagine an angel, an actual freaking angel, loving someone like him. Sam just looked thoughtful.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised. Still, it’s kinda concerning.” Dean fidgeted with the bedspread as Cas tried to work out what exactly was bothering the man.
“Right, right. Sheesh, no appreciation for the art of suspense here, tough audience. Anyway, I wasn’t joking kiddo, you’re not fully human. Your mom, well your Grace donor more accurately, was an angel. That feather for Anna? I embedded one of her actual feathers when I made the sigil for her. The sigil for me? That’s mine.” Cas weighed Gabe’s words carefully. His uncle seemed to be sincere, and it’s not that Cas didn’t seem to be sporting some very angelic looking wings.
Dean didn’t care for Gabriel’s accusatory tone, but he could understand that the guy was stressed about whatever was going on with his nephew. Dean gazed worriedly at Cas, and then took a deep breath before telling Gabe what had happened to them over the past two days. Gabe was obviously pissed that Cas had been dragged into any of this and Dean found himself reluctantly impressed at the guy’s ability to refrain from jumping in with interruptions. It didn’t last once Dean got to Cas discovering the back tattoos last night.
“Sam? Can you grab my clothes and hand ‘em to me?” Dean heard a muffled acknowledgement of his shouted request and a few moments later there was a knock on the door. Dean thanked his brother and got dressed quickly, all the while trying to calm himself down. He heard the outside door open and shut and thought that maybe everyone else had already headed down to breakfast. He was starving at this point and figured he should follow.
“Unfortunately, we aren’t at liberty to discuss the details of the case, but we’d appreciate anything you can tell us about this tree Mrs. Paige, or the woman who was killed, Louisa Abbot.”
“Well, Thanksgiving isn’t exactly picking out curtains together. If it makes you feel any better, I don’t really know how fast something like this is supposed to move anyway. Maybe we can both just make it up as we go?” Cas turns his head towards the hand that’s now cupping his face and kisses Dean’s palm softly. Dean responds by pulling Cas closer, until they are close enough to touch their noses together.
“Well, if you don’t have other plans, would you like to come over my place for Thanksgiving? Only my brother Gabe will be there, and maybe his girlfriend, Kali, if they aren’t on one of their break-up phases, but I can promise decent food and drinks.”
“Of course, I want you around! Honestly, sweetheart, even if I’m working, you’re more than welcome to come study at the bakery. I know it’s been pretty crowded as the holidays get closer, but in the spring the table by the window would make a great homework spot.”
“Cas. I need to know something, because I don’t want there to be any miscommunication here.” Castiel waits for several minutes as Dean works to find the words he needs. “You say you’re giving me a part of yourself, that it will become a part of me. That sounds like, well, more than a friendship to me. And I’d like to know if I’m getting that right.”
“Uh – sorry? My bad man.” If possible, this seemed to make Cas even madder. He turned his back on Dean and went over to Sam and the Yeti corpse. Dean just stood there for a moment feeling like an idiot. Then he headed over to help the two of them get rid of the body.
“Sorry, sorry, this is all,” Dean moved his hands to try and encompass the enormity of the feelings building inside of him. “A lot.” Charlie just nodded and slid back to the other side of the table as one of the staff members brought over plates of blueberry French toast goodness. Food, something Dean could focus on. Dean smiled gratefully as the same staff member filled up his coffee mug. For a little while they ate in silence enjoying the rich and syrupy food in peace. Finally, Dean felt like he had a handle on things and decided asking for help wasn’t the worst idea.
His human friends all ate dinner quickly while Cas stole a few fries just to get Dean to look at him. He could tell Dean felt awkward about what happened in the restaurant, and because Dean felt awkward, Cas felt it as well. He didn’t know what had come over him but he would try to restrain himself a bit more in the future. Even so, he had thought that Dean had leaned into the kiss as well. Cas rolled his shoulders to dispel some of the tingling sensation of his grace running through his wings. They had pulsed again when he and Dean had almost – well, if nothing else Dean’s first look at Castiel’s wings would be more impressive with how much they had healed.
“Yes, Uncle, what does that mean and what exactly is going on here anyway? And why are there feathers everywhere? Wait, do I have wings??” A panicked look crossed over Cas’ face and his wings flapped and he was obviously struggling to regain his balance. Concerned that he’d hurt himself more, Dean helped Cas sit up on the couch.
Switching to the hastily made Devil’s trap ammo, Dean started firing every shot he could into the advancing demon. Cockily, the demon didn’t bother taking cover and Dean thanked any benevolent being out there in the universe that Sam spent his free time reading Grandpa Henry’s journals because the third slug must have had an unbroken sigil. The demon stopped in his tracks and fell over.
Thanks for reading. In case you're wondering, Cas' not-pie is actually something my grandmother used to make. It's a crust spread out on a baking pan with sliced peaches on top. The peaches are then covered in cinnamon, sugar, and butter and then baked in the oven. It's amazing and delicious and I refuse to call it anything other than peach pie even though everyone outside my family has informed me it is not pie!
“I – wow Cas… I see you. Your wings. They’re fucking beautiful.” Castiel hesitates for a moment, but allows the wondering lilt to Dean’s voice to sooth his doubts. He turns slowly to see Dean looking at him as if he’d never seen anything better in his life. This look, more than anything, undoes the knots of worry in the angel’s chest and he smiles broadly and unfurls his wings a bit, stretching them towards the stars. A rush of joy runs through his body as he takes in the awe on Dean’s face and the way he reaches out for Castiel without trepidation. Cas takes his outstretched hand and gently pulls him closer.
However, with only 5 days left until Christmas, Sam had managed to kick Dean out of the bunker so he could focus on helping Cas with his spell. Dean had a lot of shopping to do anyway, and the stores were sure to be crowded enough to keep him out for hours. The streets were pretty snowy as well, and Dean couldn’t drive as fast as he normally would in the Impala because of it. Sam went looking for Cas in the library.
“What is Charlie doing?” Dean glanced behind him at Sam and Charlie’s table. By the time he looked Charlie seemed to have quickly put away her phone. Dean shrugged.
“Alright. If nothing else I agree we should find a gift for Charlie.” Dean grinned and bumped his shoulder on Cas.
Dean figured two hours of driving had put them far enough away that it was relatively safe to stop. He’d seen Cas fighting off sleep earlier, and had a feeling that his passenger needed a decent night’s rest after all he’d been through that day. Pulling into a nondescript motel parking lot, Dean stopped at the front office and put his car in park. Asking Cas to wait a moment, Dean took care of securing a room for them that didn’t face the roadway. Dean found himself grateful for the stop as he pulled into an empty parking space near their room. While he was used to being able to drive for hours on end, something about today had drained him. On top of confronting members of the group responsible for his mother’s death, worrying about his brother, and literally running miles through the wilderness, Dean found himself dwelling on the strange pull he felt towards Cas more and more. In the deepest parts of his mind Dean admitted that spending some quiet time with the intriguing healer was a big part of why he wanted to stop for the night.
“Well, you got to pick me. You were just stuck with Dean,” Charlie teased. “Anyway, I’m getting us all tickets to the chocolate making thing. Dean can’t say no if it’s a Christmas gift from me and I kind of want to see this new Christmasy Dean for myself. There’s a restaurant and bar called The Phoenix Emporium; we can meet there.” Sam wrote down the bar’s name and address looking forward to having someone to plot against Cas and Dean with (for their own good, of course).
“Okay, okay, can we stop for just a goddamned minute here? Is Cas gonna be okay?” Gabe stopped sifting through Cas’ wing and folded it carefully back inwards.
“Yeah, we could probably make it work. I’m not sure until I try though, you’re much more powerful than the last time I did this. You should also know, there’s no way you’d be unaware this time. Binding an angel’s wings is a punishment reserved for angels who are deemed traitors to our kind. Once you’ve experienced your angelic nature – and make no mistake Cassie, you have now with that healing display – you’ll feel like you’re missing an essential part of yourself. It’s like losing the ability to see in color, or missing a limb. That’s part of the reason I never told you, if you had known about the binding you would have started to experience the constricting nature of it.” Cas frowned, and barely noticed when Dean pushed Cas’ hand away so he could talk.
“I will watch over you when you fall asleep Dean, and I would enjoy doing that while sharing your bed. I would also like to try doing this in my new bed at some point. With my bee pillow.” Dean snorts and Cas smiles happily, wondering what he was so afraid of in the first place. When they reach the room, Dean closes the door behind him and strips down to his boxers, looking at Cas questioningly. Cas mirrors Dean’s actions and then joins him under the covers.
“He was born human, died, and was then infused with angelic grace. The angel whose grace was used got him to me and sacrificed herself to save him. He’s not really Nephilim, he’s something new. C’mon, Rowena, help me out here. I stabilized the angelic side, but the human soul is still so fragile. I’m worried the grace will burn it out.” Gabe gave Rowena his best pleading face. He knew she was fond of him and he also knew she had a bit of a soft spot for children (well, except her own son, better to avoid that topic). While the scowl remained on her face, he could see something soften in her eyes. Finally, after several long minutes, she threw her hands up in exasperation and started walking up the stairs to the main floor.
Cas feels a rush of bliss and his grace warms his wings as he feels more feathers push into existence. He leans into the kiss and wraps his free arm around Dean’s neck as the hand cupping Dean’s faces slides up into his hair. Dean opens his mouth and Cas dives in, the sensation of their tongues touching better than anything Cas could have imagined, although Dean’s hands on his bare waist place at a close second. Too quickly, Dean pulls back to breathe and takes a small step back before Cas can drag him back for more.
Wiggling his ass in an extremely undignified manner Castiel managed to get the cuffs under his hips and then past his feet. He allowed himself a brief moment to enjoy the relief he felt in his minor accomplishment as he returned to an upright position. His arms were uncomfortable as they adjusted to the normal flow of blood but he needed to put them to work immediately. Clumsily shoving the hood off of his face, Cas blinked rapidly trying to force his eyes into compensating for the sudden rush of light.
Vaguely he registered additional shots and noticed he was running in the direction of the shooter, but the closer he got to the thrumming the more everything else was drowned out. For just a moment, as Castiel saw the man firing shots at the coven thugs, he felt like he could fly. There was a wrenching pain on his back and Cas had a brief view of shocked green eyes as blackness overcame him.
“Of course not, Dean. Hurry up.” Dean rolls his eyes fondly at Cas and skips the ribbon to just tear off the paper. He lets the paper fall to the floor and stares at the small potion bottle as his brow furrows in confusion.
The brothers managed to make it before the snow monster had caught up with them. The station was right by a rather steep hill and was surrounded by trees on most sides. Dean quickly accessed the area as Sam reloaded his handgun. Dean started to push the bookshelf over to help block the door.
“Y’know Sam, I’m not sure we have to do all that much here. Dean asked me to find out what the scavenger hunt thing going on was, and then I heard him asking Cas if he wanted to do it.” Sam’s jaw dropped.
Cas is somewhat relieved to be dropped off at the cemetery. While Dean hadn’t reacted poorly to being draped in an angel wing this morning, or the fact that Cas was asleep in the same bed, he couldn’t help feeling that he had been pushing things too far. He hadn’t meant to fall asleep while also solidifying his wings. He needed to conserve his grace for more important tasks. While Castiel was truly content to just be a part of Dean’s life it was difficult to remind himself that he could not have more, especially with his poor control over the very human-like emotions he now experienced. What was really tipping him over the edge though, was how Dean kept reacting. Dean did not react with anger or defensiveness when he found himself in situations that hinted of a more intimate relationship with Cas. He acted as if it were normal and even welcome. It surprised Cas, but it also gave him some of the hope that he had never really allowed himself to have. It was distracting, which made it all the better that he would be prepping the spell by himself.
Cas pulled up to the still lit windows of Winchester’s Pies and Pastries in his beat-up Chevy Cobalt. The car was a bit of a lemon but Cas was attached to it as it had been his constant companion since leaving home for college. He smiled as he locked the car door, recalling how Dean had tried for all of five minutes to refrain from criticizing it. Looking up at the bakery windows Cas shivers in anticipation of finally having a night alone with the man he’s rapidly become infatuated with. He eagerly strides up to the door, texting as he walks to let Dean know he’s arrived.
“Do you see anything you want, Cas?” For one insane moment Cas almost said - yes, you. Clearing his throat to cover up his near miss Cas stumbled over his words.
“You seem to be thinking hard. It’s too early in the morning for that, Dean.” Dean grinned at Cas’ grouchy morning voice. Cas had become human enough to need sleep and so far, waking up was high on the list of the angel’s least favorite mortal experiences. Dean continued to create a trail of shimmering ripples as he carded his hands in the soft feathers, increasing the pressure of his fingers now that he knew his husband was awake.
“Go on, you can have ‘em. We can always order pizza if you need more fuel from all that magical healing you had to pull off earlier.” Cas gave Dean a stunning and grateful smile as he enthusiastically pulled Dean’s fries closer.
“Bindings? What are you doing?” Dean curled in closer to Cas as the healer started making pained noises. Dean glowered at Gabe, suspecting his manhandling of the wings had something to do with Cas’ discomfort.
“Um, and, I’m really sorry about this doc, but I probably can’t afford the bill for today’s services right away.”
“I’m thinking of the day Jack bound us more closely together. About seeing you, I guess in some ways for the first time. You’re so damn beautiful, sweetheart. You shine like every goddamned star in the universe all rolled in together.” Cas’ shining blue eyes locked with Dean’s, and Dean gasped as he saw the love contained there.
“I do like bees, yes.” Castiel attempted to maintain a solemn expression but this was ruined when he looked down at the mug again, feeling new feathers forming as his grace pulsed behind him once again. Dean reached across and touched Cas’ arm for just a moment.
“Uh, don’t babies need, like, other stuff?” The glare that Rowena turned towards Gabe would have turned lesser creatures to stone. It was clear that the idea had just occurred to Gabriel that human babies needed more than just air to survive.
While Dean planned for family game night, his mind was also mulling over the almost kiss that Sam and Charlie had interrupted. Dean could have sworn that Cas had also been leaning in towards him, but in part of Dean’s mind that just didn’t make sense. The idea that Cas could have actually wanted to kiss him was just too much. While Dean would be happy to kiss Castiel, he’d only rarely known Cas to have shown any interest in kissing anyone. Meg, April, and he vaguely recalled something about Hannah. Even if Cas had wanted to kiss him, did it mean the same thing it would have meant to Dean? Dean himself wouldn’t have been so ready to kiss Castiel not all that long ago, not until he had slowly begun to realize that it was okay for him to want to kiss guys. Well, not really guys so much as his best friend specifically, but he had always ignored it when he had been attracted to guys in the past. Charlie had been the one to call him on it, to mention more than once that Dean was a little bit too knowledgeable about how to flirt with a guy. While Dean hadn’t actually spoken to anyone, seeing Charlie so comfortable in her own sexuality and then seeing Claire falling for Kaia – it had helped. It had helped even more to see that no one he cared about thought twice about Charlie or Claire’s choices in partners.
“Wait. Just a sec, Cas. Here, I want you to put this on me.” Cas’ eyes widen with surprise and joy, and he thinks that the kissing can wait for just a moment. He takes the chain and pulls the pendant over Dean’s head. Dean pulls his layers away from his neck just enough for Cas to drop the pendant below his undershirt to rest close to Dean’s heart.
“Dean. Can I touch you with my wings?” Dean’s eyes widen just a bit but he nods his head in agreement. Castiel pulls his wings in and up until he is cradling Dean and they are in a shelter created by his plumage. Dean directs his gaze around the impromptu cocoon and runs his hand lightly over more feathers as they minutely shift in color against a background of darkness.
“Anna, I don’t know what I can do for it. The baby doesn’t have enough grace to finish balancing out the growing soul.” Honestly, Gabriel wasn’t sure he should be saving the child. If he survived and Azazel got ahold of him it could be catastrophic.
So, Dean had sucked it up and let her lead the way through the Christmas lit streets of the historic town. He had to admit that the town was a great location for Christmas events. The old stone buildings were dripping with colorful lights and there were lit candles in most of the windows. He was happy to see how Cas was looking around with a small smile on his face as he watched a family take their children to different stores looking at the windows and checking something off of a list. Dean looked around and noticed there were a lot of people carrying around the same list. They must have some sort of scavenger hunt going on. He caught Charlie’s sleeve to get her attention.
“Are you alright Sam?” Dean heard his brother let out a high-pitched laugh that was just shy of sounding manic.
They had unexpectedly spent the morning at the morgue. There was another strange death last night, something had eaten the victim’s spleen. They’d only received a call about it because the original victim, Louisa, had also been missing her spleen along with several other organs and most of her blood. If it was the same creature it certainly seemed to enjoy the bloodier organs of the body. The only other thing the victims had in common was proximity to the cemetery. The most recent victim had visited the cemetery the previous day according to her wife.
He vaguely heard a conversation about witches, demons, and Cas saving Dean’s life going on in the background, but really Gabe didn’t have the time to worry about human problems. Cassie’s wings were more beautiful than ever, too full, and completely unbound. Why hadn’t his Grace already used up his soul? It didn’t make sense; his soul was weakening but with the way Cassie’s wings were radiating power Gabe shouldn’t have been in time to help.
Ever since Castiel’s brief time as a human he’s found that the emotions he’d been slowly acquiring over the years have amplified at a rate that he has had difficulty adjusting to. He’d hoped at the beginning that regaining his grace would have given him back some of the control that had spiraled away from him, but he can’t help but dwell on almost losing Dean.
“What’s wrong with Cas? I thought you said you guys were alright? And when did Gabe get there? It’s unlikely his car is safe right now either.”
“It’s alright Dean. I was just surprised. They were manifested more than I intended and the sensation of you touching them was unexpected.”
“No.” Sam peeked into the box Dean had just opened as it was pushed aside into what he imagined was Dean’s junk pile. It was full of smaller boxes. Sam pulled one out and laughed. They were tree ornaments, and really ugly ones at that. Dean just continued to pull more boxes out, but looking at the hideous ornaments Sam realized with a start that it was almost Christmas. Maybe Sam had more than one idea of how to cheer his brother up.
“Hell-o, gorgeous! Well, confusing story short, I need help. With, uh, this.” Gabe sheepishly nodded to the squirming infant. Rowena looked nothing less than horrified.
Castiel couldn’t remember a time when he had felt happier. In all fairness, he had spent most of his existence without feeling much emotion at all, but this was different than even the brief moments of satisfaction he had experienced in more recent years. When they reached the Wayside Inn Cas agreed with the ‘quaint’ assessment. It was a stone inn from the 1800s. They had already been relatively packed by the time Sam and Charlie were looking for rooms, so all four of them were sharing one of the larger suites. There was a large window seat that Cas found appealing as he could watch as the snow fell and muffled all of the outdoor noise. He especially liked how the Christmas lights reflected off of the powdery white snow drifts.
“Okay Dean. Okay.” Much to Dean’s disappointment, Cas took a step back and rubbed his hands roughly over his own face. Something must have showed in Dean’s expression because Cas leaned back in to give Dean another quick hug before saying that he’d be finished in a minute, and herding Dean out of the bathroom.
“I don’t think that’s gonna kill it man. We’ve already unloaded two clips into that thing, just made it madder.” Dean looked around for anything else to barricade the door but there wasn’t a whole lot in here and he doubted the Yeti would be slowed down by much.
“Dean?” Cas’ beautiful rough voice snapped Dean out of his reverie. He was relieved to see his friend’s bleary blue eyes blinking up at him.
“I’ll admit I enjoy being close to you Dean, but I’m also curious as to the nature of our bond. Maybe we can take anything like kissing out of the equation for now, until we get to know each other a little bit better?”
“Cas.” Castiel sighed. It was never easy with Dean. He walked up to the man he loved and placed a hand on his shoulder. Castiel expected Dean to shrug it off but Dean just stilled and stood up to look at the angel.
Castiel was shaken from his thoughts as the car started to shake. He caught a whiff of smoke and then the car came to a grinding halt. The coven thugs started to curse and Cas tensed, listening carefully to try and figure out what had happened.
“She thinks Louisa was trying to make her own vampire. Ties of blood are necessary for control and the age of the corpse increases the power of the risen dead in a ritual like this. Rowena said that no one tries this type of thing though, because the amount of power and control needed are astronomical. She said she wouldn’t try it herself, that there are easier ways to get a loyal servant. Then she said something about how maybe Louisa didn’t have the ‘assets’ Rowena had?” Dean broke into laughter and Cas tilted his head in puzzlement. Dean always enjoyed Cas’ air quotes.
After purchasing toothbrushes, toothpaste, and various other essentials, Charlie had dragged Cas away for what she had said was a secret mission. Dean had shrugged, willing to give their adopted sister whatever she wanted, and then he assigned Sam to waiting in the long 4 shopping days left until Christmas line while he wandered off to the toy section of the store. Dean snagged the Scooby-Doo themed Clue game, thinking it would be nice to have a family board game night while they were snowed in. He would have gotten some beer as well, but this was one of those places that only allowed separate liquor stores to sell alcohol. He decided to get apple cider and some plastic cups instead as he figured if their suite had a stove or even a microwave, he could make it work with some cinnamon sticks.
“Are you okay, Cas? I mean, besides the whole you had a roof fall on your head and were captured by evil witches.” Dean’s lips tipped up into a small smile as Cas let out a surprised huff of laughter at the statement. Cas pulled his hands away from his shoulders and turned his gaze towards his unexpected companion.
“Sam asked me to get a box of ornaments?” Castiel looked at the piles not sure where to start. Dean looked questioningly at the angel and dug out one of the bottom boxes and passed it to Cas.
“That’s fucking genius Sam! I gotta go!” Dean hung up on Sam and popped the trunk. Digging out some ammo he realized he wouldn’t be able to actually etch anything, so he hoped a sharpie would work and that the part of the bullet he could draw on wouldn’t get warped from firing or impact in such a way that if broke the sigil. Dean figured he’d make as many as he could in the next five minutes and hope at least a few of them worked as intended.
“Don’t stop on my account Cassie, it’s about time you got some action..” Cas, if possible, turned even redder as Dean tried to hold in his own laughter. While Cas seemed to struggle with speechlessness, Gabe turned his attention back to Dean. “You two are definitely soul compliments by the way.”
“You said the potion would only work for a day. I want to see your wings for as long as I can.” Cas laughs at the pouting expression on Dean’s face as he grabs his pajama top and switches off the lights.
Cas needed to push more power into the spell, he was losing Dean! Frustrated and desperate beyond belief, Cas instinctively reached out for any available power source and found something he’d never experienced before. There was an undercurrent to the thrum that connected Dean to Cas, something bright, beautiful, and pulsing with raw energy. Souls! Of course, Rowena said that souls were a wellspring of power. Cas couldn’t use Dean’s soul though, he wasn’t that kind of witch, and he wouldn’t do that without Dean’s permission, but… Cas had a soul as well.
“I think I know how to stabilize him. There’s a temporary solution and a long-term solution. Temporarily, you’ll need to subdue his grace as much as possible. It will keep his grace from burning out the human soul. Long-term, he needs to bind his grace to a second soul, and a powerful soul at that.” Gabe took the seat across from Rowena and stared at the baby for a few moments in contemplation.
“Dean, just talk to Meg. We will figure something out. At least promise me you’ll take the Humira every other week. I know it didn’t manage your symptoms well at the lower dose before, but it was still better than letting the RA go untreated.”
“Cas… this is, at best, a very large peach tart. It’s not a pie!” Cas rolled his eyes and continued to add large amounts of butter on top of the sliced peaches.
He frowned at what remained of Anna. He wished he had time to honor her death properly but centuries of experience hiding from heaven had taught him he couldn’t linger here. Azazel would be looking for Anna and the child and his time masquerading as Loki had taught him many ways of remaining below the radar. Continuing to soothe the now sleepy infant, Gabe set the scene. He made a grace-built replica of the baby and placed it by Anna. He used his power to start a fire that he hoped would make it appear like Anna’s dying grace had exploded to anyone who may have been hunting the two escapees. Without a backwards glance Gabe flew off with his new charge to one of his many safe houses. He needed help, and there was one witch who had just as much of a reason to hide from Heaven as little Castiel did.
“You’re far from a boring old human Dean, I think you’re Cassie here’s soul compliment. Rowena would know more but, play along for a second here, can you touch his wings?” Dean looked confused, but was wondering the same thing himself, although he didn’t know what Gabe meant by ‘soul compliment’.
“Wow, Cas. I can see them – well the projection at least.” Castiel curled his wings in front of him to examine them. He seemed mildly surprised by something. “Is there something wrong Cas?”
“Nothing. They don’t show up on the picture. Can’t say I’m surprised, but it was worth a shot.” Dean sat back down on the bed behind Cas and was silent for several long minutes. Cas assumed that Dean was examining whatever was going on with his back.
“I agree. I’d also like more information on the tree. I know it’s a type of elm, but I’m not sure of the significance, if there is any.”
“There ya go, Cas. Nose smudge eliminated.” Dean winked at Castiel. He wasn’t even that surprised when the angel returned the favor, softly wiping the chocolate from Dean’s ear. Cas kept staring at Dean the whole time. Dean gave the angel another quick smile and finished cleaning up their station, wondering for just a moment what was going on between him and his best friend. Dean decided that he was just going to go along with it for now, he’d try to actually figure it out later. Or possibly never. Either way, he wasn’t going to screw up the awesome night they were having so far.
“Dean, it’s right behind you!” Impulsively, Dean spun his lid around so he was now speeding down towards the road backwards. Hoping he didn’t hit a tree he managed to pull his gun out and shoot at the rampaging monster. Not that he managed to hit it more than once.
“Fuck!” This was a terrible plan; the service road was coming up on them fast as Dean spotted a car turning the corner. He wasn’t sure if crashing into a tree, getting mauled by a Yeti, or hit by an incoming car was a better way to go out. Meanwhile the Yeti was still chasing them.
“Wow, yeah, I don’t think we want to be driving in that. Especially since the Impala isn’t exactly the best car for snow. An actual blizzard, huh?”
“Sure.” Charlie handed her phone over to Sam. He took a few moments to look through them with a grin growing across his face.
They eventually made their way back to the car and drove through the light display. Maybe they should have talked about the case, but Dean didn’t want to ruin the moment. Cas gazed out at the decorations with a look of quiet contentment on his face and Dean reached for the angel’s hand without thinking about it. Cas threaded his fingers through Dean’s without even turning away from the window.
Cas didn’t actually care what they were making. Dean had seemed shocked when Cas said he wasn’t familiar with peppermint, so they began working through the instructions on how to make something called peppermint bark. All Cas cared about was how easily Dean was laughing. How often Dean put himself into Cas’ space when it used to be Dean who would lecture the angel about personal space. What Cas really couldn’t stop thinking about was how Dean had told him that he’d found the only angel that mattered when looking at Cas. Cas couldn’t be completely sure what Dean meant by saying that, but he did know that the words had swept through him in a rush of warmth and joy.
“I assumed if you guys weren’t okay you would have told me, Dean. Anyway, Charlie’s been working on covering Cas’ tracks, but the Demons actually sent people into town to ask around about him. It wasn’t hard for them to figure out the connection to me; Cas and I hang out together all the time. Honestly, I’m not even sure it’s just about Cas anymore. The Winchester name is already known to the Demons, Dad’s been openly hunting their leader for years.” Dean supposed he shouldn’t be surprised, as far as the Demon Coven was concerned going after an unusual supe and a hunter family at the same time was probably like getting two birds with one stone.
“Hey, look, there are lights up here too!” Dean gestures to the string lights propped up on tall stands around the edges of the rooftop. Castiel knows Sam must have put them up and wonders how Sam knew he’d end up doing this at night. Cas silently thanks his friend for the forethought. Dean follows one of the strands back to its source to find the on switch and suddenly the rooftop is softly lit with tiny imitations of the stars in the sky. Cas silently hands the potion back to Dean. It feels as if words aren’t needed in this moment, and Dean must feel it as well. He acts rather than speaking and throws back the potion as if it were a shot.
“Mmm, alright, carry on with the thinking.” Cas let out a long and contented hum, deep enough that Dean privately thought his angel was purring.
“Of course it hurts, look at the feathers here Dean-o, that bitch witch hurt him when she sunk her hands into the binding I put on him. Fuck, most witches can’t tell there’s anything there. Your brother and I are going to have some words about dragging Cassie into such a dangerous situation.”
“We should go to Charlie’s chocolate class first, then we can look for other traditions to try.” Dean readily agreed and they hurried to catch up with the others.
Lost in the feeling, Cas was startled by the sound of a gunshot. He saw the human thug throw himself to the side of the car, presumably to get away from the shooter. Shaking himself free from his shock, Cas surged forward. He hit the lock release, pulled back, and threw himself out the door and took off running. He followed the thrumming, not knowing what it was but some deeply buried instinct telling him that the feeling was something important. Somehow Cas knew that there was some essential part of himself hidden in the woods and that he needed to find it.
“You’re talking about soul mates. He’ll have to find the one person in the world who’s a match for his grace formed soul. Does that even exist?”
“Yeah, Cas, I’ll survive. Is Dean okay? What did you shoot the Yeti with?” Dean could see Cas’ mouth turn down into a frown. So pretty, Dean just wanted to touch his face.
Now all Dean had to do was to get up the nerve to actually talk to Cas, but he figured taking him out to see Christmas movies in a historic theater was as good a starting point as any.
Dean ignored any further taunts from the demon, and realized it would be better to leave him here than try and banish the fucker back to hell. Even if the human host was still alive, he would just be exchanging a demon for an evil witch willing to sell himself to a demon for power, so really, he’d have nothing to gain by performing an exorcism. The longer he was stuck here the more of a head start Dean would have.
“Dean! We could use that plan anytime now!” Dean ran out the back door pulling Sam with him towards the hill. It was steeper than he remembered but he only hesitated for an instant. He threw the lid on the ground in front of him.
They were about an hour out from Bobby’s place by lunch time, and decided to stop at the diner they spotted on the way into town. Pulling into the mostly empty parking lot, Dean idly wondered what kind of pie the place would have as he got out of the car. Distracted, he didn’t see the cement block rocketing towards him until it was too late.
“Only other angelic beings can see angel wings unless we purposely manifest them. Some other creatures can sense them, and the rare human that can withstand our true visage can see echoes of them. Like prophets and such. We can mask ‘em from one another like I’ve been doing for ages, but it takes a long time to learn that kind of control. I have no idea why Dean-o here can see yours Cassie, I’d guess it has something to do with the ‘profound bond’ you lovebirds have going on, but Rowena would know more than I do about that.” Cas frowned at Gabe.
“Cas!” Castiel caught up to Dean a few moments later. “We should do this.” Dean pointed to the event page. Cas gave Dean an all to rare laugh when he saw what Dean was showing him.
“I don’t know what is wrong with you, or the woman who contacted you, but I’m just a witch. From what I’ve heard about the head of your coven, your boss won’t be too happy if you bring him a run of the mill supe.” Castiel knew there was no way to convince them to leave him here, but it didn’t mean he’d go with them without at least trying to get away. The man ignored Cas completely as he waved his hand, unlocking the cage.
A quick trip for formula and bottles was easy enough. Gabriel left Rowena to feed the not-a- Nephilim while he found a poor unsuspecting baby store employee to explain what infants need to survive. It was over two hours later when Gabriel returned with a pack-and-play and other necessary supplies in something the clerk had called a diaper bag. Rowena had placed a now sleeping Castiel into a large woven basket that smelled of dried herbs and was absentmindedly rocking the makeshift bassinet with her foot while pouring over an old tome.
“Shh, Anna, tell me what happened.” Gabriel tried to heal some of the damage done to Anna but was horrified to see that her grace had been damaged, possibly beyond his ability to help. As he tried to assess the extent of her injuries the bundle in her arms began to move and the blanket fell away to reveal a human infant. Gabriel sucked in a shocked breath as he noticed the baby’s eyes flickering with pieces of both grace and human soul. “Anna, I can’t help if you don’t tell me what’s going on. Where did this Nephilim come from and why is your grace so badly depleted?”
“I can do that. I brought all the ingredients; I didn’t know what’d you’d have at your house.” Dean reluctantly pulled away from Cas to peek in the grocery bag.
“See? You’re thrumming. It’s more intense when you touch me.” Dean tries to pull his hand back, worried he had hurt Castiel, but Cas grabs his hand and keeps it in place. “Can’t you feel that?”
But then came Cas with his sky-blue eyes and messy brown hair, barreling into Dean’s life as an unexpected breath of good things here in the present. Suddenly Dean’s attachment to his past seemed less important. Dean wanted to live in the here and now, he wanted to build something more for himself with Cas by his side.
Sam was worrying more and more about Dean. He knew his brother said he understood why Mom needed her space, but Dean was withdrawing more and more. When they weren’t on a hunt Dean found all sorts of projects around the bunker that required manual labor. The last few days his brother had only communicated with one-word responses and only when Sam asked him a direct question. Sam had been relieved when Cas texted him that he was on the way to them, Dean was always better with Cas around.
“Yeah. If I recall you were very enthusiastic about bees a few years ago.” If Castiel could get any redder out in the biting cold he would have.
True to his word, Cas encouraged touch between the two of them, but didn’t push for anything more. As much as part of Dean wanted to say ‘fuck it’ and finally get a taste of Cas’ lips (and maybe more), he was secretly relieved the more time that passed with their connection proving itself to be nothing more than a pleasant sensation of being at home with the other person. Dean did still feel a distinct desire to be close to Cas, but as the healer pointed out the night before, the impulse to touch was still a choice and could be ignored. Realizing that, Dean didn’t want to ignore it and often found himself holding hands with Cas as he drove.
“Yes, you will have control to an extent. If something else were to work at manifesting you may see it, but most of this depends on me meeting you halfway. Born psychics tend to take years to see anything substantial, much less be exposed to visions.” Dean nods seriously.
“Give me the baby, Anna. Let me see what can be done for him.” Anna looked into Gabriel’s eyes for a long moment but whatever she saw there seemed to satisfy her. She placed the child in her brother’s waiting arms, breathing a soft sigh of relief.
Dean would be gone for hours if he stuck to the plan Sam had been helping him with. Sam felt that, just maybe, things would go exactly has he hoped they would go. Dean seemed genuinely committed to treating Castiel better. Personally, Sam chalked it up to passing on Mom’s conversation with Cas’, Dean seemed to have taken the idea that Cas felt he didn’t belong here to heart.
“Clothing? Dean, I have no need to change clothes.” Castiel’s confusion is evident on his face. Dean sighs rubs the back of his neck.
“Oh, Dean. Your soul has always shone so brightly for me, I’m glad that you can now see me shining just as brightly for you.” Dean pulled his angel into another kiss, overwhelmed by the feelings of joy like he’d never known before. Here with Cas, wrapped in his wings, Dean finally knew true peace.
“Well, long story short Cassie, you’re a kind of hybrid angel and Dean-o here is your human soul mate.”
“What? Why? Rowena’s place is pretty heavily warded.” Dean huffed in annoyance, Sam sucked at taking orders, even when time was short.
“Okay, so this may sound strange, but I need you to pick up a tree. And a tree stand. And lights. Oh, and when you get here text me so I can help you sneak them in.” Sam had lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. Castiel was confused.
“I – this place is a lot like the cemetery where Mary was originally buried. I don’t like the memory of you leaving to die.” Cas looks away abruptly and climbs into the passenger seat. Dean is at a loss for words, so he doesn’t say anything at all. He drops Cas off at the library with all the things left unsaid hanging between them.
“Nothing, I’m probably overthinking things. This feeling I get around you, it’s just intense, y’know? I guess I’m worried we got caught up in something with all those jackass witches around today.” Cas nodded.
Barreling through the forest, Dean knew he didn’t have any weapon that would help him out against a demon. Of course, there was always a Devil’s trap but then he’d have to lure the guys into it. Exorcising a demon was always hit or miss if they couldn’t be restrained, so that would have to be a backup plan. Dean made it back to his parking spot without a solid idea of how to deal with a demon if Cas’ captors were actually possessed. Dean called Sam.
Now though, despite the near instantaneous travel, Gabriel was afraid he was too late. He’d not sensed the situation until Cassie had somehow managed to shred through the bindings on his Grace. So here he was, ready to assess the damage to his nephew, surveying at an ash-covered fallout zone in a neat circle around a beaten-up vintage black car. Gabriel noted that the only physical damage to the area (besides looking sooty) seemed to be from the various rocks and other debris that looked tossed around as if there had been a tornado. Oh, and the dead demon. Huh, somehow Cassie exorcised a demon from a distance while ripping through the magical bindings Gabe had placed on him. Gabe made his way towards the car when he heard a man cry out.
“Close your eyes, it only takes a moment to go into effect.” As Dean shuts his eyes Castiel pulls of his pajama shirt, draping it on one of the light stands. He inhales the sharp, cold, snow filled air and pulls on his grace. He breaths out as he shifts his much healthier wings further into the mortal realm, adjusting them to best fit his vessel’s frame. He turns away from Dean, too anxious to see his reaction right away. He keeps his wings close to his body, wanting to give his very human companion time to adjust slowly. Despite the shrouds and adjustments between him, the wings are still very much part of his true form and may be a bit overwhelming for a human.
“Well, there ya go, Cas. I’d trust Rowena over murderers and demons any day.” Cas shrugged but didn’t exactly agree with Dean. He was still worried that there was something to the Demon Coven’s claims, but, on the other hand, he did trust Rowena with his life. He decided to worry about it later, right now all he wanted to do was sleep. Cas was quiet for a few moments, thinking about having feathers on his back. It sounded familiar for some reason, and had something to do with sleeping.
“Oh, hey. We should get a picture. Go stand in front of that Christmas tree over there. Dean, hold up your bar with Cas.” Charlie took longer than Dean though was needed to make sure he and Cas were posing the way she wanted, but he wasn’t going to complain seeing how the whole night had been her idea. Some passerby even took a picture of all four of them together.
The following evening found the hunter and the angel at a place called Warm Springs Ranch. When they called Louisa’s sister, she told them she could talk during her break. The ranch ran some sort of Christmas event and Janice Abbot was one of the people in charge of it. Dean tried to play it cool, but he couldn’t help getting a bit excited over the chance to see the Budweiser Clydesdales. He did remind Cas that interrogating the horses was unnecessary to which he had received one of the angel’s full body eyerolls. Dean would never admit it out loud, but he really enjoyed Cas’ sarcasm. He thought the eyerolling was kind of adorable.
Yes, pessimism seemed the most logical response to the whole situation. Castiel concentrated on keeping a neutral expression on his face as Bizzaro-Poppins smirked at him. She soon turned and began sweeping a few important looking items into a bag, as Cas tried to maintain his composure. As much as he didn’t want to be murdered and used as a spell component by this woman, from what he had heard about the Demon Coven, that may actually be a more pleasant option than what awaited him. All too soon, she finished packing and disappeared back up the stairs.
“You’re not a witch. That young man who was with you is a witch, you are something else and I know just what to do with unique power signatures like the one you projected when you protected your companion from me.” The creepy witch murmured an incantation under her breath and threw a wave of power towards Castiel. He braced himself, but nothing happened. Bizzaro-Poppins growled in frustration. It seemed like her spell hadn’t worked.
Even with the almost kiss hanging over Castiel’s thoughts, he was enjoying himself. Dean roared with laughter when Charlie showed him the picture of Sam in reindeer antlers. He suggested that they send it to Crowley as Sam protested that a moose and a reindeer were not the same thing. Dean announced that he had gotten everyone apple cider, and Charlie pulled out the matching Christmas pajamas she had gotten Cas to help her pick out. She quickly guilt-tripped the Winchesters into wearing them. Castiel didn’t argue with her, it felt wonderful to be included. He had even picked out fuzzy Christmas socks for all of them when he had been looped into Charlie’s plan, and gave Dean the one with angels on them. Charlie then proceeded to give both of the brothers the saddest face she could conjure up until they all agreed to sit in window seat together while Charlie propped up her phone to take a picture of them all.
“Get on with it, Gabriel. Cas deserves to hear about you magically binding him and whatever else you did to him, and I want to know why you think I’m able to help him.” Dean also losing patience with Gabe made Cas feel better somehow.
“I’m fairly certain that will quite literally mean ‘touchy-feely crap’.” Dean smirked at Cas’ use of air quotes, but Cas ignored him in favor of trying to clarify his concerns. “Dean, you’re not thinking this through. Gabe says it’s when you’re touching me. That’s not a long-term solution.” Gabe snorted.
Which is how Cas ended up in room 5 wiping down the surfaces and pulling a new paper cover over the bed. Cas knew all about patient privacy, but really, the conversation easily carried into the room when the man who must be one of Dr. Barnes patients had decided to continue talking to her out in the hallway.
