“Don’t question. Do as I say. Close your eyes.”
At the request of a reader, I'm placing a trigger warning on this chapter. It's not something that isn't already tagged -- just more specificity. To avoid a spoiler for the majority of readers, I'm placing it in the endnotes. Scroll down and read if you wish.
Sherlock pumps his fist.
“How many?” John’s voice is barely audible.
“It’s contaminated or not Adderall at all,” interrupts Sherlock, holding up the pill container, and earning an annoyed look from Jim.
“No. This is important, and I don’t want an answer right now. I want you to think about it. To think about what it would mean to you to wear a collar twenty-four seven.
“So. Still think I’m old?”
********
“Does he know how you feel?”
“Just looking, mate,” John says cheerfully, waving at the man and making his way toward a display of tomatoes. The man narrows his eyes and spits again. Sherlock follows John to the tomatoes where he is already holding one, testing its ripeness. “Caprese salad for dinner?” John says.
He fills her in on the visit to the campus bar and recounts the conversation with Pete.
“You’re a good friend.”
Moriarty was dressed in an exquisitely tailored tan suit and a white shirt, open at the collar. The three guards wore black trousers, black tee shirts, and black boots. Mycroft was in the same suit he’d worn on the plane, and judging by the wrinkles, John guessed he’d slept in it.
Folks, we know it's been a while since the last update. This chapter and the next one were more time consuming to write than most, and Kameo and I have been discussing them for literally months. Chapter 26 is in good shape, and we promise that you won't have to wait another six weeks for it. We are in week seven of the nine and a half week journey, in the home stretch, so to speak. Thank you, dear readers, for your support. We love and appreciate you.
going to hurt, sitting, standing, moving. He grimaces, caught between the slashes of the crop and the movement of the plug, as he takes the few steps from the bed to the chair where John is already waiting for him. He thinks of the hours he has to spend sitting in class and wonders what his work at the hospital will be like. Will they feel worse sitting still or moving around?
Sherlock is screwing his eyes shut in excruciating embarrassment, but squeezes out, “Six. I will not engage in any sexual behavior without permission. This includes masturbation.”
When Sherlock’s breathing becomes ragged, John pulls away, “That’s enough.”
John shakes his hand. “That’s great, William, I hope you take this opportunity seriously. No drugs.”
Sherlock pouts a little at the teasing. “Yes, I admit, it’s interesting. And we’re going to be reading non fiction too, so that’s a good thing. And the other kids were so open about who they were…” He takes off on an excited retelling of his day and John starts dinner, smiling fondly at his enthusiasm.
! It’s like I have to pinch myself every day to make sure it’s all real. You
“Well, it’s somebody’s fault,” broke in the nondescript man wearing jeans and a sport coat. “And I think it’s his!” He pointed toward Sherlock, who did not look up. “And why should we listen to you, anyway? Who made you king? Just because you were a soldier? So what?”
“You were snoring too,” John laughs. “But don’t be sorry sweetheart, I was enjoying just holding you against me. Come up here.” John guides Sherlock to lie on top of him so that they’re face to face, and runs his hands over his ass which is still hot, tracing the welts with his fingertips, and Sherlock feels the first stirrings of arousal between his legs.
John smiles and kisses the top of his head. “Good boy.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Boss...Dr. Watson, you still there?”
He doesn’t know how many blows follow, but eventually, he is aware that they have stopped. The fog in his brain clears slowly, and he feels John’s hand in his hair, alternately combing it with his fingers and massaging his scalp. The sensation is exquisite. He doesn’t want to move or even open his eyes. He just wants to stay this way. He sighs and moves his head against John’s touch.
“Fine.” He waves a hand in her direction without turning his head and gets on the elevator. The reflective doors show him what he already knows. There is blood on the front of his shirt and on his face, which in addition to being cut, is swollen and purple from the impact of the wrench. And he might end up with a black eye from the toe of Sarah’s sensible shoe. None of this matters right now.
“Alone doesn’t protect you. Friends protect you. Like you protected me. Idiot. And you had Vic.”
“Thank you, Sir.”
“And to drag poor Wiggy into it.” John sighs and shakes his head.
“Good. You are going to wear this today until we leave for the theater. For two reasons. Number one, as another reminder that you belong to me and that I care about you, and number two, to help with soreness. It’s a training plug. This one is a 'small.' When you’re used to this one, there are larger sizes. Now. You did agree to this, but let me ask again. What is your color?”
Molly took the marker from him and wrote:
John whispers. “That’s it. That’s what I wanna hear.” John flicks his tongue and Sherlock squirms harder. “Does that tickle?” He alternates between broad, slow lapping and tiny licks that barely skim over the hyper-sensitive area. The noise coming from Sherlock is now a steady moan, but he whimpers when John pokes the tip of his tongue through the ring of muscle. He continues his thrusting and the pleasure of it tingles right through Sherlock, and the tingles don’t stop at his twitching cock but travel to the tips of his toes.
He squeezes Sherlock a little tighter. “I love you too. So much. I’m going to take care of you. For as long as you’ll let me. But you are so young, I’m afraid you’ll break my heart one day.”
“Fine.”
“I’ll get you more water. There’s a creek nearby. And tomorrow, when it’s light. You’re going to pee for me.”
“You brat,” John says. “You know bloody well what you just did.”
“They said someone else is with them. Who else did you invite that they’d know?”
John strokes faster, and Sherlock adds his hand so that every throbbing inch of them is covered with a slick fist. The bed is creaking as they rock together, and sweat is dripping from John’s forehead. A drop lands on Sherlock’s lip and he licks it off, savoring its saltiness.
“All right, let’s finish. Up you get.”
Sherlock grabs the top rail of the headboard with both hands as John’s finger slides in and out of him. It feels good, easy so far. After a minute or so, John slides in a second finger and leaves it there.
Sherlock is panting now, and his forehead is damp with sweat. He wants to touch himself. Wants to come. He’s so hard that he’s sure he will explode. If he could just…
John spreads a towel over the cushion. “Sit. Sit before you fall down.” He takes one and then the other of his arms, rubbing and massaging. He kneels in front of him and chafes his hands, turning them over and examining them. “Good color. You’re all right.”
Sherlock realizes as he hangs up that that may have been the easiest conversation he’s ever had with his brother and wonders if it’s just because he’s growing up, or if John really has made everything in his life better.
“And what is left?”
“We are—in the main cabin, but we had an open seat in business class. This is your lucky day. Fortune favours the bold.” She winked.
John was bewildered. He was sure he’d never mentioned Will to her before.
“All right, let’s go,” he said, entering the hallway where the others were gathered.
He scanned the ingredients and was satisfied to see that peppermint oil and alcohol were listed. It would do. It would have to.
He pulled the Sharpie from his pocket and wrote in the notebook.
John is leaning back on the sofa, his own hand now resting on his crotch, casually stroking. “Good boy. Now I’d like you to get up, go to your room, and prepare yourself. You will meet me in my room in exactly fifteen minutes.”
“Dude! Sherlock! Thought you’d died. Haven’t seen you for a while,” says the thirty-something bearded man behind the bar when Sherlock walks in. “Shit, man, what happened to you?
“Um, maybe, Sir, but it’s been three days, since…”
“Unfortunately for you, Sherlock, you have a conscience, and it’s quite painful sometimes. Punishment helps you feel better. You have me. You don’t need to punish yourself. I’m going to get a flannel to soothe you now. I’ll be right back.” Sherlock flips over onto his belly and winces when he feels the welts with his fingertips and heat radiating off his backside. He tries to look over his shoulder but can’t see much. John comes back with a cool, wet washcloth and kneels beside Sherlock. He lays it carefully on the bright red skin and purpling stripes, and Sherlock inhales sharply. John leaves it for a few moments as he blows air over the welts on his legs, and it cools the burning flesh. He moves the cloth to Sherlock’s thighs and alternates the cooling breaths with feather-light kisses. Sherlock closes his eyes and concentrates on the warring sensations, the burn and the brush of lips, the burn, and the soothing current of air. Then he feels a finger gliding over his buttocks again and again. John must be tracing each mark.
“Yes, sir. Right away.” He hurries back behind the counter, and they hear the crackle of a walkie-talkie.
Angelo brings a candle and a bottle of red wine. “Tenuta Torciano Terrestre, an excellent choice, Dr. Watson.” After John approves the bottle, Angelo pours them each a glass, then leaves them alone.
“You are a very slow reader.”
“Yeah, I’ve got them all written down here.” He gestures at a cluster of sticky notes, some with strings that are attached to other sticky notes. “But—” He’s interrupted by the doorbell. “That’s weird, I’m not expecting anyone.”
Sherlock did wait up. He waited until long after midnight but John didn't return. Finally, he fell asleep alone.
“On the contrary, I’m the lucky one.”
Sherlock looks around, embarrassed to hear the spoken word and realizes absolutely no one is paying any attention to them since there are so many more interesting couples to be seen.
“Jerking off. No masturbating without my permission. And same instructions. You need help with that, you call me. Are we clear?” John squeezes, and Sherlock groans.
“I’m leaving Sherlock,” Myc says. “I’m available twenty four-seven if you need me. I’m going to fly back to D.C., but I’ll be back in a few days. We still have much to discuss.” He holds out his hand, and Sherlock reaches for it, but Myc unexpectedly hugs him instead. “Don’t you ever do that again, little brother. Please,” he whispers.
“Sherlock. Who’s in charge here?”
“Don’t say that! You don’t mean it, Sherlock.”
The room is silent, and he looks straight ahead at the beige wall, waiting.
“Bring the cushion and come kneel by me.”
. He’s pacing in the living room, a cigarette dangling from his lips. Nervous. He has the envelope with the list and he hopes his answers will be acceptable. He walks into the bathroom and looks at himself in the mirror, thinking he looks OK. He’s wearing dark skinny jeans and the shirt that John requested, he’s even ironed it. Does he look sexy? He’s too thin and his hair is out of control. He pouts his lips at the mirror, then laughs at himself.
Sherlock moans, “No, no, Sir.”
“Sherlock, are you absolutely sure you locked it? Maybe you forgot.”
Sherlock said nothing. There were a great many things he wanted to say, the first of which was that he never made mistakes, but he held his tongue, not wanting to make things worse for himself or the hostages.
Sherlock pulls back and looks to see if he’s being teased, and John says, “Rule number four, you can always talk to me, Sherlock. So long as you’re respectful.”
During these visits, Sherlock talked about his work, and John talked about his time in Iraq. When John found The World Cup Qualifier between Scotland and Italy on the TV's sports channel, he grew excited and tried to explain soccer, which John called “football,” to him but soon gave up, exasperated. Sherlock had little interest in sports on either side of the pond.
“I guess I was scared that if I read them, I
Sherlock opens the box.
Sherlock drops his eyes and recites again. “I will be available by phone at all times. If I am unable to answer, I must call as soon as possible.”
Sherlock’s muscles tense involuntarily at the sight of Myc and then feels heat in his cheeks when he realizes what his brother just witnessed, that he’s on his knees. The condescension had practically dripped from Myc’s words. He looks back at John, who gives him a reassuring smile, and the anxiety melts away.
Sherlock is quiet for a minute as he considers all this new data. Then he says, “Thank you, John. For all of it. For listening. For being there today. Just...everything.”
John had been watching the drama unfold with a feeling of helpless fury. He thought of the knife but knew he was outmatched. He was also frightened for Sherlock. John had had plenty of experience with evil. He had seen men like this in the war, men on
This is unfamiliar ground. Sherlock tries to remember if he’s ever seen John nervous. He’s always been the confident one. Unshakeable. What could he possibly be nervous about?
“Sherlock!”
“Pffft! Stop it. They just don’t know you like I do. Promise you’ll think about it… Geez, that’s a fancy watch, Sherlock,” she says, taking his wrist.
“Oh Sherlock,” John said.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Obviously.”
MH:  So I’ll CU tomorrow!
Sherlock swallows hard and looks away but remains silent.
By the time the sheriff has taken statements and put George in the back of the car, Myc is making calls, and Ms. Hudson has spoken to Molly. Molly heads for Sherlock’s house, and her parents offer to drive by some places that Molly’s heard about. John knows the notorious spots on campus, and there are a couple of former students Ms. Hudson can pressure for information. Apparently, she’s helped quite a few of them over the years, and they’d be happy to return the favor.
John groans, “That would be incredible, seeing your body draped over my car, just for me. You are fucking killing me.” He kisses Sherlock again before sitting back and running a hand through his hair, blowing out deep breaths through his mouth.
“Yes?”
Sherlock turns to face him, and John picks up the sponge, resuming the firm, circular strokes on his chest and stomach, and then using his hands and a feather-light touch to wash his penis and scrotum. Sliding the foreskin back, he quickly cleans and rinses the delicate skin underneath.  John’s obviously trying to avoid arousing him, and he succeeds. Mostly. He continues with the sponge down his legs, scrubbing a bit at his knees, then gently lifting one foot. Sherlock tenses up, but John reassures him.
“That’s your brother? Why don’t you just sit with him?”
“It’s time for the paddle and I need you to ask me for your punishment.”
“You’ve always been strong Sherlock. You need to dig deep and make it through until I get there. I know you can do it. I’ll be there soon.”
hungry. He wasn’t before, but now his stomach is rumbling. But again, he has the impulse to defy John. Before, he didn’t want John’s commands to interfere. Now, it might be that he wants relief from the guilt he feels at not exactly living up to his Mom’s expectations. And John’s going to make him wait! Maybe if he pushes a few more buttons…
After John had helped Sherlock clean their mingled semen from his stomach, John switched off the light and climbed under the covers beside him, propping himself on one elbow. “How do you feel?”
to come. He looks so handsome, his hair mussed, damp with perspiration, and is giving him a smile that makes Sherlock’s heart flutter. He breathes in, as deeply as his ribs will allow, trying to memorize the scent of sweat and musk and come.
“I understand John,” Sherlock said, quietly, his head bowed.
“Wig, good to see you! What’s up?” He extends his hand, but Wiggy ignores it and gives him a hug instead.
“Bloody hell,” murmured John, annoyed with himself for not noticing this straight away. “You’re right. But the vegetation…the timing of everything…it doesn’t make sense. We’ve got to be on the East Coast. There is no way in hell; we can be on the West Coast. It’s impossible.”
“There are games,” Louise said. I saw them. With our bags. “We could play.”
“So how was it ‘supposed’ to happen?”
“Everything OK?” John asks, his eyes closed.
“Um...yes. OK. Yes, Sir.”
John rolls Sherlock over onto his side and tickles his belly. Sherlock squirms and tightens his lips to keep more giggles from giving him away. Then John pulls him close. “I see. Not at all. Now, one more time, tell me how you feel.”
John’s hands slide over his buttocks. “Mine,” he murmurs. “You are all mine.” Then his fingers slip between them, and the plug is pulled halfway out, then pushed in again. Sherlock bites his lip and shuts his eyes. Since the extraordinary orgasm on the sofa this morning, the rest of the day has been one long tease, and he’s once again desperate for release. Once he takes his punishment, there will be fucking, and, oh, how he wants to be fucked.
“Of course.”
he wants violence and passion. He wants John’s hands on him, he wants welts and cries, and stinging flesh; he wants to feel hot breath on his skin and, instead of the plug, the living, pulsing force that is John, inside him, possessing him.
Sherlock opens his eyes to Annie taking shots from the floor and John staring at him like a man starving. Sherlock’s cock responds immediately, and Annie hums.
A cry escapes Sherlock’s lips as he comes, his body shuddering as the pleasure and the pain converge in his fantasy. He drops the list and clamps his hand over his mouth. The walls are thin, and he’s afraid his father will hear him. He hasn’t had an orgasm this strong since...Victor? As it fades and he tries to catch his breath silently, he imagines John’s fingers in his hair, caressing his scalp. Gentle and soothing.
John is close behind. “Should I follow in my car?”
Sherlock cuts in, in an annoyed voice. “Um. Standing right here.”
Sherlock nods.
“What are your charges?”
“Wha—”
Panting, John tells him again, “Good boy.”
“Shirt pocket,” John whispers, and Sherlock’s hands search blindly to find the lube bottle. John’s lips are on his neck and then the shell of his ear as he uncaps it.
Sherlock feels so hot he wonders if spontaneous combustion has ever been confirmed as a real phenomenon. He makes a mental note to do some research as soon as he finishes his final paper. He cuts her off before she can go any further. “Yeah, well, what I really wanted to know, and you don’t have to tell me, I mean obviously, it’s private information, and we just met, and it’s not really any of my business—”
She smiled. “Pleased to meet you, Doctor Watson.  I understand that our patient is with us today because of you.” John frowned, and she quickly corrected herself.  “— I mean with us as in
********
Sherlock is silent for a moment then pulls away.
John laughs and stands to take Sherlock’s face in his hands. “Nothing to be sorry about, love. You’re eighteen. It’s expected. And besides, I like to think it’s because I’m so sexy. Knowing I can bring you off that quickly turns me on just as much. He kisses Sherlock lightly. “
“Not a chance, Sherlock. You don’t call the shots. I do. Have you forgotten that already?”
********
“When I went, I expected to die. I wanted to die. But then I changed my mind, John. I found that I wanted to live. That I wanted to come back—to you. Even if you didn’t want me.”
“You would repair a cart, or feed a horse.”
“But I’m not getting coffee.”
, Sherlock thought to himself,
Sherlock turned on to his stomach. His cock was hard again—the stimuli must be the memory of his pleasure in the woods and of John’s face as he met his crisis--and he rolled his hips, pressing his cock down into the blankets and the clean hay that now made up his bed. Then, John rolled over, sighing in his sleep, and Sherlock stopped.
“It wasn’t thrown,” Sherlock exclaimed. In several long bounds, he covered the distance between the piles and the woods. John followed more slowly, examining the grass again as he went.
“Mike, take that to the barn,” he said.
Then, he landed in another pile of scat. This one, he discovered, was not human.
“There’s a job well done,” John was saying. He was turning around. He would know. “What do you think of…Sherlock?”
Harry baaed miserably all the way back to her goat house. John tied her up with a certain satisfaction, then, hoping to convince her that her situation was not the most dire, gave her the rind of cheese to chew. This favour caused Clara to materialize from behind the shanty, giving little bleats of the most pathetic kind. Sherlock caught her before she had quite reached John and Harry, but at John’s nod, let her tow him over to Harry and nuzzle her for her share. Harry promptly dropped the last shred of cheese; Clara picked it up, and Harry bleated in a satisfied way.
“We need a plan.”
"Your geese," he said, with a certain aloofness in his voice, "are aggressive."
John had known that, but to hear him say it...he could not let it lie.
“Point taken,” Sherlock grumbled, ceding to reality.
“Do get on with it.”
Sherlock pulled on his trousers and reached for his notebooks, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth. In this, at least, he could provide what was needed.
The fire, though, did not have the same novelty as the man on the settle, and John found his gaze drawn towards him more often than he might have otherwise anticipated. He was handsome, though oddly so; his features were quite pronounced. His body, like his face, was long and lean, and his hands and feet quite abnormally large. Taken singly, only his large, changeable eyes and mobile mouth were beautiful, but the overall effect was one of striking good looks. Certainly his brain was striking, though John worried about what it would mean to have a devotee of science in the house all summer. Too, he worried about what it would mean to have such an attractive person in his house all summer. Any thrill would do, he supposed, when he’d been alone as long as he had.
“What,” John said, unbuttoning his coat. “You can’t take it?”
“I don’t take boarders either.”
John’s voice, when it came, was heavy.
“How? You didn’t betray your regiment.”
He hurried through into the kitchen, where Sally—why could he not recall more?—was at the stove, stirring an enormous kettle of beans. Her back stiffened at the sound of his step; he resolved to leave her strictly alone until he could place her. Mrs. Hudson had shaken her lettuce dry and was now tearing it briskly as she gave breadmaking instructions to another, unfamiliar woman.
Warning for John having a panic attack, though it doesn’t last very long.
“Mesmerism is bunk at best, John.”
, he thought.
Could he do what John had done? Could he put his hand upon himself and bring himself to crisis? He had no medium to do so, but perhaps he could still attempt it. Anything was better than this animal half-life, in which his mind was ruled by his body and he could not interact with other people—with John—in a civilized manner.
“Don't you like cats?” John asked.
“You think so?”
“Very well,” John said. Was he blushing himself? Quite likely. He got up.
Honestly I have no idea whether giving hens hot food in summer makes them lay more. We used to feed our hens chicken food and compost and nothing more. They still laid plenty of eggs. If any poultry experts want to weigh in below, though, I’m interested.
I also forgot to mention earlier that this whole fic was called Hysteria, Hypothermia, and Half-Hearted Heterosexuality for a while, and The Finest Part of the Line for a long while. I like the current title better.
Could he stay? The thought assailed him suddenly, and he shifted to a slower tune. John had not asked him, nor did he seem likely to. He wondered, for the first time, if he himself could homestead; if he could build a farm up as John had done. After a moment’s contemplation, he knew that was not what he wanted. He wanted to stay on his present terms: as part of John’s farm and John’s life.
"I want you to. So much. But I want to touch you. To spend together." The words fell from his mouth in a rush.
"Me too," he smiled, and stripped off his shirt. He wrinkled his nose at the smell of himself.
“Do you suppose the bear has moved on?” he said, to distract himself from this line of thinking.
“Sherlock!”
“Dear me, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock said, his lips still taunting. His pupils, however, had dilated. John flushed, remembering Sherlock’s reaction at being surprised in the woods, and was even more certain that Sherlock would crumble under a strict physical control. As James had done, had wanted. It had been sweet to have his captain on his knees, and it would be even sweeter to have Sherlock Holmes on his.
“Chickening out?”
“I was 11, though normally they took children from age 13.”
“Did that hurt?” he asked, reaching for it again more carefully. It was prominent; it might very well be painful when touched.
"But you do about medicine, and no doubt you have numerous contacts amongst the local Ojibway tribe who are familiar with the plants. In any case, Sherlock is rather solitary."
“Perhaps a ham instead?” More expensive, yes, but he had the money from Mycroft, and Sherlock should eat. The summer wasn’t so long. John would just eat more salt pork when he was alone this fall.
“Don’t toast all your sides at once,” he said, putting his cheese over the second-best spot. “Or you’ll lose your cheese.”
I think that’s it! Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you see any typos.
John scrambled out, Eva’s basket in one hand, and stood there for a moment. He was about to go in when Uncle Gregory gestured to the basket (in which Eva had decided to resume her unhappy yowling).
had been consumed.”
“A pleasure,” John said, extending his hand towards Molly. Sherlock scrutinized his face, but the smile, so bright for Sherlock, had dimmed to no more than a pleasant expression. Socially acceptable, but no undue interest.
“At least Harry is dry right now,” John said, offering a tidbit of cheer, “Eating green onions makes her milk taste terrible.”
He had already had to abandon his vow to restrict self-abuse to once a fortnight; he now allowed himself once a day. Otherwise he would crumble under the strain and most likely lay hands on Sherlock, who, aggravating though he was, did not deserve to suffer John’s unpalatable mixture of anger and desire.
Taking a handful of corn, Sherlock leaned over the pen and began to dole out grains one by one, first to Philemon and then to Pierrette. The chickens, ignored, surged around the geese, cackling. The geese themselves accepted the first few offerings, but quickly became impatient. Sherlock seemed aware of this, but continued as he had begun, until Pierrette surged up out of the pen and perched on the bar, beating her great wings. Philemon, not to be outdone, honked as loudly as he could, and Sherlock jumped back in surprise, tripped over the lead rope, and fell into John, knocking him back onto the floor.
“Father says that drink is the Devil’s water.” Joe said, though not reluctantly.
First the moose, now this. Sherlock felt a warm curl in the region of his heart, enough to start a frisson of unease in his own mind.
“Take it, then!” Sherlock came close to him again, dangerously so. “Take me.”
“I’m filthy,” Sherlock replied.
Come and visit me on tumblr, where I’m redscudery, or Twitter, where I go by @scudery. Thanks for reading!
“John, I am entirely convinced that none of your farming neighbours did this. We’re looking for someone clever, someone very clever.” He held up the straw dog. “But why so clever? It’s a game, that’s what it is. But who’s playing? What are the rules? There must be a
“Won’t you stay for pie, Cyrus?” Mrs. Hudson asked.
“Your moral compass needs recalibrating.” Sherlock fought down the cold feeling that swept through him at the word “wrong”. He knew that John was not thinking of him, of them, when he said it; he was thinking of past events and past consequences.
Then, he laid his hands on Sherlock’s ribs. Sherlock was breathing deeply but steadily.
“And those minutes have to occur after the coffee is consumed. No saving it for later.”
“You want this?” John whispered, and Sherlock nodded frantically, burying his nose in John’s hair. “This is what you’d get.”
furious—Sherlock had had no right to do what he did, and what’s more, absolutely no call to begin another experiment—but he was also possessed with a sudden urge to laugh. Sherlock sprawled in the mud with his city clothes did make quite a picture, and John suddenly wished he had seen the whole “experiment”. His lips twitched.
“Can you walk?” He drew back as soon as Sherlock was steady.
“I’ll be able to test that new chamomile mixture too.” Sherlock said, brightening visibly. “It has a trifle more lye in it—“
what John thought of him. Worse (seventh?) he cared what John felt, not only about him but in general. He wished, actively wished, for John's well-being. It was a disturbing feeling.
"My brother," Sherlock said, sitting back on his heels with a sigh, "is the most tiresome person in this world."
“Who doesn’t?” Mrs. Hudson said, and John shuddered inwardly at the tone of her voice. He had, in the past, suspected the relationship between the two went beyond the borders of the platonic, but given their age difference he preferred not to think about it too closely. Neighbours really did deserve their privacy, and it was none of his affair.
The moment John woke he knew he should have slept upstairs. He had not moved in the night but Sherlock had, and he was curled against John’s back. His face was buried in John’s hair, his arm was flung low over John’s hip, and his extremely proportionate erection was wedged into a very suggestive position between John’s arse cheeks.
“Should we?” Sherlock said. He set his hand to John’s waist. It was huge and warm. John’s world tilted just a bit.
“Well enough,” John replied, “Potatoes a little late but Isadora had twin heifers this year.”
“No. The fairer sex is not something that excites my interest.”
Mike laughed.
“Sherlock Holmes, moose are the most dangerous things in these woods, after men, and yet you try to reassure one? You’re a bloody idiot!”
Sherlock remembered thinking about John as a conductor of light. Perhaps telling John the facts as far as he remembered would allow him to dislodge forgotten details.
“It’s…look, you’re right. It was an honest mistake.”
He laid out the baby squirrel carefully, humming as he did so. His mind ticked through the steps with perfect efficiency; what a pleasure work was. John’s cabin did lack some amenities, but he found what he needed here and there. He was sure John wouldn’t begrudge him the pins he needed, for example, and the knife could be washed.
“No arguing,” Sherlock said, briskly. “You’re cold and shaking. The night is dangerous. We are going.”
Well, it could have been worse, he supposed. Mike was a garrulous man but knew, generally, when to hold his tongue, and that was more than John could say for most people. And though he was a heavy man, he was strong, and he could help John with the damn plough, being significantly more intelligent than Hamish the ox.
"If you don't hurry it up, I'll come over there and wash you myself." His tone was light, he thought, but there was no mistaking the twitch of Sherlock's cock as he spoke.
“And so your family was sent there?”
“I wouldn’t let him take it away.” Sherlock’s face was perfectly honest, and John stared at him in surprise.
John swallowed.
I also have to thank CWB for a) commenting on every chapter and b) bringing in a whole new wave of readers to this fic. It has been incredibly motivating and I am profoundly grateful.
"So do I deserve a reward?" Sherlock's hands were creeping around John's waist to his arse.
"You're so good," John breathed. "So good. Please."
John’s explosive laughter was a surprise to both of them, but it broke the tension.
“Take off your coat,” he said, “lower your trousers, and bend over the chair.”
“You didn’t expect a climax. It was medicine, you said.”
“Unnecessary.” Sherlock’s voice was still very loud. “My…I am erect, almost painfully so.”
"Sherlock!" Caught in an uncomfortable space between arousal and amusement, John tried to pull away, but Sherlock held firm.
Their arrival at the farm, heralded as it was by Harry and Clara’s plaintive cries and Idiot Horse’s enthusiastic whinnying by, was somewhat reassuring. The geese came up to meet them, much to Sherlock’s delight, and nothing appeared even slightly changed.
John just grunted in annoyance and, brushing the crumbs from his hands, picked up his hoe. When he turned around, Sherlock had returned to the house.
Physical contact was dangerous; if he allowed his awareness of Sherlock to penetrate his touch-starved consciousness, he would make a fool of himself right here.
“Than you, you mean.”
“Sholto?”
His optimism lasted until John came in, stomping his feet.
In the days that followed, John took rather longer trips to the outhouse than usual, and Sherlock took no notice—or said nothing if he did.  His appropriation of the beeswax also went unremarked, though, John was sure, not unnoticed. Sherlock had been mumbling things about bees and honey with increasing frequency, and John expected to find a beehive in the garden any day now.
"I want to taste you," Sherlock said, biting John's neck again. John's vision went dark, a little.
“To what do I owe this honour?”
“I can catch her,” Sherlock said, and, without waiting for John’s approbation, Sherlock tore off after them.
“There’s a precedent.” Sherlock bit his lower lip. “John, I need bear scat immediately.”
“Yes, but you didn’t.”
"All right?" he asked, and bit his lip again. John took his face in his hand; he smiled.
“You’ld be singing a different tune if you had to go to an orphanage, young man, or out to work.”
Of course, terrible things could lurk in the woods, as he himself had cause to remember. He hurried his pace, wishing to be next to Sherlock in case the bear should charge. It would be unusual if it did, but John dared not risk it. He caught up to Sherlock, who had ceased running but was walking as fast as he could towards the glow of the cabin.
I shrugged, “A lot of things. You both care about each other more than I would assume two heterosexual men to care and you both seemed to have dynamic where you tolerate each other flaws no matter what and in a way seem to make up for what the other lacks like John’s not genius but provides emotional support to make your investigating go more smoothly by relaxing someone into dropping their guard so you can get info. I also notice you two are rarely apart and John has that good-natured annoyed boyfriend attitude similar to the one I see my uncle's boyfriend take with him I mean it took Fidds and Grunkle Ford almost three years to stop beating around the bush and come to terms with their feelings for each other. Honestly, even though you’re not dating, there is a spark there as my sister would say it depends who tells who first or if you or John is even into men.”
a kidnapping. We
I blinked in a confused manner, not understanding how I knew that either or why my sentence came out way different than how I had planned to reply. Something felt off standing on the stairs. My old paranoia of being watched crept in, but I snapped back to focus when Sherlock said: “I wouldn’t doubt with all I have said you have probably heard of me online with how much kids like you are on the internet these days.”
John looked away. “I don’t want you to get hurt. It's different when you’re dealing with human beings, and normal criminals cause there is always a solid answer, but now we are dealing with real monsters here and real magic with no definitive answers…I…I…”
I thought for a second going over Theodore’s hints before facepalming and groaning, “Either I am stupid, or this was too ironic even to consider, but you’re his twin brother aren’t you?”
Meeting him for the second time, I couldn’t help but notice how attractive he was. Without the trench coat, I could see he had a slim build like me with toned arms and rather nice legs. He was pale like he didn’t go out in the sunlight a lot and had messy curly black hair and intelligent-looking light blue eyes. He was wearing a dark purple button-up with the sleeves rolled up and black slacks with what looked like expensive black dress shoes. I mentally slapped myself for pulling a Mabel finding that ever since I had come out as gay at sixteen, I found myself analyzing every semi-attractive guy that graced my presence like I was still some thirsty sixteen-year-old high schooler.
John gave him a skeptical look and said: “Sherlock, there is no case so far the boy is mentally ill and is reiterating a lunatic’s story in hopes of coping with his sister’s disappearance.”
“Right so one more thing we encountered another demon who we think might have ties to Mabel’s kidnapping, but we can’t identify them besides the fact they turn your eyes sapphire blue when possessing you. They seemed pretty adamant about us not getting involved and even mentioned you by the name William. He wouldn’t happen to be family too would he Bill?”
Part of me just wanted any reason not to sit in her apartment more than I had to, mainly remembering what Bill said last night.
Theo grinned like the Cheshire cat showing pointy teeth and his eerie black and emerald eyes, “And what would be the fun it that my little fawn?”
Before I could answer, Sherlock cut in and said, “They are twins, John. He is here for his sister out of some nature of concern.”
He started kissing and licking my neck his large thin hands gripping my hips firmly as he purred “I bet you would love nothing more than for me to kiss that pretty pale ass of yours I bet you would make lovely noises if I just bent you over this car hood and devoured that plush ass of yours this minute and beauty of it is no one would be any wiser it would be our secret.”
I coughed, causing him to jump and scream the sound kind of comical as he looked over at me and narrowed his bulbous eye in annoyance “Jesus Pinetree, a little warning would be nice instead of creeping ominously in the corner.”
He suddenly looked over in surprise and said, “I thought I heard Sherlock talking to someone. I thought it was odd since the only person he talks to here is Ms. Hudson and I. My name is John Watson, and you are?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He asked gruffly, “Who are you don’t remember Sherlock and John having a third wheel?”
I looked around. “Not that you’re probably going to tell me cause Bill didn’t seem in a sharing mood either, but how are you and Bill related? I got him to admit your family, but yeah, things kinda went south in our first conversation?”
John looked astonished and said, “Wait, you’re telling me unicorns exist too?”
John chuckled lightly, “I can still recall first moving in with Sherlock Mycroft stalked me and offered me large sums of money for information on Sherlock as a test to see how loyal I was to him. He means well about twenty-five percent of the time I’m still not sure about the other seventy five percent.”
I didn’t know how much to tell them but started by saying, “Yeah, but as far as we are concerned, he’s dead, he would be dead for seven years as of this year. I mean, the way he died was something I don’t think he could have survived. But if he survived, I wouldn’t doubt he’d go after my family though it confuses me why he started with Mabel and not me or my Great uncle Ford since we were the biggest thorn in his side and caused him the most problems why not pick off your number one and number two problem instead of jumping to like problem number four.”
Theodore just gave me a small smirk. “You have seen William’s face and my real face, and you know we share a last name, meaning we are closely enough related to be doing so. Why don’t you guess, little Starlord.”
“Lestrade, what happened here?” Sherlock asked who I now realized was the cop Sherlock respected.
I laughed and said, “No, you guys have been getting my age wrong for the last couple of hours, and I haven’t found a reasonable opportunity to correct you.”
Ms. Hudson looked over at the window and said, “He kept repeating the words “shooting star” like a mantra.”
I growled, “There is no security risk you are being lied to and tricked by a monster.”
She seemed to relax at my comforting belief in her and started slowly “Well I walked out in the hall around ten at night and noticed your sister's flat door was ajar, and I thought she might be back, so I peeked in but who I saw was most certainly not Mabel.”
Theodore nodded, and they proceeded to walk away, leaving me fuming when Sherlock said, “Ignore him I have read all of Stanford Pines’s research regardless of his topics the quality of it has never changed. Even his more fantastical studies are worthy of reading why do you think science fiction has survived this long Dipper? Because it is a promise of a great future and the ability to preserve our species even longer. So what if my brother thinks his research is nonsense to be quite honest every piece of science was nonsense at one point until someone became motivated enough to stop listening to others and press forward as a pioneer of things we take for granted today. I, for one, would be fascinated to see another world because this one is getting boring and predictable, and I am only in my thirties. Dr. Pines presents me with the hope of something more in the future, so let the old man research the nonsensical because one man’s nonsense is another man’s relief from the mind numbing boredom of everyday life.”
The way John’s eyes flicked over at me this was something of a personal matter the way he said “certain someone” so I took that as my cue to excuse myself and said, “Well I won’t keep you guys any longer I’m going to go talk to the landlady. I will get back to you on a later date since I might be your new neighbor if the landlady will let me live in Mabel’s flat, so have a nice day, and thank you for the help.”
Bill’s gaze softened, “And I will answer them when you aren’t wound up like a two-dollar watch.”
* * *
Lestrade looked at my birthmark close up, making me feel the old self-consciousness rising back up when he chuckled “That’s a nifty birthmark, not sure I would want it on my head, but I bet it would make a great conversation piece.”
All I could do was stare at the charcoal demon as he pushed a lock of his bright blue hair out of his eyes and picked up his cigarette, finishing it exhaling the sweet cinnamon smell that seemed to permeate the air around him and crushed the butt in the ashtray. Neither of us seemed to know how to break the awkward silence when Bill reached out and without warning pulled me into his lap, making me squeak in fear as the demon shuddered and buried his face between my shoulder blades his warm breath seeping through the back of my shirt. His arms were made of lean muscle and held almost a feverish heat like the rest of his body, but he was gentle and surprisingly trembling as he held me, giving me the impression he was scared or stressed.
Bill snorted, “Honestly Dipper there has never been a creature recorded in the whole multiverse that just existed out of nowhere everything in this entire multiverse has a creator, parent, guardian or whatever they came from and I honestly should be no exception.”
I ran my fingertips over his gold fingernails and asked: “Why stay when you can just up and disappear into the multiverse somewhere and start over.”
I had to admit that it was weird, but I couldn’t think some random flat ass salesperson could have made off with Mabel. Bill also seemed to be hiding something, but for now, I moved onto another thing that had been bothering me.
I smiled and replied, “Something that throws logic out the window John and I dare say challenge accepted.”
Sherlock looked up and said flatly as usual “Ah, you made it I ordered you some coffee since I doubt your sister had any in her flat with her apparent disdain for the drink since John had offered her some during one of her visits and she had rather…strong opinions on your caffeine intake.”
Minor headcannons:
John lifted an eyebrow and asked, “You mean the one we got from that little town in Oregon, USA?
Ms. Hudson quietly said, “He vanished before they got here, which is odd because I would have seen him go out the door, so I assume he escaped via the window. He must have realized he had been seen or had good timing. Though I did hear him speak a little, he kept repeating something over and over again.”
Sherlock quirked his mouth, “Interesting. I don’t believe I ever disclosed my last name to you.”
Sherlock sidled up beside me and said: “Odd, the perpetrator was able to destroy the statue without setting off alarms or alerting security guards.”
Bill chuckled. “Well, Dipper, I'm not the one questioning someone gender here. I mean, I know I’m pretty and queer, but even a blind man could see I am a dude.”
Sherlock suddenly made a noise of accomplishment and said: “I knew I would find it if I looked in these files.”
Bill gave an annoyed sigh as if remembering the day and said: “A bunch of shit none of it having any correlation to the previous product like first he tried to sell her this loose leaf tea, which she refused asking him politely to leave when he tried to hock her this pretty sapphire jewelry which she of course refuse and asked him more firmly to leave reminding him of the no soliciting sign so in a last-ditch effort to get her to buy something he stupidly hocked a pretty black violin only for Mabel to slam the door on his face and call the landlady telling her there was a salesman in the building harassing her, but when the landlady showed up, he appeared long gone.”
Sherlock waved his hand at me. “His name is Dipper Pines. He is a special case, and I require his assistance.”
I lifted an eyebrow, “Are you crying?”
The man named John rolled his eyes at Sherlock and said: “Some of us pride ourselves in consistent hygiene.”
Bill made a choking noise that was almost inaudible but quickly composed himself and said: “I know of him though no relation, sorry.”
Sherlock gave me a small smirk and said, “I guess we can’t help you then. I like to know all the details before taking a case.”
Dipper shook his head, explaining, “I’m not sure anymore I mean, all the signs are there, but his personality is the complete opposite of Bill. He’s too polite even after he is outed for doing something bad, and the Bill I know would have killed me for attacking him. I have to come to the conclusion that’s not Bill, though something to keep our eye on.”
I heard him sigh and saw him lean back as he said in a soft voice, “You’re not exactly a ninja Pinetree.”
He grabbed Mycroft and slung him over his shoulder with ease and tipped his hat, “I bid you gentlemen farewell.”
“There is no sense in getting angry at something that already lost to you instead feel smug that a god-like creature lost to a twelve-year-old child.” He said in a soft, reassuring way.
John looked like he was thinking, “What if we talk to some of these shop keepers? Maybe they saw this man and your sister at one point?”
Sherlock let go of my hand and said, “I see. If you're looking for your sister’s flat, it is upstairs. I have no doubt the landlady will let you in if you tell her you’re a relative of the young lady living there.”
I stared at the coldly passionate man before looking down and looking back up at him with determination in my eyes, “You are very much understood, Sherlock Holmes.”
He was talking about Mabel; she was the only one I knew that would hand out hand-knitted items to strangers as a way of getting to know her surroundings.
I nervously adjusted my hat and held out a hand, “Dipper Pines um…nice to meet you, Officer Lestrade.”
John sighed and picked the man up, putting him in a chair so he didn’t wake up on the floor when Sherlock spoke up, “I think we should head to the art museum anyway.”
John gave Sherlock a scared look and said: “You heard what that monster said we should just stay away.”
Before Sherlock could get too far, the shop keeper grabbed his sleeve, and we all looked back to see his eyes were sapphire blue cats eyes, and he said in a flat voice “Don’t even bother detective we are long gone I would cease your search while you're still breathing.”
Sherlock looked passive like he was thinking, but John looked utterly weirded out, and his face held not an ounce of belief in my story as he asked, “How many drugs was your uncle taking? Dipper, this sound without a doubt like you were sick and hallucinating after being exposed to a man who was mental and dangerous. There are no such thing demons. The apocalypse is just theory if you can even call it that.”
He hissed under his breath what suspiciously sounded like “goddammit” and settled his chin on my shoulder saying, “Give me a break Dipper you try being deprived of emotions and sanity for almost a millennia and tell me the first thing you wouldn’t do is hug something warm and soft.
Bill sighed, “I think it’s less changed and more so woke up. Imagine being asleep for centuries only to wake up and become conscious of yourself in an alien surrounding with all the memories of the past millennia hitting you like a freight train much of the memories being of shit you would never do even if someone paid you a vast sum of money. I have done some terrible shit so terrible I often question why I even woke up in the first place since I am pretty sure something as dangerous as me shouldn’t have the right to breathe.”
The next hour was the most uncomfortable hour of my life as I started from the beginning with Grunkle Ford encounter with Bill and came to the conclusion of the story with his defeat and my Grunkle Stan’s sacrifice as I reiterated he has been dead for seven years due how we defeated him and why it was crazy he would be back now.
Bill was silent before saying “I know this sounds bad, but I’m not sure Dipper I woke up naked in a warehouse next to my statue and wandered London for a few days seeing if I could make sense of shit before a girl helped me out that turned out to be your sister. She had no idea who I was but brought me food every day, claiming she wasn’t afraid of my appearance due to having dealt with many supernatural creatures and let me stay here out of sight of the landlady to get me off the street and somewhere safe. I told her my name was William, which is my name, but I felt it would get me more sympathy then using the name Bill. I told her I was leaving for a couple of days and came back to find her missing, however, I had to hide for a while cause the landlady saw me one night. I sent you the postcard hoping you would show up and help me find her, but I chickened out when you showed up and hid within the apartment.”
I was finally getting used to people questioning my nickname and lifted my hat and hair. “Nah, it’s a nickname cause of my birthmark, so kinda astrology oriented but not intentional.”
The tall man said with a tone of complete certainty, “You must be her twin brother.”
Bill curled his fingers around my hand and pulled it to his mouth, kissing it softly, making my face heat up. Why did the guy who fucked up my head (however unintentional) have to put my hormones through ringer now? Bill smiled at me, which to me looked more like a smirk and kissed my hand a couple more times, even kissing the palm when he ran the tip of his tongue over my fingers, making me jerk my hand away feeling slightly toasty all over as I nervously coughed.
Dipper nodded, “A lot of magical creatures exist within Gravity Falls where my Grunkle Ford lived. I’ve seen most of the creatures recorded in his research. I mean, my first introduction to the weirdness of Gravity Falls is a bunch of gnomes tried to kidnap my sister and make her their queen.”
->> ->> ->>
I lifted an eyebrow, “With how my first day and a half in London has gone...Try me.
“Hey, Bill, do you have any relation to a Theodore Spherius Cipher by any chance,” I asked, hoping he could shed some light on the albino demon.
I just gave him a deadpan expression and said, “This is just getting progressively weirder. First, Bill is back from the dead and has a human shape I never knew existed now I find out he has a twin brother working right under a human police station's nose for some unknown reason.”
Ch. 2 Fool’s Gold
Billed sighed in return “Honestly something was off about that salesman cause I have tried tracking him but when he was at the door his presence was so weak he mines well have not been standing there in the first place so I doubt with an energy signature that weak I would be able to find him.”
John nodded understanding and said to me, “If anything I say confuses you, please don’t hesitate to ask I have traveled to the States a couple of times while serving in the military so I can either adapt to your speech or explain mine. Whatever works for you.”
I quietly got up from the bed and tiptoed down the hall hiding around the corner when I heard a rustle of papers, and a man’s voice says “Okay, let's go over these again. Hopefully, that older woman won’t interrupt me again. Though it was my fuck up for leaving the door ajar good job, Bill makes your break in look as obvious as an amateur.”
Bill cowered from me and said, “Look Dipper I don’t know all the answers, and I’m not going to claim to like years ago I am not that fucking arrogant and full of myself anymore so don’t get pissy because you can’t wring me for shit I don’t have the answers to.”
I felt horrible for punching a stranger in the nose even though he seemed to understand why I did it. I figured next time I would lock the door or pay more attention to my surroundings on the off chance he did knock, and I didn’t hear him.
Lestrade nodded. “Yeah, the curator was livid saying that it was one of a kind and costed a fortune after they finally settle on a price with the old guy who said he owned it.”
Bill shook his head, “That’s not how my mother raised me Dipper. My mother would expect me to fix my mistakes instead of running. She said no matter how painful paying for a mistake is paying your debt is always a better answer than running, and to me, I hope if I make amends and face my problems, I will gain someone’s trust back.”
Ch.1 The Soldier and the Sociopath.
I shook my head and said, “You would both think I was crazy if I explained him to you.”
Sherlock snarked back, “Who’s your new secretary I don’t seem to recall you firing Lesley when I was forcefully drug in last?”
I growled, “Why don’t you kiss my pale ass, you pervert.”
He held out his hand, which I shook, finding his handshake gentler than Sherlock’s and said, “Dipper Pines, sir.”
John and I exchanged concerned looks while Sherlock asked one more question, “Any idea where they were heading next?”
John looked at both of us and asked: “Did anyone happen to hear Mycroft’s bodyguard’s last name by chance?”
Sherlock looked at me and asked, “I would like to hear more about this mysterious villain from your past and how he ties into the events of now.”
I shook my head saying, “No, to be honest, I was kinda ignoring him until he addressed me no offense he’s kinda annoying and I am not a fan of listening to someone shit talk my Grunkle nor am I someone who give attention to people that are dicks to there sibling I don’t care who you are that’s just not cool.”
A shiver rippled through Bill, and he said in a small voice, “Yeah, I know. I know that I am going to be paying you in blood, sweat, tears, and pieces of my soul until the end of days to make up for what I’ve done.”
My face heated up, and I said, “What? No. Jesus, do you always get defensive with mortals who know next to nothing about demons?”
“What?” John exclaimed. “Until when?”
They had only just collected their cups and their sandwiches when Sherlock’s mobile buzzed.
“Tea is what’s necessary right now, at any rate,” John muttered, somewhat bowled over by Sherlock’s enthusiasm. In fact, he was not a little concerned. Twenty-six was late for nocturnal emissions, although he supposed Sherlock’s lack of masturbatory habits was a partial cause. And why was his system overloaded now? Could it be…no, impossible. John pushed the idea away. A man that beautiful (not to mention educated and connected) did not become stimulated by a nondescript farmer like himself. It must be the goats.
“Not yet,” he said, and pushed away the fear to focus on the observable facts. The dog was about four inches by six, a rough representation rather than a specific species. It was made of fallow hay, not the straw he had originally thought, and tied with what looked like cream embroidery floss. The eye was a single black boot button. The whole thing was attached to the branch with a willow withe.
“Damn it, Sherlock you are flesh and blood. You have feelings. You have…you must have…impulses. Self-stimulation?” John persisted. Sherlock hunched over his fish skeleton.  A brief shake of the head indicated little; was he saying he did not, or that he did not wish to discuss it?
“Bedtime,” Uncle Gregory said, shortly. “John, you’ll sleep in the hired man’s room. Follow me.” John rose obediently, nodding to Cousin Mike, who was nearly asleep in his chair. He would have nodded to Great-Aunt Martha too, but she caught his arm on her way out of the kitchen and gave him a warm kiss. He ducked his head, but then kissed her back on her soft cheek.
Strongly, and as clearly as he can through his clenched teeth, Sherlock says, “Green.” And then John’s hot, wet tongue is sliding over the most secret part of his body. The physical pleasure gives him chills everywhere and when he thinks
“Yes, please. I wish you’d never stopped.”
He can tell that Sherlock is grinding furiously against the sheets. “Don’t come,” John demands gruffly. Sherlock stops rubbing and concentrates on the dick in his mouth.
Sherlock still felt ridiculous, but he was intrigued by John’s reaction. He observed the dilated pupils and the change in John’s breathing and expression. John had licked his lips. Yes, this was going to be just fine.
Martin picks up his pincushion and heads towards him. “I agree. Now let’s make it perfect.” He fusses over him for half an hour or so. “You’ll have to come one more time for the final fitting, but do not bring the doctor.” He shakes his finger at him. “He’s not to see you before the event. It will be an unveiling."
“Anything else?”
MH: (flame emoji) OMG you look so f’ing hot. Janine just fainted.
“Hi. Sherlock, is it?”
“Good, always let me know. Let’s get you out of there.” He unwraps the ropes, and, within a minute, Sherlock is free. He’s still a little wobbly but isn’t sure if it’s the blood rushing back to where it belongs, the intensity of the new sensations, the orgasm, or subspace. John says, “You have the cutest silly smile on your face.” Sherlock stretches his arms cautiously, and John leads him to the sofa.
“I ah, um. I guess I’m lost... Was looking for the um...bathroom.”
“Officer Gregson, you out there? Pleeeeeeeease? He don’t look good. Come on, I don’t fool around about that stuff. You know me.”
They climb into the back seat. Greg raises his eyebrows in the rearview mirror.
“I don’t like things on my ears.”
Sherlock’s eyes widen. That’s the second time in ten minutes. Once from his only friend and now from his favorite teacher. Have they been comparing notes?
Just then, Lady Gaga begins singing
“It’s kale,” John says; as if this fact should make Sherlock find it desirable. The stuffed chicken that John made for dinner is delicious, as is almost everything he cooks, but this…Sherlock sniffs again and wrinkles his nose.
“Sherlock, thank you for everything. If you need references, let me know. You have been a dream employee. No drama. Dependable. Whip-smart. I expect big things from you. Remember us when you’re famous.”
“Cross my heart.”
“We’ll be lucky if they find us by midnight. We’re in the middle of nowhere. Will you tell me what you see, John?”
John chided himself for making assumptions.
MH: Hang on. B there soon.
Sherlock makes a face. “He’s kind of a jerk.”
“Lavender and vanilla,” John says. “It will relax you. But let’s get in the shower first. I’d like to wash you. Get rid of that jail grime. Will you let me wash you, Sherlock?”
John brings out a bottle of something called Pellegrino and two flutes between his fingers. “It’s not champagne, but we can pretend. It is a celebration, after all.” John pops the bottle open and fills the glasses. He passes one to Sherlock and holds his own glass up to him. Sherlock grins and they clink them together just like in the movies, and they each take a sip. John gives him a look that is meant to be calm and reassuring, but Sherlock detects an underlying eagerness in the expression.
“Yes, it is. Some people view addiction as a victimless crime, but in a hospital setting, that’s often not the case. Anyway, we do random tests to make sure that a vial of morphine or another narcotic contains what it’s supposed to. The hospital has had some concerns lately about diversion, so we’re doing testing this week. Security may be bringing down the samples this afternoon.  I’ll be here to supervise, but Jim will be doing most of the work. You two can observe and assist.”
“Pete.”
Work. He has to go to work today.
Sherlock shakes his head. Shakespeare. Again.
The passengers, probably with this very thought, remained silent.
Kameo here. If you've never seen Aretha sing Nessun Dorma, go here now:
he thinks, embarrassed. And as he remembers lying across John's lap, his cock stirs again. He shifts on the seat and thinks,
He feels dazed and unsteady. The cool night breeze makes him shiver as it passes through his thin shirt and raises goosebumps on his skin where it’s damp from nervous sweat.
George Holmes shrugs. “You’re eighteen. You should be more responsible. Like Myc,” he adds.
“Don’t move!” He commanded. “I’m going to look for some clothes.”
“Yes.”
OK.” Her voice is angry now. “How dare you! How dare you poison that beautiful mind, and how dare you do that to the people who care about you!” Her eyes are flashing, and he’s almost afraid she’s going to slap him.
“Green,” Sherlock breathes.
Sherlock swallows hard and takes a breath.
“So, where do you ride?” Sherlock asks casually.
“Can we watch the parade?”
,” she exclaims, in an accent that sounds like John’s
a big decision, and Sherlock falls into silence, turning the proposition over in his mind as John continues.
He pulled her onto his lap and kissed her. “You are the best, Mary Morstan—soon to be Mary Watson.”
John looked up. Everyone had taken a step back and was staring at him with wide eyes—everyone except Sherlock. Sherlock was watching with calm interest, and the corners of his mouth twitched like he was doing his best to suppress a smile.
John stands again. Holding Sherlock’s shoulders, he says, “Step out of them and then spread your legs. I want to look at you.” Sherlock’s throat tightens, and he fights against the whine that threatens to break out.
Now it’s her shoulders that slump and she looks like she might cry. “I’m so, so sorry. It was wrong. I wish I could take it back. Please forgive me, Sherlock.”
The sounds on the other side of the door tell him that Sherlock is now likewise sitting with his back against it.
“But you said—”
Sherlock was slumped in his seat with a hand over his face. “Oh, Mycroft,” he said softly.
John took the notebook from Louise, then motioned for Sherlock and Anderson to join the others at the table.
Holding the clothing in front of him to hide the bulge in his shorts, Sherlock emerges from the dressing room, red-faced.
“So this is Sherlock. So glad we could finally meet. I suppose you’ve heard it all night, but I’ll say it again. I’ve heard so much about you.” She sticks out her hand, and for the umpteenth time tonight, he touches someone he doesn’t even know.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t dance.”
“Oh, green. Deep, velvety, forest green. The opposite of beige.”
John had been looking at Sherlock with admiration and pride, and not a little surprise, but when he hears her, he turns, glaring, and Sherlock can almost see the daggers fly.
from his backpack and starts reading furiously. He has a few hours, before John shows up, to finish the two books, or at least make it look like he has. Not impossible, given his reading speed. Unfortunately for him, a local equestrian camp brings a herd of squealing middle school girls to the shop on a field trip. He spends the entire afternoon running in circles, answering inane questions, and ringing up souvenir purchases, none over ten dollars. Frazzled, he sighs and wipes the sweat from his head and neck. Hearing a familiar chuckle, he turns to discover John standing by the chaps, watching him while absentmindedly stroking the soft suede. As Sherlock rings up the last key chain, John makes his way to the register. When the door closes behind the final camper, John pulls the handkerchief from his breast pocket and uses it to blot Sherlock’s forehead. He looks amused.
Type One: Girls in love with horses. Little girls, teenagers, older women. What was it with women and horses anyway? They came in in droves, buying riding boots, brushes, jodhpurs and chaps. Plucking show bills from the bulletin board, planning for the next horse show. Giggling. Dull.
“These look delicious,” John says, dropping a jar of blackberry jam into the basket. “I do love jam.” He takes Sherlock’s hand and kisses it. “Almost as much as I love you.” Sherlock glances nervously over his shoulder. The man is still watching them. Sherlock is painfully familiar with this particular breed of human. John, from a different world, a cosmopolitan world, seems oblivious and is already inspecting the label of another jar.
Sherlock finally opens his eyes and rolls to his back.  “Good morning, Sir.”
know how you are. You're a self-centred arrogant dick who never gives a shit about other peoples’ feelings. Including mine, apparently. Always after the rush, no matter who gets hurt along the way. Do you know how that made me feel? How betrayed? Damn you!”
Her cheeks are flushed and she looks like she’s about to cry.
Sherlock, Molly, Louise and Martha set up the Cluedo board. Stamford had persuaded Magnussen to play Yahtzee at the other end of the table. Anderson had retreated to his place against the wall and was reading one of the books that had been left for them. His sour look showed that he was still smarting from the humiliation John had inflicted.
“No, why?” Sherlock says, now even more nervous.
“You need to take some time
. He was not quite prepared for this sight. John had seen Sherlock in almost every conceivable sexual pose, bent over the kitchen table, tied to the bed, folded up, knees to ears below him,
“I’m only eighteen.”
“But I can only be willing to take that responsibility of caring for you if I can be sure that you’ll accept the conditions that will help me keep you safe and help you become who you are meant to be.”
“Ok, then, beautiful, I’m going to move a little bit, just because you feel amazing, and you’re doing such a good job, I’m gonna help, so tell me if it’s too much. Ready?”
John is on Sherlock in a split-second, pushing him against the wall, pinning his upper arms, and kissing him hard. Sherlock opens his mouth and meets John’s tongue with his own. “You look so fucking gorgeous,” John says gruffly, into his mouth. “Tell me. Tell me who you belong to.”
. He assesses the surroundings in an instant. Bending down, he picks up a thick dead branch and, without hesitation, slams it against the side of Sebastian’s head. It makes a satisfying “thwack” and Sebastian drops to his knees. Sherlock is tempted to hit him again, but just as he pulls the branch back, Sebastian sways and falls forward onto his face, groaning. Branch over his shoulder, he takes off for Molly, shouting, “Hey, leave her alone, asshole! Molly! Somebody help!” It’s one of the kids that was in the car that day when his bike was vandalized, and when he turns to see who’s shouting, Molly knees him in the groin and he drops like a stone. She kicks him in the ribs twice, screaming, “You son of a bitch!” They hear voices approaching now, and Sherlock is shaking. Molly looks up and catches his eye for a second before she kicks the downed kid again. He drops the branch, raises his hand toward her and bolts toward the street, pushing through the now steady stream of kids heading in the opposite direction, toward the woods.
“Did you finish the other book?”
Finally, after what seems like a million years, John puts the essay down and looks up. His eyes are shiny with tears.
John takes another strip of cloth from the bedside table and ties it over Sherlock’s eyes so that there is only blackness. “I’ll be right back,” John says, kissing him before rising from the bed. Sherlock listens to John’s footsteps as he leaves the room and returns a few minutes later. He waits, his body tense, unsure of what’s about to happen.
********
. Mycroft,
“Do you trust me to keep my word?”
Sherlock is sitting in the truck outside The Thirsty Scholar and dumps the bag that Pete gave him out onto the seat. Ten bags, a syringe, a metal cup, a stir stick, cotton, a bottle of water, and three condoms.
Sherlock nods solemnly. “I get it. I can say no. Red is my safe word. Right?” He looks at John for affirmation. “Please, Sir?”
“Yes, well you
“That’s good, John. I’ll leave you to it. Keep in touch.”
“All right, Mary. I get it. Maybe you’re right. I’m so sorry. I’ve been a complete arsehole. Let’s talk when I get back.
“No, Sir,” he can’t meet John’s eyes, so he looks at the floor.
Sherlock slides to his knees and wraps his arms around John’s hips, his cheek against the smooth cotton of his shirt. He can feel John’s pulse and the warmth of his skin through the fabric. “Hello, Sir, I’m glad you’re home.”
“You’ve had so much pain in your life, and I’ll not be the cause of more—unless it’s the kind you want.” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches at this, and John continues. “The fact is, I don’t want to wake up without you beside me, or come home to an empty flat, or not be able to kiss you goodnight.”
John looked toward the front of the cabin. The man with the “Mind the Gap” sweatshirt was leaning casually against the bulkhead, microphone in hand. He was no longer wearing the cap and sunglasses.
The courtroom door opens, and Godfrey zips his fingers across his lips to reinforce the point. The defendants file in and are directed to stand on yet more yellow footprints. Sherlock’s case is the first one on the docket. The judge on the bench is an older blonde woman with glasses perched on the end of her nose, “The Hon. Elizabeth Smallwood” according to the brass nameplate. She smiles pleasantly at the cuffed men against the wall as if she were about to renew their driver’s licenses, not determine whether or not they will walk free today.
“Doctor Watson! Benvenuto! So good to see you again!” Angelo grabs John’s shoulders and plants a kiss on first one cheek, then the other. “You’ll have the table by the window, of course. Always the best for you.”
“Exactly right, Sherlock,” John chuckles, “you’re a quick learner. Come, let’s get in the shower, and I’ll clean you up.”
“Are you willing to work hard?” John says. “Even at things you don’t care for, like literature?”
He has half an hour now before he has to leave for work. Just as he gets up to shower and shave,
“Sofa,” agreed Sherlock.
“Oh, god, yes, please, please.”
“Everything I said was true. Don’t be afraid to speak the truth, Sherlock. Jesus was right. It really does set you free.”
John laughs, “You really did. I told you I’d get you to dance.”
“Hmm. Yes. And how about I redden your arse before I tie you down?”
“I’m sorry, Sir. I didn’t...I thought...I wasn’t…” He stops and just munches on the toast for lack of anything else to do.
“Give me a handjob,” John whispers, still looking straight ahead.
Sherlock swallowed all he could and then licked the remaining jam/semen mixture from Johns body. He discovered that blackberry jam improved the taste of semen significantly and filed this information away in his Mind Palace for future reference. After John released his hair, Sherlock remained on his knees between John’s legs.
They make their way inside, and John snags two flutes of champagne from a tray and a cracker with salmon and caviar on it. He holds it up to Sherlock’s mouth jokingly. They hear the shutter clicking of a nearby camera, and John laughs. He pops the whole thing into his mouth while Sherlock shakes his head. John points out a tray loaded with crostini and bruschetta. “You’ll like that. And over there is some prosciutto and melon. Try that too.” Sherlock takes a bite out of the bruschetta, tilts his head and nods. The melon and prosciutto are not as successful.
“Take your hands off me!”
“I’m glad I watched it beforehand, so I know what’s going on. Otherwise, I’d have no clue. But the live music and singers—it’s just amazing to think about how hard it must be to perform live like that. I can’t wait to hear Nessun Dorma.”
His research leaves him hard and dripping, and he makes a deal with himself. Jerk off, and then read until midnight. He slides off his jeans, the list in his left hand. He slips his hand into his boxers and squeezes gently as he scans the items. Once he's hard, it's difficult to concentrate on the list, and his mind drifts.
“Yeah, I’ve heard of it. Would blast the electrical grid to shit. Right?”
“Yeah, OK, but the thirty bucks too,” Pete says.
“Motivating you, of course. I’m going to offer up a consolation prize, if you will. About how many do you think you can do?”
Wiggy spits in his hands and runs them through his sandy hair, pushing his longish bangs from his face as Sherlock leads him down the hallway. “You sure this is OK, man?”
John squeezes her hand and smiles. He says, “I know.”
John leans towards him and whispers in his ear. “That’s my good boy.” He kisses him full on the lips and Sherlock forgets to be self-conscious until he looks up and sees Molly, trying not to stare at them.
Watching John as he sprang into action earlier and how he had kept his cool under pressure was impressive. He was everything Sherlock remembered he was. Through all those years. During that dark time in his life after camp when John hadn’t written him back, he had cursed him, and he had cried over him, but the one thing he couldn’t do was forget him.
She gives him a warm smile. “Of course, I will. I’ll email you the website for the Common Application—most schools use that, and you can call me with questions. We should talk about what schools to apply to—Oh, and I’ll look at your essay.”
“Don’t be so quick to thank me. If you thought you had rules before, welcome to Boot Camp. While you’re here, you’ll have obligations.”
He grins at himself.
made everything so…clear to me. I’m…so…sorry, John. Now…please…kiss…me…before I…pass out.”
Sebastian laughs contemptuously. “You gonna make us, fairy?” He takes another step forward and gives Sherlock a hard push.
Molly pulls him in for another hug and stops for a minute, rubbing her hands over his back with a curious look. “What is that? What are you wearing?”
“Oh.” Sherlock pulls his hand away and looks at his lap. A single tear falls and makes a dark splotch on his blue T-shirt.
“Only if you call me Martha.”
“But you’ll be leaving?” The thought of this makes Sherlock’s insides churn.
He should never have left Boston.
He wakes briefly when the mattress shifts and John’s warm body presses against his back in big-spoon fashion. Then John’s arm slips around him and the words “That’s my good boy,” carry him off again to sleep.
“Relax, love. I’m only going to get you clean.”
?” He winks.
Sherlock nods distractedly, and John takes the menu out of his hand, picks up his own, and turns the two of them over. “Si, grazie, Angelo.”
Sherlock’s eyes brighten. “Well, when you put it that way,” John pulls him up onto his lap, and Sherlock continues, “it’s
*******
“Well, if you ever want to talk—about anything, please call me. Tell me your number now.” She puts it into her phone and calls him to make sure he has hers as well.
John snorts. He sits next to Sherlock again and lays his hand on his thigh. Still looking at her, he says, “She’s a consummate liar. Did she drag that ‘three continents’ story out again?”
“Because I’m just temporary. It’s a game to you, and I’m not worth the trouble. You won’t even let me stay the night—”
Will’s eyes were boring into him, waiting. Right then, John knew that Will was waiting for him to make a move. Either to release him and say goodnight or to kiss him. And John knew which one he himself wanted. Still looking into Will’s eyes, John slid his hand from Will’s mouth to rest on his shoulder. Will’s perfect lips parted, and the pink tip of his tongue appeared and touched his top lip in seductive invitation.
As I said last week, I am still not 100% finished Chapter 13 and work is insane right now so I may have to miss next Sunday. I'm going to try not to, because I do have most of it written, but next week is busy too.
And it was, as far as he knew, the only treatment for hysteria. He was supposed to treat Sherlock for hysteria. Like this.
Sherlock made a horrified face.
“Mary’s there. She’s there. Sholto!”
“They’re meant for each other,” he said, without allowing any kind of emotion into his voice. “It’s funny how things work out. And now I’m going to the pond. Manure is all very well in small doses, but I smell like a public convenience.”
"If the lady insists," John said. She was the most beautiful woman he'd seen in a long time.
John shook his head. Tearing off into the woods and leaving his farm unattended was out of the question. Letting Sherlock go to Richard’s Brook alone was out of the question. Going himself…could he go, himself?
"Why,” he thought, as he --I'm going to LOVE New Moon," thought John, quite amazed at the idea.
And yet the blankets were dry. Sherlock frowned. He rarely woke up like this. Usually, when his cock was this hard, it was before he went to sleep; when he woke up, his bed was sticky. He thought, with a brief shudder, that he was glad for the hypothermia; if he had somehow ejaculated on John in his sleep, he wasn’t sure he’d survive the embarrassment.
“A walk?” Greg looked at John as though he had suggested a waltz. What was this strange child up to? He suddenly felt burdened by his new authority and the responsibility it entailed. He had loved his sister Juliet, and was prepared to love her son as best he could, but how could he reconcile that love with all that being a Lestrade meant? He was not sure he wished to instil honor, duty, and sacrifice in the way their father had, but how else could he do it? Friendliness had been a dismal failure with young Sherlock Holmes so far. He supposed he could do a fair imitation of his father’s sternness, if he had to, and insisting on right was no great burden.
Then, another noise rose above the rest.
“We’ll be there,” John said, and Dimmock, who seemed only too happy to scarper, letter in one hand, bread and cheese in the other. He waved briefly, and was gone.
“Still not at full force.”
“’Course you are.” John shook his head. “I know…I mean, I know it didn’t start most auspiciously…”
Once he had the rough shape of it, he shoved it into his capacious pockets. A new problem presented itself—where to store the thing? He could not, for obvious reasons, carry it in his trousers, nor could he keep it in the cabin. He stowed it in the cloth that had carried his lunch, for now, and hefted his hoe with purpose.
Sherlock shook his head and retreated under his blankets.
"I did."
"Oh, the loft, I suppose."
John snorted, but paused to consider his answer nonetheless.
—and while that was too close to the bone for John to feel quite comfortable, he did have an option.
It’s a beautiful day in the backwoods, isn’t it? That is, until a couple of dead animals ruin things.
“Nothing. This is awful.” He frowned, then, with a swift shift of humour, took John’s hand. John nearly drew away, but let the heat of Sherlock’s large hand comfort him. “Let’s go back by the raspberry patch.”
"Don't worry, the geese will be whole and safe when I'm finished." Sherlock said, with confidence.
“He’s…” How to describe Sherlock? He was so many things. “He’s a scientist. Looks younger than he is. Arrogant, certainly, and really quite rude. Charming, when he wants to, which is rarely. He bakes bread and experiments on my geese. Bit mad, overall, but strangely likeable.”
"Good," John said. He brushed his teeth, quickly, and went to the bed. Naked, he threw back the blankets and got in, leaning against the wall. He did not cover himself.
not an hour ago—damage my buildings, and take up my time just when I need it the most? You deserve to stay right there and be laughed at by livestock.”
Sherlock cut his eyes at him.
“Is that wise, Miss Kuskatoo?” he asked, as her hand disappeared into his own. Her little frame tensed, and both she and Stamford were opening their mouths when he continued “Stamford’s the most appalling hand with pharmacopeia I’ve ever met. You’d be better off with John…er, Dr. Watson, for that portion of your training.”
“My money?”
“I’m perfectly fine,” he said, softly.  He wondered what it would be like to touch John. Not just receive his touch, or brush against him, but to touch him deliberately, and absorb that care and confidence and warmth through his own skin. He threaded his own fingers together to help him resist.
And yet…he felt somewhat abashed to see Sherlock again. Mrs. Hudson’s calm acceptance that he and Sherlock might, or rather should, love one another had made him question himself. It was still unethical, as Sherlock was in John’s care, but perhaps if that were not the case, a liaison would be something to be considered—if he were not so sure of his own fundamental unfitness to love someone consistently and well.
“You two know each other?”
“Backwards,” Sherlock muttered, then looked at John. “Catapulted. Of course. John, you’re brilliant!” he said, and took off at a flat run. John followed as fast as he could this time, and was surprised to fetch up at the little wood on the home side of the south field.
“I will attempt it, since you’re already mocking me.”
I mean, prostate milking is fun, yes. The idea of seminal discharge taking away from other systems is a Victorian one, true. BUT DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME OMG.
“Still a comfort,” Lestrade said, waving him into the house. Sherlock shook his head. How could someone be both so perceptive and so illogical? Maybe it was the rum.
“Sherlock,” John said, blowing out his cheeks. “Later. I’m busy.”
, Sherlock!” John yelled, grabbing Harry’s collar as she chewed up part of his best blanket. Sherlock leaned against the kitchen bench and watched him drag her outside, knowing that his own nonchalance would make John even wilder. He shivered, anticipating, and was not disappointed when John burst back into the cabin, his cheek working and his shoulders set.
The “just friends” situation is working out about as well as expected: John has to listen to Mrs. Hudson praising Sherlock’s arse while he has a prostate massager pamphlet in his pocket, and Sherlock gets some emotional advice from goats. A mysterious event occurs.
After dinner Uncle Gregory said he must take Great-Aunt Martha to buy some clothes for John.
“You’ve never said why you have nightmares.”
When he had tired himself out fighting monsters, he turned and watched as the last light faded from the sky in flaming orange streaks.  He must go home and write it down in the yellow account-book and then read it to Father. Father liked to hear his writing, though he rarely had the strength to give John advice anymore.
After a long moment, John replied.
“I was. But I’m fine.” And involved. So very, very desperately involved.
“And, since we’re on the subject, are you due, John, for a sexual emission?” he asked, holding up his notebook and pen with a we’re-all-scientists-here expression.
“I have to protect my cabin, old boy,” John said, giving him a reassuring pat on the nose as he led him to water. Fresh smoke was billowing out of the chimney, so at least a fire was going. With any luck it would be confined to the stove.
And yet he was not sure he was capable of being clear or doctorly this time. Last time he had been calmer, and he had still felt the hitch in his own breath and a strain in his drawers. Knowing he could make Sherlock climax would make it infinitely worse; enjoying the “treatment” from beginning to end as a man rather than as a doctor was unconscionable. Sherlock had been so soft, so responsive—he had experienced pleasure without a single touch to his cock, and just thinking of that in passing made John dream things he definitely should not dream.
One beautiful day in late June, they were rambling near the house when Sherlock found a perfect, sandy hollow full of wild strawberries.  Exclaiming, John began to gather the bright red berries industriously. Sherlock did as well, although he had thriftily stored the berries in his belly rather than in one of the collecting containers John had liberated.
“Breakfast, eh?” he exclaimed, in a voice so hearty it startled them both.
It was a male, which had been clear from the scent, but even for a male he was truly enormous.  His fur, too, was thick and glossy, and his head was square and impressive. At least four years old, and probably closer to eight. The giant shining claws showed a little use, and there were almost no scars in the skin. It looked very like it had been cared for in some way.
"I just..."
John reeled back, suddenly furious. “You had better bloody not!”
John was nearly at the door. Sherlock stoked up the fire and set the rest of the pie on the table, with two plates.
“Oh.” John didn’t quite know how to parse that particular sentence. “So you’re a bachelor, like me.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. John swallowed a scalding mouthful of tea and licked his lips.
Sherlock forgot his worries over the strange attack while he worked, but the post-mortem was over quickly. The belly contained nothing unusual, and the traumatic injuries to the brain were consistent with accidental impact.
“I did. I was educated at home, after the incident with my dog.”
“I am not hysteric.”
“Beautiful night,” John said, almost dreamily. “I remember, in India, it was always so hot. A night like this was cause for celebration.”
“Not here,” John said in his ear. “Not in the shadows.” He nipped Sherlock’s neck and let him go.
John waited until the now well-known thoughtful expression formed on Sherlock’s face before padding softly into the clearing. His practiced pace got him to within two feet of Sherlock, whose brown study was certainly well advanced. Foolish, John thought to himself; any bear could have snuck up on him, and any person too.
“But your gut feeling.”
And then he did not. Redbeard, indeed.
He shrugged. “I’ve no idea.”
There was no need to panic, John told himself. Sherlock was likely looking at something within sight of the homestead.
"Don't use your voice?" Sherlock's interest seemed piqued. "Aren't you the local doctor?"
Father laughed a little--and there was just a note of triumph in his laugh.
This fic almost had a pair of kittens (called Bonny and Shih, for Anne Bonny and Ching Shih, famous pirates) but I sadly cut it out because I knew it would add probably 5k to the fic—Sherlock baby-talking kittens (“They’re animals, John, it’s quite all right”), John being reluctantly charmed by kittens (Imagine Sherlock seeing them curled up on John’s shoulders at night), Harry and Clara befriending the kittens (both of them can ride on Harry’s back when she’s pregnant), etc.
“He hates me so much.”
“And I thought him showing up here a few weeks ago and telling me that I’d been chopping all wrong was bad.”
“We must be home by dark.” Greg said, and took up the books. They all seemed, to his eye, very new and somewhat unsuitable. He set them aside.
“I thought as much.” John looked around the aisle--empty. He took one cup from Sherlock’s hand and, taking advantage of their closeness, kissed him briefly on the lips. “How was your day?”
“Oh, now, I would never presume.” Mrs. Hudson pushed the cream towards him, her expression so angelic John could barely credit her with her scandalous utterances of the moment before. John took the cream, speechless. Sally sipped her tea.
“Never mind,” Sherlock said, “Salt pork it must be.”
“I don’t think so,” John said, laughing. He had heard stories in the army. “But I have my suspicions. Mrs. Hudson’s hired man, Anderson, is very fond of his horse.”
Clara touched down lightly and flung herself over the outside edge of the pile.
Or …? As Sherlock leaped to the ground, the little creature spasmed and rolled over, clearly trying to drag itself away from the threat. Sherlock slowed his step and extended his hands; the squirrel chittered feebly.
“No young ladies, then?”
didn't cause trouble, he thought grouchily as he fed and watered them. Isadora, the Shorthorn cow, was more of a mix; John never knew whether she was going to kick him or lick him at milking time. Today it was lick, though she was dry at the moment, and John rewarded her with the first turnips from the bucket.
Then John smiled.
Grease in hand, he steeled himself to face the sight of Sherlock curled on the settle, mother-naked. He turned.
"Geese," he breathed, dropping to his knees and studying them for a long moment. "Real, live geese."
“It was my fault!” John said, quietly.
They were wet now, soaking—the rain that had started earlier was pounding through the windows, and mingling with the sweat on their bodies. John stood, pushing Sherlock’s shaking hands away from his own flies.
“I will,” Sherlock said, fiddling with his utensils. “There was something I wanted to say, first.”
"You're right about that," John said. "So the younger women? What about Molly?"
“You should go out and visit with her. She’d probably like a little company.”
But wait—there! Clara had jumped to avoid the flock of chickens and her deviation was carrying her towards the manure pile. If she got stuck…Sherlock lengthened his stride a little further. His muscles groaned.
What did she want? Why were they the target? Why the hair, or the button-eyed dog, or the bear? How had they somehow tamed a bear? Were they responsible for the squirrel? Their aim did not appear to harm, as such; they could have hurt either John or Sherlock very gravely at any time in such an isolated area. Mental torture? More likely; John was very susceptible, as Sherlock well knew, and even he himself was not immune. Certainly, this current situation was one that could cause considerable mental stress… but why? To what end? Sherlock had had little use for most humans, but he felt he had not made any particular enemies; people tended to avoid him. John had more possible cause to think himself a target, but the prospect of his past ghosts being alive or coming from India seemed very unlikely.
"Yes," John agreed. He ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair, then buried his face in it.
“He actually believes that—“
The next morning, John woke to a quiet cabin and sun streaming into the windows. He got up, stretched, and looked upstairs: no Sherlock. He looked at the door: no boots.
“What kind is that?”
“I see.” Despite this admission, John was tempted. “Not much in this lake, though, it's so small. But we could travel up back to Shoe Lake and fish there."
“That’s bloody unfair!” John said, low. His left hand flexed and released. “I’m trying to do what I can, and this is what I can. What’s right.”
John looked up at the sky. The sun was lower in the sky than he liked, and the clouds had massed up while they had been fishing. They were due for more rain, and soon. He decided to set up the fire at the edge of the woods, near a little copse of birch and poplar. They could retreat into the thicker spruce woods behind if the rain got bad, and the horses could be sheltered in the little grassy patch under some birches.
“I know.”
“Goats are better than people, and it would follow that they deserve better treatment.” Sherlock said, and, unwinding himself, stood to gather the dishes.
“That makes no sense.”
“The time limit. Three minutes.”
“He’s truly gone?”
“I do.”
He looked down at Sherlock sprawled on the ground; Sherlock’s eyes were huge, his curls were tousled, and one of his buttons had given way, exposing the pale collarbones at the base of that long neck. Suddenly, John did not want to whoop or leap—rather, he wanted to touch. To dominate. To pin Sherlock down and
John dipped the towel again. A mischievous feeling seized him: he turned to make sure Sherlock could see the curve of his body as he bent to wash his arse, legs, and feet—and Sherlock could, his gaze was like a weight. John could feel himself get harder and harder.
Come and visit me on tumblr, where I’m redscudery, or Twitter, where I go by @scudery. Thanks for reading!
Sherlock reflected on the warm buzzing in his belly and the tight heaviness it had engendered. Mental distraction as well; he had not been able to deduce anything of John’s mental state, remaining rather more focused on his own.
“Heavens, no. He was being educated elsewhere.”
“Big enough for my teams and at least one other, maybe two. The river road is much more travelled than it was even three years ago; I’m getting more, er, custom, than ever before.
They were seated in front of the television in no time, beer and spicy Thai curry in hand. Sherlock set the hockey game to mute, just the way John liked it, and took a big bite of his food.
“John,” Sherlock said, concern lacing his voice. “John.”
“Christ, John,” Sherlock whined, “That’s not where your mouth should be.” “Don’t tell me what to do,” John said, and bit Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock’s cock jumped, and John did it again, feeling an answering pulse in his own.  Then he bit the other side, continuing until Sherlock was trembling.
In most pioneer centres, axes were sold as heads only, at least in part because sending wood handles out to backwoods farms was coals to Newcastle. I’m sure you all remember the part from Little House on the Prairie where Pa carves the axe handle; that’s basically what happens.
[spoilers]
John dug his fingernails into the palm of his hand. How the hell was he ever going to last? He undid his drawers and let them drop.
Sherlock felt his earlier stirrings of desire consolidate in his belly. He was hard, and now he wanted—
Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you see any typos.
Sherlock jumped when John ran his toe along the sole of his foot—ticklish. John, encouraged, did it again.
Dinner was cold bread and cheese again, but at least it was cold bread and cheese in a clean cabin. Sherlock was largely silent, and John the same. Then, mindful of the danger to his livestock, John did his chores before dark and locked the cabin door soundly.
“I estimate the temperature has dropped about ten degrees Centigrade.”
"It really is not such an onerous task for a man like you, Dr. Watson."
So this chapter doesn’t exist now, but for a while Chapter 13 was called “Handyman” sung to the Christina Aguilera song “Candyman.” That was largely prior to finishing this up; originally this chapter had John demonstrating how to jerk off to a trembling unsure Sherlock, but the story took a different turn. I’m SORRY OKAY.
John cut in, “Sherlock, hold on. We don’t
Theodore held his finger to his lips frowning as if telling me to shut up and Mycroft’s face spasmed like it couldn’t decide whether to laugh or frown his eyes taking on a slight emerald green tint around the outside of the iris while said irises seemed to elongate slightly which Sherlock also noticed and spoke up “Brother that thing is manipulating you into doing it bidding due to your position. You need to break its control over you before it makes you do something irreversible and damaging.”
Sherlock seemed unfazed by John’s argument and merely said “A lunatic’s story told with that much discomfort, and visible pain must have some shred of truth, and it piqued my interest, so I am determined to find out if the boy’s mad or if logic and reality are not all there cracked up to be and if I’m disappointed oh well John I have been disappointed by many cases before. Besides there already is a shred of truth to his story look at his arms he said this Bill Cipher creature stole his body and abused him by puncturing his arms with forks well I see several scars that look suspiciously like fork tine holes and I don’t think with how well he functions now after a mere seven years after the incident that he was ever in state of mind so bad to stab himself several times in the arm with a fork. I have never believed in something as ludicrous as magic, but then again, I have never faced a situation where logic and the fabric of reality get called into question so boldly. Don’t you find it the least bit odd that his story comes up right after Ms. Hudson saw that suspicious man in Mabel Pines flat coupled with the boy saying demons do indeed exist and Ms. Hudson’s vivid description of this man? Aren’t you just the least bit curious to see if all these incidents have something in common? The past never truly dies John, and maybe Dipper’s past is coming back for an encore.”
I looked up and sighed “I don’t know everything about him most of my encounters with him were your standard bad guy trying to take what doesn’t belong to him by any means necessary it’s not like he’s your standard Disney villain that monologues about himself in the form of a cliché song or spectacle but pretending to know how a nutjob like him thinks is a fruitless task because just when you think you have solved all of his riddles he pulls five more out of his ass.”
The older woman smiled and replied, “You’re looking at her, dear.”

I smiled and said, “Just turned twenty this August, so I am only eleven years younger than Sherlock.”
Out of pure impulse, I asked Sherlock, “Not to be nosy or presumptuous, but you two seem awful close for just roommates…I uh…are you guys um…dating?”

I sighed and shook my head humorously, making John look at me and say, “Don’t mind Sherlock I swear he was born an old soul already fed up with the world.”
Bill huffed, “Excuse me, Pinetree? I have a penis, would you like proof of such?
Bill said softly, “Yeah, well, this time is different Dipper, I aim to protect you, not harm you Shootingstar would be pissed if she took me in, and I let her brother get hurt having the means to protect him. I don’t care if you hate me or don’t want me watching out for you because I’m going to anyway I owe to you what I should have done for your sister so honestly Pinetree you can kiss my black ass if you think you’re getting rid of me that easily.”
“Is there anything else you can tell us about Bill? I don’t care how wild or unbelievable it is because, after yesterday, I am willing to believe anything if we can see your sister home safely?” John said like a soldier on a mission.
The man whose name I was assuming was Mycroft gave an almost snide smile to Sherlock and asked: “I don’t ever recall you being interested in the fine arts what brings you out today I can only assume it’s a case though I am baffled why a case would bring you to the London art museum?”
I headed up the stairs when I bumped yet again into someone who turned out to be a grandmotherly looking older woman and asked politely, “Excuse me, ma’am, do you know where I can find the landlady, Ms. Hudson?”
The possessed man looked at me. “I am far worse than William, and unlike him, I won’t get outsmarted by a bunch of fleshworms I have part of what I need, I suggest you don’t interfere.”
Theo looked like he was thinking “To be honest I haven’t gotten close enough to him to feel him out totally, but from what I do know he is not the same as he was 40 years ago I sense less darkness and more internalized negativity somewhat similar to what you humans call depression.”
John looked at me weird, and Sherlock gave an amused chuckle as John pointed to his sweater and said: “No one of these. Have you never worn one of these before?”
“You three are extremely annoying when it comes to listening to directions.” He hissed as the air in the flat seemed to get colder than it should be even for October.
if this
I looked at him like a confused fawn prompting him to continue, “You seem to have no problem prolonging long awkward silences, whereas your sister could not stand to keep conversation dormant for longer than a minute or so. One would assume she had confidence in herself and her social skills, where you have little to none. When we first met, you already seem to withdraw where your sister jumped right into a conversation with John and me asking us millions of questions like she’d taken a stimulant. I can only deduce you have anxiety on top of low self-esteem, making it that much harder to assert yourself in a social situation, especially with a stranger in a foreign country. Had I not approached you, one would assume it would be days before you worked up even a scrap of courage to talk to John or I while you floundered in your confusion of where to start looking for your missing sister who is not only missing but from my professional standpoint has indeed been kidnapped.”
Sherlock's face twitched ever so slightly at the name “Billy,” and his eyes held a smoldering anger making them appear a shade darker though he kept his composure and calmly said “People are useless until you at least make it to your second year in college I like my “friends” to serve me a purpose I can’t afford to have useless people in my life now can I brother?” He said this, looking pointedly at Mycroft.
My eyes widened at his spot-on observation, and he must have seen the shock on my face and said: “It’s obvious the strikingly similar appearance similar build, height, hair color, and eye color not only that but you are probably a university student like she was it would only make sense you are her twin and by your agitated state you’re not here for a friendly or calm visit and judging by the small glitter-covered pink postcard you keep fidgeting with she gave you little to no detail or her need for your presence here in London.”
I rolled my eyes at the sadistic demon and said: “If Bill molests me, I am holding you personally responsible.”
I shifted in my chair and said, “Fine, but I’ll warn you shit is about to get weird.
Lestrade shook my hand. “Call me Greg or just Lestrade. It’s all Sherlock calls me pretty sure he doesn’t even know my first name, to be honest.”
Mycroft just smirked, “I would assume not. Well, best not hold up your detective work I am sure the boy wants his case solved so he can return home.”
She started walking away and walked up to a door pulling out a key and opening the door to reveal a neat flat decorated in a very Mabel like way and I settled on her couch while Ms. Hudson sat across for me and said with reservations “You're probably going to find me as loony as the police did, but I know what I saw that night.”
I leaned back in my chair and said: “I was always a fan of Dr. Seuss as a child. One of my favorites was One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.”
He was silent when he finally said, “You hit rather hard for your build.
I looked confused when he said sealed which prompted him to explain “William hasn’t been dead these past seven years he has been floating in the void to kill a Geonyx demon you have to destroy their soul otherwise they just get thrown into the void like scattered particles and depending on their age it may take months to years for them to pull themselves pack together into a functioning form.”
kidnapping. While it’s looking very probable filling the boys head with what-ifs from his past is not going to get us the answers we are looking for.”
Locked By Gravity
That did explain why Bill was back though I asked: “So from your perspective, is he a threat anymore?”
Sherlock looked like he was trying not to break his flat expression when he struck the man, still wearing his calm, calculating look and watched unapologetically as the man went down in a heap thankfully no longer talking leaving John looking shaken.
I woke up hours later judging by the dim light of the setting sun and jolted up looking around to see I was in Mabel’s flat and quickly grabbed my phone to text Sherlock when I saw a text from him already causing me to scroll back through reading the conversation as he remarked I seemed stressed when I told him abruptly I was going home mentions I was not keen on looking at him and said my voice sounded off when a text from me told him I was okay that I was probably getting sick and I often avoided eye contact when I was stressed cause my eyes got weepy looking and it was embarrassing and told him I would talk to him tomorrow that I just needed the night to relax from today’s events receiving a prompt “talk to us when you’re ready” as the last text. I looked around and sighed getting up and throwing my shoes on walking to the nearest store and purchasing the one thing I knew would get him to come out and walked back to the flat and prepped a pot of cinnamon apple tea and set the teapot on table next to the bait which was a small pile of individually wrapped dark chocolates and sat there on the other side of the room waiting when after about an hour of sitting still a slight glow appeared revealing to be emitted by a little yellow triangle that hovered over the plate and grabbed a piece of chocolate in his tiny hands and started unwrapping it.
I sighed, “I’m sure she will be fine Bill, she is pretty resourceful, but it would help if you could give me any clues as to why she might have gotten taken or who might have taken her.”
Ms. Hudson developed a worried look and said, “Now that you mention it, there were a couple of peculiarities that I happened to overlook and one incident that gave me a bit of a fright. The peculiar thing was your sister stopped joining me for breakfast almost a week ago and paid three months of rent in advance, which was odd with how she budgeted her money. But the frightening thing happened almost two nights ago…”
Dipper growled and snapped, “Wish you would have had the same reservations seven years ago.”
Bill snickered “Polysexual to be exact only thing I am not into is cisgender females so don’t worry Dippindots the big bad demon wasn’t trying to make a move on your sister though I became the little spoon a lot in bed seeing as she would hold me from behind thinking it would help my nightmares though nothing says good morning like a pair of double D titties pressed against your bare back.”
I already didn’t like this guy with the condescending way he talked to Sherlock but kept quiet as not to start an argument in public with a stranger who was already getting on my nerves.
I growled and tried to protest but was met with Bill softly running his nails up and down my spine spanning his fingers out hitting all the sensitive places on my back and shoulders before his other hand came up and pulled my head to rest on his shoulder my eyes feeling heavy my brain feeling foggy from the sensation of his nails slowly gliding over the bare skin of my back as Bill pet my hair singing before whispering “Sleep sweet Pinetree I shall leave you a clue to your mystery come morning light.”
John looked worried as the young man headed to the door and asked: “Is it a good idea you sleep in that flat alone? I mean, especially with everything that seems to be happening today?”
Sherlock looked at John in silence before saying, “Love is a distraction. I don’t want someone as useful as John to lose that efficiency because of any romanticism between us.”
Sherlock didn’t seem fazed by the man’s attitude with him like he could care less or was used to it and said: “I don’t understand your neurotic need to bathe when honestly John you didn’t smell offensive or appear soiled.”
John looked curious and said, “The way you said that it makes it seem your family is common for finding itself at the center of dangerous situations. Does anyone in your family have ties to a person who would know of Mabel’s presence here and would be keen on harming her to harm another family member of yours?”
Bill spoke again “I hope Shootingstar is alright it got kinda lonely without her here, and I’m worried sick about her she is still pretty new to London technically I have been here many times in many different time eras.”
Theodore laughed. “Oh child, you don’t want to challenge me to a sword fight, and I don’t want to have to kill you or anybody in this room.”
His neutral expression never changed except for a slight possible imagined narrowing of his eyes, which for some reason (again could be my imagination) seemed to flick upstairs at the mention of the knitted blue scarf around his neck.
The alabaster demon looked shocked and merely said, “I see…I shall leave for now you seem to have more important things to deal with than me I shall wipe Mycroft of this encounter and leave you to your investigation. Perhaps we will have use for one and another in the future, seeing as the plot seems to be thickening rather quickly. Much quicker than I would like to be fair.”
I watched him as he was about to toss the chocolate into the maw his eye turned into when he looked at me and sighed before changing into his human form and throwing it into his shark-like mouth rolling it around in his mouth instead of chewing it. He then poured himself a cup of tea and sipped on it, watching me over the rim of his cup. Looking at him, he appeared to have changed his clothes now wearing a mustard yellow turtleneck and black denim jeans with shiny wedge heel boots his shaggy blue hair held back in a fluffy ponytail. He looked young too, maybe around mid-twenties or his early thirties, then again, I wouldn’t doubt his youthful appearance was supposed to put me at ease. He still looked tired though the dark circles under his eyes, having a blue tint to them. He took another chocolate and unwrapped it curling his long silver tongue around it and pulled it in his mouth, sucking on it like the last one.
I sipped the hot cup of coffee, finding it waking me up faster when Sherlock pulled out a file and the stack of papers in the manila folder saying, “We might have some clues that I discovered this morning while looking for any leads or proof of your sister's kidnapping.”
John gives a mock offended gasp. “Well, I for one loved Dr. Seuss I even had a Cat in the Hat jumper when I was a kid.”
-Dipper does have scars from the events of Sock Opera making him wear long sleeves a lot
I quickly explained, “It’s a nickname I’ve had since I was a kid. It just stuck throughout my life. My real name is Mason, but I prefer Dipper since the only time someone calls me Mason is when I’ve done something stupid.”
“So, are you positive that is Bill?” I asked, trying to get him to speak.
Theodore looked noticeably surprised but had no time to respond, seeing as Dipper came at him, keeping excellent footwork even in my cluttered flat and swiped at Theodore, who quickly blocked with a walking stick he pulled out of nowhere. He fought Dipper off with the walking stick as John, and I stayed out of their way John looking more frightened then I had ever seen him no doubt this being well beyond the strange events we usually encounter only this time the unknown becomes supernatural. The creature seemed to realize Dipper wasn’t giving up any time soon and lunged at him, giving out a fierce growl its appearance shifting making Dipper step back in surprise. What was now standing before us, to say the least, was quite beautiful and to be honest, was hard discern if it was genuinely male or female though judging by the flat chest and noticeable bulge in his trousers he was most likely just an unnaturally attractive demon usually how most demons are in literature. He stood at 6’10 with smooth white skin and bubblegum pink hair neatly styled around emerald ram horns his bright green eyes sat in a black backdrop that looked slightly eerie with his complexion. His ears were somewhat tapered, and his teeth sharp and deadly and appeared almost shark-like. His face held a conflicted expression as his hesitation allowed Dipper to recover from his surprise and swipe at the demon who didn’t block in time and received a long slice across the face causing him to reel back.
Bill looked visibly ill, and hoarsely responded, “You would probably not want to believe it even if I told you.”
The prayer dragged on, but finally Cyrus drained his cup of tea, rose from the table, and said, “Thank you, Greg; thank you, Mrs. Hudson; thank you, ladies.” (At this, both Sarah and Sherlock made a face.) ”We had better be away. Mother, if you will?”
“There are raspberries to eat.” John reached for another handful.
Then the bear shifted his weight, and John knew that there was no longer any time to spare.
“Yes?”
“Is that how it is?” he said, a wicked glint in his eye.
The road trip was, from the beginning, madness.
“I’m warming up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s suddenly anguished face was his answer.
“You’re ...nope, that is what you are.” John said, barely holding back a laugh. “It’s funny because it’s true. But if it helps,” he said, coming up to Sherlock and cupping his cock through his jeans, “I wouldn’t have you any other way.”
Could it be unfortunate personal associations? Could his wife have betrayed him, and so could he have sworn off sexual contact? Certainly in the month that he had been here, there had been no woman here.
“The farmer’s life brings many benefits,” Cyrus said heartily. Joe looked embarrassed, and even Greg’s typical good humour wavered.
“I have companionship.”
The drive-through line was long at the Tim’s nearest the clinic, but John waited anyway, reluctant to leave his car in the icy darkness. Even opening the window to place his order (a #5, sausage & egg sandwich on an English muffin, hash browns, and a large double double) was unpleasant.
“You utter ass!” John exclaimed, and, without further ceremony, he grabbed Sherlock by the collar and pulled him down to eye level. “How dare you endanger yourself and my farm in this way? No, never bloody mind,” he added, as Sherlock opened his mouth—
John sprang across the floor and snatched the book away.
John had to laugh.
John nearly spent himself at that; he bit his own lip and stood, keeping his hands on Sherlock. He stroked his back and flanks, then reached around to touch his cock.
“This may be uncomfortable,” John said. He made his hands and voice as gentle as he was able. “Bear down a little.”
, he had said, in a tone that had, paradoxically, invited insubordination. A challenge. That’s what he needed, what would allow him to stop thinking too much.
"Be that as it may. Oh, here he is. Moving pretty quick for someone in a sulk. Must have seen a bear." Stamford pointed southeast, and John saw a tall shape in the distance. It was clinging crazily to a rangy chestnut mare with the worst trot he'd ever seen. No bears in sight, either. Maybe he'd seen a moose—those, at least, were worth running from.
John eyed his rifle. Sherlock was probably safe in broad daylight—as safe as someone of his idiocy could be—but John didn’t like being unprepared.
"Look," John said, suddenly alarmed, "There will be no experimenting in this house."
The door of the caravan slammed behind them and they were in each other’s arms again. The only light came from a streetlamp on the main path and occasional flashes of lightning; rain blew in through the open window onto the front bed.
“I do not. I tolerate him for the sake of the late Mr. Hudson.”
He looked at Harry and Clara standing side-by-side, eating companionably. Perhaps a platonic pair bond would not be the worst thing in the world.
He certainly had made more work for John, and embarrassed them both in the aftermath.
“What is it?” John asked, kneeling beside him. “What am I looking for?”
"Widow Donovan, hello." Her long strides ate up the ground and soon she was beside him, long black curls blowing in the wind.
“I do.”
“Here, under the horse.”
“I don’t blame it. Don’t worry, though, we’ll run out soon enough.”
“Can you feel any fluid?”
“Appalling. Are you sure she won’t come back?”
Mrs. Hudson was fussing over the teapot when they came in; an array of jams and baked goods was already on the table. John hung up his coat and Sally's shawl, washed his hands in the basin, and sat, helping himself to a gingersnap.
“Course it won’t. You built it, and while you can be an idiot about bees and science…”
“Whiskey?”
"I'll come to the barn this morning," Sherlock said, as soon as John's feet had touched the floor.
“Ah, it’d scandalize the Major, and that’d bring trouble down on Lestrade. And it’s like a holiday, wearing skirts and being in the kitchen, though I wouldn’t want to do that always.”
Greg followed, and steeled himself.
“You don’t. You’re as bored as I am and you want me to stop being provoking.”
"I suppose that is your residence?" Sherlock asked, indicating the cabin with a dismissive flutter of his hand.
“Sure.” John replied. “Why the coffees?”
“And what is it that you plan to do today?” he asked.
“Yes.” The bannock was delicious. John reached for his tea but Sherlock had scooped up his mug and was drinking it in long gulps.
“Good takes time."
When their pleasure hit them, Sherlock felt as though he was being taken by a soft, welcoming wave. John’s gasps and his own mingled in perfect unison.
“Don’t I?” John grinned.
“Fine,” John took the match and knelt at the base of his assigned pile. “Now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Right, then. Into the breach, as it were.
The rejected title for this chapter was “Broke Farmer With Goats.”
“Test it how?”
“I know….I’m sure,” John said, carefully, “that the—whatever is happening—is not for me.. directed at me.”
“Wait,” he said, quietly. “Listen.”
Time slowed; each step seemed to take an endless time, so much that when the sound of Harry’s indignant bellowing came to Sherlock’s ears through the wind he was shocked. They had arrived, and he had not stopped walking. He had not betrayed how cold he was. He drew a long, shuddering breath and swung his arms for warmth as they covered the last stretch.
He raised himself up a little and gave Sherlock’s arsehole a broad lick.
Sherlock did not reply. John waited. When Sherlock’s body relaxed a fraction, John pushed past the second tight ring of muscle. A shudder took Sherlock, sweeping down from his shoulders to his haunches.
If you’re wondering if this was partly inspired by that ridiculous/hot reddit thread about the dude who discovered prostate stimulation, then YES yes it was. I know it’s been done with Sherlock fic but it was so hot that I still had to make this happen.
“Your … rattan cane?”
John laughed. “Harry would thank you. She loathes Frank more than she loathes anything else, and that’s saying something.”
It was during a brief bout of this inattentiveness, as they turned down the east line on their way home, that Sherlock nearly fell into the Bonne Chere ravine.
“We will,” John said, and with that Sherlock had to be content.
Thank you all for your patience. I'm working 50+ hour weeks this semester and I don't really remember how September went. From now on, I am going to go to a monthly update schedule. It's not ideal, but it's what I can guarantee. I'll do my best to update more frequently than that.
Sherlock looked at his hand and raised one eyebrow questioningly. Then he shook his head sadly.
“No!” Sherlock yelled.
The base of the tree had certainly been cut nearly all the way by an axe, and an axe of the sort that was quite common in this part of the world: an iron head, and a handle of some home-whittled wood, most likely maple. No foreign splinters were in the wood, and the pattern of axe blows told no tales either. Any adult of average size could have made the cuts, to the best of Sherlock’s knowledge. He cursed his lack of experience with axe marks.
“He’s…not my...” John stopped. The words fell like ashes from his mouth.
“Scared?”
“All right.” Sherlock replied.
“But, Uncle Gregory,” John exclaimed, “You can’t just let her go! She’ll be lonely.”
“It’d attract bears, though, wouldn’t it?” John had given up on sugar when it had become evident that they would run out.
“Yes.” John said more firmly. He was terrified but also strangely relieved. At least they could acknowledge this infatuation, and thus, perhaps, watch it wear away like any other ill-judged attachment.
John coated his fingers liberally with beaver grease, but Sherlock was so soft and ready that it took no time at all to open him. The most difficult aspect of the operation was holding them both steady—they were both so ready that several pauses were necessary.
“Please,” Sherlock begged, “I’m…”
“Ridiculous,” Sherlock slurred his words a bit, “Thousands of Johns.”
Sherlock’s cock twitched under John’s hand, and Sherlock pushed him away, though without real anger.
“Sherlock,” John hissed. “People have a line of sight right here!”
“We’re getting this over with,” he said.
“You shouldn’t have left it outdoors. I don’t fancy mould up my arse.”
“Perhaps some heaviness in…er, that area.” Would it be enough?
“All right?”
"Righto, Angelo," John said, taking his coat off. "I'm famished."
As he accelerated out of the potato patch it seemed to him that John was shouting something, but as Clara was still in view, and Harry had actually stopped to wait for her on the edge of the track, Sherlock elected to run first and listen later. Surely John would see the sense of this plan, and if he did not, well, Sherlock could always keep running. He put on speed.
“Breakfast.”
“If you act like a schoolboy, why not take the consequences? The rod was clearly applied inefficiently and insufficiently to your arse as a child.”
“You are a romantic.”
“Shameless manipulation,” John grinned, generous in victory. “Unworthy of that great brain of yours. You may walk a mile, perhaps two, but no more. That will take you along the whole south line, and that will have to be enough. Besides, he added, twisting the knife a little, “The north line is right by a bear den—the sow bear up there has got twin cubs, which means she’s unlikely to want visitors.”
“Aren’t you a bit young?” John asked. (Fidelio? Fortinbras?)
John followed, trying to shake the slight unease that had settled between his shoulder blades. There was no reason for people not to pass through this area, although it seemed unlikely, given the lack of roads and, frankly, of destinations. And who shit in the middle of a trail?
Out, and right away. Grabbing the bedframe, he pulled himself to the edge and got up, ignoring the drag of Sherlock’s hand across his arse and the small, sleepy snuffle of discontent Sherlock made at the loss of contact.
“Love you.”
Sherlock chuckled around his mouthful, and sucked John in deeply, his big hands cupping John's ballocks.
“I had not been fully aware of the potential of manure prior to my closer acquaintance with it this morning.”
“Whoever loses has to perform a sexual service for the other for a specified time limit.”
“They didn’t hurt you, did they?”
They walked back towards the hotel, and, without a word to Sam at the front desk, the woman led him up the stairs to a front-facing sitting room.
John stood waist-deep in the water and watched Sherlock stalk into the cabin, doubtless ashamed of his visible arousal. John himself was surprised—not to say a little pleased—that he himself had not felt any undue sexual excitement. A little frisson, certainly, but not the full-blown hunger he had felt before. He had relieved his own needs behind the shanty recently enough (Sherlock had been safely absorbed in compounding violet jelly), so clearly his control was improving. He straightened his back. He might yet make it to September unscathed.
“She’ll hang,” John said, but more quietly.
“Sherlock!” John stood, and eased the massager from his arse as gently as he could. Regardless of germs, he let it drop and nearly ran for the hot towels.
“Gods, Sherlock,” he said, running his hand through his hair. “I shouldn’t have…I can’t.”
This earned him a second snort.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks, turned, and looked, first at the bear and then at John.
“No more than four coffees a day, then. Spoilsport.”
“There were squirrel vertebrae in the human scat as well.”
"More than anything," Sherlock said, and sat on the settle facing him.
Ah well. Once more into the breach, he thought, and stepped inside.
“That. Is not. The point.”
“I cannot compel you?”
Poor John. Bound, in so many ways, by conventional feeling. Sherlock almost let the thread of pity he felt for him cut through his anger.
"Sherlock."
“Fine,” Sherlock’s voice was still muffled, but it wasn’t so petulant, and John felt sure Sherlock would do as he was told. He braced himself and yanked. Sherlock rocked up directly towards him, but not all the way. He dropped back into the pile, with a frustrated “Ugh!”
“You have a nice day, now, Doctor Watson,” said the clerk as she handed his breakfast out into the cold.
“No, of course not,” she said soothingly, bustling over to the kitchen bench. “Well, at least he’s done a good job here.”
He made a decision.
"Regretfully, yes. I hold a number of your debts, now, and I would hate to demand payment immediately."
“I'm sorry.” Had he been too forward?
“It isn't--I'm ALL Watson--I WANT to be,” John said, but he subsided and returned to packing his things. Great-Aunt Martha was pulling clothes from his bureau, tutting at each shabby piece before she folded it.  John was placing the folded pieces in his valise, and Uncle Gregory was methodically going over the room, looking for any of John’s forgotten things.
"But we're going to?"
"Yes. Of course. Wait, no. I'll stand watch for you."
John moved away, back to his work, and Stamford introduced Molly to the other men—without telling them, Sherlock noticed, that she was his apprentice. He did have a certain sense, Stamford, though his face did not give that impression.
They found very little in the woods, though Sherlock was inordinately thorough. Even the few tracks left by the mysterious woman told them only what they knew already: that she was small and quick, and accompanied by a bear. John’s feeling of unease had lifted but he stayed alert, his rifle at the ready.
Mystery notwithstanding, Sherlock’s proper survey of John’s land had not been done, a fact he bewailed at every opportunity.
“I’m fine.”
“Honestly, can’t you two get along?” John asked, rather amused than otherwise.
Sherlock nodded. It would be good to get out of the rain. He walked the last hundred feet to the house, then fumbled at the door until it gave way before him. He reached for his buttons, but discovered that they were completely stuck—must be the wet. He’d leave it on, then. Probably better to keep the heat close to his body until the house warmed up; right now, it was barely warmer than outside, though it was at least dry.
“You mustn’t. You will live so fully, John, your life will be purple and scarlet. Go and taste it, seize it, feel everything that comes your way. Then write, write, write, and make the world see the beauty you see.”
. His weapons were the conventional ones: censure, shame, exclusion.
Sherlock, meanwhile, was racing towards the runaways. As his feet sent the good dirt of the patch flying, he was calculating the number of strides it would take to catch Clara, who, already somewhat impeded by her belly, was the slower of the pair. Twins, Sherlock thought, as he put on an additional burst of speed. He was almost within arm’s reach until she capered to one side, leaping ninety degrees to the right over two rows of potatoes and landing at a run. Sherlock tore after her, cursing. He really needed more running practice and, incidentally, to measure goat land speed. Pre-and post-gravidity, if possible.
Sherlock barred the door again, this time for good.
“Of course. Help me.”
"I can," Holmes's eyes flashed in the fading light. "You stand with military bearing and your accent isn't Canadian, so service, but British service. You've got that scar on your shoulder, so wounded in action, and while there are many places to be wounded in action right now, only two types of regiments wear boots like the ones you have, and those are stationed in Afghanistan and India. And I
"Piss off."
The Easter egg song is “Nowhere With You” by the Joel Plaskett Emergency.
John bit his own lip, hard. “Sit down.”
“Any madness in your family?”
“Like geese, you mate for life.” Sherlock scribbled something else on his ever-present paper; John was grateful that he did not pursue the subject. “Most interesting. How, then, would you rate the bond between your pair of geese? High? Casual?”
John met Lyons’ eyes boldly.
“Sherlock.”
John didn't see Holmes again until late afternoon, when the plow was rescued and Stamford had refused a drink and taken his leave. John thought he heard him say something about "impeding the narrative" as he rode out of the clearing, but it could have just been the wind.
“Science my arse!” John let his voice rise with no small feeling of pleasure. If Sherlock wanted a row he’d get one, and anger was easier than desire—to a point.
Even after two months with John Watson, he was not fully prepared for the strength of the laugh that John emitted. It was a deep, satisfied laugh, and he, Sherlock Holmes, had caused it.
"My brother, as usual, has minimized my scientific interests, which are diverse," said Sherlock with disgust. "He wishes I would write a monograph on medicinal plants, which, I tell you frankly, is almost enough to keep me from doing so. However, I am fully convinced that such a monograph would be profoundly useful, and so I persevere, despite constant familial setbacks."
In. Three
“John!” Sherlock’s voice hit him in the pit of his belly, amplifying the fading buzz. “Do you want me to make breakfast?”
. Something new. Sherlock noted it carefully.
"All right?" He kissed that mouth again, then Sherlock's neck, covering each sleek inch, one at a time, and savouring the intersection of skin and semen. He licked his lips and kissed the notch of his neck.
"Hie!" John yelled, "Get out!" The bear did not react. John shouldered his weapon, but could not get a clear shot; if he missed, he would hit one of his own animals for certain. He started to make his way closer.
might pop down out of a hole like that.
“Hello chaps!” he said, with a wide smile. “Getting a good feed in?”
Their pace was slow and measured, though Sherlock held John’s arm in a very tight grip—out of fear for himself, rather than fear that John would not follow his lead. He had learned, in their time together, that John would follow him to the ends of the earth if he had to. And now John was following him—both home, and then… to bed? Sherlock felt his ears flush in pleasure.
Then, Sherlock fled unthinkingly, away from the cabin and away from John, away from the overwhelming shock and sensation of seeing him in such a vulnerable spot. His whole body burned with exertion, but he kept moving down the southeast line, heedless of any obstacle. Once he reached the track, he turned into the woods, running through the clearish parts until he fetched up, panting, on the top of a small cliff. His legs trembling, he sat on a fallen log, his head in his hands, a crumpled figure in the fading light.
“Good for privacy, though.”
“That too,” John couldn’t help but laugh.
“I was thinking of something else,” he said, glad the fire was already flushing his face, “but since I heard a squirrel not five minutes earlier, I would have heard something like an axe.”
Sherlock looked up, thinking.
