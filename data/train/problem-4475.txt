When Sam lets Eileen go he jumps into signing— he’s gotten good at it, and his words stumble after his hands. He’s earnest and tender, like he’s falling for her all over again.
“Not yet,” Dean says. How long has it been since he got here? It was impossible to tell. “I haven’t seen him anywhere.”
And the quiet breath of a response. Dean’s rumbling, unmistakable voice punctuated with the hint of a cracking. Like the breath it took to say them had gotten trapped in his throat:
Before Cas leaves, he looks around for baby Dean.
Cas doesn’t go to Dean, not right away.
In Paradise, every stab of pain bleeds like ink across a page. It’s infectious. And every one of Dean’s prayers goes straight to Jack. Of course. Dean is Jack’s father, too.
,” Claire insists, glaring at Alex. “It went
“I know, I know,” Junior says. “But after you died, there was a shapeshifter nearby, then a wendigo and one after another . . .” he shakes his head, and turns his gaze on his dad. He speaks like he’s got to get it all out before he loses his chance. “Dad, I know it’s not what you wanted, and I’m sorry. But I did good. I helped people, and I was good at it.” He holds his breath, eyes wide in waiting for his father’s disapproval. And Dean feels like he’s watching an old movie— he’s seen this before, and it hurts every time.
“The individual heavens are starting to break down,” Amara says, her voice aimed at Jack and her glare still fixed on Cas. “You shouldn’t have killed Naomi.”
“What was?” Cas asks.
“Listen,” Amara directs. She holds a finger up, and the Garden quiets around them. The wind disappears. The lake goes still. Not a single branch on a tree moves out of place. The world goes silent, until all Cas can hear is Kelly’s breathing in the house hundreds of feet away. Then, far beneath the silence, there’s a pulse of something. Not quite a heartbeat. Not a humming. Not even a sound. It’s distant, but it’s there.
Dean stands on the porch, watching. He’s never, in his whole life and death, seen Sam so happy. Three people— ages apart and dying at different times, running into each other in Paradise the ways days span years and decades— three people that fit into each other’s lives like they’d be incomplete without them. This is what he died for, Dean thinks. For Sam to have this. So why does he feel so gutted?
“Can you do it.” Jack says. It’s not a question.
“It’s about Heaven,” Jack says, frowning. “And Heaven’s crimes.”
“Claire hit a raccoon,” Alex accuses.
Hope you enjoyed it! I've been going insane ever since 15.20 aired and I can't believe it's been barely more than a week. Next chapter coming sometime this week, and will be from Cas’s perspective-- upcoming on-screen characters include Cas, Jack, Mary and John, and more. Let me know what you think!
“He’s here, you know,” Dean says. “Cas is alive.”
“Is he okay?” Castiel asks. Dean is dead, and that’s all he can think to ask.
The sky’s gone dark above the Garden. The clouds are heavy with darkness and crackling with lightning. And Cas doesn’t understand why. Until he sees the tear rolling down Jack’s cheek. Wind whips at Kelly’s hair. She wraps her arms around Jack, pulling him down into her shoulder. She meets Castiel’s eyes.
He casts the thought out at the river, and freezing water carries it away. Like it was never said in the first place.
For all that Heaven crumbles around them, Jack stops to blink. “Chuck?”
“But it belongs with you, if you want it.”
Castiel and Jack work on the individual heavens, or rather the individual experiences of heaven. Every soul is in Paradise together, and they have to sort out the rules. It’s like picking through computer code, fitting together the puzzle pieces of Paradise itself. Cas builds the landscape, designs the roads and forests and lakes and the sky. The corner that belongs to each individual, and the corner that belongs to Dean. They still seem so empty. Dean drives and sees nobody for hours. Jack and Cas talk through the problem again and again. Slowly, ever so slowly, Jack is working to weave all the little pieces of Paradise together. He wants to get them to touch and overlap, build a perfect world with all the good and without all the bad. It’s a hard balance. Castiel is thankful that he, Jack, and Amara have all spent time on Earth, and none of them have to explain the simple pleasures of Earth to each other. They smile and nod when he talks about the ideas he has. Earth is a blessing in their eyes. What luck to be among gods dedicated to love.
Jack didn’t answer Dean’s grumbles. So Dean went door to door instead—Mary had lumber and Bobby knew how to lay pipes. Charlie, given a night or two to study, could wire up anything. Ellen had redone the Roadhouse’s roof multiple times. Jo and Sam would lift and hammer and saw for beer, and the unspoken pleasure of a sunny day’s grueling work. Dean had picked the perfect spot, right between Sam’s and their parent’s. The sky stretched infinitely in every direction. Mountains rose up in the distance. There was room enough on the property for a house and some gardens, maybe a chicken coop or a pool or a fountain (depending on what type of retirement Dean decided on). Just a ways away, a little path led down to the lake with a dock facing east and the sunrise. After a moment or two, it didn’t matter that Ellen had never met Mary who had never met Jo who had never met Charlie. They breathed in the air—sweet, with flowers blooming in brighter colors and fuller scents than they ever had on Earth—and got to work.
The sixth song on the cassette tape that Dean gave him is called Fool in the Rain. Cas listens to it standing in the Garden of Plenty.
“No,” Amara says, turning those steel eyes on Castiel. “Go, Castiel. But keep it brief.”
Kelly calls them in for spaghetti and meatballs. She teaches Jack to use a spoon with his fork to swirl spaghetti. Amara’s invited to dinner, too. It takes a moment before she drops the dark look and accepts a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. On Earth she had been one for finer things— lobster bisque and quail eggs and boar sausage— but a warm kitchen with happy faces is hardly something to sneer at. Especially when her own family is so far away. She picks at her plate, and watches Kelly and Jack talk about food. They talk over the best ways to eat pasta, whether Jack has ever made meatballs by hand, if Kelly likes spaghetti better than mac and cheese. And the kitchen warms. Cas’s favorite pasta is the mac and cheese Dean makes, but he knows better than to say it. He just serves Jack another helping. And when the meal is over, they debate what food should be tomorrow’s dinner. It’s Cas’s turn to cook.
Cas is listening to Led Zeppelin. He’s sure that he must have listened to it too many times. That any second the tape will snap in half or the music will fade, or whatever happens to cassettes when time takes its toll on them. But it never does. He stands in the Garden, watching apples ripen on a branch above his head. He listens to the ninth song on the mixtape, Ten Years Gone. The words come in distant and warbling beneath a guitar.
* * *
Jack shakes his head.
“I don’t know how to help you,” Jack insists, taken aback by the firmness of Cas’s answer. “I don’t understand why you won’t just go see him. It’s
Jack stares up at her, his mouth ajar, eyes wide and shining. He takes a step forward, then another. He still walks with his hands clenched, his feet hesitant, like he’s not sure if he’s doing it right. Until Kelly takes a step forward and then they’re surging towards each other.
And Dean doesn’t even seem to realize he’s demanding it of Cas. The thought’s bound up with the same ideation as characterized everything Dean did in life.
The bartender sets his glass down next to Dean’s before grabbing them both and nodding in Dean’s direction. Dean goes to pull out his wallet and the man waves him off, “That one’s on me.” The gravelly voice makes Dean’s heart beat faster again but he ignores it in the face of the man’s kindness.
Dean smiles in relief and it’s Cas’s smile in return that gives him all the courage he needs. With his hand still on Cas’s cheek, the anticipation boiling between them, Dean glances quickly across the restaurant where Jo has Ben turned away from them. She winks and Dean smiles wider before glancing back at Cas.
the quarterback.
room for attractive neighbors with an attitude problem.
“Good choice. Mind if I join you?” Dean hesitates at the bartender’s question, this is
The plate drops in front of him and Dean catches his old friend lingering a bit. He looks up and says thank you and that was all it took to spark some small town gossip from Jo. While he didn’t come back to rekindle any old relationships– friendly or otherwise– Dean doesn’t mind her company and before he knows it he’s laughing and taking his last bite of burger. The conversation starts to die and Dean remembers why he came to town in the first place, “Oh! Jo, I meant to ask. I’m fixing up the old inn and I need help. Do you have the number of someone who–”
he can’t do this alone. He realizes the man on the other end of the line hasn’t said anything when he continues, “Uh, that is if you have the bandwidth for that…”
“It’s a
Cas, who comforts him with silence and companionship unlike anything he’s ever experienced. Cas, who tells awful jokes and pulls dumb pranks but never expects more than a smile or laugh from Dean. Cas, whose eyes are so blue that sometimes Dean finds himself lost in them as though he’s soared into the sky. Cas, who’s given Dean real hope for the first time since burying his best friend.
, not much changes— the little touches and flirtatious glances were apparently always part of their routine no matter how blind Dean may have been to their significance— but the line between what’s his and what’s Cas’s is slowly but surely beginning to blur.
and now those thoughts are mixed with the intense
The restaurant is packed today– more than usual– and when he sits down at his regular spot at the bar, the ceremonial shot Jo usually has waiting for him is nowhere to be found.
“Lisa…”
He’s not a teenager.
“How could he do that when he doesn’t know I exist?” The kid says it so matter of factly, Dean isn’t even sure he heard him correctly. He scans him for signs of distress, but whatever therapy he’s getting must’ve worked because the kid goes back to comparing screws without missing a beat.
It just made him fall even harder for the man asleep beside him.
Yes that was loosely based off David and Patrick from Schitt's Creek.... can you blame me?
Dean opens the sliding glass door and Cas turns around at the sound. He smiles brightly before he realizes just how determined Dean is to cross the lawn. At first he looks concerned, but then his gaze flickers down and Dean watches his boyfriend’s eyes go dark.
And he

Then he’s on top of him and their lips are connecting before Cas trails down his neck and bites

out of the question that Ellen would’ve hired on more help that Dean wasn’t aware of, but the change in staff feels monumental.
“Then why do you look
Not that he minds.
Castiel nods before taking time to study Dean until it almost feels awkward. Dean is typically the one doing the studying, and he feels naked under this man’s gaze. They remain in a silence delicately balanced between comfortable and awkward until Castiel speaks again, “Well, best I get back to my place. I will see you tomorrow morning, Dean.”
It’ll only be a problem for him once his adoptive-sister is fielding phone calls from kindergarten when Claire calls an Excavator a “Whoozitkabob”.
Besides that, they move on with their days a lot like they always did. Saying goodnight lasts a bit longer and sometimes Cas spends the night. They wake up and make coffee and toast and talk about their renovations for the day and get to work.
He feels regret, shame, disloyalty, sadness, but most of all he feels how badly he wants
They finish their walk through and Dean is relieved to hear that Castiel agrees the upstairs mostly needs some fresh paint. John left some money to fix up the inn, but not enough for a total overhaul. After working through the budget, they decide it’ll be more cost effective if it retains its original charm.
Another slam into his thumb jolts his train of thought off its tracks and convinces him to pack it up for the night. He snaps the tools back into his massive toolkit and stands back to look at the old built-in shelves he decided would probably be the easiest to tackle on his own. Nodding at the good-enough outcome, he turns to scan the rest of the main floor.
Jo doesn’t look convinced, “Bullshit. You did
“Ah, well, that truly
Faced once again with the leaded glass and heavy wooden door of the Roadhouse, Dean takes a deep breath.
He recognizes his own handwriting first, ignoring the absolutely stupid way his gut flips at the thought of Cas keeping this napkin all these weeks.
He’s not a nun, Dean’s been attracted to people for as long as he can remember being alive. From Lucy Jones in kindergarten to a myriad of characters in his adult life, he’s always been a
Then he goes for it, the monumental shift from strangers to more not seeming so scary now that he knows the feelings are reciprocated.
Maybe Dean isn’t wrong about him.
this and Lisa would want this for them, too.
That’s all the encouragement he needs.
Curiosity getting the best of him, and the rest of his customers satisfied, Cas walks over to the far end of the bar to see what exactly was worth a parting kiss.
Jo rolls her eyes as she always does when he uses air quotes but otherwise keeps her face almost comically still, clearly waiting for further explanation.
But this inn feels like it’s meant to be shared, and Dean can’t seem to find any reason not to do so with Castiel.
His budding friendship with the blue-eyed bartender is simple and without the knowledge of past pain that taints the rest of the pieces of Dean’s life.
He crosses the living room and sits down next to Cas who has turned his attention back to the tv. Dean instinctively reaches for the back of Cas’s neck, playing with the small tuft of hair at the nape. Pondering the show for a moment, Dean waits for a commercial to speak. He likes when they do this, the comfort of the silence is new to him. There are a million ways to ask what he’s about to and he’s running through them all in his head when a commercial for some medication blasts on the screen and Cas closes his eyes to lean into Dean’s touch.
“Cas.” Dean looks like he’s mulling the nickname over like an award winning wine and then he smiles. “Well, it’s an absolute pleasure to meet you
“I’m glad you think so. I suppose we should discuss payment…” Dean trails off as Castiel’s gaze becomes confused.
“Uh, hi. Yeah, uh, is this Castiel?” It’s the first time Dean’s said the name aloud and he can’t help but notice how easily it rolls off his tongue.
“See ya, Lis.” He whispers it almost inaudibly, taps the carving once more, and leaves the Roadhouse for what he intends to be another month.
Dean racks his brain for any recollection of someone named Castiel from their childhood but the name doesn’t ring a bell— and a name like that
won’t be so bad.
He tells himself to settle down– there’s no way a man
“Fair enough. Here, you’ll want these ones,” Dean grabs a four pack of the screws the kid is looking for and hands it to him. “Then you’ll have extras in case you need to replace another one.”
Dean ignores the voice in the back of his head telling him this is make or break. It sounds a lot like Sam.
if he hasn’t needed to carve out time for his own release each day. He’s positive Cas has noticed so he tries to keep his distance when riled up.
Cas’s eyebrows shoot to his forehead in shock as blush creeps across his cheekbones. Dean holds his gaze, eyes begging for some sort of explanation.
of sex with
) and Dean speak at the same time, both turning towards the woman Dean hasn’t thought about in years. They were something– more than something– for about a year, but John’s pressure pushed Dean out of town and Lisa refused to leave Lawrence... so now they're here, awkwardly looking at each other in a hardware store.
Castiel is slightly overwhelmed, and he can’t quite come up with a reply, his chest still heaving with deep, full breaths.
Because there's the tightness, and warmth, and he can’t even remember how long it had been since the last time he’s been inside someone, but all he feels right now translates to one simple sentence, and it just rolls off his tongue freely.
«Dean, mhf...» Castiel lets out a broken moan and his whole body quivers as the first spurt of cum shoots out. The sticky warmth suddenly hitting Dean’s fingers has him giving out right after, and with one last jerk forward he follows him over the edge, a cry of his own pouring out of his lips.
There's really no action in this chapter, sorry. I just had a great time exploring their interactions outside of sex and/or work, because I think there aren't enough fanfictions where they just have some lovely casual chats about random topics.
«Is this fine?» He asks with a bit of apprehension. It’s not the first time now he’s hugged him without any layer of clothing on -underwear not withstanding-, but it has never been during any sexual act.
But for once, he wants to know what it feels like to be on the other side.
The question seems to come a bit late at this point, Dean thinks.
«Spread yourself for me.» Castiel’s husky tone commands him, and Dean doesn’t need to be told twice, clasping at his ass to get himself open. The angel trails down his crack, teasing him around his hole.
They bicker about it, but they both know it’s a farce. Yes, getting off on a God-like complex probably isn’t exactly holy, but he still holds some decency over his profession, or so he argues. Dean respects it, really, even as he pretends to make a fuss.
«Oh come on, that’s not a generous review. I want proper feedback.» Dean complains with overblown grumpiness, nudging his head against the angel’s hand behind his ear.
The first few times they showered together, they did so carefully, with the lights off. Castiel appreciated it a lot. As he gained confidence, warm candles were lit up, the flickering flames dancing on their features, suggesting his outlines rather than highlighting the details of his body. And now, he doesn’t mind leaving the lights on at all, unphased by Dean’s soft gaze.
Tonight, Castiel lays on his left side, spooned into the curve of Dean’s body under the covers, the hunter’s steady breath in his ear and his right hand caressing his bare waist. His hands are big, and his fingers a bit callous against the soft skin on Cass’s side but the angel cherishes the sensation.
The thoughtful question makes the angel’s heart flutter, feeling cared for, revered.
Dean’s thumb still draws circles on his waist, informing the angel he isn’t yet asleep. And Castiel is now undeniably hard, so much so that he knows he’ll have to do something about it because this erection will not go down on his own anytime soon.
He gives in.
«What about we do it tonight?» The angel muses as the kisses get more heated.
The beer selection changes periodically, and it only features local brews with silly-sounding names which Dean always makes fun of, but secretly enjoys very much.
Falling asleep with Castiel helps though. His lover’s presence seems to keep the nightmares away most of the time, which lowers his ‘just awakened grumpiness’ by a considerable amount.
«Right. Cass, if you trust me enough to try it, then yes, I'd happily take you up on your wish. But you have to be real with me, ok? If anything, and I really do mean anything, feels off you tell me immediately. Think you can do that?» He explains the condition with firmness, but there’s a complicit smile on his lips as well which suggests he’s very keen on the idea.
«Yes, this is very much fine.» He assures, squeezing Dean’s hand over his heart. «And Dean… I love you.» He adds.
And so they sit, with their glasses in front of each other while some obscure alternative rock plays on the vinyl player in a corner.
«I’ll get us cleaned and I’ll find some new underwear and a shirt for you. How does that sound?» He soothes, his eyes looking for confirmation in Cass’s own. The angel nods, grateful.
«Dean.» The angel calls as he turns open the little metal container and examines the pointy teeth inside. «Have you ever tried weed?».
The hunter huffs. «Flatterer.» He rebukes, covering up for how proud and fuzzy that makes him feel.
Castiel doesn’t really smoke, Dean struggles to convince himself when the angel lights up a cigarette after sex, even if that never happens more than once a week and the angel has never a strong craving for them. But the nicotine after an orgasm feels good, or so Castiel says.
They had angry, drunken sex that night, but that isn’t either here or there to recall now.
They stare into each other, awe-struck, pupils dilated, their faces flushed and disheveled, both overwhelmed by weed’s heightened sensations. For a moment, neither moves. The angel’s hands clasp at Dean’s waist, while the hunter’s clutching at Castiel’s shirt.
He slowly shortens the range of his movement to start focusing on the ring of muscles there, circling around it. He can feel the angel’s breath getting deliberately deeper while his pulse quickens. He plants a kiss on Castiel’s neck and then rests his forehead there.
realizes what Cas said…
“Just ask him, Dean.” Sam sounds frustrated on their third phone call today. Dean has been pacing back and forth in the kitchen all day. They finished the inn a week ago and have essentially been playing house, neither of them making the move to either sell it or live there permanently. He knows Cas would live here if he asked, but he wasn’t sure how the financials all worked out. So he called Sam who assured him that if he kept the inn an actual operating inn he would be more than ok.
What Cas lacks in experience he is
Cas turns his head to kiss Dean’s wrist (now resting on the couch) and Dean smiles. They’ve got a lot to work out– Dean doesn’t know the first thing about running an inn– but the nervous fear that would usually accompany Dean on a step like this is nowhere to be found.
He reminds himself Lisa is dead and wouldn’t know that he kept up their tradition. No one would blame him or even care if he got up to leave. No one cared when it took him almost a year to even park Baby in the lot let alone come into the Roadhouse. No one bats an eye that even now it’s only once a month.
to be for whatever innkeeper his parents had hired, but when the inn closed they rented it out to whichever soul felt like a one bedroom one bathroom home was enough to live in.
As they reapproach the construction site and their front row seats, Claire stops walking and Cas almost trips trying to stop with the same abruptness.
(They do.)
He puts the glass below the counter and turns to reorganize the bottles on the back of the bar when he sees Jo staring at him. “Take a picture, it’ll last longer.”
They’ve seen each other three more times since then, but never long enough to even exchange names. Dean isn’t sure why he’s keeping track– each time just as unpleasant as the first. Sure, Dean could’ve been friendlier, but warning bells rattled through him every time the neighbor’s stormy eyes met his. Dean may have sworn off unnecessary human interaction for the foreseeable future, but he’s not blind and his neighbor isn’t hard to look at.
He’d give his soul to help that sadness subside.
he shouldn’t let a six-year-old wander toward an active construction site he also knows he would never have the guts to approach the man otherwise. He does a quick sweep to make sure there aren’t any Thingamahoozies around and that there’s a fence and decides they’re probably fine walking closer.
Cas, who is talking to him right now and upping the word count and Dean has
Dean isn’t sure what compels him to grab the bar napkin and a pen, but he assumes it’s the company– something he hasn’t felt the need for in far too long. Leaving a generous tip and the short note, Dean waves at a frazzled Jo and glances once more at the back of the bartender before taking a deep breath. Keeping each part of the tradition as alive as possible, Dean kisses his fingers, and runs them gently over the ancient, small carving in the bartop wood.
Hearing the words he
It doesn’t take long before Cas finds himself again and is moaning into Dean’s cock. Dean just about loses it when Cas’s cheeks hollow out. He whispers, “That’s it, Cas. Right– there–”
(He had to feign a trip for ice just to calm down at the mere sight of him.)
sorry, this is three parts now <3 also I'm on s8 now :D let's keep pride going into July! *rainbow kicks*
can he wear a flannel and jeans.
Dean can’t begin to argue with the sound of his name mixed with Cas’s intense want so he nods.
Then he notices an addition in blue:
“Inside.” Cas whispers, but with his deep voice it sounds like a command and if Dean isn’t careful he’ll come right here in the backyard. He’s positive he looks totally wrecked when he nods in response before allowing Cas to grab his hand and lead him into the downstairs bedroom.
Dean reciprocates before throwing it back and relishing in the burn of the liquid traveling down his throat.
he knows his feelings for Cas are anything but one-sided.
Two weeks after Dean opened up to Cas about Ben, they’re in a heated discussion over whether or not baseball has too many innings— Cas thinks there’d be more mass appeal if the games weren’t so long and Dean isn’t sure how something coined “America’s pastime” doesn’t already have enough ‘mass appeal’— when Cas is pulled away to help Jo clear a few tables.
“This is mommy and daddy’s
And Dean can kiss Cas whenever he wants.
. . .
Bastard.
Luckily, this time, he works through it uninterrupted and is able to walk through the door.
Patience becomes a sort of mantra for the bartender— each new day adding to the tally of days since he last saw or heard from Dean.
“What’re you having?” The man’s voice is
He’s been at war with himself since he left the bar three weeks ago. The ache of Lisa’s loss is still ever present but starting to feel more like a bruise than an open wound. Everyday Ben reminds him more and more of his first love, but the affection is no longer accompanied by grief. Dean feels as though the greatest gift he could’ve received was Lisa living on through their son.
Ben takes Cas’s hand immediately, “Hi Casteel! Daddy made me put on my new shirt to meet you so you must be
Dean does his best not to analyze the way his stomach flipped at Ben’s quick approval of Cas and his invitation to the zoo— and the way he totally butchers his name.
As long as his heart doesn’t beat straight out of his chest.
Cas laughs and the joy of it shoots through Dean like a direct shot of serotonin, “No, unfortunately I do not have my own honeybees.”
that prepared and cited the fact that Cas only lives thirty steps away from the inn. He simply shrugged and said “You never know” and that was the end of that. Dean supposes Cas was right and the change of clothes had come in handy.
Kids, man.
It’s nearly impossible and today in particular is proving to be excruciating. Cas is weeding the garden while Dean puts in new edging. Everytime he looks over he can’t help but notice the way the sweat trails down Cas’s features before disappearing below the hem of his shirt. Every once and awhile he uses his toned forearm to wipe the sweat away and Dean feels his resolve weakening.
Well, 35 words now.
He’s about to correct her when she surprises him with a hug.
Dean opens the door to the man he’s now seen a mere four times despite his permanent residence on Dean’s property. His neighbor— Castiel— looks different today. The usual softness that accompanies the man overtaken by strong arms, an AC/DC t-shirt, and a tool belt placed perfectly on his hips.
, and his implication that this is
it almost stops Dean from parking the Impala.
Cas could swear Dean’s eyes twinkle before speaking again, “Well maybe I could teach you… uh… over dinner?”
Then the bartender appears and is walking his way and Dean decides to stay resolute in his decision to keep up their monthly promise. He isn’t sure of the rules, but he thinks promises don’t end with ‘til death do us part so Dean stays on the stool as the bartender approaches.
It settles in and Dean’s eyes shoot open. He searches to see any sort of acknowledgement in Cas but his eyes are closed in pleasure. Dean sighs in relief, assuming he’s dodged the bullet of scaring a man off by saying “I love you” the first time they sleep together.
He thinks Leonardo Da Vinci may have been a time traveler because when he described the perfect man he must have been talking about
unaware of the absolute stupor she’s put her uncle in, continues chatting, “Oh, he’s not my dad, that’s my uncle, Cas.”
Cas waves as he cleans up Dean’s glass from the bartop at 3:30 p.m. on the dot.
it has something to do with him, but due to the fact they’ve probably shared only 30 words in the whole time they’ve known each other, he’s not sure that’s the most logical conclusion.
Jo gives Cas a sad smile, “You’d be good for him, and I think that’s probably what scares him most. Just… don’t give up.”
Then he turns back to his son, who’s now staring at Cas with wonder in his eyes that Dean can completely relate to, “Ben, this is my— this is Castiel.”
Finding what he assumes is enough cash, Dean finally looks to the bartop for the receipt but finds only a slightly crumpled bar napkin. He looks at Cas, whose gaze is trained so intently on the utensils you’d think he’s on guard duty in case they up and walk away, before reaching curiously for the napkin.
Most days? Dean is at the Roadhouse “most days” and Cas is
“Oh– uh– Jameson.” The bartender locks eyes with Dean as he orders and Dean has to tell his heart to calm the fuck down.
“Let’s go.” He leads Cas to his car without looking in his direction or answering his question. As Dean walks around the back of the impala he sees Cas smirk again.
Up until now every “big decision” in the relationship he’s been able to pawn off on Cas– inadvertently or otherwise. Cas called himself Dean’s boyfriend, Cas met him halfway on the lawn, Cas was the first one to bring up lube…
“All clean… I– uh– got tested... after our first date.” Dean diverts his gaze, but still sees the smile and blush that creep along Cas’s features.
They didn’t exactly end on
But then Cas is speaking and Dean, once again absorbed in his own thoughts, catches the end, “... and I love you, too, Dean.”
For a moment, Castiel wracks his brain for an answer he knows he won’t find, but shakes his head solemnly at the realization he may not know Dean Winchester as well as he thought he did. Jo nods curtly, “That’s what I thought.”
a good look but also by his extreme want to objectify the same man that made Claire stop in her tracks, Castiel just stands there.
She shoots him an apologetic look before turning to the next table to get them their food.
Though, not exactly how Dean thought they would.
she’d get out of this town, break the chains of her mother’s legacy, but nevertheless here she is– here they both are.

This must be heaven.
him to be happy—
Walking through the front door of the restaurant-meets-dive-bar, the familiar smell hits him like a breath of fresh air. He can’t believe he held out for almost a week before eating here. The Roadhouse is one of the few places left in the town left untouched by rotten memories and painful nostalgia. Nothing but good ever happens once he crosses this threshold and it’s that fact that allows him to relax for the first time since moving back to Lawrence.
And neither is Jo.
He’s tried to largely ignore the growing attraction for the man he’s working with for more than eight hours a day, but it gets more difficult with each glance to make sure the other is still in one piece and every accidental touch of hands when they pass off a tool.
Still, Cas grabs the napkin and attempts to decipher the shotty handwriting marked across the napkin.

Dean facepalms to hide his smile and proceeds to rub his calloused hands through his hair trying to decide what to say next. But Ben must be oblivious to the absolute shit storm happening a foot above his current height because he chooses this moment to chime in, “I was confused about which screws to get and Dean offered to help, Mom. That’s all. And look,” Ben holds up the package Dean handed him what feels like an eternity ago, “Got ‘em!”
He shoots Cas a ‘

With Claire satisfied and looking again at the construction site, Dean looks back toward Cas with nervousness etched across his face, “Is— uh— I mean— if you want to..”
For the rest of his shift Cas wonders more about Dean than he has in the past three weeks. He didn’t think it was possible– all his thoughts already consumed by green, flannel, and scruff– but it turns out it

Pointing curiously at all the different types of trucks, Claire asks Cas to name them off, but Cas truly couldn’t guess the different names for these things if his life depended on it. At first he tried Googling the answers, but Claire’s patience waned so he started just making them up instead.

He’s not used to this immediate willingness to help a complete stranger. He’s about to stumble through a response when he realizes Castiel is no longer on the other end of the phone. He shrugs, and sets it on the counter as there’s a knock on the door.
be keeping hydrated.
“Ben? What’s taking you–” Dean winces, he’d know that voice anywhere and the fact she paused means… “Dean?! What are you doing talking to… what’s going on here?”
Shit.
“I have a son.”
Now he measures their time apart in the same way— 25 and counting.
I am asexual. My amazing beta Luke and my good friend Meg helped me work through my FIRST TIME EVER writing smut. Please be gentle and kind <3
When he finally gets the nerve to look behind the bar, his breath hitches and Dean feels like he’s seeing Cas for the first time all over again. Without the weight of guilt and conscience dragging him under a dark cloud, he can see everything Cas must’ve seen for the weeks they spent chipping away at small pieces of one another from across a bar.
Cas is about to object but then Dean laughs again and says, “Of course! I know the
Lisa always measured their time together in months— 76 months abruptly stopped without warning.
“You tear down Heaven and build up a new one, but can’t find the time to drop a house here or there for guy to move into?”
“This is Heaven, though,” Dean says, half a question. “Right?”
about you,” Eileen insists, and sniffles.
“He’s not in the life,” Sam says, talking about his son. When he says it he gets distracted by his wedding ring. He plays with it, not quite looking away, but not quite looking at Dean either. The ring glints in the light. Sam has a wedding ring and a wife and a son and a house. “Not exactly. He tried hunting, sort of, but he doesn’t have it in him.” Sam opens his next beer— he’s twelve or thirteen beers in, drinking for the sake of something cool going down his throat, and he never gets drunk. The beers stay cold, condensation pooling in little rings on a table that never stains. “He has the tattoo, and he knows enough to take care of himself, and others. And he loves the lore, all the books and everything. But he doesn’t hunt.”
“Mom, I just got here,” Junior laughs, signing it in addition to speaking it. He moves more fluidly than Sam does, the expressions of his face falling into perfect rhythm with his signing. He’s properly bilingual, and Dean can see the pride shining in Sam’s red and bleary eyes.
“She grew up well,” Sam says, nodding at it. “Dean loved her, and she stayed on our couch all the time between hunts. She must still be out there somewhere.”
“Fine,” Dean said. The fishing gear lived in the front closet, and Dean cast it in with the care of an ungrateful teen and shut the door behind. When he needed it again, it would be as organized as he wanted it to be.
Amara thinks it over a little more. Around them, the warehouse is fading quickly to almost a smearing of white. Without shadows, everything is flat and empty, like a cartoon. In the featureless white, there’s a flash of blue somewhere that makes everybody turn.
«Could you… get closer, please?» He pleads, with uncharacteristic meekness. Dean obliges, bringing his body flush against the angel and embracing him with his free arm.
«Yeah, once, ages ago. During high school.» He recalls. Castiel keeps enquiring.
I thought it'd be fitting for Dean, who's so into pop-culture and cult movies, if he held to the memory of properly going to a cinema, especially if he shared the experience with his brother. I initially thought about Jurassic Park even tho the release date didn't quite match, but when I discovered Groundhog Day came out in February 1993... Well it wasn't too farfetched to think perhaps some cinemas would still show it for Sam's birthday in may, and I just had to do it, you know, considering Mistery Spot and all that.
Its weight and shape are still familiar as he turns it around in his hands. He can’t help but look at it fondly.
Dean’s hands rub his back in a soothing massage, undoing the many knots in his muscles of which he wasn’t even aware until they relax under Dean’s touch.
The statement piques Castiel’s curiosity. «Wasn’t it your grandmother’s name?»
«Fuck.» Dean cusses breathlessly and he picks up the pace of his strokes. The angel’s now positively grinding against him and it’s such an unexpected situation that Dean can’t exactly process it, yet it turns him on like crazy all the same.
He sighs. Truth is, he has grown quite protective of the angel. He knows well enough that Cass was born before most of the stars dotting the night’s sky or that he has lead troops of his brothers and sisters through sieges and open-field battles, that he is not nearly as clueless as he lets on at first glance, and that, if he wishes to, he has every right under the sun to have some adulterated fun with substances.
He usually wears one of the hunter’s old t-shirts to bed, but Dean has just finished massaging his back and he doesn’t feel like getting up just to put on a shirt.
Dean recognizes the gesture and places a soft kiss on Castiel’s nervous fingers.
Hope to catch y'all soon enough! :D
When Dean opens his eyes, his sight is flooded by the morning light. He blinks and squints them for a moment to adjust, then glances to his left to check if Castiel is still there. He’s not surprised or worried when he doesn’t see the angel.
Dean has always been cool with physical gestures in front of others. He can’t be arsed to care about what people think of them kissing or holding hands.
They moan into each other’s mouth, and when Dean starts to grind back, eager for Cass to get rougher, the angel picks up on the clue and shoves in further, faster.
They bicker a bit over buying THC-laced cookies in addition to the small packet of buds that Castiel has picked out.
Dean chuckles, but he’s rather impressed by how much content the angel can chew through. «Cass, that’s not what we’d call lighter.»
"The Green Holden" is a reference to the title's translation of The Catcher in the Rye in my mother tongue ("Il Giovane Holden", in Italian). Also, I'm quite fond of beers, and I like overthinking about the tiny things those two would enjoy in their off time.
«Not… great, to put it mildly. There was this couple, they were the stoner kids of the school and well…» He pauses, chewing at his lips. He tries to get his fluster in check with a sip of beer. «They were kind of open, and flirty, and both very good looking. Hell, I thought that if there were a girl too in the mix it wouldn’t really count as a gay thing, you know?» His voice is thick with embarrassment. It feels stupid now, how he used to bend over backwards to try and brush off his sexuality.
«Do I really need to answer?» Dean feels the angel shake his head just behind himself on the pillow.
They ease against one another into more tender caresses.
«You’re such a drama queen, Cass.» Dean scowls affectionately, pinching at the bridge of his nose with soapy fingers. The angel pouts at him, disgruntled.
«Then I assume bloody good.» Dean counters against his skin. He leaves a long trail of damp kisses all over the angel’s back, with lots of twists and turns that leaves Castiel wondering where the hunter’s lips will venture next.
My characterization of these two comes from the first five seasons only, as I haven't watched anything past that.
Dean feels a bit out of place and a bit too old for any of this. He hasn’t smoked weed since that time when he was sixteen, and it felt way sketchier to come by it back then. He shoves the memory out of his head with a grimace. By any means, it hadn’t been a positive experience.
«You were dealt a lot of pain in your life you never deserved.» The angel whispers, combing through the short chestnut hair.
«Take me, please.» He growls, his want so intense he feels like he could shatter if Dean waits any further.
With the sunrays pouring from the window, Castiel looks like he’s glowing, and the way the light filters through his hair around his head almost gives off the illusion of a halo. It’s always impressive how angelic he looks even in his vessel, like it’s a quality so ingrained to his being that it comes through in all of his forms.
«But… There is one thing I’ve kept for a while now.» He says, his voice wavering uncertain like he’s not sure he should be talking about it.
The analogic clock on the bedside table ticks away the seconds in the quiet room.
«Yes, I guess that’s true as well, but it’s not what my mother used to tell me when I was a kid. She had her copy of that book on her bedside table at all times. The cover has an abstract graphic over some black background. I thought it looked really cool for some reason, so I kept pestering her to read it to me. She wouldn’t, saying that it wasn’t a children's book but that I could read it for myself when I was older. She’d tell me it was her favourite book, and that she had named me after one of its main characters. When she died, I raised hell to get that copy from our burnt down house and somehow, it worked. The book had miraculously survived the fire and dad retrieved it for me. It is probably the only thing I’m grateful to him for. I learnt to properly read with that novel, even if my mother was right, it’s not exactly for children. I didn’t understand half of it, and the other half left me very confused. But I’ve read it so many times after that, and when I could finally get it, I loved it. Now, it is my favourite book as well. As I told you, my mother kept it on her bedside table. I have it in the dashboard of Baby.»
The angel leaves small soft kisses on the hunter’s neck, slowly coming back to his senses. «You are so unbearably hot around me.» He whispers into Dean’s ear. With his hands sliding on the hunter’s ass , he gently guides him upwards to get some leeway. «And so good, to take me up so well.» He rolls up his hips as he speaks,  and Dean yelps, helpless and high on Cass words just as on pot.
«Have you all around me, so tight and warm…» Dean keeps going, building on the picture. «How’d you like that now?» He teases.
«So, satisfied?» Dean asks. There’s some sneer in the question, but despite that it mostly comes out soft and warm.
The angel speaks faster than he usually does, clearly delighted to talk to Dean about anything that isn’t work.
When Dean passes him the lube, Cass takes his time to generously coat his fingers with it.
In the end, Castiel is seven glasses of whiskey in when they get back home. Or rather when they stumble back inside.
Another pause before the man, Castiel, speaks again, “I can be right over.”
Dean laughs and all the nerves he felt disappear. He never thought something like this was in the cards for him– secretly always wanting for the comfort and ease that comes so naturally with Cas.
. He glances down at his niece who is now enthusiastically guzzling the beverage down as though she wasn’t almost in tears about it minutes prior.
Cas closes his eyes and Dean knows what he’s feeling. When he opens them again, Dean can sense the honesty brewing behind them, “But I
Oh, fantastic, now he’s
He wants this. Forever.
Hanging up the phone, he heads downstairs to the living room where Cas is curled up on the couch watching some documentary on the History channel. His blue eyes find Dean’s at the sound of the steps creaking and he smiles
But that’d ruin everything, especially Dean’s plan to sell the inn for as much as humanly possible and then get the hell outta dodge.
Since his first visit, Dean has come back from 3-3:30 every weekday. He now nurses a drink, rather than taking a quick shot and heading out the door. It’s been almost three weeks of green eyes, soft smiles, and questions Cas can’t bring himself to ask. Cas
Cas’s eyes open and Dean can tell he’s trying to hide a smile. Dean feigns interest in the commercial while the knowledge of Cas studying the side of his face burns blush into his cheeks.
Thanking his friend for the help, Dean pays and heads home for the night. Finally having the name of someone to help has lifted a huge weight off his chest. He sighs as he crawls onto the old mattress in the first floor suite, thankful it’s dark enough that he can’t nitpick all that needs to be done. The sooner he can get the inn fixed up, the sooner he can sell it and go back to Sioux Falls and the life he chose rather than the one his parents forced on him.
will just have to do without me.”
Cas’s dick twitches at the sound of Dean’s voice and if he hadn’t just been put on empty he could’ve come just from that movement. He starts to move down, ready to give Cas the same treatment he just got but Cas grabs his shoulder to stop him. Dean panics for a moment, worried they’ve gone too far and Cas is regretting the moment they connected in the garden but then he speaks.
Before Castiel can realize what’s happening, Claire is pulling him in the direction of said man. As much as he
He hadn’t gotten enough out of Cas to even know if he “plays for that team,” as Sam likes to say. Dean is almost positive John wouldn’t have encouraged the two work together if Cas

“Well, Dean, I like what we’ve got here and I think we can make something out of this.” Castiel slouches into one of the bar stools near the kitchen island as he surveys the room one more time. Dean does his best not to notice the sweat slowly making its way down Castiel’s collar bone and beneath the collar of his t-shirt, and the way he says
Dean starts to feel the tears well in his eyes. The realization that the world started spinning for everyone else sometime in the last two years despite his remaining at a staunch halt isn’t a new one, but it seems to hit him harder every time.

And Castiel has the hardest time saying no to his six-year old niece so obviously— despite it being 90 degrees in the
Dean blushes ferociously, before looking at Cas and seeing the bartender's cheeks are redder than his.
Bravery quells in Dean’s stomach as the bartender and his son look at him expectantly, but he tampers his questions in an effort to answer Ben, “Yes. I’d love it if Cas came,” he smiles at Cas, “that is if it’s ok with Cas...” Ben looks at Cas with a wide smile and Cas looks down at Dean’s son with something so close to admiration that it makes Dean’s heart squeeze.

It’s the most beautiful sound Dean has ever heard.
“Yeah, sure. You can use the shower here if you want but no promise there’s any hot water.” Dean scratches behind his ear nervously. This wasn’t any sort of purposeful invitation, but he can’t help but feel a wad of want fall into his stomach. Cas simply nods his thanks before heading into the main floor bathroom with a change of clothes he brought “just in case”. Dean laughed when Cas told him that he’s
If he breaks it down, it’s because he received a letter in the mail exactly two months after the passing of his father detailing how Lawrence would have no choice but to tear down the old inn unless someone from his family claimed it.
The man is laughing and shaking Claire’s hand through the chain-link fence and Castiel realizes he’s staring again. He approaches the two of them, and apparently they’re fast friends, because Claire introduces him, “Oh,
if we could talk outside of the Roadhouse so I lefthimmynumberinsteadofhisbill.” Cas rushes through the last bit, embarrassed and nervous and not totally sure how Jo is going to take this onslaught of information— he’s not even sure she knew he was gay.

“Dad? What is this place?” Ben is tilting his head in a way that is

He ignores the churning of want that litters his insides at the idea of calling Dean family.

Cas hesitates a bit and Dean knows he’s dying to ask where Dean could possibly have to be everyday at 3:45 but Dean’s nothing if not stubborn so he’ll make the man ask before bearing his soul to a bartender.
Cas’s laugh combines with Ben’s and Deans heart thuds a stupid rhythm.
The days following are filled with more conversation than Dean has entertained in months. They touch on their likes and dislikes— Cas loves bees but is terrified of spiders, Cas loves the color green and shopping for fresh produce at the Saturday farmers market, Cas loves the
gay, but there are moments that give him more hope that he deserves.
His first thoughts are of Lisa.
“Yeah, see, that’s the thing,” Jo walks behind the bar and leans on the ledge right above Cas’s head, “Besides his shot per month, Dean hasn’t so much as driven
Dean’s heart is pounding in a way he knows it hasn’t in years. With no
It’s easy.
Dean can’t find enough energy in himself to do more than nod.
And they do.
His past is filled with
But that was ages ago and, from what Sam’s told him, John died swearing his love for both his boys.
As soon as they’re indoors, clothing flies off. Dean isn’t sure who is removing what but it’s only a matter of seconds before they’re both down to their boxers and he’s pushing Cas backwards towards the bed.
Then that moment passes.
Claire, apparently
And with that thought Dean hears the final gasp and feels the undeniable drip of come down his hands. He eases Cas through the aftershocks, reiterating everything Cas said to Dean during his come down. Dean almost doesn’t realize when he says it, but it comes out all the same. “I love you, Castiel.”
Hope you love the boys in this as much as I do. More destiel is on the horizon for me!
The tears pour heavier as he thinks of Ben. So young, too young— too young to not have a mother, too young to understand where she’s gone, too young to help Dean remember when only two years later he struggles to remember the exact sound of her voice.
Dean smiles as he watches him go, ignoring the butterflies that have taken permanent residence in his stomach anytime he’s within a one mile radius of Cas, and checks his phone to see it’s almost time for pick up.
Dean is surprised when Cas descends immediately once given the all clear. His tongue rakes the length of Dean’s cock before the warmth of his mouth envelopes the whole of it. Cas starts slow, moving up and down in a steady motion and Dean knows he won’t last long.
They work surprisingly well together.
Cas smiles brightly before offering the hand not covered by Dean’s out in a handshake, “Hi Ben! It’s so nice to finally meet you.”
Holding onto that, his mind turns to Cas.
“Mom!”
“I do.” Cas squints and Dean can’t help but blush under the scrutiny. Then Cas’s head tilts again and Dean is a goner.
He swears he sees the cosmos as Cas brings him over the finish line and into the cooldown, the whole time whispering to Dean. “You’re perfect. You’re beautiful. I’ve wanted this for so long. Thank you.”
The man is thorough and he knows his stuff.
Jo looks happy, maybe even at home– Dean? Not so much.
That kid just
Truly, Cas isn’t sure what keeps Dean coming back. He can’t help but
Sam’s not going to leave his law practice and the life he built for Jess and the twins, out in California.
. . .
Dean opens his eyes and the world feels like it’s in hyper-saturation. Every nerve is on end and his soul feels like it’s on fire. He turns to Cas and immediately goes in for a kiss. Cas smiles into the movement and Dean grasps the back of his neck in an attempt to never let go of this moment.
He waits for the fear but it never comes. He doesn’t want to run or leave town and he certainly doesn’t think about just how mortified his homophobic father would be. He’s just is. Happiness and satisfaction coursing through him in a way he didn’t realize was real.
Hence why the hug catches him off guard, as does what she quietly whispers in his ear, “I’m glad you found someone that makes you smile like that again.”
Then he jumps off the bartop in a move that
His new partner is a quiet but sturdy presence throughout the day– rarely chatting about more than the weather or whatever task needs to be done– but on occasion Dean will learn a bit more about him. He’s started to compile a list of Cas’s likes and dislikes– for example, Cas likes that Dean gave him a nickname.
“Cas…” His moan comes out like a plea and a promise all wrapped into one and he feels himself come.
“I should probably get cleaned up a bit…” Cas trails off as he surveys his dusty jeans and sweat drenched t-shirt. Without trying to, Dean gets lost in the unfairly attractive mess of it all for a moment too long. He looks up to speak again and Cas is smirking almost knowingly.
Lisa still looks a little stunned to see Dean– his return had seemingly not reached the far ends of the town gossip chain quite yet– but then she glances back towards Cas… and then back to Dean.
if he ain’t proud of him.
Come to think of it, he’s not even sure
Not that Sam would tell Dean otherwise.
Cas understands more than he’d like to– loss. Not just any loss, loss of someone you love. He can’t truly relate to what that’s like but he can imagine in his own way.
Dean takes Cas’s chin; lifting the man’s face gently until their eyes lock. When Cas’s nervous blues meet hopeful greens, Dean traces his hand to the side of Cas’s face rubbing the apple of his cheekbone affectionately.
Strong arms, broad chest, bow legs, sandy hair, a smile to power the Chrysler Building, freckles for day, and the greenest eyes Castiel has ever seen even from this far away. He’s dressed a little nicer than most of the workers so Castiel reasons that he must be the contractor or project lead but
“Awesome, thanks! My names–”
Dean’s the only one left.
Warily, he agrees to take him to a weed dispensary the following day.
«Because it sounds interesting, and the downsides are negligible.» Castiel answers plainly and Dean can’t come up with anything to counter that.
«I love you.» He repeats, and his arms wrap tight on Castiel’s body, nails digging in on his chest, and his head falls against the angel’s shoulder.
Then it’s time for a quick trip to the loo, where he washes the sleep off his face under the cold water of the faucet.
Then, the hunter finally speaks.
«Well, I haven’t tried it yet.» The angel replies, tongue in cheek, squeezing Dean’s hand in his fingers.
His heart stings in his chest. Not out of pain, or grief, or apprehension.
«Would you like to hear what I have in mind for you?» He whispers. The angel nods, his eyes still closed to the unusual sensations.
Then Dean relaxes again, and Castiel knows he’s smiling now, with that soft yet amused smile of his, too tender to be really called a grin.
They kiss, sloppily, mouths open wide, riding out the last waves of pleasures as they shudder against one another in their dampening underwear.
As a lover though, Castiel has discovered early in their relationship how considerate and delicate he can be instead. And that, the angel loves it every day with no exceptions.
This fic is intended as part of a bigger project that I'll hopefully get to publish soon enough, but it can work as a stand alone without issues.
«Dean.» The angel chides unamused, now a peeved frown on his face.
The air is full of their noises, the smack of skin against skin, lubed wetness, their names called out in rich moans, and it sounds like the most exquisite, filthy, music to their ears.
He hears him fidgeting again with the bottle of lube, and he loudly gasps when he feels the cold thickness of it being meticulously smeared around and inside him. There’s the sound of slick, quick strokes, and then Dean’s dick is pressed against his crack, sliding on it.
«Why?» Dean brings himself to ask at least, trying to be collected and mature about it.
He pulls out ever so slightly, Castiel’s muscles clinging to him, making them both groan, and then he’s sinking forward again.
There is a poignant silence for no more than an instant, but to Castiel it feels like ages. Few creatures are as aware as angels about the subjective nature of time, but the knowledge doesn’t do much to ease him from the anxious knot tied in his stomach.
And so they’re fucking again, and Castiel quivers as Dean drives into him in deliberate, deep thrusts while he works the angel’s cock in his hand, sliding up the shaft and caressing the head.
He takes off the blazer, and with one careless motion, slides the tie’s knot undone. With some effort, he opens the first buttons of his shirt as well. It feels like his grace is reverberating in his vessel. It’s strange, but not unpleasant.
Castiel closes his eyes. Breaths in, out. Once, twice again.
The angel shakes his head, a bit dejected. «No. I think as a soldier of God it’s hard to form any connection to material possessions.» He pauses, and his brow furrows as if something has just come to him.
Because Castiel has undeniably changed. He has picked up on human quirks, his reactions aren’t as outlandish as they used to, and he has learned a fair bit on how social interactions go on Earth.
Also, you know it's a fanfic when people always come at the same time during sex. The whole "yeah, I'll just quickly jerk it off, just give me a moment babe" isn't as pretty.
«Fuck, you. Always you.» Dean breathes out as he watches Cass work on himself, utterly mesmerized.
Then he strips off his own spoiled trunks, cleans himself up quickly and changes his sweaty shirt as well. At last, he slides back under the covers and outstretches his hand on the pillows as an invitation towards the angel, but without any obligation to take it.
That catches Dean completely off guard. «I thought I had thrown it away.» He stutters.
«Cass… just, take me. I need you, need you so bad right now.» He begs in a broken whimper, his mind going crazy with want, everything made so intense by the weed.
He can clearly picture Dean’s eyes opening in surprise, while the hand on his waist stills for a moment.
«Yes… Yes. Please do.» He urges, his arm reaching around to grasp at the hunter’s buttock.
Castiel’s face is flushed with pure, overwhelming joy as he unwraps the gift and holds it close to his heart.
When he felt satisfied with that, he brought his hand to the hunter’s mouth. Dean licked at the palm with unfettered enthusiasm, then his lips closed around each finger, his tongue swirling between them, sucking on them to get every drop of his own semen. During all of this, he was still looking at Castiel with heavy lidded eyes.
They sit at a table in a pub they’ve already visited a handful of times. Dean jokingly calls it ‘the nice hipster drinking hole’ since it’s quite higher end compared to the places they usually stop at when they’re on the road, but that’s a rather low bar.
All of his morning routine, up until he gets his coffee, is done on autopilot. He’s used to getting up early no matter what, but his sleeping pattern is quite a mess and he’s not a morning person by any means.
His fingers slide easily over himself, precum leaking onto them freely, and Castiel knows the hunter’s close to the edge, which in turn sends him off to his way as well.
Dean shrugs. They aren’t really that many. There’s Baby, with the little green army man jammed in the back and the Lego brick stuck in the vents, the movie tickets for Groundhog Day in his wallet, which was his present for Sam’s tenth birthday, and his mother’s copy of On the Road. Maybe dad’s journal could make the list as well, but he’s conflicted about it.
Stay tuned for some proper anal sex in the next days (at last!)
Slowly, Dean’s finger curls, then twists inside him. He is suddenly aware of all the nerve endings there, as they light up one after the other to Dean’s touch. His muscles clench, not out of rejection, but because he’s curious to explore the sensation.
If I recall correctly, Dean's name in the show really comes from Kerouac's novel, and I'm a big ass fan and scholar of anything beatnik, so I just took the chance to write that in. Having his mother's copy of the book in Baby's dashboard is an idea I shamelessly stole from another fanfic I've read some months ago but that I sadly can't find anymore (it was a recreational drug use fic, and there were some references about a pine forest, so if any of you know which one I'm talking about send me a line plz).
He straightens his back, raising up on his knees, and he slides back on Dean, taking him in with a drawn out, obscene groan. «You feel great.» He purrs.
Dean takes a moment to sort out his words and be as accurate as he can.
The clerk has that very look on her face right now.
«Relax, you’ll feel fine by tomorrow.» He soothes as he lounges on the bed. The angel sighs, sliding down on the pillow and wrapping his arms around his lover, snuggled against him.
The hunter shakes his head firmly. «I’m not taking any chances.» His tone is light-hearted, but the angel knows he won’t yield to rush.
Castiel is high on the novelty of it, so different, so fulfilling. He still won’t touch his own dick, now throbbing and leaking precum at each touch of his prostate. He wants to get lost in these new sensations until he can’t take any more of it.
And then it all comes crashing down on him, as he comes alive in a mixture of pain and pleasure and sheer amazement.
It’s lazy and blissful, the wet sounds of Castiel’s sucking wash through Dean in waves until his ass is pliant and relaxed and ready for more.
Dean’s not hard at first, yet the weight of his cock presses deliciously between Cass’s cheeks and he lets out husky, rich moans. The sounds turn the hunter on as well, and the harder he gets, the more vocal Castiel is.
«I want you inside of me. Now.» The words spill out of Castiel’s mouth feverish, and even if they sound commanding, he’s begging for it, holding on to Dean.
Castiel’s reply comes steady and confident. «I know.»
Castiel grumbles. «No, it’s just weird.»
«’Morning Cass.» He greets him, his voice still rough from the sleep. He falls on the chair in front of his cup of coffee, with a smile on his lips as an unspoken sign of gratitude.
They do it once, twice again and Dean starts to feel the high enveloping him from within.
«Fuck me, Cass.» He pleads, and Castiel complies, thrusting upwards in shallow motions to get the hang of it and avoid burning off too soon, to savor it until it gets too much to handle.
It’s a bit coarse and it scrapes against his throat as it goes down to his lungs. It’s harsher than tobacco, but he doesn’t mind it much and it has some damp, hearty undertones that he actually enjoys.
«Well, there’s a lot of stretching involved, especially in the beginning. I can feel my muscles easing as I warm up to it. You are quite thorough with my preparation, and I’m very used to it by now, so it’s not usually painful. But even when we rush it, I don’t mind if it burns a bit. Excitement makes it pleasurable anyway. It helps a lot that you can read me so well you always get the right pace. And when we really get to it, oh, it’s so good. I feel full, and it’s like my hole was meant to be stuffed by you. Then there’s the thrusting, it’s like waves of pleasure. And you know how I lose it when you hit the prostate just right. It’s all very… intense. And amazing.» He says, his voice getting thicker towards the end.
«Christ, Cass, that was really… something.» Dean breaths out, unable to find a fitting adjective for what has just happened, but his tone is clearly complimentary. They have gone way harder at it many other times, but he feels spent in the best possible way. But it was all so sudden, so blindsiding that he still feels a bit confused too.
«Anyway, I’ll give it to you, it does sound interesting. But do you ever think about venturing into some lighter reading as well?»
The post-orgasm bliss fades away soon enough, but the high is still there. Dean whines about wanting to ride it out draped all over Castiel, but he needs some proper clean-up which the angel refuses to grant with a miracle.
Castiel thinks about it for a moment. «It’s not painful, it’s just slick and a bit cold. And very much on the ‘inside’. I like that. A lot.»
Castiel breathes against his skin and weed makes Dean so sensible he isn’t sure if he can bear Castiel’s mouth around him.
The hunter is just a couple feet away behind him, a towel and lube in hand, very much naked and sporting a chub of his own over his soft nest of caramel hair. There’s an ease, a carelessness about his own nudity, that Castiel is slightly envious of. He knows Dean has his own problems with his image, born after years of necessity to look rough and tough at all times. But he’s also confident in his body, and unreserved to show it off to his partners, especially when he knows he’ll get showered in praises like Castiel usually does.
The angel nods. He searches for it in the breast pocket of his coat and once he finds it, he sheepishly slides it towards Dean over the table.
«Lord, you taste good.» Dean mouths, his voice dreamy like he’s just as entranced by the experience himself.
«Remember when I wore that Western outfit during sex?» Castiel’s incipit takes Dean by surprise, but recalling the event, a delighted, naughty smirk spreads on his face as confirmation.
Dean squints in the effort to follow his statements. «Wait, so everything is made out of the Word of God, and They hold power over everything because They’re the only one who understand it?»
«Come on…» Is all Castiel manages to say, urgent, finally so close to it, burning with the anticipation to feel all of his hardness and thickness inside. To feel Dean.
«But don’t you have a deeper understanding of all, or something like that?» Dean questions.
When they step into the shop a strong smell hits their noses, and unexpectedly it is not the acrid, sickeningly sweet one of cannabis. There is incense burning and the scent makes Dean head slightly dizzy. Castiel on the other hand, breaths in the fragrance with a smile.
«Why are you asking right now?» The hunter wonders, interrupting his reverie.
Like desire is a fire running through his veins and Castiel is the only one that’s going to save him from turning into ashes. Like its flame burns for the angel and the angel only, and he’s kindling and extinguishing water all the same.
He loves how sex works for them now, loves being the one holding and pounding and feverishly kissing Dean’s skin, loves looking at his body as the hunter’s eyes get lost in his own, hearing him scream his name as if it were a desperate prayer, loves how Dean grips him tight to get faster, deeper, closer.
«I love you.»
«Thanks, but there is something else that would fit well there right now.» Castiel grins, all sly and mellow at the same time, and Dean feels like melting simply at the thought of it.
«Can I get a word before you start?» Dean asks. The angel is taken aback, but nods anyway.
Castiel explains. His eyes spark like they always do when he talks about the topics which he finds exciting, be it bees, meadow flowers or ancient, forgotten lore from cultures long gone.
«You know, maybe I don’t mind you doing pot every now and then.» Dean confesses. «I like hearing you laugh this much.» He smiles as he drags Castiel’s hand to his mouth and places a mindless kiss into it.
That was the first time the angel had let Dean look at his bare chest during sex, completely unbuttoning his shirt. He did so with one hand, the other firmly grabbing Dean’s hip to ground him in place as he kept thrusting into him. He had a big grin on his face, perfectly aware of the effect it was having on Dean while his shirt draped open on his sides.
When Dean asked him if he could wash his hair over the sink, Castiel was rather confused by the proposition. He accepted nevertheless, thinking nothing of it. But Dean’s fingers gently working a silky, flowery shampoo onto his scalp -and Castiel suspects he had bought it specifically for the task- made him feel so unexpectedly good and relaxed.
«Dean.» He barely whispers, yet the word still comes out loud and clear in the silence of the night. The hunter makes a low affirmative sound from behind him to let him know he’s listening.
Castiel snickers as he turns the grinder in his hands, crushing some weed’s buds in it. «I can picture that crystal clear, yes.»
As they walk towards the Impala, Dean searches Castiel’s hand and he intertwines their fingers together. Castiel allows it. He doesn’t really understand those displays of affection in public, but he considers himself quite fortunate when Dean feels the need for them and reaches out.
‘Dean is eating me’ is all Castiel can think of in his head, over and over again. His cock stands upright against his belly, but he’s enjoying the moment so much he doesn’t even consider reaching for it.
Castiel feels wet, smothered in Dean’s spit as he keeps prodding and darting his tongue over his hole, around it, ever so slightly inside.
He helplessly whines when Dean withdraws.
Dean senses it and places a chaste kiss onto his forehead. He’s still dazed, but his caring side immediately kicks in.
Castiel’s right hand sheepishly reaches for the nape of his neck, as he always does like clockwork when he’s self-conscious or embarrassed by anything sexual. One would think he has grown past his awkwardness about those topics, yet this feels like a whole new domain for him.
Despite having just come, when Castiel withdrew his hand, Dean begged him in breathless whispers to not pull out yet, to keep fucking him. Castiel chuckled and then, without hesitation, he obliged.
I sent part of the pub scene to a friend of mine who studies physics just to peeve him. He wanted to bash my head in with a baseball bat. Opsie. This is what happens when I read too many books on scientific divulgation, coupled with "Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma" by Ludwig Ott (that shit's interesting af).
«Yeah, yeah. You don’t understand that reference.» Dean fills up the sentence for him. «I’ll tell you what, doesn’t matter if tomorrow somebody tries to jumpstart the apocalypse again, we will be watching Star Wars.»
«Dean...» Castiel softly starts.
«So it’s like Rosemary’s Baby, which is still a great movie despite the director being worse than a bag of dicks?» Dean knows Castiel probably has no clue what he’s talking about. He does so mostly because he is a bit lost discussing such abstract concepts, and the analogy feels grounding to him.
«I’ve been thinking about it for a while now, and the thought really got me going last night, as you must have noticed. Dean, I’m asking you, would you mind if we tried switching roles during sex?» The question rushes out of his mouth as if he were ripping off a band-aid.
«Not quite, but it is what they call a space western.» The hunter muses.
The angel sneers. «Like you wouldn’t know.» He jokes sarcastically.
Castiel helplessly fell in love with the hunter long ago, despite him being a hot-headed, insufferably stubborn and crass idiot most of the time. Sometimes he even thinks he loves those very flaws. That is until Dean doesn’t get on a real bad mood and does something stupidly reckless, but on a good day, they make him endearing, and funny, and so much undeniably Dean.
Castiel loudly groans, the thought of Dean’s warm cum wetting their underwear and his back nearly sends him over the edge right there and then.
Castiel guides Dean downwards on himself, one hand on his own dick and one on the hunter’s waist. He presses in as Dean keeps sinking, his cock’s head prodding at Dean’s rim.
«How does it feel on that side?» Dean asks casually, getting closer to him. He places the lube and the towel on the bed beside him. Standing right behind Castiel, his fingers skim along the angel’s spine, sending a shiver running through it.
Despite the composure in his voice, Dean’s face is flushed, hot, and he looks like he could just break in a fit if the cap on the bottle of lube doesn’t collaborate fast enough. He finally gets it to open and squeezes its content on his fingers.
Every now and then, Dean dips his fingers lower towards his butt, taking his time to reach it. When he gets there, he kneads at it with leisure, enjoying its roundness.
And the ocean swallows him whole and sweeps him to safe shores.
There’s a long moment of absolute stillness, like they haven’t caught up with reality yet.
Also, communication is key and those two really do it right for once. Dean is an idiot and not quite good with words, but it's also pretty canon he's a very attentive and affectionate lover so I hope he doesn't feel too OOC.
Dean hums as he kisses his way along the line of Cass’s jaw. «You’re taking me so well.» He hazily compliments, genuinely impressed and thankful for it.
«Yes, always. One way or another.» He mouths against his lover’s neck as he slides one hand between them, casually sneaking downwards until it reaches Dean’s hardening cock.
By the end of that night, Dean looked absolutely wrecked.
The angel’s fingers tap nervously on the now empty glass of whiskey, while his eyes are firmly planted in his lap. He looks like a kid who’s been caught stealing candy. «Yes, well… I fished it back from that trash can. I… I’m sorry if I held to it, I’m not sure why I did it. Maybe I thought I’d give it back to you one day, but it has sat in my coat ever since.»
Castiel’s ass isn’t as plump as Dean’s bubble-butt, but it is firm and cushy at the same time, and the way it juts out from his bony hips is perfect in his own way.
«I’ll come on your ass if you keep it up like this, Cass.» He warns him, as he can’t help bucking against the angel, looking for some friction.
Castiel simply hums, non-committedly.
«Exactly.» Castiel nods, a rousing shadow flashing on his face.
Rain starts falling outside, and its sound gently tinkles in Dean’s ear, lulling. He feels at peace, and content, and still high as a kite.
They stare into each other, flushed, panting, lust heating their faces and darkening their eyes.
«Great.» Dean says, taking his hand off the angel to walk up to him and pull him in his arms. Castiel meets him halfway there. They kiss, taking their time to savour it, the taste of Dean’s coffee now mixing in both their mouths. The hunter’s hands trail along Castiel’s back to get to his buttocks, which he squeezes playfully.
First ever published fic, English is not my first language, not beta-read.
It’s weird and unusual yet vaguely hot. Dean groans, and the way his tongue vibrates, stuck in between the angel’s lips, arouses him even more.
They don’t even get to slip them off their calves that their erections touch, and the contact strikes them dead on the spot.
The angel picks up his pace. «So indecently perfect.» He chuckles in praise, and Dean feels like he can’t wait one second longer.
Dean’s hand, the one who’s not holding him up, grazes on the angel’s skin so delicately, his fingers barely touching him. He caresses the curve of his waist, the bumps of his spine, then reaches around to brush his belly, leaving goosebumps on Castiel’s skin after his passage, awakening the angel to the responses of his body.
Dean gently wraps his left arm around his chest, feeling it raise and fall with each of his breaths. Their rhythm is steady, tranquil.
Still, curiosity has been growing in his mind for a while now, and this train of thoughts has made him a bit roused already.
Dean gets closer to him, now leaning against Castiel’s back.
Castiel lets go, and Dean’s tongue lags behind, sticking out of his mouth stupidly. He’s flushed and his eyes flutter, smitten, as he can’t take them off from Castiel.
The one who gripped him tight and raised him from perdition.
They sit silently for a while.
He starts by placing his hand on it, taking it up in his fist with care. Dean shudders as Cass gives it a few tentative strokes while his tongue laps at his balls. He looks straight up into Dean’s eyes, brash and flushed. Then his mouth finally closes around it, and he hums against the weight of it on his tongue.
the Roadhouse in over a year.”
Then he stares some more but maybe Dean doesn’t mind because he’s staring right back and it’s giving Castiel all the time in the world to study every fleck of gold etched into the summer green of this man’s eyes. In no time at all he moves onto the constellation of freckles that are patterning his cheeks which, if Castiel isn’t mistaken, are starting to red in a blush that may be the most adorable thing he’s ever seen– Claire aside.
Lost in his thoughts the kissing slows. Cas rests his forehead on Dean’s and they each open their eyes. Dean pauses to lose himself in the blown out blue of Cas’s eyes and only catches the end of Cas’s question, “...you?”

Dean just shakes his head.
“I don’t intend on charging you a dime, Dean.” Castiel’s matter of fact smile returns and Dean can’t ignore the way his gut flutters.
It’s driving Cas wild.
lunchtime and agrees to head into town for a sandwich.
idea what he’s saying, “Wait, what?”
He’s just about to get up and leave when she bursts through the double swinging doors that lead to the kitchen and spots him shifting in his seat, “Shit! Dean! Is it 3 already?” She pauses at a table to drop off some drinks before turning back towards him. “I’m fucking slammed right now but Cas can help you once he’s done grabbing some ice.”
Dean, on the other hand, was always rough around the edges, emotional, and
Cas trails kisses down Dean’s chest before tracing a finger underneath the band of his boxers. He’s careful to help Dean remove them completely and his eyes light up when Dean’s hard-on springs from beneath the fabric.
“Did I forget to do that?”
Completely clueless to the meaning of it all, Ben beams, “Cool! I’m gonna go play with Jo!”
The look in Cas’s eyes is one he hopes never to forget.
Dean busies himself with some unimportant organization in the garage in order to calm down before walking into the house to grab some water for the two of them. He closes the fridge and looks out the sliding glass door, dropping the water bottle at what he sees.
“Ah, yeah…I mean… Ellen switched my schedule two weeks ago because Garth needed to have nights but—“ Cas trails off, ducking his head and grabbing a bar rag to fidget with the tag.
He puts down the paintbrush and walks over to the fireplace where Cas is supposed to be sanding down the mantle, “Yeah, Cas, what is it?” There’s that smile– sometimes Dean wonders if he uses his nickname for Cas just to get a glimpse of it.
Dean can't even formulate a correction before Lisa’s telling Ben to thank Dean for his help and the pair is heading down the other end of the aisle. He turns towards Cas who is staring intensely at a speck on the floor by his feet, but seems to be smiling all the same.
’ look before turning towards Ben and squatting down to level with his son. He gulps, “Alright, kid, there’s someone I want you to meet.” Ben nods enthusiastically and Dean straightens, grabbing his little hand and walking him towards the bartender. Dean glances towards Cas and his heart flutters at the realization that the soft smile has been replaced with complete and utter affection— it’s entirely directed at Ben.
Cas’s confession the night they kissed rings in Dean’s head every time things get a little more hot and heavy. He’s a bit more… experienced… and wants Cas to be ready.
“Ben. His name is Ben.” When Cas looks towards him softly, Dean can’t stop his chest from swelling with pride. “He’s uh— he’s 4 and I have to get him from daycare.” A genuine smile arcs across the bartender’s face and Dean can’t possibly fathom what he did to deserve discovering the eighth wonder of the world.
He searches blindly for Cas’s lips in the tangle of their bodies and when they connect again Dean is positive it creates a bolt of lightning down his spine.
Dean’s not sure why he’s here.
It’s domestic, it’s nice, and Dean is pretty sure he’s never been more in love.
He can’t expect everything to stay the same while he spent the last 15 years trying to change in every way imaginable.
Castiel reluctantly lets go of the man’s hand when Claire snaps them out of their trance, “We need you to fix whatever we’ve got broken.”
much of anything. But with Cas it does. He nods and begins adjusting their positions so they are laying side by side and facing one another. Cas shimmies out of his boxers before grabbing Dean’s hand and bringing it to his cock.
This morbid tradition seems to suck a lot less when he doesn't have to do it alone.
“This is. How can I help you?” The man is all business, clearly not as affected by Dean’s use of his name as Dean was.
Cas smiles what he hopes is a normal smile because he feels like he’s lost all control of himself being in this man– Dean’s presence. Somehow his brain tells him to reach out his hand and before he knows it, their fingers are intertwined and he’s speaking, “Hello, Dean. I’m Castiel.”
One whole year of this and Jo’s never once taken the shot with him or offered to pay.
And if Cas thought the night couldn’t have possibly gotten better, Dean drops off Claire first and walks him to the door and kisses him goodbye with the promise of another dinner— just them two.
Oh yeah, Claire.
At least Dean tells himself it’s accidental.
Her words echo through the caverns of his memories and he feels a tear break the floodgates.
How could someone so beautiful be in so much pain?
But still he hopes.
Castiel is already planning the next six days in bed from a god awful migraine as the loud whir of what might be a front loader clashes with the sound of a jack hammer.
The sight practically shatters his heartstrings and he silently curses himself for waiting so long to bring Ben here— then he remembers why they’re here in the first place.
“Hello.” The man– Castiel– greets Dean so matter of factly as he glances around Dean quizzically, presumably taking in the whole of the inn. Dean is a little taken aback by this whole interaction and the way it’s entirely different than any they’ve shared previously. Castiel’s eyes meet Dean’s and Dean can’t help but notice a hint of playfulness before Castiel speaks again, “So you
move to Lawrence, just like any town, and resigns it to someone new since he left.
“Oh yeah, uh, I got your name from Jo at the Roadhouse? My name is Dean Winchester and I’m fixing up the old Winchester Inn and I’m realizing the job may be too massive to handle on my own.” Dean winces at his blatant request for help, never one to ask outright for assistance, but as he looks at the pile of kitchen cabinets which need to be sanded, painted, and rehung, he
did he think he was cut out for restoring an inn? Not just any inn–
Dean uses what’s left of bravery from before to speak first, “You don't usually get off at two… We go to the zoo a lot, you don’t have to take off just because Ben asked.”
Tucking the napkin and the tip into his pocket, a silent hope sits deep in his chest that the man will return tomorrow. Despite physically returning to work, Cas finds himself mentally wandering fields of green that just so happen to match the color of the stranger’s eyes.
They take the short drive into town before stopping at the hardware store. Dean needs to pick up some new screws so he can finish the cabinets and Cas needs some more sand paper so they decide to split up and grab what they need. Cas cuts right, beelining for the aisle like he lives here– now that Dean thinks about it, Cas probably
Flustered by the comment and whether he should tell her objectifying men is
Dean stops him, pulling his hand back up to his mouth and licking his palm, all while keeping close eye contact with Cas– it makes them both shudder.
At this point, Dean’s left thumb had been hit by the hammer more than any of the nails and he was regretting every single choice he ever made that led him to this exact moment.

Dean laughs, “Well, your Dad should’ve taught you screw shopping at the

Dean thought that’d be the last he’d see of the guy until he marched away and slammed the door just across the small garden. That house
Like everyone else is moving on.
“Of course, Dean! Chuck retired, but Castiel took over, after Gabriel ran off to Thailand.” Dean raises his eyebrow and Jo laughs, “
It’s Dean’s turn to take a step.

As Castiel stands, he adjusts the toolbelt around his waist and Dean forces himself to look away, not willing to tempt himself with the flash of skin exposed during the adjustment. The contractor must notice because he smirks slightly before nodding his head in goodbye. If he didn’t know better, Dean would
Cas meets him halfway.
And so is the kiss— beautifully and wonderfully reciprocated.
With his mind suddenly far away, Cas goes to wipe down the bar. He shakes his head when he spots the overly generous tip that the man left behind– enough to more than pay for the set of shots they shared, but then he notices something scrawled out on the napkin beside the cash.
Dean watches him go and can
older than the evening clientele.”
Dean doesn’t like the thought of teamwork– especially not with the grumpy prick who lives next door. His neighbor stopped by the day Dean arrived because apparently it was John’s dying wish that their neighbor offer his services when his estranged son eventually showed up to fix the inn. (Leave it to his father to leave Dean feeling inadequate from the great beyond.)
Dean isn’t sure why Cas is trailing off and blushing but soon it’s his turn when Ben practically yells, “Oh, we go to the zoo at two! Dad said we go at two! Right, Dad?! Casteel, can you come to the zoo to see the honeybees? Dad, Casteel can come right?!”
Sam was always the golden child— pretty blonde cheerleaders and a full-ride to Stanford are not even an exaggeration when it comes to his younger brother.
Cas smiles softly before leaning in for another kiss. “Later, Dean.”
But Claire loves trucks.

The blue disappears behind Cas’s eyelids as he rolls his eyes at Dean’s lack of attention, “I was
“Of course. And now Jess, the kids, and I have somewhere to stay when we visit.” Dean smiles widely at the thought of the inn full of excitement and family and kids around the holidays or during the summer. He pictures it so clearly... and in every moment Cas is there, too.
Dean rolls his eyes and Castiel laughs sending a shockwave through Dean he hasn’t felt in ages. He promptly ignores it before motioning towards the foyer and inviting his new contractor inside. They don’t exchange any pleasantries, but rather head right to work. Castiel asks questions about everything from the crown molding and stair railing to Dean’s plan for the half shattered French doors.
As he glances down towards Cas, he is struck with how stunning he looks in this position. Every time he’s gotten head it’s been dirty and quick and secretive…but with Cas, he wants to take his time but knows the beauty and anticipation of it all won’t let him.
Once he finds his rhythm, Cas speeds up and at the same time takes Dean’s balls in hand and begins massaging. Dean reaches for the top of Cas’s head, combing his hand through the dark locks and tugging gently. Cas gags a bit before coming up for air– Dean was quick to forget Cas’s inexperience. Cas rests his head against Dean’s thigh wordlessly and Dean wishes he could take a picture. Instead, he reaches forward, massaging the length of Cas’s jaw gently to help ease the soft pain he’s sure Cas is feeling. After a minute or so, Cas kisses the palm of Dean’s hand and looks up at him readily.
He decides to start with disassembling the kitchen cabinets and it doesn’t take long for him to find a rhythm in his work— four screws and a trip to the pile, four screws, trip to the pile. Lost in the easy monotony, Dean forgets his decision to call for help until late into the morning. Hoping to catch the contractor before lunch, he brushes the dust from his hands and digs in his pocket for the napkin Jo had written on last night.
It isn’t until the fifteenth time he’s played it over in his head that he

to hear it. “But what, Cas?”
Maybe it was the comfort of the Roadhouse or the knowledge that this process will move twice as fast with a little help, but Dean sleeps better that night than he has in years. When he wakes with the sun, he feels energized and ready to continue his work on his family’s property.
For a brief moment he remembers when the smell of the Roadhouse was comforting.
to be here… with you.”
Cas’s face levels out, he sets down the glass he’s drying, and his head tilts. Dean is pretty sure it’s the most adorable thing he’s ever seen. He’d be lying to himself if he said Cas’s head tilts aren’t one of the many reasons he can’t seem to stay away from the Roadhouse.
Now that he’s drawn to them, Castiel knows he’ll be picturing those lips every time he closes his eyes for the foreseeable future.
come here a lot– and Dean wanders to the left looking for the screw aisle.

“Phewwww, I don’t know what he’s fixing but mines broken.” Cas chokes on his coffee before following her gaze to the man in question.

Jo’s head snaps up and when their eyes meet she must be able to tell Cas isn’t lying, “Shit, Novak, whaddya do now?”
Castiel walks a bit closer to him than is necessary. He shakes it off before heading to the bathroom to shower off the grime of the day before checking in with Sam, Jess, and the kids.
man that is showering in the next room. It works for a while but eventually the knowledge feels stifling and Dean decides to clean up quickly and wait for Cas on the porch.
– and then looks towards Claire fondly, “Is that what your dad said?” Castiel doesn’t have time to focus on the fact Dean thinks Claire is his because if he thought his mind was reeling from Dean’s check of his marital status then it’s absolutely worthless when the man looks back towards him and winks.
“What’d you do to Dean?” She asks it warily, catching Cas off guard. He bends down to hopefully remain out of Jo’s sight and resorts to putting bottles of beer into the lower fridge. Jo doesn’t budge so Cas resolves to answering her question frankly.
“Thanks, Sammy.” His voice cracks at the nickname. He misses his brother, but

He slams the door of Baby and finds himself hyperventilating, his mind running a mile per minute and his chest heaving.

gay, he actually feels more at home on the ace spectrum. He’ll be honest and say he stayed up long past Cas that night researching demisexuality.
“Are you…?” Dean knows what Cas is asking before he gets the words out.
Dean’s face screws into something too cute to be legal and he shoots a glance at Castiel, clearly looking for an explanation. Somehow Castiel finds words, “She kept asking what they were called and I’m clueless.”
“Claire— where did— nevermind—“ Cas
Dean thrusts hard. One– two– three times before he feels himself about to explode. “Cas, I’m close… I–” He feels his partner shift and suddenly Cas’s calloused hand is wrapped along the full length of Dean and he knows it’ll be any second now.
Cas is fucked.
He can’t get the green eyes, soft lips, and bow legs out of his head– Dean becoming a regular in his dreams just as much as he is at the Roadhouse. Yesterday only made matters worse when Cas pretended not to recognize Dean for a moment and then Dean’s eyes filled with mirth as he threw his head back in laughter at Cas’s lame joke– Cas is pretty sure he could die happy having only heard the sound once.
, too.)
Ben (
isn’t how he expected to tell Cas about Ben. He braces for impact– either the cold shoulder or some speech about his bravery for raising a kid all on his own. He’s dealt with both in the years since Lisa passed, and frankly he’s sick of it. Dean raises Ben as good as he can’t but he’s no saint. As for the cold shoulder, good riddance. Ever since he laid eyes on his boy he’s known he’d be a package deal for life.
Patience.
put the man out of his misery, “I’d love to.”
They check out and head back to the Impala in silence. It isn’t until they get home after swinging through the drive thru that Dean even realizes he forgot to grab the screws.
“Oh,” Castiel smiles softly, “What’s his name?” Dean blinks— not used to such ease with this news.
more fun after 5.”
Dean gulps, sex never being something intimate for him. A simple scratch of an itch, not something that
“Hello?” A gruff voice breaks him out of his daze and he’s startled back to the present day.
where Claire heard that, his sister never being subtle with her sexual innuendos despite the impressionable nature of her kid. The most impressive part is Claire is… not wrong.
Ben and him reach the bar and Dean grabs beneath his armpits to hoist his son onto the bartop. Cas glances— nervous now— between the two of them.
Cas waits for her to elaborate, but after a beat, realizes it’s probably not Jo’s story to tell. The carving Dean traced over that first day and the lack of any mention of Ben’s mother are Cas’s only hints to the sadness he’s always sensed behind the man’s eyes.
Cas nodded and moved on with the task, but Dean can’t help but notice the small smirk everytime he has to call Cas by name. Cas also smiles whenever a screw goes in without a fight and when the first raindrop of an impending storm hits his forehead.
Over the past 11 days since Cas left Dean his number, Dean has called Sam no less than fifty times. They yelled and sat in silence and Sam lectured while Dean sat stoic and in one of the last calls Dean broke down crying in guilt that Sam assured him was misplaced. He and Sam also talked at length about Ben and how someone else will fit into the equation and whether Dean
So, taking things extremely literally, he’s here because a bunch of lawyers told him he needed to be.

“I want to kiss you when I come.”
But Ben’s perceptiveness ultimately calms Dean’s nerves a little bit and he chuckles. “Because today I’m going to introduce you to someone new and I really hope you like him.”
terms, but he probably could’ve been nicer when he told her he was leaving.
So why is he so damn nervous?
Cas’s heart practically stops when he hears the soft whisper from the man at the end of the bar. His first instinct is to walk back over there, slip into the role of bartender/therapist, and do what he can to help the guy.
Dean tries to ignore the scariest part of all of this— that when it comes down to it, the emotion he’s wrestling with most is
Just as he’s about to make his way towards Cas, confess everything, and beg him for a chance at whatever this is going to be, Ben comes barreling back and slams hard into his legs causing him to practically topple over with the force of it.
There was a long moment of silence before Sam tilted his head to look his brother in the eyes. "You know that he loves you, right?", he asked cautiously and frowned with an honest smile on his lips.
Then he saw him, crouching on the floor. "Who are you?", the man asked agitated in a gruffy voice with his hands balled into fists before his face. "It's okay", Dean said reassuringly, as he approached him, "Your husband called us and we're here to help you". Sam walked over to them and noticed the blood on Daniel's hands. "You're bleeding", he observed with concern. "Nah, it's not my blood", Daniel reassured them, "That nasty son of a bitch tried to attack me, so I struck him down"
"Dean..fucking..Winchester", he screamed hoarsely, his cock jerking frantically as he filled Dean with his seed. "Elasa..biab..", he mumbled incoherently, his voice quivering in a deep baritone timbre, as he rode out his orgasm, "..en..olapireta..a..a..oresa".
But somehow, the combination of molecules in this specific double-pepperoni meat blaster pizza made for a harmonious combination that was just to the angel's taste. He was lucky enough that Dean was willing to share his pizza with him and he knew that it meant a lot for a foodlover like Dean.
"Dean, we need to talk about this..", Castiel started again.
Cas looked at him apologetically and Dean felt his stomach twist as he saw the guilt in the angel's eyes. Dean interrupted him before he got a chance to say anything. "Cas", he said in a soft and shaky voice, "Please..don't look at me like that". "Like what?", Cas asked, his head tilted to one side. Dean sighed heavily. "Like..like you're trying to apologize or somethin'. I mean..yeah, I feel like shit right now but..it's not your fault. I mean, thanks to you..Michael is
One night, everything was so silent that he could even make out a few words, that were sounding from Castiel's room.
Dean realized that it wasn't just about him anymore, it was about
But Sam couldn't be too mad at them, because even he had to admit that it could be kind of cute at times.
Dean prepared everything that he needed for this peculiar sort of hunt and packed a little bit of extra, just in case. You could never be too prepared when you wanted to kill the devil after all.
. Even if his people skills were still a bit rusty, he knew that much.
"Are you sure, Dean?", Cas asked in his angelic voice. Dean hadn't done this before and he hadn't even realized just how much he needed it until now. He wanted to feel Cas everywhere, filling him up, as close as humanly possible. "Yes", Dean rasped breathily, trying to put even more innuendo into his words this time, "Take me, Castiel". And for once, the angel picked up on the reference to the words that Dean had already said earlier. He smiled warmly and bit his lips, "Just tell me if I hurt you, okay?". Dean stretched out his hand to caress Castiel's chest as he whispered "I trust you, sweetheart", before he leaned up to kiss him again.
Even though Sam had criticized his cooking skills once again, Castiel was proud to hear that Dean liked the breakfast that he had prepared for them. He watched as the hunter stuffed his mouth with eggs and bacon and even ate a bit himself, because he felt like it helped him to regain his powers after everything that had happened.
After a little bit of research, Dean found some omens not too far away from Lebanon, that sounded way too biblical to be a coincidence. It had to be Lucifer. And apparently, he was already coming for them. He was coming for
, he whispered to himself before he opened his eyes again and unlocked the door determinedly.
"You have", Cas admitted unwillingly, rolling his eyes in defeat, "But still..it was stupid of you to risk your life for me. Michael could have ripped you to shreds and..I.. I just can't believe that you really did this". Dean took the angel's hand in his and squeezed it weakly, before he explained, "After all the things that you have done for me, it was about bloody time". Cas smiled, despite the deep worry lines on his forehead, as he felt the hunter's hand on his. "Thank you", Cas said softly, "But please warn me the next time you plan to do
But before Dean even had the chance to find out, Cas abruptly withdrew his hands, leaving two cold spots on Dean's temples. Dean sighed at the loss of contact, but his skin was still prickling where Castiel's warm hands had just been touching him. He tried to imagine what the angel's hands would feel like on other parts of his body, but when he saw that Castiel's gaze was fixed on him, he just cleared his throat and bit his lips nervously, trying to shake these thoughts from his head.
Dean had declared it his mission to show the angel all the classic movies, so he would understand the references that he liked to make on certain occasions. He had told himself that he was just watching the movie for the sake of Cas' popcultural education, but deep inside he knew that it wasn't just about that. He leaned back in his chair as the names of the cast faded in.
"I know who you are", the voice finally answered in a strange accent. The words were drawn-out as if Dean was facing a weird creature from one of these bad 90's horror movies. "Then I guess you also know what I want", Dean scoffed, suddenly feeling a bit cocky. "You want the angel", the voice exclaimed, "Castiel. He is my prisoner. I will drag him down here to be trapped with me for all eternity when he finally allows himself to be happy. He has agreed to these terms". Dean couldn't help but shudder at the idea of Castiel being trapped in this dark place for ever, but at the same time he was boiling with anger at the cruelty of this..thing. "Yeah, I know the deal and I'm here to break it. So tell me, what do you want?", Dean asked, demanding.
"Hey sweetheart", Dean whispered against Cas' lips affectionately, as he looked deep into his eyes. "Good morning, my love", Cas countered softly, before he captured Dean's lips with his own again.
"Mornin' ", Dean answered with a tremble in his voice before he unconsciously licked his lips, watching the angel in this unusual attire. Cas didn't even look all that different, but this morning, his well-shaped body wasn't hidden by his loose-fitting trenchcoat and the way his hair was sticking out in random directions made Dean's breaths come out a bit heavier than usual. The thought of running his hands through the angel's perpetually messy and dark hair crossed his mind, but he reluctantly pushed it aside.
Sam was standing a bit to the side, silently chuckling to himself, as he watched his brother intently, trying to guess his thoughts. When the two men parted their kiss, Daniel blushed and looked at the brothers. "Thanks for helping me out back there", he said, "I owe you guys one". Sam and Dean nodded in their direction and waved them goodbye. "Take care guys", Sam said, before they turned around to leave.
