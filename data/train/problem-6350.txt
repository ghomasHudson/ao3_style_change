"Hey,"
"I think so, too," Tony says, because he and Thor just made up and he's not going to waste that. "Thank you for participating in the album."
"No need, Captain Rogers already knows it."
Tony gets home after eight. It smells like roasted potatoes and chicken, he hasn't eaten in hours and his stomach rumbles in response to the smell.
"Well, I haven't experimented said kiss so I can't say more about it," Steve explains.
"Always," Bucky flashes a smile that's all teeth towards Tony before saying, "I'm even wearing your favourite jacket."
"You think we've been circling towards this since the begging or just in the past year?" Steve asks, and Tony considers for a second or less, to play safe, to ask Steve what he's talking about, but dismisses that notion.
"Try not to end up inside with her again."
"I'm just stating a fact," Steve doesn't give the cup back immediately, he takes another sip and Tony can see him putting it down and wetting his lips. It makes him do the same. Steve catches him doing that and looking. He smiles as he gives back the cup, "you okay?"
"Of course I have to ask, Mister Parker," Tony says. He doesn't smile, he's not joking, "you're an important rising star, we'd be honoured to have you."
"Oh, of course, carol singers in Christmas, what am I even thinking about?" Tony takes his phone out, texts Steve his earlier thought ("Clint is not absolutely marvellous") and closes it. Lucky barks, as if he knew what Tony wrote.
"Thanks for doing this with me," he texts Steve.
"I think it's our best Christmas album so far," Steve tells him.
"I'd like to say yes, but we need to check things."
"Hey Barnes, missed me?" Tony says, entering Steve's office without even knocking.
"You can't quit!"
"I have to make the calls," Steve replies, but before Tony can be disappointed he adds, "so if you two start with New Years' party plans, I can join you later and hear about Christmas. I'll even pick up some cake from that place Jarvis always talks wonders about."
"I didn't know you were that much of a man of science."
"I don't like to be defined by a genre," Clint looks up, his eyes are shining like a mischievous toddler and the bandage on his nose helps to make him look way younger than he actually is.
Tony agrees and they exchange the cup back and forth without talking.
"Those may have been his words," Natasha smiles again at him, "I told him that Steve was going to talk to him when he got back here, that he didn't need to worry."
Tony goes to bed after wishing Natasha and Jarvis goodnight while they drink tea, he's not tired, but he needs to review the artists he hasn't talked to yet, and he needs to be awake for that. On the way to his room he texts Steve: "Natasha's home". The reply is almost immediate: "Thanks for letting me know, see you tomorrow." There's a happy emoji after that and Tony can't help smiling at it. He almost runs into the wall next to his bedroom door while doing that, but luckily no one's around to see it.
"All is settled with Strange," he replies to Steve and turns to Bucky, "how's the arm?"
"Not really, no," she looks up from her console. "I liked some things, but I like this better."
"Try to take her to the office," Tony asks, "and thanks."
The food makes Tony's eyes water alongside his mouth. He grabs the plates to set the table.
"That's right, Clint is absolutely marvellous," Tony says.
"I'll try to remember."
Tony rolls his eyes, "did he say there's no Christmas album without The Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"Just alright?" Tony asks because he can, because he knows it'll make Steve smile and Steve's smile is that thing that should be contemplated as closely as possible and Tony is, indeed, as close as possible. Steve does smile, barely a second before talking.
"Good, keeping them busy is the best way with them."
Steve laughs, "we do like that part. And I guess the other part is the job."
Tony wouldn't be caught dead admitting that he trusts Clint's judgment, so he grabs his own phone, looks up this girl's account and sends it to Steve.
Tony's phone has been vibrating the whole morning. He knows it's a good thing, that it means the album got even more attention than the one they were hoping for, but he hates it because: a. It proves that Steve was right about it being their best Christmas album and Tony may love the man but he's impossible when he's right, and b. It's very annoying.
"What did Quill had to complain about to you?"
His butler, for lack of a better word, has his back to him and is taking the food out of the oven. Jarvis doesn't turn, but returns the greeting, and Tony thinks again that he's glad that Jarvis never wanted to leave, that his stubbornness outmatched his own and that he stayed. Coming home to Jarvis is coming home to family.
way, but in a simpler,
He opens his eyes to see Steve smile and say "more than."
"Carol is in jail."
"You can't throw it away, you need it," Steve says, making Tony look up from his phone.
"Of course you can argue, you're just choosing not to," Steve says, and the bastard licks his lips after talking, but his tongue doesn't touch Tony's mouth, it's like Steve calculated it exactly.
"I decided a long time ago that I was going to share my life with you, as coworkers, as friends, I didn't care as what as long as I had you with me."
Natasha got the Christian choir for Clint. Steve spoke with The Guardians of the Galaxy about their two songs for the album and Quill emailed Tony his ideas for the cover (for a change, they aren't all terribly tacky). The list in Tony's desk has more checks than not, and December is still a week away. He smiles. There's a knock on his door.
Steve opens his mouth and before he can agree with Thor, Tony stops him.
"I know that, Tony," Steve replies, "unlike you, I check our calendar. "
"Same," Steve sits down on the couch behind Tony, his leg touches Tony's side. The reindeer socks call his attention again. Natasha starts typing on her computer, it becomes background noise, just like the snow outside.
"Please don't tell me I shouldn't have gone to the rally."
Steve takes Tony's phone from him, opens the first drawer of the desk and throws it in there. He puts his own phone in, too. He closes the drawer, rests his body against Tony's desk, almost sitting on it, and looks at Tony, who smiles at him, content. Steve smiles for a moment too, and then his mouth becomes a straight line. Tony lifts an eyebrow in a silent question.
The vibration of his phone brings Tony out of his mental process and he swipes to pick up the call.
"What brought this up?"
"You and...?"
"We've been doing it for years," he agrees, "when we passed the first year I assumed you two were gonna walk out, that the artists we had were going to look for bigger labels, better contracts."
"I'm not late, I'm waiting for Strange at the airport," he says as a hello.
"What? No, that makes no sense."
"There are ways to say things Tony, and telling someone they're obligated to record a Christmas song for a collaborative album is probably not very nice nor festive."
. Tony doesn't fully get it, but he can't actually blame them, the asshole is talented and sometimes, when it's very late and dark, Tony can admit he's not that much of an asshole. Some of these people must know that or else they're masochists. Or they don't care. When Strange is on the stage, behind the piano, Tony doesn't care either. And it's not only because Strange brings in a lot of money (which he does) but the guy is pretty good at his music.
"Everyone else already reported themselves, right?" Natasha asks and Tony turns back to her. She's drinking from her mug which makes Tony grab his and take a gulp of the coffee Jarvis brought him.
"Both male and female reindeer have prongs, but males' fall in the winter and they grow back later. Considering Santa's trip happens during winter and they have prongs, then they're all females."
Steve sighs and grabs the mug from Tony's hands, takes a sip and leaves it on the desk at equal reach for both of them.
"Hey boss," Clint walks in without knocking and fully knowing that Tony can't morally complain about that because it's something he does all the time.
"My deepest apologies," Steve's hand rests at Tony's side, emanating an impossible heat, and Tony's not sure when that happened and how he missed it, and in the future, he'll tell everyone who wants to hear that Steve was so desperate that he pushed Tony with that hand. But, as Steve would point out every time, there'd be no way to prove it.
"Nat told me you were in a mood the other day," Steve says, "the, ah, December mood you called it before I think?"
"Yes, we are," Steve nods. "Do you remember what Rolling Stone wrote about us when the label started?"
"Females doing all the work, what a strange notion," Natasha says from her spot, she doesn't sound mad (Tony has heard her mad) and the left side of her mouth is curved in a smile.
"I'm actually on my way to talk to Carol."
"No, I want him to be reasonable."
Steve comes closer, resting his elbows on his knees and asks, "how's that?"
Bucky's smile loses the teasing and it becomes soft and reaches his eyes, "it's amazing, I played the drums the whole day yesterday and it didn't even cramp once."
"You learned pretty fast."
"I know Nat told you we're not gonna walk away," Steve smiles, makes sure to look at Tony in the eyes as he speaks, "like we didn't back then, we're not doing it now and we're not gonna do it in the future."
"I enjoy working with you," Steve says, "you gave me an opportunity that no one else would have ever given me, and I care too much about the work we do, about our people, so I always assumed that we were working knowing that this was a possibility but never did anything about it because of everything else."
"Hey, Jarvis," he says, walking into the kitchen.
"I don't know if I'd call myself a man of science," Steve replies, without moving away from Tony, not even one centimetre, and Tony isn't sure why they're still talking and not kissing. "But I like to know facts before giving an opinion. I'd say that I like to be informed."
The kiss happens. And it's as natural as every other interaction, as sharing coffee, as bumping knees, as texting. Steve's lips are soft but his mouth is determined and he matches Tony's every move and intention. It's absolutely delicious.
"Musicians are annoying, I don't know why I ever wanted to represent them."
"A little more detail would be great."
"I'm heading out actually, Jarvis wants to go over the Christmas menu and the New Year party menu and I promised an early dinner to talk it over."
"We're not just lucky, we're good."
"You don't think so?"
Strange is in an oddly good mood that Tony doesn't complain about, and by the time they're in the car with Happy they've arranged Stephen's schedule to record the song for the album.
"Wanna tell me what the problem was?"
"Why? Carol is mine."
"You know we'd be lost without you," Steve says, he sat back into the couch.
"I was thinking about hiding it in the first drawer 'til tonight," Tony holds out a hand, "want me to put yours too?"
Tony wants to say yes. "You're okay," he writes instead.
"Yeah?"
"I'm sure," Jarvis says, starting to serve the food. Tony notices he took another plate out at some point.
"Count me in, Tony," Peter says, and he's trying to sound cool like Clint or Bucky. It warms Tony's heart. Hedismisses Peter with a smile and grabs his phone from its charging spot.
"All of mine are in."
"You want what?"
"You're silent," Steve says.
Steve smiles, "that's pretty awesome." Tony wants to tell him that he is really awesome.
"How was your day?" Jarvis asks.
"You'll do the opening and closing songs," Tony orders, doesn't ask. "And if I want anything else from you for this album, you'll say
Tony rests his forehead against Steve's when the kiss is over and asks, "alright?"
Tony laughs softly, of course she understands.
"Yes, you're welcome," Thor says, "thank you for asking us."
Tony turns around, maybe Rhodney knows someone who knows someone who can get a Christian choir to work with a guy whose debut album had an inverted cross in the cover. Maybe he can play the sympathetic card, the guy does music with less than 40% of his hearing. Clint hates it when anyone brings that up, says it's just the way things are and that there's nothing special about it, but Tony's desperate.
"Thank you," Tony says, because his mother raised him right. "I think yours are always less complicated than mine."
"Good for you. Did you need anything?"
"If there's nothing else, you can go, bane of my existence."
Tony lived.
Steven hesitates, but they had all agreed to put everything on the line. He had to tell the truth. “I came here with Clint Barton, Natalia Romanova and Sam Wilson.” Steven lets his guard down for a second, but he needs to know whether the others are safe. “Have the others been found yet? The trip was hell on me, I don’t know how bad off Natalia or Sam will be.”
Steven can only mouth
It was a desperate last attempt.
He just hoped that this time he would not be almost beaten to death.
“Come here, let me see.” Comes and American accented Black Widow.
“The Captain is right. We spoke about it yesterday and if there is a chance for us to sign and help with the preparations for Thanos, just tell us where we can help.” Romanova says.
They saw their counterparts fight and rip up an airport, collapse a tunnel with civilians still in it, just plain
And all this to keep one man from being brought to justice… Steven couldn’t imagine what his counterpart was thinking. When Steven read what had happened to the other man, named James Barnes, he couldn’t help but feel like Steve’s entire plan had been wrong from the get go. This James probably would have been declared criminally insane and would have gotten help instead of being convicted to prison.
“So earlier we got an very interesting phone call.” The Colonel starts.
Clint and Other-Clint are yelling at each other, Natasha and Sam are trying to get Steve to stop punching Steven, Other-Sam is yelling nonsense to block out Sam’s attempts to reason with Steve and Natalia is screaming profanities in Russian. And that Maximoff woman seems to just completely loose it.
One day after Other-Clint and Steven were sent to the compound both Other-Sam and Natalia surrendered themselves to the police.
“30 seconds!” Hank called out. The man was standing at the control panel and was pressing all sorts of buttons Steven had no idea what the purpose of was.
"Friday"
"Sure guys" Tony replied and walked away. He felt better and he was happy as well.
"There all done now move your wrist slowly and tell me if it hurts"
The com cracked and the line with Thor went dead. They all knew what that meant and silently grieved for their friend. They were holding their breath, knowing that whether they succeeded or not was now out of their hands. It would all come down if the force field would hold up long enough for the machine to charge.
“So what’s the deal here, why the anger at us?” Sam asks.
“I’ll have them uploaded to the tablets in seconds.”
“Do you know a James Barnes?” Clint asked.
````````````````````````````````````````````
“Terrorists?” Steven asks befuddled. “Sir-” Steven moves again and the Colonel flexes his fingers which causes the gauntlet to make a soft whirring noise and the light glows brighter.
Hours later Natalie is ready to rip her hair out. There had been a few breaks they had to take to let the stupidity of their counterparts sink in. She itched to put a bullet in Natasha Romanoff. The way this Natasha had betrayed those she had allied herself with was despicable.
. Probably in the ventilation shaft or something.
Steven takes this information in and thinks for a second the best way he can put this. “Well, for one, my name is Captain Steven Rogers. Born July 4
Then came the sarcastic question. “Have you gone deaf or something?”
Her name was apparently Friday and she was an AI who controlled the building, which Steven thought was amazing. When told that Clint could not hear her, or at least, not hear her well, a television screen opened up and text appeared on it so that Clint could communicate with her as well. Which made Friday even
They look at each other for a bit, trying to process that information. Rhodey sneaks another look at the calm man in the other room, who had not protested being cuffed to a table, and wondered how he could have ever thought that the man was Steve Rogers.
The Colonel looks at the glass once more and without saying anything got up and left Steven sitting there.
Steven is not sure if he wants to know what the gauntlet can do, despite his curiosity. Steven raises his hands and doesn’t move further. There was clearly something going on and he had no clue what. “Okay, okay. I’m not gonna move. I don’t know what’s going on, but I’ll stay right here.”
And then the ceiling answered them.
Steven arches an eyebrow.
Steven nods grimly. “And a whole lot more.” He looks over to the salon table where he and Clint had been systematically reading and dissecting the Accords. “We have a lot to discuss before the lawyers come tomorrow.”
And then came the accords.
Steven nods. “Yes Sir. The threat, it… it destroyed everything. There was no one left to save on our world, so we sent ourselves to this world, to warn you and hopefully prevent the catastrophe that destroyed our world.”
It succeeds in taking Steve’s attention away from Tony again, luckily. “What did you just say?”
At Tony’s confusion he elaborates, “I just thought, press conference?” The shark-like smile Steven wears when he says it as if it’s the most normal thing on the planet makes Tony get a smirk of his own.
Weeks after returning home Stark industries revolutionized the prosthetics industry and his arm was now, of course, red and gold.
The others nod sadly and Tony can’t help but ask what the SHRA was.
Clint shakes his head. ‘
It hardly mattered because the archer seemed unable to keep his eyes open any longer.
Steven throws Other-Clint a look telling him to stop antagonizing them further than necessary.
Tony just begged that this Rogers would be a little more compromising than his counterpart.
Steven thought deep for a moment. “Yeah, I think so. Pretty sure our sisters played together before my mom died. We might have worked together on the docks as well.” He mushed.
The story he hears is one of the worst nightmares he had about how the Accords could have gone had he not been able to pull as many strings as he had. Steven was right. From what Tony could tell, the SHRA was a nightmare.
Weeks later Tony is knees deep in the preparations for the upcoming battle but at the insistence of Natalia is in the dining hall actually eating.
It came as a shock however when the others had apparently already done some research on their own. And that they were both willing and hopeful to be allowed to sign.
Steve was just back from his run when he ran into his team who were gathered around the TV and were all watching silently in disbelief.
“5 sec-” Hank was cut off by a massive crash. Steven cursed his enhanced hearing at that moment. Hank lay on the floor with multiple big gashes. Steven wanted nothing more than to help Hank, but he knew it would be futile and that it would only have him fail their mission before it even really began. The mission that so many had given their lives for to even make it possible in the first place.
Before Steve can hear more Wanda breaks the TV. They stand in silence around the room not knowing what to say or do.
````````````````````````````````
Steven and Other-Clint had both fallen asleep on the uncomfortable chairs in a waiting room. And when Clint’s nightmares about their world woke him up, the only thing he did was calm him and tell him that this time things would be different.
Steven and Other-Clint both know how awful it can be to be trapped in PTDS land.
“Of course we still are! This is our home!” Maximoff angerly exclaims.
Scratch that, they had been treated
Steven had just finished getting his ears checked and Clint had gotten his ankle in a cast -it was apparently broken- and they were sitting in a boring waiting room at the hospital for an update on Tony. He had been ordered by the Colonel to go to the hospital and stay there. Colonel Rhodes obviously wanted to himself, but he was helping clean up the area and look for civilians who had not been able to evacuate the areas. And now Steven and Clint, who were the only ones besides Tony to be injured in a way that would hinder them from helping, were just… sitting.
So when Tony just one day showed back up in the living room, no one commented.
He silently went along with them and tried to follow the questions they asked. It had been a long time since he last had to make do without his hearing aids and he didn’t like it one bit. He had to leave them behind though since Hank had warned them that he didn’t know the possible effects that electronics might have on the travel, and the effects that the travel might have on electronics. He would not like to have his ears melt off, thank you.
He was heaving heavily when he felt a hand on his shoulder. He immediately lashed out. The figure stepped back with his hands raised. Steven blinked fast and realized that the person he’d just tried to hit was no one other than Colonel Rhodes.
The threat that
It makes him sigh in relief. ‘
The Colonel looks startled and looks at the mirror before turning back to him. “Are you serious?”
1915 in Brooklyn, New York.”
Rogers?” The Colonel asks distrusting.
When they began searching the internet, what they found was horrifying.
. It began with just a few loose ships, some aliens dropping from the skies,” Steven shakes his head. They’d been so
“Friday?” Tony asked. When he received no answer they got into formation, Natalia and Other-Clint flanking Tony who was the only one in the group to not wear his armor. He had the watch-glove which he activated but it wouldn’t exactly stop a bullet.
“Tell me more about this threat.”
Hours later it was confirmed that the damage to Barton #2 hearing had in fact happened 5 to 7 years prior.
``````````````````````````````
Tony could deal with a lot, but seeing Steve standing over him had the breath just rush out of his lungs. He flexed in the handcuffs but he knew it was pointless.
When his hands are cuffed to the table the guards leave the room and he’s alone with Colonel Rhodes. What he hadn’t noticed before was the strange metal contraption that wrapped around the Colonel’s legs.
It was always an insane contrast for Steven. To go from fighting one second to sitting still for hours on end in a chair.
When Steven watched Tony lift the gauntlet with all the stones in it, his stomach sank.
He saw all his team mates straighten up. They all knew the risks. It was possible that this could be the last time any of them saw each other. He could only hope that the last remaining Avengers would live.
They came to the conclusion that this world was utterly
Clint had been equally amazed. Just when Steven thought it could not get anymore high-tech as it was, he asked Clint if he saw a computer somewhere so they could find out what the major differences between this world and their own was.
And that’s the scene the Defenders walk into when they arrive with a STRIKE team. In the end they all end up on the floor in handcuffs, mostly because they’re not sure who is who.
``````````````````````````````````
It was difficult for Tony to see what was happening and he could tell that the others were struggling as well. Their opponents subdued them and it took them a bit to realize what had just happened. It was then that the lights cut back on an Tony saw who had attacked them.
Clint, now with his hearing aids that had been provided for him, answered. “Honestly? Our counterparts seem completely delusional and kind of psychotic. They fucking killed police officers,
"Me? nothing I am just an innocent person" Stephen smirked.
"That is not true cap you know that. You know its not your fault that Clint and Laura are fighting that is how couple are you know they fight but they will be okay" Tony replied sounding confident but he knew Laura wanted to go for divorce.
"It kind of-"
"I am so tired of this Tony I just want this all to end. I want to live my life with you in peace. I know the threat will always be there but I just want a few moments where we do not have to worry about anything" Steve whispered and Tony just sighed. He knew he had to deal with Ross's mess and end it for once.
"Ony Ony, Mama Mama Mama" he was screaming. Clint tried to calm him down.
"I know I know" she said hugging him. Natasha Romanov was not a person who likes to hug but she knew Tony just needed someone right now. She was upset at Steve and angry at herself. If only Bruce was here she thought. She knew bruce and Tony had a bond which no one had but still Tony had her and she had him. She had seen him suffer too much, the council giving him shit and he taking blame for her. He was an idiot but she knew he still loved Steve.
Where the Rogue avengers are back
Tony was surprised. Steve speaking up he wanted to laugh at the situation.
"He is just upset you know how he is. He is blaming himself for breaking the family and what was said about you" Nat replied.
"Steve give him time" Sam said
"I will get the Quinjet lets go" Sam said.
Steve woke up in a weird setting. This was not his room and he was not in tower for sure. Did someone kidnapped him, all these thoughts were running his mind. He hated waking up to a setting like that. After waking up in Shield HQ this was the second time he felt like that and why was everything so hazy. Tony! he remembered. Tony he had to go to Tony. As soon as he started to sit up a hand came on him and before he can hurt the person he saw it was Carol.
Tony was walking Stephen to his room the one Nat had prepared for him. Nat, Carol and Peter went to his floor instead and told him to see them later. He still did not understand what was all that about. Strange always wanted to get things done quickly and go back. He remember him mentioning something about Kamar Taj and how he could not leave it for a long time. They entered Stephen's room.
"Where is your shield cap?" Nat asked and Peter looked at him.
"Why?! I think I deserve an answer or have you screwed up again Steve?!" Tony shouted. Tony did not sleep in 2 days wondering why did Steve left the shield behind and he was tired and frustrated.
"Isnt she suppose to be sleeping? I mean you can call her but Rhodey wil kill you"
"My name is Steve Rogers you must be here for Wanda" Steve introduced himself. Stephen went and stood in front of him taking his hand to shake. They had a strong hand shake.
"Boss the jet is about to land" Friday said.
"Well we don't have Dum-E, YOU and Butterfingers here and they missed you so.." Tony knew Cooper being the oldest was upset with his father and was avoiding meeting him. Laura had spoke to the kids and Lila was confused but Cooper was not happy.
"Tony I did not know you were going to be released at this time" Steve said
"Barnes listen to me I know you are still in there you have to fight" Tony said while making sure the gauntlet was covering his hand but he knew he could not protect himself with only the gauntlet. Steve was still trying to break the door with his strength. Turns out the door was made with titanium alloy and Steve was not given his Shield back.
He promised himself to stay till Tony needed him and he will leave once Tony was healthy. He will inform Tony about this as he did not want Tony to think he left for other reasons. He needed to tell the team as well. If him being away from Tony meant Tony being healthy that is what he will do even if it kills him. For Tony he will do anything.
"They are lying!" Ross had shouted.
"I just contacted Happy he will be outside when we reach there and you both leave me alone for a week and enjoy" Tony said.
"I am okay Steve. I am alive" Tony whispered.
"Steve get up" Steve looked at Tonys eyes he said his name so softly. The brown eyes made contact with him and turned. Steve got up and sat on the chair.
As soon as they settle on bed Vision floated through the wall.
Steve went into the storage room and sat on the stool there with his head in his hands. The whole Siberia incident flashed in front of his eyes and Tony was probably right he should have not tried to stop him. He was scared as well and he knew whoever wanted Tony had to go through him. Steve felt like a failure maybe he had failed to show Tony how much he loved him maybe Tony and him can never go back to how they were before. He just wanted Tony to look after himself and he knew the other were tired as well. He was trying to help and he made matter worse. He was probably being a baby and he should get it together like a soldier but whenever Tony was involved he just couldn't keep it together.
"Mr Stark is shifting in Stark mansion for a few days, he cant leave right now due to the duties here but soon he will be leaving here. Mr Stark I can help you pack pleaseee" Peter said and came to stand next to him.
They all just stood staring and Steve wanted to apologise
"Sorry Mr Stark but its so cool and I love it" Peter said.
"No Stephen just-its not his fault. Please I want to be alone" Tony replied. Stephen just nodded and left the way he came.
"Hey Tony its okay Tony listen to me look at me look in my eyes" Steve knew what had happened and he was so stupid to let it happen. He took Tony's hand and kept it on his chest. "Breath with me Tony breath baby" Steve tried speaking to him. Tony started counting after 5 minute he was back to normal. He looked towards Steve who was siiting with him on the floor with his hand clasped around Tony on his heart. He could clearly see the tears in his eyes.
"You can stay in the guest room if you want?" Tony said.
"He is moving stuff to my room" Tony just hugged her.
"Where are you going?"
"You okay there Buck?" Steve and Sam came forward.
"I am glad everything is working out Stephen. I do not know how many more of these can my heart take" Tony sighed.
"Tony please I did not know I thought it would just power your suit down and I knew Friday would send a signal"
"Well they have holidays coming soon and you know the tradition you have started which drives me nuts but I cant do much. Is he there?" Tony knew why she was calling him, he kept her updated about Clint but also made sure they had enough security.
"Longing. Rusting. Seventeen. Dawn. Stove. Nine. Kind-Hearted. Homecoming. One. Freight Car. Ready to comply?" The tape was played. Bucky was fidgeting but he was looking at Tony. He knew he was in control.
"Thank you so much Tony I really appreciate it" Scott said.
After dinner Tony has announced it was time to leave. Lila wanted to stay which had made Laura and Nathaniel stay behind. Cooper had said clearly that he did not want to stay and came to stand with Tony and Peter who were ready to leave.
"Hey Bucky its not your fault okay? you heard Tony it wasnt your fault" Steve replied.
"I get nightmares too you know about that day" Tony whispered. He could hear Steve's breath and he gently took his hand away from his face and held his hand. Steve's eyes were red.
"Thank you Tony" Nat said smiling and dropping a kiss at his cheek
"I am Steve Rogers, just a guy from Brooklyn" Steve said.
"I will call T'Challa" Tony had said and Nat took his hand to help him. Bucky saw the full extent of Tony's injuries.
"I will go check on Steve" Bucky left.
Tony noticed that the guy just wanted to be with his family. The arm was complete after 2 more hours and it was 7 pm. He could take everyone to the mansion but he knew it was date night for Carol and Rhodey. Though they will be back and they will have there game night he did not want to go and wait for them. He walked into the lounge to see Cooper and Peter talking about some project. Lila was playing with Clint while Nat, Bruce and Laura were busy talking. Scott and Sam were still trying to teach Bucky something he rolled his eyes as Bucky was not getting anything these idiots were explaining. His eyes naturally searched for Steve and he just stood in the balcony aloe starring at the world. Tony wanted to go and console him but the flashback of shield hitting him hit is eyes and he stopped where he was.
"What happened Laura?"
"Steve calm down Tony will be okay" Bucky replied. But Steve wasnt listening all he could think was that he did this.
"What are you doing Stephen" Tony asked.
"Yeah, I think he does" Tony replied with a smile and Peter just nodded and hugged him. He took Tony back to his room and left.
"Sure kid maybe you can help me with the arm"
"I know I screwed up Tony and I am trying here to make up for it but you have to understand that it works both ways" Steve said. He just wanted Tony to tell him what was wrong so he could fix it.
"I did and we are going out on a date" Bruce blushed he was excited and nervous.
"Hi Spidey arent you suppose to be in school"
"The guy was genius I told him to come work at SI he was wasting his time there" Tony shot back.
"I wont Tony I promise you. I know you feel like my words are empty but I promise to show you if you would let me" Steve said taking Tony's face between his hands and kissing him softly. Tony sighed he was getting drunk with Steve's sweet kisses as much as he wanted to fuck Steve he knew they wanted to take things slow and this would only over complicate things.
"Steve you can sleep in the guest room" Tony said again.
"Hey Babe-" she moved back. That hurt all he wanted after these 2 years were to take his family in his arms and he had no idea what had happened. Everyone else was shocked to see Tony with a kid and how did he knew the family so well. They just met once Steve thought.
"Tony please I will do anything I promise whatever you want just don't leave. I know I have hurt you and I did not know the damage I had caused till it happened. I please just I am so sorry I am so sorry" Steve was desperate and Tony knew that but he knew he had to protect himself because honestly in the end you have to protect yourself.
"Yeah Carol, Nat and Pepper remodelled it" Tony replied. Steve looked around and everything was different their picture on the bedside was missing. The whole room was changed.
"Nice to see you Clint" Laura said and Tony kinda put his hand on her back to move. He knew the kids were watching and with Cooper watching he knew he did not want a fight here. Laura moved forward and hugged him and moved back. Clint just stood shocked he had no idea what had happened.
Before Tony could reply Steve interrupted
"Okay Tones we will get the doctor there and I do not want to hear it" Carol had said. Tony just nodded.
"Is there an attack?" Bucky said.
No matter how much he tried he knew he could not do anything right now. The thought of Steve coming back was too much. Natasha entered the room
"Steve you know he cannot get out of the room, right?" Tony replied.
"That is more than enough Tony more than enough" Steve said. Tony saw how a tear made way down Steve's face and before he knew he put his hand up to wipe it and paused. He moved back like he was shocked. Steve eyes were so hopeful at the same moment but now they looked sad.
"Thank you Tony" Steve turned towards Tony.
"You can sit down cap" Tony had said and moved a bit in on his side. Steve took the hint and went where Tony was sitting. He sat opposite to Tony. If this was the last time Steve would see Tony he wanted to at least look at him and remember him.
"I know you were worried about me kid but I told you I wont leave you that easily you are stuck with me. It wasn't Steve's fault you know Ross screwed everything up. You know he fought his friend for me. He is not that bad. Give him a chance please?" Tony had said softly.
Next morning everyone was ready to go. Bruce was a bit nervous but Nat had reassured him that it would be all okay. The results yesterday were really positive and Hulk understood the situation. Whereas Bucky was nervous Steve and Sam had came in to give him the prep talk but he still was not sure about this. Tony looked calm and collected but he was as nervous as everyone else.
"Hey, how long was I out? Are you okay Tony? I didnt hurt you did I? I am sorry I did not m-" Steve started he saw quickly took his hand away from Tony. He missed the warmth but Tony's hand looked a bit weird maybe because he was holding on to it for the whole time he slept. He was interrupted by Tony.
"Laura I I am sorry I didnt mean to I am sorry" Clint whispered
"you okay Tones?" Pepper asked.
"So is your friend gone" Steve asked.
"Steve if you stare any hard at that wall it will crumble" Sam said and Rhodey laughed.
"Bye Tony we have stuff to do"
"Punk?" Came Bucky's soft voice and he was followed by Sam.
"I loved the dinner Steve, it has been long" Tony whispered and Steve understood.
"I am going to think about it and after I see him and see how kids react I will make my final decision" She replied.
"Mr Stark I am ready. Cooper is still sleeping. Last night he was very upset but he will be okay. Is it okay if he can stay here? Also, May called and said hi" Peter came rushing
"You just woke up Steve and you should rest" Rhodey argued. Surprisingly it was Carol who disagreed with Rhodey. She might have seen the how much Steve wanted to be there.
"I am trying Tony and he is trying as well you know. He has apologised so many times and I told him about the divorce. He said to give him a month and if he could not prove himself he will not object. I want to forgive him you know I maybe have. Its Cooper I am worried about what if he doesnt understand this decision and starts to hate me too" Laura said looking outside the window.
Tony woke up still in a haze. He remembered what had happened and a smile made its way on to his lips. He tried smiling but he was in pain. Steve was here when he woke up last. All Tony could remember was bit a pieces of his confession. He looked at his side and saw the blonde holding his hand and sleeping with his head on Tony's bed. He looked around and saw Nat sitting on the chair on his other side.
"Yeah and you still are. We did not know what Ross had planned and it is not like Tony had any idea that this would happen. We have been sitting for the past 6 hours in a meeting and trying to sort the mess" Nat replied.
"Perfect we will leave tomorrow morning around 9 Am" Stephen replied.
"Night Steve" Tony replied.
"How will I ever repay you Tony" Clint said
"STOP EVERYONE! enough. Carol I know you do not like them but please do not start a fight. Guys you need to back off as well. You will say something and trust me she will bite. Everyone just calm down" Tony said in a high voice so everyone could be clear.
"Shh Tony just please accept it. What you did for Bucky on the day of Trial and arranging all this no one would have done it. I am so grateful Tones. Thank you " Steve said and kissed his cheek. Tony just blushed and nodded. He went to his lab in a hurry. What had just happened.
Tony nodded and was off to his Lab. There were his favourite children, DUM-E, YOU and Butterfingers. Well not favourite that was Peter but no one had to know. That kid was something else. He started to visit him in hospital and started babysitting him. He hated it but somewhere inside he was happy that he had someone like him around. Innocence thats what the kid had and he promised himself he would protect that kid no matter what. Well his second favourite kids rolled towards him.
"Boss Scott is at the door" Friday announced.
"Ony Ony"
"I know he is an idiot but he is my idiot I will talk to him" Steve said. Tony was now standing alone doing something on his tablet and Steve went towards him.
"We can talk later Clint he needs rest" Laura replied.
"I am here for you Tony till the end" Steve whispered. Tony just looked at him and leaned in so did Steve and their lips met. It was a tender kiss. It was like assuring each other that they were here. Tony pulled back and sighed. Steve was looking at him and a blush was spreading on Steve's face.
"Its nothing they are lying" Ross had replied.
"Tony is not making out with him" Steve replied.
"Barnes not your fault remember?" Tony said and left with Nat.
"I will always be here Laura and you know that" Tony replied.
"She is in her room, she refused to come out after her meeting with Carol" Steve replied
"Well she just shared some words I would like to share some magic with him" Stephen mummers making sure Tony heard it and Tony just gave hime the look.
"I know I was hoping too much" Steve said with a frown.
"Patch her through Friday"
"It is a black leather book, a small size which fits right into his pocket. I have seen it a quite number of times, however, he never takes it out. Maybe it is just my guess but its worth a try" Nat replied. Everyone nodded.
"I cant decide what to wear, should I wear my suit or should I go casual I was thinking casual but not to casual because what if he is taking me to some fancy restaurant but who cares right? but I do not want to be over dressed you see what I-" Tony was cut off by Rhodey's laugh.
"No Tony No I? what do you mean die? you had the arc reactor removed" Steve was confused and horrified at the same time what had he done.
"Pete I am okay" Tony whispered. The kid was radiating anxiety and Tony thought how much his emotions affect everyone around him. Peter just nodded and sat with Cooper. Cooper just gave Tony the look 'I dont want to be here but now I am stuck' but Tony knew he had to do this. The kid looked up to him and if he ran away from his problem Cooper will do the same. He went to have a seat with Laura and Nat. Bruce had went to his room to get changed.
"Tony" Nat warned him.
"We are on our way Tony. Whats wrong did something happened? Are you okay?" Nat said
laura looked at Tony helpless he knew what was going on and just sighed. He had to speak to Cooper alone and he knew the solution wasnt speaking him infront of everyone that will make him more rigid. He sighed and nodded. Clint didnt replied and looked at Tony and his son in Tony's arm.
"No Stark unlike you I have actual work to do so no. I just wanted to see if you were okay. Oh yeah if you want I can disappear Ross no one would know" Stephen got up.
"You wanna talk about it" Laura asked
"It's okay Tony maybe next time. Where is everyone I wanted to ask them about dinner as well"
"Actually James I have made a hand for you considering I destroyed the last one so this one can be for free but for the next one you have to pay up" Tony said
"Its okay Peter, I understand and you know you can call me Steve" Steve replied smiling at the kid.
"I am not getting back with him I do not know why you keep thinking that I am trying to focus on myself okay?"
"Peter shut up or else I will burn your hair"
"W-at-er" Tony said.
"Who the hell is Barnes" The winter soldier announced and ran towards Tony. Tony shot a repulsor at him but making sure it would only put him down. The soldier dodged and took Tony's hand while dislocating it and throwing him across the room. Outside everyone was panicking and Bruce knew he could not turn into Hulk as it would jeopardise this whole thing and the other guy was not happy. They all knew who did this. While Soldier was beating up Tony. Carol moved towards Steve who was trying to break the door. The door had dents in but was still not opening.
"Stay Ste.." Tony fell asleep and Steve just sat there.
"Okay guys we have to be there at 8 so everyone off to bed" Rhodey said.
"No Dum-E, I told You to make me juice you were suppose to help me clean up and no stop beeping let You do it" You beeped happily and Dum-E looked sad and rolled away.
"Tony I cant do that I get nightmares thinking about-" Steve said and stopped himself halfway. He took his face in his hands and he knew he was about to break down but he couldnt do that not right now. Tony just stood there for a minute. He had told Steve plenty of time he had forgiven him but Steve was hurting and the blonde did not even saw anything about it. Tony felt so stupid for pushing Steve to answer. He walked towards Steve and sat beside him.
"You mean it?" Carol asked
"Hey Steve look at me" Bucky said but Steve didn't stop whispering. Nat intervened.
After breakfast Steve made sure to give Tony a long kiss. "Eww my eyes" Barton screamed. Tony was not complaining but this was surprising Steve was not the one to show affection this way. Wanda and Vision had gone to there quarters excusing themselves to get settled. Barton and Laura went to their floor as well as the kids were in school and they had some time alone. Peter was at School as well. This left Tony, Steve, Nat, Sam Bruce and Strange at the common room.
Vision knew about his nightmare and PTSD and how he felt secure when people he trusted were near him at leat this will help him sleep well.
"I will make necessary arrangements" Nat had said.
I am so sorry for updating after ages. Honestly I think Endgame broke me.
"Tony can you please call me Steve" Tony knew how much he liked listening his name from his lips. He use to moan his name out loud when Steve use to drag him to edge. But no Tony did not want to remember anything. He just rolled his eyes and looked at his watch clearly indicating dont waste my time.
"Tony is on the phone with the council and he is explaining the situation" Clint update Steve.
"Why dont you sleep Nat, sleep here or if you want you can sleep in the lab on the couch. I am sorry I know you dont want to-"
"Guys calm down. We are taking Barnes with us. I have a room for Hulk and if it is about security Barnes can stay there. I am still his legal guardian and I call his shots. You guys might want to look at Ross and see what he has been up to. My team will be in contact with you" Tony said and started walking out with the help of Steve and Rhodey. While others just followed. Barnes was kept in a box while he slept.
Tony and Steve laid in each other arms, Tony's hand was rubbing up and down on Steve's back while his head rested on his chest. Steve was happy at the moment but he still had his doubts he did not want to hurt Tony but he did not know how to approach this topic. "Stop thinking babe" Tony whispered and his hand stopped, Steve moved back a little to look at Tony and smiled "How do you know I am thinking about something?" he said while placing a kiss on Tony's forehead. "I can clearly hear you thinking you know that right?" Tony replied. "Tony you love me right?" and Tony looked at Steve and smiled "Steve if you were paying attention attention I screamed how much I love you around 20 times in the last hour but I will say it again I love you Steven Grant Rogers and I will never stop so throw all this rubbish out of your head and get up we need to go back to our research. Also, I am going to take a shower and you Mr Rogers will join me" Tony replied.
"Well Wanda I have heard you have some extraordinary capabilities and find them hard to control" Stephen asked looking at Wanda
Why are you using your brain so hard Nat"
"I was just thinking" Steve whispered
"I am sorry Captain Rogers" Peter had said and walked away towards his room. Everyone was quiet.
"Why didnt you tell me Tony?" Bruce said.
"Yeah Tony knows him well" Nat replied looking at Carol.
"You! You are the reason Mr Stark keeps getting hurt. Didnt you hurt him enough that you are back to hurt him more. Look what happened be-" Peter was cut off by Tony.
Tony was in his lab tinkering with Buckys new arm. After letting go the anger towards Bucky he felt light. Forgiveness was important he thought he felt like something had gotten off his chest after a normal conversation with the guy. He was still worried about Clint and Laura. He just wanted to fix everything like he always does. Apparently Nat was currently speaking with Clint and with the report Friday provided it felt like everything had gone well between them. Bruce was back and was working in his Lab. He was glad his Science Bro was back. He was currently installing the heating system in the prosthetic arm to make it feel more real. YOU and Dum-E had started a fight and Butterfingers was being Butterfingers.
Clint saw his family and his eyes were already filling up with tears it was so long he had not seen any of them. He was so excited to move and kiss Laura and his kids. However, everyone seemed a bit weird he thought. His eyes went on Nathaniel he hadnt seen him since he was 2 months old and now he is all grown up. He moved forward to kiss Laura
"Its okay James. I understand it wasnt your fault. You have suffered the most and I cant even think what you went through. I am sorry as well" Tony replied getting one more thing off his chest.
"Never again. He is all I want and I will never give up on him ever but he needs his space right now and I am willing to wait" Steve said hoping Bucky was right.
"Come in" Tony replied.
"Whats wrong with your room Nat?" Tony asked not sure if he wanted to know. He was a mess himself.
"Yeah he went back" Tony replied.
"I said I will go and that is final" Tony said and Carol understood. Tony would always protect her and Carol knew she could protect herself well but Tony was Tony. She did not want to take that away from him.
Clint meets his family.
Barnes walked in.
"But why cant we do it here? you have a lab here"
"First its Tony and second I have arranged for families to arrive tomorrow" he gave a look to Clint.
"How about we place the order for food first and Friday will order when the movie is about to finish" Everyone nodded and placed there orders. Meanwhile Laura, Peter, Cooper, Nat and Bruce entered from the kitchen with bowls of popcorns. Peter handed one to Steve.
"Mr Stark isnt here tonight" Peter said before Tony could make up an excuse.
"Does he make you happy Mr Stark?" Peter had replied.
"Well she likes you too much and if she tries just hide behind Rhodey and he will handle it" Tony said walking away.
"Tony..I need to be with him..what did you do?" Steve was unsure why he felt this way.
"Tony we have spoken about this before. Ed please just for a few days and we will be here the whole day anyway" Carol knew what she was doing. She had to protect Tony and if it meant keeping him away from Steve and all these people she would do it. She knew this would give Tony some clarity as well.
"We do," he agrees, "but we like it when the media leaves, way past midnight and it's just us and the kids, the old ones and the new ones. We like it even when Carol and Thor start arguing about anything only to realize mid-argument that they both agree."
"Yes," Steve says, without a second of hesitation. "I imagined us five, ten, even twenty years forward. I imagined Nat working in bigger studios as we grew, you and I talking with more and more people, I even imagining Jarvis' amusement at having to plan bigger parties."
Steve smiles, "so, we have been circling around this since the beginning."
"I like to read," he flashes her a smile but she rolls her eyes at it.
"Just making sure you're okay with recording a song for the Christmas album since it's your first year."
"Technically, Natasha did that," Clint grins, "but I'm saying we as the whole label, she's really good."
"Ah! Yes," Clint walks a little closer and looks for his phone in his pocket to search for something. He takes another sip of his mug and stops what he's doing to look at it, "oh, you're empty," he says, to the mug probably.
"I can do as I damn want, Stark," after that, with an unnecessary flourish of his cape (why is he even wearing a cape?) Thor leaves the office.
"Hello, sunshine,"
way."
The reply comes instantly again, "I wouldn't want to do it with anyone else."
"Oh, it's you," he says to the newcomer.
"I'm going to kiss you now,"
"Do you want me to take care of Thor?"
"And you know this because?"
"I didn't know you were coming."
"I just got you a choir last week."
Jarvis puts a plate in front of her and motions Tony to sit in his place. He does, and as a reward he gets food and Natasha's smile.
"Very responsible."
"Because not everyone was given the same treatment and it was unfair." Jarvis relates, "you were also fed up with corporations and drunk at that time. And younger."
"I think we made a fair job," Thor says, and behind him Jane rolls her eyes and Tony agrees with her on so many levels.
"One more thing, Tony,"
Tony doesn't reply to that, he thinks about that party, about how it was them and just a bit of media, but at least some, he thinks about the morning of the first day of the year and waking up to find Steve and Jarvis talking in his kitchen and he remembers how at that moment, four years ago, he decided he was going to share his life with that man, in whatever way he allowed him to. So maybe, in a way, he also imagined them. But he still has an issue grasping that it has become a reality. He says that last bit to Steve.
They leave shortly after that. Tony actually really likes them, even likes Thor. They're one of the first bands the label had and they've both grown together, but sometimes Tony would like to--
"We can agree on that," she says.
"It was a good morning until Thor happened," he sits up straight, Steve is holding a mug and Tony makes grabby hands to it. He gets it. He doesn't want to punch Steve anymore. He wants to kiss him. As usual. The coffee is very good.
"Climate change."
"I'm aware," Jarvis replies.
"Absolutely," Steve nods and Tony turns to walk away only to be stopped by Steve.
"Did you know," Tony tells Steve, "that if we take biology into account, Santa's sleigh is pulled only by female reindeer?"
"Of course, Mist--Tony," Peter smiles, "you don't even have to ask."
"When you started this no one was surprised," she says, "you had been on the music industry for about twenty years, consulting for a lot of people, pointing artists in the right direction, covering people's messes, offering money when it was needed. You still were the CEO who liked to mess with music for most people, but anyone who actually worked with you could see that there was much more to you than just your money and your contacts."
"Not yet, but Natasha got Quill and his people already inside," Tony replies before taking a sip of the coffee. He tastes something odd in it, not bad per se, just different. He gives it back to Steve.
"You wanted to see me?" Peter walks in, there's still some glitter on his face and Tony wonders if he had a recording that day that he doesn't remember or if he just started using glitter regularly. Both are possible.
Tony grabs the cup again, takes a big gulp and lets the coffee sit in his mouth for a moment. He swallows. He takes another sip out of malice. Then he notices,  "you put nutmeg on this, didn't you?"
Bucky laughs and Tony smiles, "good to have you back."
"Someone has to be, in this relationship," Steve reasons. Tony can't argue with that logic and he says it, slowly, so when the words make his lips move forward they're ghosting Steve's.
"I'll try, good luck with Stephen."
"I'll take care of that."
"We all hate that party, Tony."
"I figured," Natasha dismisses it, Jarvis pointedly doesn't look at Tony.
Steve gets up and doesn't dignify the question with an answer, he takes one last sip of the coffee before walking to the door with a final "I'll talk to Thor."
"Then our people keep getting better and better," Steve replies. He points to the free couch next to his and Tony, against his own wishes, refuses with his head.
When Tony goes to bed, he dreams of reindeer socks and waking up to see them on his bed. It's pleasant.
"What?"
"You want the man that only answers to a stage name and who wears a cape even outside his stage persona to be reasonable?"
"You're welcome," it's the first reply he gets, and immediately "doing what?"
"Actually, Thor complained with Quill, who then came to me."
"Yeah?"
"Sure, bring it, we're on a row."
Clint is laughing with Bucky at something they're seeing on one of their phones while Quill and his bandmates are inside the studio. Tony observes them from the door with a certain peace he's still not fully used to. It's the fifth year they're doing this. The album, sure, but the work together in general. Tony still finds it weird, that he's allowed to have all of this. That they want to do this with him.
"Bet your neighbours loved that."
"Hey," he says from Steve's office door where he's sitting on his couch, headphones on, and clearly he didn't hear Tony, but he sees him and smiles when he does. Tony smiles back as Steve takes the headphones off.
"Absolutely," she says, and walks towards them. She gives Tony a kiss on the cheek and another to Jarvis, compliments the food and sits on the table, all in one wonderful swift move.
"I know, just let me be irrational a little."
"Cool," Clint says, and he sounds so stupidly pleased that Tony has to make an effort not to smile at his plain existence.
"I had my job at SI, this was a hobby," Tony replies, "until it wasn't."
"It's a valid coffee addition," Steve says, and he's not laughing anymore, but Tony doesn't move away. For the record, neither does Steve. "And you're drinking it, so you can't complain."
"Being on the other side."
"She knows," Tony agrees and Natasha makes a sound of agreement.
"Shuri's coming tomorrow, Steve is picking her up," Natasha says, after thanking Jarvis for the cup of chocolate she's holding.
"That'll be alright," Steve agrees. When he talks, the air from his mouth touches Tony's lips.
"Spoilsport," Bucky says, while Tony walks inside.
"That," Natasha presses a few buttons and looks at Tony, "we've been doing this for years and you've never brought anything like that up."
"Are you two done?" Steve asks, from his side on his desk.
There's a text from Steve when he unlocks his phone: "I'm sorry. But I fixed things with Thor, am I absolutely marvellous?"
Clint is not absolutely marvellous.
"That only happened once," Steve replies, and Tony can imagine his face when he's saying it.
"Jarvis," Steve says that as if it's obvious that he and Jarvis talk about Tony's diet.
It's amazing for less than a minute because she says "so, you fought with Thor?"
"Don't worry, I'll keep repeating it."
They spend the rest of the afternoon designing the press statement.
"Can it be carol singers?" Tony asks, looking away because damn Clint and his adorable toddler look.
"Why?" Tony is pretty sure he asked this already.
The album is in Tony's hands the last weekend of November, and once he and Steve say the word, it'll be shipped to stores and radio stations.
"We'll look into her," he says, giving Clint his phone back.
Tony leaves the room and goes to his own office. Carol is sitting there with her hair up and writing furiously on her phone.
"You just don't want to talk about the party."
"It's not the same, I really think a choir would be a nicer touch."
"I have no idea, wanna come over and find out with me?"
"And Tony?" Natasha says, "we're a we. So no one is walking out."
"Clint wants a choir."
"'Cause Bucky and I went to see her live a few nights back."
Tony straight up sighs, he thought he had this covered "climate change or planned parenthood?"
Tony is waiting behind a small crowd of people with Strange's merch and shirts. He can recognize a few faces, the ones that have been around from the start, the one that put up with Stephen's...
"Yes, we are."
"I finished T'Challa's tour details and caught an early flight from London. Since I wasn't sure when I was going to get here, I only called Edwin."
Tony smiles, can't meet Steve's eyes, and he looks down to the floor before looking up, but not at Steve. "We've been doing this for five years Steve, did you think we were gonna make it that far when we started?"
Steve nods and grabs the cup before Tony gives it to him. He seems to be measuring how much is left, maybe he's thinking that he should have bought a bigger one.
"You said about our future" Steve whispered being shy and Tony just laughed.
When Tony came up he saw everyone was sitting at the table and waiting for him. His seat was in between Steve and Peter. "I am here" Tony announced and took his seat. "You are late Stark we have been waiting so long" Barton said. "Well I am never late everyone is just early not my fault..ouch" Steve elbowed him and he just gave him 'Wtf look'. After they were finish eating Pepper got up to make an announcement.
Somewhere someone was making a plan to destroy the avengers and they would do anything. They failed in killing Captain America in the field but they knew if they were separated it would be much easy to strike.
"She is just a kid" Clint argued
"Why is he doing this? I mean the council is already up to his ass he is in trouble, why add more trouble?" Clint asked.
"Eyes on me Barnes" Tony said and Bucky nodded. He was looking at Tony and he was smiling. Bucky could do this.
Everyone gathered in the common room. Tony stood behind the couch while Carol sat on the couch with Rhodey and Peter. Nat and Vision stood beside Tony. While Pepper was keeping all the accords on the table in front of them.
"Why dont you guys sit down and we can talk" She stared at Steve and everyone sat except for Steve and Bucky.
"But the important lesson is that we are here and together" Rhodey had said.
"That is great Pete" Tony replied smiling.
Natasha did not say anything else she knew he wont tell her what it was about but she had an idea what it could be related to. There were moments like these where she wanted to go and punch Steve but she knew it was something she cant do because Tony would never want Steve hurt no matter what.
"Bucky would wake up approximately tomorrow in the evening. We need to be there to asses who wakes up in that room" Tony started.
Wanda knew she wanted to be better for Vision and if this would not happen and if she screwed up her powers will be taken away from her. She thought at least this way she could spend some time with Vision. She nodded. "Yes I will come with you" Vision smiled at here. "I am so proud of you Wanda" Vision said. That was all Wanda needed to hear.
The car ride was quiet Steve was sitting next to Tony while Bucky and Sam were in the back. It felt weird sitting with Tony in front. Whenever they use to drive Tony use to hold his hand throughout the way. He use to scold Tony about it but he liked it. It was a habit they had and now they were just sitting like strangers. He turned to look at Bucky and he was just staring outside. Steve prayed that everything would go well.
"Tony please can I have a word alone" Steve said
"Tony please I will agree to whatever you want okay? just dont give me these back" Steve pleaded
"We would not harm him Miss" Sam said
"I spoke to Carol you know" Tony sighed "I told her to give me a chance but then I understood where she was coming from you know how can I ask her to give me a chance when I cant give myself a chance. I have hurt you a lot" Steve moved his first hand which was dressed up by tony towards his face to touch his skin and Tony suddenly flinched and moved back. Tony was panicking in the bathroom all he saw was steve's hand coming towards him and he panicked he could remember Steve putting crashing his Shield.
"Jeez I am going, do you wanna stay in my room?" Tony asked he knew it was hard for her and if she went to her room she will just drink vodka and think about Bruce and Clint. Maybe Tony did not want to feel alone.
"That thing has a name it is the Cloak of Levitation" Strange replied.
Tony was discharged at 5 am in the morning. Okay Tony wont say it being discharged but he kind of snuck out by telling nurse he was done and he is leaving. He knew he had to speak to Steve and he knew the blonde will be getting ready for his run.
"No and he looks guilty enough and I-" Tony was interrupted again.
They started walking towards the main lounge. Steve was sitting with Sam. Bucky, Wanda and Clint were speaking about something and Lang was not in sight. Nat and Rhodey had briefed them about everything. The kitchen was stocked and whoever wanted can cook and updated with the current political situation. They also told them to give Tony time and try not corner him. Steve was also told that his stuff had been transferred to his old floor.
"Okay Hulk you know about the Trial please be nice big guy or else they will take Brucie bear and you away" Tony said.
"Bucky are you sure?" Steve asked.
"Okay guys I am off I will see you guys tomorrow at 2 pm. Nat Stephen is coming in so make sure his room is ready I do not want to hear him yapping all day"
"Bruce is with them. How about you get fresh Steve?" Nat replied. Steve did not want to leave Tony yet but maybe they were kicking him out.
"I have my guns with me and that is enough I can still fight without it"
Stephen's back was facing Tony. He froze for a second and turned a bit not looking Tony in the eye he couldnt lie to Tony but he never wanted to put Tony in the position he was in. "Tony you are a great friend and all I want from you is your friendship. Take care Stark I will see you soon" and he was gone. Tony wasn't convinced but he knew if Stephen had feelings for him he would have made his mood. He sat in the lounge as everyone was busy eating. Steve came in.
"M-y po-ck-et" Tony tried to speak and Rhodey nodded. Rhodey reached out and saw an injection in the while Tony just nodded towards Bucky and Rhodey administrated it. Bucky stopped struggling. It was something Tony had kept with him if something went wrong. Bucky and Tony had a small chat.
The coffee at his floor had run out and he thought he needed a really strong one after this. He could feel a headache coming up. He went down to the common kitchen hoping no one was there Boy he was wrong. Sam and Bucky were sitting there.
Tony sat in his lab. It was a temporary one he had at the mansion. This mansion held memories good and bad that is why when Carol and Rhodey got married Tony thought to gift them the mansion. Although, Rhodey and Carol did not agree to it however, they made a deal that they will pay rent as they both have been to this place numerous time while they were young. Tony had his lab here because usually Rhodey or Carol dragged him here for dinner and made him stay with everyone else. Once he had brought Steve here and he had thought that one day maybe him and Steve can live here. Well it was not going to happen ever.
"Okay Mr Stark. But you will tell me if something is wrong, right?" Peter was now sitting in the chair beside him.
"Hey Nat, when you coming back?"
"Okay what happened who do I need to kill?" Carol asked. rhodey just rolled his eyes.
"Buck I screwed up I almost killed him" He started crying again. Bucky and Sam just hugged him and sat there with him for a while.
"Well we did not almost die Tony you did follow the diet or we will take you back" Rhodey replied. He had dealt with this a long time ago.
"Stark you said that we were alright to come back and-" Clint was interrupted by Nat.
"Yeah Cap I am fine. I had to speak to you about something" Tony said turning towards Steve and keeping his tablet on the table.
Tony, Carol and Rhodey sat together like Old times. They spoke about MIT and all the stupid things they have done together. Carols accident and Rhodey losing his hsit after that.
"Boss Barnes is outside should I let him in" Friday asked.
"I did not mean what I said I mean I was saying that you look nice and it must have taken a long plan to look nice" Peter started rambling Tony noticed he knew they had a suprise or something and kid had messed up.
"I..I..a.m"
"Tony sometimes its okay to not to be fine. You wanna talk about it?" Tony just moved his head and Steve understood.
"Hi Car bear, where is my other sweetheart?" Tony asked. He thought he was going to be ambushed by both of them
"I can deal with Ross Tony" Pepper said.
Bucky hugged Steve.
"Tony?" he could hear in the distance 2 people shouting "Hi uncle Tony, I want to talk to uncle Tony. No I want too"
"Good luck" Carol said slowly. Wanda just nodded and whispered "Thank you".
"Yeah I can see that Cap" Sam replied rolling his eyes. Steve replied but his eyes were stuck at the door. He knew Tony was out there maybe he will visit him later. He remembered how he had jumped in between and the blast. Nat was watching Steve she knew what he was waiting for.
"Tony we love you just remember that" Nat said and he smiled at her and turned to see everyone nodding.
"Tony my love, I do not know if you can hear me or not but I just want you to know that I love you and I always have and you need to be alright and wake up soon because I need to say it how much I love you because I regret not saying it enough. You gave me home when I thought I had no where to go. Tony you made me the happiest man on planet. When I woke up in that room I thought I would never be happy everyone I knew was gone and I met you. The genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist and I had never been so wrong about someone in my entire life. You proved me wrong. I hated it when you carried the nuke in the wormhole. I was so scared and when you came back I was so relieved. You always beat me up to things you know. Nat had been teasing me about you since we moved in the tower and I had the whole speech planned to ask you out but you beat me to that and asked me out on the date. You did not see me as Captain America I was just Steve to you. Your Steve. I know you say you have forgiven me but I hate myself for what I did to you. One day I hope you could forget everything because I just realised life is to short to not tell the other person how much they mean to you. Tony I do not want to live in a world where you dont exist. I love you and I will always be here because I do not want to spend another moment fighting with you. I know my presence have hurt you enough and I will do whatever will make you happy and safe. Even if that means being away from you. I love you baby" Steve kissed his hand and just held on to it.
"I was showing Bucky how a phone works" Sam replied
"Hey Tones I leave you for another month and you get hurt so you could see me again. How desperate of you" Stephen said.
"I know at least someone is happy"
"Last time I fought a super soldier I walked out my way fine so do not give me your reasons. Barnes are you okay with me being there?"Tony asked dismissing Steve.
"What if I dont" Wanda asked.
Bruce went in first with Nat and one female and one male officer. The Hulk behaved well and accordingly. The whole team stood on the other side of the door and saw the whole process. Bruce had passed the test and Ross did not look happy. Next it was Barnes turn. Tony moved to get his suit but was cut off by Ross as he informedTony that he was suppose to be a civilian and was not allowed the suit. Tony just nodded but he was panicking from inside he knew it could do very wrong but he felt like he owed this to Bucky as he nearly killed him. Carol was not happy and Rhodey had to calm her down. No one was happy with this decision but they knew the consequences.
"Tony you are okay. You are in your room and you are safe" Steve whispered. Tony just nodded and kept his hand on his face.
"Because from the past half an hour I am trying to show him how to text and this guy just wont figure it out" Sam sighed
"We are ready to sign" Steve said and picked up the pen and signed. Soon everyone followed.
"I know things wont be the same again Tony but I-we can start over and if you dont feel like it I will back off. You just need to tell me and I will take your word but I really want to try" Steve whispered.
"Jeez Steve shut up and listen to me okay?" Tony said and removed his hand. Steve felt the loss of Tony's touch. he just nodded.
"Tony I just wish I could help and I hate when I dont know how to help you" Steve said.
"I can sit with him. You guys can go rest or help the team I can watch over him" Steve said.
"He brought you in and was with you the whole time. He is pissed Steve" Nat said after she saw the question mark on Steve's face that why Tony wasnt here. Steve just nodded. He knew Tony was upset. He will speak to him once he get out.
"Nothing man" Scott replied
"I mean what are you doing here I thought you were busy. Are you leaving? I mean I know you have to go was there something you need to tell me about-" Steve was interrupted.
"There is no point of you asking anyone Sam as everyone as at Stark mansion and will be having the dinner there. Is your stuff ready Tony?"
"There was an explosion" Carol replied.
"So now as Tony has gone lets drop being nice. Lets be clear on one thing I do not like anyone of you and I will not unless you give me a reason otherwise. Sam you seem nice but I am not sure how nice you are, James has forgiven you and told me about you so you might be the only person I can tolerate. James/Bucky you do not have any memory of the crime you committed and have suffered enough so I do not hold anything against you but stay a bit away from him till he decides. Clint try not to piss Nat off anymore than you have by protecting people.." Carol was about to say more when she sensed the mind invading tinge she knew where it was coming from.
"Steve we have to stop hurting. We need to stop hurting each other and ourselves. This way we wont go anywhere" Tony replied and Steve just nodded.
"I am so sorry Mr Stark we did not know what happened. It was a malfunction and I sincerely apologise. We are going to take Mr Barnes in our custody and-" Ross was interrupted.
"Where is Wanda?" Tony asked
"Yes Boss"
Tony moving Out
They got up and moved to the common room where everyone was gathered. Tony entered followed by Steve, everyone looked up and Strange was next to Tony in a second he knew something was terribly wrong. Steve didn't like Strange but he was glad Tony had people who really cared for him. "There was an explosion at the mansion" Tony started. Everyone interrupted with questions.
