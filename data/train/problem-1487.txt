“Good night, Effie.”
“Back to Belfast,” Sherlock said. He didn’t know this for sure, but it seemed likely.
Sherlock couldn’t help laughing, though it always stung a little when Rowan talked like this. “Are you going to tell that one to Mummy?”
“Depends on the day,” Kate said. “Okay, I’ll find both of them. You lot stay where you are and under cover, understand?”
His life was over and Mycroft had brought a cake?
“Then I suggest you fetch your lieutenant immediately so he does not suffer the consequences of your ignorance,” Sherlock snapped.
“Yeah, all that,” John said, smiling.
“My cousins are coming tomorrow,” Sherlock said one particularly lovely afternoon. Sherlock had obtained permission to stay out until tea so that they could visit an abandoned quarry he had heard about, and they were currently lounging on a limestone shelf overlooking the quarry pool. John, who had been warned three separate times by Gregson not to let Sherlock fall into anything, had set the satchel in front of them in a feeble attempt to keep Sherlock from leaning over the edge. The pool
Lady Merton looked out the window again. Sherlock could read her thoughts so clearly he thought the maids could probably hear them two floors below.
and the door slammed open again. Two more men stormed in, raising their own Kalashnikovs, but before they could even aim Anton shot them both in a burst of automatic fire. There was a moment of stunned silence. Even Lyudmila seemed too shocked to shriek.
“The police work for Mirzayev, everyone says this. For one night only they will store the opium.”
“Ahh,” Molly breathed happily as the lock clicked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but he couldn’t help smiling as he turned back to the laptop. He’d never had a nickname bestowed in affection before, and besides, he rather liked the image of himself hopping busily from clue to clue, nibbling away at the internet until he found what he needed.
Mister last word, John thought. But somehow it didn’t carry the wry humor thoughts like that usually did, and he felt strangely heavy as he made his way home.
“Oh, thank God,” John said, shutting the cookbook. “What, you and Owen?”
“Can you get in?”
“No, I can’t, tomorrow’ll be bad enough as it is,” Effie said, tossing back her wine. “Give it to him, he’s all morning to sleep it off.”
Irene’s mouth quirked. “Of course you will, if Seven has anything to say about it. It’s you who will have to decide in the end.”
Trevor pulled out one of her ever-present pads of paper and a silver pencil, sketching a graph with a timeline at the bottom. “We’re right here, yes? There’s a certain amount of baseline entropy, which fluctuates, but let’s assume for our purposes that’s remained essentially stable up until recently. Here’s a little blip around the start of nuclear fission and you can see that leads to a gradual increase, but as a matter of scale it’s practically irrelevant. Here’s the big jump about three and a half years ago, and here’s the second big jump right now.”
“I believe we’re going to need a tool of some sort to replace this,” he said, giving Minchin a look of melting helplessness. “Perhaps we’d best do it in the morning.”
“Well, that’s not what we want. I’ll prescribe a different draught—just honey, and a bit of something for the pain in your chest. But it won’t make you confused as the other did.” Dr. Woodcourt smiled kindly, and Sherlock actually smiled back—the first real smile John had seen on him since coming to the hospital. John, however, was still not completely reassured.
“Look, Sherlock…” Lestrade rubbed awkwardly at the back of his head. “You need to stay home today.”
They rode in a tense silence for several long minutes before John said harshly, “Why didn’t you work it out before?”
John glanced at Mycroft quickly and got a quick negative shake: not Sherlock. “Can he contact Mars?” Malinowski asked.
“Sherlock, sit
John looked up just as Sherlock leaped to his feet, grinning like a maniac and clutching Lestrade’s phone.
“What, you weren’t freaking out?”
a fair percentage of the population had fled, or had returned to their native countries (or their parents’) as far back as Brexit,
They were quiet the rest of the way. St. George’s Cathedral was the oldest and grandest of London’s high society churches and thus, since the Restoration, the centre of omega life. Traditionally it was open exclusively to omegas between noon and three, so the midday service was widely attended; for most of the handmaidens it was their only chance to get out of the house. In his past life Sherlock thought he might have been there once—dragged to a society wedding by his parents—but now, lifelong atheism notwithstanding, he went every day.
Sherlock seemed to have no argument with this, so John went on. “Which brings us to your foul little
Sherlock let the noise fade, keeping his eyes closed. He had died alone and in pain and afraid, but what haunted him were the regrets that filled his last moments.
“Lassus…the polyphonic thing?”
“You know I see through that,” Mary said, but she was smiling again. “Take care of yourself, all right? And Sherlock—keep him in trouble.”
“It’s perfect,” Sherlock said sincerely.
They tracked down the Michelangelo triptych—and a great many other valuable things too—in Kent, and the whole case came off with no one getting hurt or annoying the local police to the point of getting arrested. They both enjoyed themselves immensely and the next time Lestrade called with a man apparently drowned in a toilet Sherlock sighed dramatically and said, “Well, as we’ve nothing else on.”
Sherlock knelt deferentially at the edge of the blanket and murmured to the man, in a voice too low to make out, but the man barked out an unexpected laugh. “And how are you going to do that?”
Sherlock’s arm tightened briefly around his middle, and John squeezed him back. “I love you.” His voice was soft and slow, as though he were already half asleep.
“Broth,” John muttered, making a note.
“Isn’t her commander that rather hairy one, though?”
“So, I don’t want to you to feel as if we have to do anything in particular, but if you—“
“Oh get on with you,” Mrs. Hudson demurred, blushing. “I’m just glad all that time I spent changing nappies went to good use.”
Sherlock looked up at Wiggins. “If I take the blue one—“
“No, I don’t want to go to Clara’s birthday party. You’re holding the invitation, it came weeks ago, you responded when you still had a girlfriend, now you’ve realized that the party is tomorrow and you’ve no time to procure a date, so you’re about to ask if I’d like to go. I wouldn’t. I’d be bored and behave badly and make you angry. Ask Molly; she’s sure to be free, and she’ll be flattered, which will be helpful next time we need her for something.”
“Too early again, and the childbed fever. My Lady and the baby both lost. A hard way to go; my own mother was the same.”
“What, face down?”
“Oh God, why didn’t you say so before? I can copy all these tomorrow!”
John turned his head, trying to catch Sherlock’s mouth, but Sherlock was having none of it. He moved his face closer to John’s ear. “What would they think if they knew,” he murmured in a low voice. “What if they come back here, looking for you?”
“Oh for God’s sake,
“Sure,” John said, following him in and leaning on the bench.
At the side door Sherlock switched on the black-light app on his phone and had John hold the beam on the keypad. “Standard five digit code, last one will be the star, first one obviously three, but only three keys are…” he frowned at the keypad for a moment before his face cleared and he punched in 3738*. The door swung open.
Yet I survived that, so I swallow and nod, a fractional movement that does nothing to calm the ache in my chest or the prickle in my eyes. The floral pattern mocks me now more than ever.
“Very funny,” I nod, feigning smugness. “But then you always are.”
"Yes. Sentiment is a mere whim, a distraction of higher thought processes. If I wanted distractions then I would binge reality television or develop a smoking habit." There was a harshness in his voice that showed John he had conditioned himself to believe the rhetoric. By the sound of it, the man had not actively sought out his soulmate and an unusual feeling washed over him as he remembered the endless dates he had been on to find his own soulmate, and how travelling three continents while in the army was not enough to find them.
“Because so are
” Sherlock cried, his back arching, and John was rewarded immediately with the taste of bitter fluid running down his throat and a series of choked moans above him. John pulled off and coughed, spit almost dribbling from his chin, and saw Sherlock staring up at him with a debauched and shocked expression.
“Um... what do you have? We're doing anatomy at the moment and it's not going in,” he gestured to his head now that the man had stopped walking. “Can't concentrate,” John added with a smile.
The library was louder than usual, full of chatter and laughter from younger children. A group of them were clustered in the corner, sat on the floor listening to a story and interrupting it with squealing. John rolled his eyes and groaned at how noisy it was going to be until he quickly recognised the purring voice of the reader. He turned and saw the attendant whose face he had memorised and the effect was an embarrassing flutter jolting through his chest. There the stranger was, sat on a red beanbag, surrounded by kids, reading what looked like a copy of 'The Hungry Caterpillar' as if it was sensational literature. John shook his head and made his way to a desk far away from the children and tried to focus.
“What
In the glow of the fire his face is different. Although I’ve seen it in the exact same lighting countless times before, it seems somehow changed. I observe the creases, the withered lines that deepen as time goes on but only grow more beautiful to me. The crinkles around his eyes reveal themselves as a smile forms, lips curling upwards, unrestrained thanks to the release of inhibition alcohol provides.
John pondered this as he listened to Sherlock tell him about the importance of preserving forensic evidence at murder scenes, hands waving dangerously close to their half full cups every few seconds. If John was honest, he had no idea what Sherlock was talking about but the way he said everything with such passion was incredibly endearing. It made his chest ache; he hated how attached he was growing already.
"Honestly, I haven't considered what I want," Sherlock said. "I'm just desperate to be rid of this." He gestured to the name inscribed on his wrist and John gave a sad smile, immediately knowing what it was Sherlock wanted rid of. It wouldn't be the first cover up of this kind he'd had to do, not by any means, but it still saddened him. With a pang of longing, John's thoughts turned to the name inscribed on his own wrist.
“For a
"Show me your wrist." Confused, John pulled the cuff of his shirt up, revealing the trails of the tattoos that were part of a colourful sleeve, as well as the 'William' faintly inscribed upon his wrist. He hoped this man that seemed so observant could not deduce how fast his heart was beating but, knowing his luck, the man would probably hear it and laugh.
' John's pulse faltered. Several questions flooded his mind, most importantly,
“Have my botany lessons taught you nothing? The carnations, John.”
"Yeah?" His breathing quickened at the sound of his name on Sherlock's lips once more and there was nothing he could do to resist dropping his eyes to them.
“I’m not tired. What were you going to say?”
“Always, I’m afraid.”
“How do you know I’m a medicine student?” he called, wondering if this man had watched him study.
Sherlock’s lips found John’s and resumed their earlier mission, tongue caressing his mouth and breath filling his lungs. John groaned, hands tugging at Sherlock’s trousers and underwear and the taller man eased his hips upwards to help him.
“Wouldn't be as good as you though.”
“John, really. I was just looking at you.”
* * *
, someone might come in and I don’t think they’d appreciate seeing what’s about to happen,” John breathed against Sherlock’s cheekbone, trying hard not to jerk his hips forward and grind into the other man’s body.
John was a little non-plussed by Sherlock’s reaction to his uniform. But he decided to steer the conversation away for now.
All eyes rested on Sherlock, then John, who looked at each other, then giggled like children…. There were gasps all round… Mrs Hudson took a handkerchief from her sleeve and dabbed at her eyes.
“OK, John, I’ve been thinking of what you asked me, and I want to say that nothing would make me prouder than to adopt Rosie…. But on one consideration. Will you marry me?” Sherlock held his breath.
“Aaah, its quiet”, John sighed, rolling his shoulders to unfurl his tight muscles. He looked around and quickly tidied Rosie’s toys away into her toy box and put her books back on her shelf before going to make a cup of tea.”
John couldn’t speak. He wanted to stay in character, but his heart was beating hard as he felt Sherlock's breath on his cock.
"Sherlock, come for me… come for me…"
The air in the room was suddenly full of nervous energy and sexual tension. John looked Sherlock up and down, stopping at his groin, where an obvious erection was vying for attention against the expensive but narrow cut of the costume trousers.
Sherlock smiled, and took his hand.
“Sherlock had spent the train journey trying to work out escape plans, and ways to protect John in the inevitable fall out. He just stood. Mouth open before remembering his manners. “He told you?” Sherlock mumbled, his usual articulation escaping for a moment.
“Oh, Sherlock, I didn’t mean, well, by boy’s night out, I sort of meant, me and you, a meal maybe, a bottle or two of wine, whilst we have no responsibilities, and just to chill out. I didn’t mean a big get together with all of Scotland Yard.”
, Sherlock scolded himself. “That’s certainly an idea. Should you like to hear my counteroffer?”  He held up the memory stick. “I’ll trade you this. The missile plans for John, unhurt. It will move you up quite a bit—international player, quite a step up for a small timer from Belfast. And of course, you’ll have me in the game. Trying to stop you, of course, but I can’t imagine you’d want anything else.”
“Of course,” Simon said with serene confidence. “That’s why I’m a chaplain and not a vicar. I’ll always leave the ninety-nine to care for the one.”
John did not see Sherlock until the fourth night, when he was startled awake by Sherlock crawling under his arm, shivering.
“Don’t bother, I’ve seen you look worse. And then the food would get cold. It’s pissing rain out there so I got Vietnamese. You remember that case, the one with the poltergeist, the one where you practically drowned?”
“Quiet.” Mr. Brocklehurst’s voice was deadly calm again. “You saw no such thing. There is no need to rouse the whole household for a mere nightmare. Now get up.”
. Sherlock felt warm all over. He knew John loved him – John found talking about feelings so difficult that when he did there could be no doubt he meant it – but hearing him say it like that, along with assurances that Sherlock was enough the way he was… it was almost too much.
Sherlock thought about it, about the way John’s hands had felt on his heated skin, stroking and groping and teasing.
Somewhere, John finds the energy for a self-satisfied grin.
, Sherlock nearly moans with how good it feels simply to be held and kissed and wanted.
Sherlock looks at him from under his lashes, breathing hard. John wants to fuck him right now, bend him over the sofa and take him, but he knows he needs to keep himself in check in order to keep up with Sherlock.
Sherlock shrugs. “I was just wondering if there’s a way we could fabricate a reason for Lestrade to be there at the same time.”
Despite his generally self-effacing demeanour, Robert has turned out to be confident in bed, and rightly so. He’s a skilled and generous lover, patient with Sherlock’s inexperience and happy to indulge his curiosity. His post-sex hugs are amazing, even if he tends to fall asleep during them. As Sherlock predicted, he finds having a stable partner much more satisfying. He gets more comfortable and confident with each encounter and he finds great satisfaction in learning Robert’s body and being able to give him pleasure. He feels quite secure now about his skills in manual and oral stimulation, and he’s managed overcome his hesitance about topping too. It helps that Robert is big and strong – it seems less likely that Sherlock could hurt him, and gradually he learns to relax and enjoy the moment without any bad memories getting in the way.
“Sherlock,” John says, and the way he says it makes Sherlock look at him. “We’re not making a
“Do I?” John’s grip on Sherlock’s wrist tightens painfully. “Then why did I just see Wiggins down the street, hm?”
“Some old manor house in Hertfordshire and she can pick the weekend. Why?”
John holds Sherlock’s head up with one hand and brings the bottle to his lips with the other. At first he seems barely able to swallow and water dribbles down his chin, but he revives gradually drinks greedily before collapsing back down on the pillow with a sigh. John takes a few quick gulps of his own and then lies back down, pulling Sherlock half on top of his chest, knowing Sherlock feels safest like this.
He takes a deep breath to calm down, and, without really thinking, goes to the bathroom to switch of the light that’s been left on. And there, he discovers what is clearly the scene of the crime. The tub his half full of used bathwater with remnants of foam floating on the surface, and a substantial amount has evidently been splashed on the floor and perfunctorily mopped up with a sodden bathmat.
for me.”
Maybe he tensed, because John stilled and stopped kissing him.
And who is he even trying to kid? It has to be him. It’s his job. Whatever Sherlock’s… feelings for him may be, John’s supposed to be his best friend. Best friends don’t leave each other alone when they’re heartbroken and miserable. (Sherlock didn’t, did he? He was there for John even when his face still bore the marks of John’s fists.) John doesn’t
There’s a brief twinge of panic when Florian squeezes his buttocks.
“It’s—all of it, really,” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes and focused on John’s warm, solid body against his, rather than on what he was saying, letting it pour out. “There’s so many sensations and – and I have to think about everything and it all becomes too much.”
He finds Sherlock curled up on the sofa, asleep.
“Your therapist,” Sherlock breathes – clearly a part of his brain is still functional, still putting things together.
Trying to tether himself to something familiar, Sherlock lets his knees bend, ready to fall down on them and do what he knows, but John doesn’t let him. He cups Sherlock’s elbows, keeping him standing.
“God, we’ve really got a long way to go, don’t we,” John murmurs, shaking his head mournfully. He’s right, there are so many things they have to address and resolve and work through, and the path to anything approaching a happy, stable relationship seems winding and endless… but they’re on it together.
being happy, back before the fall, when he and John lived together and solved cases and chased criminals and ate takeaway and laughed and there was never an ounce of cruelty in John’s eyes when he looked him, but that’s in the past, ruined forever, and he can’t
“Shh,” John whispered to him. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.” He kissed Sherlock’s eyelids lightly and pulled him into a loose hug. Carefully, he arranged them into the position they started in, John on his back with Sherlock partly on top of him, and Sherlock felt immediately better simply because this way he was in John’s arms and he could hear and feel John’s heartbeat.
Sherlock nods, sluggishly pushing himself closer to John.
“Shut up, for once,” John slurs, and then he makes sure Sherlock does exactly that by plunging his tongue deep into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock is kissing back before he knows it, everything he learned with Janine and then deleted coming back to him, and he’s helpless, he’s physically unable not to try to give John he wants, because John is everything, everything, and Sherlock doesn’t have the strength to resist.
He fidgeted a little as he waited, trying not worry needlessly. It would be all right. John would guide him. He could trust John.
“Stop,” Sherlock says quietly but firmly, and John obeys immediately. His chest heaves as he looks up at Sherlock, his stormy blue eyes swimming in tears. “You don’t get to decide that, and you don’t get to use me as your personal source of punishment. Don’t you see? That’s precisely what I did, and look how well it worked out.” He steps a little closer, close enough that John has to tilt his head back to look at him. “I’ve forgiven you. That doesn’t mean I think what you did to me wasn’t terrible, or that it’s okay, or that we can pretend it never happened. It just means that I see the sincerity of your regret and I don’t want us to live the rest of our lives weighed down by resentment and guilt. I forgive you; now you need to forgive yourself.”
Florian watches Sherlock carefully and Sherlock ducks his head, simultaneously wanting to hide and desperate not to be left alone. Florian shifts a little and opens his arms.
John blushed but allowed himself to be pulled from the room, noticing as he left the smiles all round, and noticing the gentle pat that Mycroft laid on his brother’s shoulders as they passed by.
Sherlock felt a mixture of surprise, shock and also a little sadness as he saw John play acting the love scene in front of him. A scene he would never get to share. Should he leave the room?  Looking over at John, his hot sweaty skin gleamed in the streaks of daylight that were now pouring through the curtains, Sherlock sighed.
"John. I am an expert in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and am well known for my code-breaking expertise. That, and the fact that I am also gay, means that Mr Turing and I have a great deal in common."
“Come in son, welcome. Yes, don’t know what all the fuss is about – erm, we’ll be in the lounge, you two probably want to say hello” John’s father smiled, a smile that touched his eyes.
“Sherlock! John! it has been too long” Angelo somehow managed to pull them both together into a tight embrace, John’s nose and mouth shoved against the hard wall of Sherlocks torso as they were squeezed together and praised as being Angelo’s most special customers. After a few seconds, they were released, John gasping for air, blushing furiously.
“Hello love, you must be John’s friend, welcome, he’s just coming!”
"Oh, Sherlock. You're gorgeous… tell me… do you want my mouth? Or hands?"
In the early hours of the next morning the two men lay together, ragged and sweaty. The heat from their bodies cooling in the night air. They had kissed, touched each other, and whispered words and thoughts that should have been shared months ago, realizing that they had felt the same for each other for so long, vowing to talk more in the future. For now, they needed no more. The physical attraction was almost painful, once they had gotten this far, but the need to just be in each other’s arms, tasting each other, and falling asleep knowing that tomorrow was indeed going to be a very special day, the first day of being this close. But unlike the Celestial bodies above, John and Sherlock knew that they had found their correct orbit and wouldn’t be distancing themselves again. John still wasn’t sure whether he believed in dream interpretation, but he certainly now believed in a little bit of magic.
birthday. He knew this would entail relatives he hardly knew, but his sister would be there. Well in body. Depended how sober she was as to how much she would be present in the psychological sense.
“Mycroft, will you take her through to the drawing room?” John said as he took her coat and hat from her. “I just want a quick word with Sherlock.”
Sherlock pressed more water to John’s lips, and then went to the bathroom, returning with a cool damp flannel, wiping across John’s fevered face.  John was wearing only his boxers, and a thin sheet, an attempt to help control his surging fever. Sherlock tried to avert his gaze from John’s body as he tended lovingly to his needs. He realised now, as he wiped John’s brow, that John was really stunningly beautiful. His gorgeous eyes, that opened intermittently, were unfocussed in delirium but still lovely. He took in the strong line of John’s jaw, the juncture where it met his neck, before his gaze moved down to John’s chest. The beads of sweat from the fever, caught in the hair there, glistening like dew drops in the early morning sun. The ragged breaths, the rise and fall of his chest caused Sherlock to inhale sharply as his love surged forward before he was able to capture it and push it back in again. He forced himself to look away, wouldn’t allow himself to look further. It felt like a breach of privacy, after all John was not really ‘here’. Sherlock had no right to steal personal looks and was sure that John would be mortified if he found out that Sherlock had looked at him like that, examining closely each and every curve, each muscle, sinew, tendon, every inch of skin.
John had felt confused for some time after this occurrence, and then his mind drifted back to the words on the page of the dream analysis book he had picked up at the bookstore. It had stated that dreams where the shining sun, sunlight, or warmth was centre stage, represented an individual who was looking for sojourn, comfort, and that to feel the sun around him was his minds way of saying that something or someone close at hand was enveloping him in the safety and love that he craved. Seeing Sherlock in front of him, part and parcel of the sun had made him shake his head a little in disbelief. “Is that how he saw Sherlock, his protector? His comfort? His life? "
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to John’s face.
Of course, there were good times. Fleeting touches as they passed each other, the fits of giggles that accompanied the hit of adrenalin a solved case brought forth. The occasional meal out, where they stuttered over any embarrassing silences. They slowly fell back into cosy domesticity. Sherlock loved the closeness and peace his best friend brought to Baker Street.
The assistant observed and smiled. “You, sir, are a good soul. You have seen pain. But in you I see potential and much happiness but you must open the door. In fact, this is a great time to do it, with the solstice almost upon us.” The assistant went on to explain about the summer solstice, about the longest day and the shortest night. She told John that during the solstice, the universe, the sun, the earth was so powerful, and at that time, the sun and the earth were closest both in the physical / astrophysical sense as well as in the spiritual sense. It was time to celebrate.
"I think I would wait for hell to freeze over before he made a move on me. And, well… I suppose I just haven't been brave enough."
It sort of made sense… in a mad way.  Of course!  He relaxed, then smiled. He leaned down, smoothing the hair from Johns faced, rubbing his thumb across John’s jaw. John leaned into his touch, “I love you too, John.”
“He loves her. He pretends to be this fusty middle-aged man, but he can’t fool me, he has a soft spot in there somewhere.”
"Oh my
“Shh, John, relax, you are not well and you need to get better, just sleep.” Sherlock spoke calmly and clearly even though John’s words had made him shiver slightly. What was he dreaming about? Who was he imagining? Was it that red-headed cat loving vegan? The short, dainty nurse who had draped herself over him every time they were together?
“Come on through, come on through.” Charlie and Sophie, aged five and seven respectively, were a little shy but Martha Hudson held out her hands.
. I said no. You asked me if I had a
John wanted to talk, but he was just stuck; star struck, his sun, had frozen him to the spot. At that thought John just burst out giggling… frozen by the sun? Jeez what was happening to him. He looked up to Sherlock and smiled. “Sherlock, I’m fine, but, but I need to talk to you. I need to tell you something”.
Sherlock reached up, his hands shaking gently.
The door was swung open before the bell had time to sound. Mycroft had obviously been waiting for them too. A blast of frigid air reached Sherlock from his vantage point at the top of the stairs. John walked in, looking up, grinning. “Hey Sherlock… Sorry we are a bit late, traffic and ice, ya know. Took it easy, wanted to be extra careful with this cargo!” He placed the wriggling 18-month-old down on the floor by Mycroft, she looked up at him, grinning a toothy grin.
"Suck me," he murmured.
As he glanced to his left, he noticed the small spider spinning her web. Of course, he knew the science. But, looking at the fragile thing now, suspended in the corner, it was a thing of beauty. He caught his breath as he watched her creating a unique piece of work that would be demolished as soon as the cleaner spotted it on Boxing Day. He felt sorry for her. Sitting quietly making her web, trying to stay out of the way, but still managing to provoke such extreme reactions in anyone who should see her. Hmmm, he knew that feeling well.
Sherlock stood at the bottom of the stairs, waiting for Rosie to see him. “Sh’lock, Sh’lock!” she screamed… Where is Father chrintmas?”
John sat back in his armchair, considering the instructions. Sherlock had left little direction as to the nature of the costume - so John could only presume it was 'anything goes'.
John had revisited the bookshop, wanting to read more, he was intrigued by dream interpretation. He felt that there had to be more, there had to be something tangible, some explainable tether connecting him to Sherlock. He leafed through various books concentrating hard. And then he was aware that the sales assistant was asking him a question.
Sherlock’s expression dared John to disagree - but John simply stared, astonished by Sherlock’s sudden declaration.
Johns dad reached around John, Hi Sherlock, you must be John’s boyfriend, welcome.
, and the cherry on the cake when John got into Bart’s medical school, was a day of his mum and dad phoning everyone they had ever known, bragging about their perfect son becoming a doctor. There just never seemed the right moment to burst their bubble.
When John had come home from the surgery last night, Sherlock knew he was ill. His white face was drawn and gaunt. Not enough food and water breaks along with lengthy hours left him little reserve to fight the virus which was now taking its toll. The advice given out by the Department of Health was to stay home if symptomatic, to not visit the doctor or go to hospital unless acutely ill. The hospitals had no room. People had been instructed to maintain hydration at all costs. Treat fever with paracetamol.  But that was all. John would stay home, and Sherlock would take care of him.
“Yes, like that that, it feels nice.” The words, now as clear as day, reverberated around the room, but as Sherlock lent forward to look at Johns face, he realised that whilst John appeared to be awake, he was definitely still delirious.
"At ease, Sherlock..." he murmured, turning to the driver he dug out his wallet. He thanked the man for waiting and passed him a bundle of notes.
But today was about one thing, he was introducing his parents to his friend. John laughed. Friend… hmmm, he had gone over and over the conversation in his head. How best to tell them- “Hi mum, dad, I forgot to tell you, I’m gay and have had a steady boyfriend for 3years now. I love him to bits.” Or maybe when his mum asked about a
“Are you celebrating the summer solstice? “
Mycroft couldn’t keep the smile of his face as the young child hugged his leg. John shook his hand, “Happy Christmas Mycroft, thank you for inviting us.”
Sherlock smirked indulgently as they were both seated in their regular seats by the window. Angelo bustled over, uncorking a bottle of Pinot noir telling them that of course the wine was on the house, and they were just to give a nod when ready to order their meal.
His hands smoothed over the fabric, rough and hard wearing, but also comforting, as his mind wandered back to Afghanistan. Bullets flying; the sounds of catastrophic destruction, invading every part of his being. And the pain – oh God, the pain. It had been bad. Not straight away - adrenalin had taken care of that - but when the infection and subsequent sepsis had set in, there had been almost nothing but pain.
“John, it’s ok. You feel cold because you have a fever, your hypothalamus is sending messages out to your body that you are cold, that’s why you are shivering. You are in fact, really hot, and you will feel better when your fever breaks.”
When the shit hit the fan, when Mary was killed and John had hit rock bottom, he had been there for him. His own heart was breaking, not because of the loss of ‘her’ but because John was struggling. John was grieving.  John was in pain, therefore so was he. To the outside world, he, Sherlock Holmes was cold, aloof, uncaring, and he didn’t give a damn how they saw him. He knew that his heart, in fact his whole universe was dedicated to loving the man, he would never be able to call his, but who he could look after and cherish, if only from afar.
I was 16, but maybe before that. I’m so sorry.
John? His dad said. You waited till today, till you decided to tell us? When did you know?
He turned slightly to examine his profile. His arse looked good in these. They were a bit tight, and hugged his thighs and arse rather closely. But it was definitely in a good way.
you going on about? You asked me if I had a
One last kiss to his parents and he floated out of the room. Never, ever had he envisioned this scenario.
"Well, what are you waiting for, man? Undo my trousers and suck my cock."
As he trained his ears to the drawing room, he heard her voice reciting that poem, the poem only ever told at Christmas time… Tears prickled the back of his eyes as he listened, as it brought back memories of his childhood.
John laughed as this was his plan since Mrs Hudson had come up with her idea. Tonight, he would tell Sherlock how he felt. After, all tomorrow was the solstice, He didn’t know much about it but presumed that somehow midnight to midnight was ‘the magic time’. He chuckled quietly to himself not certain why he had developed a sudden interest in the supernatural, or, well whatever it was.
Sherlock hugged John, before pressing his mouth in over John’s lips. The kiss sensual, beautiful warm and full of promise. “Hello you, boyfriend! Come on, let’s go meet your parents properly. I have a small gift for them. You must wait for yours. Sherlock winked, held out his arm and followed John into the lounge.
They had lounged one night in their respective armchairs, each nursing a glass of Taliska. The single malt had been a thank you gift from the distillers on the Isle of Skye after a case of embezzlement had been solved in hours by Sherlock. The Bottle had been forgotten at the back of a cupboard during the bad times, but had been unearthed recently when Sherlock was searching for a lost set of pipettes. The Malt was fine, an odd aroma really, reminiscent of the seaside, all seaweed, fresh and salty, but the taste, mmm the taste, a luxurious mix of smoke and pepper with an aftertaste of fine malt barley. The whiskey soon released their tongues, allowing words both happy and sad to pour from them, each taking it in turn to purge their souls of some of the things that had remained unsaid. The warmth and anaesthetic properties of the alcohol taking the edge off the situation.
John looked down at the man he'd loved for so long - laying by his knees; pale, creamy legs going on forever; the thatch of thick curly black hair hiding the root of the most beautiful cock John had ever seen.
John’s heart flipped. He knew at once what Sherlock was trying to tell him. Sherlock’s eyes softened as the atmosphere started to crackle.
"Sherlock…" John managed. "Are you... saying that you're attracted to me?"
"Come on," he said. "Help get me out of these fatigues... shower with me... then let me take you to bed."
"Harder - Sherlock -
"Who is he then, Sherlock?" he asked. "Why haven’t you made a move on him? Why hasn't
This time John couldn’t hold in his laughter, he laughed merrily. “Come on, Sherlock, spit it out! Not like you to be tongue twisted!”
John’s heart raced, maybe this was the one thing… John took a deep breath, “I really hope that, mum, dad, but, there is something I haven’t told you. I don’t want you to hate me! John suddenly felt tears stinging his eyes.
Sherlock hugged him close. “John, I missed you last night, I really couldn’t believe the summons by mother and father, but they wanted to get all their legal stuff done before Christmas, and the Solicitor just happened to be ‘dropping by’.”
Mycroft turned, raising an eyebrow but deciding not to comment on John’s request.  John smiled as Mycroft hurried his daughter through to see his parents.
, I’m gonna come - ... take me out of your mouth - "
"On your feet, man," John said. "Come here. Take that coat off."
Angelo breezed over lighting the obligatory ‘romantic’ candle and depositing a bread basket, a dish of the finest olive oil and a bowl of olives before taking John’s order of
Sherlock looked at John surreptitiously checking for signs of concussion.
John and Sherlock snuggled on the luxurious sofa, hand in hand, whispering plans for their ears only. Clara sat in Harry’s lap, smiling at her good fortune, not daring to imagine how different things could have turned out. And Mycroft – Mycroft and Greg – well, at first they sat in arm chairs either side of the roaring fire, and as the day became evening and became night, their chairs had moved closer. They flirted gently, but no one in the room was foolish enough not to feel the sexual tension in the air.
Sherlock smiled at her unselfconscious attempt at the word ‘Christmas.’  He knew John had been teaching her every day, and her speech was coming along well - with some interesting words thrown in for good measure.
“Wow, time flies when having fun John said” as he silently tried to message his desire to leave now to Sherlock. He knew that Angelo would happily talk well into the night if they didn’t take their leave.”
“When will your friend get here John?” His dad asked breathlessly in-between puffs into a long yellow banana shaped balloon. “He’ll be here at 11. He would have come over with me yesterday but... well I wanted to chat with you lone first.” John looked at his parents for any sign that they looked upset, but they just looked intrigued…
For a moment Sherlock looked confused, he had certainly picked up earlier that John had something on his mind, but that feeling had passed with the easiness of the night. “John what is it? Are you ok? Please tell me”
Alan Turing?"
Christmas! As a child, he had seen pictures in books, adverts and bits of films on the television (not that the watching of television was encouraged of course) where families would get together, sing, and laugh, hug and kiss. In those films, there were always decorations hung on every surface, garish and bright, but beautiful nonetheless. A tree would always take centre stage, dressed in gaudy baubles and draped with sparkling foil tinsel. The trees would be surrounded with bright gifts, wrapped with as much ribbon as care. The gifts would be surprises, not always good surprises, but surprises nonetheless.
"Okay, well… yeah, genius…. I can see all the similarities." John was still a little unimpressed, if truth be told.
“Thank you, Molly,” he says quietly, watching the elephants with single-minded attention. “You’re a good friend.”
“Oh well,” Sam shrugs with a smile, “it was worth a try.”
Robert startled and blushed and looked at the floor. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable,” he said, clearly misunderstanding Sherlock’s – admittedly idiotic – remark.
“And I assume no one calls you The Woman anymore, either,” he retorts, and he’s pleased to note his voice sounds passably cool, like he doesn’t care at all that he’s having brunch with a dominatrix while sporting a hickey. He doesn’t think he fools her, however.
After he gets back to the flat he’ll take Jack for a nice long walk, and then he thinks he’ll take time to indulge with his new toy. Tomorrow morning he’ll go with Mrs Hudson to the shops – it’s tedious and annoying and exhausting, but she appreciates it so much and will bake anything he wants afterwards, so it’s worth it. And in the afternoon, he’ll meet John for their first joint therapy session, the first step on the long journey they’re about to take together, terrifying and empowering at the same time. This, too, will be hard but worth it. He’s certain of it.
“And clearly,” Irene continues with a pointed look at Sherlock’s collar, “it’s the latter. I must say I’m pleasantly surprised; when Dr Watson got married, I was beginning to fear he’d never come to terms with his feelings for you.”
Sherlock cleared his throat awkwardly. “I think you should take me to bed, John,” he said, and
John glanced at him and then chuckled, some of the tension seeping out of him. Sherlock gave him a wry smile.
were phenomenal,” John counters, as if lying on his back and letting himself be driven out of his mind with pleasure required some sort of special skill or effort from Sherlock.

“John,” Sherlock blinks as if he isn’t quite sure John’s there, and his voice is utterly dull. John’s worry increases exponentially. He steps closer.
“I can’t give you what you need.” The words were like a grater in Sherlock’s throat.
John fumbles a little with his belt as Sherlock’s heated gaze sweeps over him hungrily, unabashed in his appreciation of John’s body. Lust courses through John’s veins with renewed force.
“You look good. I mean – not that you don’t usually – I just – I mean you look healthy. Better than the last time I saw you,” Molly stammers, blushing a little. She looks at him inquisitively, clearly willing him to tell her more about how he spent the last six weeks.
“Did you see a client like that?” It wouldn’t be the first time Sherlock didn’t think getting dressed was necessary, but still. Sherlock’s level of personal grooming is often indicative of his state of mind. He’s clearly just had shower, but he doesn’t seem to have bothered to put on anything more than the dressing gown.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John said gently and spooned up behind himself, putting an arm around Sherlock’s waist. “You’re gorgeous, love. You don’t need to hide from me.” He peppered kisses the back of Sherlock’s neck and stroked his stomach, and as he shifted Sherlock felt his erection press against his arse. What was he doing? John wanted to fuck him, and instead of letting him do that Sherlock was panicking about his looks. Preposterous. He took a calming breath and turned in John’s embrace to face him.
“Hi, sorry. Yeah, end of term exams are fast approaching,  got to… you know. Study.” He ran a hand over the back of his head, nervous energy stealing his confidence again. “I don't know your name,” he said aloud, regretting it instantly.
John sniffed for no reason at all and shrugged, still flicking through designs.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied immediately, not taking his eyes from John’s. Something about his intense stare made the collar around John's neck feel a little too tight but he resisted the urge to loosen it. Instead, he settled for clearing his throat and shifting in his seat.
“Nothing of importance.”
,” he warned, and lips were replaced with strong fingers, stroking faster and faster until white hot pleasure surged through John’s body. His moans were muffled by Sherlock’s insistent mouth on his own and John gripped Sherlock’s hand tight and rocked his hips as the last traces of his orgasm ran down his stomach. He opened his eyes as the kiss turned gentle, finding the other man inches from his face and smiling, slowly pressing feather-light kisses onto his cheeks.
“I have something to tell you,” Sherlock murmured, and John’s heavy breathing stopped him answering straight away.
John pulled the head of dark curls away from his shoulder and saw watery eyes looking down at him.
“No one could ever make you do anything, John,” I say softly, not wanting an argument only because it is too hard to bear him hating me.
So on the following Wednesday afternoon, John decided he would go back to the library under the pretense that he needed more books. He took work with him, aiming to actually get some of it done, but knew his mind would be elsewhere.
“Sherlock! That
The stranger's mouth twitched, first hint of a smile, but it went no further than that. John found himself disappointed. Blue eyes swept over John's frame and he felt exposed for reasons he couldn't describe.
a boy! John, why didn't you tell me!” John groaned.
“I don't know, maybe you weren't looking hard enough,” Sherlock told him, leaning forward and laughing a little.
“Um, Sherlock… there are some things I wanted to talk to you about, actually.” John rubbed his eye and drummed a finger lightly on the worktop.
John stared with what looked like disbelief, earning a frown from the man who was still holding his hand with a light touch. "Angelo's? You are joking?" John asked, dropping his new found soulmate's hand and leaning back against his workspace. His eyes searched Sherlock's confused expression, but found no signs of amusement.
“You haven’t been to the library this week.”
with a Chemistry student. He pushed what would surely be an awkward conversation from his mind and instead focused on the test tubes Sherlock was fiddling with.
It wasn’t long before he felt a presence beside him.
“I know.”
I don’t allow myself to think too much about it and instead touch my glass to my lips, tipping amber liquid down my throat just to taste its familiar burn. The ache reminds me painfully of the same ache in my chest, the one that has lingered there since I watched the only person I’ve ever wanted to stay in my life do the opposite.
“Don’t care, I’ll go down with you,” Sherlock mumbled, nuzzling his face into John’s neck and pulling him closer.
“Martha, for god’s sake. I'm just a bit spaced out, alright?” His half-truth didn’t have time to earn a response as at that exact moment his phone glowed and vibrated on his desk. Martha grabbed the device, her eyes going wide and then meeting John's.
“Give my love to Mary,” I whisper, and swallow my guilt and my sadness as his face falls into shadow and he returns the gentle nod I have given him all night. Those lips that are so difficult to ignore press together and open, as if to say something more, then close again and fade into darkness, along with the one person I want more than anything to stay.
After a minute or so had passed John crept across the corridors, heading for the now empty medical classrooms. He found the first aid room and tapped on the door, warning Sherlock it was him. He entered and his breath hitched at the sight that was waiting for him.
“You’re a twit, you know that? A soppy twit.”
“I think she could even make a good detective,” John continued, “keen eye for detail and all that.” John knew his blasé explanation of detective work as needing only a 'keen eye for detail and all that' had riled Sherlock and also had a feeling his complimenting Molly had wound him up too. Sherlock flashed a look John hadn't seen before in his direction, some irritation behind his eyes. He didn't say anything, just watched John, who smiled.
“What are you talking about? I'm fine,” John yelped, giving her a disdainful look.
His heart skipped at least two beats as he told himself firmly not to be stupid. The name inscribed on his own skin was not Sherlock and there was no point hoping the name he had just read on the charming man's wrist was referring to a John
"John."
“Thank you, John,” a muttered and unemotional response.
“But I don’t care who sees,” Sherlock whimpered desperately, “I want you now.” Strong hands traced John’s sides and tugged at his shirt, eager to touch what was underneath, but John grabbed Sherlock’s wrists and forced them onto the worktop either side of him. The taller man fell backwards and gasped a little.
John's mind was thoroughly blank as Sherlock's soft lips moved against his own, gentle yet insistent. He reached forward, running fingers through soft curls, but was pulled straight back to reality as Sherlock drew back, bright eyes scanning his face for a reaction. John tried to catch his breath, think of something to say – anything—but found he couldn't utter a syllable. Instead, Sherlock dropped his gaze to the table, finished his coffee in one gulp, and picked up his coat from the chair.
The attendant hummed, thinking, and John realised he liked that puzzled expression on his face. He liked the way the man's lips parted and his eyes flicked from point-to-point, searching for information and analysing it. His thoughts were disturbed by a heavy book being pressed into his hands, cool fingers brushing his own.
“Well, this man can,” John said quietly before pulling Sherlock into a soft kiss, warm and comforting and full of love; the type they both dreamed of when away from each other.
“Oh shit, sorry. It was my room-mate, Greg, he was being-”
will be just as appalling as the rest of them.”
about to happen?”
“Hello, John,” he said and John remembered how much he loved that voice. His mind drifted back to when Sherlock had been reading to children in the library and a familiar warmth filled his chest.
“I was observing you.”
He blinked, clearing his head and looked up at Sherlock who was definitely a few inches closer than before. John's breath hitched and he hoped Sherlock hadn’t noticed. With such a short distance between them he could now see all the shades of blue and grey in Sherlock's eyes and feel warm breath tickling his face. It was impossible to resist dropping his eyes to the man's rosy lips for a fraction of a second. Immediately John regretted it as an overwhelming urge to kiss them threatened to push him into acting on it. Except he didn't need to act on anything as Sherlock himself leaned further over the small table, careful to avoid the drinks, and closed the gap between them.
“You know what it means, John.” My voice is measured and words are picked with care, loaded like the gun in the top drawer of his bed side table. He still keeps it there; she doesn’t like it.
“The tilt of your collar, the collections of wool on your jumper - mostly at the sleeves. Small bobbles show you’ve been picking at it." John swallows hard but I continue. "The clumsy way you have fastened your buttons are indic-”
A week passed without word from Sherlock and John had been too busy to go back to the library to talk with him. Yet, the memory of the date and the kiss that had ended it were at the forefront of his mind and consequently he spent every lecture staring into space, remembering how Sherlock's lips had felt against his own.
then I'm sure that's the truth, but unfortunately it doesn't and you're lying.” Her hazel eyes pinned him to the spot and he groaned.
“First time for everything,” Sherlock muttered before closing his lips around the head, earning a heavy sigh from John. He tried his hardest not to choke the beautiful man in front of him and focused hard on not coming right that second. A hot tongue swirled around the underside of his cock while hands caressed the rest of him, fingers pinching nipples too. It was incredible, made better by the warmth in his chest that he only got when with Sherlock.
“Oh," Sherlock hesitated. “Yes. That’s me, but I didn’t order any flowers.”
He threw his head back and moaned Sherlock’s name, rocking gently into his mouth as dark curls bobbed up and down in his lap. He laced his fingers into the thick hair and used his other hand to grasp Sherlock’s long fingers in his own; something that felt way too intimate but also right. His body tensed as Sherlock looked up at him through long lashes, blue eyes piercing his own, and when his tongue flicked the tip of his cock lightly, John knew he was close.
was a date.
"Deductions... that's a pretty impressive skill, you know. Surely you can't tell everything about a person but what’s the weirdest thing you’ve deduced? I bet you could embarrass so many people."
John wondered if this was the first time Sherlock had received a blowjob, or if he was just really overwhelmed, but gently took the erection back into his mouth and pressed his tongue against the wet tip, taking the length further and further in as he breathed through his nose. He heard his name being muttered over and over again, a hand finding its way into his hair and gently forcing him down further. The sound of his name in Sherlock’s deep voice had his body thrumming and working harder on Sherlock’s cock, and so he licked from base to tip, swirling his tongue and using his hands to stroke where his mouth wouldn’t reach.
“Well… I need a book.”
. Now give me my phone.” John hissed and reached for it, more than eager to read what Sherlock had sent.
“Right,” John murmured. And then it was silent, the air full of things not discussed, and the same tension that had occurred before their kiss the other day returned and John’s steady heartbeat began to quicken.
"No?"
,” he hissed, looking up to see not blue eyes but dark curls. Sherlock had twisted his head and shoved his face into the pillow.
. I swallow down a smile and ignore the tingle high on my cheeks. This isn’t allowed. It’s not John - this is whiskey and two shots of vodka and too much red wine from Mrs Hudson’s kitchen cupboard.
The energy sparked and spluttered around them, arcing from limb to limb, tongue to tongue, and where ever the men laid their hands. It was as though they were making out in a Faraday cage, but alongside that wild energy, a cool calm presence flowed around the men, tempering the heat, reeling in the energy, keeping them grounded and present.
“I love it when we sleep like this, you make me feel so safe, the way you press your back into my chest, the way your hair tickles my neck. I love your curls” John continued.
John suddenly realized that Sherlock’s mind had returned to the present, and now he was being observed in return. They both blushed, the tips of Johns ears turning pink, and Sherlocks neck reddening as they had both been caught in the act so to speak. Then they both laughed. The laughter breaking the tension before it had time to establish and nothing more was said.
“My cloc,” she stuttered.
He then turned to Sherlock.
got better. John had moved back in. “To be nearer the action Sherlock”, “To save on rent, Sherlock” – whatever the reasons, Sherlock just cared that John had come home,
As John shut the door of his flat, a black cab pulled up to the curb. The door opened to reveal a well-dressed young man, his dark hair slicked and parted, a jumper just visible under the suit jacket.
“John ...”
“Oh God, Sherlock, yes, yes of course. Oh, I don’t know what to say. I really didn’t see this coming.” Tears sprang to the corners of John’s eyes.
The woman smiled a smile that touched her eyes and seemed to emanate from her heart. “I know what you mean, it isn’t silly you know. It seems you have found a friend that is so special. It seems you have found your soul mate. He is your sun, a star with huge power and unless I am mistaken, you will find that you are his earth. – You temper his spontaneity, his fire, you keep him grounded. Sun is a symbol of life itself with its heat and light. It is also a celestial body that for millennia has stood for knowledge and authority. To see sun in your dreams is to acknowledge the authority and power of this celestial body. You are looking for guidance and help which is why you see sun in your dreams. “
Christmas Day was one like no other the house or its occupants had ever known.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
The order left no room for disobedience.
Showering quickly. He was just pulling his second sock on when the doorbell went.
"Right… well, what’s he like? You're my best friend, Sherlock. I won’t have anyone messing you around."
John was like earth to him. John was dependable, solid, and sturdy. Not just in his physicality but by nature too. Of course, at times, he would explode, and just as an earthquake rips the ground apart, John would shout and stomp when his feelings became too intense to bare, but afterwards, calm would again ensue. It was a balance between them, each making the other whole.  He recalled the recent event, when he himself had been so angry, when Lestrade and his men had messed a case up. The criminal, a serial robber getting away on a technicality. Anger and heat had surged through his veins, he had been at the point of a super nova meltdown, spluttering his disdain of the police force, swiping the coffee table clear of its contents. Then he had become aware of John’s presence. John standing in the kitchen, his back to the room facing the window, the rain pouring outside, hammering on the windows leaving rivulets of water gushing from top to bottom of the pane. John stood, compact, feet planted solidly on the ground as though at one with nature outside. John lost in his thoughts or maybe, ignoring Sherlock’s tantrum, had emanated a cool tranquil energy, waves of calm drifting from his body across the space to Sherlock. The anger within Sherlock had been immediately doused by the beauty and serenity emanating from John, his John. His earth. His world.
They had discussed Mary of course, the fake suicide, Afghanistan, and so much more in those hours, at times the air had rippled with energy, at other times despair, but they pushed on, exploring the limits of how much they could let go of. And finally, they had succumbed to the effects of the Malt and the late hour falling asleep in the company of each other. It had been cathartic, and the following days had been lighter in many ways. They had stopped walking on eggshells regarding the taboo subjects, allowing mention of same, to pass through conversation easily if, or when they were broached. They could chat more easily about Rosie, discussing aspects of parenting, about the practicalities of life, shopping, laundry and other tedious matters. The one thing that was never spoken about was themselves. ‘They’ as in ‘them’ as in ‘the two of them’ as in ‘what the hell were they to each other’. Many times, John had caught himself looking at Sherlock, and he knew in his heart that he loved him deeply. He didn’t understand that love. He felt it was something that could never be verbalised. But he knew that Sherlock was his sun, his very own shining star, the light in his very core, without which he would cease to be, would wither and die.
Suddenly his ears tuned into the sound of tires on gravel and he leapt up to standing. He stood stock still, once again holding his breath as he waited for the doorbell to chime.
"Well... thanks, Sherlock. I must admit it’s a bit snug. I was worried it wouldn’t fit, but well… here I am."
Greg Lestrade had also been invited. Sherlock had almost fallen over laughing when Greg had come in to NSY not long after the Holmes family had made the invitation. Greg had explained to Sherlock that his ex had been awarded some tickets for a cruise over Christmas as part of a prize draw, a draw she hadn’t even remembered entering. She had never let him see the children on Christmas Day but it seemed that, as the cruise was only available for her and her new partner and the dates were not transferable, the children would simply have to come to him. “What extraordinary luck,” Sherlock had muttered. Then as Mycroft walked through the door right into the middle of this exchange on pretence of business, it was an obvious conclusion that Greg must, absolutely must bring the children to Christmas at his parents’. Smooth, Mycroft, Sherlock thought. Best few thousand you have spent in a long time. Mycroft had smiled serenely at Sherlock, the glint in his eye bringing an unexpected lump to Sherlock’s throat. And so it was: Greg was thrilled beyond anything not only to have Christmas with his children, but to be able to have them share in a real family Christmas, and a chance to get to know Mycroft better too. He was a happy man indeed.
, and Sherlock’s order of
"God," John said, "no!
Sherlock blinked rapidly, realising that he had gone for a trip down memory lane whilst John had been removing his coat and gloves, and was now standing, waiting patiently.
Sherlock snorted. “You are deluded, John Watson.  Mycroft? A soft spot? Hah….”
John drew back, his heart plunging into the depths, John tried to step back, to run, to hide. “Oh this had been such a mistake.”
As the last strains of the music dissolved into silence, he huffed out the breath he hadn’t been aware he had been holding. Old habits die hard and all that. To make a mistake whilst playing, even in practice, would bring criticism and frustration from their parents. He sighed in relief, then smiled inwardly.
Once again John could say nothing, he just didn’t know how. For so long his feelings had been a kaleidoscopic cacophony of emotions. A blur that he could never quite hold onto for long enough to sort out, what if he was wrong, what if his confession sent Sherlock running for the hills. What if Sherlock was happy with the situation but John realized that he needed more. He was terrified of ruining the only real love apart from Rosie that he had ever experienced.
"Sorry… needs must," he said - and caught Sherlock erection in his fist.
Time stuttered as Sherlock and John found the wonder of each other’s tongues, teeth, and lips. Sucking gently and, not so gently at each other’s mouths. Hands moving restlessly over clothes, bodies pressed close, competing to get a better hold on each other.
He nodded slowly.
John was bathed in heat, the radiance engulfed his very being, wakening his nerve endings, sending shocks of ecstasy deep into his core. He felt as though he were being wrapped in a cocoon of secure warmth with an extra side of … hmm… hot.
made a move on you?"
They lie facing each other, and John puts his hand in Sherlock’s hair the way Sherlock likes, his touch feather-light.
. He was safe and loved and he could rest now.
“I want…”
John is drunk, which was only to be expected, considering how hard Mary’s death was for him.
“Shopping!?” Sherlock would rather listen to one of Molly’s rambling monologues about her cat.
here. This is not a transaction. Nothing you don’t like even enters the picture. So, let’s see if I’ve got this right: you need me to take control because it gives you something to focus on, right? But you don’t want any of the other BDSM stuff.”
“It’s only natural that you’d assume the role you’re used to,” Sherlock pointed out. “I don’t mind.”
Sherlock nods, unable to look away from John’s eyes now. His lovely, kind John – of course he doesn’t want to do anything that would hurt Sherlock. But it’s impossible – in Sherlock’s experience –it’s foolish to expect someone to exercise control without at the very least verbally degrading the person in their power, without at least some rough treatment. The knowledge that John wants to try is enough, though, even if it can’t work. He wants to be claimed,
Sherlock nodded – he had sort of already known that, in theory, but he tried to etch John’s words to his memory along with the sincere look in his eyes nevertheless, hoping he would be able to remember it in the moment… if there actually was going to be a next time.
Not even in one of his Victorian fantasies. Which leaves only one option.
it would be all right if I only managed to get through it the first time, it would be fine after that, I’m sure of it,
He’ll just have to try hard to make it worthwhile.
He got the lube and spread it on John himself – he actually enjoyed that, letting John’s cock slide between his fingers, listening to John’s sighs, but there was no time to dwell on it now. His heart was hammering and it felt like the weight of his need not to disappoint John was going to crush him. He needed to get this over with.
“Sherlock,” John slurred, reaching for Sherlock’s head and pulling him into a kiss. “That was amazing. You’re amazing.”
.” John’s thrusts turn faster, Sherlock grinds down harder, and then John groans and stills, his release spilling inside Sherlock.
“Good night,” Sherlock says after him quietly. He shifts into the space John has just vacated, and curls in on himself, alone.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No need.” The last thing he needs is for them to accidentally bump into each other as they cook. He tries not to look at John and concentrate instead on not burning anything. He can feel the nervous energy radiating from John.
Emboldened, Sherlock shifted to put his lips to John’s nipples instead. He licked at the little nub, feeling it harden, and it was
He hesitated several seconds further, he wondered how he should exit the bathroom. Naked? Underwear? Towel around the hips? Surely it would be a waste of time to get dressed. In the end, he opted for the clean pair of pants he’d laid out and his favourite blue dressing gown. Probably more modest than necessary, but there was nothing for it: he was, quite literally, a blushing virgin, and there was no need to make himself feel exposed for longer than he had to
Sherlock tensed. Yes, of course. Why didn’t he think of it sooner? The nature of their relationship had changed, it was now time to cement their new status as romantic partners by engaging in coitus.
Feeling his heart pounding in his throat, Sherlock reaches for the bedside lamp and flicks it off, turning John into a dark shadow against the light coming in from the kitchen.
He slams into John again and again, plunging his cock as deep as it will go, and it feels
Sherlock does as he’s told, kissing John with all he has. When they come up for air again, John’s irises have almost disappeared.
“No, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is we’re both doing our best to get better, and I think we can help each other. Don’t you? Don’t you think that after
Never one to deny Sherlock anything, John begins fucking him with his fingers, and uses his other hand to hold Sherlock’s cock steady before he takes it into his mouth.
“No, not busy,” Sherlock says, not adding that he’d always make time for John.
Terry stretches languorously, then reaches for a tissue from a box on his bedside table and uses it to wipe perfunctorily at the mess on his stomach, before carelessly tossing the crumpled tissue on the floor. Sherlock scrunches up his nose in distaste but forces himself not to comment.
“Can’t it be both?” Sherlock asks. “I want it more than I expected to, but I also want you to stop worrying once and for all. Do you really think, after yesterday, that hurting me is still a possibility?”
“Do you want to go to a gay bar with me?” he blurts out.
“No, sorry. But – you know what I mean. I’m – I’m too fucked up.”
to have it.
He feels himself getting more anxious with each of the seventeen steps. He has no more of an idea about what to say or do than he did when he left. But he should be there. He should… assure Sherlock of his continued friendship, somehow, at the very least.
Sherlock shrugs. “I did what you said I should.” His next words sound like they should be venomous, but instead they are completely empty of emotion. “I had sex, so now I hope I finally qualify as a
His heart aches with how much he suddenly wants that, and it’s
“Eager, are we?” John chuckles, stroking Sherlock’s face. John unbuckles his belt and Sherlock watches, mesmerised. He’s never wanted to give head more in his life. John cock looks absolutely delicious, exactly what Sherlock wants to have in his mouth as soon as he can, but John hasn’t told him to yet and so Sherlock just nuzzles against him, smelling him. John is still dressed and Sherlock is naked and on his knees in front of him and it feels absolutely perfect.
Just three words, but Sherlock can read them for what they are: John reaching out, carefully, in a way that doesn’t require Sherlock to respond, that would be easy to ignore.
John clears his throat.
John grins at him. “Sherlock Holmes, you’re a genius.”
John looks up at him, predatory.
“Love you,” John murmurs against Sherlock’s sweaty neck. Sherlock only hums in response, apparently too exhausted for anything more at the moment. But it’s only temporary, John knows. Sherlock will only need a while to recover his strength, and the night is still young.
Sherlock’s heart always used to leap when John smiled at him – now, it soars.
“No it’s not,” John says so sharply and loudly it makes Sherlock flinch and look at him in surprise. “It’s not – that’s what I wanted to talk about.” Panic rises in Sherlock’s chest, but John continues before he can say anything. “Being my friend is actually a pretty shitty deal. I’ve done some terrible things to you.”
The door opened and John stood there in only his boxers and Sherlock gaped a little, feasting his eyes on John’s lovely trim figure.
The question
human being.”
“That’s nice of you to say,” Florian smiles. “I spent six years in Los Angeles, but then I had to come back here.”
It’s a punishment.
” Sherlock cries out as Terry’s inner walls squeeze around him, impossibly hot and tight. “Oh, ohhh.”
he’s disappointed. Sherlock should have realised – Terry picks up older men because he likes having experienced partners, not someone who’s only had sex a handful of times – and never the way Terry apparently prefers.
year’s?”
Working at the rescue centre isn’t always easy or fun or glamorous. Sometimes it’s cleaning kennels and wiping away cat puke and lugging bags of food. Sometimes it’s seeing animals who have been so mistreated by their owners that they have to be put down. But it’s worth it for the time he gets to spend with the animals, for being able to contribute a little bit to making their lives better. If Sherlock has learned anything in the last weeks and months, it’s to appreciate the kindness of strangers, and he’s benefited so much from people being kind to him even though they didn’t know him and didn’t have to be. He wants to give some of that kindness back to the world (he’s always wanted to do that, really, but never knew how to fully embrace it, always felt he had to hide it – he can recognise that now), and he finds that animals are just as worthy objects as people, if not worthier. Perhaps when he returns to London, he could find a similar volunteering position somewhere – and perhaps he could take one of the animals home with him. A dog, he thinks. He’s always loved dogs.
He could call Molly. Sherlock likes Molly. He wouldn’t mind her staying over.
“Focus on
Something that looks like the beginning of a smile flickers on John’s face. “I’ll let Molly know, then.”
“You…” he started but was clearly at a loss for how to continue.
All in all, it was a good experience, but not one he’s anxious to repeat. Clubs aren’t really his thing, he has to put on an act to be there, and he finds he’d rather sleep with people who are attracted to
“I don’t follow.”
“Sherlock? You okay?” he asked gently.
“Oh,” Molly exhales in surprise, but she hugs back without hesitation, pulling him close to her. Sherlock breathes in her citrusy shampoo and refuses to feel awkward. He can have this. Maybe he can’t have John, but he can have this. One day sooner or later he’ll feel ready go back to London and his work and his friends will be waiting for him. He has good things in his life, despite how bleak it’s looked lately.
“Thank you,” John says again. “You’re – incredible. And I promise, I
And then suddenly Terry stops moving and Sherlock’s not inside him anymore. His cock throbs almost painfully at the sudden loss of stimulation and he can’t help making a noise of displeasure.
And the revelation of John’s bisexuality… the feelings it has produced are so different from what he thinks they would have been if he’d found about it Before. Before, he probably would have allowed himself a little hope that perhaps he might have a slim chance. Now, it makes him almost nauseous. He has sympathy for John, he does, he can imagine how hard it must have been for him to live his life without being true to who he was. But the truth is that this is what led John to doing what he did to him, and it
“You know we can stop at any time,” Robert tells him when they’re both naked and Sherlock’s lying on his back with his legs spread, waiting. He nods. He’s still scared, but in a weird way he simultaneously isn’t.
Exactly two weeks ago, John had to Sherlock’s astonishment confessed he was in love with him. What followed (after Sherlock had got over his initial disbelief) had been quite simply the best two weeks of Sherlock’s life. Everything that Sherlock never dared to hope for had come true: hours spent kissing on the sofa, John holding him close and stroking his hair, being allowed to touch and smell and
“I know it’s not my place, but you do realise that’s only possible if he knows he did something wrong and is willing to work on it?”
masturbates over his best friend’s first time?
Sherlock thought that would be enough – John being sorry and determined to be better would be enough, but now everything that John has said seems insurmountable. He came back so willing to let John win back his trust,
“John,” he croaked, trying to sit up.
impossible, it’s not unachievable. Renewing his friendship with John is a gamble too, but they’re both trying to make it work. If they put the same amount of effort into turning the friendship into something more, why couldn’t they succeed? John is no longer in denial about his sexuality, and Sherlock no longer believes himself worthless.They would have to work for it, and take things slowly, and be more careful than what is natural for either of them, and talk and talk and talk, to each other and to their respective therapists, maybe even see a therapist together… but they could do it. They could be happy, together.
He nods, and then watches, mesmerised, as John’s small, beloved hand wraps itself around Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock sucks in a noisy breath as John’s hand moves, and he bites down on his lower lip.
Sherlock has a good time and it seems that John does, too, even though ballet isn’t usually his entertainment of choice. The performance, while not the best Sherlock has ever seen, is enjoyable, and sitting close to John makes up for the fact that there is essentially no leg room. They giggle over smoked salmon and champagne during the interval and John seems happy, his face open and relaxed, his eyes on Sherlock warm and attentive. It makes Sherlock slightly flustered, but he figures that maybe this is simply what John is like now, when he has let go of grief and guilt and anger. When he’s allowing himself to be happy again. Sherlock wishes he could stay like that forever.
“Anilingus,” Sherlock breathes, tripping over the word slightly.
“Thanks,” he forces himself to say, and leaves.
“What? Sherlock, that makes no sense. I don’t know what you think it is that no one would do for you for free but I can guarantee you it’s not true. Someone who loved you would care about what you like, they’d
“Yes,” he promised, even though he had no idea how he would go about that.
Sherlock, however, waits barely long enough to get his breath back before he finds the – now nearly empty – bottle of lube.
did that. He only hoped he could manage to give John what he deserved.
touching himself, without consciously deciding to do it. As if on purpose, at that exact moment John starts thrusting harder, and Sherlock’s lost. He hopes briefly that John may be too distracted by his own pleasure to notice what Sherlock is doing, but after that the only thing he can do is push mindlessly into his own fist and then back against John, torn between which sensation he wants more. John’s driving into him hard, pushing him closer and closer to the edge, and Sherlock tugs at his cock helplessly, wanting,
John is kissing him hungrily, tongue plunging deep into Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock is acutely aware of John’s body pressing him into the sofa, the strength of him, the unmistakable hardness nudging Sherlock’s hip. Something at Sherlock’s core releases a wave of warmth, flooding him with desire.
John shrugs noncommittally, but it’s clear that he just doesn’t want to discuss this further and doesn’t actually believe Sherlock could be right. He glances at Sherlock from the corner of his eye and it’s obvious that this conversation has brought something else to his mind.
“Thanks,” John says as he takes his mug from Sherlock, his fingertips brushing over Sherlock’s knuckles, leaving a trail of warmth behind them.
“Fuck yes, you feel wonderful inside me, love, so hard. Just start moving when you’re ready.”
“You heard me.” Sherlock’s not going to repeat it, it was hard enough to say it once. He’s still not used to this sort of vocabulary, and definitely not out of the bedroom.
Sherlock’s breath stuttered – this was something he didn’t want to say yes to, but there was real interest in John’s voice, and he didn’t want to refuse him…
“Do you think of me when you do that?”
“Do you mind if we switch it up a bit? I like it better from behind,” Terry says before giving Sherlock a quick, dirty kiss and repositioning himself on his knees and forearms, his arse in the air, presenting himself to Sherlock like an offering.
“But do you want him to be?”
“Well, yeah.” John inclines his head apologetically. “You never cooked when I lived here.”
“It isn’t seri—well, it might be. I don’t know. It’s just that I noticed you seem rather reluctant to… have sex with me.”
“No,” Sherlock says with a bad imitation of his usual self-assurance, and places his phone on the small table next to his chair. He’s always a little shy at the beginning, a little spooked by the way his body reacts when it’s high-jacked by want, but John knows his reserve won’t last very long.
“But it matters to me, Sherlock!” John interrupted him. “That’s not how I want it to happen. I want to make love to you, not—get off while you’re panicking or struggling not to or gritting your teeth to bear it.”
? Did Sherlock think no one would be gentle with him simply for the privilege of being with him? And then, a much more horrifying thought suggests itself, and John knows he’s right even before he asks, but he has to ask, he has to.
“No men, then?” Sherlock presses, despite the twinge of fear in his gut. This is a dangerous topic, he knows, but he can’t help poking the wasps’ nest to see how John will react. They’d have to cross this bridge at some point, anyway, so it might as well be now. John looks up at him sharply and for a second Sherlock’s entire body freezes in anticipation of attack, but there’s no anger in John’s eyes. Just… sadness.
They kiss sleepily for a while – a really very short while if you ask John’s spent body – but soon Sherlock is rocking against him again, rubbing his rapidly stiffening cock against John’s thigh.
“John,” he begins on a Thursday afternoon, after they’ve returned from giving their statements at the Yard regarding a rather interesting locked-room murder, and are sitting at the kitchen table with cups of tea and biscuits. “There is a… matter I would like to discuss with you.”
“Yes, but today especially,” John says, forcibly pulling himself away to be able to look at Sherlock’s face. “I think you deserve a reward, don’t you?”
There it is, the final confirmation, terrible and amazing at the same time. It feels like an earthquake, the foundations of the world realigning themselves. Sherlock stares at John’s mouth that shaped those impossible, incredible words, and his throat is parched dry.
John had made it quite clear, of course, that he would give Sherlock all the time he needed, but enough of their make-out sessions had led to John all but rutting against Sherlock to leave no doubt in Sherlock’s mind that he didn’t want to keep him waiting, that
He’d noticed it that very first night at Angelo’s, actually – John looking at him in the candlelight, licking his lips. “
He deduces things about some of those people and shares them with John if they’re interesting – and if there’s nothing interesting, he makes something up to make John laugh. John can mostly tell these days when Sherlock’s fibbing, but he laughs anyway, and that’s all that matters. They buy ice cream and sit on a bench to it (in peace, thankfully, as Rosie has fallen asleep in her pushchair) and he tells John about the case he solved the day before yesterday - a rather gruesome affair involving a pair of human ears mailed to an unsuspecting widow.
“What? You went into your mind palace while we were having sex?! Why?” John was going to be angry. Of course he was. Sherlock had just absolutely ruined their first time, hadn’t he?
?” he asks with the enthusiasm of a small child in a candy store.
Sherlock hates shopping with the masses for high-street fashion, and it is clearly not Molly’s favourite pastime either. But it
, whom he loved more than he’d ever thought possible and who, against all probability, loved him back. But once again, he found that what he felt was not based on logic.
“John?” he says slowly, stroking John’s face until John looks up at him. “I think you should know – I felt – feel – utterly safe with you. You made me feel… cherished.” He can feel his cheeks heat up a little at the word, but it’s true.
Sherlock feels almost like he’s coming too, an intense feeling of satisfaction filling him as he watches and feels John’s orgasm. He’s like a live wire, every twitch of John’s cock inside him sending a jolt of electricity through every nerve of Sherlock’s body.
By the time Sherlock gathers the courage to leave his room the next morning, John’s already up and making breakfast.
How much could have been avoided if only they had talked? If Sherlock had told John, that night when John asked him how he felt about Irene Adler being alive, that of course he was glad she wasn’t dead but on the whole he didn’t care about her at all and what made him unsettled was the implication she’d made about John? If he had confided in John before confronting Moriarty on the rooftop? If he had actually explained himself after coming back? If they had talked during those months after Mary shot him? They’ll have to change that. If they want to save their friendship, they’ll actually have to say what they mean.
Sherlock never reaches orgasm during their encounters. He doesn’t want to. It’s bad enough that male arousal insists on making itself so blatantly obvious, Sherlock has enough trouble being discreet about that. Most of the time, his control over his body is sufficient – he focuses on John’s closeness rather than his own bodily sensations, so that his arousal only reaches a low intensity and when John leaves, he’s able to just let it ebb away on its own. Other times, his body gets the upper hand, filling his veins with liquid desire, he struggles to keep himself in check while John’s fucking him, and the moment John’s gone he’ll get himself off within minutes, trying not to think of John but failing.
Sherlock nodded again. “I’ll just…” he gestured vaguely towards the sink, acutely conscious of his puffy eyes and the stickiness between his buttocks.
John meets Sherlock’s eyes with a serious gaze and for the first time since Sherlock came back it feels like before, like they’re communicating without words – Sherlock sharing how discovering his sexuality has helped him recover, and John listening to him and acknowledging it. They’ll have to say it in words at some point, but it feels so good to know that this private, intimate channel of communication seems to be opening to them once again.
“Mum, dad, you shouldn’t have.” Inside John was thrilled.
Never again would Headingly be a cold mausoleum at Christmas, or birthdays, and in fact on many occasions when the families got together. All was good.
The way Christmas should be
When John straightened up from where he'd been kneeling, he realised he'd pulled the fatigues out of the box. They were now lying in his lap. Heavy, and stiff with starch, the uniform seemed to call to him.
John had come home the day before, staying in a flat with three of his mates for the duration of the year  suited, but he did miss his parents, and they had practically begged him to come home for a ‘get together’ for his 21
“You near bloody suffocated me, you are like a man mountain Sherlock” John giggled lightly despite his discomfiture.
. I just... I… I think I’m just shocked. It’s been like this big hidden secret for so long. You've never brought anyone home. Never seemed interested."
Yep - this would do nicely. John removed the uniform before turning to the bathroom. A long shower, and a quick bite to eat, were all he needed to be ready for whatever adventure Sherlock Holmes had in store.
"I see," John said. "So you've been disobedient? You've been having illicit thoughts, Sherlock?"
Sherlock, reading Johns unspoken message stood, “Angelo, once again your hospitality has been second to none, but we must take our leave, thank you for a lovely meal once again.”
John's thumb rubbed over the head of Sherlock’s cock, smearing his precome with each thrust.
He put his hands on Sherlock’s head - bringing him closer.
Sherlock almost choked at the thought of a boy’s night out, but as he looked at John he felt calm. John looked happy, and content. And Sherlock found himself reassuring Mrs Hudson. “Yes of course Mrs Hudson. You should take her and have fun, she will love it! When do you intend to go?”
been interested in people. It’s just never been reciprocated."
Unexpectedly, Sherlock was ripped back to the present confused for a moment what was happening, then realizing that Johns lips were covering his own, soft, cool. Sherlock gasped.
After leaving the book store John felt a little like he had had his tea leaves read. The woman was obviously mad! But then again, she had spoken words that resonated with him, he felt like she had looked right into his very being. John took the long way home, He walked through Green Park, feeling the wind on his skin, and felt the summer sun wrapping around his very being. The aroma of freshly mown grass gave him a deep feeling of satisfaction as did the gentle whisper of the trees as they were tickled by the light breeze. He thought about Sherlock, his sun, his very own super star. A mighty force; powerful and strong, often volatile causing the energy he emitted to damage those in his wake. But the other side was the warmness and the life and vitality he had. When an idea came to him, he literally glowed; satisfaction and splendour emanating from his very core. Just as the sun sat in the sky, a force to be reckoned with, Sherlock sat in his heart, warming him from within.
"Indeed, John... here you are." Sherlock felt like he'd been struck by lightning. Every atom in his body seemed to be vibrating at an alarming rate, threatening to liquify him in an instant. John - John looked… gorgeous. All Sherlock could think of was standing to attention,
John took Sherlock’s hand, and as they turned they were met with a gust of freezing air as the door was flung open again. Greg pushed in his son and daughter… “Come on you two, let’s get warm…”
His mum looked at her watch, John its half ten, if your young man is going to be hear soon, don’t you think you should at least shower and dress?
John chuckled. “Well, we will see when the rest of your guests arrive.”
"Well, if I can cope with your bisexuality - and with you bringing your flock of inane females into our home, and listening to them screech, as you do whatever it is you do to them - then I think you can cope with me being gay and not bringing anyone home at all." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "As for interest? I
Then John pushed him away.
John no longer dated women. “What? Why the hell had he thought that? He no longer dated, full stop. He wasn’t sure why his mind had decided to add on the clarification of gender. That made his brain jingle with uncertainty. He hadn’t dated anyone, since he had been back in 221b. “I’m a responsible dad now, have to look after Rosie now, can’t afford to upset the delicate balance in Rosie’s life, am too tired for dating” were just some of the many excuses put forward if anyone had enquired about his love life. Sherlock however had often mulled over these responses, thinking that single mums and dads dated all the time, so deduced that John’s excuses were lame at best. But for once he held his tongue.
"Lay down," he ordered. "Get these trousers off. Now."
Sherlock noticed that John looked good this evening, he noticed the way the jumper fitted in all the right places. The way those jeans hugged John’s arse. He also noticed that John seemed a little on edge, but he held his tongue, something he realised he had been doing a lot lately.
Sherlock risked a quick glance up at John’s face. John’s eyes were straight forward, his voice steady, but a tiny smile played at the corner of his mouth. Sherlock also took in the faint nervous tremor in John’s legs as he stood to attention.
“Hello, Rosie.” Sherlock scooped her up, smiling at her delighted squeals. “I missed you last night, we will have double story time later! As for Father Christmas,” he said, slowly enunciating the sounds for her, “Well, you must be in bed early tonight, to see what he will bring… you have to be patient.” He laid a kiss on her head, and placed her carefully down on the floor.” At her age, she didn’t even really understand the concept, but John was adamant that Father Christmas would come to visit, and Sherlock was secretly pleased that for the first time ever, this dusty old house would host the fat man in the silly red suit.
“Well, you are hot John, very hot.” Sherlock wondered if he imagined that John’s fevered, flushed face had blushed, a pink tinge reaching the tips of his perfect ears.
But here, here, in this draughty big old house, there had never been surprises under the tree. Certainly, no stockings. Gifts would be pre-planned, functional: - clothes, shoes, books, especially books, after all what was the point of receiving a gift that you didn’t want? He had remembered both his mother and father reciting this line on numerous occasions.
“Oh, Sherlock, I love you, this will be the best Christmas ever!”
- ... that was…
John smiled, at her excitement, and forward planning. In turn Sherlock relaxed a little more, knowing that Rosie would be fine, and in fact would have a wonderful little holiday. And so, it was, later that afternoon, a giggling Rosie was strapped into her car seat into the back of the black limo followed by “Anna and Mrs Hudson.
When the food arrived, they grinned as the aromas of garlic, tomatoes and onions filled the air around them. They had never had a poor meal at the hands of Angelo. The food was simply divine. Both men grunted and hummed in appreciation as they ate. John cherished these times when Sherlock's appetite reared its head, allowing Sherlock to tuck into his meal with gusto. At some point Angelo, had whipped over and replaced the spent wine bottle with a fresh one, and by the time they had finished their entrée and Tiramisu dessert, they were both sated, a little more than tipsy and feeling very contented. They sat and chatted some more whilst Angelo brought coffee, and sat a while with them reminiscing over old times and enquiring about
Then, as John was about to close the door, a horn beeped as another car drew up. “Aah, our last guests.” Sherlock and John moved forward to collect coats and hats from the children and from Greg, then Harry, Clara and Martha Hudson as they came through the door.
His mother laughed, and shouted excitedly, “Oh, yes of course, I knew we still had that book…. How lovely!”
Sherlock’s laugh rumbled against John’s head, “Oh, John. I love you too, and, well I hope you never stop kissing me.”
“I wanted this for so long, wanted to hold you in my arms, wanted to feel your skin next to mine – I love you so much, Sherlock.”
. Kiss me - please - "
He was brought back to the present as the strains of “O Holy Night” began to play on the piano. The piece was played beautifully and without errors, even though it was a practice run. He had practiced this piece too, it would be played as a duet. He wouldn’t ever offer up praise to his brother, though. His brother was aware that he was an accomplished pianist, and wouldn’t expect Sherlock to pat him on the back. They would nod at each other at the end, satisfied with the joint performance. Proud, but not allowing it to show.
“Hey, Merry Christmas, Sherlock,” John spoke quietly. “When shall we tell them?”
Lifting the box out almost reverently, John sighed. He hadn’t opened this box since he'd returned from Afghanistan. Inside were all of his belongings - his dog tags, and a replacement set of army fatigues that had been given to him at the hospital. His own had been ruined - bloodied, torn and subsequently cut from his damaged body by army medics at the field hospital.
Sherlock jumped slightly at the order - but his own cock stiffened in arousal as he took John further into his mouth, increasing his suction and thrusting hard.
After Mrs Hudson and Mrs Holmes put the children to bed, Mycroft just happened to find himself standing under a sprig of mistletoe as Greg came back into the lounge from the kitchen.  Greg looked at Mycroft, then grinned.
The offer for Christmas at Headingly had extended family wide. John’s sister Harry and her wife Clara had been invited. Christmas had been something to look forward in the past three years since Harry had been on the wagon, since she and Clara had been together. Mrs Hudson would be joining them too.
John gasped. He knew that Sherlock would say yes to the adoption, and since they had realised that they were physically attracted to each other as well as the best of friends, he felt they would be together forever, but he had never considered that Sherlock would want to marry him, would even entertain such a ‘silly ritual,’
"So," John said, as they entered the bedroom. "You have a busy night ahead of you, private. Where shall we start?"
His knees buckled; he fell to the floor.
At the words of the sun’s power, John looked up and smiled. “I have a… an erm.. a friend. He reminds me of the sun”. He suddenly felt stupid. What on earth was he telling this stranger? “I mean, erm, not like that, I mean he isn’t hot or anything, I just keep dreaming about the sun”, oh God this was getting worse. “Oh Shit - I mean, he just, oh It doesn’t matter, just ignore me”
"Sorry, sir," Sherlock stuttered - a little unsure of where to take this new roleplay. "I can make amends?"
“Right, thank God for that!” shouted Sherlock. “Congratulations, you two. Took you longer than John and I! And, talking about John and I, well we are going to bed! We have some celebrating to do - in person.”
With that, two pairs of lips met, the kiss deepening, love passing from one body to the other.
“Yes John, the longest day of the year, a time where the earth’s axis is….. Sherlock had slipped into his mind palace to purge the room in which he kept facts about space, the solar system and other ‘useless information’ (for John’s benefit).
The sun-beam slipped through the gap in the curtains, dust motes dancing lazily as John stretched. “Mmmm, pffff,” John puffed out an exhalation. 21? “Bloody hell how did that happen?” Clenching and unclenching his fingers he felt the knuckles crunch and winced, his mother’s voice creeping in to his head. “You’ll have arthritis by the time you’re 21 if you keep cracking your knuckles like that”, John grinned. Well, 21 and still no arthritis. He did feel knackered though. The last week had been a roller coaster of exams and assessments. Half way through med school, just another three to go before the next stage.
I think you need to work on your authority, and get this cab out of here. I think the case will wait."
The following day, John sat in his chair in the afternoon warmth, Rosie was having lunch downstairs with Mrs Hudson and he and Sherlock sat in companionable silence. Suddenly the room brightened as a cloud moved away from the sun, and he gasped as he looked at Sherlock. The sun’s rays hit him in such a way that he seemed to glow, a halo, an ethereal contrast between his milky pale skin and the warmth of the sun. Sherlock and the sun merged into one celestial wonder. John just stared, “beautiful, beautiful man” His brain narrated his unspoken words. John was oblivious to the quirk of eyebrow that Sherlock had lifted at the sound of John’s gasp. Once again Sherlock held his tongue.
John gaped at her, his mouth open slightly as he almost felt compelled to listen.
But things
John appeared at the same time as his dad. “Sherlock. Hey!”
Sherlock woke every morning waiting for the proverbial axe to fall. As soon as his brain came on line, he awaited the moment where reality slammed back into him, to reveal the person who was lonely, and bereft of friends. His breath would hasten his heart beat accelerate. Then he would hear the small sounds of Rosie playing in her room. Rosie who slept even less than he did, but who was happy to play if she had something to engage her young mind. His relief at that moment, never failed to fuel his fire and extinguish the doubt that had plagued that dark age. Now he was, well, he was happy. Mmmm, yes happy. A word people use every day, but until recently, a word he had never fully comprehended. Sure, he had experienced, delight, and excitement; the odd moment of joy. And over the past six months or so, he had laughed a lot more when Rosie, or more usually, John did something hilariously silly. But now, yes happiness. It was a constant, only interrupted by that momentary lapse of uncertainty each morning as he woke.
