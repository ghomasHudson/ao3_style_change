“It’s very important,” Sam presses, flashing his most winning smile.
“You know what? Last time I get pizza for you jerks.” Dean glares at them.
“Uh, guys? You ready to get going?” Sam cuts in.
Cas tilts his head and turns to Dean. “What is a pinky promise? I am not familiar with this method of agreement.”
“Best friend,” says Cas quietly. “Is that what you would call me, then?”
Apparently loud enough for Cas, Sam, and everyone else to hear.
(saved it)—then peers over Cas’s shoulder at the paper.
Then Cas and Jack start debating about whether Jack can get his driver’s license, and Dean sits back. There’s something weird—a feeling, tears, laughter—caught in his chest. A part of him that looks at this domesticity and asks, is this what it would be like? How much is missing except the ring on your finger?
“What are you doing?”
“What you get up to off duty is your business, isn’t it?” Dean raises his drink, making sure to flex his biceps as he does. Oh yeah. He’s still got it. “I’m not inviting you to the staff room.”
“Nope, just passing through for work.” Dean winks as she hands his drink to him. “Thanks.”
Taking that as assent, Dean hands Claire one of his knives and watches Cas lead the way outside.
“Apologies, Dean.” Cas has crossed the room, and now he looms over the foot of the bed. God, Cas is standing over his bed in his shirtsleeves, with his mussed hair and a confused pout on his face. Cas is standing over his bed.
Why is he thinking of this? Why should it matter?
“But we got takeout,” says Cas, tilting his head.
“After he said he loves you,” Sam points out.
Cas smiles back at her. “Thank you, Madison. I love it.”
Cas’s features soften just a touch. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Yeah. Right,” says Dean. But he still stands there, petrified, and Cas has to give him a gentle nudge before he climbs back into the Impala and gets the car in gear, heart beating like it’ll burst out of his chest.
Dean beams right back at him. “Deal,” he says, and at last Cas kisses him again.
The kid’s smile gets about a thousand times brighter, and she throws her arms around Cas’s neck, her little feet barely brushing the ground.
So Dean resolutely does not think about the dark-haired man a few seats down, and instead picks up his drink and slides in front of the bartender.
Wait, what? How long has Sam known?
“My pleasure.”
Aww, Samantha’s feelings are hurt. They should all braid his hair and talk about feelings and crap.
And that’s all it takes—something in Dean lurches and stutters and he goes still.
Dean thinks about himself running off, throwing back whiskies, hitting on bartenders, and is glad their s—glad Jack isn’t working the case with them.
Dean’s heart starts pounding. “That’s stupid,” he says. “Cas doesn’t feel…” The words taper off faced with Sam’s impressive bitch-face. “…that way,” Dean finishes, with a lack of sincerity which a child could see through.
“Yeah, of course,” says Dean quickly—maybe too quickly. He clears his throat. “Yeah, man, we’ll set up a room for you.” For some reason he can’t stop grinning.
“I’m sorry, what did you say your names were?” She pulls her unwashed hair into a bun.
And at that, Dean pulls him close, nods into Cas’s shoulder. “Yeah,” he mumbles. “Yeah, okay.”
Sam carefully pries the Impala keys from Dean’s fist and pats him on the shoulder. “It’ll be alright, Dean. Just—be honest, okay? You’ve spent enough time avoiding this.”
Claire hesitates. But at last she shrugs and gets to her feet. “Sure, whatever,” she says, but her eyes are shining.
Cas’s eyes go a little wide, then he hugs back carefully, like he’s worried he might break her.
“Seriously?” Dean mutters, glaring at it. “Now you cooperate?”
He looks up to say something, the usual macho nonsense—and his eyes fall on the flowers.
Between trying to calculate Cas’s age and flinching away from the florist’s sardonic raised eyebrow, Dean somehow finds himself fishing his credit card out of his pocket.
(And that’s strange, isn’t it, because Dean has always sought sex pretty consistently.)
Dean turns bright red. He’s been sitting at the table, mooning over Cas, staring at the damn flowers for half an hour.
“Yes.” Cas tilts his head. “We have been gone for half an hour. Were you sitting here the whole time?”
“We, uh, have to wash the…” Dean’s eyes slide from the disposable bamboo chopsticks to the plastic spoons they used to scoop up rice. “…the cups,” he finishes.
He locks eyes with Cas in the rearview mirror, sees that piercing blue gaze from over an armful of red roses and fragrant pink blooms.
“Sorry, what was that?” He can hear the smirk in Sam’s voice.
Dean is home.
Without thinking, Dean nods.
The florist raises an eyebrow. “The FBI want to know about roses?”
“There were also several saved to your ‘For later’ list.”
“…Cas needs to help me with the dishes,” Dean mumbles.
And he’s weak, so weak, can’t help the feelings that fizz through his veins. He wants to get up and sing some Zeppelin, or blaze down the highway in Baby, only he can’t seem to move.
But he probably could have convinced himself it was just a stray observation if it didn’t keep happening.
But he’s still looking at Cas, trying not to smile himself, as he pulls away from the curb.
And for a moment he thinks Sam is going to back off. He thinks this will be another time they almost talked about this but didn’t quite, another time he gets to maintain plausible deniability.
Cas wipes gently at his tear-tracks. “Dean,” he says. “You are my family. I want to build a home with you.”
He freezes. “Uh… I don’t think that would be a good idea, man. Not with the hunting lifestyle.”
But not anymore.
He flushes. “I’m fine, Cas! Just go to-” Right, he doesn’t sleep. “Just, go back to watching Netflix or whatever.”
Cas is still holding onto him. Dean follows the angel’s arm up to his blue, blue eyes. “What, Cas?” He swallows hard.
“Meat lover’s,” Dean admits, and he hands over the plate that he had, in all honesty, prepared for Cas all along.
“Two of those were for a case, Sammy. I’m not sure what you’re talking about.” Dammit, there’s a stubborn bit of casserole stuck to this dish. He can’t seem to scrape it off.
Cas turns to Dean. “When will we be back?” he asks.
Claire smiles—just a little—and she steps forward like she’s going in for a hug. But then she stops and clears her throat and slouches back to the front step.
He speed-walks out into the parking lot, wrenches open the impala’s door and drives.
They’re midway through interviewing the local florist when Cas’s phone rings, interrupting the conversation.
He tries to forget about it, but Cas digs up a vase from the depths of the bunker and proudly displays the flowers on the map room table. Every morning as he enters the room, Cas brushes a hand over the petals, then smiles to himself and goes to make coffee.
They finish the frigging fantastic dinner Jody made, complete with apple pie, then Dean reluctantly leads the way outside. Claire follows him to the Impala. She bites her lip, as though trying to make up her mind, then says suddenly, “Look after Castiel, okay?”
“Okay.” Dean beams, and kisses him again.
The sound of the door opening is like a gunshot, and it jerks Dean back into focus. He looks up and locks eyes with Sam.
“Positive.” Dean holds up his left hand. “Really, I’m not. I just—earlier someone thought my friend and I were married. That was just on my mind. But I’m single.”
“No,” says Dean, easy and without thinking. For some reason he’s blushing.
“Brother,” Sam supplies, smirk widening. “Thank you, that would be perfect.”
“Yeah, you too.” She smiles at him again, the expression warm and gentle. Dean thinks he should be shouting and belligerent, demanding why she would assume—assume all kinds of obviously wrong things about him.
“Braiding your hair, like I said.”
“I love you,” Dean mutters, so quiet and faint he can’t even hear himself say it.
For a moment Dean is still, then he’s holding Cas, clutching at his shoulders. For some reason there are tears pricking at his eyes. For some reason he’s still shaking. He needs to feel Cas beneath his hands, needs to know this is real, that Cas is going to stay.
Cas’s hand thumps Dean on the back. But even when Dean gasps in a breath, the hand rests there for a moment, giving two gentle pats, before withdrawing. Dean feels the ghost of those touches on him still, like more handprints seared into his skin.
Dean steps out of the car and sets his jaw. Okay. You can do this, Winchester. Just pretend nothing happened. Act like Dad.
“Oh my god, stop talking!” Sam’s scandalized face is priceless. If not for the soapy rubber gloves he’s wearing, Dean would snap a photo.
“Oh,” says Cas. “Are they for the case?”
“What?” Dean looks up. Sam and Jack are both giving them weird looks, which makes no sense. He and Cas just briefly glanced at each other for a couple seconds.
“Sam, Dean,” says Cas, tucking his phone away. “I have assisted Jack with making popcorn. It took several attempts, but the last bag barely burned. Also, Jack has asked us to pick up more popcorn on our way home.”
Okay, so maybe he felt a weird thing, Dean thinks that night, staring at the motel ceiling. It wasn’t—what it felt like. Dean is straight. That one time (or that other time, or the recurring dream with Dr. Sexy)—none of those things count. He must have slept with, what, a hundred girls? Which makes him a hundred percent straight. That’s just basic math.
“No. Dean, look at me.”
Dean throws it back in one fluid motion and slides the glass to her. “You could pour me another whiskey.”
“I’m good, I swear.” Dean sets a few bills down on the bar. “Um—have a good night.”
“Dean bought them for me,” says Cas calmly.
“Really?” The florist shakes her head. “You should take more time for yourselves, you know.”
Cas gives the tiniest smile. He appears to be holding his breath.
Dean shrugs. “Yeah, he’s… he’s really good with kids.”
“Where did you run off to?” Sam bitches.
Which is when Sam gets the bright idea of buying a suit.
The angel steps in closer, closer. “Dean,” he whispers, reaching with both hands to cradle Dean’s face. “I have loved you since the moment I saw you.”
Three weeks and counting.
And Dean makes the stupid, stupid mistake of looking up.
But to Dean’s surprise, what actually comes out of his mouth is, “He’s an angel.”
“You’re going to teach Jack bad manners, Dean,” Cas murmurs.
“Four, huh. What are you drawing?”
(At the thought of home, he resolutely shoves aside mental images of the bunker.)
Cas’s hand is still on him. Dean forgets why he was upset or what he was going to say to correct the tailor. He pays, his mind still scrambled from that gentle touch.
“Oh, we didn’t have a ceremony,” Dean says. An instant later, the embarrassment crashes into him like a freight train.
Screw that girl at the motel. Dean is going to have some fun tonight, and forget about C—forget about everything else.
“Hey, we’ll be home soon,” says Dean quickly. “You’ll see him tomorrow.”
“How is he?”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” says the girl, face falling. She slides them a set of keys. “I didn’t mean to assume. I’m happy to put you and your partner in with your…”
She nods. “Bye, Castiel. See you soon, or whatever.”
Jack bounds out of his chair with a toddler’s enthusiasm—and shit, Dean keeps forgetting he technically is a toddler.
“Um-” The nurse looks on the brink of calling security, so Dean hurries over and draws his badge.
“Four.” Madison stares at her sparkly Velcro shoes.
“Allow me,” he tells the nurses, and steps forward to the cradle.
“Sorry,” he pants. “Sorry, I—”
And the feeling is back, worse than ever, and Dean knows all his rationalizing was bullshit.
Time to misdirect. “I haven’t been whipped since that hot waitress from Colorado. You remember? The one with the really long nails—”
“So back to the woman who bought the flowers from you,” says Sam. “The woman with the weird skin condition. Can you describe the flower arrangement she bought?”
“No—hey, Cas, come on,” Dean insists. “You’re great with Claire. I know she’s a teenager and all that, but she loves you.” He swallows hard then mumbles, “She’s not the only one.”
He screeches to a halt at the first bar he can find. The neon light is forgiving, washing out the bruises and scrapes he accumulated during the hunt. Dean swaggers inside, breathing in the smell of spilt beer and sweat with relief. Oh yeah. He practically grew up at places like this.
What has Dean ever done to deserve that? How can he possibly ask for more?
“This is for you,” the kid mutters, and she holds out a piece of paper.
“Why don’t I show you how to fight with a knife?” asks Cas, sliding the angel-blade from his sleeve.
“Um, guys?” asks Sam.
And then he runs away—rather, gallantly exits—the flower shop, bouquet raised to shield him from Sam’s grin.
“Parent?” asks Cas.
They have the ceremony in the woods. Cas wears his fancy suit. Dean wears a blue buttondown that matches Cas’s eyes.
“Of course,” says Cas, and she bustles out.
“Here.” Cas has a spare for him. He smiles when Dean takes it. Their fingers touch, and for a moment Dean forgets to breathe.
Cas gets up and kneels in front of her, and Dean immediately misses his body heat—uh, because he’s cold, that’s all. California gets real chilly in July.
Sam is already chortling into his box of stir-fried rabbit food.
“Sammy,” he says. “Did you need help braiding your hair?”
Dean decides it’s time to make his move. “Say—” he begins, but she’s glancing to the side. Dean sees that someone else has sat down, waiting to be served.
That stupid red flush starts creeping into Dean’s cheeks again. Across the table, Sam’s eyes light up with that younger brother, Dean-is-embarrassing-himself sort of glee.
Dean goes straight for the fridge. There are still a couple beers left, thank fuck. He cracks one open and drains half of it.
Dean just barely holds in his snort.
But of course, Sam doesn’t let him off the hook that easily.
She nods and turns back to Cas, who is bent over the cradle. “Is your partner always like this?”
Every time he’s actually imagined how this conversation might go down, he’s thought Sammy would be all bleeding heart, would you like a hug, I love you no matter what. But Dean can’t read Sam’s expression at all, and his heart hammers.
Dean glances at Jody, who sighs. “Be careful, both of you.”
And after that, Dean can’t stop doing it.
But the joke is on him, because the tailor seems to take this comment to mean Dean is the one in charge, and everything must meet with his approval. While Sam casually examines pictures on the walls and manages to question the two assistants, Cas is paraded before Dean in an endless array of suits. Pinstriped like a fifties star, sharp black, grey with a silk tie that brings out his eyes…
, thinks Dean.
Dean reflects on all the years Cas has worn the exact same suit, day and night. “You have no idea,” he says, then the bottom of his stomach drops out.
As they pull away from Jody’s house, Cas waves goodbye to Claire. She makes sure to roll her eyes, but she waves back. Cas’s face breaks into a big toothy smile. It’s pretty endearing—rather, it’s pretty—it’s fine. Everything is fine.
The florist shrugs and reaches into the coolers behind her, starts withdrawing handfuls of roses and lilies and other colourful blossom. “I’ll do you one better,” she says. “Her instructions were very specific.
Dean’s heart does
So they practice for an hour. When Jody sends Dean to bring them in for dinner, he stands for a moment watching Cas—the elegant lines of his body as he slashes and cuts midair, the careful way he corrects Claire.
Sam and Dean go back to hunting your average monsters. Cas drops by occasionally, though he spends most of his time in Heaven. Which is totally fine. Dean doesn’t mind that he never gets to see Cas for longer than a few hours. A day, if he’s lucky.
“Dean, you deserve to be happy. How many times have you saved the world?”
He finds a seat at the bar. “I’ll have whatever beer is on special tonight,” he says, and casts a practiced eye across the room. It’s still early, but there are a few promising glances, at any rate. Not that Dean is feeling picky after all this time.
“No, thanks; he doesn’t sleep much,” says Dean.
What the fuck.
The nurse sort of does a double take, raising her eyebrow.
Dean reflects on a red rose, dropping Cas off on a date with someone else, and his stomach turns. He drops his eyes.
And damn him, but Dean’s grin falters. “No,” he says.
He shoves a mouthful of noodles into his mouth to avoid talking, and Cas shakes his head, but he’s still smiling.
Dean lobs the keys at Sam’s chest. “You two go ahead. I’m not sleepy.”
He tries to remind himself how ludicrous the whole idea is, the mental picture of him in a nice suit, Sam crying as he walks Dean down the aisle—wait,
“He’s not my husband!” Dean stammers. “We’re not—I’m not—”
“What?” Dean exclaims, nearly dropping a slice of pizza. “Why the hell would you think that?”
“Now Agent—Richards, was it?”
Dean shudders and parks Baby. He sees the motel room’s curtains twitch, catches a glimpse of Sam’s worried face and overgrown hair.
And dammit, but Sam’s words keep playing in his head. Dean will always claim Sam is wrong on pure principle, but he has to admit, his brother sometimes is maybe not a complete idiot.
Dean feels his head snap forward. He hadn’t even realized he was still looking out the window, wondering what Jack was saying that had Cas smiling like that.
And Dean eloquently retorted,
“You started it, bitch.” Dean rinses another dish. Only one more and then he’s done.
Dean manages to clear his throat, draws back. He goes to say something, something dry or self-deprecating or sarcastic—and then he locks eyes with Cas and the words go away.
“Yeah,” Dean hears himself say, then before he can stop himself: “He’ll be a great parent someday.”
The emotions are locked tight in Dean’s throat. Every inch of him tense and tight, and he can’t reach for Cas, no matter how much he wants to.
“No!” he blurts, too loud and too vehement, and everyone turns to stare at him.
Dean and Cas sit awkwardly for a long moment, the little girl staring up at them.
“Is everything alright?” asks Cas.
She sighs, and though she leans in, her tone has shifted. Dean has had too many nights confiding in a friendly bartender, and he recognizes that kind tone. “And this friend—you don’t have feelings for her?”
“Your heartbeat increased again, Dean. Are you sure you’re alright?”
Dean freezes. Part of him screams that this is it, that Cas is leaving him. But another, small voice in his head suggests this might be something else, something Dean hasn’t even let himself hope for.
“It’s Jack,” he tells Dean. “I’d better take this. Last time I ignored him, he sulked for a week.”
Well, at least he hasn’t left yet. Dean shifts his weight, fiddles with the car keys.
Dean resist the urge to whimper, because he is a grown-ass man.
Dean redirects his gaze to the wall. He mutters into his beer.
“He’ll be back soon, Madison, dear,” says the grandmother, forcing a smile. “These nice men are here to find him.
And he takes Dean’s open hand.
Cas’s shoulders stiffen. He strides ahead of them and pushes open a door.
But Dean forces himself to stay quiet now, not to make some joke or excuse. He lets the words hang there in the air between them, and he waits. Cas is still touching him. Can he feel Dean shaking?
Then Dean remembers how Cas touches the flowers every morning, eyes gentle and focused, and he realizes.
Cas’s eyes snap up, and Dean goes still. Did he seriously just say that?
Sam and Jack plop into seats next to them, and Dean gives a start. “What are you doing?” he asks without thinking.
Dean’s head snaps up just in time to see Cas set a box of Chinese food in front of him.
Jesus, he nearly said ‘hot.’ Right in front of Cas and Sam and some random strangers. The blush burns up his cheeks like a beacon.
Still chuckling, Sam heads into the bathroom. Dean picks up the pizza box and places it on the bed, then slumps down next to Cas.
Cas tilts his head. “Would you like me to help you sleep?”
“Jack is the only one with a cup,” Sam points out, because he’s an asshole who is begging for itching powder in his underpants. “The rest of us are having beers.”
“I’m fine too, Cas, thanks for asking.” Sam flashes his best bitchface.
Dean wonders why his chest feels tight—probably just heartburn from the bacon cheeseburger he had for lunch.
Dean clears his throat. “Yeah, of course. You know—I think I should head home.”
Dean swallows. “Sorry.”
“You need to talk to your husband?”
“Do you want children, Dean?”
Dean eyes him suspiciously. “You sure that’s why you’re here?”
“When was the last time you remembered his birthday?” she counters.
Dean stares. “How much?”
“Uh—you two take a cab back to the motel, okay?” Dean turns, but he can’t quite look them in the eye. “I’m just going to—go somewhere. Talk soon!”
(To his eternal frustration, Cas
“You look after your father for me, alright?” says Cas, and the little girl nods solemnly.
And the smile gets so big and bright that it cuts right through him.
“Thank you.” Cas straightens up once more, and he turns that lovely smile from Madison to Dean.
That’s when he imagines it, really imagines it: what a wedding would have looked like.
But the twist in his gut is gone, and in its place is something Dean could almost call relief.
The door swings open. “Hello, Dean.”
Then there’s the local gas store attendant who comments Dean should get his husband to upgrade to a nice classic car like the impala—“I’ve tried to tell him, but he loves that damn thing,” says Dean, before freezing up.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean lowers his crowbar.
They file inside and wash up. As they load their plates, Claire asks whether they’ll be back in Sioux Falls so Cas can keep teaching her. It’ll be a break from stupid schoolwork, she says. Jody beams and piles extra roast potatoes onto Cas’s plate.
“Thank you for dinner,” said Cas.
“Are you alright?” Cas asks.
“Wow, your partner has the magic touch,” says the nurse, sounding impressed in spite of herself.
“Gross,” Sam snaps, rolling his eye.
There it is—the touchy-feely crap he was expecting.
And Sam asks, “Are you in love with him?”
But then Dean asks himself what he would have picked, and the mental image shifts. He’s standing in a field outside the bunker. Charlie, Rowena, Jack, Mom, and Sammy are all there. The women are laughing, Jack is bemused but happy. (Sam is still crying in this fantasy.) Dean pictures himself wearing something simple this time, just slacks and a nice blue buttondown that matches Cas’s eyes. The angel stands in front of him, holding his hand. Dean imagines the cool metal band that Cas slides onto his finger. Cas smiles and reaches up to cup his face, whispers that he’s happy, that he loves Dean, that he’s staying—
“I may have suspected Sam would find your movie preferences funny,” Cas admits with a sheepish smile.
“When was the last time you saw your son?” asks Cas.
“He hasn’t—technically said he
“My husband was the same way before I met him,” says the tailor, oblivious, as he charges Dean a king’s freaking ransom. “He still tried to wear a t-shirt to a fancy restaurant the other day. Oh well, you need to pick your battles, right?” And he smiles at Dean as he hands him the receipt.
If that hadn’t been enough to confirm how he felt, the next morning would have done it. When Dean and Sam step out of the motel room, Cas has just healed a little boy who skinned his knee on the sidewalk. Dean watches the angel straighten up and tuck his hands into his trench coat pockets, and he thinks,
Dean freezes, and for a moment the world seems to hold its breath.
Dean barks out a laugh. “Well played, Cas. Well played.”
She starts to ask about work, and Dean nearly stumbles over the answers he used to give so easily before. He finds he can’t remember the last time he did this.
There’s just enough reckless energy fizzing through him that Dean might run the risk of knocking, of talking, of telling Cas everything.
Dean shrugs and stares at the wall.
And Cas gets into the backseat, and Dean’s mood lifts even more. He and Sam climb into the car, and Dean switches on the radio.
“Dean, wait up!”
Dean looks up, tongue-tied. All the other incidents flash before his eyes, all the times he implied Cas was something far more than that, or went along with others misinterpreting things.
“Look man,” says Sam. “I don’t want to be out of line here. But has it occurred to you that maybe the reason you keep calling him your husband is that he’s, you know, your husband?”
He clears his throat. “I’m, uh—going to start on the dishes.”
Cas puts his hands in the pockets and smirks, clearly enjoying as Dean gets lectured. “You’re sure you can tell the difference, Dean?”
Madison ignores the question and stares up at them through watery eyes.
He thinks,
It didn’t seem so crazy when they shared pizza and fell asleep together.
Jaw clenched, Dean nods again. There’s adrenaline surging through every inch of him, and he feels this terrible premonition that if he lets himself open his mouth, he’ll say something terrifying and irrevocable.
“Are you guys back already?” he blurts.
At that, Dean’s stomach drops, and he just barely resists the urge to bludgeon himself with the crowbar and put himself out of his misery.
“I know that was something private,” he says quietly. “I apologize. I did not mean to intrude on your personal thoughts. But for what it is worth, I thought it was lovely—what you pictured. I loved it. I want that. If that’s what you want, I want it, too.”
As Cas gets changed, Dean fishes the stolen credit card from his pocket and goes to pay.
“The next time someone calls you my husband,” says Cas, hands still cupping Dean’s face, “I’m going to agree with them.”
But anyway, they’re sitting in Jody’s living room sipping beer while Claire complains about school and hints that she would rather be out hunting. Jody listens with a tight expression on her face, and at last Cas gets to his feet.
He picks up an extra large meat lover’s pizza and a large vegetarian pizza on his way back to the motel. He realizes he doesn’t even know which room they’re in, has to stop at the main desk again. The green-haired girl slides him a key and avoids his eyes.
It doesn’t matter that Dean has decided to be disciplined, because even in the bunker he can’t escape. Jack goes on a movie kick, and it’s like every damn film he picks has to feature a wedding at the end. Movie night becomes a special form of torture for Dean, as he sits on the couch next to Cas and tries to think about cars and monsters every time a romantic scene comes on.
This close, he can feel Cas’s beating heart, can smell him, can feel the edges of the trench coat draping around his back. One of Cas’s hands strokes over his back, the other rising to pet gently at his hair. It’s so much contact. For some reason, it makes him hold Cas even tighter. Dean is mortified by the sound he’s suppressing, the groan or sob that’s leaking past his lips.
“Right,” says Sam, but for some reason he suddenly seems eager to leave. “Jack, let’s go.”
It’s so reminiscent of their early encounters, when Cas knew nothing about life on Earth, that Dean laughs. “There’s the angel I know and—” He chokes, then quickly lifts his beer and drinks once more.
He eats too much pizza. He accidentally laughs at the funny parts.
The bartender pours him another drink, and Dean doesn’t quite manage to meet her eyes. He’s not even trying to look down her shirt, either—just looking at the scuffed wooden surface of the bar.
When at last they pull back, there are only a couple inches between them.
“Not that it’s any of my business,” she says, beginning to ring him through, “But don’t you think your husband would be hurt if he knew you were buying those?”
“Dean,” says Cas again. “What you said at the hospital-”
Something goes warm and stupid in Dean’s head, something that hears Cas so casually refer to the bunker as “home.”
Dean gasps, and this time the tears do come. He registers that those are the words he imagined, the words he wanted from Cas but couldn’t ask for.
“Hey, watch out!” Sam shouts, and Dean swerves out of another vehicle’s path. “You need me to drive?” Sam adds once he’s caught his breath.
She’s already narrowed her eyes. “You sure?”
Dean rolls his eyes. “I’m fine.”
Ridiculous. He’s not the marrying type. Dean Winchester, notorious ladies’ man, settle down? Dean Winchester buy into all the crap that goes along with marriage? A tiered cake, polished silverware, starched tablecloths—none of that is him.
Dean freezes. “Cas, we’ve talked about this,” he hisses. “Don’t watch me while I’m sleeping. It’s weird!”
The next time is a particularly bad case in New York.
“You sure?” asks the bartender quietly, raising some glasses to polish.
“Peachy,” says Sam. “But you know, I feel like a movie. Jack, you up for more Disney?”
“Hey, where did these flowers come from?” Jack asks over dinner, and Dean nearly chokes on his pasta.
Mom used to tell him angels were watching over him. And isn’t that exactly what Cas has done? Looked after Dean, saved his sorry ass from hell, helped him out again and again? And now against all odds Cas is here, and it seems he’s here to stay.
The missing man’s toddler, who had been colouring at the coffee table, looks up. “Papa?” she asks, a wobble in her voice.
“Thanks,” says Dean. He takes a gigantic bite and makes sure to grin at Sam as he chews.
“Yeah,” says Dean without thinking, then he stiffens. “Dammit, Sammy!”
“Cas,” Dean whispers, hoarse.
“Fine.” Sam throws up his hands. “But think about it. That’s all I’m asking for.”
Er, ignore that last part.
It’s a drawing of Cas in all his suited, trenchcoated glory. He has a pair of bright crayon-pink butterfly wings sticking out of his back.
Several nurses and mothers look up. Cas looks the room over, and his eyes land on the crying baby.
It’s not just the local places, either. It starts happening when they’re out hunting, when they’re meeting new people.
“I mean, when was the last time you bought him flowers?” she demands.
He falls asleep next to Cas as the credits roll.
his brain asks, belatedly joining the party.
Dean flushes still brighter. “Nothing,” he says.
Because he’s a smartass, Cas puts on ‘Notting Hill.’ He slides a little closer to Dean. Their elbows are almost touching.
“Yeah. Sorry,” he says. He doesn’t dare turn his head even a couple inches—knows he’ll see Sammy giving his most obnoxious smirk.
“Dean.” Cas’s hand comes to rest on his shoulder, and he looks. The fear drops away for a moment, because all he can think about is Cas.
“We share a Netflix account,” Cas points out. “There are several rom-coms in your ‘watch it again’ list.”
He sees the moment she thaws a little, eyes raking across him as she reaches for the bottle. “Don’t think I’ve seen you here before.”
“What’s there to talk about?” Dean stares him down.
“Two queens, please,” says Dean.
“Dean,” Cas rumbles.
Dean feels himself shiver.
“Agents Clapton and Baker, ma’am.” Dean pulls his notebook out of his pocket (with difficulty, because Cas is shoved right up against him. Not that he’s noticed or anything).
And Dean should get mad at him for saying something like that, making a promise he might not be able to keep. But something in Cas’s voice stops him, because he’s reminded suddenly of the first time he met Cas, the dramatic entrance, shower of sparks and all. He feels the same sense of awe, feels like Cas can keep this promise, like Cas can do anything.
“Here you go, Dean.”
There’s a terrifying thought. Dean feels like he’s been drenched in ice water.
And he’s so tired that the words barely penetrate his head. He sees the gleeful look on Sam’s face, the look reserved exclusively for Dean’s humiliation, and Dean replays the conversation in his head.
And there it is; the feeling is back with a vengeance, and Dean feels a stupid smile on his face.
Cas looks down and gently eases his fingers open, slides the bottle onto the table.
“FBI, ma’am. Nothing to worry about. That’s my partner. We were just taking care of the… you know, disturbances in the hospital.”
“That’s not what I asked you.” Cas tilts his head. “You’re denying what you really want. I don’t understand humans sometimes.”
“I last saw him on Friday,” she answers, blinking rapidly.
“Yeah, I’m going to shower, then we can head out.” Dean goes for the shower, but Cas steps in front of him, placing a palm on his shoulder. Right where the handprint used to be.
But the bartender comes back then. “Sorry about that,” she says with a smile. “Hope you weren’t too lonely without me?”
“Cas, Sammy—I mean, Agent Nash, Agent Young, we should—come on.” Dean snatches up the crowbar and gets the hell out of there as fast as he can without actually running.
Dean stands, faster than he intended to. His chair screeches on the floor and everyone stops, looks at him.
But Cas has him. “It’s alright, Dean,” he whispers.
“Dean,” Cas rumbles. “Are you frightened? Your heart rate is significantly elevated.”
“All I’m saying is the gestures are nice. But talking can be good, too.”
Somehow, this makes Dean need to sit down.
Cas has already extended the basket of garlic bread.
Dean’s hands are still shaking when he parks outside the motel that evening. He spent a few hours that afternoon just driving, then he pulled over and drank beers by a lake. He would have been happy to stay there for the rest of the day—and the night, and the month—but they were supposed to leave town right after the hunt. Cas and Sam are waiting for him.
“As long as it involves violence and muscle cars,” says Dean.
"What the fuck Cas. Where the hell did you learn to do that?" Dean asks with an awed smile, still a bit out of breath from the best sex of his life.
"shh it's okay Dean" Cas soothes.
"holy fuck Cas" Dean breathes out helplessly. He has no idea what alternate dimension he's slipped into, but he never wants to leave.
Cas sucked him deeper and with more pressure this time, slowly jacking off the rest of Deans cock with his hand. Cas bobbed a bit, getting used to the feeling before taking Dean even further into his mouth.
"Is that for me?"
They did it. It was finally over, Chuck was defeated and Jack took his place as the new divine power. They were finally free of those strings over their heads and had a whole life of free will ahead of them. Of course this should be cause for celebration, they just saved the world and his unofficial kid was now God, but Dean couldn't feel anything. He just felt empty.
He looks back at Sam and Sam's just pointing at his own neck. Dean twists his neck to see and is met with what literally looks like the setting of a vamp orgy.
"sound so hot when you swear baby" Dean pants harshly "-'m close"
"Goodnight Dean"
Dean was left on the cold hard floor. Stunned and completely still, he sat with his back pressed against the dungeon wall, not comprehending, only accompanied by the ringing in his ears. His breathing started coming out short and hard as his hands started to tremble and the pressure behind his eyes began to build. He was defenseless to sudden anguish, the overwhelming feelings of dread and heartbreak as his mind caught up to the reality of situation.  He was gone. Taken right in front of his eyes. Dean did nothing to stop the sob that tore from his throat. His body trembled as his chest heaved with sobs and broken sounds and hot tears streamed freely down his cheeks. He cried as he pulled his knees into his chest and let his head fall into his hands-and he cried and he screamed and he cried more. Dean sobbed and hiccupped through his tears and snot and he screamed so loud and full of pain he did not notice the sound of his phone ringing over and over again from the cold floor next to him. And it kept ringing.
Dean gets up from the couch and pulls Cas with him.
"Dean"
Dean huffs out a laugh and smiles to himself as he descends the hall. Dean kicks open the door to his room and is met with the sight of a still naked former angel sitting up and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. Dean smiles fondly at him and offers him the coffee.
"Cas, I'm sorry, man. I know this must be hard for you. You didn't have to do that." Dean chewed on his lower lip.
Sam's mouth hung open for the second time this morning, god it was too early for this.
Cas put a knee to one side of Dean on the bed, partially straddling him as he pushed the flannel off Deans shoulders. Dean got the message and pulled it off the rest of the way and quickly pulled his shirt off with it, throwing it across the room. He reached for Cas's tie and loosened it, he thought idly what kind of uses this tie could have, but for now he just tossed it and started on Cas's buttons. Cas tore of the shirt and leaned down to connect his lips to Deans. He crawled, pushing Dean back up the bed until he met the headboard, their lips never once parting. Cas laid between Deans parted legs and let his hands wander up Deans naked torso. Dean shifted his hips up slightly seeking more contact, groaning when Cas caught his hip with his hand and pushed it firmly back into the bed.
Dean huffs a laugh and pulls Cas into his chest. "I love you too, sweetheart."
Dean halted his fork mid air and placed it back on the plate, frowning slightly. He didn't speak, he knew Cas would elaborate.
"I don't know anything Sammy, we haven't had a chance to talk yet." Dean placed the mugs down on the table and ran a hand through his hair. "He just appeared out of nowhere. Found him lying on the dungeon floor."
"He told me right before it took him-he told me so he could summon it" Deans fingers tranced along the hand print before he rested his palm directly over it.
"How long has it been since-" Cas cut himself off
Cas descended down Deans body, kissing both of his prominent hip bones and the inside of his thighs. He hovered over Deans clothed erection and let out a hot breath, mouthing at it over the fabric. Dean moaned softly at the warm feeling. Cas let his fingers dip below the band of his underwear and he pulled the down slowly, uncovering his weeping cock. Dean was so hard, it was driving him crazy, he was dripping wet, precum beading at the tip of his cock and running down the length. Cas bit his lip to hold in a moan at the sight. He had never done this before, though he new in theory what to do. You can't be as old as Cas and not know.
Six months have passed now, since Cas was sucked into that pile of black goo, and things have not gotten easier. Dean drinks just as much, to numb his pain and to keep the nightmares at bay, and he researches most days, others he works on his car, but now since so much time has passed, there's not much left read. Deans read every book in the library he thought could be remotely useful and still nothing. He doesn't know how much longer he can keep this up. He's barely slept, barely ate, an barely gone outside since that day, nothing more than required to keep him alive and even then Dean doesn't think he wants to be anymore.
He heard the sound of the chair scraping across the floor. "Dean" this time much closer.
Dean lets his head fall back to Castiels shoulder as the fatigue suddenly hits him.
Dean fell into a routine after that: wake up with a splitting headache, grab his morning coffee, sit in library reading through stacks of books looking for anything that could possibly bring Cas back, drink he until he passed out again, and repeat. Its been two weeks now, since he was found on the dungeon floor and Dean didn't know if he would ever feel any less gutted and hopeless. He woke up to his head pounding once again, groaning as he swung his legs off the bed and attempted to stand. He shrugged on his Dead Guy robe, not bothering to tie it closed around him before exiting the room. He shuffled into the kitchen where Sam was already sitting at the table, coffee in his hand.
"I said I wouldn't give up on you Cas, but its too hard-its just too hard without you," Dean reaches up and grips his hair hard, "and I'm so sorry Cas-I'm so so sorry and ill never forgive myself for how I treated you-I'll never forgive myself for letting you go thinking you aren't wanted, that you aren't loved-loved by Sam or by me" he's says crying openly now.
"You can have me. You have me. Thank you for coming back to me Cas."
"Sorry Dean nothing yet" Sam replied looking regretful.
to wanting to watch. Silver linings playbook. Becasuse Cas is just a sap for shit like that.
, the last thoughts on his mind as he drifted into oblivion.
Sam's heart shattered a bit at that, "I know, Dean. I'm sorry"
"I didn't want your sacrifice to be in vain but it just hurts so much man I cant do it anymore" he sobs.
Cas's eyes grew wide and his mouth parted slightly, he wasn't sure what to say.
Dean fries a couple eggs and tosses the remaining bread in the toaster as he waits for the coffee to brew. He placed the eggs and toast on the table and turned back to the coffee pot just as a beeped. He filled up the two mugs, Sam entering the kitchen just as he was turning around. Sam stood, barely past the door way, mouth open slightly, looking a little shocked.  He did not think this was in the realm of possible things he would see this morning or any time soon. Sam glanced towards the food on the table and then back at Dean. He noted the two mugs and raised an eyebrow.
Cas bucks his hips up meeting Deans down stroke and they're both so close now. The feeling in their stomachs getting tighter and tighter. Cas lets out a particularly loud moan, biting down on Deans neck.
"You get attacked last night or something?" Sam says barely suppressing a laugh, a mischievous smirk forming on his lips.
"it's really you" it's not a question, but Cas nods anyway.
"...I cant do it anymore" Cas vaguely registered the sound of a voice, he tries to focus on it but its too far away, it sounds familiar. "I need you Cas" the voice says again but this times its louder and Castiel knows immediately. This is Dean. He's unsure if this is a memory or trickery by the empty, surely Cas shouldn't be able to hear Dean from this plane. "I cant live without you anymore-" the voice says again, cutting out at the end. This feels wrong, Cas thinks. Something is very wrong, why is Dean talking to him and why can he hear it. There is so much pain and sorrow in Deans voice as he speaks that it has Castiel panicking, thrashing against his mental constraints.
"Cas" Dean chokes out, hot tears soaking his face and the collar of Cas's shirt.
Dean looks up to meet his eye, then watches as Cas pours the lube over his cock and brings his hand to stroke it, moaning softly. Once his cock is slicked up he leans back over Dean and pushes in. They both groan as the head pops past the rim and Cas waits a moment. He's breathing quite heavily, Dean notices.
So now, six months later, Dean doesn't know how much longer he can hold on.
"Yesterday was one year" Dean said suddenly very interested in the texture of the table
This was very different from their kiss in the kitchen, no less loving, but not at all innocent and Cas was loving it. Cas kissed back just as enthusiastically, tilting his head and deepening the kiss. Dean let out an approving hum and opened his mouth more to Cas. Cas walked Dean backwards until he hit the door with a thud, a groan escaping Dean at the contact. Cas took this opportunity to slip his tongue into Deans mouth, licking every crevice he could find before stroking along the side of Deans tongue. Dean keened a little at this, he ha no idea how Cas learned to do this. He was pretty sure the guy had very little experience in this area, but Dean wasn't a fool enough to focus on that right now. He met Cas's heated kisses, their tongues meeting in the middle and Dean slipped his hands into Cas's hair. Cas sucked Deans tongue into his mouth and Deans brain fried. He moaned into Cas's mouth and pulled his hand back, tugging on his hair. The growl that Cas released went straight to his groin. What the fuck is going on, he's going to loose his mind if this keeps up.
Sam just looked at him sadly, unsure on how to proceed, until he heard a sob rip out of Dean. Sam, very alarmed, quickly knelt down next to dean and took him into his arms. Deans sobs became louder until he was wailing uncontrollably.
"hhng-!" Dean moans, throwing his head back against the pillow, baring his neck.
Dean picked up the mugs again and handed one to Cas. The former angel inhaled deeply, sighing a bit as the steam wafted around his face. He took a sip and smiled to himself. Dean couldn't help but think it was stupidly endearing and he found himself smiling fondly at the sight.
"Good morning" Sam said as Dean padded further into the kitchen, walking towards the coffee machine.
"Let me out. Right now, I'll do anything" Castiel says frantically ignoring the empty's question.
Cas pistons his hips into Dean, hitting his prostate over and over again, until Deans all but drooling all over himself. Cas feels something warm and tight in his stomach and he knows he's getting close.
So Dean, alone in the library, looked towards the ceiling and prayed.
Dean wanted to say something, anything, but Cas spoke again. "Dean what happened last night?" Cas's voice was dripping concern and Dean knew there was no way he was getting out of this. He really hoped Cas would have simply forgotten or overlooked this part, but of course that angel misses nothing.
Cas nods and in one swift movement flips them around. Dean is staring wide-eyed back at Cas from his spot in his lap, mouth hung in surprise. How the hell Cas knew how to do that was beyond him, but the show of strength made his cock throb.
"That's not important right now. I don' know how he got here yet either, but he seem human now. He's still sleeping."
Dean really enjoyed their little family day together, but he was really itching for some alone time with the former angle. So he pulled Cas along beside him, down the hall and into Deans room. Cas wasn't sure if he would be invited into Deans room again for a second night in a row, but he certainly wasn't complaining. Dean shut the door behind him and flicked the lock, Cas raised an eyebrow at him and Dean just gave a small smile in return, though the look in his eye was a little less 'friendly'. Dean stepped towards Cas and looped his arms around his neck, pulling the former angel close. They stood chest to chest, noses brushing, and Dean gave him a bit of a shit-eating grin before pulling him into a searing kiss.
Sam had been helping Dean search for ways to get Cas back any opportunity he had these past two weeks, but so far they came up empty handed. Sam was concerned for Deans well being, but every time the younger Winchester tried to approach the subject Dean would shrug him off.
"Dean-fuck-I'm gonna come" He sounds wrecked.
"I'm not doing too good these day," Dean reaches down and grabs the gun resting on the floor, "not really since that day-and um yeah, I guess you can't see me, but I haven't been back in this room since then. I just see it over and over again-the banging on the door and the big black thing and then its just you standing there and then you being gone..." Dean trails off turning the gun over in his hand.
"I'm very old, Dean. I've seen a lot of things" Cas says serious and Dean can't help the bubble of laughter that rises from his chest.
Cas's gaze was clouded and half-lidded, but he nodded anyway, giving Dean one last peck on the lips before pulling away completely. They both kicked off their shoes as they stumbled over to the bed and Cas pushed on Deans chest until he fell back with a huff. Cas stood over him just admiring the way Deans chest rose and fell heavily and his face flushed, he panted slightly as he sat their gazing up at Cas with a bit of awe in this eyes.
Upon his God-hood, if you can even call it that, Jack restored balance to the world. He brought back everyone that Chuck has vanished and has vowed to keep his hands out of human affairs, promising that everyone could choose for themselves now, but not Cas. No, Cas hadn't been taken by Chuck, he entered the empty of his own volition and he was still there. Everything they have ever worked for has lead to this moment and now that it was over Dean didn't know what to do. Without any purpose, any apocalypse or end of the world around he corner, without anything for them to fight for what was Dean left to do? Especially now, without
"He loved me" was Deans quiet response, eyes never leaving the palm print.
The former angel reached for Deans belt and broke the kiss, looking down at Dean in a silent question. Deans lips were still parted and his eyes were glassy.
Dean looked up and met Sam's gaze for a moment before looking away, "I loved him-I love him so much it hurts Sammy" Dean took a deep breath before finishing "it hurts so bad and I don't know what to do"
Its exactly one year since that day. The world around them has been continuing on as normal blissfully unaware of what exactly transpired that day one year ago. Their friends returned to them and Dean was happy to have them back of course, but could barely stand to see them, even after all this time. Old friends like Garth or Charlie or Jody have come around a few times over the past year and Dean would make a brief appearance of course, but would stay hidden away in his room most of the time. He knows they're all worried for him, especially Sam, but there's nothing more Dean can do. What's the point in having a family and friends get together if Cas isn't there to be a part of it? What is the point of the free will the fought for if he can't choose the one thing he so desperately wants?
That's how Sam finds them a couple minutes later when he enters the kitchen, back from his run. Just Dean and Cas standing in the middle of the kitchen laughing. Sam smiles fondly at them.
"Yes Dean, it was much needed." Cas met Deans gaze finally.
Dean collects himself briefly to say, "so I just wanted to say my goodbye even if I'm just talking to a room" but his resolve crumples and he chokes out another sob, chest heaving as he holds his face in his hands, one still clutching the gun.
"Dean what happened?" Sam asked as he took in his brothers appearance. His face was shiny and wet as a few stray tears made traced paths down his cheeks.
. He's trying so hard to move, but can just barely twitch his fingers.
he chuckled a bit before continuing, "the empty did not seem to like that"
Dean couldn't believe what was happening. He knew this could be a trick, he should be checking for shifters or demons or whatever the hell could parade around wearing Cas's face, but Dean didn't care. This felt so real. Cas felt so real. So Dean held on a tight as he could, afraid Cas might disappear, slipping through his fingers once again if he so much as puts a hair of space between them. Vaguely Dean registers a wet feeling on his shoulder as Cas nuzzles into him and Dean just squeezes him harder. Dean never wants to let go again-he will never let Cas go again and Dean feels a wave of relief wash over him. Dean, all but sitting in Cas's lap at this point, let's himself be cradled into the angels chest and he can't keep it in any longer.
“What kind of flowers did you two have for your wedding?” she asks, nodding at Dean and Cas.
The damn flowers stare Dean down every meal, catch his eye every time he passes through the room.
For Dean can’t help but reflect that in fact, it has been a while—been quite a while since he’s hooked up with someone. Longer than he would ever admit to Sam.
Without even thinking, Dean’s asked her to wrap up four steaks. It’s only in the checkout line that the words really register, but it’s too late to go back and argue. Mortified, he pays for the groceries and goes home.
“Uh-” says Dean intelligently, somehow managing to blush harder.
The tailor’s eyes stab at him. “Not at all like the old suit! This is much more flattering. Sir, would you turn?” he adds to Cas, who obliges. “You see? Much better fitted.”
Well, there goes that idea. “Hey, Cas.”
“Did you have fun?” Cas asks quietly.
The bartender bites her lip nice and slow. “I don’t know. I try not to mix work and pleasure. I’ve made that mistake a couple more times than I should have.”
Sitting here, it’s too much, it’s not enough. His arm bounces on the bed until Cas reaches out to rest a palm against it. Then Dean goes still, has to take a deep breath before he dares meet Cas’s eyes.
Cas smiles at Claire. “Soon, then.”
“Hello, Dean,” says Cas.
Anyway, whenever they can, Sam and Dean swing by Sioux Falls on their way back to the bunker. And when they do, Dean calls Cas, who always comes to spend time with Claire.
Sam—who had probably been anticipating more of an argument—seems to get his steam back. “So what if he’s an angel? Why should that make a difference?”
And Dean’s pulse pounds; Cas can’t leave yet, he just can’t, not until Dean knows what the hell is going on.
Dean keeps his eyes fixed on the wheel, the road. He hears Sam and Cas get in, and he gets the car in gear.
Cas smiles at him, and Dean wants to enjoy it, but he can’t quite. He has to say it. “Sorry I left,” he mutters.
“Uh-huh,” says Sam, two syllables conveying about ten years’ worth of scorn. “And he’s told you that?”
“Yeah, I think you’d be a good father or whatever.” Dean shrugs. “It’s not a big deal. Can I shower now?”
And Sam cries more than the rest of them combined.
“Watching television,” admits Cas. “And I called Jack earlier.”
Dean does not enjoy it at all. The movie or the—the proximity to Cas.
“I don’t know,” Dean whispers. He feels like something is caught at the back of his throat—wait, shit. That’s not a feeling, that’s a piece of beef.
“He said he loves you. When he thought he was dying.”
Pretend nothing happened, Dean. Come on.
And just like that, Dean melts into him. He clutches at Cas, not daring to trust anything that feels this good.
“Dean,” Cas says quietly.
“I got it in Hell,” Cas says quietly. “Rescuing you. I was almost out and I was foolish enough to think that no demon would attack me with so many other angels around. It took me off guard.”
“Dean,” Cas gasps, his voice tight. “You have to
“He really didn’t think I’d ask you to do it, you know. He thought I was bluffing until I stepped in the door. And then, oh, and
Cas nods, flexing his wings. The motion causes more charred flakes to fall to the ground, and the black lines in his back seem to pulse with the movement.
, an awful, animalistic sound that Dean hasn’t heard since Cas pulled him away from all the tormented souls in Hell.
It takes a painfully long second, but then something gives. He jerks the blade lengthwise, up and down, all the while pressing in to scrape out the poisonous rot that’s pooling hot and viscous around the hand he’s using to keep Cas still.
“Dean.” That stupid soft, sad look in Castiel’s eyes. As if he’s trying to comfort Dean. Like it’s Dean’s feelings that matter here. “Even if there is, we don’t have time.”
“You know that last year, I… acquired some grace from other angels. Before I had mine back.” He waits for Dean’s nod, and then continues. “There are… reasons that angels don’t just go around stealing each other’s grace. The taboo, of course, but there are also physical risks. Running on someone else’s power, at best, it’s exhausting. At worst, excruciating.”
“Goddammit Cas, of course it’s important! How long have you been ignoring the fact that you’re fucking
He’s lying to himself, of course. There’s nothing that will ever make him okay again.
Castiel turns back to face him, leaning against the edge of the bed. He doesn’t meet Dean’s eyes.
He hops off the bed, standing over Dean, who scurries back on his knees before he’s able to force himself to stand. His back is pressed to the wall of his room, and he doesn’t have any weapons on him. Stupid, stupid, lulled into false security by the bunker and the guns he keeps stored in every single room, including here but they’re too far to reach now. His fingers scrape uselessly at the cement of the wall like they’ll uncover some hidden passage, as Not-Cas leans in so close that Dean can finally make out the blue in his bloodshot eyes.
He lets his left hand rest for a moment on Castiel’s miserably strained shoulders. A shoulder rub probably isn’t going to mean anything (even though Dean’s pretty damn good at those, if he does say so himself), but he can’t stomach the idea of letting this moment pass by without offering any sort of attempt at comfort.
Again the sensation of sticking his finger into an electrical sensation jolts its way up his arm. It hurts less this time, though, or maybe he’s just too preoccupied with the way Cas arches off the bed, almost dislodging Dean from where he’s straddling his legs, and practically
Dean presses Cas’s head against his shoulder, silently begging him to just rest for a minute, give Dean time to think. Cas’s arms tighten around him.
“It’s necessary. And it won’t kill me. The poison, left alone, though…”
And before Dean can even begin to think of an answer, the wings are flapping and Lucifer and Castiel is gone, leaving Dean alone in his room, still stained with blood and whatever poison Lucifer conjured up under Castiel’s skin.
He says this as he hauls Dean to his feet, arm around his shoulder, carrying more of Dean’s own weight than Dean himself. He repeats it over Dean’s objections as they stumble down the hall together to the bathroom, where he strips off Dean’s ruined clothes and guides him under a cool shower, scrubbing off the ash and the blood and the rot that Dean hadn’t even noticed he was covered in. He repeats it as Dean thinks about what a horrible brother he is, making Sam take care of him when he hasn’t even had time to process the news that his torturer is walking the earth once again; but the thought is distant, more like it’s something he thinks he should be thinking and feeling, but there’s nothing left for him to feel, and so it can’t really affect him.
Of course it’s his fault. He’s not even surprised.
“Very carefully, I hope,” Castiel deadpans. He sighs at the Look that Dean gives him. “You cut, Dean. At the base of the wings. You’ll have to dig deep to make sure you’re getting to all of the rot. When you see my grace, you’ll know you’ve gone deep enough.”
He stares at the rippling muscles of Castiel’s back, easily visible between the sparse feathers drooping down from Cas’s wings. The black lines of poison somehow only accentuate the beauty beneath them. It’s beyond fucked up that he’s thinking this way—but, in his defense, this is probably the longest Cas has ever been shirtless in front of him. A guy’s allowed to let him mind wander before he permanently mutilates his best friend, right?
“Cas? Cas, look at me.” Dean tries to meet Cas’s eyes as he rolls onto his knees, not wanting to stand or make any sudden movements that could make Cas feel threatened, but Cas’s eyes stay unfocused as he gasps for ragged breaths.
And so Dean continued on to the library where he spent the rest of the day hunched over old dusty books and beer bottles accumulating next to him. In the evening Dean would take a break, running his hands down his face and he would look up, towards where the sky would be and he would pray. He prayed everyday to anyone who would listen, he  would pray to Jack, but mostly he prayed to Castiel. Of course he wasn't sure Cas could hear his prayers, if he had to bet, he would wager that Cas could not in fact hear him, but he prayed none the less. Sometimes he would just talk, tell Cas about his day, how Sam is doing, but mostly he asked Cas to come back. Back to him. Tonight was one of those nights it seemed.
This got Deans attention. "What?" he croaked out, his voice hoarse from all the crying.
"Why should I do that, we had a deal" the empty replies
So Dean kept himself busy all day and waited for Sam to go to sleep. Sam bid Dean goodnight around 10:30, Dean nodded his head and they parted ways to their respective rooms. Dean waited, sitting on the edge of his bed for 45 minutes, making sure Sam is fully asleep before existing his room. Dean stood from the bed, grabbed his gun off the nightstand on his way out and descended the halls towards the dungeon. Dean swung open the heavy door and stepped foot in the dungeon for the first time since that day. He closed the door behind him, switched on the light and sat down on the floor, in same spot he sat for hours after Cas pushed him away and took a deep breath.
Dean reaches over the side of the bed for a discarded piece of clothing and used it to wipe them down quickly before tossing it back on the floor.
Dean turned back to Cas. "Hey buddy, you sleep okay?"
The sound of skin slapping skin is so loud, only to be rivaled by their wanton moans. Dean is slamming down on Cas's lap, mouth hung open, drool running down his chin and neck as Cas jerks him.
"I need you Cas-I cant live without you anymore, I don't want to live without you anymore and I'm sorry, Cas-really-I know this isn't what you would've wanted for me, but I can't breathe without you Cas"
His eyes found a familiar coat hanging in his open closet, his eyes seeming to have adjusted to the darkness in his room could faintly make out the shape of the bloody hand print on on the sleeve. Dean swallowed harshly and his eyes stung, but he couldn't lift his gaze from that bloody hand. The mark lay on the same spot Cas first touched him-his soul-when Cas lifted him out of hell all those years ago. It was the last piece of Cas he had, he was sure he would never wash that jacket again, then Cas would truly be gone. Dean would never forgive himself for all he had put Cas through, all the anger and the blame, he never deserved Cas and Cas never deserved that kind of treatment. Even in Cas's final moments couldn't do anything, as Cas looked into his eyes and bared his soul to him, sacrificing himself for Dean once again and Dean didn't do anything. He just stared. He stared as Castiel told him he loved him and he stared as the empty took him away.
