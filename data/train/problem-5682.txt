Rogers sighs tiredly and takes his arm, they walk a few minutes, entering one of the Reed Richards farm establishments, it was a place away from the town and Richard’s residence.
The Sheriff get up, cleaning the hay from his naked body, trying not to panic like the other man while he remember exactly how they end up there.
The previous day, the sun was right at the top of the sky when Anthony Stark entered the bar, hearing sounds of wasted men arguing, others playing cards, some women staring with shameless smiling in the second floor.
"We have to make a plan" someone had said but Rogers ignored them, getting off the ship and throwing his shield at the closest enemy to Tony, the shield bounced off a wall and get back to his arm, Stark was impressed.
“I'm glad you are not jealous then because I'm really interested to know about the protest they plan to do”.
He never took off his suit or even the mask and when Anthony found out about this, he did not hesitate to keep his secret identity and play for a while to be two people, to be honest, it was cute seeing that Rogers was halfway through the movie with his cell phone in hand, waiting for a message or a call, with a finger on the button and never daring to do so.
“You know what you're doing wrong, we are a team and you always want to be a one man show, even when we watched movies you choose every time" and now it all made sense, Steve's cheeks turned red, because Tony had played the whole theater well, now he realized, every day he was there by his side, even though Steve had missed him he was always with him.
"You should come with me to drink more often, Sheriff, they do not seem to behave like dogs when authority is near," said the girl looking and winking at him. "Or we could drink at my place."
A high-caliber shot distracted them, the blonde fell to the ground and Tony saw red. Red from Steve's blood staining his suit and red from the anger because no one dared touch his Captain. Rogers turned to look at him, taking off his mask, he searched his gaze quickly and found it. Tony now was able to stand up, which of course did not seem a good idea to Steve who yelled at him to duck, but Stark ignored him, walked towards the attacker, who was aiming at his teammates' ship, and before it fired, caught his attention.
“Don't "Tony" me, it's your only excuse when you do not know what to say, I'm fed up, Sharon has been months behind you and you don’t do anything, you could make her think you love another woman”.
"I missed your touch" the brown-haired man confessed, although they were together every day, fighting was obviously not the same to have him like this. They soon kissed more passionately, the Captain carried him to the large sofa.
Tony opens his mouth to very loudly and fervently tell them what he thinks about that when Gerald gambols into the room, a large dead spider in his mouth, which he deposits at Tony’s feet like a sacrifice at an altar. The puppy spies Pepper and Rhodey, then spends the next few minutes giving them a thoroughly welcome greeting.
But try as he might, Tony can’t pin down the exact meaning of the face Steve is making now. A large part of that might be due to the fact that Steve’s features get progressively blurrier and blurrier the harder Tony tries to focus on him.
Tony wants to sob. He keeps waiting for the day when thinking of Happy finally stops feeling like he’s acquired another set of shrapnel inching their way towards his heart, cutting into his tissues and muscles and vital internal organs. He’s still waiting. He’s still mourning Happy. He thinks he’s going to be mourning Happy forever.
The people who glimpse him during the battle call it a miracle, call it divine intervention, call it a sign from God. The Sentinel of Liberty, the Living Legend, the American Dream rising from the dead and beating back the alien armada at their doorstep. News crews have the headline circulating globally in minutes: CAPTAIN AMERICA ALIVE!
The script is erratic and nigh illegible at some places where Clint must have struggled to write them. Tony smooths out the creases of the lined notepaper, refolds them, and tucks them back into their envelope. He feels suddenly enervated, wanting nothing more than to lie down on the mattress, pull the duvet over his face to block out the rest of the real world, and drift off to dreamless sleep. He doesn’t have the zeal or the verve to read through what Thor or Peter or anyone else has to say to him – whether they be words of clemency or choler. He wants to let the feelings and emotions brought to the surface after reading Clint’s letter be tomorrow’s problem.
“So… you and Colonel Rhodes… and Miss Potts…” Steve seems to be choking on his own tongue. Tony takes pity on him.
Tony’s blue eyes sting. “It might already be too late,” he says. “There are some actions we can’t take back, that we won’t
“Fine,” Rhodey says, rankled. “I won’t talk about Rogers and you won’t force me to bring you up on sexual harassment charges. Are you happy now, you Man-child?”
Steve is silent for a very long moment. Tony gives him a challenging look, unwilling to be the one to lose their staring contact. In his lap, Gerald seems to feel neglected and whines for attention. Tony scratches the puppy behind the ears, eyes still on Steve. Steve’s blue eyes are dark and shadowed with profound emotion, something troubled and tired. The super soldier serum stops him from getting bags under his eyes, but Steve has the restless, jittery vibe of someone who has endured many sleepless nights. His blond hair has been hand-combed, but still looks a bit mussed from wearing a helmet. His hands rest on his knees. Every bit of him is tense, the cords of muscle in his shoulders and arms standing out tautly.
“I almost didn’t recognize you,” Steve says, giving Tony an argutely sagacious look that makes him feel like he’s being x-rayed.
Gerald darts out of the house before Tony can shut him inside again. Gerald takes one look at Steve, and his tail instantly rises, tremoring slightly. He bares his teeth, growling in what is supposed to be a menacing way but mostly just seems cute. Despite himself, Tony has to force his lips not to twitch.
Rhodey responds with an attachment: Two pictures side-by-side – the cabin and the four-seater swing set an indistinguishable baby-blue square one the left; and a picture of an actual blue square on the right.
Commander Roger’s (God, Tony still can’t get use to thinking that) uniform is a darker blue, a large white star in the center of his chest against white stripes wrapping around his torso, the only color a line of red down the outside of his legs. He looks intimidating, radiating a palpable sense of disapproval and mutiny. He makes no attempt to hide his displeasure, and around him, an expanding circle of previously celebrating onlookers grow subdued.
“I did tell you, Steve.” All at once, the anger that fills Tony drains out of him, leaving him feeling hollow, and he collapses back into his chair. “You wouldn’t listen.”
me. I was supposed to be your best friend, Tony. But the first time I even heard about the SHRA was right before Maria Hill –
Tony turns to look at him, still speaking in that horribly empty tone. “I don’t fall in love with the people I can’t bear to lose, Steve.” A single tear slips down his cheek. “It hurts too much.”
Happy’s pajamas still smell like his favorite laundry detergent – cleanliness and aloe. It’s a cheap brand that Tony can’t remember off the top off his head. Tony wonders if Pepper still keeps all of her husband’s clothes, if she can bear to throw any of them away, if they’re gathering dust in taped over boxes in the storage closet, or are they still hung and folded in the wardrobe, if she washes them periodically so that they still retain Happy’s smell. Tony visualizes Pepper and Rhodey sorting through Happy’s clothes, deciding which to keep for themselves and which to put away, and feels a rush of shameful envy and simultaneous guilty relief.
In New York, Sharon Carter dreams and memories flit through her mind in sharp little pieces – the panicked screams of the crowd, the shoving and the trampling as they flee to relative safety, a gun with the barrel lit up red, her finger pressing down on the trigger.
“Colonel Rhodes.” Steve gets to his feet, eyes flicking down to the suitcases. “Tony didn’t mention you were planning to stay.”
Tony had worked at a club while he was in university and med-school, had been really good at breaking subs once upon a time. Steve was different though, Tony didn't know
explain what I'm going to do to you." At Steve's tense shoulders Tony simply waived for him to take a seat. "Don't worry, I'm not going to explain it too much. I just,
One of Tony's hands went up to Steve's back, harshly dragging his nails down it. Steve cried out at the pain, and then at the feeling of his dick pulsing but not able to orgasm.
Steve immediately gasped and toppled forwards, landing face first in the pillows as he clutched at his chest. Tony rolled him onto his side so he didn't suffocate himself as he spasmed and desperately tried to get air into his lungs. There was a thick layer of cum on the bed under Steve, but his cock was still hard after orgasming.
Steve felt rage flash in his mind. He wished that his mother could just be blunt, just cut him out of the family without having to play these stupid games. He wasn't mad that he wasn't invited to Thanos' wedding, he was mad that his mother thought he was stupid enough to actually go along with what she was saying.
Tony's face drained of color and Steve nodded. Steve hadn't talked a lot about them, but he figured that Tony had at least gathered the gist. "Are you going to be okay?" Tony reached his hand out to put it on Steve's upper arm and Steve flinched away. Tony retracted his hand with a frown.
Tony pressed down on the back of Steve's head, forcing his face into the pillow for one second, two, three, ten seconds before he pulled Steve back up, the man trying desperately to regain his breathing through only his nose. It sounded harsh and labored. Tony was attentive though, he listened closely to make sure that the gag didn't need to be taken out.
"You're being very good for me tonight." Tony mused and Steve muttered around the gag. Drool dripped down his chin as he tried to speak and Steve moaned at the feeling of humiliation, not being able to control himself from drooling.
"Yeah!" He agreed and adjusted his grip on the well worn handle of his cello case. It felt good to have it in his hand again. He hadn't gotten very much time to practice since Tony hadn't actually wanted him to play until just a couple of days ago, but Steve had enough music memorized to play for an hour at least, and if not he had a wire stand and assorted music in his case.
"I'm gonna go get you some ice." Tony said and then slipped out of the bed. Steve watched him go, he had slept in his jeans and this was his first time in Steve's house, but he sounded confident in the fact that he could find the fridge and the ice.
Going back to playing for a moment, Steve took some deep breaths. His chest seized up again for a second and he frantically looked around the room one more time.
Sorry this chapter is short and late! I really didn't want their to be sex in this chapter and that's usually what makes them so long!! I hope you all still like it xoxo
Tony maneuvered Steve onto his stomach, pulling the man back onto his knees, his elbows holding himself up on the bed. Tony put his hands on either of Steve's cheeks and spread his ass apart. It was glistening with lube and Tony put his head down to give a tentative lick.
Steve wasn't paying attention to any of that, his eyes were fixated on the four thin rivulets of blood that dripped down his chest. Each of them stopping before they even got to his navel. He brought one of his fingers up to prod at the cut and a squirt of blood covered his finger.
' does that make sense?" Steve nodded. "Finally, don't call me by my name during this. Call me literally anything else: sir, master, daddy if you want, you could even call me doctor."
"Auditions aren't fun if there's no competition. Rest that hand Steve." Loki said and Steve stammered through a thank-you and then said good-bye to both of them.
He slipped himself out of his pants and took a hold of his cock, feeling a pit of upset pool in his stomach that made his cock jump. Steve jerked himself fast, faster than he probably ever had before. He bit at his bottom lip hard and leaned back against the wall by his bed, trying to just get this over with.
Slotting himself in-between Steve's legs, Tony pulled Steve's hard cock out, also further stiffening at the cool air, and then latched his mouth onto Steve's left nipple. He put both of his hand on Steve's hips, letting his cock furtively rub against Tony's shirt, streaking it with thin fluid.
Steve nodded. "Yeah, I'm good with everything." Steve said and he didn't miss the way Tony looked at him after he said that.
"Is that all? You can drop by before we close and I'll have it waiting at reception for you." Tony said and Steve felt like he could hear disappointment in his voice. Steve panicked for a moment, trying to decide whether or not he should go forward with what he was planning on saying.
"One last thing: the wedding is set for next August, in Hawaii. I'm sure that with your busy schedule and salary you won't be able to make it. Which is unfortunate of course, but Thanos will understand."
He saw Bucky's name flashing on the phone and rushed to answer it after that. His phone said it was almost eight, rehearsal was at eight thirty so Steve would be late unless he jogged, but he was only just dropping off the note and explaining what had happened to Coulson.
He grabbed at the flesh of Steve's hips and pulled him back harshly, setting a quick and unforgiving rhythm.
"Again? You know when we went in on that place I envisioned more late night partying going on their than
Calmly, he walked back to Tony's room and tried to find a shirt that could somehow cover his neck. He had to settle on a black windbreaker zipped all the up, even though it looked like it was fairly toasty outside today. Steve sighed and shook his head, trying to remind himself that no one would be able to see his neck, no one would know about it.
Steve did as ordered and sat with his back straight, better for what Tony was about to do. "Take a deep breath."
Tony's name made Steve freeze up for a moment. He had a dark mark right above his hip, a green bruise by now. Later on Friday night Steve had even been able to see the teeth marks etched into his skin. He had another reason to call Tony aside from the Doctor's note that he needed, but Steve hadn't been able to work up the courage for that.
"Well, it was more like I was naturally pretty smart so they didn't pay attention to me, and then every once in a while they pulled me out of the dark to show their friends how smart their kid was."
As he felt himself nearing orgasm he grabbed the second object that he had planned. It was a Buck Knife, perfectly sharp, perfectly clean.
"That certainly is unfortunate. Perhaps luck will find us, but if it doesn't I will send your gifts as well."
the way I did even as it was obviously making you uncomfortable." Tony was obviously trying to censor himself for the work place, there were probably people around him as he apologized for what he'd said to Steve.
Steve screwed his eyes shut and leaned against Tony's side, Tony put an arm around the larger man as Steve rested his head on Tony's shoulder. "You said you hadn't done that before, but you have done other
He hadn't been with a lot of people in his life. His parents had made sexual acts out to be the worst form of depravity and Steve became very anxious whenever he was praised for things that he did, or really just talked about at all during sex. He tried not to let it get to him though.
Tony tapped on his shoulder, earlier than he would have expected and Steve struggled to form words. "Steve is on his hands and knees." He finally said, prefacing it with a
Steve could feel Tony's thighs tensing up, obviously close to orgasm. He pulled Steve's head in all the way once more, Steve's nose being crushed against Tony's stomach, and then a stream of come was pouring down Steve's throat, almost bypassing his taste buds entirely. A thin dribble of it fell onto his chin as Tony pulled out and Steve licked it up.
"Sure, yeah I'll tell the boys that you still aren't feeling well. Might even have been a little weird if you showed up to a bar crawl but were too 'ill' to attend practice." Bucky stood up straight and looked like he was going to walk away and grab his coat for a moment, but then he settled back down at the island and reached across it to grab Steve's good hand in both of his. "Listen Steve, I know you've got something on your mind, whether it's just the hand or it's something else, just know that I want you to feel better. You've never been one to talk about your emotions, but I'm always open man. I just don't want you to suffer alone through whatever this is."
"Oh? Tell me what else Steve." Tony's voice sounded so authoritative, so incredibly domineering that Steve almost felt like he was going to get hard again, but he didn't, his cock still sat limply on his lap.
Tony was working a lot and Steve was getting back into the groove of being able to play again. They just hadn't had time to talk for a while.
"Steve!" Loki called, noticing T'Challa's line of sight. Both men were dressed smart and Steve remembered that Loki's studio'd had a recital tonight. Steve had never understood how the man was able to maintain the symphony full time and also year-round private lessons for advanced students, it seemed almost superhuman--but Loki had always been a wealthy step-above everyone in the symphony because of it. In a way it was why Steve kind of respected Loki, he did work
Tony let out a long sigh and scrunched his face up as he dug the heels of his hands into his eyes, nodding all the while.
Steve blushed but didn't respond. They walked along for a moment longer. "Aren't you a neurosurgeon?" He asked, remembering what Clint had said.
Tony takes one look at them and says. “The last time I checked, I was a fully functioning and self-supporting adult with extraordinary mental acuity, and thus perfectly capable of navigating my own personal relationships.”
"No it's fine, one sec." He put the phone back down at looked over at Tony who just gave him a nod. "Yep! I can do that! See you soon Peg." She gave him a happy goodbye and then finally hung up.
Tony was right, Steve literally couldn't feel the pain over the pleasure he was currently experiencing. Tony very quickly set the scalpel back on the table and when back to stroking Steve's cock, faster now, setting a brutal rhythm. One of Tony's hands gripped harshly at Steve's shoulder as he anchored himself.
Tony gathered up some clothing that would be easy to get on Steve as he simultaneously called a cab. This place was foreign to him, it was where Steve was hit and bloodied and fucked, and of
"No need. We don't do outpatient here. Surgery happens and then they're ambulanced to Saint Teresa which is just two blocks up." Tony explained and turned all the lights on, bringing one in close to Steve's hand. Tony pulled over a rolling table which elevated Steve's hand so Tony could see it closer. The man pulled a pair of glasses out of his breast pocket and put them on. Tony became about twenty times as attractive with glasses on and Steve's breath caught momentarily in his chest. This wasn't really the time for him to be thinking about how hot his doctor is though. "You good with needles kid?" Tony asked, pulling open a drawer near him.
Bucky sighed. "Do you wanna go to the studio? I'm playing second viola for Pete's viola concerto and I really need to practice." He stood up and offered a hand to Steve who took it and stood as well.
Steve's mind was moving at a hundred miles an hour, thinking over everything that had happened. He'd almost thrown up more than once over the course of the hour, but had thankfully been able to stop himself. Finally though, he'd had to use his phone as a distraction from his mind.
"Oh my parents never want to see me again. I was just passive aggressively uninvited to Christmas." He explained and Tony looked fairly concerned.
He'd gotten several odd jobs around town. A few private lesson gigs, more were trickling in, and a junior high that needed an assistant in the music department. All jobs that Steve was used to finding. The symphony'd had a concert a few nights prior which Steve had ended up seeing Tony at as he'd come with Clint's girlfriend. They hadn't sat with one another, and Steve hadn't tried to initiate conversation.
Tony's office was the one right next to their studio, that was how Clint and Natasha had ended up meeting, on the street outside the buildings. The practice looked more like a couple of townhouses fused together, and Tony unlocked the front door for them, turning around to lock it behind them. The inside was immaculate, a place that oozed money. There were hardwood floors and brushed steel fixtures. A laser cut sign read '
"Oh nonsense, Tony's around here somewhere, he can take a look at your hand. Clint why don't you wait here and I'll go find him." She suggested and then was gone before any of them could respond.
"No." Steve rushed out and then scolded the urgency that he'd heard in his voice. "I haven't been able to concentrate very well."
like all of that stuff, but Tony supposed he'd even been uncomfortable when he'd called him a 'pillow princess' and it's not like that was a particularly obscure thing. "That's fine, do you want to sit down for a second. I can help you button your shirt." Tony offered and Steve dropped his arms to his side so Tony took that as an invitation to do up the rest of his shirt. He was careful to touch Steve's skin as little as possible.
"No, no, no, no, you can't do that! You don't even know me." Steve argued and Tony just grumbled and pulled Steve along by the forearm out of the bathroom.
"Let's go get in the cab Steve, come on, I'll take you home." Tony assured and pulled Steve up off the couch. He didn't even have shoes on but Tony didn't have the patience to find them.
"Earlier," Tony mumbled into Steve's ear, taking another risk with the dirty talk. "When I said you didn't seem sickened by the sight of blood?" Tony said and Steve made an 'a-ha' sound but kept his eyes closed, blissed out. "You looked so turned-on, your pupils were blown, and you were red. You were
He let go of Steve's cock and moved back up so that he could rut himself against Steve, both of their members sliding against one another's, incredibly slick from both the heat of the room and their arousal.
-also very fun fact, i made a pun because phil coulson is the conductor of the PHILharmonic. very funny, thank you.
Thankfully he was salaried and had plenty of sick-days accumulated, but he also didn't really want to laze around the apartment for the next few months.
One of Tony's hands circled around Steve's throat and Steve momentarily sputtered, choking on his spit, but then swallowing it before he was in danger. Tony pressed on either side of Steve's throat and the man groaned.
Steve looked down at his chest, there was a clear bandaid over the cut, hiding all evidence of what they'd done. Steve could almost imagine that it'd been nothing worse than a cat scratch. Truly the cut hadn't been more than that, Steve couldn't even remember feeling any pain. Perhaps the blade had been too sharp and had just cut him with ease. Steve didn't focus on the bandage for long. He noticed that his hand had been tenderly rewrapped and the brace was a constant pressure around it. Maybe he'd been out for a while.
They kissed for a long time, Tony's hands slowly starting to undo the buttons of Steve's shirt as Steve just lounged back against the couch cushions and let Tony have his way. Completely pliant as usual. The only time Steve ever really touched Tony was when he wanted something, or was trying to speed things up. Tony loved it. At first he was worried about having so much control over Steve, didn't think he would like it, but it was like Steve had opened up some other faucet of him that he didn't know existed. Tony yearned to be controlling, of having Steve just lay down as Tony did
His fingers slipped for a moment and he hit a note he hadn't anticipated, forcing him to pull off a last second bit of jazzy improv that didn't fit in the piece at all; but no non musician would notice. Hopefully. He rushed through the rest of the piece and very quickly switched to something that he knew from memory, so he could go back to surveying the crowd.
To Tony's credit, he did actually get Steve to the bedroom without really being able to see where he was going, but the way he through Steve down on the bed was both sexy and showed that he wasn't getting carried for much longer than that.
He'd been playing for nearly an hour and a half, had only stopped when people were giving speeches. His third finger was starting to ache and he was beginning to use his fourth finger instead. A good sign that he should stop playing.
It was when Steve's eyes were closed that Tony finally brought his other hand forward. He felt his own cock throb at the thought of what he was about to do, and Steve opened his eyes just in time to see Tony drag the scalpel across his chest in a half-inch cut.
"Put your legs around me, let's see if I can carry you to the bedroom, my bet is 'no'." Tony said and that bit of humor made Steve chuckle and feel immensely better.
"Mhmm." Tony responded softly, pressing a kiss to Steve's back before his hands reached around and Steve had to open his mouth to allow for the ball to be inserted. It was a very big one so his mouth hopefully wouldn't ache too badly after this. "You won't be able to safeword with this, so if you want me to stop hit the bed three times, okay?" Tony asked and Steve nodded as Tony adjusted the strap in place behind his head.
" Steve breathed out, panicked. "I can't afford that, neither can my career." He rushed out, feeling his heart start to flutter and his breathing get quicker.
"Of course I do! I already planned your seat because I just didn't even notice you hadn't RSVP'd! Do you have a plus one though? I kind of need to know now because we're almost out of seats." She explained, her voice suddenly much happier.
"And you can throw a party in the other room while I cry and play all 24 caprice's." Steve shrugged. They would walk together for a while before Bucky headed off to their shared apartment and Steve up the few blocks to their studio. Technically, they didn't need to share an apartment. They made a decent income from performing. They worked full time in the concert season and then offered lucrative private lessons during the off-season. The only problem with their salaries was that they couldn't afford someplace near the hall and their studio on their personal income, so living together was just a better option. Clint had often crashed at theirs before he got his girlfriend anyway. Steve did kind of wish that he had more privacy in his life, he was constantly worried that Bucky was just going to walk into his room or something. He hadn't been afforded any privacy when he was growing up, which had left a lot of scars on his pshyche.
"You guys don't have overnight staff?" He questioned as he was led into the surgery room and made to sit on a bed in the center. The operating theater was fairly small, but everything was set up like it was ready for the next time Tony needed it.
The thought of what had happened crossed his mind every once in a while but it didn't throw him into a panic or anything.
Resolutely Steve grabbed his phone, keys, and wallet and left the apartment. He shot Bucky out a quick text saying that he would be home late, but didn't elaborate on where he was going. Tony's house was even more uptown, so it was probably a thirty minute walk. Once he got on the street he felt a little bit of tension leave his shoulders,
He got himself dressed just as quick and then met Steve back in the living room, helping him into a pair of sweatpants and a long sleeved shirt, Steve was positively
' to himself before downing the rest of his drink. "You promise you'll tell me, yeah? If I do something you don't like?"
Steve looked down at himself for a moment and then up at Tony, and he imagined what it would be like sitting in a crowded restaurant, surrounded by people and trying to keep himself hard. He simultaneously wanted to orgasm and cry. "I can't." He finally forced out and then sped up his hand,
" The man asked as the door was opened wider. Steve only mustered a half-hearted response to his roommate as Tony soldiered him into the room and tried to ignore the stares from Steve's friends. And of course Steve's friend was dating his boss, so it made sense that this cruel world would make Natasha Romanov also present in the room, giving him a very concerned look amid the three other men sitting near her.
"Yeah sorry, I have to go to a local middle school tomorrow." He answered sheepishly as Tony led him by the arm out of the restaurant and out onto the crowded New York street. Tony immediately pulled them flush against the building front and clutched an arm around Steve's waist.
He took the glass of wine and then his hand shook slightly as he remembered that his parents were in the room. Steve gently set the glass on a random table. Tony fixed him with a confused look. Steve's parents were staunchly against drinking, he'd been pretty sure alcohol was like a class A drug until he was 16.
"God I'm so fucking stupid." Steve bemoaned his ill-fortune and stared down at his hand. Tony got up and searched through his cupboards until he found the brace he was looking for.
"Works at the private practice Nat owns. I thought he was just a neurosurgeon, but who knows. Guy's fucking crazy." Clint explained and grabbed a champagne flute as a waiter sashayed past them. It always surprised Steve how overly-sexualized things were at these events. It wasn't like anyone was scantily clad, but the way the event staff walked around was seductive at best.
The walk out of the clinic was slightly awkward. Tony was walking beside him but didn't really say anything and Steve was still red with embarrassment and ecstasy. Pepper wished them both a good evening as she was getting ready to leave, and then they were outside, the cool air calming Steve.
"Wow, you're quite the visionary Buck. The BIP is really going to go places as a philharmonic with five members and no woodwinds." Steve rolled his eyes and picked his cello up by the smooth metal handle, his fingers fitting into the well-worn grooves. He'd had the same instrument since he was twenty, so it was just about four years old.
"Hey! Steve are you okay?" Tony stood up too, putting his cock away and taking a step towards Steve who just took a step backwards.
Steve instantly felt something change as he watched the cut open. It was much bigger than the first one, and then, just as he had spoken in third person earlier, he felt completely detached from his body. The ache of his back was gone, the burn of his lungs, and most of all he couldn't feel the cut opening on his stomach even though it must have hurt like a
"Yeah I never told you when I moved into my new apartment. When's the wedding? Where's the wedding?"
The three of them (Steve, Tony, and the cello) piled into the rental car, Steve very gently laying it in the backseat, Tony had half a mind to think that he was going to strap it in with a seat belt.
While Tony scratched with one hand, he used his other to stroke himself, trying to get himself fully hard again. When he was satisfied Tony pulled away, giving Steve a cruel slap to his ass before grabbing a condom. He supposed it was kind of beside the point since he'd hadn't used one for the blow job, but oh well.
"Steve." Tony offered him a brilliant, wide smile and motioned for him to take a seat. "Close the door first would you? Just give me a minute I've got to finish some forms." Tony instructed and Steve sat immediately, folding his hands awkwardly in his lap and looking around at all the framed documents on Tony's walls. He hadn't really gotten a good look at the place the last time he'd been here.
do with a new sub were working to his advantage. The knife-play namely. Tony had never done that before, never had someone actually interested. He'd assumed that Steve would become more reclusive after that fact, but Steve actually seemed more open, and Tony really didn't know what to make of that.
"What? Why?" Steve asked immediately after the last rule. He liked calling Tony by his name, and he didn't know if he would be able to say the other ones.
" He tried to reason out loud as he finally got a few of his shirt buttons done. He turned away from Tony and walked back out into the hallway of the medical center, leaving Tony in his office. He head felt jumbled and his body felt both hyper-active and incredibly lethargic since he'd just had an orgasm.
When he looked back up at Tony's face, the man had a knowing smirk on his lips and Steve immediately got out of his briefs as well. Tony climbed on top of him on the bed and Steve spread his legs so that Tony could fit in, but Tony just sat back on his haunches, leaning over to the beside table to grab some things. "Flip over on your stomach."
wanted to cry when he noticed that Steve's bandage had come undone and there was now blood on his shirt. He leaned Steve back against the couch like puddy and redressed the bandage tighter with his trembling fingers.
"Hey man!" Bucky called as he deposited his cello on the rack and then unceremoniously dropped his bag of music next to it, if this had been a cartoon Steve was fairly sure that bag would have exploded and all the music would have gone flying.
" Steve drawled out, the words getting muddled and elongated as his hips canted through his orgasm, spilling himself in long ropes on Tony's bed spread as Tony slowly brought himself to completion. Just the sounds Steve was making alone were almost enough to finish him, but the feeling of his hole fluttering through his orgasm is what finally made Tony cum as well. He continued to thrust his hips into Steve as he finished, even as Steve was basically just a droopy incoherent mess on the bed.
He moved quickly up to two fingers, and then three. He lingered with three fingers for a while. Tony alternated between stretching Steve until he gaped and brutally thrusting the fingers into him. Steve canted his hips down to meet every thrust.
Steve had to shift awkwardly when the shirt finally came over his head, and Tony had to crane his neck to lick at Steve's collarbone and used both of his hands to tweak the nipples. Steve's hips rocked up into his own and Tony grinned.
The handjob went on for a long time, Steve getting more worked up as it went on. His eyes were distant and his head was tipped back against the cushions, Tony wondered if he even remembered the scalpel at this point.
Steve was pushed against the kitchen island which dug in harshly to his back as Tony grabbed his wrist and held his hand down on the island and used his other hand to push his hip back. Their kiss was slightly more coordinated than the last time and it gave Steve time to marvel over just how good of a kisser Tony was. The mans lips were soft, his teeth obviously freshly brushed, and his stubble pressed hotly against his own clean-shaven face.
Tony felt his throat go kind of dry. He shouldn't be caught off guard by questions like this, but coming from Steve they were just bothering him. "I do, maybe another day we can try them. You should recover from this though."
He set his phone on the side table and looked up at Tony who was carrying the box again. He didn't put it under the bed again but instead set it next to the bed, Steve stared at it in confusion. "Turn on your other side." Tony told him and Steve furrowed his brows. "I'm going to open the box and I don't want to panic you."
didn't like to be choked, so Tony would ease him into it. Though if there was ever someone to get erotically choked by, it would be a surgeon.
He felt kind of weird walking around the clinic while other, much busier people bustled around him. No one questioned him, but he still felt out of place.
"Hey Steve, yeah, uh, where the hell are you?" Bucky asked, his voice quickly going from casual to heated. Steve did feel kind of bad that he'd told Bucky he didn't feel like going out and then had gone out anyway.
Tony hit him again, but he wasn't eliciting the same reaction from Steve as he had been with his hand. He tapped twice on Steve's shoulder.
"I am! Please, I'm not good at..." Steve didn't know how to articulate his limitations so he just shook his head. "Please, just do what you want with me." He finally said which sent a shiver through his body and made his cock jump. A predatory look overcame Tony and he tightened his grip around Steve.
Steve pulled his phone out of his pocket after he did the jacket back up and absent-mindedly scrolled through Instagram. He glanced up at Tony every few moments just to watch him. He liked the glasses that Tony wore while he was doing his work, it made him look very professional. Steve wetted his lips without really thinking about it just as Tony looked up to make eyecontact with him, and offered him a small wink.
and so on. Steve didn't really know who he was looking for, so he simply clicked the button when it said for scheduling appointments, at least then he would be connected with a real person.
"Oh, do tell." Steve encouraged as he wrote down the number of another middle school that he needed to call. It worked really well having their own studio, parents felt more inclined to drop their kids off with a stranger if it seemed like a professional setting.
Halfway through playing a piece by Bartok, during a particularly nasty section that included a key change during a sixteenth note run, Steve noticed someone in the crowd. Hi mother.
The first thing that Steve felt was very unexpected. Tony's hand slapped his ass, no harder than usual, but he hadn't seen it coming at all and so his body jolted at the sudden stimulation.
"Well you sure look like you're in a bad mood." Bucky remarked when he finally found Steve in the crowd of arrivals. The gala was held in a high-end event center that could hold about fifteen hundred people. The men wore mostly tuxes, the women were more colorful. Steve was in his regular all black suit that had a black high-collared shirt under the jacket. Buck had always told him he looked good in black.
Steve gave no sounds of discontent so Tony tightened his grip around Steve's neck, pushing him into the blankets as his cock set a quick rhythm in his ass. At the feeling of being choked Tony could see one of Steve's eyes flutter and roll back slightly, his lips parting and a sharp intake of breath, and then Steve was rocking his own hips back, meeting each of Tony's thrusts eagerly.
"No, like last time. With the paddle." He reiterated and Tony sucked his lips into his mouth in thought.
Steve keened up against Tony's chest and let out a whine that he couldn't believe had actually come from him. He flushed with embarrassment and shrunk back a little, but Tony was quick to notice that.
Finally he flipped Steve over and unbuckled the gag. Steve had to swallow several times before he could speak and their were trails of spit all over his chin and chest. Several damp spots on the pillow as well. Tony pulled the condom off and threw it away.
"I've never been on the bottom before." Steve admitted. Usually guys didn't even question with him, they just expected him to be on top and then Steve would kind of awkwardly fuck them in the missionary position. No guy ever stuck around long enough for them to try other things, and Steve was so uncomfortable when it came to experimenting sexually, his past boyfriends just got tired of trying to convince him to do other things.
"Yeah. I doubt that they wouldn't tell him. I haven't seen him in years, I don't know if he's still the crazy fuck that he was." Thanos had stopped coming to family Christmas a few years ago, claiming that he was spending it with his long-time girlfriend's family.
"Steve isn't being hit very hard." Came Steve's voice again, unprompted and Tony felt sweat drip down his face even though he'd just wiped it away.
Finally, Tony decided that a hand job would do the trick. That way he would be completely focused on Steve's pleasure, and one of his hands would be free.
Peggy approached them both with an easy smile and a glass full of white wine. "Hey Steve, did I tell ya you could stop playing?" She asked sarcastically. "Just kidding, honestly you've played for long enough, you should just have fun now."
A small mewling noise came from Steve when Tony finally released his nipples, but Steve seemed satisfied when Tony's hands moved to the button of his jeans. Tony slid Steve's length out of his pants and gave it two long strokes before he released it and went back to kissing Steve. He needed the man to be completely relaxed.
“Sorry.” Tony drops the sing-song voice. “Poor timing. But the point is, every time you two break up and date other people, you always end up crashing right back into each other’s lives. It’s always messy and dramatic and painful for your other girlfriends and her other boyfriends, but it always happens. You’re each other’s endgame.”
Rhodey and Pepper, he knows, are waiting outside the courthouse. His two best friends, loyal to the end, will stay with him until he crosses the border. And since his two best friends are also his
“No,” Steve almost shouts, shaking his head like Gerald shakes off soapy water after a bath. He still looks a bit like he’s been smacked in the face with a picture of Red Skull in a flowery bikini, but the shell-shock is rapidly receding. “No. Of course not, Tony. I… I’m happy with you.”
Tony wants to drop to his knees and weep in gratitude. Rhodey understands. Rhodey has always understood, even during the times when Pepper and Happy have struggled to. Rhodey knows that Tony needs time, alone, to come to terms with everything. Now that Tony’s entire sense of self, of identity, has been stripped away (he is not the Golden Avenger anymore, not Shellhead, not businessman or philanthropist or billionaire). He needs to reinvent himself, tear down the walls of his persona and erect a new building from the foundations of old.
“Yep, still here.” Nick grinds the burning end of his ciggy against the wooden wall, leaving an ashy burn mark against the baby-blue paint. “No need to sound so down in the dumps about it. I’ll be out of your hair soon enough. Just wanted a word before I leave. File a complaint with the welcoming committee.”
“And I’ll tell you the same thing I told Steve when he showed up here that first day and offered me a pardon,” Tony says briskly. “I’m not coming back. Whatever’s going on with these ‘incursions’, the Avengers will solve it without my help and be better off for it.”
second-in-command – gave the order to have me shot and arrested! You trusted Reed Richards and Hank Pym. Why not me?”
“No,” Tony says, not unkindly. “You don’t. You’ve never needed anyone the way I’ve needed them. When Happy died – that pain and the grief – I never want to go through that again. It was worse than dying. The worst thing I’ve ever gone through in my entire life.”
“Steve.” Tony smiles somewhat patronizingly. “Do you need me to explain to you the newfangled custom of the twenty-first century where people have sex without being in a romantic relationship? I can use little words. Draw you a diagram. Give me five minutes and I’ll whip you up a PowerPoint presentation.”
Steve gets to his feet and crosses the room so noiselessly that Tony doesn’t realize it until he feels Steve’s hand gripping his shoulder. It feels like benediction, like absolution.
Inside, the television has stopped on a news channel. Tony is hyperaware of the open window just a few feet in front of him, and the possibility that Steve can hear their every word with his serum enhanced super-hearing.
Tony doesn’t look at him. He’s staring at a vague point somewhere in the distance, blue eyes dull and hollow, his mind miles and miles away. “We had so many close calls before that,” he says. “So many. Pepper had a miscarriage because she was tortured by one of my enemies. The baby – the baby could have been mine. Then Rhodey – God, Rhodey. He was injured so badly he was in literal pieces.
“Sam once told me that I always saw you through rose-colored glasses,” Steve says, apropos to nothing. “And that it didn’t change the fact that you were a sell-out.”
“Futurist,” Tony reminds him, the timbre of his voice sub-fusc. “I’ve always known I was going to lose you – to death or to your morals… my lack of them.”
Sharon convulses, gasping, her eyes full of horror as they snap open. She’s alone. Her bedroom is humid, suffocating, the dark blue curtains drawn over the brightening daylight. Her pajamas stick unpleasantly to her sticky skin. The bedding is tangled tightly around her hips. Her hand drifts down to her abdomen, tracing the contours of her scar. The skin is unbroken, but the nightmare has left her with a phantom pain centered around her old injury.
There’s a Harley-Davidson Street 750 parked in Tony’s gravelly front yard, sleek black and gleaming chrome, leaning dangerously close to his potato plants, green leafy shoots just beginning to peek out of the brown tilled soil. Tony flattens the capricious urge to tell Steve Rogers to move his bike.
Another droplet of rainwater lands on his head, leaving a cold, wet spot on his scalp. Tony rubs at the spot uncomfortably, too cowardly to meet Steve’s gaze, even though he can feel the intensity of the super soldier’s stare lasering a hole right through Tony’s head, like Steve’s eyes have been replaced by repulsor rays.
“You don’t have to tell me where I fucked up,” Tony says morosely. “I’ve had plenty of time to figure that out myself.”
“We fought,” Steve says, with an ugly grimace. “Before I left. A lot of nasty things were said from both parties.”
Tony squishes himself between Steve and the armrest, ending up half-sprawled on Steve’s lap, his head resting on Steve’s chest. He can feel Steve’s heart hammering against his skin. Steve seems to have stopped breathing. He’s a solid block of heat wrapped around Tony’s side and back.
Tony ducks out of the repair shop during his lunch break and phones Rhodey, who picks up at the fifth ring.
Despite that, there they stand, Maria Hill on one side of Tony and Dum-Dum Dugan on the other, as they have so many times before in vastly dissimilar circumstances, when Tony was their superior and not a prisoner. The reporters try to swarm, but Maria and Dugan clear the way to the exit with liberal use of elbows and sneaky applications of feet against shins. Tony ducks his head and permits himself a ghost of a grin.
Tony watches himself rise smoothly to his feet. Two SHIELD agents moving over to flank him, ostensibly to escort him to a prisoner transport van and then over the borders of America… But these particular two agents, Tony knows, and he knows well.
Steve touches his wrist, fingers wrapping featherlight around Tony’s pulse. “I think you should read those before you decide for sure,” Steve whispers.
Tony cannot do this. He cannot face them. It’s easier to envision them all hating him, one clean break and that’s it. He finds now that it’s more excruciating to be presented with hope at a time and place when he has little to lose anymore, to hang in that ambiguous period of suspension, waiting for his former teammates to make up their minds about whether or not they hate him.
“I was a bit pressed for time,” Nick says brusquely. “The world doesn’t stop needing to be saved just cause you two clowns ran off into the Canadian sunset together to play house.”
“Wow,” Tony says, inappropriately impressed. “I’m ruining your love life when we’re not even in the same country. I had no idea my influence has spread so far.”
Rhodey chooses to express himself with a mumbled diatribe about where Tony can shove his Wisenheimer.
He’s standing on a coastal shore, watching a meteor roll across the skies and plummet into the ocean, feeling the shockwave reverberate through the earth and salt water, up the soles of his feet, shaking the bones in his body until he falls apart like a poorly constructed straw scarecrow. He’s watching the tide recede meteorically (Ha!
“Married couples fight all the time,” Tony says wisely. “Then afterwards they make up. Or they get couples’ counselling. And a select minority end up suing each other when they can’t agree on who gets what during the divorce, flaunting their private dirty laundry to all and sundry during months of tedious court hearings.”
“I can’t-” Steve cuts himself off, swallowing spasmodically. “I can’t sleep with you if it’s just sex, Tony. I want more than that. I’ve always wanted more than that. I’m not like Pepper or Rhodes or Happy.”
“They’re not,” Tony says, giving Rhodey and Pepper stern looks. “They’re visiting. I’m sure Pepper and Rhodey have other businesses to conduct at a place far, far away from here. Don’t you, Pepper? Rhodey?”
“I’m running late for work,” He says to Steve Rogers, thoughtfully standing right where Tony left him outside.
Tony pulls off the tape sealing Clint’s letter. The sharp edges of the envelope slices shallowly into his thumb and leaves a tiny blot of red on the paper. Blood wells up from the thin cut and beads up on his skin. He sticks the digit into his mouth and sucks, tasting copper.
“I won’t come back,” Tony says simply. “I don’t want to. And honestly, I think you’re all probably better off without me.” Steve says nothing, complexion wan. “Why did you come here, Steve?” Tony asks gently.
A muscle in Steve’s jaw twitches. Tony recognizes the constipated, slightly nauseated expression, and decides to wait him out. Steve has his teeth clenched together like he’s forcibly trying to keep whatever he wants to say in.
Tony gets rid of all the moss and lichens first – seriously, what is with all these plants? – and then walks around smelling of vinegar for days. Mindful of the diminished funds in his new bank account (and it’s a wholly novel concept, having to watch how much he spends; Rhodey tells him it’s character-building, Tony hangs up on him) he salvages what he can (which isn’t much) and rebuilds what he can’t.
“You never looked at the three of them and wondered… or Sharon never suggested… you and Wilson and Barnes never tried to experiment-”
Tony’s lips tingle, feeling swollen and bruised. Steve mouths down the long elegant column of Tony’s neck in a warm, slick trail, sucking at Tony’s pulse-point and making him shudder. Tony’s cock jumps.
Gerald is waiting faithfully for him on the other side, perched on his haunches. The puppy tilts his head inquisitively to one side, mouth open and panting, tail wagging excitedly.
Steve is already looking at him. Tony meets his gaze, vividly azure even when they’re standing at opposite ends of the courtroom, and his shoes scuff against the polished marble floor, his mask of equanimity cracking open just a sliver. Dugan grips his elbow, discreetly steadying him.
Sharon’s face creases and she stirs, turning on her side, long blonde hair sprawling over her pillow. Cold sweat beads on her forehead. She doesn’t wake, not yet. But her eyeballs roll wildly behind her half-lidded eyes as her dreams turn violent.
In the end, they never found out whether Rhodey’s qualms were ever true. Tony’s mind-scan came back inconclusive. Tony was uncertain – he’s
Throat tight, Tony tries to quip. “Who am I to turn down the request of a respected member of the United States military?”
tongue. It will always be difficult to talk about Happy, doubly so on this topic, no matter how much time has passed.
Her soft beige-colored duster coat is knotted around the waist of her white summer dress like a wide sash. She’s in a pair of especially sharp-looking and towering pale lavender heels that Tony suspects she chose for the sole purpose of looming an inch over Steve Rogers. Tony dons his best victimized face. Pepper promptly rounds on Steve with an accusatory look.
Tony cracks open an eyelid to give Steve a slightly sleepy glare. “It was a birthday present from Pepper, if you must know. She’s the
happy either. If Tony has to, he would classify their profiles on the varying spectrum of conflicted.
"You did miss me" Tony teased, and Steve laughed out loud. He never hearing him laugh with the Avengers, at least not around Iron Man.
He wasn't going to lie, he adored the blonde and although they fought a lot when they were on duty, Steve was very careful and passionate in bed, always worrying about whether he hurt him, about using his extra strength.
Both greet cordially, the man with the plate making a movement with his hat. The lady requested and took in a single sip the drink of alcohol.
“Look how they try and never get anything, you know why? Because you're the only person I'm interested in”.
“You said you were going to moderate your problem...” The blonde with blue eyes said in a low voice approaching the other, he did not want to make a scene in public.
Rogers push Tony away, he got scared but then he heard the fabric of his white, very expesive shirt break, the reactor, Steve stared in amazement at the blue light in front of him, Tony tried to cover it up, the scars weren’t pretty but Steve kept him from pulling him away, getting close to place kisses around the device and in the center, Tony blushed.
"Steve, I…" The Captain smiled and although he didn’t have the power to read Tony’s mind, he knew what he meant, Rogers stole a kiss from him, and when their mouths separate Steve confessed.
Steve was making lunch when he got the call, and he had almost flown away, if he could, when he found out it was near Tony's office, he wanted to think that maybe nothing had happened to him, that maybe he was safe in his office or was already on his way back to home. But he didn’t answer the phone.
“Look who it is, did the officer decided at what time will go to his intimate date with the lady?” He is already affected by the amount of alcohol that entered quickly on his system. Tony pushed him off his shoulder, walking out of his garage. “I do not want to see you right now”.
“Jealous?” Tony was laughing very falsely while he finished dressing. “Now I know the size of your balls, Rogers, but don’t give yourself too much credit”.
“No matter how much we talk, it’s always going to bother me, they can have you and I...” He looked at the ground and finish his sentence. “And I just have to look...”
"Thanks Stark, maybe you aren’t an Avenger, but you have helped in the only way that you could, with your money," Steve once said to him and Tony had nothing more to say:
"Okay, I'll put the flowers in water, get comfortable, there's still pizza" Stark mentioned, pointing to the box on the center table as he went to the kitchen. When he was back he saw Steve sitting stiff in the single chair, Tony smiled mischievously and went to sit on his legs.
A boring meeting, with boring people, about boring topics, according to Tony, who wanted to go back home as soon as possible.  And when the meeting was over he start walking as faster as he could without looking silly but he was almost running towards the exit. Outside while he put on his sunglasses was looking for his luxury car, and when he found it and he was about to open the door, a thunderous noise, a wave of air made him and everyone else on the street fall to the ground.
“Hurry up, we need to get the civilians out of here, where's Iron Man?” Tony heard as the captain shouted to the team.
Tony walked angrily to his workshop, where he rummaged through his things until he found half a bottle of liquor, tilting it to drink as much as possible in a sip. He puts it on the table and begins to decide which of his inventions to continue today but someone knocked on his door so he grabbed the bottle again and went to open, taking another long sip.
"And if it was up to me too, Steve," he interrupted, looking up into his eyes, the blond smiled and leaned down to kiss him.
"Jarvis prepare the suit" Stark said to his watch, the AI takes instant notice and sent one of the Mark’s, who arrives soon on the scene, remotely controlled, shoots at the enemies.
"Pepper please, this is not the time, I will do all the press conferences you want but... now I'm not in the mood."
"No! What the hell are you doing? You're not going to be a hero for killing everyone, we have to save the hostages! " It was the captain yelling at the empty suit, Tony was watching the scene from his place, he had tears in his eyes. Why does Steve never value his help? Why couldn’t he earn their respect? He had always respected him, even when he was a little kid and his father was always busy because he was looking for him on the ocean, even then he had pajamas like his costume, a small teddy bear with the shield and Captain America posters on his bedroom walls.
“Stark!” Steve reaches him, taking the bottle from his hand and throwing it to the ground, causing Anthony's fury.
“Yes, I suppose it affected her too much and that is why she is looking for a distraction like planning a protest with the women of the town, so men will stop seeing us only as objects... although she generalizes things, surely his husband wasn't like that, and surely the friend of her husband is not like that either". The woman gave him a smile that was surely classified as prohibited at that time.
"No, it's my fault, it's my completely my fault, for falling in love with you, letting everything get out of my hands, it's just my..." Sobs prevented him from finishing his sentence and Tony couldn't take it anymore, getting out of the suit quickly capturing the blonde's attention, his light blue eyes filled with water, he ran towards him, hugging him, Steve at first refused but how can he deny something to the man he loved?
The other heroes also came down to help when they saw the Captain's insane action, helping him save some civilians, but they were still shooting heavily at Stark and the others, so they couldn't get them out.
He fired with the reactor at every enemy, releasing the prisoners as fast as possible with the help of the other avengers, some helped Steve to stand up, and when everything was over, Tony approached to Steve in the Hellicarier, Rogers wanted to move away at first, with his head down, but he didn’t denied Stark companionship, Tony was afraid of what the Cap was thinking and very scared of losing him.
The next morning Tony had woken up early, showered and dressed as soon as possible, the soldier barely opening his eyes when Stark finished.
“Tell me more about this protest” says Steve interested while Tony rolls his eyes once again because it seems incredible that the man doesn't understand Sharon’s games.
"Let's go to sleep" the Captain said, then lifted him up and went up to his room. One of the good things about dating a super soldier was that he didn't use his own legs anymore.
"Sir, Captain Rogers is waiting at the door." said JARVIS, who wasn’t allowed to speak during Steve's visits.
"It's Friday ... today ... can I stay?" Steve asked looking at him hopefully, and he couldn't refuse those puppy eyes, so he nodded and the blonde smile.
“I mean... Tony... she wants company, but I'm not willing to provide it... I thought we had already talked about that. I'm not interested in anyone else's company” Rogers approached the blacksmith, he still seemed tense.
“No, sheriff, you asked me to make a deal and I did not agree.” He held up his hand and the second glass was placed in front of him.
Then when they arrived to the barracks, where they attended to the super soldier, Iron Man stayed as close as possible. Still inside the suite. The Captain asked to be left alone to rest, Tony refused but they told him to wait and he did it, at the door. His cell phone kept ringing.
"These six months have been great because I have you by my side."  Six months? Wow, time flies, it was incredible for Tony to keep a secret and especially so long.
Hours later, Stark lay breathless on top of Steve’s rock-hard chest, as the blonde breathed heavily.
The call ended, he was left wondering what to do or what to say, it lasted a couple of hours until he couldn't take it anymore and he opened the door, watching Steve standing by the window.
The battle was getting difficult, the bad guys were well organized and resistant enough, there were hostages so they simply could not fight them, they would harm them or threaten them.
“Welcome Tony”. Sang in unison as they wiggled and sending kisses to him. He smiled while sat in front of the bar, he didn’t plan to lose consciousness, it was only to cold off the heat of that strong summer day.
A bomb, everyone panicked, Tony include, staying on the ground when the hail of bullets started, people were screaming.
"Really?" the brunette asked, surprised, Steve nodded "But you always yell at me, tell me what I'm doing wrong and…"
At that moment Steve knew, he didn’t want to keep repressing himself anymore, so he caress the brown hair, slowly pulled his hat back to get close enough and put his lips together with Tony's. The sensation of the other's beard stinging him made him gasp, searching for air after a few minutes. He observed that genuine and naughty Stark smile. That smile that caused women to cheat on their husbands. And very soon the blonde was being pushed, falling on a pile of dry hay. No too long after that, the mechanic was on top of him, sharing more whiskey flavor kisses.
One moment, they’re settling down for dinner – takeaway Chinese – and Steve asks about Tony’s work. It’s the same banal, trite small talk they’ve been mindlessly subjecting themselves to for the past seven days. But something about their hackneyed and platitudinous back-and-forth makes Tony’s hackles rise. He spits out something angry. Steve returns fire. And the next thing he knows, both men are on their feet, vociferating at the top of their lungs.
Steve’s arm loosens around his waist. Tony makes a bid for freedom. Both men lose their balance and topple over, tumbling in a heap onto the blue-carpeted floor with a muffled
By the time Tony reaches bumfuck Newfoundland, he’s thoroughly sick of trees. Trees are fine and dandy is one wants to be calm and serene. Tony has no problem with calming and serene trees, just as long as those trees are being calming and serene far, far away from him.
The American Dream himself stands in front of Tony. Steve Rogers is in a black motorcycle jacket over a soft-looking blue T-shirt with a white star in the center of his chest. Tony knows that Steve has an entire wardrobe full of similarly designed T-shirts in varying shades of blue. Or at least, he used to. Tony isn’t really in a position to know what Steve has in his wardrobes these days. The thought is sobering, like a bucket of cold water thrown over a hungover man, the drunkenness and residual lethargy sloughing off, leaving unwelcome lucidity and jarring cognizance in its wake.
So, they leave after staying a few days, tag-teaming to give Steve the shovel talk right before their departure.
The light from the bathroom falls on them. Rhodey steps out. Behind Rhodey, Tony can see the steam still fogging up the sink mirror. Rhodey’s clad in only a towel around his waist, reams of peaty brown skin on display. He’s in mid-motion of toweling off his hair, but he ceases when he sees them, Pepper in Tony’s lap, her pink sleepshirt hiked up to expose her breasts. Tony meets Rhodey’s eyes, then, not breaking eye contact, very deliberately starts to grind against Pepper. Pepper lets her sleepshirt fall back down, raking her sharp fingernails up and down Tony’s back, so hard he can feel the bite of it through the material of his jammies.
Maria Hill and Dum-Dum Dugan have wandered several yards away, gazing determinedly at the opposite direction in an attempt to give them privacy while Tony says his tearful farewells. As Tony climbs on the motorcycle, puts on his helmet, and revs the engine, the sound draws their attention. Dugan salutes sharply. Maria gives him a
Pepper’s hands find Tony’s own, traveling up his forearms, biceps, shoulders, stopping at his neck and digging her fingers into the tense knot of his corded muscles, kneading the stiff tendons at the junction of his shoulders and neck. Tony’s entire body shudders. He closes his stinging eyes, leans forward and rests his forehead against Pepper’s chest. Pepper Potts is all soft curves and pink jammies and slender wrists. Pepper Potts is diamond-hard eyes and spine of steel and heart of gold. Pepper Potts is a contradiction and a brain teaser and an imbroglio and Tony can spend the rest of his days trying to puzzle her out and die a happy man.
“Tough choice,” Tony says scornfully. “One kills pests for me. The other two are nosy busy-bodies who can’t leave things well enough alone.”
He must lose track of time, because he blinks and Pepper is standing right in front of him, barely an inch of space between them. He reaches out, touches the hem of the pink sleepshirt, pinching the thin cotton fabric between his fingers.
At one point, he isn’t sure when, he starts holding Pepper and Rhodey’s hands, the way he hasn’t held anyone’s since he was very small. Pepper and Rhodey don’t comment on it, even though the grip must be cutting off the circulation to their fingers. They sit in silence, counting down the seconds, listening to the rumble of the van’s engine, soaking up each other’s presence like sponges soaking up water, like sunflowers soaking up the sunlight, like a Roomba sucking up grit, like microfiber mops attracting dust, like tampons –
“You didn’t believe me, told me it would never happen, that the American public would never stand for it. But you know better now, don’t you?”
“No!” Steve turns completely red. It’s delightful to watch. “No, that’s not necessary. It… it just took me by surprise…. a lot of surprise.”
,” Tony says, swallowing the taste of copper coating his tongue. “I can’t control what Steve does. Worked out extraordinarily badly for me the last time I tried.” A breeze picks up, bringing a smell of fresh pine and sickly-sweet maple. He turns his head, angling his body so he feels the wind against his face. “There’s nothing keeping him here.”
Rhodey sounds phenomenally unimpressed. “You’ve never obeyed anyone in your entire life, and you avoid safety like it’s the Black Plague.”
James Rhodes is sitting on Tony’s left, muscles tightly coiled, jaw clenched. He’s wearing his Air Force uniform, including formal tie and rows of medals decorating his breast. It makes a very caustic statement, having the star Colonel of the USAF, War Machine, personal friend of Tony Stark the war criminal standing side-by-side with him during Tony’s very infamous trial and SCOTUS’s equally publicized edict.
Not his reputation though. That has long been fed into a paper shredder machine and the tattered remains flushed down the drain. The smear on his formerly good name – Tony takes full responsibility for.
He keeps tabs on the Avengers whenever he feels extraordinarily self-loathing or masochistic. James Barnes is still Captain America. There are several Avengers teams: New and Mighty and Young. None of them are headquartered in his old Tower. Tony expects to feel sad about that, but mostly he’s relieved. When he brings up the topic during his next phone call to Rhodey, Rhodey tells him his tentative plans to renovate the skyscraper as a science center, which Tony greets with exuberant encouragement. Then Rhodey tells him cautiously about the unofficial rumors of Commander Steve Rogers aiming to retire from the public eye and hand over SHIELD operations to Sharon Carter and Nick Fury. Tony stays silent. Rhodey takes the hint and changes the subject.
As much as Tony opines that they would like to, Rhodey and Pepper can’t actually chaperone his and Steve’s every interaction twenty-four seven – not with Rhodey’s commitment to the USAF and SI’s board of directors breathing down Pepper’s neck.
“That’s better.” Tony slurs slightly, blue eyes going half-lidded. He looks up at an exasperated Steve. “They make these for space crafts, you know.”
They lapse into quietude. A drop of rain lands on Tony’s cheek. He cranes his neck back, looking up with a jaundiced eye at the puffy clouds, a mite greyer than he thinks they were a second before.
He loved the lack of reporters, the anonymity, the absence of public scrutiny on his every move. No corporate troubles. No people trying to
“Funny things are.” Tony grins. Steve glunches at him until Tony subsides. “What do you want me to say, Steve?” he asks softly.
seem very odd that he would give away everything he had to his name. Rhodey was right about that point. Tony-of-the-past loved the idea of being normal, of fading into obscurity, of no longer having the weight of so many decisions and responsibilities of his shoulders. He loves his life
Tony only half-heartedly tries to dissuade them before surrendering to the inevitable. “Hey, Steve!” he calls as they walk into the living room. “Look who turned up!”
“I’m surprised by you as well, Steve,” Tony says playfully. “I mean, everyone knows about you and Sharon. But I always thought… Well. Sam’s objectively a very handsome man, even if his personality could use a bit of work. And all those years fighting the war with James Barnes, old timey soldiers Not-Asking and Not-Telling all over the place.”
Steve’s face as he dies: blood splattering his cheeks, brows creasing and eyes widening with a mixture of shock and pain, his mouth falling open, then going slack, eyes glazing over –
Steve is watching an episode of Dog Whisperer. Gerald barks madly at the screen as Caesar Millan approaches a hostile Labrador while the cream-coated animal is eating, and promptly gets bitten for his troubles.
“I should have let him drown,” Rhodey snarls, incensed. “You two deserve each other. All cute on the outside, completely depraved on the inside.”
And it’s during one summer day, a year on the dot from when he last step foot on American soil, that he steps out of his cabin, a denim jacket slung over his shoulder. Gerald is gnawing on Tony’s white trainers, and yips happily when he tries to tug it out of the puppy’s mouth. The puppy seems to think it’s all a fun game. Tony wrestles for his footwear, propping open the front door with a shoulder while simultaneously blocking Gerald’s many bids for freedom. It’s not Gerald getting lost in the forest that’s the problem. The difficulty arises when the puppy chases after his motorbike and tries to follow him all the way to work.
It probably says a lot about their relationship that Tony has Pepper’s preferred fragrance memorized by heart.
It was Commander Steve Rogers, surfing the crest on the wave of his popularity as savior of the planet, wielding his newfound political clout and power as America’s top cop with all of his usual subtlety – and the subtlety of a man who goes around dressed in the colors of America’s flag, is of course, close to nonexistent – who browbeats and hectors until Tony’s probable sentence goes down from execution, to life imprisonment, then finally to exile.
The walk to egress seems to stretch out longer than should be physically possible. The Supreme Courtroom is a grandiose chamber – all marble and tall, elegant columns; lacquered surfaces and polished wood – designed to strike fear into the hearts of guilty, lesser man.
Pepper Potts sits on his right, dressed in her business best: purple blouse and professional black skirt. That professionalism is nowhere to be seen as she lays her head on Tony’s shoulder, long red hair spilling freely and smelling of her favorite perfume – Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum.
