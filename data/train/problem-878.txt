John makes a pleased sound and puts his hands to Sherlock's collarbones, playing them like a piano. Sherlock moans freely, and John holds something to his lips.
Finally Lestrade let out a long sigh. “All right,” he said. “I do trust you, John. But this had better not come back to bite me in the arse. Give me the name and I’ll put someone on it first thing.”
The taller man located and pocketed his mobile and wallet, and put on a pair of dressing slippers. “I’m sorry John, that just won’t do. Besides, you look exhausted. You really should get some rest.”
“Why would they be there?”
“Yeah. Or the code to wipe the phone. Anyway, that’s it.”
She laughs hard enough to produce a very un-ladylike snort. "Oh really?"
Meal service consisted of black coffee from a thermos and a selection of stale biscuits. John refused both, and sat brooding as darkness fell. This time of year it would be dark most of the day where he was going. It was only 2pm local time and already nearly pitch black. He wasn’t sure if this would make his task easier or harder.
“How…do you feel?” John asks, suddenly shy about the night before.
myself. One of my boys took a chunk out of her, though.”
“You really shouldn’t.”
?” Sherlock spits.
"If you thought I had we'd have been in the hospital yesterday."
Not that she can’t see through all that, but to admit it out loud would feel like he’d lost to her.
“Everything. Nothing.” He looks up into Sherlock’s clear grey eyes, bright in the fading daylight, and his face is guileless, open, accepting. Sherlock still doesn’t move, but he is tense, poised for flight, like a deer frozen in the scope of a hunter, like he’s been suddenly exposed and has nowhere to run.
That seems to be enough to get John to let it go and after long moments of companionable silent Sherlock speaks. "You know, you mentioned that the antidote needed to get directly to the brain to work..."
“This is blackmail.”
John uses this momentary distraction to free his wrists, tearing Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders and running  his hands over the ivory skin of Sherlock’s back, feeling his shoulder blades, every vertebra under his fingers. Sherlock busies himself undoing John’s fly while John plunges his hands into Sherlock’s trousers, fondling the prominent hipbones, feeling Sherlock’s hardness so close to him but not yet daring to touch it.
“It’s good,” he repeats, almost savagely. “I wanted it. You wanted it. It’s not wrong. It’s good.”
Sherlock turns his pale eyes on his friend in genuine surprise. “Don’t be vulgar, John.” He resumes his playing, variations on the same theme.
"All right, they're ready. Don't say anything, she's told the tech you're some kind of American bigwig, and that's why you don't want anyone to know about this. Also, be nice to her – I think she's taking one for the team."
“Sherlock, all the evidence fits and neither of his employees match the description. And don’t forget the fingerprints. According to all we found and everything you told us, this is our man!”
John takes all that in, wide eyed, and Sherlock starts to worry he's too far gone. But then he nods sharply and, without warning, dives away, out of Sherlock's range of him, and Sherlock's world plunges back in the complete darkness and the swaying of the tube car. His lifeline is gone and he's alone on the speeding train.
“Mycroft seems supportive,” John points out.
“I don’t care.” John’s voice is stern and his arms are immovable. “Find a way. I don’t care how you do it or how hard it is, find a way to let me in. Do you understand?”
“Where’s my computer?” Sherlock demands. “Any cases?”
The Globe burns yet again! I must make a note of that. Never mind, you were saying?”
They were silent for several minutes. “I’m sorry,” John offered at last.
“I was just thinking it was quite nice, actually,” John replies mildly.
Sherlock cocks his head, as if he can’t quite grasp what John is saying, and in that moment, John hates him, just a little. “Will you move out, then?”
“When she speaks, or I read her words I hear… a melody.”
The first real moment of doubt had come standing on the roof top of the hospital. Moriarty is dead, John is pleading with him over the phone as he lies and lies about who he is and what he’s done. Lies that sound ridiculous even as he’s repeating them in his most convincing tone.
John laughed nervously. “Um, no, of course not. I just have a lot of boxes in different banks, and sometimes it’s hard to remember which code goes to which one! Don’t want to write it down, you understand…” he finished lamely.
Of course it could just be a quirk, John thought – lots people have oddly specific tastes in certain items, but why something so obscure from a city he seemed to have no connexion to? It had to be something more than just a preference for a certain brand of smokes. Sherlock had certainly thought so, unless some other clue that had escaped John’s notice had led him to Croatia. But how to find out? Asking about Moran directly seemed like a dangerous proposition. He would have to go the route of the confidence man, he decided. Making sure his sidearm was in place but hidden, he zipped up his jacket and pushed through the door into the dim little shop.
to.” His eyes are little bit pleading now.
to show up. I suppose I should have known. No need for threats - I know what you have and I know when I’m beaten.” Her voice is deeper, raspier than he remembers.
When John speaks he’s more incredulous than angry. “You drew up civil partnership papers? Just like that. Isn’t there a waiting period?”
Lestrade nodded and lapsed back into deep contemplation of his liquor glass. They were both relieved when the system dinged a few moments later.
Sherlock looks him over, completely devoid of empathy once he assures himself of the lack of blood or other sign of severe injury on his friend. He opens his mouth to say something, but a loud, feminine “
It’s true, John has to admit. Tess’s prickly intelligence and devastating wit, combined with her enthusiasm for all things grotesque and morbid, has never done much to win her female friends. But it endears her greatly to a certain sort of geeky and bookish young man, of which she tends to have several constantly in her orbit. But that’s not what’s currently making John’s throat constrict with dread.
The man looks deflated and John relaxes ever so slightly, motioning him to the chair in front of him. He is unprepared for the sudden lunge, without any tell, for the ID card in his hand, and just barely manages to hold it out of reach. He is somewhat more prepared for the ensuing roundhouse kick aimed at his chest, though still startled by the strength and speed of the smaller man’s attack. John manages to deflect the kick and move close enough to get in a punch or two of his own, hoping the immediate vicinity is deserted enough for no one to hear the scuffle.
He opened it. It contained a pair of gloves, a sock, a battered Croatian phrasebook, a mostly empty tin of English tea, and an envelope labeled “Mycroft”. John felt a faint moment of disappointment that Sherlock had not expected John to be the one to come and find him, but he pushed it aside.
Sherlock drops the frightened traveler act for a calm-but-dangerous streetwise professional and switches to flawless French. “Very well. I’m looking for someone who works – or worked – for them. Used to be based out of Liège but word is they moved up here.”
"Myelin! What's that? I know that word."
Sherlock relaxes minutely and forces himself to have a normal breakfast in the dining room before walking down to the beach, where he won't be overheard. He dials the pre-set number in the phone and is completely unsurprised by the voice that answers.
“I’m more worried about what you need right now,” John said hesitantly. “What you want. Tell me. Please.”
Over the next few weeks, Sherlock proved himself to be a surprisingly capable nurse. He continued to work on cases, but only those that could be solved relatively easily without too much legwork. He changed John’s bandages with deft fingers, helped him stand and take small, slow excursions around the flat to keep his legs from weakening. He made John’s meals, even if they did come from a tin. His one attempt at cooking from scratch had been inedible. Mrs. Hudson brought a regular stream of soups and snacks to supplement Sherlock’s efforts.
“Thank you. You’ll never know what this means to me.”
“Humour me.”
didn't think it through. You seriously can't understand, can you? What the past two years were like for me. After everything that..." John makes an angry, frustrated noise. "Christ, I thought it was all my fault, that if I'd died you wouldn't have. And now you're just back and I find out that you could have stopped it all at any time. Every single day you were gone, you made the choice to keep me in pain."
The woman occasionally known as Anthea sticks her head out the window. “Dr. Watson, we are not going to see Mycroft, I assure you. But you very much want to get in this car.”
"What sounds?"
“Please, Greg. You have to trust me on this one. Have I ever asked you for something like this, ever before?”
The sensation is unexpectedly strong, but delicate and complex, different from either being fucked or fucking. They move together against each other, undulating in sync. John clenches, wrapping his ankles around Sherlock’s calves to keep them as tight together as possible, and Sherlock snakes a hand forward to stroke John almost harshly as he pumps faster against him.
John wonders if he’s taking advantage of Victor’s kindness. But he offered to help and he'd clearly meant it. And what else can he do? He can’t talk to anyone else about this, probably shouldn’t even talk to Victor about it.
They looked levelly at one another for a long moment, sizing each other up. John’s hand tensed at his hip. At last Mr. Božić nodded curtly. “I will get it immediately. One moment.”
that?”
Sherlock arched an eyebrow. “You were in my flat?”
“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” John said.
“Come on, it will be fun,” John coaxes. Sherlock has taken refuge in John’s room while Mrs. Hudson fills the lower floor of the flat with food and decorations for the party tomorrow. He’s sitting cross-legged on John’s bed, petulant and dishevelled in a way makes him look positively edible.
"She won't be likely to tell you anything unless she thinks you're one of her people. When you introduce yourself, tell her your friends call you Gilly. When she says that Gilly isn't a very good nickname, reply that they aren't very good friends."
Sherlock continues crowing about the case on the way to, and through, dinner.  “This was a good one, best we’ve had since Baskerville.”
Sherlock closes his eyes and sets his jaw firmly. “Thank you, John,” he murmurs. He heads again for the door and John lets him pass, the will drained out him. Sherlock is moving slowly, like he can’t quite believe what he’s just done, but he doesn’t look back.
"Why did they send you?" she hisses, dropping her wrap and clutch on a bench beside them as if she's getting her hands free for a fight. "Why now? I've been working on this for months, someone like you can only screw it up at this point. My people are in place, I just have to wait for the right day. You can't rush something like this. Or is it
“What in God’s name are you doing? It’s four in the morning and after what I’ve been through I don’t think a little sleep is too much to ask.” John was furious in the way only a man awakened prematurely after a near death experience could be.
“We must have just missed them. They weren’t kidnapped were they? They ran away together and when they thought they were going to be caught…”
“Probably not. Best just to wait here.” Sherlock is barely able to stand, with injuries to both legs. He’s bound some cloth from his shirt around his thigh wound, and his ankle is definitely sprained badly but not broken. Both their faces are covered with scratches from where thorns tore at their flesh as they ran, and Sherlock is doubtless mottled in developing bruises underneath his clothes.
“I don’t want to hear it right now, okay, Sherlock? There is a very long list of names I could think to call you at the moment, but I won’t because you would probably
Sherlock nods in acknowledgement, closes his unseeing eyes, and tries to lose himself in the music.
Sherlock can sense John's disappointment when he has to clarify that his sight hasn't been fully restored, just that he can see John again, or at least a projection of John from his own mind. Still, it's a vast improvement.
“Yes?”
She listened quietly as she cooked. As he finished, she slid a huge plate of food in front him and joined him at the kitchen table. “Sounds serious. And he’s right, seems like Moriarty isn’t done with him. With either of you. It scares me, John.”
Her brazen bluffing only infuriates him more and his fingers twitch of their own accord, tightening.
His eyes were closed and he was pinching the bridge of his nose. “John, I realise I put you through a lot and I can understand your reasons for tormenting me, but I have to say I feel that this getting to be a little bit unfair. I have nowhere to be, no cases to work, no drugs, and now this. I simply can’t take it anymore.”
With three of them in the cab, John can hardly go and storm it. They’d have him in an instant. Carefully, he edges around to the back of the vehicle and climbs silently inside, hiding himself in a little corner of darkness made by the back door frame. Sometimes being small is no bad thing. He pulls out his gun and then knocks loudly, three times on the metal.
Sherlock processes this for a second and then turns again, forcing himself to walk away in what he hopes is an even pace.
John wonders which of them will break first. He hopes it’s Sherlock, not because he wishes to delay the inevitable, but because he’s not sure that Sherlock could accept it until he fully comes to terms with his own poorly delineated feelings. So John stays quiet, ignoring the blatant signs as thoroughly as Sherlock manages to do, waiting for him to figure things out.
“And the suspect?”
John closed his eyes. Sherlock was the last thing he wanted to talk about right now, especially with Mycroft. “What, you came here looking for my forgiveness? You want me to absolve you of your part in his death? Well, you’re not going to get it. You can rot with your guilt for all I care.”
“All right. Well, his clothes and shoes are good quality; I suppose that’s how you got his income bracket. Raised in poverty though…?”
John smiles at the sound. "Now," he says, stretching luxuriantly. "Before the baby wakes up and you discover
“So what do you we need to look for?”
Sherlock is getting annoyed now. “You knew what I was from the beginning, John. This is how I will always be. I calculate risks before I do things, far better than most people. I’m not careless. I know exactly what I’m doing.”
“In custody. We caught him trying to buy passage aboard a freighter to Chile.”
“Don’t you get it? Not just the security upgrade, but imposters making it look you were there when you weren’t, so that your coworkers would swear to seeing you? And now they’ve taken personal items, distinctive ones as well ones that would yield hairs, skin flakes, DNA! Someone is setting you up, Mr. Bryant. They’re setting you up for something very, very big.”
John laughs in spite of himself. “I bet you loved that.”
“Why what? Why no girls? I don’t know. Maybe I’ve been a little busy lately. Maybe you keep being so nasty to them that no woman in London will go out with John Watson. Maybe I’ve just given up!” He was annoyed at the turn this was taking.
“Did you?” Sherlock asked with mild interest.
“Shh!” Sherlock whispers, cocking his head and listening intently. “Do you hear that?
Sherlock lifted his head. “Are you talking about sex, finally?” he demanded. “Because I need stimulation, and if we aren’t going to have sex I will need to procure suitable distraction by other means, and I will expect you to help me.”
“Whatever you say,” Lestrade says, more than a hint of resentment in his tone.
“You knew this was going to happen,” John says, when they get home. “You knew he was coming back.”
Before John can balk, the song ends, the spell is broken, and Sherlock releases him and bows, slightly sardonically. “Well done. Now you can try that with a countess. Excuse me.” Before John can respond, Sherlock vanishes.
John’s afraid to leave him alone in the flat in this state, and almost more afraid to find out that Sherlock wouldn’t notice at all if he’d gone.
The ceiling up here is lower, rooms mostly used for storage – basically a glorified attic. Sherlock is alert, all angles and restrained energy.
“I had…intended not to come back until I had dismantled Moriarty’s network entirely, destroyed his web, made sure the threat was gone completely. But that will take months, years even. I realised I didn’t… couldn’t… imagine being away from you that long, with you thinking I was dead, moving on with your life.”
"I'm not sure it's irrational," John says, his face grim. "Okay. Let's work, before it gets worse. I'll be your hands, you be my mind."
“Did anyone from your…club… ever say anything to you after you left? Ask you to come back?”
“You… need me in order to be a person?” John asks, stunned.
“Don’t bet on it.” John moved the gun to the right, against the man’s collar bone. “Do you want to find out how many bullets it takes to not kill you?”
“Now, there’s not much we can do right now. We need to wait until they make their next move, and I suspect that won’t be for some time. I have some hunches to follow up on, but for now I think we need to worry about more pressing concerns.”
"Yes. Because whatever he is, he knows it. Whatever he's pursuing, he pursues absolutely. He doesn't hesitate or doubt himself. He doesn't change just to please others. He can't be tempted, bribed, or coerced, he'll never compromise himself or his skill. His values and morality are his own and they might be a little bit awful sometimes, but he makes no excuses for it. His choices are his alone.
Concern flickers across John's face, the first sign of any emotion other than anger he's given. "What happened? That's not from me."
One night, Sherlock enters John’s room, late as usual but with uncommon hesitation. John is already in bed, reading and wearing only pyjama bottoms, and Sherlock is in his favourite dressing gown. He approaches the bed almost solemnly, and John puts down his book as Sherlock wordlessly climbs on top of him, straddling his lap, and kisses him deeply, gentle but determined, hands cupping John’s face. It is passionate and sensuous, but there is something sad about his manner.
John is surprised how quickly this brief description is able to make him hard again, but he decides not to question it and pulls the taller man over to him, wrapping his arms around him and beginning to ravish the elegant neck while he throws a leg over Sherlock’s hip, forcing them tight against each other. He’s just about to reach a hand between them when there is a sudden gasp from the hall.
John can feel the lure of the puzzle begin to wind its way into his thoughts but he puts his foot down. “I’m not cancelling. Take some pictures, I’ll look at them in the morning.”
John’s heart leaps into his throat as Sherlock pushes him gently, insistently into the edge of the counter.
Maybe simply running himself to exhaustion is the answer, John thinks as he climbs in to the black sedan the next morning, better rested than he’s been in days despite only getting a few hours’ sleep. It certainly seems like he’s about to have the opportunity.
The office is easy to find and empty, although the light on and warmth of the computer tells him it was recently occupied and may soon be again.  Like Bryant himself it is a little homely and chaotic, though seemingly random piles of paperwork speak of a personal organisation system opaque to anyone but its progenitor. John is familiar with this method, and would bet the man can pull out any needed item or document instantly upon request. A few personal items and photos inhabit the space, but nothing seems significant or out of place.
“You don’t have a weapon.”
The case, or cases, become an obsession for Sherlock in the next few weeks. There are two more murders, each different and seemingly unconnected, but with ample evidence pointing to a suspect who Sherlock is able to determine is not actually the killer. None of the victim-suspect pairs know each other or appear to have any mutual friends.
John breaks off, controlling himself, but it's too late, Sherlock has read the truth in his face. He recoils, horrified at the thought, horrified at himself for not realizing what he had done, what might have happened. “Moriarty…” he says, weakly.
“Um no, that’s all right,” John told her. He lifted the lid gingerly to see an unlabeled, padded mailing envelope. He snatched it out of the box and stuffed it inside his jacket. “I think I’m done here.”
“No.” Sherlock looms over John, shaking with the effects of the drugs and rage. “I am sick of being handled!”
“John, those are literally the last two things I ever expected you to tell me,” Sherlock replied archly, taking the drugs. “Especially in the same sentence.”
“I’m sorry, John,” Greg says firmly, voice rising as a crowd of constables and detectives begins to form around them hall. “But I’ve told you, there’s nothing more we can do. There’s no more case, no conspiracy. You just have to accept that Sherlock Holmes was a deeply troubled man and that’s all there is to it!”
"You turned your lab, the lab I made for you, into a room for my daughter."
Sherlock waves that away as inconsequential. “In due time. Once we’re at a point where things are obvious enough we won’t have to explain ourselves. Much.”
“John?” The voice is careful, tentative now.
“Sherlock, why are you saying this?” John can’t hide the hurt in his voice, but tries to keep it steady. “What happened?”
Two days and John is standing in front of St. Bart’s, listening to Sherlock lie to him, not understanding why and pleading for him not to jump.
a you and I. When it pushes all thought of me out of your head. When you don’t seem to be mine any more, or care if I’m yours. Or care about anything at all but her!”
“Not you. Just me.”
The man spat blood and laughed. “You are a formidable man, Dr. Watson, but there are many things more frightening than you out there.”
“What?” His head snaps sharply in her direction by reflex, but she doesn’t say another word and slips quietly out of the room.
“All that was in the contract, it’s not my fault if the woman didn’t read it thoroughly,” Sherlock responds mildly. “Foetal development is an extremely sensitive time. But there’s minimal risk here, she has all the pertinent biological and medical safety information, she’s very mature, and from what I understand this sort of thing is rather inevitable.”
? Have you gone
“You think they do something other than make paper?”
“Me neither,” he lied. He felt marginally better this morning. A little less empty. It was good to not be alone, even for just an evening.
John nods, feeling suddenly bone-weary. Victor shows him to his rooms. He's relieved to note that they are in a completely different part of the castle than where he had stayed with Sherlock. He’s quite sure that is intentional.
“Why, hoping for another snog?” Sherlock asks nastily.
her? Is
John hadn’t had time to fully register Sherlock’s condition before, but now, as he propped him up on the floor, he could see the full extent of the damage. He gasped, horrified. The only thing that stopped him in that moment from putting a bullet in Moran’s head was that the man wouldn’t be awake to feel it.
“Well, we never had any concrete proof that she was connected to Moriarty, but she all but came out and said it or neither of us would be here. She was a citizen of Bulgaria, although it’s not clear if she was born there. She had forged papers from a dozen countries under scores of names but I’m sure none of those would do you any good at this point even if we had them. Her organisation, or at least the one she seemed to be working for at the time you encountered her, was Belgian. Les Butineuses has basically vanished now as well and it’s not clear how Moriarty was connected to them either…”
Moriarty went up on his toes. “Everything,” he hissed in Sherlock’s ear. “It wouldn’t even be
“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about,” John assures him. “Whatever you feel, you feel, I just want to know. Isn’t that what this is all about? Knowing each other?”
They arrive at the mostly-intact crime scene early the next morning – the body having been removed to the morgue. John rubs his neck self-consciously, and turns up his collar a bit. Blast that man. Sherlock knew John hated turtlenecks because they made him feel strangled, and the only one he’d owned had mysteriously gone missing several weeks ago.
“Not that. Him. He was here.”
John smiles to himself and plants a kiss on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I don’t expect anything, you know. Whatever you want, whatever you need… I’ll understand.”
“Son of a bitch,” John pants, not needing to act as at least four officers take hold of him, none to gently.
looks exactly like the kind of dive one would expect, half underground in a draughty, thick-walled stone building in poor repair, unlike the well-maintained tourist-ready fortifications in other parts of the city. He watches for a good thirty minutes, assessing the kind of people who come and go and from which entrance. Some stay a very short time only - clearly goods or information are exchanged here. Perfect.
“But not everything you know, obviously.”
When John is done, his news doesn’t surprise Sherlock.
When Christmas morning dawns, Sherlock is still locked away. John cancels on Harry and snags a few hours of sleep in his own room before going back downstairs to the deafening silence of the closed and impenetrable door. He sits in the kitchen, drinking cup after cup of coffee and futilely willing it to open.
“Well, you wouldn’t know, you weren’t there, were you?” John growls. “And you know perfectly well what I’m talking about, don’t change the subject. The kidnapper. You murdered him in cold blood while he was lying there in the gutter, didn’t you?”
“No,” John shook his head. “It has to be now and it has to be you, only you. No one else can even know I’m looking into anything other than the cases you have assigned to me. No one.”
“No, no, he was clean, at least temporarily, when we worked on that cabbie case, right when we met.”
He twists his tongue into the hair under John's arm unabashedly, and then lets his head fall back to the pillow. "Mostly, you taste of John Watson."
, so intent on showing off and so focused on what he thought was the real case. He had caught every detail and yet still missed the essence of what was right in front of him. Moriarty was good, but Sherlock should have been better. Still, Moriarty had been showing off as well. He replayed that scene over and over again. It held the key, he was sure now. But where was it?
Sherlock could barely make him out in the dimness. “Why did you make it so easy?”
“I’m okay, John,” Sherlock lied. “I’m fine.”
“You weren’t bad,” John allows, grinning.
Greg holds out his glass. "To Sherlock, then?"
“Yes. And you’re…asexual?”
from the station? It's miles, and freezing out there."
“So, you’re back to smuggling,” John states. “In an oil tanker. The double hulls, the false space between old tanks – perfect for getting any number of things from point A to point B without drawing attention, right? Christ, you could hide anything in this bloody ship.”
“Is that what you want?” John raises his head so he can look him in the face properly.
“Sort of. It’s a specialty paper company. We do some printing, though – mostly non-standard jobs with special requirements, like those large ad banners. I like it well enough, but it’s nothing I can imagine anyone would be envious of!”
“No, I think I can handle it on my own,” John grumbles. Mycroft turns to walk away but a thought a strikes John and he calls after him. “Mycroft. You have my sister watched, don’t you?”
John is certain that this will not be the usual way of things between them, but is grateful for it this time. He himself is a little unsure, although he is positive it is completely real. He feels like he is being shocked every time Sherlock touches him in a new place, removes an item of clothing, mouths unknown words silently into his neck or shoulder. Like he is on the verge of dying and being yanked back to life each time. His skin feels hot everywhere Sherlock’s hands go, though the taller man himself is cool, as if he is drawing all of John’s warmth to the surface and into himself.
"Yeah. Yeah, I know." For the first time in the conversation John’s hold on his emotions slips and he's nearly overwhelmed.
She laughed. “Did you?”
John motions to the book in his hand.
“I’m yours, Sherlock,” he says quietly, but with determination. “I’m yours and I always have been.”
John looks sick. “Jesus.”
Sherlock spins away from John and walks a few steps, forcefully, aimlessly. “I knew you would be fine, John. I had things to finish up.” His voice is a study in carelessness. “I can’t coddle you all the time.”
“Not to me,” John retorts angrily. “And it’s not
John frowns. “We don’t discuss it much. Obviously I know about his time at Uni and Victor. I know there was some period of time after that when the drugs were too powerful for him and that it was pretty bad. And that he eventually got himself mostly clean, or at least in control, and began working as a detective. That’s about it.”
“What kind of paper would
Sherlock unfurls himself from his chair and looks down at the pitiful, shaking form sitting on the sofa. “Here’s your answer. You feel guilty about taking money and then not returning the favour. Your guilt causes you to notice others of your complexion more than usual, which then develops into paranoia, which escalates the whole thing even further. Give a large donation to your Society’s scholarship fund, find a therapist, and get yourself some sleeping pills. Good day.”
John tries to talk to him about it a few times, on cases when Mary’s not around, to check in with him and make sure he’s not putting too much strain on himself. But to allow him to do that would negate the entire point of the work Sherlock has done to shift his thoughts and perspective into this stubbornly platonic dimension, so he dodges and redirects and eventually John stops asking.
John’s arms are tight around his waist, and Sherlock thinks he could stay like this forever, if that’s what John wants from him, even as he feels heat growing between his legs and begins to ache with it. He stays perfectly still, waiting for John to show him what he wants.
“I told you I didn’t.”
Sherlock subsides. “It’s most likely she’ll be in the warehouse, with the advance guard, making sure everything is secure before the lorry arrives. I’ll take care of her.”
“Tedious!” shouts Sherlock. “I really was hoping for a more original motive than ‘I’ll show them’. Very disappointing. A proper genius should have a far more interesting reason to go on a murder spree. You don’t even have the decency to be truly insane and kill people because your alien overlords are telling you to. You’re just a petulant child. Ten points for execution, zero for backstory.”
John, with difficulty, puts down the knife and sits forcefully down in the chair opposite her. "No, we won't," he tells her, keeping his voice calm although not entirely devoid of anger. "Because you, Ms. Adler, are making the mistake of thinking that you and I are competing on a level playing field. We're not. In fact, we're not competing at all, because you never got off the bench. You can flirt and proposition and strip naked for him from now till the sun goes cold, but it won't get you anywhere. At least not anywhere you'd want to go."
"Never heard of them."
“I’m not trying to do anything to you, you just don't understand. It would be better for you, for both of us--” Sherlock’s words are cut off by John’s mouth suddenly on his, hard and bitter and determined.
“You’re not taking my case?! Why did you have me wait around all day then?” The man gets up indignantly, grabbing for his coat. “Don’t tell me it was just so you’d have a second witness for your ambush engagement!”
Luck is with him then, an older woman with “supervisor” scrawled all over her sour expression breaks in from behind the desk – John realises with a start that  she’s been there this whole time, he simply hadn’t noticed her presence at all.
"Up here," Sherlock says as quietly as he can manage and still be heard down the stairs.
“All right, but then why all the mess? Why not just slip in quietly and take what they wanted? Things like that, wouldn’t most people just assume they’d misplaced them in the house? No need to cause all this alarm.”
When they reach home, Sherlock is unusually solicitous of John for several days. He had pushed John pretty far with this case and, at least for once, seems to actually have noticed. The comment about  Sherlock not having friends had hurt. It still stings, even though John is used to Sherlock’s casual cruelty when he is frustrated, to him lashing out when he is unsure. Even though at least part of it could be written up to whatever that drug had been and John knew, even at the time, that he hadn’t meant it.
John lets out a long breath, a breath he’s been holding since Christmas. He shifts so he’s kneeling between Sherlock’s legs and put his hands on the bony thighs. Sherlock bends down until his forehead brushes John’s.
“Wait, please!” Bryant calls after him, desperately. “What about the things happening at my work?”
“He’s a free man now, he can do what he likes.”
"John doesn't know you know this, does he?"
For Sherlock's part, whenever he growls “mine” to John at random and decreasing intervals, bites him in a place nearly impossible to cover when he goes out, snaps in annoyance “hurry up, I need you”, or pulls John to him suddenly, roughly, twanging with desire, John finds that he could not possibly feel more cherished by anyone. He wonders if something is wrong with him, then decides he doesn’t want to know because it wouldn’t change a thing.
“I was laboring under the false assumption that you were cleverer than you apparently are,” Sherlock replied through gritted teeth, turning slowly as the sound Moriarty’s voice continued to move, trying to keep the other man in view.
"Good." Sherlock has to stop then for a moment. His own brain is starting to feel fuzzy. Maybe it's because he's been on overdrive for so long, or maybe this is the beginning of the next effect of the drug on him. Or maybe he's just being paranoid. He continues, with effort. "And am I real?"
“A call? Why?”
They end up in a very unsavoury neighbourhood. Sherlock enters a large apartment building in a bad state of disrepair, and knocks on a door on the third floor. After some time, a skinny, unkempt young man answers and immediately swears. “Shit, it’s you! How do you know where I live?”
He realized the woman was staring at him expectantly. “
He doesn’t have the words to encompass what he means right now. Years, what feels like a lifetime of belonging to each other, of leaving each other, of fights and denials and promises and putting each other through multiple circles of hell, of sacrifice, of deaths real and fictitious, of building a new language of words and gestures and touches just to even be able to understand each other, and so much light, so much brightness that even now John looks like the proverbial Christmas star has settled itself in his top floor hallway. How can anything else possibly matter in the slightest after living through all of that and still, somehow, managing to have held on to each other?
He files it away to deal with later and instead shrugs carelessly. "Girls are all very well, but work is better when you're down to your last Euro."
“No, nothing. As usual.”
She put a hand up at his protest. “But you’re always welcome, please remember that.” She looked at him with such sad eyes that all he could think to do was kiss her fair cheek and walk away quickly.
“No.”
Sherlock snorts derisively. “It’s too late for that, all you’ll be doing is pointing them to the fact that for all appearances you’ve been doing all sorts of things you oughtn’t. No, the only way out for you it to let it play out and we’ll catch them when they spring their trap for you Which means you must act as normally as you possibly can. Go on with your work, with everything as if you had no idea what was going on, but be alert. And go over your house very carefully – I suspect they also may have left some small items that might be incriminating to you later on, but I can’t tell you what. Just look for anything unfamiliar or –”
“Shut up,” Sherlock snaps and sets to examining the carpet.
“I took care of it. I did what I promised, didn’t I?” She cuts him off bitterly. “I gaslighted John Watson and I broke his heart. Just like you wanted.”
“Is that really all you think of? Yes, John is all right. For a given value of all right in which the person in question has had their life destroyed by their nearest and dearest. He won’t go off on his own again, so I hope you get what you need from this.”
He’s still at it when John wakes, and even John’s hand on his arm is barely enough to slow him in his circuit. John lets him go, biting back his protests. Doubtless he understands this behaviour is a substitute for more destructive means of coping. At last, later in the evening than Sherlock would prefer, the phone rings and he is freed.
by some things…and that you were desperate enough to run out half dressed as soon as you figured out how to find me. So, tell me, what can I do for the great Consulting Detective, hmm? Anything you desire! Name it!”
John is tempted  to walk away, but something in her tone makes him surrender and get in. She is, as usual, working away furiously on her phone, taking no notice of him.
Moran was discomfited but attempted not to show it. “And what do you think you realise?”
Mrs. Hudson is, mercifully, out. Probably looking for him. He creeps into the too-still flat that smells faintly of chemicals and tea and the tobacco that Sherlock never quite banished from his life. Trying not to think any more, he collapses on the sofa fully dressed and falls into a restless sleep.
John hesitantly returns the embrace, still not crying, but letting himself bury his face in the crook of Victor’s neck and relax just the tiniest bit.
Sherlock wakes slowly, to a splitting headache and a mouth that feels like the entire contents of the Sahara have been emptied into it. The first thing he notices is that there are sounds.
“What? It’s only 8:30!” John exclaims, but Sherlock has retreated to his room and shut the door firmly.
She nods, placated. “I mean, not that I don’t think it’s brilliant that you’ve sorted it all out, but there are some things I don’t need to actually see…”
a few you couldn't. Go ahead, be as fascinating and mysterious as you like, bring him cases and play the damsel-in-distress card and the shameless dominatrix card and the international power broker card and whatever other cards come to mind. And he might play along because, whether I like it or not, there is something about you that he cannot resist. But he'll never give you what you want, and he'll never be yours."
"Safe? Our work involves at least one near miss a month, not to mention the weekly bruises, scrapes and other mishaps."
“Actually, I’ve rather settled down,” he tells them with studied casualness. “I think my playboy days are over.”
John did not find this reassuring, but couldn’t think of a course of action other than to wait. He made a pot of tea.
John coughs and changes the subject. “So, this is Lady…de Corataine’s estate, I’m guessing… Impressive.”
John closes his eyes. He knows he should stop this. Sherlock isn’t in his right mind, wild-eyed and horny and out of control. He can feel Sherlock’s erection hard on the small of his back, hands on his chest, crossing well beyond any lines they’ve approached before. He doesn’t reply.
“Hello to you as well. They’re in the big stockpot on the hob.”
“Then what?”
him for what he really was, few though they might be. Can you think of a single one who, on some level, wasn’t completely in love with him?”
“Don’t go,” John tells him, drawing him closer. “Here, just lie down with me. Please.”
John waits until the footsteps have retreated to open his eyes. Mary fusses appropriately over him and calls the doctor. It's only a few more hours before he is released home to her charge.
She nodded. She reached out and touched him lightly on the arm. “Be careful?”
He suspects this is how Sherlock is restoring himself emotionally after extreme prolonged stress, as the sleep and food are repairing him physically. John is also in need of rest and refreshment, far more so than he had thought, as focused on Sherlock’s wellbeing as he had been. This is certainly doing the trick. Sherlock may not view it as a much needed time of bonding and reaffirmation, but as he has just spent the better part of two days going over his friend so thoroughly that there is no chance he’s missed even a micrometre of John’s body, he wouldn’t have much luck denying it either.
“Not her house.”
That sobers Sherlock quickly and John takes him into the fMRI room. Sherlock keeps pace with him, letting John’s shoulder touch his arm just enough that he can follow John’s movements without the humiliation of public guidance. The room feels big and empty, with a loud, low electronic hum pervading it. John shows him to the table and has him lie down, face up.
She smiles sardonically. "I am very, very, very good at it," she tells him. "And very bad at almost everything else."
“I’m heterosexual, so sue me. What exactly did you want me to do?”
John looked at him, really looked at him, for the first time since the night he’d returned, searching his face with a hint of a sad smile. “Six months, Sherlock. Do you have any idea what that was like for me? How much I missed you? How much it hurt? And I am so happy to have you back, I can’t even tell you. But it doesn’t erase those six months. In fact, it makes them worse now that I know they were for nothing. I was grieving a man who wasn’t dead. And you didn’t say a word. Not a letter, not a text.”
John sits back down warily and nods for him to go on.
“The cocaine’s worn off, it's just the heroin now. I need to stay awake.”
“No.”
"An argument could be made that I am, in fact, the cause of much of the danger John encounters."
“Well, I am married, right?”
Sherlock follows John's up the otherwise dark stairway to the lab. He hasn't tried to see anything else again, and for now the wattage John is putting out is enough. John retrieves the drug from the freezer and sets it on the lab bench along with the reports from the hospital and the fake perfume vial.
seemed to take to her well enough,” he adds snidely.
The man nods gratefully. “Thank you, you won’t regret it. And thank you…sir… I owe you my life!”
After a hesitation John clinks it with his own untouched one and then drains the drink.
“Apology accepted,” John whispers.
John texts Stamford to meet him at the Hanging Dog. Stamford's good for a reliably fun time out, and never asks any questions John might not want to answer. There's a match on and they stay out late, though John is careful not to drink too much.
“Oh… nothing. Not important. I’ll tell you later.”
John senses his mounting anxiety and comes over, sitting down in his own chair and moving Sherlock’s feet from the cushion his lap. “What are you going to do until we have the drug to work with?” John asks, rubbing them in a calming fashion.
Sherlock lets out the breath he was holding, and closes his eyes in sheer relief.
John can see this is not an idle request, Sherlock stirring again already at his touch, and he smiles, pulling Sherlock on top of him and rising to meet his mouth, the heat of his body, the thrust of his hips. John runs his hands up Sherlock’s back, tangles them in his hair, and then slips down, beneath Sherlock to take his length in his mouth, feeling him grow hard under his lips, gripping his buttocks firmly to control the speed of his motions. John has never done anything even remotely like this before, but it feels completely normal and he can tell from Sherlock’s soft gasps that he is on the right track.
“Of course I am,” Sherlock informs him. “Now, call Lestrade and tell him all he has to do to catch him is to have someone with a collection of historical family photos advertise for help in digitizing their collection. Our thief won’t be able to resist getting to them first!”
Sherlock doesn't know what to say to that other than, "No, I don't."
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock says flatly.
“About taking a chance on what you really want.”
Sherlock tensed and chewed on his lip absently, thinking a mile a minute.
your life!"
“You called this one,” he admits. “William Sterling, owner of the nursery at the address you provided. Size 12 wellies, traces of cyanide in the pesticide storage area, claims he was alone on the premises, sleeping, during the window we established, but no one to confirm. Everything, just like you said. And the fingerprints on the coffee maker match. You have five minutes, but you won’t need it – everything points to him.”
He pulls John down next to him on the sofa so that they are all tangled up and Sherlock is kissing every part of John’s face and neck he can reach. John smiles despite himself. “How do I look now?”
“If casework is not better than sex, then why do you not engage in more of the latter and less of the former? We’ve worked on 38 cases of various quality since your last sexual encounter.”
Sherlock is aware of a sudden tension between them, one that has occasionally made an appearance before but never so strongly. He is overtired, he thinks, and John is drunk. That’s all it is. And yet the colour in John’s cheeks, the dim hall light catching in his sandy hair, the curve of his lips… suddenly it is all very appealing, drawing him in, fascinating him. He tries to repress the urge, as he does with all such urges and has done for years. Urges, he has learned, are dangerous and distracting. But this one won’t be silenced, and John won’t stop looking at him like he is waiting for something to happen.
“And then what happened?” Sherlock’s bass cuts through his reverie and John realises how very far away he’d been, that he’s clutching the fabric of the sofa too tightly, that his elbow is digging hard into Sherlock’s side and that every muscle in his body is contracted.
“Great,” John says slowly. “Problem, though. I might be wrong, but I’ve got your blood tests right here and there doesn’t seem to be any sign of this is in your bloodstream. Maybe it’s not the Hound drug after all.”
"I just wanted to protect –”
“It most certainly is not! Idiots.”
"Touch, hearing, and smell all seem to be in order. What about taste?"
"Good. Okay. I'll make some calls. Do you... need help with anything?" John asks delicately.
He looks at Sherlock for confirmation and Sherlock gives the slightest nod. John pulls Sherlock down to him this time, and the kiss is far more equal, warm and moist. Sherlock’s lips part ever so slightly, and John runs his tongue along them, questing but not invading. He feels Sherlock’s tongue meet his and the kiss grows passionate as they open to each other, shyly at first, then more confidently, then hungrily.
John hauls Sherlock to his feet and Sherlock tries not to let on how stiff with pain he is. He's covered in bruises and cuts, not all of them John's doing, and he's sore inside and out. Walking normally will be a trial.
He’s on the freezing floor of the morgue now, collapsed under the weight of it all, back to wall. He’s crying, weeping, gasping huge gulps of air because suddenly there’s not enough of it, tears and snot rolling down his face and he doesn’t care. He hasn’t cried like this since he was a boy, not even when his parents died, not even when his comrades were blown to bits before his eyes, not even when shrapnel twisted hot into his body and he lay delirious in the unforgiving sun waiting to die.
“Oh…you’ve got plans?” Sherlock does not usually have plans that on’t involve a case, and they don’t have one on. At least that John knows of.
“None of your talk, they warned me about you,” the guard said, redoubling his grip on the gun as he came closer. “Stay still!”
John nods. YOU'VE BEEN ACTUALLY SEEING ME AND HALLUCINATING THAT YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE. OR HEAR ANYTHING.
"It's as much actions as feelings," she tells him, standing. "It’s a choice you have to make every day. And I think you've got it down just fine."
Sherlock appears torn between answering honestly and not replying. At last he says, “Yes. Something.”
Sherlock freezes, stiff and unsure of what to do as the moist heat of John's breath, heavy and uneven, seeps through his shirt. The silent heaving of John’s chest presses into him and he finds that his hand, almost of its own accord, is wrapping round the nape of John's neck and drawing him closer. John goes limp at his touch, letting go, melting into the embrace and Sherlock puts his other arm around John’s shoulders, holding him up awkwardly.
“Yeah, that’s what worries me,” John mutters, but lets him go.
John stays put.
Sherlock’s not sure which is worse – the verb she used that John never had, had never been allowed to use, or that she used it in the past tense. For the first time, he has real doubts about this plan of his, even though he knows it’s the only way.
They finish work on the hives by noon and Sherlock agrees to stay one more night, but excuses himself to his room for the afternoon to do some work. The sun has come out and it's grown warm, and from his place in the east turret he has a fine view of the gardens below and the cliffs overlooking the sea.
“Not even a little,” John grunted, as he shifted Sherlock so he was facing the right way on the bed and covered him with the sheet. “Why did you do this, why now? You’ve been clean for months. Or have you?”
“You had a screw loose,” Sherlock said dryly, not moving. And indeed, on the floor next to his manacles and blindfold, there was one tiny screw that had been removed from the bunk supports.
John can feel the climax swelling within him, and grips Sherlock tighter, trying to hold on just a little longer. He feels Sherlock’s hand against his cheek, fingers in his hair, the smooth voice, now jagged, saying, “It’s okay John, just let go.”
“Or a murder case. Your choice,” Sherlock said solemnly.
“Mr. Holmes. I had a feeling this wasn’t over, although I can't say I was expecting
John shoves Sherlock's shirt halfway up his back, one hand fisted tightly in Sherlock's hair and the other gripping his waist and tapping furiously with his thumb.
BUT I HAD NO WAY TO KNOW THAT AT THE TIME! YOU COULD HAVE BEEN HATING ME FOR EVERY SECOND OF THAT AND I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN. I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW. I WASN'T IN CONTROL.
John did not know it was possible for a human being to be this happy. It feels criminal, illicit somehow. He doesn't want to share it with anyone, doesn’t want to tell friends or family for fear it might disappear. He worries, deep in his heart, that it can't last, that the universe will not allow this level of joy to endure between two people. He tries not to let the thought grip him too tightly, but it always returns, usually in the dead of night when he can feel Sherlock breathing against him, and he thinks that if he ever had to go without this, he would die.
And John can’t refuse him, doesn’t want to. He enters him carefully, mindful of Sherlock’s reactions but hungry to feel his friend enveloping him, surrounding him again after so long. Sherlock gasps, and John hesitates, not sure if it is in pain or pleasure, but Sherlock only pulls him closer with strong thighs, moaning, demanding more, until John is buried deep within him, Sherlock’s cock pressed between them, chests touching, faces nearly so, breathing one another’s scent. They are still, reacquainting themselves, savoring the moment. John has one hand behind Sherlock’s neck, tenderly, and the other on his shoulder, while Sherlock holds John’s hips to him, as if he might try to leave even now.
he barks in a stage whisper.
John accepted this. “And how many times did you nearly die?”
Sherlock’s foul mood clears instantly. “You’ve been doing this since we met,” he declares. “That explains everything! You’ve been helping me observe better, think better from the start, I just didn’t have a visual cue for it until recently.”
“Excellent plan.”
“What did you--”
, while I was here trying to pick up the bits of a life that wasn’t going to ever fit back together. And I resent it, Sherlock. I resent the time I spent mourning, and I resent being left to do it while you went and had your fun. It
Sherlock is standing again, but no longer pacing and twitching.  He lets out a long breath. “Oh, that was too simple, but at least it was interesting for a few minutes.” He turns to John and John feels that familiar warm sensation creeping up from his toes that he always gets when Sherlock’s full attention is on him. Thrilling and reassuring and unsettling all at once.
He feels it start deep in John's abdomen, quivering around him, almost too much for his current sensitivity but he doesn't care, he delights in the too-strong sensation as it spreads through John's whole body. John is quaking with anticipation, and a few more long strokes from Sherlock are all it takes before he jerks sharply upward and calls Sherlock's name almost in desperation. Sherlock holds him tightly as he finishes, finally feeling John's warmth spill over onto his hand even as every fiber of his being softens.
“Oh, Sherlock, you
Sherlock coughs several times and carefully gets up with some help from John. He winces when he stands and John can see his right ankle is hurt, but Sherlock ignores it stoically.
“Ah, Sebastian,” Sherlock said cheerfully. “Glad you’re up! There are so many things I would love to talk to you about, but sadly, our time is limited.” He removed the gag from Moran’s mouth.
“I don’t…
John’s heart was in his throat. He forced himself to calm. He might not want to hear it, but there was clearly something Sherlock needed to get out. “Take it easy. Whatever it is, it’s…fine, okay?”
“Is it really?” Sherlock seemed genuinely surprised, and squinted at the first rays of dawn lightening the horizon. “Well, let’s see if we can’t find somewhere to do us a nice roast and a Yorkshire pudding anyway. And then back to work!”
“Jesus Christ, piss off,” John snaps, pushing Sherlock’s head away from his and shaking himself. “What time is it?”
It's the middle of the day on a Saturday and they've been following a uniquely nimble cat burglar who, in addition to jewelry and cash also takes old family photographs, even staying an unwise amount of time in the houses after he's found the valuables in order to locate them. Unfortunately, the man seems to have just gotten wind of them and is now running for it.
“Everything. That I could have everything.”
“Likely,” Sherlock agrees. “However, as you pointed you’re fine and I’m not hallucinating, fearful, or aggressive.”
Sherlock nods and walks carefully over to one of the remaining pallets, motioning John to follow. “What is it?”
“Sod off, I mean cutting your hand wide open on purpose.”
“Is it that serious?” she asked, more frightened than ever.
"Sorry, John dear, I thought you were in the kitchen. What on earth were you doing in there?"
"Well, that's a very noble sentiment. But are you quite sure?  Theory is one thing, practice is quite another."
Pain radiates from various parts of him where he hit the floor. Everything is still silent and dark, his head still spins and his stomach still turns, and fear is rooted in in his mind, but he’s a person again. At least he thinks so. He's Sherlock Holmes, isn't he? And John Watson is with him. Frantically trying to speak to him.
“What have you got, then?”
Sherlock Holmes’ return to 221B Baker Street had gone, initially, exactly as he had expected. Upon discovering him sprawled nonchalantly in the sitting room when returning from a shift at the surgery, John had punched him in the jaw. Twice. That had, of course, been a near inevitability and any other reaction would have been cause for worry.
"You're slipping down now, running your whole body over mine, hands following." Sherlock's voice catches and goes up half an octave. "Now you're kneeling between my legs and rubbing my buttocks and the backs of my thighs with more oil."
Sherlock is abashed, but only a little. “Well, you’ve been stretched so thin, temporally and financially. I just thought you might appreciate the option to focus on Rosie for a while… and casework.”
Sherlock shivers with pleasure. “Bore.”
“I need to get on that ship.”
John’s face darkens even further. “Well, you’re not the only here, so just use them, okay?”
And then they were both fast asleep.
enough inducement for him?"
Somewhere in he'd stashed his cane what feels like a lifetime ago. Was a lifetime ago. Someone else's lifetime. It's filled with boxes, mostly his old things he'd moved there when he'd turned his old bedroom to a lab for Sherlock
At some point, he can't take it anymore. It hurts too much. His leg, that is. He gives up and goes rummaging through the hall cupboard.
“Why?”
John’s come round behind her, and Sherlock has spotted him but doesn’t motion for assistance. She lands a hit to Sherlock’s throat just then, making him cough and fall back, and that’s enough for John. Before she can realise he’s there, he grabs her arm and twists it up behind her back, hard enough to make her cry out. Sherlock reaches out and with one smooth motion takes her other wrist, spins her around from John so her back is to him, and neatly clicks the handcuffs into place.
John manages a long sleep which, if not free of nightmares, is more restful than most of what he’s been getting. Even though his intent in coming up here wasn’t just to get out of 221B, he can feel it’s doing him good. Although there are still memories haunting this place, they’re nothing like as numerous or intense, and the scenery couldn’t be more different. It’s quiet too, but not in the empty, hollow way Baker Street has become. Quiet like a church or an abbey. Peaceful.
"John, I am going to tell you something and then I am going to ask you to do something for me." He keeps his tone even. "It's very important for me that you not react immediately to what I'm going to say, however much you might want to, and just do as I wish without asking me any questions right away. I cannot process an emotional outpouring or speak at length right now. Can you do that?"
Sherlock frowns. He’d hoped it would be that simple. Then again, if it had just been the drug in its raw form effecting him, the effects should have been diminishing over time, not like this strange, belated blindness.
Despite not being at all sure about Sherlock Holmes, John Watson follows him to a crime scene. And keeps following him, at a walk, at a run, into danger, so quickly that he soon finds he’s left his old life and his limp somewhere out there in the dark streets of London.
“You were gone. Think better up here. Needed to think about you to think about him. First I was hot, then I was cold,” he gestured helplessly to the trousers.
? That’s the one that has really been eating you up inside.”
“Sherlock. Sherlock!” John hisses through the doorway to Sherlock’s laboratory. The man in question fails to so much as twitch in response, so John tries again, this time crossing the room and putting his face no more than twelve inches from his husband’s. “
“Nothing, John. I’ll…be right back.”
He gets nothing else out of her and they ride in silence for nearly an hour, seeming to take a ridiculously circuitous route to wherever they are going. The car pulls to a stop in the middle of a large industrial complex, now mostly abandoned and in disrepair. John has no idea what part of London he is in.
“Perhaps not. But I can’t afford the risk, anything that dulls my senses, that makes me weak or unfocused. It could mean the end of me. It would be better, safer for us both, if you went entirely, ended our friendship, moved out, distanced yourself from me completely. But I’m…too selfish to ask you do that.”
“I never claimed to be otherwise,” Sherlock notes. “But why do you care what normal people have?”
Sherlock manages to contain himself for the rest of the night and part of the next morning, until they are sitting at breakfast, finishing the last of the coffee. John is paging through the paper when Sherlock decides he can't take it anymore.
is dance. Think very carefully about the list of things I might decide to occupy myself with at a party like this if I have no one to dance with before you make your decision.”
Sherlock doesn’t look up when he enters, and gives no sign of having noticed John’s presence. John takes off his jacket and slowly makes his way over to the sofa, kneeling at Sherlock’s head but not touching him.
“So this is revenge.”
“And when I sleep, does it go away?”
Victor embraces Sherlock immediately, but with carefully modulated reserve, and his only question is, "Dear Lord, did you
to her?”
“And that,” she continued, “is why I refuse to believe what I see before me. He still belongs to you. And I don’t think he was ready to give that up.”
It must be more than an hour before John finally arrives, his restrained, almost stiff-gaited footsteps a welcome sound and his voice even more so.
“Vegan?” Sherlock cuts him off in a snotty and appalled tone. “You mean no meat at all? A man would starve.”
John’s unbuckling Sherlock’s trousers, now, yanking them down harshly until Sherlock is exposed, arse in the air, head on the floor, completely at John’s disposal. John is stronger than Sherlock is, he couldn't get away if he tried, and it sinks in for the first time that John is serious, that they have reached the point where they have run out of words for each other in a way that is more final than it’s ever been and this is all John can think to do. And for a moment Sherlock feels afraid. Afraid of John, of how far he's pushed him and what he’s about to do. Afraid of John's desperation and anger and fear.
"John! Really." Sherlock jumps up and starts circling the room. "If you were any more smug I'd have a sunburn."
“What would you know about it, anyway?” Sherlock snaps.
“Consolidate or blackmail? The only reason anyone would follow you is if they thought you could destroy them – most of those operations will make far more money on their own without your ‘protection’ as you probably call it. No, your grip on any kind of power is shaky at best and you know that without something to command loyalty what little you have of it will slip through your fingers like so much sand. Moriarty knew you couldn't handle it, that's why all he gave you to run was a tiny little smuggling operation, dealing in trinkets. You weren't his partner, you were his
“Just be… be careful, okay?” John said, gruffly.
Sherlock does, with bad grace. He's freezing and the smock was clearly not designed for a man of his height.
John gets out and is barely surprised when the car drives away and leaves him. It’s raining again, it’s been raining all summer. “Great. Now what?” he mutters to himself. Suddenly his mobile vibrates and he looks down. There is a text from a blocked number.
"It doesn't matter anymore. I can't live like this."
John knows this wasn’t a suicide. He doesn’t know what has transpired on the roof, and won’t until weeks later, but he knows that the man he has shared a life, a flat, a bed with wasn’t a fraud and would never do this to himself, would never do this to John. He knows exactly who to blame.
She made a soft sound of assent but then at the last moment pulled away, untangling her fingers from his.
"Nothing. I mean... you haven't seen my cane have you? I'm sure I put it away in here ages ago, but I can't seem to find it."
“Not what it’s
Cautiously, he opened it and peered down. He could see nothing. He descended the ladder, keeping one hand on the gun in his pocket, and whirled when he hit the ground. He was under the stage now, in the warren of tunnels and support beams which held up the famous playhouse and transported actors, props, and scenery to their required locations. It was dark, but not pitch black, not everywhere – low lights illuminated parts of the floor here and there. A few shafts of light likewise filtered down from the arena above, like unintended spotlights. Sherlock himself stood in the bright column of light from the open trap door above.
you tell me about it?”
John shrugs. “Name one occurrence in life that doesn’t require such a particular and delicate set of circumstances to bring it about that it seems impossible that it happens at all. Everything is vanishingly improbable, when you think about it. It happened. I’m me, you’re you, and we’re here. Leave it.”
Sherlock angular features split into a wide grin. “Oh, yes!”
The receptionist gives him a sympathetic look. “I’m sorry, sir, but they took him straight to the morgue. Is there anyone I can call—?”
“Oh, shut up,” he mutters, and feels himself blush as he makes a quick exit and heads to Bart’s.
Left things? For John? He could hardly believe his luck. Then again, was it luck if Sherlock was behind it? He followed her gladly back down the stairs and into the basement of the house. It was filled with cardboard boxes, in various stages of decay. Apparently Sherlock wasn’t the only tenant to leave things behind. She rummaged for a few minutes and then turned up a small box and handed it to John.
“Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear, you’re rubbish at it. And don’t give me some repentant bullshit. I’ve seen you cry on cue too many times for your emotionally manipulative act to work. The truth. It wasn’t just for me, was it?”
made about my feelings for a woman you mistakenly thought I was infatuated with are on the same level as you snogging a suspect in front of me?"
Mycroft shakes his head. “He was on the edge before he met you. He was slipping, John, and I think he knew it. I suspect that’s why he suddenly decided to stop living alone. He was hoping the presence of another person would be enough of an obstacle to keep it from happening.”
“A term of endearment,” Sherlock assured him, as they watched the men scramble for their parkas and rush out the door Sherlock had helpfully propped open. No one seemed interested in options B or C.
“You didn’t do enough to make it feel good. Then too much feels bad again. Too much more and…well…”
“If you don’t want me to be Rosie’s father, I understand.” This is nowhere close to what he had intended to say, but the words escape before he can stop them.
"Yeah, she mentioned something like that."
, you come!”
John grabs his t-shirt in a daze and wipes them both reasonably clean before settling perpendicular to Sherlock, head on the taut stomach. Sherlock digs his fingers into John’s hair, sated and speechless.
They’re talking about the driver and his comrades. Time to make his move, before they can discover what’s happened.
“Killed ‘em.”
John hauls him up and as he does so, Sherlock rolls his ankle, hard. John will insist upon examining it and there will have to be some swelling.
“John, I don’t think—”
“Give it time, my dear,” Mycroft says dryly. “Nice to see you, Sherlock. Where’s John?”
"She'll think you've been sent to work with her. Play it carefully and she might tell you something useful without you having to actually know anything. Charm her, keep her distracted, and do your best to separate her from her personal effects. I'll do the rest. If she starts acting suspicious, get out."
“Oh, you don’t give him enough credit, John. I feel that anyone with the nerve to wait for his prey in the dark and stab him
Their impromptu concert is interrupted too soon by the ring of Sherlock’s phone. He growls in annoyance but puts down the violin to answer it.
Fear rips instantly through John’s chest. “Did something happen? Is Sherlock—”
Sherlock starts to reach for him, but thinks better of it. "John, I had to, just let me explain–”
Of course, an arrangement. The Holmes men certainly wouldn’t go in for anything so unappetizingly normal as an actual relationship. Or a marriage. “That still doesn’t explain how he managed to get you here.”
“What about Croatia? Is there anything there about him being in Croatia?” John demanded.
“I can’t do it,” he mutters to himself, but shakes his head and tries again anyway.
“Yes,” John answers placidly. “You know, the heightening of other senses. If you’ll recall you tried that once with me…”
“But she’s so…” Sherlock trails off, leaving John to fill in the blanks.
“That part is irrelevant. He’s come to trust you, moreover, to need you. The longer it carries on, the more devastated he will be if you ever decide to end your… friendship. If you’re going to do it, better sooner.”
He thought about the first day he had met John. Within 48 hours of meeting him, John had not only agreed to move in as his flatmate, but he had helped solve a case, saved Sherlock’s life and killed a man to do it, and defended him to his brother. Twice. Not to mention praising his deductions, rather than referring to him as a freak, as so many did. No one had ever treated him like that before, not even his own family. Mycroft had helped him many times, but always saw it as a chore. John saw it as a privilege, and he accepted Sherlock completely, as he was. He had become integral to Sherlock’s life in a way he had never imagined another human being could be.
“Consulting criminal,” John mutters. “He brought small rackets into the big time. At least until he got bored of them.”
Then, a bunch of things happen all at once. There is a loud flash and an invisible force slams into his whole body. Their captor drops her gun and falls to the floor. Sherlock grabs him and pushes him behind a pallet, then disappears in her direction.
Sherlock watches, concealed behind a tree, as John speaks to his grave, tears filling John's eyes and choking his voice. He says things he'd never said to Sherlock in life, never would have, never needed to. He says things that hurt to hear. He doesn't say the word Sherlock was never able to abide, and somehow that hurts too.
“I was never jealous.”
“Nature abhors a vacuum, Doctor. Particularly a power vacuum. When Moriarty fell, we all grabbed what we could. This is my little piece. Humble, maybe, but I have great hopes for it.”
“John…” Sherlock whispers.
"Yes."
“Yes,” says John. “That’s exactly what it’s like.
“He’s fine,” the DI assured him.
“Yeah. Right where you told us. Well, what’s the hold up? Fine.” He hangs up. “Gonna be a few, some trouble with the doors.”
John takes it all in silently, for long enough that Sherlock begins to worry in earnest. He can't read John's expression and isn't sure if his touch would be welcome.
John looks Greg in the eyes for the first time. They’re earnest, regretful and pleading. And afraid. He finds himself softening against his will, even if he’s not sure he’ll ever be able to forgive the man either.
Finally he squares his shoulders and heads out, back into London. He does not return to 221B Baker Street, and will not for a very long time.
"He killed himself to save us," John finishes. "You, me, Mrs. Hudson. He wasn't left any other choice."
things. The first is your perception of yourself as…a savior, a genius, a solver of the unsolvable. You want to be a hero, you want to be a
Sherlock pauses and instead of going back downstairs, he steps fully into John’s room, standing just a few feet from him, a little uncomfortably.
John wraps his hand around both of them and they rock together, Sherlock arching his back against him and gripping his arse tightly with both hands, pulling John’s hips to him, needing the pressure, needing the release. A few measured strokes from John’s strong hands send Sherlock over the edge and the sensation of his hot wetness spilling on John’s stomach and cock are all it takes for John to follow, collapsing on top of Sherlock as they shudder together, John never ceasing his kisses to Sherlock’s chest.
John appears on the stairs with Rosie on his hip, both looking disheveled and more than a little stroppy. “What paperwork can’t possibly wait twenty minutes? Or, you know, four hours, the way she’s been going. And who is that?” He motions to the polite-looking older woman standing next to Sherlock. “You haven’t even dealt with the client we have! And he’s been waiting since breakfast.”
"You promised," John cuts him off bitterly. "That you would never shut me out again. That you would try to remember what your death would do to me. And that if you really, truly had to jump, that you would let me jump with you. Or don't you remember? You made so few promises. And as with everything, you were
“No, not really, dear.” She gives him another knowing smile. Two weeks, he decides, but immediately reverses his decision when they get in the taxi and Sherlock swats his arse discreetly for making him wait.
Sherlock nodded tightly.
On the morning of the seventh day, John fairly slammed  Sherlock’s tea down in front of him, along with a piece of toast slathered in jam. “Eat, damn you.”
Sherlock strips John of trousers and pants efficiently, leaving him naked and quivering beneath the detective’s unflinching gaze. Pulsing with the need for relief, John reaches down to touch himself, but Sherlock bats his hand away with a hiss. “No. Stay!” he commands, bending down to take John in his mouth.
“And this helps you think? Really?”
“And if you had, out there on some lonely street thousands of miles away, would I ever have known?”
“She’ll be the only heir to the entire Holmes estate, mine and Mycroft’s. Unless he should take it into his head to have late-in-life offspring. Unlikely. And until then her trusts should cover school, university, several post-graduate degrees, synchronized swimming lessons, tattoos, tattoo removal, a wedding, a divorce, a trip around the world to ‘find herself’ or all of the above. I thought it best to allow for some unpredictability given her parentage.”
“Not yet,” John whispers to him, taking Sherlock in his arms, pressing bare chests together, John’s hardness, wet with Sherlock’s own saliva, digging  into his stomach. John strips him of trousers and pants and at last, with one steady hand on a sharp hipbone, touches him. Sherlock quivers under his hands and feels his skin prickle, goose pimples suddenly covering his body.
“Yes, thank you Greg,” John said, relieved. “You have no idea how important this is. The name is Sebastian Moran. I need all the records you have on him, everything, from every database.”
She cut him off. “It doesn’t matter what you are or aren’t. But you need to face the fact that he’s the most important thing in your life. Until you do, you’ll always be making promises you won’t be able to keep.”
John couldn’t argue with that. They parted ways, reluctantly, when they reached Jyivsinkää. Sherlock would not tell John where he was headed next.
"Oh, you're welcome," John says irritably. "I don't know, Sherlock. Organise your mind palace? Listen to the news? Play your violin."
and he’s back and it’s all he’s wanted for the past twelve months and now he hates him and wants him and needs him all at the same time.
"Sorry to interrupt, sir, Lady," he mumbles in a nasal South London accent. "But there's an urgent message for you downstairs, Mr. Colby. You must come right away."
"Took you long enough," drawls a familiar treble.
“Yes, but –”
He laughs. “Oh, she made a power grab all right but we sent her packing. Don’t know where, don’t care. Just wish I could have done the little
,” John says, grabbing his coat and pulling Sherlock down to him, kissing him heartily, hungrily, gratefully. Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise, then he gives himself up to the kiss and returns it eagerly. They break apart only when neither can go without oxygen any longer.
John had sworn he wouldn’t return to the flat. He didn’t think he could bear it, to be surrounded by all the trappings of their life together, all Sherlock’s things now abandoned and unused. How could he? He was burdened with enough memories as it was without encountering reminders in tea mugs and old clothes and microscope slides every time he turned around.
When John wakes he is alone, and the sun is up but it’s so cloudy it’s hard to tell what time it is. It’s not particularly alarming to find Sherlock gone – he can count on one hand the number of times he’s woken with Sherlock still next to him. He smiles to himself as he remembers the previous night’s activities, then frowns as he also recalls their deeply unsatisfying conversation afterward.
John frowns and nods curtly, wondering if he’s putting too much of this on Lestrade.
“I…I don’t know… I heard ringing but it wasn’t my mobile. I found this one behind some books in my flat. It’s not mine, I don’t know where it came from. Someone must have left it here. Is something wrong? Something’s wrong I know it.” She was tense, babbling as she always did when afraid.
John closes the distance between them, putting one hand on his daughter’s back and the other on Sherlock’s waist. He goes up on his toes to kiss Sherlock softly.
“No.”
, Sherlock. Just gone. And it could have been forever.”
“One on the mating habits of African pygmy tree shrews. Jesus, what kind do you think? I am a practicing physician, if you recall. I believe that’s one of the reasons you found me so
"You know what," John says, resignedly. "I don't care anymore. Do as you please. Smuggle your goddamn heart out. Build your own empire. I don't care."
"You're sliding up my torso, leaning over and rubbing your chest on my back. Your teeth are on the nape of my neck as your hands are rubbing up and down my arms. Your erection is touching the base of my spine and your legs are lined up with mine."
Sherlock raises a hand. "They've been tended to, I assure you. Don't trouble yourself."
"Yes," breathes Sherlock, eyes glittering. "I knew it!"
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE?
Victor appears thoughtful for a moment but then shakes his head. "No. Bad idea."
And yet it’s only the next day that John finds Sherlock high and his heart leaps into his throat. This is unprecedented – he never resorts to cocaine while on a case. It’s for the between times, and that’s bad enough.
“Don’t you see, John?” He connects the dots on the map and they slowly curve in on themselves.
Sherlock grins and obliges with enthusiasm. John doesn’t scream, but only because he bites the sleeve of his jacket hard enough to make a permanent imprint. Sherlock is bringing all his considerable skill to the table in the blatant attempt to get John to cry out, but John isn’t going to let him win today. It’s bad for his megalomania.
“I think that’s a bit unfair,” John said, hurt.
“Oh, please, let’s not do
Sherlock is paralyzed. This is new. His past encounters, few and youthful and generally unpleasant, were about taking – him taking from someone or someone taking from him. Nobody
"Four people. Passing us," he tells John.
“No…” says Sherlock slowly.
“Well, I
"As you resent nearly every attempt of mine to help you. But fine, consider this – even if you are both perfectly content with your current arrangement, and remain that way, string or no string, you are still quite likely to get him killed one day. In fact, the closer you keep him, the sooner that will be, even if he has no desire to get away.”
"Don't I?" Moriarty lets it hang there.
Keeping his eyes screwed firmly shut he lets his mind drift back to a place and time he’s spent two years trying to leave, until he’s no longer in 221B Baker Street, no longer feeling the steady heartbeat of his lover beneath him or smelling the moist and pungent aftermath of their sex surround them like a cocoon.
? This is out of a Jane Austen novel!”
But it ended up that staying away was worse. He could not afford to live in London on his own, even with his pension and the salary from the surgery – he wasn’t sure he could continue there anyway. The idea of another flatmate was unthinkable. Losing Sherlock was painful enough, but to live away from all the places they had gone together, all the things they had shared, staying in a cheap room in a soulless suburban neighborhood, it made him feel like everything was truly gone.
He knew many of their acquaintances treated them as a couple, and he never corrected them, though John always did. It wasn’t that he wanted people to believe that they were, he just didn’t see the point in trying to change their minds. He was uninterested in labels or definitions. Did it matter what others thought the nature of their relationship was, as long as they knew? But did they know? Did
Sherlock gives him the look that says “obvious” without having to risk saying it. “Because this is what I’m doing now. Not working when I should be working is unacceptable. My brain needs distraction, simulation, and to have that denied is painful. But right now both my brain and my body require rest and endorphins and sustenance before they can work at peak efficiency again, so I am doing exactly what I should be doing: thus the lack of insanity. Unless my current impulse to have my fingers inside of you while sucking you off as slowly as I can manage is a sign of mental instability…”
NOT MUCH OF. A FEW PARTS PER BILLION. IT’S NOT A METABOLITE OF THE HOUND DRUG IS IT? THEY LOOK SIMILAR BUT IT’S OFF ISN’T IT?
“Sherlock,” he said, putting a hand on the other man’s twitching knee to still it. “I don’t want anything else from you.”
“She did it because she was jealous of you, of your attention, it sounds like. But that doesn’t make it your fault. You couldn’t have stopped her. You were a child and she was… obviously very ill. You couldn’t have known, about that or about what she would do later.”
She rolled her eyes, as if annoyed by his mere presence. “You want see room? Upstairs. No English,” she said, grabbing a key off a hook by the door.
“He told me about your…history… with the drugs before I met you. And he said… he said that you were losing control again and that he thought if you did you would never get it back. That’s not true, is it?”
“That was an enthusiastic greeting,” he said, pleased. “What did I do to deserve that?”
should be more careful. He had acted confident when Moriarty tried to kill them both, but he knew he was on the losing side from the beginning. How had he let himself get into such a poor situation? What had he missed? He’d missed everything. He was missing everything now. No one could leave no trace, not even Jim Moriarty. And Jim Moriarty wouldn’t want to. It wasn’t part of the game to be unfindable. Sherlock must be playing wrong. But he didn’t have the rules.
At the station Victor sees him to the platform and forces a bone-cracking hug on him that Sherlock doesn’t really mind.
Moran gulped, and nodded in terror. John and Sherlock marched him outside. “Take that truck,” Sherlock said, motioning to a vehicle waiting by the gate. “Spread the good word.”
It wasn’t enough, he knew it, but what else was he supposed to do? He could hardly drag her into all this. He expected her to text back something on the order of “don’t bother” in response, possibly with several rude words, but instead she only sent,
John says as Sherlock inspects the wound to his hand.
“John, are you sure?”
Sherlock looks at John with wide, desperate eyes, pleading wordlessly. John can see Sherlock needs this, he doesn’t know why, but he needs it badly. And John can feel his own desire, so long controlled and managed carefully, screaming to be set loose, even as other parts of his brain recoil from the idea. He closes his eyes and makes a decision.
"Right. Well, she wasn't mobile then. She's into everything now, and she's like some kind of demon speed crawler. One second turned away and God knows what she'd get her paws on in this place." He scans the sitting room, searching for any potentially toxic substances.
At some point he manages to remind himself if he doesn’t get some sleep he’s going to be useless tomorrow and drags himself to the sofa. He still can’t face the bedroom. Sleep comes much faster than it has been for him and whether it’s the effort he’s put in thinking or the distraction of the case, at least tonight his dreams don’t haunt him so.
Okay, he has a lead, what next? He doesn’t know anything about oil companies or ships. This time it comes to him a flash, who can help him with this lead and give him cover for leaving London for a few days without attracting unwanted attention.
“You’re up early,” Sherlock comments as Victor pours him a second cup of tea.
John closes his eyes. “I didn’t handle that well. I should have said something sooner. I just… I want to understand you. Your past. Whatever is going on with Irene Adler. Why you don’t want… haven’t wanted… what we had before. I need to know what you want from me. From us.”
"John," he gasps.
“Right.”
Before John quite knows what is happening, Victor has thrown his arms around John’s neck and is crying softly into his shoulder.
“And you? You could live like this? If you couldn’t work, if you had nothing else, only me, but none of the elements of the life we’ve made together, just endless dependence and idleness, that would be enough for you, if you were with me?”
John does, however, have to institute a few rules for his own sanity. The first, only a week into what he has decided is indeed a relationship:
“Mmm, yes, that one was particularly lovely,” the detective’s deep voice purrs. “I think I may owe you for that.”
“Okay…well, the name was easy. We both saw it, ‘Abel Bryant’ stitched into his coat tag after he passed out. The golf… I did see calluses on his hands which I suppose you are going to tell me are indicative of an avid player. But how did you know he doesn’t enjoy it?”
"Thank you," Sherlock tells him. "I'm going to bathe now and then we'll go to Bart's and you can scan me again. More blood tests as well." Now that he has even this tiny portion of his senses back, he's hopeful again, certain that they can find a cure or at least a cause. He feels motivated, invigorated. It feels good.
“Sherlock, what in the world are you doing in here?” he demanded, holstering his pistol and rushing over to the bed.
which drug. And its molecular formula. Professional curiosity. Christ, Mycroft, you think I’m planning on fashioning a hallucinogenic bomb and making all of London go mad? I’m asking for an ounce or two. See, I think you
But he still held on to hope that he could think his way out of this. At least they were taking him out of his cell now, each trip a chance for escape or at least to learn something that might help him. And as time wore on and his tactics failed on Sherlock, Moran would become more and more angry and frustrated. He would be less careful, he would make a mistake. Hopefully that mistake would be something Sherlock could use, rather one that involved accidentally killing Sherlock before he got what he wanted.
off you will be
"You told her everything -- ?"
“Yeah, you’ll pardon me if I don’t rely on your word. Jan, Willem, hold him.”
John frowns, but doesn’t object. Sherlock doesn’t do well on a tether. “All right, if you must. I’ll get Bryant home when they’re done with him.”
Sherlock hesitates. “You meant it? When you said we should talk about things?”
Sherlock turns his focus immediately back to John. “Well, I’m sure it’s too late to get your money back on the hotel, but it can’t be helped. Now, what we really should start with is—”
“I suppose you wouldn’t buy that I’m starting a new life as an honest entrepreneur, trying to scrape up a living in the specialty shipping business?”
“Not yet,” Sherlock says. He needs to think about this. “Soon.”
“I said—hey, stop ogling me and pay attention.”
. You don’t like to admit it, but you care oh, so
LET'S GET BACK. SHE'LL CALL AS SOON AS SHE'S REVIEWED THEM. MIGHT BE TRICKY GETTING A TAXI THIS TIME OF MORNING THOUGH.
"I would never have let it get any farther, no matter what you asked me to do. And if you don't believe that, then we have a problem."
Sherlock nods enthusiastically. “Yes. Of course.”
“Then believe me when I say I absolutely cannot explain why I need this, but if you don’t help me we will both regret it for a very long time.” There was a pause. “You owe me, Greg.”
Sherlock straightens and adopts his brother’s buttoned up attitude with uncanny ease, quoting in a single breath: “ ‘You-win-Sherlock-I-can’t-take-another-day-of-watching-my-baby-brother-being-buggered-sixteen-ways-from-Sunday-in-the-sitting-room-it’s-indecent-worse-than-that-there’s-audio-and-as-a-point-of-interest-how-do-you-manage-that-thing-with-your-leg-no-please-don’t-
“Shhh,” John tells him, closing his eyes.
"No. We can't. I don't know what will happen if the truth comes out, but I don't want to find out. This runs deep. Here." He pulls the stolen laptop from his bag and hands it to Greg. "I imagine there’s a wealth of information on various nefarious activities, Moriarty’s and otherwise, on here. It's encrypted, probably very well, but I imagine you know people who know people who can take care of that sort of thing. Do whatever you want with it. I don't want to know."
