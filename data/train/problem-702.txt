The teenager sighed.
Sherlock Holmes, the man able to hide his feelings behind a mask, to erased them from his Mind Palace like they were "defective data", had a son.
Sherlock reflected quickly before smiling as well.
"You are going to think of me as old school, but I have to ask you: what are your intentions towards Sherlock?" she decided to ask.
How could he have foreseen then that John Watson, a doctor, a soldier miraculously survived a shoulder injury in the afghan desert, with his sweaters and his cups of tea, his reproaches and exclamations of wonder, would become the only person in the world without whom he felt incomplete.
A bitter sound came out of the slightly open lips: feelings...
"Do you remember what I told you when you got sick?" he asked.
"We live in the social media era, now it's easy to keep a long-distance relationship" said.
-Everything I've done, I've done so that you could be here today and look at me with that uncertain look on my face, undecided whether to believe me or not- concluded Sherlock again.
-Then it's okay... – he finally granted.
-I want her to know who I am. - Baby Girl added.
His memories were in a happy corner of his mind, guarded jealously, fighting the passage of time and the lack of new stimuli that led him to forget small details as the years passed.
After all, it's a date with your Sherlock... Perhaps the first of his life, so try to make it special-
He would recognize it everywhere.
John nodded.
On the bed that occupied the center of the room was lying a boy, sixteen years old at most, wearing a pair of perfectly ironed black pants, a white shirt and a black tie.
Almost without realizing it, John raised his hand and dropped it into his friend's rebellious hair, letting his fingers slip through the soft curls, following an instinct he had suppressed many times, as if it were a common gesture between them and not the impulse of a moment.
Sherlock took Hamish from Greg and moved towards the living room, settling on the couch.
-Not many... I wasn't a saint, that's true, and I admit I had my meaningless affairs, both as a boy and during my years in the Army.
-Isn’t he jealous that you spent the whole evening with me? -asked the doctor ironically.
"It’s up to you, honey: do you want to bother your landlady with my reproaches and your attempts to justify your behavior?" she asked in a calm voice.
In the short seconds before the gate was fully opened, Greg glanced at his image into the mirror, unable to hold back a grimace at the sight of the deep dark circles under his eyes and the stubbles that covered his chin and cheeks.
That little sound was enough for Greg to see that the detective had put all the pieces together and understood what was disturbing him.
The embarrassment had been enormous, but there had been no mortifying discussion as to why he felt the need to masturbate, as would have happen with her mother.
Listen, is Sherlock with you? -Greg asked.
In what universe did meeting Irene Adler and having that conversation seemed like a good idea?
John smiled.
He and John met in a... -said the woman interrupting suddenly, looking up at Sherlock's face.
-If I asked you the details of your relationship with John, you'd do the same thing- Greg said.
Lying would do nothing, not with Sherlock who was able to read his emotions and thoughts clearly on his face.
Why did they have to deal with that talk now?
"You wouldn’t know until you try" Daniel said, almost automatically.
Personally, Sherlock wouldn't waste a minute of his precious time with that little girl, but it was clear that Emma represented something important to John, so he would try to be civil.
John turned slightly and stared at the detective with a questioning look.
-William.
During my internship at the hospital, we talked several times about getting married and starting a family right after my first tour, but just before I left for Ireland she told me that although she loved me, she couldn't continue our relationship: she couldn't bear the idea of spending her days next to the phone or waiting for a letter constantly thinking about what might happen to me-John revealed.
Once again, John found himself with a dry throat, confronted with the naked truth: the fact that Sherlock was there in front of him, perfect despite all his flaws and mistakes, was almost a miracle.
A wonderwall is somebody you can always lean on, no matter what you need, they are always there for you"
John shook his head, remaining silent.
John smiled again.
"Because it's not easy!" replied John, raising his voice slightly.
Mycroft tilted his head slightly to one side, unhappy with the choice.
And she was right.
That's why I started to take amphetamines.
Looking back on Sherlock's face, their eyes met and for a moment, John felt the desire to go to Sherlock and absorb his charisma, his warmth.
The trio watched in silence as Rory was catapulted into 1930s New York and contacted the 'fantastic' River Song, making Emma jump on the couch in excitement.
"What are we going to tell people? “asked the doctor, before starting to leave small kisses on Sherlock's jaw and neck.
John smiled, and glanced at the detective's full and perfect lips, as if he had read his thoughts in that one breath, moving closer to his face and laying his forehead against Sherlock's, decreasing the distance between them more.
The smile on John's face grew even bigger, and the next moment the doctor took the few steps that separated them and stroked the lapels of the detective's coat with his gloved fingers.
Nobody likes to become a number in an air accident statistic.
He had so many questions about John's life during those three years he was away: starting with Mycroft's worthless collaboration, he had collected pieces of history wherever possible, beginning with Molly and ending with Mrs. Hudson, though the elderly woman didn't love particularly remembering what had happened and some pieces had returned to their place after the evening at the support group.
Differing from Donovan, who had come to see him in the hospital and had apologised for her involvement in the events leading up to The Fall helping progressing their relationship into a friendship, Anderson had never shown the slightest remorse for what had happened.
Greg sank his hands into the pockets of his pants and threw his head slightly back.
He came from a rich family like me; his father had founded a publishing house... We became lovers three months after we met and he was with me when I learned of my father's death-
During the three years of his disappearance, they met again and had a baby... And now this kid is in our apartment on Baker Street.
Smiling mischievously at the image of himself reflecting on the mirror,  John quickly got into the shower, letting a satisfied groan escape when hot water flooded his back and shoulders, softening his contracted muscles.
Greg raised his head unsure whether to leave the office and impose his authority on the two, when a silhouette caught his eye.
Sherlock's hands again surrounded his face, leading him to meet his gaze.
-I had to! It was the only way, why you don't understand? he asked, exasperated.
Sherlock's sentence struck him, leading him to raise an eyebrow.
And despite years gone by, it was still hard for John not to vent his anger on that idiotic, smug face.
-That’s what I said, isn't it? We've known each other for a couple of years and we've never been on a real date-Sherlock said.
"You should know by now that I'm not the type to indulge in useless actions" Sherlock said, starting the kettle and taking a clean bottle the next moment- John needed to be reminded that his place is here-commented.
But Sherlock had put Irene first.
Baby Girl nodded with conviction.
"Busy day?" he asked when they settled down on the couch.
The detective had spent most of Sunday lying on the couch, curled up in his fetal position, thinking.
John sighed and leaned slightly forward to lay the cup on the coffee table.
The older man sighed.
The smile he had in response to his words was the most beautiful and luminous to ever appear on Sherlock's face and managed to remove any doubts  remaining on  John's mind.
-Sorry Greg-
I want your hands stroking my hair while you're watching television, I want your mouth in so many ways that I don't even know where to start, I want people to see your smile but be the only one who knows what caused it.
He wasn't worth that much... Not as much as John.
He then took the stethoscope and moved it for a few moments to find the spot where the baby was placed, a smile framing his face.
Sherlock observed the small movements of his companion's jaw, busy enjoying the first bite, then sliding his gaze over his throat the moment he saw him swallowing.
"Listen, I promise to come back as soon as possible" John said, sinking a hand into Sherlock’s disheveled hair. - So maybe we can resume our conversation...-he added, bending down to put a kiss on the man's forehead.
Sherlock turned and saw her carrying a hand to her mouth, holding back a sob; he then approached the woman and crouched beside her, placing a hand on her knee.
That thought had crossed his mind many times in recent years, both before and after their forced separation and, while in the past  it was only a fleeting thought, an idea with which he would occasionally entertained himself, after The Fall had assumed the tones of nostalgia and regret, wondering each time what it would be like to hold the detective closer, to feel him tremble under John’s caresses and attentions.
-I don't know anything else-
-With a splash of milk and no sugar, if I remember correctly- he added, sitting in John's place, his cup clenched in his hands and a smile to bend his lips to the thought that before leaving, John had made his tea.
Sherlock shook his head forcefully.
Sherlock observed the contours of that familiar face, for the first time so close that he could smell mint and coffee in John's breath, his hands clenched in the black sweater that little could against the cold.
Sherlock stared intently at the doctor, blissfully enjoying for those brief moments the sound of his laugh, terribly jealous that it had been a stranger and not him to provoke that wonderful sound.
Now that he had started to unleash his desires, a thousand ideas crowded into Sherlock's mind: should he caress John's chest or continue to tease his neck with his lips and teeth?
And now he had had a chance to satisfy that curiosity.
And from the way things are looking, it is clear that your chances are diminishing more and more and more- Tommy concluded.
If Daniel would call him, he would meet him to get that information on the case, otherwise he would continue his investigation independently from the boy.
-Who knows? As far as I know they may have walked past me on the street while I was "busy" in my work- Daniel merely commented carelessly.
It was those words that woke John from his lethargy and awaken the anger that had been dormant all that time.
-I left the next morning, and my brother avoided any charges being made against me.
Greg nodded, his gaze on Daniel.
-Just a little scare, nothing more.

-So, who's the real Sherlock Holmes?
-Would you like Chinese? -John then asked him, getting up and heading towards the kitchen.
-Hello, Mrs. Hudson, how are you? -he asked her with a warm smile, which he reserved exclusively for the woman.
"What do you think?" he said, putting a cup in front of his mother.
"You know that I’ll take every chance to put my hands on you... - Jack joked with a smile in his voice.
-Yes,  master...-replied Greg with a lower and clearly mischievous voice. -And don't you fall asleep in your armchair as usual, you know it's terrible for your back-
John stared in disbelief at the man for a few moments.
Molly was busy not far from him and perhaps it was the presence of the woman that led Sherlock to start the conversation, eager to find answers to those questions that had been haunting him for days.
Again, Greg nodded his head.
Greg reflected a few moments on his words and then glanced at the book he still hold in his hands and nodded.
-Mh...-Sherlock just answered, clearly busy scrolling through the list of restaurants that owed him favors around London.
He was absolutely sure of that.
It's not the first time she's been a guest here, she knows Mrs. Hudson and she's very fond of her, and if I know her at least a little bit she's going to act like this is her second home- he continued.
"Nice to meet you young man" Greg said, hinting at a friendly smile- Ok, I'd better clarify a few things: I'm not going to hurt you nor have sex with you, I just need to ask you a few questions- he added in full honesty.
But John Watson was not a man who run away from adversity and danger, as a matter of fact he was the first to throw himself into the fray, but a part of him kept wondering if anything good will come from this meeting.
It was incredible how everything had changed in twenty-four hours!
"I'm sorry" he said sincere.
"Is this sink clean?" she asked.
Defeated and determined not to cause trouble in the restaurant, John slightly removed the chair from the table and sat down, his eyes still focused on his opponent.
-The truth? Who the hell asked you to do anything? -asked John irritated.
-We will leave him with Mrs. Hudson; since you came back, she became more affectionate towards him- Sherlock commented.
"What did Sherlock tell you?" she asked.
John chuckled, an image of his father covered in patches of grass and mud clear in his mind.
Maybe we could take his things to the room upstairs and I could move my things down here- John said slightly worried.
"Because" he said, meeting Harriet's gaze “this woman is the mother of his son-revealed John.
Jack watched him carefully for a few seconds before stretching out to his friend and place a hand on his right arm.
John frowned, clearly surprised, and even Sherlock wanted to let go of an expression of astonishment, but he kept the mask of indifference that ruled his own face.
He felt the blood throbbing in his ears and was only slightly aware that his chest was moving jerkily.
"Ask me anything you want to know, and I will answer" he said sincerely.
There was nothing John wanted more than to believe Sherlock's words and he almost had to stop himself so he will not run to the detective hiding in his arms, his face in the hollow space between his neck and shoulder, where Sherlock’s scent was stronger and forget those days of coldness.
Anyway, that night I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and when I got back inside, he was with someone else, busy checking the man’s tonsils with his tongue-
But if they would play their cards well, then there would be hope that everything would go as Sherlock had described last night: forty years of life together.
-The first rule of these meetings is confidentiality, we only know the names of our companions and their stories, but I know that you all have seen my face on the front pages of the newspapers in the last week-he said ironic getting a small laugh from the crowd.
After a quick shower, he had come down for breakfast, finding everything were had always been, on the same shelves, in the same cans, even on the same shelves in the fridge.
-Why is that? I had to quickly adapt to the "news" and come to terms with the knowledge that my life will never be the same again.
"It's not all this great distance" said John with a hinted smile before moving his head slightly so he could see the detective's face.
Sherlock was almost tempted to take up his challenge, clearly seeing how John was offering himself to his deductions, aware of the pleasure they would both derive from it, but merely granted him an enigmatic smile and slightly leaned towards him without ever leaving John’s eyes.
A confrontation would only lead to sarcastic responses, other frustration and anger.
Mycroft nodded slowly, rising to his feet as well.
Both Daniel and John turned to stare at the detective, with expressions of disbelief almost identical on their faces.
Sherlock met his gaze briefly and nodded.
Sherlock dropped a hand on John's legs, caressing his right knee slightly, suddenly aware that that unexpected intimacy was not enough; another reassurance that John was indeed there with him on a Saturday night, and not with Micheals or one of his fleeting conquests.
"Do you know why John used the cane?" he asked her cautious.
John then finished preparing quickly, picking up his wallet, his mobile phone and his keys around the living room and finally putting on his coat, kissing Sherlock one last time before heading for the door.
Since his return the detective had not missed an opportunity to torment him with his demands, which had brought back a sense of normalcy in his life, but until now Greg had proved adamant: Sherlock Holmes would no longer cooperate with Scotland Yard.
-If Clara had a baby during your separation, then come back to you and ask you to forgive her... Would you had done it? -asked John turning around and meeting his sister’s eyes.
on, as the sole listener of his monologue.
Greg had smiled at his companion and laid his hand on those of his partner, in a reassuring gesture.
Sherlock respected the woman's silence, drinking his tea now cold, giving her time to recover.
"What did you get it from?" he asked curiously.
-I'm going to give you one last chance Sherlock Holmes.
The reason behind John’s decision that had till now seemed so incomprehensible now became so clear, making Sherlock's lips part a little.
Those words would have offended him in the past, but now they seemed to be the most suitable: it was clear that Sherlock was trying to draw attention to himself, to avoid the most inconvenient questions.
He heard the chair creak and realized that Sherlock had turned to him, feeling immediately his piercing look upon himself, Hamish's voice the only sound to interrupt the dense silence between them.
All because of his fake suicide.
-You did the right thing, Mrs. Hudson-
Between them there had always been an ambiguous relationship, bordering on obsession, and the doctor admitted with himself that, excluding the severed parts in the refrigerator, he would change nothing: it is difficult to find someone who adapts so well to your habits and your quirks, especially at such a mature stage of your life, and that you complete yourself with its peculiarities.
"Also, don’t forget your infatuation with Irene" John said next.
_________________________________
John gave him a smile.
The sound of the kettle distracted him, leading him to approach the stove and pour the boiling water into the cup.
Sherlock was a volcano of passion hidden under a facade of calmness and indifference, capable of leaving you breathless with a single glance or with a touch.
When I was 16, my sister Harriet, came out to my parents as a lesbian, and within two days the whole city knew about it.
John moved closer to the man's face and kissed him, putting all the feelings he had not voiced, and which sometimes cut his breath for their intensity, in that kiss.
He decided on the second option, mainly to avoid scaring Mrs. Hudson, but also because he was unaware of the possible alarm systems installed in the meantime.
The reassurance that despite everything, John would always put their friendship, or what was born out of their friendship, above all else.
When I started to recover ten days later, they told me that the damage to my shoulder was almost certainly irreparable and that I could no longer operate.
-Are you kidding me? It's my only chance to date a celebrity" he jested.
John recalled how Sherlock had trusted him completely the day after meeting him for the first time, to the point where the detective involved him in his reckless lifestyle electing him his partner.
She didn't choose to come into the world, but now she has the right to have the best of what you can give her even if this will involve separating you from her-concluded the detective in a calm and serious voice at the same time.
Sherlock was sitting on the floor, on his knees, a dozen bath toys placed a short distance away on the floor, both arms in the tub, one committed to supporting Hamish's back and the other to rinse the soap that covered Hamish’s belly.
And clever… perhaps too clever, even for her own safety.
The silence fell again upon them as the doctor rethought the conversation he had that morning with his partner and the valid motivations Sherlock had found to convince him that it was not a utopian dream.
His father was absolutely right: he knew what he was up against by agreeing to start a relationship with Sherlock, actually it was the idea of that challenge that excited him the most, the possibility that he could succeed where everyone else so far had failed.
But there was a feeling that Greg couldn't shake off himself: the  certainty that there was something different.
Greg had pulled himself from his inertia and stared at him a few moments before nodding.
-As I imagined... However, as I said, despite a few sporadic occasions, they have a good friendship.
Slightly clearing his voice, John leaned back toward his own half of the table, raising his own glass and bringing it to his lips for a quick sip, managing to catch Sherlock's triumphant smile with the tail of his eye.
John's muscles stiffened, and the next moment his face moved away from Sherlock's, lowering his head to recover the demeanor needed to confront the intruder.
There was something about John's past that eluded him, something important, that had helped turn him into the inaccessible stranger.
He knocked twice on the frosted glass in the middle of the door and waited; a few moments later the door opened showing the solid and reassuring figure of his father.
The detective looked around and, after taking the milk out from the fridge and one of the best glasses they had in the house, brought the half-full glass to Emma, then returned to take care of his own tea, adding two teaspoons of sugar and milk, pouring clearly too much compromising its taste.
The woman shook her head and, after say farewell to the two men, retreated into her apartment, while Jack started going up the stairs, coming up to John.
-Why waste time on pointless chit chat? So, what do you want? -Mycroft asked again.
-Oh...-
I tried to tell him in every way, but he seems not to listen to me-said Sherlock, completely heedless of the shock that the restaurateur had just suffered.
Only good education, respect for people older than him and love he felt for his daughter had prevented Greg from sending him to hell.
Obviously, he had noticed his fears... Nothing escapes the eye of the great Sherlock Holmes.
With an unexpected smile to stretch his lips, Sherlock turned Hamish towards him and, cautiously, laid a kiss in his forehead.
Baby Girl nodded.
-Who are you? My father? -answered the slightly annoyed boy.
"I'll see you soon, Mrs. Hudson I promise you”
John nodded and pulled his keys out of his coat pocket, opening the front door and stepping aside to let the detective in.
Sally shrugged off that comment, trying to hide her wounded pride for the umpteenth time and sticking on her face the usual harsh expression that has always been her mask against Sherlock's attacks.
There was just one explanation. And it was the simplest of them all.
After accepting Sherlock's dinner date, John relapsed into his morning routine: breakfast, shower, beard, and then quickly dressing up to get to work.
Is it possible that once again the detective understood his deep-down desires?
He was aware that his partner would not be happy for his intervention, but a man of his stature and with his job could not risk being associated with the scum that at that time slept peacefully in one of the guest rooms.
Emma stared at him for a few moments, clearly undecided whether or not to believe him before letting go of another sigh.
He got up slowly, resting much of his weight on his cane and walked to Greg.
Gregory was leaving.
The detective shook his head again.
-The right thing for whom?
-I wanna be yours- Artic Monkeys
-So…-John said, turning a little towards Jack. "You want to tell me why you showed up here at two o'clock at night?" he asked.
An incredulous expression immediately appeared on his sister's face; her mouth wide open in shock.
Then he had closed the door of the apartment behind him and left.
John stood still for a few moments, looking at the man in front of him: Hamish George Watson was a 65-year-old man with blond hair now completely gray,  John's nose under Harry's eyes and a figure who, despite his advanced age, for John was still synonymous with safety and strength.
Guilty.
"I know- answered Sherlock promptly, his back shaken by a shiver of pleasure.
From his protected position, Greg looked around and checked that everything was still like it was in the morning, making sure no one had climbed over the cordon to snoop around, ruining the work of forensics.
Mycroft settled better in his chair, his back straighter with his most imposing figure, as if he did not want to leave room for possible attacks and joined his fingers a short distance from his face.
Like all teenagers, there had been a time in his life when John could not stop thinking about sex, and the pleasure that could come from it; many nights were spent in the silence and comfort of his bed dreaming and with the sole help of his hand to soothe the pressure that seemed to have taken hold of him.
-I like it.-
-But it didn't go that way.
-Jack's a military man, he's in high-risk missions: bomb alarms terrorism, stuff like that, but spent a few years in Iraq in special forces.
The silence that followed his long and articulate speech was deafening.
It was when he was busy repainting the bottom corners of the door that he realized that someone was staring at him.
-Everyone knew him: he called himself "Prince Henry" cause he was convinced he looked like the real prince- said Tommy with irony.
-What?- John asked, trying to hide the embarrassment that those words had provoked.
-John…-
-I'm going to do my best. As long as he doesn't understand everything from the crease of my jeans-
-You're such an idiot Sherlock. You never learn, do you? -he asked.
The doctor met Sherlock's gaze again and for a moment did not know what to answer: did Angelo know that the man was alive?
But of course, that wasn't his lucky day...
-I started with a few joints to calm my frantic thoughts, but soon some "friends" pointed out to me that there were other drugs that would give me the same effect but with a longer length.
Suddenly Mycroft remembered a detail that led him to stare at Greg for a few moments.
Nothing different than usual, but for Sherlock Holmes that day was perfect: he was finally coming back to work!
-Sherlock…-
-Yeah... He made me promise that I would keep an eye on you during his absence, and that I would let you back on Scotland Yard's cases.
Sherlock remained silent, forcing John to open his eyes and turn around, casting a circular glance at the living room: Sherlock was standing, in the middle of the living room, clearly unsure whether to move towards him or not.
-Harry would get really pissed with me...
-Okay. But don't say I didn't warn you-John said starting to search inside the pockets of his coat- Let's see... Does anyone have a candy?- he then asked not having find what he needed.
-John goes to clubs every Monday! Doesn't he get enough help on those occasions? - blurted the detective.
- What? Didn't you ever get a nickname when you were little? -Greg asked, a wry smile on his lips.
"And I need you too" admitted the detective, staring into the doctor's ocean blue eyes.- I'd be a horrible father if you weren't here to control me and then we both know I'm lost without my blogger-
"He was hustling around here, sometimes he would come to the diner before he would go home" Tommy added.
An embarrassed silence spread in the living room for a few moments, leading Sherlock to wonder if he had gone too far, but once again he was saved by John.
I'm going to keep tormenting you about food and the hours of sleep needed for a healthy life, and I'm going to keep scolding you for the body parts in the fridge and the eyes in the microwave.
"That's how he finds company every Monday" said Sherlock, trying to imagine the good doctor on the dancefloor, but he couldn't.
Had he not known Mycroft and his chronic mistrust of mankind John would have thought of a genetic trait of the Holmes family.
You have no idea...-John said interrupting the sentence in half and looking away from the detective for a moment.
-Have you forgotten your dinner at the Italian restaurant? There was no case to celebrate there- Sherlock reminded him.
-The poison does not leave a nice corpse: before dying the victim is prone to vomiting and seizures, unless he ingests a sleeping pill to control the side effects- John explained in a professional tone, continuing his observation of the body.
Harry remained silent for a few seconds, reflecting on the question.
Can I introduce you to Emma?
-Sherlock asked me out on a date tonight. A real date- John confessed giving a bite to his sandwich.
John smiled slightly and followed Sherlock with his gaze as he entered the kitchen.
We simply must continue our lives-answered Sherlock, trying in spite of himself to find a solution.
He had found father and son busy playing with colorful building blocks and wished them a good day and advised them not to do too much damage, then left the house walking the short distance between the apartment and the clinic.
Calculating the length of the train journey from London, John realized that Hamish had to be terribly hungry; moving with confidence, he briefly walked out of the kitchen and walked to the front door where he found the elegant blue-sea bag, just where Sherlock had left it upon his arrival.
I wanted to sleep with her myself the first time I saw her!
-John always hated her. He was really jealous of Irene and I must admit that I was unbearable for some time after her presumed death.
John arched an eyebrow at the same time surprised and amused.
John didn't notice that he had raised his hand until he felt his fist hit Sherlock's left cheek and the slight grunt came out of the man's lips.
And if that means disappearing from your life, I'm willing to do it, despite my selfish nature that would like to spend every single moment with you.
That's ridiculous! It's impossible that the poison came into circulation from his lips, it wouldn't have been enough!- Sherlock retorted.
"What’s that supposed to mean?" asked Sherlock as he turned around to meet his brother's gaze.
"No bad you too" he said, scolding himself the next moment for the misgrammar of his words.
-If I went to "Pride" tomorrow night, everyone would know my face, and not because I'm a regular visitor, but because of my "lost love"...
"Maybe you should explain the experiment to Misha one more time, maybe he was distracted the first one..." he pointed out, making a funny face to the child.
John smiled in return: it was not difficult to imagine a skinny, black-haired child with an inquisitive look, searching for data already so fundamental to the construction of his Mind Palace.
"To be honest, I have to confess that there is an important person in my life... - he said, meeting John's gaze again and noticing his surprised expression.
"If you think about it, I don't think you had any reason to act like a jealous boyfriend: we weren't even a couple at the time" Sherlock pointed out, rational.
Upon reaching that decision, Greg smiled kindly to Mycroft.
But no one, neither Victor nor Irene had left a hole inside him at the time of their departure... Not like John did.
Those words didn't particularly affect John.
Mycroft remained silent for a few moments, moving his gaze between Hamish and Sherlock.
-Hello, everybody. My name is John and I'm a drug addict-said with the voice that Sherlock always identified as "Captain Watson".
John stretched himself, tearing a groan from his lips for the atrophied muscles of his shoulder, before sitting down, giving his sister a glimpse.
Resuming the kiss interrupted moments earlier, Sherlock focused some of his attention on freeing John from his shirt, now dangling over his shoulders, undoing his cuffs and letting it fall to the ground, then wrapped his arms around John’s waist, chest against chest for a few moments enjoying the mutual feeling of their bare skin for the first time, satisfied groans echoing in the room.
"Get in line" he said, taking a long sip of coffee.
- In a flat in the building across from Gregory's apartment.
________________________________
"I'd ruin your reputation" the doctor jokingly said.
The boy frowned, clearly unconvinced.
I'm sorry Dan, but as a doctor, I highly suggest that you take a few days off-
-You were almost obsessed with Anderson that you wouldn't even notice if I'd hit you- he said.
I had to do it... I had no other choice- he started.
Harry stared at him for a few moments, the same shocked expression still painted on her face.
-All right, Gregory, let's do it your way.
-Sharing the apartment with Dr. Watson is not the wisest decision at the moment- rebuked Mycroft to corroborate his words.
Hope and Hamish ran to hug Sherlock clinging to the man's long legs and hips, snatching a smile from him.
Merely shaking his head, John moved back in the hallway toward the living room.
-It's late! - she almost scolded him.
Nothing different from the past weeks.
That was a situation he had never been in before, since he always avoided sentiment and feelings.
"Hello" John said, greeting the boy, then observing his old, poorly kept clothes, the thinness of the young man who denoted his malnutrition and especially his bruised face that made him understand the reason behind the late-night phone call.
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
The silence lasted for a few moments, but John had the absurd feeling that he had spent hours in that squeeze, before shaking himself and letting vent of the anger that still had not abandon him.
Jack hinted a smile and nodded, withdrawing his hand.
-Baker Street-
And who could be safer than the child's uncle, the gray eminence of the British Government?
There were still some issues that required his attention or his signature, but they were not urgent problems, so he had placed in his briefcase the laptop and the most urgent reports, had turned off the little light on the desk and had approached the hanger to retrieve his coat and umbrella, when he heard a slight blow on the door.
John nodded again and looked again at the man standing close to them and listening carefully at their conversation.
Ten minutes later Hamish was again secured against Sherlock's chest in the baby carrier and the two men resumed their exploration of the Zoo.
-You and Dr. Watson were inseparable at the time of your disappearance; and it was Dr. Watson who created the "
Irene entrusted him to you because you're the only one who can relate to him- Mycroft said.
He probably had to snap his fingers to make his admirers drop at his feet.
-No.. Yes... No…It's a long story-John admitted in the end.
Baby Girl listened for a few moments to the baby's heartbeat and then gave the earbuds to John who fixed the stethoscope back in his pocket, then stood up.
Daniel shook his head.
-What? No!
-If Clara...-began John, snapping the woman's gaze on his shoulders.
-Single. Apparently the members of the Spec. Ops. are more likely to have a career if they do not have emotional baggage.
Then suddenly he raised his head to meet Greg’ eyes.
There was no other solution.
Sherlock raised his head slightly, briefly meeting his gaze.
"Personally, I can't think of anything worse" Mycroft replied in a neutral tone.
He lifted the cellophane and observed the garment, checking that everything was in order, that it had not suffered any damage during those years and then laid it on bed.
Sherlock rose to his feet and with a few steps stood before him.
-Idiot...- John found himself murmuring trough gritted teeth, words echoing in the silent room.
And yet, he had never felt like that when he was with Sherlock...
Greg glanced behind his shoulder and nodded.
Why women when you were aware of your homosexual tendencies since you were a boy?
-Um. Ok... I better start to...-he said unable to finish the sentence.
"Hey Baby Girl" the doctor greeted her affectionately, slowly lowering himself next to the girl.
"Thank you for telling me" he said, sinking his gaze into Sherlock's.
No one knew better than John how quickly Sherlock gathered the information he needed to know everything about the person in front of him, and with how little tact he reported his deductions to the person of interest and everyone else nearby.
Sherlock look at his brother closely, looking for information that might help him, and after a few moments, he shook his head.
Is that what a person in love feels?
Black shirt covered with a sweater of the same color without sleeves.
-I think I would have forgiven her.
-But you don't get along the way you used to... -guessed Greg.
John greeted his words with an amused smile before straightening his back and starting to speak.
The sound of his mobile phone jolted him, and he was pulled away from his thoughts.
Sherlock remained silent a few moments, something Greg had seen only a few times; even during his investigation Sherlock Holmes was always moving, immersed in his reasoning voiced out loud and his sharp comments.
I don't want to talk to you right now... Believe me, you wouldn't like it at all if I stayed here and discussed this again with you - Greg warned him staring at Mycroft for a few moments with angry eyes.
-What? – asked Boss surprised.
-Mh... Try to hurry and maybe I’ll think about it-
“You don't have to.
"I knew that in the end I would be able to convince you... - he answered before moving closer to kiss briefly his full lips and then give his attention back to Hamish.
-Have you ever seen him dance? -
-I know you still have a few questions to ask me, and I promise I'll do my best to answer you sincerely, but first I need breakfast.
"I think it's better you go alone, you two have a lot to talk about" the older man said as he stood up.
Only Holmes men can be active and snappy as soon as they wake up... Oh no, wait, not even the Holmes man I know - John said with a wry smile before approaching his partner's face for a quick kiss on Sherlock’s soft lips.
"We met a few hours ago and had a short conversation to get to know each other better, after which he realized that he had abused your hospitality and left" the British official said.
Without noticing, a hand moved upwards, resting on the back of John's neck to bring him closer to Sherlock and close the slightest distance between their faces, thus bringing their lips together.
A tiny part of Greg’s brain, which is still rational, made him realize how painful those words were and how much in Mycroft's attitude, until then catalogued as furious and authoritarian, was actually hurt by something that had been tearing the man apart for several days.
"I knew it" said Sherlock, a small smile curving his lips.
The sound of footsteps moving away led him to look up, discovering himself alone in the living room.
The rest of the day passed quickly, one patient after another, focusing completely on his work and without giving himself any other distractions other than a short lunch to avoid arriving exhausted at the end of the shift.
Sherlock nodded slowly, lost in his thoughts allowing Greg to cast a glance at his partner, still completely focused on Hamish.
-He was dying-
"I know from personal experience that it's not easy to live with my son" said Lady Violet.
Boss's reassuring embrace that had rushed to console her would not help her or protect her from the horrible scenarios that Sherlock's words had now implanted in her mind; a hug would certainly not suffice to erase them or to ward off the bad thoughts that those words would bring with them.
He was tired of swallowing shoddy coffee, of the mountains of reports that seemed to perpetually clutter his desk, of the lack of professionalism of the guys on his team, Donovan and Anderson first.
"What an honor" she said wryly.
"You know the answer to this question better than I do Myc."
The ice-blue eyes he had always loved, always accustomed to hiding their emotions, now did nothing to hide the confusion and sense of bewilderment that was stirring in Sherlock.
Sherlock stared at her in disbelief, leading Molly to stared back surprised.
John frowned and stared at Sherlock perfectly motionless in his embrace.
Lady Violet smiled and stood a few moments in silence, before looking up at her son, who was serious again.
A slight noise behind him made him realize that his words had caught Sherlock's attention, enough to convince him to momentarily abandon his work.
John raised an eyebrow curious.
-Who? -
"You saw what?" asked Greg, his brow, now perpetually wrinkled.
"I’m sorry what?" he asked, cursing himself the next moment for the banality of his question.
"So soon?" asked surprised the other man, unable at the same time to hold back a smug smile.
- Sherlock …- John greeted him slightly embarrassed.
"Then my son is safe here" he said, and then headed to Lestrade's office.
He had smoked the first cigarette quickly, consuming it in a few puffs, and had lit another with the butt still on, slightly annoyed at his inability to silence John's words that still resonated in his mind.
Sherlock nodded.
Lestrade had sent him a SoHo address, so their cab took only twenty minutes to arrive at the crime scene.
"Maybe the girl took a smaller dose because she panicked at the last minute... - replied Sherlock.
-I don't know... I really don't know.
-Now I understand why Mrs. Hudson didn’t want a lift to the cemetery...
And this “label” will stick on our kids' lives and that's why I want to be there today marching in the front rows with the other families Sherlock...”
Standing in the doorway, John picked in the hallway and as soon as he met his father's gaze, he felt every single muscle in his body stiffen: Hamish Watson stood still on the kitchen doorstep, one arm placed under Hamish's butt while the other arm was bent at chest height holding between two fingers the small hand of the child who, perfectly at ease, carefully observed the elderly man as if he wanted to catalog every wrinkle, facial expression or patch of skin.
-I've been away for a long time. But now I'm back- he answered.
-Sherlock your son is only seven months old.
-It was all really sudden. The day before I met Mrs. Holmes and we talked about a future together, about getting a dog... Believe me, I was ready to start that sex marathon... And the next moment everything collapsed- John tried to explain.
-What do you usually do when you bathe? -Sherlock asked her to start the conversation, even though he felt shuddering at the banality of his question.
It was obvious that John was angry, his body radiated aggression and frustration, and Sherlock wondered what to do or say to avoid the quarrel that would otherwise ensue.
-So, what's married life like? - Sally asked with a pleased smile on her lips.
-What the heck…- Sherlock asked, looking at John.
"Why not his father?" he asked.
He worked with kettle and mug making as much noise as possible, trying to give even a minimum of privacy to the two adults, but still managing to hear some whispered phrases.
Knowing Sherlock that option would never have been available even if he had been still alive.
Jack raised an eyebrow, asking him a mute question, before shaking his head.
John took ten seconds to understand the true meaning of those words before letting go of a happy and surprised smile; he wanted to grab the lapels of Sherlock's Belstaff and succumb to the temptation of those drawn lips, but decided that for the moment he would be content to slide a hand on the solid chest of the man, covered by the coat.
-Baby Girl, we've already made this conversation: if you want your baby to be healthy and strong, you must take vitamins.
There'd be a line of guys ready to flirt with me just so they could brag about how they slept with Sherlock Holmes' ex-boyfriend... You don't know how much I'd like to fall asleep and wake up when everything is back to normal- retorted John snorting annoyedly.
John would have done anything to make those hallucinations come true, and now that his wish had been granted, the relief and happiness that was certain would accompany those moments had been replaced by blinding rage.
-I don't know Sherlock. Are we really considering this idea? -John asked him skeptically.
And who would have guessed that a man so gangly would be able to dance like that?
"Why did I become friend with her in spite of everything she did to us?" he asked, receiving a nod in return.
He had feared that the man would soon tire of following them through the corridors of the museum, beginning to wander alone in search of something interesting for his own mind.
It was an important step, he was aware of it, especially for a man like Sherlock who had always valued his own intimacy.
"What are we going to do with Hamish?" the doctor asked, casting a glance at the child busy playing with his toys.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders, slightly covering his mouth with his right hand, as he always did whenever he was embarrassed.
"You want my little girl?" asked Baby Girl, the confusion clear in her gaze.
He also understood why Mrs. Hudson had not wanted to visit the cemetery...
robe,
"What’s new?" Sherlock said, letting himself fall on the couch with his innate grace.
-But despite knowing him for many years, I can't tell you if he will forgive you.
Sherlock's shoulders stiffened, and that simple gesture was enough to make him understand what the other was hiding from him.
A pop song rang out from the amplifiers, leading the crowd of men on the dancefloors to utter shrill cries that prompted the detective to roll his eyes, before catching the amused smile on the doctor's lips.
Perhaps he could have met her for a few minutes, giving her his congratulations for finally succeeding in taking Sherlock away from him and then leaving without listening to what Irene had to say.
He undressed and got into the shower under the hot water jet, taking care of his own hair until they were back to the original color, then focusing on sore muscles, and coming out of the shower only when the water began to cool slightly.
John continued to walk, careless of people's curious glances and shouted questions at him at a speed unthinkable even for Sherlock and tried to stop a taxi, which passed him by careless of his outstretched arm.
"You didn't, but next time could you avoid being as quiet as a damn cat?" he asked in a calm tone, trying to put Sherlock at ease.
What struck John incredibly was Sherlock's behavior.
Trying to recover from his treacherous thoughts before Sherlock could read them directly from his face, John cleared his throat and laid his eyes on Emma, who in those few moments of silence had remained beside them and who now watched them curiously.
It was a lie, but he was aware that the truth in this case would annoy not only Baby Girl, but also John.
-From my point of view it seems that that was your goal...- commented Sherlock cold as usual.
"Mrs. Hudson only found out yesterday.
-Wrong.
Sherlock pushed down again until John’s cock was deep in his mouth brushing against his throat. He swallowed tightening his suction and feeling the rest of it throb. John’s fingers in his hair increased their grip, almost getting painful, without John making any hint of moving his hips towards Sherlock's mouth, appealing to all his willpower, enjoying every moment until Sherlock pulled his mouth away from his erection.
Sherlock brought his lips closer to John's ear and kissed the earlobe, teasing him with the tip of his tongue and then sighed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again, fighting between the urge of getting up and leaving the man without another word or the desire to ask him a few more questions.
John turned to his left where with a changed attitude, not at all dented by the wet and smelly pants stood Sherlock Holmes, his gaze fixed on Tommy, clearly busy to read every little secret from the boy’s posture and hair.
It was clear what the true meaning of those words was, and Jack had no intention of being intimidated.
John took the earbuds off his ears and passed them on to the girl, allowing her to hear her baby's heartbeat, causing tears to spring up at the corners of her eyes.
Thank you for always trusting me, for being by my side despite my anger outburst, my depression and my irksome drunkenness.
John turned his back on Sherlock, but the black-haired man read from the relaxed posture of his shoulder and back muscles that the music was to his liking, despite having no idea who the composer was or the name of the symphony.
John sighed and looked back at the child, barely noticing his father as he walked down the hall.
-Mh... You write that you can recognize a airplane pilot by his thumb...-started John between morsels.
-The living room is already messy as it is, if we add your belongings we will no longer be able to move-comment Sherlock moving his head left and right, considering the proposal.
At the time he had misclassified them as signs of disapproval, of reproach, without ever seeing them for what they really were: the desire for something you know will never be yours.
It was an instinctive decision: the moment before, John's back was still resting against the balustrade of the bridge, a hand engaged in fiddling with one of the buttons of the Belstaff, the next that same hand had risen behind Sherlock’s neck, his fingers to caress soft curls at the nape of his neck, bringing the detective closer to himself, the body pressed against Sherlock’s.
It had been his idea that date and throughout the day he had planned everything for the evening to be sure everything will be perfect, but there was always a slight chance that something could go wrong compromising further their relationship.
Because of those negative thoughts, the feeling of joy and excitement he had felt even an hour earlier had slowly faded, leaving him at the end with the conviction that perhaps it had not been a good idea to accept that invitation, not in their current situation, and that the best thing to do once he arrived at the clinic was to inform Sherlock that he had changed his mind and that it was better to arrange dinner for another day.
-You're the only one who can take care of Hamish, and he's going to have someone to deal with who won't be spooked by his unusual intelligence, who won't let him be targeted or make his own mistakes when the "voices" in his head are too loud.
-Are you telling me that I’m wrong? That this child's appearance and John's disappearance are not connected? -the inspector asked him.
"You're early" said Sherlock, standing in the hall, waiting for John to close the door behind himself.
-Is everything okay? -asked fearful Baby Girl.
Mycroft remained silent, turning his gaze to the wicker basket, where unaware of what was going on around him, baby Holmes continued to sleep blissful.
-If I'm not daddy, then who am I?- Sherlock asked.
"How can you call it a mistake?" asked clearly confused Molly.
-What? -
-Okay...- Greg said clearly surprised by those words- Chinese? -
With a small groan he had sat up on the sidewalk and had brought a hand to his mouth, wiping the blood that had come out of a cut on his upper lip.
"Ah well, I see you're already awake" Mycroft said as he stepped into the room.
Once again, as a few days earlier, Sherlock was offering him everything he had ever wanted, even when he was not yet aware of it, but John Watson, former Captain in Her Majesty's Northumberland Fusiliers, after having survived explosions, snipers, mad criminals determined to kill him, perhaps had finally found the only weapon capable of destroying him.
The woman stood motionless, one hand still on the door, her gaze fixed on him, a smile that disappeared instantly replaced by an incredulous expression that turned in into an indignant sneer.
And if I were you, I wouldn't be looking for a hidden place, in fact I'm convinced it's in plain sight-said John.
When he opened his eyes again, he had to blink several times to make the watery veil that clouded his vision disappear.
-To be honest Doc, I didn't want to hear your lecture if I hadn't followed your recommendations...- jokingly retorted the other man, making John laugh.
He stood motionless, lying on his back on his bed for a few moments and listened to the conversation coming to him through the closed door.
Then one day everything started to collapse...-
But Sherlock shook his head.
Four days earlier, the last time he had seen Sherlock, they had had one of the ugliest fights, second only to their clash after his return to the Land of the Living... What should he expect now?
-I can clearly see your charm now... Anyway, I met a girl and her father didn't want her to date a criminal like me, so I cleaned up and enrolled in the Police Academy-
The two children hugged him one last time and then ran away, following Uncle Greg out the door, walking down the steps with Hamish running ahead and Hope with extreme caution holding Greg’s hand.
-Guilty... But I thought it was one of the things you loved the most about me, William-
-Why Surrey? - asked him curious.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders and abandoned the towel on John's armchair, then stopped by the sofa.
Sherlock looked up from the microscope and stared at him for a few seconds.
John Watson was a man who accepted no imposition from anyone, not even the British Government himself, capable of offering himself as a human shield against the greatest criminal mastermind he had ever encountered or willing to blow himself up rather than continuing to be part of the game that would end up killing other innocent victims.
John shrugged his shoulders, only partially surprised by that question.
I would say that he underwent a cycle of chemotherapy, he had early positive results, which would explain why hair loss is limited only to the base of the skull, but he needed a second cycle and when it became clear that there no hopes he would make it, they made the suicide pact- concluded in a professional tone, but with a slight smile.
The man’s clothes were well kept, clearly ironed the day before, a slight hint of beard began to be seen on his cheeks and at first glance there was no evident sign of injections, but John was aware that those could hide in the most unexpected places.
Sherlock's elongated fingers took the sides of John's sweater, pushing it upwards, forcing the doctor’s face to move away from what had become his favorite place to get rid of the garment, only to finish undoing the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt.
-John, dear why don't you come inside and get a cup of tea? - she asked him.
He knows when to remain silent and on the sidelines when I had a bad day at work and I need time to leave everything behind and knows when to raise the heating temperature to prevent the damaged muscles of my shoulder from getting numb-said the doctor, listing all the little attention Sherlock had always had for him and that now seemed like little gestures of love.
Sherlock entered the hall and stood motionless by the door, his gaze fixed toward the stage, where John was approaching the stand.
I don't doubt that they slept together...-
-Anyway... It's all good, it's all as usual, except that now we know that we are a couple and we have an infant running around the house- John said between bites.
Greg sat up without untangling their fingers and gave him a mischievous smile.
"To make my life hell once again" answered the man.
Mycroft turned slowly towards him and stared at him.
-I had to. I couldn't let her die.
He was wearing that damn coat, too.
"You don't know how much I'd like to punch you right now" Greg said without looking away from his unexpected guest.
-Think wisely before you blew this chance…It may be the last one you have-
______________________________
After a long moment of silence their breaths returned to normal and John found enough strength to move his head until he met Sherlock's gaze: a peaceful and happy smile bent the man's swollen lips and John could not stop himself from kissing them lazily.
-Why is that?
"I know I should have talked to you about it earlier, while you were still abroad, but in my defense I can only say that I thought I had more time to gather my courage and talk to you about what had happened- Greg continued.
"Hi Sherlock" she said, smiling at him, before going to sit in John's chair.
But I love you and I'm willing to do it because I'm convinced that what we have you and I will pay me back for the choice I made-said Greg stretching an arm on the desk, the palm of his hand upwards.
-Then what's going to happen? -
What did you expect me to say when you told me that you knew about my hook-up?- Greg asked him, stopping by the bed with a shirt in his right hand.
"I thought that after I informed you of the boy's departure, I would inform you that I was aware of your "mistake", but that I had decided to forgive you...-
Moving into John's embrace, Sherlock turned and moved around the blonde, settling behind him and placing both hands on John's hips, relaxing further as the blonde head settled on his right shoulder.
-Obviously none of them, Lestrade.
As soon as the cab stopped, the detective jumped out of the vehicle, headed for the area restricted by police cordons, leaving it to the doctor to pay for the ride.
-Don't be rude Sherlock...-she kindly scolded him.
"I thought you'd changed your mind since Hamish crawls around the house most of the day" he said.
"Sherlock stop it, shut up!" John reproached him again, feeling an unexpected rage running through his veins.
There must have been a moment of truth
Accompanied by the applause of the crowd, John walked away from the stand and slowly descended the steps, returning to sit with the other members of his group.
John stepped forward and remained silent as he watched his friend, aware that whatever he said would be the wrong thing; only when Sherlock met his gaze again, John felt that all was fine.
-I know, I know, it can seem absurd, especially given everything we've been through to get here and how intertwined our lives are.
"But I wouldn't be able to recognize your lies" John pointed out, aware of the man acting abilities.
The other shook his head.
-Why is that?- he asked confused.
-Hey Boss, how's it going? -asked John kindly, a slight smile on his lips- Look who I brought with me-said again John, moving slight his head in Sherlock’s direction.
John entered the apartment and closed the door, smiling at Sherlock when he saw the detective standing still waiting.
-Well...That will do - he murmured before turning around and heading to the door of the bedroom.
But above all the most annoying question of all: what have these strangers more than him?
It was only using the "Captain" voice that John managed to convince her to enter the tub and for a few minutes the little girl hummed to herself, while John would flock to the kitchen to prepare popcorn and sandwiches for dinner.
-You don't have to feel obligated. But it's clear that Emma would like it if you joined us- he said.
-If you're scared, I can be your personal guard and drive away all the bad guys-said Emma looking at Sherlock.
John chuckled.
Maybe I just wanna be yours"
"I don't understand why you're inviting me out on a date" he replied sincere certain that Sherlock would help him shed a light on that mystery.
"I can't think right now. And it's not Daniel's fault, at least not completely, but because I can't think that it was so easy for you to doubt me and believe that it was so easy for me to cheat on you with the first cute guy walking down the streets.
"Then let’s hear it: what's your idea?" John urged him to speak,  looking back at him.
Their glances met and slowly a sympathetic smile appeared on the woman's face.
"The victim's name is Prince Harry, did you know him?" he asked.
-Your real one? -
What would John do if she tried to get Sherlock's attention again?
Fully awake, John frowned, moving his head on the pillow to observe Sherlock's face, for once serene and fast asleep; he studied the shape of his face, the disheveled curls that fell on his forehead and on the pillowcase and his lips perfectly  drawn, those lips that the night before had promised him a future together, before signing the agreement with a kiss.
My request is all too clear, so now it's up to you to tell me your price - Mycroft said to him, determined to close that matter as soon as possible.
For a few moments there was silence, allowing him to read the name on the screen.
-It all happened in two weeks, always in Germany... There must have been something in the air. We left Berlin the day after the first time, moving to smaller cities.
"So, where have you been these last few days?" John asked, looking back at his friend.
"What can you tell me about him?" asked Greg, taking his notepad from his raincoat pocket and opening it on the tabletop.
By the time John woke up that morning, his sister was already gone.
Sherlock remained silent, weaving his long fingers at the height of his stomach, in an unusual but hopeful pose that he hoped would convey confidence.
True to his promise, Sherlock took only ten minutes to get dressed, and when he stepped out of his bedroom, he was impeccable as usual with a white shirt, buttons invariably stretched on his chest, and a pair of black trousers that put an emphasis on his narrow hips and long legs.
-Absolutely not...-said Sherlock looking at him from behind long black eyelashes- But I think you have to know everything if we want to hang out...-
Sherlock watched him go away and, unconsciously, passed his tongue over his lower lip on which there was still some trace of the doctor's taste, and then fastened the Belstaff to shelter from the cold that had caught him the moment the embrace had ended and to hide the erection that didn’t seems to go down.
Despite his efforts, a slight anger had begun to take hold of Greg.
But, most importantly, Sherlock was there for John. Because John was there and Sherlock Holmes belonged everywhere John Watson was.
________________________________________
You left me alone, Sherlock!
"The last time you had to deal with journalists, you loudly proclaimed your heterosexuality” he said.
You've got me and Hamish now—Sherlock said moving his face closer to John, the tip of his nose stroking John’s cheek, letting the silence fall.
"ANSWER ME!" the detective urged him.
"And will you be completely sincere?"asked the other.
For a brief moment John felt guilty about the punishment he had inflicted on his friend, but he took a hold of himself by recalling the chaos that had been unleashed and was still raging in his mind since Hamish's appearance.
"It could be  great for Misha" he said.
Why had he never noticed the little attention John was having for him?
A well-orchestrated unforeseen incident had called Gregory back to Scotland Yard that morning very early, leaving him free to implement his plan: today was the day when Mycroft Holmes ended the shameful relationship between the detective and that young boy.
"What do you think?" asked John -Open the door, Sherlock! -
-I would have told you as soon as you came back in the living room...-said Sherlock to John.
Being honest with himself, Lestrade was willing to admit that he would gladly accept Sherlock's help, despite the not-so-veiled insults and invectives that would surely accompany him, but after what had happened the last time they had worked together, he didn't feel like risking it again, even if it meant the increase in unsolved crimes.
He needed to know that nothing had changed for John, that having definitive confirmation of what had been only a suspicion so far, did not make him different in his eyes; that for John his deductions would always remain brilliant, that the feeling between them would not be tainted because of his past...
Instead, as always, they will play by the rules of the great Sherlock Holmes...
-He stayed in bed for almost a month.
They had just come out of a pub, but it was clear that the only thing that had drawn them there had been the sheltered and warm place to fight the cold evening wind: from that distance to Greg it seemed that both were under twenty-five years old; while one had short brown hair, the other had red, thick hair long enough to making him look like a woman at a first glance, if he had not paid attention to the broad shoulders.
-I'm a big fan of your blog, you know? "Jack continued, then brought the bottle to his lips.
-It’s not Hamish’s fault…He’s adorable and beautiful and he's going to be a great kid.   It’s because of that woman.
"It would have annoyed me if she didn’t" admitted the man.
Besides, you weren't allowed to back down, since my mom's going to have a chat with you.
"It's the first time I've heard you say a kind thing about my sister," John said.
-If you want, we can wait until we find the perfect dog for us-
Someone with whom realize his dream of a companion for life and children.
A bigger smile curved Greg’s lip.
-S-Sherlock...-
"I owe you an apology Holmes" she said, addressing the man by his first name.
-Baker Street... Barts- listed Sherlock.
"An innocent man" by Billy Joel
For makin' me believe
Determined to continue that positive trail, John moved closer to Sherlock and placed a small tender kiss on his lips, his eyes open to meet the detective's ice-blue ones.
His loyalty to Mycroft is almost cloying- comment John before taking another sip.
"Where is John? “asked Sherlock, unable to hold back any longer.
I know it's not going to be easy: there will be good days and days when we're going to fight and I'm going to walk away slamming the door.
He could have understood and forgiven what had happened if it had happened only once and especially if, as Sherlock's words had confirmed, he could have blamed Irene for the “incident”.
At those words, John burst into a happy laugh that shook his shoulders and led him to abandon his head against Sherlock's right shoulder, Sherlock's low, thundering laugh in his ears.
John swallowed, raising his eyes to meet the icy-blue ones of the detective.
"I think he erased it from his Mind Palace" John said, prompting a smile for the detective, who tried to hide it with his own cup of tea.
-So...-
"After the accident, this shoulder became particularly sensitive" he said in a broken voice.
Two more chapters till the end, are you ready?
Jack stared at him, surprised at the interruption.
"That certainly makes it less boring" Sherlock said in a hoarse voice that he hurried to hide clearing his throat.
Trying to get a hold of himself, not to let the incredulous expression that had surely appeared on his face shine through, the detective shrugged his shoulders.
At the time those words, despite being the result of the experience, had not been of much help, but now John found himself reflecting again on that speech: Sherlock was alive.
-Did you solve the case? -
John sighed satisfied and nodded.
Mycroft had remained silent, unable to find the right answer, and that was when Greg intervened to help his partner out of that impasse.
Is it really wrong to hope to have what you and Dad had?  -he asked her.
To those words, John sighed: sometimes Sherlock could be really obtuse! Even more than Anderson.
Maybe you will spend days without thinking about Sherlock, until something completely disconnected from him or what you had together will bring him back to your mind-
-And I did-
John nodded in turn and moved to pick up the book on the coffee table between them.
-Shut up Anderson! -John promptly intervened, aware of the demons that were tormenting Sherlock at the moment.
"Hamish James Holmes" said the other man again.
On the short journey that would take him to the bathroom, he turned off the music and once inside, he closed the door behind him, locking it the next moment.
Greg approached them and stared at them for a few seconds, trying to gather as much information as possible, cursing Sherlock once again for leaving him alone in this investigation; it was then that he noticed the great age difference between the two boys: while the red-haired boy was around twenty-five years old, the brown-haired boy was definitely eight years younger.
The little girl nodded.
But fortunately, when Sherlock's perfect, naked body had presented itself to his eyes, John had regained self-awareness, making him realize that that intimacy, Sherlock’s eyes that were staring back at him completely honest and even slightly frightened by the intensity of his feelings, was a gift too big and important to be wasted in a gesture of retaliation towards The Woman.
"You were convinced that I was sleeping with him" he said shocked.
The detective merely shrugged his shoulders once again to confirm his words.
And honestly it's something I'd like to avoid if there's anything I can do to prevent it-concluded Sherlock with the same confident voice as ever.
It wasn’t the first time that he was labeled the bad guy, and after all, it was the label that hurt him the least, but is it possible that people always needed a scapegoat?
As usual, his decision turned out to be the right one.
The doctor shook his head, feeling Sarah’s presence next to him.
When he finally regained full consciousness of himself, he had noticed some small changes that had taken place in Greg, starting from the smile that illuminated him every time he received a text, the smell of the different aftershave, ending with the clearly more expensive shirts.
Greg returned his gaze, unsure whether to believe his insinuations or not, but once again deciding to drop the argument.
Was he really willing to let someone else endure the same bullying and mistreatment he suffered during his childhood because of ignorant children frightened by his superior intelligence?
