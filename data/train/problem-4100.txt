“Hey Cas,” Dean responds, with a soft, lazy smile. “We really need to teach you about pajamas man, especially if you’re going to sleep in my bed.”
And, yeah, it probably was not a good idea to let that command get to him. The guy was only doing his job, for Christ’s sake. But Dean couldn’t help it that Castiel had a voice like pure sex, like someone had fucked his throat so many times that he could only talk in low, gravelly tones. Add that to the combination of bed hair, intense blue eyes, and soft full lips, and it was no wonder that Dean felt a little shaky as he moved to stand.
Dean was sliding his arm off of Cas’ shoulder, but turned to face him. They were talking quietly to each other so that Sam could not hear what they were saying, but he could see the way they were looking at each other. They were in each other’s personal space, even more so than usual. This was it. The spell was working. Any minute now…
Dean felt a gloved finger slip inside of him. It wasn’t painful, but it felt odd. His instinct was to push back out against it.
“Oh, it’s on!” Dean shouts, launching himself at Cas. He tackles the slimmer man to the ground, rolling them both through the snow. They wrestle around like children, smiling and laughing the whole time, until finally they lay side by side, panting in the cold air.
When the waiter from last time comes around to ask if they need anything, Dean puts his arm around Cas’ shoulder and smiles at the waiter with pride in his expression.
Lawrence is one of those towns most people don’t give a second glance. It is an average sized town, with average businesses, and average people. Tonight those people are going about their average lives. Shopkeepers are locking their doors, as people head home to have dinner with their families. It is nearing sunset, as the town quiets down for another evening. The sky is a vibrant orange, stretching out across the Kansas plains.
“Yeah, except for the part where you brought something back to our base that looks like our father. Could be anything Sam. A ghoul, a shifter, a witch using a glamour spell...”
Dean gave him a death stare. This was not the conversation Dean had hoped to have. He thought Sam was going to tell him this was all in his imagination or something.
Apparently, it wasn’t that easy.  Dean could not get the image of Cas’ wings to go away.  It seemed that Dean Winchester had a wing kink, and his best friend had just sent him a picture of his wings.
That was until Castiel reached down to start stroking Dean’s cock in time with his movements inside Dean. Dean let out a long, low moan. Everything felt so good. He didn’t know if he should fuck forward into Castiel’s fist, or arch back onto his fingers. He tried to do both, and ended up a panting, writhing mess on the exam table. A sheen of sweat broke out across his forehead. He couldn’t remember sex ever feeling like this before. He already couldn’t wait to come, knowing how it would feel amazing, but also not wanting it to end.
Then Dean remembered how good Cas looked in regular clothes and kind of forgot about everything else for the rest of the day.
Late on Christmas Eve, they all sat up watching the twinkling lights on the tree. It was idyllic, and the only thing missing was a roaring fire. Dean figured the absence of any demonic activity in the area more than made up for that fact. Just before midnight, Sam had declared he was tired and had gone to bed. Kevin followed soon after, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
Dean was feeling fairly buzzed and happy at the end of the first movie and halfway through the bottle, when he got a picture message from Cas.
“Don’t worry,” said a thin voice from beside Dean, and when he turned to look there was a lady who only reached his elbow, with grey curly hair, looking up at him.
“If someone is trying to break open the cage,” Sam says, “There is only one place I can think they would go.”
Cas strode off down the aisle to find their purchase. Dean stood there, shaking his head, knowing that whatever Cas brought back they were going to spend the day building it and that Dean wouldn’t leave him to do it alone.
Charlie arrives at the bunker and quickly takes over another spare room. Dean wants to ask about her mother, how the funeral went, and offer his sympathies. But, he knows if Charlie is anything like him, she’d rather not talk about it. So he stays quiet on the topic. Charlie can bring it up when she is ready.
John runs his hand along the roof of the Impala, studying the paint intently. Dean thinks the conversation is over, but then John clears his throat and looks over to his son.
Dean drummed his fingers on the counter in time to a Zeppelin song that had gotten stuck in his head. He picked up his soda to take a sip. He turned to see the two attendants leaning close together and whispering to each other.
“Certainly brother,” Azrael sneers, “Just hand over the angel tablet, and the Winchester’s father, and I will allow you all to live.”
“Huh,” Dean comments, running that idea through his brain. Crowley may be an asshole, but he also may have just invented a foolproof weapon for fighting angels. Could come in handy if Naomi, or any of those dicks, come looking for Cas.
It’s a good thing the Men of Letters bunker is meant to house an entire secret society. Sam and Dean each have their own bedrooms, which is nothing short of a miracle after growing up sleeping side-by-side in dingy motel rooms. There are still more than enough rooms to accommodate their two new houseguests. Dean makes sure Kevin has his room figured out, then goes to check on Sam.
The doctor took Dean’s wrist in hand, pressing two slender fingers to his pulse point. He looked up, to give Dean a reassuring smile, and Dean drew in a sharp breath at being so close to the doctor’s gaze. From far away, the doctor’s eyes had seemed like endless pools of deep blue, but up close Dean could see small flecks of gold and silver that only magnified the sharpness of his gaze. Dean swallowed hard around the cotton towel that had suddenly replaced his tongue.
Besides emoticons, Castiel liked sending Dean pictures of whatever caught his eye during the day.  Each picture message would be signaled by the wailing voice of Celine, and each time he got a picture message Dean swore he would change his ringtone, but he never seemed to get around to changing it.
Cas rolled his eyes playfully but took the items from Dean’s hand, their fingers brushing as he did so.
The woman finally looks over at Dean, as if noticing him for the first time since she came over. That’s unusual in itself, because Dean is good looking, and he knows it. He gets hit on by women all the time. And this one just walked right by him. Maybe that’s why she ruffled his feathers. Maybe with Cas getting all of the attention he was feeling jealous. What else could it be?
“A lightning storm? That’s it? So we’d better watch out the next time it rains, or we’ll be surrounded by all our cousins?”
After a moment, Dean speaks up, emotions making his voice even gruffer than normal. “You know, mom always said angels were watching out for me. I guess she was right.”
“No offense taken,” the young doctor smiled again, “Dr. Smith had to attend to an emergency across town, so I’m filling in for him.”
Sam stretches his long arms over his head, pointedly ignoring his brother and father. “There has got to be something we’re missing. Some clue we didn’t see.”
Dean knows it’s a rhetorical question, but he still can’t miss the look on Sam’s face, a mixture of sympathy and encouragement for Dean to find the answer. Damn it, his brother can be a real pain in the ass sometimes with all of his emotional, girly crap. Yet, Dean knows that Sam is right. He nods at his brother, and sets down his unfinished shot.
“Are you telling me I actually get to meet Castiel?!” Charlie shrieks in delight, “I hope he’s just as dreamy as the books described him.”
This fic is sorta canon - but not really. There's the bunker, and Cas has his wings but is driving instead of flying. It's like pieces of s8 and s9, without the angst.
Dean knew this question would come up eventually, but he wasn’t expecting it to happen like this. He had left the warding off for a specific reason.
Then a finger from his other hand was circling Dean’s rim. Dean could feel the lube, cool but not cold. He didn’t mention it during the question and answer portion of the exam, but in his sexual history it had never been his role to bottom for anyone. The guys he had been with had always been so eager for him to top, to take control. So he’d never been on the receiving end of having anyone – you know – penetrate him. He knew he was clenching in anticipation of what was to come. Of course, Castiel noticed.
That means this isn’t a simple case of how John Winchester was brought back to Earth. It has suddenly gotten so much worse. If someone is poking around the cage, there is a chance they could Lucifer free too. Dean can tell by the panicked look on Sam’s face that he is thinking the same thing.
Castiel was becoming more sarcastic with his texts, and Dean enjoyed it.  He had to smile as he texted back:
There was a sharp knock on the door that shook Dean out of his thoughts. In walked a man who was not his ordinary doctor. Instead, this doctor was about Dean’s age, with an athletic build and slightly tanned skin. He also had some of the craziest bed head that Dean had ever seen, but instead of looking sloppy, it looked purposefully done. Dean wondered if it would feel soft or stiff if he were to run his fingers through it. Dean caught himself staring, but luckily the doctor was engrossed in his chart, so he didn’t notice.
“Damn it Sam, do we really have to talk about our feelings now? Don’t we have more important things to do? Like slamming the gates of Hell shut?”
Except for the body lying in the front of that quiet house – a body that wasn’t there before. The body of a man who used to live in that very house, before a demon and a fire took everything from him.
Dean knew he liked women. But he had always been a little curious about men, although he had never tried anything. And dreams about Doctor Sexy or Harrison Ford (or okay a couple times Cas - but he wasn’t telling anyone that) didn’t count. Looking at all the evidence now, it did make sense how Sam would see him as bisexual.
Dean never thought he would have a boyfriend - certainly not his first one in his forties nor one who is an angel. But being with Cas makes him happy, and if he’s learned anything over the years it’s to accept every moment of happiness that life gives you.
The thoughts in Dean's head buzz around, which makes him feel dizzy. But of course he doesn't say any of it out loud. It sounds ridiculous, even for them. There is so much to explain he doesn’t even know where to begin.
There are some advantages to growing up with working knowledge of all things supernatural. For instance, Sam knows how to actually kill a vampire, and he knows it does not involve garlic or a cross like some Hollywood movies would have you believe. Actually, it has become difficult for either him or his brother to watch horror movies, because of how much they get wrong. Sam should have given more advice to those movie producers in Los Angeles.
Dean reels backwards, as if John had physically hit him. His brain draws a blank on how to even respond – indignance, anger, defiance – they all loop through his head, but none of them seem suitable. No, what Dean needs is less talking and more action. Right now, he needs to forget the past twenty-four hours.
I have written a second chapter, and an outline for a third, if people want them. This chapter is just a drabble, and based on the comments I get I will decide if I am going to continue posting or not. Thanks!
Dean’s whole body is vibrating with anger. He knows he should calm down, but he can’t. It’s just too much to deal with on top of everything else that’s happened. How many times is it going to take to convince Cas that he’s important and that Dean needs him around? Hasn’t Dean already proved how much he could forgive Castiel for? Didn’t Dean make it clear that all the bad shit between them is in the past?
Dean and Castiel don’t say anything as they turn to head to the library, leaving John and Sam behind.
angel.” Nope. His brain had chosen to go with M-Y. Capital letters. Castiel: an Angel of the Lord, belonging to one Dean Winchester.
Dean feels Cas tense up beside him, and for a moment he thinks he made a horrible mistake. This is confirmed when he looks over to see Cas crying. He’d made a former angel cry. That’s messed up even for a Winchester, Dean thinks to himself. He opens his mouth to apologize, but is stopped short when Cas speaks.
“Well, you know I’ve dated girls before, but have you also noticed the times I’ve flirted with the men on our cases?”
Castiel’s facial expressions aren’t the most obvious in the world, but they are noticeable to Dean. The angel immediately goes stiff, and averts his gaze, unable to look Dean in the eye. Dean feels his mask of false bravado crumbling around him.
“Okay, more explaining, less nerding out,” Dean says, hand twirling in the universal symbol for ‘wrap it up’.
“I’ll go let Kevin know we’re back,” Sam says, and disappears down the hallway in search of the prophet.
“It’s safe Cas,” Dean interrupts, “No one knows about it except for Sammy and me. No one will find us here.”
“You shouldn’t have come here alone dad. It isn’t safe for you until we figure out what brought you back.”
He sat up in bed and turned on the tableside lamps.  He picked up his phone and gave the camera a deadpan look.
Dean watched the soft lights dance across Castiel’s face, and felt his chest tighten. Maybe, like the Grinch, his heart was growing. Dean remembered the past few days spent with Cas, and wanted nothing more than to reach out and hold his hand. He swallowed past the dryness in his throat, and made up his mind to act. Dean moved to sit close by Cas. He stretched his arm over the back of the couch and waited, without saying a word, for Cas to respond. Several heartbeats later, Dean felt the warm press of Cas’ body against his own. Dean closed his arm around him in a firm embrace, and intertwined their hands together.
He was saved from Dean’s rebuttal by the waiter coming over to refill their coffee. But when he reached over to fill Dean’s mug Cas stopped him with a hand over the top.
Dean hummed in appreciation as he moved to make good on his promise. By the end of the evening, Castiel had thought of three new sexual positions to try for their fantasy.
Dean could feel the effect it was having on him, about a second before it actually happened.  His legs shifted underneath the covers, which brought the sheets rubbing against his erection.  Dean gasped in surprise, not realizing how turned on he was until that moment.  Sam snorted in his sleep and turned over.  Dean swore under his breath and slunk into the bathroom to pull himself together.
“That’s my name, don’t wear it out,” Dean quipped. Real smooth, Winchester, he thought to himself as he flinched internally.
Sam was distraught to learn he had been unconscious when their father had died. Dean worried that the emotional strain might be too much on his younger brother, but he had pulled himself together as Dean had done. They gave their father a hunter’s funeral, fittingly in the same place where two of his sons had been lost all those years ago. As Dean watched the pile of ashes burn down to cinders he thought he would be happy if he never returned to that cemetery as long as he lived.
Dean can see Cas smiling out of the corner of his eye and it makes him so happy to know he’s the reason Cas feels the joy he deserves.
Castiel kneels to check on Sam, lying a palm on his forehead. Content that his brother is going to be okay, Dean crawls over to John. He’s still breathing too, eyelids fluttering as he tries to stay awake. Dean checks his pulse, and finds it weak and irregular.
“Now Dean? It’s so late. I just want to go to bed,” Sam said, shifting his duffle bag on his shoulder.
The last time he had tried to have a Christmas celebration, Dean thought it was going to be his last one ever. Dean and Sam hadn’t had a home then, so they hadn’t been able to do it right. There had been gifts wrapped in newspaper, and eggnog with lots of spice, huddled together in front of that small motel tv. But it wasn’t like the Christmas Dean had imagined it would be. Not like the ones they had never had as kids, that he knew they deserved.
Dean’s head pounds as he remembers the bathroom, and the feeling of wanting to see Cas naked. And that night in the bar, when he practically chased that woman away to have Cas all to himself. And those are only the most recent memories. There are hundreds of other moments over the years – long stares, stolen looks, and words unspoken.
Dr. Novak looked at Dean and his eyes darkened marginally. It might have been a trick of the light, but Dean didn’t think so, not when the doctor’s next comment was “Lucky them,” muttered under his breath. Dean pretended he hadn’t heard, but felt his heart rate increase again at the thought.
Dean wakes to the sound of giggling, accompanied by a soft clicking noise. Eyebrows wrinkled in confusion, he forcibly squints one eye open to see Charlie standing at the foot of his bed, camera phone in hand. Charlie is grinning, like she just won the lottery, and she doesn’t stop taking pictures. Wondering what she could possibly be so happy about, Dean looks down to see an arm wrapped around his waist and he realizes he is currently being spooned by an Angel of the Lord – and Dean is the little spoon.
Castiel moved his hand to Dean’s other knee to check the reflexes there. His warm fingers flexed on Dean’s inner thigh. Dean had to stop and count to three in his head, in order to not embarrass himself again.
Dean can’t help the soft chuckle that escapes his throat. He really wasn’t intending to make a move. Dean had planned on asking if Cas wanted to stay in the bunker on a more permanent basis. He decides Cas won’t believe him even if he tells the truth. He pats the angel’s shoulder and closes his eyes. He also makes a mental note to ask Cas in the morning where he learned that phrase.
As with last chapter, I am posting without a beta.  So let me know if you see any mistakes.  Or you know, if you’d like to be my beta.
Dean quickly swiped open his phone.  It was a picture of a piece of pie, sitting on a diner counter.  Cas had apparently learned how to use filters, because it looked grainy, like an old-time photo.  Cas had captioned it,
Thirty minutes later, Dean, Cas, Charlie and Kevin are watching a marathon of Batman movies in the Men of Letters study. Charlie had insisted that they commandeer a sofa she had seen in one of the bedrooms. She also wasn’t satisfied until Dean figured out how to make popcorn (the old-fashioned way – in a pan on the stove – since they don’t own a microwave). Charlie happily babbles about the merits of Christopher Nolan’s Batman, over that of Tim Burton’s, as she passes the popcorn to Castiel, who just stares at it.
“But you guys haven’t even heard the best part yet,” Sam says dryly, “That particular phrase is credited to the spirit called Agaou. He is the spirit in Loa culture most often thought of as the counterpart to the Archangel Michael.”
Dean slowly came back to reality, noting the quiet of his bedroom, with the addition of just a few new items. One of them being the white lab coat they had purchased from an online costume store. It had been Dean’s fantasy for this role-playing game, and he found that Cas was surprisingly eager to participate.
Dean finds Sam in the library, holding John’s journal. He looks sick, and more tired than Dean has ever seen him. Dean keeps thinking if they can just close the gates of Hell, then things will get better. Sam has always said he wants to stop hunting, and maybe he should be. He’s always been trying to get away – to Stanford, to law school, to a better life. Dean wants that for him. Even if he’s never been able to say that, he does want Sammy to have a normal life if he can.
“Maybe I had some assistance from the Loa to help cover my tracks. It doesn’t matter. I was still able to lure all of you here. The Winchesters are so predictable. You’ve been spending too much time with them Castiel.”
Dean Winchester handled the epiphany about Cas’ wings in the same way he handled most of his important emotional issues.
Dean turns to look at Cas, to explain what he meant, but is stopped by the expression on Cas’ face. It’s soft and open, slightly amused. It is a look Dean hasn’t seen since they were about to face down Dick Roman together. Dean opens his mouth to talk, but no words come out. He licks his lips, and clears his throat to try again. He can feel Castiel’s gaze on him, like a physical touch, the entire time. His toes tingle, and he realizes he might have been standing there for several minutes not saying anything, looking like an idiot. He opens his mouth to speak, praying for any words that will come out to make this situation less awkward. Castiel beats him to the punch.
“I know I am cutoff from Heaven, without some of my powers, but I would like to accompany you. In case it turns out to be a dangerous endeavor.”
He wasn’t actually upset at Cas, but there was something about wandering a store full of weird Swedish furniture and knick knacks that had made him cranky. Now they had to pick out their own box in a warehouse full of pallets and take it home to assemble it themselves.
Instead of a text message response, Dean’s phone rang with a call.  He picked up on the second ring.
While Dean is shopping, he gets the sense there’s something important he is missing. The window at Biggerson’s is advertising a Turkey Dinner Special for $8.99 and there are twinkling lights in most of the store windows. Then he sees an enormous evergreen tree, with a fluffy white angel on top.
They all turn to find a tall man in a long, dark coat giving them an unpleasant smile. Dean doesn’t recognize him, but he looks like could be a bouncer or body guard. The man is broad-shouldered and has one of those short, cropped haircuts. His features look like they have been carved out of stone, so that the smile he is wearing looks hard and distorted.
Dean was so happily buzzed that the question didn’t even phase him.  He smiled at the opportunity to teach Cas something about human behavior.  He happily let the instructions run through his head and out through his fingers.
“I know,” she interrupts, “Winchester doom and gloom. Yada yada yada. Got it. Now, I hate to interrupt the lovely couple but, Kevin and I made breakfast, and Sam hit a break on the case.”
“It’s not good,” Sam explains, “We think someone could be trying to raise Michael from the Pit. They could raise Lucifer too, whether they intend to or not. It would be Armageddon Part II.”
“Cas, you’re not going to go reaching into my father. Especially, when you’re not at the top of your game. It’s not safe,” Dean snaps.
“Right,” Sam continues, “So instead of focusing on the symbol I did a search for that phrase that dad said; ‘It is I who am the gunner of God. When I roar, the Earth trembles’, and I got a match. It brought up this site about Voodoo spirits called Loa.”
I think Dean’s subconscious might have been trying to tell him something with that stripper, what do you think?
“Nice try, human. But only an archangel blade can kill an archangel. Maybe once Michael resurrects you, you’ll have learned some respect for the angels in charge around here.”
Dean sat with his phone is his hand for several minutes with no reply.  He took another big glup of scotch and waited.  He didn’t even feel the alcohol catching up to him.  He thought he should lay his head down and wait for the next text message.  A minute later he was passed out against the arm of the couch.  He didn’t even hear his phone vibrate.
After returning from Heaven, Castiel had healed Sam as best he could. There was still long-term damage from the trials, that they all knew wouldn’t be cleared until Sam completed the tasks. But, he was slightly improved from when they had gone to Colorado, and that was all Dean could ask for.
At that last, Cas relaxes and leans into Dean’s touch ever so slightly. Dean cannot help the contented sigh that escapes his lips, and before he can change his mind, he’s pushing the trench coat off Cas’ shoulders. Castiel doesn’t protest, but he doesn’t exactly help either. Dean takes it as a sign to continue, and Cas’ suit jacket soon follows. He lays out both jackets on a nearby chair, and kneels to remove Cas’s shoes and socks. When Dean gets to Cas’ ever-messy tie, he notices Cas’ adam’s apple bob beneath his fingers. Dean’s heart starts to beat double-time, as whiskey and adrenaline rush through his system. He pulls the blue silk through the collar and undoes the top button on Cas’ shirt.
“So some random nut job did some heavy duty Voodoo worshipping and brought our dad back to life?” Dean asks.
They didn’t speak because they didn’t need to. A lifetime of words, spoken through the years of stolen moments and intense stares, had already said more than they could at this moment. This angel turned man – this supernatural, ethereal being – had come back no matter how many times Dean had pushed him away. Anything Dean might say would be lacking in weight, or might spoil the moment. Sometimes the best way to communicate is without words.
Concerned about the prophet, Dean and Sam decide to take Kevin back with them to Kansas. Along the road, they find Castiel injured and in need of help. They load him into the Impala and head back to their base.
The thought of Cas being sick or hurt, makes Dean’s stomach clench. He already wants to beat Crowley for what he did to Cas. He can almost feel what it would be like to have his knuckles connect with that smarmy bastard’s face, and the joy he would get from beating the demon. Outside of the fantasy, Dean uses his hands for comfort instead of violence, by stroking Castiel’s cheek. The angel starts to stir.
Such a simple thing - to hold someone’s hand - but a small pleasure that Dean has denied himself for years. He hopes he gets to keep it this time.
Dean squeezes into Charlie’s small car, next to Sam. Castiel takes a seat in the back, without further comment. Dean, too tired to argue anyway, guides the car onto the highway to track down their father.
The only person who seems content to wallow is Cas. Something about the holiday must have reminded him of Heaven, because his depression seems to have gotten worse. He leaves his room only once a day to eat, and that’s it. Dean knows how it feels, to lose what you love the most, but he also knows the way Cas is acting won’t help him feel better. Dean makes up his mind to intervene, no matter the consequences. He doesn’t have a specific plan in mind, other than showing Cas a change of scenery. He practically drags Cas to the front door and hands him a heavy winter coat.
“This stuff isn’t even good quality, Cas,” Dean argued, trying to get the frustrated tone out of his voice.
He gave Dean a flick of an eyebrow. Just as Dean was going to ask if the doctor was actually coming onto him, the fingers inside of him found his prostate. Or, at least that’s what Dean imagined they found. Either that, or Castiel had found a magic button, that made Dean feel like he’d just taken a drop down a roller-coaster, that sent a tingling sensation through his balls.
He could imagine Cas muttering to his phone before taking the picture.  Or huffing to himself when it wasn’t just right, and he had to take another shot.  Dean imagined that Castiel was a perfectionist when it came to taking cell phone pictures, so Dean could see him taking multiple angles before deciding which one to send to Dean.  The thought of Cas capturing those pictures, and debating with himself on which one to send made Dean smile.
Dean rubs a hand down his face and lets out a long exhale. “I know. It’s just… it’s a lot to take in right now. Sorry,” he mumbles, “The last time one of us came back from the dead, we weren’t exactly in one piece.”
Dean picked up his phone off the bedside table, ready to text him and apologize.  It immediately felt awkward.  It had been too long for Dean to be casual with him, but nothing he could text in a few characters would be enough to say all the things he needed to apologize.
“He’s right, Dean,” says John, “He tested me with salt, holy water, silver, and Borax for some reason.”
Dean hadn’t been happy about letting Sam leave the bunker, but he insisted on being helpful. Sam didn’t like feeling run down and useless. Dean had let him go alone, while he stayed behind to keep an eye on their other guests. Dean leads Charlie into the main library to find Kevin and Castiel playing a game of chess.
Dean gestured and watched Cas’ expression as he turned to look at the carvings of his and Jack’s names next to the other Wincesters. There was a look of joy and wonder in those blue eyes that made Dean’s heart soar.
“Dean would prefer it if I were current on popular culture, but obviously there are many more important things that have taken up my time,” Castiel explains, as if it should be apparent to the humans in the room that global wars between Heaven and Hell take precedence over action movies and comic books.
The rest of the weekend is spent showing Cas all the traditions of being human at Christmas. Sam and Dean teach him how to make popcorn and cranberry garlands for the tree. They make Cas try warm apple cider, cocoa, and hot buttered rum drinks throughout the day. He declares the hot chocolate is his favorite, especially when Dean adds whipped cream to it.
“No problem, Charlie. And don’t worry about being the third wheel. We are also currently housing a prophet and an Angel of the Lord.”
“Found an angel blade… melted it into bullets,” Cas rasps to Dean, flinching when Dean presses on his stomach.
In fact, Castiel has looked more worn out than ever these days, Dean realizes. Ever since the Leviathan fiasco, Castiel’s all-powerful smiting look has been missing from his eyes. The look had been gone when he was Emmanuel, then a patient in the hospital, and in Purgatory. Even when he was angeled up again, he hadn’t been the same. Dean knew there was something off the night they found Alfie and Cas ran away with the angel tablet. Dean now knows hiding the tablet had something to do with Naomi, but Castiel hasn’t gone into detail about her. Dean will have to ask Cas about that soon.
Next, Dean goes to check on Castiel. He is also lying fully clothed on his bed, but his breathing is erratic and he is gripping his stomach in pain. Dean lifts up his shirt, to bandage the wound. Castiel may be an angel, but Dean is going to treat him like he is human. He doesn’t know any other way.
“I understand your father has hang-ups with supernatural beings. Still, I would like to accompany you to Lawrence tomorrow,” Castiel says, “I will endeavor not to be a distraction during this hunt.” The last is said with a small smirk, that Dean’s stress-addled brain tries desperately to translate. Before he can get his mind on-track, to ask what the hell Castiel meant, the angel is out the door to his own room.
“So what’s up Cas? Your cousins are out causing trouble, because of all the mix-up in Heaven right now?” Dean asks. “Does that sound right?”
When you have a younger brother, sometimes they do annoying things simply because they can.  That means sometimes they forget to bring you pie, and then claim they know nothing about why you are upset.  Or, they might superglue your fingers to a beer bottle.  And it could just be that your sibling thinks it is hilarious to steal your phone when you’re not looking, to change your text alert noises.  In this case, it was the latter.  And Sammy was sneakier than most.  He didn’t just change Dean’s text alert ringtone, because then Dean would have noticed right away.  No, Sam only changed the notification for when someone sent Dean a picture message, which would take longer to happen but meant that the payoff would be greater.  Sam set the phone to loudly blast “Because You Loved Me” when someone sent Dean a picture.
It wasn’t that Dean didn’t want to be helpful, but it was already past seven o’clock at night and he knew Librarian Sammy would be only too happy to pull an all-nighter to organize the stacks.  Dean had other plans for the evening - including a marathon of Star Trek movies and a bottle of twenty-five year old scotch that the Men of Letters had left behind.
She smiled up at Dean, blinking at him through her thick glasses. He opened his mouth to correct her but what came out instead was -
Dean tried not to snap at Sam, but he was feeling anxious.  He didn’t even have any good texts from Cas to pass the time.  On their second day in Texas, he had texted telling Cas where they were in case he went to the bunker looking for them.  There had been no response.
Dean sat perfectly still, hoping his heart was not beating too fast to give away his nerves at being so close to the gorgeous, young doctor.
“Cas is fine,” Dean barks out. He doesn’t care that he sounds tense. Maybe if Sammy picks up that he’s in a bad mood he’ll let the whole thing drop.
Charlie returns John’s smile, but it is more forced. “Oh, Kevin and I are just friends. Strictly platonic. Actually, I’m a lesbian. And I’m waiting for a call back from a fairy I want to hook up with.”
But Sam had gotten to take a nap in the Impala, while Dean drove and chewed over his thoughts for the past eighty miles. He needed to say something now before he talked himself out of it.
It hadn’t been difficult to figure out where John was headed. He was the man who taught them to hunt, after all. Dean pulls up to the two-story house in Lawrence that once belonged to John and Mary Winchester. The Impala is parked out front, and John stands on the porch, shoulders hunched downward.
“Of all the stupid things you have done lately Sam – this one takes the cake. You could have been killed!”
“Put out your arms like this,” Dean says, stretching out his arms at his side. Cas hesitates, but complies.
Dean doesn’t comment, only smiles slightly as he helps Cas out of the dress shirt, leaving him in the t-shirt underneath. Then Dean steps back from the bed, removing his own shoes and socks to make his point about them both being comfortable. He undoes his jeans and lets them fall to the floor, Cas watching his movements all the while.
It was easy for Dean to absolve himself of some of the guilt over ignoring Cas.  They were on a hunt and he was busy.  Lives were hanging in the balance and that meant he didn’t have to answer Cas right away.  Right?
Well, this year is different. They have the bunker now, and things are as stable as they are going to get for a Winchester. This year Dean decides they are going to have a real Christmas. It can help take everyone’s mind off of what is going on.
With the free hand not currently trapped under a seraph, Dean brings it up to lie on Cas’ forehead, checking his temperature. He feels warm to the touch, but then Dean realizes he has no baseline for how angels are supposed to feel. All of that power inside a vessel probably burns quite hot. Like being chained to a comet, Jimmy had said. Then again, Lucifer had commented that he burned cold, but maybe that was just him and not all angels.
“Yeah, well, dad doesn’t like anything that distracts me from hunting. He always wanted me to be focused on finding the demon that killed our mom. He didn’t even like it when I tried to have a girlfriend. Must be driving him crazy that I’m getting distracted by an angel now --” Dean stops dead, realizing what he just said.
Dean inherently knows that Castiel can protect himself. Even at half-power he could probably smite a demon, no problem. Still, Dean thinks of the Colt lying under his pillow, how it could kill Crowley in one shot, and he feels a surge of protectiveness pulse through him.
Sam went to bed, happy that now his work was done. And he didn’t even gloat or grumble when he caught Dean and Castiel kissing under the mistletoe the next morning.
That question threw Dean for a loop. Surely that was a come on. How was he supposed to respond to that?
“Oh, yeah. Right. Of course,” Dean fumbled. “Nope, no allergies there either. Believe me, I would know, with all the condoms I use.”
“It’s sweet to have someone who cares about you. You remind me of my parents,” said the waiter, as he turned to go collect Dean’s new drink.
Halfway into the third movie, Cas’ head slumps onto Dean’s shoulder. Dean looks over to notice that Charlie and Kevin have also fallen asleep, leaning up against each other. Dean squashes down his big brother urge to cover them both with a blanket. Besides, that would mean standing and disturbing the angel currently using him as a body pillow.
Because if he does not do something about his brother moping around every time Castiel’s name is mentioned, Sam is going to have to shave his head, change his identity, and move to Canada.
He starts with something simple: Breakfast. Because who can say no to pancakes and bacon? Everybody loves bacon. Dean is grateful once again for their well-stocked kitchen, as he mixes the pale batter and fries strips of bacon, filling the room with a delicious aroma. Dean is proud of himself for how good he is at all of this domestic stuff. He likes to brag about it to Sammy whenever he gets the chance. Cooking for Cas feels as natural as taking care of Sam. Cas is part of their family too, and having him in the bunker feels right somehow.
Dean should have been surprised – he really should have – to find Castiel in his bed. But, whether it was the stress of the day, or the whiskey in his system, he couldn’t find it in him to be bothered. No, the emotions rolling around in his stomach are something else. Namely confusion as to why Castiel is still wearing all of his clothes, before he remembers he hasn’t taught the angel about pajamas yet.
Dean could only focus on the stubble on Cas’s cheek, and the set of his jaw.  He kept staring at the muscled slope of Cas’ bare shoulder – so much exposed skin.  That, in itself, was enough to get Dean’s attention.  And of course the sleek black feathers that rose up behind Castiel were highly suggestive in their own right.  The power they symbolized.  The fact that it was Castiel’s most private body part, and he had sent a photo of it to Dean, sent a tingle down his spine.
“So, check this out,” Sam says, as he scrolls through a website. “I wasn’t having much luck identifying the symbol. We really need to work on a better reference library for those by the way, preferably digital –“
Dean nods, unable to say more. Thinking about John again so soon is more than a little painful and raw. Dean latches onto a new topic, desperate to focus on the good news.
Dean knows he could stop now, go down the hall, and take another bedroom. That’s what his brain is thinking anyway, but his body has other ideas. He climbs into bed next to Cas, trying to will his heartbeat to slow down. He looks over to Cas, to ask if he’s still okay with this idea, but sees the angel shivering under the blankets. Without a second thought, Dean gathers Cas into his arms, pressing the dark-haired head against his chest, and rubbing his hand across Cas’ back to generate some heat.
That makes John quirk an eyebrow. “You know, telling me that your angel was best buds with the King of Hell, isn’t exactly the way to get me to like him.”
“Yeah, we have a case in North Texas.  Garth called.  Said something has been taking little kids, and he can’t get there until next week.  We have to go now.”
Besides an extensive knowledge of how to kill monsters, Sam also knows that magic actually exists. And not the David Copperfield sort of magic. Magic that can conjure, control, or kill. But not all witches have to be evil. He thinks of Patrick and his wife, who actually were not all bad. And of course, Sam does not intend to use magic for evil. He knows there are some simple spells that will not require anything like payment of his soul.
And just like that Dean was kissing Castiel. Sam had to clamp a hand over his mouth to hide his surprise. He quickly snuck down to his room before he could be caught peeking. He wanted to fist pump the air. Or go and share the news with Charlie and Kevin.
When Dean’s phone went off at midnight with the now familiar Celine Dion ringtone, Dean had never been so happy to hear that stupid song.
“He damaged my grace. Takes longer to repair myself now,” Cas huffs out, his breath warming Dean’s neck.
the best, but only the Muppet version oddly enough. Kevin declared they were all uncultured, and that the only good Christmas movie was
Dr. Novak chuckled. “Yes, my parents were definitely unique individuals. Now, let’s check your reflexes.”
“I mean,” Dean continues, swallowing around a lump in his throat, “that if you’re sick, or injured, you should stay here. So I can keep an eye on you – like you did for me in Purgatory.”
“Well, we can figure all that out later. Lucky for us, we have a place to hide while we get you healed up. Welcome to the Batcave, Cas.”
All through dinner, Sam tried to think of a way to get Dean and Castiel to stand underneath the mistletoe at the same time. In the end, it turned out to be Charlie, asking the three of them to stand together for a picture. Sam pulled his brother to the doorway, and gestured for Castiel to stand with them. Charlie took her pictures and Sam moved away as quickly as he could, without being obvious. He slid over to stand by Charlie, pretending to peer over at Charlie’s phone, but keeping an eye on his brother and Cas.
Sam had thought that even Dean, with all of his problems telling people how he feels, would eventually come to his senses and confess his love to Castiel. But he hadn’t. Dean had not told Castiel how he felt when Castiel rebelled against Heaven, or when he saved Sam and ended up in the hospital, or even when Dean and Castiel were trapped in Purgatory together. Sam knew Dean had said nothing, by the way he told the stories. Dean always had a hint of disappointment in his eyes, as if he had known he had left Castiel in that place, not saying something important to him. Then when Castiel was brought back from Purgatory, Sam thought for certain Dean would be so happy to see Castiel get out that it would break his long silence. Even that had not been enough.
Dean didn’t respond to Castiel’s picture message, which he felt bad about, since he usually replied as soon as he got the texts.  Dean had no idea what to say that wouldn’t make things awkward.  There were few things that he could say to Cas that would do the picture justice.  Castiel’s wings were such a mysterious part of the angel.  He had known Castiel for years and Dean had almost started to think of him as human.  The picture was proof that Castiel was not human, and on top of that, Dean felt his face heat up everytime he thought about staring at that picture of Cas while he was aroused.  It was all so confusing.
“There’s so many things I didn’t get to tell him – we didn’t get to tell him,” Sam says, interrupting his thoughts, “He still never found out about Henry. Or how we got this bunker.”
Dean was aware of Sam silently laughing at him out of the corner of his eye as he tried to stare down an angel over his choice of beverage. But Cas wasn’t blinking, and Dean didn’t feel like arguing.
“I’m not good enough for him Sammy. Never was. I was only useful because I could watch out for you. That’s why he kept me around.”
John looks at his eldest son, and smiles slightly. Then his eyes scan the rest of the room, the other occupants on the couch, and finally on the sight of another man curled up asleep on his son’s shoulder. He doesn’t say anything, but Dean can see the emotions flit across his father’s face – confusion, awareness, and then disappointment. Dean’s instincts to impress his father, to be a good son and to obey, flare up inside of him after being dormant for so long. He actually feels embarrassment at being found like this, and struggles for words to explain what his father is seeing.
Dean enlarged the picture to squint at the feathers.  The quality was a bit fuzzy, being a cell phone image, but there was no mistaking what it was.  Castiel was framed by large black feathers, extending from behind his shoulders.  Some of the feathers seemed to almost have a bluish hue, but Dean wasn’t sure if that was the feathers or the picture quality.  Dean held onto his phone for so long, staring at the enlarged picture, that he didn’t notice the string of texts that had followed it.
“Okay, Cas. Get to healing him too. C’mon, we’ll all get healed up, and go back to the bunker. Beers are on me.”
Sam does not have what you would call a natural warlock ability. Sam knows there are magical skills he could learn, but he has never needed to before now. He would have to study, and learn, and practice to do even a basic spell. Not really worth it when it comes to ganking werewolves or conducting research. So Sam had never bothered to learn magic before. Then again, nothing in the past has given him reason to, until now.
The next move was even more surprising.  As she lowered herself onto the floor, in a controlled move, she reached up to run a hand through her hair, and pulled off what must have been a wig.  The hair underneath looked even darker than before, but that might have been the shortness of the pixie cut.  The hair looked textured and spiky, and Dean’s fingers itched to run through the strands and see if it would be stiff or fluffy.  The dancer rolled onto her stomach pulling herself into an arching cobra pose right in front of Dean.
Dinner was great. It felt like a normal party, with Jody wearing a festive sweater, and Charlie bringing alone mulled wine for the meal. Dean’s food was excellent and everyone was making happy conversation, straying away from talking about all of the weirdness in their lives. Jody and Garth actually got along really well, both being straightforward people. Kevin was mostly quiet, but it was sweet to see Charlie try to ease him out of his shell, keeping up a steady chatter about movies and video games. Castiel didn’t need to eat, but he sat across the table from Dean watching him as he ate. And he even tried a bite of the pecan pie, once he had learned that Dean made it from scratch.
“I’m sure there’s no reason to keep you around. I’ll tell Michael you said hello when he arrives to possess your father.”
Turns out, Cas isn’t in bad shape. His chest is naturally smooth, and his muscles are well defined. Dean finds his gaze wandering lower and lower without his permission. He wants to make a wiseass remark about whether or not angels are junkless, but the joke sticks in his throat. The situation isn’t funny. Standing alone in the bathroom with Cas, with one of them almost naked, the air is charged with something else besides humor. Dean can feel his heartbeat speed up, and he licks his lips to wet them, chewing on his bottom lip. They are standing on the edge of something, and Dean feels like he’s about to tip over into the abyss. Then he sees Cas fidgeting under his stare, and it hits him. He is not ready for this. Dean mumbles something indecipherable under his breath, and flees the bathroom.
“You’re wrong, dad. You’re the one who didn’t give us a chance at a normal life. You threw it all away to turn your kids into mercenaries and drag them around the country!” Dean snaps, surprising not only himself, but everyone else with the ferocity of his response. “And just for the record dad, Cas has been there for us more in the past four years than you ever were for us the whole time we were growing up.”
“Dean, please,” Cas whines, “I don’t see how this is going to help me feel any better. It’s cold and I want to go back inside.”
“Have you ever achieved orgasm through prostate stimulation?” Dr. Novak asked, but his voice was low and whispered into Dean’s ear.
“I’ll go dig up the Men of Letters files about healing demons,” Dean says, in a final tone that lets Sam know their discussion is over. Sam nods at him and sets his jaw, as he goes back to his books.
Castiel walks over and plucks Dean’s coffee mug out of his hands. Before Dean can protest, Cas is inhaling the steam, humming softly as he takes a drink. Dean quirks an eyebrow over to Sam and Kevin, to see if they’ve noticed. They are both staring at the angel as well, with slightly shocked looks on their faces. Cas must sense all the eyes on him and looks up.
Dean comes dangerously close to having cider come out his nose when Cas tells them the real version of the first Christmas. It seemed that there had been a mix-up, and the Wise Men had gone to the wrong manger at first. In retrospect, it could have been much worse given that someone had thought it was a good idea to put Gabriel in charge as Herald.
Suddenly Dean isn’t so sure anymore. There is all this grey area where it only used to be black and white. Sure, Cas has been there for him, and Sammy, when it really mattered. Gotten them out of so many tight spots. Cas is family. Dean knows he feels better having him in the bunker, where he can look out for the guy. But that’s where it stops.
Dean looks over to Cas. His cheeks are flushed pink and he seems happy. In just a few moments though, the smile slips off Cas’ face, and he frowns instead.
Cas doesn’t complain again after that. Dean continues for a few more moments, leading Cas in their slow-motion, horizontal jumping jacks. Eventually, Dean stills his movements, and carefully climbs to his feet, so as not to disturb his work. He walks over to Cas, and helps the other man up, so he can see what they’ve done.
“Your pulse is a little elevated, but not anything to be concerned about. I can tell you are a bit nervous Mr. Winchester, so we’ll get this next part done as smoothly as we can, okay?”
“Shit, I can’t even have Castiel as a friend, without it causing a fight,” Dean remarks. He turns to see Sam giving him one of the saddest puppy dog looks ever. Yeah, he is definitely not drunk enough to deal with Sam when he’s like this.
“I don’t know if that’s such a good idea, man. My dad’s not exactly the poster child for getting along with supernatural beings,” Dean explains. He imagines what a tense car ride it would be with the four of them, and shudders internally.
“I’m not gonna argue with that,” Cas said, sounding relieved and gave Dean a smile as he walked to the front door.
As Dean lifted the edge of the gown, Dr. Novak rolled closer to the exam table. He snapped on a pair of latex gloves before taking Dean’s penis in hand. He moved it gently back and forth, examining the surface for any odd marks. Dean stared at the ceiling and tried to think of dead puppies. He quickly lost concentration when he felt a hand cradling his balls. Dean swallowed and looked down to find the doctor staring right at him.
They draw apart for air and Dean scoots towards the middle of the bench seat, bringing his arm behind Cas as they kiss again. This time Dean can slant their mouths together and tease Cas’ lips with his tongue. Cas’ mouth opens on a breathy sigh, and his hand comes to cup Dean’s jaw as if to hold him in place.
Of course, that’s not shitty enough for Winchester luck. About two weeks after the failed attempt to convert Crowley, Castiel showed up at their door, battered and barely able to stand. Dean had just been able to ask, “Where the hell have you been?” before Castiel fainted on the threshold. Then Dean had a damaged angel on his hands, on top of caring for a sick brother.
So, to save his sanity and his brother’s love life, Sam knew he had to be the one to make something happen.
Dean knew that would be his father’s answer, but it still hurts. Tears sting the corners of his eyes. His father has been a pain in the ass the past few days, but that doesn’t mean he is ready to lose him again so soon. He looks at his father lying in the dirt, breathing in his last breaths, almost gone from him again. He decides he can be the man his father raised him to be one last time. Dean swallows down his emotions, like a physical lump in his throat.
The Impala’s tank is about empty, so Dean stops for fuel. There is a strip mall nearby, and Dean decides to turn his little outing into a supply run. At least that way it won’t seem like he’s such a bitch for running away to pout. And it might help take his mind off things.
Being human is harder on Cas this time around. He may have been thousands of years old before he fell, but that doesn’t mean he has any real experience dealing with human emotions. Or human needs. Dean has to tell him to take a shower, after noticing he smells like feet. He is able to peel the old, worn suit off of him without much hassle. Dean tries not to stare at Cas, but after five years of nothing but suits and that long trench coat, he is a bit curious as to what Cas has been covering up.
“Look Dean, I know this is a shock, but it is dad, okay?,” Sam continues, “He knew our birthdays, all the schools we went to, and even the combination on the weapons locker of the Impala. I don’t know how he’s here, or why, but it is him.”
Cas tilts his head in that way of his, conveying his confusion at Dean’s meaning. Dean’s heart is beating fast and he doesn’t know if he has the capacity for many more words. Feeling bold, hoping he’s not making a mistake, Dean takes Cas’ hand in his own.
The other man complies, and Dean can tell his head is still swirling with negative thoughts. Dean has known Cas long enough to see that a full-blown sulk is coming, unless he can do something about it. A flicker of an idea runs into Dean’s mind, and he latches onto it, like a drowning man onto a life raft.
“I guess you do run hot then?” Dean asks, as Castiel continues to shiver in his arms. “God, what did that bastard Crowley do to you?”
“Now, I’ve tried to warm up the gel, but this may still feel a bit cool and slippery,” the doctor said.
Dean swallowed hard, and slowly began to raise the edge of the paper gown. Dean had been naked in front of other men before, but it had been awhile since he had been around one he found so attractive. His dick was already slightly fuller than normal, as it had taken an interest in the proceedings. He only hoped he could control his arousal just enough to get through the rest of the exam.
Cas came out of the changing room, wearing a Winchester tuxedo consisting of a flannel shirt, plain t-shirt, and jeans. It was a pretty basic outfit but it had been years since Dean had seen Cas in anything but his oversized suit and trench coat so he couldn’t help but stare a little. There was something in particular about the jeans that Dean was having trouble tearing his eyes away from - maybe because they were so ordinarily human or because Dean could see how defined Cas’ thighs looked in them which made him wonder how much muscle he had been packing under loose fitting clothes all these years.
So close, in fact, that his crotch rubbed against Dean’s hip, and Dean could feel the effect he was having on the other man. He could feel Castiel’s cock where it pressed against him, hard and hot, and he wondered what it might feel like having it sliding in and out of him, instead of the man’s fingers. Dean wanted to try it face down on the table, spread open for the man next to him. He wanted to lie on his back, so he could watch Castiel’s face as he fucked him. He wanted to sit astride Castiel’s lap, and ride him until they both screamed.
Castiel sat on a low stool and wheeled over to sit in front of Dean’s legs. This put Castiel’s head practically in Dean’s lap, and he couldn’t help the thoughts that ran through his head with that position in mind. Dean was well on his way to imagining an excellent blow job fantasy, when Castiel set a warm hand on Dean’s knee. Dean felt a small shiver run through his body at the contact.
She twirls around, leaving the room without another word. Dean groans, but tries to look on the bright side; if someone was going to find them like this he’s glad it was Charlie.
“I understand. I raised you and Sammy to be hunters. You were around so many men, that eventually you were going to get curious. But I never thought this would be something you would want for yourself – to be with another man, and give up on the chance at a normal life.”
After a quick search of the bunker, it’s obvious John Winchester has flown the coop. To make matters worse, the bastard had taken the Impala. It doesn’t matter that the car had been his to begin with, John would have bought that ugly ass van if Dean hadn’t stopped him. Regardless of how Dean feels about his baby, they need to track down John as soon as possible. It is not safe for him to be out walking around, until they know who, or what, brought him back.
The shirt slipped down to the stage floor, leaving the dancer in iridescent blue booty shorts and a matching tube top.  She shimmied her shoulders in Dean’s direction, and he felt like he was the only one in the room.  The dancer winked, before turning to lift herself onto the pole.  It was a complicate routine, but she made it look effortless.  She twirled and swung around the pole, a display of dance and of strength.  Dean was caught staring at the defined muscles of her shoulders and her strong thighs that were able to hold her upside down by her legs alone.
“If you two don’t mind, we have some work to do,” John interjects, breaking up the staring contest happening between his eldest son and an angel.
“Thanks Sammy,” he says, with a clap on Sam’s back as he walks out of the kitchen, and down the hall to the bedrooms.
John slowly shakes his head. “You have to understand Dean, that’s not what I ever wanted for you. It’s not what your mother would have wanted either. I’m sorry.”
Dean could only offer a shaky nod, not trusting his voice. Dr. Novak’s finger slipped out, so he could add more lube to two fingers, and Dean felt a sense of emptiness he had not been expecting. He couldn’t wonder at it for long, before two fingers were being inserted back inside of him.
“Important enough to leave your brother behind and run off into danger,” Dean growls under his breath.
Cas looks to Dean, expression full of helplessness. Dean wouldn’t know what to say even if he could speak. If they could keep Azrael talking longer, they might be able to distract him or find a weak spot. Castiel has his angel blade, but since he is still not fully healed, it’s hard to say if he would win in a one-on-one fight with another angel.
Dean really should have considered his own angel in the equation. While Azrael focuses on Dean, Castiel removes the archangel blade from John and advances on Azrael. Before he can even turn around, Castiel drives the blade into his chest, and the white light of Azrael’s grace spills out of his vessel. He falls to the ground at Castiel’s feet.
Sometimes, if he was having a rough day, Dean would scroll back through all of the pictures Castiel had sent him over the weeks.  He caught himself staring at his phone with a sappy smile on his face more often than not.
He blinked, looking around the room.  The bottle of scotch was nearly empty.  The television was still on, but the DVD player must have automatically shut itself off, leaving a blaring blue screen.  Dean was cold from sleeping without a blanket in the drafty underground bunker.  And he had passed out at an odd angle, leaving a crick in his neck.  Perfect way to start the day.
“Crowley…” Cas breaks off to wheeze a few times. “Created…new…weapon.” It takes all of Castiel’s effort just to get those few words out.
What was that saying?  A picture is worth a thousand words.  Dean had never sent Castiel a picture message, he realized.  He could start now, to break the ice.
Sam huddled against the cold and was grateful to enter the warmth of the coffee shop. He stamped his feet against the cold, blowing on his hands. It had taken him a moment to register the twinkling lights in the window and the Christmas carols playing on the radio. The baristas were wearing Santa hats and elf ears. Sam startled slightly. How had Christmas snuck up on them so quickly?
Azrael sneers at him, his nostrils flare and his eyes flash dark. “No input is required from you. All I need is for Castiel to hand over the angel tablet, and for your father to agree to be Michael’s vessel on Earth. It was so easy to get this done in a two-for-one deal.”
Dean looked down at his and Sam’s initials carved into the table. He ran his thumb over the lines on the table. Looked like there was room for a couple more names on that oak. He pulled out his pocket knife and started carving while he kept thinking.
The next morning at breakfast, the mood is somber. Sam is practically falling asleep at the table. Kevin picks at his scrambled eggs, not doing much more than push them around his plate. Dean knows Kevin needs some time to deal with his issues, but at least he’s in the bunker now where he’ll be safe. Castiel wanders into the kitchen, looking slightly more alert than he had the night before. His crumpled trench coat tells Dean that the angel had tried to sleep in his clothes. If he’s going to stay here for long they might have to teach him about pajamas.
For a Winchester, coming back from the dead is kind of like returning home after a long vacation. Not that they ever take vacations, but the point still stands. Returning from the dead happens so often, Dean wonders if there will ever be a time when they actually stay dead. Still, it doesn’t explain why their father is back, or how it happened. It is hard to celebrate the family reunion until he can be sure everyone is safe. It is even harder to ignore the fact that Sammy had went behind his back and lied to him – again.
Beyond that, Dean isn’t sure how to handle the situation. If it was Sammy moping around, Dean would either give him a beer, or tell him to stop acting like a bitch, depending on the situation. Somehow, Dean has a feeling that won’t work in Cas’ case. In desperation, Dean finally asks Sam for his help.
“Well, this year is different,” Dean continues, as if Sam hadn’t popped his yuletide bubble. “This year we have a home. This year we can do it right.”
“I see,” said Dr. Novak, “Well, I have often heard compliments about my technique. So you’re in good hands.”
That earns him another bitchface from his brother. Dean returns the look without comment. After a moment, Sam’s face seems to relax, but Dean can tell he’s just getting ready to unleash a torrent of emotions on his brother.
“Hey Cas, thanks again for healing Sammy. And helping our dad. I know you would have saved them both if you could,” Dean says.
Dean looks back to the symbol in the door. He snaps a picture of it with his cell phone as Sam gets their father into Charlie’s car. They take off down the road as Dean and Cas jump into the Impala. They haul ass back to the bunker, hoping that nothing is following them.
Dean finally looks at his brother, and is surprised to see Sammy almost shaking with emotion. It’s been awhile since he’s seen his brother so worked up over anything. Dean doesn’t know if Sam expects him to respond, but he doesn’t know what he would say anyway. His brother has it all wrong. Cas is just his friend.
Cas nods but doesn’t say anything. He walks over to Dean’s desk, his fingertips lightly brushing the picture of Mary that Dean keeps there. Dean tenses, as he had when Castiel held John’s journal in his hands.
Dean squints in confusion at his father’s odd phrasing, but before he can reply there is a sharp crack of noise nearby, as the heavy hardwood door next to them splinters. A deep red symbol appears burned into the door. Dean’s hunter senses kick in, quickly scanning the area for threats, as he draws the demon knife out of his pocket. Nothing obvious jumps out at them. He looks over to Sam, who seems okay, but John is breathing heavily. He looks down at the sidewalk to where Castiel is looking around anxiously.
Dean is so caught up in his thoughts, he doesn’t even hear the angel quietly following him to his room. Only when he turns to shut the door, does he see the familiar figure in a trench coat standing in his doorway. It doesn’t even register to him that he’s not startled by Cas’ presence, until it strikes him as normal that Cas is standing in his bedroom, staring at him again.
“Okay, fine,” Charlie relents, “It’s just that we had the funeral for my mom last week, and I don’t know where to go. I was hoping I could come crash with you and Sam for a few days? I promise you won’t even know I’m there. I can organize your monster files, or help come up with a better security system…” Charlie rattles off nervously.
Dean could have sworn the last was said with a flirtatious tone, but it could just be that Dr. Novak was trying to ease Dean’s nervousness. He decided to go with the latter.
John stares down Azrael, he moves his hand behind his back, and makes a grabbing motion towards Castiel. Castiel places his angel blade in John’s hand, and John comes out swinging at Azrael. Azrael is actually surprised at the move and startles backwards. It breaks his concentration enough that Dean can feel oxygen moving into his lungs again. He looks over to see that Sam is breathing, but lying in the grass unconscious.
“Out of that whole thing, that’s your only question?” Dean remarked, slowly sitting up. “I just made up a number. You weren’t actually jealous were you?”
“This isn’t going to be a Buffy rip-off is it? Like his soul was pulled out of Heaven?” Charlie wonders aloud to the room.
“You did take care of my baby,” John comments. Dean isn’t sure if he’s referring to the Impala, or maybe Sam, and he doesn’t ask.
Dean isn’t the only one who notices the prophet’s good mood. John smiles at Charlie. “So, you and Kevin? How long have you two been together?”
Dean is so thrown off by the absurdity of that statement, of the entire situation, that he doesn’t know whether to laugh or scream. Is that a rhetorical question? Does John actually expect him to answer that?
At least, Dean was happy to have Kevin back with them until the day he tried to get Cas’ help with the tablet. That seemed to trigger a bad memory that caused to Cas spend the next three days moping around the bunker, barely getting out of bed. Dean carefully hides any alcohol and pills they have laying around.
“Supply run. He should be back soon,” Dean answers, “Let’s go meet the other residents of Hotel Winchester.”
Sam and Dean are deep into the Men of Letters library, scanning what feels like every book on the shelves, trying to identify the symbol. Dean’s eyeballs feel strained from too much reading and not enough sleep. Finding one symbol out of thousands is a daunting task even on the best of days. Dean can feel his patience stretching even thinner, as John paces the room, not even bothering to pick up a book. Dean traces over the symbol on the printout from his phone, trying to recall if he’s ever seen it before. It’s in the shape of an “A” with lots of scrollwork, but nothing about it really stands out.
If it were Sam looking at the wings, his geek brain would be in overdrive.  He would be asking Castiel all sorts of questions about how the wings worked, and what plane or dimension they were in most of the time.  Dean’s brain didn’t work like that.
“Okay, enough bullshit Dean. I want you to tell me, right now, exactly what is going on between you and Castiel.”
Dean had never heard him nervous before.  His stomach did a little somersault at the thought.  He couldn’t let Cas flounder like this.  He suddenly wanted to see him in person.  He needed to look Cas in the eyes, and explain to him why Dean had been so weird lately.
Charlie has gone still beside him. In fact, she’s doing a rather good impression of Castiel’s earlier days, by staring intently at the figure in front of her. Dean looks from her to Cas, and back again. Then he looks over to Cas, to try and see what Charlie is seeing.
Bumped up the rating because in this chapter Dean goes to a strip club and gets turned on (naughty boy!) but it’s nothing too graphic.
Sam found an entire second library hidden in the bunker, full of books that needed to be categorized.  He asked Dean if he wanted to help with the organization and Dean was proud of himself for not laughing in his brother’s face.
Sam gives him one of his best bitchfaces at that comment. He can tell Dean is avoiding Cas, but says nothing. He returns with Cas, hours later, arms loaded with shopping bags of clothes. He still doesn’t say anything to Dean when they get home, but just starts showing Cas how the washing machine works.
“I only ask because of the prostate exam I am required to do,” the doctor explained, as he pulled latex gloves from the pocket of his lab coat.
There were a few things in life Dean Winchester was grateful for; his family, his car, and 24-hour roadside diners. Even at one o’clock in the morning, after taking out a vamp nest, he could order a short stack of pancakes, with a side of bacon and sausage. He’d earned it.
The clerk handed over the candy and soda quickly while another turned to get their popcorn and Dean nodded when they asked if he wanted butter.
Dean squinted at the pictures on his phone.  They were both nearly identical.  Cas, stonily staring down his phone’s camera, in his basic suit and trenchcoat ensemble in both pictures. In one he was wearing a green tie, and in the other photo a red tie.
“Go take a shower, while I make some coffee," Sam said wrinkling his nose, "We can take it on the road with us.  I’ll drive.”
Dean nods, short and tight, not trusting his voice at the moment. Cas wobbles again, but then seems to find his footing. Dean slowly removes his hands to see if the angel can stand on his own. He looks more stable, but Dean doesn’t trust it to last too long.
Dean opened his phone, to a picture of a wide, clear field featuring a sign that read “Welcome to Kansas.” The text from Cas read:
. Like we’re a couple or ask if we’re married. Like that waiter at the diner tonight. It’s not the first time something like that has happened recently.”
Cas couldn’t help but smile at that, and laughed as Dean kissed him. The kiss quickly became more heated, as Dean nipped at Cas’ bottom lip.
“Nothing yet,” Sam says, sounding disappointed, “I couldn’t even tell you which culture it’s from. I only wish we knew if there were more of these in Lawrence anywhere.”
John boggles at his eldest son. “You mean you’re shacking up with another man, and he’s not even human?!”
“Your mother would be ashamed of who you’ve become,” John remarks coldly, words pushed out between gritted teeth.
Dean rubbed at the pinched muscle in his neck and blinked up at Cas. Most of the lights were off in the Bunker except the few desk lamps in the library, bathing the room in soft orange light and deep gray shadows. It made Cas look more ethereal and reminded him of that moment in Bobby’s kitchen years ago when Cas had been a soldier of Heaven.
The solution to his problem comes quite easily once Sam stops thinking about it. They are on a case in Salem, Oregon that turned out to be a simple salt and burn. They had to dig up a frozen gravesite since it was winter, but that had been the hardest part of the weekend. Dean suggested they spend the night, when it started to snow in earnest, and Sam did not argue. He had offered to get them coffees at a shop near their hotel.
This is, by far, the longest fic I have ever written in my life. I know it's lacking in prose (and probably a few other things) but I'm glad I saw it through to the end. I hope I can get better with time. And maybe, if I'm lucky, I will have shed some light on a few spots in canon that were left in the dark.
Getting back into the dirty suit after taking a shower would be counterproductive, so Dean finds Cas a pair of his jeans and t-shirt to change into. He gives them to Sam to bring to Cas, since it’s too soon to look at the guy again. When Sam reminds him that Cas will need a wardrobe of his own, Dean hands over the keys to the Impala and one of their bogus credit cards. He pats Sammy firmly on the shoulder and tells them to have a fun Girls Day Out.
Dean didn’t dare open his eyes to find out how close Cas was. He just kept breathing and focusing on happy thoughts. And, if those thoughts happened to include a certain dark-haired doctor, naked on the exam table with him, no one had to know about that but Dean.
Dean takes a deep breath, processing the information. If the man really is John, then the immediate danger should be past. The rest of the questions they can answer together. Dean steps forward offering his father his hand.
“In fact,” Dean said, slipping back into his bedroom voice, “I think I might have forgotten my wallet doctor. I will have to think of another way to repay you for your services.”
After that, Sam insisted they watch a marathon of Christmas movies together. While Dean held firm on his favorite being
Cas has a puzzled look on his face, like he can’t figure out what to say to this odd human in front of him. That earns a smile and small chuckle from Kevin, who has been all too quiet lately. That settles it in Dean’s mind. They could all use a break.
Dean can tell the slip did not go unnoticed by his father, or Sam. The latter giving him a mixed look of sympathy and understanding.
That night quickly became one of Dean’s favorite Christmases, even though Dean and Cas most definitely did not cuddle together under a blanket in front of a twinkling Christmas tree. Dean was a manly man after all, and adverse to such things. Besides, no one on the planet could prove otherwise. And if Dean stuck a bough of mistletoe onto the doorway of his bedroom, no one would know anything about that either.
“She told me to come to Lawrence and to hurry,” Sam says. “She didn’t say anything about dad. Just that she had seen something and it was important that I get there as soon as possible.”
Between Cas moping around, and Sam sleeping all day, Dean decides that Team Free Will is going on an extended vacation. The rest of the world can be put on hold while Dean fixes his family. If anything, he figures the world owes them this once.
After a quick breakfast, everyone moves to the library to check on the progress Sam made. He boots up his laptop.
“My husband and I had our fair share of arguments and we were together for forty-five years. How long have the two of you been together?”
It was four long days before Dean and Sam were able to hunt down the monster - similar to a changeling but it hadn’t fed on any of the parents yet.  They made it back to the bunker, dragging their feet.  Dean was happy to see home again.  The time had seemed much longer, especially with no word from Cas.  Four days of radio silence.  Four days where Dean most definitely did not check his phone every ten or twenty minutes.  Four days where he didn’t feel his phone phantom vibrate in his pocket, and hurry to answer, only to find that no one was there.  Four days where Dean felt like an idiot for not replying to that damn picture message.
.  Dean looked at his picture.  He looked bored.  That wasn’t right.  Dean tried again, but he looked even more confused in the second picture.  Damn.  How did everyone take freakin’ selfies all the time?  Dean turned the camera on himself one more time.  He looked into the lens, and tried to imagine he was looking into Castiel’s eyes.  He tried to convey how he was feeling - glad to see his friend again after being apart from him for so long.
“I just mean,” Dean backpedaled quickly, “Dr. Smith didn’t have the best bedside manner. Not exactly what you want during a physical, if you know what I mean.”
That night, Dean teaches Cas how to shoot pool and darts. He tries to teach him quarters, but ends up getting schooled when it turns out that Cas is better than him, and Dean has to tap out before he gets too drunk to drive them back. Cas, who is much drunker than he will admit, tries to teach Dean a drinking song, but it’s in Enochian so it doesn’t really work out too well. Dean almost falls out of his chair laughing as Cas tries to remember the translation. It’s the most fun Dean can remember having in a very long time.
had to go make a phone call to headquarters,” Dean said, folding his arms across his chest and trying to look serious so hopefully he could get this damn interview over as soon as possible and go grab a burger with Cas.
John finally turns to look at Sam and Dean, as if he is only now realizing they are present. Sam tries again to coax him towards the sidewalk.
Dean returns to the bunker, full of energy, excited to tell Sam his brilliant idea. Maybe if he can distract his brother, he’ll forget what they were even talking about before Dean left.
“That is a good question actually,” Sam says, “What is the last thing you remember dad? Where were you before coming here?”
Castiel still won’t look him in the eye, so Dean gives up, and walks away. Maybe Cas should know what it’s like to get a taste of his own medicine.
Dean, Sam, and Cas return to the bunker to find a note from Charlie. She had gone to check on one of her cousins in Nebraska, and said she would call soon.
Dean parked the Impala outside of a dark club that advertised “Live! Nude! Girls!” in bright neon.  The bouncer waved him in, and he walked up to the bar to order a beer.  He looked around, taking in the sights.  A lot of the girls were pretty, and a cute blonde waitress winked as she strutted by him.  Before Dean could come up with an opening line, there was a loud cheer over by the main stage.  Intrigued, Dean took an empty seat at the end and waited for the next act to start.
John takes Dean’s hand and the grasp is the same firm Marine handshake that Dean remembers. The one John taught him how to give to people, if he wanted to “be a man.” This is definitely the real John Winchester.
Sam saw this brother start to weaken, and played his big cards. “You can cook a big dinner, with all the leftovers. We could invite all the people who have helped us over the years. Charlie, Jody, Kevin, Cas.”
Sam also took care of all of the decorations. He didn’t even have to overdo it. He was able to cut down his own modest tree (it didn’t even bother him to break that small law, after breaking so many bigger ones) and buy a few simple decorations including the most important one of all. Sam had used a spell to enchant several sprigs of mistletoe and hung them over various entryways. He had tried to hide some of them with garlands or lights so Dean would not notice. All Sam needed was for Dean and Cas to stand in the same doorway at some point, and the spell would encourage them to act on their subconscious desires.
and Dean was so excited for some vintage Harrison Ford action. Even if Sam and Jack had decided not to come and be lore nerds at home instead.
, but since I'm not great at prompts I'm posting it here as a bit of an experiment. I couldn't find a beta, so I'm hoping to get some feedback.
“No problem, but next time we go hunting you might want to silence your cell phone,” Sam said with a slight smirk at his brother.
That night, having gone to bed right after dinner, Dean found himself tossing and turning in bed unable to sleep.  He felt like a jackass.  He knew exactly what was keeping him awake and it was the feeling of guilt over what he had done to Cas.  His best friend had shared something personal and Dean had responded by ignoring him.
That night they sleep (or Dean does anyway) holding hands in the dark. But it’s only sleep and taking comfort in being near each other.
Dean nodded and got to his feet, knowing he would make it a quick shower.  The adrenaline helped clear up the worst of the hangover.  This is why they always kept their weapons in the Impala ready to go.  Always be prepared - the hunter motto.  Or maybe that was the Boy Scouts?  But still, good advice.
John slides into the backseat of the Impala next to Cas, and Dean eyes them warily in the rearview mirror. This could be a very long ride. John turns to Castiel, sizing him up before he speaks.
They got back to Lebanon about two hours later. Jack asked Cas to look at a lore book he had in his room. Dean watched them walk down the hallway and put a hand out on Sam’s shoulder to stop him.
Castiel continued to text Dean intermittently.  He seemed to enjoy using emoticons in almost every text.  It wasn’t just the usual colons and parentheses, Cas liked to include small characters wearing sunglasses or icons of food.  Sam told him they were called emojis.  Dean didn’t know what that meant, he just told Cas his texts looked like they came from a 14-year-old girl.
They go back to the diner a couple weeks later, but it’s just Dean and Cas this time. They’re sharing one piece of pie, even if Cas is sort of picking at the edges more than eating any. He’s doing it for appearances. Dean had asked Cas to sit on the same side of the booth again so they could hold hands under the table.
They arrive at Stull Cemetery with less fanfare than when Dean drove in years ago. The cemetery looks ordinary, as far as cemeteries go. Gray slate headstones sit in short rows and the grass is withered, and dying, since no one cares for the cemetery anymore.
Dean breaths heavily, but it feels like he isn’t getting any oxygen again. It feels like there is a hand on his throat, squeezing the life from him. Only this time he knows it’s all in his mind.
Sam gives him a hurt puppy dog look, and mumbles something about research. Dean almost feels bad for taking out his anger on Sammy, but he isn’t going to apologize for it. Besides, he is right. Finishing the trials and locking up all the demons is the only thing that matters now.
Dean closed his eyes and shook his head, which sort of made the room spin, so not his best idea.  He opened his eyes and the pictures were still on his phone.  Okay, so he wasn’t that drunk.
“C’mon dad, let’s go back to the bunker until we can figure this out,” Sam says, trying to keep the peace.
Dean drew in a breath to hide his groan as he complied. He felt a warm but rubbery hand on one cheek, spreading him open.
Dean feels a sudden stabbing pain in his throat, and starts coughing hard enough to bruise his ribs. He falls to his knees, feeling dizzy, and starts coughing up blood.
“I can see it was the right choice to give her to you. I always knew you had a soft spot for this car.”
Sam thought about how the spell must have worked. Dean had made his family and friends a home-cooked meal in his own kitchen, and got to enjoy all of them being together. Dean had not only his own home, but his own room, which he had gotten to show to his crush. He finally had a space all his own, and people to share it with. Dean Winchester craved the normal domestic life, the one he never got to have growing up. And his subconscious desire had been to fit Castiel into that life. That must have been what the spell reacted to. Sam smiled, thinking his brother could put on a brave, gruff exterior, but he really had the biggest heart of them all.
Dean wasn’t normally a fan of shorter haircuts on women, but this time it was sort of working for him.  Her body was athletic not curvy, but she had so much control over it, that it was impressive.  Yes, she was a little flat chested, but Dean could ignore that for all of the confidence she had.  And her eyes were her best feature.  Dean was staring into these intense blue eyes, and it was like nothing else in the room existed.  The music had faded away.  He didn’t notice any other people in the club.  All that he saw were blue eyes, and all he felt was how fast his heart was beating.
“Sam? What is it? What–“ but the rest of the question evaporates, as the color drains from Dean’s face.
“Looks great,” he said, willing Cas to cover himself back up, and hoping his voice didn’t sound as high-pitched as it did in his head.
Cas stared at the clothes hangers for a moment as though he wanted to smite them, but snatched them out of Dean’s hands and went into the changing room. Tinny pop music blasted out of the department store speakers, offending Dean’s eardrums.
A female witness, with dark auburn hair and brown eyes, who seemed to have the hots for Cas. She tried to turn everything he was saying into a joke or an innuendo. And she kept playing with her hair and smiling at him. Cas was polite, trying to keep up their appearance as police detectives, and not giving her much attention. But that didn’t seem to throw her off.
“It’s nice to see couples shopping together,” the associate said, “Let me know if you need anything else.”
“I didn’t say they were all women,” Dean replied before his brain could filter what his mouth was saying.
“You know, Mary Winchester always believed angels were watching over you Dean. She wasn’t wrong. Even before I pulled you out of Hell.”
“Sorry about all of this dad. We shoulda warned you. Angels can be a real bitch sometimes,” Dean says.
“Sometimes you just want the full movie theatre experience, trust me,” Dean said, clapping Cas on the shoulder.
Sam wanted to pull his hair out in frustration. If these two didn’t kiss, and soon, they would both wind up alone and miserable. Sam looked for any ridiculous opportunity to get them to stand together in a doorway together, but nothing presented itself. Soon it was getting late, and Jody and Garth left first to get back to their long drives. Charlie actually asked to stay the night so she could show Kevin a MMORPG that she was designing (whatever that meant).
Dr. Novak chuckled softly. “At least you’re being safe Dean. That’s a good thing.” The doctor looked over to Dean to gauge his reaction, and that’s when Dean realized he was looking into the bluest eyes he’d ever seen. If he’d been more prone to poetry, he could have written lines about the color and the intensity in the other man’s eyes.
“I guess we’ll have to go back to Lawrence. Visit the old house and see what we can find there. It’s late already. Let’s all get a few hours of shut eye and we’ll head out in the morning,” Dean replies.
It takes a moment for the words to actually register in Dean’s mind. He is sure that can’t be the end of Castiel’s sentence. Surely, he meant to say he had lost it and then gotten it back. There’s no way Crowley can possess the angel tablet, because that isn’t good news for any of them. When Castiel still refuses to look Dean in the eye, that’s when Dean is forced to face the truth.
Cas looks deep into Dean’s eyes at that. All the years they have known each other, and they have never discussed Mary. In fact, the only time John has come up is when they were talking about a hunt. Ironically, Dean thinks, it is because of John that Dean even met Castiel, if you wanted to look at it that way. Dean had been saved because of a deal John had made with a demon. So when Sam needed to be saved, Dean had done the same thing as his father, making a crossroads deal and landing himself in the Pit and in a position to be saved by the angel.
Texas turned out to be more complicated than they thought.  Luckily, Sam and Dean had found all the kids, but not what had been taking them.  The trail had gone cold.  None of the kids stories matched about what they had seen, so they had little to go on.  The brothers were happy to return the kids to their parents, but didn’t want to leave until they hunted down the monster to make sure it didn't abduct anyone else.  They camped out in a small hotel at the edge of town, trying to piece everything together.
He just sees Castiel. Same slender body covered in an old suit and trench coat, tie still on backwards no matter how many times Dean had shown him how to fix it properly. His hair, as always, is an artful mess. Dean had teased him once about spending more time learning how to style his hair, than he did hunting demons. Cas had just glared at him, but it had lacked his Spiteful Angel look, like that night in Bobby’s kitchen, so many years earlier.
“I don’t think so. According to this, Voodoo actually has roots in Catholicism. It says here ‘Loa are actually fallen angels of sorts that God allows to still perform work for him among the humans’.”
Dean barks out a short laugh. “Yeah, you missed the boat on that one dad. I actually did try to have that life. I lived with a woman and her son for a year, but all it did was put them in danger. And it made me realize that this is who I am always going to be – a hunter.”
They kiss for so long the windows of the Impala are fogged up when they pull apart and they have to sit in the parking lot with the defroster running for a few minutes for it to clear. The progress is slowed due to their additional kisses.
“Look, Cas, you can stay here until you’re healed up. But, and I’m only going to say this once, you need to figure out where it is that you want to be. If you’re going to be here, you have to start trusting me. That’s the only way this is going to work.”
Azrael turns to John, eyes cold and unflinching. He sneers at the human before him. “You will say yes, because it’s the only way to save your sons,” Azrael says.
When the universe decides to throw Dean Winchester a curve ball, it doesn’t hold back. Not only was the last trial a failure, leaving the gates of Hell open, but Sam is hurting from all that he had to go through. He is sick and broken, sleeping nearly all day long, and still trying to convince Dean that he’s fine. No doctors or medicine can heal the trauma that Sam went through, and the real bitch of it is, it all turned out to be for nothing. They weren’t able to close off Hell, so all the time and effort spent on the trials had been a waste.
Was this what it felt like for the guys who bottomed for him? No wonder they were always so damn eager.
After that, the messages came regularly again.  Castiel kept texting pictures, and messages throughout his travels.  It wasn’t long before Dean noticed that the texts started getting more personal again.  Castiel sent pictures of band t-shirts that he thought Dean might like.  And the scenery or landscapes Cas was sending were specific places that Castiel said he wanted to visit with Dean.
One house in particular seems to be at the eye of the storm. The wind screeches through the town, but it is eerily still at this residence. As if the storm were only happening around it, like some kind of malevolent snow globe. Then one bright bolt of lightning strikes the front yard of the house. A smell like burnt ozone whips through the air. After that, the storm clears as if it had never been there. Clouds dissipate, and the world normalizes. People cautiously head outdoors again to assess the damage and find nothing out of place.
Cas seems too tired to argue with both Charlie and Dean, and takes some of the offered snack. They discover that Cas actually enjoys the salty food, as he eats nearly an entire bowl by himself.
“Just that there was a terrible lightning storm in Lawrence last night. So strong, people thought it might be a freak tornado. It disappeared as quickly as it came. No one injured. Nothing out of the ordinary except for dad coming back, as far as we could tell.”
As Sam enters the study, Dean looks over to ask if he remembered the pie. The statement dies on his tongue as he sees the bewildered look on Sam’s face.
She smiles, and it’s almost predatory. Dean has seen women like her before. If she gets her claws into Cas, Dean won’t see him again for the rest of the night. Dean wanted to get him laid, sure, but he thinks they can do better for Cas’ first time.
When they get up five or six hours later, Dean stays close to Cas’ orbit; in the kitchen making everyone sandwiches or leaning over his shoulder when he’s looking up cases on Dean’s laptop.
“I’m going to have to insert another finger, in order to locate your prostate. Is that alright, Dean?”
Everyone in the bunker seems to get into the holiday spirit. Dean is completely onboard since it was his idea, and it keeps him from facing his issues with Cas. Sam might send Dean a look or two when Cas is in the room, but he says nothing. He helps Dean string lights and finds Christmas music to play on the hi-fi. Even Kevin stops his translating duties long enough to cut out sugar cookies with Dean. He says he used to do it with his mom every Christmas, but he doesn’t let himself wallow in the memories of losing her.
“You look out for my boys, you hear?” he asks, but it’s not really a question. Castiel seems to understand and he gives John his most sincere expression.
John’s eyes open at the sound of Dean’s voice, as it gives him something to focus on. Dean takes his hand and squeezes.
They walk over to the site where Lucifer’s cage was opened, and the ground looks intact. Dean had been expecting to find an altar built on the site, or some sigils burned into the grass. Dean looks over to see Sam anxiously rubbing the faded scar on his palm. Poor guy is probably remembering the last time he was in this cemetery, and Dean feels a twinge in his own chest at the memory.
“I don’t know,” Dean responds in a quiet whisper. Those three easier words fly out of his mouth – so much easier than the other three words he can’t bring himself to say.
Sam rolls his eyes, interrupting Dean’s lecture. “Dean, give me some credit. I have been hunting my whole life too.”
Cas lifted up his shirts, showing how the denim hugged his hips and flashed them a sliver of his stomach. Then he turned around to show the fit on the back and Dean suddenly had to clear his throat and couldn’t help but shift his weight where he stood.
Cas chuckled again, but then gasped as Dean began sucking on the pulse point of his neck and teasing his nipples with his rough, strong fingers.
He pushes back from the table, and heads to his room. Sam can sort their dad out with a place to sleep. If Dean talks to the man any longer, he might not be able to control what comes out of his mouth. He spent his whole life being loyal to the man, becoming the good soldier his father always wanted him to be. He took care of Sammy, and gave up on a normal life to hunt monsters. What more does John want?
, who is more talented than I could ever hope to be. A huge thank you to my betas Fea and Kara! Your insights were invaluable, and I could not have written this without either of you! Also thank you to
“Everything sounds good,” Dr. Novak said, also checking Dean’s lungs. He moved back around the front of the exam table.
“Now, you want to just keep patting it, until it forms a ball, okay?” Dean instructs, like talking to a small child.
“And I’m here if you need to talk, but right now it’s almost 3am so I’m going to bed. Good night Dean.”
Dean doesn’t know if Sam is right or not. In that moment, Dean doesn’t want to know. All he wants is for things to go back to normal, but he doesn’t see that happening. So, Dean does what he does best.
But what does Dean want for himself? Sometimes the pressure of everything he has to face feels like it is physically pressing down on him. It feels like he’s trying to tread water, but something keeps trying to push him under.
Surprisingly, John doesn’t yell back. He lets out a low sigh and holds up his hands. “Okay, Dean. No more fighting. I get it.”
It might have been funnier if Dean hadn’t been trying to stalk a werewolf the first time it happened.  Of course, Dean should have put his phone on vibrate that was Hunter 101.  But he had forgotten because not many people call him or even have his number.  Dean had scrambled to silence his phone, but the werewolf had already heard him and found his hiding space.  The monster had thrown Dean against the wall of the warehouse, which knocked the wind out of him.  Luckily, Sam was there to put two silver bullets into the werewolf before it could cause any real damage.
One of the coolest features of the bunker, one that Dean loves even more than his bedroom or the kitchen, is the underground garage where he can park the Impala. It is safer than leaving her out in the open. Dean likes to spend time with the old Chevy when he can, because it relaxes him to polish the smooth black metal or tinker with the engine – things he knows he can fix. That’s where he is now, getting everything loaded and ready to go. Doesn’t take long for his father to find him. Of course, he would know where the car is, since he took her for a joy ride earlier.
Dean walks down the hallway, shoving all of his personal feelings away where he won’t have to think about them. Closing Hell is Priority #1.
. I’m sorry. Neither of you wear rings, so I assumed -” she cut off her own thought and seemed to change topic mid-sentence, “I see if you’re undercover you might not be able to wear jewelry that would give it away. I get it. Don’t worry Detective I won’t say another word about it.”
Dean waited in line with Cas at the concession counter, which doubled as the box office in this small theatre, but it saved him a trip because having snacks during a movie was the law.
There is was.  The proverbial elephant in the room.  Dean had ignored the last text about Cas’ wings, and he had lived with the guilt about it for days.  He wouldn’t be making that same mistake again.  He had to let Cas know that he didn’t mind the wings.  Dean had to acknowledge them if he ever wanted to be able to see them in person.  Which he wanted to happen more than just about anything - he was not going to even try and convince himself otherwise.
“I don’t really remember much. Just woke up in our old front yard in Lawrence yesterday. Not a scratch on me. Didn’t even know what year it was until I walked over to Missouri’s to borrow her phone. That’s when she called Sam,” John explains.
Sighing, Dean clicked off the lamp and laid down to try and sleep.  He figured he had this coming.  He had ignored Cas for several days, so this was just karma.
As he draws back, he realizes it didn’t feel strange to do that. The only awkwardness is now because of the fact that it felt normal to kiss Cas. He hears Sam’s words -
Dean swore as he swiped open his phone, grumpy about being interrupted from the only good dream he had had in weeks.  He was determined to finally change that damn ringtone once and for all.  What he saw stopped him in his tracks.
“Okay. So let’s ignore the fact that you got all the way to Lawrence, picked up our father, and brought him back here – without calling by the way, thanks for that. Was there anything else you neglected to mention?”
Dean started to get a little bored.  He kept clicking his phone screen on again, to make sure he hadn’t missed a notification.  Nothing.
John gives Charlie a puzzled look, mouth comically hanging open. Dean has to fight back a laugh, and chooses to start shoveling eggs in his mouth instead of trying to get involved.
He awoke with a snort and then immediately groaned at the position his neck had been in. Turns out passing out on top of the table hadn’t been a good decision.
The evening air is sharp and biting without the sun to warm it. Tiny snowflakes drift gently to the ground, swirling through the air currents. There is already a thick blanket of white snow, unblemished and untouched by anyone. The full moon makes the snow sparkle, like a child’s art project covered in glitter. Dean leads Cas over to a clear patch of snow near the bunker.
Now those blue eyes are focused on Dean, and not for the first time he wondered if Cas was seeing him or something deeper inside of him. Maybe Cas has always seen the real Dean - more than anyone ever could or wanted to.
“You and Cas are close, you’ve known each other for a decade, maybe you’ve gotten so comfortable around each other people think you could be a couple.”
Cas ends up falling asleep in the Impala on the way home. His head bobs up and down, before falling over onto Dean’s shoulder. Dean tries to shrug him off so he can drive, but ends up with a head of dark hair in his lap instead.
“Sure it is. But I keep fucking it up. Couldn’t keep you safe from Yellow Eyes. From Ruby. I’m not even good enough to make dad happy after he’s dead,” Dean laughs at that last, but it is a sharp humorless laugh, hardened by the booze and anger in his system.
Dean wasn’t sure what label suited him best, but he knew that there was something about being around Cas that made him happy. Something that made him want to grab Cas by the arm or shoulder as often as possible or squeeze next to him on the sofa for movie nights. Something about Cas made Dean want to treat him differently than if he was family and more than a friend.
“I know you’re not big on Cas, but you need to understand that he’s not going anywhere. He has been there for me, and Sammy, time and again. He pulled me out of Hell – literally. He rebelled against Heaven. He fought his own brothers for us. He’s even died for us a time or two. He is important dad. He’s family.”
“You got a call from Missouri, and thought it was a good idea to keep that to yourself?!” Dean shouts, filled with rage at his brother.
Everyone else is in the kitchen by the time Dean and Cas get there. No one even says anything about them walking in together. Or about the fact that Dean automatically pours a cup of coffee for each of them. Charlie is loading up plates full of scrambled eggs at the stove, and Kevin is carrying them over to the table for her, an actual smile on his face.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, we have been busy lately,” Dean grumbles. He leaves out the “Taking care of your busted ass” comment because he knows it wasn’t Sam’s choice and he would only feel worse about it.
“Looks like it’s just you and me then, huh Cas?” Dean asks with a wink, as he clinks their beer bottles together.
, Dean thinks to himself. He wants to believe it, he really does. He almost buys the story he is selling himself, but then Cas stands to remove his own trousers and slide under the covers, his eyes never leaving Dean’s the entire time.
Dean and Sam exchange meaningful looks at this. Dean can tell exactly what his brother is thinking. Michael, the same Archangel who wanted Dean to be his prom date for Apocalypse 2010. The Archangel who had been able to use the younger John Winchester, and eventually Adam, as his vessels. The same Archangel who is currently permanent roommates with Lucifer in the cage. Somebody must be trying to raise Michael out of the cage, by using the John to do it.
