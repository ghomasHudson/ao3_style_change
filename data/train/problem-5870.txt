Steve straightens up. Now that the babies are asleep again and everything is calm, the shadow of reality slowly comes back to him. The dopamine surge he’s just got keeps it from landing on him as quite as dark as it was earlier, but it’s there, as background radiation.
Tony kissed his jaw, holding it in place, then his throat. His other hand came up to palm Steve’s chest, pinching his nipple softly, and Steve drew a sharp breath, warmth running into his groin. His body moved on its own, coming close enough for Tony to be able to mouth his other nipple, wet and soft, his beard scratching the skin in a way that was quickly driving Steve mad. A hand landed on Steve’s lower back, pushing him even closer to Tony.
Steve shakes his head, the tears dropping to his lap and forming dark spots on the fabric of his suit. It takes a while before he’s able to continue.
“Pretty much”, he answers, and the reference doesn’t go unnoticed by Tony. He snorts, giving Steve’s hand a firm squeeze.
”We got bonded three years ago”, he says solemnly, the reflection of the flames dancing in his eyes. ”Tony’s my alpha, and for me he’ll be that until the day I die. Even if he’ll want – want a bond break. Which, I’m guessing he will. He’s not the most forgiving person.”
”Good morning, Captain”, a man’s voice says. Steve recognises it, and for a moment the surge of dopamine from an alpha’s presence outweighs even the disappointment that the alpha in question isn’t Tony.
Steve blushes at being caught with probably very obvious lust on his face, and Tony presses his fingers around his throat a little tighter, his thumb stroking the skin.
Despite all of his efforts, some paparazzi did manage to snap a photo of him when he was waiting the twins and sell it to the tabloids for an astronomical amount of money. One Tony Stark had paid the paparazzi a visit and told him to give the money off to charity or he’d be fighting with SI lawyers until he, his dead mother and everyone he knew was bankrupt. Still, Steve hadn’t been able to go to the internet for a month without CAPTAIN AMERICA PREGNANT – SEE THE PICTURES slamming to his face.
”I’ve missed you so much”, Steve continued in a low voice, caressing Tony’s ass cheek with his hand again. ”Just let me take care of you, alpha.”
”Tony”, he breathes out, the slight relief from hearing Tony’s voice disappearing quickly when he registers the connection starting to go weak. It isn’t difficult to put two and two together.
“Have you brushed your teeth?” Steve asked, pulling Tony backwards to face him. Tony opened his eyes to look at him sleepily.
Tony gives himself a few strokes, and Steve watches his motions with hungry eyes, emitting a needy whine. He hopes that Tony doesn’t want him to beg, because he’s not sure if he has it in him to beg. He’s more a puddle than a man at this point.
”I mean that it’s entirely possible to genuinely want a child and also hope that having them will fix your relationship. It’s more common than you might think. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you didn’t want your children, and it most definitely doesn’t mean that you don’t love them.”
”Apparently it’s not uncommon for the cycle to get pushed by a few weeks after pregnancy. He wanted to take blood tests, though. I’ll go next week.”
”Legs more apart”, Tony orders when he’s got the strings off of Steve, and Steve does as told without thinking, widening the gap between his knees.
Steve’s surprised of his concern. He’s certainly in pain, but the worst of it is psychological. The physical pain is not nearly on the fainting level it had gotten to before.
He feels like melting when Tony blows air onto his skin, his hands holding him in place by the hips, before placing a light kiss onto his tailbone. The kiss tickles a bit, but Steve has no trouble following the instructions and staying in place now. Well, a little when a hand moves underneath him and grabs his still half-erect cock through the come-soaked fabric of the strings.
He tries to think about something arousing, but he doesn’t know how to do that without thinking about Tony. It’s all his body has ever known. With a defeated sigh, he closes his eyes, allowing his mind to go there. To Tony kissing him, Tony’s hand sliding down his body, Tony gently tugging at his hair and sighing as he pushes his cock into him.
But Steve interrupts his perfect plan when they reach the bed, and instead of following Tony to it he falls to his knees in front of him, a familiar display of respect.
Steve’s brows furrow as he watches Tony shuffle out the door. He gives Emmett a look and Emmett grins with his finger in his mouth, looking like he’s happy to be part of a secret, unvoiced shit-talk with Steve. Naturally the baby doesn’t actually have any idea what’s going on, but his expression still manages to amuse Steve a little.
”Do you have any idea how hard it is to punish you when you look like this? When you look at me with tears in those eyes?”
”I nearly choked on my morning coffee”, Nat takes over. ”It just said to check up on you and that you were in heat. I rushed here and even I could smell it when I came into the room.”
”Oh, come on, Tony. The moment you saw that in Steve you were his”, Pepper says, and there’s no bitterness in her voice. What was between them is long in the past now.
Because they won’t be. There’ll be no shared meals, no talks, no nothing. He doesn’t want to see Steve, and he tells him that.
”You’re not impotent, Tony”, he said firmly, moving himself back to eye level with Tony. Things had kind of escalated in the hospital one night and Steve had ended up giving Tony a handjob, so they could assume that it wasn’t a problem stemming from the damage to his brain the shock from the snap had caused. ”And your arm will heal. You just need to have a little patience.”
Time seems to slow down, like the universe itself is trying to draw out the inevitable. But it can’t stop Thanos, just like none of them could, and Thanos snaps his fingers.
”Of course not. It would honestly be no trouble, Peter” he says as earnestly as he can, and because he’s Steve Rogers, it’s pretty damn earnest.
Fluttering his eyes finally open, Steve grabs Tony’s forearm and kisses his wrist. It’s the ”bad” arm, the one coated with scar tissue all the way up to Tony’s neck. A lot of the touch in it has been lost, but the wrist does feel and Steve knows it. Tony presses a reciprocative kiss to Steve’s neck, and Steve reaches back to run his fingers through Tony’s hair as he cranes his neck languidly to expose it better.
”You could blame me for most likely destroying our chances of having more children. Possibly destroying our sex life for forever”, Steve says straight out. He’s calm, but Tony knows it’s just a mask.
When some sense starts to come back to Steve, he bends his hand back to rub Tony’s shoulder briefly.
Tony does however look into Pym’s research. He’s read through most of it before, including everything he’s been able to dig up about the Ant-Man technology. Tony had found Pym’s research about the quantum realm astonishing before, but now, when he looks into it again, a shiver runs down his spine. There’s a lot of new data, and some of it is from the day of the snap. Pym had been experimenting on that very day, and from the way the data looks incomplete, it seems that the man had gone in the midst of his experiment.
Obliging, Steve buries his teeth to Tony’s neck once again, a fourth purple mark starting to form onto his skin. He doesn’t hold back, but once in a while he stops to mouth Tony’s neck wetly, lewdly, using his tongue. His drool is getting all over and it really shouldn’t be that hot but Tony’s hips are bucking upwards uncontrollably, the source of his frantic wails alternating between pain and pleasure. Steve catches his other hand like the already locked one, pushing it against the seat forcefully. Tony hardly seems to even notice at this point.
The machine is still keeping Tony alive now, when Steve pulls his chair next to his bed. He takes Tony’s hand into his, the one not wrapped in layers and layers of bandages. Instead of just holding onto it, he studies it briefly, determining the state of Tony’s nails. They’re fine, of course, as Steve cut them only a couple of days ago. He just wishes there was something more for him to do.
”I can fuck you, honey. Gladly. I can fuck you hard, if that’s what you need. But not like I’m goddamn raping you.”
Steve had found himself adoring the way people had turned the terror Thanos had put them through into a joke. There was a time and place for everything, and he didn’t see a reason why today shouldn’t be that for laughter. For others, at least.
“Permission to talk, sir”, Steve manages on his second try, and Tony studies him for a few seconds before he answers.
”Yes, honey, I’m so close”, he moans, his chest heaving as blood breaks out into Steve’s mouth. Tony lets out a broken sound, and Steve is hit by the taste, a part of him wondering if it might be too far. But another part of him can only think like an animal, about Tony helpless under him as he rides his cock mercilessly.
The alpha in Tony is yearning to take over, impatient to breed his omega. In fact, they can’t say for sure that it won’t happen now, as omegas often become fertile already on pre-heat. The thought makes Tony’s hips twitch, his knot starting to swell even though he’s not come yet. His finger hovers over Steve’s rim as he takes in the sight of his omega stretched around his cock.
”Steve, please.” Tony tried to sound annoyed, yeah right, annoyed like a starving person at the promise of a meal.
Steve shied resting his weight on Tony’s open arm because of the alpha’s weak state, but he did his best not to show it as he knew Tony would just get self-conscious and frustrated. It had been an entire discussion already when Tony had realized that he would have to give up the place of big spoon when they slept to Steve for now. Tony’s injury simply didn’t allow him to hold Steve like he wanted and was used to, and the alpha had had no choice but to adjust.
Tony takes the wrists Steve eagerly presents and clicks the handcuffs attached to the headboard around them. They’re hardly your typical pair of handcuffs, they’re much nicer and much more difficult to get out of than regular ones, even with super soldier strength. Of course, to Tony they open up with a couple of words.
”It’s okay, there’s no rush. I’ve got you”, Tony tells him, feeling his own cock filling with interest at Steve’s noises. ”You’re doing just fine, aren’t you, honey?” he asks, trying to mask it a little less worried than he actually is.
He took Tony’s cock into his mouth, but it soon became obvious that it was taking its time waking up to the attention it was receiving, so after a while Steve patiently moved lower, licking Tony’s balls and kissing his thighs unhurriedly until he heard Tony’s breath start to turn a little unsteady. He then sucked the alpha’s cock back into his mouth and did his best again, but eventually he heard Tony click his tongue frustratedly. He just wasn’t getting hard.
Despite him surely noticing the tremor, Tony doesn’t gift Steve another pity break. Steve would lie if he said that he doesn’t love that, even if it means that he has to once again watch his own face twist with a grimace as Tony then hits his shoulder blade, his aim surgically precise to avoid any harmful damage as always. As the whip bites into his other shoulder, Steve cries out loudly, the sting seeming to travel everywhere through some nerve.
“Thank you, sir”, Steve says, not just because he’s supposed to, but because he means it. For a fleeing second he can see in Tony’s eyes that he wants to just be soft, but then he spanks Steve again, hard and unforgiving. Steve’s face melts in pure adoration.
Tony’s eyes are hard as they finally land on Steve’s. He stares at him for a while, unflinching as the colour vanishes from Steve’s face. When Steve’s lip begins to quiver, Tony turns and walks away before the bond will destroy his resolve.
Steve doesn’t have to say more than that. In one swift movement, Tony has pushed him onto his stomach again and taken a firm grip of his hips, pulling him to his knees. Steve takes a ragged breath, his body ready, so ready for anything Tony will give him. He can feel Tony’s breath on his skin, where the skirt hides the parts of Steve that yearn to be touched the most. Then the skirt is lifted up, and Steve trembles with anticipation, hardly able to contain himself. Tony touches him, and Steve almost pulls away just because he’s so on the edge. But Tony forces his hips to their place, ghosting the cleft of his ass with a finger.
”He destroyed the stones”, Steve says instantly, anger boiling inside of him. ”The son of a bitch destroyed the stones, Tony.”
”Yes, honey”, Tony mumbles into his ear. He pushes Steve’s chin up so that he can lick the underside of it. ”That’s my baby. I missed you so much.”
Although things looked relatively positive now, it hadn’t been the case at all times during the past two months. When Tony’d regained consciousness, he had had to stay on the ventilator for a couple of days more as his lungs had fought to start working on their own. On two occasions he’d started to pull the tube in his sleep and woken himself up, and it had been one of the hardest things in Steve’s life to restrain Tony’s hands as he’d waited for a nurse to come give Tony a sedative. The way Tony had stared at him in panic, unable to comprehend his soothing words and explanations for why he was keeping him from freeing himself from the uncomfortable tube. Steve hadn’t slept for more than three hours in total during the days they’d been weaning Tony off the ventilator.
After Steve’s gone, Bucky stays long after the fire has turned into embers. He thinks about the times he’s been in love himself, wonders if things like mating bonds are going to be something personally relevant to him one day again. He’s not entirely sure if he even wants that – even less so when he finally goes inside, walks past Steve’s room, and hears him sobbing hopelessly. He contemplates whether to knock or not until the part of him that still sees Steve as someone he needs to protect takes over.
They’ll make it count. They’ll get everyone back, and Nat will at least be able to tell Clint’s family how brave Clint was.
Steve heard Tony swallow. He didn’t answer, which was good because he would’ve probably just made some joke, and Steve made sure that there wouldn’t be one by adding pressure into his fingers’ movements. Tony’s lips parted with a moan and Steve’s eyes soaked in the sight.
”Lube”, Steve said, moving to place a few kisses on Tony’s inner thigh, his voice unhurried. Tony had the thing in his hands in seconds, passing it to Steve who glanced at him briefly, a satisfied glint in his eyes. Tony tried to smile playfully back through his haze, rocking his hips suggestively, and followed through half lidded eyes as Steve coated his index finger with the liquid.
Tony fought his way back to the bed, lying down exhaustedly and wishing the painkillers would begin to work on his headache soon. He was tired but sleep evaded him, the pounding on his forehead too disturbing for him to be able to relax. At least it was silent. The bed felt cool and comfortable. There was nothing that demanded his attention right now.
”Is this one of those ’my poor, little alpha’ hugs”, Tony asked, the slight slurring in his speech taking the edge off of his attempt to sound irritated. He had taken another painkiller for the night and it seemed like it was kicking in.
When both babies are sleeping in their own bassinets peacefully, they’re finally able to be close to each other – a real problem with twins, no way to touch the other when all hands are full of baby. Tony climbs back to the bed, wrapping his arms around Steve and kisses his cheek.
A shiver ran down Steve’s spine, the need to have his alpha touch him there quickly overriding everything else in his mind.
”No problem”, Tony told him, his cock pushing against Steve’s prostate demandingly. ”Let me know if there are any more hiccups.”
And then Tony’s coming, groaning loudly as Steve milks him through his orgasm. Bliss fills Steve’s mind as he feels the fluid filling him, warm and
So, he headed to the workshop, where he knew he’d find his husband. Unsurprisingly, Tony was completely absorbed by something on his screens, and for a while Steve just observed him. He could watch Tony work for hours, but Tony had told him he preferred Steve wouldn’t.
Then the physical therapy had started, and Tony had been so goddamn determined to leave his bed with his own two feet that it had resulted in him falling on his way to the bathroom when Steve had let his attention slide for a minute. Thankfully nothing serious had happened, but Steve had been all the more stressed. It had seemed like life was full of nothing but little things that threatened Tony’s life at the time.
Steve obeys, wrapping his hand around himself. A soft whine leaves him at the contact, and Tony gives him a look of approval.
Steve glances at Tony standing behind him. Even completely naked, he looks powerful, in control, and Steve’s mouth waters as he glances at Tony’s cock hanging between his legs and imagines it inside of him. He wants to speak, to plead; not for Tony to stop, but to give him more, be it pain or pleasure. Just to give him anything that he is willing to give.
There’s nothing but adoration in Steve’s eyes as he watches them from the mirror, watches how beautifully Tony has him pinned under his control. He truly loves it. It might be
Tony apparently tried to hum but it came out as another growl. Steve moved lower, nuzzling his face to Tony’s neck. There was a small part of him, a slight shiver in his spine, that wanted to pull away and show submission to his growling alpha, but he soothed it down. It did help that Tony wasn’t exactly on his sharpest due to the painkillers, and that made the fact that he
”I know”, Steve says after a while, answering Tony’s gaze. To Tony’s surprise he smiles. ”You would never hurt me.”
He leaves Tony to it, thinking that Peter Parker is certainly getting an unadulterated glimpse of their everyday life. Not that he minds; Peter seems like a good kid.
Obediently, Tony shuffles to the bed, his belt clanking loudly against the wooden floor as he drops his jeans next to his side of the bed. Grimacing at the sound, he lies down as discreetly as possible. He still wants to move closer to Steve and cuddle him, but he doesn’t dare, afraid of Steve’s reaction. He’s not sensing any hostility through the bond, but the bond doesn’t always tell everything. It would be inconvenient for mates to be able to know every time their partner was even mildly dissatisfied with them.
He inhales deeply, then breathes out unevenly. Tony gets up, beginning to pace around silently and Steve wants to cry. But he feels like he doesn’t have the right.
It was too absurd for Steve to not let out a little laugh. He leaned down to kiss Tony’s forehead, and the alpha brought his hand to his face, coaxing his mouth to his.
Steve peeks in to see Tony sitting on the floor, his forehead leaned against the toilet seat. Steve steps in and rubs Tony’s shoulder comfortingly before he sits down to accompany him.
”That makes me so wet”, he says, and if he’d say it any quieter, it couldn’t be classified as said aloud at all. But Tony hears him, his wrists twitching in their ties reflexively before he gets a hold of himself again. He could slip out of them easily if he wanted to; it’s a matter of self-discipline.
Steve creeps further under the comforter. He’s not cold, but he feels a need to hide. Warily, he steals glances at Thor, who looks perfectly content drinking his beer and watching The Survivors Australia. Steve does his best to relax himself, but he can feel his body getting disturbingly excited again. Thank god – or Nat, he assumes – the sheets have at least been changed while he’s been out.
He works through the muscles in Steve’s upper back, runs his palm along his spine, presses his fingers into his neck. It’s not what Steve had hoped for at first, but soon, he finds himself relaxing, lets his eyes fall closed and just concentrates on breathing.
”Give me your wrists, Steve”, Tony tells him then, and Steve’s brain can barely tell his arms to do that. Tony pins his wrists together behind his back and picks up his pace again.
“What? Since we held hands?” Pepper’s frown deepened. “But I’m always dragging you around at galas.”
“Barton, it’s a hell yes,” Steve replied and was gloriously rewarded with a burst of surprised laughter from the other man and an arm thrown around his shoulder. Steve stomped down on the urge to lean into the contact. Anyone touching him (that is, excluding all physical engagements with the enemy, aka his unhealthy daily dose of punches and kicks) was few and far between for Steve, and he always had to hastily smother the surge of warmth it lit in his chest before he did something mortifyingly stupid like yank them into an embrace. It had been especially difficult when it was-
Stark shoved off a guard and turned his head. Blood and sweat dripped off the hairs on his chin. He locked eyes with Steve. And smiled.
“C-can you please- ? P-please- ” Rogers stuttered, the wind whirling around him so fiercely that his hair was caught in a crazed dance around his face. “Slow down. Please
He switched on the television, and instantly Tony Stark waltzed onto the screen, grinning back at him in front of a backdrop of some sparkling skyscraper and insisting that no other company had a handle on the future like Stark Industries did.
Then he’d placed a firm hand on Tony’s shoulder. Looking back, that had probably been to steady Tony as he stormed around in the snow, tipping over every few seconds. But that hadn’t occurred to Tony’s alcohol-muddled brain back then, and it had effectively stopped him in his tracks.
In his dream, he was facedown on a smooth floor. It wasn’t a particularly exciting dream, but that was more than fine to Steve.
“Right this way, Mr. Stark,” she said, reassuming her stoic attitude and marching off towards the jet black SHIELD car. Tony briefly explained the situation to Alexei then jogged after her even though the movement made his head pound.
JARVIS gave some indignant reply, but it sounded distant and garbled to Tony. The colored read-outs of data hovering in front of his face were blending together into a soupy mess of light that hurt his eyes.
“You said five minutes! My five minutes aren’t up!” Steve growled back, knocking back the guards converging on him. Stark was going back on their plan because he’d gotten
There were hands grabbing at Steve again, tearing at his sleeves, and seizing his arms. Steve pushed back, fighting to stay upright and keep Stark in his sights.
Choking on his water, Steve coughed, banged a fist against his chest a few times, and finally spluttered, “Sorry,
Tony had no idea how long ago it had been that there’d been enough of a lull in the fight for him to reach for the band on his wrist and call the ironman suit. Hopefully long enough ago to give the suit time to reach him before he shattered his bones on a stalagmite.
Right, Hubert Brandt. Steve had cornered that warmongering bastard in his laboratory of twisted experiments. He remembered Brandt’s final “hail hydra” gargled through the frothy cyanide burst from a capsule lodged in his teeth. But more so, Steve remembered the clattering of a dropped tray behind him and turning to see a thin boy staring on in horror. “Papa?” the boy had asked. He remembered the tremor in the boy’s voice as clear as the clanging of a bell. Between sobs, the boy had screamed something at him in German, and all Steve had been able to do was desperately shake his head. Maybe he could’ve done more, maybe even cobbled together a semi-coherent response with the elementary level German he knew at the time, but then the turret of a tank had blasted through the wall. By the time the dust had cleared, the boy had disappeared, and that was the last Steve had seen of the Brandts.
Apparently Samson hadn’t mentally prepared enough for Captain America and Ironman strolling into the room, and throughout his rundown of the mission, he was incessantly either readjusting his glasses or shuffling papers. But despite Samson’s nerves and how horribly distracting Stark’s slowly drying hair curling over his forehead was, Steve managed to grasp most of the information.
Until now. Honestly, Steve had more than once caught himself absently wondering where the descendants of the people he’d known had ended up. On lonelier nights, he’d even wished he might find the guts to introduce himself someday. This wasn’t exactly what he’d had in mind.
He rolled his shoulders and straightened up a bit. “Annoyed, actually. Not at you. At other things. People. A person. Shouldn’t be, though, not after they... I shouldn’t do a lot of things, but that never stops me.”
“My hands, Stark,” Rogers said, thrusting them in Tony’s face. “You think I smashed them to bits on a nonexistent wall?”
Falling sideways and hitting the wall hard, Steve fought to keep his eyes open against the fierce pain screaming through his body. He had a target to keep in his sights. But, his vision had gone blurry, and the wind ripping through the ship and blasting his face really wasn’t helping.
“I must say I’m shocked to find you alive, sir,” JARVIS commented dryly in his ear. It was the AI’s subdued way of scolding Tony for running off.
He didn’t know where he was going. He didn’t even know where he currently was. Was he even still in Greenland anymore? Yeah, the hallways looked similar enough. Maybe he could locate a control room or hack into their security footage and go from there. All he really knew was somebody had “plans” for Captain America, and Tony wasn’t gonna let that fly.
“Ah, ah, ah,” the man waggled a finger at him. “If I don’t want you off that couch, you can’t get off that couch. You might think there’s nothing holding you down, but all the same, it’s quite impossible for you to stand. So long as you are under my employ, Stark, you will be completely incapable of any harmful move against me.”
Bruised and bloodstained, a man was indeed inside. He was dangling over the hole on a metal handle, adorned in a battered navy blue uniform, and staring down at Tony with azure blue eyes and a shock of blonde hair that had been blown in all directions.
Steve moved on to hunt through the next laboratory, listening with bated breath for word from Stark. He was halfway through the contents of a filing cabinet when Stark finally spoke up again.
Clint had just rounded out his vehement defense of a snack-food called “Pringles,” and for a few seconds they chewed their slices of oozing cheesy goodness in silence.
“Uh huh, just like you would love a long dinner conversation with Justin Hammer.” She crossed her arms with a smug smile.
Clint launched into an animated defense that had both Steve and Romanoff snorting with laughter as he claimed responsibilities like catching the marathon of a series of movies Steve had now heard of often, called Star Wars, was reason enough to be late to briefings. And once it came out that Steve hadn’t yet seen Star Wars, Clint started on a rundown of the basics of the franchise. But, after Clint and Romanoff got involved in a debate over the best ‘lightsaber,’ Steve couldn’t really follow and found himself only half listening.
“Uh hey,” Steve said, turning toward Stark. Way to go, Rogers. Real smooth. Wait no. That was a perfectly acceptable greeting. He wasn’t trying to flirt with the guy. He needed to calm down.
Right as Steve opened his mouth to ask just that, the distant crunch of snow under a mass of boots reached his ears along with the humming of charged air. Steve rushed to the open gates of the courtyard and stared out across the barren expanse to see Stark zipping around and haphazardly blasting the western patrol.
He was dejectedly counting the speckles on the ceiling tile above his head when he was startled by the sound of something small and plastic landing in the trash can beside his bed. He looked down to see scarlet hair lady, finished with her yogurt and reclining on the bed next to his.
been dead. It made sense they’d collect his things and put them in exhibitions. Exhibitions that preached what a legend Captain America had been and cranked the demand for him to plaster on that all-smiles persona up to a hundred. Yeah, that part made mingling with people nowadays… difficult. More than that, though, the childish part of Steve (which, some would argue, was a dominant part) just wanted his stuff back. Not even just to have (though the comfort of his old coats and pencils would be appreciated), just to get it off display. God, it really did make his skin crawl. This Captain America gig just kept finding new ways to freak him out.
“Bullshit,” Tony spat. JARVIS took the liberty of raising a repulsor to the man’s face, and that helped loosen his tongue.
“Right, right,” Tony yawned. “Well, tell Fury I don’t work for him. Especially not at two in the morning.”
Suddenly, the sun was flashing in his eyes again, flashing off of something. Something metal and obnoxiously red.
“I knew he was famous for that ironman suit, but I had no idea he got this much publicity,” Steve said, frowning at the rude snapshots.
“Sorry, I’ll have JARVIS restock our ice cream stores. Billionaire, remember? I’ll get you all the moose tracks you could want,” Tony laughed. He eyed the strands of hair spilling out of Pepper’s bun and the pinched look on her face. “Ice cream before dinner, Miss Potts? One of those days, huh?”
Romanoff gave Clint a shove. “And yet, here I am still friends with you when just today you misplaced the harddrive we’d been tracking down for a week, among other complications to just that one mission.”
After slapping a generous tip on the tabletop, Clint led them out of the stuffy heat of the restaurant. They meandered down a few streets until coming to a stop at the crumbling steps of an apartment building. Clint offered Steve his couch for the night, and maybe ten minutes ago Steve would have accepted. But guilt was churning in his head now, and Steve already knew he wouldn’t be getting any sleep. So, he thanked Clint and Romanoff for the fun and set off to board the subway.
Climbing the stairs back into the city, Steve shrunk into his jacket as not only the chill of the night but of that reminder from Stark sunk into him.
“They didn’t believe you were essential to the vision, but I’d read your papers. I’d studied your work like religion,” the man whispered, appallingly fervent. “I knew you’d be an asset unlike any other, that you’d bring forth machines capable of unfathomable devastation. With you on our side, we could purge the earth of its wretched impurities with ease. The boss said all I had to do was get him the Captain, and I could have you to myself.”
And, Pepper still knew when something was eating at Tony. She walked over and leaned against the fridge Tony was glaring at.
He still reeked of the cologne Pepper had drenched him in earlier that same night after dragging him out of his workshop, forcing him into a suit, and pulling him into a limousine bound for the high class hotel where the gala she claimed he’d agreed to was being held. The smell really wasn’t helping his headache. Neither had the gala.
Sticking out of the sea of black uniforms, there was a pale face atop broad, navy blue shoulders. Tony knew that face. Huh. It was Captain America, come to rescue him. How nice. He looked nice. There was snow in his hair, and his cheeks were tinged pink from the cold. Cute. And his eyes were fixed on Tony’s with burning intensity. Tony couldn’t help the stupid smile that spread on his face.
Steve squirmed against the sheets at Tony’s words, his back trying to arch off the bed, but Tony let more of his weight to his hands to keep him down. The alpha’s whole demeanor was starting to remind that of a wild animal as he pounded into Steve’s heat, his grip nearly bruising where he held Steve in place. Not that Steve was going anywhere; his noises were getting louder and louder, Tony’s knot already swelling inside of him.
Steve stirs a little as Tony strokes his chest, and when Tony presses a kiss to his back, Steve’s arm moves indulgently to allow more room for Tony’s touches, his hips pushing back towards Tony’s hard cock. It’s a pretty clear invitation, and still aware of their limited time, Tony lets his hand travel lower to palm Steve’s ass, earning a little hum from his omega. Pliantly, Steve leans forward to bare himself, and with a satisfied growl Tony slips his hand to Steve’s crack, the side of his palm sliding against the wetness as he cups Steve’s ass cheek. There’s so, so much slick, and Tony has to bring his hand to his lips to taste it.
”Yes, it’s a defence mechanism. You know this”, Tony answers. ”Now you’re thinking: ’next he’s gonna tell me he likes that loud music they call rock or stone or something like that’.”
He tries to rationalise and think, forcing air in through his nose and out through his mouth. Who could help him? If he has to have an alpha with him, he’d rather it’d be someone he knows. But like omegas, alphas are quite rare. Who does he even know that is still alive?
The boys actually get along – despite his teasing Emmett tends to take on a bit of a protective role with Kieran, as he is practically four months older now because of the Blip. He has inherited Tony’s quick mouth, but Kieran is the one who is Tony’s kid through and through; he’d sleep in the workshop if he were allowed. Well, about 97 percent Tony’s kid; when a bee stings him or play gets too rough, he’s usually quick to run into the safety of Steve’s arms. Emmett, on the other hand, seems to like stealing moments with just his oma and him, often appearing to help Steve with chores without asking or sneaking into the room while Steve works or draws, where he just sits on the floor quietly playing a game or reading a book.
Tony gives him a few generous licks, then sucks again, harshly enough to make a loud noise and Steve is nothing but the sensation of that and his burning cheeks (up
Tony continues to massage his lower back, and slowly but surely, he’s starting to melt Steve. Sure, Steve’s cock is still desperately hard underneath him, but he’s not thinking about it. He’s just lying there, feeling all of the pleasure but ignoring how it prompts his body to react. It’s almost meditative, in an ecstatic sort of way.
Steve understood Tony’s frustration – anyone would’ve felt that in his situation, and Tony wasn’t exactly the most patient person to begin with.
Tony had sipped his coffee again. He had been wanting to ask since he’d come back, but he hadn’t been sure if he could bear listening to the answer. Yet he had felt like he had to know.
Steve can feel Tony’s breath in his ear, and his legs are already ready to give in. What Tony says next surely doesn’t help.
He’d made sure Tony’s helmet was closed and hit his chest with electricity to practically force his heart to keep going. Everything had gone white for a blink, and then Tony had fallen into his arms.
”Is it a commitment issue? Because if it is, I think we need to talk about it”, Steve continues, trying his best to sound amenable even though he feels hurt when he thinks about Tony not wanting to commit to him.
”No”, Tony answered, swallowing and smiling with unfocused eyes. ”Just get your dick inside me, please.”
He’s going to have to have find one himself, Steve thinks, as he steps out of the ship not more than thirty minutes later. It feels like they’ve been gone for a long time, but they’d left in the morning and it isn’t even dark yet. Steve eyes the windows of the compound as he walks towards it in the last warm rays of the sun, trying to catch Tony watching them return in one of them. He doesn’t notice him, but some windows catch the sunlight so brightly that Steve can’t be sure if Tony’s in one of them or not.
”Show me your wrists”, Tony says, and Steve’s heart flutters as Tony takes his wrists and quickly observes them for any marks. Then he snaps his fingers, pointing towards the floor.
And Steve would’ve had to, would’ve been forced to find a way to go on living because he was a parent. But no matter how much he loved their children, he knew that he would’ve never been the same anymore without Tony.
Tony snorts. Steve has realised that Tony isn’t driving towards home a while ago. He doesn’t really care – he had wanted to go home, but right now he feels like he could sit in the car for hours, not talking, just driving around. It’s just good to be near Tony, even if he is still a little pissed.
Tony hums, then gets up. He crouches down in front of Steve’s face, placing a hand on his shoulder. Steve glances at him, then looks away. For a while Tony just studies him, rubbing his shoulder.
Early morning, not more than two days later, the universe is set on a course that will lead to the end of the world as they know it.
”Mine”, Tony hissed, his balance tipping a little as Steve suddenly lifted his leg. In a quick motion, Tony fixed it by pulling the leg against his chest and lifting the calf to rest over his shoulder, and Steve wailed as Tony’s cock sank deeper into him.
Steve pulls his hair as a particularly harsh cramp rattles his insides. He grimaces in pain, squeezing the sheets with his knuckles white, then lets out a roar of frustration and anger. The haze that had dulled the ache is gone now, and his mind and body are in total conflict with each other. His body demands attention, continuing to slick itself for knotting, but what Steve wants in his mind is to die. The only thing they agree on is that he needs Tony to be alive and here.
”God, I miss them already”, he confesses after a moment. Tony kisses Steve’s jawline, breathes into his ear in a way that makes Steve’s skin tingle.
Seemed he wouldn’t have to wait for long, because Steve pressed his body firmly against him, including his cock that Tony could feel hard against his ass. Steve’s capability to grow an erection in approximately two seconds at the mere mention of sex never ceased to amaze Tony. The corner of his mouth twitched, and he ground his hips against Steve lazily. A couple of kisses were planted across Tony’s neck, a hand gripping his hip promisingly.
He’d been so hopeful after they’d found out where to find Thanos. The stones would be with him, and in them, the key to bringing his child back. To bringing everybody back. But the stones are gone, and it gives him no satisfaction to know that so is Thanos. Giving up never was in Steve’s nature, but how can he not admit it; this is it, isn’t it? There’s nothing they can do.
Tony recognized that there was an attempt, but Steve’s answer didn’t quite qualify as words. From what he could deduce, it had little to do with anything except for one thing, and Tony needed Steve to focus out of that for a second so that he could change their position and then give Steve what he needed.
When Steve shows up on his - their - doorstep, silent and his head bowed down, it’s way too soon. Too soon after his betrayal - that’s what Tony calls it, because that’s what it is -, too soon for the anger to have begun to wear, too soon for the wound to have had enough time to start healing. But what is Tony going to do, slam the door shut to the face of the omega he's bonded to, denying him the shelter of their shared home?
”Well”, he begun, pausing to solve his throat. ”You were coming and going, but you were being pretty… affectionate towards me, and at some point, when I was sitting talking to Nat, you sat on my lap and told me that you wanted me to ’milk you till you were desperate’ and ’pin you down and fuck your brains out’. You said other things, but that was the gist of it.”
Tony doesn’t praise him, just dips one finger into him, luring more slick out of him. He fucks him with his finger a couple of times, then stops with the finger still inside. Steve starts to push against it, but halts when Tony yanks his wrists.
He does, he knows. Steve doesn’t know how he’d live with himself if he’d do something like that, but his mind is simply so over-charged that it’s just going over every worst-case scenario. He looks at the contract again.
His baby. Steve’s eyes, his hair. Little fingers and toes. None of those things show in the picture, but Tony can see them anyway, feel exactly how much Kieran had weighed in his arms. So little.
”Are you sure I won’t hurt you? I don’t want to make it worse”, Tony says honestly, feeling like side-stepping the issue won’t do any good right now. He understands if Steve feels difficult talking about this, but it’s just them and Tony has to know the truth.
”Everything okay?” Tony asks, and Steve nods, crooking his knee up suggestively. His mouth parts expectantly as Tony takes the hint and moves his hand lower, brushing his knuckles against his balls lightly. But there’s something else in Steve’s expression, some kind of pain that isn’t physical. Like he wants to share something but doesn’t know how to say it. Tony knows too well how that feels.
Steve’s not sure how and if this is going to work. He’s friendly with Thor, would call the man his friend  even, but definitely not like he’s – was – friends with Bucky or even Sam. Thor has always felt too different from them to get close to, too distant and busy with the problems of his own world. It isn’t like Steve is the easiest person to really get to know himself.
”I’m so sorry”, Steve cries. The emotions are just pouring out of him now, everything he’s been through coming out in such frantic, hopeless noises that he can hardly draw a breath in between. But he’s not really crying for what he’s been through – he’s crying for everything he’s lost. He misses his child so much. ”I think I made a mistake, Tony.”
His hand halts as his eyes fix on an ultrasound picture that’s hanging on the fridge door. It’s crushing how masterfully Tony has already learned not to notice it and the other pictures.
He considers it. He thinks about kissing Steve, about touching him, about knotting him, and how all of those thoughts make him feel. He searches for the anger, the hurt that would taint it, but doesn’t find it. It’s odd, surprising but unbelievably relieving. Exciting. Tony’s stomach turns expectantly, his brow furrowing as he resumes his work on the onions.
It feels wrong on so many levels. It feels wrong to indulge in something so carnal so soon after his loss. Feels wrong to be alone. Wrong for his body to act this way when Tony’s not here.
He wasn’t angry at Tony for almost sacrificing himself. Their family, the entire existence, had been at stake and Tony had gotten the opportunity to save everyone. He was angry at the universe for once again making it be Tony in the first place, the one person Steve couldn’t live without.
Steve frowns. Therapy. He knows it’s not a taboo anymore, that even a lot of completely functional people benefit from it and that many, in fact, practically consider it a privilege nowadays. But the word still evokes a negative response in him, his lips pressing into a tight line.
They stare at each other until Tony finally rests his forehead against Steve’s chin. ”That place smells like your distress. I think my reptilian brain got confused.”
Steve rested his head carefully onto Tony’s chest, planting a few kisses onto his skin first. Tony’s fingers came down to play with his hair lazily.
”I managed to regain consciousness, but I knew I didn’t have much time, so I called for Thor and I asked him to help me. To… knot me.”
It had taken even more time for him to learn that Steve actually never forgot anyone. And that meant literally anyone. Every single person he’d lost, he remembered by the name, remembered the way they went, remembered the last thing they’d said to him, no matter how brief their presence had been in his life.
Steve nods with a small tremor, kissing Tony’s temple, and Tony spits onto his hand unceremoniously, wiping it onto their cocks for lubrication before resuming his strokes. He starts kissing Steve’s neck, teasing the skin with his teeth but not biting down, and he can feel Steve tensing, feel him yearn for the bite. But Tony keeps his kisses soft and his strokes feverish until Steve is trembling and whimpers needily.
That’s not what really worries him though – it’s the exact opposite that he’s bothered by. Life is still a thing and Tony functions in it seemingly effortlessly. He handles business, he does his part with Emmett, he’s there for Steve when he’s needed. The only thing he doesn’t really deal that well with is Steve’s sickness, but then Steve does make it practically impossible to do that. After the one time in the shower, the week Tony came back, their sex life has effectively moved to the state of non-existence. They’re intimate in other ways, perhaps more than ever, but it just doesn’t translate into sex. All of their energy is spent on just pulling through one day after the other, and there’s none left to work on such an issue. They’re comfortable just as long as neither of them tries to talk about it – which Tony has done and has also stopped doing after Steve outright told him to do so.
The sound that leaves Tony is something between a gasp and a groan. Steve begins to move his hips tenderly, his teeth marking Tony for himself – his alpha, so handsome and powerful, so gentle and loving and his only. Tony’s moans fill his ears, he can hear his blood running fast, feel his cock pulsing inside of him as he starts to move his hips a little faster –
Then, without warning, Tony wraps his hands around the collars of Steve’s dress shirt and yanks roughly, ripping the fabric slightly to expose more skin. Steve lets out an amused noise that quickly turns into a moan as Tony sinks his teeth into his neck, holding him in place by his shoulders. The bite is perfect, not too soft but sweet enough to make Steve slick instantly.
It’s Emmett who notices it first. Steve’s just changing him, his back turned to the window, when Emmett starts to flail his arm with curious eyes, his fingers pointing outside. The bright lights must’ve caught his interest, Steve deduces later. But now, he just chuckles at Emmett’s behaviour.
That’s about it, Steve realises numbly. There isn’t anyone. He’s going to have to trust himself to a stranger or risk orphaning his child, and the latter he isn’t going to do.
”He was here with Happy and Emmy. I… when I saw what happened to Bucky and the others, I called Happy. He was crying when he answered. I could hear Emmett crying in the background, too, and I… knew.”
Hearing this, Steve’s pretty sure he can feel his cock escape the tiny underwear he’s wearing, finally growing too large for it. But he uses all of his might to ignore it, tries to relax like Tony has told him to.
”I missed you”, Steve says, his voice almost as pained as Tony feels. ”Andmoreagain came from the radio and it made me… I couldn’t help it, okay?” he snaps, and it’s easy to tell he’s trying not to cry again.
And although it had been a huge relief to get Tony breathing on his own again and hear him talk, getting off the machine hadn’t been the end of Tony’s horrors. He had continued to have nightmares, his stressed crying often waking Steve up and making him rush to remind Tony that he was okay, that he could breathe now.
“Tell me what you want”, Tony told him, his voice low and dirty and Steve just grinded his ass against him helplessly, moaning.
Steve then picked up his pace a bit, and he tried to not keep thinking about the fact of how close to losing Tony he had come. The worst part was that they weren’t in safe waters yet; they had no idea how much radiation Tony had been exposed to exactly and what the consequences to his health would be in the long term. It felt unfair to have to keep living in fear – they had struggled and fought for so long already.
Shaking himself out of his head, Steve tried to concentrate on how good Tony felt, how soothing his scent was and how warm his body was against him. He showered Tony’s neck with a series of little kisses, then pressed his nose into his hair. It still smelled clean after Steve had washed it this morning.
Tony doesn’t hear his own words as he watches how Steve’s pleasure unravels, how his back arches and his eyes become frail and wet again. His omega’s loud moans fill Tony’s ears, his cock throbbing at the sight. It seems to go on and on, and Tony’s completely lost in it until his own release hits him suddenly and he lunges to bite Steve’s neck hard, pounding into him like an animal and whimpering through his own orgasm in just as exposed manner as Steve. Steve’s hands wrap around him and keep him close through it.
”Uncle Bucky and Aunt Nat will pick you up after school”, he rehearses with them. ”You’ll behave, right? And that goes for when you see Peter and the others on Saturday, too.”
”Did you want more kids?” Tony asks with a gentler tone, wondering if Steve’s only mourning the possibility or something more, like a dream. They’d never discussed having more, but that’s expected since they have only just had their first.
“You’re here”, he says, trying to hide his sourness. He can understand wanting some time apart after everything that’s happened, but after the message on Saturday night, Tony hasn’t answered a single one of Steve’s texts, never-mind the few times he has tried to call. Even the gift stopped feeling good after Steve realised Tony wasn’t going to answer his thank you -message, or the picture of Emmett and Kieran sleeping nose to nose he sent, or any one of his attempts at contact. By Monday he’d gotten the message Tony didn’t have to send, and stopped trying.
Oh. Oh no. If the way his heart melted from nothing but a smile was any indication, he was fucked. Get a grip, Rogers, you’ve got a mission to get to.
“The pain’ll probably come swinging back in any moment now!” Tony exclaimed, grimacing at the blistered and torn skin. “And, I don’t know too much about super soldiers, but I’d think, serum or not, you can’t afford to lose
“Okay,” Pepper said, standing. “So, it’s a no to the chicken noodle soup. We can just order takeout. How’s Thai food sound?”
For a while Rogers just sat in the grass, evidently thoroughly shaken. Tony had just come back to his senses enough to think to offer some kind of comfort when the other man abruptly slumped forward with a long sigh, relief apparently washing over him.
Upon hearing that, Barton eased up considerably. “Oh thank god,” he breathed. “Because I mean, maybe Tasha could take you, but me? Yeah, no. Not that there’s any reason for you to take us on. We’re not committing any crimes, I promise!” Barton threw up his hands defensively, palms forward.
Suddenly aware he was practically dragging Stark along and surprised by the hitch in Stark’s voice, Steve released him immediately.
By the time Steve dragged his feet over the threshold of his apartment, he decided he couldn’t spend the whole night festering in self-loathing if he hoped to get up for work tomorrow. Because that’s what he was here for: to work. Kicking off his shoes, he hobbled into the living room and collapsed face-first onto the couch. Hoping to buoy his thoughts out of self-pity, he gingerly picked up the remote control from the coffee table where it was gathering dust. Hadn’t Clint mentioned something about a good comedy playing on a channel called “abc”?
“Thought I’d lost you, buddy,” he whispered before grimacing. He was talking to a metal disk. He seriously needed actual friends.
“Yep, I’m very aware of those,” Tony groaned. “And as overjoyed as I am to have you with me, J, would you mind keeping quiet for a bit? My head… I’ve got this headache. Can hardly think with it stabbing into my brain.”
“A terrific plan, sir,” JARVIS replied, and the suit launched forward, seizing the man by his arms and crushing him into the wall.
Pepper pulled out her phone to place the order but paused, looking at Tony with concern in her eyes. Tony turned away and fixed his gaze on the cheesy magnets stuck on the refrigerator. He used to wake up to a new reminder tucked under one of those magnets almost everyday, even though Pepper could’ve easily asked JARVIS to relay the message. She’d known Tony liked the visible evidence that other people were around.
When Stark kept on fighting, seemingly oblivious to the ground readying to fall away from beneath his feet, Steve, in desperation, hurled his shield over there. It only knocked off two of the guards swinging at Stark before it disappeared into the abyss. But, it had caught Stark’s attention.
Tony was readying to swiftly shut him down (phrases like “purge the earth” and “have you to myself” almost never boded well) until he mentioned “the Captain.” That could only mean Rogers. So, he bit his tongue and let the man divulge more.
After Greenland, Tony had thrown himself into making it up to Pepper for all the headaches he caused her (namely, that speech he’d ditched and press conferences he’d stumbled in late to or missed altogether). Stark Industries was Pepper’s now, but Tony was still involved. So, he’d attended board meetings, tuned in for conference calls, and schmoozed at every stuffy dinner that came his way. He’d even sent a box of bagels (the woman considered donuts to be sugary abominations) to Pepper’s office although at the last second he’d replaced the cream cheese with a strawberry-flavored brand.
But hey, he still had his shield, and for that he was eternally grateful. Through every gunfight and storming of a Hydra stronghold, it had protected him. It had been with him when he’d nosedived into the arctic, and so it had come with him into this new century. It was a familiar weight in his hands in an unfamiliar world. So yeah, Steve had reason to treasure the thing.
“Rogers, this is Tony Stark. You’ve been alive in this century long enough to have heard about Iron Man. Stark, this is Steve Rogers. Yes, Captain America lives. Broke him out of the ice three months ago, and that’s all you need to know,” Fury rattled off. “You two will be partnering this mission, and I expect your best effort to work as a cohesive unit. Learn each other’s strengths and needs in the field. In briefing room 400, Agent Samson will fill you in on what shit you’ll be taking on today. The world council is convening in ten minutes, and I need to get my ass down there to take their call. So, I do not have the time for any grievances against this pairing or the hour of day I have called you in. You will work together, and you will work together well. Is that understood?”
And that was all Tony was going to get because now there were bullets pinging off the back of his armor. It didn’t take very long for Tony to down the horde of guards once he noticed whatever force had been controlling him earlier was gone and he’d regained autonomy. But in all the smoke of the fight, the man who had been terrorizing Tony only a minute ago had taken off. Cursing, Tony rose the suit into the air and rocketed out of the room and down the hall.
Steve needed to focus. He was making his way over the craggy foothills of the mountains, and slipping would probably hurt. Stark was reluctantly waiting in the valley behind him for Steve’s word (After a heated argument, Stark had sourly agreed that he shouldn’t be firing the suit’s repulsors when he was still quite drunk). Once Steve reached the base’s west side and cleared it of guards, Stark would fly in, and they’d enter together. The guards had to be taken out quickly and quietly, which was why SHIELD had asked for Steve. A full-frontal attack on the place would have risked the weapon being set off right then and there.
As repugnant as one-on-one dinner with Hammer would be, Tony could still be grateful that dreading the occasion would take his mind off that other unpleasant experience. He was a futurist afterall. Better to focus on the oncoming trouble than to bemoan past mistakes with a man who was a relic of the past himself and nauseatingly patriotic and prim and self-important and maddeningly-
There was nothing but the rustling of grass for a bit longer until eventually Rogers smoothed a hand over his hair, stood up with a grunt, and walked up to Tony holding out a bloodied hand.
Alright then. There wasn’t any reservoir of radiation gearing up to blow sky high. That was good. Fucking great. Steve could’ve spent his day snuggled up in his warm bed, but instead he’d been tramping through the freezing cold labs of what very well could be nothing but a harmless research facility with an overabundance of security to deter foreign interference and with an interest in Hydra aeronautics, which yeah, that was fair. As much as Steve reviled them, Hydra had been upsettingly competent when it came to planes. Steve should know, afterall, he-
Before he knew what he was doing, Steve was down the stairs in three bounds and slamming his way through to Stark. He didn’t get very far before he was greeted by a spray of bullets, which he lifted his shield to deflect but ultimately slowed him down anyway as a few stray shells grazed his legs. He hadn’t thought they’d use their guns when the space was so crowded that they ended up hitting their own.
Rogers let his hand fall from where it was pushing through his wet hair, and he reciprocated the murderous glare Tony was sending his way.
“If you seriously think you’re going to be storming a base while still half-frozen, you really are full of yourself, Rogers. You can’t even walk.” Tony shook his head incredulously.
heartlessly murder his own father before his very eyes. You stole his father away, and he burned to get you back.”
“Thank you,” Steve took the shield from him and gave him a genuine smile of gratitude. Barton smiled back, and Steve was brave enough to think he might be forging the beginnings of some sort of human connection when his stomach gave a monstrous growl and broke the moment.
“Well, I hope you take my advice this time and refrain from leaving the suit again. Your body temperature is frighteningly low, and you’ve suffered far too many blows.”
“How long have you given me?” Steve mumbled, crouching behind a tall rock and eying the base’s first watchtower thirty feet ahead.
The train slowed to a stop, and Steve rubbed at his eyes. How had he spent the entire train ride bemoaning Tony Stark?
Earlier that morning, after JARVIS had informed him that the AI had made a breakthrough in their investigations into an underground nazi organization with an obsession with killing innocents in the most gruesome, downright blood-curdling ways, Tony had leapt into his Ironman armor and blasted off to down the creepy fuckers. Normally, Tony wouldn’t ever consider leaving his bed before noon after a long night in the workshop. He also normally wouldn’t really jump to offing people. But, god, would he make an exception for these bastards. The footage he’d uncovered of some of their intimidation tactics of state officials had been plaguing his nightmares for the past month. Plus, it was without a doubt one of the heads of this nazi group that would be on board this ship and no one else, meaning there weren’t going to be any lackeys of debatable devotion caught in the crossfire.
“Better bundle up, Cap. We wouldn’t want that handsome face getting frostbite,” Stark had drunkenly giggled when he threw the scarf at Steve. “I found a blue one. It’ll bring out your eyes.”
The entire cage was falling, swallowed whole by darkness. For a few seconds, they tumbled through the dark until with a monstrous splash, they hit water.
“JARVIS, buddy, god I’ve missed you, and I love you. I’m currently… let’s call it ‘indisposed.’ Uh, can’t really throw any punches of my own, so I’m gonna need you to engage offensive maneuver 2C to take this fucker down for me. Sound like a plan?”
memory lane) were balanced on his bedside table, and Steve might’ve occupied himself with them if he had functioning fingers. As it was, his only accessible entertainment was the hum of conversation in the room, but after an agent hissed to his friend who was complaining loudly about her girlfriend, “Lower your voice, Captain America’s
“Not that this hasn’t all been riveting beyond belief, but my ride’s here,” Tony grinned as the suit wrapped around him.
Tony was roused by something puncturing his left forearm. At first there was nothing except the pressure of whatever was piercing through his skin, but that only lasted a few blissful seconds before the pain of all the other injuries riddling his body came slamming into him like a semi truck. He groaned.
“Was in the middle of finally apprehending the guy when the ship we were on gets blasted out of the sky. Ironman caught me before I hit the ground, though, so I guess I got a bit of a ride.”
Apparently annoyed that Steve wasn’t cowering in fear, Brandt spoke up again, “Here comes your nightmare, Captain, tailored perfectly for you.”
”I know”, Steve stopped Tony’s reassuring, light voice, but couldn’t stop his own from turning brittle. ”I know.”
”Think about it once more. If your alpha is still alive, I’m sure he’ll appreciate more finding out that you’ve been with another than finding you dead when he comes back.”
”But you’re mine, so I don’t care”, Tony answered jovially. ”Besides, I can always buy you a thousand new ones.”
”We will be all right, won’t we, Tony?” Steve says after a moment. It’s more a statement than a question. Tony kisses his hair, his palm pressed over Steve’s stomach protectively.
”Can I –” she pauses. Steve tries to see her expression in the darkness, but she turns her face away. Steve waits as she seems to collect herself before looking at him again. ”Do you think I could sleep with you and Emmy tonight?”
Still, they were both more or less damaged, but that didn’t have to mean that they couldn’t comfort each other intimately.
“Look”, Tony prompts, his voice hardly audible. “This is my favourite part. The point where you’re clearly starting to lose your composition, but you’re still trying so hard to keep yourself in control.”
Steve’s eyes follow the direction of Tony’s finger, but all his mind can concentrate on is the warmth he can feel radiating from Tony. When he turns his eyes to him, he’s a little startled to see Tony watching him with a thoughtful expression on his face. Steve draws a timid breath, trying his best to smile.
Steve finds Tony stuck on his computer, writing code so fast that even with his enhanced senses Steve is having trouble keeping up. He’s not here to read code, though.
”Not that it’s any of my business”, Pepper continues, knitting her brows. ”Rhodey just mentioned that Steve was really sick. I wanted to come visit him but Rhodey said that it wasn’t possible.”
Tony notices that it’s worse than they thought at first, too, but he seems to think it has to do with tiredness and tries to fix it by taking care of the babies for the majority of the time. He also hires help to be there when he can’t.
”That doesn’t sound promising”, he mutters apprehensively, his insides twisting into a nervous knot. Everything has been going so well.
”I know, sweetheart. I want to be inside you so bad”, he breathes in a low whisper. Tony knows dirty talk works on Steve like magic, so perhaps voicing his own need might make Steve relax and his body more pliant, make things move on quicker. He licks Steve’s neck, ghosting the skin with his teeth, then breathes into his ear. ”I want to bury my cock in you. Want to see you squirm and moan around it. I’ve missed it.”
Steve doesn’t see that coming, but he knows instantly that Tony’s talking about the therapy again. His first reaction is anger. Then he thinks about how much he needs this.
Later, when he’s cooled off a little, Tony acknowledges that it isn’t exactly wrong of Steve to want closeness. Or sex. They’d been amazing at sex. But Tony also knows he’s not there yet and pressuring really won’t get him there quicker.
”In Germany”, Steve finishes for him, holding onto his smile. The situation must be at least confusing if not curious for the young man, Kieran’s persistent crying in the background certainly not helping. ”You were really impressive.”
”Oh?” Tony couldn’t believe Steve actually sounded surprised. ”Oh, good. I mean, after what you said last night I thought, well, to deliver. I was honestly a little worried of being so… aggressive because of my powers, but –”
