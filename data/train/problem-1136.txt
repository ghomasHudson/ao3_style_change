He took out his phone, the only personal possession he had been allowed to keep, and sent a text to Sherlock.
John gave Sherlock a few minutes before he stood from the bed and walked into the bathroom, glad that Sherlock had left the door unlocked and partially open. He sat on the edge of the tub, reaching down and gently combing through the curls at the nape of Sherlock's neck. "You're alright, love," he promised, easily able to tell how distraught he was. "You don't need to avoid me."
John wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist, pulling him close and tucking the Omega's head under his chin. "I'm coming back," he promised, reaching up to comb his finger through Sherlock's hair. "I'll be back in time for your twenty-sixth birthday, and then we can go away to the cabin for as long as you want. Screw the world and responsibilities; it'll just be us, okay?"
John checked Sherlock's temperature again, flinching when he realised how high it was. "Oh? That so?" He pushed Sherlock's curls back from his forehead, blowing cool air across his feverish skin. "What point is that?"
Sherlock nodded with a wince, walking alongside John. He let out a breath, bumping his shoulder with John a little. "We could just stay in tomorrow," he offered, hissing a little at another kick. "Order some duck?" he asked with a small smile, looking at John.
He sighed, looking through Katherine's bag again to make sure she had everything. A week... a whole week they would be gone, and Sherlock still felt anxious about it. Katherine was excited now though, still wanting to make her 'ging-bread' house.
John had released at nearly the same time Sherlock had, buried deep in the Omega and unable to pull out. He nuzzled against Sherlock's neck, panting just as hard as he was.
Sherlock leant towards the bedroom door. "John... clothes, now. We've got a crime scene, seeing as you don't want to do nothing," he said.
John laughed, long and hard, nearly doubling over with his forehead resting against Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock was pacing the bathroom, his arms wrapped around himself. He looked over at John when he came in and shook his head, still pacing. "Nothing... I'm fine," he mumbled, his arms still wrapped around himself. "You know... I did that... I made her afraid that you'll leave. That I'll leave, and never come back," he said, his eyes stinging. "I made her afraid," he said. "I made you afraid," he added softly.
"So demanding," John murmured, biting down on Sherlock's shoulder before he quickly lined up and thrust into him. He growled, wasting no time in setting up a fast, snapping rhythm. He was already exhausted, not used to going three rounds, but it would be worth it. "God, Sherlock, fuck," he groaned, holding on tightly to the back of his thigh.
marks...this one...wasn't that. He whined a little, leaning back against John a bit, still wanting them back, but it was slightly less noticeable now, getting replaced by something else.
"I missed this place," John whispered, his eyes following people as they moved down the pavement, staring inside of shop windows and then moving on.
Harry smirked. "Well get used to that, chances are little miss soft-spoken won't always be that way," she said, sitting at the foot of the bed. Sherlock shifted a little, stirring but not waking. Katherine cooed lightly, stuffing her mitt covered hand in her mouth, gumming it a little.
"I give up," John murmured, almost forty minutes later. He tossed the book onto the floor, lying down behind Sherlock and nuzzling up against him. "I know you're not asleep, you know. I'm not completely incompetent. Your pulse was pretty evident in your neck," he whispered, kissing the particular spot on the Omega's neck. "I'm sorry for distracting you from sleep." He ran his fingers lightly over Sherlock's chest, tracing his fingertips between Sherlock's ribs and humming gently.
John leant over against Sherlock, wanting and needing to have contact with him. "Oh, I'm sure Mycroft would have a few good stories to tell," John commented, leaning more against Sherlock for a moment. He was tired, god, he was tired. Emotionally drained and physically spent. He wanted to go home, stand in the shower and have a good breakdown, and then spend the rest of his night cuddling with Sherlock.
John had lain down while Sherlock was calling, and now he rolled over to curl up against him. He rested his hand lightly over Sherlock's bump, running his thumb over it. "Thanks," he murmured, kissing above Sherlock's collar. "You're lucky this isn't something contagious, or I'd be sleeping on the couch and would make you stay away from me."
John sighed lightly, chuckling at Sherlock's defensiveness. "She probably isn't wrong about you, whether you want to admit it or not."
John watched Sherlock leave, standing there for a moment before walking after Kat and into the living room, smiling a little at Harry, who was sitting in one of the chairs. "Hey, sis."
"I'll kill him then, too," John replied, resting his hand gently over Sherlock's. "He's not going to separate us, love. Not if I can help it." He kissed Sherlock's forehead, holding his lips there for a long moment. "We'll be fine," he promised, tightening his arms around Sherlock's waist.
I'm sorry, love. God, I don't want to go. I'm so pissed off, and I won't be able to talk to you until I get back, and I don't know how ling that's going to take. Take care of yourself, alright, and if I miss the baby being born... send an email anyway. I want to see how delirious you are on the day he's born. Take a video if you can so that I can hear his lungs.
Dr. Chase flipped through John's charts when addressed with Sherlock's question. "If he was going to be monitored at home by a doctor, I would say that he could leave anywhere between one and two months," he said, looking up from the clipboard and handing it over to Sherlock. "Look," he whispered, keeping the conversation away from Katherine, "he's putting on a brave face, but he's suffering. Anyone who can live through what he went through is a strong S.O.B., but his body can only take so much. I can't let him go home until I'm sure that his body is healed to a certain point."
"Alright, both of you deep breaths," she ordered gently, moving over towards the wailing infant. "I know you just had your temp taken love, but I've got to check too," she said, pulling off Katherine's bottoms. She did that quickly, much to the distaste of the infant. She ran a check over her, looking at her belly button, and checking her ears.
John jumped out of bed instantly, walking over to Katherine and leading her into the bathroom. "You're alright, baby," he said softly, positioning her in front of the toilet and slowly stripping her out of the pyjamas. "Next time you feel sick, do it in there, alright? I'm going to go get the thermometer."
John smiled softly. "Don't look at your feet," he instructed, setting his hand at Sherlock's waist and grabbing Sherlock's hand with his other. "Watch me, and focus on the music. What is it telling you to do?" He took a step into another move, and Sherlock followed--a little clumsily, but still.
Sherlock nodded a little. "Yes... I know," he said softly. But then who was going to protect John? He couldn't tell John's mother about Moriarty. Or how he'd tried to kill John just so he could take Sherlock.
Sherlock took the towel, draping it around himself. He dried off most of the way, moving over to the toilet and sitting down for a little bit. He leant back against that, closing his eyes, just resting them.
Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes a little. Once she was old enough to know what not to put in her mouth he would re-evaluate the conversation.
He paused, looking down at the figure at his feet, a blond man lying face down, his hand loosely pressed over a wound in his side. A moment later Sherlock knelt down, easing the man onto his back.
"Don't be ridiculous," John chided softly. "You're hurting, and I can handle sleeping on the couch. There's a room upstairs that I can add on to the rent for myself once you're better, but until then I don't want to be out of earshot." He moved his hands to cup Sherlock's neck, tipping his chin up with his thumbs. "Lie back down, please."
John couldn't answer for a long while, trying to stop his panic attack before it fully set in. "They're making me go back," he said, after nearly five minutes had passed. "They're calling me back to service." He clung to Sherlock's shirt, more tears falling from his eyes as he buried his face in Sherlock's shoulder.
John jumped out of the black car as soon as they reached his flat, but he didn't make it terribly far before he started swaying. He saw a figure come out from the alley and he froze, holding his breath as he waited.
It took John a solid five minutes to come back, and when he did, he pulled out of Sherlock's grasp, panting and staring at him. He swallowed before curling back up against him, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist and holding him close. "I don't know... what's triggering this," he said between dry sobs, his shoulders shaking. "I just want it to stop."
... know how to. So I made do," Sherlock said. "I admit there was a moment when I..." he rubbed his arms gently. "Did a bit not good," he said quietly. "But I worked with what I had after that place... and then after you," he said, eyes on the floor. He forced himself to stay numb, not wanting to come close to losing, or appear he was going to while still in the hospital.
"Yeah, he's a bit coltish, but I can't blame him for it." He wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist when he came in, pinning his sister with a look.
John groaned a little, walking over to the other swing and dropping down on it. "Sherlock, I don't want to do anything, really. I don't want to make a big deal out of it, I don't want there to be a big fuss." He sighed, pushing back a bit and letting himself swing forward the tiny amount his kick had made. "It's not a big deal, it's just a birthday. If I'm with you, I'm happy. That's it, that's all I want."
Sherlock took a break from the sandwich and took the water, drinking down half the glass. He swallowed, glancing over at John. The corner of his mouth quirked up as he felt John's fingers trace up him.
Sherlock glanced over at John as he was sent a message on his phone. He rolled his eyes as well. "Judging from your response, I take it you are now privy to the world that is Mycroft's unreasonably large nose. And his constant 'worry'," Sherlock said quietly, looking out the window.
After all, no promises had been made. John had already saved Sherlock's life; he didn't owe any more than that. And yet, John leaving still stung. "At this juncture, though, I do not want pups, no," he confirmed.
I cannot stress again how much I want you to stay safe. Quiet is good...but I don't like the lockdown thing. Can't they just send someone else in to help?
John gave Sherlock a slightly horrified look, standing up and peering inside the fridge. "Sherlock? What the hell?" he demanded, holding up the bag of thumbs and shaking them at the Omega. "Why?"
Sherlock smiled, tilting his head up to look at John. "I know you'll be busy... but I can't help but wonder what it is I should do with everything," he murmured quietly.
"Mmm... no..." Sherlock breathed, pulling his eyes open. "I just... fuck me, I... Christ," he breathed, still not able to move much. He reached up one heavy arm and weaved his fingers into John's hair a couple times before letting it fall listlessly back to the bed.
"That your way of saying 'thank you'?" John asked, keeping himself close to Sherlock and closing his eyes, a soft breath escaping him.
"Shh, easy, love," John murmured, holding Sherlock close. He turned so that he was leaning against the cabinet under the sink and pulled Sherlock easily onto his lap, cradling him against his chest. "You're alright. Deep breaths, and keep them slow," he said quietly, running his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "Try to match my breaths and pulse."
Sherlock nodded, walking into the living room and sitting down in his chair. He sighed, fiddling with his fingers, running them along the faint scars on his wrists from the ropes almost a year ago. After a moment he sighed, getting up and climbing onto John's lap again without permission, feeling like he was sliding into place. He sighed, closing his eyes as he relaxed marginally. "I did... haven't heard anything yet. I'll know either way when he does," he murmured.
Sherlock lifted his head up from where he'd been leaning on his hand. He blinked a few times, looking after John. He got up and walked into the kitchen, leaning on the table. "You should make a small bit extra," he murmured, sitting down.
John took his time, ignoring Sherlock's lifted hips. He pressed his mouth everywhere, using his tongue to run soothing lines over milky skin, then nipping it to put him on edge. He ran his hands over Sherlock's thighs, kneading them gently and gradually spreading them as John sunk lower.
Sherlock moved into the bedroom when he was cleaned off, not even noticing that he was still undressed – it was too warm for clothes anyway. He sat down and lifted one of the sandwiches, tearing into it, not sure where the appetite came from.
The female Beta nurse looked up at Sherlock with slightly wide eyes, taking in his appearance. "Your mate's name?" she asked, immediately searching when she was told. "It appears that he's in surgery at the moment. It's not listed what for, but they've only been in there for fifteen minutes. Must have been a rush, though, if the doctor just claimed the OR with a patient's name." She looked up sympathetically at Sherlock. "Would you like to look at his charts while you wait?" she offered.
A moment later Sherlock stood, lifting the man up and quickly flitting home to his flat, entering it just as the sun started to rise. He carried him into his bedroom and set him on the bed. He stepped into the bathroom and grabbed a cloth, wetting it down.
, he thought to himself. "Christ," he breathed, "how much did you give me?" He rolled onto his side to get more comfortable, facing Sherlock as he quickly fell into a deep, bottomless sleep.
John looked up at Sherlock, holding onto Kat as she clung to him. He was glad Sherlock had said it, fairly sure that it would be a good distraction for Katherine, at least for a short while. He nodded at Sherlock, lifting the corner of his mouth into a small smile as Kat turned around to look at her daddy.
Sherlock was still shaking, and he shut his eyes to avoid looking at John's. They were dead; there was no one to say anything to. He could tell John wouldn't give this up though, and he nodded shakily. "F-fine... n-no lunch then. Have it... y-your way," he said shakily. He looked down, starting to move his feet a bit down the path, his arms wrapped around himself.
John shook his head, leaning into Sherlock's touch. "No, I'm just the opposite. Except for the occasional yelling, everything that's happening is just happening to me. I'm closing myself off instead of letting it out, but I'm not making that decision consciously. It's just... happening." He sighed, lifting up Hamish so that he was "standing" on the bed, keeping a steady grip on him as he bounced himself.
“For example, if you had chosen to take a cab ride home from your therapy appointment during your first few days back in London from Afghanistan, you would not have run into Mike in the park, therefore missing the opportunity to meet Sherlock at that point. Thus, your timeline would have altered slightly and you would have eventually met Sherlock at the bank unless another choice would deter the course of your meeting.”
and that he would be with him within hours, according to Destiny. John’s breath hitched in his throat at the thought. He was going to see Sherlock again, alive and well. He was going to resolve cases with Sherlock again. The thought had John’s heart racing and he suddenly felt giddy and excited for the first time in six months. He laid back down, turning on his side, and shut his eyes. He wanted to be well-rested even though his body felt like running a mile.
They talked quietly with one another, mostly about the day, and when John was going back to work. It wasn’t long until Mrs. Hudson heard her landline ringing downstairs and she rushed off to answer it, leaving John alone upstairs once more.
Mrs. Hudson nodded curtly and went back into her flat as John headed up the stairs to his own. He stopped in the doorway of the common area, his eyes locking onto the black leather chair that sat, empty, across from his own. John’s small smile fell. There was still so much stuff that reminded him of Sherlock, but there was no way he could bring himself to throw or donate any of it even though Mrs. Hudson had brought it up a few times. John inhaled shakily and sat in his own chair, staring at the empty one across from him.
The woman smiled, suddenly seeming a lot wiser in his mind’s eye and a lot older, but not in age. John shifted in his chair. He suddenly wished he had something to distract him from the impending thought that he was currently sitting in his ‘mind palace’ or ‘mind flat’ as she had called it.
“Yes, I remember.” John tapped the arm of his chair, swallowing thickly, “The media called it a suicide pact.” He clenched one of his fists at the anger flaring in his chest.
“What the hell.” He murmured to no one and threw the covers off himself before stalking down the stairs and back into the common area. He switched on the light, his eyes immediately locking onto the black card that sat on the table next to his chair and lamp. John grabbed the card and his mobile phone. An uneasy feeling settled itself into his stomach as he stared at the card. What had she meant? How was there a way to save Sherlock? It was bugging him.
Bring Sherlock back? Was she mad? It was impossible. Sherlock was dead. Nothing was going to change that fact. John shook his head and sent Lestrade a quick text before he called it a night. He switched off the lights and telly in the common area and headed for the stairs leading up to his bedroom before stopping briefly to stare at the closed door down the hall. Sherlock’s room. John’s gaze fell as he ascended the stairs.
There was a coffee shop nearby called the Criterion that John ended up taking the woman to. As she stood at the counter and ordered her drink of choice, John studied her from the corner of his eye. He seriously had never seen someone like her before. There was
“I’ve been able to pinpoint that the variable which tampered with Sherlock’s fate must have taken place somewhere in the six months leading up to that moment on the rooftop.”
“Sherlock,” John whispered in disbelief under his breath. He felt his breath quicken and without another thought, John rushed over to Sherlock and thrust his hands out toward the man to grab hold of him and never let him go. However, that didn’t happen. John’s hands shot straight through Sherlock’s form as if John, himself, were a ghost. Horrified, he ripped his hands back as if burned.
John’s head was spinning with so much information. He still couldn’t grasp that this was even happening and that it was all real. Sending him back in time? Like time traveling? John briefly wondered about all the movies that involved time travel and if any of them were factual. Probably not, was his guess.
When she finished, she stood up straight and stepped up to John. She was only slightly shorter than him, but in her heels, she reached about his height. She looked into his eyes as if searching for something. Doubt maybe? Second thoughts? Well, she wouldn’t find any. Seeming satisfied, she reached her hand up and lightly touched his forehead.
The woman didn’t give him a time that she said she would be coming to meet with him, so he slowly rose out of the bed, leaving the violin case open and exiting the room, rubbing his eyes. He was thankful no one would know he had slept in his dead flatmate's bed. It was an accident, but John found he was able to sleep through the entire night for once. He didn’t want to dwell on it too much, so he distracted himself by making a pot of tea.
Thank you to everyone who has left a comment or kudos and has told me they liked my little idea of a story. I super appreciate it and it encourages me to write.
A light came on behind the woman’s eyes; she looked to him. “John Watson. Yes, now I remember. You write a blog about that consulting detective, oh!” She smiled, but then it quickly faltered and she glanced away with a look in her eyes. “I’m sorry-”
“Because Sherlock’s destiny was not fulfilled. His fate was not to jump from the roof of Barts and die.”
John felt like breaking down. His world shattered. His bottom lip quivered and he cleared his throat, not knowing what to feel at the moment. Sherlock was
John’s phone buzzed on the small table next to his chair, catching his attention. He got up and grabbed it. Lestrade had texted him about possibly going out later that week to the pub. John was about to respond when his eyes caught sight of the black card with the white numbers on it. He stared at it, thinking back on the woman he met in the park and the strange atmosphere that surrounded her.
“Yes, well…” John started to say but didn’t exactly know what he was going to say to this woman, “What you said...yesterday...about...Sherlock…”
I do not own Sherlock, all rights are reserved for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and BBC. This work is for entertainment purposes only.
Lestrade clenched his fists for a second, “Can you believe the media was calling it a suicide pact between that manic and Sherlock? Makes me sick.”
They haunted him, made him rethink everything about his flatmate and the man he came to believe was the most incredible person he would ever come across. He often found himself rethinking the many cases they solved and trying to figure out how Sherlock would have even faked any of it. He always concluded that it was not fake. It wasn’t a
John did as he was told and, shortly after, he felt the cool touch of her fingertips to his forehead, and then there was that loud ringing noise in his ears along with the dizzy feeling and then it was suddenly gone in a flash. John opened his eyes to see Destiny standing in front of him. He was in his chair like before. He blinked rapidly at the bright light streaming in through the curtains of the common area.
Was this a dream? John wondered once more. He prayed and hoped this was not a dream. He had a chance to bring Sherlock back? To save him? To be by his side again? Destiny released her light grip from his shoulder and took a few steps back.
“Right.” He mumbled. That did make perfect sense, “So, how am I supposed to figure it out if you can’t, Miss Being of Destiny?”
John felt the touch of Destiny’s fingertips at the center of his forehead and in the next moment, he felt the sensation of himself falling. His eyes flew open, but all he saw was a blur of moments that looked like memories. John’s limbs flailed around him as if he were trying to pull himself up above the surface of water except he kept falling. His body spun backward and his mind whirled. He couldn’t focus on a single thing. The images blurred and flew past him. There were bright lights and colors that attacked his vision and he felt his body fall into a sensation that felt like a tank of water. John gasped as he floated, spun, and, quite literally, fell through time.
anything at all to have him back.” John’s voice was rough with emotion, his blurred eyes never leaving Sherlock’s form by the table.
are you?” He whispered quietly, trying to control his breathing. It hadn’t occurred to John that he had never asked the woman her name.
Did he? John wondered, but didn’t voice it. There was another brief silence between them, letting the information sink in. John’s heart was still thudding heavily.
going to bring him back. No amount of what-ifs are going to change what he did. He’s dead. He’s gone and he is not coming back.” John’s voice started to rise toward the end of his sentence. His breathing grew rough, affected by his own words. He never acknowledged the fact that Sherlock was truly dead until that moment and that nothing was going to change that fact. He felt on the verge of tears, his face flush with more emotion than he wanted this woman to see.
“No, no that was my bad. I wasn’t paying attention either.” She chuckled softly as she slowly took her bag back, “Thank you um…”
Then there were nights that John talked to Sherlock. Many nights. He didn’t know if Sherlock would ever actually hear what he was saying as John wasn’t even sure of an afterlife, but he did it nonetheless. He would tell Sherlock about what was going on at Scotland Yard and sometimes even about his day. On his particularly low nights, John would tell Sherlock all the things he wished he could have told him when he was alive. He tells him how much he missed him and how much Sherlock meant to him. Most of all, John tells Sherlock just how much he had impacted his life and how Sherlock had
The woman, however, didn’t seem affected by his words. “You’re John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusilier. You fought in Afghanistan for three years before you were wounded and were sent home to London. You had a psychosomatic limp until you met Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes changed your life and ever since his death you have not been the same. You drift through day-to-day life trying to figure out what you’re going to do without him by your side. You will never solve crimes together again, you will never hear the screech of his violin or witness the brilliance behind his eyes as he solves a case-”
. He had to see if it was real. John opened his door and struggled down the steps to the common area. The violin grew louder as well as John’s heart thudding like a drum in his ears. His mouth was dry and in dire need of a drink, but he didn’t care.
“Why didn’t you just talk to me?” John questioned, his voice soft and on the verge of cracking, “We...we could have worked something out...I mean…” and then his voice would trail off and tears would slip down his cheeks. John never thought he would cry so much in his life than he had in the past six months.
John promised himself that he would never again doubt who Sherlock was and his intelligent mind. He would never again question if it was all fake because it wasn’t. He just simply would not believe that
“Morning, John.” Sherlock’s deep baritone voice struck a chord in John and he felt tears prick his eyes. “John?” There was confusion and perhaps a hint of concern in that deep voice following after his morning greeting, but John couldn’t tell because it was only a matter of seconds until he realized something was acutely wrong with him. Probably another side-effect, he knew, but it was all too much. John’s vision wavered as Sherlock’s figure blurred and suddenly he was tipping sideways, falling to the floor.
he did it?” John surprised himself with his question, not knowing why he asked it. Destiny seemed caught off guard by it as well. Despite it being whispered, it seemed loud in the quiet upstairs bedroom.
“Greg, I don’t know why Sherlock jumped off that roof, but” John swallowed thickly, “I do know that it isn’t your fault. Moriarty was...toying with us and...I guess he got to Sherlock somehow…”
John blinked, his gaze shifting to Memory Sherlock once more. The memory he was witnessing seemed so long ago. The ‘Memory John’ standing across from him didn’t even feel like him, but a completely different person than who he was now. This ‘memory John’ had no idea what kind of pain he was in for, what kind of grief. John resisted a shiver that traveled down his spine.
“I know.” John spoke softly, “I...feel the same. I...find myself waiting for him to come home sometimes…”
“John,” Lestrade started again, “It isn’t your fault either. We don’t know why he did it and I’m afraid we never will, but…” He trailed off again.
John looked from her hand to her face. Of course, he wanted to bring Sherlock back, but what exactly was he getting himself into? Time-travel? He shook the thoughts away. He was agreeing to help bring Sherlock back and that is all that mattered. If he succeeded, he’d have his best friend back. The thought gave him the feeling of determination surging through him; he stood as well and grasped Destiny’s hand.
“Good, you’re awake. Are you ready?” It was Destiny. She looked the same as when she left so many hours ago. John blinked the sleep away from his eyes, his brain slowly catching up and realizing everything had, much to his joy, not been a dream.
“I never believed it.” She said out-of-the-blue. John gave her a questioning glance. “I never believed all that stuff the media said about him. That it was fake. That he was a fraud and that it was all staged.”
Destiny gave him a level stare, “Here is how it will go,” She started, “You, as you are now, will remain. When I send you back, you will be the John Watson in that timeline, but with knowledge of the current John Watson that you are at this moment.”
we succeed, it will also bring back a rather unpleasant character along with Sherlock. One that has lingered in the shadows since the very moment you met Sherlock.”
John watched as Destiny descended the stairs until he heard the click of 221B’s door shut, leaving him in a quiet flat that left a strange atmosphere around him. He felt jittery. If everything Destiny told him was true, he should probably try and get some shut-eye now. As he headed for the stairs that ascended to his room, he paused in the doorway, looking down the hallway at the cracked open door of Sherlock’s room again. John felt his chest tighten and he hurried up the stairs to his bedroom where he shut the door and leaned against it, exhaling a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. He started laughing breathily. He must be crazy. Did any of that even happen or did he hallucinate it?
“Oh...yes we were close. Best friends actually, although I don’t think he realized that sometimes.” John chuckled sadly. The woman smiled warmly as she sipped her coffee, her cherry red lips leaving a stain on the rim of the lid.
A woman had stumbled backward with the collision as well causing her to drop her bag she’d been holding as well as a cup of coffee that went spilling across the pavement.
John nodded, it made a little more sense, but it still made his head hurt thinking about it. This itself was insane.
“Why…?” John questioned, quietly, his voice just barely above a whisper. He found he was afraid to hear the answer. Destiny stared at him for a solid moment, searching his eyes once more.
“Me?” John couldn’t fathom what was happening. What could he possibly do to help her? How had he gone from bumping into this woman to finding out she was Destiny itself? John’s head spun.
The woman couldn’t help but smile before her expression turned serious again, “It means,” She paused, “No matter where you were in your life, you were destined to meet Sherlock at some point in time.”
There was a loud ringing sound in his ears all of a sudden and a nauseating, dizzy feeling that overtook him for the briefest of moments before it was suddenly gone and the touch of the woman’s fingers vanished from his forehead.
He was dreaming. He had to be dreaming. That, or he slipped and fell, cracked his head open on a rock somewhere and was currently dying. This wasn’t possible. How could this be possible?
He frowned when he remembered the card in his pocket and reached for it. When he pulled it out, he gave it a once over. The card was solid black with just a mobile phone number typed neatly in white on it.
That caught John’s attention and he finally pulled his gaze from Memory Sherlock and to the woman and her strange eyes. “I still don’t understand.” He repeated.
“Oh God yes.” John admitted, his vision blurring with the tears, “I miss him so damn much. I would do...
The woman smiled and it was interesting because John could have sworn he saw a glint in her eye that he couldn’t quite place, but perhaps it was the trick of the light. She held her hand out for him to shake, “It’s nice to meet you, John Watson.”
John looked up just as Memory Sherlock passed through his form and grabbed his familiar blue scarf, wrapping it around his neck and saying something about having left his riding crop in the morgue. The scene eventually faded, as it was the end of the memory it seemed and the woman led him through another door.
She was here in the flesh and she is going to send him back in time to save Sherlock from death’s grip despite how crazy it all seemed. Feeling another sense of determination and also feeling a bit dazed from the events that happened since he left his therapy session yesterday, he pulled his jacket off and kicked his shoes off before getting under the sheets of his bed and staring up at the ceiling.
His therapist cocked her head at him and shifted in her seat. She doesn’t have any particular look on her face, so John feels a little bit at ease.
John watched the memory scene of Sherlock deducing him right before his eyes. John hadn’t thought of it as Sherlock trying to impress him before. He shook the thought away and ignored her question and instead asked, “But...why? What is the meaning behind all this? Why are you showing me this? How are you showing me this? How do you know all this?”
“Mostly about my day. Sometimes about a murder or crime committed that is reported in the paper. I ask him how fast he thinks he could solve it if he were here. Of course, he doesn’t respond,” John clarifies, just-in-case, his therapist was on the verge of prescribing pills for him to take.
"I don't want to be alone if I have to have it but at the same time, though, it's mostly what I'll want at the time. I don't want..." Sherlock trailed off. "There's not many Alpha's that could help themselves around that," he said quietly.
Sherlock opened his mouth to ask how exactly he accomplished that when he looked down at saw John asleep. He let out a breath rather than his question and leant against the sofa, reaching down to comb idly through John's hair in thought. He sighed, looking around the flat. His pocket vibrated and he tugged out his phone, looking at the message.
Sherlock looked up when a doctor came to get them, quickly shoving the changing pad into the bag and lifting it onto his shoulder, Hamish still feeding himself contentedly. He followed them down the hall, seeing Katherine's red rimmed eyes over John's shoulder, staring at the wall as they walked down the hall. His poor girl...it was one thing for an adult to witness such things, scarring if in excess which was the case for John. But there is a difference between the two. What can scar an adult...can inflict damage onto a child.
Harry smiled. "Thanks brother. Just make sure you come round more. I want to be able to see my niece or nephew," she said, taking up a couple mugs.
"S'not fair..." Sherlock mumbled drowsily. "I came home....and you saw, every scar...every mark." He thought about the brand on his shoulder that he'd turned into his mate's initials. His eyes pulled closed and he nuzzled against John's chest, not wanting to fall asleep, but not able to help it either.
John hugged her back tightly. "It's alright, Harry, it's alright," he murmured, his hands knotting in her shirt. "It's not your fault; I didn't want you to know. I didn't want anyone to know. I went through it, it happened, and I didn't want to drag anyone into it." He took a breath, stepping back with his hands tight on her shoulders. "I love you, sis. Don't let this eat at you."
"Your thanks is not needed; my actions were all for my brother's sake. Though, as I know I will get no such thanks from him, yours will suffice," Mycroft said. "I realise, John, that you have been to hell and back, as the phrase goes, but my brother... well, hell is a place with which it seems he is content to stay. A lot has happened," he said. "I'm not sure how much you know, since the last correspondence I carried from my brother to have sent directly to you was before your disappearance."
John sighed lightly, reaching up to comb through Sherlock's hair. "Alright, love. We can go home." He squeezed Sherlock's hand, turning around and leading him back toward the flat.
"I pick-pocket everyone," Sherlock murmured. "And you needed sleep." He sighed, sitting up. "I'll go get them," he said, sliding off of the bed and moving out to get John's coat. He fished out a bottle of pills, quickly walking back to the bedroom and tossing them to John.
"Yeah, she... well, I've never seen her sad or unhappy in any way. She's very excited about her job, which actually worries me a little." John smiled over at Sherlock, squeezing his hand tightly. "She's nice though. She's been a good friend to me."
It wasn't enough, Sherlock still had that horrible empty sensation that almost ached just below his belly button. He whined, squirming a little as John continued his movements. He felt even more sensitive now though, and moaned with each one, his fingers balled up into the bedding as he tugged. "John....I...please..." he begged.
"Um... dunno where else I'd go... not back...." Sherlock said, shaking his head a little. He swallowed, pulling his hand loose and reaching out for the bottle of water still there, thirsty again.
"God, you're gorgeous," John murmured, completely taken by the sight of Sherlock spread out before him, the black lines still circling his eyes and making them so much more intense. He stood up, quickly stripping off his clothes, and then just stood there for a moment, studying Sherlock from the top of his head to his toes.
John didn't protest, not wanting to force Sherlock to do something that he wouldn't want. He locked their legs together, pressing Sherlock against him until there wasn't any part of his Omega that he couldn't feel. He buried his face in Sherlock's hair, breathing him in in slow gulps on air, trying not to waste any time, and trying not to waste any breath.
John smiled to himself, straightening up when he had the medicine in his hands. He walked into the bathroom, getting a glass of water and then returning to Sherlock, handing him the glass and then two of the light pink pills. "Well, that's going to be something I have to teach you while we're here, isn't it?" he asked. "Can't have you stumbling when we dance at our wedding." He winked, perching himself on the bed beside Sherlock.
John took the boxes from Angelo when he brought them, smiling his thanks. "I wasn't quiet. Harry was, though. She was always smiling and happy, and I was most often fussy or upset about something. Ironically, we swapped out personalities at about five years old."
John made a small noise, hungrily kissing Sherlock back. He moved his hands down the Omega's sides and purposefully over his stomach, smiling against his mouth as he quickly worked the button and zip loose on his trousers. He left Sherlock's lips, trailing kisses down his neck and over his collarbone to his chest as he pushed his clothes off.
John parted his eyelids, rubbing at them groggily. "Sherlock?" he asked, pushing himself up, instantly awake when he saw the concern on his mate's face. "Is everything alright?"
Sherlock let out a breath, shaking his head. "They'll find more doctors..." he said, knowing it wouldn't change anything.  "You need to come back." he said, holding close to John. "I want my John...I'm tired of being away from you, I've only had you back for ten months," he said quietly.
I will add it into the tags, but slight trigger warning for this chapter for suicidal/self harm thoughts, as well as blood.
to throw up, but there just wasn't enough in his stomach. "Uhm..." he rested his forehead on the edge of the toilet seat, "I don't know."
“I imagine he would,” Sherlock responded. “That was their purpose for having you and the others there. The word you are looking for already exists though you may not be happy in hearing it,” Sherlock said, leaning back in his chair.
She sighed, seemingly satisfied with that answer as she snuggled in between them more. She exhaled softly, shutting her eyes and starting to doze. Sherlock did the same.
Sherlock glanced over at John, who of course was awake, and had followed him out into the living room. Well at least they both weren't getting sleep because of this. Though John always seemed fine during the day. But then, he had gotten used to going without sleep. Sherlock was used to it too, only as it turned out, growing a person took a lot of energy.
John walked into the kitchen, popping some bread in the toaster and putting the kettle on. "You're eating, by the way," he said over his shoulder as he dug the butter and jam out of the fridge. "Pregnant people don't really have a say in the matter," he jibed gently, walking over and nudging his side. "And I know you don't want to go to the hospital, but I can't do it, and neither can you, so we need some help."
"You're going to be alright now," John promised quietly, leaning up to kiss the Omega's forehead before settling back down in the chair.
Sherlock smiled, nuzzling gently against John. "Yes, you are. We're having a night in," he murmured quietly. "Maybe not what the doctor ordered, but it's what I've ordered," he said, pressing a small kiss to the corner of John's mouth. He let out a breath, his eyes shut as he relaxed against him. "Won't always be like this," he said. "I promise..." he murmured.
Sherlock hummed again, smiling a little. "I wish there was more than one, that way I could keep you here," he said quietly. "I want to give you everything you want...but I have a good feeling about him," he murmured softly. "And he won't even be that old when you come back...seven months, it's not too bad. "You won't be missing as much as I did. You'll get all the firsts...words, steps, hair trim. Probably will just miss the first couple teeth, but those aren't too big of milestones."
Sherlock hummed as he was lifted up, settling down onto John's lap, his legs hanging over the armrest of the chair.
Sherlock leant into the touch on his head. He pressed back carefully into the kiss, brushing his nose against John's. "It's okay. Sounds worse than it is, and really it could stand for anything. Harrison & Co., an H just between my shoulder blades," he said. He tried to make light of it a little, letting out a sigh. “I could just tattoo a J and a W on either side of it," he offered quietly. "’m yours after all. JHW," he said, kissing John's face with each letter.
Sherlock turned to look at the light outside the window, noting the time. He looked at John. "You didn't have to stay awake the whole time," he murmured, sliding off of John's lap and stretching out his limbs a little. He strode over to his violin. "Been a minute since I tended to it... I'll follow along in a little bit," he said, looking back towards John.
Sherlock shoved down any reaction, though he couldn't relax entirely. "Numbers three, four, and seven are not involved, you put them there to make sure I wasn't pointing fingers needlessly," he said. "One, Five, and Six were the main handlers, others came and went, but they were in charge of us mostly. Number Two..."
Sherlock sighed a little, nodding. "I would have before... but they wouldn't let me past the gate security," he murmured quietly, thinking back to watching John walk away at the airport, not fully knowing if he'd come back. He did come back though, and that was the most important thing.
John grinned with pleasure at having pulled the yelp from Sherlock. He nipped at Sherlock's ear, wrapping an arm around his chest to hold them close. He pounded into Sherlock, knowing he was hitting his prostate on nearly every thrust. Sherlock shook beneath him, making small submissive sounds that John's Alpha reacted to, reaching under him and slowly stroking his length. John pressed his forehead between Sherlock's shoulder blades, feeling his knot swelling already.
John smiled, kissing the top of Katherine's head. "That's my girl," he murmured, rubbing her back. He looked back up at Sherlock, reaching over and closing his fingers around his hand. "Everyone asked why I didn't change her last name to Watson. I couldn't, I just couldn't." He slid over on the bed a little, moving Katherine with him and leaning lightly against Sherlock's shoulder. "Don't leave me again," he whispered.
She nodded, "Yes red," She said, looking between the two of them. She stroked them both, but they felt different from each other, making the choice harder. She sniffed, "Dark," She said. "Goes with Daddy's coat," she said, grabbing hold of the scarf with a grin. She walked up and hugged tightly onto John’s leg. "Where taking to dinner?" she asked.
"Sherlock mentioned an accident, yes? Well as it happens I was in it as well, and was currently getting surgery at the time, so forgive me for not jumping up at the moment. As for our parents well, they were a bit hands off anyway, but it seems they
John stroked Sherlock's back slowly and soothingly, kissing the top of his head. "You're alright, love. I'm not going to leave, and I'm not going to sleep." He nuzzled into Sherlock's hair, breathing in his rich scent. "I wanna be here if you need me." He slowly moved his fingers in circles over his shoulder, before he finally just pressed his hand between his shoulder blades and held it there.
John nuzzled into Sherlock's neck, playfully nipping at one of his tendons. "We'll get to that eventually," he murmured, licking and kissing along Sherlock's pale skin. He pressed his hand against Sherlock's chest, lightly running his fingers over one of Sherlock's nipples. He gave a kiss to Sherlock's temple, twining their legs together as they waited for his knot to recede.
John nodded, not wanting to let Sherlock go, but he knew he would return. He loosened his hold, closing his eyes and placing his hand over the bandage on his stomach as Sherlock got out of bed. He wasn't sure how badly he had torn the stitches, but he didn't want Sherlock to worry about him so much.
By the time three twenty rolled around, all John wanted to do was curl up in a little ball and sleep. Instead, he caught a cab to the courthouse, arguing and glaring at everyone who questioned his decision, until finally it was approved. Then, finally, he rode a cab back to the flat.
Sherlock felt his ears burning under his curls. He smiled as Katherine got up and climbed onto Mindy's lap, hugging her. He leant against John and tipped his chin up to kiss him.
Sherlock gasped as they rolled suddenly, and he felt John thrust into him. His eyes rolled back for a moment and he moaned, fists balling up in the bedding. His breathing was erratic, and he swallowed thickly, looking up at John. He knew he'd have to move, he wanted to be John's on the first knot, he wouldn't wait, and that meant John had to be able to reach the back of his neck, as well as the side. But for now pushed himself down more with a whine.
Sherlock stood stunned for a moment before moving over to them, reaching down and pulling the firearm off of the Alpha, and the knife in his boot. He looked down at the sheer amount of blood and knew what would happen. He stood there for a moment, and couldn't find it in himself to have pity for him.
fine, Sherlock," he repeated, getting off of the bed and pacing into the living room. If he had been properly dressed, he would have walked out of the door. He stared around, lost for a moment, before walking over to the window and staring down at the street.
John stretched out his leg, massaging it and wincing when his shoulder pulled, not all of the muscles fully healed. With a small groan, he settled back in the chair and closed his eyes, waiting for Sherlock to resurface.
Katherine had woken up and shot out of bed, getting dressed and even trying to do her own hair, though that didn't go so well. She almost giggled when John met her in the hall. She nodded quickly, snarled hair bouncing a little as she did so. "Ready go now," she said in her covert whisper voice, not wanting to wake Sherlock. "Can get breakfast downstairs?" she asked. She liked the breakfast croissant sandwiches Speedy's had.
The first month was hard, having John so close, and yet still far away. Kept from him at certain times. They worked up a schedule, and it worked, but Sherlock still didn't feel like he really had John back. He saw the improvement though, John's bruises fading, the winces becoming less and less common. Most of his cuts faded and smoothed over, leaving lines in his skin that would fade more over time. Hamish was now three months old, and starting roll over a little from his stomach to his back, and his smiles, he started that at about nine weeks. At this rate he was hoping John could come home in time for Christmas, but he wouldn't ask Dr. Chase about that, he wanted to doctor to say it was okay for John to come home. On Hamish's three month birthday Sherlock returned once more to the hospital, smiling widely as he always did for his John and handed over the infant per protocol before perching on the edge of John's bed.
Sherlock let out a breath, looking at John, watching him throw the blade and hit it dead on. "Mrs. Hudson won't be pleased," he murmured, walking into the living room. "You did, but I don't mind. It's time with you," he said softly, looking at John steadily. He didn't feel sad, or angry, or anything really, he felt quiet...like water after a storm. "You're still good," he murmured.
John shook his head. “That’s impossible,” he said, running his fingers up and down his side. “There’s nothing here,” he said, trying to move towards the edge of the bed and feeling his head go a little light.
John hummed, pleased, and curled up on his side, pillowing his head on his arms. "Wake me if you need anything," he whispered, closing his eyes and quickly falling back asleep.
John smiled, handing their daughter back over to Sherlock. "Yeah, that just happened. Apparently, your brother has a soft spot for pups," he said softly, sitting down on the edge of the bed and stroking Sherlock's hair. He thought about what Mycroft had told him, wondering why he had confided in him.
To Sherlock’s surprise the human nodded, seemingly deep in thought. “And you… you were at that warehouse to put a stop to everything?”
John chuckled softly. "I'll take it. So long as I get to stay as one of those two people forever," he murmured, his voice getting heavier with sleep, though he didn't feel quite ready to drift off yet. "What time is it?" he asked, pulling his arm away from his face and looking up at Sherlock.
John pulled hard at Sherlock's hair, moving his head and exposing his neck. He bit down on a straining tendon, sucking a painful bruise. He sped up his thrusts, pounding hard into Sherlock, taking control, making him his. Sherlock went limp under John when he bit at his neck, vulnerable and exposed, everything he hated when it wasn't John. But it was and he still felt so impossibly safe. He moaned softly, one of his hands slowly reaching towards his length, needing the friction, and he forgot to ask permission. John bit down harder, growling and pounding harder into Sherlock. He tasted blood, suckling on Sherlock's neck and lapping at the pinpricks of blood he had made. He felt his knot swell, pulling harder on Sherlock's hair, his nails digging into Sherlock's hip.
John shook his head, turning back to Lestrade. "Thanks for coming down. I hope you nail those bastards and put the lot of them in jail permanently. Most of the Omegas I saw there were just kids, younger than him."
"It's hard to tell, physically he seems fine though." he said quietly, sipping his tea. He let out a breath at John’s question, looking down at his tea. "I figured if you wanted to discuss it, then you would bring it up. I don't want to upset you," he said softly. "I've been with you long enough; I do have some sense of people skills.”
He opened his eyes from where he was, and saw the angry face of Lestrade. "Been looking for you everywhere!....brother half mad with worry, trying to find J..."
"’m technically not on you though, am I?" Sherlock murmured, polishing off the orange juice and adjusting the bed a bit so he could lie on his side without it being uncomfortable. He rolled onto his left side, draping his arm over John's lap and also bending one leg, resting it over John's as well. "That’s better," he murmured.
Hello, love. Different sort of update today. Bit of adrenaline to mix in with the dull throb that my life has been lately.
Strong kicker. It seemed as if the pup had taken a liking to the title and decided to live up to it as if she'd been christened with the name.
Rubbing his eyes with a heavy sigh, John pushed to his feet, walking into the bedroom and stripping down to his pants, too tired to pull on his pyjamas, before crawling under the covers and curling up behind Sherlock. He was asleep almost instantly, wrapped up in the calm scent of the Omega beside him.
John smiled gently at their daughter, easing her off his lap so he could stand. “Yeah, but it’s alright. We can always watch it another time,” he promised with a kiss to her forehead before he walked into the kitchen. He made a bottle for Hamish and returned to the living room to give it to Sherlock. “I’m going to start on lunch, any requests?” he asked as he smoothed down Katherine’s hair.
John glanced up at Sherlock, putting his food into one of the boxes and placing enough money on the table to cover their meals and a tip. "Yeah, I'm fine," he said, not commenting on anything else. He stood, waited for Sherlock to do the same, and then headed for the door, his box of food in hand. His mind wandered to the question Sherlock had asked him in the cab, and the more he thought about it as they walked, the more concerned he became.
Moriarty would go down, and if he went down with him then... well, they would be safe. He looked over at Katherine, watching her push herself to her feet, looking across the room at them sitting in the chair before thrusting her arms in the air, asking to be picked up, rather than walking or crawling across the room to them. Sherlock smiled a little, remembering asking John to get his phone out of his pocket once. She was like Sherlock then.
Sherlock curled up on his left side, shivering a small bit so he pulled the blankets up over them both, cuddling close to John. "I'm sorry," he murmured. "Have to be on my left; she can breathe better that way. And I like you holding us," he murmured. And it was 'us,’ because where John sometimes put his hand on his hip, he often rested it on Sherlock's belly.
"Best if we go to the hospital," John replied smoothly, making his tone one not to be argued with. It was one of finality. "And you technically don't
“Good…good, John...” Sherlock breathed, relief seeping into his tone. He felt the wound beneath his fingers close slowly, but continued to offer his wrist, staring into the dazed, unfocused eyes that he’d felt so certain he’d never see again.
"Only 'kind of'?" he asked, a humming softly, a moan coming from him when John's hips snapped forward. He moved a little in time with John's motions, the hand on John's slowly guiding it down. He wrapped his fingers, as well as John's, around himself, humming when the Alpha's warm hand took hold of him. "Mm… I know," he murmured with a small smirk, moaning again.
Mycroft nodded. "Yes, an overdose, for which he has only been out of hospital for not even three weeks."
The song that played was one of sharp notes, staccatos rising and falling. It was chaos, and had a nervous edge to it, telling the story of first arriving at that place. It shifted to more of an edgy tone, and Sherlock remembered the anger he'd felt, trying to escape, to fight still. Eventually the tune slowed, long drawn out notes filling the room as Sherlock felt his eyes prick slightly, still keeping them tightly shut, playing through the memories of when he'd started to give up, getting too tired to care, or even being fearful of auction.
, John wanted to say, but he couldn't make his lips move, couldn't get his throat to form the words. He cried harder, shaking his head as he slowly lost control of his body, the drug Sherlock had given him forcing him under. He passed out on Sherlock's shoulder, tears still running down his cheeks.
Sherlock rolled onto his side, still dozing. The hand that had been cradling Katherine flexed, moving a little around as if looking for something. He sat up then, blinking his eyes open and looking around and seeing John holding Katherine. He smiled, settling back down onto the sofa with an almost relieved sigh.
John scoffed at Sherlock's question. "Oh, loads. You know me, total lady's man." He winked at Sherlock, turning to Kat. It felt good to be smiling again. "It's when you like someone a lot, but you don't tell them," he explained, turning back to Sherlock to nuzzle against Sherlock's neck. "Just skip over all of April 2001, alright?" It had been a hard month for him, having lost Harry, and he had considered suicide multiple times. "Probably not how you want to be thinking of me when I'm gone."
John Hamish Watson grew up in what one could call a fairly normal life. His mum and dad meeting in school, marrying a bit out of college. His sister came first, and he followed a couple years after, though growing up he always seemed the older one. Family of four, perfect little unit. Normal. He played rugby, hung out with his mates, got good marks in nearly everything save for Literature, and Maths for a minute as well.
Harry brought Katherine by later that day, and the four-year-old tip toed into the room, obviously having been told to be quiet. Sherlock scooted over on the bed, allowing her to lay next to him. "S'that my brother?" she asked in a low whisper. Sherlock smiled, nodding. Katherine held him for nearly an hour as Sherlock held her with one arm wrapped around her, one hand resting on the swaddled newborn. And yet...his happiness was diminished a bit, tarnished by his mate’s absence. John should be there, at the very least John would and should have written him, with Hamish due around this time...not hearing anything...it made Sherlock feel almost physically sick from worry.
"That's pretty much what I figured," John said, nodding. "Your body went through a trauma, one that's statistically worse than a gunshot wound. So, yeah, I can't really blame them for keeping you." He nuzzled against Sherlock's shoulder, kissing it lightly.
Sherlock let out a breath of relief, closing his eyes a moment. Safe didn't mean unharmed, he knew that. But safe wasn't dead, and it wasn't dying. He could work with safe.
John's heart pained for the young Omega, who was ages old for only nineteen. He dipped his head down, nuzzling Sherlock’s cheek gently and brushing his nose along the length of Sherlock's. "It's alright, love," he murmured, pressing their lips together for a moment. "I know it's hard," he kissed him again, "but you'll get there," another kiss, "eventually. And you don't have to do it alone." He rested their foreheads together, breathing slowly. "Thank you for coming with me."
“Mm…Myc…” Sherlock murmured, his head light. He started to feel cold, lifting an arm that felt like lead to try and pull at his brother’s sleeve. His heart started to slow, and he was so tired… “M’croft…please, he said drowsily.
John nodded, still curled up on the chair. His tears had dried a while ago, but he hadn't been able to force himself to move. He had been watching Sherlock until Maria had come in, and he then watched her. Now he watched her leave, dropping his forehead onto his knees. Her words made him feel a little better, but he wasn't going to get too happy just to be torn down again. He wasn't being pessimistic, he was being... cautious. He sighed wearily, shoulders tense, his left one stinging a little.
Sherlock blinked a few times, looking at John. "I don't... you had the gun. And I'm not going anywhere without you I just... I want to go home," he said. "I want
"I need you to step down for a moment so that I can get these on the rest of the way," John murmured, steadying Sherlock when he complied and quickly pulling the bottoms up to his hips. "Alright, you can sit back down," he said, easing him back onto the mattress and undoing the ties of the hospital gown.
John led the way from the room, vaguely remembering which way they had come from. He wished he was holding Sherlock's hand, but he didn't want to push the Omega, and he certainly didn't blame him for not openly giving contact. Sherlock had been stuck in an auction house for three years.
John nuzzled instinctively against Sherlock's hair, growling a little as the possessive Alpha suddenly rose up in him and took hold. He rolled Sherlock over onto his back, mindful of his side, and braced himself above him, nuzzling and licking and nipping down his neck. "You don't smell like me anymore," he said, his voice a little rough as he bit down over the high mark on the side of Sherlock's neck.
“Because I saw it, but that is neither here nor there.” He brought his hand towards the man’s mouth. If he fought him on it then Sherlock would just glamour him to take it and be on his way, despite not wanting to, it would be done. The man however, though he hesitated, didn’t try to reject the hand, allowing the blood to tip into his mouth, and he swallowed it, wincing a little.
Sherlock blinked a couple times, taking the phone and holding it to his ear. He wondered how it was one was supposed to greet their brother in law... He didn't, and simply reiterated what he'd just rattled off, adding that for where she was found and the method that it was someone she knew, who was angry. And that they probably had the phone still – sentiment.
"I think so..." John sighed, tightening his hold on Sherlock. "I'm not entirely sure what that was," he admitted, kissing Sherlock's shoulder. "Never had that happen before."
John squeezed Sherlock's hand, looking over at their daughter. "Alright baby. How do crackers sound? Maybe with some jam on them?" he asked, gently shifting Sherlock off of his lap and taking Katty's hand as he wandered into the kitchen in search of the food he had suggested.
Sherlock swallowed, hearing the darkness in John's voice, one he himself knew he could possess, all those people he had killed, Moriarty's associates. Perhaps this man was one of them? Had he missed one? Or was this solely about John? "If he goes anywhere near the children, I'll help you," he said quietly, a hint of the same tone. He let out a breath, and nuzzled close to John. "We've talked about it, I know now, so...rest John, please? Let's just sleep, and you can hold me, and we'll just stay here all night. Us."
The man – Sebastian, his mind supplied from somewhere fuzzy – pulled him through an employee door to a loading dock, and that was when John blacked out, slumping in the strong grasp of the other Alpha.
dance though." he said softly. "I think it's overrated anyway. It's just...moving." he said, his hears warm.
Sherlock blinked a few times, wrapping his arms around John more, burying his face in John's neck. He twisted himself around and onto John's lap and wrapped his legs around John's waist, clinging to him. "’m sorry... was being stupid I-I love you," he said quietly, squeezing John tighter, despite the fact that it made his shoulder ache a little.
He just wanted his Alpha back, to hold him again, to feel safe, and to stop fighting. But he'd ruined that. He held his side, reaching over for his still damp and bloodied shirt. "I... I can go," he made himself say. "I understand," he said quietly. "I just... didn't want to lie anymore."
John nuzzled against Sherlock's skin, nosing his way up under his ear. Pressing his lips to the soft patch of skin there, John grazed his teeth gently along it, running his fingers up into Sherlock's hair and just holding them there, dropping his forehead back to Sherlock's shoulder.
and no one else's." He ran his hands up Sherlock's sides and chest, playing with his nipples and then dragging his fingernails back down.
John circled his arms around Sherlock, both to support him and to keep him in place. "It's alright, love," he whispered, pressing a quick kiss to the back of his neck. "Don't back out now. You're here, I'm here, and so are they. Talk to them." He took a step away, giving Sherlock space if he wanted it.
Not clothes, but something Sherlock could wear with it. So it would have to be visible when Sherlock was fully clothed. Nothing permanent, because you don't simply wear piercings or tattoos. Jewellery? But then that begged the question again of his tags – no it was something else...
Sherlock whimpered, moaning as John rand down his torso, the scratches and bites stinging, but reassuring. He nodded, his eyes shutting as he ground upwards again. "Mm...yours, always," he breathed, panting a small bit. "Until you’re back, and every day after that," he said, reaching down to pull John up again to kiss him. He'd stopped crying, knowing he could do this. He would have to, John could last two years without him, and Sherlock would last just over one without John. Then nothing would happen, they would be fine.
John pushed Sherlock down by his shoulders, firmly holding him there. "Sherlock Holmes, if you do not stay seated and let me treat these, so help me, I will walk out of that door and go get the groceries without you." He released Sherlock's shoulders, reaching for the bandages and hoping that he finally got through to him.
Sherlock didn't move from where he was, his nails pressing into his sides as he held his arms in place. He shifted in the tub, and then back again, not able to get comfortable. He groaned, his head smacking the tub as he tried to move again.
Though still not as uncomfortable as he had been at that damn baby shower. Still, it was needed. Now with only a couple weeks left they had everything they needed. The 'nursery' as everyone called it was done, crib and all. They probably had enough clothes until she was three, it felt like. A small cot was in their room, and they had diapers to no end. Sherlock despised the amount of pink, though there were plenty of other colours too, thank god. Some people hearing his protests.
Sherlock looked over John's shoulder at the security. "I can't go any further, can I?" he asked quietly, pulling away a little to look at John.
John sighed, drying off and walking into the bedroom. "You need to eat something," John said quietly, pulling on some pants and a pair of jeans. "Or I won't." He knew it was low, but Sherlock had done the same to him once, so it didn't make him feel as bad.
Sherlock settled close to John, smiling a bit. "If she needs something, I can get it for her," he murmured. "And my side is perfectly fine now." Well... fine enough. "So you are sleeping, until you wake up," he said, kissing John gently.
"Oh, and I'm cutting your hair soon, too," John said, turning to Sherlock. It was just this side of too long, and he was going to fix that.
Sherlock nodded a little. "I know," he murmured, adjusting his head on John's shoulder so he could breathe in his scent a little easier. They stayed like that for a little while before he heard his name called, and he let out a breath. He sat up a little, glancing over at John. "You are coming... and you're not leaving," he said.
John still hated the name, but it sounded good when Sherlock said it like that, his voice quiet and a little drowsy. He smiled a little, rubbing his thumb over Sherlock's stomach, aching for him to already be fully pregnant so that he could be here. "I like Watson with that one," he murmured, kissing Sherlock's lips lightly.
"Love you too," John promised, tipping his head down to steal Sherlock's lips in a kiss, sucking slowly on his tongue. He shivered a little when Sherlock brushed over a sensitive spot on his ribs, a spot he knew was held by a scar that had nerve damage around it. "Easy there," he murmured.
He heard the noise of the auction hall fade away, and shivered a little when a cool breeze brushed past his skin, wearing nothing but a dingy pair of jeans.
John didn't remember the cab ride, nor the walk up the stairs. He wasn't sure how he had gotten in the bedroom, and then he blinked and Sherlock was kissing him. John sighed lightly against Sherlock's lips, kissing him back slowly and tenderly, reaching up to cup Sherlock's neck with one hand, his other resting over his tags on Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock nodded, humming a little as he looked out the window. "Perhaps they don't want to bring it up... figure you'll bring it up when you're ready."
"Mm... not so quiet from where I'm standing," Sherlock murmured. "Hopefully you're right about her... active before being born, quiet after," he said with a sigh. "But I asked you, because the only thing I really want to do is get this pup out of me," he said. "We can go for a walk," he offered, knowing that exercise helped induce. She was so big, surely two weeks left was too long.
John sighed dramatically, leaning back against the seat and stroking through Katherine's hair. "Must you make this so difficult on me?" he teased, reaching over to take Sherlock's hand. He squeezed it, linking their fingers together and rubbing his knuckles with his thumb.
Katherine got dressed nearly by herself, Sherlock making quiet suggestions for what to wear. He did her hair, and Katherine looked up at him, noticing his somewhat shut down expression. "Go play with your dolls," he murmured, kissing her head as he let go of her hand as he turned into the kitchen to start making her some toast and eggs.
They were finally lead to a room and they saw Mindy there laying unconscious, various wires and tubes hooked up to her. Sherlock felt a lump form in his throat and he held onto Hamish tighter. "Why would someone do this?" he said softly. God, was it him? Were they after the kids? Though if they had been, wouldn't they have also...Sherlock shook his head, not wanting to think about that.
He started panicking when the doctor told the nurses to prep him for surgery. What if this was worse than he had thought? What if he died? He knew that was worst-case, but at the same time, his mind wasn't listening. He was having a panic attack on the gurney; something was pushed into his IV line and he almost immediately passed out.
John didn't catch Sherlock's glance, too busy smiling at Kat. Not wanting to deal with unpacking at the moment, he walking over to his chair and sat down, motioning over his shoulder for Sherlock to come join him.
John finally came awake at the smell of coffee, and he looked around to see a steaming cup set on a table beside his chair. Rubbing his eyes, he blinked blearily at the nurse standing on the other side of Sherlock's bed.
“I know what you mean,” John said softly. “Still worried about Mum, though,” he murmured, arm tightening around Sherlock’s waist. “I know Harry would have called if… if something happened. I’m sorry, I can’t help it,” he said with a soft sigh.
John smiled at the kiss, leaning into it, his hand coming up to cup the back of his neck. "I'll never get tired of doing that," he said quietly, leaning up to kiss him again.
Harry looked at John steadily. "We're fine," she said. "She's just away a fair bit, paying dues for her company. Of course I wish she were here more, but that's just how it is," she said, making her and Mum's tea. "It's not forever," she said with a small smile.
I am sorry about the three, I know you did everything you could. And you remember that you did...don't carry that weight again, please. Just remember, that their chances, everyone's chances are higher with you there, and they definitely would not have made it it you hadn't helped. I love you. Been feeling a bit under the weather, Katherine gave me her cold I think. Mindy said something about going to the country or something on a holiday and I sent Katherine along with her, Harry, and Clara. All three of them send their love. I'm getting close to the first trimester ending, I look forward to that...I'll be less nervous I think.
She curled up on her side, her thumb slipping into her mouth as she curled up with her favourite blanket, asleep within minutes.
Sherlock felt his phone go off once, twice, and then finally three times. He swallowed, looking at the messages about 20 minutes after getting them. He stared at the phone for a while after that, finally standing numbly. It was starting to get a little dark out now, and he wondered just how long he'd been sitting there – didn't feel that long.
"Sorry isn't enough to get you out of this one, Sherlock," John answered, his voice quiet, because he was still afraid of yelling, still afraid of falling apart. "Sorry doesn't reassure me that you're not going to forfeit taking care of our daughter so that you can sulk in a corner. Sorry doesn't tell me that you're not going to starve yourself and end up hurting the baby. Sorry doesn't promise me that you're not going to give up hope that I'm coming back." He tossed the paper and pen aside, staring up at Sherlock with hurt in his eyes.
"Sherlock." John pulled his bondmate to a stop, reaching up and wrapping his arms around his neck for a moment. "I know. I understand, love." He pulled away, cupping Sherlock's cheeks and kissing him softly. "It's alright. I didn't want to throw another thing into what was already going on. I just want to spend the day with you, that's all." He kissed Sherlock again, reaching out for his hand and stroking his knuckles with his thumb.
John held onto Katherine's hands, wanting to keep her close for as long as possible. "That's right, it is," he said, smiling softly down at her. "January sixth," he told her, counting out six on his fingers. He looked up at the doorway when he heard Sherlock come back in, carrying a tray of breakfast on one hand, and a wiggling Hamish in his other arm. John laughed, reaching out for the tray. "I applaud your balance skills," he said with a broad smile.
Sherlock huffed, folding his arms around himself. He hadn't wanted John to leave. Sherlock had got John to let out about what was hurting him; he'd found a way to make him. But Sherlock couldn't do that with himself.
Sherlock tried to evade John and they both hit the ground, the commotion made Katherine whimper a little, and a moment later when the pills scattered everywhere she started to wail.
It didn’t take long for the two of them, as well as several of Mycroft’s affiliates from the council had infiltrated the warehouse under the guise of prospective buyers. There were only a handful of vampires running the slave house, which was all that was needed. Humans could hardly defend themselves, or escape.
John buried his face in the crook of Sherlock's neck, inhaling his scent deeply and shaking as he exhaled. "I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you so so much," he gasped, his arms wrapped tightly around Sherlock's waist and clinging to him, rocking him gently. "You have to promise me, promise me, to tell me about everything. Every stupid little thing that happens to you, I want to know, alright? You have to tell me all of it."
John stopped them when they were just in front of the security that he didn't have to walk through, but that Sherlock and Kat couldn't go past. He released their hands, kneeling down in front of Katherine and straightening her jacket. "You remember your promises to me, alright? You stay strong for your daddy. And be a good girl, and draw me lots of pictures, alright?" He kissed the tip of her nose and then pulled her into a tight hug. "I'll see you soon, baby," he promised, not wanting to ever let her go. There were other soldiers starting to file in around them who were saying goodbye to mates and family members as well, but he had attention only for his loves.
Katherine cuddled close to John, nodding a little. "Made promise," she said quietly, running her hand along the soft jumper.
Sherlock got out of his chair and patted Hamish's belly, the infant busy staring at something on the ceiling, before walking into the kitchen. He sighed, rinsing out the shot glass and putting it in the cupboard. He didn't say anything, John knew full well what time it was, and how it was something he should be careful with. Sherlock decided to try and trust him with it, though he would take care to make sure it didn't become habit. "Anything I can help with in here?" he asked, nodding towards the cooking.
Sherlock let out a slow breath, nodding a couple times as he rested his head on John's shoulder. "I promise... if you do," he murmured quietly. He knew John wouldn't be sleeping though... and that in all likelihood neither would he. He let out a breath, glancing out the window. "I'll keep the flat in order, try not to burn it down or anything," he said quietly.
John grinned, snapping his hips in a way that angled against Sherlock's prostate, holding his hips steady as he tried to squirm underneath him. "Alright, love," he whispered, his voice low, kissing Sherlock fiercely as he reached between them and stroked him quickly, twisting his hand to pull everything he could out of the Omega. "Come for me," he commanded in a whisper, biting at Sherlock's bottom lip.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "If you think anything you say will make me take that pill, you're wrong. And don't try the gun. I know it's fake."
Sherlock shook his head again. "Don't be," he said softly, running his fingers through John's hair for once. He swallowed, gently smoothing the blond hair down. It had grown out so much since John got back, and it was no longer what anyone would call a military cut.
"Dress warm Katty!" Sherlock called, shaking his head a little as he bounced the small pup in his hands. Hamish was already wearing two layers, and would get a third when they went out, as well as a thick hat. He looked up at John, letting out a breath. "You always were more of a morning person,” he said, yawning again.
Sherlock shrugged. "I don't... I don't know," he said, looking at the watch. “The engraving is the same, the watch was a gift from my mother. The glass is cracked along the edge, presumably from the accident," he said, swallowing. He thought the watch had been to rattle his cage, and he considered it sufficiently rattled. But as to what he should be looking for... he was lost.
"I don't think you'll have to worry about that for a long time," John commented, curling up around Katherine and humming softly to himself. He knew that there was always the possibility of disappearing into his mind, but he didn't find that likely either. Not tonight. "Goodnight, love," he murmured before quickly falling asleep.
John glanced over at Sherlock and put his arm around his shoulders, pulling him closer and against his side. "We can both go to bed when we get back," he promised in a whisper, pressing a kiss to the top of his head and then nuzzling against him.
John woke a few hours later, his eyelids fluttering softly and he hummed quietly. "You're still here," he murmured, looking up at Hamish and then at Sherlock. He pushed himself up into more of a sitting position, reaching out for the slightly fussy baby and taking him gently from Sherlock. "What's wrong with you, little one?" he asked, holding his son close to him. "Are you giving your daddy a hard time? You know he tries," he said, catching the attention of those bright blue eyes and holding them.
John stared down at the pen and paper, skimming over the bare truths. He hadn't mentioned the numerous scars he had accumulated from... well, he didn't actually know. He sighed, taking his third shot of the evening, and turned off the light to go to sleep.
Sherlock looked up at him, he knew of course what it was John was talking about, and he knew in all likelihood that the John that left may not be the John that came back.
He blinked, feeling his heart swell; he knew who that was. "Hello, Katherine," he said quietly. She leant in a little more, and it pained Sherlock to see the lack of recognition that she had once held. She had giggled to see him last, touching his face and saying his name for the first time. "You got big," he said, almost saying sweetheart but he didn't want to frighten her.
Sherlock didn't want that now; he'd read about the whole process, and separation too soon after is tortuous, primarily for the Omega, or so the studies said. He sighed, leaning his head on John's shoulder.
John cried harder, his whole body shaking. He felt nauseous, but he knew he wouldn't get sick. He just...
John raised his eyebrows, looking up at his mother and then over at Sherlock. "Well... hell," he said, more than a little amazed that she had settled so quickly.
Sherlock huffed out a breath, drawing the next breath in a little slower. He swallowed thickly, exhaling a bit slower as his body relaxed a little. He blinked a few times, looking around though no one was looking at them. Even with the display of affection, everyone else was too wrapped up in his or her own business to care. He let out another breath, closing his eyes part way as he slowly calmed a little more.
"Sherlock?" John leant back a little, cupping Sherlock's face in his hands and stroking his cheeks gently with his thumbs. "I thought we agreed that you weren't taking it this time?" he asked, unsure if Sherlock had forgotten or potentially changed his mind. "I want another pup, love. I don't think we should wait any longer."
Aaaaand I'm back. Or trying to be. On summer break now, but amazingly, life didn't get easier. Which means I have to acknowledge that my trouble doing things I enjoy...or things in general, wasn't just stress related. Anyway, new ch
John gave a small sigh and a nod, getting up from the table to toss what he didn't eat of his food and then put his dishes in the sink. "Yeah, maybe," he murmured, glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock and arching an eyebrow, who he knew to be fairly independent as well.
shoot you if I have to. Same as I did to that Alpha of yours." The lie was sweet on his tongue, and he knew how effective he was at the art. He was curious how Sherlock would respond.
John glanced down at the apple and set it on the table beside his chair, picking up his coffee and taking another sip. "Anything related between them outside of their deaths?" he asked, picking up the paper on the floor and reading through the headline. "Serial Suicides?" John raised his eyebrows at the title of the article, skimming through it to glean enough information so that he was caught up. "And you have nothing to go on?
Sherlock huffed, looking at his chair and moving over to it. He sank into the chair, his arms folded as if in a pout. He almost quipped that the baby being a little smaller might be a good thing, but then he realised how horrible that would sound. He let out a breath, then started in on his plate. "I'm not happy about it, but... fine," he said. "What else can't I have?" he asked, looking up at John.
"You’re alright, baby," he murmured when she stirred. "Go back to sleep." He kissed her forehead and rubbed her tummy, and then quickly retreated down the stairs.
John looked out of the window for a moment, reading the cemetery's name on the iron sign five times before he wordlessly took Sherlock's hand and all but dragged him out of the cab. It was going to hurt, probably tremendously, but it was going to get better as well. He just needed a little push in the right direction. Well, maybe a big push.
Maria came back in, looking at the two of them. "Back on your back love, need to check again," she said.
"One," John counted, still completely calm. He didn't believe in physical punishment for his daughter, not with how intelligent she was, but she would lose all of her favourite toys for a week if she didn't come out, and she knew it. "Two," he warned, setting the bottle down on the nightstand.
John chuckled, taking Katty's hand and the bag from Sherlock and walking up to the door. Mindy had it open before he could knock, and she took the bag from him so that he could hug Katherine. He kissed her forehead quickly, waved goodbye to both of them, and then trotted back to Sherlock.
Sherlock fell asleep wrapped up in John's arms, content once more and thinking again how he hadn't slept this well when John was gone. Thankful again that he had him. He woke up in the early morning when Hamish started crying, demanding a diaper change. He blinked his eyes open, rolling over and moving to pick the infant up and carry him over to the changing table, mostly on auto pilot.
John wiped at his eyes, smiling until he thought of something sobering. "And what if my only fear ever is losing you?" he asked quietly, staring down at the pavement as they walked towards the cafe.
John furrowed his brow, the thought not really having crossed his mind. "Alright, fine, calm down. We won't call him James, then. I don't want to call him Hamish though. It's an ugly name. I've always liked the name Miles, but, you know, personal preference." He shrugged, barely stifling a yawn.
Sherlock pocketed the letter, climbing out of the car. He turned his head back, though he didn't look back at Mycroft. "You find him... and bring him home, even if it's in a box.... you're not going to let him rot in that desert," he said, walking away and turning down an alley. Sherlock made it a few kilometres walking numbly towards the water front before he started shouting, swearing, and tearing at his hair.
John smiled. "I understand, love. I'll get you the pills in the morning, how bout? Tonight I just... I want to eat and then I want to hold you and then I want to sleep for at least nine hours." He pulled Sherlock closer, taking his hand and squeezing it.
Mindy smiled over the top of her mug, the liquid warming her hands. "Comparison. There was a difference between the two of you today compared to the last time you were here. John had a look in his eye that said he'd been in a hospital recently, and he could never hide anything important from me." She looked solidly at her son, raising her eyebrows.
"Your choice, love," Jim said sweetly, walking back over to the bed to sit down on it. "Some place with a view, though, would be lovely."
Sherlock sighed, resting the side of his head against his knees and looking at John still. "They shot your shoulder... old wound, re-broken once… no, twice. Got infected, no actual injury to your leg though," he said. "They think it's psychosomatic, correct too, in that respect."
“And yet here I am,” Sherlock said, gesturing with both of his hands to his person. “Difficult to comprehend I’m sure, however you did once.”
with all this dancing we've been doing." He paced around the plush hotel room he had rented for the week, holding the untraceable mobile to his ear.
Dragging in a breath, John slowly laid down, rolling over to face Sherlock. He rested his hand on Sherlock's cheek, just taking him in. "You're real," he murmured, reminding himself that he was home, Sherlock was here.
Hamish cooed, reaching up with his hands and balling them into fists in John's gown, trying to pull himself further up, a determined look on his face before he started babbling again with some sharp bursts, "Babababa....Gack!" He then grinned, bouncing a little on his belly. Sherlock watched Hamish, looking up at John when he finished talking.
"No, there hasn't been any sign of them. And I've looked. God, I looked." John glanced over at Sherlock, reaching out for his hand and unconsciously threading their fingers together.
John made a noise and shrug of agreement, turning his head to kiss Sherlock's temple. "True. Alright, then. We'll go over New Year's and then we'll see, I guess. It's furnished, so that's a plus," he murmured, kissing down to Sherlock's jaw.
"I'll be in as soon as I can," Sherlock said, moving to the waiting room, which had a good amount of people in it. He sighed, settling onto a padded bench away from most of them, waiting.
John sighed and threw the plate, watching in slight satisfaction as it broke to pieces. He tilted his head, betting that if he angled the next one differently, he could get it to break more, could produce smaller splinters of white China. He picked up a stack of plates, throwing them at the wall in quick succession. Each one that shattered pulled like a gunshot, and with each plate that he released, he saw one of his comrades. Then the plates would shatter, his ears ringing with distant gunfire, and the face would disappear to be replaced by another.
John gritted his teeth, his arms already weakening from exerting so much effort on such little strength. "Buggering fuck," he muttered to himself, dipping his head down for a moment and gasping deeply, trying to get more oxygen into a system that was desperately lacking it. "You're going to be fine," he murmured, leaning forward to kiss Sherlock. He heard the door open, and, though he couldn't see if it was friend or foe, yelled for their help.
The hair on the back of John's neck raised as he walked up the stairs, the familiar yet strange scent of another Alpha – older than himself, bigger, stronger – still evident in the flat.
One day after work, John came home and got the mail from Mrs. Hudson on his way up the stairs into 221B. The alpha walked in to find his mate laying on the sofa, watching telly and nibbling on a cookie. Sherlock had been baking - John could smell the delicious scent of fresh chocolate chip cookies waft through the flat.
So, the game continued. Sherlock traveled the world, using disguises and different names that no normal person could keep straight in their heads. The young Holmes stayed strong. He’d been captured a few dozen times, tortured for information. He'd been a soldier in America, a doctor in Spain, a tourist in India, a citizen in Norway, but it all came to an end two years later. After hundreds of fights with locals and Moriarty’s Network, it came to an end in Russia.
Sherlock was attending a case, a dangerous one if he was to be honest. The man that he was chasing was a highly wanted criminal, having just committed a quadruple homicide of a family. Three sons and the mother, all dead. The father had died in a car accident the previous month. Sherlock solved the case quickly, of course, but now was in grave danger as he cornered the criminal who pulled a gun on the youngest Holmes brother.
The Consulting Detective helped the paramedics load John up onto the ambulance, giving them everything he knew. Sherlock did his statement and ran off to find the criminal that had now injured yet another person.
John sighed, leaning forward in his chair, eyeing the colorless man. He was happy to see the figure yet extremely sad, knowing that it was just another hallucination.
Sherlock watched his mate fondly and returned back to watching telly when John came in a few minutes later with a very unsettling look in his eyes.
Before Mycroft could do anything, the man pulled out a gun and shot Sherlock in the back of his head and walked out.
“You’re scaring me, John,” he whimpered out. John once again tried to find the words to tell him what was wrong, but failed once again. He pulled away and held the letter out for the raven-haired man. John watched Sherlock as he read it. It seemed like it took forever as the alpha memorized every little detail that there was to remember about Sherlock. His eyes, his lips, his nose, his laugh lines, his curls, the way he held himself. John memorized every bit of Sherlock, terrified it would be the last chance he had. The soldier watched Sherlock’s jaw drop and his pale hand come to cover his mouth as his own tears began to fall. Seeing the omega cry brought John’s world crashing down and he pulled Sherlock close again as the taller man let out a sob. John held his husband and cried with him. In any other occasion, they would try to get one another to stop crying, but they both knew that wouldn’t happen, they needed each other, to hold one another, to be held by the other - so they stood there, crying and hugging until the silence was broken.
He watched as his husbands eyes meet his and he frowned, “John? Love, what’s wrong?” He asked worriedly.
Within a minute, John was tugging Sherlock’s hair with the intent to tell him he was close, while the taller man gave a moan of consent. After a few more seconds, he felt the swell of his alpha’s thick cock and the warm liquid slide down his throat as John came with a low groan of Sherlock’s name.
“Hello there, Officer Watson.” He purred out, hand on his chest as he kissed the man, “Ready to go?”
The buzzed omega thought for a quick moment before sinking to his knees and pulling John’s pulsing member from his skin tight shorts. He gave a long, wet lick up his shaft and closed his lips around the head, sucking gently.
John sighed and stood up, trudging downstairs after grabbing his gun. He never trusted anyone, not anymore. Once he hit the bottom of the stairs, he went over to the door and cracked it open.
Mycroft sighed on the other line, "let me talk to Doctor Watson." Sherlock's hand slowly outstretched towards John, handing the phone over.
Once the blonde was sure Sherlock was ready, he knocked on the door with a grin. The tall man opened it and looked confused before he spotted John with a bouquet of roses in his hand, he started laughing - the soldier kept his smile but sudden nervous flowed through him, he felt like he looked stupid and it was a dumb idea. The detective, of course, noticed and apologised, taking the flowers before pulling John into a hug and whispering a thank you.
Once John caught his breath, he pulled the omega into a deep, heated kiss and dragged him out onto the dance floor once more. They continued dancing until Sherlock was begging for John to take him.
"Just calling Mycroft Holmes, to prove to you," the man said hesitantly. He dialed a number quickly as he saw John's knuckles go white from holding the gun too tightly.
He stood there on the edge, looking over the extravagant city of London, the city that he came to love so dearly. His eyes scanned around. He’d been in the hospital beneath his feet countless times, saving life after life with haste. Every day became harder and harder. At this point he only had one person to live for, but it wasn't the same anymore. His eyes trailed down to the solid pavement beneath him, oblivious people walking and rushing around on the late night streets of London. Then the picture came into view. A body on the cold hard ground, motionless, ignored, blood pooling out of a destroyed skull. He shook his head quickly, tears forming quickly as he stumbled backwards with a choked sob.
The gun slipped from his hand as well as Sherlock's phone and his hands shot to cover his mouth with a gasp.
Everything had been going perfectly, John had never been happier in his entire life until now. He’d been married happily to Sherlock for about three weeks. Granted, it wasn’t long, but they went on their honeymoon the night after their wedding, the two went to Ireland, somewhere they had both wanted to go. They were both stress free and just overall happy. John couldn’t imagine ever being with anyone other than William Sherlock Scott Watson - he loved saying his name, calling him Mr. Watson, it sent butterflies through him, making him feel like he was a teenager again. John continued working, always excited and giddy to come home to find his husband there waiting for him. The soldier had recently been ranked up to Captain and graduated college, he was now a doctor in the army and making more than enough to support his husband and future children. He loved it that way, it meant that Sherlock could stay home and do whatever he wanted. Though John didn’t like traditional Alpha Omega roles where the omega was bound to the house to take care of children and housework, John certainly wanted to allow his omega to have the option as to what to do. Sherlock would work cases whenever he felt like it as long as he stayed safe.
"Yes, now, take your gun off my brother and let him in," that would normally be a request, but Mycroft's voice said it as an order.
The church bells rang as Sherlock walked out in a pristine suit, arm wrapped around his new husband’s arm. The newlywed couple walked out, rice being thrown into the air as the looked around. Gregory Lestrade stood with his arm around the eldest Holmes, both of them smiling, Ms. Hudson threw rice up with Molly Hooper. Everyone was happy and smiling, everything was okay for once. Nothing could go wrong, the two set their vows and now they were bound together in every way possible.
He could practically see the nervousness melting off of him as he gave him that gorgeous ‘John Watson’ smile.
The soldier smiled and kissed him softly and fondly. “I’m going to go steal one of those amazing cookies,” he winked and walked off into the kitchen.
Hey guys, so, since this chapter would've been kind of boring if we decided to split it up, Chelsey volunteered to write it solo and I think she did an absolutely amazing job!
John and Sherlock’s first encounter is a chilling story, but not one for today. Today was a much more important day, one that they both treasured much more than any other day of the year, perhaps more than any day in their entire lives. Today was the wedding day - the day two lovers waited for eagerly and impatiently. Sherlock Holmes was getting married, something he never thought would happen. The Baker Street Duo had been put through many trials, they’d gone through rigorous cases, they’d both been hurt, worried. They had both experienced loss and sacrificed. They were able to mend a relationship after a two year faked suicide. Not many people could manage that, but John Watson and Sherlock Holmes could. They built a life together after Sherlock came home. John showed more love to Sherlock than the man had ever experienced in his entire life. On Christmas day, 10 months ago, John gave Sherlock a present that he would never forget, John Watson gave Sherlock his past, his present, and his future, making a thousand promises with one titanium band. The blonde man proposed to Sherlock, asking the younger man to be by his side forever. The Consulting Detective would never deny John, especially of that. Now the day was finally upon them.
Today, since he didn’t have a case on, the raven-haired man decided to bake some chocolate chip cookies for his mate to eat when he got home. Sherlock was never one to adhere to traditional roles that society had put in place but he absolutely adored cooking and baking for John. He knew it reminded his alpha of his mum but not in a way that made him sad - which was what the omega appreciated.
His lips were like electric and his skin felt like it was on fire by the time John pulled away; his heart was pounding in his chest and he hugged him close, blissful smile plastered on his lips.
Sherlock was kneeled down, both arms chained up, shirtless. His curls had grown long and he sported facial hair like no other.
“Well, well, well, good afternoon Captain Watson.” Sherlock laughed happily and puckered his lips, waiting.
“Sherlock, what's wrong? And don't say nothing, because I can tell when something is wrong with you,” John looked at his best friend in worry.
Unsaid words would fill his mind until he slipped away from the woman lying beside him to go into the bathroom and cry. His nights were spent in this endless, vicious cycle of thinking then crying, occasionally he would cry himself to sleep.
That evening, John dressed in a suit - unusual for him - with a black, thin tie. He made sure his hair looked good before sneaking out of the flat. While Sherlock was sleeping earlier that evening, John had gone out and bought flowers.
The figure didn't say anything but kept walking instead, stride long and not stopping. John suddenly took into step with the man and caught up, catching the arm and spinning him around.
Almost every evening would be spent with any sort of alcohol he could get his hands on. He could never understand why Sherlock couldn't go long without smoking or shooting up with drugs. Now everything was so clear to him. Sherlock had been depressed and it was a release for him. Just as alcohol was now a release for John. The doctor knew he should stop but he couldn't. Time and time again, he would promise it was his last one, and time and time again, he would pick up yet another bottle and drink until he forgot.
John reread the letter a few times, swallowing a fat lump in his throat before setting his half eaten cookie down and going out to the living room, the letter clutched tightly in his hand as he looked over at Sherlock with horror in his eyes.
The buzzed alpha and intoxicated omega took a cab back to their flat, making out and touching one another hungrily and needily in the back seat before racing upstair. The moment the couple reached their bedroom, John pushed his prisoner to the bed and handcuffed him to the headboard with a devious smirk.
John looked into Sherlocks eyes, he was miffed. He was more than miffed, he was upset, the man in front of him was angry. No. Not angry, upset, disappointed.
The couple downed them just as fast as they got them and wedged their way onto the dance floor. As soon as the cop saw his prisoner turn around, he grabbed the man’s hips and pulled his back against his own chest, rocking his hips with the music as Sherlock rocked the opposite way. John caught strange looks from Lestrade, Anderson, Donovan, and many others that the duo worked with on cases, only making his own smirk grow. The alpha had been dying to show off their relationship and as soon as he knew they had everyone’s attention, he licked up Sherlock’s neck and to his ear.
John took him to the Galvin at Windows, treating him to an expensive dinner with fine wine. The raven haired man continuously tried to get the cheapest thing, but John wasn't having that. He consistently told him not to worry about all that, and eventually, the consulting detective listened. The blonde found himself unable to take his eyes off the omega, he was beautiful, and of course, John made it a point to say it constantly.
Sherlock eyed his companion closely, kicking away the gun quickly and grabbing his phone, "thank you brother mine," he said quickly in his broken voice before sliding his phone away.
The pair went through a few more dances before their gentle, loving kisses got more eager and heated. John didn’t take long to thank everyone for coming and saying their goodbyes before they rushed off to their honeymoon suite, hands never leaving the other. Needless to say, Mr. and Dr. Holmes-Watson didn’t get much sleep that evening. If there was one way that William Sherlock Scott Holmes-Watson would ever describe their wedding day, would be a single word – fantastic. Though when he walked through those double doors and saw John Watson standing at the altar, waiting to become his husband, well, in the words of that extraordinary man – “there he was, larger than life and so much more than I expected...”
The raven-haired prisoner went over to the makeshift bar and made the two each a heavy drink, handing John his plastic cup and he started rocking his body to the music, devious smile plastered on his lips. He led John to the dance floor and quickly put them front to back, with Sherlock grinding back against the blonde in his skin tight outfit. He could quickly feel the affect he had on his alpha and let out soft moaning noises as he danced.
The omega stood in the body-length mirror adoring the corner of his room and he adjusted the suspenders on his Halloween outfit. Truth be told, he’d bought it just to rile John up. He thought his prisoner costume, complete with a crop top orange shirt with a number across it and orange shorts, topped off with fishnet leggings, would be both ironic and incredibly sexy. Sherlock glanced at his boyfriend in the mirror as he adjusted his suspenders and smirked.
The blonde blushed lightly as he watched Sherlock strut up to him, his hand landing on the alpha’s chest, “hello there, Officer Watson. Ready to go?” He purred out.
He stumbled backwards. Questions and thoughts raced through his his mind as he stared, openly, eyes running through emotion that could be shown, his mind containing much more.
He watched as John struggled to speak and he quickly got up, going over to his mate and John suddenly pulled him into a tight, close hug, probably one of the closest hugs they’ve ever had.
Typically, Sherlock found new people mundane and uninteresting. Meeting people was a dull task that he was forced to do on a regular basis - greet, smile, shake hands, introduce, repeat. That’s how it worked. It was an unnecessary process that truthfully gave Sherlock anxiety to no end, especially when others were watching. The Consulting Detective never imagined he could meet a new person and actually enjoy it - he stood to be shown otherwise.
Steel blue eyes trailed up to catch the figure, “y-you're alive..” Mycroft’s voice slurred drunkenly.
Sherlock slowly shook his head, “it's quite positively nothing, John. I'm simply thinking, you should be accustomed to this by now.”
John let out a hearty, disbelieving laugh, "Sherlock Holmes is dead." He said grimly, no matter how much he wanted to believe that Sherlock was alive, he wasn't. He couldn't be. The fall, it haunted him, it was all too real, there's no way it could be fake.
He approached the raven-haired man and appeared nervous as he spoke. “Go on a date with me? Tonight?”
The blonde soldier walked into the flat after work one day, throwing his hat into his chair and going into the kitchen where he knew that his flatmate would be working on an experiment. That's all Sherlock did while the older man was at work. He was either on a case if one came up or experimenting.
“Don't try that again,” the figure said lowly and quietly, perhaps a bit louder than before but John couldn't tell. He hadn't heard him. His words were exaggerated, almost miffed.
Sherlock’s mind worked quickly as he observed the man that stood before the two. Straight posture, erect, proud - trained. Short hair, pristine look - military trained. Cane, cheap clothing - discharged due to injury. Hand behind his back - gun. The words appeared before Sherlock’s eyes and he froze, the military man was ready to shoot. That’s all he could tell at the distance and the light from the lamp above, but the situation was not good. Perhaps the man had a grudge against the criminal? Another killing? A family friend?
The eldest Holmes finally spoke up in Russian, “я думаю, что это достаточно, он не будет говорить” his words translated to ‘I think that’s enough, he won't speak’.
John closed his eyes, his head starting to hurt. When he opened them again, the figure was gone, just like that and the man that he once knew better than anyone was gone. He didn't even hear the door shut behind him, leaving him to question whether what had just happened was real or merely a figment of his imagination.
Those pale, blue-gray eyes went to meet his own ocean blue ones - they practically stared into his soul. John kept his eyes locked with the younger man's, afraid to look at his face to see his expression. He feared being rejected. After a long few moments, that deep, chilling voice erupted the silence with a yes. John exhaled heavily in relief and he took a drink of his beer, giving a bright, crooked smile.
The supposed Sherlock slowly reached into his pocket to take out his phone. John's grip on the gun tightened, he moved his finger to the trigger, ready to shoot.
The man looked at Mycroft and snarled, “то он бесполезен для наc.” Mycroft’s mind worked quickly to put it into English, ‘then he is useless to us.’
The moment John got pinned to the door and Sherlock dropped to his knees, he knew he wouldn’t last long. Sherlock tugged John’s rock hard prick out of the tight shorts and instantly took the plump head between his perfect lips, drawing a long, deep moan from the alpha.
Sherlock hated when John went to work and would quite often sulk around the flat as he waited for his best friend to get home. Today, he was working on splicing thumbs at different stages of decomposition when the alpha walked in. The detective watched as he went to the fridge and got himself a beer.
"That's why I'm calling, I'm at gun point and my wallet is in your office, so I can't prove my identity."
The omega’s heart skipped a beat and he stared up at John for what seemed like hours, to him, and then Sherlock uttered his answer in his baritone voice
Sherlock shook his head, “bystander effect. You shouldn’t have stopped. You’re human, you should’ve assumed that someone else would help and kept walking for your own safety, that’s how the human brain is programmed.”
John leaned against the counter, sorting through their mail, making two piles, one of personal mail and one of bill, tossing the junk into the trash can beside him. The alpha ran across an envelope with his name on it from the Army, assuming it was his paycheck, he ripped it open. Once he opened it, it soon came clear that he was not dealing with something that usual and his stomach flipped.
Throughout the years, Sherlock helped and saved thousands of people from impending dooms, solved an innumerable amount of cases. All for it to come down to a game of life and death with none other than James Moriarty. Mycroft watched from cameras as the scene played out. The cat and mouse chase between the two coming down the a fall. The eldest Holmes watched the scene fold out, a plan fail. Sherlock was supposed to walk down those stairs, not jump over the edge. Mycroft saw Doctor Watson standing at the bottom, witnessing his best friend plummet to the ground, to his death. Even Mycroft believed that it was real.
John Watson had a girlfriend now, Mary Morstan, the one person that could take the edge off of the pain that John felt deep down. Day after day, John worked himself to exhaustion just to keep his mind occupied as best he could, but in those silent moments when he was sitting at lunch or lying restless in bed, images and thoughts crept into the back of his skull.
The omega was soon handed the doomed letter by his mate and he read through it over and over again. His heart sunk to his feet and his stomach tied up in knots as he covered his mouth, eyes glazing over and he let out a choked, painful sob.
He barely pulled away, only enough to cup John’s cheeks and look him in the eyes “You have to come home to me. Alive..healthy, unscathed.”
The mysterious man in the doorway put his hands up defensively and in surrender, the coat dropped off his left shoulder.
The entire evening felt like a dream. Everything about it was perfect - from the food to the wine to the stunning man across from him. They talked the entire time about anything and everything. They never found themselves at a lack of things to talk about. The best part? It was so natural and easy.
John took a warm cookie and took a bite - it was like heaven in his mouth, he loved Sherlock’s cooking, it tasted like his mother’s from when he was young. His mates food brought back memories from before his mother died, but they rarely made him sad. It was quite the contrary, he smiled every time he tasted them, and Sherlock knew how happy they made him.
As night fell, the room became colder, the fall breeze blowing into the flat through the open window. John decided it was time to down some whiskey to bring the consulting detective back.
At the reception, Sherlock sat as close to John as he possibly could, smiling contentedly. John leaned over to his new husband, whispering in his ear, “I love you Mr. Holmes-Watson.”
‘It’s John Watson from a couple of evenings ago. I found your number online. I was wondering if you’d let me take you out for dinner Saturday evening at 7? -JW’
“What. The. Hell?!” He said louder, growing more angry as his eyes met steel blue eyes that were everchanging.
John took another sip, then another until the tall, slender figure was back in its proper spot. Hands steepled ever so perfectly under its chin, curls falling beautifully on its head. Even though the features were hardly readable, John knew it was him, well not really him but still, oddly enough, him.
“Hello, brother mine,” a tall dark figure stood in the doorway of Mycroft’s home office as he poured another glass of whiskey.
The case that led to the call that led to the jump, now it was time for a new chapter. A lonely, inebriated one. Caused by the fact that the one, the only consulting detective decided to jump off of a bloody building to his death. The call that very scene that stopped John Watson's very world, he hasn't done much with it since then.
John smiled and walked over, kissing Sherlock’s head. “Hey, my busy bee,” he grinned and looked at him, taking off his beret.
Every day of John Watson’s life was now a struggle just to get up, and now here he was, back to a wall on the roof of Saint Bartholomew’s hospital. He sobbed and slid down it, holding his hair. He looked over and a bottle of forty and grabbed it, taking a hefty swig before he pushed himself off the ground and looked at the ledge, stepping up. He raised his arms just as Sherlock had and shut his eyes tight, bracing himself.
Sherlock instantly shook his head and covered John’s lips with his own, giving him the gentlest and most loving kiss that he could, “I don’t want to hear it, John, that’s behind us and I will never leave you in the dark again. You are the strongest and bravest man I have ever had the good fortune of knowing, and today, I sit next to you as your husband.”
The omega found that the conversation flowed exceptionally well, which he was grateful for. He and John Watson were an absolutely perfect match and everyone around them knew it. No one had ever treated Sherlock so nicely before and he had never been on a more perfect date.
The police officer panted and barely noticed his prisoner fixing him and stuffing him back into his shorts. His prick still bulged in the leather despite his softened state - one they both knew wouldn’t last long.
John’s entire world stopped and he kissed back just as the omega had. Once Sherlock pulled away, the alpha’s heart was pounding, his lips were tingling, both of them had a blush upon their cheeks. The soldier looked up at the man and smiled fondly before hugging him and kissing his cheek.
“What the hell?” He groaned and rubbed his hip, opening his eyes to see black oxford leather shoes. He watched, soon seeing the heels of the expensive footwear as they started moving away. His eyes trailed up black trousers to find a long black coat. He finally reached the back of the person's head, black curls on top.
John stood slowly and shakily and went through the access point on the roof, a large message spray painted on the wall in front of him. The doctor stopped in his tracks, face paling like a man who was raking dead leaves and came across a cold severed hand.
Sherlock cut him off, “I needed to be sure you were okay, but why would you put yourself in danger like that?”
The soldier let out a small laugh, “I just can’t help myself, you’re so beautiful, Sherlock, absolutely stunning. I cannot fathom how I got so damn lucky. You are absolutely perfect and I adore you to no end. I love you with everything I have, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, you mean the world to me, you wonderful omega.”
After about two more drinks, he suddenly felt hands come to his hips and lips press against his ear, “Come on, Sherl...give me something. I can’t take seeing you in this outfit and feeling your arse on me anymore.”“
Mycroft sat in the chair in front of his brother, in a disguise of his own. He watched a man in the Network crack a whip hard over Sherlock's back for the nineteenth time. Sherlock didn't scream anymore, he just jolted in pain and grunted, head bowed.
So many times in the past had John seen this figure. So elegantly sat there, the blond had so many memories from his encounters with the grey figure. So many drunken memories that kept him sane, even when he felt insane.
After approximately 6 months of living with the renowned genius, John found himself at his breaking point. He needed for Sherlock to be his - or he needed to at least take a chance.
John laid awake in bed, mind glued on the omega that he’d met by a slim chance. His lips still felt Sherlock’s soft ones and he smiled to himself as he finally dozed off. It was then that he was positive Sherlock Holmes was the one he wanted forever.
John was soon brought out of his train of thought and back into reality once he heard the deep voice of Sherlocks. “John, you’re staring again. If you have something to say, say it.”
"Ahh, yes, brother dear, I'm assuming you've made it back to Baker Street. Is your colleague filled with joy or hatred?"
Though colors hardly there, the high cheekbones and bow-shaped lips were prominent. A long trench coat, collar flipped up and scarf tied around his neck.
Sherlock watched John as he spoke, committing every speck of his face to memory, as if he hadn’t already, “I promise you, Sherlock. I’ll come home, it’ll be okay”
His chest full of air, weight starting to move forward. Then there it was. A heavy hand on his shoulder, not a woman's touch, the hand was too big. It pulled him back off the ledge, almost aggressively. John let out a puff of air as he fell back onto his bum, the alcohol falling out of his hand and smashing.
That night, when they went home, they sat down and had some tea. The duo talked for another couple hours before they found themselves at one in the morning. Time had never slipped by the alpha so quickly, he'd never been able to talk so long and be so happy and so comfortable. He bid the omega goodnight and went to go upstairs. That's when Sherlock got up and grabbed his hand. When John turned to look at Sherlock, he leaned forward and kissed the shorter man gently and slowly.
The mates went at it well into the early hours of morning before falling asleep draped over one another in pure exhaustion and love. Even now, after how drunk they both were, they had pictures and vivid memories of that Halloween evening.
After everything the siblings did together to stop this from happening, Mycroft Holmes watched his baby brother die in front of him. Every day, Mycroft wished he had sent his brother back home to John. That he would've not let any of this happen. What Sherlock went through was the ultimate sacrifice to those that he cared about. Now, London was free of Moriarty, John Watson would never be in that danger again, everyone Sherlock ever worked with wouldn't have to worry about James Moriarty returning in another way. Sherlock Holmes made a sacrifice of his life to keep everyone safe. Though, what he never saw was the impact that his death took. Jumping from the roof brought John into depression, drove Philip Anderson into insanity. Everyone that had ever been around Sherlock blamed themselves for his death. He was truly missed, and no one but Mycroft Holmes knew the true story. The fake one was better for the public. John Watson worked his days away bringing Sherlock’s name back to glory. Anderson tried convincing people he was alive. Mycroft Holmes lived with the guilt of being the reason no one had the privilege of being with Sherlock Holmes ever again.
With that thought, he left, avoiding the staircase to the roof every day he walked into that hospital. John Watson could never step over that ledge like his best friend did two years ago.
Standing there on the other side was a tall silhouette of a man, features unreadable due to the bright street lights behind. John furrowed his brow and opened the door a bit more so he could move to the side to get a better look at the mans features.
The omega let the letter cascade to the ground as he was pulled into another deep hug by his mate. The omega sobbed heavily into John’s neck, body trembling.
“I-I love you, Sherlock.” The alpha's voice cracked in a barely-there whisper and he sounded absolutely devastated.
Once Sherlock finished the case and reported to Scotland Yard to do what Lestrade needed him to do afterwards, he made his way to Saint Bartholomew’s to see John. When he arrives, he used Mycroft’s clarence card that he stole to get straight to John’s room. He walked in and sat down in a chair beside the bed, observing him. After a few hours, the man started to wake - it was a slow process.
“I promise you, Sherlock. I’ll come home, it’ll be okay.” The alpha kissed his husband with everything he had, sealing the promise.
John had been on many dates before, but this - what he had with Sherlock - it was so amazing. The blonde didn't feel the need to try and impress Sherlock, yes he had dressed up, and yes he had brought him to the nicest place he could think of, but it wasn't to impress the tall omega, it was to show he cared. John's other dates had been weird, some of them had been with women who only wanted sex, others had only wanted a night out, but Sherlock and John wanted to just be together and have fun - it was perfect.
John grabbed himself a beer and looked at his best friend for a long moment, mustering up the courage. “Go on a date with me? Tonight?” Yes, he realised it didn't sound like much of a proper question, but that's all that came out and the medical student was glad he got at least that.
John opened his mouth to protest just to watch the tall detective stand and disappear into his room for the rest of the day.
John on the other hand, grew increasingly angry and he cussed up a storm, putting emphasis on each of them.
Sherlock looked over to the door with bright eyes as he heard John open it and he smiled brightly when his alpha came over, planting a soft kiss to Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock pulled away just enough to cup John’s cheeks, “you have to come home to me. Alive, healthy, unscathed.”
Sherlock Holmes never ceased to surprise his older brother. They helped one another, Mycroft helped Sherlock fight the network, Sherlock helped his brother stay happy. Sherlock had begged time and time again to go back to Baker Street, but Mycroft didn't let up, he thought it'd be more dangerous.
Sherlock rushed over to the complete stranger and kneeled down, quickly looking him over quickly. He’d been shot in the side, the bullet exited without hitting anything major. Sherlock put his hand over it and dialed 999.The man spewed out the series of events that had just occurred, requesting an ambulance. He put his phone away and looked down at the man.
his. In every sense of the word. In all honesty? John had been wrapped around Sherlock’s finger since the start, John was all his - forever, no matter what.
Sherlock used his free hand to pat his cheek, “you have to stay with me, John, just until an ambulance arrives.” Sherlock moved John’s head into his lap to keep his head elevated.
The phone rang twice before there was an answer, "Mycroft Holmes speaking," the voice said through the phone that the caller put onto speaker.
Once they arrived, Sherlock fluffed his hair out in the window of the cab and dragged his mate into the loud party. He grinned as he felt the pounding music in his chest and saw the strobe lights reflecting off his alpha’s slightly sweaty body.
Sherlock stood up and walked over to the alpha, eyes filled with concern. John just looked at him for a long moment before wrapping his arms tightly around the man, holding him closer and tighter than he ever had.
These encounters became a daily thing. Every day John got out of bed, took aspirin, got showered and dressed, made his way to the cemetery, begged him to stop being dead, came home, tried to write on his blog (with no prevail), and got drunk again. This was his daily routine. He hardly spoke to Mrs. Hudson. Nothing mattered to him anymore. He didn't have anything, nothing to strive for. He didn't feel the need to impress him or keep him entertained and under control.
He stood and gave himself a final look when he heard the doorbell ring. He went over in utter confusion and swung it open, seeing John standing there all dressed up with a bouquet of roses in his hand and a giant smile on his face. Sherlock couldn’t help the nervous laughter that erupted from him but, quickly changed pace once he noticed he’d made the blonde nervous and a touch uncomfortable. He quickly took the flowers, and apologized, before pulling his counterpart into a deep hug.
Though people never believed him, Mycroft Holmes cared deeply for his little brother. So many people in this world needed Sherlock Holmes. Doctor John Watson, the broken soldier that had been rebuilt by Sherlock needed the young Holmes. Mrs. Martha Hudson, the landlady that worried so deeply about Sherlock needed him. Molly Hooper, the woman that had fallen so deeply in love with Sherlock needed him. Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade, the man Sherlock helped on cases needed him. Mycroft Holmes, the one who watched over Sherlock needed him. London, England, the place Sherlock protected from crime needed him. Sherlock Holmes was such a vital part to so many people's lives, and as Mycroft played a game of chance, he messed it up.
John regularly saw a therapist. He needed to. For his own sake. She helped him a bit. Helped him think clearly when things became too much at times. He saw her weekly; every Tuesday at ten in the morning. It was a nice routine he had become accustomed to. It helped him get through the week and through the days that seemed to go on and on and on. Seeing a therapist helped him get through the bad days and,
At the sound of his name, the bow on the violin stopped abruptly and the tall, slender figure turned slightly. Striking, steel blue eyes landed on John and he felt his bottom lip quiver. He couldn’t believe his eyes.
John inhaled and exhaled again, trying to calm himself as he listened to her speak. He had no idea what being ‘time-sick’ meant, but he didn’t bother with asking. “I should also mention that we only get one shot at this. If we fail and this timeline is recreated, it must stay. There is no do-over. It is risky just doing this once.”
“Can’t tell what?” John stared at her, a clear frown on his face and his annoyance showing. He was not enjoying this little joke or game or whatever it was that she was doing.
John’s mind was spiraling, but how was it spiraling if he was inside his mind and- John touched his head, a pang of pain fleeting through it.
“Is this some sort of joke?” He broke the silence between them. The woman snorted out a laugh and John felt even more of a fool.
As John strolled through a nice park, he thought about stopping for a coffee somewhere soon. He glanced around. There were couples walking hand-in-hand and families playing with the ducks near the pond. He sighed quietly. Life felt so different without
When another Tuesday rolled around, just like any other, John Watson had no idea his life was about to change for the second time. He had just walked out of his therapy session, which went pretty well. He told his therapist about the happier moments he shared with Sherlock rather than the last few fleeting moments before the Fall and, overall, it had been nice, but it left an odd, melancholic feeling sitting in his chest, so he decided to walk home instead of choosing to take a cab. He tried to tell himself it wasn’t because he would arrive home to an empty flat.
John nodded, feeling exactly like she said he would. Distantly, he could hear the rumble of London life outside the flat. He shook his head as things started to feel more grounded and not like he was floating in space. They locked eyes for a moment.
. Nothing that came from Sherlock was fake. Everything he did and said was logical, correct, quick, exhilarating, and most of all,
Anyways, I hope you enjoy it. Please leave any comments, telling me what you think, or just leave a kudos if you enjoyed reading it.
There were so many nights where John would sit on his bed and stare at the handgun he kept at his bedside and contemplate if he would see his best friend again if he just pulled the trigger. If pulling the trigger would stop the tears flowing down his cheeks and stop the pain slowly eating away at his heart. But, then he would set the gun aside and weep into his palms until he fell asleep on a tear-stained pillow.
“You and Sherlock Holmes are quite a unique pair.” The woman was saying as John, astoundingly, watched himself walk by with a cane next to Mike. John’s mouth fell open. He felt like he was dead now and this was his life flashing before his eyes. The scene seemingly switched before his eyes as if he was viewing a movie. John watched as Mike and his other self walked into a lab room of Bart’s. John’s heart stopped at the person standing across the way. A mop of black curly hair. A tall, slim figure in a black suit studying something under a microscope.
“Well, this is me. Again, sorry for bumping into you earlier.” He said politely, hand reaching for the door handle.
She pressed her lips together and gave a curt nod. “I enjoyed reading your blog. Quite fascinating it all was.”
The day continued without much excitement. There had been no excitement in John’s life since Sherlock died, but the current days were beginning to feel longer and longer. John tried to keep himself busy, but it was tough, especially surrounded by everything that reminded him of the detective.
He pressed the call button and put the phone up to his ear. It rang and his heart pounded loudly. The ringing ended-
John shook his head, not wanting to even be reminded of that. There was no way in hell Sherlock was working with Moriarty. He just wouldn’t believe that. Lestrade calmed for a moment and glanced at John, his brow softening as he looked at the ex-army doctor.
“What if I told you there was a possibility? A second chance. A chance to save him. A chance to bring. Him. Back.”
Before she had a chance to respond, John, hurriedly, pushed open the door to 221B and stumbled inside, locking it and leaving the woman standing outside without another word. He pressed his back up against the door and waited for a moment. A sigh escaped him. He heard the sound of high heels clicking against the pavement and, much to his surprise, a small card slipped under the door between his feet. John frowned at it and bent, picking it up. Before he had a chance to look at it, Mrs. Hudson came out of her flat.
Before the woman could say anything else, the barista at the counter called out their order and the two grabbed their paper coffee cups and exited the coffee shop. The cup was warm against John’s fingers as he brought it to his lips and took a sip of the caffeinated drink. It was delicious and reminded him of the day he sat on the bench with Mike and drank the same cup of coffee just an hour before he met Sherlock Holmes. He wiped the memory away as they started on their way. John wasn’t sure why the woman hadn’t parted ways with him yet. He had followed through with his offer and figured the woman would say her goodbye to him and he would never see her again, but for some reason, she continued walking next to him down the side of the street.
“I should inform you that if we fail to prevent the variable, the same fate will ensue for Sherlock, thus creating this altered timeline all over again and you will have to relive the events in real-time for a second time.”
“John I need you to understand what I am saying.” Destiny lightly grabbed his shoulder where his old bullet wound was, somehow it grounded him. It kept him from spiraling even further, “Listen to me, Sherlock was not supposed to
“Oh John, I was just about to come up to see you!” She exclaimed, a sweet smile gracing her features. John mindlessly stuffed the card into his coat pocket.
It was late in the evening and John had the telly running in the background as he browsed his computer at the table in the common area. He sat with his chin resting on the palm of his hand and his elbow on the table. He had the link to his blog open on one of the windows. He stared at it, the cursor line blinking at him, taunting him.
“Yes and as I was saying…” She said as the scene before them played out faintly as they spoke, “You and Sherlock are a unique pair of human beings.” “I don’t understand,” John mumbled as he stared at Sherlock, his eyes not leaving the man as he texted something on his other self’s mobile phone.
However, before he could ponder it any longer, Mrs. Hudson came up the stairs with a silver tray of biscuits fresh from the oven. They smelled wonderful. John tossed the card on the side table next to his chair and greeted Mrs. Hudson with a warm smile.
The woman closed her eyes for a moment before opening them again, that sad expression still lingering there. “John, I have never wished to harm you in any way.”
. He uncovered the truths that people wanted to keep hidden. Exposed them for who they were and it was all so
John pushed the comforter aside and hurried to put his shoes on. He also snatched up his coat and pulled it on hastily. “Thank you for listening to me and taking the time to rest up. It’ll make the process and transition from different timelines much smoother for you.”
Lestrade came around more often, it seemed. Sometimes he would randomly pop by 221B and share a tea or something a lot stronger with John and they would chat and hang out. John knew the man was probably hurting as well and they were simply comforted by each other’s presence. They didn’t talk about Sherlock much, but it was a mutual understanding that was unspoken between them. Talking about Sherlock would bring tears and heartache to both of them and neither man knew if they were ready to show that side to one another.
John stumbled into the common area of the flat and stopped in the doorway, breathing heavily. His back was to John, but standing in the middle of the flat in a silk blue robe with a mess of black curls was-
John walked to the room at the end of the hallway and reached out, hesitantly, for the doorknob. He hadn’t set foot in Sherlock’s room since his passing. He slowly turned the knob and opened the door. It creaked upon opening it and John’s breath hitched in his throat as he slowly stepped inside. He switched the lamp on that sat on the nightstand, washing the room in a warm glow of orange light. Everything looked exactly as Sherlock had left it. John’s heart felt heavy in his chest as he sat on Sherlock’s bed, feeling the soft comforter there. He took a moment to let his eyes drift around the room. He hadn’t been in Sherlock’s room many times, only out of respect for his privacy, but…
“Somewhere along the way, the timeline got skewed and now we are currently here in a timeline that, frankly, should not even exist,” Destiny continued, “I can alter the timeline to be back on track, but I need your help to do so.”
Once he was in bed, he closed his eyes, sighing quietly into the darkness of his room. John tried to sleep. He felt tired, but his body wasn’t allowing him to fall asleep. He tossed and turned and huffed in frustration. John sat up in bed, running his hands through his short hair before letting them fall to his lap. He glanced briefly at the clock that sat on his nightstand. It was just nearing three in the morning. John shook his head and then glanced at his shut door.
