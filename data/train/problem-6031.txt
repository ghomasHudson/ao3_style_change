“How nice of them to do that after you take out half their security,” Clint says around a mouth full of popcorn.
“Don’t worry about that. Tony and I have nightmares all the time. More likely than not, we’ll already be awake.”
She puts her gun back in its holster. Then she leans against the wall. As the hobo comes around the corner with his gun drawn, she grips his arm and flips him onto the ground. With a twist his wrist cracks causing the gun to fall from his grip and she kneels onto his throat.
“It’s called a Watch Bug. HYDRA would sometimes use them. They’re literal flies on the wall and they’re usually filled with deadly goodies if anyone gets too close,” Bucky says.
“Just got a text from him a few minutes before you came out. He got her to go down for twenty minutes. Then he took her to the park in hopes that some fresh air would do her some good.”
Tony looks over his shoulder. Mari is sitting on the bed in the clothes she had picked out. They stare at each other, waiting. He turns his whole body towards her and tries to read her eyes for what she may want. She looks down at her feet and wiggles them at him. That is when he sees her laces are untied. He smiles.
Tony opens the door at a slow pace and reveals that it is empty aside from what few clothes she brought. “See?” He gets in and hits the light switch. “Nothing except a few clothes, shoes, your suitcase, and a very good looking scientist.”
One morning, after a particularly nasty fight with Doctor Doom (which had prompted a surprise visit from Bruce Banner, who afterwards, also decided to take up residence in the Tower), Steve sat at the kitchen table. He was eating a bowl of oatmeal, and looking at the thin, manila envelope Natasha had brought along with the rest of his things, that would tell him whether or not Peggy was still alive.
Steve had spent the first few days attempting to do the same thing he had done at SHIELD, which was, essentially, nothing except draw. On the fourth day, Tony had burst into his room, forced him to get dressed, and dragged him outside.
A drunken shout drew both of their eyes back to Clint and Tony. Natasha had Clint in some sort of headlock with her legs, and Tony had slung an arm over Thor’s shoulders as the man taught him an Asgardian drinking song. Steve couldn’t help but smile at the picture his friends made.
Tony waltzed over to Coulson’s side, raised a hand as if to clamp him on the shoulder, then seemed to think better of it when the man glared at the appendage.
, and he winced slightly, rubbing the area with his hand. In some ways, Tony reminded Steve of Peggy.
“—and with that, I’ll be off. Jarvis, please monitor Coulson’s movements and inform me if he even comes on the same floor as me with a Taser.”)
Tony’s soft voice broke him from his thoughts, and he opened his eyes to look over. The others had started their way back to the cars. Tony found his hand, squeezed it.
Steve stepped inside the office, and closed the door behind him. He put his hands behind his back, and waited for further permission to speak.
Tony had flopped down on one of the couches and picked up a thin pad. His fingers pushed out and pulled together, much like he had seen some agents do. He was working on something, most likely.
“No offence, Cap, but I don’t understand why this had to be all hush, hush. You could have told any one of us, or at least, any one of us that wasn’t Coulson.  I know the guy is, like, your biggest fan and you might feel bad if you don’t stop and pet him occasionally, but we could have helped you find your girlfriend.” And even if Steve imagined the hurt that shone briefly in Tony’s eyes at hearing that he had spilled his secrets to Coulson instead of him, it was still comforting. “We wouldn’t have judged you or anything, even if the seventy year time gap is a little weird. Okay, it’s more than a little weird, it’s downright creepy, but, hey, some people go for that kind of thing.”
“I could never forget the night we all sat around and watched Miller’s band play through the night,” Steve reached forward and grasped her hand, squeezed it gently before letting it go in favour of the bag at his feet. “You talked about his music for days afterwards.”
She pulled away first, gradually made her way over to her chair. When she had sat down, she looked up at Steve.
“I didn’t mean to freeze up like I did,” Steve murmured, finally looking Tony in the eye. He tried not to look away, wanting to seem more confident than he really was, even though Tony could probably see right through his act. “I only…when I saw the ice begin to appear I panicked, and I didn’t know how to stop. It’s never happened to me before today, at least not while I was awake.”
Peggy, so different from how he had known her, but also exactly the same, asked one thing of him, and he couldn’t help but consent. He owed it to her.
Jarvis paused before answering, his tone thoughtful. “Sir has never displayed this kind behaviour previously, but, yes, Captain Rogers, for you, it did seem to be just that simple.”
Tony turned his face towards Steve’s, and swallowed again. For a brief moment, Steve had a flash of doubt, then saw the tiniest flicker of something unnamable in Tony’s eyes. Steeling his nerves, Steve smoothly slid the hand grasping Tony’s wrist, up his arm and came to stop at his jaw. He cupped it gently. Then, Steve kissed him.
This one was no less uncomfortable, but Tony had taken control, and where the first one had been shy and gentle, this one was faster and tinged with eagerness. His tongue flicked against Steve’s lip, and he opened his mouth. Everything, the hand on the back of his neck, the rough scratch of Tony’s beard against his face, had him shifting to get more, made him grip Tony tighter.
As they came to a stop a few moments later, he realised what he had done. He had just let go of it; of what he used to be. And he was alright with that.
“Yeah, actually.” The man stepped closer, hands tucked into his pockets, and smiled mischievously. “I’m here to bust to you out.”
“My youngest son, Richard, died soon after in an airplane crash,” she continued. “His son, Peter, was placed into Benjamin’s care when he was just a small boy.”
By the time they got back to Stark Tower, Coulson had returned from a mission he had disappeared off to a few days previously, and he had brought guests.
Steve opened his mouth to say something—anything—when Tony looped an arm around the back of his neck, and pulled him back down for another kiss.
“It’s a pleasure to see you again, Captain,” Coulson responded, his usually cool, even tone slightly sped up.
“You—,” Peggy started, then had to start over when her voice failed her. “You turn up after sixty-seven years with flowers and expect a girl to forgive you?”
He followed the receptionist through a pair of doors, to a wide, bright sitting room. It was quiet, with the exception of a television going in a corner, and there were only a few elderly people about. With all its bleak features and empty spaces, Steve was instantly reminded of his old room at SHIELD.
With a deep breath, Steve set down his spoon, and picked the folder up. He reached inside to slide the piece of paper out—
“When I saw you on that ice, it was really a miracle,” Coulson was saying. “Because how many people get to watch as their hero is thawed from ice after almost seventy years?”
It took a while before they stopped crying. Every time Peggy would calm down, she would look at his face, and would start all over again. Steve wound down first, taking deep, shuddery breaths to calm himself, but remained engulfed in Peggy’s fragile arms, doing an awkward kneel/crouch.
“That’s not really how we handle things here,” Bruce was explaining to Thor. “When we mourn someone who’s died, there’s usually a lot of casseroles and other foods that are consumed. Comfort foods.”
“Mr. Stark,” Steve started, a frown working a way onto his face as Tony began thumbing through the drawings on his desk.
“I’m going to need to see some identification, and then I’ll let you go on back.” She held her hand out, and it took Steve a moment to figure out that she probably wanted to see his drivers’ license. He offered it, and she only gave it a cursory glance before returning it. She made him sign his name on a piece of paper, then stood up to show him where to go.
Steve had started bringing him snacks throughout the day, and leaving them near Tony so he could eat, and when he went back down to the workshop to collect the plates, he was pleased to see that Tony was actually eating what he left. Then, he worked his way up to meals. Most days out of the week, Steve made Tony breakfast and dinner, but he had always brought the food to him. It had occurred to him a few days ago that, maybe he could convince Tony to take a break and actually eat at a table for once.
“Morning greetings little warrior.” He bends down and pulls Mari from his legs, lifting her onto the counter. “How are you fairing after your epic battle?”
Clint walks towards Steve and Mari at a slow gate. “Heeeey. So I’m Clint.” He tries to make eye contact with Mari but her face is buried in Steve’s chest. He looks up to the Captain sheepishly. Steve just glares back. Clint turns back to Mari who he can hear whimpering. “I’m sorry about earlier. I thought it would be fun. You know, cool entrance, cool guy. Come on. You don’t have to be scared of me. I’m just a guy with a bow and some arrows…and confetti…and a fear of being star spangle strangled…”
When Happy had dragged him out that morning, Steve was left alone with a cranky toddler recovering from the tail end of a cold and sleep deprivation. Tony had sat up with her most of the night hiding from his own nightmares while he soothed her’s. No amount of rocking, soft assurances, or warm drinks were able to put her back to sleep though. By the time Tony had to leave, Mari was reduced to a sobbing mess, clogging her already stuffed nose even more. Steve had assured him he had everything handled but he could not help but continue to worry.
Yeah, that was it. He could turn the closet into a bathroom. It need to be widened out but it should be easy enough to hook into the plumbing.
“It wasn’t a sex dungeon, it was more of a sex lounge. And besides, I had a better shot at that than you think. Not many people know how kinky he can be,” Tony says in a purr.
Tony locks up when the words filter through his panic. Last he checked, Chitauri did not speak. At least not in a language he understood. He pries open his eyes and looks around him. The space scape is gone and the alien has vanished, leaving his husband in its place holding his forearms. Steve is watching him with a concerned look. He looks around the room again and tries to pull air through his lungs. The air feels stagnate and his heart feels like it’s slamming against his rib cage.
“Uh-oh.” Tony says as he walks up the steps that lead to his lab, looking down at a tablet. “You only call me your husband in one of two scenarios and that’s not your fun time voice.”
Tony jerks to his feet but winces and wraps an arm around his ribs. He shakes off Bruce who reaches out to lower him back to the bed. “Oh cut me a fucking break. I may rag on SHIELD security but it still takes a large amount of skill to get through.”
“Oh, that’s right. That did not even occur to me. Poor Steve. I’ve been there more than I care to admit.”
“I know, we can leave once we get you and Daddy patched up.” Steve runs a hand up and down her back.
The girl turns back to the mirror and fluffs her hair. “Well since you’re here let’s talk about our relationship.”
“That’s okay,” Steve says. “You won’t have to do anything you aren’t comfortable with. This is just a way to introduce you to our friends in a…controlled and safe environment.”
“I don’t know. I do know, that you can’t go another night without sleep though.” He slips into Mari’s room and tucks her under the covers. He takes the book and puts it and her glasses onto the bedside table. “Now, to prevent any more trouble,” Tony sits on the bed next to her and leans back against the head board. “I’m going to sit right here until I hear little snores.”
“This is kind of a big thing to keep under wraps Steve,” says Sam. “I mean, why hasn’t Natasha brought this up herself?”
This stops Steve up short. “I-…Tony, we finally got a trail on Bucky after months of nothing. Mari is going to understand if I miss one bedtime story. Hell, with our lives it’s probably going to happen a lot more over the years.”
He darts around the room looking in anything big enough to hide her. He flings open the closet door and steps over the fallen suitcase. He’s moving to check the hamper when he hears a small yawn. He spins around and scans the room.
Bucky glances up at Nat. She just jerks her head to motion him in and goes back to the center of the ring. Bucky sighs and hands his jacket to Steve. As Bucky gets into the ring Steve says, “Be careful.”
“Yeah I know! But I didn’t see the bug much before she did. That didn’t give me a lot of time to identify it. HYDRA has a whole range of those things. It could have been equipped to do anything from surveillance to assassination. I had to take it out before she did something stupid. Which of course she was going to do because she’s YOUR kid.” Bucky jabs a finger at him. “Couldn’t stay out of trouble if your life depended on it. Literally.”
“Alright, let’s get this party started.” Tony claps his hands and rubs them together. Then he takes Mari from Steve to set her on the ground. He pushes her glasses back up her nose. “Why don’t you go wait by the elevator to greet them?”
“Got ya to move didn’t it?” He places a plate down in front of her before moving to the next setting.
Pepper who is standing next to Tony with crossed arms and tapping her foot in a rapid beat, looks away in frustration. That is when she sees Steve weaving through agents. She waves him over and leans towards Tony. “Tony, Steve’s here.”
Nat stares at the bullet before saying, “He had Mari pass on that file of Chameleon. Maybe he’s caught wind of what’s going on.”
“No and I’d like to point out that I can easily get a job where I don’t have to suffer verbal abuse from you or physical abuse from Russian super spies.” He jumps as the door rattles in its frame.
“And they weren’t…because they couldn’t afford it…It was ruled as neglect…” He starts gathering the papers back into the folder.
“Does anyone have eyes on Stark? I doubt he’d leave his brat up here for long. Well how the hell should I know-wait. Let me ask the kid.” He turns to Mari. “You know where your parents are?”
Tony goes still and averts his eyes. He focuses on a loose thread in the pillow case. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves yet…”
Nat with Clint on the back of her bike comes to a stop beside Steve’s. Thor flies through and lands next to Bruce as the frazzled scientist shuts off Steve’s bike.
They get up to the seventy fifth floor in a fraction of the time. Before Steve even comes to a complete stop he swings over the railing and marches straight into the SHIELD Nerve Center. Everyone is busy and moving around like a hive. His eyes scan over the tops of everyone until he finds the styled brown hair he is looking for. He makes a beeline for him and as he gets closer he can hear Tony’s raised voice.
“Don’t worry. We have the paper work on our side. The most they can do is rile up the paparazzi.” Tony reaches up and brushes a stray blonde hair back in to place.
“She’s certainly blind enough for them to work that way. Besides, she’s not using them right now.” He moves on to the chip. “No identifying marks that I can make out. Jarvis you got any observations?”
Bucky groans. “Oh. It doesn’t matter what century I’m in, I’ll always know that heavenly aroma.” Bucky turns to locate the hot dog stand.
Mari nods and says with practiced ease, “Everyone has strings and you never know who’s pulling them.”
They wave and say their farewells as Bucky and Sam head out the doors. As they walk, Bucky fiddles with the scrap of paper in his flesh hand.
“You still need to tell me stuff like this. I’m your husband, her father, I need to know these things Tony.”
“Yes!” Thor answers. “In Asguard this would be about the age when a young girl would begin her training as a shield maiden. Thus,” He holds up the shield and hits his fist against it. “Her first shield.”
Mari climbs down from the chair and goes to the cabinet. When she opens the door there are thick scraps books and a single teddy bear. The bear is wearing a blue pea coat, boots, and shorts with red tights and gloves. On its face is a little black bandit mask. It smelled like dust and the clothes were a little tattered around the edges but the fur was soft and it still had all the buttons and eyes. She takes it out and brushes back the tuft of fur on the top of its head. “A teddy bear?”
Bucky chuckles and stops recording. He immediately sends it to Steve and Tony as a check in. Just as he hits send, he hears crying. His eyes shoot up to the sound to see a little boy sitting on the ground with three older boys standing over him.
“Tony. Tony!” Tony presses the up button the elevator and turns to Pepper with an arched brow. “Should I be alerting security?”
Okay, Bucky had to admit he wasn’t exactly happy she had hurt the kid. Yeah he had it coming but the kid didn’t look much older than Mari. He couldn’t blame her for knowing how to win a fight though. It was more than what Steve knew back in the day.
“Do you want me to eat the eggs or watch this gross amount of semipublic affection?” Mari asks, looking up. “I can’t do both.”
“Jet.” He grunts as he struggles to load a particularly spirited agent into the back of a prison transport.
“As you wish Doll,” Steve speaks against Tony’s stomach making the muscles quiver. He moves down and mouths at the outline of Tony’s half erect cock. As Tony groans Steve reaches up to massage his husband’s balls causing him to arch up into the warm wet mouth.
Bucky throws his body against the door so the lock on the other side snaps off. He comes out into a cluttered cellar with sectioned off storage areas. After a cursory glance, he slides a shelving unit in front of the door. Then he makes his way up the stairs and out into the lobby of an apartment building. He nods to a little old lady collecting her mail as he heads out the door and gives a soft, “Ma’am.” He stuffs his hands in his pockets and strolls down the street. He only makes it to the next alley when a hand shoots out, grabs the strap on the bag he’s carrying, and pulls him off the street. He moves with the motion, using his momentum to swing around and slip out of the strap.
Steve purses his lips. The news of Tony’s coma was made public a little over 5 months ago. A catastrophic fight with Victor von Doom had led to an enormous explosion of bright blue light in the middle of the Sahara. According to the news, all the sand within a five-mile radius of the place had turned to shimmering glass. Tony and von Doom had been found on opposite ends of the circle, a bit singed but otherwise physically fine.
The thousands of photos documenting the evening show Tony in his element: stirring the pot. He twirls over the dance floor with an immaculate Pepper Potts and wraps a grinning Colonel Rhodes in his flag like a burrito. Most of the pictures are of him and Steve together. In them, Tony is gesticulating wildly, while Steve gazes at him with the softest, most fond exasperation ever documented. Tony savours that expression like the first cup of coffee in the morning.
Because, Steve knows of this hearing, has seen summaries of it in reports and has watched parts of it on YouTube. Okay maybe he watched all of it. In his defense, though, it was
“Maybe,” Wanda answers, but she doesn’t sound too sure, “when I touched the barrier, it felt like it was trying to… pull me in. Swallow me. I think I could maybe send someone in.”
Before he can think it through properly - and hasn’t that always been his curse? - Steve says, “I don’t get it.”
“Well, probably behind that door,” Tony says innocently and as soon as he does, Steve sees a door materialise between them.
And anyway, people say, both have been spotted on dates with women before. Pictures of Steve and Sharon, start circling and later of him and Peggy. Those last ones are painful. Then old videos of Tony start showing up, ones where he’s so drunk he can barely stand, but he somehow still manages to kiss a beautiful woman. This
A bit of additional research (perks of having Natasha on their side) had led to Tony’s medical files. According to those, there’s distinctive brain activity, but no consciousness. It’s not even clear if the coma was caused by the strange blast that hit Tony, or by the long fall after he was hit.
The hospital is surprisingly quiet at this time of night. Somehow, Steve still associates these places with cold grey bed sheets and the swishing skirts of nurses. Modern hospitals seem colder still. He looks over his shoulder at his companion. Wanda seems at least as uncomfortable as he is, and he can’t help but wonder what horrible things she’s seen done in places like these. He gives her an encouraging smile. She doesn’t return it.
Tony frowns, but doesn’t look at Steve. Instead, he focuses on following the course of a wire in a brilliantly ugly shade of purple.
“I would not be able to get you out. Minds are fragile things…. You might get trapped, you might do more damage.”
Steve supposes he should be happy his friend is so famous. He should be happy for the incessant bulletins and paparazzi that paid no mind to Colonel Rhodes’ pleas for privacy and instead ran every possible story about Iron Man’s situation. Without them, he would never even have known this was happening.
To everyone’s surprise, she’d agreed. In fact, there had only been one person to disagree. Bucky had been adamant about not wanting anything to do with, in his words, ‘
. But he wisely keeps his mouth shut on that thought. Besides, it’s not like Tony ever needs prompting to talk.
Steve wonders if she’s just saying that, or if she felt something in him, because as soon as she says it, all his previous anger clamps down on his heart again. He
A hiss sounds through the room, and the red light disappears. Steve looks up to find Wanda frowning, rubbing her fingers together absentmindedly.
). Wanda seems thoroughly unimpressed, though to be honest, that seems to just be what her face is like most of the time. “I can help him.”
A few seconds of silence stretch between them (apart from another disembodied voice which speaks in what Steve
The next morning, Clint saunters into kitchen during breakfast, with an enormous, shit-eating grin across his face. That, in and of itself, usually means trouble, but this time the sharpshooter is also hiding something behind his back, making trouble a certainty. From his seat at the table, Steve eyes Clint with no small measure of distrust, spoon full of porridge stilling halfway to his mouth. Next to him, Natasha seems to have noticed the grin, too. There’s something dangerously close to a smile on her face. She just loves a bit of trouble.
One more look in Wanda’s direction, a short non-verbal conversation. She knows what to do if this all goes wrong. He takes a deep breath, reminds himself this is all worth it, then strides up to the guard like he owns the place.
“What? This?” Tony asks, waving at the strange contraption in front of him, “Don’t worry. I don’t even get it, and it’s my brain.”
“But!” Tony continues, grabbing something from his pocket and showing it off with about as much pride as Rafiki had while holding Simba up in the air, “I found this usb stick - which is très retro, by the way, haven’t used these things in at least a decade - and when I plug it in…”
“Yeah. I’ve been here a while and I’ve scoured just about every inch of this place. I keep hearing these disembodied voices saying things like ‘coma’ and ‘neurons’,” Tony says, then points at the screen, “And when I turn that thing on I get this sort of... static.”
Tony is already halfway across the room, making images appear around him like some kind of magician.
Tony freezes. When he looks up he seems closed off, like he’s shut the blinds and no one can look in anymore. Steve’s impressed at how well he can mask his emotions in his own head. When he speaks, his voice is clipped and businesslike.
century, was afraid that people’s opinions would be so much worse. Being openly called gay in a newspaper used to be something of a death sentence, but these days it seems he has to prove that he’s not straight. So much of his life has been spent trying to prove that he was as much a man as guys two times his size, it feels strange, now, to have confirmation of it coming from all sides.
He can admit though, it’s frustrating to hear people say he can’t possibly be in love with a man because he doesn’t seem gay. It
“I have no idea. I tried to make sense of all this before you arrived, but I couldn’t really figure it out. ‘S far as I can tell, it’s completely random.”
Logically, he knows this can never be the same Stark Expo he’d wandered all those years ago. Not with the Iron Man dancers, not in the head of a man who wouldn’t come into being until decades later. It feels strange though, being here. An echo of an echo of an echo, sounding through time, tying him and Bucky and the Starks together. So many little coincidences that led a scrawny boy from Brooklyn to the strange brainscape of a genius billionaire.
Tony gives him a look that suggests he believes Steve has the brain content of a pancake, which is just plain annoying really. He’s not a stupid person. In fact, he has it on good authority that his intelligence is actually above average (for both humans and pancakes) but when he’s with Tony he always ends up feeling like an idiot.
“I’m only part of the brain, remember. And not the mechanic-slash-genius part.” He sends Steve one of those smirks he hates and adds, “Clearly, I’m much more handsome. And I don’t spend all my time wasting away in a lab.”
The next few days are marked by a series of press conferences about what has been informally dubbed ‘Ass-gate’. Both Tony and Steve come out as bisexual at a press conference and confirm their relationship in front of hundreds of journalists. Aside from Tony’s ill-timed quips (the ones that secretly always make Steve smile) and some hate mail from certain religious and nationalistic groups, it all seems to be going down surprisingly well.
The door they’re looking for is looms ahead, guarded by a burly man in a suit. Steve thanks whatever deity is available that it’s not Happy Hogan because then just the sight of Wanda and him would be enough to sound the alarm. This isn’t anyone he’s ever met before.
“So there’s nothing you can do?” Steve asks, while violently repressing the urge to run his hand through Tony’s hair.
“Ooh, language, Captain!” Tony whispers, but somehow he looks hornier than Steve has ever seen him. Before his boyfriend gets a chance to dive into a horny rant, Steve is pulling him in for a kiss.
Steve clenches his jaw to keep silent, and instead waves a hand between Tony and the machine, indicating for him to press the button. Tony does so impassionately, with none of the excitement he showed before.
Most of what Tony did made his teeth grind, but not this video. Fast friendship, attitude and a man named Stark: that was something he could get behind.
know that! And they should too! It’s not like this is the first time I’ve slept with a guy, I haven’t exactly been secretive about it,” he squints over at Steve, “Why aren’t you more offended? They’re straight up saying you lied during the press conference.”
For all that’s changed over the past few years, that hasn’t. Tony still drives Steve crazy with almost everything he does and yet that very same thing makes him feel like he’s home. All this time spent apart, spent as enemies, even, has made him feel lost. Drifting through a world that no longer makes sense.
He’s so caught up in his musings, it takes him a while to realise that he’s speaking - not purposefully, not his own words. He sounds like Tony, feels his mouth move along with the words. When his hands go up it’s without his consent and then he sees they’re not his hands at all. They’re Tony’s.
The overload of information takes Steve aback for a moment, but then he remembers where he is. This is Tony’s brain, and frankly this is exactly what he had expected it to look like: organised chaos.
“Well, to be fair,” he says, from his perch by the desk where he’s trying to sketch the scene in front of him, “You aren’t gay. You’re bisexual.”
From his place at the counter, Tony is still completely unbothered, “Why, what are the papers accusing me of this time?”
Dread pools in Steve’s stomach. Maybe he was right when he considered brain damage. Tony Stark not knowing how circuits work: Steve had thought he’d see hell freeze over before that happened.
There’s something terrifying about it, about being stuck in this body with no control over it, forced to watch this scene play out. He sees what Tony saw, hears what Tony heard, feels what Tony felt.
For a minute, Steve just stares at the journalist as if waiting for the punchline of a joke. It doesn’t come. How thick is this guy? How thick is America? They’re out here in bisexual pride flags, hell, Steve is out there groping Tony in public and giving out statement about his sexuality. And still some people won’t believe he’s dating a man, because he…. Doesn’t look gay enough?
Just then, in the middle of remembering how, on one particular occasion, she had smiled at him so prettily, with her deep red lips and dark eyes, and had he just wanted to
“Yeah,” Steve took one last look at the long, sleek casket that held his first love, and turned away. He smiled at Tony. “I’m in.”
They had gone for hotdogs, then proceeded to take a ferry, go to a museum, and the Statue of Liberty. In truth, he had thought spending so much time in Tony’s company would be awkward, but it never happened. At one point, Coulson even appeared, and walked around with them for a while. Neither of them mentioned how much they had disliked each other on sight, and it was easy to imagine that the fight between them hadn’t even occurred. Tony handed him a StarkPhone at the end of the day (“Much better than that piece of crap SHIELD gave you,” Tony scoffed.), told him that there were only seven contacts in the phone, and, in case he had been wondering—which he hadn’t—Tony was speed-dial number one.
They stepped gradually, back, then to the side, then forward, and to the side again. The whole thing was leisurely paced, partly because Steve was trying not to stumble or step on Peggy’s slippered feet, and partly because Peggy was too old to move any quicker than the speed they were going.
“Tony, was there something you wanted?” Steve had a vague idea of what Tony was referring to, but he didn’t think it was proper to ask for clarification in case it had something to do with…fondue.
Steve bit his lip and picked it up. Slowly, he unfolded the slip, ready to see the name of what cemetery she was buried in.
Steve would hate to be in Peggy’s position. She had left her life in England to be with the man she loved and to raise a family, and the ones that were still alive didn’t come see her.
“We should drink to the fair maiden’s departure from this world.” Thor announced in the loud, grandiose way he did most things.
When he opened his eyes, he felt marginally better. He gathered the papers he had spread across his bed, then put them in a stack. He didn’t want to read the exact details of his friends lives now—at least, the parts that weren’t SHIELD classified—but he would eventually.
He recognized her instantly. Even though she had long turned grey, and her piercing brown eyes had been tinged with milky white. Even though she was much more frail, and was sitting in a wheelchair. The determined glint in her eyes, the strong set of her jaw, gave it away. It was Peggy. His Peggy.
Tony paused, fingers mid-swipe, and squinted up at him. “Huh, you really are from the forties, aren’t you, Capsicle? I don’t even think my grandparents talk like that—well, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t even if I had grandparents. Look, don’t worry about it. It’s all been taken care of, and you’ll have your own customized room in no time.” Steve’s protests were brushed off when he heard those words, and Tony continued on. “The room you had at SHIELD was so empty and white, I wanted to take my repulsors to them, just to see something on the walls. Whoever decided on the colour scheme of that place really needs to be fired. Besides, Coulson will be here, too, mainly so he can gush at you from up close instead of from afar, like he normally does in that creepy stalker-ish way he does most things when you’re involved—”
It had been three weeks since Steve had been allowed to leave SHIELD. Since then, he’d finally had the chance to look around New York properly. (Going through Time Square was still a bit of an issue, though.) After Tony had all but forced him to stay in Stark Tower
Steve glanced back down at his sketch. It was simple, just a few glaciers and a span of ice that made up the ground. But there was an area in the ground where the ice jutted awkwardly, as if something large had plunged through it. It was how he had imagined the aftereffect of his dive into the Arctic would look to an observer.
He recalled Tony’s treatment of him, how welcoming but distant he had been during Steve’s first few weeks in the Tower, and how he had warmed up to him. He had still been his snarky self, and they still fought, but sometimes Tony would do something or say something that Steve knew only he was privy to; and it only caused Steve to fall more in love with him. They were close, closer to each other than to the other Avengers, and closer, Steve admitted, than he had been with Bucky.
“Cap? Hey, Cap! You’ve got be breathe, Steve!” Tony gave him a firm shake, causing him to blink several times. “You have got to stop doing that. You’re a super solider, not a human-fish mutant, or whatever.”
But to him, it wasn’t too long ago that they had talked, made plans, and he had wanted to—when the war was over he had planned on—
In the time that had passed, Steve had learned many things. Though he had held off for a while, he had eventually taken the initiative to ask Jarvis to locate the graves of his friends, (since, for some odd reason, they hadn’t been included in the files Fury had given him) one at a time. He had visited them, prayed over their graves, and left. For each one he visited, it was nonsensically hard to take the first steps towards finding which exact headstone was theirs, but by the time he left, another tiny piece of Steve—a part of him that desperately longed for the comfort of all he had known—was stripped away. It left him a little bare, but feeling lighter.
“Are they all from Pepper?” He asked, wrinkling his nose. “Because if they are, you can go ahead and delete them. She really needs to get used to how I run my company.”
“Nah, it’s cool,” Tony waved a hand, much like Peggy had earlier, as they stepped outside. “Old people give me hives and other unmentionable side effects, especially when they’re all former SHIELD agents.”
“Sorry, you’re not really my type.” Tony turned to Natasha, who merely arched a brow. He blanched. “I don’t like being stabbed, so I’m not going to say anything about how your dirty boots are ruining the cushions.”
Steve liked to think he was adjusting the future pretty well—certainly better than Thor, who, after three months in the Tower, still didn’t know how to cook something without smashing or burning being involved—but Jarvis never failed to make him feel slightly unsettled during their first few seconds of conversation, especially when he started one out of nowhere. Like now.
A good two and a half weeks had gone by since Clint and Natasha had come over to drop his bag off and just decided to stay
Steve smiled and began cleaning up. In some odd sort of way, he had become comfortable here, in the Tower, with the others. And he convinced himself that, even if Coulson did remember in the morning, and it turned out Peggy was in England, buried somewhere, he wouldn’t be too broken up about it because he had his team—his
He blinked, startled by the sudden shout, and turned his head to see Clint standing in the doorway. He was grinning big, and when their eyes met, he beckoned for Steve to get up.
“What are you doing here?” He asked a bit rudely, switching the small bag he held to his other hand.
“Ms. Romanoff entered an override code,” the AI answered crisply. “I had no choice but to let her inside, sir.”
So Steve told her from the beginning, leaving nothing out, what had happened when he had woken up. He told her about the fake room he had awoken in, to bursting outside and straight into Time Square. How he had been tested for days and restricted from leaving SHIELD until they allowed him, and how, even after he was allowed, he didn’t want to. He told her about the Avengers, described each one of them in detail, right from the moment he met each one of them. She listened seriously as he told her about The Avengers Initiative, and laughed lightly when he told her about their wild crazy times at Stark Tower, where everyone had their own specially designed rooms on separate floors, yet most nights of the week they ended up falling asleep on the living room furniture sprawled across one another. And he told her about Tony.
“GAH!” He turns away again and back to the super computer and the tech attempting to break through Stark’s security. “I should have hired your brother instead. At least Kraven is capable of following orders to the letter.”
Business it is then. “Clint did some digging and found that he came into the country through an airfield owned by a shell company associated with the Maggia. It’s also only a few miles from the coordinates we got from your Gorgon files.”
While he was still holding out his phone she reaches over and opens his email. The bar across the top of the screen lights up and then his inbox was flooded with unread emails. The most recent one being from Tony with the subject line “Stay out of penthouse; Important guests”. He lets out a small oh.
“Ha! I would never sign off on such insane risks, but you should feel free to engage in any crazy behavior you like.” Dr. Wu takes an x ray that an assistant hands him and holds it up to the light. “Besides, from what I hear, Ironman has not been jumping into battle as often as he used to.” The doctor gives him a sideways glance with a small smile on his face.
Tony rubbed the excess gel into his hands and tilts his head to look her. “You know what, screw ‘em.”
“Don’t think you’re getting out of explaining by making me all hot and bothered soldier boy.” Tony says in between slow languid kisses.
Steve gets up and takes a step to follow her but pauses when Tony only stands and stays rooted to the spot by his seat.
“I am afraid I cannot access that information sir. Something seems to be locking up all systems related to the tower.”
Steve gives Tony a smirk before taking his hand and pulling him down the hallways the caseworker leads them down. After a few turns that take them into the middle of the building they come to a nursery. The room is filled with whining infants and young toddlers that still wobble on unsteady legs. The two heroes interact with the kids. Steve is a natural that soon has the little ones tugging at him for attention. Tony is awkwardly bouncing the first baby he is given before it spews spit up onto his suit. His face scrunches up in horrified disgust and he stills.
“It’s hardly surgery. Just a small procedure. She didn’t even stay in the hospital when she originally got it inserted. She’ll be okay.”
“Not effectively.” To demonstrate her point she jumps up and down and wiggles the arm he is holding like a limp noodle.
They all jump up from their seats, Bucky pulling out a knife. They relax when they see Clint peering out of the air vent at them.
“Well no…I was just kind of hoping this would happen when she was older…and able to mostly look after herself…”
Something about the way he says it resonates which Steve, makes him think of SHIELD and HYDRA, of the enormous machine that is the American military apparatus. It makes him think of 200 punches straight to Hitler’s nose. He’d drawn himself as a monkey on a unicycle back then, these days he might have drawn his face in the gears of a large watch: a man out of time turning around and around in a never-changing direction.
Steve wants to be more irritated but when he looks back at his friend it’s to find him staring at the door, a strange expression on his face. He looks almost… sad. The emotion looks wrong against his carefully crafted look of nonchalance.
Steve feels a small smile turning his own lips as he nods in agreement. Tony turns back to the contraption, fingers tapping on his chest where the arc reactor used to be. The movement is so achingly familiar that Steve barely hears Tony’s next words.
“I think whatever put me in this coma did more than just knock me out. I think it shattered me into different pieces. Not to mention,” he says, pointing at the screen again, “It’s using Windows XP, so whatever it is
Something inside him snaps. He gives the interviewer a sickly-sweet smile. A brighter man might have run at the sight of it.
over on his rolling chair, braking by grabbing onto Steve’s shoulders. The look on his face is somehow both sweet and horny.
Before Steve can so much as think the word ‘no’, Tony is grabbing his arm and, in one vicious move, pulling down the lever attached to that purple wire.
“No, I don’t mean that. Though, I don’t get that either. I mean, I don’t understand how you went from not allowing the government to take your suit to allowing them to have control over us a few years later.”
“So, what is it?” Steve asks. He wants to touch it but he’s afraid it might suddenly come to life (and considering whose mind he’s in, that fear isn’t at all unreasonable).
They’ve just successfully taken down a bad guy, and the whole team is high on victory. Around them, journalists are already crowding to the be first ones to get the scoop, the cameras high and dry, the microphones right up in the Avengers’ faces. For once, Steve doesn’t mind the attention. After all, the streets may still be knee-deep in weird sludge, but the a madman who made the sludge is being loaded into a SHIELD helicarrier and all the buildings are miraculously whole. All the
“Looks like we’re doing a tour of Tony Stark’s Greatest Hits,” he says and here’s an amused look on his face, and when he turns to meet Steve’s gaze it grows into a smug little smirk.
Most of the second half of that speech goes right over Steve’s head but he nods as if he understands because he’s very much trying to avoid being looked at like a pancake again. More important though, is the fact that Tony has a working theory.
It takes Steve a second to remember what it is he does, because Tony is busy being very distracting. He hops onto Steve’s lap, puts a finger under his chin and angles it up so he can plant a soft kiss on his lips. Then he moves down slowly, marking each inch with a small butterfly kiss. Steve’s eyes flutter closed at the touch of those soft lips on his neck, each kiss a bolt of the very best kind of static electricity. Just as Steve’s fingers are starting to tangle in Tony’s hair, the kisses stop. Steve opens disappointed eyes to see his boyfriend pulling back, a distant look in his eyes.
- did I ever show you that movie? I can’t remember, but if I didn’t you should definitely check it out. Anyway, this, all of this, is so fucking crazy. Seriously. I am consciously experiencing the workings of my own mind. Usually this all just kind of…” Tony waves his hands vaguely, “
“Still calling the shots, huh Cap?” Tony says and his smile seems caught somewhere between fond and violently sharp. “Let’s go put Humpty together again.”
Steve helps him out of the car, then takes his arm so they can walk the red carpet together, as if they were both born to do this. And for a moment, for them, it feels like they were.
The billionaire steps out wearing high stiletto heels, a mesh shirt and purple pants that have the words
It hits him suddenly what this is. It’s a memory. Tony’s memory. And it’s replaying the only way it knows how: from Tony’s perspective.
Tony squints dangerously, “What, you just decided to risk your freedom to visit me? That’s a pretty stupid thing to do.”
Having never studied psychology, Steve isn’t sure if what Tony is mentioning is normal, but he can certainly say it’s true for himself. Thoughts usually come and go without rhyme nor reason and he wouldn’t even know where to start guessing what the inside of his brain looks like. Then again, he’s not sure he even wants to know. Seeing the workings of someone else’s brain is strange enough, the thought of seeing his own is terrifying.
Steve wants to scream, but then the world explodes into a cold, electric place, where words don’t exist. No, not a place. A non-place. A place where space doesn’t exist, where
“You know,” he says eventually, with a bit less swagger than he’s been giving since Steve woke up, “This is very
Two years of watching his best friend through a television screen, and not a second of that ever felt as real as this.
“Is this gay enough, America?” Tony asks loudly. His eyes are cheeky over the brim of his glasses, but his smile is razor sharp.
“Can I have your attention?” asks the one in the middle. There’s a plaque in front of him marking him as Senator Stern.
Tony seems to think about it for a moment, eyes darting over the intricate pattern of lines beneath them. The ‘mechanic’ part may be separated, but there’s obviously still enough of a genius left in the man. A dangerous little smile flits over his face and Steve instinctively knows, with a sudden, gut-wrenching certainty that the man is about to do something stupid.
He’s missed humorous back-and-forths before missions and deep talks on the compound roof. He’s missed coming home from his morning run to find Tony drinking coffee almost straight from the pot. Heck, he’d take the fighting over the silence between them these days.
Because, plastered across the front page of the New York Times, is a photo of Steve very clearly groping Tony’s ass.
Before Steve even has time to take it all in properly, fireworks go off behind him, and with them the world twists back out of focus, spinning back from black and red into the same white and blue emptiness that brought him here.
Because, though Tony and Steve have been an item for almost three months now, they haven’t made it public yet.
The kiss is full of heat and pent up frustration, but their hands are gentle and their bodies slot together as if they’re both part of a bigger whole. Despite the camera flashes and the scandalised looks, Steve has never felt more at home.
Steve freezes as soon as he realises what he’s done. Tony jerks in surprise, swinging his head around to survey his boyfriend with one raised brow and a smirk so dirty it makes Steve want to compulsively scrub something (that dick) clean. Instead, Steve acts like nothing happened, moving his hand up to a more appropriate body part and turning back to the cameras.
“Mr. Rogers, can I get a comment on the rumours that your alleged relationship with Tony Stark is a marketing scheme chosen by your employers?” he asks.
Though Steve tries to keep his face impassive, something must have changed because Tony pulls his glasses dramatically from his nose and uses one of the legs to point at him.
“Really? Great,” Tony says with a smug smile, “I mean. I’m in a coma, we don’t know why, we don’t know how to get me out, and on top of that I’ve got a juiced up supersoldier galavanting around in my brain. But at least I finally managed to knock Doom out.”
Wanda’s eyes flicker between Steve and the bed. Deep down he knows she’ll say yes. For all her bravado, she is disturbingly easily influenced by him. She trusts him implicitly (and sometimes too much, he fears). Besides, he knows she enjoys using her powers as much as he enjoys punching a sandbag - there’s nothing quite like flexing muscles you didn’t always have.
“Right. Well, I’m here to help you get out. Guess we just have to find the part of you that can fix things.”
Steve opens his eyes to Tony's goatee floating a few inches from his face. He's about to scream when he realises that the goatee is actually attached to a chin, which is attached to a head, which is attached to a man.
“I suppose I could put someone’s mind in his. But we do not know what would happen then and I do not think I could get anyone back. They would be sucked in.”
“Did Doom at least get hit, too? If that arrogant bastard managed to put me in a coma without getting hurt himself, I swear I’m retiring. I’m not sure my fragile ego could stand the humiliation. I can already see the papers…”
Immediately, Steve feels like he’s been thrown back in time. He remembers walking through the crowd below, Bucky leading the way, with his latest conquest by his side. He remembers looking up at the great spinning globe in awe, flinching when Howard Stark’s flying car crashed to the ground.
All the frustration he’s been hearing in Tony for the past week, the frustration that culminated in the outfit for this event, comes rushing into Steve all at once.
“If the levers lead to memories, maybe the buttons lead to something else? It’s gotta be worth a try right?”
So, Natasha had gone to get the files, Steve had read them and then he’d convinced Wanda to come here with him. He hadn’t been sure she’d agree at first. The relationship between Tony and her has always been strained. Blame and mistrust have been thrown between them in some ridiculous form of emotional tennis. Not exactly the kind of relationship that would lead to her risking her life for the man.
The door opens soundlessly and gives way to an ethereal, dark blue space. It looks endless: a glistening floor stretching into the distance and on it, a web of lighter blue lines winding forever beneath their feet. Steve is immediately reminded of the reactor Tony used to have in his chest. All the lines seem to converge in the middle, where they connect to a strange machine engulfed in a mess of wires.
Steve eyes the machine. From one look alone, he’s counting at least nine buttons in various colours, as well as several levers that all seem connected to the wires. Even for Tony, this looks unnecessarily complicated.
Suddenly, Natasha’s hand is on his shoulder and he looks up, hoping for some kindness. Or at least some common sense.
He’s seated on a rolling chair in the middle of his lab surrounded by blue holographs of things Steve doesn’t recognise. There’s grease all over him and his hair is an absolute mess, but the way the blue light falls over him is so beautiful it almost makes Steve cry.
“I know, it’s insane! I can remember knowing how, but every time I try to actually do something with the information, it all seems to disappear.”
Wanda shakes her head, “There is some kind of… barrier. I cannot see or hear anything, but I can feel something inside.”
“I’m sure I can convince him to come out, I’m his -” He had wanted to say ‘friend’, but echoes of Siberia still haunt him (
here? It’s Tony’s head, of that much Steve is certain, but he’s confused by his surroundings. The clean, cold white of the space, the emptiness; it’s not at all what Steve had expected his friend’s legendary brain to look like on the inside. He’d expected more… well, more. More technology, certainly, more thoughts swirling to and fro. This is just a blank canvas and that worries Steve. What if the thing that hit Tony somehow erased part of his brain? What if that’s why he isn’t mentioning the Accords?
As Steve starts talking, he sees Tony approach from the corner of his eye. The billionaire has left his scratched-up armour behind and is dressed only in a tight fitting bodysuit that he seems to live in sometimes. Steve doesn’t mind that one bit because, well, his boyfriend is in really good shape. When he reaches Steve, he throws an arm around him while shooting him a cheeky grin. Steve can’t help but smile back. He’s happier than he can ever remember being.
As Tony pulls him closer, Steve does what he always does: he cups his boyfriend’s ass and squeezes. It’s a movement so practiced, so natural, that he doesn’t even have to think about it anymore. Except… They’re not usually out in public when he does this, nor are they usually surrounded by so many cameras. Sometimes, Steve can still hear Bucky’s voice in the back of his head, telling him to
Tony moves forward as if this all normal, stopping in front of the machine in the middle and running his fingers over various wires. A barrage of numbers runs right through him and he doesn’t seem to notice. When it passes by Steve, he feels static tickling his arms. A disembodied voice (which sounds suspiciously like JARVIS) cries out an indignant ‘sir!’
The world dissolves again and Steve spends his time in that timeless place thinking about how much he hates fighting with Tony.
“That’s probably because I’m not working on figuring it out,” Tony says and he’s probably right, but Steve doesn’t like arrogance on a good day (and this is a
Before he can ponder any further, the courtroom dissolves and he’s once again thrown into the dark blue room with the strange machine.
Right. Well, that does complicate things. Steve stares at the mess of wires and takes Tony in from the corner of his eye. He looks more like himself here than he ever did on camera, and Steve’s glad to see it. Still, there’s something kind of… unfinished about this version of Tony. Something Steve can’t quite put his finger on.
A moment of silence falls over them as they both look anywhere but at each other. It hasn’t escaped Steve that this is the first conversation they’ve had in a long time, and while he hates the glib, businessman side of Tony that his friend’s brain has conjured, he can’t help feeling strangely at home. He’s also glad to hear Tony hasn’t forgotten about their fight, and for now, he’s happy to not have to mention it. They have a job to do.
A courtroom. Flashing cameras. Strange faces, and between them: Pepper Potts. She makes a circular motion with her finger, tells him to turn and he does.
trying to torture me into insanity. I’ve done my time with XP! Three years of it! At MIT! And now, when I’m at my
And there had been something very Bucky-esque about Tony, too. The easy sass, the smarmy smile and that ‘stick-it-to-the-man’ attitude that Steve will admire to his dying day. He’d been very lonely back then: a man out of time who had only just discovered the magic of typing something into a search bar and having a whole world of information pop up.
“What do they mean I can’t be gay?” he whines, while waving dramatically at the headlines that hang in the air before him, “I’m too ‘manly’ to be gay? Do you know how hard my father would laugh at me being called ‘too manly’? And what does that even
The world disassembles again, but this time Steve knows what to expect, so he lets it befall him with a disgruntled sort of acceptance.
The screen comes to life as soon as Tony mentions it, and indeed it is completely dark save for shifting lights and spots of colour that appear and disappear seemingly at random. It reminds Steve immediately of what he sees when he rubs his eyes too hard.
“I won’t,” Steve assures, as he leans forward and rests his hand on hers, “I need to do this, Wanda. I can’t just sit around and do nothing while he wastes away.”
“I’ve been trying to hack into the screen to see if I could find out what the hell was going on, but it’s not going too well. It’s almost like I’ve forgotten how wires and circuits work.”
“You know,” Tony continues, in an almost conspiriatory tone this time, “A while ago, I could have sworn I saw a Wanda-shaped blob of red on the screen.”
“I would like to reiterate that I am bisexual and that by the end of the night, I will be sucking Tony Stark’s dick,” he says, “And you may quote me on that.”
At the next Avengers event, Steve steps out of a black limousine wearing a tasteful purple-blue suit with a pink tie. A small pride flag is pinned onto his lapel. The coy smile on his face makes everyone wonder if he’s sitting on some kind of secret. Maybe it’s something to do with his date for the night. Ever the gentleman, he walks around to the other side of the car to open the door for her.
Steve hesitates near the foot of the bed. It’s been two years since he laid eyes on this man. Two years since they were even in one room together. Two years of silence, of shame, of anger and regret.
Steve sends her a soft smile. He knows the rift between the Avengers weighs on her as well. The lack of contact between her and Vision… It can’t be easy. He was one of the few people who never judged her for her decision to join HYDRA, something rare even within their current team.
For a moment, Steve considers starting the argument anyway. He’s never been one to back down and this version of Tony - the CEO, the billionaire, the media’s favourite star - has always managed to bring out the worst in Steve. But Tony’s right. A fight might do serious damage to an already fractured brain.
But it’d been almost five months by that point. Steve couldn’t see any other way, and the others knew him well enough to tell he wasn’t going to let this go.
Steve grabs a folding chair from up against a wall and sits down at the other side of the bed. With a look of concentration, red tendrils start appearing like a spider’s web along Wanda’s fingers. They creep slowly towards Tony’s face, their glow casting strange shadows along his goatee. Steve is transfixed by the sight of it.
Steve drops his head into his hands. Maybe he can just dive back into the arctic and come back in 70 years when this has all blown over. Maybe then he can find friends who are
“Oh, untwist your panties, Captain Moody. You have to admit that was kind of fun, telling those guys to stick it. Even you must have enjoyed that.”
“Maybe we should just explore the room?” he suggests (anything to keep Tony away from potentially dangerous, red buttons),  “There might be some answers hidden here somewhere.”
“I don’t know how to get there, remember? Because I don’t know how this,” Tony points angrily at the machine, “
“Are all centenarians so dramatic? There was no other way to test it, it’s like they say: sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.”
She may be right though, what if Tony doesn’t want to talk to him? What if his presence drives the man deeper into a coma? Then again, what if it works? Steve has never shied away from a risk in his life and he’s not about to start now.
He waits for the inevitable snarky remark or snort of laughter, but it doesn't come. Tony glances over at the screen and shrugs. “That makes a weird amount of sense actually.”
Oh no. Steve knows that look. It’s the epiphany look, the one that always leads to trouble. Steve grabs his boyfriend’s face with both hands, aiming the gaze back towards him (and hoping, maybe, to distract him with some spirited use of his tongue). He stills immediately when their eyes meet; because Tony’s are filled with a terrifying sort of madness.
For Steve, her decisions have never been difficult to understand. He did almost exactly what she did; let some less-than-savoury people experiment on him to win a war. And he didn’t even have the excuse of grief and revenge.
” Steve grinds through his teeth. Every second spent together is reminding him more and more why they had a falling out in the first place.
Steve, for his part, hasn’t moved since he first laid eyes on the headline. Homosexual relationships might be legal these days, but he isn’t naïve enough to think everyone in world will just accept this. And no one is taking this seriously. Not even Tony, who knows exactly how damaging something like this can be to your image. Especially not Tony. Clint and him are loudly one-upping each other with sexual innuendos.
And it’s a lot. Glittering lights, millions of faces, screaming voices, squealing repulsors, the unfamiliar weight of the arc reactor heavy on his chest, weariness, giddiness, drunkenness…
Steve snorts and tries to restrain his chuckle when he sees that the metal facets of Tony’s reactor have left red patterns on the side of her face.
“I was talking about an actual morning workout but I appreciate the offer.” He kisses along the column of his neck. “Maybe it’ll be best if you stay in bed. I’ll get you an ice pack before I start up.” He pulls himself from the bed with a loving pat to Tony’s sore rear end.
The hammering in his chest slows as he focuses on his husband’s voice. Steve rubs small circles with his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand watching him. When he feels the tightness in his chest ease he tangles his fingers in Steve’s shirt.
Steve laughs as the tension in the room breaks. “No. Not yet. She’s more of the mad scientist type. That toaster over there?” Steve points at the kitchen counter. “Our third one since she got here. And it’s not like we can reprimand her for it because the minute Tony sees she’s poking around something electronic, he’s right there with her. Pokin’ away. They’ve built two toaster robots.”
Tony tries to stifle his laugh as Steve says, “I already let you sleep in for an extra hour. Time for breakfast and your medicine.”
“Yeah! Your turn!” She runs her fingers through his hair and he feels her shape it into what he is pretty sure is a Mohawk.
Steve sighs. “Okay. How about this: Mari wants to build a rocket. Not a bottle rocket, a real rocket. I checked.”
Mari’s eyes widen and she throws the toy back at the therapist. She shakes her head and makes a small whining noise.
“Like y = [arccos(x)]^3. Or y = x2^(2x) + π^2.” She flips through the pages and finds more information and close up photos of a belt buckle. “FYI the answers to those are y’ = (-3(arccosx)^2)/((1-x^2)^(1/2)) and y’ = 2x (2x + (x^2)ln 2).”
Steve goes into the elevator and gives them one last wave before the doors close. Tony turns and sees Mari staring at him expectantly.
“Brilliant.” She writes something down on her board before smiling up at them. “Well, I’m done here. A nice, happy home.”
“Maybe next time.” Tony lifts Mari off the counter and onto the floor next to him. The second her feet touch the ground, she turns and gets up on her tip toes to look over the counter and at the screen.
He throws his arms up. “For not telling you that I was looking into Ben Paulson and Mae Parker. That I am still looking into them.”
