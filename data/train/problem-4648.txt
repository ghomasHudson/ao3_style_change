Cas brushes the ghost of a kiss against Dean’s lips and then he disappears.
“Um, did I? I don’t remember.”
November 2, 1983
And so when Cas shows up at the door a week later, swaying, with blood staining the back of his coat, Dean is there.
“The New York semi-finals are in March. That means if you’d like to participate, you need to register now so you’ll be ready with a variation in March. The YAGP offers scholarships to excellent schools all around the world and of course, our feeder dancer company, New York City Ballet, will be there, looking for stand-out competitors to join them. A dancer who already attends our School of American Ballet and can distinguish themselves onstage would be in an excellent position to be offered a corps or even a soloist position with NYCB.”
Balthazar is already lounging on his bed, munching on a bag of chips as he flips through a chemistry textbook. “Bad turn day, Cassie. Going to have to do better or old Hest will have your ass.”
Dean jerks awake to what sounds like screaming. He lies in bed, frozen in terror. He rolls over and locks eyes with Cas, who is just as tense.
“Dean, I have to go. I’ve been summoned.”
Dean is being abandoned. Again. Suddenly he’s reminded of the day Sam was born; the thick panic closing off his throat because everyone leaves.
Dean just nods, but before Cas can start, he grabs Cas’s hand and laces their fingers together. He feels safer when he’s touching Cas, like Cas is holding all his shattered pieces together.
“Dean.”
Dean manages to pry his eyes open to see Cas nearly nose to nose with him.
"Take your own advice and make plenty of burgers. You know how Sam always goes crazy about them.”
Dean throws back his covers, grabs Cas’s hand, and sprints out into the hallway. Daddy appears, holding Sammy, and now Dean can smell smoke. “Dean, take your brother outside as fast as you can and don’t look back! Go, Dean!” He pushes Sammy into Dean’s arms and Dean is more scared than he has ever been in his entire life.
When Dean pauses and wipes his mouth, he discovers Cas watching him intently. “Hello, Dean.”
But then Cas splays a hand against Dean’s shoulder like he’s trying to brand him and whispers, “You are worth it.” And Dean thinks that just maybe he believes him.
After a while, he’d look up to the sound of a quiet slur just as often as his name and then he’d hate himself, for letting them tattoo their ignorance into his psyche. So he’d let the words drown them out.
“Look at the stars.” Cas’s face is so awed that Dean looks up too.
If he gets cut from the program, there will be no more ballet.
But Cas surprises him by perking up like a sprout when the sun’s out. “May I? Stay with you more often?”
Cas wrinkles his nose. “I don’t know for certain. I also fell in love with you, as well as revealing my angelic status, so the angels may cast me down and I’ll become human. That’s probably the most likely scenario.”
“And when the responsibility for his little brother fell on this boy’s shoulders, the angel tried to be there for the boy, so he would know someone cared for him.Even if it was as simple as remembering his birthday when everyone else forgot.”
Cas lifts the edge of the blanket to reveal a sleepy Sammy waving chubby fists. “He’s beautiful, Dean, just like you.”
Dean thinks for a second. “I think I talked to her two days ago. She says she’s eight months in and everything is fine.”
Cas suggested they name the baby Matthew, and Dean agreed. He would never name his son after John and he had no other family. Cas said Matthew meant gift of God and Dean decided it fit. Dean even being alive right now was a gift.
Cas looks surprised but just squeezes Dean’s hand and starts talking.
After lunch, his classes are typically boring. They have the nerve to talk to him about the Oxford comma and its usage as if he didn’t memorize the standard punctuation marks at age eight when he was bored. Growing up with Zachariah and Naomi, he
Dean kisses him, light and soft. “Of course I feel the same way. I was just surprised.” But then Dean grits his teeth. Time to come clean. “I just—I thought you didn’t love me back. I made up Lisa. She never existed. I just didn’t want to tell you how I felt because I thought you would reject me. That and I thought you were imaginary.”
“Dean!” He plops himself down in a chair and takes Dean’s hand. “Are you OK?”
He jumps, abruptly yanked out of his musings, by the now-icy water hitting his bare skin. Castiel snaps off the shower, shivering slightly and grabs his towel, drying off as quickly as possible in the chilly locker room.
Dean rolls over and Cas is there, staring intently at him. Dean sighs because Cas must have snuck in again. Dean wonders why Cas’s mom doesn’t make him stop. “Cas, you gotta stop doing that. My mom might get mad if you keep sleeping over without her permission.”
Sam coughs and Dean turns back to his food. But before he does, Dean looks around.
After the révérance, Castiel slips off his ballet shoes and tucks them away in his dance bag, taking a long sip of water. Hester approaches, her neat blonde bun starting to fray apart after hours of dancing. “Castiel, I know you can do better. I’ve
Cas cringes. “I apologize. I never meant to tell you. But … you insisted. I should—I mean, I should go. I’m just going to go …”
“Bobby? Where are you? It’s John Winchester.” Dad knocks and then just picks the lock and opens the door. He’s greeted by a sawed-off shotgun in his face.
The clerk rolls his eyes, and Dean notices absently that his name tag says Alfie. “Yeah, I can see him.”
"We can't do this."
They pull up to Singer Auto Salvage Yard and Dad gets out. “C’mon, let’s go. I don’t have all day!”
“Boy. Wait, what?”
Dean fumbles for words under the weight of that sapphire gaze. “How long have you loved me?”
Hester cuts the music and the other dancers pause, looking around for the weak link. “Novak,” she calls and Castiel feels his shoulders tense in anticipation. “Get it together. I’ve seen better turns out of you.”
And somehow, Dean believes him.
Cas pulls away and Dean tenses just a little.
The tile floor is warm from the sunlight against Dean’s bare feet as he pulls out the thawed hamburger. He starts to mix in his signature seasoning (like hell he’ll ever tell Sam his recipe, no matter how much he begs), and sneaks a glance at Cas.
Might as well tell him the truth. “Because I couldn’t bear to live without you anymore.”
Dean grins. “OK. Where?”
Lying awake in his dark dorm room, the lights of the city painting dim shapes on his carpet, Castiel dreams.
Inside, the hallways are bustling with students, easily recognizable by their outfits and accessories. The drama students wear monochrome outfits, slouchy beanies, and thick eyeliner. Music kids tote around huge instruments in bulky cases and Castiel feels a spike of superiority that his only instrument is his own body.
November 20, 1983
She searches his eyes, eyes slightly skeptical. “I’d like to see it. You have potential, Castiel. Don’t throw it away because you got distracted.”
Cas doesn’t look convinced, though. “You’re lying.What can I do?”
No, no, no. Dean mentally shakes himself. Dean is straight. As in he likes girls. Only girls. No boys. Besides, Cas is imaginary. Cas is not real.
Dean folds his little brother, all grown up, into his arms and sternly tells himself not to cry. Sam needs to go, get away from Dad, learn new things that Dean can’t even dream of.
“MARY!”
Even though Castiel got dragged to church every single week and recited prayers every night in front of Naomi until he was ten, it never truly stuck.
Castiel loops his lanyard around his neck and grabs his water bottle, heading for the door.
And Dean doesn’t get to have good things. He’s a grunt. He helps Dad hunt and that’s all he’s ever going to do. Sam’s going to go to college and marry a beautiful wife and make bags of money. All Dean can see in his future is dying bloody at the claws of some monster. Futures are for people who are actually worth something.
“Seems like every time we talk, I end up in tears,” Dean remarks ruefully.
And here is Cas, looking at him like he’s actually worth something, like he actually cares what happens to him. Cas looks like he wants to give Dean the world. And Dean can’t stand it.
Dad stumbles in and Dean can tell that he’s drunk off his ass. Dad plops down on a bed and watches baseball with Dean for a minute. Then he says it: “Who’s Cas?”
A memory of Cas’s shy smile, of sky blue eyes looking at Dean up through tangled lashes, rises to the center of Dean’s mind. He ruthlessly shoves it back down. He can’t think of Cas right now or he’ll break.
Mommy passes Sammy’s car seat to Daddy and crouches down to Dean’s level. She cups his face, eyes full of concern. “I’m so sorry you had to wake up alone, baby. Everything just happened so fast. Are you okay?”
Dean checks his watch. “You know, Dad, it’s almost time to pick up Sam. I should go.” It’s only one o’clock, but Dean’s grasping at straws here.
“But all I do is make you upset.” Cas looks devastated and Dean thinks he sees a stray tear.
Dean actually smiles at that. “Pie. You know that, Cas. You’ve seen me chow down enough times.”
“You don’t know? Are you kidding me? Your brother is your responsibility, Dean! Try to get that through your thick skull! Apologize. Now!”
The rest of the class passes fairly quickly and Castiel focuses on doing his absolute best and giving his all in every combination, desperate to avoid any further mistakes.
Dean turns his back too, because he doesn’t know what his face looks like right now and Cas can’t see that Dean is just inches from rock bottom. So there they stand, each facing away from the other and with a gap of about three feet between them. No chance of us touching, Dean muses bitterly.
“John, that’s your job. You’re his father; it’s your damn responsibility to keep him safe.” Bobby’s voice is steadily getting louder.
Mommy says goodnight too, but then Dean hears, “Hey, Dean.” He runs toward his daddy because Daddy has been gone all day at the garage and Dean can’t wait to tell him all about his day.
His headphones keep cutting out because he desperately needs a new phone but some music is better than dead silence. His playlist is an eclectic mix of classical pieces that he memorizes for variations, riot grrl and heavy metal music for motivation, and the occasional pop song because Taylor Swift is a talented musician and she deserves to be respected outside of her traditional niche as an artist who caters to tween girls and he’s willing to fight about it with anyone who asks.
“S-sir? C-can…” Cas shivers uncontrollably and stops. “C-come, sir?”
The door slowly swung open and Jess left the room, giving them all smiles. Sam followed her. Charlie and Benny hesitantly left the luxurious room, shutting the doors behind them. Castiel emerged from the bathroom shyly. Dean watched him as his omega slowly laid down beside Dean, cuddling up to him.
Dean can see the subtle bucking of his hips up, legs closed around his wrist. He’s gorgeous, in the garden and in the light, and he’s Dean’s.
Jess walks outside, chatting pleasantly with Cas about her newest painting. She’s as big as a house, but glowing. Cas is carrying Cathryn’s infant seat. He sets her down carefully and Dean leans down to peek at his one-year-old niece. She’s sleeping peacefully, and Dean strokes her blond wisps of hair before moving away to fix his plate.
A nasty voice inside of him whispers, So you’re allowed to get it up for a stranger, but not Cas. The worst part is that Dean knows just what kind of bullshit logic that is. The fact that Dean even kinda enjoyed it makes him feel even more despicable.
Cas nods. “That’s great. Is she still sure?”
Benny just sighs ruefully. “Yeah, you kinda are.”
But Cas is shoving Dean toward the stairs and Dean finally manages to move his feet. Normally, Dean isn’t allowed to carry Sammy down the stairs, but Dean knows that this is no ordinary night. He tramples downstairs, Cas right behind him.
“Dean, what have you had to eat today?”
Sam’s eyes light up and Dean knows that nothing will stop Sam from accomplishing his goals.
Not everyone attends a brick-and-mortar school. Some dancers choose online classes so they have more time to practice and Castiel wishes desperately that were him but online classes often require tuition and he can’t afford that. Online classes also turn his brain to mush since he can’t focus for shit unless he’s in a classroom so he knows he’d end up shelling out thousands just for his grades to tank instantly.
Castiel visits other futures. His favorite is one where Castiel is a human and Dean's childhood best friend. They married and own a small ranch. Castiel has beehives and collects the honey to sell. Dean is an excellent baker and sells his pies all over the state of Kansas. Castiel watches from afar. The light in Dean's eyes is unmistakable, but Castiel's stomach seems to twist because the real him is not the one Dean wants.
He sighs and crunches another carrot stick. Emotions suck and he really ought to buy himself new socks that don’t scratch.
Dean flinches. He can hear John’s comments offucking good-for-nothing fags ringing in his ears. What would he do if he knew Dean liked guys too? Because he does. Dean finally admits that to himself as he reaches for the shampoo.
“Dean, do you still have an imaginary friend?”
March 8, 1995
All the light seems to leave Cas’s eyes. “Oh, I see. What’s her, um, name?”
That snaps Dean’s thoughts back to himself. Cas isscared. Cas doesn’t deserve to die like Dean. Dean is replaceable. There are better hunters out there and Dean is stupid. But. Cas is smart and pretty and deserves to be real and live a real life without Dean.
Dean’s brain suddenly shuts off. He’s blank. Nothing.
“Yeah, Sammy. I’m OK.”
Dean grins. Cas remembered. They’d talked about it before, Dean explaining the idea of people choosing a person to shower with affection and be theirValentine.
Cas snuggles next to Dean and sighs in contentment. “Go to sleep, Dean.”
Dean doesn’t understand. “Why was the boy worth it? Why was he special?”
“Dean, we spent five years apart. How do you know I never learned?”
He shouldn’t feel this way. He’s a dancer, for God’s sake. If all goes well, he’ll be on a stage in tights that leave
And Dean just wants to die, because if Dean tells Cas what he wants, it will break them both. Because Cas can’t give that to him. Cas doesn’t love him that way. And that’s killing Dean.
“Benny, I’m sorry.”
Dad whirls around. “Come on, Dean. We’re leaving.” But Dean doesn’t want to leave. Bobby keeps blueberry yogurt in the fridge just because he knows that Dean likes it. The upstairs bedroom, the first one on the left, is Dean’s. Bobby gave him a big bucket of LEGOs that stays in his room and he doesn’t have to share them with Sammy if he doesn’t want to. But Dean can’t say anything.
Cas is kneeling on the bed, breathing right in his face. “Today is Valentine’s Day!”
Dean steps over the glass and walks forward until they’re only about ten feet apart. And then Cas finally sees him. Dean has never seen a sunrise so radiant as Cas’s smile at that moment.
Dean stands on his tiptoes to see. The baby has wisps of light brown hair and a squishy, wrinkly face. “Hiya, Sammy.”
Over and over again like beads of a rosary.
Cas smiles too, a weak watery smile. “Yeah, I do. “
The streetlight highlights Cas's hair and Dean swallows hard. His fingers are freezing and Cas's cheeks are tinged pink. And of course Cas drove one of the goddamn Harleys and he's got a leather jacket on and Dean chews his bottom lip. Damn it. It's now or never.
Dean turns away. He walks slowly, his footsteps heavy. Samisgonesamisgonesamisgone. He reaches the Impala and sinks into the driver’s seat. Dean rests his forehead on the steering wheel, the familiar leather comforting him just a little.
Dean closes his eyes in relief and everything goes black.
“You’ve always been independent, Castiel. Wouldn’t it be nice to be a self-made man?” Zachariah had drawled and Castiel at age thirteen thought about punching his father and forced himself to turn away.
They both know that nothing will ever be the same again. But Dean buries his face in Cas’s trench-coated shoulder and pretends like everything's OK.
Cas recoils. “What? Why would I want to do that?”
Dean pretends that they can, though, and leans into Cas’s side and breathes in his familiar scent of rain and wet flowers. It’s still Dean’s favorite scent and Dean hates the fact that he dreamed up the perfect person who smells exactly like Dean’s favorite smell and Cas doesn’t really exist.
“Maybe I heard your footsteps in the hall and was just doing it to impress you,” Balthazar says as he smoothly transitions to sitting cross legged on the ground, eyes never leaving his device.
- brief mention of drug use
He had his commanding growl on, and it made Dean weak at the knees. He complied, and was rewarded with more deep kisses, Cas’s tongue rolling across the front of his teeth. Cas pushed him onto the bed and leaned over him, powerful, electric. The light flickered overhead when he pressed his thigh into Dean’s crotch and found him hard.
There was something wrong with him. There had always been something wrong, since the fire, or maybe even before that. He could never seem to hold on to happiness for long, and it had only gotten more pronounced over the years. He had so much stuff buried deep inside him that he couldn’t bring himself to excise. Did he have to? Was it not enough just to exist in the same world as his family, did he also have to want to be happy? How would he even begin?
“Dean, we should go to your bedroom,” he announced, and Dean flushed bright red.
planning to go and talk to him, just, in his own time. Next time he was on his deathbed, for example. Dean went to his bedroom on autopilot. He didn’t quite know why he expected Cas to be in there, but he was, reading through Dean’s copy of Cat’s Cradle with his brow furrowed.
Dean gripped his coat tightly. It took so long to find the right ritual, and the moment of relief still hadn't come. Jack knelt beside them and smoothed the hair from Cas's forehead with care. His hand was shaking. He'd burned away most of his Godhood opening the way to the Empty.
"Cool. Great. Not that I wouldn't- I mean, it'd just be tricky here because we don't have the right stuff. I'd love to, obviously. You're like-" Dean gestures over Cas's body and whistles, then flounders under Cas's nonplussed stare, "okay, shutting up now, getting on with the show."
It was a testament to Sam's parenting that Jack conceded without a fight.
They settled with Dean on his back, Cas flat against him chest to chest with Cas holding himself up on his elbows in a way that would be quickly uncomfortable for a human. Cas wasn't human though. That's one of many things that made sure that Cas would always be surprising. Dean had been so certain, before, that Cas could barely feel anything at all, but there he was, feeling so much all the time.
- panic attack during an intimate moment
Sam put his face in his hand to hide his smile.
Sam stepped back and let Dean kneel to take off Cas's shoes. Dean heard Jack shuffle forwards to help, but Sam held him off.
"Uh huh." Sam's voice hid a smile and Dean turned to him warily.
"I like you like this," Dean said, rubbing his thumbs against the inside of Cas's wrists. Cas clenched his fists to stop himself struggling against Dean's grip and Dean nodded in approval. "I like you most ways, but this, this is very good."
Even so, this was as close as he’d ever managed to get. Sam was alive and was still his brother, soul intact and everything. That was the important thing. Dean nodded to himself and pushed off the side of the car, picking up his duffel and smiling at the door knocker as he unlocked the door.
"Not selfish," Dean slurred against his skin. He rested his chin on Cas's breast bone and struggled to focus up at his face at the strange angle. When Cas dutifully leaned back to let Dean see him properly he broke into a toothy, sleepy smile. "You're pretty."
Cas raised an eyebrow and dug his blade in, watching Dean track the swirl of grace slide slowly down his clavicle and onto his waiting thumb. Cas tilted his chin up and Dean's eyes flicked up to his face hungrily. Cas smirked, and licked it off himself. Dean kicked against the metal pole in frustration.
remember."
Dean contemplated Cas for a moment, then swung his leg over Castiel's, straddling him.
“I know what an attic is, Cas.” Dean rubbed the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at Castiel’s painfully familiar uncertain expression. This conversation had taken a turn for the weird, which at least had broken the strange tension in the room. “Why are you living in my attic?”
Dean's eye was drawn to him doing the most inconsequential things - rolling his shoulders back in his armchair; turning a delicate page with care; tipping his head back to catch the last droplets of whisky, his throat working subtly. His hands, especially, his long, thick fingers. He watched them smooth over a path on the map they were using to keep track of weather patterns and almost bit his pen in half at the sight of it. Thankfully, neither Cas nor Sam saw this, wrapped up in nerd shit.
The only concession to night time they'd made was swapping out the main strip lights for the glow of the table lamps. Dean watched Cas scan down the page of the book he was reading, then lick his thumb to aid in turning the page. This, for some reason, is what pushed Dean to speak.
- eating food
Dean's eyelids twitched at that, which Cas took as a desire to resupply his fingers with grace. He used three this time, and slid them into Dean's unresisting mouth, curling his ring finger next to Dean's back teeth. Dean made a desperate noise again, and he swallowed around Cas's fingers as if trying to draw him down his throat with want alone.
It seemed too small a set to have after such a long time of living, although it made sense- Sam had never been one for material possessions, too used to a life on the road and needing everything valuable to be packed into a duffle bag at short notice. They hadn’t had to leave town in a hurry since they’d moved into the house, but old habits die hard.
“Dean.” Sam’s inclined head showed just how well he remembered the all-day ice-cream in the dark when Doctor Sexy was killed off in the final episode of the season. To be fair to Dean, the doctor had just reunited with the long lost love of his life when he was hit by that bus, and they had recently discovered that they weren’t siblings at all, but third cousins. It was an emotional time for the entire hospital.
"C'm'ere."
"How come this vamp was able to get you like this, Cas?" Dean asked, and Cas turnes his head into the pillow. He didn't need to see Dean being disappointed in him.
"I remember when I was human, I was exhausted. Sleep. We will talk later."
"I'll be good if you are."
Dean retaliated, then rested his head back smugly, as if he'd definitively won an argument.
Cas sucked in a breath and called his form back to himself. He was in the hotel. He was next to a kitchen island. The grey carpet under his hand was scratchy and thin. It was dusk. The call of Heaven is not for him.
Dean chuckled lowly - "Okay, bossy"- and leaned his face down to Castiel's, letting him lick himself from Dean's chin and kiss it back, deeply, into Dean's mouth.
Jesus, they were setting such a bad example for the kid. First Dean’s weirdness about ‘gender’ and now this. He was gonna be so screwed up.
Dean took his time drifting down to Cas's waistband and then dragging his tongue from one hip bone to the other. Cas’s breath was coming out in shaky puffs, stuttering whenever Dean raised his eyes to meet his. Dean had crinkles around his eyes, like when he's smiling, and Cas couldn't hold onto his breath.
Sam smiled, and then he looked seriously into Dean’s face. “Same to you Dean, if you ever need anything-”
"You need to go to bed too, you're exhausted."
“Is that normal?” Jack was whispering to Sam, who whispered back after a glance at Dean:
“Yeah, we are," Dean said, looking right at Cas, a challenge.
"I just remember Cas saying something like that before. "I'll watch over you"."
Cas laughed once, more an acknowledgement that Dean had spoken than real humour. He settled against Dean’s chest and let Dean run his hand through his hair until he fell asleep. It was perfect.
- emetaphobia
"You're tired." Cas said, concern furrowing his brow.
He broke off as Dean lunged forward and pulled him into an embrace, one arm tight around his shoulders and the other constricting around his waist. Dean trembled with the force of his hold on the other, knocking the side of his head gently against Cas’s neck as he buried his face in his re-found friend’s shoulder and fiercely held back tears. Cas’s arms were mostly trapped by Dean’s grip, but after a few seconds he relaxed his shoulders and manoeuvred his forearms to awkwardly return the hug as much as he could. Dean breathed into his neck, fingers clenching into the white shirt under his hands, almost wanting to crush their chests into one so he never had to let him go again. Dean clutched at Castiel for what felt like a long time, willing his heartbeat to slow down but not quite succeeding in that goal in any way. Then he pulled back, rubbing at Cas’s arms and looking into his face as he did so.
"You're frowning at me." Cas noted, and he was right. Dean had so much he needed Cas to know, and he had to get it right.
The two of them got stuck in yet another staring match, the faint magnetic pull that had always held them together sending a light tingle down Dean’s spine as he looked at the person he’d missed for so long. They both started when Dean’s phone rang, the chorus of Enter Sandman at odds with the soft silence that had surrounded them.
- brief mention of previous self-harm
“Well that’s just good business sense, right Cas?”
It was easy to reel Cas back in, then, to kiss him with every feeling Dean had at those words. His anxiety, his joy, his desire to hear it again. He wanted Cas to know that his moment of happiness, his sacrifice, it wasn't in vain. It might have been stupid as all hell, but Dean wasn't about to make Cas feel stupid for loving him. It hit him, and kept on hitting him. Cas loves him. He loves him! They’re in love!
Dean kept his tongue gentle, light, only over the surface of his wound. The repetitive graze of pain over his side slowly pulled Castiel back from the edge pleasure. He was here for a purpose, and he was glad to serve it. More glad than he should be, perhaps, but he's always happy to bleed for the Winchesters. This was an act of loyalty as much as love. His gift would not be accepted if it weren't for its necessity.
Sam nodded and blinked the tears that had been threatening again, pulling in a deep breath and releasing it as he forced himself to relax a little. His voice was still a little shaky when he said “I should go get signed in, it'll probably take a while and I might not have much time afterwards before it gets late. D'you wanna stick around 'til I'm done or...?”
"What do you think?" He asked back, but with warmth suffusing the sarcasm.
He can also have some angst. As a punishment for the treat bc I am mean and nasty. Apologies if the tense isn't totally right the whole time, I'm always switching as I write. Just like Cas and Dean in bed ajfhajgbsbght I didn't SAY that
Dean flipped him off, determined that this happy bubble wouldn't be punctured by thinking too hard about things that don't matter, like his own feelings. He stuffed down the rush of exhilaration at the thought:
"Perhaps I do like this more than I should," Cas conceded, drawing more grace out onto his fingers and stepping closer, holding his hand out to just further than Dean can reach from his position, "but you like it too."
Dean opened his mouth, and then closed it again. He reached out to touch Cas’s shoulder, but before his fingers made contact, Cas moved away, walking towards the table with his shoulders hunched over slightly.
Cas can have some top!Dean. As a treat.
Cas gave a faint, pleased smile at the question, giving a small nod towards the table as he replied, “The Gas ‘n’ Sip.” He straightened his shoulders and his smile grew into a proud grin, “I’m a Sales Associate.”
"Dean," Cas began, then faltered when Dean caught his eye. He had such a serious look about him, like there was nothing he needed to do right now more important than undressing him. Cas swallowed past the lump in his throat, and Dean's eyes flicked down to follow the movement.
“Okay. Do you think we can keep playing Jenga?”
"I want to." Cas said. His voice was deep. "Let me take care of you, Dean. Please. I love you."
- Cas is angry and possessive during a moment intimacy
“No. You’re not allowed to talk to me.”
Sam felt a smile tug at his mouth and tears prick at his eyes, so he nodded quickly and turned away, soon losing himself within the mass of other people moving towards the rest of their lives.
With a final pat to his arm, Dean stepped back and leaned against the Impala- now empty of the things Sam wanted to take with him to Stanford on his second time around. It hadn’t been much: his clothes; his laptop; the new sheets Dean had insisted on because he was not having his little brother sleeping on anything college kids had been on in their first years of freedom from parental supervision; and two photographs, one of his parents that Missouri had sent over one day out of the blue and another of him and Dean on the Grand Canyon, which Dean had insisted on visiting when Sam had recovered enough from the Trials not to have to lie down every hour.
All the cooking equipment and most utensils fit along that wall, with extra food storage in the larder on the right hand wall. A varnished wooden table with four chairs around it sat in the middle of the room, with the occasional water ring from times where Dean couldn’t be bothered to get a coaster out. It wasn’t the room with the most personal effects in it, that was his bedroom, but Dean definitely felt at home in this room. When they first moved in Dean had banned Sam from the food preparation area for five days after he had somehow accidentally burned pasta into a molten lump inside a pan. How his brother had managed to feed himself when he was in college Dean would never know. (Or so he liked to pretend. The real reason Sam had ruined the pan was because he’d suddenly panicked from the feel of the steam on his face reminding him of Hell. Dean preferred the other version.)
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was under the impression that you would be gone for longer. It appears I was incorrect.” His gravelly voice tugged at Dean’s chest, gripping almost painfully tight at his core. Castiel straightened and turned on his heel. An angel faced Dean fully for the first time in a long time, locking them into eye-contact again as soon as he did so, a small curve in his lips and sincerity in his gaze as he softly said “hello Dean.”
"Tell me if it gets too much, okay baby?"
"Dean, you're so..." Cas began at a whisper, but couldn't quite articulate what Dean was to him. Beautiful, naturally, fascinating, always, pliable, only like this, only when trusting Cas so wholly. Dean's eyes opened after the next three refills, and his gaze was glassy and his breathing had gone soft and deep. He'd stopped twisting in his bonds and seemed content to accept what Cas gave him.
"That's it," Cas said soothingly, moving his hand from Dean’s jaw - which stayed where he'd moved it - to run it gently against his cheekbones to around the shell of his ear, "take it, Dean. I'm in control."
"It's alright Cas, we've got you, I've got you." Dean said, then a screaming, insistent pain overtook Castiel and he passed out.
Cas startled and the bedside lamp flashed on bright and shattered. His hand instinctively moved to Dean's shoulder to stop him. This was too far. He wanted Dean, Dean's mouth, everywhere, all over him, to be known inside and out, but if Dean was in his right mind, he wouldn't offer. He just wanted what Cas can give him.
Dean blinked. Whatever answer he had been expecting, it most definitely was not that. “You live in my what?”
"Always such a production. You like this, don't you, having power over a human. You wish Dean would never get better, so you can have this forever. I've got a news flash for you honey, he doesn't like you that way."
"What are you-"
The edges of Dean's incisors worried the skin of his knuckles, looking challengingly into Cas's eyes. Cas raised his eyebrow again and pulled his fingers back a ways, scissoring Dean's mouth open a little wider. He caught his jaw in his clean hand and held it there, then worked his other fingers back into Dean's mouth unimpeded. Dean's eyes fluttered shut and he groaned, and didn't fight against Cas’s hold on him even a little.
It took him longer than it should have to push through his shock at Cas arriving and then trying to leave again so suddenly. Dean focussed on the warmth seeping into his hand and flexing his fingers around Castiel’s bicep. It was thicker than Dean had anticipated, and he rubbed over the flesh covered by Cas’s shirt-sleeve with his thumb, watching the skin move around in circles after the travels of his fingertip. The gentle movement soothed Dean, giving him the calm he needed to look up at Castiel who was also following the journey of Dean’s thumb with his eyes, a look of almost longing in his expression- although what for Dean didn’t know.
It's only when Dean brings his teeth into play, chewing lightly on Cas's right nipple, avoiding his wounded side, that Castiel remembered that Dean needed something from him. He raised his grace to the surface of his bite. It doesn't take much effort, as it was already straining to be close to Dean. This man had no idea how much he was wanted, and Cas had to remind himself to keep it that way - that Dean being like this was just a reward for Cas being useful to him. He didn't want to know Castiel's true feelings.
Cas dragged up his heavy knee to prepare to stand, and wss knocked to the floor by a blur from his left, from behind the island. The hidden vamp sunk its teeth into his chest, biting through his shirt. A surge of white hot pain lanced through him, and he kicked it off, into Dean's path who beheaded it almost casually. He dropped the weapon immediately when he saw Cas on the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean reached the end of Cas's shirt and dragged the sides across to have it spread across the bed, Castiel's chest exposed. He ran his fingers gingerly along the edges of Castiel's jagged bite and winces in sympathy with Cas's hiss. It still hurt, and it shouldn't. His grace should have healed him by now, he shouldn't have let it happen in the first place.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas broke into a smile that crinkled his eyes. Dean could live a thousand years for that smile.
Sam jumped a little, pulled back from a memory probably at least as hard as Dean’s. “Right. I'll just- call me as soon as you get home okay Dean? I'm going to miss you.”
“You're my best friend, I miss you, I need you, I can't get through this shit without you. You're my best friend. I miss you."
"What?"
Cas nodded. Jack missed his carefully blank expression, but Dean didn’t. Cas must not want to talk about what happened, which Dean could empathise with. He had buckets of stuff he didn’t want to bring up, ever.
"Thank you,” he said, “Thank you."
These aren't necessarily in an order, I'm just publishing scenes as I'm happy with them. There may be plot eventually, for now it's just these two being into it.
Sam tossed his hair back and scrubbed at his beer’s label with his thumb, like he always did with gas station water bottles, leaving gross little wet scrunches of paper littered around the Impala. Dean was about to tell him to knock it off, when Sam cleared his throat.
. “Nah, I think I'll start off home, maybe I'll beat the rush of parents tearfully heading back to suburbia after kissing their perfect little darlings off to a year of drinking and partying on daddy's dime.”
“I’m bisexual,” Dean announced, and felt his heart beating out of his chest.
Cas stood on tiptoe and guided Dean's mouth to the nick in his neck and allowing him to claim directly from the source. Dean sucked gently and gave little kitten licks to the skin around the wound. Cas couldn't restrain a deep, satisfied sigh and wound his arms around Dean's shoulders, hugging him close.
Dean looked at him, tensing for an argument, “Sam-”
"Cas, let me out of here you asshole. You think this is going to stop me?" Dean rattled the chains keeping him against the concrete pole in the stock room. He had a bike lock around his neck, because he had been known to headbutt while in destruction mode.
"I don't know." Dean admitted.
"Yeah. Yeah, okay."
“I think Dean might want to go and speak to Cas in private. We can still play though.”
“You know, it’s okay if you haven’t decided yet either.”
“You lose again Sam!” Jack crowed.
“I…” Castiel shifted a little, glancing quickly around the pale blue-and-white tiling of the room before he answered to Dean’s shoulder. “I live here.”
“Alright.” Cas said simply, and Dean relaxed.
Dean felt all the air leave him in a rush like a punctured balloon and he sagged against the doorframe. They watched each other, Dean inhaling and exhaling raggedly until he managed to choke out a single word.
Dean lowered his head to Cas's ear, and whispered into it, with an edge of humour in his voice.
"We really doing this Cas? The silent treatment?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why?" Dean said, and he sounded so small and defeated that any rebuttals about how Dean might feel when he wakes up were dashed immediately. Slowly, Cas let himself relax into the sleepy warmth of Dean, and was rewarded by him cuddling closer. "Good. Stay here."
Chapter specific warnings:
"Cas-"
his grace exactly, not usually. It'd be like the ocean feeling someone go swimming. This ocean has dwindled, however, to drops of rain on an upturned face. How could he not notice? On such a beloved face?
“Or, listen, Sam won't be back for a few months. You could stay in his room. You know, if you wanted.”
"You're doing so good, Cas." Dean panted, ruffling Cas's hair again.
He felt a hand touch his face and opened his eyes, which were blurry. Cas had stopped blowing him and was looking into his face, concerned. He'd started crying. During sex. Oh, kill him now. He wanted to scrub his hands over his eyes but Cas's were in the way, softly brushing at still flowing tears.
"I'm all over your face," Cas murmered, almost to himself, brushing from Dean's mouth to his cheek and back again.
At the sound of his name, the man blinked, breaking eye contact and ducking his head. He spat out the remnants of toothpaste- some of which had started dripping down his chin from where his toothbrush had been hanging from his mouth, forgotten, while he had been caught by Dean’s gaze.
Cas looked into his face for a long moment while Dean held his breath, waiting for Cas to call the whole thing off because what kind of freak has a breakdown in the middle of sex then wants to keep going?
Dean huffed a laugh and shook his head, trying not to think about the person he would rather spend time with than a book club of strangers. “I thought you were signing in.”
"I can do whatever I want to you, can't I?"
“He sure is something. Or maybe she is, they haven’t decided yet,” Sam said with an easy smile.
"Cas, I should be the one - you don't have to."
A swift kiss on the cheek startled Cas into not questioning the new nickname, instead letting the sensation of Dean's mouth on his chest make him sink into the bed, warmed all over. Dean didn't immediately go for his wound as he expected, instead he worked his way over his chest and ribs again, slowly, with a patience Cas would never expect Dean to extend to him in their usual life.

Chapter specific warnings:
Sam leaned beside him and Dean nodded towards the buildings in front of them. “You're going to do great Sammy. If anyone gives you any hassle call me and I'll be down here in a second to kick their asses for you.”
Sam cleared his throat and spoke at his normal volume, pointedly looking between Dean and the door.
"Don't you want to?" Cas asked evenly.
Dean attempted a smile back but it probably came out as more of a grimace. Castiel handed him the last fork and dried his hands on the other towel next to Dean, leaning across him as he continued his story. “I tried to find you, when I first fell. I journeyed from Illinois to the Men Of Letters' bunker through hitchhiking and the occasional bus-ride, hoping that you would still be based there.”
Dean's mouth went slack and Cas felt Dean's head nuzzle into his pec.
Castiel moved past Dean and out the door with a murmured “excuse me”, which snapped Dean out of his stunned, daze. Dean’s hand shot out and grabbed Cas’s arm in a vice-like grip, stopping him in his tracks and making him turn back to face him.
, Dean wondered,
Both of them found it hard to sleep that night, more so than usual, and eventually agreed that they couldn’t do this anymore. There were too many emotions involved, too few victories that could really be counted as just for them to keep putting themselves through. That’s when they bought the house, not a huge place but in a nice neighbourhood with parks and fences. They needed something away from the Life- more than the car or the Bunker, somewhere they could hold on to and spread themselves into permanently. Somewhere that would shape around them instead of cramped sitting spaces or massive unfilled expanses.
Cas is standing by a bed of roses that haven’t bloomed, barefoot and slack with sleep.
Dean sits up, stares at his dad on the floor laying in the mess of glass with a gun by his leg. The side of his head has a deep cut that’s bleeding slow, lazy and black-red. He’s not dead.
“Are you about to go into heat?”
Dean would have thought this would be more frantic and rushed. His dad’s a few feet away locked and passed out in a shed. He’s fucking Cas but he could call it making love.
Then his bedroom door is being thrown open and Dean freezes. He hadn’t heard footsteps. His dad’s at the door and one glance at Dean and
“`M sorry, angel.” Dean chuckles, still feeling a bit dazed. “Can’t. Not yet. ‘S too tight.”
“Get him out of my house and never see him again,” John says. Dean laughs. Sees in the corner of his eye the veins in John’s temple. “Something funny, Dean?” His voice has gone down, quiet. Dangerous. “Not gonna listen to your dad ‘cause you got a boyfriend now?”
Cas hics painfully, chest jolting with it, but he takes a shaky inhale in, less shaky at the exhale. His shoulders shake as he forces himself to hold the tears in, but they escape when he shuts his eyes, pushing his face into Dean’s chest to hide his face. “C-can’t,” he stammers out, hushed voice too loud in the silence of the house. “C-can’t breathe.”
It doesn't take long when Dean wraps a hand around Cas' erection, jerking him off in time with his thrusts. Cas comes with a full-body shiver and a, "
Cas blushed and buried his head further into Dean’s neck.
Cas pants under him, on the verge of hyperventilating, eyes wide and afraid, and Dean’s heart breaks for him. He lays down beside his best friend, turning Cas to his side so they could face each other, draping an arm over Cas’ waist to put a hand to his back and rub comforting circles.
“You’re welcome.” Dean leans to the side to grab the glass of lukewarm water he left on the nightstand. His hand on Cas’ back helps Cas sit up, although his neck seems to be not working because Cas’ head won’t stop lolling side to side. Dean lets Cas lean against him, pressing the rim of the glass to his mouth. “Drink.”
“Words, sweetheart.” Dean smirks down at him, pumping his hips in a placid pace that makes Cas want to cry.
. The town believes them, believes the preacher and his choir boys. They stop talking about it in less than a week.
“Mhmm. You too.”
“I— okay,” Cas’ cheeks turn pink, not very sure about putting oil inside him, but more than certain about letting Dean do anything he wants to him, “we can work with that. Get the olive oil. I’ll be right here.”
Dean licked the shell of his omega’s ear, bubbling with joy when his mate giggled and attempted to squirm away. His omega was very sensitive. The attempt to escape was futile—Dean was more than an alpha and he easily pulled Castiel back to his front, growling playfully and nipping at his neck. Castiel smelled better than usual, almost like syrupy honey, and Dean licked the scent gland in the juncture of his omega’s neck and shoulder, groaning in pleasure. His omega tasted like ambrosia.
“Dean!” Charlie cut in. She frowned at him. “Chill, dude.”
Who’s he kidding. He’s in love with the guy.
It’s amusing and adorable and he doesn’t know if Cas’ is already gone in cloud nine floating, but he starts fucking him in earnest, shoving into him with powerful thrusts that make the bedsprings creak, the headboard quiet because of the pillows Dean put between it and the wall earlier.
Dean stands in front of his dad’s bed until John’s storming in, downing a bottle of beer that Dean knows tastes like sewage piss. John bangs the door shut behind him sliding the lock in with a loud click. Dean simply stands there. John walks over to the nighstand, slams the now empty bottle down. “You a fag, Dean?” He paces back and forth.
“Shush, Cas,” Dean groans out, feeling like he’s been scattered to the winds. He tries to regain his composure, staying inside Cas while Cas stares at him amusedly. “Can’t help it,” Dean grumbles. “You’re fuckin’ tight. I stretched you right, didn’t I? How you feelin’?” Dean rumbles.
Dean pulls away a bit to look at Cas’ relaxed, tear-blotched face, never detaching himself from Cas. His heart swells for this boy, fondness and affection expanding his heart, filling until it’s ready to burst.
Dean’s eyebrows went up in surprise. “I love you, too,” he replied. His omega cuddled up to him like they were the two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, his body fitting against Dean’s perfectly. “Not that I mind, but uh, what’s with the affection?” He nipped at his omega’s shoulder.
Another day passes and the town’s talking about the missing boys. There’s the common speculation of running away together, but the Novak family says,
Dean doesn’t want to make him wait. He pushes himself off the frame, doesn’t waste time dropping to his knees between Cas’ legs. “Wait,” Cas mumbles, turning around to get on his knees and elbows, ass raised. He tugs his pants and underwear down in one go. “Okay.”
Benny sighed and looked around. He grabbed a throw pillow from a single sofa and chucked it at the Dean’s head. “Get your head straight, brother. I’m sure he’s fine.”
He pushes the finger in, thrusting it unsurely before adding a second finger, pouring even more olive oil, the liquid sticky and slick in his hands and dripping down to his wrist. Cas flinches and Dean does, too. “Cas? You okay, angel?” He asks worriedly, completely freezing.
This time, Dean can’t help but blurt out, “She’s dead.”
Dean doesn’t tell him that it’s going to be okay, that he’ll be fine and this will pass. It will never be okay. Instead, he says, “I’m with you the whole time, Cas. Breath.”
The two shut the bathroom door while Dean returned to bed, their mingling scents soothing his panicking heart. What had happened? Cas was fine. Sam and Benny glared at Dean, arms crossed. Dean ignored them, busying himself by pressing his face against the bed instead. “Dean,” Sam started.
“Can I cook breakfast for you?” Dean asks. “But I’ll have to leave the room.”
He undoes the fly of his jeans and pulls his hard cock out. Olive oil’s fucking nasty and sticky, but it kinda tingles and it does the job nicely. Cas turns his head over his shoulder and watches as Dean slicks himself up, leisurely jacking off with the olive oil.
“Okay,” Dean echoes, pouring olive oil on his index, coating it generously before prodding at the furled muscle of Cas’ opening. Cas pushes back, hole fluttering. Dean’s never fucked a guy before. His pulse begins to quicken.
“Mhmm.” Cas nods. “Thank you. Thank you. You’re so kind, Dean. Love you.”
Dean marches up to him, yanks him into a rough kiss that’s a hard press of lips first and then dissolving into teeth and tongue into the warm, wet, velvety of the inside of a mouth. “Let me fuck you,” Dean says. “Can I, Cas?”
Dean’s too afraid to open his mouth. If he does, the rancor and everything rage will come spilling out and the bête noire will consume him.
“Love you,” he mutters. Dean can feel him relaxing in his arms.
Dean smiles, pulling Cas up slightly up the bed so he can kiss his forehead. He shouldn’t put Cas back under, so he tries not to encourage it, not displaying an ounce of dominance. “Go back to sleep, sweetheart. I’ll wake you for breakfast.”
Unbeknownst to them, the rest of the pack was wordlessly screaming outside their bedroom, having eavesdropped on the whole conversation.
His dad strides up to him, grabbed his jaw and dug his fingers in. “What would your mother think?”
“Dean,” Cas says, almost chastising Dean for not putting it inside him.
. Fuck. Dean rips his gaze away from Cas to look at his dad. John’s face is red.
Dean jumped up from the floor. “FUCK YEAH!” He exclaimed, hugging his mate carefully. “Oh, my God, I’m going to be a dad!!”
You didn’t raise me at all. Dean looks away, pretends to be bored, ignoring the throb in the high area of his cheekbone, behind his eye.
. “Don’t leave.”
Cas flushed. “But, alpha—”
Dean grunts, feels himself about to burst and he pulls out, knee-walking up along Cas’ body with his hand around his cock jerking himself off furiously, gritting his teeth as he forced his fat, throbbing cock into Cas’ mouth. Cas’ eyelids threaten to fall close as Cas moans gratefully, swallowing as Dean shoots come down his throat in warm spurts.
He also knows Cas’ head is fried.
His alpha grinned. “But I’m thirty minutes late already.” He pushed his omega to lay back down, settling on top of him. “Why don’t we do something el—” He paused as Cas froze, blood suddenly draining from his face. He pushed Dean off and ran to the bathroom. Dean’s stomach lurched uncomfortably at the sound of his omega vomiting. He followed Cas to the bathroom. “Angel? Are you okay?”
“Do not tell me to chill when my omega is puking his guts out!” Dean cried, miserably pulling a pillow over his head. The three alphas exchanged a glance. They couldn’t enter the nest of mates. It would be impolite. But it was a pack thing to comfort each other in cuddles. How would Dean be comforted?
“Don’t,” Dean interrupted. “Please, Sam. I am fucking tired and I don’t know why but it’s probably because my omega is stressed, and I have no idea what the fuck happened, like, we were playing around and then he suddenly vomits, and oh my God, what if he doesn’t love me anymore and he was disgusted—”
“Now you’re lying to me?” John shouts, getting all up in his face, hand raised, ready to hit Dean again. “Your mother would be so ashamed of you,” he hisses through gritted teeth.
“Wanna come in your ass,” Dean answers, not stopping, slightly driving Cas further up the mattress with the way he rams into him over and over. Cas whimpers pitifully.
“You have to stop laying on top of me,” said Cas. “You’re crushing our pup.”
“I know something else that’s hard.”
“We were only hugging!” Dean screams and he loses control of himself for a moment.
Dean pulls out and Cas blinks up at him sluggishly. “Th-th’nk…” He stammers, “ thank y-you, sir…”
“No. Why?” Castiel’s brows furrowed in concern. “Dean, are you near your rut? I thought we synced already. You should tell me if you’re nearing your rut, so I can get us necessities.”
Cas is still sound asleep, snoring softly. Dean presses kisses across his bare shoulders until Cas stirs. “Dean,” he mumbles. “Um.”
Cas smiles at him softly, raising his knees on either side of Dean, hands moving down to Dean’s back and pushing, making Dean lay on top of him. “You don’t have lube? Bedroom?”
“N-nnno.” He pushes his hips back, trying to grind back against Dean. “P-please, sirrr… I’m a good – I’m a good…” He’s interrupted by his own grunt and Dean’s chuckle accompanied by a hard thrust. “Sir – sir. Stop. No t-tease… teasing.”
He pushes John’s unconscious body down the stairs, numb at the thud-thud-thud, then he’s back to dragging. He opens the door to the backyard. Drags.
“Get your ass to my room, boy.”
Blue eyes watered. “No,” Cas whispered.
Cas makes another desperate noise. He wants to ask what’s so funny but his mind is being overwhelmed with nothing but the feel of Dean and his cock inside Cas and, “S-sirr? Sir, sir, sir, sir  – ”
Dean smiles at him, apologetic. “Sorry, angel.” Hand around his shaft, he guides himself to Cas’ entrance, pushes in torturously slow, inch by inch, Cas tense and moaning small moans under him like he’s trying to keep quiet, until he’s buried to the hilt. His mind’s a little bit dizzy with how tight Cas is, tighter than anything, tighter than everything Dean's ever had.
“Alright, baby.” Dean gives in with a sigh. “I’ll come in your mouth.” He turns Cas over to lay on his back, Cas as light as a doll in his hold, never removing him from his cock or stopping from fucking into him vigorously. Cas’ head lolls. White strips of his own come reach up to his chest.
Glass explodes, lands near Dean’s head and on the floor, but the hands around his throat loosen and John’s eyes are wide with barely any pupil. He slides open the drawer of the nightstand and then he’s pressing the barrel of a gun to Dean’s forehead. “I see you kiss that boy and I’m gonna shoot you dead.”
Dean ponders the fact that someone is making himbreakfast. The last person to make him breakfast was Mom. His eyes start stinging suspiciously so he just ducks into the bathroom without answering for a moment of privacy.
Cas takes a deep breath. “I couldn’t stand by and watch you be in love with someone else. Because … I love you.”
“I would love to.”
“He needs to know how to defend himself.”
Sam emerges from his TV marathon, grabs the food, and disappears again. Dean refuses to be hurt that Sam didn’t even say thank you.
Dean jumps out the crib and pounds down the stairs. He flings the front door open and there is Cas, standing shyly on the steps. “Hello, Dean.”
Sam sniffles. “I ‘give you. I’m sorry ‘bout your tower.”
“Hey, Cas. How’s it going?” Cas looks different. He’s taller and his trench coat seems to fit better. When did that happen?
Daddy tells Sammy to have sweet dreams and then he heads to Dean’s room. Dean’s room is painted blue, his favorite color. He tells Daddy about his fun day as he gets tucked into bed.
Dean shuffles over and scoops up the still crying Sam. He rocks him until Sam stops crying. “I’m sorry, Sammy. Do you forgive me?”
“But you never learned.”
But Dean’s mouth won’t work. His mother was killed. No accident. Someone wanted to hurt her. On purpose. Maybe their whole family could be dead right now because someone—no, a monster hated them all enough to try to murder them while they slept.
Cas looks at him like he’s just said the dumbest thing known to man. “Yes, I can.”
Cas looks like Dean just slapped him across the face. “Oh, I see.” And then Cas disappears.
“Wha—what just—you just—”
Dean sighs. “No, I needed the bread and butter kind, but dill is fine.”
And there is nothing Dean can say to that.
Dad takes a deep breath and seems to calm down. “Dean, grab Sammy and get in the Impala. Don’t ask questions; just go.”
Mommy beams at him.
Now, Dean can’t get the wolf off of him. Its teeth are everywhere, snapping and tearing, and Dean thinks he can smell blood that’s probably his and the beast’s thick rank breath is right in his face and—
Castiel Novak falls out of a pirouette for the third time that day. He clenches his jaw and resets, pliéing into fourth position and choosing his spot. He snaps his foot to passé and keeps his abs tight as he spins, focusing on his own eyes in the mirror in front of him. He turns á la seconde, desperately trying to keep his leg from overbalancing him.
February 14, 1987
As they crept around the corners of the abandoned house the wolves were squatting in, Dean was so focused on watching Sam’s back that he didn’t even notice the wolf about to attack him until it was too late.
Cas is almost cringing but Dean viciously keeps going.
Mommy comes in and Daddy kisses her before he leaves to go watch the news. Mommy brings out the book basket and tells Dean that he can only pick one. Thus the hardest decision of Dean’s day is before him. Dean touches The Giving Tree, but then he looks atWinnie the Pooh and pauses. He loves them both; how can he choose? He only manages to decide when Mommy says that they can read the other book tomorrow night. So Dean chooses The Giving Tree.He listens intently, and when the book is over, Mommy kisses his forehead.
“What did you do today?”
Suddenly Dad is there, rough hands pushing Dean’s shirt up and examining the claw marks. Dean can’t see them, but Cas sucks in a breath in surprise.
This is his chance. He could get a real position with NYCB. He’ll be 17 in March and it’s not unheard for dancers to be offered a contract that young. He could
A faint pink flush tinges Cas’s cheeks and Dean revels in the sight. But then he checks his watch and realizes they’re expecting Sam and Jess and Cathryn in five minutes.
Cas stands up and so does Dean. “Dean, they’ll find us anyway. I don’t want you involved in this.”
“Have you killed the monster that killed Mom?” Dean’s mouth doesn’t seem to belong him to him anymore. His insides feel full of ice and his voice sounds like steel, gray and cold.
“I’m sorry. I can’t do this. I’m…. Well, I—”
Dean winces every time he puts on a shirt. Sam doesn't know about the burns on Dean's chest, wings, branded on him forever. He takes a savage pleasure in them.  After all he's done to screw Cas over, it's only fair that Cas got his own in the end. Cas spent far too long worshipping at the sacrificial altar of Dean Winchester. No wonder he became another victim.
Dean wakes up to the sound of a car in the driveway. He peeks out the window and sees the Impala and it feels like he can breathe again. He flings open the door and runs outside in his bare feet and yesterday’s clothes.
“Dean … please … stop … talking.”
Dean’s freezing. All he wanted was some booze and pie so he could pretend that someone cares about his birthday. Looks like frostbite is his gift from the universe. He parks outside some liquor store that sells snacks and dashes to the door, trying to be as quick as possible because he hasn’t bought a coat yet this year.
Cas is awake and watching Dean a little hesitantly. Dean grins and snuggles closer, savoring the heat from Cas’s body. Dean lies there, just trying to take in the fact that Cas is there.
Dean straightens and walks out to the waiting room. John is grumbling about what took so damn long. Dean ignores him and sits in a hard wooden chair. His spine is straight and his expression neutral. When the doctor comes out and tells them that Sam will be fine, Dean can’t even muster a sense of relief. Healing a paper cut does nothing for a man too shattered to remember to breathe.
Dean is left staring until his brain finally catches up with what just happened. “Cas, you can’t kiss me!”
Dean just shakes his head. “Nah, you’re fine.”
Benny stirs, blinking heavy lids. “Dean?”
Dean laughs nervously. “No way.”
Dean has never seen Dad so angry. “Dean Winchester, what the hell do you think you’re doing?!” Sammy is wailing, but Dean can hear Dad yelling just fine.
Dean takes a deep breath. “Yeah?”
Dean’s brain seems to be stuck. “But Mom’s death was an accident. Everyone said that it was some kind of messed up wiring.”
It’s Dean’s fault.
Castiel checks his phone and swears. He’s
“Cas! Cas! Did you see the shooting star? Did you? Did you?” Dean is so excited, he’s barely coherent.
Alfie looks faintly concerned, glancing back and forth from Dean to Cas. This time he talks to at Cas. “Is heOK?”
Dean waits as well, tense as a prisoner waiting for a verdict.
“I am so very sorry.” Cas finally speaks and his voice sounds so small because no words will fix this and they both know that.
It was just too easy to look at him, thin and gangly with a mop of messy hair and secondhand clothes that never fit right, and think
Dean gestures helplessly. “I’m in love with someone else. I’m so sorry. I feel like such a dick.”
Mommy smiles fondly. “OK, Dean. Stay in the yard and don’t get too cold.”
Again, against his will, he finds himself thinking of Balthazar and watching the muscles of his back flex as he does pushups on their bedroom floor. Balthazar is snarky and irreverent; he’s consistently toeing the line of expulsion but he’s such a brilliant dancer that he always manages to worm his way back into the instructors’ good graces.
The motel room is quiet when sixteen-year-old Dean silently lets himself in. Sammy’s light breathing and Dad’s gruff almost-snoring masks any scratch of the lock. It’s almost two in the morning and Dean feels a little guilty for coming back so late.
Sam and Jess are digging in and Jess has ketchup on her cheek. Sam wipes it away for her and they both smile at each other. The sunlight makes Cas glow and Dean can’t believe they’re really here. This is his family and Dean is home. He turns back to eating Cas’s kick-ass pie with a smile.
Sam winks. “Oh, OK. Have you guys kissed yet?”
Dean pulls out his cell phone and types, I’m never coming back. Don’t try to find me or Sam ever again.Because this is it: Sam is safe now; Dean can leave. He doesn’t have to stay with John anymore or hunt if he doesn’t want to. Twenty-three years that Dean has spent dealing with John and his harsh words, beatings, and neglect. And Sam never knew about most of it. Dean protected him well. And now Dean has no idea what to do. But he sends the text to John before he can second-guess himself.
“Cas, what the hell did you mean, ‘happy with someone else’?”
Balthazar’s words drift through his mind and he firmly pushes them away. Every dancer thinks like that. He’s the not only one who‘s desperate to prove himself. But he
Cas squares his shoulders. “Dean, I refuse to tell you the answer to that question in a freezing cold, rundown store parking lot.”
“I will collect my things.” Castiel said, the square of morning sunlight from the window slipping from his back like an ill-fitting cloak. “I think Nora might allow me to sleep on her couch in return for babysitting her child when she wants to go out.”
"Do you want some?" Cas asked, his voice a rake over hot coals. Dean huffed and smiled against his neck.
Cas attempted to slide out from under him, but he is gripped tightly with a strength he can no longer match. He willed his heartbeat to remain steady under Dean's hand.
Dean frowned, confused. “Here like, here in town?”
This chapter is my FAVOURITE jsky ❤
They also had a front lawn which was entirely grass, which Dean took a sad sort of satisfaction in mowing every couple of weeks, each time being reminded of either the false home of a hallucinated mother or the real home of Lisa and Ben which he ultimately didn’t fit either.
Sam and Dean Winchester stood together, staring up at the huge college buildings ahead of them. The whole place was packed out with students, their huge bags knocking into the people around them as they hugged parents and siblings in a final goodbye before their world narrowed into tests, stress, and 3 a.m. essay writing. The Winchesters were no different, although Sam was significantly taller than everyone else starting their first year of Law and their parents were nowhere they could reach for an embrace.
"Cas," he said, and he wanted to say 'thank you for not being dead'. He wanted to say 'I'm sorry for being like this'. He wanted to say 'I miss you' again, which was ridiculous. He knew Cas wouldn't want to hear any of that. Instead he said what he knew for sure was true:
Dean watched, his breath still coming out rather shakily as Castiel carefully wiped his mouth with a washcloth that Dean didn’t recognise as his or Sam’s, feeling rather light headed and glad for the doorframe’s stability. Castiel paused after rinsing off his toothbrush and turning off the tap, the sudden silence pressing against Dean’s chest while the figure in front of him leaned onto his forearms and looked at the wall for a moment, as though stealing himself. Then he puffed out a breath and looked into Dean’s face through the mirror again, his eyes startling and sharp.
“No, but that’s okay. Everyone has different relationships, they can be hard to understand sometimes.”
He couldn't help the breathiness that his voice took on, or how he shuffled in his chair trying to get his boner a little friction. If his hands were free he would pull Cas down to him properly and they could rut together like animals, but Cas didn't want that so he stayed in place. Cas wasn't an animal like him. Cas was a cool stream that follows a forest path, carving it slowly and gently to his image.
If it weren't for the blissful, sleepy, wrung out feeling that he got after grace, he might have pushed his luck and kissed him again. Instead he let Cas gently maneuver him upright and help him to bed. Dean tried, in vain, to pull Cas down with him as usual but Cas took his chair instead.
"You're welcome."
"You're
"You love me?"
He was confused, absolutely, but Cas was happy for some reason, so it was okay. Today had been intense for everyone, Dean reasoned. Cas can have some time to freak out if he needs it. Now he was happy. It was a win-win. As long as Dean ignored the tightening dread in his gut, and the trickle of poison leaking into his heart.
"You're welcome Cas."
Chapter specific warnings:
“Can’t I be ladies too?”
Dean forced a smile and joked, “Oh great, I was looking forward to some peace and quiet away from your Sasquatch feet stomping about the place. No more being woken up by your long midnight showers or my books being put away before I was done reading them.”
"Cas, what are you doing here?"
Cas's eyes sparkled with joy.
Dean caught Cas’s eye and grinned at him. Cas tilted his head at him, considering.
Dean’s smile softened and Sam could tell this was the final sincere farewell from his brother. “Mom would be proud of you.”
"There's no coffee." He said, astutely, and broke the trance.
“Right.” said Dean flatly, both of them thinking of disturbed spirits but neither wanting to say it. It couldn’t be a ghost, they blessed the house regularly and had mixed salt into their paint when they put up protective symbols, but that didn’t stop Dean’s head from being filled with the whimpering of an undead child. Forcibly pushing the images of her going up in flames to the back of his mind, Dean cleared his throat. “Sign in.”
pretty." Cas corrected, tipping Dean to lean back against the pole while he began putting in the various combinations for the chains holding him there.
He can’t have this conversation.
"Let's take him to a room to sleep it off." Sam said gently.
cheat.”
“Anything at all about who you are,” Sam said, carefully casual in a way that meant he knew he was tiptoeing close to an unexploded bomb.
Dean frowned, incredulous. “The Gas ‘n’ Sip? That’s all the way on the other side of town!” he didn’t mean to raise his voice but it happened anyway.
What the fuck just happened.
Dean kissed him. “And you just blue-balled me, which is really rude. Now you’re calling me ‘alpha’ and turning me on?” He tutted in feigned disapproval. “Bad, bad omega.” He grinned, wolfishly. “Bad omegas have to be punished by their alphas, don’t they, Cas?” Just as he got on top of his omega, Cas put a hand to his chest.
The next day, neighbors report hearing strange sounds from the house next door. Wood banging and muffled screams, it sounds like. They find a tied up man in the shed and a teenage boy’s bedroom void of belongings.
“It’s not supposed to be!”
say his name!” Dean bellows, shoving at John’s chest. His father stumbles for only half a second before he’s shoving back and Dean’s falling back to the bed, his dad immediately on him, hands on Dean’s throat and pressing down, angry red and veins popping.
“Don’t you fucking speak to me like that,” John snarls, spittle landing on Dean’s eyelid and cheek.
His eyes snap open, tilting his head slightly to the side to look at Dean from where he’s laying. He doesn’t stop touching himself, only smiles at Dean, shy as can be while putting on a show. He spreads his legs, between a come-hither.
“What if it’s my fault?” Dean thought aloud. “What if—what if I bit him too hard or something? What if I knotted him too hard?”
“Hey.” Dean put a finger to his lips. “You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to tell me, okay?”
Three states over, Dean’s holding Cas as he rocks into him. He doesn't know what they'll do, not yet. But he wishes they’d live forever.
Dean stared at him. A moment passed as he let that new information sink in. Cas looked equally shocked at admitting that, but when Dean finally processed what his omega said, he dramatically gasped and fell to the floor. Cas peeked at him over the bed, ignoring Dean’s stunned look.
Cas is making rough drawn-out sounds, hard moans that scratch at his throat as he curses, cheeks cherry red and eyes rolling to the back of his head, thighs shaking and hands clenching on the sheets.
Dean hums, keeping up a steady pace. “Of course, sweetheart. You just can’t touch yourself.”
“Don’t you speak about your mother like that, Dean Winchester,” his father growls. Dean’s lips twist into a sneer. He was only saying the truth. “Don’t you look at me like that. I see how you look at that boy! I didn’t raise no fag.”
He doesn’t look back when he locks the shed behind him.
“Wanna,” Cas sobs against the sheets. “Wanna, please. Wanna. Sir, please, sir, please, wanna wanna wanna– ”
He returns to John’s room, grabbing both of his hands and pulling it over his head and begins to drag. Glass scratches and more cuts form along his dad’s body. Dean ignores it. His dad is heavy but he’s determined, only a bit afraid when he realizes his heart is beating at its average pace, like it usually does. Like he didn’t just kill his father.
Cas is doing something that’s between humming and moaning, ‘mmm, mmm, mmm’s as he sucks Dean clean, letting Dean fuck his face until he’s soft.
, sweetheart.” Dean amusedly smiles. Nothing’s stopping Cas, really. Dean didn’t say he couldn’t come and there isn’t a ring around his cock.
Dean shakes his head. He didn’t kill anyone.
“Y-you do want it, right?” Cas hesitantly asked.
“What the fuck’s your business with me and Cas?” Dean snaps, manic and as angry. “He’s my best friend, leave us alone.”
Dean jumps up, runs out of the room, tiptoeing around small bits of glass that he can only see because they reflect the afternoon light from the windows. He shoves his feet into shoes, peeking into his bedroom for a moment to see Cas sound asleep and still in the same position. The image of it soothes him.
Dean smiles at him fondly, planting a kiss on his soft tummy. He wipes every inch of Cas clean before curling up behind him, spooning Cas and tucking the heavy blankets around them.
“You’re playful today,” said Castiel as he turned over in the nest of their sheets, smiling at Dean, curiously. Dean couldn’t help but push forward to kiss him. Cas grinned as he pulled away. “What’s up?”
As Dean’s thrusting, building a pace, he conversationally asks, “Wanna run away with me?”
The alpha sniffed, grinning as Cas rolled them over so he would be the one on top. “It’s not my rut,” said Dean. “It’s you. There’s something about you.” He pressed his nose back to his omega’s scent gland, nipping on his bite. “You smell fucking awesome. More so than usual.” He ground up his omega, cock hardening when Cas moaned.
“Are you sick?” Dean asked. “Do you want me to go buy medicine?”
Dean chuckles. “I love you too, sweetheart. C’mon, sleep. I’ll see those pretty blues when you wake up.”
“Dean,” Cas sighed, pulling away. “You have work.”
“My omega, I’d do anything for you,” Dean said. He sat by his omega and rubbed a hand up and down his back as Cas puked, mostly consisting of liquid. “Shit, baby. I don’t know what to do.” He ran off to the kitchen, rambling off about Cas when his pack bombarded him with worried questions as he quickly filled a glass with water. They all followed him back to the bedroom, looking worriedly at Cas who was on the bathroom floor, head bent over the toilet.
Cas turned to face Dean fully, looking at the side of his face with an earnest yet sad expression pulling the sides of his mouth down. “By the time I arrived you were both gone. I was discouraged until I found the note.”
Dean blinked.
"You love me."
"I'm glad you remember. I hope you remember."
Dean guided Cas to a bedroom, presumably laid out by the vampires, and pushed him to lie down over the bedspread. Then Dean paused, sat on the side of the bed, and looked down at Cas. Castiel kept his eyes on Dean's face, searching for any sign of the Mark's influence on him, and tried to parse out what he was thinking. Dean had a splatter of blood across his face, in a diagonal from his forehead to his cheek. It brought out the green of his eyes.
Dean waved a hand and gave him a fond grin, “I know.”
Even when he didn’t want to be. Even when he wanted to scream sometimes when he was drinking with the guys or pushing himself to laugh at a fucked up joke. Not that he really had many guy friends who made him act like that anymore. Should he get some? Did he have something to prove? He couldn’t think about this, it wasn’t right.
"I will watch over you," Cas said, and Dean felt himself relax fully into the bed. The last thing he saw before he blinked for the last time before sleep was Cas running his fingers over his own mouth, like he could still feel Dean there.
He pulled out his angel blade and flipped it around in his hands.
“He’s got the jokes ladies and gentlemen! Ladies being you, Sam, Jack being the gentleman.”
Dean burst out of the Empty and the portal closed behind him with a wet click. His legs gave out at the sight of Sam's desperate expression turning to relief and Jack dropping the ritual marker, Dean landed on his knees with Cas's heavy solid form sprawled on his lap. He had dragged Cas across miles and miles of black sludge, the angel not waking since Dean first touched him.
“I do not
“You just shouldn’t be,” he tried, and it sounded feeble even to him.
Maybe his brain was addled from the sex. Dean brushed off the weird emphasis.
Cas led them back to Dean's room and stayed close as Dean shut the door. He gently pushed Dean's shoulders and held him against it, running his fingers up and down Dean's arms. He looked at Dean's face, his eyes, his lips, his neck. Dean let him stare, knowing the feeling after a death, but it ticked a little longer than he was used to.
"Where shall I do it?" He asked Dean, feeling it was only right to get his input, seeing as it was as much agency as Dean could have in this situation.
"Will you read me to sleep?"
Dean liked the kitchen. The walls were cream and the cabinets along the wall facing the street were a pale gray, which always seemed to shine slightly in the late morning sunlight that came from the windows above the sink which were covered with net curtains, procured from the same charity shop as the door knocker.
"Dean." Cas said, and it was gentle, and reverent, as if Dean had said something soulful instead of rambling on about himself. Had he really said he missed Cas when he was literally right there with his dick in his mouth? Jesus Christ. How pathetic can he be?
Sam rolled his eyes but turned back anyway. “What is it Dean?”
"Dear Cas," he began, and heard Cas inhale sharply through his nose, "I hope you've got your ears on. I'm so glad you're back. I always miss you when you're gone. You were gone for so long.”
"Let's get this coat off," Dean said, tugging at Cas’s lapel until Cas sat up enough to remove it, then his suit jacket, which were thrown from the bed haphazardly. Dean pressed Cas's shoulders back into the bed and worked his tie off with gentle hands.
They had been living in the house for about a year and hadn’t hunted since. Dean still felt the guilt piling up though, every slightly suspicious death mentioned on the news pulling him through the wringer because maybe he could have stopped it, maybe that could have been avoided if he wasn’t so fragile, if he just did his damn job like he was supposed to and wasn’t so damn fragile.
Castiel glanced from Dean to the door and back again, nodding once in resigned conformation. “Just let me gather my things, please, and I shall be gone.”
Dean carefully closed the door with as little noise as possible, reaching out for the iron bar they kept next to the door. Nothing nasty had found them recently but it never hurt to be cautious. Creeping silently upstairs, avoiding all the spots he knew would make a sound, Dean’s mind was curiously blank. He felt disconnected from what he was doing, as though he was watching someone else do it through a pane of frosted glass. His movement felt muted and his breathing was measured. The door to the bathroom at the end of the hall was half-open, and he could hear other sounds as well as the water which he couldn’t identify over the pounding of his heart. Dean paused next to the entrance, took another breath, and quietly pushed it all the way open.
He rested a hand against the mirror, and felt its biting cold ground him. He could be happy. He’d make himself happy. He fixed himself with a suave grin, then laughed at himself. He looked like he did when he was 15 and was desperately trying to look cool. He was still desperate even at 42, but at least he knew for a fact he was cool. A miserable old fucker, but damn cool in spite of it.
“Dean, please.” Sam’s voice cracked on the ‘please’, hand gripping Dean’s shoulder hard and lip quivering slightly when Dean dragged his gaze back to Sam’s face.
“Yeah. Sorry. I want to...” Dean hesitated, then ploughed on. If Cas can literally save his life with saying what he wants, Dean can let them have sex by being brave too. “Can we keep going?”
"Yes, Dean?" Cas rumbled, too close to be socially acceptable but too far to be considered intimate. Dean reached out and tugged on his tie, guiding him to lean forward until his hands landed on the armrests and he was just above eye level. It felt right, looking up at Cas. His expression hadn't changed, scrutinising but unsurprised.
“Hey handsome, you come here often?” Dean tried, leaning in the door jamb.
Dean wrapped his legs around Cas's and wriggled until his head was resting on Cas’s armpit, his hand over his heart, and his eyelids started to droop.
Dean’s mouth dropped at the accusation. “Wow, really Sammy? That’s what you think of me? Really? Okay a) I would never drive a Volvo or wear a polo shirt if God himself told me to, and b) you wouldn't stop studying to have a little fun if your life depended on it. How you ever got a girlfriend last time you were here is beyond me”
He let go immediately and turned back to his plate, missing Dean's sudden and intense blush. Sam didn't though, and threw Dean a startled look, followed by a grin and a thumbs up.
“I needed a place to stay until I saved enough for a place of my own. I've been paying as much rent as I can afford from my wages into house bills, and bought my own food.” He blinked earnestly at Dean. “I will pay you back my debts when I have the money. I'll move out if you want me to.”
