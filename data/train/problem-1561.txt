Sherlock went red again before grabbing his coat and leading John down the stairs.
“I did.” Replied cock lips “I told Mike this morning I must be a difficult man to find a flat mate for. Now here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap.”
Anderson went to talk but noticed the look on the D.I. face telling him that he needed to stay in line. It didn’t do that much good though. Passing John, he mumbled under his breath. “Still a freak”
“Who’s this?” Sally asked. “A friend of mine Dr. Watson. John this is Sgt Sally Donovan.”  Sherlock replied
“You think so?” Sherlock said nervously
“Brixton” Greg replied
Sherlock and John made their way over to the crime scene. John watched as Sherlock composed himself, breaking into a calm stride that seem powerful at the surface but also seemed like he was gearing up for a flight.
Being wrong is like cold water to Sherlocks hot body it calms him down and makes him focus. “Harry's your sister.” Sherlock said upset at being wrong
John was very young when he first shifted and a teen when he presented as an alpha. His power rolled of him like electricity. You could sense him miles before you even got close to him. Though that was before he got a hold of his power and could now reel it in so you could only sense him if he wanted you too. John was fit from biology and years of rugby and wrestling. He was smart too. Graduating medical school, interning, and becoming a fully qualified doctor by 23. Now at 30 he was proud of his accomplishments. He was genetically superior, though he never let it show.
They’d made the promise that they’d meet up every Monday from then on until they were supposed to perform. It was only seven weeks away, so it wasn’t all that much time, really, when you got down to it. But on the other hand, with how well it actually turned out they played together, it could easily be argued that they didn’t need much more practice together, if any at all.
He had to know what kind of rumours that could potentially start and yet…he wasn’t letting go of it, either, just continued to hold on as they moved.
One might argue that he could be as open as he liked, given that they were parting ways and he didn’t care about what the other students thought of him, he never had. But that wasn’t the point, was it? The point was what John thought of him, and he would, again, rather like to be remembered positively by John, for as long as he would recall him, of course.
He wished, fervently, that he could say the things mentioned proved that it was her, without a shadow of doubt. That he had her so embedded in his mind that he’d be able to tell just like that, and in a way, she was, and he could.
Which possibly didn’t matter from a pure monetary perspective, but though John had a lot to learn about his bond mate still and undoubtedly would for years to come, he felt pretty confident in saying that wasn’t why Sherlock did it.
Considering his fears, it would only make sense for him not to be overly keen on sleeping. Yes, he said he’d got the dragon under control, and John believed him. The problem was that Sherlock didn’t seem to believe himself.
Perhaps that wasn’t surprising. To anyone else, it wouldn’t be. He knew that it wouldn’t. To Sherlock, however, it was…it wasn’t as though bodies were uncommon occurrences, no matter what state they were in.
“It’s not funny.”
would happen, because who would? But regardless, it was still the same person behind the eyes, whatever colour or shape they had, and whoever was looking out through them wasn’t…all there, as it were.
The impression was aided by Sherlock more or less pushing his face into the crook of John’s neck breathing deeply as he did so, the tension leaking out of his body fast.
Sherlock opened his mouth to…either to say something snarky and unhelpful, mostly likely, or instead to ask a question of his own, or possibly several, about the state of John himself. Not to answer the question posed, that was for certain.
This was it, after all. It was something he had been longing and hoping for, for four years and never thought he would get. Now it was within his grasp and he wasn’t going to allow anything to mess that up for him.
“Called?” he interrupted; his voice was sharp. “What do you mean, ‘called’? When did he call you?”
That…wasn’t how that worked but did that really matter? Sherlock had a point, and in any case, this did go somewhat deeper than normal wedding vows.
“Not always but I try,” he replied.
In a strange but not unpleasant or uncomfortable way, that felt to the admittedly entirely inexperienced in such areas younger Holmes as a wedding vow, especially with the solemnity of the voice and the way it was phrased. Which, of course, in a way was what they were doing, were intending to do once they’d…well, not in so many words and there wouldn’t be a cake to cut, but –
Even knowing that it was his mind’s manifestation of John rather than the man himself, Sherlock couldn’t help the feeling of grateful pride and joy.
Someone tapped him on the shoulder. Annoyed with who felt it was okay to disturb him just like that – and attempting to crush the tiny hopeful thought that it might be John, after all – he turned on the chair he’d managed to commandeer for himself, ready to deliver a scathing remark to the interloper.
that he was in contact with his little girl, had possibly met her, interacted with her. Possibly more than –
That was Mycroft. He hadn’t mentioned anything that the Omega didn’t already know but that didn’t stop it from being reassuring, which was undoubtedly the point.
Even if everything else went wrong, so long as John said yes, and meant it, then it was all alright. It was all that mattered. Sherlock could be happy, then. Not that he hadn’t been happy up to – oh, why did he have to qualify each statement all of a sudden? It was maddening in its uselessness, not to mention its completely baffling mystery origin.
John’s hand on his shoulder tightened, trying to prevent Sherlock from moving away. It wasn’t forceful, however, just enough to be a clear indicator that he wanted him to stay and perhaps also to listen.
“Of course.”
That pleading, that naked vulnerability that was too lost and flickering to be anything but genuine got through to the doctor, and not just because it was that of the lost creature pleading for help.
Had John planned something himself?
“That was not what I said.”
The arms alone were enough to make that impression but the scent coming off her, the purer, cleaner scent of a child that had not yet reached the added layers and hormones that puberty would bring, made the sale, as it were.
“Hi,” he said, “I’m John.”
John guided him over to a wall to lean against and he sank against it, if only so that he didn’t sink against the compact body beside him.
In the end, as he couldn’t find anything that was remotely suitable. At least, not before John had moved forward, seemingly not entirely of his own accord.
The corner of the upper lip curled for a brief moment, as though the man was trying to suppress the instinct of the Alpha, the hackles raised at the direct challenge.
He didn’t say that out loud, though, aware of how that might come across. “I’m not the only danger.”
“Bit late to claim ownership now, isn’t it?” Though the voice was still dripping amusement, John could see as he turned that it was confined to the voice, the amber of the eyes not having returned to brown.
The next one, sent straight afterwards, read ‘It’s brilliant, though. Just…not what I would’ve thought you’d go for.’
“I’m…I want to keep that, too. All of it and so much more,” he said, feeling exposed but pressing on. “Everything that we do, that you do. I never would have thought it before I met you but I…I don’t ever want to be without you in my life again, and I…”
“I’m saying no such thing.”
Sherlock let it slide, as there was no heat in the comment, only warmth, which seemed to transfer over to him. He sat down and, being a little daring, chose to sit quite close beside the other teen. Not so close that they were touching but certainly closer than acquaintanceship would normally dictate.
“Mycroft was making a statement to anyone who might be watching. He will have stopped as he stepped out of his car, letting the cameras see him before he walked into the building, and done the same when he walked out, both letting his own people know where he is and sending a message.”
“I don’t know, John. I wish I did, and I am sorry for dragging you into it.”
“John? John, can you hear me? John!”
“Perhaps he’ll be willing to share, come the end.”
John stood his ground, however, and grabbed Sherlock’s arm to stop him. “No. We’re staying. I’m fine.”
Sherlock managed to smile a little through the expression. “Seems I’m not the sole person in the room who’s studied a bit more than ‘required reading’.”
The question was…comprised of several smaller questions, actually. Why do this, exactly? Would John want to? If he did, would he want to do it now? Would it be going too fast? For John, not for him, but still. What was the best way to go about it? Was there a risk that he could muck it up somehow and what should he do to prevent that?
It broke his heart even as it swelled in his chest with love for this wonderful, enigmatic, strange, contradictory, intelligent, lost, lonely, uncertain man who’d somehow found John where no one ever would think to look, and definitely never would look at him twice, and had, then and over and over again since, said, with his words and his actions, that John was an active choice, an option that he would choose always.
Sherlock didn’t know her, beyond what he could deduce and had been told, but her unconscious body, unquestionably in the throes of Heat judging by both sight and scent, writhing feebly but with a limpness that went beyond even the worst tail-ends of Heat and a pallor to her skin, had made his skin crawl and his Alpha instincts rise, not to mount her but to protect her from harm.
“Hello?” he snapped in a whisper, suspicion in his voice.
He paused, uncertain. Should he tell him? It was probably pathetic and would only serve to lower him in John’s estimation. The smart thing was just to brush it off and pretend like it hadn’t happened.
Judging by his bond mate’s face and scent, then, along with his own observations, the Beta was at least not lying about being traumatised.
His chest warmed a little each time he thought of that.
“No, I do not
Of course, it didn’t exactly take a genius to work out
In short, there was a very good reason they were only obtained through less than legal means.
One thing that did frustrate him with these more thorough and frankly scientific studies was that even though they went through many aspects of Alpha behaviour that would properly explain, and most often overrule, ‘motherly wisdom’, neither of them spoke of whether this was all still the case when it was a scent bond.
“No, of course not!” The answer was immediate and possibly, automatic. Possibly not, of course, but there was something there, that was for sure.
That wasn’t to say he’d been exactly overflowing with such gestures in the meantime, but John hadn’t seemed to mind. He’d just seemed happy when Sherlock made the effort, possibly because he knew that when the younger Holmes did them, it was because he wanted to rather than because he felt an obligation to. Which was how so many others tended to view things, or so he’d told Sherlock one day when Father’s Day rolled around. Or had it been Mother’s Day? Did it matter?
So, now all that was left for John was wait as he tried to keep Sherlock as well as possible, given the circumstances.
The last word was a bark, one that belonged to a German shepherd rather than a pug.
John’s voice had risen to almost a shout at that point and his face had taken on that particular expression he used when he was angry but also couldn’t believe he was having this argument.
He trailed off, a noise of frustration leaving him as he pressed his hand harder against his head.
Oh, fuck, there would be a reception, too, wouldn’t there? It wouldn’t be done with the proposal.
“You didn’t turn it off.” It wasn’t phrased as question but nevertheless, John made an expansive gesture, presumably to include all the dragon appendages.
“It’s fine, Sherlock.”
It might be that Sherlock’s flaws were greater than most, both because of and in spite of his massive brain, but the man inside was…
So, perhaps, finding it deeply unsettling to have such blanks in his mind that he didn’t create himself, he ought to try and at least get John to tell him what had happened, however unpleasant that might be.
“Why would I be scared of you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know. It’s…my gran used to phrase it like that, she looked after me and my sister a lot when we were kids, and if I don’t concentrate, then when I need to use the expression, that slips out instead. Don’t you have – and why are you smiling like that?”
Look at what that had brought him so far, for one!
Surely, though, he knew that. He’d lived his life with the berk for some time by now without much indication that Sherlock thought well of him or considered him a friend.
Sherlock heard, however, and heard what wasn’t being said, too. He spoke quickly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Whose benefit was this really for?
He was not a rock, not to his bond mate. The one person, apart from his children, that he owed to be as much of a rock to as possible.
Snippets of the conversation he’d had while John had been out on his little tour and unintended shopping trip came back to him, oddly disjointed and fragmented for being something that he hadn’t deleted even though he’d wanted to, and –
“Why would
Trust his interfering twat of a brother to pick if not
“Not before you handed it to me, no.”
“Sorry, remembered what?”
Maybe it was only him that would be able to scent it on the clothing, it being too faint and too old for others but that didn’t matter. He knew it was hers. Could only ever be hers.
Something he’d read in a book long ago swam back into his mind, something about werewolves; that they were neither humans nor were they wolves. They were werewolves, whatever shape they currently occupied. Neither one nor the other and yet, at the same time, both.
As for the people who’d raised her, that was…that had simultaneously become clearer and more complicated at once after they’d met them, somehow, and his heart felt strange thinking about it. Even more so than previously.
, surprisingly clearly and distinctly, two small beans of grainy grey, essentially, with some strange nubs on them, lying close together.
Though he hadn’t specified, he felt sure that Sherlock understood what was meant by ‘this’, too.
“I do understand why you haven’t rushed straight into an explanation, John,” he said, with quiet sincerity, looking up at the other and thinking he spotted just the smallest hint of colour high in his cheeks.
Free.
“You are.”
“I know, I was trying to stop – “
Wait, what? What the hell was he saying? That wasn’t what he had intended, much less wanted to say. It was still true, but that wasn’t how he was supposed to start it off. If anything, this was going to undermine it.
Looking about him, he tried to feel out where the different parts, grown and bloomed as they had in the time between his last conscious visit here and now, of his feelings towards John were placed.
“Why is it so hard for you to believe that you’re worth kissing?”
Well, then. Nothing like sending his heartrate into the stratosphere. Especially after the day he’d already had. But it didn’t matter. What mattered was his mate.
So, then, the coast was clear, as it were, for Sherlock to spin the Frenchman a story about how they were in fact a part of a new branch of the police force that had only just started up but which dealt specifically with the trafficking of children and young people.
The printed text seemed to be a page of details on some baby, which was being made ready for adoption after spending the first few weeks of its life in a children’s home. The date on the paper indicated that this wasn’t a recent event and some rather crucial details were missing, such as the exact date of birth, any name of a parent or whether it had been brought to the home or born there.
“Moriarty knows perfectly well, and even if the harem owners aren’t bright enough to work it out for themselves, he might tell them the location.”
“Wishful thinking?” she suggested gently after a pause to think.
Sherlock seems to surface at last. >How will he react?
“I’m here, Sherlock. I’m here. It’ll be okay. I promise.”
There was no denying that his hands found it often enough and that it most definitely was something he caressed throughout the night. Not the only thing, of course, but it was certainly a favourite.
“Yes, it still exists. Mummy refused to get rid of it, on the practical grounds that it might be needed one day.”
“Can you be sure of that, though?” John asked, the edges of his smile a jagged shard. “That’s who you are, Sherlock. That’s who you’ve always been, in all the time I’ve known you. You don’t do things by half, do you? It’s either everything and nothing. Middle ground don’t exist and neither does temperate, mellow or measured. I’m not doubting your good intentions, not in the slightest, and I know that they are good. That you’d follow them but…but then you’d overextend yourself on that, somehow. Make the middle ground into the extreme.”
Noticing that Sherlock was unusually, possibly worryingly, quiet, John turned his attention back to his bond mate, opening his mouth to be ready to reprimand him again, not unkindly, if he looked about to deliver a verbal jab, after all.
Bloody hell, this was all such a mess, from top to bottom, wasn’t it?
Sherlock?”
Which was why this assignment was simultaneously the best and the worst thing possible.
The moment he did could be the moment Moriarty did something horrible. To John or Tessa, or to the twins. He could not afford to risk that.
Risk – oh. Had he done that, too? Well, it was within the array of tactics dragons employed when they wanted to claim a sentient being as their treasure, he knew that, and a not uncommon one, either, so it wasn’t strange to assume that he had used it, too. Despite that knowledge, the fact that he had, that was what startled and unsettled him.
? John wasn’t boring or uninteresting, he wasn’t that down about himself, but he was no genius, either, nothing to catch the attention of the Irishman. His appeal to Moriarty could only be through his connection with Sherlock, and even then, he’d miscalculated greatly if he thought that Sherlock would be hurt by this turn of events.
One who tried to be better, throughout this whole endeavour, than he had been, and that wasn’t even going into what it appeared he was willing to sacrifice in order to make sure that no harm came to John again.
The possibility that he might not get here at all was one that Sherlock tried not to think of but which he couldn’t shake in its entirety. Enough so that he’d gone over possible reasons why he might not make it here, including that he just didn’t want to. That latter one he’d pushed away with everything he had. It was unnecessary and unrealistic.
“I wasn’t suggesting that either, now was I?” John interrupted, just a little bit sharply. “Not talking about it to me isn’t the same as burying it altogether, now is it? You can keep it to yourself and discuss it in your mind until you’ve constructed several different versions all with their own drawer. Or you can talk to Mycroft, instead, see what he says. If that’s what helps, then by all means.”
The dragon must’ve found out he’d not only spotted the jealousy and grabbed it but that it was melting away as he held it.
“But yes, we shall, and then bring her home.”
It was only logical. Of course, John would have somewhere else to be after the time allotted to the meeting. Why wouldn’t he? His schedule was probably rather packed, easy-going, friendly person like him.
Oh, god, the very thought of having your mind destroyed like that, without his input or any way to prevent or reverse the effect, that was beyond horrifying.
That was only for a brief though painful moment, however. Then one hand detached from his face to wrap around the hand pressing on his throat, pulling at it such that it automatically pressed into John’s throat as it skidded across it, clutching for purchase. It was only the force and speed with which it was done that prevented any serious damage. As it was, it did manage to cause thick welts and outright cuts, though thankfully none where it might prove dangerous.
“No, I think – and I’m not arguing with you like you’re five.”
It sounded decisive not to mention sincere, but even so…
His instincts were screaming at him, too, yes, but they weren’t the reason he overcame his previous…was it analysis paralysis they called it? They were not what slid his feet millimetre after millimetre to the side, closer and closer, in small enough increments that it wouldn’t be noticed…
Oh, there wouldn’t be one, he assured, watching as the man relaxed a little further, thinking himself saved.
That was worrying, for several reasons. But right now, the most immediate point was that the Alpha needed some support, even if he wasn’t going to acknowledge it and certainly wasn’t going to ask for it.
“Put it in your mouth.”
The words ‘then I’ll continue not to make that mistake’ flittered painfully through his mind at that, along with the expression on Sherlock’s face as he said them, and he briefly closed his eyes against them. As though that would help.
Please take care of yourself, still.
Either way, he’d be beyond angry, and he was. He was practically vibrating with it, even if the vibrations were small.
Thank you to everyone for the kind feedback on the first chapter, whatever form it's taken. Sequels I'm always extra nervous about so the encouragement and interest touched me. Fingers crossed it's not just postponed yeah?
It was such a small thing. An insignificant thing that represented so much. That changed so much and yet nothing at all. He didn’t want it to be difficult, let alone this difficult. It shouldn’t be so difficult. What was there to make such a big fuss over? He wanted to live as they had, but possibly even better than they had.
Mycroft thought that he was tempting fate by letting it remain such a halfway state. That it was unsustainable to have just the one human so close, both physically and mentally, for such a long time, without formally claiming him, and that it would lead to either John crumbling under the push-and-pull of belonging and being pushed away or Sherlock’s instincts snapping and taking over, claiming him as hoard treasure and nothing more.
It might be that but then again, Sherlock never learned how to do things by half, did he?
Sherlock bit his lip for a moment then seemed to resolve whatever issue he’d had.
They seemed to see right through him without comprehending him at all. Cupid bow lips were pulled back just slightly, so the sharpness of the teeth was visible.
Speaking of thrown, the next thing the doctor knew, his lips was more or less attacked by cupid bow ones, pressing against his hard and if not outright demanding that he should part his, at least asking very, very intently.
He froze, blue eyes staring at the timepiece in front of him before flickering up to meet pale eyes. For a long moment, he didn’t say anything or try to take it. He just continued to stare at the other.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded. “Mycroft, who has then also called an ambulance or rather, has called the one in charge of the nearest hospital and the ambulance service in general.”
Another pause, longer than before. In fact, it was long enough that John pocketed the phone and started to look again. Could it have been kicked out into the kitchen by accident? He supposed he hadn’t checked whether it had somehow, though he had no idea how or why, got itself wedged between the cushions of his own chair. Sherlock’s chair, perhaps, or more logically, that of the sofa.
I know it's not the longest of chapters but it's not short, either, even if it does end like it does. It still isn't exactly easy to write. Not for me, at least, which perhaps goes to show...But it's here and it's something and I hope it was worth the wait and a fitting outcome, as it were. If not...I tried.
Perhaps it was also a factor that this wasn’t some random person or even just someone he’d managed to form an emotional connection with. This was John. His John, which made it significant all on its own.
“Sherlock…you do realise that there’s not a time limit on this, right?”
Let's be careful out there, everyone. Please.
“For what it’s with, it doesn’t sound stupid to me,” he said when he pulled back. “It sounds sweet, in its own strange way. Thank you.”
“Not what I was going to say, but yeah, I suppose that, too.” John squeezed the hand in his again. “How are you feeling? And there’s no ulterior motive, no correct answer to that, by the way. Any answer is just as valid and correct, alright?”
‘You mentioned the concert world – is that what you’re going for yourself? – SH’
It was scoping out whether there had been anything that they could use. Anything that might tell them more about the environment that Tessa had lived in for, presumably, the last four years and perhaps something about her parents as well.
“And then you’ll go back to your own bed?” It was more than a little trying to keep his voice neutral, let alone soft.
John had no way of detecting the reaction the brunet had had when he’d discovered he was gone, that he couldn’t sense him, either.
Before he went up to the upstairs bedroom, and he wasn’t stalling because of memories that hung around that room, he gave himself a once-over check.
things, was what he was worrying about?
“When did he try – when he was leaving after I’d…I’d come back…?” John nodded. “But that was – “
‘Not yet. That’s actually why I’m texting you.’ Honestly, why he hadn’t called him instead…and he knew why, of course, but it was a whole lot quicker to call. ‘I know which object I need for…but I can’t find it anywhere.’
“Then I shall promise the same, is that alright?”
It was only when the sense of calm in both body and mind hit him that he realised the clamour there’d been in his mind, and that he’d gone tense, on edge.
“So is your brain, if we’re going to be ruddy pedantic about it, and you’re bleeding well proud of
John learns more about dragons while he attempt to help his friend battle whatever is going on.
“Happy anniversary, Sherlock, and merry Christmas, too.” He leaned up and kissed the brunet’s cheek.
Why was he…? Didn’t that break…or perhaps they’d had no illusion. Or at least, John didn’t. Sherlock was fluent in French, including the accent, because of course, but you could probably still hear John’s English accent in whatever French he spoke.
Design – oh. Of course.
Oh, shut up, for once! I know, alright? No need to keep pushing the point, I know!
“All the other experiences I’ve had, that desire has clawed its way to the surface sooner or later, normally sooner, and I’ve had to stop so as not to accidentally do it while in the throes of it.”
“It’s…it’s not…it’s…I…”
With John saying yes, too, of course. That was also…that rather went before everything else.
“Sherlock, first off, there is a difference between temporarily forgetting and not knowing at all throughout. I am hardly completely unaware of the fact that I’m pregnant, and secondly, I don’t expect to have another go-around, so I can’t see what you’d be prepared
But that was just what he’d do. Protect him, and by that extension Mycroft, by escaping. Not forever, he still didn’t believe that would ever work, but long enough that he could make it to Whitehall, to Mycroft’s offices and warn whatever-she-called-herself-at-moment. As Mycroft’s PA she’d know, as well as know what to do about it.
“Ideally, I would have liked to have brought her with me to choose herself but as that is rather a wish for the future and not the present, given the…situation in question, this will have to suffice. I was assured by the assistant that it was something that a girl of four would adore.”
He didn’t even care that he was going around in circles a little or that the dragon might realise what he was doing.
In hindsight, he couldn’t help but wonder, not to mention curse himself, for not picking up on the facts sooner. After all, it wasn’t as though the scent was exactly subtle or that he’d forgotten he was there.
Sherlock’s beam of pride was contained within his heart but only just about.
From the depths of his darkest thoughts, something whispered, ‘
But he knew about bodies that didn’t want to cooperate, didn’t he?
Said brat tried to protest but a slight shift – never a squeeze, not even a little, there was no need to get nasty – of John’s hand shut him up for long enough that their coffees were made. John paid and herded the younger Omega over to somewhere a bit quieter. More secluded.
was doing it and how far he would continue to push at them if left to his own devices.
Those two he’d been going over, finding several points that he made sure that he saved to his hard drive.
“Wholly responsible.” Even if he wasn’t, Sherlock would say so, because otherwise, the risk of John taking on responsibility for it, any responsibility at all, was real, even if it was obvious that he shouldn’t.
But it wasn’t quite that sudden, was it? He’d said something to that effect earlier and had sounded just as scared then. Why? Was it something that had cropped up only after the reveal of Moriarty’s and by extension Sherlock’s nature or had it been present before then and had merely been pushed to the forefront?
Why hadn’t she reacted? Was she no longer conscious? But Moriarty would know that, as he could see her face. She obviously would care so was she merely not surprised? Sherlock would look and ascertain it for himself, only that would mean he’d have to take his eyes off Moriarty. With everything at stake, and the other Alpha having the upper hand whatever the bonded pair might try to pretend, he couldn’t afford that.
Sherlock did. He thought he had earlier. To be honest, he thought he hadn’t stopped feeling it since he’d tied it but when he focused on it, he realised that that wasn’t quite right. The awareness of it with a calmer mind, assisted by the continued presence of ‘John’, meant that he could feel not just the rope itself, the strength and flexibility of it. He could also feel how it continued to spread and exactly what parts of the dragon it touched.
who was instinctively driven to collect and hold onto something like that no matter what? Regardless of how illogical it was or how detrimental to someone he clearly cared very deeply about, even if he was – they both were, to be honest, and John wouldn’t have thought either cared much prior to all this – normally rubbish at showing it, he couldn’t prevent himself from doing it, you could tell from the look in his eyes.
“Yes, I bloody well do.” He glanced out the window, then back. Undoubtedly assessing just what time it was. It was about time he got something to tell the time with, like a proper watch or a phone. “It’s already far past – why did you let me sleep that long?”
It wasn’t so much the Alpha posturing, really, or the prejudice and abuse you could suffer in all three because of your secondary gender; horrible as it sounded to say, at least the harem made no bones about it and didn’t try to sugar coat it in a veneer of equality and like opportunity for all, which often enough only created another layer for those being oppressed or otherwise violated to break through.
John opened his mouth, then paused. “Touché. Not now, though. I just don’t believe that you’d do it while you’re…well, there, mentally.”
Sherlock got out of the car and John clambered after him, still not quite used to having to manoeuvre with the extra weight and shape in front of him, at least not when it came to something like a car.
The hand that had returned to his gently lifted both their hands and slotted them together for a better, firmer grip. Then he squeezed once again.
Instead, for Mycroft, it was ‘to be found’, which meant that they weren’t there to be found. I.e., they didn’t exist
No, it hadn’t. It was simply that…that too much was happening at once. He would’ve scoffed at the cliché at play here, only it was hard to when it was happening to you. It definitely wasn’t helpful.
If they got into trouble, then he was only a call away – he was as interested in getting a niece as Sherlock was in being her adoptive father, which was a little bit strange, all things considered, but mainly, it was terribly sweet – but someone needed to stay and make sure things worked.
The elder Holmes glanced back at the former soldier. “I’ll explain it later. Right now, the wounds need to be treated.”
“We’ll fetch a better price at auction?”
Then Sherlock reached out a hand and, gently, took the phone from the doctor, who didn’t attempt to hold on to it. The speaker was switched back off, presumably to spare John, and the brunet held it up to his ear, already frowning, though whether in concentration, irritation, sleepiness, or a combination thereof wasn’t evident.
But that did tie into why he had trouble believing Mycroft that the issue was rooted in something before all of this. If it did, why hadn’t Sherlock spoken up about it? Or at least shown signs? Any kind of signs, really. John felt sure that if he had, he would’ve picked up on them at some point.
Then another came straight afterwards. ‘I’ll make it up to you, promise. It’s just that I’ve got…I really am sorry about this. Promise I’ll make it up to you. See you at the concert?’
Someone that he recognised.
He kicked again, with the same horribly muted response.
John smiled, a smile which became a beam before he reached the cupid bow lips for a kiss. It turned French but it wasn’t about passion. Just about connection and joy and relief and togetherness. It was just about them.
That particular list was growing rather large, wasn’t it?
Apropos feelings, a feeling of relief and burgeoning hope put out its small but tentatively blooming bud at the knowledge that dragon instinct didn’t immediately come in and take over that feeling.
He was asleep before he was even aware that he’d begun to drop.
Mycroft seemed rather adamant, though, and so John’s frown seemed to serve to frustrate him, or at least annoy him.
The downside of this being quicker (while I am still struggling a bit here) is that I have not been checking this through at all. Apologies if there are mistakes or something seems confusing, more than usual, that is.
“I need to know how…how I –”
“Yes. I did.” He stepped up real close to the other Omega and even if his scent wasn’t strong, to say the least, he thought the other might just pick up on it somewhat. He might at least pick up on the pregnancy notes and fainter whiffs of normal Omega markers that followed, and from that deduce the rest.
It was hardly difficult to work out what he was alluding to.
John folded his arms over his chest, refusing to acknowledge the calling of his name. “And you know what? If that’s the case, then quite frankly, I would rather get it fucking over with, too, so that I can put all of this mind-bending horseshit behind me and go back to living my life.”
Towards John – who didn’t bristle or otherwise took umbrage with the implications, and not because he merely wasn’t able to understand what was being said. He followed just fine…well, almost, there were some of the more colourful expressions from the driver that he wasn’t quite sure he understood, but on the whole, yeah.
The doctor didn’t even blink at the frankly baffling non-sequitur.
Even so, it didn’t matter. The important point right now was helping Sherlock.
For all that, John couldn’t find it in himself to wake him. So he turned himself around from their impromptu spooning – being little spoon was an experience that…wasn’t novel but had been long enough ago that it almost qualified as such, though that didn’t make it unpleasant in any way – and sat up, being extraordinarily careful not to jostle or otherwise disturb the still sleeping figure.
He tried not to think about a bullet accidentally getting underneath or ricocheting off his scales and somehow managing to hit John that way, in a way that he might not notice and therefore wouldn’t react to.
then, had he? He couldn’t have known that John was that perfect of a match for him, could he? How could he? People tolerated Sherlock, and that was at best.
“What?”
And the point where he wanted to give the two Holmes brothers a very tight hug, at the same time, was probably a very good one to choose.
“Oh?” the brown-eyed man asked. “Are we expecting an addition to the party, then? How delightful. It
“Yeah, saw that one coming. You aren’t jealous of him romantically, that’s not what I’m saying. At least, not in the way you understand it. Romance, that is, though, come to think of it, jealousy, too.”
The tension seemed to have slowly leaked out for them both, which was a relief, in more ways than one.
He blinked, his vision blurring and darkening, and the next thing he knew, his face was being pressed into the area of Sherlock’s neck where the scent gland was. Involuntarily, he inhaled, the scent helping, as before, to quell his rising fear and panic and replace it with…not tranquillity but a peace of mind that allowed him to think again after a little while and some deep inhalations. It didn’t take away the fear or the other emotions floating about in his mind, but it did give him back the reins.
Which was why he had set it up so that he would be getting one text, when John left the last place that he was meant to go to that would send him here. He’d debated with himself whether that was necessary or even if he should rather not have anything at all but…
“Nope,” John replied, popping the ‘p’ slightly, on purpose. “I’m afraid you’ll have to make do with tap water, I’m afraid. Or make a cold brew yourself. But this isn’t comfort food, this is pure subsistence food.”
He let go of the hand in his and was about to divest himself of the clothes, including his jacket which he’d forgotten to take off as he came in, trying mentally to sort through at least some of what had transpired today, when he heard but more than that felt the bed dip beside him.
The last time he’d sung out loud was when he’d been forced to be part of his primary school’s play at age nine, and he had no intention of changing that fact now.
in doing that, to John or anyone else. Things were fine as they were.
“Like with the competition they have going for her affection, you mean?”
So, what he opened his mouth for in the end was to ask questions that would confirm to him, one way or another that John wasn’t under the sway of the dragon in some way.
“It seems that I have overstayed my welcome. In case you should need it, I will stay close until it is safe.”
That – and it didn’t escape him either that though the slight possessiveness showed its face yet again, it was rooted in him as a person rather than him as a gender – not only lifted a stone from John’s strangely heavy heart but made him smile.
That in itself wasn’t surprising, the elder brother admonishing the younger. Par for the course, really.
In the time he’d assumed that Moriarty had been at least a semi-regular visitor to the house she’d been brought up in, he had not truly considered the possibility that he would interact with her enough for some kind of relationship – and even that word felt wrong to so much as think in context – and certainly not this kind, to this extent.
“So?”
So, instead he decided to pull his clasped hand back towards himself, so that he could kiss the long fingers, keeping eye contact while he did so.
Good grief, he was actually…the last time he’d crossed from England to France, or the other way, it didn’t really matter, he’d been going by less than official channels, too, but it had been rather less glamorous than a plane that would be only for two.
That very experience said that they didn’t need to hurry, as such, but at the same time, that time was of the essence. Both of which tallied with John’s own experience with Moriarty.
“John?” he asked again, worried.
John frowned at him, not quite getting at what he meant. No, honestly, he didn’t get what he meant at all. This issue, by which John would think he meant Sherlock’s struggles with retaining control and his subsequent attempts to claim the doctor for his treasure, had actually started with Moriarty.
“What? What are you on about?”
“Why would he be interested in her?” John insisted.
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?” he repeated, stronger than before but still as gentle as he could make it. “What’s happened?”
“But…it’s been years since they…they took her, and he wasn’t there at the time. I would know if he were. It doesn’t make any sense why there would be anything linking her…”
There was an intake of breath at that, but it never manifested into anything more.
Of all things to say, why would he go with
Sherlock rose back up to his feet and looked down at his doctor. “I believe I am repeating myself, at least in essence, when I say that you’re allowed to lean on me. That’s what couples do, as far as I’m aware, though I admittedly do not have the most extensive experience in that regard, and not just Alpha-Omega couples. Across the board, I do believe that is part of what is considered a healthy relationship, even if the Alpha-Omega couples have tended towards an unequal balance.”
“You could’ve refused to sell me any after you learned that.”
Oh. Embarrassment. Really? Of all things, this was what he found embarrassing? Sherlock had no boundaries; shame and embarrassment was something that happened to other people. Was it really embarrassment, then? Discomfort?
It would of course only be when he made it all the way back to the surface, as it were, that he could say with certainty that they were out but just the amount that he managed to make them withdraw, almost recoil, that was enough for him to gain some much needed headspace.
That he registered as a dragon now as he hadn’t before was borne out by the reaction the younger brother suddenly had to him, snarling in face as well as voice. He raised himself up into a kneeling position as he turned to face the ginger, freeing John a little, or, as he was still somehow somewhat hunched over him, at least giving him more room to breathe and, importantly, move. Without the teeth being inches or less from piercing his throat.
Of course, it wasn’t as though he had it fresh in his nostrils, exactly, and one might argue that the dress that Alpha – who, according to the information they found, was called Moran – had brought John could provide just as much relevant and accurate information about her scent as the Omega’s own memory, if not more.
John was going to be the support for his partner, his bond mate, whenever he needed it and for as long as he needed it.
But he couldn’t change that. Couldn’t protect those as well, and the knowledge tore him apart. His heart hammered and yet stopped as he thought of John, right behind him and up close with the person that had haunted them for so long.
Even so, he couldn’t help making a mental note to somehow get to visit them soon. Not that he thought he’d be prevented, either by his Alpha or his brother, but there seemed to be so many things that needed sorting, and with the threat that the owners still posed…with the threat
It looked like…like John’s gun. Only, it wasn’t, of course, because that was safely outside in the real world. This didn’t even seem capable of working, which was a shame, as –
If things worked out as he hoped, excessively improbable as that sounded right now, then it would be the best taste that he could imagined.
“Ehm, as far as I can see, around a dozen or so. But Sherlock, they don’t have to have been registered at the time. Not every harem does so – “
The brain did do funny things, though. Sometimes things are too big to focus on, too painful or difficult and just too huge to deal with, and so your brain fixates on something small and concrete – and often entirely inconsequential or even irrelevant in the circumstances – and tries to deal with that instead.
At least, there wasn’t any visible damage.
“The point isn’t to relay a detailed account of my sexual debut, whatever you might think.” John opened his mouth to correct him, but a raised eyebrow snapped it shut again. “The point is that when I had that experience, it didn’t get very far and that wasn’t due to me being sex-averse. It didn’t get very far simply because when I tried, I felt a growing hunger in me in relation to the person I was with.”
Their familiar bickering, even if the topic was still very bizarre, felt comforting. So comforting and familiar, in fact, that the blond hadn’t noticed that Sherlock had moved steadily if minutely closer during that whole exchange and was now less than a foot away from him, the hand still where he’d originally placed it.
He could function just fine. He
Speaking of the watch, however –
Then he chuckled and moved his thumb over John’s cheek in what with others might be called a caress. John couldn’t help a shudder, despite his best efforts to suppress it.
But Sherlock wasn’t talking anymore. Instead, he had closed his eyes and was breathing through his nose, fast and shallow though evidently trying to calm it down.
“Whatever you need, then, go and find it,” he said, without moving his gaze off his unresponsive friend. “I’ll keep watch over him until you return, alone. You have my number.”
But with such a limited cash flow as he currently had, he should’ve been smart enough to know to stick with window shopping.
He had been out before after he had escaped the harem and been released from hospital, that was true enough. But that had been together with Sherlock and what was more, it had been with a specific purpose in mind – and even then, he hadn’t entirely escaped that strange sensation of being out among people.
Unless…unless he was missing something. But what could that possibly be?
With all this in mind, it was rather a wonder that he hadn’t collapsed before now. As it was, he just about managed to stay awake long enough that he could settle himself on his side beside the lanky body instead of collapsing on top of it when he succumbed to sleep.
He blinked, unaware that he’d been absent for a moment until he felt the heat of the other’s body next to him.
The hands let go of his ankles, though, with the speed of someone who’d been burned, an observation which John couldn’t help finding slightly amusing, given the nature of the brunet.
“Yes, and no. Though I don’t know exactly which studies you’ve found, I can make an educated guess on at least one of them, since it’s been the leading study since before I finished med school, and we were expected to read it. That looked at the chemical reactions, including hormonal, that occurs when an Alpha is put through the wringer that is a pregnant partner, isolating which ones occurred in different groups, including bonded versus non-bonded and an Omega or Beta partner, and correlating those findings with the instinctual behaviour, linking particular behaviours with specific concentrations of this or that chemical.”
“Yeah. I’m not that daft, ta, I could see that, even if it wasn’t what you always do. What you were thinking about, was what I was asking – and don’t fob me off with ‘nothing’ or similar.”
“Do you? That makes one of us.” It was the brunet’s turn to give the other a long look. “Alright, yeah, I…I needed to make sure of what state you were in to begin with before I...”
“Hardly,” John replied, thankfully not sounding or otherwise appearing angry or annoyed with the brunet, “which you know as well as I do, because otherwise you wouldn’t try to deflect in that way.”
Before they had a chance to do much more than briefly smile at each other for the jumble, the door was opened, or possibly more accurately wrenched open.
For a moment, the pupils contracted to mere lines of black, which was the only outward sign that ‘John’ had managed to hit home with his comments. When they widened again, they were still thinner slivers than they’d been when they opened.
He would like John’s memory of him to be positive, at least, sappy and sentimental though that sounded. Wasn’t he allowed a bit of sentimentality this once?
And that was another whole thing that he shouldn’t be thinking about right now.
Truly, for all its cunning, it was stupid.
Possibly, he would do all three, which really would be quite understandable, if perhaps not exactly reasonable.
It sneered, laughingly, as though it had exposed the fatal flaw in his logic. Beneath it, barely detectable but nevertheless there was a vibrato that said otherwise, if you cared to listen. Sherlock very much cared to listen, though he hardly needed to.
A hand came up again to forestall Sherlock making any comment there, and he continued. “That seems all well and good and thorough, and for the time, I suppose it was. What they did
What made him less than horrified that Moriarty was playing with them like that wasn’t even that he’d had dealings with the Alpha before and might therefore expect it. It was that, too, but not exclusively that.
Especially when Sherlock’s claim of his brother being the British Government didn’t seem as farfetched an idea as it once had, which meant far longer hours even than normal civil servants, far greater things to juggle and a lot more stress than anyone else.
“No need to mince words, John. I know what I am.”
Right. No reason to do it down here, was there?
It was tempting to just smash it and just have it be over and done with in one fell swoop, or smash, as it were. However, there was no saying whether that would do the trick or if it might in fact somehow make it worse.
“Should I find the doctor?” he asked as soon as he got close, keeping his voice low but not so low that Ruby couldn’t hear him. Her eyes stayed on the Alpha, but she didn’t seem afraid.
“It’s not a crime, John, to be in love with an Alpha, whatever your secondary gender.”
Interestingly, though, he didn’t specify where he’d been. Then again, he didn’t owe Sherlock anything, did he? It wasn’t as though he’d bailed on the time they were supposed to spend together. Practicing. Obviously.
“Fair point, I suppose.” John sighed and rubbed his stomach, absentmindedly. It was beginning to properly round in a way that Sherlock had to admit he found very pleasing. Almost surprisingly so. That was, he didn’t find it surprising to find it pleasing but the degree to which he found It appealing did astonish him a little.
He cut himself off. It was unhelpful and he could feel himself getting angry, which would only make things worse.
“What kind of…” No, not game. Don’t say ‘game’, that’s not what this is, and you know it. Not to Sherlock, in any case, and you don’t need to accuse him like that, even indirectly, “…clues are you picking up by going back and forth like this? Does it have anything to do with the wedding venue or educational opportunities or was that just to…I don’t even know, really.”
As Sherlock tensed up even further at that, John realised what he’d said. But that was the fact of the matter and while he’d go a long way to help his friend and partner deal with things, he didn’t see why he should be the one to traipse around the topic. Not when it was him who’d been affected by it, not Sherlock.
He didn’t offer any greeting. In fact, he didn’t even so much as spare John a glance. The moment the door was open, his eyes focused on the shape of his brother lying prostrate on the sofa. Eyes flickered across the entirety of the body, undoubtedly taking in every detail there that he was not already aware of.
Alright, admittedly – if asked about a week ago, he would’ve utterly denied it but sometimes, introspection on the most unlikely though not unimportant things  can sneak up on you – Sherlock was a factor in that as well, but really, he was only adding kindling to a fire that had already begun to smoulder, sometimes as early as when he started out seeing them.
No, that wasn’t right, was it? John was working on what he knew of Sherlock, wasn’t he? That he’d determine that since Sherlock was a dragon, the value he’d see in John was as part of his collection, and to add insult to injury, he was well aware of the brunet’s skills at manipulation. He didn’t know he was being genuine; he was no mind reader.
“What?”
“Thank you for the offer but we don’t have time.”
The man behind the chair didn’t quite look right, either, for the setting. In fact, incongruous though the expensive suit the man on the rug wore was for the setting, he looked positively suitable in comparison with the other man, Alphas though they both were.
Thankfully, both he and Sherlock had been rather sensible about the placement, and so he would be able to easily free it. Well, easily for him but that was the important bit.
What had he done? It had to be possible to work backwards from what he’d done and apply that to this situation. Of course it was, he merely hadn’t found the way. So, all he needed to do was think, and that was something he was good at, wasn’t it? Supposed to be, at any rate.
Whatever the case, though, it didn’t alter the fact that he would soon need to go up on the stage, one which had been built during the Edwardian era rather than the Victorian, as most of the rest of the school, and perform the song as best he could, solo on his violin.
No, he couldn’t. He wasn’t to know how John would take such a revelation as that, however much of an ability he had to roll with the punches on the oddest of things, was he? It could’ve been a disaster and have robbed him of his only friend if he’d told him and he hadn’t responded well to it.
He had been staring into the dragon’s eye from the very moment he’d first realised it was right outside and had turned around, and yet, he had not felt the slightest pull of it at any point. And while yes, this was only a projection…well, so was he, wasn’t he?
That knowledge alone sent a wave of relief through John. He turned his gaze back down to watch what was left.
John watched him, puzzlement creeping into his features. He put what he’d been holding onto down onto the ground beside him, though his eyes didn’t leave the detective, which meant that he barely missed dropping most of it.
John tries to find a way out of the situation, one way or the other, but one that hopefully won't see him...well...
Sure? Of course I’m – you don’t think I’d do this, all of this, if I were still weighing the options?” Alright, so perhaps his tone was the minutest bit snappy. Could he be blamed for that? Well, possibly, but… “That I would – “
“Trying to sort things, and being gentle about it. Trying to make them right somehow.”
“Realised what?” Sherlock asked. As before, he sounded more genuinely puzzled than anything.
“No, scratch that. I don’t get it at all, honestly, but maybe it has something to do with the gold finally doing its job properly. Or maybe you just had enough time to wrestle control back. Or perhaps a fairy flew in and sprinkled us all with fairy dust. Maybe I’ve dreamed this entire thing, or I’ve just gone so round the bend it’s become a bleeding helter skelter.”
“You are certain it’s him, then?” If the blond tensed at that, it wasn’t discernible in the rest of the tension still in him.
Yes. He did.
The Irishman was dangerous regardless, even when he was playing at being normal, giving the impression of someone unaware and absorbed in what he was doing.
John didn’t try to tug him down, however. It felt more like he was trying to anchor himself somehow, which the brunet certainly didn’t mind.
“What? Oh. No, that was –”
Another was that Sherlock was the one who was hurting and wrongfooted. The one who evidently needed John to be the strong one right now. He might not be able to admit it to himself, trying to force himself to ‘get over’ whatever it was that had spooked him and be useful, but that didn’t alter the facts of the matter.
The reality, however, was that there was a world of difference between the tiny portholes of an aeroplane or even the roaring fish-tank view of a helicopter to the relatively silent glide through the air, the wind ambling rather than rushing past his face and only the beating of powerful wings making the occasional boom in the airspace around them, allowing him to fully enjoy the jewellery that was the city at night, even though the dragon was keeping them away, both in distance and height, from the most brightly lit areas, for obvious reasons.
“I understand why you’re scared, John. I do. I am not demeaning the feeling, nor why you might wish to diminish and discard your experience to better cope with the unmitigated fear of not having a proper identity. You are not who you were, neither before or during the harem, but neither are you someone else, not entirely.”
“How else would you have phrased it, then? To not mention her would only delay the shock, not prevent it, and barging in straight with what we have discovered would only be likely to make the shock greater.”
That, however, did
“No. Groceries and other consumable products do not count as suitable hoard items.”
“Why are we going around, seemingly at random, as well as back and forth, you mean?”
It was made more obvious that it held significance when Sherlock positively roared and grabbed the hand again, this time so that the claws were squeezed between his palm. Not surprisingly, that caused the claws to slice at flesh that, despite everything else, was still humanly soft.
He hadn’t noticed the looks people at the coffeehouse gave him, a good many of them impressed or approving. Neither did he register the younger Omega’s expression as he, which had gone from shocked to stunned to something closer to amazed and perhaps the start of what could be termed ‘smitten’. Nor that he actually called out to him, asking his name, or tried to go after him.
dwelling, was it? It was confronting an issue that he had and that he would have to deal with because he couldn’t see why it would only occur this time. Perhaps it wouldn’t when he was with Sherlock but then, the reaction he’d had in the clothing store had put paid to at least the notion that the Alpha prevented the disconnect he’d felt to the ‘normal’ world.
(See the end of the chapter for
John.
I have written, I have fought and I am so exhausted I want to throw up. But here it is. All 10k words of it. Christ...
It would also be wrong to say that it was now that he’d stepped into character, because that would relegate him back to being a help to his brother, what he could do for him rather than something in himself, and while that wasn’t the most pertinent or immediately important in the current circumstances, it was important in understanding Mycroft Holmes a little bit better. Not much, probably, but even so.
“And then you’ll make me forget?” he asked.
Sherlock frowned in incomprehension and worry but only for a moment. Then, as he understood, he grinned.
He’d managed to get a bit of blood on his fingers as he worked, though, and so he lifted his hand to find a suitable place to wipe it off.
He hadn’t been able to find out too much about her, much as he’d pushed and worked for it, but there had been enough little things that had come together and fitted just a tad too well for John to believe that it wasn’t her that they’d finally located, after searching like mad ever since they received that document.
“I know I don’t need to, and I do not do it because of any instinct or obligation. I do it because you are my mate and I would help you in any way that I possibly can. Especially with something like this.”
“What’s a station got to do with a bear?” Sherlock asked, brows knitted in that special way he had when he was faced with something that he didn’t understand but which was understood by the world around him.
Not furtively and not as though he was a scared Omega frightened of what he might see or otherwise be confronted with when he looked. More like the soldier he’d once been and still was in his bones.
Had he ever touched John gently like that? John had difficulty recalling but he wouldn’t have thought so.
But he did have a plan now. Something to work towards, even if it was in the broad terms – and that some of Mycroft’s suggestions had been ludicrous, to say the least.
Just as the Beta man – it only occurred to the consulting detective later that his name was never given and never asked for, not even by John, though why that might be wasn’t too difficult to work out – had made it, girl and a few hastily grabbed items in hand, to the door leading to the kitchen which would grant him direct access to the garden, a man had appeared in the doorway.
you’re not starving. Actually, perhaps you could do with sitting this one out altogether, darling. Wouldn’t want the missus to seek her fun elsewhere because she can’t find Mr. Happy, would we?”
“I – what?” That was
“Sorry about that,” John said from being him, sounding sincerely contrite. Sherlock turned a little to look at him, one half of the coat still in his hands. “I know how much that means to you and we tried to find another way around it, we really did. But the only way to help was to get to your wounds and we couldn’t get to them with your coat on. But when your wings wouldn’t disappear due to what was in your wounds, then – “
, at the latest, ready for him to pick up. He then, without making a direct reference to a ring, described some of the details of it so as to convince Mycroft that he wasn’t bluffing.
depressing, but it was certainly more ambiguous than John would’ve hoped.
Did Mycroft already know that? Probably, but if he’d known at the time, he wouldn’t have been able to do anything, as French law had yet to outright ban the practice of harems, even if they didn’t explicitly condone them either and they had no extradition agreement with the UK. More likely, in any case, that he’d only been aware since he’d read the contracts, where a few of the Omegas were French, the contracts dated at the same time.
But…if they ignored all the practicalities of it, the thought of having more children, a veritable little pack, that did have some appeal. Was that his own instincts, though? Poking through to persuade him? Very plausible, he had to admit, but on the other hand, whether you had three or four children didn’t make that much difference, did it?
That the world seemed to explode around him. It didn’t matter that he himself was part of that very explosion, either.
“It’ll keep at gossip, John. You’re not the important part in that story, you’re just a means to an end to get to a colleague that isn’t liked.”
Considering that, it was no wonder then that the poor man was scared at having two apparent police officers come to see him or that he hadn’t contacted the police himself after he was assaulted, and his child kidnapped.
That and neither otter nor bee was exactly the most common and uninspired choices, though John would be hard-pressed to work out why those two animals in particular had been chosen.
The last bit came out not quite under his breath.
Once John returned from having led the Beta to his bed, where he’d had another, perfectly understandable bout of sobbing, he stopped, closed his eyes and blew out a deep and heartfelt breath slowly and carefully.
He looked back up at the older brother, joy in his expression. It would be easy to also express a smidgeon of triumph at having been proved right that it would help to wait and see, that it had paid off. He didn’t feel any sense of triumph, however, just a deep and tremendous relief that Sherlock was no longer so comatose as to be completely unresponsive. Which in turn bred a stronger hope that he might just make it all the way back to the surface, as it were, and wake up.
The Frenchman stood between them, his gaze going back and forth, back and forth, before he came to a decision – one which he very much wanted to emphasise to Sherlock and John was a difficult decision for him to make – and made a dash for the front door, which was still open.
There was no such thing as perfect parents, after all, and that included the two of them, just as it included Celeste's adoptive parents. Sherlock still held his doubts about his own abilities as a father, both in relation to Tessa and to the two as yet unborn children. But even without them, there would be issues and times where they ‘failed’. That was, as far as he’d been able to read up on and what John had assured him, inevitable.
He smiled but there wasn’t a lot of humour in it and what there was had the tiniest of edges to it. “Just imagine what you’d say if it had been the other way around, eh?”
It was an important point to make, he felt, a very important one. John may be right, that he didn’t touch others, really, but so what? It wasn’t as though there was any need for him to or use for it, except perhaps when he was on a case, and besides, he didn’t want to touch anybody else, just John. What was so wrong with that?
He squeezed the hand in his. “I just wanted to be sure, that’s all.”
This was one of those times, though, and yet, as he looked around the living room and then into the kitchen, there was no sign that Sherlock had been there for hours, at least.
“It is.”
believe that you picked that one item of significance to me at that specific time for a reason connected to your hoard only because some of the same basic principles applies to the general hoarding tendencies of dragons as to the courting rituals of dragons. Which, according to your brother, you have deleted in its entirety, and that has been part of the issue.”
Such as get closer to Moriarty while he was distracted. Hopefully, he was so, even with her glance just now, too, but they could…this stalemate wasn’t going to continue, and he couldn’t afford to have Moriarty win this. If he took the girl, then…
He was gently smiling as he spoke, though, even if it was somewhat self-deprecating, and thankfully,
Sherlock managed to get himself into a sitting position, John still somehow hovering just above actually touching except for his knees against the hips.
John stood there for a moment, blinking a little, eyebrows trying to collide with his hairline as he stared after the car as it drove away.
But he hadn’t counted on becoming pregnant this time. He didn’t get Heats anymore, not even broken ones like the one that had produced Tessa. As far as he’d known, he was infertile. There’d been nothing to worry about when he’d dealt with Sherlock’s Rut. How was he to know that he’d scent bond with the man, much less actually be impregnated by him? It was a fluke.
Of course, that could be true if it were Tessa, as well, but the point was that it wasn’t conclusive that it was her.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as they flickered about John’s face. Was that really what he thought? But that wasn’t, that wasn’t at all what he’d meant by doing this, why would he…?
I’m so sorry, I’ve just remembered something,” he said and carried on quickly before the assistant’s face could fall. They honestly didn’t deserve that at all. “Don’t know how it slipped my mind. My bond mate is determined to be a very hands-on father and he’s therefore adamant not only that he sees the things that are needed before they are bought but that he tests them, too. Well, the ones that he has to use, anyway.”
“John, I truly am sorry for attempting to claim you like that.”
What? Oh.
And the cliffhanger is back! Can I get a wahoo? No?
A moment’s courage or a lifetime of regrets.
He would’ve said he’d never cared about that and believed himself but honestly, by the mere fact that he’d always been so adamant to defend it, not to mention had almost instinctively bristled at the suggestion that he was ‘less than’…well, that pretty much gave him his answer.
When this was over…the moment they had come home and had made Tessa as settled as she possibly could be, given the circumstances, he would go see them all.
He was sore, he was tired, he’d had enough information and action, of the unpleasant and horrifying kind rather than the exhilarating one he usually saw when he was around Sherlock, to make anybody’s head spin.
After all, that was what he, John, normally did, wasn’t it?
“Sherlock?”
I see but I don’t observe, is that it? he asked his own mind.
When he did notice something was off, it jolted him out of his Mind Palace, where he’d been examining some piece of information relevant to the case, hard, the realisation coming through from his body rather than his mind but no less strong or insistent for that.
, the dragon interrupted, still sneering. The laughter, however, was gone.
Sherlock looked at him, without speaking, for what felt like an uncomfortably long time but probably wasn’t very long. Then he rose from his seat, movement abrupt but still graceful, and strode past John to one of the stacks of papers on the table between the two windows.
“Maybe what?”
He would say it to John. To his face and with no hesitation. Ideally, he would say it while the blond had his arms wrapped around him, beaming at him after having said yes to his proposal, but Sherlock wasn’t picky. He would take any version of that ended with John smiling.
“Maybe not in the traditional sense but you’re pale and you’re swaying a little, now that I can see you,” John said, a possibility dawning on him.
He wasn’t. It was deductions, not assumptions, and they were right.
“You heard me. I know you heard me, you berk, I can see it in your eyes. But yes. The answer is yes, and if it wasn’t meant as a proposal, then I don’t care, I’ll propose myself if I have to. And if it’s a joke of some kind or for a case, I swear I’ll – “
, there was little doubt he’d be used to doing that, but that he’d kiss
And this is hardly a big, dramatic, important chapter to return on, nor a long one. I apologise.
“I’ll keep it under control, don’t worry,” Sherlock said.
How uselessly poetic.
He didn’t say anything more, just sat and waited with somewhat bated breath.
“I swear, I’ve wanted to punch that man more than once throughout all of this,” he confessed in a low voice as they made their way quickly to what they had surmised was the child’s bedroom, as Sherlock had waited for John to return before. “And it has nothing at all to do with the fact that he’s been…well. What a wet rag.”
After what seemed like a long time, John finally spoke. “This ties into you suddenly rolling off me earlier, doesn’t it? You wouldn’t believe such studies unless they correlated with and corroborated knowledge you were already in possession of, but whether that knowledge was self-derived, as it were, that’s another matter.”
Nor could he deny that there was something rather nice about being ‘escorted’ to the bedroom.
John took it and skimmed over the papers, noting just how few occurrences there were of the Greek letter A entwined with the Venus symbol. There were certainly far more than there were of the Omega symbol entwined with either the Mars or the Venus symbol, which were only a total of four, but the bulk of the people on the list was made up of male Alphas and Betas.
“But you don’t want me to acknowledge out loud that it happened, either.”
Maybe it was just the lateness of the hour, the particular mixture of circumstances and Sherlock, and a pot that had boiled over inside of him.
“Sherlock. I don’t know if you can hear me, but I hope you can. I love you.”
Well, it was part of the reason he had deduced John’s limp. Not the main part, admittedly, but it had been there at the time and what was more, it’d become something of a motif, even if John hadn’t known it.
Master…
me as a possession!”
Not that he would object, quite the opposite. It wasn’t as though he hadn’t had time to consider it in the time they’d lived together, and not just because everyone kept assuming that they were already shagging, and he couldn’t deny that the thoughts he’d had about his flatmate previously hadn’t all been very platonic, or platonic at all.
“Everything ready?” Mycroft asked, quietly, looking from one to the other. There was something odd about his expression; steely and cool and yet with an earnest concern that seemed almost orphaned on his face, if it wasn’t for the fact that the Omega knew it to be genuine.
“I don’t mind you asking question so long as they’re not stupid.”
It emphasised, underlined and highlighted those feelings in the glow that they weren’t unrequited. That John did indeed feel about Sherlock the way he’d refused to admit to himself he’d felt about the doctor, and he had not changed his mind in all that they’d been through.
The portion of handwritten text on the bottom of the paper, itself another margin, really, the paper that filled with info, was in the same hand, even if it was somewhat more tidily penned. This time, however, the text was in English and was a later addition, given the freshness of the ink and the change in colour between the two.
The consulting detective could deduce quite a lot of the reason as to why that was. Even though he wasn’t exactly the social butterfly himself, which suited him just fine, it didn’t feel right for John not to have people around him, somehow. But no, that wasn’t quite right, either, was it?
Sherlock scoffed at the suggestion that he would
He attached the knife to his belt while Sherlock left, to return holding John’s new jacket, which he then helped him put on by holding it out for him. He didn’t attempt to zip it up or close the buttons, though, but he did tug at it once it was closed, to ensure that it would indeed conceal the blade.
No, but somehow, the thought of Sherlock being a vampire seemed more logical than him being a bloody dragon. It would fit with the general aesthetic of his appearance, that was for sure, what with the lean body and the pale skin and the alluring eyes and –
“Not through the normal channels, is what he means,” Sherlock translated.
The rest of him was…a mess, really. He told himself he’d known about it and shouldn’t be surprised or hurt, another part was hurt and sought for some meaning, and a third just wanted to push the whole thing away.
“If we need to spend time dealing with every single issue I have, whether large or small – and jealousy isn’t one of them, at any rate – then we are going to be here until you have grown a beard you can hide a hand in.”
After he had come of age, in dragon terms, and had been forced to deal, in some form or another, with all the more negative or complex, complicated aspects of the dragon, something which had rather overlapped with the more emotional and mental parts. The physical, too, but only as it related to –
It wasn’t a given that John would’ve stayed. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Still, he was fidgety. Nervous, honestly, but fidgety was part of that. He had thought John would’ve made it to that point…twenty minutes ago, according to the time, at the very latest and yet, he had not had a single text from the person. She wouldn’t forget.
“John?”
Sherlock looked at him. “You’re not.”
once in a while.”
John has his first brush with the outside world all on his own. It's a...new experience, to say the least.
He had to believe that in such a situation, John would be fine on his own. Not only was he a former soldier, he’d done so before, after all, without Sherlock there. He had to believe it, and he did.
“No, you’re not.”
This wasn’t about him, was it? It had stopped being purely – well, it never really had been purely about him, had it? But it had ceased being primarily about him the moment he’d become pregnant. Even if that didn’t count, as he hadn’t known and there was the risk that he’d lose them, it was certainly the case now.
“Don’t be stupid and evasive,” Sherlock said, with the thinnest thread of a snap to his voice, which nevertheless cracked like a whip. “You know perfectly well what I mean. Obviously, otherwise you wouldn’t try to deflect. Piteous attempt, admittedly, but still. You attempted it, even knowing that I would see through it. So…why do you not want to admit that you are influenced by him, too?”
“Oh yes. I’ll be moving onto the advanced class soon, I’m pretty sure. He’s ever so proud. Now, what do you
“Again, ta, I’d gathered that. It’s not enough to hit it in the voolnerables, either, probably, though I should’ve given that more of a try when he was right up close.”
Why did
“Am I doing the right thing?” he wondered out loud.
Sherlock just shook his head.
“Sherlock – “John said, something pleading in his voice.
“We will be monitoring you throughout, more frequently than we would with what is erroneously termed a ‘regular’ pregnancy. Normally, that would be because of your age and the fact that this is your first pregnancy by this Alpha. In addition, in this case, there are the circumstances of your bond, both the scent bond and more run-of-the-mill one, all of which are potential risk factors that we have to take into account.”
“Right. Yeah. Good. And I’ve been part of that. Almost all of that, too.”
He trailed off but then again, he didn’t really need to elaborate further.
Mycroft glanced up briefly as his office door opened without prior indicator such as a knock or a polite throat clearing. He looked back down at the paperwork he was pouring over almost immediately, recognising the shape of Anthea.
If he was to get at the wounds, however, he needed him back on his front and, preferably, up closer to him, too, so that he could reach the entirety of his back and the corresponding holes and also, get him in a position where, if he was more conscious than before, he wouldn’t flinch away from the ‘medicine’ being administered.
fully there earlier, were you? Figured not, the way you kissed me.”
“Much closer but still, no. It’s…complicated.” And given the situation, not relevant at this point, even if it would be possible to attribute such a simple explanation to Moriarty’s behaviour.
That second half of the thought lasted until John reached a hand behind him, more or less blindly, but still managed to just about reach the closest broad, bony hand, which closed the gap immediately and held on tight.
It had to be for something else, though. Or Sherlock was, in his unusual amount of nervousness and uncertainty, reading too much into it. For all he knew, John could be secretive and pleased with the Christmas present he’d found for Sherlock.
Of course, the most potent of John’s angers wasn’t when he spluttered and rumbled or even roared like a volcano but when he went entirely calm and just a little bit cold or at least, coolly pleasant.
“John?” he asked, trying not to think about the distance between them.
Not so much in case they were to come after them – if they did, he knew it would be Mycroft’s pleasure to deal with them as…creatively as possible, and that was without being told just what exactly they had done to her – but to explain and help John and his guilt after this was all over.
Yes, he realised with surprising speed and certainty. All that was flashing across his mind was of a clarity and a detail that he wouldn’t have bothered with had he made it up in his conscious mind and with a lack of odd, irrelevant tangents and additions that his sleeping mind could conjure.
. “And for the young man here, perhaps a – yes, a caramel cortado with almond milk, medio, and a triple chocolate muffin. Make that two, seeing as he’s so skinny and all.”
She still had a lot of growing to do, after all. Things would almost certainly change over time, to a greater or lesser extent.
Right. So, the danger of that is non-existent. That’s a good start, since I really don’t believe that’s the end of it. What significance does it have in relation to the whole mating thing? One ejaculation and then that’s it?”
He knew that, he just didn’t know how to do it. Not quite.
John felt his own heart do an odd flip and thud inside his chest at the same time.
Given all of that, how could he be blamed for thinking that?
He had nothing really to base it on, but it felt to Sherlock as if, though he was no longer looking into the blue eyes, that warmth was directed at him rather than the audience, and his chest felt correspondingly warm.
The only sense in which the plan came first was that he’d designed it so that John would be as…amenable to what he had set up, what he was planning to do up here when the doctor finally got here.
The other two seemed rather random and irrelevant but they undoubtedly had a point, somewhere down the line, so John left it for the moment.
It could therefore be that what Mycroft had seen as a claim that wasn’t a possession marker had to do with friendship rather than romance. That Sherlock’s brain, massive though it was, had somehow conflated the seemingly confusing feelings associated with being someone’s friend, being liked for who they were rather than what they could do, with romantic feelings and the instinctual behaviour associated with courtship had kicked in on their own.
However, he would honestly and quite happily take the slightly wary, somewhat suspicious but evidently anticipatory and the tiniest bit, though that might be Sherlock overreaching or otherwise seeing and interpreting things that weren’t there, of hope that he could see on John’s face.
Not that he had been the one to do the dirty work, of course, but the point still stood.
They lead the way, which wasn’t even a jump and a skip. Once there, the staff member leaned over and plucked an item before they turned back to him.
That puzzled John somewhat. Why would he be hesitant about that, of all things, and why now? He hadn’t been shy about being close at other times, quite the opposite. Was there something about Ruby that repulsed him so much?
Something else struck him again. John always called her ‘my daughter’. There was no questioning the love he felt for her, you could hear it in his voice and see it in his face, his entire demeanour, and yet…people named their pets, their cars, things they saw in the sky, but he hadn’t named his only child.
“No, you just forgot what game we were playing.”
“No, idiot,” he said, and there was a strong note of fondness in there. “I meant that the reason we’d sleep in the same bed tonight wouldn’t be entirely the same reason we will later. Both in the literal sense and the more metaphorical one. Only if you’re comfortable with the latter, of course.”
I...I don't even know what to say except a humble but heartfelt thank you for all the stupendous, utterly heartwarming comments I got on the last chapter. I think I cried once or twice. You're the best audience I could ask for. :3
In fact, Sherlock had gotten the distinct to the point of a two-by-four impression, from those stories, the lack of other mentions and the complete lack of attempts to contact anybody once he got out of the harem, that John had no wish to have contact with anybody he’d known before.
For a moment, the dragon seemed startled; the eye drew back a little as it widened, and the reptilian lids, for lack of a better word, closed over it several times in rapid succession. Then it was gone, as quickly as a lightning you only halfway registered, and the eye shifted back into its previous position. However, it kept on being wider, the pupil thin.
An escapee from a harem, a scent bonded Omega pregnant with twins, who was trying to locate his more or less abducted – what else would you call it? Kidnapped? – child and trying to avoid a criminal madman of an Alpha who was interested in him, god only knew why, and this,
He wished he could hear them in there or perhaps at least clearly scent them, but the ultrasound image was sadly all he had to help him visualise the pair of them.
Therefore, finding himself in what could politely be called an upmarket store was not his idea of a good time and he didn’t exactly feel comfortable being in, though he’d have to admit that there was something incredibly endearing about Sherlock’s determination and focus as he moved around the store, the knowledge that it was to help John.
When the face came into view, however, his heart sank again, however; the eyes were open and clear and staring right at him. That did not comfort him in the slightest. In fact, it sent a spike of dread through his heart, and there was one specific reason for that.
Thankfully, John just smiled softly. “Well, given everything, it’s not an unfair question, is it?”
“Why?” he repeated, voice remaining gentle but now with an added minute crack in it. “Of course, you, of all people would – Why do people usually kiss someone, Sherlock?”
He didn’t say anything out loud, though. Instead, he chose to lift the hand that he hadn’t let go of up so that the other could see it.
“It’s okay. You evidently meant no harm,” Sherlock argued, his own hands coming to rest on top of those of the blond. He meant it, too.
“No, Mycroft said as much, though honestly it makes a lot of sense on its…Anyway, he said that even trying to jolt your memory about dragon courting and how their courting claims worked before he left hadn’t seemed to make any difference at all. Which was part of the reason he’s uncertain whether it’ll work this time, either.”
“About what, exactly?”
Sorry, that ought to have come through in the story, oughtn't it?
“Can’t he just have failed to say anything to me?”
Yes, of course he should, which was why he had been just about to do so. It was merely that he needed to –
“Yes?”
It was John’s turn to feel as though the air had been stolen from his lungs and left him light-headed and snapping for breath a little.
“I do,” Sherlock said when it seemed he’d gotten his brain and his mouth to cooperate again. There was nothing hesitant about the words, though. Quite the opposite.
he cleaned it and had never gotten to the cleaning, his prodding and poking, however careful it had been, couldn’t have helped, and he couldn’t help but feel a little guilty at that.
The words came from both Sherlock and John, at almost the same time. They also wore almost identical nonplussed expressions as they looked at the older brother.
Sherlock’s minute flinch at that wasn’t feigned, whether the doctor believed it or not. There wasn’t much doubt that he saw it.
John looked at him for a moment longer, brow knitted. Then he sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face, weary.
“Oh, yes. Like with any territorial animal, a dragon will make sure to let others know that a certain item,”
Then it would happen, whether John speculated on it or not, and so he should get on with it rather than going around it again and again like a cat circling something unknown and potentially dangerous. It wasn’t going to help anyone, least of all himself or the man beside him.
She was only four, when all was said and done, and there was a lot of things that could still change about her.
He looked…not exactly nervous but tense, perhaps? As though this was where the venture truly began and unlike his cases, there was no real sense of adventure to it, no excitement. No thrill, just the gravitas of what they were doing.
Of course, that rock might need to become a mountain but that was fine, too. Whichever was needed, Sherlock would do his best to try and provide.
“You won’t lose control. I know it and so do you. You’re in control. Of the dragon and your body. I understand fears can linger; I really do. But…trust me?”
“I don’t…I can’t…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Or perhaps he just needed the moment to cope, which was entirely fair and even if it wasn’t, it was understandable.
“Really.” As though he was going to explain the actual reason to him. Yeah, that’d go down brilliantly, wouldn’t it?
Except…people did, and often, without a second thought, in many cases, or even remorse in a lot of them, either. To the point where it was walking on glass rather than walking on eggshells.
, as well. Tying it to the foundation itself.
And he did.
“From what I’ve heard, he’s no pushover at all. You should’ve heard the bollocking he gave some guys when he came to present the idea of this whole thing.”
I don’t love you only if you do things right,” he said softly. “I don’t and will never love you only with caveats, okay? I. Love. You.”
Sherlock would have to admit it, he was impressed.
What then? How did he solve it? He could let go of it, yes, obviously. The less obvious point was how he did that. It didn’t help to think that he had nothing to fear from John, now or ever, in relation to himself or to the dragon. He knew that and yet…
“John, this is important.”
As those thoughts and deductions raced through his mind, his instincts chimed in with their own points, which didn’t take much, if any of what he deduced into account, running almost purely on the initial emotional response.
That was about to change.
There was silence for long enough that John thought Mycroft wasn’t going to answer. But he did.
Why? Why not just take what it wanted, if it was so sure of itself? Even if it weren’t, why bother wasting time with this? Why wasn’t there more of it projected if it wanted to intimidate him into submission? Into servitude.
The staff was wonderful, he had to admit. Kind and helpful, without being overly pushy or sickly sweet about it.
in his.
Another comment from Mycroft floated into his mind.
“Playing you because of the difference in intelligence?” He got another grimace from John at the comment but also a nod. “No. That is, they will, but that’s because they’re dragons, not because they’re more intelligent than your average person.”
The thought could’ve come back to him at just about any other moment and it would’ve been a better time.
After another moment to pull himself together, John continued, “You’ve got the region right. We stayed in Nantes when…when she was born. When she was conceived, too. I…I can’t remember…but yeah, the time fits, too. What else does the paper say?”
He’d been the one who’d kidnapped John in the first place, the one who’d made a show of wanting to claim the doctor, whether that was genuinely the case or merely because it wound Sherlock up – which had worked, too – and had further worsened the situation by both pushing the two residents of 221B into their dilemma with the snipers and the subsequent issue with the wounds.
Irrelevant. Utterly and thoroughly irrelevant, now or ever. This was an arranged – and while that was more relevant, it was something to steer away from even faster than the first thought, going dangerously fast just to get away from it. To be sure, because…
“Isn’t there.”
That just didn’t make any sense. Why would John apologise? He had nothing to apologise for, not really.
Sherlock stared at him, thrown.
It wasn’t that they’d had an argument, or he was starting to resent his Alpha or didn’t want him there at all. Of course not. He enjoyed spending time with Sherlock, both when his mind was rapidly firing on all cylinders and when they could have some quiet moments just talking or even being quiet.
Whatever it was, it was said again and again, coming closer as it was repeated, until his arm was grabbed, and he was turned around, not forcefully so but certainly with the same appealing insistence as had been in the Alpha’s voice.
Never mind the teensy, tiny fact that losing himself had almost resulted in him losing John as well. He felt his heart clench.
It likely also made a difference that he had an understanding of gold’s properties and to see it not even melt, which might be a stretch but still at least tenuously feasible given the oddly intense heat he knew came off the wounds, but disintegrate first and rather fast into grains as though the term ‘gold salts’ was more than a misnomer. Then, gradually though not especially slowly, those grains did dissolve into the wounds, disappearing completely.
(See the end of the chapter for
A sigh, one that was slightly pained and a good deal more resigned. “He’s probably, no, undoubtedly going to bring it up even if I don’t when we find him. Not that there’s much, if anything, important about what I do remember.”
John woke with a start. Sherlock saw because he was watching him from his spot over by the window. Not that he’d watched him for a long time while he slept or anything. That would be…even Sherlock knew that wasn’t a good thing to do.
"I can’t know how I would interpret it if you don’t tell me,” he said, as gently as possible as he placed his cheek on top of the other’s head. “That said, I will neither demand nor even ask that you tell me. You know I trust you.”
After all, to be fair to him, he was the one who’d set all of this in proper motion. Yes, Sherlock and John had done a lot, as much as they could, in fact. But in terms of getting things done, wrangling the legal issues and such, it had been Mycroft who’d pulled the bulk of the weight, and that wasn’t even mentioning the speed.
He took a brief breath before ploughing on. ”The experience has altered you sufficiently that you cannot step back into your old life, the known world you chose to turn your back on – “ and John couldn’t help the tiny wince at that, even though he knew that there was no judgement there and no reason to react to what he’d done in vastly different circumstances with very limited options, especially as it couldn’t change them – “for reasons that I don’t know but don’t doubt their legitimacy whatsoever. You have lived isolated from the world, mostly, only seen the dregs of society, and not the interesting dregs, and now you have returned, without even the tiniest of tethers to what you had, deliberately so.
“They’re not coming here.” Though he knew it was stupid, because they would be far better qualified to help Sherlock than John could hope to, there was something inside of him that rebelled at the thought of having strangers poking and prodding at Sherlock in this state.
Not that Sherlock was going to care, not about his public image. At least, John reckoned he wouldn’t. But it could still reflect badly on him and if the public cared about that, he might find himself with far less, if any, cases to work.
