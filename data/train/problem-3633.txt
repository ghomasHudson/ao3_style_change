"Having gotten to know you, there is no way you betrayed the crown… I can't imagine it at all. You are so eager to do good and to serve," Dean started. "Of course, I don't know you well, but…" He left the sentence hanging open, an invitation for Castiel to start talking.
“I can sense your discomfort, but you are not in danger,” Cas informed him. This didn’t actually put Dean at ease, not yet. He wasn’t the kind of dick who thought every supernatural creature was bad (take Garth for example) but it didn’t hurt to be careful. “Jack is a Nephilim.”
"Well, then there's suggestion number three. My final suggestion," he said and he looked at them both. "My preferred one as well."
“Uh… okay, a ghost,” Dean said and stopped looking through the list of available hunters.
"Dean! It's so good to see you," Cas said.
"I think it won't be the biggest change for them. They were used to angelic protection, provided by the Morningstar garrison. Now it will be one of Cas' flights. The good thing about it is of course that Cas' flights are allied with Winchester," Dean explained.
Last of all he read Anna's letter, who informed him that she had received his information regarding Lucifer's army and that she'd forwarded his suspicions and his current activities to Michael. As expected, Anna had been reserved about it but helpful anyway. She didn't have to help him just because she was his sister. She was still his superior after all and nobody would have faulted her for denying him and possibly even disciplining him.
"What do you want," he asked flatly, clearly still tense. Of course, if someone broke into Dean's house he wouldn't be perfectly hospitable either.
"Not necessarily, but it's also not unheard of," Castiel answered. The angel attached the basket to Cas' saddle, but she opened it and took out a bundle.
"And you won't need to spend much time on Castiel either, don't worry. Consider him a roommate with benefits." Dean didn't think it wise to say that he really didn't want to have a roommate, but then the implications of what Zachariah said hit him. "A hard-working alpha like you needs to blow off steam from time to time, it's natural. Castiel will provide that service for you, in exchange to being able to live and work here."
But Dean needed to know more. So maybe another trip to the library was in order. He capped his pen, then put the letter away in his drawer, locking it.
"You were looking for something to pressure him with," Benny guessed, his voice free of judgement. "Did Gabriel get wind of it or what?"
"Son," John started, "you are facing a difficult situation. I know you will be able to handle it even though I wish you wouldn't have to."
"Is the kid ready?" Dean asked when he deemed Cas satisfactorily kissed, nodding his head towards the closed door to Jack's room.
A call of a night bird echoed loud and clear in the winter night. Another call followed and then the world fell back into the gentle silence of night. Dean put his gloved hands on the stonewall, leaning against it a bit more heavily, drinking in the sight. He heard the wooden door creak, followed by the light footfall of leather boots on the weathered stone. Dean slowly turned to look over his shoulder, seeing Lady Toni Bevell walking up to him, already – or still – decked out in a light leather armor, a heavy fur coat draped across her shoulders against the chill of the night. He acknowledged her with a nod that she returned in kind. Then she walked up to join him on the wall looking towards the border they shared with the land of angels.
"What I mean to say is that every angel is different in this aspect and you did get damn lucky that you were at Cas' mercy," he told him.
he typed out and then he reached out to take a picture of the dick.
"What…?"
“I… just to be by your side, to have you love me in return,” Cas told him, swallowing against the lump in his throat. “Maybe… go on a date? That’s what humans do, right?”
"I'm… glad that you're alright, but I'm still worried," Charlie said, "what if he changes his mind about enforcing the consummation?"
"Can't you figure that out? You're in the army after all!" Dean pressed him.
"Well, my plan to push him backfired two days ago," he said and Charlie nodded pensively. "But I guess I have to push some more. Maybe actually put pressure on him…"
"Is it normal for the FBI to look for a supernatural angle if you're out of clues?" Cas teased which had Dean shrug. "Do you believe in magic, Dean?"
"Yeah, Cas. That sounds great!" the man answered, then he spotted the newspaper lying next to Gabriel's elbow. "Hey man, you still using that?" Gabriel narrowed his eyes, but then his face pulled into a smile and he handed the newspaper over.
Their position allowed Dean to lean into Cas' space, feel Cas' breath on his lips when he leant forwards again, one hand reaching up to cup Dean's face to draw him into a kiss. Dean went easily enough, kissing Cas while he moved his slick palm over them both. He started moving his hips too, pushing into the tight channel of his fist and against Cas' dick. He groaned in pleasure as Cas put his hand on his neck, pulling him closer. What little movement Cas made felt a bit unsure to Dean, but it was clear that he was trying this out, even if only tentatively. It was still a lot better than Cas' initial plan. And it was a lot better than Dean feared when he decided to do it.
"While I couldn't get a hold of Sanders, I did manage to get into some of his files from the old owner. The dude was getting older and after an accident, he felt like it was time to retire. He wanted to pass the business on to his sons, but neither was interested in keeping it, having both had success elsewhere. It was Raphael Finnerman who introduced him to Sanders," Dean explained, reading off his notes, so he didn't see the frown on Castiel's face. It might have been Raphael who made the initial deal and clearly wasn't as good at cleaning up after himself than he should have been. "And now that Sanders is gone the contract states that ownership of the orchard will go to the city itself." Dean took a sip of coffee.
Cheese.
"How do you know?" Dean wondered and the god tapped his chest.
When Gabriel strolled into the café just after Cas had pulled a pie out of the oven, he waved the same morning paper in front of him with a bright, proud smile almost splitting his face.
"I don't want to like write you house rules or something," Dean said when they both sat in the kitchen with bowls of pasta.
"He wasn't evil," Dean muttered.
“You’re impatient all of a sudden,” Dean commented, but proceeded to pull the fabric down, kissing and gently biting along Castiel’s chest and down his abdomen. He could feel vibrations underneath his lips that weren’t caused by Castiel’s breathing. There were things inside this being, bigger things than Dean could comprehend, so he focused on the little moan that escaped Castiel when Dean kissed him through the fabric of his underwear.
"What are you doing…?"
"Gabriel! Please help me!" By this time Sam had stumbled closer, kneeling down at Dean's feet. He studied his brother, then he looked at the crow.
"If the High Council still holds on to their old decision, then there's no way anything about Ketch's information is true. Why would angels be mobilizing to attack? Why now?" Dean wondered.
"Ah. Humans, they're so intriguing, aren't they? Weird little creatures!" he said, shaking his head and holding out his empty wine glass for a servant to refill. He took a sip and then grinned at Cas over the top of the rim. "But you have claimed one for yourself, Castiel. I'm sure you've already learnt of all the joys that they can bring." Even though this was meant as an attack on Dean, he was more disturbed by the implication of Lucifer's words. Dean hoped no human had been misfortunate enough to be used to sate Lucifer's curiosity. But then again, the dude was old as dirt (probably), which was a lot of time to do questionable things…
"May I?" Cas asked and the mother removed the child from its blankets. Dean watched Cas put his hand on the baby's forehead. He closed his eyes, as did the parents. There was a little light glowing on the baby's shoulder and then a protective rune was there, no bigger than a mole.
"Uh…"
"Yes? With Jack it was intense. It certainly made me think twice about having more children for a good couple of years," Cas said with a chuckle.
"Are you drunk?" he asked, the previous concern mostly washed away. Dean frowned, wondering if getting drunk was a common enough occurrence for this version of himself, just like getting hurt might be. He imagined himself a rugged king in disguise, with a sword under his big fur coat that gleamed when the moonlight hit it. He'd look awesome. Maybe he was thinking about this too much. Cas grabbed his arm, giving him a light shake before he rubbed the polyester of his suit between his fingers. "Aren't you supposed to be at a summit in Greece?" Cas asked. Greece…? "Why are you back so early? Did you get tossed out?" Dean had no idea if that was something that happened to this version of himself, but he decided to take offense on principle alone.
Fuck it, he'd done enough stupid things to land him here, why stop now?
Followed by an angry faced emoji. Dean rolled his eyes but looked up from the phone when he heard Sam clear his throat. Sam had both of his eyebrows lifted and Dean looked from his brother to Mary.
"I get it. Claire and I talked a lot about it," Jack said. "I can't really make that go away… But I can tell you that you don't need to worry about me. I will be fine. And you will be too."
"Took you long enough to get here!" she said cheerfully. Cas knew there was absolutely no point in arguing with her (though Cas was pretty sure she was skipping classes to be here and if he should rat her out to Jimmy. He didn’t want to lose the spot of favorite uncle to Amelia’s brother though, so maybe not.).
"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Family trip to the beach," Dean said with a laugh. Charlie said her good-byes and wished them well on their journey. Then they were on their way.
"Cultivate the bond? Is that what we're calling it now?" Benny wondered with a chuckle and Charlie grinned at him. Dean rolled his eyes. "But you are all over Cas now."
So he had taken his well-earned holidays and was, to be honest, utterly bored out of his skull. He didn't know why; he had neglected hobbies, TV shows and books in his rush to get that next promotion. There should be plenty for him to do!
"You really were a dick," Castiel muttered, but a small smile pulled at his lips. He closed his eyes and shook his head, then he looked up at Dean. "It's been difficult trying to redeem myself for…" Castiel lifted his arms and then let them drop back to his sides. "Everything. And I thought I had a shot, a
"He's nice. Cute kid too," John said, when Cas finally convinced a yawning Jack that it was time to sleep. Dean had shown him Sam's old room earlier, so Cas took the kid up himself, leaving Dean with his parents.
No, Dean had no love for Raurica. But there also was no itch to jump into Baby and get away. Because Raurica had Cas. Dean knew that he got sappy if he had a crush and he was man enough now to admit that he craved the comfort of loving someone and being loved in return. But there was that uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. This was still a case, there was still probably a witch on the loose and he was still lying to Cas.
"I've been told that I'm to perform certain duties as thanks for you agreeing to the transfer," Novak said and Dean couldn't read his voice or expression to figure out what he was thinking about it. "My colleague suggested that this meant I would be performing sexual favors for you. Since you asked for a schedule of my heat cycle I assumed he was right." Now Dean couldn't help letting his cool façade drop.
"I'm a god, I know a thing or two about blood pacts," he said and then stepped closer to the table again, where Cas was still sitting up, incredibly tense. It only took one silent look from the god for Cas to lie back down without complaint. Dean felt an irritating spark of jealousy.
"And why are you coming to bed already?" Cas asked. "I'm working, in case you hoped for sex."
"I prefer things to be simple," he said, "is there anything you'd like to order, sir?" The cocky smirk faded slightly and he turned his attention back to the menu, eyes flicking through it, before he put it down, hands linked over it. He grinned back up at Cas.
"Are… Is it you, Sam?" he asked. That question took the other man by surprise.
"What the hell do you mean?" Dean barked and tensed the moment the god pulled a dagger seemingly out of nowhere. Its dark metal looked like it had been recently pulled out of fire, but Dean didn't doubt that it was sharp. There was no time to think this through so he pulled out his gun and pointed it at the god's head. "Put that down!"
"Okay, babe. I'm on my way," Dean said and then he hung up. Castiel let the phone clatter to the counter and hung his head. He couldn't do this. He couldn't let Dean investigate and put himself into danger. If the love spell wasn't strong enough to compel him to forget all about the case, then… Castiel wasn't sure. He wanted to tell Dean the truth, but he couldn't put the coven in danger, least of all Dean if he got it into his mind to fight an entire coven of powerful witches single-handedly. No, that would end in nothing but pain. But what could he do…? If he didn't act now, then Raphael would-
“What deal?” Instead of answering the Shadow lifted his hand, waving and then the ground broke away from underneath Cas, plunging him into nothingness.
"Of course. Now get back to your husband," she said. Castiel nodded, closing the door to the carriage and waving as she drove away.
"What the hell?!" Cas put his hand on Dean's lower arm, making sure he didn't bolt. When Dean chanced a look at Naomi she was actually looking amused.
"I'll just get Hephaistos to make another one for me," the god said with a carefree shrug.
Castiel pulled open the door to the spiral staircase and hurried down, startling Sam who was used to Castiel's usual unhurried movement about the house.
"I…" Cas stammered, but he didn't know how to continue, trying to process his emotions. And apparently he wasn't able to pull himself together fast enough, because Dean's expression became pinched. He looked kind of in pain before his face darkened.
"Why should there be blood?" he asked and Dean seemed uncomfortable at that. "And why would anyone be invested in virginity? Besides, everybody knows I am inexperienced in sexual matters. It's a popular gossip topic in my garrison." Dean lifted his eyebrows at that, but still made no move to get any closer or to relax his posture. Castiel sighed deeply, pinching the bridge of his nose. If only he could make Dean understand. Maybe he'd just have to try. He sat up straight and looked at Dean. "Sex is the easiest way to initialize a bond, especially in arranged marriages. Angels are social beings and we profit greatly from bonding. " Cas could tell that Dean didn't quite follow, but at least he was listening.
"Uh-huh," was all Dean said, walking over to the drawers containing the catalogue. "I thought you had gone back to the capital?" He did remember Cas saying something about it during one of their breakfast meetings.
"Oh wow. He's hot in speedos and he's hot in a suit. Quite a catch," she said, then grinned at Cas. "Well done."
"I try not to," Castiel said dryly, but a smile was tugging at the corner of his lips. Dean snorted, but then he put his hand on Cas' cheek. For a long moment they stared at each other, waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.
Dean typed back.
"It was an impossible challenge. To choose between kingdom or a child," Dean started, turning his body back to the front, unable to meet Castiel's eyes or have him see the flicker of doubt cross his face. "Most queens would make the tough choice."
Castiel trailed after Mary, very aware of the weight of Jack in his little basket as well as Mary constantly darting him looks, like she wanted to say something but wasn't quite ready yet.
"Oh… Oh yes," he said and stepped aside, so one of the girls behind the table could give Emma a cookie. "Mm! It's good!" Emma said, chewing happily. Castiel only made an absent-minded noise, trying to let his eyes sweep over the mass of people without being too obvious about it. Who could be Emma's dad? He had no idea what Dean looked like.
"Cas can get pregnant," Dean said, deciding to gloss over the fact that he didn't know if Cas wanted to get pregnant. Both of his parents eyed him dubiously. "I don't know how exactly, but he can. Angelic biology is different. I promise." John and Mary looked at each other, both of them pensive. "Please?" John downed the rest of his wine in some big gulps.
"If it's demonic we'll be having the scholars put up sigils right away," the commander said and with a nod of Dean's head the commander was gone, shouting orders.
Dean was taken aback by that.
He studied it for a while longer, hearing the kids chat outside, but then he took a determined, fortifying breath and put it on.
"Morning," Dean said, then he went to the buffet table and grabbed himself some things. "Coffee?"
"So everything's alright?" Sam wondered and Dean didn't know how to answer. He was still pretty shaken up about Cas' temporary death, but apart from that? Yeah. He guessed so.
"Sennentuntschi!" Castiel called, lifting one of his hands, almost as if he was planning to blast the whole cabin away. "
"Well… You did. That diner was disgusting. I don't know what that molten cheese smell was but it was everywhere," Sam said. Dean rolled his eyes. "You mean he thought it was your scent?"
“Because I had it under control,” Jack muttered to himself.
"Yeah, I get it. Luckily, you'll be hanging out at the beach in your cute sunflower bikini, sipping drinks and turning hot alphas' heads in less than two weeks!" she said, winking at Cas.
Castiel pulled out his angel blade but he hesitated.
"I do want to make you happy though, Cas," Dean said and he knew he sounded kind of whiney.
"Do you… if you have to leave to help him, you can," Castiel told him gently. Dean smiled at him.
"It's peculiar to see you so talk active," Sam said with a laugh, "usually you only babble like that when you're very excited."
"There was no tough choice," Castiel retorted. "To abandon Sam like that… Giving him up to a witch she had banished to an unhospitable place of shadows, hoping that he would just disappear?"
"Is it not improper to draw attention to the fact that there was such a delay to the consummation?" Dean argued. Naomi turned her head to him, considering his argument, but eventually, she waved her hand.
"Only the brave ones," Cas told him and Dean ducked his head, but the smile was there. Dean was adorable when he was embarrassed. "Be careful and I hope you'll be back for some dessert later."
Even though he hadn't really expected anything else from his family, Dean was relieved to get such positive reactions and before he answered he pulled up the chat with Cas.
Apparently, this was the moment, both of them wrapped together, Dean cursing under his breath, that Sam couldn't take it anymore. He started laughing.
"I'll do what I can to fix it," Cas told him and Dean knew he meant it. It just made him feel useless to know that there was nothing that he could contribute. He was just a human and this was much bigger than him. All that he could do, now, was to wrap his arms around Cas and soak up the comfort.
"Okay, boss," he muttered to himself and then he closed his eyes.
"And there was chaos. Suddenly we had clashed with angels, we had lost our crown prince, and on top of that we could no longer rely on the centuries long alliance between Winchester and the Houses of Kendrick," John said. "If it did accomplish one thing, it was exposing the short-comings of Winchester. We couldn't even get a simple message through to our territories, we couldn't get answers from allies. It was a difficult time and we surely wouldn't have been ready for a demonic invasion."
It was too late now, too late for him and Dean. But he had made his choice. For the first time in his life he walked away from Naomi's house and he was free.
"Guinea pig…?" he muttered, trying to figure out if he had to put the picture on its head to find any resemblance with the animal.
"Novak," Dean muttered to himself. He was pretty sure that this was the last name of the witch. Pensive, Dean put it back down and looked around some more. There were some pictures hung on the wall, mostly it looked like kid's drawings. The place was old-fashioned, so Dean wasn't surprised to find no photography anywhere, least of all electric light. But there was a painting hung next to Sam's bed. It showed Castiel looking solemn, holding a young child. Even though it was almost 18 years ago, Dean remembered how Sam looked. He traced the little oil painted face with his fingers, almost reverently.
"We were nothing to them, Dean! You must have seen and felt that on the battlefield! And still they didn't wipe us out! You came back, most of your army came back! Castiel asked for nothing but you to become his prisoner in return." Dean opened his mouth but Bobby held up his hand, not having it. "And I know this sucks for you! But you've got to endure it, just for now. Until we've found a solution. Please!" Dean grit his teeth, staring at Bobby, but eventually he nodded. "Good. Get out, blow off steam a bit. You're no use to anybody if you're panicking," he said. Again, Dean nodded, then he turned around, briskly leaving Bobby's study.
"I'll fetch the scissors and have some things delivered to you. You'll figure out the rest, yes?" She asked, not leaving Castiel any chance to get a word in.
"I need to know more about this Grace issue," Dean said. Naomi sniffed and lifted her head up, regarding Dean coolly. "If I want to go back to my own country, I need Castiel at his best. And I don't think he is."
"Cool car," a girl's voice said and Dean looked up to find the source. A young woman with blond, wavy hair was sitting on a wicker chair on the porch, phone in her hands. She lifted one hand, all cool and casual, almost bored. "Hey. I'm Claire." Ah, so this was the mastermind behind the matchmaking.
The cheerful sounds of the phone’s ringtone pierced through the cacophony, drowning it out at once. The Shadow cocked its head but Cas had no time to pay it any attention. He grabbed his phone, saw Dean’s caller ID flash up on screen and picked up right away.
It seemed that while the other guy was the one with the big mouth, clearly Castiel was the one calling the shots between the two of them. Other than the loud guy, Castiel remained calm when he talked, his voice deep and smooth:
Cas was shaky when they met Mary, having eventually succumbed to the urge to puke out of sheer anxiety. Dean however had fared better, but he looked like he had seen hell, again. Mary for her part was looking from one to the other, bewildered.
It was time to check the egg's temperature.
"It's sweet that you came to help him move," Amelia said. "Because we're just here to take a peek at you." Dean laughed.
"Yeah, I get it, but I don't have to be happy about it," Dean grumbled.
"Why should I believe any of this?" he asked and Gabriel shrugged.
"What is it?" Sam wondered.
When he had sent replies to some people, he scrolled through some accounts that had been suggested to him according to his settings.
"Yes… He is disappointed because you know how he idolized Luke, but I think hanging out with Claire as much as he did really helped him put things into perspective. He can still love his father and also understand that the way Luke treated me wasn't right and that we would all be happier if we weren't living together anymore."
When Dean and him arrived at the Winchester's house, the afternoon was surprisingly cheerful. The sun was shining, warming Cas' face as he got out of the car. It smelled like autumn here, with the tree in front of Dean's childhood home alight with red and yellow leaves. Dean closed the door of the Impala, stirring Cas out of his thoughts. He watched Dean take their travel bags out of the trunk, shouldering one and holding on to the other, shaking his head with a grin when Cas held out his hand to take one.
“Oh. Well, I got the supplies,” Jack said, changing the topic when Dean wasn’t forthcoming with further information about the hunt. “Except for the beer.” That got Dean’s attention quickly and he opened his mouth to protest. “I didn’t have ID,” Jack informed him.
"Yes, of course," he said and Dean got up again, kissing Cas and hugging him tightly.
Dean greatly enjoyed the walk to Milton Heights and he was curious when he finally saw the high wall with the gate towers ahead of him. Of course, the town gates were wide open now, so that Dean and Cas could just stroll in. Milton Heights pretty much looked like Dean had imagined it. It was a tidy town, with thin but tall buildings flanking the sides of mostly wide, paved roads, with tiny narrow streets branching off of the main one. Dean had seen old towns like this before, both in Winchester and the old continent, but not many houses had survived the centuries like they seemed to here.
I hope to see you return to our family farm soon and await your return.
"The man upstairs wants to transfer one of the employees from the Illinois branch. He's Naomi's project. The name's Castiel Novak, he's part of the PR team and Naomi would like him here, where he can go further than a smaller branch. He'd be a good fit." Zachariah heaved a sigh. "But he's an omega." Dean lifted his eyebrow. There were some omegas employed at Sandover, so it wasn't like they were banned from working here. "This is where you come in, Dean."
"Always happy to be of service," he said cheerfully. Castiel nodded at him, then he fled, heart aching and blinking away tears.
"Oh…? Okay," Dean said, unsure what was to come.
"That's really great, Cas," Amelia said, putting her arm around Jimmy. "Right, Jimmy?"
"I don't have anything, Dean!" Bobby yelled. "This is a wasp's nest that we should not have touched! I've been going over the reports from your battle at Pontiac for a thousand times! Castiel's battle strategy was painfully straight forward, they were outnumbered at the time but still we had nothing we could do. If it weren't for their mercy nobody would have returned from that battle field!"
The effect was immediate; Cas's face went slack with surprise. He quickly schooled his expression but Dean could feel some of the things he felt: surprise was the most of it, but he was also pleased, shy and intrigued all at once. This at least gave Dean enough confidence to go on with it.
"We don't procreate often, even less now than before when we sustained more losses during war. The High Council always suggested keeping a stable population and many angels simply aren't that interested in raising children. It's an investment of many decades. We may be long-lived but we still experience time as you do and having to change diapers for 50 years doesn't sound very enticing to me." Dean grimaced. "And as I said, angelic children seek communion. They imprint heavily on their primary caregiver, so they are usually completely involved in raising their child."
"My Grace is settled, which means I don't tire as easily anymore. The balance we have feels very soothing," he said, turning on his stomach when Dean climbed on the bed next to him. He had his elbow propped up, resting his chin on his palm. "The closer you are, the better I feel. And Jack doesn't seem to be such a difficult infant." Dean laughed at that, lying down. Cas took that chance to scoot closer, molding himself to Dean's side. Dean kissed his head, trailing his fingers over Castiel's arm.
“How are your heats? Any issues there?” Mia wanted to know.
"Who are you kidding. You've been ready to bless your first king for years, haven't you?" Castiel sheepishly admitted to it with a small nod. "Go ahead then."
"I've got the sensation that he wants to be close," Cas said tentatively.
Now, Amara wanted to enjoy some well written fiction for a change, preferably at the pool side. She might be the goddess of all for the time being, but she felt she did deserve a break now.
"Because you didn't put it into the safe," Sam said, his voice flat, the words muttered into his coffee cup.
"Yeah, you do. You're a scary bastard," Gabriel said. Castiel rolled his eyes.
"What about Cas though? Can you go back to the kingdom…?" he wondered and Dean's playful expression dropped.
Castiel was quick to make his way through the battle field towards where Dean Winchester fell, Uriel at his side, his expression passive. He had sent one flight ahead while he waited for Uriel to follow his call to join him in this battle as his second in command. Uriel was happy to join him and was as swift as Castiel had hoped. Still, they only made it to the battle after the humans were well on the way of a quick and bloody defeat even though the battle couldn't have lasted long yet.
"Sam… Take your brother and go back to the castle. Have Dean tell the king and queen that the curse has been lifted by killing the witch who has started it all," he said.
"Michael and I agree that this is a good challenge for Castiel," Naomi said. Castiel balked at the idea of it being his responsibility to get rid of Dean. He had never killed anyone and he didn't want to start now. He didn't want to be responsible for Dean's death. He frantically racked his brain for any ideas for what he could do to rid Dean of the danger he posed to the coven without having to kill him. Incapacitate him so that he cannot continue working? That would remove him but someone else would simply take his place. Take his memory? Take his will? No, he had to be careful, to not do too much. He had to gently redirect his attention to something else and convince him that there was nothing suspicious happening.
“I don’t have a harp. But yes, I do have a halo and I have wings,” Castiel told him patiently and when Jack peeked around the corner of the car he could finally see an awed smile on Eliot’s face.
"No, I'm still an omega, Anna. Sending Luke packing didn't magically make me grow testicles," he said with a chuckle. Somehow this was very funny. "Luke's an assbutt but I got Jack out of it."
"I understand," he said sadly. "Lucifer was right, you will have to make a decision… Winchester might be in danger without you… I assumed that you would revoke our marriage as soon as it was safe to do so and then Jack won't have to be your concern anymore."
"Actually, I'm a bit cold," Cas tried to joke. Dean laughed at him, then he hoisted him up and threw him into the water.
"Once you grow a beard we can talk about that. You're just too young to be convincing, sorry, kid," Dean decided. Neither Sam nor Cas objected to Dean's decision and Jack looked like he was seriously contemplating if scrapping together a bit of Grace to figure out beard growth was a viable option.
"Hello, son," he said and then he also hugged him, patting his back firmly. "It's been far too long."
“Yes, you’re right, buddy,” Dean said and checked the monitor, tracking where the phone call was coming from. Smith Center. Locals were pretty rare.
"Sure thing, Dean!" she said. Having done what he could, Dean went to search Benny. Maybe they could play some cards to pass the time. Without the chance to go out for a ride, or a visit to an inn, or train, he was really starting to get bored.
He put this hand on the door, feeling the hum of the warding. He took a second to breathe in and compose himself, then he hammered his balled fist against the metal. Usually he would just go inside, but they had upped the warding some time ago and Cas needed the door to be opened to him from inside. He hoped that someone was home. He did reach up and try to put his hair into order. There was nothing he could do about his bare feet and the odd outfit, but he had shown himself to Dean in worse conditions and states of undress.
"Haha, very funny," Dean muttered but then their nice coffee break was interrupted by a phone call. "Ah, here we go. Adler's calling."
"Excuse me?" he asked but Luke pushed past him to grab the bikini and the Bellomega shopping bag out of the bathroom. He then tossed them all at Cas, who at least reacted quickly enough to catch the things.
"Gross, Sam!" he shouted and the Dean next to him groaned too.
"But.. but why?" Sam managed to ask, his eyes flitting over Dean. Dean laughed hollowly.
"It's clear that you can't continue making this drive every weekend and while I'd like to say that I'd be up making it every weekend, I know that I'd eventually get tired of it too…" he said and Dean nodded. "I was on the phone with your parents yesterday."
Instead, Castiel snorted and brushed past Dean and his provocation, unlocking his door and slipping inside. He let his eyes drift over his space swiftly, before he turned and opened the door to Dean. Dean grinned and stepped inside. Castiel didn't wait to receive a verdict from Dean, but walked across the room to put the egg down into the nest by the bed. Cas wasn't particularly fond of the place; even though it was bare, it was small enough that the little furniture Cas had made it look cluttered. He had a small kitchen nook, a desk for studying and eating at, a bed next to the window and a small couch. But he also had a bathroom that he didn't have to share, which made this all somewhat acceptable. Acceptable, but not particularly appealing, a sentiment that not only his mother but also Dean seemed to share.
"Hah, I can relate," Mary said, "I can't believe Dean's almost 40. He's still my little baby though. He even lets me cut the crust off his sandwich, indulging my mothering like the good boy he is."
It was no longer his problem.
"Cas-" Uriel started, his tone warning, but Castiel took a firm grip of Dean Winchester's shoulder. He felt his Grace brush against the human's fading form, but then he forced it through, reaching into his soul. Pain burned through Castiel and he closed his eyes against it, steeling himself. He felt a dreadful pull inside of him, the soul desperately reaching out to him, and finally with determination, he let his Grace burst out. He bit down a shocked cry at the pain, instantly feeling it soothed as his Grace flooded the body of Dean Winchester, pulling him back from the brink of death, locking his life inside his healed body. When Castiel removed his hand, the prince was whole and healthy even though he was unconscious.
"And you are aware that you too were attacked?"
it felt to kiss Cas and how much Dean had missed kissing, he pressed against him with more intent. He tilted his head, slotting their lips together more comfortably, moving his mouth to coax Cas to respond. He did grasp the idea quickly enough and they exchanged a number of slow, chaste kisses. It was easy for Dean to lose himself in the familiar movement, letting it soothe his thoughts running wild. Cas jolted when Dean opened his lips enough to swipe his tongue over Cas' upper lip. Dean filed that away for later, slowly pressing more of his weight against Cas, until he got the idea. For a moment he felt Cas' palms brush against him, his knuckles against Dean's stomach, then his palms against his sides, but then Cas' mouth detached from his own and he quickly lay down. Dean had to almost laugh. Cas had his hands firmly at his sides, clenched to fists, his upper body tense, while his legs dangled off the mattress.
"You're tanned!" Jack said after a while, unaware of Cas' silly emotional moment, then he held out his own arm to compare it to Cas'. "I'm as well, a bit! Look!" Castiel laughed and wiped his eyes.
"He told me when he found me…," Castiel said and lowered his head. "But it didn't change anything after all."
"What crawled up your ass?" she asked, closing the book she'd been reading.
"I love you too," Cas told him, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck and looking at him with a fond smile.
"Don't you want to say good bye to Sam too? Just in case?" Dean asked but Cas shook his head.
Clearly, sleeping in the cart wasn't really comfortable. Castiel suppressed a groan when he hopped off of the cart, slowly stretching. They had reached the next big town on the route, the second to last before they reached the coast. The landscape here was already starting to look different, the wind blowing in had a different freshness to it and there were seagulls up in the air, calling out loudly.
"Do you even know anything about Novak?" he eventually asked, when they were sitting on Dean's couch, looking out the big windows showing into the starless November night.
"Is that a yes?" Dean wanted to know.
"Hey Ambriel!" she said and Ambriel sent her a quick smile. "Aren't you coming with us?"
"Sloppy work," Dean grumbled. A hunter's life would be much easier if he could do most of the research directly on his laptop.
Of all the things Dean had expected to hear from him, faithless had certainly not featured.
"Freaking witches," he cursed, but there was a small smile on his lips.
"Dean." Dean turned away, shoulders drawn up, holding on to his emotions. He had been embarrassed enough today. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that."
"I'd like to say no. I still work 5 days a week of course and sometimes I'm away on business trips, but I don't want to bring work back anymore to do once I get home at 10 PM or go to the office on Saturdays and Sundays. It's just…" Dean heaved a sigh. "Yeah. I'd like to just drive to Kansas to my parents or drive to Illinois to see you. Have time for friends and hobbies…" Castiel smiled at Dean, reaching out to put his hand on his. Dean's fidgeting with the beer bottle stopped and he allowed Cas to push his fingers between Dean's to hold his hand.
"Must be rough…," he said, unsure what else to share, then he held out his hand and Castiel's expression softened. He grabbed Dean's hand and gave it a squeeze. "I'm sure it'd be easier if you hadn't met us."
“Right,” Cas answered, his voice flat.
"Get yourself to a doctor before you stress yourself out about it unnecessarily," Jimmy told him. "And there are plenty of options from IVF to adoption. You and Dean will find a way to have kids, don't worry." Castiel breathed in deeply, trying to shake himself out of this unnecessary moment of anxiety. Jimmy was right. There was no point in worrying in advance.
"Oh, I almost forgot! I do have a wedding present for you. It was delivered some time ago," Lucifer called after them and Castiel turned back, his expression suspicious. "Please pick it up before you leave. Long live the King or whatever it is you say among humans." Now they were properly dismissed and led by guards through the garden and back to where the stables were.
"Do you hear that man?", he asked, waving his hand in the direction of the king. "Really, Castiel, are humans mad? Are you sure you want to negotiate with a mad dog?" Dean only noticed now that this Castiel guy had still been looking at Dean while John spoke. Only now he turned his head away slowly, his eyes still tracking Dean for as long as possible, and finally gave the King his full attention.  He quirked his eyebrow at the other angel, darting him a quick look before he studied Dean's parents again. His expression was calm, his face impassive. And it wasn't him who addressed the king next. Bald angel spoke again, his expression now irritated, as he waved his hands at John dismissively again:
There were multiple doors here, but all were open and the rooms behind empty, showing stripped down wooden beds and bare tables. There were pictures hanging on the walls, of angels with ridiculous hairdos and comical expressions. Pretty much at the end of the corridor Dean found a closed door, so he hoped that this was the right place. He didn't wait to knock, simply let himself in. Cas was there, looking up from the desk he was sitting on, a startled look on his face.
"Visitor for you," he said seriously and then he opened the door wider to let Anna in. Dean tensed at seeing her, especially with the kind of face she made. It was like back in Winchester. Dean got up from his chair, wanting to face her properly.
." It was clear to Dean how deeply upset Castiel was by what had transpired and he understood it. He still remembered what it was like back in those days. Holding a crying Sam and feeding him because nobody else would even approach him. The looks on his parents' face, the haunted gazes his mother threw over her shoulder whenever she felt the eyes of a nobleman or servant catch sight of the baby. And then Sam had been gone. Dean had never understood this dark and hazy memory that had crouched upon his memory of Sam like a nightmare. But, despite all that, Dean knew his parents. And he had to believe that whatever it was that they did or didn't do was for the greater good.
"No. It was all good, Benny," Dean assured him. Benny nodded and started eating himself.
"I've seen Cas die… too many times," Dean told him. "And we've had far too many close calls… I don't want that anymore. I just want him and Sam and Mom to be safe for once."
"It's nice," Cas said and turned around, surprised to find Dean standing right behind him. Dean studied him, then he raised his hands to cradle Cas' face in his palms. "Dean?"
"There's been speculation about what a bond like this with a human could do, both to the human and to the angel," she said and Dean was very much aware of how she hadn't answered his question. "It's a romantic notion to say that half of Castiel's heart beats inside your chest now."
"It's fitting," Cas defended himself.
"I wanted to do it myself," Jack said and Dean was surprised that the kid had listened in on their conversation. "I'll facetime him later to present our achievements." Jack studied the side table, sliding in the drawer. Then he sat back on his butt and looked at Dean with the same kind of intense look Cas often sent him.
"Undo the spell, you son of a bitch!"
"We couldn't have Jack show up to class with an old model, right?" Luke said, winking at Cas, who heaved a sigh. Jack's old laptop had been perfectly fine. "You can give your old laptop to daddy. In case he's still using that clunky fossil of a computer."
"Nah, it's kinda funny," he said and then took the coffee Cas was handing him. He blew on it and then took a tentative sip. He licked his lips and nodded his head. "Still mediocre." Castiel smiled up at him, his expression sad.
"Oh no! What a tragedy!" Charlie called, her voice wooden. "Hey, everybody's in the hall having snacks. If you want to make sure that they're not too drunk to hear whatever you've got to tell, I'd hurry up." Dean heaved a sigh and regretfully got out of his bath. He had been soaking long enough after all, but his body still felt heavier than it had any business being.
"Hello Jack!" Mary answered promptly, clearly delighted. "It's so good to meet you! I'm Mary and this is my husband John." John nodded at them. Then she opened the door wider to let them all in. "Come in, come in! You must be Cas!"
"We don't want to make it a big deal. We're mated after all. We're waiting until Sam has found the perfect wedding dress," she said, knocking her shoulder into Sam's. He snorted.
"How the hell did we get into this situation?! What did you get us into?!" he demanded of his parents. John stared at him with a severe expression while Mary looked at him helplessly.
"Gabriel was here. It was windy and the view was boring. Whoever reads this, think of me when you fuck. IV V, Michael II, 1823" and added to that was a crude drawing of a dick. Dean didn’t know how to read what might have been the date since he had no idea how angels counted the years. He doubted they went by the same calendar humans did. He decided to let it be and climbed back down to regroup with the others.
"Actually, I think you should move here. I found some interesting jobs in Illinois for you. I'm sending them to your mail." Jack said and there was the distinct noise of Jack typing on his keyboard.
"Sure General," Dean said with grin, then he pushed at Cas to lie down, his legs still draped over Dean's thighs. It was a hot look on him and Dean wasn't embarrassed to admit that it turned him on seeing this powerful angelic general naked and willing to take whatever Dean wanted to give him.
And he understood them, to a certain degree. Buying a house meant settling down, but it also came with a host of other implications that his family was – as it turned out once Jimmy came over for a friendly interrogation– irritatingly good at picking up on.
"Nah," Dean said with a grin. "It's cool that I'm a god here. Though it's also kinda weird, since I've killed a lot of pagan gods in my time."
"And I guess I'm at his mercy again now," Dean said and couldn't suppress a sigh. "I didn't mean to harm him, I just needed to… put some pressure on him."
“You alright?” Dean asked but Castiel didn’t reply, just pushed himself down a bit more until the head of Dean’s cock was past the tight ring of muscle. Castiel made a muffled sound, but he didn’t stop until he was properly seated, all of Dean inside of him. Castiel lifted his head with a small groan and looked up at Dean. His cheeks were flushed and his mouth slightly open. Dean put his hands on Castiel’s hip, gently brushing his fingers over Castiel’s warm skin. It was all the encouragement Castiel needed to start moving. He slowly rolled his hips experimentally, but, apparently unsatisfied with that, started lifting himself up, almost all of Dean slipping out, before he lowered himself back down. Dean gripped Castiel’s thighs at the unexpected fierceness, especially once Castiel started with a rather unforgiving, forceful pace.
"Similar how? I'm certainly not a pagan god. I hunt things like you," he said and the god lifted an eyebrow.
He wasn't exactly surprised by what Castiel had revealed. He knew that Cas liked him and Dean had a close enough connection to Cas to also feel a constant warmth of fondness. But Cas had never before verbalized it like this. And somewhere along the way, Dean had decided that the best course of action was to disregard how and why he had ended up here, with Cas. Nobody made him feel like he was a prisoner anymore, but Dean had also resolutely chosen to avoid any situation where he would potentially be reminded of it. It wasn't like he forgot about it, because he still exchanged letters back home and he still missed being able to just go wherever he wanted to go.
"It's fine," he assured him. "Remember, you have a temporary, conditional leave to come into the country to show me the way to Sam."
"Come on. I'm not stupid and it's not like we'll be graded." Cas hardly found that a comforting attitude, but he had no good arguments to keep Dean uninvolved.
"But that's… Sam… She was clearly warding herself against a witch! It makes no sense that she would be so careless if she wanted to fly under the radar!" Dean shouted and instantly flinched at the loudness of his words. He listened to the quiet house with bated breath, but the shower was still running so he hoped that Cas hadn't heard him.
"Yes!" Jack exclaimed at once. "Police have found it hard to determine a precise cause of death. They assume the man was killed and then skinned, but there were apparently no wounds that verified their assumption. No drugs in his system either. No suspicious marks that would give us any hint what did this. Like… bite marks or drained blood." He was silent for a beat, as he typed something else. "But there were witnesses. They said it was a woman who did it! It was a group of five guys, spending time in the park. Apparently, they spent some time with her and when they wanted to leave she killed one of them. But the police say that they don't quite believe that the witnesses are telling the truth, as most of them seem to be too terrified and refuse to give accounts."
"Jack's not been very forthcoming about what your job is," he said, looking Dean up and down, probably scrutinizing the cost of his outfit. Dean was wearing what Mary fondly called the family's very own version of lumberjack chic. He never bothered dressing up when he was with Cas, since they usually didn't have time to go out on a date.
"You don't have a claiming bite, so I guessed not… No offense, but you come across as pretty… sheltered. Like you're new to this all. You look like you're… I don't know… early, mid 30s?" Castiel wasn't sure what to say to that so he merely shrugged. "Your family must have really kept you on a tight leash. I know how those things go sometimes, with male omegas… female alphas… Society is freaking weird, man."
“Okay, Jack. I’ll come over and check it out. Can you manage to wait a little bit longer?”
Cas had diligently set himself to clean all the areas which weren't off limits to him as a male omega, and later on under Cara's watchful eyes also the rooms which were off limits, not just to him but most other omegas too. The heat rooms, as Cara declared them, were the worst. The smell – Cas couldn't quite call it a stench, because for some puzzling reason it was not entirely unpleasant – nearly made him back out right away after Cara had unlocked the door. It looked like a hospital room in a way.
"Am I supposed to believe that? It's not like I'm here because I want to be. I'm your prisoner! Or your brother's." Anna shook her head.
"Then we will have to wait and see," he decided, then he eyed the sword he had discarded. "And be vigilant." Dean sighed.
"I… yes, she told me…," he said, then he leant forwards a bit, his face imploring. "But Dean… I don't want to pressure you."
"Hello to you too," Dean said, the low rumble of his voice and chuckle a comfortable vibration against Castiel's cheek. With a groan, Cas righted himself. "I take it the interview…" he trailed off, searching Cas' eyes. "I don't know actually know how it went. I can't read your grumpy expression!"
Aware that he couldn't keep the stranger waiting for too long without raising suspicion, he returned to the main room, pleased to see that the light worked here too without a dash of magic to help it along. Doing magic right under a hunter's nose was simply too careless, even if it didn't take more than a flick of his finger to get it done.
"Okay. Then I'll just have to find something to do," he said, then he put his hands on Cas' waist, pulling him closer. "Alright? It's all good." Cas hummed to that and put his hands around Dean's neck, breathing in deeply. They stayed like that for a while, but then Cas sighed and pulled back. He checked his watch.
"Are you referring to our sex life? Because I told you Dean, what you suggested is highly inappropriate, even for us," Castiel said. Dean rolled his eyes.
"Hey, Cas. I thought you might like a cup of tea?" Cas startled when Hannah was suddenly next to him. He hadn't even noticed her coming in. Hannah's worried expression didn't help. "You're pretty out of it, are you alright?"
"I don't think that's wise. It might give us the impression that you want to expand into human lands," he answered. Anna huffed.
"Oh I can see that," she said, then she let Castiel go again.
"Well… that's not too bad from my perspective, but I guess he still has thousands of years ahead of him…" Dean said, quite shocked to hear that an angel could actually become human, or as good as.
"What if this god version of me kills me on the spot? I've only got a regular gun with regular bullets. That'd only piss off a god," Dean said.
"What does that mean?" Benny asked, clearly dubious. "And why now?"
"That's very sweet," Cas said with a low chuckle. Dean playfully swatted at his hips. "I didn't think I'd ever date again. Sure, I knew my marriage had failed but I thought I'd just… endure? Or divorce and never be with anyone again… If it weren't for Jack and my niece, Claire, I wouldn't even have a dating profile." At that he frowned. "Well, I closed it after meeting you, so technically I don't have a dating profile."
Then he got Charlie and Benny to have dinner with him in his quarters to tell them about his ideas.
"Don't know. I'm tired I guess?" Dean muttered. He was drawn to Cas, even though he was worried about what Sam had told him. He was just… Cas. He was loveable and cute and Dean liked being close to him. Cas lifted his arm, an invitation for Dean to cuddle close. Which he did. He felt comfortable around him and soon he felt Cas' soft touch ease his tension.
He got up and poked his head out of the door, just in time to see Cas walking down the corridor towards him. Cas spotted him right away and he saw the way the tired expression on Cas’ face softened into a relieved smile.
“In the basement. It’s…” Dean wrinkled his nose but he then heaved a sigh. “It’s LARPing stuff.”
"Rapunzel. Corn salad."
"Well, that's not a good sign," Dean muttered and clicked the article open. There was a grainy photograph of Cas' mom, holding a kid in her lap.
"And I will do whatever I can to redeem myself to you," Castiel promised. "I can't stop being a witch, but I'll try to at least do some good." Dean nodded. "So if there's anything, anything at all that I can do for you, please, tell me."
"I will be very vulnerable after I returned the souls, Dean. You have disappointed me… Your lack of faith in me has been very… hard to understand. And you have told me that you do not trust me… How can I trust you? How can I trust one of you not stab me in the back again the moment I can die for you?" Castiel asked, his voice even but soft. Dean felt shame and guilt burn his cheeks uncomfortably, but he had to push it to the side.
"I'm 'pissed' that you knocked me unconscious!" Castiel told him, raising his voice and taking a step closer to Dean. He was in his heavenly wrath mode and while Dean still found this damn fucking scary, he didn't back down. He was right here. He had done the right thing! "I'm 'pissed' that you trapped me in a ring of holy fire for over a week."
"Yeah. I was the same when my mom died," Dean told him. Cas snuggled into Dean's side, not saying anything else. And that was fine with Dean. He knew that he should let it rest, put the pendant back and let Cas keep his memories of her untainted.
"But you worried too. You said you were a newly divorced father of a teenager as if that would make you less attractive to someone else," Jack observed and the kid had a point there. "Claire said some people consider that… luggage."
"Fine. That sounds agreeable to me. Let us know what Anna decides, though I assume she will back you up, since she is your sister," she told Cas.
"At least I was classy about it, I'm a lady after all." Benny laughed, but then he elbowed Dean.
"As we expected, the police are totally in over their heads with this one. They gladly let me have a look at the remains. Wasn't pretty," Sam's voice came through the speaker. "No suspicious marks on the victim's skin. Though it looks like the skin wasn't cut, but torn."
"Cheese," Dean said flatly and Cas nodded.
"Hey Cas," he said. "Sorry I've been a stranger."
"Yes? How many children do you have?"
Dean reached out to run his fingers through Castiel’s hair and that small gesture of tenderness made the stiffness in Castiel’s shoulders disappear and he nuzzled his cheek against the soft ground he was lying on.
"I'll drink to that. It can't be any worse than meeting Luke's father. That was one dysfunctional family dynamic. I'm sure the Winchesters will be much more reasonable." Despite being slightly irritated, Cas had to laugh.
Dean was taking big, gasping breaths, his face was covered in a sheen of sweat and his eyes were vibrant. But he was breathing. He was alive. Cas sank to his knees and grabbed Dean's hands.
"Okay, but you must stay down here and get people out of the rooms if you can! Don't do anything reckless, Dean!" He said and Dean nodded. Luckily for Cas's intense worry, some of the fire fighters were quick to follow their crown-prince into the building, preventing him from being too heroic. That left Castiel to go up, the fire trying to lick at him, but being prevented by his magic. He tried to get a read on the place, searching for imprints Sam had left behind. Finally, he found a tiny trace of him and followed it to a room. He held out his hand and the door burst open. Fire greeted him, but he stepped through it.
Cas had to laugh at that, relief flooding him. He didn't know why it mattered that Dean approved.
"Well, if she has tried to ward herself, then she didn't do a good enough job," Cas said, his voice curt. He closed the book with a snap. The sound startled Dean and he instantly regretted his line of questioning. He didn't know how Cas' mom died, but considering Cas choice of words, it probably wasn't a natural death.
Some uneasy chuckles went through the room. Logically, Cas knew that dragon eggs were durable, the shell hard and sturdy some weeks after it had hardened up from the softer shell present during birth. But there were crucial weeks after delivery when the slowly hardening shell was prone to easy cracking when people weren't careful.
"You're terrible, Gabriel," Castiel managed to say, though it wasn't as biting as he would have wished, because deep down he knew that Gabriel just stated the truth.
"We don't have enough space, so we set up some tents outside as well," she said, sounding apologetic, as if Dean would possibly judge them for it.
At least that was the mantra ringing through his head.
"No," Cas grumbled and continued kissing Dean until Dean managed to pull the phone free. With reluctance Dean pulled back, licking his lips, then he looked at the phone.
“Everywhere,” she said then she tilted her head slightly with a pensive expression. “Nowhere.” Castiel’s wings ruffled in exasperation. These vague answers were starting to grate on him. “A long time ago, my brother spoke of this. A spark of something that wanted to be born. Being in its purest form,” she explained.
Dean was almost at Gabriel's gaudy bakery, when he was pulled out of his daydreams by his phone ringing. He pulled it out of his pocket, checking the caller ID. Sam.
"What's wrong?" Castiel asked and Dean reached behind himself to pull his gun out of his waistband and checked the bullets.
“I called the phone number you gave me!” Jack added, clearly proud of himself.
"What? Instead of just telling me the truth so that I could drive off?"
"Cas," Dean stopped him, holding on to Cas' hand. Cas looked down at their joined hands and then up at Dean. His expression went from calm to vulnerable almost at once. It was the same look Cas had given him that time in the barn with Ramiel. When he had bled all over the floor and whispered out that confession. And Dean hadn't said anything. He would have to now.
"Good, now you should better go wash up, you stink."
Even though Cas knew he was going to see Jack again on the very next day, he still felt unsettled as he watched Jack hug Dean good-bye.
"Selfishly I'd like that, but I doubt you'd be able to rest easy if you knew that the wind was slowly turning against humans. You'd worry, like any future king would," Cas said and of course he was right. "But as you said… It's fucked up." Dean laughed at that.
"Yes please," the boy said politely, taking off his backpack and his shoes.
"Oh."
"Yeah?"
It appears so. :/
His usual clothing seemed to be gone. His feet and legs were bare. The only thing that covered him was a formless sort of tunic that only reached to his mid-thighs and had a long cut down the collar, exposing part of his chest. It was the same color as his trench coat but that was where the similarities ended.
"He seems to be developing well in your care," she said with a smile. "I'll be bringing you your food in a bit." Castiel nodded and the server left.
"Of course I would!" Dean agreed, putting his notes back into the folders. At least this time taking Dean's mind off the case had been a success.
“Cas, hey! Fuck, I can’t believe it! I’ve been trying to call back for weeks! I was about ready to admit that I probably had a psychotic breakdown and hallucinated the entire call!” Dean’s voice rang out through the sudden silence. The Shadow was creeping closer, interested.
“Yes, but what about supernatural pregnancies? How do angels procreate?” Jack asked, following Dean swiftly, even though it seemed like Dean as trying to outrun his questions. Jack put down the groceries on the kitchen counter.
"Wow," Dean said, unable to avoid a snicker. "Those guys were surely off their rocker."
"Huh? Yeah, I'm just thinking," he said. Castiel lifted his eyebrows, but surprisingly Dean didn't come right out with the information, even though Castiel had expected that a little nudge would be enough. Dean seemed to notice Cas' look eventually. "I usually spend my holidays with my brother, but he's busy." And that was all Dean apparently wanted to say on the subject and even though Castiel knew that he could push for more information, he didn't actually want to make Dean give him more than he wanted to, even though this was a small, almost meaningless gesture considering the spell he had cast on Dean.
was clearly out of place in here.
"You're my mate, Castiel. Not my servant," Dean insisted. "And we have to make this work somehow, at least as long as we're both working for Sandover." Castiel watched Dean eat his pasta. His scent was easy to read: he was anxious and angry, though Castiel knew not to take it personally.
"Dude, it's been months! Don't be a stranger!" she argued when Dean met her at the restaurant where she had booked them a table. She boxed his shoulder lightly in reprimand, then she pulled him into a firm hug. "You alright?"
"I was tipsy at best and in full control of my mental capacities and my dick," Dean insisted. "Your loss, dude."
He caught himself after a while, before his eyes snapped back up to Cas.
"You've got to be kidding me…!" he hissed, then he took another look through the standing stones at the landscape beyond the hill. It didn't look like there was a city nearby. He was in the middle of fucking nowhere.
"I don't think my mother believed in witches… She wouldn't have had a reason to ward herself against them…"
"But that's not the kind of bond that Cas is needing from me, is it?" Dean asked, "this wasn't a mutually agreed upon commitment after all."
"As they say; no rest for the wicked. ;)" Cas stared at the message. Sure, he had absolutely no clue about things like these, but was this flirting? Or was Mr. Winchester -
He had done this. He had ruined this beautiful creature, brought a god down to his knees, made him shout in ecstasy. Dean did this.
"You should mind your own business!" Dean spat out instead. The god lifted an eyebrow at him.
"You can put him in his basket. You don't have to hold him all the time," Dean said, struggling to not let his frustration bleed into his words, but he didn’t know if not some of it reached Cas anyway through the bond. He looked up at Dean, studying him carefully.
This house gave nothing away, scrubbed clean of any aura, the walls having no voice to whisper the owner's thoughts or emotion, jealously guarding all its secrets. It unsettled Cas to be so blind to the thoughts and emotions of the other members of the coven whenever they had a gathering like this. He knew that the coven was linked, allowing them to communicate with each other, but Castiel was shut out since he was not officially initiated yet.
"We are all aware that the reason the hunter is investigating in our town is because of your exorbitance," she chastised coolly. "Dumah could cover up some of your missteps but she couldn't stop the news from reporting it this time. People talked about it," Naomi breathed in, soothing out her irritation, "on the internet already yesterday."
"It changes nothing," Naomi had insisted with a sniff, "this is bureaucracy." Naomi saw it as a challenge and Cas supposed that he should be glad, because when Gabriel heard about his status through the grapevine proverbial hell broke loose. At least for Castiel, who didn't like being the center of attention unless it was because of a job well done. (Which happened often enough, so he had a modicum of tolerance for fussing. Just not this kind of fussing.)
Dean looked over his shoulder, doubt and longing etched into his face, as he guided his horse down the path that would take him away through the pine forest. Castiel had his mother's robe wrapped around him, but still the winter air soaked up Dean's warmth, no matter how he wished to keep it inside. He lifted his hand up in a silent farewell. Dean nodded, then he rode out.
Was this part of some deal the Shadow made? But with whom? What were the rules? Surely, Dean hadn’t… Worry pushed away all other thoughts and Cas reached into his pocket for his phone. Or he would have, but his hand just brushed fabric. Frowning, Cas looked down at himself.
He followed an angelic servant to the ground floor of the manor, finding himself in a big hall fashioned with long tables where people were already sitting. There was a big fireplace and tapestries and banners adorned the wall. Even though it was simple compared to the showy halls in Winchester castle, it looked impressive. Once Dean entered, the room slowly fell silent, all eyes turning to him. There was one table situated in front of the grandest tapestries, showing a mixture of forest and battle scenes. Castiel rose from his seat and Dean noticed that there were empty seats at that table. He quickly looked around the room, finding his friends seated at another long table, with some angels joining them.
"I'm just method acting," Dean said with a wink. Castiel frowned at him, but then his expression became blank. Right. This was a game to Dean and Cas was supposed to humor him. He bent down and got the egg. He held it out to Dean, who took it easily. But he handled it like it was a ball, not a living thing. Well, it wasn't a living thing. But Dean's hand position on the egg was atrocious.
"Yes," Cas decided. "I would like to know if you want kids."
"Yeah… But Cas, it's not like I think of this all the time. I don't think of myself as a prisoner. Hell, I haven't thought about making an escape in months," Dean insisted. "I want to see this through the same way you do." He tapped his finger on the letter. "And this will help us. I'll be glad to use this chance to investigate."
"Shhh… It's alright. Everything's alright," Mary soothed him, kissing his head, but then she sought out the witch's eyes.
"It's not that I say you need to do it, just that you… you know… could," Dean argued softly, "put on a T-shirt when it's hot, some shorts maybe. I'm sure that'd look…" Dean stopped himself to allow for a little amused snicker. "Well. I know it'd be great." Castiel couldn’t stop the fond smile and he rolled his eyes at Dean.
Some crows had gathered to enjoy the last rays of reddish sunlight on the roof of his tower. Castiel was tracing the childish scribbles Sam had etched into the window sill when he had been 5 years old and almost given Cas a heart attack by climbing up to the window. A croak came from above, startling Castiel out of his mindless staring. He breathed in deeply to get a grip and then he turned his head sharply upwards when he heard the flutter of many wings, indication of the crows' take-off. He leant out of the window in case the crows were saying a well-mannered good-bye. The message displayed however was the following:
"Maybe you understand it better than me, because I'm really not getting to grips with it all that well…," Dean said. "I want to go back, but I want to stay here. It's fucked up. But maybe I'm just worrying about nothing. Maybe Michael will not accept the evidence Winchester collected, maybe I'll just stay here."
"So, we have those old angelic maps, right?" Dean nodded impatiently. "So far it's all been correct. There's no evidence of people on this mountain, at least not now. But there must have been angels living here once upon a time."
Anna walked back towards him, a smile on her face.
"Why did you not push on?! You ran with your tail tucked between your legs! What a disgrace!" Christian Campbell accused him and it took Benny and Bobby to stop Dean from knocking out his cousin's teeth. But he had given him a black eye at least and while that felt good, it got him kicked out of the council meetings.
"Do you think it's working?" Dean wondered, when they were walking back from breakfast. Dean wasn't really sure where they were going, but he was somewhat reluctant to leave Cas' side just yet. Cas didn't seem intent on getting rid of him either. Cas turned to look at him, tilting his head in question. "The bond? You seem to look healthier, but it's really hard to tell…," Dean clarified.
"Seriously, Cas, I can actually help," Dean said, a small crease between his brows.
"Yeah, yeah. Quit bragging," he muttered.
After that, Dean excused himself soon after putting their empty bowls into the dishwasher.
"Thank you for the shopping trip," he said, receiving a grin from Claire. "Say hi to your parents for me, alright?"
"Bye, Castiel," she said when they were at the door and she left without another glance at Dean when Castiel had called his good-byes.
"Why? Is he telepathically communicating with you or something?" Dean grumbled. "I want to be close to you too!" Dean's face heated in embarrassment when that slipped out. Cas looked surprised but not particularly disturbed by Dean's outburst. He studied Jack, gave him a little awkward bounce before he put Jack in the basket. Both held their breath but Jack remained silent, content enough to slumber in his basket. Castiel turned away from the bed and promptly walked up to Dean, sitting down on his lap.
“Why am I here?” Castiel asked, his voice dancing like stars through space, ruffling Amara’s blonde hair. “I was in the Empty. I was…” Castiel startled, looking down towards his human form, still cradling something. The phone! Dean!
“The thought that the issue might be him never crossed his mind and he was offended when I suggested it. But he was also not really interested in having a second child since the chances were pretty good that our son would be an alpha, which is what he wanted.”
"Better than driving you to a pyre, right?" he wondered with a chuckle, but it was rather dark and Castiel didn't feel like laughing either. Castiel didn't need any help to pull the bulky thing to the horse or attaching it. He hopped on the wagon once they were settled. And off they went.
"Really?" Dean asked and his excitement was hard to deny. Cas nodded at him and Dean grinned. "That's awesome. I was definitely getting rusty. Thanks, Cas."
"Okay, my
“Relax, son. There’s no reason to be embarrassed. I was in your shoes, Sam was in your shoes. It’s all fine,” John said, then he marched past Dean and into the store.
"I'm gonna get some more wine," he announced. Mary laughed, shaking her head.
"What an ass," Dean said, but Cas shrugged at that. "Well, you have me now."
"I must do what is right for the kingdom. I'm a queen now," she announced with a firm voice. Then she turned and departed with no further words, and if her heart was heavy to lose her child, she hid it well.
"Of course," Castiel answered and Dean got everything and put it down on the table. Castiel had a plate with buns and butter in front of him, but it didn't look like he had touched it yet.
"Are you… Cas, come on! You said you didn't want to have a baby and that was when we were talking about your own baby! Surely you don't want this!"
"Yes, he just got here," Cas answered, putting the phone down, speaker switched on.
“Yes!” Emma spoke up. “I'm interested in the early omega rights movements. Do you have anything about the Amazons? I know people don’t like to talk about them because they’ve got lots of issues, but I wanted to know more.” Castiel blinked in surprise, but soon he got up from the table, Emma following suit at once.
"Aw, what's with the long face?" Ellen asked when they showed up in the private dinner hall, where Adam and Sam were already sitting. "Didn't Charlie tell you that there would be pie for dessert today?" Ellen's big smile, and the playful shove Charlie gave him, made the corners of his mouth tick up despite his general somber mood. He took his seat and was served right away.
"I contacted Rowena when you first told me about… Cas' predicament," Bobby said, darting Cas a look.
"I grew up in Lawrence, Kansas. My parents still live there, my younger brother lives in California with his girlfriend. I went to college to study literature and somehow ended up getting a Master in business administration instead. I'm senior VP of marketing and sales at Sandover Bridge and Iron. I recently ended a long-term relationship. I think I hate my job and might be having a midlife crisis, hence the online shopping and the dating app. I was never married and don't have kids, but I'm not averse. Ah, I also drive a sensible Prius to work, but the love of my life is my classic '67 Chevrolet Impala. That's about it. Was that 30 seconds?"
As became clear on the following day, Cas wasn't the only one who had had a bad night though. Emma came into work even grouchier than she had been the day before.
It was late afternoon by the time Cas decided they would drive into Lebanon. Jack put on his backpack, but then stood next to Castiel’s car for a moment.
"Not necessarily," Dean mused. "But go on?"
“Dean, we don’t even have a bed!” Cas complained, but he did follow Dean up into what was going to be their bedroom. It had plenty of windows and access to a pretty balcony looking over their yard. Dean laughed, then he plopped down on the floor, assuming an enticing pose and sending Cas an exaggeratedly sexy look.
"I'm not that young. I had Dean's dad when I was
Luke looked him up and down, his expression hard to read, but then he burst out laughing.
"I buy plenty of nice things for myself," Cas muttered defensively, but Jack latched on to Claire's argument quickly.
"I don't understand how you could even sign that document without having me at least check it!"
"Yeah, happens to the best of us," Dean said and shot Cas an encouraging smile, then he pulled the apple pie close. "Maybe Gabriel could help you out, but it's not like you seem to be hurting for people eating your pie."
"Cas, you're worrying me…" Sam whispered but Castiel only shook his head.
“Sorry,” he mumbled. Dean’s hand patted his back and then Dean took a step away. Cas realized that Dean’s eyes were red and wet as well. They looked at each other, Dean not speaking and Cas could see that Dean was getting somewhat tense. Cas really had had no time to think about what it would be like to see Dean again. Was Dean uncomfortable? Or possibly even angry?
"What for?" Castiel asked, feeling exasperated. "I don't have any assets for him to steal."
"What are you doing anyway?" Castiel dared to ask, sitting down in the chair next to Dean. Dean moved slightly and it was probably no accident that their knees bumped.
"He might be able to fix the whole cosmic consequences bullshit," Dean said and Castiel narrowed his eyes.
"Can I call him??" Emma asked right away, pulling out her mobile phone.
"So what happens now? You're getting mated because of work?" Gabriel asked after a long moment of silence.
"Witch," Mary said, but faltered when he set his eyes on her.
They didn't have vows to share, since they would say everything that needed to be said in privacy (eventually). But they did have rings and Cas had a bouquet and Dean the obviously mandatory tears.
"Can we have pizza?" Jack asked right away, his expression brightening. He put his phone away and jumped up on his feet. Cas smiled at him, stepping outside so Jack could follow. Dean walked into the living room not long after, wearing his pajamas, looking quite a bit more comfortable.
"It would be unfortunate if your misadventure swayed the opinion of the High Council. As far as I can tell there have been voices who were in favor of pushing humans back again. Those voices might feel emboldened to try to gather more support now that you have attacked us. It would be drastic, but if the Kings and the High Council decides to push you back then you would not stand a chance."
"And you fear that's jeopardized now by him learning that you've… I don't know. Plotted against him behind his back?" Benny wondered. Dean shrugged helplessly.
"Well…," Dean said and darted a look to Cas, feeling his face heat up slightly when Cas returned his look. "It wasn't that bad," he said and Cas' expression melted into a fond smile. "Yeah… some of it was really good."
A black hole in the center of the galaxy. That was how Donatello had described it. Not having a soul meant not feeling anything at all. Jack didn’t feel nothing because he had certainly felt
"I want to be alerted when Castiel is back and ready to meet me," he said. Surprise was written all over Donna's face, but she soon broke into a grin.
"Uh… I don't know… We don't really talk that much when we have breakfast…," Dean confessed.
"Sorry, Dean," Cas said, walking past with a tray full of dishes. "I'll be with you right away." Dean's moody thoughts were swept away by the same fluttering feeling and he couldn't help but smile at Cas.
counted on Dean's hostility to ease up. It was only sensible for them to work together to solve the mystery and while the weeks seemed to pass without any promising breakthroughs, he was still not ready to give up on what his instincts were telling him. Eventually Dean must have come to the conclusion that working together would be most beneficial, because he no longer ignored Castiel's existence. And Cas did enjoy their breakfast sessions, he actually enjoyed them immensely and he wasn't embarrassed about it. He wasn't ashamed to confess to himself that he was lonely and miserable in Milton Heights despite the fact that Uriel put in a massive effort to spend time with him even though the temperamental man would much prefer to go back to his duties. Even Anna and his mother were around for him, but nothing helped lift the fog and discomfort that seemed to settle inside him and that had the days drag on endlessly. Nothing but Dean.
“We’ll talk to Sam and Dean but I think it’s best not to use them if you don’t have to. You can use them if you have to protect people. And if accidents happen, then we’ll deal with them together. Alright?”
"I'd suggest you go seek revelation. Both of you," he said, his voice low and rough. Uriel laughed, then he clapped his companion on the back.
"Oh," the woman said, taken by surprise. "Is Dean your mate?" Castiel tilted his head. "Sorry, just… the way your scent changed when you talked? Just… contentment. Joy even?" Castiel looked at her, then he turned his head slightly to sniff at his shoulder. The woman laughed. "You're pretty weird."
"I apologize for not going on a ride with you earlier," he said and Dean couldn't quite hold back a snort, opening his mouth for a tasteless joke, but Cas sent him a warning glare.
"Probably binge-watching Star Wars again, the little nerd…" Anna said with a chuckle. Dean had already heard a thing or two about Jack's fascination with Star Wars.
“No. According to the research I did, ghosts can still come here, despite those sigils. Iron and salt keep them out. But I’m sure father wouldn’t like me spreading salt everywhere,” the kid said. Dean nodded along, but he wasn’t sure what he thought about hunters giving people half-assed information on the supernatural. It was very easy to get yourself killed if you only had partial information. He had given enough people the talk, but usually he only did out of necessity. He supposed being a hunter with a kid was a necessity. He wondered what kind of person Jack’s dad was. Dean would have to ask later, first he had to do his job.
"Come on Cas, don't fish for compliments. You know they are good and way more than any prisoner deserves," Uriel said with a roll of his eyes.
Dean did send them a perfunctory smile and they didn't really need more engagement from him anyway. He excused himself early after he ate his salad and went back up to find that Cas had sent him a selfie, posing with a burger.
"Did you get lost?" she asked.
"Where is Asmodeus?" Castiel asked.
"Asmodeus?" Castiel repeated. "But that's one of the princes of hell."
"I found a case!", he declared and Castiel felt a spark of dread before he realized that he wasn't talking about the case of the freak storm. Dean showed him the newspaper but Cas only caught the words "mysterious deaths" in a town that was roughly a six hour drive away.
"I don't know, Benny. I can't just ignore the circumstances and approach Cas like any other dude who saved me from death."
"Then I feel we should take the possibility into consideration that it was demons who attacked,
"Thanks for the meal," Dean said and put all his plates into the sink. "Don't get up, I can wash up after myself," Dean assured Castiel when he made to rise from the chair. "Least I can do to replay you for your hospitality."
"Yeah, the weather looks great, we'll be heading there soon," Dean answered.
"As I'm not initiated into the coven, I wasn't told anything. But the destruction of Sander's orchard was part of a dispute between Sanders and the witches who had dealings with him," he answered, not sure how this even mattered at this point. Sam didn't say anything, he merely studied him.
"What…? Are you alright? How did you come back?" Dean chuckled at that.
"Uhm, yes, ma'am."
"It wasn't like you were ever going to ask me out on a date. I had to take it into my own hands," Castiel said and Dean had to laugh. It was honest, but there was a slight tremor of anxiety underneath it. This wasn't something Dean was comfortable with. It wasn't exactly clear to Cas what about it made Dean nervous enough that his hand was slightly damp when Cas took it. Maybe it was simply it being romantic in a way that Dean liked but didn't like to admit he liked. Or maybe it was a more complex issue of Cas inhabiting a body that everyone else instantly assumed to be male, which would therefore expose Dean's sexuality. And Dean never liked having certain things about himself exposed so plainly. But even if it was that, Dean didn't let it spoil the date for him.
"Nah. I'm good," she said. Dean wasn't sure if she was actually engrossed in her reading or if she was just punishing him for his previous behavior. Whatever, he didn't care.
he got into the clutches of a Nephilim," Dean snapped. "If we hadn't put him into that ring of fire he'd have stopped us from extracting the Grace! Which would have potentially ended the world! And now he can't even say a simple thank you for saving his ass?"
It took only half a step for Dean to pull Cas to him.
"What ha-" he started to ask, quick to realize that something had happened in his absence, but since Dean was leaning against the empty fireplace, staring out of the window with his arms crossed, he knew that he wasn't hurt.
"Easier to interrogate people when you're dressed for the job," he said with a wink and took a seat at his table. Castiel left to prepare Dean's lunch, letting his thoughts run wild again. That Dean put on the FBI suit in public seemed conspicuous. Of course, all the witches in Raurica were already aware of Dean being here and would probably not question his disguise. Still… it seemed careless somehow, but it wasn't like Castiel understood how hunters operated.
"You sure? You're an alpha, Dean. Tell me, when did you first rut?"
"I'm sorry, your Majesty," he started, but John frowned at him and waved his hand.
"Why is he…"
birthday the curse on him will reach the height of power."
"No, but you were pretty clingy."
"They will do," Dean answered tensely at that and Castiel shot Uriel a reproachful look.
"It's because you're sweet and you're a nerd. You get that from your dad," Claire said with a wink. Castiel had listened to the conversation with a bit of a heavy heart. The idea of Jack away at college, leaving him with an empty house, an emotionally (and usually also physically) distant husband and a job going nowhere was hardly something he wanted to ponder. But he'd have to face it eventually. His friends had more or less decided for him that he deserved a vacation so that he could take his mind off of it. Castiel was pretty sure sitting alone at the beach without his kid for the first time in 18 years would just make him miss Jack more.
“They have phone reception in the Empty?” Dean asked, his voice sounding incredulous. But before Cas could answer, Dean’s breathed in deeply. “I don’t know what kind of games you’re playing, but it’s not funny.”
“And what were you up to while I was gone?” Dean asked after he had launched into a lengthy recount of the training (apparently his boss fell asleep on the pool tables in a local bar and almost missed the morning program on the second day).
Dean had never been interested in online dating. He knew how to pick up someone in a bar, but truth to be told… he didn't really feel like it anymore. Since he and Lisa had decided to end their relationship, Dean had somewhat… drifted. He always had to travel a lot for his job and it had taken its toll on his relationship. He had joked with his co-workers that if you were single, this kind of job would be ideal to hook up with people. A new city every other week, new bars, new hunting grounds for an alpha such as him. But now that he was actually single…? It didn't appeal to him all that much. He no longer was a carefree 20 something year old, unattached alpha. He was pushing 40 and while that was no issue at all, he kind of found he simply wasn’t feeling the whole bar scene anymore. He also wasn't really feeling his position at Sandover anymore, but he didn't want to make any rash decisions just because things were changing in his life and he was uncomfortable about it.
"You're right… It's not fair and Dean did nothing to deserve this…," he said once he had regained his breathing. Sam looked at him, his expression forlorn. Castiel sighed, showing Sam a small smile. He reached out and brushed his palm over Sam's cheek gently. "And neither did you… I thought that if I raised you right I could protect you… Maybe even redeem myself… But I understand now that I was a fool. But there's something I can still do."
"I will take care of him, because it's the right thing to do. But I know this makes it harder for Dean and me. And selfishly, I'd choose Dean over this child. But I can't choose…," Castiel said, heart heavy. "Will I be a bad guardian because of that? Because if I could choose between the man I care for and a helpless child, I would have chosen selfishly?" Mary studied him, her hand staying on his arm.
"Yes. But we will see you again. Maybe in decades, maybe in centuries," she said and then she shook his hand. In this cold place where Cas had always been shut out from feeling anything, it was with this simple handshake that Naomi opened herself up to his magic. And he could feel the pride and her peculiar way of affection. There was neither sadness, nor regret in her. She knew they would meet each other again. Castiel nodded, but he didn't dare to open himself, aware of how he still held on to all of his anger and disappointment and pain. He had no love for her or for anyone else in the coven.
"Oh my god, if that guy's for real then we have to answer! What do you think? Is he your dad's type?" Claire asked, feeling super exited.
Castiel wasn't one to curse the crown, or anything in particular, but he couldn't help but be angry at Mary and John, in a way that he hadn't been when they had imprisoned and then banished him without a trial. Back then he had been sad about the circumstances but he hadn't doubted his decisions once. He had also never turned to the skies to wail about the injustice of it all because at the heart of it all, Castiel was adaptive and he was practical.
"Dean, he saved our lives," Sam interjected but Dean was on a roll.
"When did that happen?" Dean asked, his voice ringing with laughter. He walked over to the counter and Castiel finally noticed that he was wearing a black suit and a long woolen overcoat. He looked amazing.
"Then he almost got himself killed by that dick Ishim. Then Ramiel almost offed him. Then he fucked off to Heaven without telling us, stole the Colt."
"You don't think you're under a spell. Even though all signs point to you being a hunter in a town of powerful, old witches and your boyfriend having ties to them. Just disregarding the issue of Cas, doesn't it strike you as odd that nobody tried to get rid of you yet?"
"Sure," Dean said with a smile, "I'm just a bit nervous. I want you to be comfortable with my family." Cas sent him a smile, then he took Dean's hand and followed Jack, just in time for the door to open. Mary and John were both at the door, well-dressed to receive their guests.
"Raurica doesn't have enough bars for frequent one-night stands," he said and Dean nodded at that, chewing on a bite from his burger. "And I haven't found anyone to be with long term either. I have never been able to… really open up I suppose."
"I worry that you're putting too much on your plate," Cas told him, his voice soft and concerned, melting the block of tension in Dean's chest.
"You know," he said and Cas was quick to stop and turn to look up at Dean. Dean sent a look up and down the corridor, but nobody was around. "If you're not busy then we could put in another session. Make sure the Grace inside me knows where it belongs?" he suggested. Like he had hoped, Cas eyes widened and he was quick to lick his lips.
It was surreal to put all the sheets over the furniture, to close the shutters and let Milton Manor return to its slumber.
"That was the god penis?" Castiel asked, turning away from examining the shelves. He had deemed all the items in here non-lethal in case Dean was careless again and touched stuff.
century," she said, keeping the gun in her hands.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas said with a small smile, feeling a pleasant glow settle over the constant ache in his chest. Dean only mumbled something and continued sipping his coffee.
“Don’t worry, Dean. As far as I can tell it’d require intricate rituals for us to create offspring. I have plenty of space inside of me for a child but it’s trickier to get it in there,” Cas said and Dean groaned.
"Alright, okay!" Dean answered, unable to stop himself from chuckling. "Damn it." Benny patted his shoulder, then he let go.
." Luke made a show of taking out his phone and typing on it. "Which, as a scroll through their website shows, is a lingerie brand for omega men." Luke put the phone back in his pocket and lifted his eyebrows expectantly. "And clearly the lingerie you buy is intended to be seen by me."
But he did worry about the hunter, in the same remote way he cared about other people's wellbeing. He didn't want him to get hurt, but neither did he want the hunter to hurt him. Maybe… Maybe if he just nudged him a bit? Distract him from whatever case he was putting together and have him be on his way. No harm done and no witch hunt brought down upon Raurica because a hunter ended up dead.
By the way, some of you wondered if Cas might be pregnant, based on Millie's comments! He's not, because I don't really think surprise pregnancy would fit Dean and Cas in this story. Dean and Cas will eventually talk about where they stand on the topic of having children together. This will involve talk about pregnancy. I haven't updaten my tags in a while. Should I add a tag for discussion of Mpreg?
"Would it hurt you to actually learn who's in this house?" she complained, to which Dean only shrugged. "Cas does wait for you at breakfast," she said eventually. "No clue what's going on now with you two, but if you do want to make up or whatever, he's clearly amenable."
"Roll on concealer for the eyebags," his assistant told him, "got me through many meetings. Wasn't any less tired, but at least I looked sharp." Dean groaned, rubbing his eyes. "Some more coffee maybe?"
"Ah… I understand," Cas said, dragging the words out so that he could think. "Sanders is not from around here…," he hedged. Dean chuckled, sitting back in his chair, assuming a friendly and inviting pose.
"Hey, Cas?" she called when he was about to close the door.  He looked back into the room. Emma pursed her lips, then she fiddled with her fingers. "Thank you, by the way. For letting me stay here."
"That bad, huh?"
“Oh, Jack…” Castiel started and Jack instantly hated that pitying tone.
From: Castiel Novak (Castiel.Novak@sandover.com)
"Oh, hey," Dean said and got off the bed, putting his feet into his house shoes.
“Dean, you should spend it exactly like you want to spend it. You don’t have to feel guilty,” Cas told him as they walked out of the basement. “You’ll still be 40 when you come back.”
"Oh, yes. That would be kind," Castiel told him and Dean nodded. Cas had his own car but it would be easier to go in with Dean on his first day.
Dean had had 3 weeks to prepare and get used to the idea. The addition of Jack to Cas' usual routine had jarred Dean at first and still didn't quite sit all that well with Dean. He didn't know what to do with the kid or if he should even involve himself with him. If Dean knew that he would be staying here, officially claim the title of Lord of Milton Manor, then maybe he would feel like he needed to be more involved. But right now it felt like Jack was Cas' concern. Where to put the nursery, how to integrate Jack into their daily lives (though for Dean it rather felt like they had to rearrange their lives around Jack) and questions about how to tackle raising him. Even though Dean didn't quite feel at ease letting Cas do all the work, Dean had decided that it wasn't his business and he pretty much kept his emotional and mental distance. At least to some extent. If he would have to leave (and it wasn't actually a question of "if" but of "when") then it was better this way. Cas seemed to understand how torn Dean was about it, even though Dean couldn't quite bring himself to talk about it. And Cas, bless him, didn’t force Dean to talk about it until he was ready.
"A hunter disturbs the peace and is an active threat to our community," Raphael said and looked at Castiel smugly. Raphael took every chance he got to torment Castiel, since the day they had all gathered at the wake for his mother and Naomi had announced that they would take him in. Raphael couldn't stand Castiel. Neither the fact that he was the child of a witch who had abandoned the coven, nor that he had been born with strong magic. There was basically nothing about him that Raphael didn't hate and Castiel had given up trying to please him long ago.
“And why are you being so squirrely about it?” Castiel asked, abandoning his shelf. Dean frowned at Cas.
"Tell me there's something you can do," Dean said and finally tore his eyes away from Cas to stare at the god. The god huffed, almost as if he were offended by the suggestion that he couldn't. Maybe Dean should take comfort in this cockiness.
“Good luck, Castiel,” Mia said, her voice warm, then they said their good-byes. And now Cas was full of nervous energy. He wished Dean was here to tell him the good news. Should he call him? No, no that would be silly. Dean would be back tomorrow, he should be able to wait that long. So instead he texted Jimmy:
"Wait, what?" he managed to say, once he had righted himself again. Meg was already laughing at his confused look, while Dean went from concerned to amused as well.
Sam was trying to be helpful, but all his attempts of encouraging Dean invariably involved saying something about Cas that rubbed Dean the wrong way. Because Sam didn't know Cas! Sure, the guy had broken Dean's heart, but he had been sweet and gentle and he had given Dean the feeling of being important and cherished. And Dean missed it. He missed it so much that he didn't even care anymore that Sam or Charlie walked in on him having a cry fest over a cup of coffee or a whole pie.
"I don't remember that. I was a just a child," Castiel told him, feeling a tinge of irritation build inside him. "You mess up, you get killed. And the child of a monster is a ticking time bomb. The hunter tried to kill me, maybe he hesitated. I survived."
"I'm fine, Cas. And I will explain. Where are you? I think you need to be here too for this." Out of the corner of his eyes he could see god Dean pacing through the small cabin, touching things.
"I'm investigating," he said confidently and Castiel's heart sunk.  Was the magic so strong already that Dean would reveal that he was a hunter out in public, to virtual strangers? Dean must have noticed how he had tensed and laughed easily. "Relax. Nothing bad. I just got curious about what you said on Sanders' and how it might have been a shady business deal," he said.
"Since when has this been a concern to you?" Castiel asked and refrained from slamming the door shut and being done with this conversation. "And we aren't in a position to ignore the context. I don't believe you actually stood behind what you had me tell Gadreel and Muriel today about Dean's merits."
"What are you standing there for? You can't expect me to serve myself!" Castiel heaved another sigh, but then he walked over to the stove and put on a kettle. Rowena took the moment to give the boy a little sniff. She pulled back in surprise. "Oh my! How interesting! This is a child of a royal blood line! And he's got Prince of Hell in him as well!" She announced. Sam had stopped crying, staring up at Rowena with wide eyes. "Shame that he's not a first-born, that would have raised his fetching price on the Goblin Market."
