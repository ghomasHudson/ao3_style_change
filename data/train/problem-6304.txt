He feel Tony shift in his sleep and looked over at the bed side table to look at the alarm read 9:43am. Tony was facing away from him but had his back pressed against Steve’s leg. It was still too early for Tony to wake up, who would just roll out of bed around lunch and head to working on his pending projects in the lab till Steve calls him for dinner. Steve leaned down to Tony’s ear to tell him that he should sleep some more and he would wake him up for lunch. He found sheen of perspiration at the back of his neck and his temple. He was breathing a bit louder than he normally would, clutching a pillow to his chest and he was slightly shivering.
They both hissed at the contact. Tony then slowly pulled at Steve’s cock and let the foreskin collect at the top before pressing the tip of his own cock into the space between the smooth head and the foreskin.
Tony whimpered in his sleep as Steve began jerking him off.
Steve was a happy man. He’d turned 100 last week, the team was all there to throw a party for him. They were all safe. Bucky was alive and well, living with Sam back in DC. There were no alien invasions or robot fighting in the last month only minor SHIELD business. Life was good.
“How does it feel?”
“Tony what... What are you doing?”
“Tony. I love you so much and I trust you okay? Why don’t you tell me what’s on your mind and we can figure out how to get there? Yeah?”
Tony threw the lube on the bed and crawled on his knees to situate himself between Steve’s legs and spread them open. He slid onto his stomach and was now eye level with Steve’s cock that stood upright asking for attention.
Tony twisted in Steve’s arms to face him and they exchanged lazy kisses with too much tongue and no real heat as Steve started giggling against Tony’s mouth.
“I want to fuck your cock” Tony repeated himself and Steve heard him loud and clear this time.
“Hey baby. I’m right here, alive and well.” Steve whispered against the shell of tony’s ear and began pressing kisses to his nape wondering if he should wake Tony up. Tony confessed to dreaming about Steve dying about the encounter with the Winter Soldier where he dropped his shield in Potomac. Steve had promised that he wouldn’t ever stop fighting till his last breathe and Tony promised the same but that went to shit during their next mission when they both couldn’t keep their promises and didn’t bring it up again. They knew it was fair of them to ask the other of something they couldn’t give into themselves. How they didn’t have a fight about it Steve didn’t know.
“All of this is also mine. All of you. All of me is yours as well. You know that right?”
Tony was no exception. He was very open with his affection and his words, made a stammering mess of Steve quite often while singing praises of him. He made Steve feel more comfortable in his skin even before they started dating (he would constantly tell him to sit up straighter and lean his shoulders back and hold his head higher. Steve didn’t know he was curling his body to appear smaller and less threatening.) and he kept ensuring Steve about how he loved his body.
. Sorry, Cap. Look, I shouldn’t make fun of the shit you’ve gone through. What did you want to talk about anyway?”
“I—I heard about your argument with Peter,” Steve said cautiously. James shifted, then winced. He looked like he didn’t know whether to be defensive or uncomfortable.
“That is
here, who
For instance, talking should have probably happened. Probably definitely. Tony was usually rather good at talking. In fact, he considered it one of his specialities. But in this instance, talking was not something he was interested in doing. Which he’d made rather abundantly clear by clearing out of any room Steve Rogers happened to step into.
“Look, you know, you don’t need to do everything around here. I’d be happy to help out—if not with watching security feeds if you don’t trust us with that, we could at least take care of putting the kids to bed—” Steve offered, but he was cut off by an absolutely livid James who yelled,
“I think that’s your sister’s job,” Torrun said, shaking her head. “No point in lecturing. You have the most tactical experience besides the avengers of 199999. We need you out there. I trust them as team members, but…”
“Very well,” he said.
Tony would have liked to have described the hum of the helicarrier as quiet and soothing as that was what she wished it was, but the hum of the helicarrier was actually quite loud when one stood on the top of the upper deck during take off. The propellers labored audibly, slicing through the air with a whistle and working to spray the water out of the works. Tony did not prefer to be on the ocean. Sure, the helicarrier was made for it, but she was
“Next week,” he said. “I already called the—it’ll be next week. The funeral.”
“Classified,” James answered. “Just be there.” Kate picked up Nicole just as James did the same with Lewis who, at seven, would only slow them down. They ran back down the street. Two minutes and they would have to leave, but they weren’t anywhere near safety yet. James had to raise his gun and fire more than once on their way back down the street. Lewis clung around his neck so hard James was a bit worried about his own air supply. When they arrived at the building, James set Lewis down, removed his soft leather coat, wrapped his hand in it and punched through the glass in the door. He worked to kick it and punch it all out, then the Avengers kids ran through. One minute to go—he hoped they were all quick about it. They could only wait so long; James could hear more explosions going off in the background—it was like an Apocalypse or an invasion. They’d weathered a couple of those, but never had it been so utterly unexpected. Dead and injured bodies littered the streets, oozing red mixed with the light white dusting of snow from earlier in the evening.
Kate had only partially been paying attention to Thor’s rather long winded tale, too stuck in her own worries and concerns over it, when Francis leaned over and muttered in her ear,
“Hi! Hello!” Tony waved delicately, unable to hide the irritation from her voice. Things were moving too slowly for her taste. “Yes,
“It’s Tuesday, isn’t it?” Tony asked Matthews. Matthews nodded. “Of course it is. Goddamn Tuesdays. All right.” Tony shifted her weight to take a more commanding stance as she addressed the strange Avengers (plus a couple).  “State your designation or we’ll assume that you’re skrulls or some other as yet unidentified shapeshifters and vaporize you where you stand.” The Other Avengers, as Tony decided to think of them temporarily, all looked quite puzzled. Perhaps, she figured, their aim was off. Perhaps they hadn’t

appreciate the aesthetic.
Their classmates showed up one by one as Kate and Francis waited, sitting on the stoop to the school. Many arrived with crossed arms and contempt. Others had neutral expressions that did little to hide their more subtle signs of annoyance—clenched hands, stiff postures. Kate just stared them all down as they arrived, waiting for every last one to show up. Finally, the last group—Brandon, Madeline, Jeanne, Jennifer, Ken and a few others, all older students, some older even than Kate—ambled out onto the sidewalk. None of them looked happy either. Francis glanced at Kate, worried. He had no idea what she intended to do. She was going to ask for their help, he knew that. But how the hell she was going to
“Hands
“Hey, who forgot to invite us to the party?” Tony demanded as he and Pepper entered. Pepper took a seat by Jane while Tony stood behind the couch, watching the screen.
What should a dying man say? What should his last words be, he wondered?
“Negative, Captain,” James said, and he sounded about as troubled about it as Steve suddenly felt. “But—”
“Mmmph,” Peter said. Steve rolled his eyes.
It was too difficult to explain to a three-year-old that
Steve responded in Russian, which was a bit mindboggling because Tony had for some reason, though he wasn’t sure why, been under the impression that Steve had no second languages.

“Organic, got it,” Peter said, snatching keys off the counter.

“From the kitchen. I was in the kitchen,” Tony said. 3490 Steve looked highly amused now.
“Well, Captain,” he said dryly, “my heart’s all a-flutter. I didn’t even think you liked me.” Steve chuckled.
to,” James spat. And suddenly they both knew that they weren’t talking about Peter anymore. Courage having finally fled from him, James decided to follow that instinct. “Whatever. Just a piece of advice. I’m going to go find Tony.” James turned back the other way.
“For what?” Steve asked. He hadn’t done a thing. He hadn’t given a single useful piece of advice. He’d just sat there.
“All right, let’s get this show on the road. Once we exit to the viewing room, I’ll set up your scenario. We’re going to play a game of capture the flag, super-style. Your goal will be to get the other team’s flag back to your designated area without dying. If you die—that is, if someone delivers gently what would have been a kill shot and calls it—you’re out of the game. Are we down with the rules?” Tony asked. Thor raised his hand, which Peter found hysterical. Everyone stared at him. He looked at his hand.

bad with names,” Stark said. “Agent Rogers, Agent Romanov, this is Happy. Hogan.” Steve was dismayed to realize that his new nickname was likely a permanent development. He wondered how Hogan managed to stand his boss on a regular basis, but Hogan seemed to enjoy the eccentric Senator’s behavior. The feeling appeared to be mutual—Stark sat up front with his chauffeur, leaving the Agents the back of the stretch.
“No,” said Jane vehemently.
Peter had never in his life been short on time with his father. It was a luxury, he knew, and as he got older he appreciated it more. He appreciated how, even though they were often gone saving the world, his parents worked to make time for himself and his sister—and even James too, when he was around. They had never had a nanny, nor had they been sent off to boarding school. They had, when they were too small for school, SHIELD agent babysitters whenever their parents weren’t working from home or were off on a mission. It had been often, sure, but Peter had far more memories of building Lego masterpieces with his mom and drawing with his dad than he had of being put to bed by rotating SHIELD agents. Even as he’d gotten older, the activities might have changed but his parents’ presence hadn’t. Now he worked on building robots with Mom and fixing up a vintage bike with Dad, but the essence was the same.
“Of course,” he said, smiling warmly at the both of them. He looked tired. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind and kissed her head.”What is it, Steve?”
“HOLD,” James replied through the comms system. “Hold position and hold them here until the tear takes them away.”
“Tony! Tony, what are you doing! Disengage! They’re
“Tony! Catch!” Steve called out, then hurled his shield into the sky at Iron Man.
. How many lives was that? Countless, he imagined. An unthinkable number. They would all be destroyed, wiped from existence. His chest tightened.
“A…ball?” Steve asked, looking at the flyer Stark handed him. It was Steve’s time off. He’d just emerged from his room, freshly showered after a nice workout in the gym, only to be immediately confronted by the senator. Steve was just glad he caught him at the door—he had no doubt that Stark would happily have burst in while Steve was changing, or in the shower. The man had no shame and seemed to be wholly unaware of it as a concept.

“Peter,” Steve said wearily. “Just—take me to Peter.”
“LEFT!” Natasha yelled. Instinctively, Kate ducked and dodged to the left. It was fortunate that she’d had years of reacting to sudden, vague, yelled orders, as blue light streamed through where she’d just been. Kate whirled around—there weren’t anymore mounted guns, so where…?
“We got married in a courthouse. There was no fanfare, no magical moment. The kids were all there, as were Natasha and Bucky as witnesses—the only witnesses. I didn’t wear a white dress—I think I was still in my skirt suit for work, actually. There’s only one picture—Bucky took it.”
“Protocol 42 seems a little extreme in the given circumstances,” Tony replied, searching his face. “What else is there?” Steve shifted uncomfortably, careful not to move Tony too much.

“It was a universal bomb,” she told them when other Tony asked how she’d survived and where she’d been. “Transports people immediately near it and then blows up. It was intentionally opening a big rip in our universe. The Tower and the helicarrier both have universal beacons built into them, to attract any wanderers. Blow a universal bomb anywhere near one in our thin universe? Boom, tons of rips, threat of collapse. I tried to warn you before I got blasted into
“Hey! What are you doing?” Peter asked, finally getting up off the bed.
“You have got to stop doing stupid stunts on that thing, Peter, you’re going to break your neck,” Tony admonished.
, James thought to himself, moving from his hiding spot. They hadn’t spotted him when he stupidly just walked outside, but they would come into the warehouse soon enough; he needed somewhere to hide or they’d realize they had the right spot. Because what else would they be doing at this very spot if it wasn’t to find the entrance to the bunker? James ducked behind a large steel machine that had probably once been used to process fish.
There was shooting. Lots of shooting. Duck, roll, run—where did James go? AIM. They looked like AIM. Aim. Clint told her aim was the most important thing. Well that hadn’t exactly been it, wasn’t a direct quote.
less mature in some ways. And yet, he was also darker somehow. He was masking something painful, that much was obvious, and he masked it quite successfully. But perhaps not as successfully as he thought. Steve ruffled Peter’s hair.
“Steve?”
is that true?” Pym asked, overly excited.
“Ok, no, enough with the tearing me limb from limb question here,” Peter said, ending that particular line of scientific inquiry.
James understood. It had taken years of struggling over it, but James understood why his father did what he did. He understood that he would do it all over again if he had to. That was just who he was.
Well. At least she was handsome. Tony sighed and put down her coffee mug.
“I’d like that, thanks,” Tony said. Peter wheeled his desk chair over to his bookcase, grabbed a few books off the shelf, then wheeled back and handed them to Tony.
“So that’s a no, then.”
“Tony, why did you clear my schedule today? I had
,” Francis said. Peter worried, briefly, that they were going to get crap from Dr. Pym for their whispering, but he seemed too into his lecture. He was lost, going in-depth into some of the mechanics of Doom’s technology. Robbie and Juston were hanging on his every word. Billy and Teddy were making out in the back of the room.
“I’m still not taking the picture,” Peter wheezed out. It was barely audible from where they stood, but Tony caught it. In a rage, Flash kicked him in the ribs. Peter hit the pavement again, and ended up rolling over and then onto his side.
“You’ve gone too far this time, Tony,” mature Steve warned her gravely.
“Oh,” Steve spoke, suddenly flustered by the interruption, “I wasn’t really—”
“Your father kept fighting even after
Steve had not felt quite so content in a very long time. He supposed, as the Other Avengers slowly filtered back into the house in pairs or trios, that it was no mystery as to
Steve, of course, had to come back from his run at that exact moment, swinging the front door open noisily, toeing his runners off in front of the door and waltzing to the kitchen like there was no care in the world. Steve paused in the doorway, a dirty smirk already spread on his face. That bastard knew exactly what was going on.
The electric shock of hot, angry arousal shot through Tony’s body, his cock tenting and leaking precum through the thin material of his boxers, eyes glazing over with overwhelming sensations as Steve and Bucky stared at him hungrily.
“Comfortable, sweetheart?” Bucky inquired, whispering in his ear.
Throwing a heavy blanket over them, Bucky began petting Tony, curling his hands in the genius’ messy curls and massaging the tired scalp. Tony moaned in delight, aching up like a cat towards Bucky’s hands, trying to get more skin to skin contact that he craved. Bucky chuckled and slid a large, warm palm under Tony’s shirt and soothed his hands down the expanse of smooth skin. Tony’s body felt like it was made out of liquid, his limbs melting into Bucky’s hard body that was offering warmth and comfort.
Shaking his head and chuckling slightly, Steve walked over to the pair, watching the even rise of Tony’s chest and the light freckles dotted on the bridge of Bucky’s nose. Soft, auburn eyes blinked open, their gaze watching Steve. Without saying anything, Steve understood that Bucky would look after himself and Tony. Steve cracked a small smile and with a lingering gaze at the sleeping couple, walked to the door to go for the habitual daily run with Sam.
“Stevie and I decided that you need a reminder of who you belong to, make sure you don’t forget again. How does a spanking with Stevie’s belt sound? Or would you prefer we edge that pretty prick until it’s straining and turns a nice and that pretty purple shade? Or did you want to be a greedy boy and cum until you’re screaming yourself hoarse?”
Tony doesn’t know how long it’s been. He feels timeless, floating when he closes his eyes and sees, hears their voices. Knowing that staying locked up in his workshop on the pretense of “improving the suit” is not going to help his current situation. Still, Tony sulks with his fourth, maybe fifth, cup of coffee with Jarvis for company.
Already prepared, Bucky slid a burning cup of coffee across the counter, towards where Tony was sitting. Nodding his head in thanks, Tony took a sip and sighed as the liquid settled in his stomach, warming him up from the inside out.
Tony’s mouth dried up, gawking at Bucky like he didn’t think about this already. Didn’t almost look forward to the delicious punishments they always doled on him.
Pulling a t-shirt over his head (skin- tight, of course), Steve stepped softly into the carpeted living room, not expecting to find his two favorite people huddled on the gigantic couch, the Netflix screen saver illuminating the room and the thick curtain covering the windows to block out the sunlight that should otherwise be streaming in.
But of course, Steve and Bucky were the two mist understanding and loving people he had ever met and they would not ever leave Tony unless he had forced them out. Like now. Tony sighed and put the cup of scorching hot coffee back on the bench. He knew that he’d have to face this soon or later and Tony was done in sitting around and feeling sorry for himself.
“Sorry folks, can I steal our boy genius for one second, very urgent Avengers business, need to go now.” Steve rudely pushed through the circle of men surrounding Tony and steered him away, smiling back to all the faces painted in disbelief at the rude getaway.
Tony knew it wasn’t a good idea to stop and talk to Howard’s friends that had come up to him after the Expo. They often made him overly critical of the work he’d done, even though he had poured everything of himself into them. Steve and Bucky, his overprotective super-soldiers, wanted to drag him away, knowing how Tony would always fall into a manic pit of panic afterward. But the hounds were waving him over and Tony knew, just knew he couldn’t leave without suffering through their brutal judgment of his inventions next to his father’s. So he’d gone, despite the protest from Steve and Bucky.
As soon as they’d arrived at the tower, Tony practically ran out of the car and straight down to his workshop, throwing out the generic excuse whenever he wanted to get away, leaving two bewildered supersoldiers in the car.
Tony knew that his supersoldiers weren’t mad at him but that didn't mean there wasn’t a punishment that they had already planned. The smell of fresh coffee and blueberry pancakes lured Tony to wander from the living room to the kitchen, where Bucky was bare-chested with sweatpants hanging low on his hips.
“So have we decided what the punishment should be to toys that disobey?” Steve asked, sauntering over behind Tony’s chair, a dangerous smile on his face, revealing how truly filthy Captain America really was.
“Bucky’s waiting by the limo with Happy,” Steve said lowly in Tony’s ear as he leaned down, leading him to the exit and carefully dodging all the conversations that were thrown his way. True to his word, Buck was already seated inside the limo when they arrived and gently pulled tony inside and sat him on his lap as the tears that were threatening to spill over finally overflowed, shushing and rocking him through the back aching sobs that ripping their way through the man.
“Look at him, he wants this so badly, the little slut,” Bucky snickers, “Look at how he’s just gagging for it.”
“Yes, yes, yes, please”, Tony mewls, hips thrusting up in small, aborted movements, trying to get friction he knew he wasn’t going to get for at least a little while.
“I was just thinking about last night”, Bucky said in that husky, dominant voice, and Tony’s throat decided that it would be fun to close on itself, making him choke midway on his second sip of coffee.
Everything will be fine, Tony though as he snuggled deeper into the covers, heated by his two supersoldier boyfriends.
“Hey, doll. Did you have a good sleep?” Bucky drawled looking at Tony’s sleep-mussed hair and rumpled dress shirt from last night.
And of course, what did he expect? Their comments were near all the same each time, describing how Howard would have done this better and oh how they missed him because he was such a good person. Tony tried to not give a rat’s ass about what senile, old, middle-aged white men thought about his inventions but when they compared him next to his father, that’s when the dam broke. In the end, even though Tony tried his hardest to keep an even face and smile when it was appropriate, he’d had enough. Silent tears were pooling in his eyes, trying not to spill over. The men seemingly paid no attention to him as they laughed and chattered on about Howard, but it was the two people he treasured the most that noticed his growing unease.
“Mmmmm”, Tony wouldn’t actually be bothered to form words.
Tony was so relieved that his super soldiers were not angry or disappointed at him. As Bucky petted him, Tony realized how tired he was. His mind finally went quiet and stopped screaming at him in frustration and all the tension leaked out of his once tense muscles, especially with the way Bucky was massaging his back.
They were found piled on top of each other in the morning when Steve woke up to an empty bed and cold sheets, ready for his morning run with Sam. Assuming that Bucky went to the gym early and Tony was still holed up in his lab from the freak out last, Steve considered canceling with Sam and attempting to break the door to Tony’s lab, again.
Bucky could see the stress leaking out of Tony’s face and body as he let out a long-held breath and almost fell into Bucky’s arms. Snuggling his head into the crook of Bucky’s neck and shoulder, and pushing his frozen feet under Bucky’s sweat pants-clad thighs, seeking warmth.
“Mhmm yeah”.
It wasn’t until their legs were tangled up beneath the sheets, chests flushed with the post-orgasmic bliss, murmuring endearments of love to each other Tony had realized they weren’t angry at him in the first place, just worried for him. Feeling love bloom open in his chest, spilling ver his body, tony turned up to look at Bucky and Steve, thanking them silently for the love, support and the everythingness they give to him.
"Base, this is Lieutenant Rogers. Be advised, I'm checking out what appears to be a rogue aircraft that's on a direct course for the mountain power plant. Any info you could give me on this would be greatly appreciated."
"Copy that, Cap."
"Um… I've always kinda wondered… did it hurt? When you got your serum procedure?"
He squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in deeply through his nose before turning to Hammer, squaring his shoulders.
, Steve thought fondly. Peter's advice back when he first discovered Steve's pining for Tony had been invaluable in pushing him to ask Tony out for their first date, and he knew Peter's encouragement to Tony had been just as helpful.
Tony was relieved to find that the hospital in Atlanta had already been security checked and cleared by the time they arrived, with Happy personally standing guard outside of the cordoned-off treatment room while Helen examined Steve. Steve was unconscious, the result of another dose of Helen's super-soldier pain medication that she gave him right before they landed. He had been trying to just bear through the pain, and even tried to convince Tony that he didn't need it, but thankfully Tony was able to get him to change his mind. He was in such bad shape that Helen couldn't even examine him while awake without risk of causing further injury, so she'd instead busied herself with tending to Peter's minor injuries during the flight, which turned out to be not much more than a few cuts and a lot of bruises, all of which had already started to heal.
"All right," Steve said. He opened the office door, offering Tony his arm. "Shall we?"
Maybe even Ned, and some of his family.
"Hey, now!" Peter exclaimed. "That's kinda low, don't you think?"
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"All right, sweetheart," Steve said as he slowly eased the throttle forward. "Let's see what you got."
"Captain!" Sharon exclaimed as he arrived on the paediatric ward, waving at him from her computer station. "You're back again already? Usually we don't see you here more than a couple of times a week?"
"As you were," Phillips announced with a rather impatient wave of his hand. As soon as everyone was seated again he stepped forward, his hands clasped together in front of him as he scanned across the assembled group of pilots.
"Yeah, I think you're right," Tony whispered once Peter had done it again two more times. "You wore the kid out, honey."
"Yeah, I know it," answered Steve. He took a single step, whimpering at the pain in his burned feet as Tony's arm tightened around him.
“Really?  I was gone for like, three minutes!” he exclaimed as Tony rolled his eyes.  “Good grief!”
Which he knew for Peter was even worse than the truth.
"Nah, it's okay. But hey, could you send me another one of those videos of your fish when you get home? I like 'em, they're really relaxing."
Sam sniffed as he nodded. "Yeah. I can—I can do that. Thank you." He clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder, squeezing it gently. "Take it easy for awhile, okay, Cap? No sense in pushing yourself before you're ready."
"Oh. That's too bad," Steve said.
Steve shook his head, his teary eyes locked on his family's picture.
"Yes, I'm well aware of how that came about, Captain," said Davis, not missing a beat. "And as to the question of adding more members—"
Huffing out a sharp breath, Tony exited the lab and padded into the kitchen.  It was lunchtime, or somewhere thereabouts, and one thing that he’d promised Steve before he left was that he would try to eat regular meals while he was gone.  Of course, to that end, Steve had made sure to stock the fridge and freezer with plenty of easy-to-make things, including more of the homemade bagels that Tony had come to love almost as much as the man himself.  Retrieving one of the sesame seed variety out of the freezer, Tony popped it into the toaster, pouring himself a fresh cup of coffee while the kitchen slowly filled with the scent of toasting deliciousness.  After smearing each half with a generous portion of cream cheese, Tony carried his makeshift lunch back to the lab, where he quickly became engrossed in one of his newest suit designs as he ate, thankfully remembering to wipe the stray bits of cream cheese from the corners of his mouth just as JARVIS announced that the Board of Directors were on the line.
“Oh Christ, bud, I—”  Tony broke off, his eyes flicking to Peter’s splinted finger, propped up on his extra pillows.  “Pete, I can’t.  Not—not after… I need this weekend to think, okay?  About a lot of things.”
"Yep," Tony said, rather sharply. If Carol had already heard that meant that Rhodey probably had as well, which was just fucking
I going to do with you?" he asked as he pulled Tony inside their grand master suite. He peeled the star from his chest, tossing it onto a chair as Tony worked to rid them both of their undersuits, finally shoving him towards the bathroom as soon as they were naked.
Steven Grant Rogers.
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats as Tony clung to his hand, barely daring to breathe. Finally, Steve looked right at him, his blue eyes determined.
“No, I’m fine,” Papa said, his voice laced with the fear he was trying so hard to hide.  He had agreed to volunteer for this test way back when Dad first told them about it, and hadn’t wavered at all in that conviction during the months of research and development that Dad had poured into the project.  One he had named Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing.
"Mmmhmm?" Tony murmured as he kissed that spot again, smirking when Steve let out a shudder. "You say something, honey?"
They remained in the auditorium until the very end of the credits, neither of them wanting the date to be over. As they slowly got to their feet, Peter was just about to ask if they could head over to the coffee shop for some hot chocolate when Gwen's phone buzzed with a text from her father, asking when she would be home.
"No, not really," Peter replied, breathing a slight sigh of relief as his locker popped open. He shoved his backpack and jacket inside, pulling out the books he needed for his first three classes. "I'd love to forget about all of it, actually, but I don't think that's possible anymore."
Steve. The man his son called, Papa.
Fresh anguish welled up inside Tony as he imagined his poor husband stuck down on Earth, no doubt worried sick about him and Peter all while fighting against the Chitauri and whoever else Thanos had managed to coerce into following his mad ideals.
It was a beautiful autumn day as Steve pulled his pickup truck out of the Tower garage and onto the street, with the cool, crisp air and the brightly shining sun. Peter kept up a running commentary the whole way there, telling Steve and Tony all about the newfangled thing he and his friend Ned were building in Robotics Lab while Tony offered up a few suggestions. Steve loved listening to his two boys discuss their projects. Even though he didn't understand what they were saying half the time, just the mere fact that they were talking about it in the first place gave Steve hope that they could all have some semblance of normality in their otherwise mad lives.
"I'll always be here," Tony said on a moan as Steve tightened his hold, sending bolts of electric pleasure shooting throughout Tony's body. They were pressed so closely together that Tony honestly couldn't tell where he ended and Steve began, with Steve's chest like a hot brand against his back. "Shit, honey, I'm—I'm getting close!"
Peter shrugged. "Whatever you're having will be fine, Papa."
"Steve!" Tony shrieked. "Steve, are you—?"
"I've never flown a more smooth aircraft, Mr Stark. You should be proud," said Steve.
They flew back to New York the following day, with Natasha graciously saving Tony when Mr Harrington asked to sit next to him on the plane. The last thing Tony needed was to have the final remaining threads of his patience completely shredded by Peter's dorky Decathlon coach talking at him the entire flight home.
Raising the container, Pietro leaned in closer, squinting at what was inside, which, if Tony didn't know any better, appeared to be a human, dressed in some kind of goofy Halloween costume.
Peter nibbled on the end of his pencil, thinking. "How 'bout a big tree? You know, the kind that kids like to climb? There's a big one in the backyard of my house that I used to climb all the time before—" He broke off, biting his bottom lip. "Well, when I was little. Didn't you used to climb trees when you were little?"
Not that Tony minds getting a good look at Steve’s chest, of course, or any other part of him.  Especially since the thigh-length shorts he’s wearing leave absolutely nothing to the imagination.
Her clinical, no-nonsense words hit Steve like a blast to the chest, and he gasped, groping for Peter's hand under the blanket and squeezing it tight. At the moment he didn't think he could survive it again if that was in fact the case, survive all the weeks of waiting, of physical therapy and tube feedings and begging and pleading with Peter to wake up over and over again.
"Okay, so why don't we just pretend for a second that you're not beating yourself up about it, and just tell me what JARVIS found?"
"I know that, honey, but the rest of it… sometimes I wonder if the very fact that our team is also our family makes it even worse for you when things go wrong." Tony paused, swallowing hard. "Like when Bucky fell from the train? It hit you so hard because he was your best friend, someone you thought that you loved, where if it would've been Morita or Dugan or any of the other men under your command you still would've mourned him, but not quite in the same way."
"Definitely wouldn't put it past 'em," Tony answered bitterly. "It's very, very unlikely that someone would find out about it, but still…"
Tony thought as Peter pushed the stretcher out of the building, loading it into the medical chopper.
"Yes," answered Tattooed Guy. "One of his children was supposed to bring the Time Stone to this place.  It is Thanos’ home planet."
"It's okay, buddy," Tony choked out. "You're—you're okay, just—"
"Denting your locker door because you're in perfect control of yourself?" Gwen said, raising an eyebrow. She reached a hand up to cup Peter's cheek, turning his face to meet her eyes. "It's just an interview, Peter. For a summer internship that my father might not even allow me to take. Let's not make it anything more than what it is, okay?"
"Looks like they were doing some kind of research here," Tony said as his helmet retracted, his brown eyes scanning the various machines. "All this stuff's written in Russian, babe."
It was a good thing Steve knew the route between the hospital and the base as well as he did, because driving with Tony practically plastered to his back was so intoxicating that Steve almost felt like he was drunk, something he had never before experienced. The Project Rebirth serum had made it such that he was unable to get drunk on conventional alcoholic beverages, and before the serum he had always been too sick to want to indulge in anything more than the occasional sip or two. He'd barely pulled into his barracks parking spot and cut the bike's engine before Tony was grabbing his hand and practically dragging him towards the door, with the two of them barely making it inside his room before Tony's hands were on him, sliding underneath his t-shirt.
"Yeah, I can start wearing them."
movie he watched with Peter not too long after the Battle of New York, when the heroes were attacking the space station through a barrage of cannon fire.
"What? You—you mean, he's not at the Tower?"
"Smooshy?" Steve asked, laughing. "What does that mean?"
A particularly loud
“Shit!  That’s hot!” he hissed as he shook the scalding droplets from his fingers, sucking his middle finger into his mouth.
Which only made Tony even more determined. Because if there were other versions of him and Steve out there who had also just gotten their son back, Tony felt like he owed it to them to try and help.
"Goddamnit, I don't give a
Peter pressed his palms to his cheeks, trying to cool himself down. He couldn't remember being this flushed since before his enhancements started. "Yeah, and now I'm sorry that I said anything."
"Yeah, yeah, and I'm a cradle-robber. I get it."
"Give me ten percent, J, yeah? Let's not scare the boys on the first test."
Tony thought.
Steve shifted slightly on his feet, hooking his thumbs into his belt loops.  “You know, I could tell that the moment you walked in,” he said.  “There've been quite a few people who have come in just to poke around a bit, probably out of curiosity more than anything, but I could tell you weren't one of those people.  There's a certain look in someone’s eyes who truly loves books, and, well… I could see that in you.”
, Tony. And as soon as Captain Rogers and Captain Danvers get back from their mission, the entire world will know as well."
And, more time find Steve and Peter and get them the hell out of there.
"Yeah, bud. Okay."
" said Tony.
Peter had barely finished chewing the final bite of his cupcake when his phone beeped, indicating that it was time for him to jump off the truck. Tightening his backpack straps, Peter pulled his hood up over his head, sucked in a deep breath, and jumped, rolling as he hit the spongy grassy median to avoid injury just like Papa had taught him. He shot to his feet before he even came to a complete stop, running across the highway and heading for the nearest boat launch. It was still very early in the morning, around 4am, and there wouldn't be any boats leaving for Jekyll Island for about three more hours, so Peter was hoping to find a public bathroom or some other small building where he could curl up and catch a bit of sleep before the first boat left. Once he arrived on Jekyll Island, Peter was hoping against hope that the forecasted early morning fog would be thick enough to hide his presence as he flew towards the island prison building.
“Mmm,” Tony murmured, his body almost dead weight in Steve’s arms. “S’ good.”
Because while the Superhero Registration Act may have been defeated, Steve knew that there was no way HYDRA was just going to roll over and die. There would be something else, some new loophole or regulation, and if the incident up at the Compound was any indication, it would be happening sooner rather than later.
don't take him from me now!"
look that Tony shot him was so genuine and funny that Steve immediately burst out laughing.
" Gamora sneered. "How does it feel to have your grand master plan thwarted, hmm?"
"That was my plan, sweetheart."
"Okay, I think we can dispense with the history lesson," Tony said sharply. "Just tell us what you found."
Which was basically code for, 'Phillips wants to make absolutely sure that the condition of the two remaining space-faring aircraft is as good as it can possibly be'.

"Very good, sir," said JARVIS. "And may I presume that I am to use the definition of mortal danger that you and Captain Rogers have established, rather than Master Peter's?"
"Yeah. I guess I'd just like him to get to see some of it."
"Not now, Pete," Tony said. He stopped as he arrived at what appeared to be the massive steering contraption, shooting Peter a side-eye. "Let's just figure this out, yeah?"
"Aw, yeah!" Tony heard Rocket, the goofy raccoon, exclaim from the ground. "Now that's what I call an entrance!"
Steve simply had to assume that they were okay. Otherwise, there would be no way he'd be able to lead the team through what they'd likely be facing once they arrived in Wakanda.
“Why don't you go ahead and get dressed, Peter, then we can head back to the conference room,” Mr Rogers says.
Tony pressed their foreheads together, cupping Steve's face in his hands. "You know I'm not trying to nag you, babe, 'cause you know I just don't do that. But honey, we gotta do something about this." He paused, pressing a soft kiss to Steve's forehead. "This demon of yours seems to be of the particularly vile type, and I'm starting to think that it's not one you can fight on your own."
Steve thought.
Well, there wasn't anything he could do about it now. Hopefully he didn't smell like he'd worn the same clothes for the last two days.
Steve gave a nod, setting down the tablet and locking eyes with Tony, who shot him that little half-smirk that he reserved only for Steve. "Then let's go. Tony, Sam, whenever you're ready."
As promised, this chapter opens in Peter’s POV.  I hope you enjoy!  💕
Steve had been so distraught with guilt the previous night that it had nearly crushed him, the weight of it squeezing all the air from his lungs until he was gasping for breath. Tony had done his best to soothe him, holding him so he could hear his heart beating beneath the faint scar marking his chest. Tony had confessed to Steve a few times that he'd always hated his scar, believing it to be hideously ugly, a loathing that only grew after Peter's diagnosis.
"Would you like anything?" the general asked, gesturing towards a display of various drinks. "Water? Superwater? Whisky?"
Gritting his teeth, Peter pushed himself up to his feet, scanning along the outside wall for a door or a window he could sneak through and letting out a small "whoo!" when he spotted one about ten metres up from the ground. He launched another web, aiming it just below the window and immediately flattening himself against the wall as yet another sentry suit flew by. As soon as it was gone he planted his feet, bracing himself against the wall as he attempted to pry open the window, which was far thicker and stronger than it had initially looked.
“Thanks for doing this, Buck,” he murmured as he clapped his friend on the back.  “I know it’s not easy for you.”

"Good day, Mr Stark," a voice suddenly said, one that caused Tony to gasp so loudly that he flinched. "How may I be of assistance?"
Tony did at least get the chance to speak to Peter a few times per day, and was even able to link Peter in to talk to Steve twice, the changes in Peter's tone and energy level obvious after only a minute or so. Peter loved his papa immensely, and Tony adored the preciousness of their relationship.
"Just stay just like that," Peter said as he slowly swung his legs over the side of his bed, taking care not to get tangled up in the numerous wires and tubes attached to his skinny body. His notebook and most of his bedding hit the floor as he inched closer to the edge, pausing once he was there to suck in a deep breath, the all-too familiar sound of rattling lungs nearly making Steve's skin crawl.
“Dad, seriously, you don't have to worry about whether or not Steve likes you,” Peter said as they stepped onto the penthouse elevator.  “All you need to do is not screw things up.”
A short pause followed, one in which Tony could just imagine the worry wrinkle forming between Steve's eyebrows.
you! You're my
“Wow,” Dad said, only a bit distractedly.  “I bet that made your entire day, hmm?”
"Okay… um… would you mind doing it again, JARVIS? And go the other way this time?" As a scientist, Peter knew that an experiment couldn't be counted as a success or a failure unless it was repeatable, and he wanted to make absolutely sure that he hadn't just missed something.
"Yes," Wanda whispered. "They only let him out when they need him to do something for them. And they always use the words first, so he never even remembers what he's done afterwards." She paused, chomping down hard on her bottom lip. "But for some reason, I can always remember what I've done, which is why—" Another tear streaked its way down her cheek. "It's why your papa is afraid of me now. Whenever he sees me, he's terrified. I can see it in his eyes."
"That's right, hot stuff," Tony said, over and over as Steve shuddered and trembled, their interlaced fingers still curled around Tony's cock. "Fuck, you're just so gorgeous when you let go!"
All of which meant that the missile’s design had to be finalised as soon as possible so they
He had just opened his mouth to attempt to speak when Sam came over the comm.
Steve flinched, burrowing further into Tony's neck. "I know you're right. I just really, really wish that you weren't."
“Hmph,” Peter said as Tony helped him stand up.  “Somehow I doubt it.”
No wonder it was so dark.
"Can you
"Does that conclude your questions for Captain Rogers, Senator?" he asked.
Which, Peter realised a few seconds later, was probably exactly what the absolute weasel that was Justin Hammer was thinking.
"Well, I won't tell him if you don't." Steve tipped his head back against Tony's shoulder, beyond grateful that it didn't seem like he'd aggravated his still-healing ribs. He had gotten so used to his body's enhanced healing factor that having to wait for something to heal had hit him harder than he'd expected. Steve had never enjoyed waiting for anything, and that didn't combine well with his usual tendency to push himself.
Dad opened his mouth to protest, but whatever he was going to say died as soon as he looked at Steve. "All right, fine. But you better warn her that Howard's a pretty mean drunk and that he doesn't like strangers, so—"
And there, in their luxurious shower, for the next thirty or so minutes Steve showed Tony just how precious he was to him, and how much he loved him, bringing him to climax twice by the time they were too waterlogged to continue. Not to be outdone, Tony then ordered JARVIS to initiate the sauna setting in their bathroom before pushing Steve onto the wide bench lining the wall of the shower so he could suck him off for the third time, leaving Steve so wobbly by the time he was done that he could barely walk. He only managed to regain some measure of strength when JARVIS sternly announced that Sam had been waiting for him in the kitchen for the last fifteen minutes, and that Colonel Rhodes had just arrived from D.C.
"I see," said Ms Sharon as she set down his tray, prepping her stethoscope. "Well, your heart rate is still a bit higher than usual, so I'm just going to keep a closer eye on it today, okay?" She patted the top of Peter's head, looking down at him with that pitying look that he abhorred. Peter knew she'd overheard what that dumb doctor had said too, and he'd already begged her more than once not to say anything to his father. The last thing Peter needed was for Dad to freak out over something that he could do absolutely nothing to prevent.
"It is my theory that three of the six infinity stones are currently housed here, on Midgard," said Thor. "One inside Loki's sceptre, one inside the tesseract, which is currently in the possession of New Asgard, and the third in Wakanda."
“What?  Why?” Tony exclaimed.  “You already have people on the ground there!”
I hope you enjoy!
This night, they were on a schedule, and Steve was never, ever late.
"Hey, Captain," Tony said as he got to his feet.
Steve shook his head, his arms tightening around Tony's waist. "I'm sorry, mo grá. I just… I think that was the first time that I realised how far gone I was. How much I loved you. I remember I was in my room trying to draw when you landed outside on the landing pad, and then when I came into the kitchen and saw you all bruised up and bleeding all over yourself, I just—and you were so casual about it, like getting knocked out of the sky by a fighter jet was just another day at the office or something, and I couldn't understand how you couldn't see how important you were to me, and—"
Tony's eyebrows knitted together. "What do you mean by that?"
Steve's eyes flicked over to the red, white, and blue shield propped up against the wall right next to their bedroom door. Tony had offered many times to build him a stand or something to hook it on when Steve wasn't using it, but Steve always refused. He'd told Tony that during the war he had always stored the shield right by the door—when he was actually able to sleep in a building, that is—and, like everything else about Steve, old habits apparently died hard.
Tony stopped him with a hand on his arm, his upper lip curling into a sneer. "Honey, it can't be fixed. This guy attacked Pete, and now he's gonna die for it."
“Tony,” he says, so softly that he’s surprised Tony can even hear him.  He reaches for Tony’s shoulder, curling his fingers into his first at the last second.  “Tony, I—I’m—”
"Damnit," Tony muttered. "All right, then I need you to get a hold of George Stacy right now and ask him to pick up both Pete and Gwen inside the entrance to the museum. Give him the Cliff's Notes, just enough so that he knows what's going on. Then let Pete know that Stacy's on his way, and tell him to wait there at the museum with Gwen until he picks them up. Tell Stacy to take the kids back to the penthouse and wait there until they hear from us."
"Yeah, it was pretty quiet today," said Steve. "Actually, it was almost a bit too quiet. Like we were just up there for a joyride or something. I was only engaged by the enemy once, and both Major Lorne and Cam Mitchell told me that they never even got a glimpse of their mirrors."
And Bruce, clomping his way over to them in the badly-damaged Veronica armour.
Steve’s eyebrows shot up.  “You’re sure?  Even for that price?”
Then again, knowing Phillips like he does—or at least used to—Steve figures he’ll be watching anyway, the very same scowl on his face that Steve couldn’t forget in a million years.
"The rest of the time it's just frustrating," Steve answered matter-of-factly. "And I just try and deal with it, just like any other husband or parent would." He looked down at Tony's hand, tracing his wedding ring with his thumb as his blue eyes filled with tears. "But we need to figure out what to do about this, 'cause we can't let Peter do that again, Tony, we just can't, and it's not just because we can't let him be Spider-Man while he's still a child. I'm afraid—I'm afraid if something like what happened happens again, that we won't be able to get him back. That we'll lose him, and—"
Thor shouted as he began running across the plain engulfed in blinding-white lightning bolts, his words filling Steve with the very same awe that he'd felt on that day, when he'd believed that now that Thor had arrived, the Avengers' victory was assured.
"Forgive me if I am being presumptuous, Captain, but I do not believe that screaming in your sleep and destroying yet another set of bed linens would qualify as 'fine'," said JARVIS. "In fact, if it were Mr Stark displaying such alarming behaviour, I do believe that you would encourage him to seek help, as you have encouraged Master Peter to seek help."
"All right, then," Tony said, pursing his lips as he took after one of the suits trying to escape back through the hole in the roof. Tony ducked down, coming up directly underneath it and activating his laser just as they both exited the bunker to an unexpected flash of bright sunlight. Tony winced, distracted by the light just long enough to allow the Hammer suit time to swing around and knock him between the shoulder blades with one of their Chitauri grenade thingys.
"Uhh," Steve stammered, his heart seizing in his chest as he looked over at Natasha, who appeared to be just as shocked as he felt. "Um… can you explain a bit more about what you mean? Fix all of this… how?"
"Ohh, Hank's not gonna like that," warned Lang. "No offence, but I don't think he likes SHIELD very much."
"Absolutely," Steve murmured. "And I'll even carry you to bed afterwards, if that's what you want."
“Yeah, yeah, okay bud.”
"Oh, yeah," Peter said, glowering down at the zipper that had somehow forgotten to zip itself. He drew it up to his neck, ducking down inside the collar of the down parka as Papa opened the doors and a blast of arctic air hit Peter right in the face.
None of the leads that he and Bruce had managed to find in the HYDRA documents had amounted to anything, and while Natasha and Clint were already planning raids on a few newly uncovered coastal HYDRA strongholds, Tony wasn't holding out much hope that Steve would be found in any of them.
"Yes, I'm sure," Steve said as he got to his feet. "Are you hungry for some breakfast?"
He paused then, bouncing on his feet, his expression so boyishly eager that Tony almost chuckled.
He had tried. He really had. For his son's sake, Tony really had tried to get the ship into the best shape that he could. Had made a concerted effort to try and get home.
"Okay, Bruce, I understand," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "But first I need you to tell me what happened. Where's Thor?"
“All right, Peter.  Can you show me your front crawl, please?” Mr Rogers asks.
Peter breathed in, biting down hard on his bottom lip.  This was the question he’d been waiting for.
"It's okay, Tony," Steve assured him, even as his own belly swooped in fear. His eyes were trained on Thanos, his blood boiling at the triumphant smile plastered across the ugly purple brute's face as he drove his hand down into the ground, reaching for the stone.
And he enjoyed it even less when said news was reporting on whatever goofy space phenomena had occurred over Africa. Ever since he'd stumbled upon an entire space-faring army just waiting to invade Earth during his emergency missile flight through Loki's portal, Tony had adamantly decided that he had seen all he'd needed of space, thank you very much.
"Yeah, yeah, something like that." Dad pushed himself up to his feet, clearing his throat as he looked at Peter. "How in the hell did you get to be so handsome, hmm? Weren't you only about yay big about a month or so ago?"
"Will you call me tonight?" she asked. "Please?"
"Yeah, well, before you I thought the only halfway decent pilots were Rhodey and Carol, so I think we've both learned a thing or two." Tony tilted his head, brushing a soft kiss across Steve's lips. While the rain hadn't slowed down at all, the sky had grown almost completely dark just in the last few minutes, which meant that the nightly curfew would be starting soon. "Is it okay if we finish this conversation once we get back? It's getting pretty close to Pete's bedtime, and—"
"So… that probably means that—"
"Ah, Tony?" he said, jerking his head towards Bucky, who was panting like he'd just run a marathon. "We good here now?"
"And especially since they seem to be the product of that HYDRA scientist we still haven't identified," agreed Steve. He tipped his head forward, pressing his lips against Tony's forehead as his right arm wound around Tony's waist, drawing him flush against him. "At least now we know, sweetheart."
"I don't know, Tony," Papa said warily. "Does he really seem like someone that we need to be worried about?"
“All right,” Dad said, rather reluctantly.  “Long as you don't forget to remind me.”
After staying in long enough that it would likely take a week for his fingers and toes to de-prune, Tony reluctantly shut off the water and blotted himself dry, his face twisting into a fierce scowl as his eyes trailed down the six-inch scar littering the centre of his chest, his semi-peaceful feeling all but evaporating into the cloud of steam rising above his head. He tried so hard to put its existence out of his mind that every single time he had to see it again it was as though he'd been slapped in the face with a brick.
Peter had just opened his mouth to reply when the girl turned her head, looking back at Peter and Ned. Peter's cheeks flushed hot as he locked eyes with her, and he gave her a very awkward smile, flushing even deeper when she smiled back.
There still lies the question of
"Well, I'll say it as often as you need me to, okay?" Papa said. He kissed Peter's forehead again, tucking his blankets up to his shoulders. "And I might have something else that'll help you sleep too. I'll be right back."
When the bullies had finally won.
position.
"Perfect," Tony whispered. He tapped Steve's shoulder twice. "Roll onto your back for me, yeah?"
A loud
"I'll make sure that he doesn't," said Sam. "I'll send a signal once we're in the air."
“Nope, don't you even try to tell me that it doesn't mean anything,” Peter cuts in.  “Especially when I have never, not once, ever seen you look at
And while the optimistic part of Steve tried to focus more on the "if", the more pragmatic part of him knew that it was more likely to be "when", and that he needed to plan as such.
"No, of course not," Sam said with a playful scowl. "But see, if it happened to be the other way round, then you'd be all mopey and pouty with your hangdog look, and—"
And then on Monday, Steve was going back to his store.  Despite his realisation that he’d needed the break from it to focus on beginning his recovery, Steve had missed it terribly, and was very much looking forward to getting back to it.
"Uh huh."
"I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but there's two Safety Officers outside waiting to escort you to the Air Corps base."
The Siberian bunker had also had stasis pods, which had housed the other Winter Soldiers.
But Steve absolutely loved Tony's scar, and told him so every chance that he got. He loved how it was a physical reminder of Tony's resilience and tenacity. Tony had told Steve that he'd almost died during his surgery when the power plant was destroyed and the whole country went dark, and yet somehow, against nearly overwhelming odds, he managed to survive.
"Pete," Dad said, and Peter's heart gave a lurch when his voice broke. "Please, bud, try and get some sleep, yeah? You know Papa wouldn't want you to be stressing yourself out like this."
"Shh," Tony said as he trailed his fingers across Steve's full lips. "Steve, I've been stuck living in my father's house my whole life, so this—" he glanced quickly around the room, also noticing that Steve had hung a few of what looked like his own drawings on the walls. "This… this is perfect.
Peter had been Steve's anchor after he came out of the ice, the one person he knew he could count on to help him navigate his way into the twenty-first century. He had taught Steve everything, from how to use the stove and microwave, to how to grocery shop—and how to pay for said groceries—and the elaborate computer systems and telephones. Without Peter to guide him, Steve would've been completely and utterly lost.
As they flew directly over the rippling area Steve began to squirm, trying to escape Tony's vice-like grip. But Tony held him tight, refusing to budge.
"Ah, that sounds great," Sam said as he took a seat at the end of a long table. "No offence to the Wakandan's hospitality or anything, but I'm ready to get home."
With Steve, Tony felt like maybe he was just a bit more like Peter than himself.
Closing his eyes, Tony felt Steve's lips press against the top of his head, whispering a soft, "It's okay, sweetheart. I've got you."
“Well, you’d sure be a damn sorry one if you were,” Tony says softly.  “No offence, honey, but you're not looking too good.”
"But then you remembered that this was your first date in like, ever, and freaked out, right?" Bucky asked. He patted Steve on the back, grinning slyly. "It's okay, Steve. It happens to the best of us."
"Please, don't think like that," Steve murmured as he brushed his thumb across Tony's nipple, earning a gasp in response. "Tá tú chomh taibhseach, agus tá an oiread sin grá agam duit."
"Peter!" Steve cried. "Little guy, you have to listen to me! These people are going to hurt you, you have to find Dad and get away from here!"
"Yeah, I figured," said Sam. "Just let me know. It's playoff time, so it should be a good game."
"I made sure JARVIS has a continuous lock on his phone too, honey, so he'll be fine." Tony said gently. "He's with three of our team members, they're not gonna let anything happen to him."
"Flare at your eleven, Rogers!" shouted Major Lorne. "It's another huge one and it's coming right at you!"
"So, you take it easy now, bud, you hear me?" Tony said to Peter. "Don't be worrying about anything besides getting stronger."
"I'm thinking I should give you another neck and shoulder rub once we get home," Tony murmured. "You seemed to like it the last time."
"We're asking so much of them, Tony," Steve had said as he'd held Tony in his arms after making love the night before. "We're asking them to potentially give up their freedom, their livelihood, even their lives, and yet—"
the opposing team.
With a heavy sigh, Steve gripped the handlebars and started the bike, trying to push the unpleasant thoughts from his mind.
"Well… this whole movie date thing reminded me of it. Something that George Stacy said to Pete that night he was was over at their house."
"Sounds to me like someone's a bit jealous," Sam said out of the corner of his mouth, followed immediately by a loud whoop as the leadoff Washington batter's bat connected with a fastball, bouncing towards the right-field corner for a double.
"Let's get started."
"I will indeed." Uncle Thor gave a nod, looking around at the various team members all standing around him. "My friends, until we meet again, I bid you all farewell."
"You think he tried to fight this thing on his own?" Steve asked, agast. He licked his lips as he glanced down at their unconscious son, his mind a whirl of conflicting emotions. "But… Tony,
"The estimated time would double, sir."
"Tony?" Rhodey asked, gently, but with just enough oomph for Tony to know that he meant business. If he hadn't been in the middle of the worst crisis of his life he might've even laughed at Rhodey's tone, the very same that he used to use back during their university days when he was trying to convince Tony to actually do his homework.
Away from memory fragments that still haunted his dreams, and had transformed his papa from Captain America into a fragile, frightened shell of his former self.
. Apparently this one warranted it. Kate’s face had turned white. The news popped up on the television, and they could see the bright colored lettering of
“Scarlet Witch did,” Steve pointed out. “Billy does.”
Kate bit her tongue to keep from laughing, but she could see Francis grinning at her from the corner of her eye. It seemed they weren’t the only ones getting impatient, though, as Kate saw their Natasha shift where she stood, crossing her arms.
“Your leg is—?” Kate began, finally turning her gaze fully to him, one brow raised. But she followed

Steve walked out of the hospital and just kept walking.

“Yeah,” he agreed. And then their lips were sealed together and for a moment, there was nothing but
“Don’t hurt yourself. You need your hands for things.”
“Lucky’s the Bartons’ dog.”
“Yes?” Tony prompted, walking over to his tablet in anticipation of such a request.
“I,” Kate said, then chewed on her lip, having no idea what she wanted to say at all.
“Mmm. Mmhm,” she said. She swallowed. “Not bad.” She put the wrap back on the plate. She was back to watching him. Steve felt his blush heat up again.
“No. And this one’s going to be a tough one for you to swallow, Peter, so I want you to listen carefully:
. And it meant so much to me. He kept adding charms—I got one for winning the science fair at school which Dad hadn’t acknowledged, I got another when it was time to leave home and start life at MIT, and another when I earned my first doctorate. Jarvis gave me this one—“ Tony reached out and touched the bracelet, landing on a little charm of an angel with wings, “—when my parents died. But I realized yesterday that I’ve never given
“Bad calls can cost lives. You acting like you know what’s best when really you’re just fumbling around out there like the rest of us—“
They were all in the locker rooms, washing off now, largely in weighted silence. It all made Steve’s stomach roil. He felt like he had failed the team as a tactician, as their leader, but how were they even supposed to fight other super-powered people? Aliens? Fine. Steve had gotten used to aliens. A few powered people here and there? Yes, the Avengers had dealt with individuals before. But a highly trained team of super powered people? They hadn’t stood a chance. Even though Steve knew that the team
Kate thought she had never heard a sweeter sound than Peter’s voice in that moment. She wondered if she ever would, or if that would remain forever as the single best auditory input she’d ever experienced.
“Not exactly. But we know for certain it isn’t AIM. They claim no association. They seem to be as baffled as we are—and a bit pissed off, since they’ll be taking the blame for this, naturally. I wouldn’t believe them except that the tech that they have seems to advanced for AIM. And they’ve got no reason to be going after the likes of you—if they’d be targeting anyone, it would be

“Hey Katie-Kate,” James said with a tiny smile.
“Are you certain about that?” she asked.
“The—James’ old room in the tower, the one with the racecar bed—” he said, and Tony took off. Steve fumbled in his pocket for his comm. system, which he never went far without. He put it in his ear.
“Then it’s decided. You’re our New York task force for the time being,” the Commander said, rising. “God help you.” The other 3490 Avengers rose with him, and they quickly vacated with just a few brief goodbyes to their children. Natasha continued to sip her coffee as she watched them leave. If they were handing over the defense of New York City to a bunch of green children and inexperienced Avengers, then either they were certain nothing major was about to happen, or they were certain that worse things were about to happen elsewhere.

“He took the frozen macaroni and cheese,” Antonella commented in wonder.
She looked to Natasha and to Clint. Well, twenty, they could handle. She steeled herself, reaching for her next arrow, when she felt another great tremble.
“Kid’s got guts and a temper,” Steve said, not fully disagreeing. “And some problems. Chip on his shoulder.”
“Likewise,” Clint said, still utterly creeped out. It was a strange enough experience, having two Steves or two Tonys around all the time, but it was something else having another

“What was it like? Everything?” Kate asked. It was a question she had never really had the courage to ask her actual father. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. As a curious and precocious child, the moment that her parents had explained about the strange life circumstances surrounding Steve Rogers, she had asked plenty of questions.
“Hey,” Kate replied, staring down the shaft of an arrow with incredibly scrutiny, looking for some minute flaw Peter did not comprehend. She tossed it in the rejects pile.
definitely having a rougher time of it today. ‘Cause I told him.”
“I was informed twenty minutes ago that we would be relocating to New York City,” she said. “Did you know about this?”
Now standing at the central console was Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Maria Hill, Clint Barton, Natasha Romanov, Thor, Jane Foster, Pepper Potts, and one other. Were it not for the final person, Tony might have thought that she had done her calculations wrong, that the energy had pulled people from different corners of the world—but the last person made it a dead giveaway that her calculations were indeed correct. Standing next to Clint was Tony Stark—only Tony Stark was a man. Tony, still standing next to Matthews’ desk, drinking her coffee, raked her eyes over the man.
“I can’t believe you go to sleep at ten. You’re such an old man,” Kate said, stripping the covers from his body. James thought briefly that it was a good thing he didn’t sleep naked. Kate for her part was dressed in a tiny blue skirt and an off the shoulder black top. They were definitely not pajamas.

,” Jane argued, impassioned. “If we leave who even knows if they’ll help us when we get back? And besides, while we’re here I can use their equipment to confirm the scientific conclusions they’ve presented to us. It might not help with motivations, but if they’re lying that would certainly tell us something. And while we’re here I can piece together their equipment and the science behind it so that we can

. I had a dangerous job and insane business hours. I didn’t sleep for days, was practically on a caffeine drip, and still deeply craving a drink. I wasn’t fit to be a mother. I knew that. I told Steve I was pregnant—and I was a sobbing mess when I did it—and then told him I was making an appointment at the clinic and that would be the end of it.” Antonella looked at Tony. It always startled Tony, how her eyes were the same exact shade and shape of his own. If one could look at eyes alone, they would never be able to tell the two of them apart. Tony thought, erroneously, of the old saying, of eyes being “windows to the soul”. He shook the thought away as soon as it occurred.
“Are there a lot of…super humans?” Other Steve asked, his eyebrows creasing together. Tony recognized that particular expression—eyes slightly far in the distant, eyebrows together—it was Steve’s ‘processing the new world’ face, and Tony hadn’t seen it in years. Tony cocked her head to one side, examining the Captain.
—” Kate was in the middle of raging when a loud alarm sounded through the building. It was almost deafening, like a fire alarm but somehow even more urgent. Francis, Torrun, and Kate all knew what it was at once.
“Put him down,” Peter said, shouting it this time, “
paid off; thankfully evasive and offensive moves came to her as a second nature now. That was good since Kate wasn’t thinking anymore.
“New Universe Order?” Natasha asked. “Does he have the ability to do that?”
“And we can only work in the here and now,” Commander Rogers said firmly. “Which is why we have a plan of attack. You all need to stay protected and as hidden as possible. It was obvious they wanted your Rogers, which could mean that yes, he’s who they want, or that they were trying to distract us and get the real prize, whomever that might be.”
let alone five minutes, but that’s all she’d said—‘give me five minutes’. Five minutes were almost up. Steve stood in a corner trying to get used to the different dimensions and heft of the spare shield Kate had handed him. There were many things in the lab Tony wanted to take a closer look at, but Kate had threatened him with bodily harm if he moved from his spot next to her. Tony had no doubt that she could and would indeed follow through on that threat.
“Christ, Peter, who pissed in your coffee?” Kate finally demanded. She entered his room, unwelcome, uninvited, and sat on his bed where Peter currently lay, throwing a ball up to the ceiling and then catching it on its way down. Lather, rinse, repeat.
“What did you
The dining room table had somehow been elongated and more chairs and been added than Steve cared to count. Even with all that space, Steve knew that there was an almost equally large table set up in the kitchen that was the ‘kids’ table’. Kate had put up decorations with the help of 3490 Steve. Steve had almost expected a catering company to bring food to the table—after all, how could they possibly cook for that many people, many with super metabolisms?—but as people filtered in, Steve realized that everyone was tasked with bringing something along, often a multiple of something already there (later, during dinner, the Avengers would good naturally fight over who got to eat Jan’s mashed potatoes (infinitely superior to Reed’s), or who got a slice of the pumpkin pie that Kate had cooked with her father, which was better than Logan’s store-bought contribution).
“No? Boyfriend? We’re all about equal opportunity here at Stark Industries,” Stark said.
“Of course. We’re teammates. I’m always going to have your back, Tony,” Steve replied.
“Kate? Sweetheart?” he’d prompted her.
“It was my job to make sure she knew. I didn’t always—I didn’t always do that job as well as I should have.
“And it’s—it’s not

“I deserved that,” Dad answered quietly. “I know we need to talk—all of us—about what happened, everything that happened. I wish I had more time—”

conveniently in a bedroom…” Francis huffed a laugh and pushed her shoulders back, putting at least a foot of distance between them.
“Look for a drain, an air duct—anything leading into the lower levels,” Kate ordered. Alt Steve was already clearly looking around the building, but her own father was just standing there. Staring. “Dad! Come on!” He didn’t move. He didn’t seem to hear her.
“We don’t have time for this!” Tony snapped as the armor overtook her. The faceplate locked over her just as she finished speaking. Her husband hopped onto some handholds on the back of the suit, and before Steve could voice another objection, they were in the air and gone. Steve ran back inside.
“Brought you something,” Torrun said. James moved the pillow off his head. He had deep circles under his eyes, which were red from lack of sleep. He took the plate Torrun offered.
The hell was he supposed to do with
“Hey, if there’s one thing I’m good at,” Alt Tony said with a grin that quickly disappeared. “Seriously though you should probably get checked out. Who knows what kind of strain your body is going through right now?” Peter jammed his hands in his pockets.
“So, it was practicality,” he said.
“And yet I still came,” Steve said. He was dressed in blacks slacks and a simple Christmas sweater. Christmas sweaters were standard attire for the party. Some years they made it a contest to see who could find the most hideous one of all. Tony had won one year—she’d found a sweater with a Christmas tree on the front which lit up with full Christmas lights. If you squeezed one of the ornaments at the bottom, it would play

had. It seemed not to be a consideration. It looked like 199999 weren’t the only ones underestimating Kate Rogers.
“Brilliant scientist. Scatterbrained though. And he has powers of elasticity which are—well, they’re useful but frankly a little disturbing to see sometimes. You get used to it, though. Sort of. He’s our go-to guy for time travel, alternate universes and the like. I’m sure you’ll meet him at some point,” Bruce said. “He’s also in the Fantastic Four, another superhero team around here.”
“Could it have to do with the serum?” Steve asked. He looked so young compared the Commander. James, seated nearby, just looked like his younger brother. It was odd. “Is mine different than yours?”
“I—it looks like it. He’s not down there,” Steve said apologetically. He was worried she was going to start crying again. She’d been crying steadily, quietly all day, and Steve had no idea what to do about it. Nobody else did, either. Steve had seen Francis try to give her a hug earlier and she’d just wailed and shoved him away. The crying, though, that worried him less than the quiet did, the quiet that had consumed Peter, had drained him of everything else. He’d been quiet all day, and Steve hadn’t been able to tell if it was grief or glaze or rage. Considering what had just happened, Steve figured it was all three. He knew that feeling. He knew feeling all of those at once while sitting alone in a bombed out pub in London, except there had been an added component: guilt. Then again, Steve knew Peter felt that too, over the man he’d killed on the streets.
“Negative, Senator Stark. I receive my orders from Director Fury. I have been commanded to take the night shift,” Steve said. Senator Stark made a face and rolled his eyes.

“I know,” James said. He turned to her and smiled. “Thank you for the present, Tony. It really—it means a lot.”
“They don’t need to hear it,” James insisted. Dad just nodded.

“Of course because of today,” Steve said. “Tony…they could have gotten all of us killed, themselves included. It’s not
Steve ran hot with realization of what was going on and his dick snug between Tony’s boxer clad asscheeks began plumping up in his sweats at the thought.
Steve then laid down next the Tony rubbing his arms and pressing his chest against Tony’s back.
He mumbled something against the skin of his neck but Steve couldn’t make out the words.
Tony jerked violently against him and Steve tightened his hold on Tony’s waist to let him know that he should move. The stretch of the skin was a burning him slightly but it felt so good. Steve let his head knock back against the headboard and clenched down overwhelmed by the feeling.
Once they got used to the feeling, he urged Tony on to quicken his pace. He felt as if his skin was oversensitive and with every drag of Tony’s cock he falling deeper into inexorable pleasure.
He could feel the base of Tony’s cock head catch the base on his own cock head under the foreskin which trapped them in an inescapable grip and he was drowning in the delicious friction.
“You’re not telling me because you were dreaming about something that we haven’t already tried? I already told you I am willing to try almost anything once before deciding it isn’t for me. I promise I won’t kink shame.”
“I miss when you would become shy about me bringing up your tits. I feel it should be illegal for you to say that without blushing like a virgin. Also your tits are not all that I dream about.”
“I heard you. Now are you gonna help me or do I have to do all the work by myself?”
Steve nodded and took a deep breath to prepare for what was about to go down. Seeing Tony nervous made him nervous but he trusted Tony to not hurt him. Steve was a virgin before he was with Tony and he trusted him then with his firsts and trusted him now with his new experiences.
Reaching for the lube again he pinned Steve a look to ask him if he can add another finger and Steve nodded helplessly. It felt weird but a good weird. No one had touched him like that before and he didn’t know was to expect but he was happy to find that there was a pleasant buzz under his skin and he wanted more of it.
“Have I told you how much I love your cock?” Tony asked nuzzling the said cock with his nose. He placed soft kisses against the base of his cock and balls.
“Tony, doll, you’re only dreaming. We are both okay. We are safe.” Steve said in between the kisses he was placing against the side of Tony’s face.
Tony barked a laugh at that.
“Were you dreaming about sucking me off? How generous of you Tony. Even in you sleep- Unghhh.”
“I know you like the beard burn. Don’t even bother lying about it. I don’t remember you making faces at me the last time I ate you out.”
He didn’t know what Tony was talking about but he tried to stay still since he didn’t want to be left alone to deal with his hard on.
He felt Tony snuggling up and felt his stomach jump under his hands while trying to soothe Tony.
He woke up with a start when Steve bit down on him shoulder and began moaning at the realization of getting caught.
“You wanna fuck my cock? Like grind against it?” Steve heard him but didn’t understand any better. They do this all the time, why would Tony have to be so reluctant to ask him this.
“Look at this Steve. Look at my cock disappear under your skin.” Tony panted against Steve’s mouth.
Tony nodded and climbed onto Steve straddling his hips. They kissed deep and slow. Tony descended Steve’s body, kissing and nipping at all the skin available on his way down. He paused when he reached the band of Steve’s shorts and moved out of the way to allow Steve to take of his shorts and underwear.
Steve looked at Tony’s face to find him staring at their cocks as if he’s unable to look away. He looked wrecked and was slightly trembling. Steve knew he must be close to finishing and wanted to watch him come under his foreskin. The visual that was sent to his brain along with that thought was so breathtaking and he knew he had to hold back to let Tony come first.
Tony confessed to feeling jealous about the kind of bond that Steve had with Bucky. Steve shut him up with a kiss and they tried to be more civil and understanding of each other since. Tony asked Steve out after he got everything sorted with Bucky and the rest was history.
Tony reached of the lube against and poured into his palm and waited for it to warm up. He looked up to find Steve grinning at him.
“Steve look at me. Look at me fingering your cock. It’s so tight and wet here baby. I can’t wait to put it in. God look at you, mewling for it. You’re so fucking gorgeous. I’m so lucky to be the only one who gets to see you like this. I love your cock so much. It’s perfect for me. I’m gonna get a mould of your cock and make a dildo out of it so I can fuck myself when you’re away on missions. Nothing else compares you know. I wish I was nice enough to share it with everyone. People would love to know what it feels like to be filled up by the National Treasure that is your dick huh. Even if they get only the dildo version, they wouldn’t ever be able to get satisfied by anything else. I won’t even be able to share the dildo with anyone because I’m selfish like that. I love knowing that I’m the only one who is blessed with this opportunity. I love you so much. All of you. I hope we have enough time together to make you believe every word I say.”
“Don’t move Steve. Just stay put and let me.”
“I can’t just put it in. Let me doing it. Just tell me if it hurts or we need to stop at any point. Otherwise sit back and relax.”
The sketchbook was a bday gift from Tony last year half filled with sketches of his everyday life. Pictures of Clint hanging from the vents, Natasha cleaning her guns sitting on the common room floor, Bucky drooling on Sam’s shoulder and his hand wrapped around his waist during a team movie night, Bruce stirring a pot of curry with a towel over his shoulder and Tony. Tony sitting in the pilot seat of the quinjet, sleep mussed and nodding off over his breakfast, scolding Dum-E for knocking over his coffee, butt naked and hair dripping wet from the shower. Steve smiled to himself rubbing his thumb nail against the spine of the book to feel the letters SGR engraved there, as he looked at his sketches, skipping to the one he was drawing of the bird sitting in the ledge of his and Tony’s bedroom.
Steve snaked his hands to the front of Tony’s boxers that’s trapped behind the pillow to find the tip of his cock wet with precome. He started peppering kisses on Tony’s shoulders while rutting against Tony’s perfect ass.
They hadn’t discussed this before but how Tony always knew the right things to say puzzled him. He also would always tell Steve that he was an open book and should work more on his poker face so he ddint try too hard reading into Tony’s mindreading abilities.
Steve’s breath picked up soon after and he was rock hard in his hands, precome was beading out of the tip liberally.
“Not bad. Just trying to get used to it.”
Tony didn’t bother with a response. Instead he opened the cap of the lube and poured it onto Steve’s cock who hissed when the cold lube touched the heated skin of his cock head. He poured some onto his palm and took himself into his hand while his other hand was stroking Steve.
He pointedly ignored Steve and spread the lube between his fingers and took a hold of Steve’s cock and pumped it slowly and massaged the foreskin and his cockhead with his thumb.
“Did you even hear what I said?”
“Are you really having a sex dream right now? What are we doing that’s got you so horny that you’re shamelessly humping your pillow. Hmmm.”
Tony ignored him and licked around the head and sucked it into his mouth and pulled off, repeating the motion several times. He kept a steady hold of his cock in one hand while he was using the other to hold his waist.
Steve leaned over to touch the back of his hand to Tony’s forehead to find it cool to touch. He then thought Tony might be having a nightmare. Both Tony and Steve had issues falling asleep and attended online therapy sessions twice a week separately to talk about their PTSD. But their insomnia streak came to an end shortly after Steve moved into Tony’s floor when they got together.
“Stv plis” Tony mumbled into his pillow. Steve could barely make out the words.
“Are you going to move your hand at all or are you gonna keep teasing me?”
“You wanna show me instead?”
“I have to agree that while it is a million dollar idea, your genius boyfriend did not come up with the act of docking.”
“Can you repeat that for me sweetheart?” Steve said while placing kisses on the top of Tony’s head.
Steve wiped his hand onto the sheets knowing that it would be getting dirtier as the morning progressed and will need to be washed anyway. Tony was trying to clear the white spots swimming in his vision and bringing his heart rate down while panting.
His body received a lot of attention from friends and strangers alike. It’s not that it bothered him too much or he didn’t hear such comments before (people were now more open about what’s on their mind and exercise their freedom of expression to its full extent, rude is culturally relative he had learnt).
Tony then slowly inserted the tip of his index finger in between the folded skin and the smooth skin of his head to touch parts of Steve that never got the attention before. Steve was trying not to squirm too much and let Tony take care of him.
“Who said I was talking about that? I was referring to your idea of commercializing a mould of my cock to be sold as a dildo.”
Steve kept whispering sweet nothing against Tony’s hair and pumped and squeezed Tony’s cock till he was shaking and came suddenly when he felt Steve’s other hand cupping his sensitive balls and pull.
He laid he head on Steve’s shoulders and kept tugging at both their dicks at a slow pace. Steve wrapped one hand around Tony’s shoulder and carded his fingers through the hair at the back of his head with the other.
Steve began to worry that he might be ill. Tony didn’t take really good care of his body and would forget to sleep or consume anything that wasn’t coffee for a few days till one of the members found him and dragged him by the collar to the kitchen to eat something or to the pullout couch in the lab for a nap.
“You make sure to tell me that atleast once a week. So yeah, I guess I know.”
“Are you embarrassed? You know you can fuck my tits whenever you want to right? We can use the new watermelon scented lube we got.”
“Oh yeah? What else are you dreaming about? My ass? You dreaming about fucking me into the bed?”
Tony moved his hand upward to get the foreskin to close up head of his cock leaving only the shiny tip visible. He started kitty licking the opening at the head. He kept at it as jerked of his cock and finally took the cock till it he felt it at the back of his throat and rhythmically bobbing his head and sucking while jerking his hand.
Tony ran his index and finger along the foreskin gathered at the top of his cockhead and rolled some of it between his thumb and index finger slightly squeezing the skin and soothing it while using his other hand to keep a hold of the shaft.
He had been waiting for the perfect time to take a revenge for all the times Tony would wake Steve up in the middle of the night while straddling him or taking his soft cock in his mouth and hope Steve would wake up horny and fuck him silly before they could sleep again. Tony would joke about how he simply couldn’t fall asleep without Steve’s come in his ass and Steve would spend the rest of the day blushing.
“This belong to me you hear. Only me.” He emphasized while giving his cock a tighter squeeze. Steve weakly nodded unable to do much else.
century. He didn’t have enough time to think about it before he went in the ice as he was busy fighting in a war and saving his country.
“Yes of course.”
Steve could only nod. He held onto Tony’s hips with one hand and bunched the sheet in the other.
Tony finally looked up at Steve with big brown eyes. “Promise?”
He felt especially insecure about his cock because it also increased in size after the serum. He knew he was well above the average size but he didn’t know how to put it to good use to please another person and if it might hurt them along with his super soldier strength. Luckily Tony happened to be an expert in all things super soldier. Tony had a made a comment about how he’d never been with someone as big  or with someone with an uncut cock trying to appease Steve saying they were both trying things for the first time. It kind of helped Steve then and it was never an issue.
He couldn’t come up with anytime Tony was this shy. Not even when he asked Steve out for the first time. Tony had come to stay up with Steve in the medical wing to stay with Buck as he recovered in the tower after the Incident with Zemo trying to bring back the Winter Soldier after the fiasco with the accords. He apologized how it had gone down between them and how he should’ve trusted Steve. He couldn’t promise that it wouldn’t happen again but Steve knew it would be fair to ask that of him.
He was loosening the skin while circling the tip of his finger along the circumference of the head slipping in deeper each time.
“Sit up against the headboard.” Tony instructed while he rolled over the bed to reach the night stand for lube. Steve pushed a pillow behind his back and sat up to make himself comfortable.
“Steve...” Tony whimpered and he leaned down to take Tony’s bottom lip in his mouth and kiss him sweet and slow. When their lips partly with a wet pop, Tony leaned down to place his head on Steve’s shoulders and tucked him face into his neck. He removed his hands from their cocks and moved closer to hug Steve careful not to touch the pillow or Steve’s back with his wet hands.
Tony pressed his chin down on Steve’s sternum and rubbed his scruff against him. Steve wrinkled his nose at him.
“You didn’t give me what I was dreaming about. Make it up to me by giving me what I want.”
“Yeah till you decided to wake me up.”
Steve chuckled and held Tony’s face with both his hands and pulled him in for a kiss. He sucked and bit on Tony’s bottom lip and felt him tremble in his arms as he sucked on his tongue. Tony didn’t pull back and kept chasing Steve’s lips when he pulled away to let Tony come up for air. He kept shifting in his lap and was trying to grind their cocks together. He didn’t mean for the kiss to become as heated but glad to find that Tony was still turned on and the sexed up mood wasn’t gone.
"I didn't ask for any of your questions," snapped Phillips. "Just do what I say."
Peter grinned, barely stifling a cough. "Yeah. They're… well, they're—"
"I still think the files should be the priority," Steve said after a short pause, thankfully sounding more like himself. "JARVIS, can you just take over the server duties for the time being?"
Steve gasped as he jerked awake, chest heaving and covered in a cold sweat as his eyes flitted around the room, trying to get his bearings. His surroundings didn't look the HYDRA prison where he'd been kept, it looked more like—
Steve's jaw twitched and his brow furrowed, relaxing slightly when Tony patted his knee. "Director Fury explained that the Strategic Science Reserve had become the organisation known as SHIELD, and since I was a member of the SSR when I went down, that meant that I was an employee of SHIELD after I was found."
Stepping into the shower, Steve turned up the water as hot as it would go, trying to chase away all of the ice crystals coursing through his veins. He squeezed his eyes closed as the burning hot droplets pelted his skin like a thousand tiny pokers, trying to rid his mind of the image of his son, his beloved boy, not knowing who he was as he beat him senseless.
"Uhh, does someone wanna tell me what the hell's going on here?" Tony said warily. "In my son's hospital room? At his bedtime?"
"You're a… what?"
"God, baby, you're just so fucking gorgeous!" Tony rasped, his strokes already losing their rhythm. "I wanna see you let go for me!"
"Mmm, I guess," Peter said. He popped the remainder of his sandwich into his mouth, washing it down with half a bottle of superwater as Tony met Steve's eyes, giving him a questioning shrug.
"Oh." Tony huffed out a sharp breath, slumping heavily onto the bed. The fact that another highly-regarded Air Corps pilot was encouraging Steve to try and date not only a civilian but a Stark was surprising, and didn't really fit at all with Tony's preconceived notions about pilots.
Tony says into Steve’s chest.  He lets out a hard shiver, burrowing further into Steve’s chest as his teeth start to chatter.  It takes Steve’s muddled mind a couple of minutes before he realises that as far as he could tell, Tony wasn’t shivering until he started holding him.  Which means, if Steve hadn’t said anything when he did, then—
"Oh, yeah! That sounds fun, thanks!" Peter hardly ever turned down an opportunity to hang out with Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky since they were so much fun to be around. The team liked to joke that Dad and Papa often bickered like an old married couple—which was actually the truth—but to Peter Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky were even funnier. Trading insults, bantering about their preferred sports teams, and in general acting like two grumpy old men most of the time usually had Peter laughing so hard that his stomach hurt.
Spooning in another mouthful of pudding, Peter briefly closed his eyes. Dad's phone call that morning had rattled him a lot more than he'd wanted to let on, and he knew he wouldn't be able to really relax again until he and Steve showed up later that evening. He just had to make sure that they were gonna be okay.
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "Yeah, okay, but you get what I mean, right? Papa asked you to marry him because he loves you and he wants to be your husband. It's really not anymore complicated than that."
"Ahh, how 'bout we start with some soup or something like that, hmm?" said Tony. "No sense in having it all come right back up again."
"We're in the endgame now," said Dr Strange. "And if I tell you what happens, it won't happen." Then he let out a heavy sigh, reassuming his
"It did?" Peter asked as he scanned the address label, his belly swooping when noticed that the return address was the dorm Gwen would be staying in at Oxford. "Um… what—?"
And has even started
"Like the universes where you never meet Hank Pym, for example," said Bruce. "Or where the Chitauri don't attack New York. Things like that."
position he had been in while he was messing around with the Time Stone. "But I really don't think that—"
"You mean, the rest of your classmates are still learning it, right, Pete?" Dad said. "'Cause I'm pretty sure you had the whole scientific method thing down pat by the time you were four."
"Soon as he gets the stone," Steve added. A bolt of pain shot across the knuckles on his right hand, forcing him to slowly flex his fingers. "We have to wait until he gets the stone."
“Oh, yeah!” Peter says, a bit too quickly for Tony’s taste.  “I’ve been sayin’ that for forever now!”
"Yes sir, I understand," Joseph answered as he sharply banked right, swerving around until he had once again manoeuvred directly behind the unknown aircraft.
"Oh, always, sir," JARVIS stated.
"Information from me would not be secondhand, and you know it," Steve said through clenched teeth, his jaw twitching madly. Tony could tell he was trying hard to hold back his temper. "I just don't think it's worth putting you through this when it's not necessary."
He wondered how long it would be before one of them decided to act on their feelings, since from Steve's perspective, Sam was just as smitten.
"That's because I'm not," answered Steve. "I'm actually a pilot with the Langaran Air Corps."
Sucking in a deep breath, Steve glanced over at T'Challa, whose expression hadn't wavered in the slightest. If anything, he appeared even more determined to defend his home.
And if that wasn't the weirdest part, Strange's head was also twitching from side to side, almost like he was having a violent seizure.
Steve was quiet for several minutes, until Tony worried that he'd actually pushed him too far when he finally lifted his head, cupping Tony's cheek.
As it turned out, though, based on what Tony could glean during dinner, Sarah didn't so much hate Howard personally, he just made a very convenient scapegoat for her to blame for the abrupt death of her husband.
"I will." He kissed Steve softly on the lips. "Be back in a few minutes."
"I'm sure you'll figure it out soon enough," Peter muttered as he headed down the hallway, already tugging his shirt and undershirt over his head to reveal his Spider-Man suit. As soon as he stepped outside he hid his clothes behind the a/c unit and reached behind his neck, unfolding his mask and pulling it on. After losing at least three of his masks over the summer, Dad had finally decided to just sew the thing onto the back of his suit, which offered a bit of extra padding around his neck when it wasn't in use.
"You are in Wakanda now, and the Soul Stone belongs to us," added T'Challa. "Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood."
"Well, I suppose I could give it a look-see," Tony said. "I'm sure Bruce and I could figure out some way to jury-rig it into flying again. But there's no way I'm leaving here until we know that Pete's gonna be okay, and since we don't know how long that's gonna be—"
“Um, are you sure?” Pepper asked.  “You know I don't usually leave until you—”
Tony looked up at him in shock. "Hell no! He's too busy being a moody teenager, remember? Right now twenty-five sounds positively ancient to him."
"As soon as possible," Steve agreed. He pulled back, resting his forehead against Tony's. "We're ready, mo grá. We've been training for this for weeks, and we're ready. We can do this."
"All right," Tony said. "JARVIS?"
"Ah, yep," said Lang. "That—that's exactly why. Hank didn't really explain all of it to me. Just enough for me to know what to do."
"Well, that's what you get for letting Pym walk away in the first place," Tony said, rather smugly. "Just blame it on Howard and you'll be fine."
Slowly, Peter rolled onto his side, careful to keep his IV lines from kinking or tangling as he tried to get comfortable enough to sleep. The doctors had been telling him he should try to sleep propped up since it was easier on his lungs, but he'd never been able to get comfy like that. He rubbed at his sore nose, sucking in a rattling breath as he closed his eyes, a soft smile stretching across his lips.
Tipping his head back against the chair, Steve closed his eyes, trying like hell to make some sense of what had happened. He and Tony had returned to the penthouse only moments before, and were still undressing each other when JARVIS announced that the Compound was under attack. Steve's head still ached from the mental whiplash of going from such all-encompassing desire to such immediate terror and panic in less than a split-second's time, an experience he had no desire to ever,
"I haven't thought of a good enough name for it yet, naming stuff always gives me trouble, so I've just been calling it MAUDE in my project notes," Beck began. "But basically what I've done here is combine these holographic generating glasses with an old drug that I found in the Stark Industries archives, and voila. We have a cutting-edge holographic system that allows the user to imagine any number of possible scenarios in any possible location."
"Um… are my dads still awake?"
“You had a bad dream, honey.”  Tony pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s forehead, his fingertips gliding up and down Steve’s spine.  “A pretty lousy one, from the sounds of it.”
It didn't help that Dad and Papa had just kind of glossed over a lot of what had happened during the year—
Deep down, Steve knows Natasha is right.  That just because one guy turned out to be a controlling, narcissistic asshole doesn't mean that all of them are.  And, based on the limited interactions Steve had with Tony Stark yesterday, the man definitely did
"Captain Rogers, how close were you to dying up there in space?"
It was
"You mean all of us, right?" he said carefully. "The whole team?"
He would push aside his own pain and grief and try and focus on others, just like he always did. Just like people would expect from Captain America.
After depositing some clothes and a new pair of shoes outside Scott's door, Steve hurried back to his own suite to find Tony awake and propped up on the bed, reading on his tablet. He looked up as Steve entered, raising a curious eyebrow.
"This isn't your fault, Steve," he said firmly. "If anything, it's—"
And it was up to him to do so, as arrogant as it may have sounded. After both SHIELD and the government allowed HYDRA to grow undetected to the point where they nearly attained unmatchable power, there was no one who Steve could trust to help outside of his team.
"All right, I think we've got everything where it needs to be," Steve said as he emerged from the training dome's breaker room. "The breakers are all set, and the emergency generators are on standby."
"But there was no reason given, other than the fact that it was old and likely expired," protested Beck. "And I thought you of all people would appreciate me trying to use our own resources rather than have to develop something completely new. You know, saving the company money and all?"
"My people?" Quill said with a slight chuckle.
"Yeah, he's hanging in there," said Tony. "He's tough as nails, that kid, even if he doesn't look it. He's gonna pull through."
"What, another drive?" asked Bucky. "C'mon, Steve! We're all in an awesome mood and it's gorgeous outside! What better time to play some ball!"
"Colonel Phillips deemed it too dangerous for you and Peter to know," explained Sharon. "He wanted for you to be able to maintain deniability for as long as possible. As soon as the colonel got word of Peter's impending admission, he made sure that I was assigned to him."
It was just as incredible as he had imagined.
"Mmm. Don't want you to go," Tony murmured a few minutes later, once he felt capable of speech. His eyelids were so heavy he could barely keep them open, and his limbs still felt leaden, like they'd been filled with wet sand.
"Hmph. Or a weird uncle thing," Peter muttered.
Which he was.  The evidence of which was now sitting in about a thousand ripped-up pieces scattered across Tony’s desk.
Steve’s cracked, stinging lips curl into a smile.  “Well, I think he’s pretty awesome too.  But at the moment, I’m a bit more interested in what you think of me.”
"Yeah, I guess I did," he said softly. "'Cause it's the truth."
All of which meant that Peter hadn't even worked up the courage to kiss her yet. Or even tell her that he really,
"The hell I'm not!" Steve shouted back. "Tony, we can't let him drown, we need to save him!"
Steve gulped, gripping Tony's hand as he gave a brief nod. "You're right. So, what should we do with this information?"
But Tony only shook his head, guiding Peter carefully towards the door, his round cheeks wet with falling tears.
you tonight! He needed you, and you weren't fucking there!"
"You'll call if you need anything, right? You know I won't mind coming back up here if you need me," Papa said. Peter bit his lip at how nervous Papa looked, almost as if he was afraid to let Peter out of his sight.
"Yeah, it's about—" Steve started, choking on the rest when he realised he'd almost said too much. "Yeah, it's—it's somewhere underground. King T'Challa believes it's not too far from the palace, but—"
It was horrible, is what it was. And also something that the Air Corps flat-out denounced, clinging to the notion that it was clearly impossible to feel anything in a non-existent limb. Peter had heard Uncle Sam on the phone just the other day, begging the physical therapist that he'd hired to help Uncle Bucky to come up with something, anything to help him with the pain that he felt every single night, as soon as the lights went out.
"That is affirmative, Captain."
They were always better together. Even when things were bad.
"Yeah, he's the best," said Tony. "He always said that trying to keep me in line during our time at university was one of the hardest things he's ever done."
"Hey!" Peter said as his heart gave a joyous leap, his smile threatening to split his face. "You—you guys really came! Together!"
Despite the late hour, Tony managed to find a parking place only a half a block away.  He adjusted his glasses as he stepped out onto the street, trying to ignore the fact that he’d felt compelled to make sure that his hair wasn't a complete mess while getting ready to leave the office.
They sat in a semi-comfortable silence until Papa's truck pulled up, with Dad jumping out of the passenger side almost before it came to a complete stop, a very worried look on his face.
"I will indeed, sir."
"No, not right now. I still have to pee."
"Ah, yep," answered Tony, his voice shaking ever-so-slightly. "And unless I manage to find the steering wheel in the next six seconds or so, I'm thinking I'm gonna be here awhile."
"Oh, hell
It was also one of the main reasons why Tony had never been brave enough to invite a male date to an event.
"Ah, that's a yes," Tony said as he tapped the hologram back into place. "Just remember to keep the schematics of the chopper handy when you're rendering, yeah? Don't wanna get it built and then realise it won't fit, 'cause that would just be embarrassing."
"Oh, you know how Bucky is," Steve said with what he hoped was a playful shrug.
"Oh c'mon, Tones, you know I only bring out my humour on special occasions," said Uncle James, who was wearing his fancy dress uniform too. "There's no humour allowed in the Air Corps."
"Ah, my HUD's registering eight, plus the two reserve built into each of my gauntlets," answered Rhodey. "You think that's gonna be enough?"
Tony suddenly thought, pressing his palm to his chest, over his nanite case.
"I see," answered Gwen. "Well, most of the girls are talking about how hot the Avengers are, so I'm sure they're gonna be interested to hear your opinion."
"Well, no one's ever gonna accuse you of being a good liar," Sam said, grinning. "Which is not a bad thing, let me just say. But anyway, it's not unusual for a soldier's mind to blend different battles together, Steve. I know it's happened to you before."
"No, not this time," answered Peter, barely suppressing a cough. "I'm drawing the big tree from our backyard."
“Oh, get off it, Obie!” Tony retorted.  “You know damn well that Pete’s not just any kid.  He’s the heir to this whole goddamn company, which means—”
"What?" Steve cried, bolting upright on his bed. "Colonel what's going on here? You promised me that Peter would be safe!"
Bruce made a weird, choked-off sound in the back of this throat. "Steve, I don't—I don't think—"
When no reply came from the stunned god, Steve tried again.
“Thanks, Agent Fury,” Tony said as he shook Fury’s hand.  “I’m sure you’ll be in touch?”
But the truth of the matter was, Tony
"JARVIS wouldn't've put you through if you were," Tony said, even as he slipped his hand behind Steve to pinch his ass, chuckling when Steve flinched and shot him a glare.
"Yes, I know you don't," Steve said softly as he curled his arms around Tony's waist. "And I know you're not upset with me personally, but that doesn't mean I'm not still worried about you."
"Has anyone ever told you that you're stubborn as hell?" Tony mumbled, still clinging to his last remaining dregs of consciousness.
But Peter only shook his head, his eyes narrowing even further as he grabbed Steve by the scruff of his ragged t-shirt, yanking him to his feet and slamming him up against the back wall. A sharp cry tore from Steve's jagged throat as he landed on his injured foot, and he bit down hard on his bottom lip as he struggled to meet his son's eyes.
"You are so fucking sexy when you come, baby," he murmured once Steve peeled open his eyes. "God, I've missed you!"
Another shiver raced down Peter's spine, and he suddenly wished that Papa had asked for French fries instead of ice cream. He tried to shake it off, taking a big sip of his float as he tried to figure out what Papa's proclamation meant.
“You're damn right, we do, Agent,” Rhodey said, his eyes twinkling as he smiled at Carol, who Tony had to admit was a very, very attractive young woman.
"And I know Hank will be extremely grateful for your good graces, Cap—Captain Ameri—Steve—I mean, Captain Rogers, but—"
Nebula shrugged. "Because following the Chitauri's failed invasion, Thanos saw the Avengers as a true threat to his plan."
“Oh, yeah.  Sure,” Tony says, turning his gaze downward.  “Well… before we left on this mission, I had JARVIS download all of the files he could find on the Tesseract, and… according to what I’ve been able to find, the main theory on how the thing works is that it functions as sort of a doorway between universes.”
Shuri nodded as she laid the dripping cloth across the worst of Tony's burns, Steve's heart nearly cracking in two when Tony let out a long, agonised groan.
After another furtive glance at the door, Peter clicked open the document and got to work.  All those hours Peter had spent sitting alone at the school before Steve’s bookstore opened up were now starting to pay off as Peter’s very own decryption program, one that he had aptly named Hufflepuff, after his claimed Hogwarts House, got to work.
"The part about you thinking that we can get the gauntlet off Thanos," Gamora said. "I don't think you understand just how powerful Thanos is, so—"
They were quiet for several minutes, with Tony murmuring soft, soothing words and pressing gentle kisses along Steve's forehead and temple until he finally was able to release some of the iron grip on his body and attempt to relax.
“No!” Papa said, bolting upright on the chair like he’d just flipped a switch inside his mind.  “No, I can’t do that!  Sam said that I can’t keep running away from this, so I’m not gonna do it anymore!”  He straightened his shoulders, nodding in Dad’s direction.  “I want to keep going.”
spaceships.
"Well, I guess after his accident, he kinda went nuts trying to find a cure for the nerve damage in his hands. Ended up selling just about everything he owned to try some really weird treatments," said Ned. "And then one day he just up and disappeared. My mom's friend thought he was dead until she saw him again."
With a frustrated sigh, Dr Strange stepped to the side to reveal another man standing behind him, one who caused Steve's belly to drop to his knees.
"Let's get to work!"
Their way that included watching old home videos of Peter, and laughing at his silly toddler and little-kid antics. Of going through his room, and then deciding that they weren't quite ready to do anything with it just yet. Of still occasionally crying, and yelling, and even screaming at the unfairness of it all. At the unfairness of losing so much time that they could've had with him.
Peter's huge brown eyes were glassy as he let out a very junky cough. "Uh huh. But… um… do you think you could do me a quick favour before you go?"
"Yeah, I know," Steve said. "But hasn't the baseball season already started? I thought you and Bucky have already been to a few games."
But, while Brock had a sort of dangerous, closed-off air about him, which is honestly one of the things that attracted Steve to him in the first place, Steve sensed nothing of that sort from Tony.  He was… softer.  More open.
“Uh huh!” Peter says excitedly.  “I can’t wait!”
look that Tony absolutely despised to a curious
"Then we'll just have to make sure that he doesn't get them," Steve said in his Captain's voice. He glanced down at Tony, quirking an eyebrow. "Tony?"
Or at least it would be if the good guys managed to win, which at the moment didn't quite seem like a given.
Peering through the telescope again, Gwen began taking notes, exclaiming a moment later, "Peter! I think I've found it! Oh, it's amazing!" She paused for a moment, tilting her head. "And there's something else up there too. Something that seems to be… moving."
Steve's shoulders sagged, his chin dropping to his chest as his fingers curled around the sketchbook. During the war, he'd managed to lead the Howling Commandos to a final victory over the Red Skull after he had thought Bucky was dead. Even as he had blamed himself for it.
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, and Tony could just picture the worry wrinkle firmly etched between his eyebrows.
A really,
"But we can't," Tony interrupted. He swallowed hard, glancing down at the glasses still in his hand. "Now that we know it works, we just can't." He didn't add that he was even more afraid of what HYDRA would do to Peter if they ever managed to get their hands on him again than he was of Peter using the glasses. It wasn't something that he felt like saying out loud, and knowing Steve, he was probably already thinking the exact same thing.
Peter's phone buzzed in his pocket then, and he pulled it out to find a text from Uncle James, saying that he and Uncle Bucky were waiting for him in the parking lot.
With a single nod, Steve tucked his shield into its corner and settled into the pilot's chair, flipping the various switches as James sat down next to him.
"Pete, how're you feeling?" asked Tony. "Are you in any pain?
Tony sighed, checking the old-fashioned wall clock he’d installed by the doorway at Steve’s request.  While Steve had adjusted well to most of the twenty-first century technology, thanks largely in part to Peter, he still far preferred to use analog devices whenever possible.  Things like non-digital clocks, windup record players instead of MP3s, and compasses instead of fancy GPS devices were just a few examples, and Tony was only too happy to indulge his beloved man in his desires to keep a few familiar things close while he continued to navigate through his new time.
"On your left!" Steve called as he passed the cadets yet again, their awed murmurs spurring him on as he continued his punishing pace. Normally he would've been already done and headed for the showers, but he had built just enough of a buffer into his plan for that morning for one more lap.
"But… Steve," Tony whimpered. "How many times does my boy have to get hurt before I figure this out?"
"Yeah, that is a pretty big mess," Peter agreed, just as the bell rang to signal the end of the lunch period, the shrill noise causing him to jump. He was usually able to brace himself in time, but apparently today he'd been too distracted.
"Uh huh. Thanks for the ice cream."
"See, sweetheart? JARVIS says that Peter's just fine," Steve said. But Tony couldn't believe him. JARVIS had been overridden before, made to give out incorrect information that had led Tony astray, so Tony could not take his word for it now. He had to see Peter for himself.
With a quick glance at Dad, Papa set down his book and shifted slightly on the bed, holding open his free arm.
“You good there, hon?” Dad asked as he started attaching the various leads to Papa’s forehead and chest that would keep track of Papa’s vital signs.  “You need a blanket or a pillow or something?”
“Yeah,” Steve said softly.  In addition to all of the evidence they had uncovered of Stane’s collusion with Hammer Industries and their supplying of the Sokovian insurgents with weapons, Colonel Rhodes had also provided proof that the Army’s very own Deputy Chief of Staff had provided intelligence on the troop movements of the U.S. Special Forces teams to those very same insurgents, painting targets on their backs that were just too good to ignore.
"Ah, the kid worries too much about me," Tony said, rolling his eyes. "And that's your influence, by the way."
"Oh, God!" Steve cried as he slammed the last closet door closed, raking his swollen, throbbing fingers through his sweat-matted hair. "Oh, God, I can't—I just can't do this! I just can't!"
"Have you thought at all about removing the Soul Stone from Wakanda, Your Highness?" Steve asked.
Obie beamed, showing teeth Tony knew cost upwards of five figures a year to maintain.  “See?  Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?”
"If you'd've let me finish, Peter, I could've told you," Steve said. He reached into the inside pocket of his jacket, pulling out a folded set of papers. "Bucky and Sam just got back from that new ski resort out in the mountains that's been on the news lately, so—"
"January 10-11th, 1957," Peter read aloud from his textbook. "Sixty black pastors and civil rights leaders met in Atlanta, Georgia to organise nonviolent protests against racial segregation and discrimination."
The fact that Peter didn't even attempt to argue only proved how tired he was, and once Tony and Steve managed to cajole him through getting into his pyjamas and brushing his teeth, they tucked him into his bed, taking turns kissing him goodnight.
“Right,” Peter says, with a far-too-triumphant smile.  “Steve.”
"Dad!" he said. "Something's gonna happen. I can't—I can't—!"
He gasped again, shaking his head. He couldn't go there. He just couldn't allow himself to spiral down that far, where he might not be able to recover.
He was cut off by the sound of approaching footsteps, and he turned to see Mrs Stacy standing in the doorway. "Dinner's ready," she said with a kind smile. "Gwen, why don't you show your friend where the bathroom is so he can wash his hands?"
Steve felt his jaw tighten and his hands clench into fists. He may not be as smart as either Anthony or Peter Stark, but he did have access to some information and databases that he may be able to use to help them as long as they allowed it. He would have to tread very carefully, for his own sake as well as for Anthony and Peter's. Steve was well-liked by both his immediate superiors in the Air Corps and the government leaders, but he also knew that any regard the government held him in was conditional upon his complete obedience and could be withdrawn at only the slightest provocation.
"I'm real, honey. See?" he said gently, the titanium band etched through with the faint red stripe catching on the single beam of sunlight coming through the hole in the roof. "Do you remember giving me this?"
But then again, knowing the government's inherent bias against civilians, Steve sadly doubted it.
Colonel Phillips smirked. "Mmm, or something like that. In fact, I had one of my intelligence boys pull some files from a Meridian scientific database just a few hours ago. Apparently someone over there—"
"His message states that all perpetrators responsible for the two attacks in Namibia have been accounted for," said JARVIS.
Or both, if he were truly honest.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Scott, it's okay," Steve said, squeezing Tony's knee under the table. "Tony gives nicknames to all our teammates."
"Not everyone has all of the opportunities that you do, Peter," Gwen cut in, giving her economics notebook a particularly hard shove into her backpack. "Some of us actually have to work our butts off in order to get noticed by the big-name colleges that your father probably has in his back pocket."
Something was wrong.
Steve let out a hard shudder, burrowing further into Tony's arms. "I can't imagine it."
A chorus of affirmative mumbles floated up from Natasha, Bucky, and the twins as they all snapped their seatbelts into place. Peter craned his neck as they approached, trying to get a better look, while, despite Steve's assurances, Tony still found himself holding his breath as they approached the dense treetops, letting it out through his teeth as the jet suddenly passed through what appeared to be some kind of protective shield.
Tony's
With a final kiss to the leaking tip of Tony's cock, Steve pulled his fingers out and reached for a spare pillow, sliding it under Tony's hips. Then he crawled up over him, fusing their mouths together as he lined himself up and pushed inside, the two of them groaning in unison once he was fully sheathed.
"I've been ready!" Bucky answered as he shot another war dog right between its eyes, sending its flaming body skidding across the plain. "Let's get these bastards!"

“Did you just fucking blueshell me, Rogers?” Clint demanded.

“But we don’t have reservations,” Pepper said.
“No. Her security is air tight—“
“Pancaaaaaaakes,” and plopped himself violently in the open seat next to 199999 Steve, who looked surprised, though Tony didn’t know if that was because of the manner of his sitting or that he’d sat next to Steve. Steve, Tony noticed, hadn’t said a word all breakfast, despite having been spokesman for the group before they’d arrived at the mansion. He looked contemplative, now. Peter chowed down next to him, shoveling food in his mouth as teenage boys are wont to do. Steve was, it did not escape Tony’s notice, watching 3490 Tony, who was engaged in a lively conversation with Pepper about shoes.
Then, they were on the helicarrier. And every single agent had a gun trained right on them.

“Yeah, our dog that they took with them when they moved.”
“Oh, shut up Sharpe,” Kate snapped. “What harm does it do for him to be in the advanced class instead of with all the little kids in Junior?”
“Thanks,” Steve said, more amused than annoyed.
She turned and looked at him after a few silent moments had passed. “You know what, thank you.”
“Stay with me, Jamie,” Peter begged as his brother’s eyes drooped.
is presumably an alternate universe, unless you are actually the most incompetent skrulls I’ve ever met, and that’s saying something. I’m operating under the generous presumption that you’re just embarrassingly incompetent alts, instead.”
“You’re too hard on him,” Steve heard on a regular basis. He could still see her now, standing before him with her arms crossed and her lips in a hard line that bordered on a frown.
“Fliers, make sure they don’t try to break off and run around the breach,” Steve ordered as the Hulk roared again and the Hydra agents fled with renewed vigor. Plenty of them ran straight through the breach without any further fight. “How long have we got, James?”
wasn’t going to cut it. Just one wouldn’t even give her a buzz. She swiped four, popped them in her mouth, and swallowed before Tudo got back. They’d wait to feel the effects, and then Kate would go back down to the club and party a little harder. It was just a bit of fun.
. The kids of 3490 were tough as nails.
If they both ended up falling asleep together in Kate’s bed, tangled together like they were toddlers again, neither of them mentioned it the following morning.
“No! No, absolutely not,” he said. Antonella just laughed.

. Yet also a bit terrifying. This would be a terrible time for him to lose his powers, and he had no proven way of catching himself if he slipped.
“Kate, that’s not—”
“Yeah. That’s not a condition we’ll share for long,” Tony replied flatly.
“Oh. I guess we—“
“No, we
“Oh, sweet cheeks, you’ll have to do better than that. What, can’t think of any better insults than ‘fuck face’ in that big brain of yours?” James goaded, tousling Peter’s hair in a completely non-affectionate manner. Peter slapped his hand away.
Tony? What the hell is there to explain this time?” Steve demanded.
“I don’t know about you all, but I’m starving. Why don’t we get something to eat and then I’ll show you to the guest rooms?” 3490 Tony suggested. It was strange hearing her voice. It wasn’t low or high for a woman, just an average range, like Pepper. It was melodic, however, and smooth, like she had trained in classical singing before. Tony guessed she probably had, perhaps at mother’s insistence.
“Anything means ‘glass included’, yeah,” Peter said.
“His life is kind of shitty.
“Alternate universe,” Tony said. “We’re from 199999.”
“But they’re

“ETA in five,” other Clint called from the cockpit. “Everybody set?”

and if I wanted to get blackout drunk and sleep away the next week or month or year I was entitled to it—but he stayed and said that if I was going to get blackout drunk, I was going to do it with him there and—well, that ruined it. And I can remember just hitting him on the chest over and over again and crying my eyes out and eventually I guess I stopped hitting him. And he just—stayed. Put me to bed. And that was the end of that. I always figured I’d’ve given myself alcohol poisoning or choked on my own vomit or something if he hadn’t stayed. I guess you’re a testament to the fact that that’s not true,” Antonella mused. “Dunno what that says about me, or my marriage. I’m not sure I want to think about it too much.”
“I…don’t think that would be wise,” Alt Bruce said cautiously. Dad just nodded, understanding.
“I NEED MEDICAL!” James shouted, hoping someone would hear him. He took cover behind a car and set the man down. There was a lot of blood. James ripped the denim fabric off the man’s thigh. His blood ran cold at the sight. James would eat his own uniform if the man hadn’t nicked an artery. He tore the fabric into strips, fashioning a tourniquet around

“It’s a gamble either way,” Steve said. “I like our odds in this safe house better. Besides, if they do have trackers in us, I have to imagine we’ll be in more danger if we try to leave. If they’re playing some kind of game, and we stop playing along, well. I don’t think that will end well.” There was uncomfortable silence for a moment.
“Nope,” he said. Steve frowned, following in behind him. The rest of the team followed his lead, as usual.
“I…” Steve’s brain had mostly shut off. Tony took off his pants, but, thankfully, not his boxers. He moved to the pants and started shaking them out. He did the same to the shirt, and then examined the jacket closely. He looked over to Steve.
“Every
“I think we’ve all seen how overworked they are, even with the size of their team. I think we could go a long way in earning their trust if we could help them out every now and again,” Steve said. “We don’t have to show them everything. We can make non-life-threatening mistakes when we see the opportunity.”
“No problem—oh, we should catch up to the group shouldn’t we? I think they’re leaving—“ Gwen said, and then quickly followed after. Peter followed her lead, and sucked on the injured part of his hand. It hurt like

“Maybe someone planted something,” Steve suggested.
“I didn’t,” Steve said. “Your double did. She was looking for your input on something—you weren’t picking up your phone, so she called Bruce, figured you’d be at the lab with him, but he said you’d left hours ago—she got concerned, tracked you down. I thought she was going to send someone to fetch you, so I offered to come talk to you and make sure you were all right. What?” Tony had gone stiff as a board. He put his hands in his pants pockets, then took them out. He checked his jacket pockets and removed his wallet. He threw a bunch of bills on the bar—more than enough to cover his drink, Steve’s, and the tip.
“If you’re not facing me
