"Yes."
"I'll see you next week, Dr. Watson."
"Yeah. As slow as you want."
"Seriously?"
“Nope.”
"Fine." He rolled his eyes, but held out his hand for the tablets which he popped into his mouth, then accepted the glass of juice with a nod of his head, and drank half of it.
"My dear, that's simple, you wouldn't still be here now, if he didn't. Now, do try to get some rest, your room is made up, it's small, but it's a good room, I think you'll find."
Greg heard the worry in his husband's voice and answered, "I'm fine. I just wanted to hear your voice. It's dead here tonight, I'll be home in a few minutes. I love you."
"He asked how we knew each other," John said abruptly then finished his pint.
"All done," John whispered and he opened his eyes, then reached out to touch John's arm.
"I'm a consulting detective - came up with it when I was a kid - like Lucy from Peanuts? With her little psychiatrist stand? I was eight, still haven't solved that first one yet. So those are some of my old cases, I was trying to write them up, but I don't - I'm not a good storyteller. People usually find me a bit machine like."
"Looks even better off of you, however," Sherlock whispered and drew him back to bed.
John rolled his eyes at him, but replied quietly, "Ask me again when you are feeling better, hmm? Now, I think -" He stopped as he saw a light flash in Sherlock's eyes, then vanish. He cleared his voice then tried again. "I think I can manage helping you to your room, maybe tomorrow, I can return the favor, must drive you round the bend not to be able to wash your hair, been a couple days, hasn't it?"
Sherlock nodded, and finally finding his voice, added, "But only if you stay with me."
"Yeah, I think I could do that," John replied, and smiled as he saw the relief in Sherlock's eyes. "Give me a minute, 'kay?"
"He is a bit lonely, I think, Dr Watson. Though he usually finds the company of others intrusive, from all appearances, he seems to find your presence less irritating than usual." John felt his face heat up, but after she handed him two servings of sticky toffee pudding, she went on, "I'm glad he has at least one friend, Dr Watson, I have found that life is hard enough without doing it all on one's own. I made that because if nothing else, he will always eat his pudding. Now scoot before he starts throwing things again."
"She asked for you," He said to Dee as he gracelessly dropped back onto the world's most uncomfortable chair.
“Six hours. He made it but they aren’t sure of a prognosis yet. About the case, I don’t need to work it - Lestrade can deal with it.”
"You have been getting your hair trimmed here every week for the last two years on Wednesdays at 2PM, ever since you were deactivated, yes?"
Greg shrugged then sighed and closed his eyes as Mycroft ran his long fingers through his silvering hair. "Got a reminder is all. Got reminded. I never shoulda left you, I was -"
"I'm fine."
“That’s good, Doc. I’m glad you were able to find someone, you deserve to be happy.” They stood in silence at the window for a moment until Sherlock broke the silence.
John looked at the ring on his hand and nodded. "Yeah."
"Why?"
"I know."
John looked up at him, and nodded. "Yeah, I make a mean sticky toffee."
"You did all you could do, and you made it home, and I, for one, am so very grateful you did. I'm going to put the kettle on."
John shuddered as he felt tentative fingers in his hair, then slowly opened his eyes to find Sherlock sitting in the chair next to the couch where he had fallen asleep after dinner. "I'm sorry. I -"
"You're hiring me to be a nursemaid."
John sighed and rolled his eyes, looked down at the overflowing plate, then grinned at him. “The case of the ‘League of Redheads’? He’s already named it though I’m not sure it will make it onto the blog. He solved it in less than two minutes; they wrote us a check that will see us through for at least three months, then left. He’s still convinced it was a practical joke.”
“You gonna tell him?”
John heard something in Sherlock's voice that made him back around. "You don't know," he said with a bit of surprise.
"And?"
“It isn’t a question of belief,” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock sighed and ruffled his hair before meeting John's eyes. John drew in a sharp breath when he saw the dark bruise under his eye and gash that had obviously taken more than a few stitches. "Did you never wonder why - the barber shop was a place I could use as look out - banks have been being robbed over the last few years, old fashioned safe crackers - good ones. Took me a little over two years to figure it out, and then, I blew it."
"It's just John. I'm not -"
"John. Oh. Hell. Would you believe a barbering accident? No. I wouldn't either, just put that, hmm - on the desk? Damn. I didn't think he'd actually -"
“Perhaps not, but let’s not leap to conclusions quite yet.”
“Yes, yes of course,” James said with a careless shrug, as if it were already too little, too late. He turned on his heel and walked out of the flat without a backward glance.
"Please."
Mycroft reached out a hand and laid it against Greg's cheek, and searched the deep brown eyes. "I always knew. I knew when you smiled at me and - what's brought all this on?"
"I shouldn't have let her go alone. I had a bad feeling about it, but I thought - she thought she'd be safe, so I trusted her instincts more than my own. She trusts people."
"Yeah. Sure. Good luck to it -" It seemed like there was more she wanted to say, but she closed her mouth, turned on her heel and without another word, flew down the stairs and out the door. John stared after her for a moment, then picked up the ancient file box and went back inside the flat, to find Sherlock had emerged from his meditation, or whatever he called it.
"It wasn't intentionally a date. It was just one evening."
Dee got to her feet then leaned down and kissed his forehead. "Chocolate. And terrible romance novels. Now, go home. I'll see you tomorrow."
Sherlock's eyes flashed warm against the darkness of the room, and John shook his head again. "I left home at seventeen, haven't been back. I would stay with them, in their rooms, I should have known they came from money, but they never asked about my family, so I returned the favor. Never had a reason to ask, wasn't my business." He walked over to a chair and dropped into it, then stretched out his leg.
“Mrs H.”
"No managing was necessary, I think he rather enjoys having an audience."
Sherlock cleared his throat and spoke a bit louder, "I like those fried dumplings." John nodded and couldn't help from smiling. He was so out of practice, and yet it didn't seem to matter as he saw Sherlock's face flush pink before he closed his eyes and nearly lost his balance.
"And you told him what exactly?" Greg asked.
"No. He got a new life after.  Suits him. He's happy. Why would he want to talk about something like that for?"
He leaned in and stole his next words with an awkward, but sweet kiss, and sighed as John's hand settled into his hair and pulled him closer. He sat back after a moment to catch his breath and studied him as if seeing him for the first time all over again. "From the very first moment you walked into the shop and sat down in that chair, you changed me. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I decided that I would do my very best to one day be enough for you."
"Show off."
“John. I'm here, stay with me.”
"Yeah, I need an order for 221 B Baker Street? How long will it be? An hour, yeah, I know, I know, it's your rush time." He gave the order, then ended the call, and his breath caught as he found himself studying Sherlock's lips which had crooked up into a smile; a sweet, unpracticed, but genuine smile. He dropped into the chair next to the couch, then taking his hand carefully, brushed a gentle kiss over his knuckles, cleared his throat again and whispered, "I am interested, Sherlock, very interested, I just want to be sure, I mean - I don't want to hurt you."
"What's me?"
"Why are you sorry?" John asked as he poured out the tea, then sat back in his chair.
"You obviously needed it, so did I. She's out of surgery, and awake, at the moment. Wants to see you."
John had never quite appreciated that silence can have a depth or a mood to it, until that morning. He had experienced the silence of disapproval, heavy and dark; the silence that seemed to crackle the moment before an ambush, but this, a silence of focused concentration, was like breathing rarefied air.
John once again wrapped his arm around him, and more or less half-carried him to the front room, where Mrs Hudson had indeed left dinner for two, including a bottle of wine that had been decanted. Sherlock laughed as John helped arrange the pillows again for his ankle then settled on the chair across from him. "She has taken a liking to you or she's just appreciative that she doesn't have to try to nag at me to -"
John nearly spit out his tea, but somehow managed to swallow without choking on it. “Pardon?”
He yawned, rolled his shoulder, then got to his feet and walked to the door, and opening it a crack, found a woman, arms crossed, glaring back at him. "Yes?"
"It's been a few days since I washed my hair, and it's about to drive me 'round the bend, do you think you could, I mean, if -"
"Please."
John blinked at the shiny, well-scrubbed floor, then rubbed his eyes. “How long did the surgery take?”
"John, John Watson."
"It wasn't your fault."
Sherlock blinked at him, then nodded again, opened the folder and began to mutter to himself. John sat back and watched as he flipped through the pages and after a moment or two dropped it back onto the table in disgust. "The butler did it."
“He wouldn’t want me to know,” John replied quietly. “He destroyed whatever it was that he and his brother couldn’t escape from, and left me the one thing he had kept that reminded him he had once been happy. I don’t think he would want us to investigate further. I think he was hoping - I don’t know - I think he wanted to see me one more time - he knew I was settled, and happy. Two things he was never able to achieve for long.” He pulled his wallet from his pocket, placed the photo inside and replaced it in his pocket. “Let’s go home.”
"Six hours in a waiting room chair at Barts, then three hours on my couch, three more in bed last night. Something is wrong with me."
James shrugged. “Not sure you can, I was just hoping Mr - Sherlock could take a look and see, just see if there was anyway to prove that I wasn’t responsible for Tad’s death. I had heard through the grapevine about him, and then I heard that you were his -?”
“James.”
“The pips? But he was a reasonable man, Sherlock.”
"Do you really believe in true love, John?" Sherlock asked with a yawn.
John frowned at the five orange pips, and turned to look at Sherlock. “What does it mean?”
"Why?"
Sherlock shook his head. "It took us a year to get this far. Don't bother. I'm sure there are some cold files I can take to her and we'll work on those."
Sherlock nodded, then allowed John to help him to his feet and they slowly made their way to Sherlock's room. After John had settled him carefully in the bed, adding pillows where they were needed, Sherlock asked shyly, "Will you mind, staying, just talk to me until I fall asleep? I understand if -"
"Tea, Sherlock, more, DI Watson?"
"That's not true. May I ask, your connection to my brother -"
"I did, I still do sometimes. I don't have anything like this, but it makes a decent sound."
"Which place would that be?"
"Are you sure?"
you are a bit bashed up, more than a bit, and ought to be resting, and I -"
John tried to smile, but failed and Sherlock held his face in his hands and kissed him lightly, then sat back and studied him for a moment. “Let’s go to the house - might be dangerous, up for it?”
John blinked at him, then leaned in closer and kissed him, and he knew the world, his world, their world, for the moment at least, was the only place he wanted to be. “Love you.”
“John.”
“Outside Baker Street.”
"Grandmother, not your mother."
“Please, it will help me to hear it again.”
"Yeah?"
“Go where?” James asked, startled.
"There's nothing toxic in there - at the moment," Sherlock called out, and John heard that nearly covered tremor in his voice. In all the time he had known him, he had never realized - he walked back into the front room and settled back into the chair. He studied the man who tried to meet his gaze, but looked away and studied his one good hand, before he glanced at him again. "I do think I would have told you at some point, that I wasn't quite what I seemed to be."
"It wasn't a date."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but said nothing as he added sugar to his tea, then picked up his cup and breathed in the scent before he blew on it, and took a sip, then set the cup down carefully, and smiled uncertainly at John. "You make me feel the world is still worth saving, and it's been a long time since I've felt that way. And, you -" He paused and eyed the plate of scones. "You make breathing not quite so boring."
“Went to the shops this morning,” came an exhausted voice. “Stay, here? Tomorrow, tomorrow will be better.”
"Thank you, Morstan," John managed to say at last, and the servant gave him a nod and slipped silently from the room.
Mrs Hudson appeared as if by magic, whisking away the plates, but leaving the wine behind. "Don't take him to heart, dear, he's just used to -"
"On the contrary." John waited for him to go on, but he stopped and bit his lip. "I need a bit of assistance -"
Sherlock nodded. “I am certain. I made sure this interview is private. No one else will know what you say here. I promised you would be safe. Please continue.”
“They take after Mum. How did you figure it out?”
John slowly stood up, carried the big pieces of the mug into the kitchen and binned them - he looked around the kitchen and wondered what exactly he was getting himself into, as he realized how little he knew about the man he'd spent so much time with the last couple of years.
John looked into the ever-changing eyes and seeing the truth of his words, walked to the other side of the bed and slipped into the empty space and carefully curled around him. He marveled at how easily they seemed to fit together, as if two pieces of the same puzzle.
"I'm fine."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him, and was caught off guard by the look in John's dark blue eyes. He should say something, but for once words failed him.
“Sherlock -”
"I see nothing."
"I think you'll find, though it's hard to believe at the moment, that I am usually quite indestructible."
John kissed his forehead, then asked quietly, “How do you know?”
"Sherlock?"
"No, it's perfect." The shampoo was worked through slowly, rinsed, then conditioner - he wondered what John thought of his one vanity, at least when it came to his physical appearance, but then John's fingers were in his hair again, and he couldn't care less what John thought at the moment, as long as he kept doing exactly - he sighed as the conditioner was rinsed out and John helped him to sit up.
"John."
John lowered his book, and looked over at the elegant figure who stood at the window. He hadn't spoken in two days, his curls were in disarray, and he hadn't eaten anything but toast with honey since the last case had ended three days previously. John set the book aside, and considered getting up to turn on the kettle, but saw the slender shoulders slump in resignation, and he knew tea wasn't what was needed.
“Tea?”
"Of a soporific nature?" John grinned at him, then bit into a warm scone.
"I'm sure he didn't mean anything -" John began as he turned to see the look on his face.
"Which sent you walking in circles for a couple of hours until you ended up here," Greg muttered at him with a bit of a grin. "You come here when you need advice or want to be talked into or out of something."
John nodded and offered him his hand. "Come with me."
"You're shaking."
“Missed me.”
“Boys, there’s been an accident.”
"As it does," Sherlock agreed and laid a hand gently on her shoulder. She turned and looked at him.
"No, we don't," Mycroft agreed.
One would never describe the pair of them as cheerful, but as Sherlock rolled over, and sighed as he realized the rain had continued into the morning, he understood that he was at the very least content. Contentment wasn't something he had ever expected in this lifetime, and certainly not in the form of the man next to him who snorted in his sleep, then reached out for him and held on tightly.
Lestrade dropped into the chair in the waiting room and watched Sherlock pace in silence for a couple of minutes, then got to his feet, blocked his path, and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. "You know -" he began in his most avuncular tone.
Sherlock turned to look at him, and offered him a slight nod of approval. "Not bad, wasn't sure if you'd be able to keep up, and yet, here you are."
John had been a surgeon and a soldier, and yet he felt his face flush as he saw his former commander for the first time in -
"I do. I want every bit of you, one day. Tonight, though, will you hold me until I fall asleep?"
Sherlock shot a half grin at him, then knelt next to the body.
(In this verse, I'm making Lestrade a little older than he usually is)
"Very good, Dr Watson, you are beginning to see."
With a sigh, John knelt down and began picking up the pieces of broken mug from the floor, then answered, "That first day I walked into the shop, you saved my life that day."
"Ever since she's been working with you, she's been different."
"No. I need to help him, Sherlock, I need you to help me prove my friend didn't do this. Please."
"Domicile? Who says domicile?"
"Go on. I'll call you if anything changes."
"Not a fucking clue."
John blinked at the long cold plain toast and tea on the bedside table, then looked over at Sherlock as he slept. He could tell from the darkness under his eyes that he had been sleeping little the last couple of days. He knew he should get up and shower and try to do something, he had cases to write up, and he should go to the shops.
"Sherlock Holmes."
"Falling back on old habits?" John suggested gently.
He shrugged, and rumbled quietly, "Reading was one of the few things that got me through the 'fidgets' - especially when you read me to sleep." He didn't look in her direction, but down at his hands, and she remembered the 'fidgets' all too well. The days and nights when she would sit by his bedside as she did her paperwork, and he couldn't sleep, or wouldn't, even though it was the best thing he could have done for himself then. The times when he did manage to fall asleep, it was never a peaceful rest. She knew he was fighting something, what it was exactly, he could never tell her, when she was finally able to call him back to full awareness. She watched as he turned the monitor back round again and thought back even further.
Sherlock placed his hand on John’s chest, and said quietly, “Before I met you, the world seemed colorless, though I knew it wasn’t - it’s not that you changed the world. I think, it was that I had decided that it didn’t matter.”
Sherlock blinked at him. “You know I am, from the first moment I sat across from you downstairs at Speedy’s. Maybe even before that. I know it’s only been three months and a few days, but -”
But John? He gently traced John's strong jaw with a single finger and bit his lip as John's eyes fluttered open.
"Easier not to trust anyone," he mumbled in return.
"At what, exactly?" Sherlock asked.
"Yeah. Bloody paperwork," John smirked back at him, and shrugged, then looked down at his tea, and after an attempt to gather his thoughts, admitted to the room, "I'm shit at this."
She studied his face in silence for a long moment then nodded. "Makes for a lonely life, though."
“I’m not crazy, Doc,” James mumbled. “I know - how it sounds, but you don’t know -” He stopped and looked out the window again, then muttered, “But you do. You do know, but you are made of stronger stuff, you made it back in one piece, more or less.”
"Really?"
"What the -?" He stopped short as he realised the door to the barber shop was locked, shades drawn, to all the world appearing to be closed.
"No. It's fine. Did he say what, I mean - I only know him -"
“I know, doesn’t matter.”
"What?"
"I know, I always said I didn't want it - didn't need it, but I do. I want everyone to know how important you are - how important you've always been to me, and I want -"
He blinked as a light was switched on next to him, he had fallen asleep again. No great surprise there. He couldn't honestly recall the last time he slept through the night. Sherlock was quietly studying him, and he wondered what he could honestly see in him, why he had kept showing up week after week - it had to be the case, he supposed, as he wasn't all that interesting. "How long have you been awake?"
“Yeah, more or less. How can we help?”
"Not many people understood him, he was always lost in his own thoughts, James was the only one he would listen to. He did his best to help him keep his balance - Tad had always expected something like 9/11 to happen, so it didn't affect him as it did James, he wasn't close to his parents, and when James joined up, they had stopped speaking -"
"Apparently," Sherlock shrugged. "Dee was just as surprised as you are, I'm thinking there is a story there?"
“Sholto?”
He had those days that were simply too heavy, when memories visited too sharply, and the only saving grace was the strong arms and legs that reminded him that he was home.
"You won't."
John stood in front of the bookcases and studied the contents closely for the first time. Some he knew had to come with the flat itself, surely Sherlock had no use for the dusty volumes of Dickens and Austen -
"Can you tell me about it?"
"Oh. Dr Watson. I could've -" Mrs Hudson stared at the two empty plates in surprise, then smiled at him. "How did you manage it?"
"Sally asked me to marry her. She always said she didn't need a ring or a piece of paper, and after all this time, she's just changed her mind."
John nodded as he leaned his stick against an empty chair, then froze as the barber - no barber he'd ever met looked like, well, he'd only seen photos of Michelangelo's David, but he could imagine someone like the man who helped him out of his jacket could have served as the model. Dark curls, the piercing green eyes - sharp angles leading to the fullest lips he had ever seen. "Hmm, thank you."
"Thank you."
John nodded. "People think they have a right to know, think they will 'understand'. They won't, they can't." John put his emptied container down and cleared his throat. "Thank you, for this. Been a long time since I really laughed."
John nodded, and got out of the cab, then walked over to the door, and nearly jumped as the door was opened even before he reached for the antique bell pull. The man who stood before him may have been fifty or seventy, it was impossible to tell. “Dr Watson, I presume? Please come in.”
Sherlock stopped and turned back to look at him.
“We have -”
Sherlock snorted, but he offered no further argument, and was soon fast asleep.
"Not a fan of hospitals myself," John said quietly as he settled into the chair across from him.
Sherlock closed his eyes as he settled into the chair next to the tub, and sighed as he felt the water, then John's fingers as they threaded through the matted mess of curls. "John?"
“Me?”
"But not too slow."
It had been so long since he'd felt comfortable in his own skin - come to think of it, he'd never been all that comfortable with himself that it took him somewhat by surprise that he found himself at ease sharing dumplings and an order of Panang Curry with the man who sat next to him.
"Uhmhmm."
Sherlock slipped out of the Belstaff and carefully eased himself into the space John had made for him on the hospital bed, and let out a long sigh of relief as John rested against his chest. "Don't scare me like that again, please?"
"Scones and tea?" John's voice gently broke through to him, and he felt himself nod in agreement.
"How long have you been awake?"
“So what.”
“What is it?”
"Right." He nodded and watched her into her flat, then made his way up the seventeen steps. He pushed the door open with his foot and nearly dropped it when he found the owner of the booming voice on the couch, his left arm in a sling, and right foot in a boot. "Holy - what?"
In way of answer, Sherlock unplugged the kettle, and carefully took him into his arms.
“And?” John asked with a grin as he got to his feet and stretched.
"And you don't."
"Chatting, small talk."
"Is James Sholto capable of killing his brother?"
"Where 'm I?" He asked quietly without opening his eyes.
“I’m fine,” John said as he walked into the kitchen and plugged in the kettle.
John shook his head and nodded wordlessly in Sherlock’s direction as he watched one tall and lanky red-headed woman drop into their couch. He blinked as another woman, identical to the first strode over to Sherlock, who was slowly removing his rubber gloves as he got to his feet.
"The world is a bloody awful mess most days, which is why we have jobs," Sherlock replied with a snort, then glanced over at him again. "But there are days, moments when the mess seems to fall away, and I can see the good that exists. Donovan and Dee - you -"
Sherlock rolled his eyes at Mrs Hudson, but she gave him a wink as she handed him a mug and a plate of biscuits, then went back to the kitchen to retrieve the teapot. He realised then that John was drinking from her best tea service, and he nearly fell out of his chair. He couldn't remember the last time she had used it. A Royal wedding, possibly? Whatever the occasion, it seemed this evening had deserved her very best, so he relented and cleared his throat. "I was going to order some take-away, I don't usually order it just for myself - if you have nothing else on - thing is, I'd rather not be on my own for an hour or two."
Donovan laughed, then yawned and held out her hand towards him. He took it in both of his and was relieved when his right hand didn't tremble. "Sorry. I'm about to fall asleep. Will you send Dee in before you go home?" When Sherlock nodded she raised an eyebrow at him. "I mean it, go home. Don't try to find him. We'll get him later. Promise me?"
"I'm here, John." He pressed a kiss to John's hair, and came to the realisation that nothing he could do was more important than being exactly where he was. "I'm here."
“No. It had to be Anderson - what day is it John? Is it April Fools’ Day?”
He slowly got to his feet, and limped towards the window. He stood behind Sherlock and reached out to press a hand lightly on his back. Sherlock didn't flinch, but turned to face him with a relieved sigh. "You're still here."
"I don't know anything," Sherlock replied in a resigned voice that he'd never heard before, not even in the darkest days of their friendship.
Sholto nodded. “Watson - apologies, John, I sometimes forget I’m not -”
"Sherlock, I -"
"You know if you want to partner up with someone else -"
“Had?”
"Seem to be," John managed with a grin after he caught his breath.
“Nothing. He’s left nothing behind,” John said quietly as he scanned the nearly empty room.
"How is Donovan?"
“What is it?”
"Not really, probably would have been better if you'd interrupted a few seconds earlier." She took the bag and peeked inside. "Chocs and romances? Dee." She rolled her eyes and pulled out the first book. "Must have taken you hours to track these down."
He let out an impatient sigh. "You were in the medical corps. I can tell by your dog tags, the patch on your jacket. You are essential, and yet you are home, invalided. Horrible word, I think, to invalidate one seems rather harsh. Please, have a seat."
"No, it's fine. I want to - I don't know, I want to do something to help." He glanced around the room, dark and gloomy compared to their rooms in Baker Street, which seemed warm and inviting, and at the moment, he wished to be there, or anywhere but where they were at the moment.
“It’s fine, John, it was an entertaining little puzzle and we didn’t have to leave the flat.”
"Finish it. Please?"
"Six weeks if I behave myself."
"He didn't try to make you talk."
"No, I'm not.
"Nothing. Just -"
She nodded. “I know, it’s just, I’ve learned not to trust when things are too easy. Sherlock is happy, if - I just worry. You see, he isn’t different, he hasn’t changed since he met you, not really. To the rest of the world, he’s abrasive and arrogant, and handy on crime scenes, but here with you, he’s safe to -” She stopped speaking as the kettle sang, and abruptly got to her feet. “I apologise, John, it’s none of my concern -”
If he weren't so busy just trying to keep up, he might have paused for just a moment to watch Sherlock become more or less airborne as he dashed across the rooftops. As it was, when Sherlock finally came to a stop, without a curl out of place, and breathing easily, it was all he could do not to fall over.
James blinked at him then looked around the room. “Are you sure we’re alone? No one else is listening?”
"Tell me a story, John?" John kissed his shoulder, and told him the story that his mother would tell him on nights when he couldn't sleep, of a prince who spent most of his life searching in vain for his one true love.
It was the sound of the wind he remembered more than anything, even more than what had been done to him. Yes, of course, there were the scars left behind to remind him if he tried to forget, but it was the whistle of the wind and then the moments of silence that he dreamed of on the rare occasions when he closed his eyes and allowed himself to sleep.
"Obvious." John rolled his eyes, and the smirk gradually became the smile that was for him and him alone. "Dinner, John?"
"No, truly -"
Sherlock nodded. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he has received his own warning already, but as he isn’t of a superstitious nature -”
He started at a sound, and realized he had fallen asleep at some point. Sherlock was still, sleeping peacefully, as if he hadn't really slept in days, and he probably hadn't. John got up quietly from his chair, then moved silently out of the room to see Mrs Hudson holding the tea tray in her hands.
“I’ll have coffee and whatever he’s having,” Sherlock said, as he eased into his chair across from John. Charley nodded and left the table. “I should have realised the moment I saw them. He keeps a photo of them by the register, obviously important to him, just off my game of late. Eat, before it gets cold.”
"Hmm?"
"Erm, thank you?"
"Right now, at the moment, I'm starving, and you need to eat something, even if it's a bowl of rice -"
"And he plays the violin. Played me to sleep. Left me a note and left me to it. Sent me a text this morning."
"My work."
"For what?"
John picked up the instrument and settled into it, as if he was meant to play it, then lifted the bow from the case and began to play. Sherlock leaned back and closed his eyes, and for the first time in months emptied his mind and simply listened.
“I know I should be, but I’d rather just go to bed if you’ll come with me.”
"But, well, you saved me too. I don't normally - I try not to depend on people, I've learned they are as a species, rather unreliable, fickle, inconsistent, but you, you are cut from a different cloth. This case was my first one after some time away, and I thought it would be easy, and then I'd get asked back onto the good cases, but then it started to drag on, but I didn't mind once I realized you would be there, without fail. It kept me - you kept me from -"
"No. I want you to, it's just, no one has touched me, I didn't think anyone would want -"
"Yes, I know what I said, he had changed, but his brother was his only family, and they were twins, they had been inseparable -"
both young and stupid," Mycroft answered quietly, then waited for Greg to look up him. "We are still here, love, older and wiser, hmm?"
“I black out sometimes, and I find myself in places -” he shrugged, then sighed as he stood up from his chair and walked over to the window. He cleared his throat and straightened up, then continued. “Three days ago, I woke up in my brother’s room, and had a dreadful headache, concussion, and I searched the house for him, but couldn’t find him. Eventually I just went to bed and a day later--”
"Yes. I am, in fact, human," Sherlock muttered as he placed his fork down on the plate and picked up his glass of wine and took a sip. "I don't - as a rule - not really a rule, I don't usually have company, for reasons that must be obvious to you, so I don't normally drink, however." He closed his eyes and sighed. "This is one of her best bottles. As I recall, she was saving it for an
“No - I met him and his brother, his twin brother, Thaddeus, at Uni - he went by Tad, they were -” He paused and turned to look at Sherlock. “There’s no way James did anything to Tad, he never would have hurt him.”
Sherlock nodded then closed his eyes again. “Yes, John. Quite ridiculously happy.”
"Boring," Sherlock muttered, then focused his gaze on the uneaten scone on his plate, broke off a piece and glared at it before putting it down again. "But if we didn't have small talk, we'd actually have to talk about things that we shouldn't or can't. The big things that matter, or are supposed to matter, but don't." He shrugged, then picked up his tea and turned towards the fire.
Greg shrugged and picked up another pint glass and began drying it. "He let you play his most treasured possession and he fell asleep with you in the room - he obviously doesn't mind your company, and hell, he actually ate without being coerced. Molly's about the only the other person who can do that, and she's known him for years."
"You?" Molly's eyes popped, then she smiled as he rolled his eyes at her, and turned the monitor towards her.
"Of course she is."
“Has it?”
Sherlock's eyes locked on his and he knew he was waiting for him to finish the thought.
"Oh, Sherlock -" Mrs Hudson began.
“John. It doesn’t matter.” He pulled his phone out of his pocket and turned it off without letting go of John for a moment. “Look at me.” John looked at up him and breathed out a sigh of relief. “It’s done. Are you hungry? You must be hungry.”
John snorted and whispered in return, "They do little else," before he leaned in close and pushing a steady hand into the riotous raven curls, pulled him into a kiss that answered any doubts either of them might have had.
"Me?" John asked in surprise.
As he opened his eyes that morning, he could distinctly recall those endless days of smoky grey, then forced them from his consciousness as Sherlock rolled in his arms and studied him silently for a long moment before he opened his mouth to speak, then changed his mind.
Watson blinked at him for a moment, then nodded. "I am partial to the Thai place around the corner."
Sherlock opened his eyes and sighed as he glared at the ceiling. Just another rainy afternoon.
“Our next client, John.”
“The rain has stopped.”
Greg finished cleaning, then pulled out his phone and was about to text Mycroft but changed his mind. He needed to hear his voice.
"What did the note say?" She asked quietly.
"But why -?" John was honestly puzzled.
"No, he's not the most clever man in London, that would be my brother, but he knows people, and he's known me longer than anyone else, other than my family, so it's a fair assessment." He carefully made his way to the couch and propped his ankle on the pillow, steepled his fingers together and closed his eyes. John shook his head, then walked into the kitchen and plugged in the kettle for tea, and realized he wasn't exhausted for the first time in months.
"Definitely historical. Accuracy isn't the point." Molly thought of the current book by her bedside and took a sip of her coffee to hide her blush, then said, "It helps the reader become more distracted from reality, which is the point, after all."
"How did you -"
The warm, sleepy voice drew him safely away from the spectral images that visited on those nights when the past came to visit. He let out a relieved sigh and settled once more into Sherlock's gentle embrace.
"And?"
Sherlock and John...
"He is fine. Well. He has been better, he did want me to extend an apology to you if you happened to show up today, and to offer you a ride to his domicile if you were agreeable."
"I don't, actually." John bit his lip, then shook his head. "I mean, I want to be here."
“He showed me a snap he kept in his box once, he’s ten years older, I never met them - I -”
"So..." Molly prompted with a nod at her computer.
Sherlock shrugged and slowly got to his feet, then squinted at the clock on the wall. He'd slept six hours. He couldn't remember the last time he'd slept so long. He looked over at Dee again and she pointed him forward, he sighed, but had nothing else to do, so he started walking until he found himself in a chair by Donovan's bedside.
"You wish to see where Mr Thaddeus passed. Very sad, very sad indeed. I am Morstan, please follow me, gentlemen."
“There are some days when knowing Mycroft has distinct advantages, today is one of them.”
"Yeah."
"But?" Sherlock asked quietly, and John could see the exhaustion in his eyes.
"They got away?"
"We are here -"
John was in the midst of one of the worst weeks in months, when he realised he was almost late for his weekly appointment at his barber. It wasn't an appointment really, it was just the way he marked time. Time since his return, two years ago now, nearly to the day, from Germany, after an abrupt departure from Afghanistan. He had left London as a Captain, with a promising surgical career ahead of him, when -
Greg sniffed the air. "Dumplings and Panang Curry, the place around the corner."
"I'm honestly not all that interesting."
Silence.
He stopped and refolded it, and slipped it back into his wallet. "Trust," He said with a snort and shook his head. "Yesterday I fell asleep around two people I don't really know, Dee - I guess that makes sense." Molly nodded. "But John? I was just listening - and I closed my eyes - it was one of the pieces I used to play when I couldn't think anymore, it was as if - as if he knew me." He looked at his wallet and dropped it back into his pocket. He looked up at the ceiling, then uncurled from her chair, and she realised he'd been there for a few hours as he slowly got to his feet and made his way over to her.
"Yes. But he already trusts you, and he doesn't trust many people."
"Looks better on you," Sherlock muttered as he wrapped his arms around John and pressed a lingering kiss on his shoulder that sent a shiver through both of them.
She shook her head. "He doesn't forget anything, that mind of his is like a steel trap. I was saving it for a special day, and I figured, this day was as good as any other. Just be careful, that one up there is a bit of a lightweight."
"Sherlock could use a friend, and so could you. Try not to overthink it, DI Watson. I know most of the time he can be a royal pain in the arse, but he's a good person who has been through more than his fair share of crap, and so have you. Take it slow. It's clear that he trusts you."
"Hmm?"
A few hours earlier...
"Shall I carry on, or are you not quite finished with your
“Sherlock.”
John stood up as straight as he could and almost wished for his stick again, just to have some sort of protection. "Yes. Do I know you?"
"Not much, no."
"I was just walking," John muttered, but walked up to the bar and dropped onto a stool, then picked up the pint and drained half of it before setting it down again. "I went over to Baker Street to see how Sherlock was coping."
John cleared his throat, then managed to mumbled out, "Sorry, what?"
John rolled his eyes, and Sherlock shrugged, then admitted sheepishly, "Lestrade may have reminded me that you wouldn't appreciate having to bail me out, once or twice."
"He was my barber for two years."
"Being alone."
"I interrupted something," Sherlock said as he took Dee's seat, then handed Donovan one of the bags he was holding.
a bit of a fix-it...
"And I bet she told you to go home."
"And I love you," came the slightly astonished words. "Are you sure nothing is wrong?"
"Breathe," John murmured against his chest. "Just breathe, some days if that's all we can do, that's enough. Just breathe, for me?"
The man sighed and handed John a business card.
"Sounds like a date."
“I know, me too,” John said quietly. “Some days it still catches me by surprise. I am, I was used to being alone, and now -”
"No, I - uhm. I know - I mean - I want to, hell, this hurts. Here it is. I trust you, and you, until today, seemed to well, like me, you kept showing up -"
He shrugged again and met her glance, then looked away.
"Come 'ere."
"I'd forgotten," John mumbled, then looked over at him with a smile.
"You need to get some rest, let me help you to bed?"
"Before, she was set in her ways, everything had its place, life was - I knew what to expect, and now -" Sherlock watched as her mouth worked itself into a smile, then she grabbed his face and kissed his forehead. "She asked me to marry her." Sherlock couldn't help but smile as she let go of his face and quickly strode off in the direction of Donovan's room.
"John, I can do this on my own," Sherlock began.
Sherlock's jaw dropped, then nodded.
Sherlock nodded and gently guided John to their bedroom and closed the door. After a few minutes, he left the bedroom only to check that they had locked the door to their flat, they had, and to pick up his phone, turn it back on, leave a succinct message for his brother (”Fuck off, Myc”) and turn it off again before he headed back to bed.
"Sherlock. I am fine."
"You're safe. At Barts."
“Oh, hell.”
Greg blinked at him and carefully set the glass down that he had been holding before he dropped it in the sink. "So -"
"I was on a case, John, it was -"
“Surprised that you of all people would have such attractive sisters.”
Watson smiled then and the light in his indigo eyes nearly took Sherlock's breath away.
"Yes. I'm not sure I want to know how you know -" For the first time John looked up, and studied the barbershop properly. There were cameras on the corners of the building - not old, maybe two years old. As he watched, they swiveled and seemed to focus on him.
John studied his face for a moment, then saw the tension in his hand that was tightly wrapped around the umbrella that he used for support. Stress. He's under stress, and he normally doesn't show - no, he can't show emotion.
With a crisp nod in Lestrade's direction, Sherlock stepped over to their newest corpse, removed his magnifier and slowly knelt down.
"Different? In what way?"
"Course not. I behaved myself."
“And yet, here we are.”
"But?"
No number, address or website appeared on it. Just a name.
"Sherlock."
"That we served together, you were my superior and why you came home," John answered quietly and set his glass on the bar.
“Who?” The redhead on the couch asked before she stood and hung up her coat as if planning to stay for a while.
“John. There’s evidence it wasn’t an accident. From the CCTV -”
"It's on the house. I'm usually free at this time every Wednesday."
“Mrs Hudson?” John opened the door of the flat and invited her in. Usually she had no qualms about entering their rooms without regard for their privacy, but this morning, she seemed nervous about something, and he helped her to a chair.
"Yooohooo, boys...."
“I admit, I went through an odd phase or two, and yes, ‘Casino Royale’ is my favourite, too.”
John wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist, and they both breathed out a sigh of relief. "I've got you, I won't let you fall, I promise."
Sherlock saw a change in her face, and nodded. "She and I - well, she knows me better than most people do. She was the first person I saw when I woke up. I was in a coma for a month and a half. She talked to me. When I wasn't - she was the only one who treated me like I was still there. It's so odd, I still remember - she would tell me about her day, about you and the kids. Especially when the kids were driving her crazy."
"Is this okay? Too hot, too cold?"
"How often does he-"
“You will think me insane, Doc. But, I found him in his library - and he -”
"For -?"
“Him.”
Sherlock blinked at him, unable to speak.
"Oh. Oh! Yer that John Watson. Damn, didn't think I'd get to meet you. Excellent. Right, I'll send over some cases, give me a couple hours to get a box together. Maybe we can get a pint when he's back on his feet. I've got to run, just - if he gets all quiet on you, don't take it personal, it's a thing he does, helps him focus, I guess. He's a good guy, just a bit rough on the edges, not great with people, but his heart's in the right place. Good to see he has a mate." Lestrade nodded to himself, then offered John his hand, which John took as some kind of approval and shook the offered hand, then watched as he nodded again, and left the flat, closing the door behind him.
"Doctor Watson." She saw the light sparkle in his dark eyes, and the small cautious smile as he left her flat, and she smiled to herself as she gave a thought to the workings of the universe for a brief moment, before giving up and turning on her evening story.
"It seems you have a most unusual effect on me."
“But, John, it’s never twins.”
"Three it is, then." Again, he felt his face do that smiling thing, and he cleared his throat and turned away to make the call before he did or said anything else that he would embarrass them both. No, he thought as he turned back to catch Sherlock watching him steadily, it wasn't a question of embarrassing either of them, it was whether or not he could deal with falling harder for the man who had been haunting his dreams for the last two years.
"What about it?"
Home. The flat he had lived in before Afghanistan was still full of the things he'd had before. Before his life - the life he thought he was going to have had essentially ended, even as he had survived. He had thought one day, one day he would, what, exactly? What had he dreamed of before? A family? Or just a life of work, and the local, maybe he'd meet a woman, or a guy, one day, and his life would be -
"Yes?" An older woman with sharp, grey eyes opened the door and knew exactly who he was. "Dr. Watson. How lovely to finally meet you, maybe you can do something with him." She rolled her eyes at the stairs and sighed as they both heard a bang, then a crash. "He's fine when he's got a case on - but, he's worse than, well - a doctor is when he is incapacitated -"
"Older, at least," Greg muttered with a sheepish grin then groaned as he tried to get up from the floor. Mycroft shook his head then got up from his chair, and gently helped him to his feet.
"John?"
"Of course."
“You seriously think this has something to do with the pips?”
“Already -?”
John started at a sound and bolted upright, in a bed.
“He died last month, we had been living in our father’s home - he left it to Tad, thought I wouldn’t need or want that monstrosity, and he was correct of course, but when I was invalided out, Tad invited me to live with him - we had our own rooms, and we rarely saw each other except at breakfast -”
"He never talks about it," Sherlock said quietly then picked up his bottle of ale.
a bonus chapter, since it's Friday?
"Afternoon."
Sherlock looked into his friend's eyes and shook his head. "That's ridiculous."
"Every Wednesday at 2 PM, for half an hour to three quarters of an hour, for two years? You are the closest thing my brother has to a friend, and right now, he needs a friend." The woman opened the door for him and he nodded his thanks, then straightened and walked up to the black door with the brass knocker for the first time, and into a new life.
“Hey.”
"My name, my card. No charge."
John picked up his pint again and stared into it, then put it back on the bar. "I played for him - played him to sleep."
James laughed, but it was wild and without humour as he ran his fingers through his hair and mumbled, “that’s about the sum of it.” John started, and quickly came to the inevitable conclusion that his friend and former commander was quite certainly mad.
"You didn't get too aggressive with the docs or the nurses?"
"Sherlock..."
“No, he isn’t, but he’s scared, Sherlock. Last time I saw him look like that -” John shook his head and was about to say something more when Mrs Hudson entered the flat. “Mrs H?”
“No, he is dead, that is a fact, Mr Holmes, what I find hard to believe is how it happened, but the facts as they stand are that either he killed himself, or I killed him and cannot remember doing it.”
"Is it just as a man and his barber, which is one of the strongest relationships a man can have these days, or is it, if I may be so blunt, made of stronger stuff?"
"I promise," he said quietly and watched as she closed her eyes. He placed her hand back on the bed and silently left the room.
"Just needs time to heal, but I think if you have any cold cases stashed anywhere, that would help him the most."
"Tad was - well, he was a lot like you."
"This isn't the first time."
"Yeah, I promise."
Sherlock nodded and pulled out his phone, and wondered what he was getting himself into.
"I promise. Rest now, I'll be here when you wake up."
"I dreamed of doing that once."
"John."
"Comedy?"
Sholto shook his head, and he knew Sherlock wouldn’t take a cup, he was already in ‘case mode.’ There was an oddly jubilant crackle in the air as he closed his eyes and pressed his fingers together. “James, why don’t you repeat the story you’ve already shared with me for John. I think he will find it intriguing, to say the least.”
Mrs Hudson nodded. John walked into the kitchen, put on the kettle, then returned and sat in his chair. “Things might have been different if not for 9/11. He was brilliant, a historian, was going to spend his life in the ivory tower teaching - but that day changed him, his parents were in New York that day, an anniversary present, twenty-fifth. They never came home, he had to identify them by their belongings that were found in their hotel room. He left Cambridge - I didn’t see him again until I got to Afghanistan. He had a bad war. He was a good officer, but - war changes people, and he was already broken when he went. Mrs H - you know I’m with Sherlock. I love him and I would never do anything to hurt him.”
"Your brother discovered - or rather, researched me when he noticed our 'connection' and he knows the building of flats that I've lived in for most of my life when I wasn't in Afghanistan was sold out from under me six months ago, I've been in a crummy bedsit since, the pension just covers it. He was too polite - no, too well-bred to say anything on our way over." He shook his head and looked down at his hands. "You will listen, and not throw any more mugs? Yeah?"
"Box of files for Holmes. DI asked me to bring them, ordered me to. I'm Donovan." He opened the door and after he walked through the doorway, pulled it closed again. "How's he doing?"
"Uhm."
"John Watson."
"Positive. Stay for another cuppa." Sherlock bit his lip and wondered what it was about the man opposite that made him want to drop his defenses.
"Where is he, is he-"
"No, I don't mind," John answered, then dropped into the chair next to the bed and watched as Sherlock closed his eyes, even as he fought to stay awake. He wondered what to say that could be of interest to the man who seemed to know everything about him, when he realized it was more that Sherlock felt like he needed to give him a reason to stay, and he understood at that moment that he'd stay as long as Sherlock wanted him to. It startled him for a moment, but as Sherlock opened his eyes again, he settled back further in his chair, and began to tell him a story, a story he had started to write years ago, but had left unfinished, perhaps now he could find an ending for it.
"Something like that." He looked into his teacup then up at Sherlock and Sherlock held his breath for a moment, then let it go slowly, before he decided to speak.
"Yeah." He poured himself another glass of wine and drank half of it before setting it down carefully again.
That was eight hours ago, and now there was someone banging on the door to the flat. He tossed on some clothes, somehow someone had known his size and likes... right, the brother, then slipped into his shoes, and made his way to the door feeling halfway human.
John rolled his eyes and opened the door to Mrs. Hudson and a tray full of scones and a fresh pot of tea.
John stood and helped him to stand, then wrapped his arm around his waist and together made their way to Sherlock's room. John settled the blankets carefully around him, then sat on the edge on the bed and looked into his eyes before he cleared his throat. "I haven't slept with anyone, in any way, shape or form since Afghanistan, partly because of the nightmares, but also -" He began to unbutton his shirt, but Sherlock stopped him with a look and he nodded at him, then closed his eyes tightly until he heard Sherlock ask quietly, "May I?"
"Definitely not."
John dropped to his knees across from him and examined the corpse. "Strangulation. Probably a scarf."
He made his way down the stairs, missing the creaky step that he had encountered in previous visits, and was nearly to the door when Mrs Hudson opened her door, and smiled gently at him. "You play beautifully, DI Watson. Thank you for seeing to him. He isn't the easiest person on a good day, and I know it wasn't a good day."
"I don't think anything, except that you need a cup of tea."
“It’s fine, John. It’s all fine.” He got to his feet and turned to face him. “I’m sorry I didn’t warn you, I didn’t know about him until I got to the Diogenes Club and Mycroft asked us if we would take a look, muttering something about ‘British lives being at stake - something about a knighthood, yadda yadda yadda’... I should warn you though, I think your friend is in danger.”
“a case for you,” the other finished.
"Is that an offer Dr Watson?" Sherlock grinned back at him, then groaned as he tried to sit up taller.
"Dr. Watson."
"Greg's tonight? 8ish?"
"I was thinking, will you marry me?"
Sherlock took a sip of the tea and grimaced, then looked around the room, "Exactly."
"Please let me know if you require my assistance further."
Sherlock whispered in return, "Give me an hour, and we'll head home."
"He worries."
"Maybe she's feeling a bit mortal at the moment?" Sherlock suggested quietly.
“I have dusting to do, and my stories will be on soon.”
"Me?"
"How do you know that he trusts me?" John asked as he poured the last of the wine into his glass.
“And now?”
“From the beginning?”
Sherlock nodded.
"I talked to Dee."
"Hmm?"
Greg sighed and rubbed his face with his hands. "There are reasons I don't talk about -" John nodded. "Mycroft and I - we had been together before I joined up, but we had one of those stupid arguments that young couples have, and I left, and then joined up. Mycroft found out that I was hurt and helped me through rehab, and eventually we got back together. Sherlock had been in boarding school, and Myc and I got married the summer before he went to Cambridge. Sherlock hasn't really forgiven me for leaving how I did. I just left. It was stupid. I've always regretted it - one day -" He stopped speaking and put the glass away, then met John's eyes. "You're a good guy, John. He's a bit lost right now, trying to find his place in the world. He doesn't have to do it on his own, and I know you -"
"I had take away with DI Watson, John, at my flat. We watched Flying Circus - "
"And I - what?"
"Look. I am interested. Very interested. You must know that, you
"She's going to be fine."
"Sherlock, just take it, it doesn't help if you try to pretend you're not in pain. I can see it in your face, hear it in your breathing. I know it doesn't help all that much, but it will take the edge off."
His eyes were gleaming, and John knew it would be just another moment - yes, there was the slight smirk, and the solution to the case tumbled from his lips, the same lips he could barely keep his eyes from.
"After a fashion," Sherlock mumbled, mostly to himself.
"Eat?" John suggested mildly as he poured them each a small glass of wine, and turned his attention to dinner. Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, but picked up his plate and after glaring at it mercilessly, picked up his fork and began to eat, possibly simply as an experiment, but after a moment, John couldn't help but grin to himself as Sherlock realized he was in fact hungry.
Sherlock walked over to the ancient fireplace, picked up a poker and explored the half burnt remains. “He was worried.”
Relationships of any sort had always been a puzzle that he realized early on were a waste of time. Well, that is, until now. From the very beginning, in fact from the moment John offered him his phone, he had felt something unloosen in his chest, he stood a little taller, breathed a little easier. It was simple, though he understood after many days of contemplation, it wasn't something he could untangle with logic. They weren't logical, there was no reason at all why they should work as they did, they simply were.
“It was a warning. There must have been some reason James didn’t want to tell you he came this kind of wealth, the books in Tad’s rooms - yes, he was a scientist, a chemist and a lover of poetry, but he also had shelves of books dating back to the American Civil War, histories of families, including his own that made a fortune from slavery. Tad lived with the past, reminded himself of it on a daily basis, while James tried to escape it. In the end -”
"Oh, Dr Watson, apologies, I just thought I'd -" She paused and smiled at him. "You got him to sleep. I'm sure I've never believed in miracle workers but you just worked one, young man. He rarely sleeps when he's in one piece, and when he's banged up as he is now -"
Charley set down John’s plate in front of him, then pulled over another chair and sat down. “So. How long did it take him?”
"Wait. Let me -"
"Enough for me?" John whispered. "You are -"
"Just?"
John rolled his eyes and turned to face him, then let a sigh escape as he felt Sherlock's nimble fingers begin to work on the buttons of the purple shirt.
"Hey." The soft word reminded him that he was no longer alone. He turned his head to find John smiling at him.
"Hmm?"
“You didn’t know, then,” Sherlock murmured at his ear, bringing him back to the present moment.
"Lead the way."
"I heard."
Apologies for the delay, a writing slump attacked...
"Keeping Dee company."
"Please?"
"Not too often these days, it's been a while since DI Lestrade has let him on a crime scene -" She narrowed her eyes at him and nodded. "You know -"
"Go ahead."
“Six years.”
"Wouldn't you be more comfortable in bed?"
"Tell me about Tad and James."
"I'll do my best," John answered before drifting off to sleep.
"Can I help you?" He asked, as he threw open the door to an older man, obviously a cop. "You must be Lestrade."
John ran his fingers through his curls as he waited for him to go on.
"Hurts like hell, and you can only take paracetamol."
"Thank you."
"I'm rude, obnoxious -"
John carried the tray to the desk, then pulled a swivel chair over to the couch and dropped into it. "Your brother can be very persuasive."
“Mrs H -” They both turned at the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs and John blinked as Sherlock entered the flat with James Sholto behind him. “James.”
John pulled the desk chair over next to the table, removed the lid of the file box and placed the first file in Sherlock's lap. Their eyes met and Sherlock nodded at him a bit curiously, then opened the old manila folder, and closed it again. He looked down at the file, then over at John again and cleared his throat. "I know you must have better things to do than babysit me, but I do appreciate your presence."
Sherlock touched his face gingerly and waited for a moment.
“No, I know. I came to see you.”
"I am attempting to determine what counts as ridiculous romance novels these days."
She rolled her eyes then walked over to her desk and looked at him closely. The dark circles under his eyes were fading and he had actually shaved off the once permanent five o'clock shadow, which made him look even younger than his twenty-nine years. "You've slept," she pronounced in surprise.
"We don't really talk about the past."
"Have an appointment?" The most beautiful voice he'd ever heard asked him.
“Yes.”
John blinked at him.
"Rather," Sherlock yawned and tried to get comfortable on the couch.
“You were going to say something.”
Right.
"Know what?"
Greg shrugged and pulled a pint, then set it down on the bar. "You don't end up here without a reason."
“No.” John shook his head. ”He came to us for help and we let him just walk out, even though he was in danger, if not from someone else - he wasn’t -”
He opened his eyes and glanced over at her. "Dee. Sorry. I didn't mean to fall asleep."
"Yes. He loves it."
John blinked at the manservant and allowed Sherlock to lead him into the house, as he felt quite unable to move on his own volition.
Another near miss, a moment when everything went silent as the bullet whizzed by, half an inch to the left and - no. He wouldn't think about that for now, not when John was safely in his arms, nearly asleep.
"The dead parrot skit."
"Which is, what exactly?"
"Hmm?"
"Hmm?"
Mrs Hudson nodded and finally met John’s eyes. “I know - well, I know that there were rumors, - before you were hurt, that you and he -”
"I know you weren't on the scene when it happened, but I know -"
"He is going to be fine, not because the doctors say he will be, but because he has you."
“Enough,” Sherlock murmured then opened the door and walked into a room that was as devoid of character as his brother’s had been all too telling.
Donovan opened her eyes to find Dee sitting quietly by her bed. She studied the strong, beautiful profile for a few minutes and reached out to take her hand. Dee startled, then smiled and lifted their joined hands to her lips. She looked into Donovan's eyes and raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"
Sherlock listened as Morstan gave them the history of the house and of his family's connection to the Sholtos, while John looked around, trying to place the friend he had known in this dwelling that seemed to belong to a different century.
"Hmm?"
avuncular: relating to an uncle
John nearly lost track of time watching Sherlock grumble through the next few files, until he noticed how he would suck in a breath every once in a while, then blow it out again on a count of ten. He was hurting, but wouldn't say. He knew because he used to do the same thing, back when he was trying to do anything he could to get out of hospital. He quietly slipped into the kitchen and returned with a dose of paracetamol and a glass of juice.
“It just will. Tomorrow has to be better, doesn’t it?”
"Yes."
"I will always need you."
"So you are stuck here -"
“Ears. They both wear their hair so they are usually covered, but one of them, Helen, I think, has that nervous habit of playing with her hair. I also saw a brief look of recognition in John’s eyes, he recovered quickly enough, they had never met him, so it didn’t much acting on their parts -”
“I’ve become accustomed to you being by my side. Not good for undercover work. Being attached.”
"Right."
“Client. Right.” Embarrassing. He could hear Mrs Hudson making tea as if it was like any other day, and it was. He was just another client. Just one more client.
"Yeah, sure." He went to the desk, grabbed a pen, wrote a note on the folder and put it aside, then placed another file on his lap, and settling into the chair, listened as Sherlock grumbled about the general incompetence of photographers, and crime scene investigators. He squinted at one photograph for over an hour, then chuckled to himself. "Brilliant, John, just -" He looked over at John, who was grinning at him, and his breath caught. "What?" he asked quietly, as he fidgeted with the folder in his lap.
"Hell. You look worse than I do," she muttered at him. He looked down at his hands and waited for her to go on. "Never been shot before, I feel stupid more than anything else. I should have known better. But, I trusted him."
"Paperwork," Sherlock suggested with a grin.
"Definitely older," Mycroft whispered in return, and as he felt Greg shiver against him, he pressed a kiss into his hair and tightened his arms around him. "There was never anyone but you, you were all I ever wanted, and the day you came back to me was the day my life started again." Greg sighed against his shoulder and soon he felt tears dampening his shirt.
"She surprised me." Dee shook her head and looked at the floor for a moment, then glanced up at him and crossed her arms. "It's you."
Charley cleared his throat and started to explain, “Look, it wasn’t a prank, they needed help, and have the means and I knew you were having a bit of a dry spell, ever since -”
The rain seemed endless that spring. Once it would have driven him quite mad, and yet he barely gave it a thought these days, as his thoughts and every other bit of him were usually quite pleasantly otherwise occupied one way or another.
"I'll be there, promise," he kissed her forehead, then walked out of her office. She dropped into her chair and made the necessary adjustment, then closed her eyes as she heard him whistling as he made his way down the hall. She smiled to herself, as she couldn't remember the last time she'd heard him whistle, and hoped that John Watson would be patient enough to wait for him. Twenty minutes later she was still lost in her thoughts when the DI called out her name and she nearly spilled her coffee.
Sherlock nodded and switched off the microscope, then got to his feet. "Come, we should look at James' rooms." He walked over to John and offered him his hand and helping him to stand said softly, "Give me the word and I will walk away from this case, John."
“To the house of course, it will help immensely if you could show us the scene, though I’m sure by now anything of interest will have been altered, or at least disregarded -”
Sherlock and John, and a bit of Hudders...
