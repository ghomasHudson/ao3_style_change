Dean plays dumb, because it’s all he’s good for. He says, “Cas, it’s a little late for the birds and the bees talk. What do you mean,
Cassie and Cas share a look – which, un-fucking-acceptable, no, nope, do not pass go – and Cassie says, “We’re staying at a motel nearby. We can share with you guys what we’ve learned so far. Maybe you can prove what a ‘delight’ you are to work with there, Dean.”
“It’s not that I don’t think she’s not capable.” Dean lets out a harsh exhale, and stomps into the driver’s seat. It’s the truth. He knows she’s capable. It was one of his favourite things about her – she’s wicked smart and sharp, she’s strong, she can aim a gun as well as anyone else, and she never backs down from danger.
, but he thought he’d get a fucking clue at least. His jaw locks and grinds, and he stands, shucks his sweatpants and storms to the shower to clean the lotion and shame from his dick.
This is all spinning wildly out of control. That isn’t right, that isn’t the whole truth, but Dean doesn’t know the words to fix it, to articulate what’s actually happening in his own fucked up head. His whole face feels numb and slack as he stares at Cas. The way he looks… just completely shut down. Like somebody finally found the off switch and he’s rebooting.
Really, though, what would he say even if he was brave enough to talk about it? He can’t tell Cas. It could hurt his feelings. Or, worse, he might doubt Dean can do this, can love him like he wants to be loved.  It’s not that. He needs to – he needs to just get on with it. Push through the fear, and let Cas -
“So what if it was? Come
He downs his drink rather than answer. He taps a finger against it, and says, “Can I get a refill?”
. He’s pretty sure that abandoning him counts as failing that instruction, and it’s only the excitement of buying a ratty thrifted sofa to curl up with Cas on that’s propelled him this far. Like he was sailing on stupid picket-fence dreams without realising he was still tied to the dock.
“I don’t know for sure!” Sam hurries to add.
and resolves to take them both by the nearest menswear or thrift store to complete the ensemble. Cas looks back over his shoulder, as he heard Dean’s thought, and his eyes twinkle.
Dick looks like he’s gearing up for a retort, but then the doors open and Jody, bless her heart, comes walking through, with Donna as her back-up. “Alright, boys?” she calls, striding forward. “I take it this is our troublemaker?”
Cas steps close, right up into his space so he has to tilt just a little to keep eye contact. “I do. Even when you snore through
Dean instinctively thrusts into the tight warm texture of Cas’s hand and lets out an overwhelmed, “Guh,” as he grabs onto Cas’s shoulders. He scrambles for purchase, and one hand flies back to brace himself against the wall as Cas starts
(Where it took him.)
“No, he says, soft at first and then stronger as he stands. “No. I’m going to go home.”
He doesn’t want to call out. He doesn’t want to draw the wrath of the Empty, whether this is either a game of hers or she simply hasn’t noticed him yet. Either way, he knows her fickle nature, and there’s too much at risk to tempt it.
,” Dean hisses into the phone, which he is fully fucking aware does not prove his point. He lets out an irritated snarl, and says, “Whatever. You can text her and tell her to go back home, where it’s safe, ‘cause Cas and I have got this case sorted.”
Dean stares at the wood.
, on the cover. He is so instantly filled with a rush of fondness that he thinks he might be able to bottle it up and sell it.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” lies Cas, like a dirty lying
So, Dean says, magnanimously, as a good friend who wasn’t already begging to feel Cas’s touch to prove his presence, “Take all the body heat you need, man.”
Cas looks up from a newspaper he picked up at the front desk as Dean stands up. “We need to look at the body,” says Dean. “I say we go pick up some suits and get to the morgue. A ripped-up body could be anything – and the police might be keeping missed organs out of the press in case of fake confessions.”
“Dean-” Cas tries again, and un-fucking-acceptable, so Dean bites down mean on Cas’s neck, just below his collar, and starts unbuttoning his shirt. Cas lets out a whimper, cracked by his own deep voice, and Dean hides his pleased grin against Cas’s skin. He sucks a path along the skin he uncovers, along the hair that darkens the further south Dean’s lips wander, until he’s crouching before Cas. Before he can hit his knees, Cas pulls him back up and brings him back into a brutal kiss. He pulls off with a smack, and tries again, “Dean-”
“No!” It explodes from Dean.
“Thanks!” says Jack, brightly. “Cas helped. Sometimes I’d have an idea, and he’d point out how that went badly in the past.”
“Right,” Dean says, staring at the TV as several half-naked men fly down a fireman’s pole on their way to a call, siren blasting. The subtitles read: [Sexy Music Plays]. And, well, sexy music is indeed playing in the background. “So, it’s about firemen.”
Sam eventually goes in to join them, and so it becomes a chicken fight where Eileen sits on Sam’s shoulders and Charlie on Cas’s. Eventually, Eileen, through pure viciousness, declares herself the winner when Charlie goes falling back into the ocean for the third time.
“No,” Cas corrects, sounding like he’s on the verge of laughter. “You said that you got the beer order wrong, and you’d fix it, but,” and now he curls quotation marks from his fingers, “’You didn’t want to hear a goddamn comment about it.’”
For a moment, he allows himself this, in the privacy of the moment. He’s happy. He presses a kiss against Cas’ scalp, and watches the movie.
“I’m not allowed to visit my little brother now?”
“So, what, I have to write you a letter in advance-”
Dean grits his teeth. “That’s not an excuse.”
“Me too,” says Dean. The fresh air by the docks helps him wake up, and shake the last of the few more whiskeys he’d had before bed. “Have you been busy?”
They stand there, fuming at each other. Dean desperately wants to swing a punch, but he’s also very aware Sam has the advantage of sobriety and height and having had a shower within the last day or so.
“Did he?” Cas is smirking, a tilt to his lips that Dean rolls his eyes at.
Dean shakes his head. “We shouldn’t. I don’t want them to think-”
“What?” Dean swallows. “Where are you going?” Maybe if he plays dumb, then Cas won’t get the option to leave. Denial is a sweet, sweet drug.
They get into the house and Cas takes a moment to consider the inside of it. The scent of alcohol still on the air and the deep imprint of Dean’s ass on the couch. Before he can say anything that Dean doesn’t have an answer for, Miracle comes bounding forward, yapping happily and throwing himself into Cas’s obediently outstretched arms. Cas hugs him close, and says, “Ah, yes. Good boy. I am glad to see you too.”
Rowena continues, “I was speaking to Charlie, inside. She’s really something.”
“Well, then,” says Dean, and he puts aside his own plate. He sits up so he can pull the folded bed sheets over them both, because he wants Cas to have a nap and he figures he can lead by example. He lies back down to lie on his side so he can still face Cas. “I’m sorry you got hurt.”
Eventually, he turns, hand still entwined with Cas’s, and pulls him close. He cradles Cas’s jaw and presses a soft kiss against his lips. “You’ve done good, sweetheart. It’s gorgeous.”
and he can’t handle it. He doesn’t want Cassie, not really, not anymore, but it’s an awful jealousy that burns nonetheless.
Dean could kiss him. Dean does, can’t help himself, leans back in quickly, and then pulls back. “I’ll bring you some,” he says. “Coffee in bed, right? You’ve earned it. Holy shit. I’ll just…” And he gestures to his wardrobe. Cas steps away, and settles back into the bed calmly, with no sign of discomfort or the raging hard-on he had just been pressed against Dean’s hip. Dean gets dressed fast, into boxers and jeans and a plain t-shirt, before he stumbles out into the hallway and towards the kitchen.
Dean looks up and says to the ceiling, “Thanks, buddy.” He gives Cas a second to move, and then stands. He scurries over to the wardrobe and slides into fresh boxers. It’s not – he’s not ashamed of his body. It’s not like that. Then he realises he’s being weird. His panic itself is weird – what, does he think Cas is just going to jump him as soon as he sees dick? Is that homophobic?
the one who’s been lying through most of the time we’ve known each other.”
Cas opens his mouth, and like Patience had warned him herself, Dean elbows him and interjects, “She’s asking if you work, babe.”
“Okay,” says Dean, and he closes his eyes, and focuses on the heat of Cas’s hand on his skin. With his elbow still on the car seat, his forearm raises to he can slot his own hand against Cas’s. “Cas, I want to kiss you. Can I do that?”
Dean’s jaw works, and his fingers drum on the wood. He remembers shining eyes, and
with me!”
she suggested making it our wedding reception.”
Dean raises his hands in surrender. “No, sorry. I’m just – you never mentioned it before.” He’s quiet, until, because he remains a glutton for punishment, he says, “Your childhood fucked you up, huh?”
Fuck. Dean steels himself and twists his chin, forces his eyes to follow. His shoulders are tight enough to give him even more back problems, even as he takes in Cas’s glittering expression.
He’d picked the tomatoes in excitement, just two, one for their burgers that night and another to make club sandwiches the next day. Cas doesn’t always have a great appetite, like how some nights he can sleep and others he can’t. Dean has asked about his grace, but Cas always just smiles and tells him not to worry. He has his own grace back, but something about it not taking up as much room in him as it did before. Dean thought that home-grown tomatoes, especially grown with angelic grace, might tempt Cas into finishing a full plate of Dean’s cooking, might tempt him to smile contently over a plate of hot food and a full stomach.
Dean pulls a face. “It sounds even worse when you put them in the same sentence.”
“Well,” Dean shrugs uncomfortably, not really sure he deserves such a look for kind of doing the bare minimum. “What did
The guy is well-dressed, about the same height as Dean, and wiry. He sizes Dean up, and sneers, “It’s my car.
When the party starts to wrap up, and Sam and Eileen beg off to go to bed, and Dean’s been shuffling closer to Cas on the sofa, inch-by-inch, Jack looks at them both and says, “I’m glad we get a chance to be happy now.”
, Cas’s expression could send ships into Charybdis. It’s cracked right down the middle.
Cas says, after a beat, to cut through all of it, “It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t just about being left behind. Not for me.”
Dean leans closer. He can’t not. “I think about you too. I think about – god, Cas, the things I’ve imagined. I’ve just been too chicken-shit to-”
“There was one time, back when we were dumb kids. I think it was one of the last few summers before I went to Stanford, when Dad dumped us at Bobby’s for a few weeks. We were arguing all the time, about the stupidest of things. And you were watching one of your cowboy movies, and there was some scene where, God, I don’t even know. I think one of the cowboys had a long stare with another cowboy. And I wanted to piss you off, because I
It’s like an overlay effect, and for a second, Dean’s looking at this dark-eyed kid and he sees his own green eyes looking back, defiant and bratty because otherwise he’d look desperate.
He has a split-second to panic, before Cas kisses him back.
She waggles her eyebrows at him. “I know what will make you feel better.”
Dean fights the urge to be sick.
Silence.
Thursday night is quiz night at The Roadhouse. Dean and Cas used to take turns in writing the quizzes, but Dean’s questions were along the lines of “On what Kansas album does the song
“Awesome,” Dean says, with a genuine smile. “The best kind.”
And Dean panics. Like, full-body adrenaline jolt from his toes to his head. The kind of fight-or-flight response that's saved his ass in countless hunts and the kind of bullshitter gut that's saved him from jail or angry exes.
, Dean-”
Dean grips the wood carving so tight he forces himself to put it down, else he snaps the thing in half.
Cassie nods. “There’s one up the road, near the centre of town. But we still need to track down the nest.”
He’s happy. It’s nice to acknowledge, sometimes.
She holds her hands up in surrender. “Fine! Fine. I won’t pry – but at some point, we have to give in to the stereotype and get drunk off mimosas.”
She passes them a business card with the name, ‘Michaela’ and an Illinois cell number underneath it. Dean doesn’t waste anytime as they get back to the car, and he dials the number.
“The ‘
Dean turns his face to kiss Cas’s cheek, for all the words he can’t say out loud. “You deserve the best of both,” he says, low and private. “You do, for all you’ve done for heaven and humanity. You deserve to fly, and you deserve to rest when you come home.”
in twelve hours, and he thinks he can be forgiven for not yet running down the corridor naked apart from a rainbow flag tied around his private parts. He will come to terms with it, eventually. Maybe with more of those amazing hand jobs - maybe Cas can train him like that, can train him to be more gay. He gets lost for a little bit imagining that particular regime.
Fuck that. Fuck that right off. Dean gets to his feet as well, and sneers, “Right. Sure, frustration at the ‘situation.’ Just fucking say it!” Cas doesn’t respond, and Dean goes for the throat. He can’t help it. He can’t not. He lets out a mean scoff, and says, “What the fuck ever. Maybe if you had
“Oh,” says Dean, faintly. The thought – the image of what Cas must be seeing – makes his stomach tight with lust. He squeezes around Cas’s fingers and moans at the sensation, the realisation of how much of Cas is already inside of him. Now he's concentrating, he feels when Cas adds another finger, stretching him loose. He starts chanting nonsense pleas. “Fuck, Cas, honey, you gotta – you’ve got to get inside me right now. I need you.”
“Really,” says Cas. “I apologise for not sharing this with you all. I understand keeping secrets is a sore spot for a number of you, due to all your individual trauma.”
“Fourth year is fruit or veg,” he finishes. “I, um. I suppose I was hoping it wouldn’t be too late to celebrate them all. With you, I mean.”
Cas stares him down. “Dean, why haven’t you been driving the Impala?”
He has to- he has to get up.
But she’s always been more patient than him.
Dean stares at the empty space, and then nods to himself. He lets out a deep sigh, and then smacks, once, against the steering wheel. He starts the ignition with heavy dread pulling his heart down to his stomach.
soft. Like freshly washed fur, or velvet. It reminds Dean of what he felt in the Empty – but the static charge has gone, at least. The water cascading over him doesn’t shift his shape like fur would, but it feels damp to the touch when Dean helps clean him with gentle strokes.
“Jesus,” says Sam, and Dean flops back onto the sofa. Fuck it. “Dean, what the hell happened?”
Sam doesn’t say anything for a second long enough for the panic to rise out of Dean like bile. “We won’t be far,” he says urgently. “Just an hour away, a second away if Cas flies us. And we’re building a couple of spare rooms – you and Eileen could stay with us when you want. Or I could build you guys a house next door. We have the land to spare. Or I don’t need to go.” The longer Sam stays quiet, the longer the latter sounds the best idea. “I won’t go. It was – it’s stupid. The bunker’s great. We’re fine here. Forget I said anything.”
And somehow, Dean Winchester managed to fuck up something as simple as a blowjob.
Cas gives him this eye, like he
Still, he stares at the spot, as if waiting long enough will make the bee reappear. He’s lost in that moment, eyes wide and lips parted.
He’s caught on the thought as they round the corner, and so that’ll be his excuse, if anyone ever asks him, as to why it takes him a moment to recognise one of the two women by the body.
They’re just – they’re just doing their own thing. It’s nice.
His other bout of luck is when he comes into the interview and the manager, who reminds him almost unbearably of Ellen, has a tour poster of Kansas and a half-eaten pie on her office desk.
keys.”
“You killed yourself!” Dean shouts, and then stops, breathing heavily. He says, forcibly steadier, “Do you think I ever wanted to be saved like that? You think anything was worth that? Your fucking – it was suicide, Cas!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean nudges him with his shoulder.
“Whatever. The point is that this will fix the bird problem! So even if, in the future, maybe one of us, like it could be me or could be you,
Cas shakes his head. “Doesn’t mean I didn’t experiment.”
Claire, for her part, pretends to be shocked. “Are you
“It is unreasonable,” Cas will reply when Dean points that out. “You’re just trigger happy. And cranky. Sam would never shoot me
Dean completes a short course to get his basic car mechanic qualifications. Sam offers to fake the certificate, but Dean won’t let him, says he needs to make sure he’s not missing anything. And anyway, he says with a smirk, “It’ll be great to show up the teacher if they get anything wrong.”
He’s so busy arguing with Sam about which state Bigfoot originated in that it takes him a second to realise Cas isn’t next to them.
And Dean stills. His grip slackens into just a loose cup around the base, resting on the wiry hair there.
Dean nods slowly. “I figured – if you don’t sleep, can’t imagine there’s much room for ‘em.”
way of shutting him up.)
Cas moans at the touch, and his body arches forward. He looks like porn personified – better, even, with his exposed jugular and heaving torso. Dean can’t resist leaning into bite at his neck again, sucking at the skin until a bruise blooms there, large and obvious. “Sweetheart,” Dean says again. “Please, fuck, you’re so hot. Please show me.”
. And it all got fucked up in my head. And so, when we were together, no matter how much I wanted it, wanted you, it couldn’t be real because of who I’d been with before. And if it wasn’t real, I couldn’t – I couldn’t accept it.”
He rushes through the storeroom swing doors, and sees, in all his drunkard, ugly glory, Dick, standing in front of Claire, who’s tiny but determined and yelling at him. Everyone’s yelling, actually, and he can't find the source, until.
He sleeps on the sofa most nights because he can’t bear to be alone on their bedroom, and it doesn’t seem fair to muss up Jack’s or the guest bedroom. (He wonders, when he’s feeling particularly low, whether Cas got full custody of Jack in the split. It makes sense, he doesn’t begrudge him that – but still, he might like weekends, or maybe a couple of days a month. Maybe every other national holiday.)
He gives up. Fuck his life anyway for trying to hide something from an angel with true sight and multi-planal vision and silent fluffy slippers.
“Whatever. I don’t think I went back to the same beach, then, if it was St. Pete back then.”
“You smoke now?” she asks dubiously.
“You’re usually so calm when someone you love is injured or sick,” says Sam.
It’s not like Dean can admit it, though. He’s sure as hell not going to say the whole truth, which is that every day that goes by that they’re not having sex, that Dean can’t do this one thing for Cas, is another day of spiralling into panic. Another day of Cas noticing the tension, tilting his head and getting closer to asking what’s wrong.
Eventually, after the opening credits, the episode starts for real and opens on a tearful conversation between Bethany and Dr. Sexy. He tells her that of course he cares for her, but he needs some time to figure something out. She asks if it’s an excuse, and he assures her, “No, I mean it – this is something I need to understand
, you worried me. You really scared me. Can you just indulge me a little longer? Please?”
“That Dr Sexy was gay?” Dean says, smart as anything before instantly regretting it. He lets out an exhale, and comes to sit down, leaving space between them on the couch. “No, sorry, I know what you meant. It’s not – I mean, Cas, it’s not like I’ve been marching at Pride every week. I learned about homosexuality from sucking dick for cash. My dad made me burn the bones of two lesbian nuns as a birthday gift. Charlie and Claire, even Jesse – I didn’t know there was something other than, you know, each end of the spectrum. If anyone mentioned it, I wasn’t listening.”
“He didn’t say why, though.”
Dean elbows him and says, “Shut up. I can apologise.”
Dean’s hand reaches down and wraps around himself. He starts to jerk off in the warm shower, heart beating faster as he hides his face in the crook of his elbow. He thinks of Cas, and the sounds he’d make. Cas is already vocal, but not like women, not like the porn stars. Like
Cas hums in agreement. “I want to do that again.”
on his bedroom bookshelf. He won’t judge Dean.
Cas squints. “Is it supposed to be me?”
He doesn’t know what country Cas is actually from - he thinks it’s Russia, but Cas, for whatever reason, doesn’t like to talk about it. He knows his name was Castiel Milton (Castiel Winchester, now), but he doesn’t know what kind of parents name their kid after the saint of Thursdays. He doesn’t know how old, exactly, Cas is, but he says his birthday is September 19th, so that’s what they’ve been celebrating for ten years now.
Dean reaches out to pinch one of the leaves between his fingers. Not seaweed - but the waves of the trailing leaves resemble it. “What is it?”
“Come on, sweetheart,” Dean pants into Cas’s neck. “Come now for me, and next time you can come on my freckles anywhere you want, I promise.”
Dean grips him a little tighter. “Answer me!”
Dean stands – they’re so close that the movement drags his torso up along the length of Cas’s. His hands float over Cas’s bared arms, before bailing, turning, and pulling his own plaid overshirt away. His is less of a ritual, but Cas’s eyes are hot on him anyway. Dean reaches behind him and tugs his t-shirt up over his head, and then twists his jeans until they’re falling too. He’s not wearing boots, so they’re easy to shuffle out of, along with his socks.
He hears a small breath from the cat-shaped angel now resting on his arm. Dean can’t help it – he lets out a little huff of laughter, and Cas freezes on top of him, caught out.
“You have a
“If it was, Derek hadn’t told any of his friends who she was. Neighbours weren’t awake in the night and they never saw anything out of the ordinary.”
“Thank you, Michaela, you’ve been really helpful. Have a nice day – we’ll be back in touch if we have anymore questions.” Dean hangs up, and says to Cas excitedly, “I know what it is. Shapeshifter asking permission to come into someone’s house to feed messily? It has to be a rakshasa.”
The kid narrows his eyes. “I don’t need your pity.”
He admits that to Cas one night, when the David Attenborough documentary is narrating a story about some gay penguins or whatever and Cas’s feet are thrown into Dean’s lap like that’ll make him give in to foot rubs.
Cas lets out a deep sigh, looks over his shoulder to make sure no one is listening around the doorway, and pulls Dean to him. He grabs onto Dean’s jaw with one hand and tugs him into a kiss. Which, Dean resents the idea that it would distract him, except it kind of does.
, you’re-” Cas is babbling above him, and Dean starts to rock his own head, sucking and lapping, and builds a wet rhythm.
“Well, we didn’t kill him. I didn’t. But I- he’s gone. There’s nothing – he’s defeated. Everything’s sorted. Jack is God now, actually.”
But he doesn’t move. He can’t – it’s as impossible as if someone had driven nails through his feet. (That was year seven in hell, he believes, when his torture went through a particularly Judeo-Christian phase. Alistair enjoyed irony.)
Luckily, Cas makes the decision for them both. He leads them into their bedroom and pushes at Dean’s overshirt until it floats the floor. He unbuckles his jeans and pushes them down too. He takes his own shirt off, and kicks off his own pants, and then he pushes Dean towards the bed, underneath the covers. He slides in behind Dean, slots them together like Jack’s Lego pieces, with his knees fitting between Dean’s legs and his arms slung over Dean’s ribs.
Cas stares at him for a long moment, long enough that Dean would start to feel self-conscious if it weren’t for the lust painted across Cas’s expression. Cas’s bottom lip falls open, and he says, gravel-deep, “I would bite the apple every time if you were the tempting snake.”
Dean blinks.
To which Rosanna looks him up and down and says, “Well, we’ll see. There’s a first time for anything.”
“Because he was already saving me,” says Cas, defensive of his son to the end.
He’s seen this episode before.
“Right,” says Dean, still not looking up.
, was only a friendship up until three months ago.”
“Right, well.” And that’s all Dean’s got. Luckily, they pull back into their home, and he says, “Welcome home, honey.”
Cas tilts his head. “What does it look like?”
But then again. Dean takes hold of his hand and brings him back to bed. Then again, they really have.
“No promises,” says Dean, already imagining how he can get Cas to stay on the couch for another couple of weeks. Cas’s arm tightens around him, like he can tell exactly what he’s thinking.
“Right,” says Sam. He leans in the doorway, part casual and part blocking Dean from escaping. Fucker. “Same old story. Tell me, did he lose his memory again? Or were you demonic, or controlled by a demonic curse? I’m losing track.”
He shakes. His hands are empty. He desperately looks around, as if Cas might be hiding from him, and calls out, hoarse, “
. You promised you’d never leave again.”
“I like this one,” he says. “I love it. I love
“So,” Cas says, as Dean begins serving up a tower of pancakes for them all to eat from. “Defeating Chuck still left monsters to hunt?”
His face is cat-like, with a pointed chin, the ears and the massive eyes, but it has strange, eldritch additions, like extra specks of glowing blue on his forehead, and a jet-black tongue rather than the normal pink. He doesn’t have whiskers, either. His body too, isn’t quite a cat, more cloudlike and diffused, constantly shifting like an ink spill or a cloud. He doesn’t have a tail, and he sometimes has legs, depending on whether he needs them, or they can curl back into the cloud of his body.
Dean knows he’s being played. He knows it. Like a fucking fiddle. And yet - “Okay, no. You’re not taking that beige monster on a
Cas tilts his head, and Dean could start crying again for how much it proves, unequivocally, that this is
Dean stares at the bag. The rings beat a guilty brand against his ribs. “I hope so,” he says.
Dean’s trembling as he puts the keys to the door. He’s so fucking stupid, is what he is. He hates this, hates Cas for doing this, hates himself for not being able to explain. He slots the keys in, and twists, and pulls the door open. The driver’s seat waits for him.
He puts on jeans and his cleanest plaid shirt, and then Dean walks outside, just as the sun rises enough to bath everything in long shadows and warm gold. He hikes his pants up enough to have some give and then he gets on his knees, right outside their home in the grass and dry dirt. He puts his hands together, then thinks better of it and shakes them out loose by his side.
Dean stares at his beer. He’s not sure what to make of the comparison; his brain seems to be stuck on a cog and not reaching anything useful.
Dean swallows. He tries to think of the right thing to say and decides to go for honesty. “I would have loved to wear your grace,” he says. “And I love you as a human or angel or in between.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “Me too.”
?” Dean squints, the word making his face contort.
proud of.
“The Julia Roberts film? 1991, too. Why?”
He swallows. “Uh.”
Some of it, Dean asks Cas about. Part-teasing and part-awestruck. When they’re in the local supermarket, picking out jackfruit and spices and mincemeat, Dean asks, “Did you love me in Purgatory?”
“Then don’t.” Dean reaches and grabs onto Cas’s face, brings his knees up to grip Cas between them. “Okay, just
“How many have you abandoned?”
, who Dean wants as far from his sexuality as possible. But it’s not the worst, he guesses. Claire declares she already knew, and Benny claps him on the back and then goes back to beating his ass at snooker. Eileen hugs him very tight, and Dean is glad again to have a sister-in-law.
“Hey, Dean?” Sam says, in a voice that maybe suggests it’s not the first time. He clicks his fingers, and Dean snaps back to the paper. His ears feel hot.
ask you to.”
Dean switches off the TV in a panic, as fast as if a ghoul had appeared behind it and the remote was a gun. He looks around, but Miracle is still asleep, and also a dog, so probably not an accurate witness. He swallows and flexes his fingers on his thighs to untighten them.
Cas’s expression scrunches in memory, and he hides his face in the pillow, pushing Dean’s hand into his hair with the moment. Dean doesn’t mind – he just threads his fingers through dark hair and keeps stroking, keeps making small ‘shush’ sounds of comfort.
“A lot of your TV choices do make more sense,” she says, thoughtfully. Then she replays some of his phrasing, and adds, “When you say you should take more time to think about it – exactly when did you come to this realisation?”
“If Jo was going to be kicked out of the country,” she signs, more patiently than the situation calls for. “Would you marry her?”
Dean shrugs. “I’m sure they were similar enough.”
He swallows and turns back to Cas. He crouches down beside him, and ignores the silence of the bar, and Dick’s shaking groans, and Claire’s expression. Cas has thrown up again, so Dean takes the near-full tub and leans over the bar to empty it. He puts it back in Cas’s lap, and says, “Cas? Can you hear me?”
Dean points his fork at him. “If the whiskers fit, dude.”
He expects the house to look different. But it’s still there, with the bricks they laid and the garden they dug. There’s a windchime hanging on the front porch in the shape of fairies – a joke from Sam that Dean still isn’t sure whether he should be offended by or not.
Dean rolls his eyes, and snatches the whiskey bottle from him, chucking it into the same plastic bag he’s been putting the others in. Perhaps he’ll vacuum later today – that’ll be a fun way to waste away an hour.
But whenever it’s the hint of getting closer – or worse, when Dean starts kissing him with the
Dean waves a hand. “It’s fine. I’m fine - it’s not worth it.”
It’s been a week since Cas came back. A week of not leaving each other for longer than their bathroom breaks and occasionally leaving a room for a moment before the other follows. The longest they’ve been apart is when Cas and Jack went on a walk around the fields of the bunker for a private catch-up, and Dean decided then was the perfect time to get the weed-whackers out for a touch-up, and maybe the weeds that needed whacking were the ones where he could keep an eye on two figures in the distance. But, you know, coincidences and all that.
“There’s a few, but nothing we can’t handle,” Sam replies, pulling a plate towards himself. “Demons and angels seem to be sticking in their own realms.”
It’s like when he was a kid, and they’d finally stay at a motel with a TV waiting for them. Except now, he doesn’t need to press rewind. He doesn’t have to miss anything when his dad comes home and demands he switches it off.
For some reason, Sam shifts guiltily, and Dean instantly decides to not touch that with a ten-foot stick. “Uh, yeah. Anyway – when are you thinking of moving?”
And his thumb skitters across the screen and he drops his phone – luckily, the screen doesn’t crack further, and Cas isn’t here to make a ‘told you so’ expression – and he tucks it away into his jacket. He stands, collects and pays for his order, and ignores the way his ears burn from paranoia. He shuffles back to the Impala and takes a moment to rest his forehead on Baby’s steering wheel. She waits for him patiently.
“I cheated a little with my grace,” Cas admits in return, like it’s a secret and not incredibly obvious from the bright red raspberries grown from barren earth within two weeks.
"Yeah," Dean continues because he's a masochist like that. "I, um. I just don't like labels."
That- that doesn’t make any sense. “What?”
He can’t take Baby out for a spin. He can’t go to a bar and fuck the nearest, hottest, available woman. He can’t even go get a drink because Cas keeps going on at him about cutting down his alcohol intake. He’s stuck out here in the life he and Cas have committed to.
“It damn well was, and we both know it.” Cas leans his weight insistently against Dean, all up in his space. “Now, please explain to me-”
“It’s a coincidence!”
, Claire, are you crazy? Take Baby.”
and he laughed around a snickers bar. Of course he has a soul, and so much goddamn love in him that Dean sometimes thinks he’s wasted it on a poisonous mess like him.
Cas licks his lips, and shuffles closer again. He pillows a hand underneath his head as he says, “You’ve pushed me away as often as I’ve left, Dean.”
“Do you want to?” Dean asks, hush-quiet, before he can worry about it.
“Thank you, Dean,” replies Cas, sincere and gravelly for it.
His brother's eyes widen, just a little, before he schools his expression into something more neutral. "Right," he says, slowly.
So, Dean starts researching. In private because he doesn’t want to risk Sam getting involved. (He doesn’t want to risk Sam telling him it’s a stupid idea, that it’s hopeless. No, he doesn’t want that.) He scours over the books in the library in the hours where he’s not sleeping anyway, and scuttles away with his laptop in his room when he’s actually expected to be awake. He prays – to Cas, to Jack, to anyone who’s listening. He even calls up Rowena, who at least
. I am expressing frustration at the situation. Not everything is about you, Dean.”
“Please,” Cas says, sitting next to Eileen and bumping his shoulder against hers companionably.
Cas nods, ignoring both that and Jo’s responding middle finger. “And
“Dean,” levels Charlie, unimpressed.
Dean can’t argue with that. “Me too! So, I can come too. We’ll make a trip out of it.”
The real shift came when Ellen announced she was selling The Roadhouse, and Jo didn’t want it.
He realises he’s crying in the same second Cas looks punched in the gut, as he aborts a gesture as if he wants to reach and wipes the tears from Dean’s cheeks.
“Dean Winchester, I can count on one hand the times you’ve apologised to me.”
Their noses brush up against each other again as Dean nods. “Yeah,” he says. “I accept.”
guys. But screw it, his partner
The truth is – Cas is not
“Nah,” Dean disagrees anyway. “You’re just green-thumbed like that.”
Cas takes a step back to squint at it with fresh eyes. “I was hoping in the bathroom. Lots of natural light, and we won’t need to water it ourselves with the humidity.”
He whispers, “I think I was supposed to get you gold. Or - or there was tungsten, but that didn’t sound very - I don’t know.” He swallows, and the night carries the burden of his confession, and he continues, “Silver is supposed to defend against monsters. That’s what I heard, growing up. Against vampires and werewolves and ghosts. So, you’re getting silver, buddy. Gold ain’t good to fight with.”
He cleans the dishes and thinks,
Dean doesn’t get the point of the story. Usually, any childhood memories they share are brief before they get tense. A quick ‘at least someone else knows my particular brand of fucked up’ and then move on to lighter things. This is different territory.
Cas takes a moment to think. (He hasn’t moved, by the way, from his towel nest.) (The effect is kind of adorable.) “I’m not entirely sure,” he admits, slowly. “I haven’t been in this form before. My true form is-”
Cas pulls a face. “I didn’t notice any ‘rack,’” he says, distastefully at the phrasing. Dean folds his arms rather than break. “But if you’re talking about the woman who was flirting with me - she was very nice, and she liked my wooden carving.”
“Are you alright?”
Nodding, Cas says thoughtfully, “That makes sense. If it’s from Heaven, it might have been designed to repel human understanding.”
Cas looks a little starry-eyed but complies regardless. He shucks away the trench coat and then the suit jacket too, and starts to fidget with his tie, the knot tightened by Dean’s previous yanking. He seems to have forgotten about the whole angel-mojo, snap-of-the-fingers deal, but Dean is loathe to remind him, not when he’s got front row tickets to this particular show. Cas tries to multi-task, tries to kick off his Oxfords at the same time as yanking at his shirt buttons, and he tries to pull the shirt over his head too soon, and gets a little stuck in the arms and the collar.
He thinks about Lee, and Benny, and Aaron. Even Henricksen, fuck, he
Dean rolls his eyes. “I’m fine, Sammy. It was mutual. We gave it a try, it didn’t work, Cas left again. Same old story.”
And then all hell breaks loose.
Something flickers across Cas’s face, too sad and too quick for Dean to catch. Jack nods fast and eager, and says excitedly, “Yes! We’re real. Corporeal, too.”
One night, where he can feel his skin tight across his bones and his head pounding from dehydration-exhaustion-everything, he sits on the floor in the dungeon -
– Dean, your freckles.”
“Not possible,” grouches Dean. “And it’s ‘trash TV.’ Not garbage.”
His gaze travels slowly up the trench coat, the tucked-in shirt and the twisted blue tie, all the way up to Cas’s face.
Dean cries through the ceremony and will ferociously deny it to anyone who brings it up. (Claire also cries, but everyone is already too scared to bring it up to her.) Rowena gets drunk and tells anyone who’ll listen that she taught both Winchester boys how to be gay, and Charlie manages to make a playlist that spells out a Princess Leia pun. Sam makes a best man speech that brings the whole damn room to tears. Cas drags Dean onto the floor for a slow dance that Dean only pretends to be embarrassed by.
annoying about it that I hope you do work things out.”
For Dean, he works out pretty quickly that if he wants to be honest with Cas, as they’ve vowed to be with each other, he needs to be honest with
Dean tries to answer honestly, and picks at a torn thread on his jeans as he admits, “Meg pissed me off. I didn’t like her hands on you, or the way she kissed you. I don’t know. At the time, I thought that was from, like, a moral perspective. Didn’t want anyone messing you up.”
“Whatever,” says Dean. “I’m pretty sure I’ve said worse to you, so I’ve probably forfeited my rainbow pass myself.”
Dean frowns, twists his chin to stare at his little brother. “What? But she’s awesome.” At Sam’s wince, his frown deepens. “Unless – she’s not?”
It doesn’t take long before Cas is making desperate, bitten off noises. He gasps, “Like this – ah,
Dean swallows. “Of course I do.”
No, that’s unacceptable. He can’t let that happen.
“Only the ones you remember the name of,” snipes back Sam, and Dean is going to fucking throttle him, he’s going to drive all the way back and strangle his stupid brother to death. “What do you want from me, Dean? She’s a good hunter, and we need more of those. And what did you want me to do?”
Why does she get to be comfortable with it?
Dean finds his hand gripped around the TV remote, with his finger pressed on the pause button and the TV halted accordingly. It’s frozen on Dr Sexy’s face, open and confessional.
be God.”
for him, wraps his arms around him and squeezes him tight. Dean is helpless but to worm into him, press himself all up against him. “You are,” Cas murmurs against his cheek. “Well done, Dean. I’m very proud of you.”
He doesn’t stick around in the morning, and goes to meet Benny instead. He finds him at the farmer’s market, at his fresh fish stall. He’s accustomed to the stink by now, the one that permeates his clothes as Benny stands up to hug him tight. “Glad you came,” says Benny, as he pulls another fold-up chair out for Dan to sit at.
Cas doesn’t move from his perch against Dean’s whole side. “I am,” he says. “I have everything I wanted, and the calm to go along with it. This is – all of this is my happiness.”
Twisting his lips in thought, Sam says, “Maybe. It’s difficult to… when we were kids, I certainly never thought about it. It wasn’t something – I mean, teenagers these days, I think it’s more visible, or open, or something for them to consider and question. Which, you know, is a good thing. But for us – especially with our dad being who he was – I don’t think it was ever even something we were supposed to know about.”
“How are you doing, Cas?”
There’s a pause over the phone.
Cas hums and lets him doze. Before Dean nods off fully, though, Cas mumbles into his hair, like it's a secret, “I love you. You make me very happy.”
“No,” says Dean, barely a grunt.
But for now, he paints an easy smirk on and says, “A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell.”
“Thank you,” he says. He didn’t realise he wanted to hear that until her words settle under his skin and rest there, warming him from the inside. “I mean – it all makes sense. Indiana Jones! Fred from
Dean does know. Of course he does. He knows Cas caught what slipped from him in the heat of the moment, in the humiliation and desperation of the motel room. But admitting it is admitting something else, something too personal and scared and buried deep within him.
It’s in the far back of the establishment, down a couple of corridors, and that’s his excuse for how it gets turned around on the way back. Or maybe he subconsciously wanted some fresh air – admittedly, considering his experience, it’s unusual for him to lose his bearings. Either way, he stumbles out into the back alley, into the cool night air.
Why the
. Dean gives up on trying to scold him. Thank the heavens they chose to keep the wooden flooring rather than put down carpet, really.
He finishes the sandwiches and brings them on the same plate, piled high, into the living room. He stops in the doorway when he sees the scene, though.
"Awesome," Jack breaths, his bangs stuck to his forehead with sweat and his cheeks flushed.
Fuck it.
It’s about the first night they sleep in their own finished bedroom, and they’re both too overwhelmed by the realisation to do anything but hold each other through the night.
to smite you.”
Dean lets him go, still breathing heavy and feeling hollowed out. He hands reach up on their own accord to grip the steering wheel, thick and comforting leather.
Dean pulls Cas out of the bath, and wraps him into a clean towel, and deposits him on a nearby laundry basket. “Stay there,” he warns, with a pointed finger. “I need to wash this shit off as well.”
Cas’s shoulders hunch, just a little. He frowns at his coffee mug. It has a cartoon drawing of the Grand Canyon, a souvenir from their trip two years ago. “I said it would probably be just as nice,” he admits. “I always like having our friends together.”
Cas’s gaze flickers over him, big and blown-out, and a cold rock settles in Dean’s gut at the thought of Cas saying no. But instead, he says, hands tight on each of Dean’s jean-clad ass cheeks, “If you do, yes.”
She rolls her eyes. “If you show up on Monday, sure. But you’re in charge of washing it – I know what you mechanics are like.”
Dean’s voice is wooden as he says, “Who is?”
“You should be used to it - I have done nothing but sacrifice myself at your altar!” Cas snarls. “I’ve rebelled against my God, I’ve slaughtered my own kind, I’ve penanced in purgatory. I took on your brother’s trauma. I have begged for your absolution every step of the way. I have died many times before for you both, for the good of the world.”
“A hub?” Dean repeats, fully aware he’s being ridiculous. Like, from an outside perspective. Unfortunately, the outside perspective is not in the reins right now. “What, you have a group chat? ‘Hey gals, let’s get mojitos, this one’s a wendigo?’”
When the clock hits four, and Dean’s exile officially ends, Dean finds himself stepping back into the apartment carefully. He shuts the door behind him, and calls out, “Hello?”
Nodding, Cas says, “I agree.  I will be Agent Jepsen, and you can be Agent Plant.”
“Nah,” says Sam, and Dean
With everything that’s happened, despite being glued to the TV screen when awake, Dean abruptly realises he’s missed an episode of
Sam huffs. “Sometimes I forget how much our childhood fucked us up,” he says, deliberately lightly. “Then you act like this and it all comes rushing back.”
Dean nods. He does. He knows that. Knows it in his bones, knows it in the grief and joy and relief.
They haven’t been on a hunt since Cas got back. Dean hasn’t gone looking for one, and Sam hasn’t even mentioned any possible cases. And sometimes, Dean gets gripped by guilt about it. Who is he to give up the mission?
But – it’s not that. This kid isn’t – and Dean wasn’t – they’re both so fucking young. Dean was – he wasn’t old enough to – and now –
Bisexual.
“Don’t ask,” pleads Cas, tiredly, as Sam flops with exhaustion into Eileen’s arms. “Please.”
Cas’s hands wander under Dean’s shirt and he thinks,
“It made sense at the time!” Dean complains. “And it wasn’t a
Dean realises they’re just staring at each other a few minutes after they’ve been doing so, and he casts his gaze down to his finished bottle as an escape. He swallows, takes another sip from it to finish off the final drops. He slams the bottle down, back onto the table.
She rolls her eyes. “I sell
He comes across a jeweller’s, a middle-aged woman selling various necklaces and bracelets and shiny things. He comes closer with thoughts of Jo’s birthday coming up - she’s a tough girl, but sometimes he thinks she deserves more delicate things in her life - and then he catches sight of the ring display.
“Sam’s cool with that?”
“Nope.” He shakes his head. “No, that would be down to Eileen and the other jokesters.”
Dean’s hands go roaming, one staying curling in the softness of Cas’s hair whilst the other trails down Cas’s front. An errant thought flutters into Dean’s mind, a freak-out waiting for attention and tapping on his brain like, ‘we gonna talk about this, bud?’ but it disappears in the slick slide of Cas’s lips.
“He should be taught a lesson,” disagrees Cas.
And whenever turns out to be now, because Dean cries out and comes, crests over the edge, and his dick spurts white cum over the sheets below them. Cas’s moan echoes against Dean’s skin, and he keeps pumping Dean’s cock through the aftershocks, and he speeds up until he’s thrusting fast and erratic and desperate, and it’s all Dean can do to stay upright enough to be a good hole for Cas to finish within. Finally, he does, hands gripping tight on Dean’s hips, hopefully enough to bruise, and holds himself deep inside of Dean as he finishes.
Cas rolls his eyes but kisses the available skin of Dean’s elbow anyway. “We should get cleaned up.”
“No, no, come on, I don’t mean the physics of it or whatever. You know that would go over my head anyway.” Cas makes a sound of disagreement, which Dean rolls his eyes at. (Privately, he likes being privy to understand the language of Cas-grumbles.) “I’ve never asked you what you and Jack are up to when you visit up top. Describe it to me. Tell me your favourite part.”
It’s funny, sometimes, how quickly Dean can ruin things.
“Really, this means nothing,” Cas says, as he kneads the flesh of Dean’s shoulder to settle upon. His legs have appeared for this important task, apparently. “I think you’re probably reading too much into this.”
“Dean,” Cas says again, sounding like his heart is breaking, right there in between them both. “Dean, that’s all I’ve ever wanted. Just you.”
Groaning, Cas slumps back into the sofa and hides his eyes in one hand. “You’re clearly very attracted to the titular character. I don’t like you being attracted to anyone but me. It’s not an emotion I’m proud of, believe me.”
He deigns not to rise to that and instead focuses on finishing the gifted cigarette as she clops back into the house.
“That well,” corrects Sam. “There’s so much to all put down. I mean – so much of this stuff will hopefully never come up, not now. I’ve got documents on Gabriel and Crowley and Abaddon. Chuck, even. But it’s kind of good to… to write it all out.”
He's too busy staring at his tense knuckles to realise his little brother has scooted round the counter, and then he's pulled into a sasquatch hug, complete with a thump on the back and a calmly said, "I accept you, Dean, and I'm proud of you."
Dean can feel his blood rushing in his ears.
“It’s my fault,” says Dean. His eyes cut to Sam, quick, guilty, before back to the wood. “That Cas was hurt, I mean.”
And Dean’s just an idiot staring at his reflection with his wilting dick in his hand.
“Yes,” says Dean, because it is the truth, something
“Yeah.” He’s thankful for the excuse. It’s not a lie, anyway.
Dean winces. She at least looks a little apologetic for that particular dig, but he guesses he can’t blame her. He lets loose a gust of air, and says, probably way too late, “Uh, Cassie, this is Castiel.”
“He propositioned me a year into that friendship,” says Cas, because he is a
Cas presses a kiss against the nape of Dean’s neck, and then the hand on his abdomen sinks lower to wrap around Dean’s cock. Dean doesn’t bite back his groan in time, and it reverberates through them both. Cas starts to pump his dick, and he speeds up his thrusts, his hips slapping into Dean’s ass on each pump. He tilts just right and skates across that magic button inside of Dean, and he whispers, hot breath skating across Dean’s ear, “Let it go. Come whenever you want, my love.”
She winks. “You speak my language, Favourite Winchester.”
Dean glowers back. “If I say you are, will you bring back three plants to spite me?”
“Nothing,” says Dean, waving his hand through the air oh-so-casually. “It’s all good. It’s a Sunday, can’t a man have a hangover in peace?”
. So I didn’t know the way I felt was possible! Ergo, now I do. Now I have a label for it. It all makes sense now!”
So, here he is, in between his boyfriend and his co-worker, and snorting into his drink as José retells the apparently devastating argument of the pink walls. He lets his hand rest on Cas’s thigh, steady and warm.
“Sorry,” says Jack, not particularly sounding it. “I heard you praying.”
But Sam isn’t so easily convinced. He squints at Dean, and asks, “What’cha got there?”
Meera, who has long dark hair, darker eyes, and a nose piercing, pulls an appraising face. “Oh,” she says. “
, small business et cetera, can we focus up here?”
For fuck’s sake, he basically
“I mean – I mean you are
“Like you wouldn’t be the same if- if Benny and Jo got married!” Charlies gestures.
“That’s what I’m thinking,” says Sam. “Like how you guys can hide your wings to stop human eyes from burning out.”
“That was okay, right?” Dean asks before he means to.
Before he can think it through, he slides it onto the finger it belongs on. It fits, snug and perfect, against the meat between Cas’ knuckles.
He slicks himself up and lets out a small sharp breath at the feel of it. Fuck, it’s been a while. He strokes, not too fast or tight, not yet, and watches the sight of a cock sink in and out of a plush mouth. On screen, the blowjob gets sloppy, spit and tongue slipping out of Ryan’s mouth as he gets into it, his eyes closed in pleasure.
It’s fine. Dean just needs some more time to get comfortable with being gay, get over his hang ups and fresh frigidity. It’s totally fine.
(For the first week, every time he gets underneath a hood, he swears he can hear Bobby’s voice. One time, he sprays himself with stale oil after freeing the blockage, and standing there, dripping in it, he mutters to himself, “Idjit,” and promptly feels grief seizing his heart like a real fist.)
me, I needed you to
Cas nods. “I enjoyed her company on Earth, in the instances when we were able to speak. In Heaven, I find her even easier to talk to. I find she is more… settled, perhaps. Less angry, certainly, at what she had to give up in her life.”
Jack shakes his head, and closes his eyes for a singular focused second, before they snap back open. “No worries, I just put new ones on. They’re
Dean is already compiling a list of suspects in his head, and he glances over to see Cas staring at the wall with a similar look of contemplation. “And the victims?” Dean asks.
Cas doesn’t look back at him. “He is a child, and he should still be one.”
Cas swallows, and then crouches, so now he’s the one looking up. Great. Dean needed a visual metaphor for bringing an angel down to his level, that’s perfect. Dean realises his breath is starting to come fast and hissed between tight lips.
to hold a gun to his head, to react with distrust and violence in the way he did. He starts texting Cassie, and somehow ends up on a text thread with her, Meera, Sam, and Donna for some reason, and starts developing fucking ‘in-jokes’ and carefully selected gifs.
They congregate in a room Sam originally converted as a reaction to the Dean Cave but has since been accommodated into simply being the living room of the bunker. It’s filled with thrift-store furniture and artifacts tested to be duds and now hung up on the wall. Dean manages to harry Cas onto the couch and himself next to him, totally casual, with an arm leaned over the back so he can twist towards the whole group.
“Oh my god,” Dean says. His gun clatters to the floor as his hands go limp. “Oh my god.” He knows that voice. He knows that grumpiness. “
He ducks his chin and presses a soft kiss against Cas’s lips.

“A fishbone cactus,” says Cas. “They’re from the Mexican rainforest.”

“Yep,” Dean agrees happily. They lie there for a little bit longer in silence, and then Dean realises he has never actually asked. “So, what is it like in Heaven?”
“At least I go to therapy.”
it. Who I can struggle with, rather than hide it from, like I hid it from Jess and Amelia.” Sam shakes his head. “I don’t know why I’m bringing this up. I just want to say, I don’t know. I think you and Cas really care for each other. And you’ve both been
With Cas's other hand, while he still fucks him deep, he wraps a sweaty hand around Dean’s dick, and Dean writhes. He’s chanting now, a stream of pleas, and then Cas tugs, jerks him off fast, and Dean is
No such luck.
“Yeah,” he says, nodding. He didn’t sleep much last night – he’s a little hyper. “I mean – maybe I should take some time to think about it. But it just – it feels – it makes
Dean deflates, all at once. “Fine.” he says, before he holds a finger up at Eileen to stop her celebrating too soon. “We can have a little get-together. But it’s not - it’s not going to be a
For a moment, Dean is filled with doubt. This coat - it's meant a lot. Sometimes, it's been the only way to know it's truly Cas he's been talking to, rather than an amnesiac or a batshit version of himself or even fucking Lucifer. Sometimes, it's been the only thing left of him.
love her, Dean. I know that. Don’t invalidate that, even if you think it will flatter me.”
“Okay, Dick,” says Dean. “Come on, let’s go sit down.” The man staggers, and Dean has to catch his weight a little bit, wrapping his hand around Dick’s arm.
Dean scoffs. Played your hand too early, there, Sammy. If he’d waited for Dean to sober up just a little bit more, that might have hurt him. Or, he could have interrogated Dean a little harder, and then countered with what Cas said, caught Dean in a lie. But this? This, Dean expected. Of course, the two of them have been gossiping behind his back.
- or he thought he did- but now he loves-
“I wore a cheap, novelty Stetson hat for you,” Cas snarls, cushion raised above his head for another swing. “I watched
“I hate it when you try matchmaking me,” he complains over his beer. “Last time you set me up with one of your friends, she painted my walls pink when I was at work.”
The option in question has a nice smile, with white teeth and stretched lips. He’s objectively attractive, with sun-bleached hair and deep brown eyes. In his profile, he declares he loves good beer and vintage music and beach trips. Dean’s thumb hovers above the ‘no’ option, a red X button.
Cas pulls back too soon with a smack and presses one more close-lipped kiss to Dean’s dumbstruck lips before he sits back. His blue eyes are shining bright and happy.
, dumbass,” Dean bites, and he gestures to Cas. “For fuck’s sake, Cas, you’re the one who wants me to be gay!”
Dean’s knuckles clench around the Death Valley mug. "You're so goddamn annoying."
“Sure,” replies Sam, in a weird voice. “But, uh, we actually moved on from that question.”
“I’d,” Dean licks across his bottom lip. “I would like that a lot.”
“I can’t have done if I love
Cas lets out a small noise, from the back of his throat, and Dean kisses it away, his hands clasping Cas’s face tight to keep him where he wants. He licks into Cas’s mouth, and the kiss twists desperate and frantic. Cas’s hands claw symbols into Dean’s back and he sighs a hopeless, “
that tone of voice, “More like a new version of Dad’s journal. Speaking of, I found your entry on Castiel the other day. You spent a lot of time on that drawing, huh?”
They’ve migrated closer and closer on the couch, crumb-covered plate left on the coffee table. Dean has his arm over the back of the couch and Cas is nestled into him, one leg sprawled over his lap so Dean can hold onto his thigh. It probably shouldn’t be comfortable, but somehow it is.
He clicks the ‘gay’ category and then there’s a million further subcategories. He watches as much porn as the next guy, but he has no clue what the difference between twinks and hunks and jocks and amateurs, other than in some context or another he’s been referred to by a stranger as each one.
They both don’t say anything about it, not even as Dean carries Cas all the way into Dean’s room. Cas does make a little –
He clambers in and reaches over Cas’s shoulder, pulling him close and trying to tempt him away from the game. (It does not work.)
“Exactly!” Dean says, before he recognises the sarcasm. “Wait. The hell is that supposed to mean?”
Cas frowns. “Are you planning on trying to sleep with Cassie?”
He’s gorgeous. He’s the best thing Dean’s ever seen, a beautiful cock with hair at the base and a desperate, damp head pointing up towards him. Dean dares another glance up, and Cas looks at him like the feeling is mutual. Like Dean is worthy of reverence. Dean feels – he feels powerful. He leans forward and gently opens his mouth around the head, lets it bob inside his mouth and get used to the heat. Cas lets out a desperate, shuddering moan above him, and Dean grabs onto his spasming hand to place it in his hair. Cas lets out another sweet gasp at that too, and his fingers scritch against Dean’s scalp. Not hard, or demanding, just there and present.
Cas ignores him. “On Earth, I have always had to take a vessel. I don’t know what’s different here. My best guess is that something happened, either in the Empty or during your rescue, that affected my form. But I don’t know what.”
He can almost
“I’m well aware!” Dean grits his teeth, and then runs a hand through his hair. “Look, Sam. I tried. I tried to- to love him. Tried to give him a house, and a bed, and- and all the rest. And it wasn’t enough, so he left. Like he always does. I’ll get over it.”
The silence continues, permeating in the darkness of the unlit apartment, until the door suddenly swings open and Dean has to catch on the arch to stop himself falling forward. There’s the flick of a switch, and the bedroom light illuminates them both from within, and Dean squints against it.
Somehow, despite Dean’s protest, the party Sam and Eileen host two weeks later gets named as the ‘Dean-Cas Belated Wedding Reception’.
weird, Dean.”
"Alright, Samantha, cool it."
“No, no,” Cas shuffles close, close enough to cup his palm against Dean’s jaw. “We will be honest with each other, and that means being kind to each other. I meant what I said. There is nothing to be ashamed of, Dean. Nothing to be scared of. I just want to know what you
, and Meera gives them an easy salute before following her.
Dean watches the door. His gaze is stuck on it, actually, with his fists clenched by his side. He can feel the fight itching under his skin, ready to be unleashed. He waits for Cas to come storming back so they can fight, so Cas can hit him and Dean can push him to the floor.
Really, he didn’t. Who was going to teach him?
He spends the night and most of the day thinking it all through. He reads other articles, and goes on Reddit, and just scrolls through endless posts. Some of them make sense and some of them don’t. Some hit so close to the bone he starts to sweat.
But ultimately, he can’t untangle it from his want for Cas, because when he follows the thought, when he tries to imagine Dr Sexy’s stubble against his neck or shoving a hand down his hospital scrubs – it’s tinged with guilt. He tries to remember how he felt before. He never masturbated to Dr Sexy. Well, that’s a lie, he remembers in a flash. He’s jerked off a few times imagining Dr Sexy fucking another woman, but that’s different. That’s not – the woman was attractive too, on each occasion. That’s situational. Like jerking off to a fantasy of a cowboy fucking a local hooker, or some of the weirder tentacle stuff he’s watched. That’s just flavour, a story to indulge himself when he really has the time to devote to his dick, when he doesn’t have to rub one out in the motel bathroom before Sam comes back with burgers. That’s not
He skids round the corner and yells out, “Cas!”
But then Cas comes downstairs in his pyjamas and all hopes for fresh conversation float away.
“You’re pretty great, you know that?” says Dean, instead of everything else he could have.
It’s only when he reaches it and sees that it’s empty, that he realises how lucky he is, and debauched he probably looks. He grabs a glass of water, slurps it down and wipes across his mouth. He runs a hand through his hair, and wonders if he looks at dazed as he feels.
. Dean blinks up at him, somewhere between shock and mounting dread. Cas is fumbling with his pants, pulling his boxers up and then his jeans too. “Just, wait a minute,” Cas says, breathing heavily. He zips up, and Dean feels the whole evening run away from him. “What- what was that? What happened? Did I say something wrong?”
, Dean mouths from his side of the couch. Cas waves him away.
The fight goes out of him, and Dean scuffs his heel into the carpet.
. “Look. I didn’t – I couldn’t accept that I wanted it – you – too. The only way it made sense in my head was if – if it was
He even-
“Forgive me for being a little surprised that Cassie – who, last time I checked, was a
The other man – huge, tattooed, burly, someone whom Dean might have tried to pick a fight in his twenties’ – reaches down to pull Ryan to standing, and then pushes him towards the conveniently nearby couch. Ryan, as if he knows what to expect, lands awkwardly but then repositions with his knees on the cushion, spine arched, and elbows resting on the couch’s back.
He throws a (good-natured!) middle finger in her direction, and explains, “We first met twelve years ago, is what Cas means.”
, about car maintenance, and he
He doesn’t know how long he’s got left of it, really. Before Cas wises up to Dean’s bullshit – before Heaven has a new crisis, or even just becomes too interesting to leave behind. He shouldn’t be messing it up like this. That was the whole point; he was supposed to prove to Cas that he could love him the right way. That he was worth keeping around and sticking by.
?” Cas looks gobsmacked. “I’m the one who died, Dean! It wasn’t about you!”
Dean has met plenty of sex workers in his life. He’s always enjoyed strippers, both their no-bullshit-meter and the beauty of them, no shame in admitting that. He’s run into hookers working the night shift and next door to his motel rooms. He thinks it’s often a damn fine profession, especially having survived as a career since Babylon. The oldest and the simplest profession, and all that.
Dean presses his lips together. He wants to say
She shrugs. “Depends on who you ask. Certainly, I’m in the minority of your friendship group – though I suspect some are just quiet about it – but if we went to Pride, I’d have plenty of siblings.” She frowns. “I really can’t believe you were unaware. Darling, you’re married to a man.”
“Sure,” he says.
“I assure you, I’m not.” Cas shuffles, dislodges Dean just enough to scoot down and lie by Dean’s side. “I understand that you worry. I am
“Then what- what do you-?”
Charlie points at him. “So you did keep it a secret!”
“You married a monster,” says Dean, a little hoarse.
Dean looks up at the sky and runs a hand down his face. “Cas,” he tries. “I wasn’t thinking. I didn’t mean to.”
“That reminds me,” says Cas. “How is the kentia palm plant?”
Cas says, after a few moments of driving in silence with the sun rising high, “I take it that not driving the Impala was part of all this.”
“No,” says Dean at the same time as Jack says, “Yes!” They stare at each other.
As it loads, Miracle lets out a small snuffle beside him. Dean looks at Miracle, and then back at the laptop, and then decides to go up to bed. The dude’s been through enough already.
She tilts her head. “Missing him already?”
Cas, having suffered defeat, emerges from the ocean and walks towards him, and Dean gets a little - stuck on the sight.
His back knocks against concrete, and the air is struck out from him. He coughs, hacks up black goo, and lets go of the static as he sits up and tries to breathe again. His knees bend up for his forearms to rest against, hanging his head between them, while he inhales big whooping breaths.
But maybe Cas doesn’t know, not this part of Dean. That’s what his confession was about, right? That he knew it was something he couldn’t have. He couldn’t have Dean – couldn’t have his love.
“So you do know about what I did as a teenager,” Dean says instead. “When? How did you find out?”
“Oh, shit, I’m sorry.” Whatever assumptions Victor’s made, Dean lets him. “Hey, maybe you should get on the app, then. It helps your confidence, at least.”
“And leather is for the third year.” He jerks a finger at the fucking leather dog collar with an empty name tag hanging from it and prays Cas doesn’t get the wrong idea from
Cas’s big eyes stare at him for a moment longer, and Dean just keeps stroking that same sliver of skin, thin across the cut of Cas’s jawline. Whatever Cas is looking for, he finds it, because his hands (
“We are?” Cas looks surprised, and Dean remembers that it was supposed to be a surprise.
She leans forward. “Come on, who do you think you’re talking to? I’d love it. What are in-laws for?”
Cas asks him too, asks if Dean was ever jealous of those who distracted him. (He phrases it like that, too. Distracted from Dean. That’s how he views any romantic dalliances. Cool.)
“Yeah,” Sam says, shifting to sling an arm over his wife’s shoulders. “You said you took a class at the community class?”
“To be bisexual,” she barrels ahead. “Or ‘bi’, depending on your phrasing, is to be attracted to all genders, whether the same as your own or not. You may have a leaning towards one more than others, and if you’re monogamous, you will pick one at a time. But the important thing is that the possibility is there.”
But –
They follow the police office through the station and downstairs. Dean is temporarily struck by the sight of Cas in a suit. Strange to be unaccompanied by beige overcoat, and stranger still to now be allowed to covet the line of his shoulders, the neat taper of his waist, the fabric around his thighs.
“Can’t wait,” Dean replies cheekily, and then follows him out the front door.
that. But I need some space away from you.”
There’s a scene where Teddy – Dr Sexy’s old friend who he’s been treating for a mysterious disease – suddenly grabs Dr. Sexy’s labels and plants a dirty, passionate kiss on him, and- and Dr. Sexy kisses
Cas lets out another exhale of frustration before he’s twisting them over and leaning over Dean entirely. Dean’s entire body decides on an eloquent ‘guh’ in reaction. “I promised to not leave you again,” he says, and it sounds like a vow. Dean is helpless against those blue eyes, so intense and so close. “I meant that. Did you mean it in asking?”
Cas narrows his eyes. “You- something
“Good. I think we already are learning from our mistakes you know.”
“Come on, some of us have never dated an angel!” She plateaus her hands underneath her chin and bats her eyelashes, like Dean doesn’t know she’s an evil,
appear on?” or “When should you replace your steering rack boot?” whilst Cas would ask, “Why do you think the first fish crawled from the ocean to walk?”
Until Dean sees him, crumpled against the floor, unnaturally so.
“And what, let some more people get ganked?” It slips out of Dean nastier than he meant it. It’s not Cas’s fault that this life never leaves them. It’s not Cas’s fault that Dean is never, ever going to be fucking free of it. They probably jinxed themselves, talking about work is a theoretical sense, like it didn’t still have a tie around their ankles.
“I do,” swallows Dean.
Dean nods. “Yeah. I can be honest. Even about the ugly parts.” Even, he adds silently in his head, about the totally humiliating parts.
They don’t talk much for the hour it takes to get into town, and Dean finds them the nearest motel like a bloodhound. He parks up, and says to Cas, “I’ll book the room, and then we can do some research and see how we play this. Two bodies aren’t much to go off, and I don’t know whether we’ll need to ask around as agents or tourists.”
“Hey, I’ve been hunting for
wedding about how much it does mean, actually.”
“Bah,” replies Bill dismissively. “I could have hidden it in Timbuktu, and you would have found it.”
Cas doesn’t say anything for a long moment. Dean bites his tongue against pestering him and instead waits him out. Eventually, Cas wrenches his gaze away from the glass, from himself, to look at Dean. “You know angels don’t dream.”
Dean rips his hands away and shoves them into his jean pockets. Cas watches him for a beat, a second stretched out, and then turns to hug Sam tightly. Dean notices that they don’t struggle to let go of each other. Weird, that.
worth it.
That’s not fair either. None of this is – Dean is screaming from the cage of his own fucking head. He could blame it on the day – on seeing Cassie, on getting back into hunting, on being in the ugliest motel room he’s ever been in – but it’s just him. It’s Dean Winchester, taking a flamethrower to everything and everyone in his life. It was always a matter of time, from the goddamn second he thought he could be happy, it was always going to blow up in his face.
Cas lets out an irritated groan.
, he goes down the basement and holds the piece of paper that proves Cas is here to stay. But only sometimes.)
“Ah,” says Cas, dry as graveyard dirt. “That clears things up.”
“I have a date,” she replies, waggling her eyebrows.
He leans his hands onto the bar, facing her. “It wasn’t a
He’s lost in the hum of Cas’s approving kisses, soft and welcoming, and so he reacts too late when the towel slips and slides. Cool air breezes against his exposed dick. He stills, and so Cas does too, and Dean scrambles back, and then he falls off the fucking bed.
“I got him back,” replies Dean, firmly. That’s all that matters. That’s all that has ever mattered. He forces a grin on his face, and says, over whatever Sam fancies retorting, “Now, who’s hungry?”
When he comes back with just a bag of ice and a gas station sandwich, Cas just looks at him with this impossibly fond, knowing look, and Dean wants to dunk his head in the bag of ice until his whole fucking head goes numb.
will be on, at least. But it’s not, and instead Dean gets caught on some chick’s show (in that, while watching, the characters are women are they are talking to each other). He watches a brunette say to a darker brunette, “I think the magic is gone.”
He looks down at his dick, which is pointing hopefully up still. He pulls the fabric of his boxers away, wincing at the stickiness, and staggers to the shower. He turns the temperature down cold, and lets out a sigh of relief when, finally, his strings cut. He sags, leans his forearm against the wall tile, and hides his face in the crook of his elbow.
Dean is prevented from grabbing Cas’s shirt until he explains what the fuck he means by that by the door swinging open. A bunch of their closest friends yell, “Congratulations!” and shower them with rice.
Donna handcuffs the man and leads him outside. Jody says to Dean, “Well, if you change your mind, we’ll cool him off in the tank. You have my number.” And she leaves, taking Dick and Donna with her.
They announce their vow renewals for early next year – their friends’ reactions range from delighted (Eileen) to confused (Benny) to a little aggravated (Sam, who asks why Dean feels the need to have three more weddings than most people).
“I knew you wanted the holiday!” It feels like more of a victory than it should as Dean follows him out.
“I can sew it back up.”
Cas makes an irritated sound next to him, and Dean ignores him, keeping a sleazy smile on his face.
Dean frowns. “New girlfriend?”
Cas hums.
Dean scratches his fingertips across Miracle’s head and finishes his beer with the crickets for company.
Cas looks close to tears, and it’s just as potent of a jab to Dean’s gut when reflected in the mirror. “Thank you,” he says, simply.
. I just- oh, fuck
And Cas is smiling back. She tugs at the sleeve of his navy henley, and Cas doesn’t flinch back. He keeps his arm right where it is, and lets out one of his stupid dork snorts at something she says.
He pours over news articles and reviews.
Eventually, one evening when Dean is deciding between making ribs or risotto, Cas comes in with a grin stretching his lips wide. He steps close, right into Dean’s space, and slides his fingers in between Dean’s. “Do you want to see it?”
Cassie looks past him, at a point over his shoulder, and Dean knows exactly who she’s staring at and what she’s seeing, but he still doesn’t turn back as he walks out of the motel room.
Cas doesn’t taste of cinnamon, or mint, or blood, or strangers’ bitter come. He tastes of the beer they’ve been drinking all night, and underneath that, just
He also won’t let Cas return to work, which is an ultimatum that leads to possibly their worst argument ever, if not in at least five years.
“Fuck,” says Meera, and Dean can’t help but agree.
Victor shrugs, not enough to shift his smirk, and says, “Visiting family this way. Just getting food for-”
“But nothing about our relationship has changed. Dean is telling the truth - he offered to marry me to protect my citizenship here.” Cas takes a moment, and frowns at the wooden carving on the table. “I only- I meant to mark the occasion. Not to create an argument.”
Dean swallows, and after a moment says, “I’m sorry. It’s just, seeing Cassie, seeing her like this. It’s freaked me out. I shouldn’t be taking it out on you.”
“So, to all my doctors and nurses and every other staff member of Mercy Hospital: I’m bisexual.”
The episode begins to wrap up, but Dr. Sexy calls in his main staff to the front desk for an announcement. Dean feels his heart beat faster and he doesn’t even know why.
Sam rolls his eyes. “Whatever. Come on, if we don’t make some headway on this bookcase, Eileen won’t let me buy any more books for a month, and I’ve got my eye on a sixteenth-century collection of lore.”
Eileen clinks her mug with his, in silent commiseration.
(When he’s drunk, months later, he’ll describe it as the worst sound he’s heard in his life.)
In the privacy of his own bedroom, Dean pulls his own, matching ring, from his bedside table, and slides it on. It feels more comfortable than he’d expected - warm from its box home. He goes to sleep on his back, with his left hand splayed across his chest.
the beach after Sam left for some landlocked college miles away. Dean chose the beach and sent Sam postcards to remind him where he was. Dean chose the beach, and Sam only came back after Dad died drunk in a Texan motel.
But that’s stupid – this is Cas. The same Cas who hoists the rainbow flag high every Pride month and has a dog-eared copy of
Cas continues. “When I was there most recently. I thought – well. I thought that was it. And then Jack rescued me. He had to take my grace fully from me in order to pull me out of there.”
“Hey, hey!” Dean is there before he realises, rag discarded in favour of yanking the man backwards and smacking at the offending hand. “What the fuck is wrong with you? Cool it, man.”
“No, I-” and here’s where they’re supposed to talk about it, right? The reason why Cas sacrificed himself. The reason why Dean almost did and will do in the future if needs be. Dean lets out a sigh and rubs a rough hand over his eyes. “I know. I know it wasn’t.”
He uses shaking fingers to pull at Cas’s tie, at once tightening it and then reaching up to loosen it again, pull it from the knot and whisper it from around his neck. He shoves at his jacket and shucks it to the floor as well. He’s shaking from the inside out, and he needs to prove something, and he doesn’t know what yet, but he’ll figure it out along the way. Cas’s lips are plump and spit-slick against his own, and they’re so easy to lose himself in, so easy to forget.
Dean winces. Cranky Cas has arisen. “Sure. Sometimes. And it you know what, it always helped when I did.” He scratches along Cas’s scalp. “Come on, sweetheart, talk to me.”
, I’m coming with. Eileen can come too; we’ll make a trip of it.”
Now, he can just play it all the way through.
Cas begins to move again, slamming and slapping flesh, hot and lewd in the silence of their bedroom. Dean is on fire, and desperate, and panting out nonsense.
“What?” Dean croaks out, staring at the foam and shards of dark glass.
And, without any deliberation at all, Dean’s arms reach of their own accord to wrap underneath Cas’s arms and hug him from behind. He can feel his own heartbeat faster, and the only way to soothe it is to rely on the feel of Cas’s solid ribs under his hands. Cas lets go of the sink to place his own hands on Dean’s, and Dean presses his front all along Cas’s back. He tucks his chin onto Cas’s shoulder, and swallows. In the silence that follows, Dean eventually prompts, “Your nightmare was about the Empty. You remember it, then?”
He takes a drag, fights the cough, and lets the smoke float out from between his lips.
what Einstein said. I met him and he had horrid breath, and his patch of Heaven is boring anyway.”
Wait, back up.
“Ah,” says Dean, and instinct forces his other hand to fidget around it, hiding the ring – stupidly and too late – from view. “It’s, uh. Not like that.”
Dean scratches at the back of his neck. “Well. Yeah. Of course I did.”
. Cas’s hand is so goddamn large, and unrelenting, and Dean swears to whatever deity is left that he’s using his grace for nefarious purposes. Dean has never had a hand job that felt like gloved lightning before.
“I’m sorry, Baby,” he says to her, and he starts up her engine.
“Dean,” says Cas, managing to inflict a whole sentence within the syllable.
- and stares at the wall facing him. He has spent the past few days drawing out every symbol and blend of symbols he could think of. There are angelic pleas and demon wards. But one symbol in the middle, the largest, is the one he keeps staring at.
Cas doesn’t reply, and Dean’s a coward who doesn’t look back.
He swallows back everything he immediately wants to say – mostly curses not appropriate for the deceased resting nearby – and instead says, through gritted teeth, “Hey, Cassie. Fancy seeing you here.”
“I – I don’t,” Dean stutters, weakly.
“Fuck,
Somehow, they managed to contort themselves so they’re curled around each other in the corner between door and seat, and Cas has the, quite frankly,
He sits in the waiting room with blood-smeared hands and a bouncing knee. He’s cold in just a t-shirt, with the air-con and the cloying scent of hospitals. He finds himself fiddling with his ring, twisting it back and forth until the skin underneath it shins like scar tissue.
,” Dean says, fast and vehement. “I got you back because – I – we – anyway, God is gone.”
Dean smacks his lips together to think, and then says, carefully, “Uh, laundry.”
Charlie gently punches his shoulder. “That’s a good thing.” She pulls back her fist to rest her jaw on it. “I’m proud of you. You’ve worked fast through your gay panic – twelve hours must be some kind of record for the LGBT community.”
Cas’s gaze slides off him and away. “Dean. You hurt me. Very much. This isn’t funny to me.”
Sam and Eileen eventually beg off to go to bed – just in time to avoid doing the dishes, Dean notices – and Dean nurses a beer, just staring at Cas.
Dean nods. “Yeah. Yeah, I have.” He fumbles his hand forward to grab onto Cas’s. “So, here. I promise not to push you away again. How about that?”
It’s about the first time Jack visits, and sees his bedroom, and hugs them both so tight Dean sees stars.
“Fuck,” he hisses against Cas’s mouth. He has to – fuck, he has to look. He sits back and the sight is
“He should not have a
Cas’s jaw sets, a mean look tensing the skin around his eyes. “Dean. Don’t pick a fight. I know you. I know how much you love this car. I love this car because you do. Why won’t you drive it?”
“That’s stupid,” says Sam, blunt as always. “Like, really stupid. You weren’t to know.”
“Awesome,” says Dean, meaning it.
first. He has to know his own desires before he tells Cas about them. He has to know his own thoughts before he voices them. When he gets angry at stupid stuff, like the truck breaking down or a customer being a shit at work, or even just at the softness emerging around his own gut, he has to work out
They manage to work fast, nailing together the cross and then packing the straw around it, fitting the clothes on and tying it all together with twine and knots. Dean has, unfortunately, more practice than he’d like tying wrists and ankles to crosses, and he’s making a forcible effort to not make those connections.
Weird. Whatever.
He tucks his forearms against Cas’s collarbone so he can press closer, tilts his chin so he has the best angle to slide his lips against Cas’s, so he has the brace support to open his mouth and let Cas’s tongue slip wet and sloppy inside. He lets out a gasp, a half-committed groan, and he finally lets go of Cas’s jaw only so he can grip a hand into his hair. Cas moves too, slides his hands across Dean’s back to hold him close. His lips are lush and firm and desperate, getting sloppier and swollen by the second. The tips of his fingers embed themselves in the flesh on either side of his spine, like he could claw Dean apart to get inside of him. Dean thinks he’d let him.
. If kissing escalates, and Dean feels Cas’s hard cock pressing insistently against his thigh, great, that’s hot and Dean wants to grip onto it. But then – something will happen, or Dean’s brain will kick back into gear, and then he thinks about the next step, of sucking or fucking or both, and he gets filled with a freezing terror that stills his hands and mouth and body.
“No,” says Cas, simply. He says, to Claire, “Did I tell you you’re getting a raise? We had good earnings last quarter, so your base pay is going up by a few dollars.”
“You’ve made worse ones,” Cas says simply. Which, Dean kind of wants to take offence to, if it weren’t wholly true. “But all things you’ve done are for love, and all that.”
He vaguely remembers that incident, remembers the hot and humiliated anger when Sam said that; a weird kind of caught-out shame and rage. He remembers the fight, for sure, and driving around for a couple of hours trying to run from the boiling underneath his skin.
Dean’s face is burning. He hopes the lights are dim enough to hide that. “Cas wasn’t a US citizen, alright?” He gestures with his beer bottle. “Now he is.”
“I want to be clear,” Cas says. “From now on, we must be very honest with each other. I know that will be difficult, considering our experience of lying to each other most of the time.”
“Yes, then.” Cas casts his eyes skyward. “I will come back before the end-credits scene.”
Miracle nuzzles into Cas’s cheek and plants a sloppy kiss on his skin – like pet, like owner, Dean figures.
, and you want me, and we’re in bed together, and we’re happy, and your eyes are on me, and you’re naked because you – oh – you
Sam, predictably, is very emotional about the whole thing, and brings up their childhood, and fucking
But the texture is
His brows crease. “Who else would I tell?”
It’s like when he was a kid, and they’d finally stay at a motel with a TV waiting for them. When Dad was on a hunt and Dean would stay up late because school didn’t matter in the morning, but Sam did, right then and there, and Dean had to keep watch. When Dean would flick through the channels with big eyes and wonder.
“Oh,” says Dean, as abrupt as the stop of his heartbeat. He licks his bottom lip, and Cas watches the movement.  “You, uh – you do?”
Sam claps Cas on the back. “I can’t believe it,” he says, grinning. “It’s so good to see you, man, you have no idea how much we missed you.”
And, over the next month or so, it actually starts to come together.
“You are going to stay down, and wait out the night in a jail cell,” continues Cas, in that same tone of voice.  “You will get your car keys in the morning.”
“I am sorry, you know,” admits Dean, easy to do so into Cas’s hair. “I know I can be annoying.”
Cas gives him a cross look, which is pretty much negated by the fluffy towel bandaged around his head. “Where would I go?”
“You shouldn’t be eating chocolate after a head injury,” says Dean.
“She seems to be capable from what we’ve seen so far,” Cas comments.
Cas lets out a growl, and his hands are savage against Dean’s back, and one of them slips down to edge his fingers underneath the seam of Dean’s jeans. Dean reacts a moment too slow, and then just pauses, stuck on the temptation of fingertips inching towards the flesh of his ass.
So, Dean figures, new setting means new mind. If he can get out of his own head, he can lie back and think of England. He can prove he loves Cas and that he’s gay in one fuck. And then that means that Cas has less reason to leave.
Dean blinks at the screen. What the fuck?
Dean lets out a growl of frustration. “You’re not getting it. I didn’t know bisexuality even
He drives the long way back to the Roadhouse, and practices his speech to Baby’s wheel. “It’s no big deal,” he tells her. “I’ll be casual about it. Like, hey, buddy. I’m-”
“Shut up,” rebukes Dean because he’s a scholar like that. “I will burn that laptop in holy oil, see if I don’t.”
Dean looks out at the ocean. “God. Yeah, you were what, ten?”
Dean’s left elbow rests over the backrest of their seat, and his fingers begin to tap an anxious beat on the leather. “And – and your imagination. What do you imagine?”
“You wouldn’t leave my side for literal
“Probably. You were fourteen. Acne all over your face and fucking annoying,” Sam grins into his beer as Dean puts up the obligatory, ‘hey!’ defence. “But whatever, Dad said yes to the idea but then never delivered.”
Except it’s Dean, and he’s not a character, and it’s his whole fucking life.
But Dean knows how to pick his battles. He stomps forward, careful to avoid a blooming cauliflower, and pulls Jack into a full-body hug, clapping him on the back a few times for good measure. “It’s good to see you.”
Cassie smiles back at him. “Same, I’m sure. Come on, we have a coffee maker at our room. I’ll put it on while we’re waiting for you guys to catch up.” And with that, she flounces away to their vehicle, which is a goddamn Toyota
He should be offended – and sure, there’s a spinning wheel of angst in his brain, stuck on a cog of rejection – but he is very aware that choosing this particular issue to lose his rag over would make him look crazy. He can’t imagine sleeping on the couch for
She watches him for a moment, with cool eyes, and then shrugs, measures out a couple of fingers for him, and sets it down. She does go far and leans back against the shelves. She picks up a glass and begins toweling it dry. “Weird night, huh?” she prompts.
Cassie snaps back, unafraid to get right in his face and jab a finger against his sternum, “No, asshole, we manage to communicate with each other. It’s really quite simple. But thanks for the misogyny, that’s great. Real classy.”
“Hide from it?” Sam asks. “Wait, it could still come get you?”
But –
, like the audience is supposed to notice it. Like it
Dean imagines, loosely, if Cas chucked
He steps back, trying to not look as flustered as he feels and failing miserably judging by Meera’s raised eyebrow. She slams the door shut again, and Dean’s just stood there like a fucking chump.
But it’s missing the rakshasa.
It’s become a real staple of the local community. Charlie has pop culture knowledge pouring out of her ears, along with her tendency to Wikipedia-spiral and research any topic she doesn’t already know about. It’s a great way of bringing in business and competitive customers.
He looks down at his dick and tries not to feel like a failure. This was supposed to – well, maybe not solve
“Wait,” says Cas, even as Dean stands. “Are you okay?”
, and so sure of it. People on television have been gay or straight or they said they didn’t have labels (which, fine, but Dean could have used a label at least once, apparently). Cas always hangs different coloured flags around the bar during Pride month - but there’s so many. Dean couldn’t have known one of them could apply to
. You came back and I had to – I had to make good on all the promises I made myself.”
Before he can overthink any of that, Cas spins him and pushes him onto the bed. Dean goes sprawling inelegantly, and he props himself up on his elbows just in time to see Cas’s prowl towards him. He’s still wearing his trench coat, his suit and tie, which is so stupid but it turns Dean on something stupid too. Cas starts to climb onto the bed, knee landing on the mattress, and Dean leans just enough to grab onto Cas’s tie and pull him into a sloppy and keening kiss.
. I never, ever, wanted that.”
Dean flushes.  “No, come on, I’m sure you don’t want to-”
There are a number of times where Dean is very thankful Sam brought Eileen into his life - this is not one of those times.
In the doorway, as if they had just walked in, stands Jack and Castiel, side by side, just as the day they left. Jack is grinning, and Cas is-
There are paper garlands hanging from the ceiling, with cut out hearts and wedding bells. There are gold and white balloons tied up and drifting, and there’s an honest-to-god, three-tiered, white wedding cake on the dining room table.
The lights turn off, and a bedside lamp switches on, and Dean’s abruptly glad Cas is still an angel. There’s about half a foot between them, and it feels too much, but Dean doesn’t know how to cross it.  His whole body is strung tight as a wire, and he twists onto his side to see Cas already there, watching him. Blue eyes filled by large pupils, reflecting the lamp’s warm shine.
“That’s all,” he says back, making his signs language sharp and deliberate. It doesn’t affect her expression.
Dean rubs a hand over his face. It’s like losing his virginity all over again. Except at least when he was a kid, John had given him
It’s like Eileen can read his mind. She nudges his ribs to get him to look up, and says out loud, “Stop with the guilt routine. We don’t need you anymore, actually.” And then she has the audacity to wink.
“Only since Cas got back and we knew you were - well. But yeah. That’s part of this. Part of having our own lives free from Chuck’s influence also means… having our own lives. Finding love, building a home. That’s a good thing, Dean.” Sam’s now crying, just a little, and Dean realises he is too. Jesus. “We’re still brothers. You’re still my best friend, and we’re still going to hang out all the time. But it’s okay to not live with your brother when you’re forty-two, I promise.”
This feels like an important question. Dean rolls his tongue over his teeth to think. “Uh.”
“I love you,” Dean says. “But I didn’t think that was enough. I had to be what you wanted because that’s all I knew. And what else am I good for these days?”
So, yeah. They build a home together.
That’s – that’s possible?
“Dean Winchester,” he says. “I love you too. If we were not already married, I would march you, right now, to a priest myself.”
“You too,” replies Cas, a little shiny himself.
Dean presses his lips together, and then lets the air go. “I. Yeah. Okay, yeah, I get that.” It feels weird – really, it is weird. He’s not sure many people have the awkwardness of their boyfriend talking with their dead mom. He feels not quite jealous, but something close. He’d give a lot to talk to Mary right now. A sudden fear accompanies that thought and grips him tight. “Does she know about us? Have you told her?”
He aches. All over.
“Oh.” Cas takes a moment, and then says, “Does that change things?”
Dean remembers Cassie and he remembers feeling so goddamn much for her. He remembers wanting her naked and clothed and smiling and pissed off at him,
yesterday. How awkward.”
Victor’s food arrives first, and so Dean hugs him goodbye, makes him promise to stay in touch this time, and then sits with the app for a little longer. He has the option to swipe through potential matches, now, and he finds himself staring at the screen. With Victor gone, he changes his preferences to closer to his own age, and open to men and women and anything else.
They get out of the car and slam the doors shut behind them. Dean pats Baby’s roof and resolves to give her a well-deserved wash this weekend. (Maybe a good clean on the inside, too. Poor girl.)
He takes a step back, as far as Dean’s arms will let him, and those blue eyes pierce straight into Dean’s gut.
But something always happens. Sometime Cas grazes Dean’s hips, touches the bare skin underneath his shirt, and Dean shivers, and then he remembers he’s kissing a guy, and what comes next. Sometimes Dean trips himself up, finds himself reaching down to rub the heel of his palm against Cas’s bulging crotch, to offer him some release from whining his desperation into Dean’s jugular. Sometimes it’s an external thing, like the pipes of the Bunker or a text from Jack or Miracle scratching at the door.
Cas leans back against the seat, and says, “I just don’t understand why we need one.”
- I thought what I felt – still feel – was impossible.” He presses his lips together and tries to get better at it: “I thought I couldn’t love you the way I do. And I do.”
Dean glares at Cas in suspicion. “You’d better not be buying another plant for the apartment.”
He’s filled with light and relief, and he flops down on the ground, right on the dirt, and pulls Cas down with him. Cas, for all his flaws, goes down with him without protest. “You know,” Dean says, looking up at the endless sky. “I’m pretty happy too.”
“I consider myself a gay man,” says Cas, putting Dean out of his misery like he is often wont to do. “Well. Gay angel, I suppose.”
, Dean’s gorilla brain thinks) grip onto Dean’s biceps to yank him down for another kiss.
Cas snuffles against Dean’s shoulder, and Dean smiles.
But the moment passes, and he sinks beside him into sleep.
“But – it’s not just guys on TV. There’s been- moments. People. Feelings that I couldn’t make sense of.” He stares down at his hands, the callouses and the lifelines and the scars. He swims in memories of stubble smiles and broad shoulders and stomach flutters. “I feel as if I’m looking at everything with new eyes.”
Letting the water sluice over him, he leans on the shower tile and rolls his shoulders back, tries to let the tension run from him with the water. But it’s like a drum in his head,
It’s dingy, and the path stinks, and the four of them walk in pretty tense quiet. Eventually, they come to a fork in the pipes, and Cassie claps her hands together. “Right,” she says. “I think we should split up into two.”
The kitchen is huge, and Dean gets the largest oven he can find (“Gotta make room for the Thanksgiving turkey,” he says, clapping Cas on the back when he starts making comments about overcompensating). He fills it with utensils, and a slow-cooker, and the best coffee maker on the market. Cas buys home-sewn oven gloves and dish towels, gets them delivered from the Pinterest and Etsy stores he likes. Most are bee themed, though he does buy an apron with ‘
Dean jerks back to the car. “Come on, kid, we’ve still got a job to do today.”
Dean is hard, he realises, and his hands are frozen on his thighs. Not as hard as he’s been with Cas’s tongue in his mouth and hands stroking a clever pattern on the bare small of his back, but hard is hard. Research seems to be going well. Further proof, and all that.
Yeah, Dean gets it. Remembers falling for Cassie, reluctantly and helplessly, with every argument and sexually-charged fight. A different kind of love compared to Lisa, who was warm and steady, a far-off fantasy never quite realised. Different to Cas, too, which is just – encapsulating. World-defining. Violent and tender depending on the flip of a coin. Brutal and the worst pain one person can inflict on another, but the only grumpy asshole he wants to ever come home to again. Sharing t-shirts and trauma. Washing dishes together and listening to the crickets outside.
