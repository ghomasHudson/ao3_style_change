John leapt to his feet.  He considered bowing but he hadn’t bowed to Sherlock and this was only his brother.  He settled for standing at attention.
“John, I need to start my analysis of the poison.  I allow Mr. Tregennis to go free because the technicians at the lab can’t do a simple analysis.”
Eventually, they heard a clock strike eleven o’clock in the distance. Sherlock shook himself and looked up at John.  John glanced down at his book quickly so he could at least have plausible deniability.  Sherlock stretched, his back arching away from the chair and John was staring again.
John opened and closed his mouth a few times. “Well done you for reading my mind,” he finally said.  Sherlock began to frown.  “That would be lovely,” said John, hoping to wipe the forlorn expression off his face. “But I really should go get a few things from the hotel.”
“I don’t know, I see. Your haircut, he way you hold yourself says military. Your face is tanned but not tanned above the wrists.  So, you were abroad but not sunbathing.  Your limps really bad when you walk but you haven’t asked for a chair and you stand like you’ve forgotten about it.  Your therapist thinks it’s psychosomatic, quite rightly I’m afraid.  That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic.  Wounded in action then.  Wounded in action, suntanned. Afghanistan or Iraq.”
John almost looked over his shoulder, wondering who Sherlock could be talking to.  He caught himself just in time to keep from looking like a complete idiot.  He approached the woman on the other side, kneeling down next to her.  He had to push his stiff leg into a bent position to get close enough to see anything useful.  He hoped Sherlock hadn’t noticed but Sherlock seemed intent on investigating the woman's pockets so probably had missed it.
When Sherlock seemed to have calmed down a bit, John finally allowed himself to ask the question that was on the tip of his tongue.  “Why, if you don’t trust any of them, have you decided to trust me?”
John felt a current of anger passing between the brothers that he didn’t really understand.  He resisted the urge to duck in case they started hurling actual lightning bolts at each other.
John took a deep breath.  Just a body.  Nothing he hadn’t dealt with before.  Sherlock was already kneeling on the floor next to the dead woman and John took a step closer.  He watched Sherlock for several silent minutes as he inspected the woman, even going so far as to pull out a tiny magnifying glass out and inspect her jewelry with it.
“Oh, none of that here when it’s just us,” she said, reaching out a hand for John to shake.  “You may call me Violet.”
The train car was nearly empty, and he sank into the nearest seat, panting heavily.  Then he looked at his phone.  The last plane of the evening headed for Aldovia was leaving at 21:10. He had 55 minutes.  He bought the ticket.
They met at the pub at 8pm as one of Mike’s couple friends were new parents and wanted to get back early to let the babysitter go celebrate.  John arrived slightly late and a corner table was already filled with Mike’s group.  Mike saw him come in and stood to greet him.  He slapped John on the back and handed him a pint of beer.
“Long distance could be challenging,” said Sherlock, still studying John’s face.  “I can come to London a few times a year, but I have duties that keep me here.”
Sherlock placed John directly in front of a woman with pure white hair set into a perfect bob and, oddly, eyes the exact same indescribable shade as Sherlock’s.  John gave a small bow.  “Your Majesty,” he said, feeling incredibly awkward.
Instead, he went to look at the Christmas tree.  It was the grandest tree he’d seen in the palace and he’d seen a lot of them.  It was covered in gold and cream ribbon and decorated with handblown glass bulbs and carved wooden ornaments.  John made his way around the far side of the tree, looking at the ornaments and he was just looking at a large acorn when he heard voices on the other side of the tree.
Mrs. Hudson wrapped his hand in both of hers.  “Did he? That was very kind of you, Sherlock,” she called over her shoulder at Sherlock, who was already going into the other room.
John went into his room and saw a beautiful suit laid out on his bed.  The jacket and trousers were cut perfectly for him and there were even cuff links with his initials on them, laid out in a little box next to the jacket.  Again, John wondered how Sherlock could have gotten a suit with his exact measurements made in such little time.
“As I said, Mrs. Hudson can’t be stopped when she sets her mind to something,” said Sherlock.  “Take a seat and warm up by the fire.” He pointed to the chair to the left of the fire.  It was a low squashy, red chair with a tartan blanket thrown across the back.  John settled into it and was struck by how comfortable it was.
Sherlocks thumbs moved in a blur and then hit send.  He set the phone down on the table.  “With the murderer, I expect.”
Light glowed from the upstairs window and standing just in front of the window was the figures of Sherlock and himself, standing close together as though they were talkin.
“Not at all,” said the man, turning.  And, yep.  That was the Prince of Aldovia.  John recognized him from his large painting in the portrait gallery.  There was no mistaking him for anyone else.  Nobody else could possibly have that remarkable combination of height cheekbones and wildly unruly hair.  Though the portrait artist had toned down the hair and given the painting a blandly pleasant expression which was miles away from the analytical scowl the prince was currently levelling at him.
“We appreciate the presses attendance at this last minute conference to address the events at last night’s Christmas Ball.  A would be assassin was apprehended after attempting to poison the Prince.  He has since confessed.  No one was injured and the alleged attempted murdered is now in custody.  At this point, there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.  We now have time for a few questions.”
“It’s alright,” said Sherlock, looking down again and breaking his intense eye contact. “So, dinner?”
The next time John woke, sun was pouring through the windows, nearly blinded him.  The snowstorm of the previous few days left everything covered in sparkling white which seemed to be magnifying the light coming in through the window.
“This,” John pointed between the two of them, waving a finger in the negative space.  “This doesn’t have to end.  You are the one ending it.”
Sherlock took it and immediately started searching random files. He needed to pretend at least for few minutes, that he didn't already know about the specific encrypted file.
While Sherlock's back was turned, John spotted a small patch of drool on his shirt collar where John's face must have been resting. He walked over and poked it with the hand that wasn't supporting Ella before realizing what he was doing.
Then John noticed that Violet was also wearing the mittens he’d given her.  She wore a black, no nonsense coat and a red scarf but the mittens added just a touch of whimsy to her ensemble.
Mycroft gave John a small, conspiratorial nod before he was swept into the conversations of those around him.
After the address, John went for a walk in the grounds, winding his way through the snow-covered ornamental gardens.  He made his way back to his room as the sun was beginning to set over the pine trees.
“Ok, do you want to tell me what your problem is?” he asked in a voice that made it very clear that it was not an actual question but a demand. “Because you are acting like a royal pain in the ass this morning.”
“No time for that,” said Sherlock.  He closed his eyes and scrunched up his face.  “This way!” he shouted, running off in the opposite direction.
John followed the footman, who was carrying his busted old carry on, up the palace stairs and then up the grand staircase and through the halls.  The palace was more busy than he’d seen it.  There seemed to be servants everywhere adding even more Christmas decorations to the already liberally decorated corridors.
“Lint,” said the Prince.  He had a very large piece of white, fluffy lint, pinched between his leather gloved fingers.  “This is clearly from the robes at the ski lodge up the mountain.  You had your coat hanging in the same closet.  If you were with someone, they would have noticed it and picked it off.  If you’d have planned this trip, you would have stayed in the village.  Much more convenient and you wouldn’t think yourself up for skiing, though you would be.  Your brother and his wife planned this trip but when their marriage fell apart, your brother gave you his ticket.  And you, having been in the army for the past few years, had no one to ask to come with you.”
“You’ll have to ride behind me,” Sherlock said as he swung a leg over the snowmobile and John suddenly felt his heartrate pick up and a blush spread up his face and probably as far as his ears.  Sherlock’s eyes flicked up and down John’s body but John thought he could blame his suddenly red cheeks and ears on the bitterly cold wind.
“It lights up,” said Sherlock.  He reached over to flip the battery switch on the bottom, brushing his fingers against John’s.  John felt a current of electricity between the two of them that could have probably lit up the ornament without the battery.
“So, you see, Prime Minster Lecoq, the country needs to invest in infrastructure and public programs.  It will provide us with more jobs which will in turn, allow for more workers to frequent stores and restaurants which will in turn yield more jobs."
“Yet since you met him, you have been in his company almost constantly and you’ve already found your way into the palace.”
“It could be another Sebastian situation,” said the second man.  “Friendship with royalty does have its perks.”
“In case you hadn’t noticed,” said Mycroft.  “I was having a private conversation with your friend.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” said John, stepping into his room.  He paused before he shut the door.  “I enjoy your company too,” he said, before clicking the door shut.
“Monitor skips, back alleys, anywhere someone could dispose of a bright pink suitcase.  As soon as the murder realizes he has the case, he’ll be looking to get rid of it.  It would be consipicous for a man to be pulling a suitcase like that about.”
Sherlock finally found his left shoe and put it on.  Then he turned to properly look at John.  “I’m sorry for rushing off like this,” he said.  “Christmas day is terribly busy for us.  We have a quick family gift exchange but then we have to get ready for the Christmas address in the afternoon and the ball tonight.  I should have mentioned when I invited you for Christmas at the palace, I would be busy much of the time.”
Sherlock approached the perimeter with John trailing behind.  He approached a woman standing near the tape. “Your highness,” she said and curtsied.  John would not have believed that a curtsy could be sarcastic until he witnessed this woman curtsy sarcastically.
Sherlock froze for a moment and then leapt out of bed, throwing off the covers and rampaging around the room looking for clothes.
The half hour journey up the mountain to the palace was the longest half hour of John’s life.  The dark pine trees outside the window seemed to crawl by.  By the time the palace came in to view, John felt like he was going to throw up or cry or punch something but instead, he had to sit still in the back of the car with shaking knees and buzzing hands.
Sherlock’s shoes tapped against the hardwood floor as he walked back down the corridor to where John had stopped.
Several hours later and one delicious sandwich later, he was dressed and pacing around his room, fiddling with his phone and wating for Sherlock.  John hadn’t been this nervous for a date in years.  But it wasn’t a date, as he continually reminded himself.
“No, really,” said John.  There was something off about Sherlock’s demeanour and combined with the sadness of the song he’d just been playing, John suddenly was desperate to make Sherlock know that John was giving him a serious compliment and not just being flippant.  “That was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I’ve ever heard.”
“It’s ok,” said Sherlock, more softly.  “Give him the champagne.”  John handed over his champagne flute and then, suddenly Sherlock grabbed hold of him and whisked him out on to the dance floor.  Sherlock quickly arranged John’s hand on his shoulder when he grappled for placement, and then put his hand on John’s waist.  And then they were spinning around the dance floor in a perfect waltz.  John was too stunned to know what to do but Sherlock was leading him expertly through the steps, his hands firmly guiding him in the right direction.
They were in a large, grand sitting room and every single surface was covered in clutter.  A skull sat on the mantle and an ornate slipper filled with cigarettes was sitting in the middle of the coffee table.  On the wall was hung a large deer skull with a full rack of antlers and an old pair of headphones positioned over its head.
Sherlock still hadn’t moved as though he was waiting to see what John would do.  John suddenly realized he had no idea what to say or how to explain his presence.  But his body was screaming at him that he was this close to Sherlock and not touching him.
If you have read all the way to the end, I sincerely thank you.  I feel like I have to appologize for any typos, weird formatting and that tasteless Brexit joke but this was just something fun for me to entertain myself with during this most unusual of holiday seasons.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  And if you noticed any glaring errors that bother you enough to point them out, please do.  I won't be offended but I will fix them.
"You're welcome." With that, John shut the door and watched as the cab drove away. He looked up at the windows of Baker Street and made eye contact with Sherlock. He wanted to broach the subject of Sherlock's past, but wasn't sure now was the best time. Though, he supposed there would never be a best time because the topic would always be uncomfortable. He figured it would be like pulling teeth.
John saw him getting tangled in the straps and helped him remove it quickly. He also noted Sherlock's breathing had elevated to panting, and he was in serious danger of beginning to hyperventilate.
They stared at each other, and John's urge to clear his throat to break the moment was already taken by a black car pulling up to the curb. The two of them got in and road all the way to the hospital in silence. John wasn't sure if it was actually tense or if he was still thinking about the look on Sherlock's face. Either way, the ride felt much longer than the hour and fifteen minutes it actually was.
An hour later found Sherlock and John sat in an empty conference room at Scotland Yard, surrounded by every case file on a drug overdose victim in London in the last year. They only had the current body and one other from a few weeks ago as definite murders. At the time, Lestrade thought it was a one off until this new body showed up in similar fashion. He informed Sherlock that contacting him for a boring case was not on the top of his to do list, and felt this would be another cold case. However, now they knew the killer was still out there and targeting more people. The only connection being cause of death and drug use.
Sherlock kept himself busy the rest of the night. He played through no less than ten different scenarios involving his confrontation with [name deleted].
Afterwards, Mrs. Hudson rose slowly from their spot on the ground. John helped her up, as she groaned from the strain it placed on her hip.
Sherlock's gaze switched between John's eyes, trying to find some hidden condescension or other meaning.
"Well for one, you said there's a serial killer. And two, if it was, you would have no reason to be here."
((I diont’ remember a single quotiation rule right now, apoligise to my 300 level fiction enlgish professor, you did your best))
John followed him and reached the bathroom in time to see Sherlock vomiting in the toilet. He thought Sherlock would be embarrassed so he backed out and tried closing the door.
: Iknw it's not." Sherlock said and stared at him, eyebrows furrowed, ytuiogn to understand what Kohn's intentions were.
"SO, you deduced the killer." He says while trailing fingers from sherlock's wrist up to his shoulder.
"Rub my back," he whispered hoarsely. Sherlock was already embarrassed by having the full attack in front of John, it wasn't too much worse to ask for this comfort. When John started rubbing his back, a sense memory came to his mind of the times when his mother would do this for him after a particularly bad day of school.
"I thought I was going to starve before it got here." He placed the plastic bags on the table and began removing styrofoam boxes from them. He didn't bother asking Sherlock to fetch the utensils so he got them himself and dug in.
Sherlock didn't see the other messages as he had already set his phone on do not disturb and tossed it across the room onto the couch. "You should probably inform your followers that we're on a 'vacation' for the next two weeks. That should be enough time to find a suitable babysitter."
John left him to go make another cup of tea. Sherlock probably didn't need another one, but it was an excuse to give him privacy to get in the tub.
Sherlock relented to this advice when he let the next person in, someone nonbinary if the they/them pronouns listed on their profile was anything to go by. They were in their early twenties and dressed, not casual, but efficient for that of babysitting. Material that wouldn't pick up stains easily and was comfortable enough to crawl around in after a child who'd just learned mobility. They pulled a file out of a small tote bag and handed it to Sherlock while reaching to shake his hand with their free hand.
The problem, John realized, lied in the fact that officers tended to remove their online presence early in their careers. Any information on Sherlock and John had been easily accessible since the beginning, so now it was impossible to remove it. Being a sitting duck for criminals never bothered them before, they knew they could take care of themselves. But now they had a baby to think about. They really were putting her in an unsafe position. John knew this was a conversation with Sherlock that couldn't wait.
Sherlock's breath hitched at the feeling of John's warm breath against the nape of his neck. Though his breathing was unsteady at first, he matched it to the movement of John's chest against him. His heart ached for this to be normal, for it not to be born out of circumstance these lucky few times.
Lestrade opened the folder in front of him and pulled out an old case. One written up for a car collision a couple decades ago. "You were in a car crash with your wife and kid, hit by someone high on heroin."
It was past eleven when they finally crossed the threshold of Baker Street again. They were ready to tumble immediately into bed, which brought up a big problem.
The baby was down for her nap, so Sherlock and John were able to open everything and organize unimpeded. They didn't talk much during the work, but at one point John held up a yellow striped onesie with a cartoon bee in the front. Sherlock feigned nonchalance and John raised an eyebrow. Sherlock got up and moved the now constructed cot to the bedroom so John couldn't see the blush now staining his cheeks.
Sherlock's eyes were imploring, and even if they had been closed there was no way John would leave him after he asked. It was a wonder he'd even asked at all. To voice his insecurity so readily...John would never.
Lestrade informed John they had officers going to every hotel within the designated radius of the hospital Eleanor was dropped off at. They provided each place with a picture and a description of the killer, but none of them had seen him yet. He was working alongside Mycroft, and both agreed that it was highly likely their man found somewhere abandoned to squat in.
"This is Laney. She found out she was pregnant and got clean. Her and her husband Emmett kept each other going and went to meetings together. Their daughter Eleanor is almost four months old now, did you know that? Did you even know she had a child? Do you even care at all about the families and friends of your victims? Your kind never realize that when they murder one person, they murder that entire person's family too." He placed the pictures down along with his hands and a bit of force.
Sherlock cleared his throat and clasped his hands together. "We hadn't given her the bee toy when we brought her to the adoption center, so naturally I took it upon myself to deliver it. She was already placed with a foster family so I went to their home instead and John it was terrible. The wife was clearly going to enforce harmful stereotypes and messages about femininity and the husband was a cheater who I estimate would leave that woman in about three years. This would be harmful to Ella's development and I knew she needed to be removed immediately and apparently, the fastest route of removal was adoption and now here we are."
Sherlock sat up in bed when the smell of tea wafted to his nose, with the inquisitive searching look a dog has when they hear food being dropped into their bowl. John smiled at the comparison and handed over the cup of Earl Gray, prepared the way Sherlock's sweet tooth likes.
Also Mrs. Hudson, please god do some matchmaking, I'm begging you. It's been 34k words of two idiots being idiots!
Sherlock responded in kind and relasexed that yes, John did want him in this way an edvery way he want him.
It wasn't long before John's body sensed his and John threw an arm around the source of heat. John shuffled closer and sighed into Sherlock's neck.
John noticed how tightly he was holding onto the bar, so he walked close enough to touch and placed his hand over the top of Sherlock's.
This was one of the negative ways the fall changed him. Now, Sherlock was too quick to feel like a burden or a failure. John needed to get him refocused, and after the murderer was caught...well then he'd find a way to help Sherlock deal with the guilt.
"Yes. How could someone as inept as him successfully plan and murder six people over several months and still maintain enough anger to follow through?" Sherlock stole a part of the scone on John's plate and chewed on it while thinking. "That's the least of what I'm confused about. He's a moron. I really doubt he has the intellectual ability to pull this off and I don't mean that as an insult or an exaggeration this time. He's proven this with the laptop, but he's also simultaneously proven himself a capable serial killer?"
The baby peered at John and then zeroed in on Sherlock when they were within seeing distance. She shrieked and reached a hand toward him. John noticed Sherlock's unwillingness to meet her, so he placed his hand on the small of his back and pushed forward steadily. It worked, and Sherlock finally moved and reached out for the baby as well.
The walk back out was quiet, even the landlord was gone. It was probably for the best he wasn't here to witness the tragedy of his tenant. The ambulance was gone as well, the paramedics had left while Sherlock and John were in the bedroom.
The nurse handed over Eleanor gently, waiting for Sherlock to get a supportive grip. Sherlock cradled her in his arms and leaned his face down when she still reached her tiny hands up. The fists latched onto Sherlock's curls as soon as they were close enough and her cries quieted down to the occasional whimper. Sherlock shushed her then whispered low enough that no one could hear, "I'm sorry."
John rolled his eyes, it was just a verb. Interesting though, that Sherlock treated her with such...care? Of course, he knew Sherlock would never treat a baby as if they were an object, but he never imagined Sherlock would have no reservations about it either. He thought Sherlock would take to it like a dog person takes to cat sitting, reluctantly and with the motivation of reward. It was sweet and made John think Sherlock may actually want to be a father one day. He'd have to ask him about it later. The thought also pooled acid in his stomach. What person would Sherlock leave Baker Street for? The "body is just transport" and "married to my work" facade was shit. But Sherlock didn't seem to have an interest in dating, to his knowledge. It's possible, he supposed, that Sherlock went on dates while John was at work. The thought rancoured.
She walked over, brushing her wet hands against her skirt. "You can do the rest, don't be lazy dears."
Lestrade did a double take as well when Sherlock and John entered his office. He frowned but didn't verbally comment on it. "You can view the interrogation, but that's it. You won't even be allowed in the halls while he's being transported."
Sherlock didn't feel like replying, he was busy staring at John's hair and thinking about how it would smell if he stood and pushed his face into the crook of his neck. He'd have to settle for inhaling the scent from John's clothes later, once they'd been discarded in the bathroom's hamper. That was probably, most definitely, frowned upon for flatmates to do.
Brown's stupidity was very inconsistent, and something about it bugged Sherlock in the back of his mind. He'd revisit that later, right now John was his priority. It was honestly a laughable effort on his part to claim to everyone that the work comes first when John always takes priority.
"No, I was just going down a list someone gave us. Even Anderson could do it." Oh how he desired to flip his hand over and interlace his fingers between John's. Did he have any idea what this did to him? Did he even realize how long they'd been touching?
John rubbed his arm once then moved away to talk to Evans, then the two left. He was certain he wouldn't get to eat for hours yet, but accepted this as a usual part of the work.
. John knew he was awake. Damn. But he still didn't move? What Sherlock wouldn't give to know what was going on in the man's head.
"It's very convenient that you flew out of the country the day after our latest victim was found. You realized you got sloppy or- no. You read the papers and saw that Scotland Yard finally realized these were murders, not overdoses. You panicked and fled."
Sherlock and hon looked at each othwer outside the fair fourns and Hon said, :"We;;, this is one for the sooks."
John slowsly inserted on efineger adn waited for Sherlock’s nod of consent before moving it around. His doctor fingers expertly found Sherlock’s prostate and rubbed hently.
John took a few moments to settle his thoughts so they wouldn't show on his face when Sherlock saw him upstairs. It sounded to him like Mrs. Hudson truly thought Sherlock felt the same way. That he would welcome it. John wanted to hope she was right, but it was too likely that the tension the two men shared lately was just John seeing what he wanted to see.
The doorbell downstairs rang and Sherlock looked up only to see his flatmate standing at the entrance to the kitchen and watching him with a, dare he think, besotted smile. His face heated and he cleared his throat. "I'm not getting that."
But taking care of the baby sparked a want inside that he hadn't known could ever surpass the fear. It didn't matter though. He wasn't ever going to fall in love with someone else, and Sherlock deciding to raise a kid with him in Baker Street was as ridiculous a thought as Sherlock having some secret third sibling. Right?
Sherlock's mouth dropped open, forming an 'oh'. His head jerked up and stared into the one way mirror as if he could see the others behind it. He left the room and ran into John in the hallway, who grabbed his arms to steady them.
"Besides, you're smarter than most people, so you're already going to have less mistakes than others."
Sherlock looked down at Ella and gently ran one of his hands through the short smattering of brown hair on her head. "It was both of us, John. Do start realizing how much you contribute to the work."
Sherlock shifted Eleanor to his other arm and spoke to her. "I'm beginning to wonder if the books are wrong about when attention span increases. This man is forty times your age and still forgot what he was doing."
. Judging by John's respiration rate, he was awake too. This was to Sherlock's surprise, because surely John would want to remove himself and get up from his platonic friend's embrace. He didn't know what to think of it and honestly didn't want to think at all or he'd let himself entertain the idea that John feels something more for him.
One day, after coming back to Baker Street from the surgery, John placed a wrapped box in front of Sherlock next to his microscope.
"Good thing I wasn't planning on asking you to do the interrogation. I swear you forget you're not actually a part of the force sometimes."
Stood in front of it, he didn't hear any noise, so he knocked before entering quietly. Sherlock only locked the door if he wanted privacy or no interruptions, so John knew was relieved to have welcome access. The room was only lit by a lamp on the side table, which cast light on the coat adorned man curled up in the middle of the bed. John held back a sigh at the sight. How this man managed to look adorable when you could barely distinguish any part of his body, was beyond him.
His thoughts were interrupted when the landlord they met earlier walked down the stairs. "Why did you two lie to me if you were working with the police? I would have answered any questions."
in that sense. But John thought maybe running a bath would be a platonically acceptable alternative.
John was suddenly made very aware of the position he woke up in where Sherlock's octopus limbs were wrapped around his torso with his head laid over the heart in John's chest. John looked up, "How-"
"She likes you. Usually this little one screams bloody murder when a stranger holds her." He started rocking her in his arms. "Isn't that right?"
In a high pitched lil bitch baby fboice Lakitu sayid, "Everyone crossed thie finish line exceot PEach. PLease help ius find her kiler so he cn bte disqualified form the race."
John warmed at the praise and took the baby Sherlock handed to him. He looked at the dishes at the table witheringly and accepted that he'd have to clean them later.
Once the cab pulled up to Baker Street, John paid quickly and followed Sherlock's slowed gait inside the flat.
John conceded, as did Lestrade who positioned officers at the dockyards instead of the airport and train stations.
Of course he did. Of course Sherlock somehow ended up with the baby while John was gone no longer than eight hours.
Unseen to John, Sherlock smirked. "Horridly, I can't seem to ever get away." He'd had enough time to reign in his emotions and react to John like his proper self again, rather than some sentiment ridden fool.
. To accomofadsyt for this they jumped fof the swan into the shallow wat er and went to a maintenace room just off to the side.
John looks up once more at the :"ohhs" and "ahhs" coming from a part fo the arcade located 20 feet forward and 10 feet to the right of th ecash register. He work sa s both the cashier and cook, becuase of course he does. It's a shitty arcade center, they don't have many people working at once. So John often finds himself preparing shitty cafeteria food for patrons.
John aligned their cocks togehter and thursted his hips forward. Sherlocka moaned and said, “As much as I wa tn to keep doing this I need oyu instide me and we need to take these pants off for that.”
"I've narrowed down all points of data to one conclusion, which is to wait for another murder. I'm supposed to be preventing that, but here we are. Clueless as Scotland Yard's
John understood, as he usually does when it comes to Sherlock's unspoken language. "Lestrade can call us about the debriefing later, let's go home." He took Sherlock by the sleeve and pulled him out the door. John texted a short explanation to Lestrade one-handed as they made their way out of Scotland Yard.
"No, wherever he's hiding he probably stumbled upon a network. Drugs are moved quietly all the time."
Brown gasped, but the surprise in his face lasted a few seconds too long to be real. "Are you serious? Why would someone do that?"
John settled in the observation room this time, along with Lestrade and Donovan. He felt no need to reign Sherlock in this time.
John just smiled wider, "That's the plan. Also you should come interact with the baby. I think you'd find they make great subjects for studies, you could start a new spreadsheet."
The fact that Sherlock had done this for him, for Mrs. Hudson, and even Lestrade, without sparing a thought toward his own safety, was absolutely heartbreaking. He cared so much for the people in his life, and in the end John had repaid him for it with several punches. True, he hadn't known yet. But he did know Sherlock, and he should have assumed from the very moment he saw him in The Landmark that there was a reason for all of this. Never cruelty.
Instead of responding to the texts, Mycroft showed up at Baker Street the following morning. When he walked in, he found John laying on the floor with the baby (playing with some plush toy) and Sherlock absent from the room.
"Make sure he's okay. I don't know how much he's told you about his past, but it wouldn't be unlike him to internalize this. As much as he likes us to think he's invincible."
"Yes 'oh.' I don't think drug addicts are a waste, of the NHS' time or of anything. And I certainly don't think they should die." John stared until Sherlock met his gaze. "We need to find him."
Also I just saw Arctic Monkeys last night and they played Arabella which is actually where the name of this fic comes from!
John followed him to Sherlock's room and watch him gently lay the baby on his bed. "Get her into pyjamas while I make the cot."
I don't know how or why this chapter became the length of all the previous chapters combined but I won't complain.
"Doesn't matter." He marched to John's closet and grabbed the first suitable outfit he could find. Turning, he threw it towards John, smacking him in the face.
Talking about Victor Trevor with John last night had been...something. He couldn't necessarily say it reopened old wounds because they hadn't been closed in the first place. It's more like they'd been covered with gauze and now John had removed them. To deal with Victor, Sherlock buried his experience and resulting pain deep in the basement of his mind palace under lock and key. He knew it wasn't technically healthy, but he didn't think feeling it was any healthier. But he knew differently now. It didn't feel as if that part of his life was tucked away anymore.
The poking ceased and Sherlock realized this is what he'd forgotten. "Obvious, you stay here with Emmett and I go back out and conduct them."
Sherlock observed a flash of contempt on Evans' face, one corner of his mouth raised. It seems Lestrade had something hidden that Evans never expected to be brought up.
John watched the man from his perch on the stairs. The long Belstaf flowed behind Sherlock each time he changed direction, imitating a cape. He wished he could go over to him, wrap him in his arms and bury his face in his neck, then tell him they'll be able to read the files soon. He liked to think that Sherlock would actually be distracted by him, and focus his attention on John so the storm in his brain could calm down.
Hey guys I'm alive, I've just been dealing with some stuff. This chapter was meant to be twice as long as it is, but I didn't want to leave you guys without an update for another week so I cut out part of it and will include it in the next update.
Right. "I may have forgotten. But John, I'm not going to stay here and ignore the case just because you're unnecessarily worried. I don't think you've thought this through."
Satisfied, John let himself breathe again and turned back to the screen once more. Meanwhile, Sherlock had trouble returning to his own analysis due to the beating of his heart.
That night, Emmett already went off to sleep by ten, which left Sherlock and John alone. Sherlock spent some time intruder-proofing the flat. He tied a trip wire across the bottom of the doorway and secured it to the couch and a desk which he'd moved to the right position. Then he tied several cans filled with coins together and positioned it so that the string tying them all together, was held in place by the door latch. If opened, the cans would crash to the floor and surely wake up everyone. To top it off, he shoved the client chair under the door handle so whoever tried to get in would have to force the door loudly. He didn't bother with the windows because the fire escape led to his bedroom, and the others were on the second floor with no easy access.
Sherlock looked to John for help, but finding none he pouted and grabbed some bags to take upstairs.
John was confused, but finally understood what Sherlock was doing when he felt the steady thrum under his fingers. He was so grateful for this man. Having tangible and measurable proof of Sherlock's life helped chase away the last vestiges of panic from his nightmare. When his breathing was normal once more, he moved his hand down to settle across Sherlock's chest, but did not remove his body from the other man's.
After the first several people, Sherlock's mood was lowered abundantly as they all failed to answer what he considered basic questions or were too boring or Ella cried when they held her or, or, or. Mrs. Hudson told him he was maybe being too harsh and should let them have more time to answer such questions.
While putting the few items away, John kept stealing glances at Ella laying asleep in the cot. She seemed so peaceful, a complete opposite from their separation the previous day. Every time he looked at her, he felt a stirring in his gut, the same one he had looking at Sherlock. The feeling that said, "I would die for you in a heartbeat."
"I'm going to check in with Lestrade," John said as he left the room. One part of his mind called him a coward and the other part yelled at the former and said this wasn't the time.
Sherlock moved his hands away from Eleanor, he didn't want to accidentally harm her with his clenched fists.
The man cleared his throat, "I'm Emmett Wilson. I need your help because my mates are being killed and the police don't believe me. I go to this narcotics anonymous meeting on Sundays and you make friends there you know?" He sniffed. "It just happens in a place like that. But three months ago one of em didn't show up. That's not abnormal, but then he didn't come back at all. I tried going to his group home and they said he was dead. Back on the poison they said. I didn't believe it, he wouldn't've touched that stuff again."
Her departure made John realize how late it had gotten. "Sorry I didn't realize the time, you must be starving."
"Anyway, just letting you know I'm ordering Indian. You're going to eat, so I'm ordering your regular."
In the waiting room, John assisted Lestrade by calling some of the potential victims and informing them of everything. He finished his portion of the list just as Sherlock came back out into the room. John knew by his face that there was no luck.
After a couple more, the anxiety that Sherlock was going to leave again had mostly dissipated. Thanks in part to him promising that he would always involve John if people were threatened again, but also in part to Sherlock confessing that he realized while he had been away that they are much stronger together than they ever could be apart. And perhaps the whole fall could have been avoided had he involved John in his plans from the second Moriarty was released from prison.
SHerlocl rolls his eyes at him and faces the green bitches. "OUt of my entire analysis only one of you had scales large enough to match the ones found on Peaches' body."
side, pulling the covers on the other side back to leave an open invitation for John. John smiled and slipped into bed beside him. It was easy really.
He crumpled up that file too and once everything was in the pile, a box of matches appeared in his empty hands. He took out three and struck them across the black strip along the boxes side. Once lit, he tossed them on the pile along with the rest of the box and watched the contents of the cabinet become engulfed in flames.
John sighed internally at Sherlock's usual obliviousness to social norms, and flashed Emmett an apologetic smile in Sherlock's stead.
Hey guys, super long time no see. I super apologize but if it wasn't clear already, I have lost interest in this fandom. I discovered a video game and joined that fandom while writing the last few chapters of this fic and it ended up drawing my interest completely away from this fandom and by proxy this story. For a good while I was becoming more and more miserable in the BBC fandom and forced myself to stay because I had nothing else to go to. That's why the abandonment happened so quickly once I did happen upon a new fandom.
"Stop playing stupid. We have more than enough evidence to have you arrested right now. You'll have a lighter sentence if you just confess."
They stopped talking once they reached the ladder. It was important not to alert the landlord of their presence.
Sherlock grimaced at the feel of saliva and used the bib around her neck to wipe off his hand once he pulled her away.
The rest of the day went by slowly, as they had to reestablish a routine with Eleanor. They learned to take advantage of her naps by using them for experimenting (Sherlock) and finishing a blog post (John).
He could hear John groan as he stood up and padded upstairs. Sherlock sighed. He couldn't avoid the awkwardness after all.
Sherlock plugged in his own phone and turned out the light, then checked to make sure the door was open so any noise from the living area would wake them. Although he didn't plan on sleeping anyway. He couldn't let one second of this night go by not experienced.
Then John moved out of the way for Sherlock, giving Mrs. Hudson a view of Ella. She gasped and brought her hands together. "Oh, she's still here?"
The two woke later that evening, Sherlock annoyed, and John well rested. John ate and managed to force some food into the detective as well before heading back to Scotland Yard.
John turned and grabbed two mugs from the cabinet, then added their respective favorite teas (English breakfast for John, Earl Gray for Sherlock). Then he poured the hot water, not bothering to wait until the kettle fully boiled. While they steeped he prepared Sherlock's exactly the way he liked it and received the
Back at the Yard, Brown was still cuffed to the metal table in the interrogation room. He'd been given water and some food, but no contact besides that.
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement (Mrs. Hudson was still visiting her sister) and retrieved an outfit for her that was purple and covered in little daisies.
"I'm Sherlock Holmes, and this is my partner Dr. John Watson. We're investigating the murders of several people who are former patients of this center."
John froze and then closed his laptop and placed it on the side table, giving his full attention to Sherlock. "I forgave you, you know that."
"Sirens, mate. Anyway, you didn't think you could just walk out of here with a baby that has an amber alert did you?"
Prompt was that Sherlock and John have sex on an amusement park ride, wowee wubbzy my first sex scene.
John crossed his arms, "Unknown where Brown got the drugs from to do this, but I guess he'd just need money and...um."
Sherlock and John arrive at the windner's cricle and see Koopa Troppa, Iggy, and Bowserm lined up wiht police makring sure they stay in place. Sherlock takes a scaple and scrapes a few scales from each turtle and puts them in individual evidence bags to take back to the lab.
Sherlock said, "The radius is rather sizeable if we're talking about a straight line, but we're not. And with the amber alert going out on radios, any cabbie with half a brain would recognize him. Which concerns me now that I say it aloud. Perhaps the landlord will avoid getting in vehicles and because of the alert. There's no way he doesn't know. He was playing with us, going after someone else right when his partner was in custody. He's too confident."
As fast as they bothe wante dto go, John took his time ipneign Sherlock up so there would be no pain. Sherlock always complaine dbaout the speed and meticulosuness but JOn nknew He was secretly thankful.Greategul? Thankful idk
Sherlock's musing was interrupted by a furrowed brow forming on John's face. His face grew pinched in confusion as his eyes moved under his lids. Sherlock felt the urge to smooth a finger across the little wrinkle but refrained from doing so. Instead, he turned onto his other side and scooched backwards until John's chest was almost pressed against his back.
After the bath, Sherlock was back to his senses enough to stand at the window and wreak a cacophonous symphony out of his violin. As much as it grated on his ears, John couldn't agree with the sentiment more. The sun had set and London grew dark and the baby was still out there. John knew logically that even if the baby was abandoned somewhere without formula, she would survive for a while yet as long as she was bundled up. The thought was still painful though.
Sherlock began untacking all of the photos and documents and set them in a pile on the couch below him. He kept his face carefully blank and the new the sooner all visual stimuli were gone, the sooner he could work on deleting the whole mess from his mind palace. He'd gone after multiple serial killers anyway. He reasoned there was no dire need to keep this one in his vaults.
John rushed out of the building and was disappointed at the empty pavement until he spotted Sherlock leaning against the side of the building and smoking a cigarette. His heart twisted a bit, he knew what that meant.
“But you can’t have serial suicides,” said John, mystified. He was leaning heavily on his cane as his left foot slowly went numb in the snow.
“Drink?” asked Sherlock, taking two glasses and a bottle of whiskey from the liquor cabinet.  He poured them both drinks and then sat down across from John in a dark, leather armchair.
Sherlock pulled out his phone and started typing away.  “The snow ploughs haven’t been through yet and with the wind, the drifts could be treacherous.  You’re better off staying here.”
They stood there, grinning at each other like idiots in the doorway for several long seconds.  Standing and staring at someone for so long without saying or doing anything should have felt awkward but John found that he didn’t really want to move.  Neither, it seemed, did Sherlock.  John was in the middle of wondering if he could get thrown in the dungeon for trying to kiss the prince, and if it might be worth trying anyway, when there was a sound behind them.
“But that’s absurd,” he said.  “You can’t do that. By forming an association with me, you would give up any semblance of privacy, of a normal life.  You must have already seen that, even after our brief acquaintance.  What could possibly be worth trading for a life of unscrutinised freedom?”
A light came into the Prince’s eyes and a small grin flitted across his face.  “Seven o’clock then,” he said, moving towards the door again.  “Just meet me here.”
After this chapter, I won't be posting for a few days since I have yet to write the last few chapters.  At this point, I'm thinking there will be about 8 chapters total.  But I thought I got it to a nice little resolution where this story can rest for a few days until I get the next part done.
John would have been happy to just keep kissing and save the talking for the morning, but Sherlock eventually pulled back.
Sherlock flopped into a chair by the sitting room fire. John waffled for a minute, unsure if he should go sit down or go back to his room for the night.
John leaned over and saw the mud, just as Sherlock had said though he’d never have noticed it if it hadn’t been pointed out.  “Brilliant, breathed John.
After a few hours, the snow began to pick up again and, though it was still lights, it was beginning to get difficult to see.
John lay there for a while, tracing over Sherlock’s fingertips and knuckles.  His hands were soft, and his fingers were long and John was more than a little obsessed with them.
John kept moving, not wanting to interrupt what seemed to be an important conversation.  He found a spot at the edge of the room and settled in to watch the dancing and listen to the music, hoping just to say hello to Sherlock at some point during the evening.
He took a deep breath and opened the door.  Sherlock immediately stood from his seat by the fire and came over to him.  “John.  Good, you’re here. Come meet mummy,” he said as he took John by the arm and pulled him across the room.
“I’ll think you’ll find that he did,” said Sherlock. “Don’t worry.  You’ll be joining him soon enough.  If you’re lucky, they might even let you share a cell.”
“Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock appearing at the door again.  “Stop talking John’s ear off.  His tea’s getting cold.”
Sherlock was still talking as he flitted around the room picking up pillows only to replace them and moving things on the mantle slightly to the left or right.
As they were clearing away dessert, Violet turned to John and asked, “You are planning on coming to the ball, aren’t you?”
“Splatter pattern on the back of her right leg but not her left.  Indicates a medium sized carry on.”
John woke once in the middle of the night. He’d rolled over in his sleep and ended up with his nose buried in a puff of curly hair.  The surprise of it jolted him fully awake and the previous evening came flooding back to him.  Sherlock was already moving in concert with John, pressing his forehead to John’s chest and putting a hand on his hip.  On of Sherlock’s feet tangled with John’s.  John relaxed in to Sherlock’s grasp.
“I don’t have one.  We met-“John paused.  He knew it had only been yesterday but it seemed so much longer. “Yesterday.”
In the time it took John to find a fresh sweater in his suitcase, Sherlock was already dressed in yesterday’s clothes.
The library was a large room on the ground floor with floor to ceiling bookshelves that even had rolling ladders to get to the top shelves.  It looked out on to the decorative garden that John had seen from his room.  There were several soft looking arms chairs by the large windows and a fire had been lit and was crackling away.  It looked like a perfect place to spend the morning.
The bed was empty when John woke.  John tried not to take the emptiness personally, tried not to let it in.  But the warm glow that had been growing over the last few days was shrinking down in to a small, cold, black pit and the space that had been left behind felt empty and gaping.  Tomorrow John would leave, and he would never see Sherlock again.
Listen, when I sasi d horny cock I meant that bowser didn't literally do this because htat woul dbe too much for a me fic. Like my fics aren't that explicit okay.
Sherlokc though t wow, this boy defended him and was obviously not striahtgt. No straight person would do that. PRobably. It took him  a while to start playing again, but even then he only tried one song one more time before going home form the day.
The onslaught was immediate.  People rushed forward with shining, happy faces wanting to shake his and Sherlock’s hands.  Sherlock had a wide smile plastered on his face.  He wrapped an arm around John’s shoulders and pulled him tight to his side.  Sherlock seemed to be the one stable point in the mass of humanity around them, so John leaned in to his side, grateful for the support though he was more than a little angry and confused by the whole situation.
Sherlock went through the write ups, looking for anything to stand out. This quickly proved fruitless and John suggested they start by sorting everything. Sherlock agreed, knowing it would make it easier to find patterns. The deaths were sorted by drug used, body found inside or outside, and whether they were an addict or recovered addict at the time of death. It took until the sunrise ended, but they eventually had a full index. With only two victims to profile, the scope of other overdoses was too broad to search through. At this point, any one of them could be a murder victim.
Sherlock and John took a cab to Scotland Yard and met Lestrade outside the interrogation room occupied by one Logan Brown.
Now it was Sherlock's turn to grimace. "I don't need to and won't explain myself to you. Just put in the order and leave."
Sherlock tutted, "No this won't do, the lock on the door isn't even functional. Pack a bag for Baker Street."
"So we're in agreement." Sherlock stood up then abruptly fell back onto the couch when John's hand gripped his arm and tugged backwards.
Sherlock lightly smacked the hand that was still on his chest and John chuckled. Both froze though at the tiny sigh coming from the end of the bed. Thankfully it didn't turn into crying.
"Hold on, this is a really big deal, Sherlock. Adoption is huge, you can't just impulsively bring a human life into yours."
Sherlock was the first to break the silence, "As Mrs. Hudson no doubt informed you, we aren't taking new clients." He glanced up from his phone to give a quick fake smile, then froze, brain processing the data. The man's eyes were puffy and red, a crumpled tissue lay in his hand. Dried spit up stained the shoulder of his shirt, unwashed and wrinkled. The short sleeves on his shirt bared the healed track marks on his arms to Sherlock's flitting gaze. All points of data led Sherlock to one conclusion.
John stumlbeld into Sherlock’s (their) bedroom because he was holding Sherlock whose legs were wrapped around ihs wasist. He strode to the bed, the two otf them kissing all the while, and fell forwaed on top of Sherlock.
"I didn't have friends growing up. Nor did I at university. Except for one person." He paused to take a sip. "I met Victor Trevor in one of my higher level chemistry courses. He didn't react like the others did to my deductions, he was impressed. I did a lot of rude things to deter him, but he never gave up. It didn't take long before we started talking more and studying together. He was rather intelligent and we conducted experiments together. He introduced me to friendship. He introduced me to a lot of things." Sherlock frowned and downed the rest of his glass.
As he left to go upstairs and change, he heard Sherlock say, "Only because there are no baby monitors and I'm not getting up every time she cries."
Sherlock grabbed the pair on top to inspect it better. It was a boxer brief style that had tiny images of beakers and Erlenmeyer flasks. It was dotted with little bubbles and the containers were filled with different colored liquids (purple, green, and red). This was to both Sherlock’s surprise and delight. As much as he liked to think he was above everyone, he was a fucking nerd.
Sherlock wrung his hands together. "Have I done something? I know I slip up sometimes, but I've been cleaning up after experiments with organic or hazardous materials and not playing the violin loudly when you're trying to sleep and paying the rent on time though that's actually Mycroft's doing-"
Sherlock sneered, "Most of your victims proved this to be nothing but a myth spread by those who lack empathy and brain cells. Congratulations, you've done nothing but waste resources yourself for committing these crimes in the first place. Now
She knows? How does she know? John's face heated and his heart rate picked up at the thought of someone knowing. It would be more likely for Sherlock to deduce his feelings the more people who know.
Once everything was set up to his specifications (laptop on hardwood so it wouldn't overheat and toys in front of him but off the blanket he draped on the floor). "Emmett was it?"
Lestrade raised his eyebrows, but didn't comment. "Believe it or not Sherlock, we figured all of that out already. I wanted you to see the scene yourself though, since the other victim we believe is from the same killer has long been cleared up."
Sherlock smirked at the fact that Lestrade hadn't considered they already searched it themselves. "No need, it was on the patient information list."
). At least he had the foresight to change into pajamas earlier, so he didn't have to walk in the room clad only in a towel. As much as he wanted John to be with him undressed, he'd just feel vulnerable given that there was no guarantee of reciprocal feelings.
Sherlock gracefully made his way back over, avoiding stepping on any 'evidence' the investigation team was photographing. "They struggled, obviously. He was prepared, paranoid, and tried to subdue the attacker. But somehow the killer got the upper hand. Maybe he was able to get his gun out. I don't know."
Sherlock reached into his breast pocket to retrieve something that he held tightly in his hand. He looked up to John’s face.  His eyes were red rimmed making the blue even more vivid and there where honest to God tears gathering at the corners.
“To be with you,” said John.  Sherlock’s eyebrows rose, threatening to disappear in to his curly, dark fringe.
John followed behind Sherlock as he ran through the back streets of the village.  They crashed through gardens and over walls.  They climbed up a snowbank and on to the roofs, running along the high street, the Christmas lights flashing as they ran past.  They ducked through a trap door and in to a theatre where there was a production of the Nutcracker in progress.  They ran through the back stage and out a side door.  Across the street and through a Christmas market and John nearly ran in to Sherlock as he careened in to the front of the cab.
“What are you doing back here?” he asked, softly.  He was cradling John’s cheek in his hand and brushing his thumb across John’s chin and lips in a very distracting way.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed to John’s. He slid his hand up to cup John’s jaw and angled his head to stare directly into his eyes.  John felt like Sherlock was seeing into his brain and reading his thoughts in the electrical impulses there.  “Have you really thought about this?” he asked.  “Have you really considered what this would mean for you?”
John made himself as presentable as he could in his yesterday’s suit before venturing out of his room.  He had no idea where to go or even what he should be doing.  He considered texting Sherlock, but he thought if he wandered long enough, he’d find a servant or someone who could help him.  He went back up the corridor the way he’d come last night.  The palace was very still as though the snowy quiet from outside had made its way inside.
He quickly used the loo to shower and do his business, making sure to artfully style his curls as usual. He dressed in a suit, including the jacket as some form of armor.
When their little meal was complete, Sherlock came downstairs with John. John wondered if he just didn't want to be alone until he spotted the man staring at the case wall. Shit. He knew he forgot something earlier.
“I should have thought that was obvious,” said John, still grinning. He leaned up for another kiss.  Sherlock kissed him back for a moment but pulled away again quickly.
John dress quickly and made his way to the sitting room.  Violet, Mycroft, and his wife were already seated around a low table covered in Christmas presents.  Coffee and tea and an already picked over tray of cinnamon rolls were on a table.
“Your defense of Sherlock in this manner shows that you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about either,” said Simon through an icy grin.  “You should take a bit of your own advice.”
Two hours later, the plane landed in Aldovia.  At security, John thanked Christ again that the UK was still in the EU, at least for the moment.  The Aldovian airport was shut down and dark as his was the last plane to land.  He raced passed the rest of the travellers to the taxi stand.  He was in the taxi, pulling away from the airport by 23:15.
Sherlock led John down the hill and into the lodge.  John stood just inside the doorway, brushing snow off his coat, and kicking it off his boots while Sherlock ran around the lodge, tracking snow everywhere.  There was already wood in the fireplace and Sherlock knelt to light the kindling.  A blazing fire sprung up so quickly that it almost seemed like magic.  There was a large Christmas tree on the far wall and garlands along the railings and banisters.  Sherlock flipped a switch, and the lights came on, bathing the inside of the lodge with a warm glow.  The lodge was much more casual than the palace and John could actually see himself feeling at home in it.
By the time they returned to the palace, John had begun to really enjoy the ride and was thinking how much he’d enjoy driving like that one day.  Still, when he tried to follow Sherlock off the snowmobile, his leg buckled, just for a moment, from the adrenaline of the ride.
They also discussed John’s background in the military and his medical career.  Violet asked many of the same questions Sherlock had though in a much less intense and probing way.
Sherlock thought for a long moment.  A small wrinkle appeared between his eyes as though it were important that he come up with the exact right description.  “Very kind,” he said, finally.
“Sherlock,” said John again, insistently. “That’s all you and I love you.” The words were out before John realized they were coming but he found he didn’t want to take them back. Sherlock went completely still again, looking over John’s head with the same odd, wide eyed expression.  He slowly released John’s hand and wound his hand around John’s back to clutch at his shirt, holding him still.
He gave up and reached for his phone.  On the front page of the Aldovian Times website was a picture of Sherlock from the Boxing Day press conference with a headline that read ‘Missing Prince?’
“They’re all so fake,” said Sherlock.  “It’s revolting.  They only show interest when there’s something for them to gain.  And they’re all so self-serving, only concerned with their own estates and staff and ponies.  It disgusts me.”
“Oh, good,” said Violet, standing and making her way out of the room.  Mycroft and Matilda followed behind her.
“Of course,” said Angelo, finally releasing him.  “Anything you want, on the house.  Sherlock here got me out of a tight spot,” he said, turning to John.
“Shall we?” asked Violet, coming up to John’s side and giving him her arm so that he could lead her in to the dining room.
Sherlock smiled a Cheshire cat grin.  “Oh, we are not nearly as important as your British royal family is, John.  Though, technically I should have alerted someone before I left the palace.  But Mycroft will have had eyes on me from the moment I got into the cab with you.”
Sherlock’s face immediately softened, and a look of relief spread over his face.  John suddenly wanted nothing more in the world to hug him or kiss him or even just to take his hand and reassure him that he’d given the best gift, and the most perfect reminder of their time together, that he could have.
The speech ended with the royal family and the assembled crowd singing “Joy to the World”.  In the distance, just a few seconds before what was being broadcast on the tele, John could hear the actual voices singing outside the palace.
As they walked, John asked Sherlock about the piece of music they’d been listening to and was still in the middle of telling John about the composer’s life as a Catholic priest in Renaissance Spain.  He was expounding on the architecture of the cathedrals of the period and the acoustics they used to project music and create a spiritual atmosphere by the time they arrive at John’s door.
“Mycroft’s,” said Sherlock.  “I’ll make sure he gets it back.  Now, I need to work on this analysis.  It will take some time and I’m sure it won’t be interesting to you.”
“Ok,” said John.  He was not particularly interested in walking through the maze of corridors back to his room when he could stay right here.  And, though the danger seemed to have passed, he still wanted to keep Sherlock as close as possible.
“The one you wore the other day didn’t really seem warm enough for trapsing around the snow,” said John.
The winding approach to the castle at night was even more stunning than during the day. Every surface was covered in lights so that the white stone walls seemed to be glowing.  It should have been tacky but it was charming in its way.  John wondered if he would meet any of the rest of the royal family.  He couldn’t imagine what sort of family could have produced a man like Sherlock.  Were they all  brilliant and eccentric or were they all mundane and normal as though Sherlock had taken everything interesting and kept it to himself?
“Sorry about that,” said Sherlock.  “Some people put a lot of stock in the fact that I was born into a specific family.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, cutting her off.  “A table for two.  That one is fine.”  He stalked off across the pub to an empty table by the front window with John and the flustered waitress trailing behind.  Sherlock took his seat and John sat as well.
Sherlock gave him a look that John was beginning to think meant Sherlock thought he was being an idiot.  “I have an entire palace at my disposal.  It wouldn’t be an imposition.”
Mycroft opened John’s gift next.  John couldn’t help but keep half an eye on Sherlock’s expression as Mycroft pulled the paper away.  John had gotten him a €5 mug from a tourist shop in the village.  It depicted the palace with Aldovia’s highest mountain and the most picturesque of the villages houses in the background.
The street in front of the house was crawling with police officers and there was police tape across the pavement and the front door of the house.
“My aunt was fine,” said John, after the scrutiny because too much.  “She’s still around, back home in England.”
“What is your connection to my brother?” he asked.  He was still smiling, but the smile didn’t meet his eyes.
A man was sitting in the middle of a storage room, surrounded by shelves piled with bags of pasta and flour.  His forearms tied to the armrests of the chair he sat in and a uniformed police officer was sitting nearby, keeping her eye on him.  DI Lestrade and Mrs Hudson, were standing to the side, talking.  On the self-nearest them, sat the two offending champagne flutes.
John eventually dozed off but was woken by the feeling of a hand on his knee.  Sherlock was kneeling in front of John’s chair, shaking his knee gently.  John smiled lazily at Sherlock and stretched in the chair, arching his back to get the kinks in his shoulders out.  “What time is it?” he asked.
John watched Sherlock for the smallest sign that he wasn’t misreading the situation and that Sherlock would be receptive to the things that the rest of his mind and body were screaming for.  But Sherlock was the prince and surely it had to be against the rules for someone as normal as John to kiss him.  And more importantly, John considered the little of Sherlock’s upbringing and life at the palace he’d been able to glean.  He knew that Sherlock hadn’t had many opportunities for friendship and maybe he didn’t know what his body language was telegraphing to John.  Maybe Sherlock was just happy to have someone to spend time with after so much loneliness.
Sherlock finally turned around and looked at him, his face impassive and shrugged.  “Thanks,” he said, almost as an afterthought.
After a few minutes, John was awake and his dream had dissolved, leaving a warm feeling in his chest.  He got out of bed and pulled back the heavy curtain.  Outside, deep snow covered what appeared to be an ornamental garden and more was continuing to come down.  Unless the snow stopped soon, John wasn’t sure it he would make it back to the hotel that day.
John yanked back, bring Sherlock to a halt.  He put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face, holding him place so John could look at him.  “Sherlock, we don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with.  We can sit and talk, or we can do more of what we’ve been doing.  It’s all fine. Whatever you want.”
John pulled at his tie and the cuffs of his jacket.  He hoped he wouldn’t stick out too much from what was likely to be a very posh crowd.  He was glad he’d brought the suit with him.  Part of Harry’s trip had included a reservation at a very fancy restaurant that couldn’t be canceled.  But the suit was at least five years out of date, certainly from before his army years.  Well, the worst thing that could happen would be getting thrown out and he wouldn’t be any worse off than he was and he’d get a good story out of it.
They both stopped talking again.  John hadn’t known what he’d been about to say except he couldn’t stop hearing Mycroft say Sherlock didn’t want to pursue any kind of relationship with him.  “Go ahead,” he said.
A young waitress scurried over to them as they stood by the door.  The waitress curtsied gamely.  “Your Highness,” she said.  “We didn’t know you’d be in tonight.  But, um, thank you for coming in.  I’m sure Angelo will be pleased to know you’re here.  Can I-“
“Wait a minute,” said John, watching as Sherlock typed the number from the bottom of the card into John’s phone.  “Is that the pink lady’s card?”
Sherlock brushed past John and out the door, but he paused before he pulled it shut.  “Goodnight, John.”
“I agree,” said Sherlock, grinning.  “Come on.  There’s music starting in the next room.  It’s the only tolerable part of this whole affair.”  They made their way through the crowd to the exit but were waylaid by the Tall, Dark and Smarmy and his friend, Slinky Red Dress.
“That was excellent, John,” said Sherlock’s voice in his ear, sending shivers down his spine.  He turned and once again Sherlock was standing too close to him.
“She’s clearly from out of town, there’s a receipt from today from an airport in France.  She hadn’t checked in to her hotel yet.  She matches her nails to her shoes.  She wouldn’t leave the hotel with her hair looking like that.  I would say she’s in town for one or two nights, judging from the size of the suitcase.”
“That too,” said Angelo.  “But I was talking about setting me up to cater the big garden party up at the palace every summer.  It’s done wonders for my business.”
“John!” she said in a cheerful voice that had a false ring to it.  “So lovely to see you!”  She threw her arms around him and pulled him in to a hug.  Then she turned to face the rest of the room, her arm around his shoulders.  “No need to make him feel self-conscious, everyone.  As you were.”
They trudged through the woods, Sherlock describing how to identify the twelve different types of pine tree that grew there and pointing out the burrows of animals hiding away for the winter.  At one point, Sherlock grabbed John’s arms and shushed him and then a giant stag with massive branching antlers walked across their path.
John felt Sherlock shudder, his face still hidden in John’s neck.  Then Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him, pulling them close together.  Sherlock took several deep breaths, then pulled back and stared pulling John to the bed by the hand.
John just let Sherlock burrow and pressed a quick kiss into Sherlock’s hair.  He felt Sherlock shift under the covers and then he was kissing John’s chest.
“Yes, well,” said Sherlock, staring out the window.  “It’s enough to make some people lose their tiny minds.”
John followed Sherlock into the room and stood awkwardly near the door.  Sherlock was on the other side of the room.  He picked up a stack of paper and was looking through them, putting them back down on the desk apparently at random.
“Thanks, Mrs Hudson,” said John.  He flicked on the TV and picked at his sandwich until the Aldovian Royal crest filled the screen and a blare of trumpets pulled his attention with laser focus.
“Mrs. Hudson?” asked John.  “Sherlock was telling me about you.  He said you’re a forced to be reckoned with.”  He took a step forward and reached out to shake Mrs. Hudson’s hand.
“Both the glasses will contain the poison,” said Sherlock.  “John certainly wasn’t the intended victim in this case.  He was trying to poison me but he was not afraid of causing some collateral damage.”
The cab pulled up into the snowy, circular drive.  It hadn’t snowed in the two days that he’d been in Aldovia.  Why was there still snow on the royal drive?  He opened the door and stepped out of the car, putting his foot, in his nicest pair of shoes, in a pile of slush.  John was just reaching into his pocket for his wallet when he heard a commotion behind him.
As the train neared the airport, his heart rate gradually began to increase until he was bouncing his heel and feeling queasy.  When the train pulled into the station, John was positioned at the doors and he took off like a sprinter at the pistol when they opened.  He raced through the nearly empty airport, thanking Christ for the light New Year’s Eve traffic.  The security line was short and after a quick race through the terminal, he was at the gate.
