Well that was a surprise to him. Balthazar and Dean working together to do something for him? He knew his boyfriend had some reservations regarding his new friend, but this was evidence that he was at least trying to get along with him and that warmed Castiel’s heart.
Cas cocked his head to the side and furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. That little motion was somehow the most attractive thing Dean had ever seen.
A wave of worry tumbled over him at that. So he could tell Dean, but the topic was a secret. That was suspicious in itself, but he still scheduled the when and where with the man. He would be picking him up from school after the study group and dropping him off at home so he could spend time with his father that he’d practically abandoned. He showered, brushed his teeth, and finally met Dean in the kitchen.
“As long as I know where we stand then yes. I would never suggest you change careers to be with me.”
“I’m glad you like it.” Dean made another mental note about what Cas had said. He was grateful that he wasn’t going to push the subject. Dean knew his personality and he needed that once in a while. Just let him know that you’re there for him and that’s all he wanted. Eventually he would come around….if he was pushed to the very edge.
“He was pretty big when I was first starting out. I got really popular pretty fast and his manager got wind of that. Thought it’d boost us both up if we did a scene together. The only time I fully regretted saying yes.”
Dean moved through his kitchen with ease. Sure he helped put everything away so it wasn’t like he didn’t know where things were, but it had a pleasant air of domesticity that Castiel enjoyed. They sat in the plush second hand chairs and ate in contented silence. He found himself watching Dean more than eating. The other man didn’t have the best table manners, but he ate with a passion. Castiel had come to the realization that Dean did most things with passion. When he set forth to do something he followed it through, trying his best to do well for others. It was a quality that he admired in him, what draws him to him. Currently his aura was shiny and bright, yellows, pinks, and blues all twirled around one another. It was beautiful to watch.
“So Cas,” Sam started at they unloaded the impala trunk of the blankets and cooler they brought, “Do you have any siblings?”
Castiel put Dean’s hands to his belt, prompting him to do all the work for him. Of course Dean did it as slow as possible. He knew what it would do to Castiel and sure enough he was half hard in his pants and haven’t even been touched yet. Once they were open Dean did what Castiel wanted him to do and grabbed two handfuls of his ass. He moved forward to kiss Cas’ neck earning him a flavorful moan of encouragement. As he moved closer to the center of Castiel’s bottom he froze. Cas smiled at this knowing Dean had finally found his surprise.
Just before he closed his eyes he could hear banging on the bathroom door, it got more and more urgent the longer that Dean didn’t answer it. He couldn’t right now. He couldn’t move anything but his eyes. The last thing he heard before his eyes closed was his little brother screaming his name.
Mary sighed at this and he could tell she was refraining an eye roll. “Talk to Missouri about it before you make a decision on that.”
They sat there and watched as the man brought the book and Charlie took photos of the spell. Rowena looked much more pleased than she should of, a borderline grin on her face.  Dean had a churning in his gut, that this wouldn’t turn out well.
“On one condition.” He popped his messy head up, gazing at Dean with low lidded eyes. “I get to join you in this shower.”
“Dean decided—as he does so often—to unload on me in times of trouble. He was worried about ‘the hot student with the blue eyes’, his words not mine.”
Here's a little ditty I threw together because the next chapter is quite long and is going to take me a while to edit. Anyways I hope you enjoy this spicy little chapter!
“So, you need to know that if you hurt him, I’m capable of many things.” She raised an eyebrow that didn’t quite match the smirk on her face.
As he gathered his breath and the pieces of his brain, he turned to look at the other man, only to have their lips meet in a heated kiss. His hand shot out to wrap around the back of Dean’s neck, pulling him closer and biting his bottom lip. The only thing that caused them to pull back was the sound of his doorbell.
“I’m not too sure about that. Right now the answer is no, but I don’t know how I’ll feel once I’ve let it process.”
“How you been son?” he asked but his eyes were focused elsewhere. Dean followed his gaze to find everyone else with a stern cold look on their face. They were ready. So ready to protect Dean at the first sight of this meeting going wrong. It eased some of Dean’s nerves and gave him a sense of calm he didn’t think would be possible right now.
“Oh no Dean. You didn’t tell me this was a milestone to be celebrated.” He was beginning to be disappointed in himself.
Cas felt a growl grow within him and before he could move Dean had crossed the room and stood at his side.
“I wrapped it up and put it in the fridge. Come on if you’re hungry. I’m absolutely famished.” He turned too head towards the kitchen.
A light knock on his door letting him know Castiel was finally there. He practically tore the door off the hinges to see the younger man standing in front of him. He wore a gray hoodie that fit kind of snugly and a pair of dark jeans that also fit nice on his long, slim legs. His hair was tousled in every imaginable direction and Dean loved it. Taken back by his beauty he just kind of stood there awkwardly.
He clicked out of the video and went to the next one. This time one of the men was blind folded as the other man lapped up his shaft and had his fingers in him. Again something was taken away from the man and despite that he was enjoying what was happening to him. Castiel then heard Dean’s room door being opened and shut and he quickly closed out of the folder and opened the internet browser. With some quick thinking he searched a topic for his biology class and opened several articles to give the appearance that he was doing things for school.
Gabe went next and loved the baking set Cas had gotten him. Chuck had gotten him a $500 visa gift card to buy things for his new home and Dean got him a pot set for it as well. He clapped Dean on the back at the gesture.
After he cleaned himself up he had a newfound resolve. For their Friday date, their 3 month anniversary he would recreate this scene.
“Have fun angel.” Dean kissed him on the forehead before he got out of the car. “I’m gonna check out that hardware store we passed on the way over.”
“I feel good Dean.” Cas said as he dragged his hands down Dean’s chest his eyes following their trail.
“Because I know what it means to be deeply hurt by someone you cared about, someone you trusted in.”
“It’s a possibility. I’ve never been in contact with such a creature, but from what you’ve told me I can draw that conclusion.”
Castiel snapped his head up at the all too familiar voice that was flooding the space with its sarcasm and laughter. His skin crawled at the noise and he knew just who it was, and that he wasn’t alone. Both he and Balthazar turned their heads to see Dick entering with two of his lackeys trailing close behind, a sneaky smile plastered on all their faces. He back up to the wall with Balthazar standing in front of him.
“Alright alright I hear you. I’m again, just concerned.” He put a hand up to stop the direction that the conversation was going down. “I just thought you should know that our dad is back in rehab. Bobby threatened him with a lot of things including a restraining order. I’m not putting any stock in this since he’s been in rehab several times and it’s done nothing for him, but I thought you should know.”
“Well I’m here to make sure he keeps it up. One hair missing from your head and I swear I’ll remove his—“
“Castiel.” she began. “You have a strong connection with the world around you. I can see it all over you. You don’t have to explain yourself or your past, but I’ve seen the way that people are drawn to you. Something has manifested within you.”
Though he knew full well what Dean meant the statement still stung a little. He hadn’t told Dean too much about him. Fearing that he would run away, or be disgusted with him he avoided the conversation altogether. He wanted nothing more than to prove Dick wrong.
“No sweetheart.” Dean’s calloused hand reached out to cup the side of his face. “Far from it. Totally opposite direction.”
That was fine and dandy if those were the rules, he was quite confident with his hands, and he had an idea of what Dean liked based on the way he did it to himself the last time. He didn’t take too long with the circling, just went ahead and plunged a finger inside. He was off to a good start if the man’s sharp intake of breathe was anything to go off of. He watched as the man moaned around a bite of the pie, waiting until he finished to put another finger in.
“Wait bro! No come on don’t do this to me please. You know how big he is in the industry. I need this! Please Cassie.”
Once in the kitchen he cracked several eggs, mixing them with some seasoning and had them in the pan and cooking before Cas finished pouring their glasses of orange juice. He watched them sizzle while he got lost in his thoughts. His dad was due to be released from rehab tomorrow. Bobby was going to pick him up and he would live at his place until he got back on his feet…if he ever did. John friggin Winchester, the bane of Dean’s existence. On the surface Dean abhorred the man with everything that was in him. The things he made him do through the years were enough to warrant ages of therapy, but the abuse was even worse. Deep down Dean knew he still loved the man, but he refused to let himself feel those feelings, scared to let his dad back in when he had done so much damage.
So this was all for him. All they needed to discuss had left his head the second he took in the sight of the man, and as he walked into the room it was the farthest thing from his one track mind. Approaching the bed he toed off his shoes and knee crawled until he was right behind Dean, but not touching him.
Castiel had never had phone sex before, never saw the point in it and rather would be a man of action. That was until Dean, and his sweet voice and sounds rang out directly into his ears. Slowly he gripped the base of himself in intervals several times to get himself under control. There was a first time for everything and he planned to savor this first.
“What is he up to?” Dean squinted, completely abandoning his food for the topic he found more interesting.
Dean’s aura was the most interesting one he’d seen thus far, at first glance it was guarded and dark, rough around its edges. But Castiel wasn’t the kind of person to take things at face value so he looked a bit deeper to find the chaotic warmth that was really inside Dean, the things that he didn’t show on the outside. It had to be the most beautiful aura he’d seen in a long time, almost pained him to look at its true form. With vibrant yellows and reds, underneath the level of murkiness Dean was a wonderful person. He pondered what kind of life this beautiful man had been given that he had to guard all that gorgeous light inside him.
Kevin’s computer let out a single ding. He rushed over to it and left Castiel alone with his sandwich and bag of chips. He was happy the guy was at least eating now. And the Gatorade was working wonders, he was already gaining some color back into his skin. After tapping through a couple things he realized he’d received a reply from Dean.
It was a warm night and Dean decided it would be fun to head down to the skating rink. He’d been around that area a lot as a teen, but went less and less in his early adult years. He’d asked Cas if he’d ever gone skating before and he hadn’t. So he’d be teaching the man how to, and he would never pass at a chance to hold Cas’ hand or any part of him for that matter. When they got to the rink it was just as Dean remembered. The scent of stale popcorn and flat soda stuck to the walls and in the air of this place. The padding around the wooden floors was all torn up and taped together, the carpet held decades old stains on top of late 80’s space graphics. The arcade wasn’t changed either, the only machines that halfway worked were the skeeball ones. The wood of the rink itself, always in pristine condition, like all the money they made went to upkeeping it alone.
And Dean took all of it. Drinking down every drop that came out, and Castiel threw his head back at the sensation. Dean pulled off with a pop and he sat back staring at a torn apart Castiel looking very pleased at what he had done to him.
After the whole distraction and wonderful orgasm that Dean had provided him they spent a good deal of time just talking and hanging out. He’d put on a movie they’d already seen just to have a little background noise while they ate and chat. It felt more like a first date than a post coital hangout. Castiel had very much wanted to satisfy Dean as well, but the man had denied him, telling him he could take care of him next time. It was nice to hear that there was a possibility of a future and that this wasn’t just a one and done.
Cas whined in response by that but listened obediently. He knew that he was always rewarded greatly when he did listen. Dean repositioned, laying on his back closer to the headboard. He beckoned the other over on top of him, knees on either side of his head. His dick jutting out and hitting the cool wood sent a pleasure shock through him and he shivered at the sensation.
“I want to ask you something Cas. And I want you to have a clear head and by open minded and honest with me.”
“First of all stop pacing before you put a hole in my carpet. And can you hand me a bottle? I think Mark is waking up.” He looked down and the tiny baby bundled up in his arms.
The loss of Jess hit everyone hard. She died in childbirth while having little Mark, only holding him for a few minutes before slipping away. Sam was a wreck, but Dean was there to help pick up the pieces. Their schedules in sync so they could take turns caring for the child. This was Dean’s weekend to care for him. He was about to turn a year old in a couple of days. Dean even planned his birthday party, not letting Sam have any say in the matter. He liked the idea of throwing a little shindig for the guy and happily let Dean take over. Dean wanted to celebrate him as well as distract Sam since his child’s birth was also Jess’ death anniversary.
“Focus dammit.” He hissed aloud at the intrusive thoughts that surrounded the thoughts of his angel. His angel, he thought and smiled to his self.
“Yeah well you did, and now Dad is in there talking to who knows who about this—situation we got going on.”
“You absolutely don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. Hell you could tell me to drop it and we’ll never have to speak about it again.”
They talked for who knows how long, catching up on everything that happened while they were apart. Fell asleep like two teens with a budding romance, Castiel forgot to plug his phone in that night, and woke up extremely late the next morning.
“Henry I think you need to leave. I’ve already said no and I don’t think there’s anything else to discuss.”
That night was filled with food and laughter. It was a little awkward at first, but soon enough the trio fit together like old friends and Dean truly had a good time. His brother and his lover coming together to keep him together. It was warm and exciting and he was very satisfied with how the two got along. They could nerd out together, leaving Dean out of the conversation, but he didn’t feel uncomfortable or left out. He felt the complete opposite of those. He sat back in his suede chair and just enjoyed watching the two of them enjoy each other.
If he was saying what Castiel thought he was saying, then Dean wanted to try switching places. It was a new and exciting thought, one that could be read in his dirtiest fantasies. He always assumed that he would be the bottom, Dean had never discussed otherwise, and when it came time for them to lay together it always happened the same way. A bud of anxiety rang through him as doubting thoughts pressed their way through his mind, but just as that began to happen Dean pushed a sloppy kiss onto his lips thus wiping the thoughts away.
Seems like it would take much longer than either man expected before they could come together again. Dean had several shoots in a row, and Castiel was in full prep mode for his trip. By the time one was done, the other was busy and it wore on each of them in different ways. Dean was all around irritated, snapped on multiple people several times and had to offer more apologies than he’d had to in a long time. Castiel was anxious, had packed, unpacked, repacked all of his necessities and gear at least three times because he swore that he’d forgotten something (he didn’t). Gabriel took this as an opportunity to tease him, and received a cuss out session like he never had from his brother.
Hey hey! Here's another addition to this. I've been struggling with a nasty cold so I'm trying my best to write as much as I can. As far from over as this story is I've also been writing another Destiel fic. When an idea hits I can't resist them. It'll bother me until I write it down. No warnings for this chapter. It's pretty fluffy, but the next chapter.......I'll apologize in advance for that. As always thank you so much for reading and commenting. It brings me joy!
Sam and Charlie then returned to the table with beers in hand and smiles plastered on their sneaky faces. It was a bad idea leaving them alone together. Dean could feel it in his gut that a plan was now brewing between them.
Castiel was teetering now, between being awake and being unconsciousness. His head pounded in pain from the blows and from his fall. His wrists must’ve been torn up with how much he’d struggled at his restraints. With how long they’d kept him tied up in that position he could hardly feel his arms at all. In and out he went, he lost large chunks of time, but even with that he could tell they were moving him.
He couldn’t even begin to put a name to the thumping feeling in his chest hearing that Cas had enjoyed himself that night. He’d heard it from the man himself but it kind of hit stronger learning that he was talking about it to someone else like it was the event of the year.
“Sam I have no intentions of leaving Dean. He has shared his past relationship failures with me and I refuse to be one of those peoples. He’s not the only one with bad things behind him.” Castiel was getting a bit annoyed with Sam’s accusatory tone. He was aware that being with Dean was not an easy task. The man had a lot of dirt in his backstory, many things he was still working through. But Castiel intended to be with him through all of it. The good always outweighs the bad with Dean.
"Why not just stop the program?" Castiel asked her. "Just let Dean and I go now, and then, whatever happens, is no longer your responsibility?"
"No, I mean... maybe... I am not sure... I mean, I-" Dean stuttered before being interrupted by another voice.
"Castiel, there are only two options to protect you from the Empty. I cannot rightfully or ethically send you into a situation that would bring you harm." Chamuel cut him off.
Finally, Dean saw something. He let out a huge sigh of relief. It was nice to learn that he wasn't blind. It was just dark as hell. He kept inching his way forward and was able to see there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Within a minute or so, his eyes began to adjust to the distant lighting. Which meant he could finally figure out where the hell he was. After a quick glance around, Dean realized that he must be in some sort of cave or mining system. In retrospect, that seemed to make sense, but he still didn't know how he got there in the first place.
"You mean the image projection or virtual reality thing he got like a million rounds ago?" Dean asked.
"Are you tempting me to be the first? Cause I will, just in spite of that bitch." Dean replied, grinning like an evil scientist.
Cas took a few steps forward towards Dean, but Dean took a few steps back in return. It may have not been an intentional reaction on Dean's part, but it was still a response, nonetheless.
The four of them met outside as to not alert Dean of their discussion. After an hour, they came up with a pretty solid game plan.
Castiel hardly ever cussed, so something must honestly be bugging him about his experience. Dean put a pin in that, but before he confronted Cas about it, he needed answers. "Well, who was getting married..?" Dean attempted to ask nonchalantly. He was still somewhat nervous that Castiel still experienced something similar to what he did behind his door.
So, Dean followed Sam quietly down the hallway to where the rest of the group was standing outside Jack's door.
After a minute of silence, though, Dean had gotten annoyed of being stuck alone in his own thoughts. He preferred to stay out of his emotional headspace at all cost. So, even if the memory frozen before them was a brief happy moment, it still served as a reminder to Dean that his mother was gone now...for the second time.
"You couldn't just humor me just this once, could you?" Dean asked sarcastically, causing Castiel to tilt his head in confusion. "... Nevermind. The card says both on it, right?" Castiel nodded. "Alright, so that means we both need to answer or project or whatever the hell it's called when you answer a prompt by projecting an image via magic."
Dean swallowed. How was he supposed to go about this? The angel had hardly any experience in the field of physical intimacy, and while the thoughts of the two of them together had crossed Dean's mind before, actually being forced to act upon it had not. He never thought that kissing his best friend would ever become part of a life or death situation... but here they are.
This is a very very very long chapter, but it's worth it, I promise. So grab some popcorn. I won't spoil anything, but a lot is about to go down ;)
"The fact that you just expelled Gabriel from your vessel." Castiel stated as if he did not hear the sarcasm in Dean's previous question.
"Just follow me" Dean replied, opening up the walk-in freezer and stepping inside. Castiel followed close behind.
Castiel quickly pushed Dean back a bit, away from his lips to survey the hunter's face. However, Dean only leaned forward to chase Castiel's lips, despite the short distance Castiel's arms had put in between them. Cas had to keep his elbows locked to keep Dean at bay. Dean opened his eyes and quirked his eyebrows in an adorably confused facial expression.
"Well, you could have qued me in on this plan before you just kissed me out of nowhere!" Castiel exclaimed, still not looking directly at Dean.
This was definitely not the right thing to say because Castiel just glared at him and rolled his eyes.
This time Castiel spoke directly facing the hunter with a serious expression. "Lying causes damage probably more often than the truth does. At least with the truth, you have a sturdy foundation to fall back on. With lies, your foundation is like quicksand. You sink right in until you can't get out. But by then it's too late."
Dean forced himself up onto his feet and headed towards Room 4. The room was only a short distance away from where the boys had been seated, but it felt a lot longer than that to Dean. His legs were shaky and seemed as if they would give at any moment. His mind was weighed down by what Castiel may or may not have hinted at in the previous round. His thoughts were racing around in his head like horses running around a track.
"Because he was my son Dean. I saw him as my son, and I treated him like my son. I didn't think he would go and die before I did. I protected him from eternal nothingness, and I know you would do the same... maybe not for Jack but for Sam."
Dean picked up the card and read out loud, "Picture This: Show the other what you each experienced during room 5? Finally! The cards are on my side! IT'S A FUCKING MIRACLE. Either way, ladies first. Plus, I really want to focus on your face when I prove you wrong, so I'll go last."
When the space between them became nonexistent, the two men were now chest to chest, just staring at one another. Castiel's eyes widened in shock. It was clear that Castiel still had no clue what was going on, and whatever Dean was about to do, he was clearly hesitant about it.
For some unknown reason, Castiel's eyes looked anxious now, and his wings begin to shake. The tremor was not as violent as it had been when they just started the round, but it was still enough movement for Dean to notice the change.
"Gladly!" Dean fake curtsied. "Get ready to see just how right I am." Dean closed his eyes and pictured his experiences in room 5.
The gesture, however, didn't stop a pleased smile from spreading across Dean's face. "Well, it seems to be working. So if you ask me - Mission accomplished!" He smirked
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. One hand pulling him closer and the other combing slowly through his hair, pulling on it slightly at times to amplify the moment or movement in one way or another.
"Just complete the game, the loser drinks the smoothie over there, and the door will unlock. Best of luck, boys!" She winked at Dean, and in a blink, she was gone.
Though Deanna was not too thrilled about being locked out. The chick started banging on the door and yelling out practically every profanity in the book while Dean attempted to catch his breath.
Quickly the angel grabbed the hunter's hand and began pulling him through the tunnel. Dean tried to swipe his hand out of Castiel's grasp, but his efforts were futile. Despite Castiels dwindling grace, he still was much stronger than Dean.
Castiel shut him up with a kiss, ending it by putting Dean's lower lip between his teeth and tugging slightly.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel, pulling him closer. One hand on his lower back and the other on his neck. Their lips and tongues moved with one another passionately. They were speaking so many unspoken words at that moment.
The silence returned. Both of them emerged in their works. Dean sighed every now and again. Probably finding more grammatical errors that he complained about before. Cas could barely concentrate on his home work for the statistics class he was taking. It wasn’t hard in the least. Dean was what made things hard. He winced at his internal innuendo, stupid Gabe.
“It’ll be fine. I’ll be the greatest scientist in the world and we’ll have tons of money. Oh and we should have horses too.”
Dean was probably working, which meant he wouldn’t answer Castiel’s question quickly. He didn’t like playing the waiting game, but it was a game he lived and breathed by so he was accustomed to it. In silence he ate his sandwich and enjoyed the time away from the front of the store. He enjoyed his job plenty, but social interactions were exhausting for him.
Clearly all Cas needed was the go ahead and he was off. Gentle in the way his hands held Dean’s head in place was a heavy contrast to how rapidly his hips went forwards and back. Dean’s mind began to spiral as he couldn’t get enough air each time his throat was free. His brain felt fuzzy and he loved it. Cas was truly owning his throat right now, moving more with speed than with roughness. With one long-lasting groan and a final ‘Dean’ he finished right down his throat, the tip of the man’s nose being tickled by short pubic hair.
“So you’re not here to support me. You’re here to support your pockets?” he began packing the clothes into the garment bags with annoyance. “Then you can just leave and I’ll wear something Balthazar suggests.”
Finally, the bus he was fated to be on pulled up to the curb he stood on. The doors swept open revealing a friendly face on the driver. He smiled back politely, but he didn’t feel the emotion that his expression conveyed. He was tired. Exhausted of running, drained from the strain of the way he had to live his life. What shattered him the most was the ever present loneliness that weighed on him. He hoped that wherever he was going the weather would be much nicer than this. His feet carried him past the few seats that people were seated in until he was in the very back. Being careful not to make eye contact with any of the individuals he moved in a trance like way until he got to his seat. Eye contact always opened the door for communication, something he was trying to avoid at all costs. Due to his nature people always flocked to him, with their problems, with their secrets. Castiel was a person that any and every other person felt they could trust. While in transit he evaded conversation at all costs. Putting his bag in the overhead and shrugging off his coat, hanging it on a hook in hopes that it would dry. He sat down and closed his eyes as the bus pulled away from the curb to carry him where it may.
They walked inside the old fashioned place and Dean took Cas’ hand leading them over to a perky hostess. She sat them down and gave them their menus and brought out water and breadsticks while they thought of what entrees they wanted.
Everyone can tell by the way he’s swaying that he’s had more than plenty. This was gonna go real south real quick and Castiel wanted to get Dean out of there as quick as possible.
Dean suggested they watched some movie to get Cas in a better mood. He was surprised and a little mad that Cas hadn’t seen anything from the MCU. How could you not? It was literally an infestation within the movie world at the moment. He flipped through his on demand and decided to kick it off at the beginning with Iron Man. Cas had a lot of questions, but Dean didn’t mind since he had seen all these movies dozens of times. They were both having an amazing time and stayed as close and physically connected as they could be throughout each movie. Midnight was crawling up on them and neither cared since the weekend had officially arrived.
“Very true Cas.” He paused. “Wait that’s rude. I’ve been calling you Cas this whole time and never asked if that was ok.”
Oh no here came the awkward part of every interview. Most places paid their employees via direct deposit. He always received a judging side eye and grumble for his lack of an account at his age. He liked to stick to cash, the lesser his paper trail was the safer he was, and the longer it took for them to find him.
Now he wondered, if it was about John, would Dean be upset about the two of them discussing it without him. He really didn’t want the dreary mood to return to the man, but he also didn’t want to lie to him. Lies being told never did any sort of a relationship good, and for now things were amazing between them.
“Around 7 is ok.” She grabbed her bag and approached where he still stood just inside the door. “Just come hungry, I’ve got a big meal planned.”
“I'm gonna check the pie.” Dean said happily as he took up their empty bowls and brought them with him.
They got in the sedan and began their ride over to Missouri’s shop. Sam didn’t say anything the whole way, so Castiel stayed silent as well. As they pulled up to the shop’s front Sam decides to say something.
Back and forth he went, carrying two candles at a time and delighted in how the room changed with each one added. The first couple of times Dean was just standing beside the bed, seeming to be at war with himself on whether he should follow the directions given to him or not. It dampened Castiel’s mood quite a bit. Maybe he was too straight forward? Maybe Dean wasn’t comfortable not knowing what was going to happen? However, on his 4
After 3 failed attempts he managed to finish editing the video and sending it off to his brother. Gabriel was through the roof when he watched it. He wanted to hire Castiel on full-time but he vehemently declined. It wasn’t that he didn’t enjoy himself, Dean had seen and experienced how much Castiel did like the job very much. It was more so his brother that he didn’t want to deal with. Gabriel was a whirlwind nightmare on a good day, and doing more than he already had was raising his blood pressure just thinking about it.
He really did feel comfortable snuggled up to him like this. It didn’t always lead to other things and for that he was grateful. Dean was perfectly content just laying here like this, and whenever Castiel became doubtful of that he reminded him. Insecurity plagued him often nowadays, and Dean was never discouraging, more than happy to let Castiel know how he felt about him. Dean wasn’t emotional in the slightest, he called them ‘chick-flick moments’, but he would do his best to keep the dark clouds away from Castiel’s mind.
With gentle hands even though he could tell the man wanted to be rougher, Dean pushed him up and around until their positions were flipped.
They’d taken off the duvet cover since who knows when it had last been washed. The sheets provided didn’t look much better, but Gabriel had brought some along. Weird, but practical.
Friends, Castiel didn’t have any of those, well besides Dean. He wouldn’t mind inviting Dean over and making him dinner. Lounging around on some type of couch, they could invite Sam as well, and watch all of those movies Dean believes is imperative that he sees. While wishful images passed through his mind’s eye, he had to think on a more logical level about all of this.
Castiel could no longer hold it and his whole body shook with an orgasm so violent his back lifted off the bed. He spilled over his hand while biting his bottom lip to the point he was sure he’d leave a mark. He heard Dean reaching his climax as well, his moans sent aftershocks thrumming through Castiel’s body. He straight up whined at the noises Dean made. It took a while before either one of them spoke. Nothing but sharp breaths from both of them as they willed their bodies to return to normal.
“Wouldn’t you wanna be behind the camera with him again? Come on Cassie. You could also make some money.”
Before he knew it they were sitting in front of his house. Castiel’s mood dropped at arriving so soon. He unbuckled his seat belt and gathered his things moving to leave the car.
He said dinner. Now it really sounded like a date to Dean. Cas retreated the car and rushed into the house like he had the last time. Dean drove off once he knew the guy was safely inside. Once he was home he undressed wearing just a t-shirt and boxers he crawled into bed with thoughts of Castiel on his mind. He looked at his phone to save the number and saw that Cas had texted himself a winky face.
Castiel entered the bunker’s library where both Dean and Sam were sitting on their respective laptops. Sam looked up and smiled warmly although his eyes slightly widened at the look of him. “Cas, how are you doing man?”
“That’s right big boy pay attention to me. We’ve got to go or else they’re going to kill you.” She pleaded, and the wolf growled grudgingly yet followed her out of the bar and into the dark of night.
“In fact, your, uh, guilt ridden, weight of the world bro has been M.I.A for quite some time now. But I’m loving the new model. Lean, mean Dean.” Dean said confidently.
Dean snickered, “You’d like that wouldn’t you? You’d like it if I fucked you into this floor right now wouldn’t you? Come on angel, let’s see how much you like it while I’m rapping you. Because I promise you I won’t be gentle about it.”
“She ripped out his safety blanket, she made him face what he did before he was ready, Sam. I wasn’t going to just sit by and let her ruin him.” Dean defended, meeting that gaze head-on pouring out his emotions, the anger, the protectiveness, the need to save him.
Dean grinned happily. “See was that so hard my pretty little lamb.” the demon moved inside Castiel with an unrelenting pace quickly hitting his prostate every time causing pretty little moans and curses to come tumbling out of Castiel's mouth.
“You would have liked to have gotten there before the deal went down, but you didn’t really care about poor ol’Lester, did you? Oh, and so you know, I killed Lester myself. And that wife of his married the tattoo guy.”
Dean shut the water off grabbing two towels. Dean wiped himself down quickly tying the towel around his waist then grabbing the second one patting down Castiel’s body wrapping it tightly around him as Dean set him down on the toilet seat. He then grabbed another towel to dry Castiel’s hair. The whole time Castiel’s eyes never stopped watching him. Following all of his movements with his eyes the broken gaze slowly changed to something that looked extremely close to affection.
He rounded on Castiel taking in his pale skin and the silent sobs coming from him. Dean could feel the pain in the bond, but it didn’t affect his corrupted soul like it did to Castiel’s pure one. Dean picked Castiel up gently caressing him in his arms taking the steps slowly.
Sam shrugged his eyes flashing black as they often do when he doesn’t want Dean to read him, “I’ve been around.”
“Don’t go.” She whispered her eyes pleading, scared. Castiel cupped her face for the first time fear flickered into his mind. He wouldn’t be here if she passed, wouldn’t know if she lived, and that scared him. He shook himself trying to cling to his resolve, to that numb part of him that allowed him to be okay, to be at peace with his decision.
“What do you want?” Dean screamed back at the crying baby his eyes flashing black in anger. The baby took one look at him and started crying even harder. Dean huffed changing his eyes back. Dean shook his head at the crying baby his features so similar to his own. If Dean had any doubts the kid was his it was squashed when his eyes had first landed on the sleeping form. Dean couldn’t believe it as he’d picked up the child and it had awoken instantly it’s green eyes going wide in alarm and crying. There was hardly anything in the child’s features that reminded him of Castiel.
“They should hand me over for everything I’ve done.” He replied and Meg growled her eyes flashing yellow shoving Castiel hard the alpha stumbling back in surprise.
Dean stood suddenly, snapping his fingers, new clothes suddenly appearing on his body, and he walked away. Leaving the body of his old, dear friend Cas, lying there for his brother to come across. Maybe Sam would burn him, possibly bury him, either way it was none of Dean’s business. He’d done what he came to do. He came to rid the world of the one person who would truly go to the ends of the earth to find a way to fix him. Now he had free reign to submerge himself in women, death, and destruction until he forgot about the little angel he once called family.
At the sound of his father’s name Gabriel stopped crying loudly just small sniffles coming from him. Dean sighed patting the one year old on the back carefully. Dean didn’t really understand why he was doing this or why it meant so much to him. Before Sam had injected him with human blood he really hadn’t felt anything at all. There would be hints of emotion here and there but nothing that resembled what he used to feel. Dean loved being care free, not a worry in the world because he didn’t have enough emotions in his body to care. Now, things were a bit different.
He immediately regretted asking when Castiel let out a small sobbing noise. “Everything about him is like, Dean.”
Dean turned the shower nob on checking the water every few seconds. Dean was glad when he decided to have the place built that he made the shower big enough to fit ten people easy with shower heads shooting water down in almost every direction. Dean sat Castiel’s naked body down on the small corner bench he had built in there and stripped his clothes off watching Castiel closely for any movement indicating he was going to fall. Once Dean was rid of his clothes he closed the door to the shower pulling Castiel up again and helping him sit down in the middle point of the spray from the water that was coming from every direction.
Mary gave them a tour of their home and of the grounds after he and Meg left their room. Mary introduced them properly to her son Sam, and her other son Adam both equally friendly and reserved as if waiting to see if they would be staying before they got attached. Both John and Dean were nowhere to be found the entire day. When the sun began to crest the mountains Castiel’s skin prickled uncomfortably. He would change soon, and he wanted to be far from the rest of the clan before he did.
The sounds of chanting reached his ears and something cold started to wash over him. Dean ran down the step breaking through a wooden door only to be stopped in his tracks. Dean let out a roar of anger when he saw the devils trap on the ceiling. A black man looked up at Dean never stopping his chanting. Castiel was withering down on the table a sheen of sweat covering his body and he was thrashing violently.
That night was hazy at best a mess of memories all over the place he didn’t bother to put together and he didn’t feel like it now. “What does it matter, Meg?” He spat his tone dropping low his fingernails growing in his anger as his heart hammered in his chest.
Dean cocked his head to the side chastising. “Don’t be so full of yourself, Sammy. ‘Cause see from where I’m sitting, there ain’t much difference from what I turned into and what you already are.”
Dean screamed and groaned easing into a chuckle before asking. “Let me ask you this, Sammy. If this doesn’t work… we both know what you got to do to me, right? You got the stomach for that, Sam?” Dean screamed.
When the truck stopped Castiel climbed from the car gently pulling his sister into his arms holding her tightly to his chest. This was the last time he’d smell her lilac smell, the last time he’d see her beautiful hazel eyes, and touch her wonderful red hair. He stared at her long and hard as if to burn her into his memory before walking towards the looming home. It was bigger than their mansion mostly made out of black stone, and white wood. It was intimidating to look at, but Castiel felt no fear. He was no longer afraid of the wolf screaming in his ear, he didn’t fear the screams of his soon death. He embraced it with full clarity that this would be worth it in the end, for everyone.
Castiel was surprised to find that Dean ignored his own straining erection in favor of letting Castiel come down from his orgasm. Kissing and sucking along his back as his hands wandered over Castiel’s body, adding enough pressure to almost have a massaging effect.
Dean gripped the blade tightly as he looked around searching for the angel. “Come on Cas! Come on out! Let’s talk about things, you know, hash it out.”
He slipped his hand down the front of Castiel’s pants finding no underwear to stop him from cupping Castiel dick in his hands palming him gently. “Feels good doesn’t it, Cas? Makes you want more right?” Castiel nodded his whole body shivering with desire.
Castiel stilled at Dean’s old nickname for him. Castiel couldn’t help the tears that rose to his eyes of all the times Dean had whispered the word into his ear like a pray when they’d made love. Castiel stood abruptly from the chair not even caring that tears were falling from his eyes as he said, “Fuck you, Dean Winchester.”
This chapter deals with themes of suicide, and violence. Please, please do not read this if things like that bother you. No one commits the act, however, it is thought about so if this triggers you, please skip this chapter. I am putting a summary of this chapter at the endnotes of this chapter if you'd like to continue the story, but not read this chapter.
Castiel walked into the woods through the night, his backpack on his shoulder containing his few belongings. Like he was leaving, and his heart hammered with every step away from Dean. Fear crawled across his skin painfully splitting every nerve and putting him on edge. He repeated the plan over and over in his mind.
“You really don’t remember?” She said in mockery anger seething in her voice as her eye locked onto him with venom. “Chuck put you down on the ground and left you. You chose to become rogue, Cas, you split your connection so the stronger side of you could try and kill your father, and guess what? You failed.” She snarled and it was if something snapped within him, a damn breaking free as the memories strung themselves together.
“Do you think I’m giving him too much attention, Michael? Perhaps you want all of my attention on you, hmm? Well, I wasn’t going to say anything, because, well, quite frankly your pose is completely wrong. Here, I’ll help you fix it.”
He grasped Castiel’s shoulder. “I’ll see you at home, little brother. Hey, Gigantor, wait up, I’ll walk you out!”
Dean's breathing picked up. "I know, baby, so am I. Fuck, Cas, you're, so tight. I could stay in you forever."
Dean cocked his head. “You don’t even know if this is going to work, do you? You know I’ve got a hell of a lot more running through me than just demon juice.”
“I know,” Dean whispered and turned away his body cracking and changing as he fell onto all fours a gorgeous blond wolf taking off into the woods and all Castiel could do was sit there and watch silently. He didn’t know what to do. It was becoming nightfall by the time he moved a restlessness settling into his skin. Tomorrow was the full moon and he could already feel the itch of it as he hiked his way back to the Winchester’s home.
He took them to their room and straight into the bath room, “You reek of holy oil Cas. I’m going to clean you up Cas I’m going to take care of you. Anything you need Cas I’ll give it to you.”
Dean chuckled to himself and left a very fucked out Priest lying in wait for his return. He could feel that part of his corrupted soul inside of Castiel and he could feel the way Castiel already mourned the demons touch. Dean grinned again when he walked out of the cathedral and into the morning light passing by the Priest that would surely find Castiel there sullied and tainted. There would be nothing they could do to save him because Castiel was his, and nothing not even a couple of hunter Priests could change that.
“It’s not just that. He’s seen the night you scratched Meg’s face. He’s seen your encounters with Lilith, he watched as you were lost to your own mind in the angel war and saw you with Chuck last night as you decided to turn yourself in with the end goal to kill yourself. How would he know any of this?” She spoke in quick succession and Castiel’s hand just kept tightening. “She’s lying Castiel. Kill her. Kill her! She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.”
Castiel wakes up in the medical room within the Winchester Mansion. Quickly upon waking he realizes that he can no longer hear or see his wolf and that Lilith is still connected to his consciousness. This causes Castiel a lot of anxiety, and he sets out to find her. Upon finding her he comes across Bela who seems distant and overall just off. She's watching over Lilith and explains Dean is not allowed near her for the fear that he might try and get inside of her mind and might break her mind before they can get any real information from her. Castiel finds his wolf, looking sickly standing next to Lilith and notices she's holding a black rock that draws him in. Castiel begins to feel overwhelmed so he goes to the forest to decompress and calls Meg to tell her that he is scared that Lilith is still messing with him. She hops on the next flight to come to him. Hours pass and Dean goes and finds Castiel. The spell that Lilith cast at the end of the last chapter kicks in, and he ends up attacking Dean to try and kill him. Meg shows up to stop Castiel, knocking him off of Dean in her wolf form. Castiel tries to change into his own wolf form and is unsuccessful. This brings on a panic attack in which Castiel spirals and thinks about ending his life to get away from Lilith. Dean puts him to sleep then the chapter switches to Dean's point of view. Meg yells at Dean for letting Castiel near Lilith, and the two of them return to the village where they meet up with Dean's family, Castiel's, and Bela. Adam is having visions of the future, and he and Dean try and decide on the best one. They choose one and they go to find Bobby who got in contact with his druid friend, Jody, who is coming to help them with Castiel. Dean is suspicious of Bela and finds her mind to look through it. He finds her in front of Lilith's cage talking to her about how she failed to kill Dean, and is going to lose Castiel. Lilith tries to ask for a second chance, and Bela denies her. She has a thought that it is her turn to try and kill him. Dean tells John about what he saw, and his father goes to find his mother to take care of Bela. Dean takes Castiel to Bobby, and Jody is already there. She explains that Lilith didn't have enough power to do this spell and would have had to have help from Rowena. She theories that Rowena's real goal was to have Castiel pass away which would cause Dean to be weaker. Without the other half of his soul he would pass away. Because they trapped half of Castiel's soul in an object instead of attaching it to another soul, which would have been an option, that was probably not told to Lilith there is an extremely high chance of Castiel's other half of his soul to die and so would he. Castiel wakes up and tells them that he believes his wolf's soul is in the rock she was holding and that is the object his soul is in, and Jody asks Dean to go with her to get the stone. The story switches back to Castiel's perspective and he has a touching moment with Meg where we find out she's been mated for about two days, but she'll always be there for Castiel. Bobby interrupts to explain to Castiel that they will put him in a dream state and guide his wolf into the same dream state where they will have to reconcile otherwise his wolf's soul will die without it being attached to anything, and Castiel will not live long without the other half of his soul. Eventually, Dean and Jody come back in and Dean is covered in blood. Castiel wants to ask about it, but he's shot down by Dean to talk about it later. Castiel asks everyone to leave, and he apologizes to Dean for trying to kill him. Dean says they will talk about this later as well, and just tells Castiel to come back to him whole when he wakes up. Castiel takes a potion that Bobby gave and falls asleep the last thing he hears is Dean saying, "Please come back to me."
Dean snorted behind them as he walked up to the door. “Gabe, I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.”
Sam rolled his eyes and moved up to the front of the class to demonstrate the next pose. Dean winked at Castiel and went towards the back of the room. “Stay after class, Cas, there’s something I want to talk to you about.” He said to Castiel as he passed him.
Castiel’s eyes opened wide in alarm, and he started struggling trying to get away. Dean tisked, gripping Castiel’s hair in hand, he slammed his head down twice, grinning at the way the angel went limp under him.
“Because,” She shouted anger reflecting in her now yellow eyes, “you lied to me and I need to know why! Why would you lie to me?” She hissed getting back into his face and he saw his wolf step behind her his claws raised.
Castiel snorted coming up to her and giving her a hug. “We both know that’s a lie.” Hannah had become very attached to Gabriel from the two weeks that she had spent helping take care of him. Her way of trying to get rid of the attachment was by not seeing him.
“So do I Cas, and you’re not going to believe this.” Sam said excitedly the sound of his movements coming through the phone.
Dean’s hand wandered all over his body finding Castiel’s nipples were extremely sensitive, and when he sucked on them Castiel would scream out those dirty vulgar words he’d never said before. Castiel canted his hips up trying to find friction against Dean’s stomach, but Dean would only pull away out of reach making Castiel cry out in desperation.
“I’m going to make love to you this time Castiel and I’m going to put everything I have towards you, and I expect you to do the same. I need you to put everything into this night, and I mean everything. Prove to me you really want this bond as much as you say you do.”
Dean’s expression darkened further. “No, she just manipulates their thoughts and emotions when it suits her needs. I can read your thoughts, but I don’t manipulate you or anyone else. I’ve tried to stay out of your head and your dreams. Believe me, I’ve fucking tried. I don’t think you know how hard to is to be linked to you and stay away from you when I knew you’d never accept me.” The omega murmured angrily clenching his fist. “Now move your damn hand so I can heal your damn nose. You’re getting blood everywhere.”
“John Winchester’s wife, Mary. She’s a documented rogue, was branded, the whole works. She met John who she claims is her true mate and over time she was able to come back into her own no longer was she separated from her wolf they were the same person again. If we could find his true mate, who knows what could happen.” Meg’s heart sunk again. The rarity of finding a true mate was slim to none, and that’s not what she wanted. She wanted him as she’s always wanted him, to herself. “You can meet her when we take Anna to them.”
“No, I’m not. Dean’s been having dreams of you all his life. I swear to you. He saw you turn rogue; you chose to turn rogue to try and defeat your father and then he beat you within an inch of your life.
” Red eyes flashed to Castiel pinning him in place anger in them as images of all the people he killed began to flash in his mind and Castiel wasn’t ashamed of the whimper that tumbled from his mouth. He caused this, he chose this, he chose this life of chaos.
Crowley hummed in thought. “Very well, Dean. I’m at the warehouse collecting the ingredients I need to take the Nephilim’s soul. If he’s such an abomination you can help me take it from his body.” Castiel silently collapsed to the floor his hands beginning to shake in despair. He needed to get it together. Dean couldn’t see him like this. He already thought he was weak. How would he mock him now seeing him come apart so easily?
“I can’t go to an airport. I’ll be there in five days Gabriel.” Castiel hung up the phone looking at Meg with hardened eyes.
Castiel nodded once his gaze flickering over to his wolf the figment of his imagination slitting his own throat with a knife blood pouring from the wound. “I’m going to kill us, Castiel. We’re not going to a hospital. We’re gonna die.” Castiel didn’t respond because he knew that was the point. He was going to die either by his own hand or the wolfs. That was his goal. He was tired of the fight, no longer wanted to be talked down from a ledge, no longer wanted to hurt innocent people who didn’t deserve his wrath. He wanted Meg to have a life without always being on the run or wondering if her one pack mate was going to make it day to day. He knew she’d be hurting by his death, knew that all the people who still cared would mourn, but he knew deep down that they’d be better off without waiting on his next episode, better off without worrying if he’d make it another day. He needed this to be over.
Castiel screamed his entire body shaking his breaths coming in great heaves. “Castiel I’m almost done hold on.” Hannah said calmly as she cut him open more to get to the baby.
Sam shook his head his shoulders dropping his mind plagued with all the other bullshit going on beside his brother. Sam was just tired. He was worried about Cas, worried about killing his brother, and worried he couldn’t actually cure him. “You want me to debate you? This isn’t even the real you I’m talking to.”
“Leave me alone,” Castiel growled his inner hackles raised as the man’s putrid and rotted scent rose to his nose. His wolf hissed in his ear low and mean. “
“You… You deserve that.” Castiel said and somehow, he could tell it was the wrong and right thing to say as he watched her shoulders harden in determination once more.
She nodded once more and went back to reading while Castiel look out the window and into the woods he now called his home.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Sam spoke the accusation slurred into those words. Sam didn’t miss anything, the emotions he felt sometimes spoke louder than the thoughts Dean could hear. He’d felt Dean’s pain at seeing a mate that recoiled from him, but he could feel Castiel’s confusion, and Meg’s grief as if it was his own. He had to filter through so many emotions that sometimes he couldn’t help but defend the feelings he felt.
Castiel hardly remembered what it was like with thoughts of his own, and the thought of it being only him in his mind was both terrifying and liberating. “Yes.” He whispered and Mary nodded slightly standing to meet him head on her gaze penetrating as she looked at him.
“So you named him, Gabriel huh?” Sam said trying to get his friend to talk about something else other than what a royal fuck up Sam was.
"Oh yeah, cause Chamuel definitely sees my comfort level as her top priority! No, Cas... let's not waste our breath with her. Now watch and learn because I'm going to show you what a real montage looks like." Dean plastered on a fake cocky grin.
As soon as Dean had finished ranting on how much he hated this entire experience, they both heard a brief clicking sound.
"You didn't know what else to do? Try hiring a shrink or sending me to the looney bin. Do ANYTHING, but DON'T send me off to some psychotic angel who thinks she is some sort of relationship guru or mental health professional." Dean exclaimed.
Dean, on the other hand, knew he had to lose. He hoped that Castiel's competitive side would be enough to cause him to play his best. But one thing he knew he had in common with the angel was the fact that they would both jump the gun if it meant saving those they cared about. They may be mad at each other currently, but they would both sacrifice themselves in a heartbeat to save the other. So since Naya told him, or rather she bluntly hinted to him that whatever was in the smoothie would hurt Castiel, Dean knew he couldn't willingly let that happen despite the underlying feud.
"I decided to stay here." Castiel admitted looking straight at her. He wanted to know if she expected the response or not.
"I didn't combine our two universes, Jane and I specifically combined only our two bunkers. Everything else outside these walls is exactly the same… well, it's the same for us, maybe not for the girls. Since this is our universe, not theirs.  But everything should be oddly similar to what their world was like. From what Jane and I have discussed in our letters, our universes are extremely similar." He explained.
Dean stormed out of room 5 and back into the center room once again. Castiel was already on the opposite side of the space, and he was turned away from Dean facing the opposing wall. This small detail, of course, only ended up frustrating Dean even more because he had absolutely no clue what the hell was going on in the angel's mind. Dean had practically just poured his heart out to the guy only to receive the silent treatment in return. This only seemed to confirm Dean's theory about why he should never open his mouth and talk about his feelings and all that bullshit.  It never bodes well for him, and this situation right here only sought to prove that all the more.
Castiel looked Dean up and down like he was trying to size the hunter up, trying to anticipate his reaction or something. That's when his eyes landed on the blade still gripped tightly in Dean's hand.
Castiel just grinned into the kiss in response. He didn't bother backing away because that would just be one second more without Dean's lips on his own. Cas started grinding himself on Dean even faster.
"There's nothing wrong with that, Dean..." Castiels expression became much more sympathetic and understanding. He looked like a concerned family member or something with the way he focused on Dean.
"... I don't know, man...hell...all this-" Dean gestured back and forth between them "- this is fucking new territory for me. This cave has practically revealed stuff about myself that I never let see the light of day, and it's fucking overwhelming. Sure, I knew I found guys attractive, but I never damned admitted it out loud before... And me and you, we've always had this strong 'bond' and..." He sighed. "- ever since we met, every other person couldn't compare to how I felt about you."
"It was in your best interest that I didn't." She replied confidently, but Castiel assumed she just didn't want to admit her own incompetence.
"It was a cave-in. And now... well now there are hundreds if not thousands of rocks blocking our exit." Cas replied while getting up off of Dean's chest and grabbed his friend's arm to help him to his feet.
Dean reached a hand up to play with Castiel's hair while the angel set to getting off his shoes. "Oh, you know... the prolonged stares, the raising me out of hell thing, hiding from me in purgatory to keep me safe, the list goes on and on and -"
"Well, technically, my vessel is male, but I'm neither male nor female. But regardless, what is a soul twin?"
Neither option sounded appealing to Castiel, to say the least. So he resolved to leave it as it is for the time being.
Dean rolled his eyes since it was the only body part he could move without the threat of getting stabbed. "She didn't put us up to anything," Dean responded. "Now, if you don't mind lowering the knife so we could talk this out. My neck is really starting to cramp up."
"Yes, actually it was... I have never admitted that to anyone... and I still don't understand what a soulmate even means." Cas looked down and started fidgeting with his hand in his lap.
"Yes! Do you think that that was the same dimension you were in before? With Sam and Virgil?" Castiel asked.
But sadly, all good things come to an end, and this one ended only a few minutes later when there was a sudden rapid, loud knocking on the door. Dean jumped out of bed, hoping that he could stop the knocking before it woke Cas up. But it was a bit too late and loud for that. Cas sat up, only to yawn and stretch as Dean made his way to open the door.
"I would apologize for the scare, but I just adore a dramatic entrance. I have always had a flair for the dramatics." He smirked, looking up at Dean and Cas as he tilted his hat back into place.
"You told me your flight wasn't going to arrive here until early tomorrow morning." Castiel said, sounding a bit annoyed by Dean's sudden appearance.
"It means what trait makes you want to get it on with someone!" Dean replied, smirking to himself when his mind brought up past encounters where he himself got it on.
"Cas..." Dean says with his eyes closed and his fingers clasped on the bridge of his nose. "I have just one - one small question...Why in the hell is this one of your favorite memories? Because if you don't remember, an hour later, Lucifer was popped free from the cage because Sam killed Lilith! So please enlighten me on what I am missing from this that makes it one of your top 5?" He asked, dropping his hand to his side in exasperation and stared at Cas with complete confusion.
"What the hell took you so damn long?" Dean asked. His tone was full of rage, but his eyes hinted at a deeper level of concern than his actions were showing.
"Out unloading the car, they should be in in a second. Everything went fine. It was a simple salt and burn case, so in reality, we all didn't need to be there." Sam explained.
Dean couldn't help but chuckle at the note. Sam was a nosy bitch when it came to Dean's personal life, but thankfully he knew when he needed to make himself scarce.
"We done yet? Or do we need to start thinking of more synonyms to continue this argument?" Dean asked, lifting an eyebrow and smirking a bit at how stupid this fight sounded.
Wait... no, no, no, this couldn't be happening. This wasn't real. Jensen wasn't Dean. Jensen wasn't his Dean. This Jensen was getting married tomorrow. It wasn't right. But the kiss had felt so good, but now when Jensen started to kiss him again, Castiel couldn't get the thought out of his head that this wasn't his Dean if he couldn't have the real thing, why tempt himself with something that wasn't his. He wanted all or nothing, which meant that he couldn't go through with this.
"Really? Because the Sam you know got addicted to demons blood, so I wouldn't say meth is a far stretch."
He looked over to Jensen. Maybe he didn't really understand bachelor parties after all. I mean, it wasn't like Cas had been to one before, so the details were a bit iffy.
"I don't know why Chamuel decided to send me there," Castiel stated, ignoring Dean's complaint and refocusing the subject. "There didn't seem to be any substantial lesson for me to learn and the entire experience just fucking sucked."
He folded up Sam's note and placed it into the side pocket of his blazer. The last thing he needed was for Cas to see the note and second guess Dean's actual intentions, which, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with Sam's childish bet.
"So what? Did you return to guilt trip Castiel into hooking up with another angel or some shit? Not a chance, pal! You will have to go through me first!"
"Sorry about the delay. I didn't mean to leave you guys in the dark for so long, quite literally speaking!" O'Malley said with an air of light laughter throughout his wording. "But I needed to see you both in action before I finalized the measurements for everything." He said with a head tilt referencing the two beakers in front of him. One was the green one that Dean had noticed early, and the other beside it was a deep blue color.
"Yep! You muchachos are done for the night. Try to get some sleep if you aren't too busy with ahem other things."
"See Dean, I told you that this was just a warm-up activity." Castiel said while Dean scoffed at both angels' statements.
However, that short response made Dean extremely anxious. Had Castiel and him experienced the same thing as he did? Is that why Cas was so upset right now? Did he not approve of the concept of them finally being together without monsters or demons? Would that really be something that would upset him so much?
"Those words are far too big  for me to put together right now, but I know what I want, and there are zero words required for doing that." Dean shifted his eyebrows suggestively.
"We don't have superpowers Dean, the only powers we have come from the spells placed on us, and those are only temporary. But I agree that the card is asking us to use the projection ability that we were given."
"What? I am the first to admit that I'm a nosey bitch, so spill the tea, Wings. I'll find out one way or another, so why not just save us both the hassle and tell me now?"
"IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE! I CAN'T LIE HERE, CAS NEITHER OF US FUCKING CAN. AND I WASN'T JUST LOOKING FOR A HOOKUP." Dean responded before looking down and the ground of the cave. He took another deep breath to calm himself down. "I wasn't just looking for a hookup." Dean repeated softly like it was a secret.
"She was bonded to you by a mark. However, I already had marked you long before she was even out of that damn cage ."
Dean opened his eyes to see that Castiel had latched his left arm underneath Dean's chest, his hand grasping Dean's side. What the hell was he doing? Dean was 100% sure that this wasn't allowed in the game, but since neither fell, yet he assumed that neither had technically lost yet.
Castiel cupped Dean's chin and kissed him passionately. In all honesty, this moment was perfect, and nothing could ruin it for them.
Dean started to move his right hand towards the green circle, and while doing so, he shifted his weight, acting as if the change in position had caused him to topple over. To Cas, it would just look like Dean lost his balance unintentionally.
Castiel and Dean's lips moved in sync with one another. The heat of one another face and chests pressed up against one another. The tension barely melting between each of them because nothing was truly resolved between them. It couldn't be. This was all they could get at this level. Anything else would bring Castiel true happiness and thus bring the empty to take Castiel away from Dean. This was the best that either of them could get currently from one another.
The first few times he saw sarcasm being used was when Sam or Dean wanted to express emotions such as annoyance, anger, and frustration. The brothers would constantly use sarcasm in this fashion. They wouldn't just use it when conversing with one another. No, they basically would use this aspect of sarcasm towards practically anyone that pissed them off.
Eventually, many stumbles later, Castiel arrived next to the bed in the area that Dean slept the previous night. Dean automatically assumed that the angel would take his spot on the floor since the bed was obviously occupied; however, when he felt the bed dip down, he knew he had assumed wrong.
The room behind door number one looked exactly like the rest of the cave did so far... it was pitch black. The darkness seemed to a reoccurring theme throughout this quest, and Dean was getting sick of it. It reminded him of when he and Sammy were kids, and he had to act the part of the parent who checked Sammy's closet for monsters. Even as a kid, Dean knew all about the evil that existed in the world, though he tried to keep Sam oblivious to it for as long as possible. Kids deserve to be kids, and Dean never had that luxury. He hated the dark back then, which made him all the more warry of it now. You never knew what was really lurking in there.
"What's the task?" Castiel asked, tilting his head to the right a bit as if to prove he was curious.
"Maybe the cards are enchanted, and the question only appears after you completely answer the previous card." Castiel said.
"Ughhh, Gabriel, I should have known." Dean rolled his eyes before looking over to see Castiel's chin was now resting on his shoulder, which made him instantly smile.
"No, no... I'm alright." Castiel lied. He was not at all alright. Dean... or uh, Jensen in this case, was getting married. It may not have been his Dean, but it still stung. He could feel his heart beating rapidly in his chest.
"There were stories of the existence of another archangel. An archangel named Chamuel, who God kept hidden away for safekeeping. This specific archangel was supposed to control righting wrongs, put weary minds at ease, and solve matters involving social justice. She was said to be created so that humans could call upon her for matters involving forgiveness, love, understanding, and tolerance."
Cas couldn't help the compulsory moan that slipped his mouth and landed directly onto Dean's lip. The sound temporarily interrupted the rhythm, but Dean couldn't care less about that. All that mattered now was getting his angel to make more of those addicting moans. He smirked into the stuttered kiss, Castiel's eyes closed and mouth parted from the sensation of Dean's intimate touch.
"It was my answer to your question Cas, and no, I will not repeat it... You know why? Because I am uncomfortable with being forced to say the truth all the time, especially when I don't want to say it. So, if you could keep those pretty little lips of yours zipped shut, that would make this entire process a lot easier on me. Thank you and goodnight."
"... This is where I would be taken if I leave this cave now, Dean!" Castiel responded, looking extremely regretful as Dean's eyes widened in shock.
Dean gave a loud sigh and turned back to the table. "So, O'Malley, what do we have to do exactly to pass this level or leave this room?"
Suddenly the room around them began to change, and before Dean knew it, he and Cas were sitting on a dock.
"Ooooo," Dean said, sounding surprisingly enthusiastic for once, "I think this is where we get to use our superpowers."
However, when they entered the room, they noticed that they weren't alone. Chamuel was sitting on the edge of the bed, just waiting for them to arrive.
"I don't... I don't understand... Why was that last memory one of your worst? I mean, I get why the other two would be there... I treated you terribly, and I regret the choices I made back then daily... but why the last one?"
Nonetheless, that book would have probably come in handy right about now. It probably had a whole section about wing speak or whatever the hell it's called.
Dean scoffed. "Well, my brother and I went against YOUR father, and so did Cas and Rowena and Jack... But we are still kicking it. So stop giving excuses for your actions and tell us what we need to do to get out of this room. I can't stand the sight of your fugly face for any longer than I have to."
"Alright, Rachel, what's the task here? Do we have to do data analysis or take phone calls? Is this how you angels take prayers? Some weird angel call center?" Dean asked sarcastically, he knew exactly how prayers worked, but the thought of an angel phone center was too funny to pass up on mentioning in his current situation.
"Well, I haven't seen a need to use it yet. None of the questions really required any visual aid." Castiel answered.
After reading the texts, Dean was in total shock. What the hell was going on here? Why did his contact on Cas's phone have a winky face next to it? Why did he call Cas 'babe"? But most importantly, why did the text say "love you"? Dean believed that those words were reserved for when you are dying, and you realize you have no other chance to admit your feelings. He would never say stuff like that over texts, plus he and Cas had never really said those word's to one another directly before. Dean didn't even have his phone ever since he entered the cave, so these texts were definitely not from him. He checked the time stamp, and the texts were definitely sent earlier today.
"Doesn't matter, Sam got the loan in both of our names well technically my name and your vessel's name for you know legal purposes and all that jazz." Dean said.
! Quiet in the peanut gallery, comprende?" Gabriel asked. Dean sighed in annoyance but nodded his head in response to Gabriel's request. "
Castiels gripped loosened, and Dean used that moment to slip out of his grasps, thus causing Dean to fall to the floor.
Eventually, both boys' eyes adjusted to the new flood of white light only to reveal the bland room in front of them. It was small and undecorated in comparison to the room they had just been seated in. Basically, it looked like a normal part of any dull, drab cave. The only item of interest inside was a long wooden table filled to the brim with beakers and chemicals of all shapes and sizes.
Eventually, Dean got impatient and shook Castiel a bit, tightening his grasp on his shoulders. "Cas buddy, what the hell happened to you? I was about to stage a mutiny or some shit to get you back here."
Cas could feel his heart slowly tearing apart at the thought of never seeing Dean again. But it held together enough at the thought that his actions would keep the Winchester brothers safe. Well safer, at least...
"Ughhhhh!" Dean groaned loudly, sitting up now turning to face the man directly. "Sure, Cas, you have nice lips. They are extremely chapped at times though, but they fit your face quite nicely. As far as any man can go to appreciate the appearance of another man, I find your vessel to be extremely attractive."
A few seconds later, a single click sounded, and a spotlight turned. In the center of that spotlight was a man wearing a fedora and suit.
"So then it doesn't change anything whether you knew it or not." Chamuel replied simply. "But considering you didn't talk to Dean, I am very intrigued to know what choice you came to on your own."
"Misha, you okay?" Fake Gabriel asked, putting an arm on Castiel's shoulder. "You look like you saw a ghost or something. Which is ironic considering our line of work."
"I think that you're scared. I think that you know I will win one way or another, so instead of actually admitting defeat and just playing the game, you are admitting defeat early on to save your hide... Oh, and your pride! Ha, that rhymes!" Dean knew he was harsh, but harsh was the only way to go at this point. He couldn't lose Cas, not again. Not to some magical torture smoothie or whatever the hell it was.
Both Dean and Cas looked over each other faces trying to catalog as many features as they could before being separated from one another.
"Yes... I'm sorry, I truly am. But I have to respect Castiel's original decision. In three months, if he decides to become human and leave this cave, he will be more than welcome to do so. If not, he will stay and work with Gabriel and me to assist our incoming clientele... I cannot promise you that Castiel will choose to come back to you, Dean, but if he does, I can promise I will not hold him back."
Just looking over the room though, Dean could tell there was one major problem here. There was only one of everything: one nightstand, one chair, one bathroom, and most importantly, only one bed.
"Well, it's simple really, you will be out of here, lickidy split if you just follow my instructions, no questions asked," O'Malley said.
With the bottle in hand, he started making his way out of the kitchen, but before he could get into the hallway, he noticed that Sam was standing in the doorway, blocking his path.
"So then what exactly are you getting at Samuel?" the witch asked; she was extremely curious as to where this was going because, as of the current moment, she had no idea which way this boy's mind was heading.
Castiel observed as Dean's hand delicately continued down his shirt, undoing one button at a time. "Yes... But how do you want us to go about that?" He asked.
"Don't worry; I will give you a quick tour." Dean responded once again, closing his eyes and teleporting them to the bottom of the staircase.
"See, that's your problem, Cas. You take all these issues onto yourself. You can't bear the weight of it all. Maybe you think it's your divine duty or some other evangelical bull shit; I honestly don't know. But what I do know is that you never ask for help until it's too late for you or somebody else. You let your pride or morals or whatever guide your actions which always leads us into trouble." Dean stated, trying to control his frustration.
"No!" Cas interjected. "Well - yes, you are technically correct in that soon after that, the apocalypse did start, but that that does not contribute to why I favor this memory..." Castiel reached his hand behind his head to nervously rub the back of his neck.
"Cas, I was on a role, and isn't it obvious?" Dean asked while Castiel shook his head no. "We would go to texas because it is historically well known for cowboys, and I look great in the getup." Dean explained.
"Not long." Castiel lied, but then again, time was different in the cave, so maybe it wasn't really a lie at all. Time is relative anyhow.
Finally, Dean made a move to pick up a card and get the round started. However, he couldn't quite pick up the card. He tried again and again. It was like the entire deck was glued to the table. Eventually, it became a battle of brute strength for Dean. It was him vs. the immovable deck of cards. He stood up from his seat to get a better angle on his leverage, but it refused to budge.
"There were no provocative photos Dean!" Castiel stated, looking questioningly at Dean. Sometimes Cas was so oblivious to the ways of people that it physically hurt Dean. Dean was about to explain what he meant to the angel, but Rachel spoke up before he could.
"So ... wait wait wait wait ....We have to STAY in this hellhole FOR FIVE-FUCKING-DAYS...?" Dean exclaimed while looking around the room. With any luck, he might be able to locate the speaker her voice was coming from. Breaking it would really shut her up for a while.
But eventually, he broke the trance by coughing awkwardly and turning away swiftly, breaking all eye contact. "We should... We should probably head into room three now."
Castiel followed silently behind Dean until they finally made it to his room. Dean opened the door and tugged Cas inside before closing and locking it. Then Dean went to the wall and dimmed the lights, all while toeing off his shoes.
"Cas, all I did was what the game wanted us to do..." Dean said, shifting his hand over his face. "It's not like I wanted to use you for my own pleasure or some shit intentionally. It wasn't like that man."
He had always wanted to play twister with another person, but he didn't think that his dream would ever come true until now.
Sam's heart broke for his brother. He couldn't imagine the pain Dean must be going through right now. And on top of all that, Sam knew he was responsible for all this. If he had never enrolled Dean and Cas into Chamuel's program, then maybe they could've worked their issues out alone.
Cas closed his eyes and held the bridge of his nose, messaging it between two of his fingers. His wings curled back to their original stance, but the feathers remained somewhat poofy. "JUST... just answer the question, Dean... please!" The angel asked.
The kiss was short and sweet, but it was enough to convey all the joy that Dean was feeling in the current moment.
Everyone stayed silent for a minute before Garth spoke up. "I did name my kid after you, Dean." Garth declared
How was he supposed to give a speech about Jensen when he legit just met the man less than a few hours ago.
"What the hell Cas? You had no idea what was in that. Are you insane? You could be a dead man walking now for all we know." Dean stated.
"The Enochian on the doors... they are numbers." Castiel began pointing to each door and stating the number on each "One... Two... Three... Four... Five..."
"There is a rule against human and angel relations, but I stopped listening to Heaven a long time ago. Gender has nothing to do with what attracts me to a person."
With their hands still on top of one another, they pushed down on the door handle, and a light suddenly disrupted Dean's vision.
"You sneaky son of a bitch, I thought you said this was just some weird-ass slideshow or something..."
At first, Castiel went limp on top of Dean, the sensation was heavenly, and Cas would know since he used to be an angel and all. Castiel would have been fine letting Dean take control of the situation. But the more strokes Dean got in, the more his rhythm began to stutter, and before he knew it, Dean was practically writhing underneath Castiel.
"Yeah, but I focused on the ladies figures, so that means I am a totally straight man. Doesn't it?" Dean said confidently even though he himself was unsure if that was truly the case.
"Ok..." At this point, Dean turned his gaze over to the house only to see a light flicker on inside the house. "Uhhh, I hate to burst your bubble Cas, but I think someone is already living in the house."
"The name is Omael, but you can call me O'Malley! I find that that name has a better ring to it, don't you think?" he smirked quickly, glancing up to look at the men over his beakers.
"Well, let's go meet up with everyone. I think Cassie was able to break up whatever the girls were yelling over, so it should be safe for us to head on out and see what Castiel found."
However, Castiel's expression changed when he saw what was in the room. Unlike the first room, this one already had its lights on, and in the dead center of it was a Twister mat along with the color wheel spinny thing. (It probably has a name, but I don't know what that name is, lol)
Dean was unable to control his honesty and read the card out loud. "It says - Have you ever been attracted to the same sex?"
"Well, right when I was about to enter Jack's room, I stopped because I heard Jack talking to someone in his room. I couldn't make out exactly what they were saying to one another, they spoke in whispers, but it was definitely a girl's voice that I heard responding to him." He explained.
"I was just trying to lighten the tension. Obviously, Chamuel wants to trap us here through the awkwardness of social conduct."
"No, this is," Dean said. "Castiel angel of the Lord and also the angel Thursdays apparently..., I am sorry for blaming you for practically everything under the sun recently. I've used you as a punching bag because I have been an all-around dick. I blame people for things they have little to do with, and I drive them away. But you can't quit family and Cas... Buddy, I consider you to be family. I needed you in my life since we first met, and I still do. So what do you say?"
Dean exhaled loudly. "Cas, I'm completely in the dark right now, quite literally. I can't see a damn thing... So yes, I, as well as any other human that is walking with you through this dark god-forsaken tunnel, would question why there is a freaking door inside a cave."
Finally, Dean came to a conclusion. He hated it, but it was sure to make Castiel at least loosen his grip on Dean.
"So, it's like when Gabriel put Sammy and me into the TV shows? We had to play our parts to get out." Dean said, finally realizing how similar this situation was to his previous experience with an archangel.
After one last hair fluff and teeth check, Dean grabbed the bouquet of yellow daffodils he had bought from the flower shop earlier and made his way back to the war room.
Dean turned around to face the direction that the voice came from. "Ahh. let me guess; you're another angel, aren't you?"
"The one and only Jensen Ackles, you're co-star and best friend, and also not to brag, but he is by far the hottest guy on set." Fake Dean stated.
"No, as I said before, time is a different construct here. So I can't set an exact time each day for you, to be honest, but I can limit it to a specific location in the cave."
"Yes, I quite enjoyed it when you, Sam, and I watched the one movie about the girl with the extremely long blonde hair and the brilliant little chameleon!" Cas said while internally reminiscing about his favorite parts of the film.
Despite the ongoing nagging in Dean's head, the closeness was unbearable. He felt drawn to Castiel, who stood above him, still just staring down with those stupidly beautiful blue ocean eyes. It would be so easy just to take him right here right now. But Dean refused. The goal at the moment was to lose the game, not to question his own sexuality.
"Look, Buddy... to be honest,  yeah, I was just doing what I to do to get out this cave.... but I didn't know about your deal or anything else. I just want to leave here, man.  I want to get back to the bunker with Sammy and you..."
Whoever this girl was, Dean thought she was stunning. She had dark raven-colored hair that went below her shoulders and bangs that rested beautifully on her forehead, and she was wearing a short tan skirt with white tights on underneath and a long-sleeved white button-up shirt that was tucked into the skirt.
"There are more things you both need to resolve before you leave the cave." Chamuel stated. "But since you got the main feud out of the way, the next few rounds should be a whole lot more umm... fun for the both of you." At the end of the phrase, her voice cut out, and both men knew she was done speaking to them for this round.
When he finally forced open his eyes, there was absolutely nothing. Dean couldn't see anything but the darkness surrounding him.
"Hahaha... I am laughing at you, you dumbass. You lept over the fire like you were some sort of gazelle or something. Hell, I don't think you even needed my jacket to get out of there. You jumped so high you probably could have jumped right over the flames."
Considering Castiel had just told Dean earlier about his deal with the empty, Cas thought it would be best not to let Dean know about this new ultimatum that Chamuel had inflicted upon him. Dean already had enough on his plate before this cave, and this was a choice Castiel had to make on his own.
Castiel stormed out of Room two, through the center room, and slammed the door to the bedroom open. Dean followed him a minute or so later. He was slightly thankful that he didn't have to linger in the center room any longer than necessary, considering that was the only place he was spellbound, to tell the truth.
Rachel somehow sped up the video and showed a bunch of clips where Dean was looking at different images. All of the clips proved Rachel's point. Throughout every short video that was shown, Dean's pupils remained practically the same size.
Dean's focus went from Cas to the flowers, then back again. He was so confused, but he knew he needed to play along with whatever was happening here.
"But what if it is Cas!" Dean exclaimed, trying to push the angel to see what he was getting at here. This conversation was by far the most annoyingly endearing but extremely frustrating conversation that he has ever had in his entire life. Why was it so hard for Cas to believe that Dean may want the same thing that he did.
"Castiel was one of the few remaining unattached or bachelor angles if you will. It was my job to assign him a mate with which he would pair with for the rest of eternity." Theo talked as if this was such a normal occurrence.
Sam turned back to the female angel and gave her his best 'my brother is an idiot so, please don't listen to him type smile. "Don't worry about it, Cassie. My brother isn't always the best with words," Sam explained.
"We don't have any living relatives on Dad's side of the family, Dea." Samantha responded. "Dad was an only child, his Dad was an only child, and if I remember correctly, our great grandfather only had one sister, so the last name of Winchester wouldn't have been passed down to anyone but us. So to answer your question, no, I don't think we are related to these men."
Rachel shot Dean a glare before rolling her eyes, "No, no, nothing like that, it's just a brief test that Naya and I put together. You have nothing to worry about, Dean."
The women grinned at the boys' question. It wasn't an evil grin though. It seemed more genuine and less conniving, which was odd considering the circumstances. Whoever this lady was, she didn't seem to be too threatened by the two men. In fact, Dean thought she seemed pretty harmless, but he knew too well that looks could be very deceiving. Because they were still trapped in a cave, Dean decided to put that observation on hold.
at all. He had planned to bury his mutual gender attraction just like he buried all his other feelings, 6 feet under with a layer of cement on top just to be safe. Being forced to dig up those thoughts and feelings after keeping them hidden for so long had broken something in Dean. He didn't know what it was, but he felt more insecure about himself than he had in a long while.
There was a pause of silence. Samantha was obviously weighing out all her options before jumping into action.
"Yes, exactly! Why go out there when there is plenty to enjoy right in here? Or anywhere that's not in there." Dean tilted his head in reference to the exit door.
Cas forced himself to leave the room as quickly as possible, even though what was in that room was still extremely tempting.
"This question has absolutely nothing to do with anything. How is this supposed to help our friendship or argument whatsoever?" Dean asked rhetorically.
Dean squinted his eyes in confusion before he followed Castiel's eyes down to his own hand. "Oh uh no... this isn't for you. I mean, I wasn't going to, you know - Uhm, Jody was supposed to come by to pick it up."
Both Dean and Castiel walked into the room unenthusiastically. Dean, of course, was less than thrilled because he wasn't sure what this room had in store for them. What drug would they make him take this time? Maybe acid? He hadn't tried acid before, but he was sure that it would be an absolute trip.
"Good, that confidence will be necessary during these next few rounds. By the way, this round requires you both to answer all four of the truth questions!" Chamuel replied.
Nonetheless, Castiel wasn't going to pry. So the angel closed his eyes and changed the scene around them. In a swift transition, the previous scene became the bunker.
Chamuel rolled her eyes. She was surprisingly sassy for someone trying to mimic the therapeutic profession. "I can't fully get rid of the spell Dean, but I can control when it affects you."
After completing his train of thought, Castiel realized that the two of them had been walking in complete uncomfortable silence. He knew that Dean still probably blamed him for Mary Winchester's death and now Rowena, but the current moment didn't seem like the correct time to attempt to make amends. He had already tried that before, and it didn't go over well.
All these thoughts and ideas began to overtake Dean, so much so that he had to take a step back.  It was an involuntary action, but the movement put some space between Dean and Castiel nonetheless. Cas fell forward a bit with his eyes still closed, trying to follow Dean's lips. But when he opened his eyes, he saw that Dean had stepped away from him.
Castiel let out a long sigh like he was about to admit something that had been on his chest for a long while. "My dream soulmate has green eyes, a well-defined jawline, light brown hair, and is taller than me."
Dean woke up to see that Castiel was sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at the wall away from him. This was odd because typically, when Dean woke up, Cas would be staring directly at him. Which, of course, was somewhat creepy, but maybe it was just an angel thing. It felt strange, though, that Castiel was instead staring off into space. Maybe even more strange than watching Dean while he slept. Dean would add that to what was now becoming quite a long list of things to think about later.
"Typically, I would agree with you on that, Dean, but based on the circumstances here... I am afraid I must insist." Chamuel replied.
"I remember... uhhhh - I remember...everything?" Castiel replied. Once again, his answer sounded like more of a question than a response. But no one seemed to notice, except for Jensen, of course, who internally concluded that something was definitely up with Misha.
On the other hand, Castiel was upset because he didn't feel like he was any closer to solving his situation with Dean. Maybe Dean had been right all along. Maybe this entire program was just a way to waste their time and energy.
"In the hypothetical timeline here, Sam died during a simple salt and burn case gone wrong. He would help me with cases every so often, so he offered to tag along when he heard I was in town. He and Jess were engaged at the time; however, they were in a rough patch because Sam had befriended some of the wrong people and got addicted to meth."
Before Castiel followed Dean, he came up with two likely conclusions for Dean's haste. Either he just wanted to rip the bandaid off and get this round over it so he could leave, or he was, in fact, still upset at Castiel's lack of disclosure from the night before.
Castiel glared at Dean. "I'm going to bed, and you would be wise to do the same." Castiel switches off the light and crawls into the bed.
"In the flesh, buckaroo!' Gabriel stated while leaning up against the door frame. "Chamuel wanted to make sure you played the game by the rules, and since you and I spent so much time together in that noggin of yours, I thought I would be the perfect archangel for the job."
Dean got up and walked straight into room three without turning around. He didn't want Castiel to see the blush that now filled his face.
"I know you do, Dean. You have made it quite clear. But I want to make this process a bit easier on you, and I never intended for O'Malley to create an honesty spell that would be so harmful to your psyche."
Dean was about to follow him, but as soon as he took a step, someone had grabbed his arm. He turned around to find none other than Gabriel.
. Somewhere along the line, I came across the original bunker in the same way that Sam and I originally found it when our Dad's father teleported through time. However, he wasn't being chased by a knight of hell (Abadon). This time instead, he was chased by an extremely vengeful gang of spirits that had killed everyone else in the men of letters chapter house. So here, I never had to go through with getting the mark of Cain because I didn't have to kill a night of hell. Anyway, Sam helped me secure the land and building permits. So, I used the schematics for the bunker to create an underground layer and dubbed this bar the
"Oh.... yeah, that ceremony. It must've slipped my mind." Dean said, pretending to hit his forehead, trying to play off his slip-up as some sort of joke.
"Welcome to my world, pal; I've been saying that the entire time. But just tell me what it says anyway."
Castiel still paid him no attention. So instead, Dean used his hand, which was still placed on Castiel's shoulder, to spin the man around as he had originally planned to do before the wings made their flash appearance. Castiel turned around without struggling and stared directly into Dean's eyes.
"It is so much stronger than that, Dean. It's hard to explain. It's hard for me even to grasp the concept at times. But I know I would do everything and anything for this man... I mean, I already rebelled against heaven for him. There is nothing I wouldn't do to keep him safe."  Castiel blushed at his own hint.
Nonetheless, Dean wasn't oblivious. He knew Sam must be extremely worried about him by now.  But then again, Sam was always worried about him, so why should he care?
"Fine!" Cas muttered while reaching his hand out towards the deck of cards and picking up the top one. "What would be the title of your memoir?" Castiel read to Dean.
Time was of the essence; Dean had absolutely no idea how much essence time was since Chamuel didn't give him Cas' ETA (estimated time of arrival). Nonetheless, time still equaled essence in his mind.
"You thought that I would summon you? Yet you haven't taken the chance to reply to any of Sam's texts or phone calls?"
After a moment or two, Dean squinted one eye open to peek out and make sure the coast was clear and that the blinding light, whatever it was, had ceased completely before he gained the courage to open both of his eyes fully.
Dean's eyes were wide with shock before he began laughing at Castiel's response. Damn, the angel had put a lot of thought into such a simple question, and it was hilarious to learn how he thought about things.
It was Dean, well the man looked exactly like Dean, but it wasn't his Dean. That much was clear just from the outfit that this Dean was wearing. He had on a black button-up shirt and nice gray slacks along with black shoes that looked like they were worth more than his Dean's entire wardrobe back at the bunker.
"I do... it's just that... well, based on your rewritten history behind this place, you and I would have never even met... I understand, though, after all the strife I put you and your brother through... I just thought that..."
"Most of the time, yeah! This business of hunting monsters use to be so much more simple before heaven and hell took over." Dean replied.
During those two months, Sam continued to be the persistent little shit brother Dean knew him to be, and he was able to get Dean to admit what had happened to him inside Chamuel's cave.
"Well, saying thank you is what most cultures believe is acceptable when responding to a compliment."
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Dean clenched his hands into a fist, but they remained planted at his sides.
"Good! So you know that I'm purposely just walking out of this conversation. Goodnight, Dea." He said, walking out of the room.
Dean began to tense up, not because it was awkward but because of the fact that it wasn't awkward. It was actually quite comforting, and that in its entirety made Dean uncomfortable.
"I didn't say I put it behind me Cas, I still am so pissed at what Jack did, but now that Jack is dead I... I just miss him, that's all. He and Mary they deserved so much better than what they got in life."
Castiel gave a silent nod in response to Dean's suggestion before making his way over to the card table. His wings were level now, so as he walked across the room, they didn't drag on the floor. However, both wings were still trembling quite violently despite their change in posture.
"This cave has been warded for many years, and each day those enchantments are only getting stronger by building off of Chamuel's grace. Meaning, the Empty or any other cosmic host have no jurisdiction here unless Chamuel allows them to."
"Come on Dean. It's just one game, and this brings us one step closer to leaving. Plus, do you remember how many times have I asked you to play twister with me in the bunker?" Castiel replied.
Sam knew this because his calendar had reminded him of it. Dean, however, had been ignoring the date for close to two months now, so he had no absolutely no clue.
"We... Ummm.. we haven't exactly figured out how to separate the two bunkers yet. We thought we would have more time to find the correct spell! Bringing them together was easy. All we had to do was say the spell simultaneously to bring both our bunkers together! But as far as I know, there isn't a reversal spell... well, at least there wasn't one in the spellbook Jane and I used." Jack explained.
