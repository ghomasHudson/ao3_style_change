“Jack.” Castiel responded. “After Lucifer stabbed me through my heart, it was just… blackness. Nothingness. Then I heard Jack calling my name, and when I awoke, I was
Sam’s chair scraped obnoxiously loudly as he stood, tucking it back under the table with that annoying strained smile of his still in place. “I’m not
The static electric was back once more, though this time for completely different reasons. It was a feeling Cas hasn't felt in a while now, that alluring, budding, growing feeling of
Dean blinks away the unexpected blindness, trying to peer past the spots in his vision to see what was going on. He can only gape in horror at the sight of…
“And here’s Mr. and Mr. Winchester!” Came Sam’s delighted shout, bringing out a joyous cheer from the small crowd that had gathered below, clapping at the two of them up on the balcony frozen in the small pile of colored paper pieces that were laid by their feet.
Castiel’s eyes dart between John and Mary, taking a single step back from John – only if to soothe Mary’s nerves somewhat.
Castiel could really give Sam a run for his money with his puppy-dog eyes, especially with those damn baby blues of his. They were way too effective in conversations like these- they usually sucked all the arguments Dean had formed right out of his head. If he wasn’t as strong of a man as he was, looking at them for more than five seconds would probably reduce him to a puddle on the floor. “I’m sorry for causing you this grievance, Dean. But I’m not sorry for making the deal. It was the only option I had at the time.”
“Hello, Castiel,” The man greets him with a welcoming smile as he stands from the chair. His voice is similar to his own, though not of the same grumbly, rough pitch.
Dean could see just how bad of a state the guy was in; dark bruises were littered all over the man’s pale skin, multiple cuts and lacerations decorating every piece of skin Dean could see, oozing out streams of dark blood that stained the button-up shirt of the man’s suit.
“I’m sure,” Claire insisted with a soft smile at the girl behind her. “I’ll be fine, I promise. Cas is looking out for me.”
“That’s what they told me, yeah,” Sam answered, craning his head around so Eileen could read his lips, coming to a stop in the center of the room. “He just needs a few days to recover from the blood loss, and make sure his immune system doesn’t start attacking the metal pins in his spine.”
its shape, pieces of flesh and muscles tearing away from it, blood seeping out from the ball of human material and smearing across the white lines of the sigil.
Dean could feel Cas’s eyes burning a hole through him now, forcing his gaze back up to meet Cas’s intense one. Intense, yet… almost sad.
Castiel didn’t question it, going with the flow and pushing himself off of Dean as he shuffled around until his back was facing Dean, moaning in relief as he felt Dean slide back into him. Instincts took over, his body rocking forward and back in chase of that final release. Dean’s muted grunts came from just behind Cas’s ear before he felt the searing heat of Dean’s lips against the side of his neck. Castiel arched his neck to the side, giving Dean more space to work with. Dean made a trail down Cas’s neck, stopping once he reached the dip where it met the collarbone.
to give him a call, but I wanted to give it to you so the option is there. Your brother is good at putting on a brave face, but it’s one I’ve seen many times before. Those that make it seem like everything’s alright are usually the ones that are suffering the most. I’m hoping you’ll never need to call that number, but… challenging times lie ahead for both you and your brother, and there’s nothing wrong with finding help.”
“Cas?” Dean croaks out at the sight of him. He scrambled towards Cas as fast as his arms would let him, cursing his useless legs for slowing him down as he pulls himself towards the angel – if he still was one, that is.
“I don’t have to be an angel to see how brightly your soul shines, Dean.” Castiel’s voice rumbled through Dean’s chest from where Cas was leaning on him. “I can see it shining through when you smile, and through your eyes when you see your family.”
The grace seems to move on instinct, sliding towards the bowl instead of towards its owner, like a part of Sam was worried it would.
It’s far from the best kiss Dean’s ever had. The taste of Castiel’s blood is metallic and tangy under his lips, and he went into the kiss a bit too rushed and hard. There’s definitely a clash of teeth at first, and a kiss was apparently the last thing Cas was expecting as his lips remained frozen in disbelief for some good few seconds. And yet, it was perfect.
The door to the bunker creaks loudly as he pushes it open, announcing his presence. A quick glance from the top of the stairs reveals the map room and library to be empty, with no Cas in sight.
"How did you get away when you're under such watchful eyes?" Dean asks his son, smiling at the mischievous giggle he gets in return.
The corner of Eileen’s lips lifted in a sympathetic smile, lifting up her hand at chest height, palm down and parallel with her body. “Let me guess; this is where your problem is, and this-,” Her hand lifted up to above her head. “-Is where Cas is?”
is one hell of a story…” Dean says with a half-hearted laugh. “And it ties into the reason we’re here.”
Castiel shakes his head in disgust at John, who looks torn between keeping up his mask of rage or cowering away from the centuries-old being so fervently defending his own son. “For all of that? You deserve much worse than a single punch, John Winchester.”
Dean’s breath hitches in a strangled gasp as the flames of the candles first begin to flicker, blowing about like there was some sort of wind rushing past them before they begin to steadily grow in height, able to feel the heat of them against his face as they rise.
Cas stretched out a tentative hand towards Miracle, slowly moving his hand as not to spook her. He stopped his hand right in front of her snout, to which Miracle gave him an eager sniff.
“He did stop me from dying,” Sam offers awkwardly, able to feel the amped-up tension radiating from Eileen.
“Sammy's fine. He’s a little shaken up, but he’s okay.” Cas lowered his arm down to Dean’s level, who immediately peered over the crook of Cas's elbow to keep a watchful eye on his baby brother.
be scared. The being in front of him was terrifying by all means and yet for some reason, as he stared into the creature’s eyes, Dean felt a warm sense of comfort wash over him. Because those dazzling, glowing blue eyes were
Dean bobs his head up and down as Cas’s words wash over him. He pauses, brows furrowing as he thinks back…
“If that is to happen…” Castiel continued, his voice firm with his urgency. “You are to forcefully eject me, Dean.”
“Nothing, just…” Sam cleared his throat. “We’re… probably going to have to hand the invitation over to a cross-road demon or something… Already picturing the look on its face as it hands over a fancy piece of card with ‘You are cordially invited to the wedding of Castiel and Dean Winchester’ printed on it.”
"Seems like his MO, don't it?  Seems a hell of a lot to me like Chuck is setting up the biggest dramatic finale he can, and
“Not sure,” Castiel placed his glass back on the bar, done with his inspection. “I have two theories; The first being that, since we now share a body, your memories of the taste of alcohol are accessible to me. So, if I drink or eat in your mind, I will taste it, feel it and smell it in the way you remember eating it.”
“Wouldn’t that be a travesty,” Castiel said dryly, glancing down at his new attire, clearly unimpressed.
“Big me doesn’t have many friends,” Little Dean continued, the words dampening Cas’ smile just a bit. “Anyone he tries to get close to seem to… go away. Kind of like mommy and daddy did.”
Eileen and Sam’s face dropped at the news, practically deflating at the table. “So… what does this mean?” Sam asked.
Dean sputtered, nearly choking on the mouthful of beer in his mouth (even though he’s about ninety-nine percent sure he can’t choke in Heaven). “I haven’t been up here
of the memory. It was of a happy family, nothing more. The others though... I just didn't understand it. In all of them, you... You were in pain. You were hurt, or you were
“…You okay, Dean?” Sam asked, taking a few awkward steps closer to his brother’s side. The glare Dean shot up at him answered his question in more ways than words could. The glare quickly dropped from Dean’s face, crumpling in on himself, trying to hide away from his brother’s woeful gaze.
Dean wheeled himself over to the end of the table, the beginnings of a smile on his face as he looked down at the names crudely carved into the wood.
"If he'll wake up," Castiel finishes grimly, crouching down to Dean's side and placing a hand on the elder Winchester's head.
“Because they deserved it,” The dangerous edge was back in Cas’s voice again. “And… because I couldn’t protect you when you needed me.”
“I’m not saying that,” Rowena said gently, keeping her gaze focused on Dean alone despite the four other pairs of eyes staring at her. “It’s hard to know for sure when I have never performed the spell myself – as well as it only being done once. There’s every chance this could work with the grace you have, but…”
“Oh…” Dean swallowed deeply, glancing down to the burnt-out Vamp body by his feet. “And… Why’d you go all psycho-angel on my dream Vamps?”
“We don’t know until we ask, right?” Sam attempts to douse the paranoia rising. “If he’s as good as advertised…”
That got their attention. Their shared amused grins were immediately wiped off their face, focus now locked on Dean.
“Guess we know who wears the pants in this family…” Alex mumbles to Patience, who hides her snort of laugher in the glass of coke she had brought up to her mouth.
world out there. I was raising them with survival in mind, but I… I never once stopped to consider if they were actually
"I...." Castiel tries to speak, but it seemed like Dean had managed to steal all the words from his mouth. He swallows sharply, hoping that clearing his throat would help him to find the words he needs to speak.
“Should be here in about ten minutes,” Eileen said. Her eyes ran over all three who stood in front of her, quickly realizing the problem at hand. “Um... aren’t we missing our officiant?”
“Alright,” Sam pushed away from the table, giving Cas a pat on the back that he was fairly certain Cas didn’t even process considering his fixed attention on Dean. “So, uh I think, uh…”
Eileen rushes to her duffle bag, throwing the zip open and searching through its contents until she found the swiss army knife she keeps tucked away. She flicks the small blade open, making a small incision into the side of the thick paper, carefully sawing across the side until it had been fully opened. Sure enough, when she shakes the thick piece of paper over the bed, another piece of paper falls out. This paper was much thinner than the other, only slightly smaller, and filled with writing almost too small to see.
“Hey, no, it’s a good thing you brought the idea up,” Dean insisted. “If it turned out it could have worked, and we didn’t even bother to try it because you didn’t want to bring it up? That would have been so much worse.”
“Yeah, I didn’t know what to do about that one.” Eileen’s voice filtered up from down below. Sam and Dean peered over the edge of the railing to see Eileen stood by the map table, craning her head up to see them. “I went out and bought some small ramps and set them up around the bunker on the smaller stairs, but... this one’s a bit too long to do that.”
“And you’re… what, asking me for permission?” Dean wheeled himself over to the sink, focusing on dropping his plates into the soapy water rather than on Sam and Eileen’s matching looks of guilt.
The sounds of gunshots fill the air as Bobby and Dean fire their shotguns, each hitting their marks. Memory Cas's trenchcoat is torn apart from the spray of the shells, yet he continues towards them like it wasn't even happening.
“Alright, alright, everyone knew me and Cas had a thing for each other before either of us did. We got it…” Dean grumbles, copying the moody teenager opposite by crossing his arms, glaring at the concealed smiles of the others in the room.
Saying it out loud seemed to make it sink in even harder. A tear from his blurred vision spills over, slipping down his face and dropping to the ground where it mixed with the pool of blood that had formed on the ground, the flow from his back growing steadily slower.
“That’s two weeks too long,” Dean replies, meaning it full-heartedly. “Told you I’d follow you, didn’t I?”
an angel who has lost his grace, Dean. My grace is still here, just changed. Adapted. I’m human in every sense of the word.”
. Right here in front of him, alive and warm under his hands. His future was back, looking right at him, and for once in his damned life it felt like everything was going to be
When Cas seems to snap back into his own body, Dean is surprised to see the sheen of tears that appeared in his eyes and the quick, shocked little gasp he let out. Fear twisted inside Dean like a knife in his gut, waiting in tense anticipation for Cas to say something.
Back then, on that terrible day, left skewered like a kebab, the concept of death scared him. And it wasn’t like that was particularly a
“They really think Dean’s good to go in a few days?” Eileen followed just behind Sam as they descended the bunkers metal stairs, stepping out into the map room.
“I think I got some spare sweats you could borrow,” Dean mumbles as he pushes himself up to his feet, bending down to offer a hand to Cas.
Cas does so, albeit somewhat confused, and regards Dean with half a confused frown, and half an amused smile, as Dean takes his other hand and places it on the small of Cas's back, holding their conjoined hands out in front of them.
Dean shook himself out of his trance, focusing on treading the water as Castiel smoothly pushed through the water towards him. Dean had partly been expecting (hoping, if he’s being honest with himself) that Cas would be a flailing kind of swimmer, but of course Cas took to swimming as naturally as a duck took to water. Makes sense he supposed, as Cas had
Cas almost looked offended at his question. “Of course not. I’d never do anything that would affect you – not without your permission.”
"And I never will be. But there are a lot more worse ways for me to lose you than the chance you get yourself killed on a hunt, and I don't think I could live with myself if
"I know, I know. I do. You're so different from the other winged dicks, that I sometimes forget" Dean jokes, feeling quite proud that the comment gets a light snort from Cas.
happiness – with Dean. And now, as Sam thinks to the extra bottles of beer he found lying around the Bunker, and Dean’s sudden urge to be all cuddly with Miracle… he’s beginning to understand why Dean had been mourning Cas just a little differently than he had last time.
“Hmm. Instead, you send your aging body into dangerous hunts that would be challenging even to your twenty-six-year-old self. Smart.”
The howling wind of the night is all that responds to his prayer. Sam searches around in the darkness, hoping to see Jack’s smiling figure appear somewhere nearby with a wave of his hand.
Castiel knew full well that he had, as the Winchesters would say "fucked up". It hadn't been the first time he had kept something hidden from the brothers, and while they were two very different situations, it had been a long, hard journey of regaining their trust. Would it be the same again? It wasn't like they had the time for it, not when the world as they knew it was crumbling around them, the souls of the damned crawling out of Hell to wreak havoc among the living.
“Then we have a problem, Cas.” Dean told him calmly. “Because I’m sure as hell not letting you throw yourself in the firing line again. Not for me. And you can bet damn sure that I’m throwing myself in the way if I see you try and pull that shit.”
“Not this. Not the Empty. It’s… it’s not even in existence, really. Something that sits in between. The Empty was here before
would be the devil's kid, then…” Dean paused for a moment. “Actually, I probably would believe it. Maybe ten years ago I wouldn’t.”
“It started off small. Back-talk, at first. Refusing to listen to our parents. Eventually, he stopped showing up to our home-schooling lessons altogether. He started sneaking out of the house, meeting up with people that… That people like ‘
“You have a good dream you didn’t want to wake up from something?” Sam joked, having no idea how close to the truth he actually was.
The voice was gruff, grated, that of a man who had either smoked ten packs of cigarettes a day or had had his vocal cords shredded apart. It was familiar, like coming home, and he wants to scream to the Universe how fucking
“Hey, um… God. Or is it still Jack? I’m not sure what you prefer…” Eileen begins, unsure whether she should have her hands clasped together in prayer for this to work. She does it anyway, just to be on the safe side. “I, uh…. I never actually got to meet you. I was dead when you were born… then you were dead when I was brought back, then I left when you were brought back… we uh, kind of kept missing each other.”
"Sammy?" Dean asks, the harsh tone they had heard him speaking in since they had got here reverting to a much softer, innocent-sounding voice.
Castiel blinks rapidly at him for a few moments, the blank and emotionless look on his face doing nothing to soothe Dean’s nerves.
“Whatever,” Sam mumbled, swiping the cup out of Dean’s hands once his guard was down. “You gonna text this Cas guy?”
, Cas.” Dean cursed sharply. “If we hadn’t got back when we did - if Jack hadn’t returned your grace to you when he did…”
’ weren’t supposed to mingle with. I was young when it happened, couldn’t have been more than eight or so, but, one night…” Castiel paused, taking a deep, shaky breath. “I had never heard such yelling like that, Dean. Gabriel was trying to shield me from most of it, I think he was worried things were going to get violent. So, when Lucifer turned to Michael for help… I don’t know what he thought would happen. We
“Honestly? Could be,” Sam said with a light chuckle. “Place is fairly new; I think it only opened a few months ago. From what I’ve heard, place is run entirely just by two brothers.”
The caps twist off easily, and they blink out of existence a few seconds after he chucks them down into the dirt. No littering in heaven, he supposed. He keeps one in his hand, the other he leaves resting next to him on the hood, a few beads of condensation slipping down the glass as the sun beats down on it. Dean takes a swig of his own beer, satisfied in the knowledge that drunk driving isn’t a thing he has to even consider anymore.
“You never know,” Sam tried to stay optimistic for the sake of his brother. “There’s always a chance, right? Maybe we can find something to help fix your legs in our research, too.”
And he was gonna try. No matter how much Cas's loss left a hole in his life. He was gonna carry on. He was gonna pull himself out of bed, he was gonna greet Miracle every morning with the cuddles she deserves (along with leftover scraps that Sam didn't approve of but couldn’t seem to find within himself to scold Dean for), he was gonna get himself a job, a
’, of all he wanted to say to Cas, but never could. And every time that realization will set in that he’ll never get to say those words to him, because he was too much of a coward. Because it was easier to stay as what they were, because he couldn’t handle the change. He’ll think about all the things he would say if he were still alive, and when Cas finds his way back to
“Oh. Oh, wait, does that mean you only like being called Castiel? Ah crap, I’ve been calling you Cas this whole time, I didn’t think. Sorry, I’ll-“
Eileen responds by rolling her eyes at him, grabbing the page by its side and flipping the piece of paper over to reveal another page of writing.
When he tried to think of himself getting out of the hunter life, settling into that domestic civilian one… he could never see it. Mostly because… he always thought he’d be alone that way. Sam would go on and live his own life, and where would that leave him? Whenever he tried to imagine himself meeting someone, picturing that person by his side… the face was always blank. Which is perhaps why he could never see the whole thing working out. And now, taking in the sight of his angel smiling so peacefully as he recounts the few memories he has of a God that seemed to care… he lets himself
Baby’s tires squeal against the road as Dean slams his foot onto the brakes, leaving behind black burn marks on the road as the Impala comes to a sudden stop on the empty road. Dean’s chest heaves with heavy intakes of breath like he’s just ran a damn marathon, fingers trembling as they remain gripped tight around the steering wheel. “You… you can’t-,”
a family. That I was part of your family. And now, these past few weeks… you’ve given me more to smile about, Dean.”
with that. Coming back from the Empty on what I knew from the start would be nothing more than borrowed time… it’s been a blessing. Do you know why?”
For the briefest of moments, Castiel can see a flash of hope on Dean's face. It's gone as quick as it had come, and he was expecting Dean to roll right back into his look of indifference, locking away his emotions from prying eyes.
His words get caught in his throat as he swings the doors open, staring bug-eyed into the interior of the closet. Even Cas seemed to have been shocked into silence in his head.
“I didn’t want to confront you with something that would make you uncomfortable. And, truth be told, whilst
“That’s kind of like what I was telling you about the other night,” Sam added in. “I thought the same thing as you- that Gabriel was just shyer over the phone.”
Sam sighed at his brother's annoying sense of pride, taking his hands off the handles and holding them out in front of him in surrender. Dean nodded his head at him, turning his head back around to face forward before placing his hands on the wheels, pushing them forward and sending the wheelchair traveling towards the open door. Sam and Doctor Sullivan stood there and watched as Dean immediately collided with the frame of the door, listening to him curse quietly to himself as he reversed back from the door, then succeeded to go through and out into the hallway the second time around.
Sam’s phone buzzes from within his jean pocket. Two short vibrations – a text message, not a call. Sam sighs quietly to himself, not ready to face anyone just yet. Still, he digs in his pocket for his phone, pulling it out from its confines and swiping his thumb across the screen, waiting for it to light up.
Dean risks a glance over to Cas. He looks...well, like Cas. There’s a certain sense of peace to him now, though. He doesn’t
Sam broke out into a sprint, kicking up sprays of water as he pushed through the puddles that had formed across the tarmac. Eileen’s face broke out into a beaming smile, one he knew he was mirroring right back at her. The two crashed into one another, Sam pulling the smaller woman into his chest and enveloping her with his large frame, wrapping his arms around her. She was
“Hey, I look more related to Sam than you look related to Cas,” Dean wasn’t entirely sure why he was defending his genetic relation to Sam.
There’s a flash of silver in front of him, Sam’s machete sliding effortlessly through the Vamp’s neck in one clean cut. Dean flinches instinctively away from the spray of blood, the last few spurts of blood gushing from its neck, the last of the creature’s heartbeats as the signals are cut. Its head slides off, seconds before the lifeless body collapses to the ground in a heap.
“Gabriel was sneaking out to the library,” Castiel continues. “Checking out books for me. I didn’t touch them, at first. Too terrified of the consequences if my parents found out, but… eventually, the curiosity got the better of me and, well, you know the saying.”
Kelly untangles her arms from around his neck, quickly wiping the tears off her face as she does. “You’ve given so much for him, I… I don’t even know what to say.”
The Impala was unbearably hot, and the sticky feeling of Cas’s seed between his fingers was certainly unpleasant, but Dean couldn’t find it in himself right now to move. More than that, he would have to ask
“I didn’t even go to the Empty,” Castiel answered, one of those rare gummy smiles breaking out across his face. “It was
“Essentially, yes.” Doctor Sullivan agreed. “You just need to brace yourself with one arm on the handle, then pull your body over and lower yourself onto the wheelchair. Again, I must repeat how important it is to keep the brakes applied at this stage, otherwise you risk seriously injuring yourself.”
Castiel was grateful for the subject change, some of the tension in his posture slipping away. “Your brother, I believe. When Dean was… when he was
told me that I had come to care for the kid and seen him as one of our own, I would probably just have to stab you on principle.”
Castiel grunted, picking up his half-emptied beer bottle and taking a quick swig. “In my defense, your brother is much more well-mannered than Gabriel. How was I supposed to know it wasn’t you?”
Dean could only stand there like an idiot and watch Castiel as he walked out of the room, beige trench-coat fluttering out of sight. After a few seconds of the most awkward silence Dean thinks he’s ever had to live through, Dean blurts out what’s on his mind. “What just
“I don’t have much of a say in the matter.” It sounded like it pained Castiel to say that. “I don’t have much hope for us defeating God. If there’s anyone that has even a small chance, any
“Wait…” Claire stopped Dean before he could start, her eyes darting between all three of them. “Where’s Castiel? And no offense, but uh… who’s this chick?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean stopped him, leaning forward and folding his hands together on the table in front of him. “Did you just say
"Dean?" Memory Cas seems to say mostly to himself, almost as if he was struggling to believe that he was really hearing Dean, that he had somehow managed to find him.
It wasn’t all ‘panic over what flowers to use, what food to serve, where guests will sit’ and all that other crap you saw in tv shows and movies. Mostly because… there wasn’t really much
“A banshee? Does that mean you’re a hunter, too?” Kaia piped up, starting to shift away from her hiding space behind Claire.
Dean stretched over to the Impala as far as his weakened back would let him, placing his palm down on her leather seats. With his other hand on his chair, he began pulling himself over, gritting his teeth in pain at the twinge in his back, his arms trembling with the effort. The gap between the chair and the Impala was too large, and Sam could see it happen before it even happened. Dean’s arm gave away the same time the chair tipped over, sending Dean sprawling into the asphalt with a pained grunt, getting the air knocked out of him upon impact.

hear you, you know.” Sam called from behind the lid of his laptop, sat at the bunker’s kitchen table. Jack happily munched on his ‘Krunch Cookie Crunch’ opposite Sam, amused eyes flickering between the two brothers.
“You’ve been smiling more recently, though.” Dean points out. “These past few years with Jack… you seemed… happier.”
Claire chuckled at the unusual softness Dean was displaying, along with the fact that Dean was very nearly dragging her off the couch with his hug. “You went back into the bad place to get Kaia back, so… only fair I did what I could to get Cas back to you.”
“Shit…” Sam mumbled, running a hand through his hair, glancing down at the papers in front of him. “That’s… not great.”
“Honestly? I have no clue.” Sam replied. “Things are going to go back to the way they were, I suppose. He won’t step in or anything like that, he’s just… working behind the scenes.”
That’s unless he wants to leave her to rust by herself in some random garage and risk Dean forcing himself out of heaven as a vengeful spirit to rip his little brother a new one.
“Wow, uh…” Dean mumbled, awkwardly shuffling his legs atop the Impala. “You know, I uh… I’m not used to hearing stuff like that, man. Most girls that throw themselves out me, are, well… let’s say they’re not in it for
Castiel breached the surface of the ocean in a fit of spluttering coughs, feverishly wiping the water out from his stinging eyes. He looked to Dean in absolute bewilderment once his vision was better than the blurry mess it was before, unsure whether to be infuriated beyond belief or genuinely amused by the way Dean was laughing so hard that he could barely keep himself afloat.
“Nice surprise to see the only big news was you and Dean deciding to pull your heads out of your assess,” Jo tells him with a grin, receiving a smack to the back of her head from the towel in her mother’s hand.
Another two hours passed in companionable silence, the only sounds in the library being Miracle’s snuffled snores and the occasional flip of the ancient and fragile papers under Dean’s fingers. Cas hadn’t said or anything to him in that time – or pointed out something that Dean had skipped over – which only made Dean feel all that more disheartened about this whole ‘creating a body’ idea. He hadn’t really considered the possibility that the idea might not be possible… He had just assumed he’d find
"Scared of what, Dean?" Castiel insists gently, taking one step closer to Dean. He sees the familiar look of panic in Dean's eyes, the same eyes that flick down to the floor, head bowed ever so slightly as he tries to pull away from Castiel.
Dean conveys this information over to Sam and Eileen, who only appear more worried at the news. Sam sighs, scratching at the stubble growing across his cheeks. “With the experiment Sinclair used… he extracted nearly
“Dean, I once saw you puking up into a bush when you thought Sam and I weren’t looking after you bet Sam you couldn’t eat a
“Oh, Deano, Deano,” Dean could hear his teeth grinding together as Gabriel jogged up to his side with a shit-eating grin. “My little bro really left an impression on you, huh?”
“I see,” Castiel replied with an understanding yet sad smile. “Why did you and Sam leave the bunker?”
fuck-ups, and it’s eating him alive that he doesn’t know how to fix this. He wants to see Cas smiling and laughing again, without a care in the world.
“I wanted to talk to you for a bit, if you don’t mind. Just me and you,” Jack answered. Kelly stepped forward, giving Castiel’s hand one big squeeze of goodbye before she was heading back towards the cabin, disappearing through its door and out of sight.
As he said it, two bottles of beers appeared magically from thin air on the table. A brief surge of excitement ran through Dean, thinking he had managed to do it himself, but the pleased smile he saw on Cas’s face quickly proved him wrong.
They didn’t have to make too many changes to the clearing itself. What few logs and twigs littered about the forest floor were moved out of the way. Then, looking at the pile of wood they had made, Sam had the brilliant idea to lay out the smaller, thinner logs into a makeshift aisle leading up to the willow tree.
“You have cruel, cruel parents, Jack,” Claire told a rather befuddled-looking Jack, steering him away from them and towards the library, with Alex, Patience, and Kaia in tow. “C’mon – you’ve got many things to learn…”
Dean can’t control the trembling of his fingers as they run through Castiel’s hair, his other arm pulling Castiel closer to him as his body is wracked with more sobs he has no hope of holding back. “
The bar Castiel found himself stepping into was familiar. Usually, it’s quite difficult to name particular bars as they generally all have the same feel; grimy tables sticky with various alcoholic beverages, worn and damaged bar stools, pools of blood and other liquids that he’d rather not think about stained on the cheap vinyl flooring.
Well, no time like the present. Dean focused on the table in front of him, eyes squinting and body straining as he tries to summon two frosty beers. He released his held breath with a harsh sigh when nothing appeared, crossing his arms and pouting like a child.
“Yes,” Castiel answered, nose crinkling in disgust at the memory of the cherry-red tinted vomit. “I tried distracting Sam by asking him about a ‘meme’ Claire had sent me on my phone so he wouldn’t see you, quite literally, throwing away your winning bet.”
The realization struck Dean just as he was about to say it. “A shell…” That was exactly what they were looking for. A shell. A
“Wait here,” Sam instructed him, his voice already beginning to shake. Dean would have laughed if the pain wasn’t so horrific. It wasn’t like he could

"This isn't it," Real Castiel interrupts, hand already outstretched towards the next shimmer, choosing to look down at the ground in front of Sam, rather than re-live the memory in front of him. "The next ones ready."
seeing them. The feathers were a deep, ebony black, so dark it seemed like no light was being absorbed by them; the only exception being the sheen of bright colors reflecting off each individual feather, coming together to form a rainbow of colors that shone brightly as Heaven’s sunlight glinted off of them. It reminded Dean of… an oil spill. Those beautiful colors only revealed when exposed to the light of the sun.
He knew Billie was dead. Cas made sure of it, his last act on this Earth. Yet, the proof was in front of him. He wasn’t going to Heaven
“Jesus!” Cas hissed in pain as the top of his head slammed into the roof of the Impala, bringing up a hand to rub at the lump he could already feel growing.
“That’s what we need to find out,” Sam stressed. “Cas told us there were barely any angels left in Heaven, and I can't see any of them being willing to fly down here and help Dean – and there’s no way Dean would
Sam didn’t really know how he was supposed to respond to that. This was a conversation about his brother that seemed a bit more…
Because he doesn’t know if this is the last night they’ll ever get together. He doesn’t know if this is the end. If the world was ending.
life is. It's an obstacle course, and maybe Chuck designed the obstacles, but we ran our own race. We made our own moves. And mostly? We did well with that."
let alone then. All I could think about was that you were saying goodbye, and I wasn’t… I thought I could
Don’t tell me that. Take it back. Go back to before, before you were happy. It was selfish of him to say, but he didn’t want Cas to be happy. Not if it ended like this. Not if his happiness took him away.
He doesn't. But he doesn't look happy either. Instead, he appears even more pissed than before, and a frown deep enough to rival Cas own is etched into his face as he tugs at the arm keeping him pinned to the wall.
between himself and Dean. This awful tension, a feeling of uncertainty between them, that one wrong word could set the other off, whether that be into a spew of hateful words, or in a flurry of fists, both undesirable, but the latter being one that might just push them both over the edge of no return.
Speak of the devil, those bounding ‘taking two steps at a time’ footsteps stomping down the stairs could only be those of teenage angst, two other pairs of footfalls following just behind, though much calmer than the ones of the blonde-haired girl that appears in the doorframe leading to the living room.
But now, here in the bunker, pulling himself out of bed, Dean felt… nervous. Yes, that’s what it was. He was
“Now, if we’re done with the threats…” Sergei announced with a clap of his hands. “How about we get down to the reason I’m here? Is it true, what I was told on the phone?”
Cars passed by him on the road, a blur of taillights and obnoxiously bright LED’s. So many strangers whose only experience of him is a brief image of a soaked man walking in the rain, never to know of the stories he held, of the lengths he went to ensure they get to experience their lives without the pain he holds.
“Glad I’m of some use,” Dean says, eyes flicking up to Cas’s as he picks up on something else. His finger shifts from where it had settled in the dip of Cas’s chin, his feather-like touch now brushing across the corner of Cas’s eyes. “You’ve got crow-eyes too, now. Don’t really see it with the small smiles, but every now and then you do these smiles with your eyes and they’re there. That’s how I know you’re

For someone he loves. And there’s no skirting around that now. Cas had said it outright. No more implications, no more hidden meanings... Cas loved him.
Dean made a dreadful shot at a joke, the unsure smile on his face dropping away. “You know what, forget I said that—That was a terrible joke to make at a time like this…”
“He’s gone, Sammy,” And then his brother's arms were wrapped around him again, a mutual understanding, a mutual grief shared between the two. “I couldn’t save him, I-,”
The Impala was one such place. Sure, she has a lot of memories attached to her, both good and bad, but once he's behind the wheel, it doesn't matter. All he needs is to feel the well-worn, well loved leather of the steering wheel and seats, and the reassuring rumble of Baby as she purrs along the road, and its almost as if he could pretend the whole world wasn't literally resting on their shoulders.
“Ladies and Gents, witches, former angels, former demons, Gods… whatever title you’d like… I think we can all agree that this is a sight we’d never thought we’d see,” Rowena begins, spreading out her arms to gesture at all around them. “And yet, here we are — standing at Dean Winchesters wedding. And not
Dean turned to Cas once the group disappeared into the hallway – most likely to use Jack’s powers to change all of the alcohol in the bunker into water or some ironic shit like that – sharing an amused look with his new husband.
Dean takes another deep breath, one just as unsuccessful as the last few. He holds the phone limply in his closed fist, staring blankly out into the bunker before bringing his fist down hard on the table, barely resisting the urge to launch his “too expensive to keep breaking through rage or hunts” across the room.
to hear him sing. So hearing him now, out of tune yet singing with such lightness and delight, as if he was singing like no could hear him because, after all, that was what Cas thought. They had told Cas they wouldn't be home for another day andd so, as far as Cas was concerned, he was alone with the bunker all to himself.
“Can I tell you a secret too?” Castiel asked, keeping his voice as hushed as Dean was. Dean eagerly nodded his head, eyes wide as saucers as he waited for Cas to spill his secrets. “I’m scared of losing you, too. And it never goes away. That’s what happens when you love someone.”
Whoa, okay… The sudden hostility from Cas nearly had Dean flinching. He could feel the way Cas’s mood had shifted, back to that electric buzz he had felt back in the hospital when he had pissed Cas off. Except, this time, it was… muted. Even though Cas was stuck in his head, he had found a way to hide himself somewhere so deep inside that Dean could barely feel his presence within him; quite literally storming off into another ‘room’.
“My grace,” Castiel repeats himself. “I asked Jack if he could heal you, Dean. But he told me there was nothing for him to heal, and that… that
Dean rushes forward before Cas can finish his sentence, throwing his arms around Cas’s shoulders and burying his head into his neck. He’s fully aware his hands are shaking, scrunching up the back of Castiel’s trench coat so tightly that he can feel some threads popping loose under his fingers. Castiel’s hands were wrapped around his back in return, squeezing Dean close with all his worth, eyes squeezed shut in content with his head nestled next to Dean’s.
Dean’s grip on the wheels of his chair was so tight that he could feel the rubber material peeling away from underneath the force of his nails. He could feel the anger churning away inside him, ready to burst out with one wrong word…
Rowena’s gaze had dropped down to Dean as she said that, a surprisingly sympathetic look crossing the witches – demons…? Witch-demons-queen of hell’s face. “Firstly, I suppose I should offer my thanks for saving the world again. At least, I assume you have, since we’re all still here.”
“There he is!” The excited yell comes from somewhere to his left, and he’s only just about able to turn his head towards the person yelling before his vision is overtaken by a small red-headed woman wrapping herself around him, nearly sending him stumbling back out of the Roadhouse.
“Maybe it was selfish of me,” Dean admitted. “I just… I wasn’t used to staying in one place. Growing up, we moved from state to state. In the army, I went from training camp to military bases, to deployments.”
, if he’d bring everyone back, bring you back… But then I kept hearing your words in my head. I kept thinking about how you did that, for
“He’s okay,” Cas is quick to assure him, and Dean feels the tension practically melt away from his body. “He’s more than okay, in fact.”
Dean laughs. He can’t help it. They’re small hushed snorts of laughter, dropping his chin down into his chest and shaking his head, his shoulders shaking with every chuckle. “Oh, Cas… We’re both idiots, aren’t we? Biggest damn idiots there are.”
"There were two, not the one like we thought," Sam adds in, cautiously moving closer to his brother. "We had no idea. He snuck up on us after we dealt with the other. Do you... Do you remember that part?"
The silence that followed was different from the one before. It was one filled with hesitant hope. The kind of tension that makes your heart feel tight in your chest, makes your breath quicken, makes it
“You mean when your father abandoned you at a young age, leaving you to fend for both yourself and your brother to the point you were forced to steal to feed yourselves?”
Dean’s throat burns furiously as he smiles at Cas, hoping that if he somehow does make it to that ripe old age where you can pretty much eat only soup and spend your day's retailing stories of your youth, that his aged and concussion addled brain remembers every detail of
Dean makes a ‘pfft’ sound in response, waving off his brother’s good manners. “Where’s the fun in that? I wanna see the surprise on her face when we show up unannounced at their doorstep – with

never gave up. Because I had you, and with you I had Sam, I had Jack, I had Claire, and Jody, and… well, through you, I had family. I had a reason.”
I don’t believe you. Not one bit.” Castiel said between fits of laughter as Dean pulled into an empty field, switching the stick next to the wheel to ‘Park’ and switching off the engine. Now with the purr of her engine silenced, the only sound to be heard was the insects chirping away within the field, and the sound of Castiel’s rumbling laughter.
Here Cas was, somehow having escaped from a bunch of freak leviathans before being handed over to what would likely be horrendous torture and a death sentence from the mother of all monsters, manages to find the stupid fucking flower they came all the way out here for, get all the way
“I Don’t Care,” Sam answered, frowning at his choice of words. “Wait, that sounds weird, it was an-“
“It’s been a pleasure to hear your story,” Castiel reassured him, raising a hand and catching the eye of a passing waitress to order another beer for himself and Dean. “All you’ve done for your brother? You’re an incredible man, Dean.”
“No,” The single word Sergei uttered was enough to kick all the air out of Dean’s lungs. “Or at least, not to my knowledge. I
“I think so, yeah,” Eileen answers, parking Dean in front of the table before pulling the folded piece of paper out of her back pocket. “You remember that file on the angel experiment? The exorcism one with the explosives?”
“After a while, it kind of just… faded away,” Dean explained, experimentally probing at the scar. Just like last time, that same static electricity jolted out from the contact. “And now it’s returned, but we have no friggen clue why. It’s not like it started coming back as soon as Cas possessed me, it just seems to have all of a sudden… pop up again.”

Within seconds she’s racing out of their room, not feeling the slightest bit guilty for banging against Dean’s door and waking him as she went. “DEAN! SAM! I FOUND SOMETHING!”
“I was possessing a Bryde whale at the time. I was sent to check on the progression of the lands. You, as in the Homo-Sapiens, had yet to begin the major branch of your evolution path, you see. We were occasionally sent to make sure the environmental conditions were ideal for the process to begin.”
Jody frowned at that, crossing her arms across her chest as she stared them down. Typically, when the Winchesters needed to speak to you, it was either because
“Actually, I… I was worried for a moment that I had been told the wrong address and had broken into someone else’s residence. But then you were pulling a gun on me and it seemed a bit too late to ask, so I-,”
out here to find him. Admittedly, he was a little pissed to have to leave Baby behind and hike for four friggen hours in the heat whilst swiping away blood-sucking mosquitos, but it wasn’t like he had much of a choice.
"I haven't just been arguing with you. Sam and I got into a pretty bad one while in some shitty motel in Wyoming..."
"You should meet somebody," Dean quickly continues, realizing that Castiel had no idea who the person lingering nearby was. "This is Benny. Benny, this is Cas."
“Thankfully, Dean completed that requirement pretty quickly,” Sam said with a playful grin. “Do you remember, Dean, a few months ago, when I told you I was trying a new hobby? I had gotten everything set up, too; the canvas, the paints, the easel,
. And I’m telling you this now because I should have told you all those years ago. I should have told you when you told me. I love you, too. You got that?
Because that’s what it was, now. A nightmare. Now he knows his one deepest fear will become true. He’s going to lose Cas.
"What happened?" Castiel asks the second he lands, startling Sam from his crouched position on the floor.
Gabriel leaned closer, lollipop back in his mouth as he squinted at Dean’s phone, eyes rapidly moving across the screen. Dean took the widening of Gabriel’s eyes to mean he had come to the same conclusion as he had. Gabriel scrambled in his pockets for his own phone, scrolling through it for a few moments before holding it out to Dean. “And I assume this is you?”
“You got a job,” Castiel repeated once more, staring blankly up at Dean in a way that made Dean wonder if he had misjudged how Castiel would react to the news.
“I… I suppose so,” Cas answered, not sounding too sure in his answer. “If it was a recreation of Jimmy’s… of
“Whatever…” Dean grumbled under his breath, cautiously wheeling closer to the edge of the stairs. “So how we doing this? Gonna wrap me up in bubble-wrap and roll me down the stairs? Or just roll me down the stairs and hope for the best?”
“You're different, though,” Little Dean added, his voice fading away with the rest of the dream. “And that's why bigger me is so scared. You're something different to him – and he's too scared to find out what that kind of different is.”
fault. Not only had I gotten myself killed, but Cas too. And that pissed me off more than anything. I couldn’t blame that bitch Reaper for this one, or Lucifer, or Jack, or whatever. This was all on me.  And then… Cas told me about that damn deal. What he had done to save Jack.”
Sinclair let the angel's chin drop back down to his chest, turning his face back to the camera and flashing a smile. “See, here’s the thing – best thing we can do for most is to take this here-,” Sinclair gestured to the tray next to him, pointing directly to the angel blade – which likely belonged to the angel in question. “-And rid the world of one of these things… but in doing so, we create waste; somewhere hidden in there, crushed by the weight of this creature, is a human being. A devout believer tricked by this angel’s silver tongue. Some may say that they already sealed their fate when they agreed to possession… but as I said, angels can be
Sam makes quick work of the stitches, pulling the wound tight as close as he can and snipping away the ends of the thread with the kit's small pair of scissors.
Dean steps even closer. “Sammy put a tracker on your phone a long time ago, bud. Can never be too careful.”
“So we just have to find the next Death, right?” Sam said, the first signs of hope blooming in his voice.
“Yeah. I actually argued with him over it, believe it or not,” Dean shoves his hands into his jacket pockets, keeping a small amount of space between him and Cas. “Guess it turned out useful…”
“I don’t know about that…” Castiel uttered softly, finding himself falling into the endless shades of forests in Dean’s eyes. “I quite like where we’ve ended up.”
“Wanting to be with him,” Jack said. “I never really understood before... In that, I mean... When I was born, I understood what love was... I loved my mom, and I loved Cas from the moment he laid a hand on my mother’s womb. And then, as I got to know you and Sam, I knew of the love of friendship – one powerful enough to turn into family, but...” Jack paused for a moment, trying to find the right words to describe the memories in his mind. “I saw you and Sam, and I knew that was family love, like I have for my mom, and for Cas. I saw that same love between Sam and Cas, too. And all of you and Mary. Back then, when you were... you were so
“It’s not exactly the greatest of memories,” Cas snapped irritably. “It’s difficult to look back at it fondly when I was tortured and killed the morning after.”
Cas stumbles towards him, a bit of a limp in his gait, and Dean quickly makes up the short distance between them, throwing his arms around Cas and pulling the angel towards him. Cas feels real and solid pressed against his chest, and Dean thumps his hands against Cas’s back almost to prove to himself that the whole of Cas is here and intact. He almost
Castiel nodded. “Dean, do you understand what the Empty is? What happens to us? It’s… it seems almost peaceful when you think about it. To spent eternity just… sleeping. But we don’t sleep. We dream. We dream of all that we regret. For most angels and demon’s, they have only one regret; their death. What they did wrong to meet their end, tortured endlessly by that mistake. I didn’t dream of my death though, Dean. My death was no mistake. Instead, I dreamt of you. I dreamt of all the times I let you down, of all the things I should have done or said but never did. Angels aren’t supposed to do that, Dean. Those aren’t the regrets soldiers of God are meant to have.
“I should probably run after him before he mows down a nurse or something…” Sam sighed, plucking up Dean’s hospital bag from the ground and heading towards the door.

in itself was a big thing, yeah. But it was when they were stood in that dark and musty room, the smell of blood and stuff he’d rather not think about thick in the air. All three of them were covered head to toe in… whatever the hell it was exactly that shifters shed, and it had probably been the worst moment, but it was when it happened. He had still been crumpled in the corner of the room, blinking rapidly as he tried to clear his blurry vision from what would likely be
“Good point,” Eileen's eyes shifted over to the entrance of the hallway, something Dean easily spotted.
“Didn’t use to be,” Donna joked. “I used to think being the sheriff would be the most stressed I’d ever be… then came along these two idiot brothers and turned my life upside down.”
pressing his body into him, fitting together like two pieces of a puzzle that never thought the other piece would fit.
A flash again. Cas, once more, letting the tears that had been building in Dean’s eyes slip over. HE can only shake his head at Dean’s screams – that of which Sam had no doubt he was having to hear within his own mind, as he continued crawling towards
“Whilst your brother somehow managed to avoid any damage to his organs, I’m afraid the same cant be said for his spine. The rebar was pushed in between the vertebrae, just below the thoracic lumbar. As you can see, a few of the vertebrae were shattered from the impact. Unfortunately, the damage was severe enough to severe the spinal cord along with it.”
"Dean, you're in a bad state. That Djinn drained you, and it might not be long before you fade completely, especially trapped here," Castiel informs him.
“Ah… now I understand why you were so insistent on recreating his vessel when we spoke over the phone…” Sergei proclaimed, nodding his head minutely along with his own realization. “It’s about his grace, isn’t it?”
“Yes, you damn are.” Dean stated resolutely. “If I’m needed for this plan, then I need you here with me, too. That’s just how it works, Cas. So don’t you dare tell me you’re not needed. Because
Castiel genuinely looked taken aback by Dean’s sentiment, eyes locked with his, trying to assess if Dean’s lying or not. And as much as he hates to admit it, Dean finds himself getting angry again. He can’t help it. Why does Cas not see? What does he have to do for Cas to understand how much he means to him? After twelve years of non-stop apocalypses, end of the world’s and pissed off cosmic beings, with Cas
“I do,” Castiel announces, unable to resist the temptation to reach a hand forward for Dean, the small smile on his face widening as Dean’s fingers instinctively entwine with his – feeling the cold metal of Dean’s ring against his skin.
“But… you were sent to Hell…” Castiel recalls, wincing at the reminder of what Chuck had cruelly done. “Damned souls aren’t permitted into Heaven.”
“Obviously, your body needed the sleep,” Eileen commented, finishing off her last triangle of toast and placing her leftover scraps of sausages and bacon on the floor for Miracle to feast on (which she
“No,” Castiel asserted strongly. “This isn’t because of you. My grace, it… it was already fading, Dean. Coming back from the Empty, being placed in a vessel that is not mine… Your body is able to accommodate me, Dean – considering you were built with the ability to withstand an
Dean held back a groan as he wheeled back over to the seemingly never-ending pile of books stacked on the table.
there with us out in Wyoming, but... But because it feels like I haven't taken the time to just... Spend some time with you when we're not pissed at eachother"
Cas had managed to find himself a nice little dock to fish off as well. A cozy, hidden spot within the reeds, far out enough from civilization that Dean actually had to
bedroom, bringing with her a few relevant looking books and documents to read over in comfort. There’s only so long you can spend in those hard wooden chairs before your back starts screaming at you…
It wasn’t too surprising to see the medical staff wheel Dean towards the surgery ward. It also shouldn’t have been a surprise that one of the medical staff pressing a hand against his chest, stopping him from following them into surgery. Yet, he still looked down at the greying, balding man like he was insane.
The book in her lap felt like it was getting heavier and heavier, likely branding her skin with it’s raised gold letters as the minutes ticked by with the heavy block of paper sat atop legs. It wasn’t the only thing that was getting heavier; her eyelids had been fighting her resolve to stay awake for a few hours now, finding it harder and harder to fight gravity as her body shouts its protests.
"I..." Dean trailed off, the argument he was forming catching in the back of his throat, quick to die off.
Dean pats at the floor, scooping up his phone and shoving it back into his pocket. He struggles to his feet. There’s a tugging on his arm – probably Sam trying to help him up. His legs are shaking, and judging by the look on Sam’s face, he noticed it too. They don’t say anything as Dean takes his first few hesitant steps forward, pushing past them and stumbling out of the room with a few unintelligent mumbles about the bathroom. They follow him in anxious silence, quiet shadowing footsteps as Dean moves through the bunker.
no less. And it sure as hell took him some time after that to warm up to him. But somewhere along the way, this long winding journey of theirs… he had fallen for Cas.
“You’re hurt,” Castiel raises a hand to wipe away the blood from Dean’s chin, only to have his hand gently caught in mid-air by Dean’s.
Dean got the wind knocked out of him as he suddenly found himself with an armful of (still to him) angel, landing on his back with a mixture of a pained grunt at the near six-foot man landing on his ribs, and a surprised bark of laughter at said man
“Heaven, Castiel. Recently, there’s been some uh… well, let’s just say it’s not the Heaven you remember. Trust me - you’ll see what I mean when you get inside.”
bring Cas’s body back, but it’s another hypothesis? What if it goes wrong? What if it doesn’t work at all? What if messes Cas up on the transfer, especially if they need to use all of Cas’s grace for it to work, and-
“I know you feel bad for me…” Castiel said. “I know that you feel guilty for the way things were left when the Empty took me. And now, knowing that I don’t have long left… I don’t want
“You listen here…” Dean growled at him in warning. Sam began to lower his gun down to the floor, knowing Dean had complete control over the situation – even if he didn’t exactly have control over himself right now.
Dean’s thoughts are interrupted by the doctor’s prying fingers pressing against his ribs. Dean instinctively hisses at the pain – healed, but still sore- raising an arm to swat away the Doctor’s hand.
“The only way I could see you making the first move would be to kiss Cas at some random ass time, panic that you did it, and then run away,” Claire told him, counting the events on her fingers.
"He was starting to dig a little too deep, I suppose. It was making me realise things I had tried not to think about, and I lashed out at him for it"
a God. One for every galaxy.” Castiel dropped his head back down, his eyes settling on the side of Dean’s face, who still had his face craned towards the sky. His eyes dropped to the ground for a moment, the questioning burning in his mind forcing its way out of his mouth. “What are we doing here, Dean?”
“Fascinating…” The Russian drawled out, tilting his head to the side as he took Dean in. “Angels are… not usually ones to give up control so freely…”
“Hey, angel,” Dean says as he stands in front of him, holding out a hand for him to take. “Care for a dance?”
Dean and Cas watched them go with an odd sense of contentment that Claire and Jack were getting along so well… and complete and utter dread that they were getting along so
“Is that your way of saying yes?” Dean asks through the blissful smile already breaking out onto his face. He already knew the answer before he had even asked, of course (maybe there was a little part of him worried about Cas saying no, but to be fair, he’ll probably be double checking with Cas that he ‘loves’ loves him when they’re in their nineties chilling out together in rocking chairs.)
found Cas. He laughs openly in relief, not at all taking in the look of dread on Memory Cas's face as he approaches.
“I know,” Castiel utters softly in return. “I’m sorry. But If I had to, I’d do it all again. It was the only way to keep you safe.”
Instead, his back meets a wall of solid muscle. The impact sends them both tumbling back, the person behind him steadying Dean with two hands on his shoulders. Dean both feels and hears as the person hits the support beam
“That’s not for you to know yet,” Dean replied. “Or Sam and Eileen, for that matter. They’ll get to know what step two and step three is before you, though.”
Dean knows what comes of this day, of what is waiting for him; and yet, to tell this innocent child the truth… it seems unfathomably cruel to do so.
It pains Sam that there's nothing he can do. Nothing but watch as Castiels fist meets Dean's face again and again and again, fresh cuts and bruises appearing with every hit, skin being broken from the force of every punch.
Dean’s eyes widened at the realization of what Cas had given up, wide eyes darting between Cas and the ring he held in his hand. “You… you melted down your angel blade?”
In his hand was a clearly well used, well-loved mixtape, his own writing staring back at him in crudely drawn sharpie on the faded white label:
Little Dean paused, looking to him for a moment before scrambling up to his feet, leaning closer to Cas and cupping his small hands around Cas’s ears, whispering, “Big Dean is really,
Dean chuckled dryly, taking a small sip of his drink, welcoming the burning sensation that crawled down his throat.
“Lots of stuff!” Dean shot back. “We could have got me out of the hospital earlier! Sam and Eileen could have stayed put and helped us with the research instead of going on that hunt!”
“You’ve mentioned it once or twice, yeah,” Dean intended for his reply to sound as sarcastic as possible, but the smile that crept onto his face transferred over to his tone. He took another swig of his coffee, gesturing with cup in hand to the worn-down sign of the Motel. “This is the place Sam and Eileen set up camp: room number seventeen.”
Sam stuttered in his steps as he came to a stop outside Dean’s room, his gaze resting on the doors to Jack’s and Cas’s rooms. “Yeah… guess you could say that… But, so long as Cas has Dean? He has a home.”
like – brought a dusting of red to his face. “But your physical appearance is not the part of you that caught my attention.”
“…we could use Dean?” Eileen offers, half-joking, half being dead serious. “Unless… does this ‘something’ need to be sacrificed, or…?”
The new voice in the room gets everyone to jump, those with weapons tucked away pulling them out in a smooth practiced motion, training them on the unexpected newcomer. Sam’s eyes widen over his pistol’s iron sight, lowering the gun instinctively once his brain registers that the woman smirking over at them was someone he knew.
A perfectly placed stream of sunlight glints off the Impala’s sleek black metal top; not a scratch on her. He knows it's not
Kaia looked to Claire, torn between wanting to say what was on her mind, but also wanting to respect her decision. “Are you sure?”
“What did you try to do?” Cas’s eyes darted between Dean and the empty space he had been staring intensely at.
"I get what you mean," Sam emphasized, able to see the shadows of Fake Castiel and his son move around the inside of the house. "I can't believe that in all of this, Dean included
“Knew I shouldn’t have let them go…” Dean mumbled out loud around three hours into their trip, phone still held tightly in his hands. “I ignored my damn gut, and look where that got me…”
“Shut up and focus where you’re going,” Sam grunted, stepping around to the front of the chair. He took a single step back onto the first stair, leaning forward and grabbing hold of the handles near the bottom of Dean’s chair.
Dean hesitated as he looked to the defeated expression plastered on Castiel’s face, something almost akin to disappointment hiding behind hazy blue eyes as they stared down drearily at the worn wooden table. This happened a lot with them. Words he wants to say, impulsive thoughts that make it to the tip of his tongue. And every time, they get pushed back. Second thoughts, fears of pushing things too far and changing things that he’s not ready for, and then the words never make their way out. Too many times where he’s lost Cas, always certain that
It inched itself towards the trenchcoat, burrowing itself underneath the piece of clothing, from which it seemed to…
Dean’s fingers did stumble this time, slamming his hands against the strings to mute the obnoxiously loud and screeching note. Usually, he would be up in arms at this point; would tell whoever that it was all his fault, he should have been better prepared for looking after Sammy, that he should have known what to do if Dad was out on a hunt longer than usual… but looking at Castiel’s furious face, knowing such anger wasn’t aimed
she feels to find a way to save Cas, too. It’s crazy, because… well, she hasn’t known Cas for all that long. A few brief encounters with the angel here and there, in the occasional times that he dropped by in the bunker. Yet, despite that brief time… she’s come to care for the angel. Maybe it’s the brother's love for him that rubbed off on her, maybe it’s seeing Sam and Dean work themselves into a grave to find a solution; maybe it’s something as simple as Cas being a good guy, and she likes him. Either way, she’s found herself situated in this odd, dependent, multi-species family, and she’s going to do all she can to keep this family together.
his brain brought to a standstill. None of it made sense in his mind. The thought that he was Cas’s happiness, that he had somehow made an angel of the lord
"What are we waiting for?" Dean asks, enjoying that he didn't have to fight away the voice in his head that comments how damn adorable it is when Cas tilts his head like a confused puppy.
Maybe that’s why Jack had done it. Because Jack had experienced what it’s like to be one of them, to exist alongside humanity. He has rebuilt Heaven the way he thought humans
Sam picks up a box of matchsticks next to the bowl, sliding one out of the pack and quickly striking it against the side. A flame bursts into life atop the match, all three pairs of eyes in the room fixated on the little golden flickering tip.
“I don’t. Not really,” Dean replies, not even a hesitation in his playing. “At least, I haven’t actually played in a
“I’m almost impressed,’ Castiel stepped further into the room, making his way over to the bar. “Seems you’re starting to get
wait.” Castiel shoots him an inquisitive look. Dean grins brightly at him, bumping his shoulder into Cas’s. “I got my angel to keep me company. Sure, heaven ain't complete until I got Sammy, but Heaven wouldn’t be
“Oh…” Sam’s face flushes, awkwardly clearing his throat and giving his brother a disgraced glance out of the corner of his eye before continuing to read the passage.
The seconds tick by without a reply from Dean. Castiel makes up his mind, bending down to pull the laces of his shoes out of their neat loops, pulling his feet out from his shoes and lining them up neatly next to each other by the bed. He swings his legs up onto the bed, laying down lowering his head on the pillow next to Dean.
“What time do you call this?” Dean joked, putting on his best fake pissed glare, that of which immediately cracked into a joking smile.
“Can’t say I blame you for wanting your wings back,” Dean said. “Must’ve felt like you… lost some limbs…”
The white lines of the Enochian sigil painted onto the murky grey of the concrete floor seem almost blinding,
of souls would be cast back out to Earth with no way back. If that were to happen, the reapers may just have to place souls in the Empty anyway.”
Eileen twists herself around to get a glimpse of Dean, her face breaking out into a grin at the sight of him. “Not the prettiest of sleepers…”
and a boring office job, it just… I couldn’t do it. There were only three things in my life I was good at, Cas; Looking after my little brother, being a soldier, and keeping Baby working. I couldn’t make a job of the first one, my career as the second one was over, so…”
Dean felt the grip on his shoulder relax at his promise, releasing his own hold on Castiel’s arm and letting the angel's hand slip away. Immediately, he could feel the scar on his shoulder ache, keenly missing its owner’s touch.
It took a few moments for the doctors’ words to sink in. He had been expecting to hear the complete opposite, so hearing this instead had sent his brain through a loop. Dean was alive. Dean was
Castiel’s gaze slid away from Dean’s, hunching over himself on the couch, staring down at his hands in his lap and fiddling awkwardly with his fingers. “Um… no, thank you.”
“Uh, actually…” Sam begun, looking to Eileen for help. “Eileen actually kinda… found a case… while you were in the hospital.”
Before he could so, Cas caught Jack’s hand midair and pulled him into what he hoped wouldn’t be one last hug between father and son, holding him tight as he buried his head into Jack’s shoulder. “Will… Will I see you again?”
happened,” Dean gritted out, letting himself feel the anger he should have felt all those years ago. “Kept telling myself that it was only temporary, y’know? That dad would get back, get Sammy and come get me. But then… God, Cas – I was
Dean nodded his head, turning his gaze back towards the bland ceiling above. “I’ve been doing some thinking, Cas. It’s something that’s been on my mind for a while, and after Rowena… I’ve made up my mind.”
Castiel went suspiciously quiet after Dean said this, dropping his gaze back down to the whiskey bottle. Dean gave him a few seconds to pick at the corner of the label on the bottle before his patience ran thin.
“Okay…” Dean got his arms behind him, pulling himself up. It was significantly easier with Doctor Sullivan holding his legs up, gently guiding him as he pulled himself inch by inch closer to the edge of the bed. He could already feel his biceps twinging in protest with every movement, chest heaving with the exertion of pulling his entire weight.
“That was on behalf of Dean – seeing as he could never bring himself to do it,” Castiel spits coldly, glowering down at John.
Now it was Dean’s turn to be worried for Cas’s mental state. “Uh, you need a minute there, Cas? Listen, man - I get it. It takes some time to process something like this. Except, in my case, I kinda had to deal with the fact that you were
pain. They flash through his mind rapidly, forcing him to drop down on his knees, hitting the floor hard.  There
The small conversations people had fallen into tapered off, the room falling into an expectant silence as all eyes turned to Sam. Sam cleared his throat, placing the knife back down on the table but keeping the glass of champagne in his hand as he addressed the room with his best man’s speech.
Well, he signed a contract that lets him rent a shitty, musty, one-bedroom apartment that has questionable stains on the carpet and the lingering smell of weed soaked into the walls, but it’s
“Just a heads up deary, your devil's trap has been damaged. Think you might have some little micey’s nibbling away at your floorboard.” Rowena tells Jody with a sweet smile and an equally sweet-sounding voice.
Castiel could see the fight drain out of Dean, shoulders slumping, his whole posture shrinking down. Without another word, Dean slinks over to the back of the Impala, lifting up the boot.
"You know, why don't, uh, why don't Sam and I take it over to him, and you can get back to your mission?" Dean retaliates, looking slightly nervous at the way Memory Castiel advanced towards him. "Finding the other half of the Demon Tablet. That is priority, isn't it?"
“Oh, man… Now that’s…” Dean snorted again, shaking his head. “So, uh… if you knew, then… why didn’t you say anything?”
The door to his room swung open at that moment, saving Dean from any further embarrassment. Sam walked through the door, looking a fair bit more rested than he had when he left, one of their old gym bags hanging from his hand.
There was a single fishing rod cast out into the water, its little neon orange bobber oddly still despite drifting amidst the gentle waves created by the evening’s wind as it blew across the surface of the water. Strangely, there was an honest to God
“Wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t,” The answer came surprisingly easy to Dean. He should have fumbled over the words in his head, any logical part of his brain shut down as panic took over. That’s what
“Then why don’t we just play it by ear?” Dean offered, shuffling himself to the side so he was facing Cas. “Just go with it. Pretend like I live in Stanford. Maybe I’ll find a job here, maybe not, but… Hey, long-distance relationships are a thing, right? I’ve already got Sammy, but knowing you’re here? I think I’d find myself making trips over to Stanford more often than I used to.”
“You really should have let me call Jody ahead and let her know,” Sam throws at Dean over his shoulder as the sign for ‘Sioux Falls’ flashes by them.
“I thought I heard the Impala’s obnoxiously loud engine,” Jody joked, leaving the front door open a crack as she steps out into the driveway. “Where’s-,”
too many times now, he’s caught by surprise when he’s instead greeted by the click of the call connecting, and the loud silence of Cas on the other end, not speaking.
The cold top bar to the gate of the donkey's pen dug into Dean’s back, squinting against the harsh light glaring down at him from the sun. Maybe wearing a black shirt and leather jacket in this scorching Californian heat wasn’t such a good idea…
The coffee cup in Dean’s hand hovered over the trash-can. He had been about to throw it away when the sight of some smudged writing on the side of the cup caught his eye. Dean frowned, lifting the cup closer to his face for a better look. The writing had been messed up a bit, no doubt due to being held in his sweaty hands on the walk home, but he could just about make out what had been hastily scrawled onto his cup.
Memory Castiel strides towards Dean, and it's no surprise that Dean lashes out, striking Memory Cas across the chest with his knife. Of course, it doesn't phase him in the slightest, and Memory Cas flicks his wrist to send the blade flying across the room, regarding Dean with an almost amused expression,
Besides, Dean could see the true beauty the house held the first time he saw the listing. It was practically crumbling apart, its wooden sidings rotting with what was once likely a beautiful blue paint now discolored and peeling away. But the house itself was set upon a beautiful lake within a patch of woods, not too far away from the nearby town that they were “in the middle of nowhere”, but enough so that they were away from prying eyes of the stereotypical American neighborhood.
“Ow…” Dean groaned out between fits of his own muffled laughter, able to feel Castiel’s rumbling laughter vibrating against his chest. Castiel pulled his arms out from where they were pinned under Dean’s back, using them to push himself up off of Dean.
“Thought I told you you’re supposed to keep gifts,” Dean just about manages to get out, braving a look up at Cas’s retreating form.
It wasn’t enough. Another burst of blue, another moment of control by Dean. Only this time… he didn’t pull back. He wasn’t moving forward either, just laid out on the floor, gasping for breath as his sobs caught in his throat. “
One stood out, however. A shrill, piercing scream, coming from right beside them. A woman was laid out on a table, bound down with metal chains that tore into her skin as she pulled against them, desperate to get away from the knife that sliced its way through her body.
“Часть меня сожалеет, что ты не посадил меня в банановый гамак. Учитывая ваш особый фетиш в трусиках ... ваша реакция, безусловно, была бы интересной,” (Part of me regrets that you didn't put me in that banana hammock. Given your particular panty fetish ... your reaction would certainly be interesting.) Castiel’s rumbling gravelly voice oddly matched the Russian syllables that spilled from his mouth. “И я примерно на девяносто процентов уверен, что такие вещи на этой родине языков будут наказаны. Жаль, что большая часть мира еще не стала более терпимой.” (And I'm about ninety percent sure that speaking such things in this languages homeland would result in quite the punishment. It's a shame a majority of the world has yet to become more accepting.)
“We got out, but the house was burnt to nothing more than ashes and… and mom went with it. I didn’t know it at the time, but mom was practically the only thing keeping dad together. I thought… I
“Hm? Oh, nothing, nothing…” Rowena said dismissively in much too of a high-pitched, cheery voice for Dean to think it’s ‘
Dean supposed. Helping him and Sam with whatever big ugly had decided to rear its head for the year. Cas didn’t really get much free time, didn’t have much time for hobbies (neither did he unless you counted drinking and porn watching, but whatever), so of
Sam and Eileen turn to each other, matching expressions of both concern and surprise on the couple’s face.
“It’s taking shape,” Sam breaths in disbelief, pointing towards the disgusting mass on the floor. “Look!”
“Think that’s called ‘Lucid Dreaming’ or something like that,” Dean said. “Hey, wait – does that mean I can control my dreams too? Like how you did, with the changing where we are and all that.”
“You stubborn son of a bitch,” Dean grits out, balancing his phone in his lap as he massages his now sore hand. “Just gotta make this complicated, don’t you…”
He dreams of endless miles of jet black tarmac and worn road markings rumbling underneath her pristine tires. He dreams of beautiful Kansas countrysides: of rolling green fields and tall, golden crops waving gently in the evening's cool breeze as they flash by his window.
Castiel sighed, looking up to the surroundings beyond the remains of the house. The stars were disappearing from the sky, the black of night spilling out and claiming everything else. Soon, everything around them would be nothing but an endless blackness.
Dean threw open the door harder than he meant to. Though he was grateful that he did, as the shock of it meant it took Sam and Jack a few moments to realize Dean was storming down the hallway and out of sight. Sam was yelling, calling out his name again, but Dean couldn’t stop. He couldn’t
“I… I don’t understand?” Castiel is watching him warily, tiptoeing around him like prey that was about to spook. Dean understood why. He knows it’s easier to never put your hopes up, coz then that way it doesn’t hurt quite as much when they’re dashed quite so cruelly.
His plans to drag Dean from whatever he was doing and pull him into bed for a well-deserved nap was ruined when he was met with an anxious-looking Dean sat at the library table, laptop open and spilling out its harsh light into the darkness of the bunker, phone in one hand whilst he chewed incessantly at his nails on the other hand.
him Cas had let himself be taken, just so he could have a chance of getting out of there alive. A chance to take on Chuck. A chance to live.
Dean pulls away from Castiel with a weak laugh, shaking his damp hair of the rain and glancing up to Castiel with a dopey smile.
“Yes it is, you asshole,” Dean grumbled, turning from Gabriel and pulling Baby’s keys out from his pocket as he walked. “You coming or what?”
this is the first time we’re meeting face to face,” Jack replies, the kind smile on his face never once faltering. “I’m sorry, I... I don’t know sign language yet...”
"I'm sorry," Castiel apologized genuinely, recognizing just how happy Dean had been in his dream world. "I really am, Dean."
I want you at my damn wedding, kid,” Dean quickly answered, sending a quick dark glare Sam’s way for his poor choice of words. “Don’t think for a second that’s not the case. We didn’t get to send you a physical invitation since, y’know… you don’t exactly have a
Sam blearily opens his eyes, sluggishly turning his head to see Castiel slowly coming to himself, shaking his head in an attempt to shake out the remaining grogginess.
Suddenly, they're both stood inside a cozy-looking hallway of a house, Castiel still with an arm outstretched, shimmer no longer to be seen.
“Okay, well uh... we’re running out of time here. Eileen messaged me not too long ago, said Cas and Claire is ready to start heading up here and she’ll be up here herself any second-,”
“I… I suppose I didn’t consider it in that way,” Castiel confessed. “The souls in Heaven seemed happy. Content.”
“You would have loved Iraq, then.” Dean walked around to the front of the Impala, jumping up on her hood. He settled himself, turning to Castiel and patting at the empty space next to him. “Hop up, Cas.”
Rowena stops Dean's blabbers with a shake of her head. “It has to be the grace of the angel that possessed the vessel. Unless another angel possessed the vessel?”
Just as Sinclair had said, the footage shifted from grainy footage of the bunker interior to a shot of the forest outside the bunker. Atheed was still sat in the same chair, handcuffs still secured around his wrists, but now he seemed to be regaining consciousness. He was clearly out of it, eyes half-lidded as he blearily took in his surroundings, barely having enough strength to lift his head up from his chest. As usual, Sinclair was stood next to him, though this time a few steps away. The contraption was still sat snugly in his hand, that infuriating smile remaining plastered on his face. Strangely, Dean could see a few wires extending out from Atheed’s body, trailing down from his chest to the ground, connected to the contraption in Sinclair’s hand.
“He did,” Cas confirms in a rumble. “The Empty wasn’t all too fond of letting me go, at first. But Jack argued that the work we could do together would help make things a lot quieter around... well,
“For our next step, we will be moving our angel outside the bunker. If things go right, there shouldn’t be a mess to clean up, but for safety sake, this is best done outside.”
impressed?” Dean lowered the tumbler from his mouth, looking almost offended. “I managed to conjure up a whole freaking
“I heard ‘demands’ in there!” Dean pointed out. “No idea what the rest of what you said meant, but I heard demands!”
Castiel didn’t like the sound of that. Underneath his hand, he could feel Dean’s heart pounding in his chest. “Dean… what are you talking about?”
“What do you want to know?” Castiel asked, hand slipping away from Dean’s to wrap around his own bottle, leaning back in his chair and taking a refreshing sip. “I could offer you a story of my awful upbringing too if you want?”
thing about it. I avoided it, as best as I can. Kept it buried as far down as I could, because you know what? I thought that if I ignored it, it would be okay. Because there was no way in hell I could
Betty had both her twins practically attached to her legs, one of the twins (Dean had no idea who was who considering the last time he saw them was in diapers), with a thumb firmly planted in his mouth in a way that endearingly reminded him of how Sam used to do the exact same thing whenever he was nervous as a kid. The other little girl (Gertrude! Dean remembered that one) was holding onto her mother's hand, looking around the strangers -and equally strange home- with a mixture of nervousness and childlike curiosity.
Those blemishes made heaven feel... real. More human. More like... the life you always wanted to live.
Judging by the fact that Dean gets no answer upon knocking on the door – even going so far as to use their super special secret knock – even Castiel has to admit that maybe everything
Doctor Sullivan nodded at Sam, unfolding his arms with a soft sigh. “If you’re sure, then I’ll go get things ready to discharge you from the hospital, Mr. Winchester.”
whenever he let himself think those words. “I don’t know why I get so angry. I just know – I know that – I-it’s always been there. And when things go bad, it just – it comes out. And I can’t – I can’t stop it. No matter how-,” His voice catches once more. He was well past the point of holding the tears back. “-How bad I want to, I just can’t stop it.”
“Dean, you need to remember what happened last night,” Castiel insisted, taking a chance and stepping closer to Dean. “You and Sam were on a hunt. Vampire nest, by the looks of it. But something happened. Something went wrong, and you were hurt.”
“We'll do it for him,” Dean croaked out, raising a hand that wouldn’t stop trembling and placing it down on Cas's chest. “We can’t give him much, but… the least we can do is give him a proper fucking goodbye this time.”
“I don’t think it matters where we are, Dean. Your dream could take place on the Moon, and it would be all the same; so long as you’re with me.”
“And I got better,” Castiel assured him. “I… I wanted to return to you, first. But Jack needed my help, and when he told me his plan… I knew I would be of better use up here. Turning Heaven into a place you deserved to rest for eternity. The least of what you and your brother deserve.”
Dean smirked at the genuine annoyance and frustration in Castiel’s tone, taking a little too much pleasure in denying Castiel of his request.
“Yeah… just got to find a way to recreate a body that belongs to an angel which was destroyed by a being older than God himself. Sounds easy…”
“Maybe Dean’s just good at forming ‘profound bonds’ with strays.” Eileen shot him a joking smile, giving Miracle one last scratch behind the ears before standing up.
Rowena sighs deeply, looking down drearily to the empty tumbler in her hands. “Come on then; tell me the story.”
“Right…” Dean mumbled, casting his eyes down to his plate. The few remaining fries on his plate didn’t seem quite as appetizing anymore. Sam looked uncomfortable to be part of this conversation, mostly because Castiel’s answer was one he was expecting.
“We’ll figure it out,” Eileen reassured him with an understanding smile. “Right now, your brother needs you.”
Dean watched him with a soft smile, his eyes dropping down to his cup and taking another sip. Dean was content to sit here all morning, sippin’ on his coffee, contemplating his life, and watching Cas’s endearing change of facial expressions as he read his book. More often than not, Dean would be woken up by Cas’s incessant poking, looking over groggily to Cas as he excitedly babbled on about whatever it was he had just read in his book of the week, ignoring the fact that it was
Cas let out another breathy laugh at that. Staring out to the mountains, he stepped forward towards the lake, crouching down by the shore and running his fingers through the shore’s sand. It was clumpy, sticking to his hand in a mixture of lake-bed soil and grains wettened by the murky water. It was nothing like the soft sands of Dean’s…
Cas would probably chalk it up to the shock of Dean's sudden mood change as to why he let Dean push himself away so quickly, taking a moment to let his words sink in. At first, he feels confusion at Dean's words, a confusion which quickly turns to anger as he looks at Dean's retreating form, slinking away out of the room.
“Because of Jack,” Castiel replied. “His powers meant I had come to in the Empty within the vessel I was possessing. This time… you saw what the Empty did to me as it took me. It broke me apart, atom by atom until I became… nothing. Nothing but Empty.”
“Ah, the Winchesters!” Doctor Sullivan exclaimed at the sight of them, gently closing the door behind him. “How’s my miracle patient doing?”
say was that he held onto that anger for too long. That he didn’t stop for a moment to look at things the way Cas probably did. Instead, he only saw things the way his anger wanted to, to keep him steeped in that burning rage, letting himself lash out at Cas because it was easy. Because he’d put the blame on Cas so many times before, so why not do it again?
“Oh…” Dean cleared his throat awkwardly, subconsciously leaning away, putting a little bit of extra distance between him and Cas. “So… My prayer woke you up?”
“I call it being fashionably late,” Rowena fired back, her eyes sliding over to Sam and Eileen next to Dean. “You clean up well, Samuel.”
Most of the other parents and kids had been keeping a respectable distance from him, so the sound of approaching footsteps startled him so badly he nearly dropped his phone. Hastily stuffing his phone back into his pocket, Dean looked up to see who was behind the hastily approaching footsteps.
Castiel said sternly, the harshness in his tone making everyone in the room startle at the reminder of the powerful angel in their presence. Castiel knew what Sam was getting at. He knew what this was leading to.
“If you want to… you can finally rest. You can stay here, in Heaven. Live in peace, with no pain and no worries, surrounded by those you love. And… if you wanted to, you could help me.”
“I know we will. It’s just… it’s always something, you know? With what happened to Dean, and now… now we’ve gotta fix Cas, too…”
“Yeah, Cas. You. I love you. I love the way you’re always trying to do the right thing. I love how you were willing to turn your back on your family, to help a couple of idiot brothers save humanity. I love how you became a part of
He was perfectly content with showing Cas the classics: Tombstone, The Shining, Star Wars, Star Trek, Back To The Future, Ghost Busters. You know,
"You made the right call. You had a hunch there was something up, and you followed up on it. Hell of alot better being wrong this way, then walking away from a case that's actually
It had simply… let them go. Like Jack was its property. And now, it had claimed Cas. But it would only take Cas once he was happy.
Dean knocked his glass out of the way with the back of his hand, letting it slide across the table until it bumped against the wall. Dean leaned further forward against the table, his arms crossed underneath him as he stared directly into Cas’s eyes. “The Empty’s wrong. You
smart, but the poor kid isn’t even at some schools for more than two weeks! He wanted to make friends so bad, but why bother when you know you’re gonna be moving on soon.”
“Hmm. Sure.” Castiel hummed in that obnoxiously higher-pitched tone that shows he doesn’t agree with Dean in the slightest.
“Dean!” Sam exclaims, rushing to Dean’s side and dropping down hard on his knees next to him. The medkit is discarded to the side as he quickly shoves his fingers down Dean’s collar, pressing them into his throat.
Jimmy sighs deeply at Castiel's insistence on kicking himself while he’s down. “She still had a father, Castiel. Sure, it took you a while, but you got there eventually. Buying her embarrassing birthday presents that she secretly loves? That's what a
Cas almost looked like he was going to laugh. Perhaps because this should have been blatantly obvious from the start. Perhaps because Dean shouldn’t have even had to ask.
“That’s not-,” Dean tries, but Cas has already turned his back to him; hurriedly picking his fishing rod back up and began disassembling it. “I’m
Nearly everyone in the room looked uneasy at Sam’s plan. Hell, even Sam didn’t look like he liked his own suggestion, but mostly… it was a look of desperation, of understanding, patiently waiting when you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for the answer. Claire got to take this all in, along with Dean’s – or Cas’s, she supposed – conflicted grimace, unable to meet her eyes.
Dean huffs out a laugh at the imaginary scenario playing out in his head, the subtle curl of his lips enough for Castiel’s heart to feel ten times lighter in his chest. “You’d probably have to grab hold of my damn wheelchair to stop me going out there… we’d yell at each other about what I can and can’t do; I’d tell you you’re not my damn babysitter, you’d tell me to stop being such an ass and listen for once…”
Cas’s curious look only grew more intense. Dean could practically see the gears turning in the angel's head, trying to figure out what Dean was suggesting. There was a split second shift to his expression, one Dean could only describe as disbelief before Cas had schooled his expression back to neutral. Castiel had apparently figured out what he had forgotten as he moved towards him, and Dean pulled his hand out of his pocket, ready to pass the keys over to Cas.
There's a giant pause, nothing but the sound of dead air from the other end, and he can only imagine Sam is trying his hardest to hold in any insults he might have.
Dean’s movement was synchronized with Gabriel’s, immediately turning and leaning their foreheads against the window, placing their hands around the sides of their faces to get a better look inside.
Now the concrete walls of the bunker surrounded him, seemingly teleported into the central area of the bunker. Castiel stood awkwardly by the map table, keeping an apprehensive eye on Dean.
about that, that pushed the tears that had been building out from the creases of his lids and spill down the angels face, catching in the maze of stubble that was lightly brushed across his cheeks.
Dean was content to just sit here, leaning against the counter and watch Cas as he dashed between machines that, Dean supposed, made coffee- though which did what, he had no clue. A few seconds later the previously mentioned brother, Gabriel, appeared at Castiel’s side, and the two appeared to enter a heated, whispered discussion. Turning to his side, the care-free smile on Dean’s face slipped away as he glanced over to Sam and took in that knowing look, complete with raised eyebrows and all. Dean felt his traitorous face flush in response, and he instantly sent a glare in his little brothers’ direction and mouthed ‘
“Sometimes. Eventually, Sam offered an olive branch- He asked me if I wanted to come and visit and I agreed, but… I just haven’t found a reason to settle yet. Until then, I guess I’m just… roaming.”
“Maybe,” Sam admitted, jumping slightly when his toast popped out of the toaster – never fails to get him… “
“You should see her with Dean,” Sam gracefully stood back up, stretching out his back until it popped – his age really was starting to catch up with him. “You think she’s loving with us? You haven’t seen anything until you see her fawning over Dean.”
