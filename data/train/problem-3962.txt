I gather up my towel and fresh clothing, and shuffles into the small room. Locking the door behind me, I shrug off my oversized sweater and my long sleeve shirt, peeling the slacks and underwear off next. I try to avoid looking in the mirror, something I had done for years.
I continue to remain silent, knawing on the inside of my cheek in an attempt to resist. His cool fingers press just between my shoulder blades, sliding down in a painfully slow motion. He could see my wings, I knew he could. Much like any demon, although they appear as nothing more than a slight shift in reality, a spark of grace, he knew where they were. His fingers glide down the invisible base, tracing almost expertly along the root of my dowry feathers and I feel my knees grow weak.
I turn around and she has the goofiest smile on her face, bending down as she starts to mold up another snowball.
Piling into Baby, I turn on his Cassette; knowing he loved every track that I put on it. The first song breaks the silence; Achilles Last Stand by Led Zeppelin. I roll down my window, starting her up with a roar as Cas sings along to the song quietly.
“Dean took one of them.” I breath out, my fingers dropping back to the romance novel in front of me. My fingers curl around the cover, flicking my digits over the pages. A feeling of hope fills my heart, the warmth spreading through my veins like fire. Maybe now that he was studying sexuality there might be a chance for me.
I stop in my tracks, looking up at him with raised eyebrows. The book was in greyscale, a lustrous looking woman with red lips on the cover.
He doesn’t go anywhere in particular, flittering from place to place in an attempt of feeling some comfort. Any solace from the fact that his world is crumbling around him, his faith now suffocating him and constricting his vessel.
“Strip.” My voice is low, rumbling from my chest and a smirk plays on his lips. His fingers slide up to start unbuttoning his shirt, my eyes devouring each inch of skin he reveals. My eyes trail down, my tongue darting out from between my slightly parted lips as he slides the fabric from his broad shoulders. I gently pat my inner thighs, my eyeline trained on the happy trail that disappears beneath his low riding jeans.
The pads of her fingers trace mindlessly over my sensitive skin, a feeling of domestic affection washing over me. They were mindless patterns, but enough to have me sigh in bliss.
“I don’t want to be a burden to you and Sam, I wish to contribute. More than I do. Be more involved in any way that I can.” I nod, my mind set.
“Jensen is beautiful and charming.” She murmurs, surprising me as my eyes snap open to look at her properly, “But underneath that killer smile is so much pain and loneliness. Castiel, he is so lost in his own perdition. You must grip him and raise him from his own turmoil like Gabriel did for you.”
“Gabby...” My voice is soft as I reach up and brushes a strand of curled hair from her cheek, “We, well for certain I am, completely exhausted. It’s nice to just take a day. There is always tomorrow.” I tell her and I could tell she visibly relaxes.
“I can’t tell you that. If I do, doesn’t that mean it won’t come true?” He quips, his frosted blue eyes meeting mine.
I feel my heart beat a little faster, a silly smile on my lips as I slide down in my seat. Watching humans over the centuries had become mundane. A repetition throughout history. Similar love stories, the same acts again and again. But there was something about romance novels that make it all feel new again.
I watch him in intrigue, holding my hand mere inches above his lips as I watch the blood drip from my palm and into his mouth. The glow doesn’t fade, even as he laps up what I have to offer.
“That toaster is a ridiculous contraption. Why on earth would it pop out so unexpectedly like that? They should really think about a timer.” I huff, remembering how I had almost blown up the kitchen in absolute surprise after watching the toaster too intently and the bread popping up without warning.
“I just don’t want to have to call an ambulance and explain to your brother that I let you freeze and become a popsicle.” She huffs, looking up at me.
Closing her eyes, she draws in a deep breath. I wait, knowing that patience is not one of her virtues and I would need to give her time to calm down. Drawing in a few more slow breaths, she places her chopsticks down and pushes away her food. Lacing her manicured nails together, she rests her wrists on the table and finally makes eye contact.
Stepping forward, he closed the gap between him and the hunter. Lips on lips, both frozen for a moment in shock. Dean is the first to react, carding his fingers through the angels’ hair and tugging him impossibly close. With parted lips it became a flurry of unsure hands and broken kisses; unclear feelings and clouded judgement. They both are clinging to something solid in the hopes of filling a broken part of themselves. It became a struggle to find what they were searching for in a place where it wouldn’t be found. The shared intimacy feels empty, meaningless in place of where it should have been passionate and full of something other than broken dreams and crushed souls.
It was only a glimmer of hope before I shake it away. It was a useless, humanly desire. To waste their money on such trivial things. Perhaps I should get Dean to teach me how to hustle like they do so I could contribute to the household as well. Zipping up my bag, I leave it just outside the kitchen to relieve Sam so he could go pack for himself.
“Good boy. Now suck.” He demanded, pushing his clothed cock towards my face. I probably would have teased and maybe denied a little more had I not been so incredibly horny.
“Dean, it’s fine.” I respond, my voice firm. It is the truth, despite it’s obvious intent to begin with.
The bus ride is a little longer than usual and as the sun begins to set and the street lamps flicker on, I become a little more alert of my approaching stop. Pushing the buzzer, I climb from the bus and steps out onto the side walk. Burrowing tighter into my coat, I walk quickly towards the skyrise on the corner of the block.
“Some of this looks really interesting. Especially this one.” He begins to flip through the pages of a rather thick book called; Exploring human sexuality.
“You deserve to be happy.” I tell him, leaning forward, resting my elbows on my knees as his eyes downcast to stare at the yellowing carpet.
“Are you ready?” She asks, eyes clouded with worry but I do my best to push away my insecurity, nodding briskly; “Yes Mistress.”
I felt my heart flutter a little as I recall Sam's words from earlier, there could be that one person who could change your mind. I clear my throat a little, my eyebrows knitting together in a frown.
I decide to give in, my fingers not shifting from his hips as I plow into him. He grips desperately onto Crowley’s thighs, trying to steady himself but the king is enjoying it as much as I qm, using and abusing his mouth in whatever way he desires. I twist my grace, the synapsis tingling along Deans’ cock as he lets out a loud whine of pleasure.
“It wasn’t a suggestion, Castiel. Try it.” My voice was a little firmer and he clicked his tongue. It was the first flash of the much harder, sarcastic Cas I knew him to be underneath his polite exterior. It was always niceties at first but I saw his little smirks and snickers at my comments I would make to others.
I become distracted by her almost instantaneously, the subtle crinkle of her nose in concentration and slight pout on her lips remind me of
“You don’t live around here, do you Samuel? Is it just you, your brother and Castiel?” She inquires and I nod in response.
“I feel dead though.” I let out a sigh, my head rolling back onto the pillow as a dizzy sensation washes over me.
“Really?” I seem genuinely surprised, considering how young he looks. Barely out of high school to say the very least. What is more surprising is the fact he was lumped in a room with a first year like me.
“Yes. He thought it was amusing I picked you but agreed to a meeting.” I feel my stomach drop and my body flush heatedly, “Castiel. I was truthful about his first impressions of you as I did not want you to think I was leading you into this blindly. He is tough, but you are tougher. I know you are.” She holds out her hand and I suck a breath, reaching over to lace my fingers with hers.
“Dean.” His voice is firm and when I meet his eyes, it conveys all his emotion with ease. He is right, as always. I have no right to get angry after the way I rejected him yesterday.
“Thought you might want to see what your little demonic toy has gotten up to.” My fingernails claw down his spine, his head rolling back in a silent moan as I brush over his wings.
I had no idea what I was going to say to either of them. For all I cared, they could both disappear and leave me to wallow in self-pity. But the hurt that tugged at my heartstrings is what stopped me from being so angry. It wasn’t Sam's fault. He was right. I had spent the last ten years in complete denial of my attraction towards Cas. Finally, I was coming to terms with it when I decide to act like a complete asshole and prance around like a show pony in front of other hunters. The look on his face when I suggested he go pick up the waitress was soul crushing.
Dean watches as Cas moves into the entry way, eyes drifting to the ceiling. His jaw clenches, his face portraying all the anger, hurt and absolute devastation as he speaks; “You son of a bitch. I believed in...”
I slide into the backseat of the cab, settling beside the angel who had seen to pressing himself against the opposing door in a quiet rage. I murmur out the address of the motel to the cab driver before clicking my belt on. I sit awkwardly in the intense silence for a few moments before breaking the tension.
I pat myself down, trying not to stare as he pulls his clothes on. When the warmth of my jacket finally stops my shaking, I brush my fingers through my hair to smooth it out.
“Is it stupid to keep holding out hope for him?” He asks, looking up at me. I hesitate. Over the years, my answer had always been no but considering how long Deans’ stubborn behavior and inability to change has lingered despite me trying to make him see what was right in front of him. In this moment, I couldn’t help but let out a soft “maybe”.
It feels so much different than the night before. I could wipe away those tears and hold her close. But these are so intense I could feel fear radiating from her body as she curls into her pillow. I am so stunned that it takes me a moment to react. I am in complete shock; my heart drops and I feel my blood run cold.
We stay that way for the rest of the trip. The cool day that was previously sunny is now threatening with grey clouds and cold winds as the hours tick by. I pull into the almost empty parking lot. He leans down to slide off his scuffed dress shoes and rolls up the end of his slacks. I follow his lead, stepping out of the car as he hesitantly slides out, stepping from the concrete to the greyish sand. I shrug on my jacket, crossing my arms to block out the gush of window.
“Now...” Her fingers smooth over the crinkled plastic, clicking out the bound clump of paper with a swift movement. “Tell me what you know about Michaels’ pets. Considering your brash reaction, I assume you have heard the worst of it.”
Filling him to the brim and I let myself ride out my orgasm slowly. I pull out, collapsing onto the wooden floor next to him. I pant, trying to catch my breath and without any sense of warning, he climbs up onto my waist and settles his ass down onto my hips. His dark eyes devouring mine as he traces patterns on my chest.
“I have been so proud of your progress over the last few years and I believe you are now strong enough to handle standing on your own in a relationship. He is a good fit for you.” She breathes out.
The angel snaps out of whatever daze he was in, nodding his head in apology. His eyes remain level, clasping his hands under the table.
“Fine.” He shrugs, turning to face me and that’s when he dawns on him, “Oh, you mean this is because of our sexual exploits? You weak fuck.” He smirks but I notice a hint of relief in his expression. “Perhaps we keep it blood free for you next time, Angel. But that grace of yours, I am not giving up. I expect more next time.” He clicks his tongue, clearly amused.
The way he holds himself is so sure, so confident within himself. He slides the belt from his waist, eyes still locked with mine. He seems full of curiosity, his eyes searching mine for answers I wasn’t sure I had. I couldn’t explain it, the way he makes me feel.
“Alright, let’s begin with something basic, yeah? How to fill up the coolant.” He responds, pointing towards a green bottle only a few feet from where I was standing. I reach over, taking a hold of the bottle and cracks open the lid.
He tugs up his pants, fixing up his jumbled uniform and smooths out the creases from his already crisp uniform.
“Well, Cas doesn’t need to sleep, right buddy?” Hearing my name, I turn to look at the brothers who were staring at me.
“I absolutely must have this!” She keeps the bunny beanie on her head, now much happier as she helps me load my stuff into the trolley before making our way to electronics.
He looks sinful. His lips are tight, cheeks hollowed like he had done this countless times before. His fingers slide over my thighs desperately, nails digging and threatening to break skin. I couldn’t take it. The heat of his mouth, the constrict of his lips and the pooling warmth in my lower stomach. I want control, I want it now.
I step under the streaming water, letting the hot water sear my skin and relax every muscle in my body. The steam curls around the room, frosting the glass as I drop my head under the water. It is nice, to just... be.
“It sounds like you both were using each other for selfish reasons.” She states and I swear my jaw could have hit the floor. There was no simplicity or careful honesty, she was just blunt.
“Cas’ birthday?” He inquires and I realize I didn’t tell him that I gave Cas a birthday, so I give him a brief rundown from the experience at the library and when he finally stops teasing me for being sentimental, he goes silent for a moment.
“I don’t know what you want me to tell you, Dean,” Cas tsks, blue eyes blazing, “This has been set in motion well before my very existence. It is what it is.”
This was probably the most awkward dinner to ever have occurred. Silence and tension hangs over our table like a gloomy cloud. I nudge Cas under the table with my foot to get him to stop glaring at them like he was trying to read their soul and thoughts.
The shopping trip is a rather long one considering it was just to get a new set of clothes for the night ahead. Gabriel is as lavish on the inside as she is on the outside. She works hard and loves to pamper the people around her, but also loves her fair share of beautiful things.
As if reading my mind, a smile plays on her lips; “As much as I would love to stay here all day, I promised you a fun trip.”
“Cas that was-” He pants against me, looking up at me through the darkness of the room and I give him a dreamy smile. “Fucking amazing?”
“I think its noble of you to defend your brother even when he is being an ass.” He responds and I snort, nudging him gently with my shoulder.
“When you see something extraordinary, if you are taking photos, are you really experiencing it?” She asks, swaying a little on her feet as she brushes the off the snowflakes that cling to her lashes.
“Nu-uh, you need some cheering up Sambo.” She click her tongue, shooting me a brighter smile if that was even possible.
“Do you have feelings for this, Castiel?” She inquires, dropping her spoon into the black liquid, swirling it around slowly as she rolls the lollipop between her fingers with her free hand. Pulling the sugar stick from her lips with a soft pop, she places it aside.
“I just, I was worried. I didn’t know you two were a couple. It was a surprise.” I murmur, the lie slipping out easier than I thought it would as I poke at my bacon, the pile of grease now unappealing.
“Cas, maybe-” I stop for a second, gathering my thoughts as he slides off his trench coat and sits on the opposing bed facing me, “Maybe you should move on.”
Considering he only ever came to me for sex, it is a complete shock but I am not complaining. I sit up a little, tilting his chin down and presses my lips to his. I expect him to pull away but instead he melts under my touch.
“Uh, just a bit of everything. In between jobs at the moment.” I answer and she shoots me a side glance.
“Dude. This is as far as I go. My johnson is gonna go blue and fall off, I’m not puttin’ my nipples through that as well.” I pull a face and makes it clear with a wave of my hand that I’m stubbornly going to stay put.
“Fuck me-” He snaps, voice harsh and I immediately withdraw my finger. If he isn’t going to behave, he doesn’t reap the benefits.
“I have fought thousands of battles, I’m sure a vampire nest is not really going to be a challenge.” I quirk a brow, watching his expression as he rolls his eyes dramatically.
I was now three hours into my trip and the twitch in my upper lip has gotten worse and I am sulking around, shoulders hunched and a pout on my lips. Shopping is really not my thing.
“No way! That is awesome, man.” I clap him on the shoulder and he jumps a little bit, clearly missing the puns involved.
It made me smile to think of a world away from hunting. But this was my life, I couldn’t just walk away. She watches me curiously, tilting her head ever so slightly as she taps the raspberry lollipop on her bottom lip thoughtfully.
She reaches out and laces her fingers with mine, giving it a gentle squeeze, “How do you know that the bond you share with him is unique? How do you know there is no one else in the world who would not love you the way you deserve?” I bite the tip of my tongue.
I was utterly confused and it must have shown because the hunter sat up, squeezing his grip a little tighter around my neck. My breath quickened, reaching up to pull his hand away but he easy caught my wrists and pinned them down above my head.
“No. Um… it’s fine.” He waves his hands and busies himself with another task before I have a chance to argue my point.
I found that love is trust. Strength. Admiration. Dedication. It’s lingering glances, fingers brushing over the back of another's hand. Its pain. Torture. Tears. Full of heartbreak. It’s seeing the absolute worse in someone else and still willing to sacrifice your very soul for them. It’s holding on even when they push you away. Love is... Dean Winchester.
The opposing males remain silent, still glaring at each of us individually before with a finality, Dan finally spoke in a gravelly voice; “I’m going to wait in the car. 10 minutes, or we will leave without you.” He leaves the table behind as Brent shoves the last of his fries in his mouth, following his friends lead.
I didn’t even hesitate as I lean forward and brushes my tongue over the skin, lapping up the cream from the corner of his lips. I felt his body tense, his hands finding his way to my chest to gently push me away. Had I perhaps misread this whole situation? Was I so self-absorbed that-
“Great job, man.” He encourages, giving me a small pat on the arm. I can’t help as a smile stretches over my lips.
It doesn’t take me long to slip into my mind and to go to the place I feel safest. After the chaos the night ensued, I just needed a break away for a while.
“I am. Not law though, I am studying Psychology.” I shuffle to my mattress, plopping down on the edge of the bed and forces myself to stop grinding my teeth habitually.
Despite his fascination, faith was still his priority. To serve under heavens’ rule, to blindly follow as a solider would. Without hesitation and to the death if necessary. So when the first flicker of doubt arose within himself, it felt impossible. Could it really be that he had spent his life serving to no end?
“Mistress?” I murmur softly and she lets out a gentle hum in response, brushing her nails through my hair. I melt instantly under her gentle touch, loving the feeling of someone playing with my hair. “Have you met Jensen before?” I ask quietly.
“My my...and what do we have here?” A low drawl slips from Crowley's lips as he appears in the corner of the room. Scotch in hand, an amused look clouded by lust for what looks to be for Dean who was silently begging for more; rolling his hips longingly against the sheets as an attempt at relief.
“Patience is a virtue, Dean.” He breathes out. Cheeky shit. I knew he must have been playing up that innocent act but this was like a complete 180 of his usual character. The way he held himself had shifted, his voice firm with a confidence that I had never seen before.
I pull into the car park, turning off the impala with a soft click. Climbing out, I adjust my jacket and ruffles out my hair. I rarely came to the library, this was really more of Sam's thing. But the look on Cas’ face was so worth it. He looked like I had just taken him to Disney land. I almost had to jog to keep up with his fast pace as he made a beeline to the entrance.
I never got over mourning him. I still carried him with a heavy heart each day, despite the fact I thought that by gathering intimacy from strangers and Cas, it would somehow fill the hole he left behind.
The loud thunder clapped and I finally caught a glimpse of him under the flash of lightning; flannel shirt, dirt crusted jeans and boots. But his eyes.
“Tsk. No way to talk to your lover.” He tsks, clearly still amused as he slides his hands into the back pockets of his jeans.
“Sammy~” She gestures for me to follow her into the store and my attention is drawn back from the overcast clouds. Greeted by a flush of warmth, I feel my teeth chattering come to a halt and relief flood my bones as we step inside the store. We are acknowledged by a few bored, dead eyed employees as we make our way to the men's section.
“Have you heard anything from Sam?” He asks, breaking the silence and I was glad he did or else I was probably going to become more awkward the longer dinner went on.
“A few. Just one night stands really, to try it out.” I answer honestly and she lets out a hum of affirmation, closing the topic as not to pry.
“Stand.” She tells me and without a second thought I am back on my feet. She pulls her hair over her shoulder, the curls falling delicately down to her waist. I reach forward, gently pulling the zipper down from the base of her neck to her hips. She shimmies out of the business attire, standing in only her black underwear. She passes me the discarded silk dress expectantly and I bow my head.
“No, rather demon blood.” I breath out, clicking my tongue as the smell clicks into place, “It’s hunters. My apologies.”
“It’s such a human thing to have.” He speaks, a small smile on his lips. With each passing day I noticed his grace fade a little more as he became more and more human. He had gone from a puzzled angel to a man wanting to learn and just fit in. It really was inspiring.
The memory that settled clear in my mind like a punch in the gut was Cas laying almost on top of Sam. Feeling bile rising up in my throat, I rush to the bathroom and throw up the contents of last night's binge into the toilet. I wipe the remnants from my bottom lip, deciding that perhaps a shower will help calm and sober me a little more. I turn the heat on full blast, stripping out of my jeans and loose fit shirt. I step into the shower, closing the curtain and shoves my head under the rush of water. It was loud in my ears and much too bright but I knew I would have a long drive home today and I wanted to cure myself of this hangover as soon as possible.
“No. But it is one of my favorite songs to sing, it harbors such a powerful message, don’t you agree?” He looks up at me through dark lashes, “Hey, I have got to run or I will be late but uh-” He quirks a small smile, pulling a pen from god knows where.
I heard a gentle tap on the bathroom door, my eyes opening. “Yeah?” I call out and for a moment it was complete silence. I thought maybe they had gone away but then I heard a soft voice that made my heart clench a little.
“Ugh. Where have you been man? I have been trying to contact you for days.” I scowl, placing the petite plant back on the shelf.
“Cas-” The moment my name leaves his lips I draw in a ragged breath. I can’t keep coddling him. I want to be happy, and feel loved but with his broken idea of what it should be I couldn’t stand to hear another word.
I tell myself, reaching for my toothbrush. I get rid of the sour taste that had lingered and created a thick film on my teeth before making my way back to the bedroom to look for fresh clothes to wear.
“One more stop and then we can go home, Cas.” I tell him, a mischievous smile crawling over my lips.
It places me in their shoes for a short time. I have spent my life wondering what love feels like. It wasn’t what I had expected at all. In romance novels it came in the most unexpected flashes, like a bullet to the chest. It was fireworks and magic in movies. But this certainly wasn’t the case.
“How do you know that they aren’t using you? Or going to hurt you?” I fire out insensitive questions that earns me a glare.
“Alright, Sambo?” She asks, driving well under the speed limit as snow pelts down on the glass windows, her wipers at a leisurely speed to clean off the soft powder.
As the glass begins to frost and the steam has soothed my aching joints, I let out a relaxed sigh. Turning off the shower, I climb out and wraps a fresh towel around my waist. I lean forward, brushing my palm over the fogged mirror and wipe it clear. My blue eyes meet green and I freeze.
I let out a sigh, “Just have some damn pie.” I insist, taking up a bit on my fork as I hold it out for him.
“All worn out?” I grin, “You better let me finish, Dean.” I tsk and the demon rolls onto his stomach with a second of hesitation. He shakily pulls himself up onto all fours, spreading his legs invitingly.
“Everything.” I laugh, thinking back to the times I have caught him staring at the TV in complete intrigue despite the lack of content.
The car ride home is silent. I barely get anything more than a peep out of Cas. The moment we arrive back to the bunker, he is out of the car within seconds and holes himself up in his room. I have no clue how I am going to make it up to him. I tried to accept them, he got angry. I apologize and he storms off. Maybe it would be better to scream and fight, then at least I would get an answer from him.
The rest of the day goes by in a blur. We grab coffee at the café and warm up before heading to the gift store. She convinces me to get a few postcards to remember the day. As the sun begins to set, we find a motel nearby to stay at for the night before we head to Vegas in the morning.
“Enjoying it without me?” I hear a gravelly voice, masked by a smirk as I squint through the glass shutter to make out Dean’s outline.
“I think it’s just my blatant stupidity towards family loyalty to be honest.” I respond and the cab pulls to a halt. I dig around in my pocket and passes the driver cash. Slipping from the car, I stretch out my long limbs and shivers slightly from the settling cold. I feel Cas’ hand slip into mine yet again, his shoulders slightly slumped.
She nods in thought, remaining uncharacteristically quiet as begins dumping armfuls of candy into the cart.
Legs spread, ass up. Possibly my favorite position for the demon. His hole clenching desperately around air, face buried deep into the mattress as he whines for contact. His hands twist in the sheets, his hips swaying for attention.
“Is it really me though, Gabby?” I exasperate and she rolls her eyes, waving her hands with disdain, “No, but you look hot.” She counters. With my bracelet now tucked safely in my pocket, we were back to the usual banter of old friends.
“Alright, alright.” He holds his palms up a little, a smirk on his lips as he brushes past me, “But I have seen you try and work a toaster. No touching the car, comprende?” He pops the hood, his face lighting up. Every time he spoke about his car or was about to, he would look like a kid again. This car means absolutely everything to him. Of course I would be careful.
But for whatever reason, this girl didn’t have those intentions. She seemed genuinely concerned about me heading home in this state.
“It's fine, really. I think you are right, I need to stay away for a while.” I nod, letting out a defeated sigh, “I guess I could just hang around the area?”
“I’m getting a toothache just looking at all this stuff.” I mutter, trying to pick up more substantial items along the way that are not coated in glucose and sugar.
I felt my pants tighten a little. Fuck, he was so gorgeous and that noise, I could listen to it on repeat all day.
“Oh yes my sweet boy, but you know what’s better than one filthy slut?” I breath out, grinding my hardened cock against his ass as he lets out a low whine, “two.”
I cut her off, despite how out of line it is; “Michael?! Are you kidding me?” My eyes widen and her jaw tighten.
“Well, yeah.”  I frown a little, wondering where she is going with this and how this justifies kidnapping my phone.
“Retrieve your book for me. Whilst I read, you can order dinner for us.” She waves me off and I slip from the room. I scoop up my discarded bag, pulling out my thick binder and my cell phone to make the call. I return to the room and places the binder carefully on her bed.
I trail behind, waiting patiently beside him as he signs up for a library card. He insists on using Winchester as his last name through a softly spoken argument we had in front of the puzzled librarian.
for attention. Silently begging for relief as he gags on Crowley's cock and desperately rocks back against my hardened rod. I hold his hips down; relishing in his gagging and sloppy moans as his body gives way while he tries to comply to my erotic whim.
“Sam. I can hear your brain ticking over into overdrive. Focus on now.” She reminds me softly, her eyes meeting mine and I smile sheepishly. I nod, giving her hand an affectionate squeeze.
“Sam-” He breaths out gently as he leans in and wraps his arms around my neck, resting his head on my shoulder. I slide to sit beside him, pulling him closer into my arms. My fingers move to gently rub along his back comfortingly. As a group, we hardly ever cried. Cas had always been the most stoic of all of us but I could tell this really devastated him. His last string of hope he had been desperately clinging to was now gone.
“Number 5. If you would indulge me, Mistress.” A sly smile crosses over her lips as she picks up the perfume of my choice, “Always something masculine. Not that I mind.” She sprays it on her skin as I begin to work on a tight braid from the top of her head.
“Cas, did you just say Demons?” Dean asks in a hushed tone, moving forth to take a hold of my upper arm. I continue focusing, tilting my head a little in confusion.
“You’re awake.” He responds softly, his dark eyes shifting to look down at me. I shouldn’t have been, considering the circumstances, but I was immediately aroused.
He moans louder, the grip on his shaft tightening. With a final cry, his hot seed shoots over his stomach and coats his skin. I pull my fingers out, a satisfied smile playing on my lips.
My brows furrow, hugging her protectively against me. I couldn’t imagine what it must be like. It was scary for me to watch but to actually
I just nod, my jaw clenching a little and curls into her warmth. It was comforting, but not what I was craving. I wanted a firm chest, strong arms and the musky scent of a man.
Loading up the food onto the conveyor, the process was quick as they scan through our items. Sam pays as I pack it all back up into the trolley. We trek back outside and through the wet slush to the Impala. It begins to lightly drizzle, enough to soak through to my socks as I finish loading up the trunk of the car. With a look of distaste, I use my grace to dry them again.
He cradles the small plant in his left hand and with his right, an invisible grace curls over the leaves making them lush and vibrant as he drags his fingers over the stem. His eyes glow with absolute joy and I couldn’t help the slight, giddy flush that crawls over my cheeks.
“Sorry, I’m Sam, you must be my new roommate.” The stranger climbs off the rickety bed, hand outstretched.
I don’t say anything, allowing her words to settle and resonate. We sit in silence, her eyes still clouded as I watch her silently. I brush my thumb gently over the back of her hand, trying to comfort her as much as I could with the table between us.
“And what does the demon have in mind?” I pant softly, rolling my hips forward to gain a little friction which is met with a satisfied grunt.
It has been such a long time since I had slept with someone beside me. I hold her close, my nose buried into her mess of hair to inhale her natural scent of sweet honey.
“Yesterday, before you got home, I had told him about an article I had read about innate bisexuality. Maybe he really was interested in learning more but just felt a little too awkward to ask.”
He looked sturdy, undeniably happy in this photo. The smile lit up the most beautiful green eyes I had ever seen that were framed with thick lashes. Small freckles were scattered over his nose and his hair was stylishly short.
“Cool. Did you learn anything?” His hazel eyes landed on mine and I nod, quite proud of myself. “I did.” I respond, a smug smile on my face.
Dean watches, wanting to approach Cas but he remains still. The angel searches for a sign, something to prove this is all a mistake.
“I don’t pity you.” I respond calmly, knowing he was simply snappy because of the shitty turn of events. “You know me better than that.” I remind him, reaching out to take his hand. At first, I was worried he was going to push it away and reject the comfort I offer him but as he tightened his fingers around my palm, I was relieved.
“But they are still fun. Come on.” I nudge him gently, trying to bring up his enthusiasm in an attempt to apologize for my statement. With a soft huff, he picks one up as I do. He watches me carefully as I crack it open, pulling apart the cookie and tugging the curled paper from the inside.
“Dean? Is that you?” I hear Cas call out through my door and I glance around, the wrapping paper and plants strewn around the bedroom messily. It looks like a madhouse in here and I couldn’t have him see it.
I push my index finger into my mouth, my eyes greedily devouring his current, vulnerable position. Pulling the slick digit from between my lips, I waste no time as I slide my finger between his cheeks slowly.
“You know Cas, I really am sorry for getting angry at you like that.” I scoot forward just a little, resting the palm of my hand on top of his. He pulls back like he was electrocuted, a distasteful look on his face.
He rolls his eyes, closing the book and adds it to his pile. With a deep breath, he turns to look at me properly.
“This is a vacation, you really don’t-” I start but she interrupts, her brows furrowing as her free hand lands on her hips, giving me
“You are my friend.” I respond. There was that word again. Bitter on the tip of my tongue, quite unpleasant and dry.
Tucking myself into the corner, I was honestly not surprised that she has darted off and now has her face pressed against the glass of the jukebox. Digging into her winter jacket, she pulls out her brightly colored coin purse and pushes a few quarters in.
“Oh, I was looking for...” I trail off. Surely, he wouldn’t judge, would he? Why should I care? It’s not like I was ever going to come back to this place again anyway. I speak low, peering around first to make sure no one else is around, “I am looking for the...gay section?” It comes out like more of a question and his face softens a little around the edges.
“Would it be ok if I lay next to you tonight? I know I usually take the couch because I don’t sleep but...” He trails off as I turn to give him a soft smile.
“Cas.” The name rolls off his tongue with warmth and I feel a tinge of immediate comfort. “I hope you don’t mind, My brother and I arrived early so I just took this bed, I hope that’s ok?” He asks, hastily pushing up the sleeves of his shirt as he starts to load all his strewn stuff back into boxes.
“I-” My eyelids flutter, leaning against the cool wall for support as I try to focus on his question and not the palpitations of my heart, “It starts off with you kissing down my neck.” I explain, my breath hitching as he slides his nose down the curve of my jaw, pressing his lips against the smooth skin, “Like that.” I grab onto his shoulders, pulling him closer, “You grinded against me.” I jutt my hips forward and rolls them slowly against his as he withdraws his hand, setting into on my waist to hold them in place as he continues the heated kisses down my neck.
“I’m not sure mistress. Do you mind if we take a break? I am suddenly feeling...” I trail off. She knew what I was feeling without me needing to voice it.Although I am usually one to keep myself composed and together, when it came to her I felt myself slip. It wasn’t a sub drop, but that is why I started researching little space. I was expecting to find why this solemn feeling had become more frequent as of recent and thought I might be regressing but I came up blank even after the research.
“My guess is that you have a present in mind already?” He asks and I scuff my shoe on the linoleum floor, clicking my tongue.
“You are my wish, Dean Winchester.” He leans closer, dropping my hand and grabs the collar of my flannel shirt. Closing the gap between us, his lips brush against mine in the most intimate way. The cake now entirely forgotten, I gently push it from my lap.
Maybe I need to talk to someone? I mean- I couldn’t talk to Cas, what an awkward, twisted turn of fate that would be. Sam- No, no and no.
Trigger list; blood play, rough sex, angry sex, violent sex, dirty talk, knife play, forced submission & drinking grace/blood.
“Good boy.’ I breath out, sitting up on my knees. I slip myself out of my boxers, stroking myself quickly. I slap my pre-leaking cock against his ass cheek and he lets out a breathy groan.
“Yes, perhaps to wipe out the vampire nest as well.” I murmur, turning my attention to Dean who was scanning the crowd.
She slips her own beanie off, tossing it into the metal cart before pulling the newly discovered bunny beanie onto her head. She giggles as she squeezes the ends and the ears flap up and down stiffly.
“Because I didn’t expect to walk in while you two were-” He seemed to splutter over his word as his eyes widen, looking like they were going to pop out of his head.
The silence settles between us. It builds an uncomfortable tension, enough to make me spill out my unwanted thoughts; “I appreciate the fact you stayed here with me. To make sure I was ok?” It was more of a question as I had honestly no idea whether that was necessarily true.
“May I try to pour the coolant in?” I ask, keeping my eyes glued to the car. He must have debated with himself for a moment before passing me the coolant hesitantly. I ever so gently tip the bottle over, pouring the green liquid into the designated area. I could feel him close behind me, watching my every move. I stop when I see it creeping to the surface, passing him back the bottle.
His jaw clenches and the feeling in the pit of my stomach has returned, that hard twist of guilt. “I’m sorry.” My words were sincere.
I make my way quickly through the room blindly, letting out a grunt as I run into the kitchen island. As silently as possible, I pull down a glass and fills it to the brim with water.
Hanging up the phone, I turn to her. “Thank you, for getting the coffee and breakfast.” I murmur, a smile tugging on the corners of my lips.
A flush crawls over my cheeks. It has been less than a week since our last encounter and I couldn’t stop craving his touch.
“I think saying it out loud would have made it too real for him.” He responds, reaching out to gently rest his palm on arm.
“What’s the special today boss?” He asks, emerging with a piece of chalk and leans on the wall, tilting his head back just a touch to give me a proper view of his long neck. God- I wanted to leave marks all over that neck of his.
“Is this going to have any relevance to me at all Sammy? Perhaps something about food, monsters or a hot chick?” I quip, moving my arms up to rest on the dining room table. He rolls his eyes, settling down on a seat opposing me. I lean back in my chair, stretching out my legs as I gesture for him to get started.
I was starting to understand but it was the other things like various apps and music that I still struggle with. He patiently sits through my useless questions, answering them without a second of hesitation.
I try not to let it bother me further as I find the chocolate nestled amongst his clothes. I toss it over to him without looking and remains focused on the tv. I hear the rustle of the wrapper only for a moment as he pretty much inhales the whole bar.
His low, inhuman moans grow louder, legs wrapping around my waist to gain better leverage and hands limply trapped between us as I continue to pound into him mercilessly.
“We remained fully clothed, using my tie to bind your wrists.” I shakily reach up to clumsily undo my tie. Without resistance, he allows me to tie his wrists together with the silky strap. “And you ride me until we both cum.” The last sentence is spoken in a whisper but I can feel the smirk on his lips.
“Sammy can explain it to you, Cas.” I take that moment to slip from the room and head to the kitchen, grabbing a beer for each of us. I don’t know why but it was always explaining sexual innuendos and metaphors along with answering sex questions always made me uncomfortable. I always stammered and blushed like a school boy.
She continues visible, deep breathes as I sing softly. I could see the anxiety slipping from her as she watches me.
I didn’t respond, I just submitted. It was so rare for me to submit to someone else but with the look in his eyes I couldn’t help it. I was weak at the knees and he had put my bratty ass in my place.
I have literally no idea where this came from! But here is a list of TRIGGER WARNINGS. So please, PLEASE keep that in mind before you read this chapter.
“Dean, I-” My admissions stop, wanting to suddenly apologize for the loss of control the last time. He is hovering above me in a flash, pulling a tie off from around his neck and bundles it up, pushing it between my parted lips.
I watch as Cas sets his jaw, a familiar twitch in his left eye. I knew this wasn’t going to end well for anyone involved so I simply shuffle in my seat, pulling the wallet out of the depths of my jeans. Fishing around for some cash, I drop it on the table.
He moved closer regardless, holding his hand out for the bun. I instead brush my index finger over the cream, taking up a generous amount as I step closer to him. I hold my finger out, a quirked smile on my lips, “Taste.”
She pulls the binder open again and gestures for me to stay quiet as she flicks through. I keep my eyes trained on the pages as she flicks through the barrel of information, I had recorded this week; My work schedule, my diet, my gym clock in and clock out times, notes on my reading, my chores check list, short-term and long-term goals.
I wait for her to continue, my fingers sliding along her spine slowly in the hopes it brings her comfort. I feel her body relax under my fingertips; “When it was at it’s worst, I was scared to sleep. That seemed to be the trigger, I would go days without it if I could. I was so scared, and so alone.” Her brows furrow, her honey colored eyes growing a little glassy, “I would spend the night with strangers to feel grounded. I just... couldn’t be alone.”
It's nothing more than a marketing ploy.” I tell him, shaking my head with a tsk as his face falls a little.
“A... plant. You are going to buy Castiel a plant?” He deadpans through the phone and I feel the heat creep up onto my cheeks.
“I should have guessed.” I mumble, reaching my hand out and hesitantly laces my fingers with his. He doesn’t question it or even let go. He remains still, waiting for my next move. I tug him to follow me, squeezing his hand ever so gently.
“You are my bitch.” He growls and I swear I would have cum in my pants if he even touched me in that moment. It was so authorative, demeaning and fucking hot.
There is an array of plants lined up neatly along the windowsill, one in particular catches my attention. A soft white, half-moon shaped vase with a stem sprouting an array of delicate purple flowers.
The conversation fizzles out and I was totally fine with that, turning up the music once again just to hear her voice as she becomes lost in her own rhythm and jams along.
His body quacks, hand quickening, “Castiel...” He whimpers, his moans growing louder and I knew he was close.
I feel my cock twitch to life, having ignored the replay of memories all day. I couldn’t help but give in to my carnal desires. My fingers slide over my stomach and down the half-mast that had pitched itself my underwear. The strain only made it hotter as I spread across the motel bed in nothing but a pair of loose-fitting boxers, a familiar wet patch of pre-cum having soaked the thin cotton suggestively.
“Good night Cassie. Text me to let me know you arrived home safely ok?” She fidgets a little with her night gown. Stepping forth, I press a kiss to the top of her head. “Alfie will be here soon. Take a rest.” I tell her and she nods. With a wave, I slip from her apartment and heads home.
I slip my hand from her grasp and makes my way to the front door, collecting the Chinese food from the delivery boy. I take it to the dining table, sorting it accordingly. I look up to be greeted by her patiently watching me from the doorway. I pull out her chair, gesturing for her to sit which she does so with a gracious nod.
“Ok.” She squeezes my hand gratefully, leaning forward and presses her forehead against my chest. Letting out a gentle sigh, I could feel her whole body relax as if she is trying to sleep. I make myself comfortable, brushing the tip of my nose along her scalp.
“This is not supposed to be easy, Castiel. I am to push you to expand your circle and better yourself as a person. Have I ever endangered you?” She asks.
“Everything is pointless. It’s no use fighting what’s meant to be.” He sounded defeated, eyebrows creasing and Dean looks like he’s rallying up for a fight.
Curling his celestial form around it like a protective blanket; he held the fragile soul close. It is a mere blip of humanity ripped from the chains of confinement for a destiny unknown to the Angel. A mark is left on the soul of the human as he rips him free, dropping him back to his weak, human form before returning to the heavens.
“Dean, what are-” I went to speak and his free hand moved to wrap around my neck. His grip is firm; dominant. “Shh...” Is all he breathed out and I fell silent.
I tuck the package under my jacket and closes the trunk as Cas gingerly places the cooler by the headlights. He settles on the hood, watching me curiously as I make my way to stand in front of him with a goofy smile.
“I am trapped, in darkness. Floating in absolute nothingness. I scream. I yell for help and nothing. No one can hear me, no one can save me. I’m just utterly and totally alone.” She whimpers a little, another round of tears streaming down her face.
“Boss?” He interrupts my thoughts once again and I can’t help but smile, I loved it when he called me that despite me being an employee just like him.
“This, all of this...” Dean spat, waving his hand around, “pre-destined crap. It’s not fair. We spend our lives being dragged around; saving people, hunting things. We are good people. We don’t deserve this.” He drags his tongue out over his lips, hands on hips as he glares. Cas doesn’t have an answer, hell, he doesn’t have enough stability to give any philosophical response. It’s like his brain had short circuited. He had nothing to give.
“Are you still pinning over that damn hunter? Piece of trash if you ask me.” She hits my arm, glaring at me, “Damn it Cassie. Move on already.” She shakes her head and huffs.
She reaches forward and slips her hand weakly into mine. No words are exchanged but as she gently squeezes my hand, I feel her overwhelming sense of gratitude.
“Hey!” I laugh, bending down to scoop up my own ball of snow. She throws it half-heartedly and runs, her bunny ears flapping quickly behind her as she flees. I chase after her and with the fact I am almost double her height, I catch up to her in no time. I scoop her up with my free arm and she tries to wiggle away, giggling manically even as I press the snowball against her cheek gently.
I nod in response, strangely feeling a little more at ease. To know I was trusted with such a task is daunting but to be believed in is so refreshing that I welcome the challenge with an open heart. I take a calming breath, letting my heavy lids flutter closed once again. And with that, I fall into a calming sleep.
“Cas-” I was going to insist that it is going to be cold, that with the murky looking water there was no way to guess what is lingering below the surface. But I hesitate, especially when his fingers expertly move down to begin undoing his dress shirt. He slides the cotton shirt from his shoulders, moving onto his thick belt.
The night is dead quiet, but I hear him well before the light flicks on. The slight fumble in his step and the strong smell of beer and sweat. I hold my breath, taking a moment to brace myself before turning to face the hunter.
“Perhaps you are questioning your sexuality?” His voice is soft and non-judgmental but it doesn’t stop the blush creeping further up to my ears. I lower my eyes, looking down at my clasped hands. I have barely admitted to myself that I was questioning everything I was so I certainly wasn’t ready to say it out loud to him. But if there was a good time for me to confess anything, it was now.
The sounds of slapping skin forced me back to my dream like state, my eyes devouring the sight of him reaping pleasure from me in any way he seems fit.
Their story was brief, only in town to clear out the vampire nest. How they heard about it or how they found the exact location remains a mystery. Almost as secretive as their backstory. Dean didn’t reveal any information about how he met them or exactly who they are. I guess these hunters are about as private as us.
The look on his face is utterly priceless. A mix between shock and gratitude, his soft lips parted speechlessly as he searches for something to say. His eyes soften and even through the shroud darkness, I knew everything he needed to say without him having to breath a word of it.
Enjoy! Be warned that this is an angsty chapter. I update every sunday :) To see what else I'm working on feel free to follow me on tumblr @sweetteamultifandom.
I was about to apologize for my outburst when he breathes out; “Were you holding out on me? You can be in charge, Angel. But you have to make me submit to you.” He challenges, sliding one of his palms over his length slowly.
Her red heels and well-manicured toes peek into my vision and I remain still. Without a word, she leans forward and lifts the collar from the floor. I feel her presence as she moves around to behind me, fingers sliding over the curve of my shoulder in a gentle manner before she laces the collar around my neck with a firm knot. With a brush over her palm over my hair, I gracefully stand up from my position on the floor. I bite back a grunt as pins and needles prickle along my knees and down my calves.
I take a moment before moving forward silently and peering over his shoulder. I stay quiet, moving my eyes up to watch him as he intently looks through the book. He seemed as genuinely interested as I was.
His hand slides over and laces his fingers with mine before redirecting his attention back out the window. With my heart in my throat, I hesitantly slide my thumb along the side of his hand in a comforting way.
Spurts of hot white ribbons coated the sheets and my stomach, leaving me dizzy and high as I watch him follow close behind. Wetness pools at the front of his jeans and with a final smirk of satisfaction, he was gone.
Unzipping his dress pants, he gives himself a few strokes but Dean was more than eager as he leans forward and laps needily at the tip. “Good boy...” I coo softly, gently sliding my index finger down to tease his puckered hole. He opens his mouth, willingly taking in the hardening cock as the king grips onto his hair and rolls his hips slowly. Taking my cue, I spread his legs a little wider, my fingers digging hard enough in his skin to create new bruises over the fading ones. “Such a pretty thing.” I slide inside him with a low grunt, his warmth enveloping me completely.
“I’m sorry, Ro. I am doing my best.” I breath out and she shakes her head, tight lipped as she gently tugs me along to the bedroom, “I know you are sweet pea. Up on the bed.” She tells me, wrapping her robe tighter around her waist.
“Dean-“ I felt another tug of my hair which made me feel a strange sense of pride. I loved knowing when I was doing a good job, the moans and soft slips of my name always made it worth it. I start of slow as I bob my head to an unspoken rhythm.
“I came here for sex and now I'm too tired anyway. I’m not going all the way back to hell to just come back tomorrow.” He scoffs, a shooing motion made with his hand. “Move over. I’m crashing here.” He tells me, acting like it’s more of an inconvenience to stay but I could tell that wasn’t the case. Despite his Demon nature, deep down he was still Dean. He is worried about me.
I hear the click of the front door and I straighten my back like a reflex. Eyes downcast, I remain silent and unmoving as her heels click slow against the wooden floor before shifting to muffled taps on the soft carpet.
“I do not understand. Can you explain it to me?” He asks, quirking his head towards me. While the joke was funny, I found it might be a little awkward to explain. Luckily for me, Sam came back in obviously done pouting.
I pull my bag up onto the bed and tugs open the zipper of my duffel. I pour out the contents and gently digs through to find my shower caddy. With a look of success, I climb to my feet and makes my way to the shared bathroom.
We remain quiet and I pick up a piece of cheesy pizza, ignoring the strange tension. I take a bite of the dough, sneaking glances at him.
“Castiel Milton?” The receptionist drawls out from behind her thick rimmed glasses, slamming her overly polished nails against the old keyboard.
There was somewhere along the way where I should have hesitated getting in the bright yellow mini cooper with a total stranger. But I wanted to be fearless, impulsive for once in my life. The only other time I had been this sure of something was when I left Dad and Dean to go to Harvard.
“You don’t have enough in yourself.” She glances up at the clock and I notice it clicking over to ten, “Alfie will be here soon darling, may I?” She gestures towards my collar and I do my best to hide my disappointment at our scene already being over.
She flicks through the pages, moving past my submissive contract and general health paperwork she keeps on file.
I usually update every sunday but I am currently helping my partner get ready to move to Germany so emotions are high and I will update when I can :)
“The article about Innate Bisexuality?” He interrupts, his eyes lingering on my face as I clear my throat, a slight warmth rushing to my cheeks as I nod.
in nature. I could feel it resonating with me. The words, the softness of the strings reverberating. I stare in awe, my focus not breaking from him for even a minute.
“I apologize, mistress.” I murmur and she bows her head; “I promise I will divulge more information after dinner.”
“Seems someone has been fucking the demon for too long.” He tsks, clearly smirking at his own knowledge which I had no intent of chasing up. All I wanted to do was consume this boy and have him begging for release.
I was about to get up and leave when he tells me to wait. Refocusing my attention on him, he says; “I was thinking about something you said to me at the library yesterday morning.” He sits up a little straighter, scooting closer to me, “You said that my human birthday is the fifth of December.”
“I can’t really give my opinion, I mean, I’m new and I haven’t even tried one-“ A thought flashes into my head and my smile grows wider.
I let my mind lazily flick through my own fantasies, my eyes meeting his dark and lustful ones. He moves quickly, stripping down to absolutely nothing. I pull the fabric from my mouth, a smirk crawling over my full lips.
I let my body relax, heart racing as I come down from my post-orgasmic high. I catch my breath, licking over my dry lips. Still in a daze, I reach down and snatches up a rogue shirt that lay nearby. I wipe the sticky cum from my stomach and thighs, cleaning off my fingers. Despite smelling like sex, I was too worn out to shower. It was pizza and then bed for me.
“As you know, Alfie is now under my care. He is one of the only ones who stayed after Michael was expedited. He was...difficult at first. I need you to listen carefully, do you understand?”
“Well, I’m not going to say no.” He responds, slipping off his coat without another word. Dean whimpers, pawing at Crowleys’ thighs the second he kneels onto the bed. He was desperate and it was absolutely beautiful.
“You are right, coffee sounds pretty great actually.” I drag my hand down over my face, shooting her a grateful smile.
“Gabby.” I reach forward and brushes my fingers over her knuckles, showing her that I really mean no harm by my words and she visibly relaxes a little, “It’s perfectly normal to have nightmares, I have them too sometimes.” She watches me carefully, obviously still trying her best not to recall the events. I decide maybe my way to break through to her is to share my own trauma, my own pain. So she knows she isn’t alone.
Cliché, but man this girl is hot. I brush my hand down over my exposed length and to the base of my curled hair. My digits slide up, habitually gripping the shaft as my thumb presses down over my pre-leaking tip, the cool liquid making my legs quake and my back arches up a little. A tingle shoots down my spine, an involuntary shutter as I spread my thighs further apart. My fingers grasp a little tighter, sliding my fingers up and down rhythmically.
I grin, popping open the glossy box and begins digging at the short-crusted pastry when I feel myself being watched. I look up, my fork full of pie as Cas eyes it off, standing behind the couch.
“Alright, as a human tradition, you make a wish and blow the candles out.” I tell him and he shoots me a rather sassy look, very familiarly like Sam's.
“I’m turning in. You fellas have a good night.” I scoot from the booth, ignored by the three hunting amigos down the end who were now laughing about something ridiculous. I gently tap Cas’ shoulder who without hesitation followed me from the bar.
“Beer, perfect.” I announce, leaning forward and snatches up the glass bottle. I take a box for myself, leaning back as I rest my bare feet up on the wooden coffee table.
Two brunettes, one in a tailored suit and the other dressed down in a simple t-shirt and jeans. The latter is kneeling down in front of the suited man, hands tied behind his back and his hair grasped tightly in the grip of the other male.
“I’m sorry if it wasn’t my place to add such a comment, I was really only trying to help.” She offers, nervously tapping the edge of the cup with her metal spoon. I wave a hand, brushing off her apology.
After clearing off the sheets from the motel bed, I take a quick shower and resumes my mission of finding angels.
My response should be yes. Gabby told me I should try and expand my circle, even my therapist has been encouraging the same. But this is big. Meeting one person, fine. Meeting a group, no thank you. Sam is enough for today. Baby steps.
It was an unusually quiet afternoon in the bunker. Only Sam and I were home, Cas having ducked out to grab dinner. Regardless, I was snacking. My feet were up on the table, leaning back in my chair as I enjoy the simplicity of the afternoon. No monsters. No demons. Just me and my sandwich.
“What do you mean you have never been?!” She gasps dramatically, feigning offense as she clutches at her chest.
He gestures towards my hand and I look at him, quite confused. He laughs, eyes crinkling as I feel my heart leap up in my throat.
“You are right, I don’t know. But what am I going to do? Just go to a bar and pick up a guy?” I ask, but she just gives me a look like ‘duh’.
I slip only a few feet away, settling on a beaten-up arm chair in mustard yellow and grabs a hold of the aging remote to flick through the channels. I could hear them whisper arguing and I roll my eyes, gently playing with the hem of my coat sleeve.
He studies my face, eyes boring into mine and searches for something. “You don’t know.” He murmurs and the crease deepens between my brows.
“Sammy, who’s that?” A female voice coos on the other end of the line. My eyebrows shoot up in surprise.
“Dean. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t expect him to stay miserable and pining over you like a teenager. Either stop being a moron and confess to him, or let him go.” I announce, moving closer to him.
I didn’t even have time to continue my train of thought as he shoves me up against the bread bench and pulls me into a heated kiss. My fingers claw at his shirt, tugging at his buttons in some desperate attempt to feel over his bare chest. All this tension and flirting, building up over a month period had left me much too excited and eager.
“What are we doing here?” Cas’ voice is soft but he just appears behind me and I almost hit my head out of surprise as I jump, “Dammit Cas.” I growl lowly, “Grab the cooler out of the back seat.” He vanishes and I roll my eyes.
The lady gives us a look of disproval as we leave. We take our time up and down every aisle. Soon enough, Sam joins us. He loads a bunch of protein bars, health drinks and all kinds into the trolley as Dean tells him to keep that crap away from his food in case it was contagious.
“It’s such a beautiful view. I went hiking, went up onto the sky trail, the whole thing really is amazing!” She gushes, letting out a long breath of enthusiasm.
I feel my legs grow weak, my eyelids heavy as I look back at my reflection once again. Then everything goes black.
“Say a word and I will break your teeth.” He hisses and I keep quiet but can’t stop the creeping smile on my lips. I close my eyes and drifts into a calm slumber.
We both settle on burgers despite her insistence that they have the best chocolate fondue place in the world only a few blocks away. Stepping inside a quaint diner, luckily only being not much further down the strip, it is styled like the early 50s. To her delight it includes; the checkered floor and red vinyl seats, coupled with cute skater uniforms and an old timey record player in the corner. Scooping up the much too large menus at the counter, I give the waitress a polite greeting as she leads us to a free booth up the back.
“Dean.” I look back up at him, green eyes meeting his soft blue ones. They held no judgement and were as clear as a summer day. “I never understood humans and their need to put everything into such definitive boxes. There are things in this universe that are twisted and warped, that could never be explained in words. So why does something as freeing and personal as sexuality need a label? I think as angels, it is easier for us as we are genderless and fluid. Sexuality never matters to us. I can imagine how this might be scary for you, Dean. But perhaps, you just are who you are? You don’t need to label yourself as Bisexual or Gay to be valid. You have always broken outside the restraints the world has placed on you so why confine to them now?”
I read the message aloud to Cas (Bar the part where I should work it out with Cas), the conversation having slipped back to a sense of normalcy and all awkwardness being alleviated via a distraction. He seems just as confused as I am.
that look of sadness in her eyes that threatened our day together and I felt a tinge of guilt. I had put a damper on such a fun day.
“Research material. Gotcha.” He shoots a playful wink and begins to walk left, moving through the aisles with a purpose. I follow behind, my head hung a little low. He suddenly stops, his thick fingers brushing over the spines of a few books. “Is it personal or for academic purposes?”
I spring to sit up, Cas falling off the bed and onto the floor with a soft yelp. I could just imagine how I looked; guilty and a little flushed. I refuse to make eye contact. There was nothing for me to be ashamed of, neither of us had done anything wrong but I honestly felt like I had been caught with my hand in the cookie jar. My eyes drop to look at Cas who was confused and just as guilty looking as me.
My eyes delve around the room, trying to take in every detail of my new surroundings. The office is quaint, nothing but a few dingey chairs that are fraying around the edges and plants that are bordering on death.

“I took the time to groom myself.” I murmur, a crease furrowing between brows, “I made sure to keep up to date with my journal and I took time out of my schedule to do some research.”
“My girlfriend and I kinda split so- back to the dorms.” He announces, clearly forcing a wider smile. Perhaps this is a recent adjustment so I don’t push the subject but rather change it to make him more comfortable.
“Just like that, Angel. I’m yours--” He breathes out, the sound of slapping skin and mixed moans pushing me over the edge as I fill him up with hot cum. He follows with a broken groan, his cock twitching as he spurts out white ribbons between us. I let out a low growl, riding out my orgasm with slow, unsteady thrusts. With shaky legs, I pull out from his abused hole, the cum dripping out onto his soft skin.

Everyone is so judgmental, especially since ‘the incident’. Her name was smeared through the newspapers, her brothers having pulled her reputation through the mud but she was too proud to back down and always insisted on coming back to these places.
Lifting his hips, he presses my tip at the tight ring of muscles. His body tenses, one hand on my chest as the other guides my cock inside of him. He lets out soft, beautiful moans and it takes all of my willpower to not just thoughtlessly thrust up into him.
“Dean...” I gently brush my fingers over the side of the car, tilting my head a little. “Sam is your brother. You have an unbreakable bond. With everything you have been through, you will be together for life. But me.” I frown a little, my mouth pulling down in the corners, “I am replaceable.”
“Let’s go see this Canyon.” I slip out of the car, adjusting my newly bought scarf around my neck. She hops around to my side, checking over me to make sure I am warm enough. I roll my eyes, insisting that I really am fine and for her to stop worrying so much.
Within mere seconds he is dragging me to the ground, fumbling as he tries to get my dress pants off. He gets them to around my knees before giving in, tugging my hardened length free from the constraints of my briefs.
I rest my palms on his hips, leaning down and lets my tongue trace the trail of cum along his navel. My lustful eyes meet his and with a wink, he is gone yet again.
I reach down to the small cooler that is settled just by my right ankle, popping the lid and scoops out a small, smoothed box that is balanced perfectly on top of the cluster of beers and ice. Popping open the lid, it reveals a neatly decorated cake with the cursive;
“Perhaps we shall keep playing out this fantasy of yours and then we can do one of mine.” He breathes it out like a deal and I can’t help but nod. Sliding my hands from his shoulders, I brush them over his jeans, tugging his crotch a little closer so he can feel my achingly hard length that was straining against the zipper.
He barely said two words when he sat down, know obviously mulling over what to say as he takes a few breathes but to no avail. I must have been sitting there for well over an hour when I give in. Taking a hold of my untouched food, I drop the contents into the sink and places the bowl aside.
I try not to stare but honestly, a Dean that had just woken up was honestly the best thing to grace this earth. Tussled hair, this cute little half smirk and disheveled clothes. It made me just want to tangle my fingers in the golden, fluffy mess.
“Cas’ birthday is tomorrow and I don’t know what to get him.” I respond, a soft sigh slipping from my lips.
“I’m,” He pauses for a moment, dragging his eyes back down to his phone. “Going out on a date.” He rushes out and I almost choke on my own tongue.
It is like last night never happened and I would have thought that it didn’t if it wasn’t for the subtle red lines and tired bags that hang low despite the concealer under her usually bright eyes.
“Tell me. Or I won’t do it.” He breaks the silence yet again before massaging his tongue along the underside of my length, tracing the ribboned vein slowly.
Despite my lengthy explanation on how that wouldn’t be possible I was met with radio silence momentarily before Sam explained that it was in fact a joke.
Instead, the kiss is firm; dominant. So slow and calculated. Like he has been thinking about this for so long that he has mapped out every moment. Every breath. Every touch. The warmth of his breath, the sweetness of the frosting and the pounding in my ears is almost deafening.
“And if you were taking pictures, you would have missed it.” She murmurs. I nod, leaning on the railing. I don’t even notice that she has disappeared until a hard clump of wetness smacks into my shoulder. I let out an
“I feel like it is. That I haven’t shoved him enough in the right direction.” I respond truthfully as I let out a prolonged sigh.
“Y-you did?” I stammer, clearing my throat as she shoots me a warning glare, “I am honored, mistress.”
Castiel was desperate to find something to cling to. God had abandoned them, all of his children. The knees of his vessel felt heavy, his heart hammering in an unfamiliar way and he could feel something welling up in his chest. The angel felt so lost, he needed to feel- something.
“Cas.” I plead in a hushed whisper. The last thing I want is to start a fight in such a public place.
His hand grips the shaft, pressing his thumb against the pre-leaking slit. With parted lips and hooded eyes, I let out a soft whine.
I nod, deciding to trust her as she slips her hand into mine. Being careful, she trudges through the icy mud and pulls me along a path that seems familiar to her.
“NO! I mean... just stuff about it.” I respond, my heart pounding in my chest as I was sure that my cheeks were a flaming red. Oh god, what kind of library is filled with Erotica?
“Come on Cas, where is all your wisdom-y crap now?” He huffs, still impatiently pushing despite the angels’ warning glare.
I flick open my bookmarks, immediately scoping out Busty Asian Beauties. Clicking on a much-repeated video, I unbuckle my jeans and frees myself of both my pants and boxers, before slipping off my shirt. Tossing them aside, I lean against my headboard and fumbles through my nightstand for the half used bottle of lube. Squirting a generous amount onto my palm, I settle in and plays the video.
The moment we step out of the cold and into the shopping center, I stomp a little on the mat provided to shake the leaves and wet, dirty ice build-up from the bottom of my shoes. Sam completely vanishes, mumbling about something getting some healthy snacks. Dean shrugs it off, opting for a small trolley as I follow behind. The usual things began to pile in; bullet casings, salt, duct tape, matches, lighters and so forth. It was when Dean saw the beer that his mission was deterred and he made an immediate beeline towards it.
I feel a sharp pain in my head, not exactly the first thing I want to experience as I am pulled out of my unconscious state. I squint through the darkness, making out a figure sitting on the edge of my bed. Unmoving, I just lay there and gather my bearings.
It wasn’t long until his hands were buried in my hair, thrusting at his own pleasurable speed into my mouth. He was lost in ecstasy, strings of moans falling from his lips as he drew closer to orgasm. I slid one hand from his thigh, brushing my fingers over his ball sack. I let my hands fondle them as I allow him to use my mouth however he pleases. Pools of drool gathered at the corners of my lips, my cheeks flushed and eyes half lidded with obvious attraction and lust.
“Hey, Cas. Do you mind if I talk to you about something?” I place the fork and empty box down on the floor beside us. Maybe if I brought it up to him casually, just kind of ask him what he categorized our relationship as it wouldn’t be such a big deal.
“Ugh, he’s nice?” I suggest as a response and she rolls her eyes, a grin on her face as she nudges me playfully.
“Hurry up.” He spits out and I have enough of his attitude. I grab the discarded tie, leaning forward and I grip his hair roughly. I tug him to arch his back, shoving the tie into his mouth where his teeth skim my fingers.
Trudging through the slick mud and wet grass, I stomp my boots on the mat leading into the building. Taking a moment to gather myself, I push through the heavy glass door to be met with bustling parents and nervous looking freshman. The loud noises, crowds of people have me on edge. The anxiety so thick in the air you could almost taste it. I squeeze past the hordes; mumbling soft apologies. I keep my head low, slipping through the weaves of the unmoving crowd.
I feel his fingers gently brush up over my shoulders, his fingertips dancing up over the skin on my neck. My heart is pounding in my ears but not in the way I dreamed it would. It felt so good, so right for once in my life but-
“Oh, really? I mean I assumed they weren’t magical in any kind of way but that just degrades them entirely.” He mutters, now clearly a little disheartened.
My body quivers and I feel bile rise in my throat. Leaning forward, I throw up into the sink. I heave, my body shaking as I squint down at the contents. It’s black, thick with blood.
“What is wrong with liking a book such as this?” He snatches it from my hands and shoots me a look along with a tsk.
My phone pinged. Once. Twice. Three, four, eight, ten. I looked at it in alarm, shuffling over to the night stand and unlocks my phone. Greeted with a spam of messages and missed calls from Dean, worry contorts in my lower stomach.
The angel doesn’t say a word. He knows Dean is just as broken as he is; his emotion is roiling off him in thick waves. Cas leans against the car door, not daring to look up at the heavens that betrayed him. After thousands of years of servitude, this is what he got?
“You always defend him and his poorly judged actions.” He reminds me and I nod, letting out a sigh as I lean my head back against the car seat.
“Dean. What are you doing in this aisle?” He inquires, his voice curious and not an ounce of judgement. His fingers brushed over a particular book, pulling it from the shelves.
“Here you go doll, a bacon and egg deluxe for you and a waffle stack for your friend here.” Smacking her gum loudly, she gives me a flirty smile before disappearing back to the kitchen. I shoot her a thankful smile before looking down at my food. If anything was going to flush out this hangover, it was going to be this stack of greasy bacon.
“What did you find?” She interrupts my thoughts, her small hands wrapped around the handle bars of a cart. She looks over curiously, her lips parting and forming an
“Why do we have to explain anything?” I challenge, moving to position myself in front of Cas to block his view of Dean.
I look over at the perky blonde in the driver's seat, her pink beanie is pulled down over her hair and she is all rugged up in winter gear which was a vast change from the outlandish dress she was wearing the night before. She is singing loudly, her whole heart poured into it which I thought would annoy me but she looks so happy as she belts out her tunes that I don’t mind so much.
“Sam.” She hesitates, closing the trunk and redirects her attention to me. I wait patiently after a simple nod of my head, “I think it’s brave, what you did. I can tell you are very close to Cas and Dean, I can only imagine how bothered you are that you aren’t there to help them but they need to find their own way. If you force them together, they will just resent you later down the line.” She steps closer, fixing up my new jacket. Smoothing it out with her fingers, her maple syrup colored eyes flick up to meet mine, “If you need to talk or if you need some space. Tell me.” She gives me a small smile before vanishing to put the cart away.
I didn’t know where to go. The bunker was where he would be, or the roadhouse. I couldn’t bear to see him yet. The sting of rejection was draped over me like a constricting blanket. I was
I was pissed off at first for being disturbed, but her energy was familiar to me. There was something about her I just couldn’t place. She was irritating, loud and eye-roll worthy but honestly, I was glad she was here. She was a fun distraction from everything that had happened a few hours prior.
She reaches for the radio knob, turning it down to a minimum as she shoots me a bright smile momentarily before returning her attention to the road.
“Why didn’t he--?” The words caught in my throat and I was hoping that he could fill in what I was trying to say.
“Yeah, come in.” The gruff voice announces from the other side. With a twist of the doorknob, I push it open. Dean is half sprawled out on his bed, the book roughly shoved under his pillow beside him in a weak attempt to hide it as I step inside the quaint room. I was almost never in here, not wanting to intrude on Deans’ space. But it was warm, mostly smelling of flannel and spearmint.
“How are you going to know unless you try it?” He quips and I roll my eyes, “Pie is the only thing I seem to like. I doubt a gelatin sugar cube is going to be another snack I enjoy.” I respond but it the end, I take it anyway.
“Right.” I murmur, pulling myself into a sitting position. Leaning back against the hollow headboard, I pull the sheets up to settle around my waist.
It tastes of beer and sweat as I bite down into the fabric. I give up, knowing that the demon wouldn’t accept the apology regardless. He is here to play, and that's it. He isn’t interested in anything else. Just to fulfill every dirty fantasy he wishes before vanishing again.
I smile softly, appreciating her concern and attempt of comfort before sliding into the passenger seat. I brush the fallen snow off the sleeves of my jacket, running my hands through my almost too long hair as she slips into the driver's seat.
“I am surprised you made it to two. You are clearly wasted.” She states, her eyebrows raising in amusement. “Maybe we should sober you up a little before you head off home, yeah?”
“You can eat without me tonight.” He comments with ease and my gaze shifts back to look at him suspiciously.
He began to learn what it is to be human; to feel. So many emotions, so much to discover. The more the angel was around him, time began to slow. He was no longer detached from humanity, instead he felt entranced by it. He was in awe of a beauty that had taken for granted. He had spent centuries watching; observing them as they evolved. But he had never truly appreciated it until now.
I nod, taking her words in. Was I really that transparent of a person? Had I lost my youth and sense of wonder so young to the point that I no longer enjoyed the little things? Had I really become so numb and having given up on everything good for my future?
“Hurry up, I don’t have all day.” I snap and his hands hover just above the waist band of his jeans.
“I don’t know, to be very honest with you.” She responds, leaning back against her seat as the coffee and pie was placed respectively in front of both of us. She reached over, her bright and playful spark dimming as she brushed her hand over mine long enough to stop me repetitively creasing the soft tissue.
“Cas, get out. I need to talk to Sam.” Although he looked calm, his body language says otherwise. The angel didn’t say a word, scrambling to grab his trench coat as his eyes stay glued to the floor.
White ribbons splatter over the stained motel sheets, his body shaking in absolute ecstasy. His hole clenches, milking my dry of my own orgasm. “Fuck-” I let out a low moan, filling him to the brim with my cum. Crowley continues abusing his mouth, lips plump and swollen as he sucks hungrily. With a final thrust, the demon fills up the younger male’s mouth. The seed spills out down his mouth and over his chin, lips parted as he lays in a lustful daze of cum and saliva.
With a flurry of bright cotton and blonde hair, she slips outside into the cold winter air. Reluctantly pulling myself out of the warm sheets, I strip down to nothing and heads to the bathroom. Turning the water on full blast, the shaky shower head bursts to life and spurts out as much hot water as it can possibly muster.
“Ok, not much in the way of hobbies which is totally fine, what about tv? What does he like to watch?” She inquires.
“Dean, I know this custom. It’s been around for many years.” He tells me and I wave him off. Regardless if he knew it or not, I feel a sense of pride at being able to educate him on human customs.
“Tell me about this wine.” She quizzes, her eyes fluttering as she circles the rim of her glass with her index finger.
“So, when he comes to pick me up later, be nice.” With the finality of his words, he slips from the library and heads back to his room. I almost splutter out a response only to be met with silence.
He is still blindly faithful to John even after he passed. Maybe that is something that would never fade, even as time moves on. Dean trusts him blindly and Cas will follow fire and ice into the pit with him.
“I could eat.” I respond, reluctantly letting her go as I slip into the passenger seat and clicks my seat belt on.
“Psh. So? Unless there is something you want to tell me about yourself.” I tease lightly but he seems frustrated, slamming his laptop lid closed. I was surprised, not expecting this kind of response.
“Mm.” I respond, rolling my half empty coffee cup between my fingers as I let my gaze redirect out the window.
Stepping back out into the chilled night, I wave down a taxi as I was not risking driving Baby in this weather. If I crashed it, Dean would kill me. As the headlights of the car flash, the driver pulls up and I tug the creaky door open.
“Come on, I know you had just as much fun as I did.” His voice purrs as I feel him move closer, his body radiating an intoxicating heat.
“I...uh...” I laugh awkwardly, going to push my free hand in my pocket and fail in the most dramatic way possible. Damn it man, pull yourself together. I flash him a charming smile, trying to clear my head but he really was something else. Almost other worldly in beauty and I really couldn’t help but stand there like a gaping fish as I stare at him.
Blinking the sleep from my eyes, I wince at the bold sunlight peeking through the slats of the cheap motel blinds.
“Castiel, you deserve better.” I breath out and his glassy, blue eyes finally meet mine. They are full of sorrow and despair, absolute and utter loneliness. I wonder if that’s the look I gave him when Gabriel died? I know this pain. I know what it feels like to lose hope. At that time, I just needed to forget. Just become absolutely lost in a world where I hadn’t just lost my best friend and guardian. The one person I had loved as much as I had Jess.
I feel a sense of relief, having the anxiety slip from my grasp as she straightens a little and her familiar switch of tone has me melting into a puddle of relief.
“When are we heading out?” He asks, swinging his legs off the bed. He stands, heading to his small closet and pulls out a duffle.
Having enough of being dominated, I grab his hips and rolls us both over so I am on top. I don’t wait for him to gather himself, I simply take him. Rough and hard, my sharp hipbones slamming against his plush ass with erratic thrusts. My palms grip at the gravel, almost chest to chest as I fuck him to my content.
“....Castiel.” He drawls out and I feel my cock twitch with excitement under my boxers and tight pants, my heart barreling against my ribcage. “If I tell you to do something, you will answer with ‘Yes Castiel’. Do you understand?” I breath out and he cocks his head.
“Wouldn’t you second guess getting in a car with a stranger you drunkenly met the night before?” I quip, shooting her a smile so she knows it was more of a half joke than a serious train of thought.
The room is fairly plain, drawn velvet curtains in the corner offered a hint of light as I began to blow up the colorful balloons. Pinching my fingers a few times as I tied one after the other, it wasn’t long before I was light headed and proud of my work. I hang them up around the room along with streamers which was also a pain in the ass (why do they tear so easily?!). After pulling out the tape, my job became a lot easier. Those balloons and streamers were never moving with the amount of tape I had used. Pretty happy with the results, I grab Cas’ presents and line them up on the coffee table.
I immediately stop thrusting, my eyes darkening as I repeat his line from our previous session; “You have to tell me what you want. Or you don’t get it.”
He looks down at me, eyes lost in clouds of lust as his thumb brushes the wet semen from my skin. “Maybe, if you behave for the rest of the morning, I might just return the favor.” He slides the pad of his thumb over his tongue and I almost whined at how incredibly hot that simple action was.
“Do you want to hear my fortune?” I ask, hoping it would be enough to distract Castiel as I pull my Chinese box closer and pops the lid.
She leads me out to the viewing deck. Although we were knee deep in snow, she looks like this is the most excited she has ever been. She stops dead center in the middle of the deck. She looks around before focusing back on me, “What do you think?”
It was totally worth it. All the pinched skin on my fingers, the tumble of swear words as I cursed the ripped paper streamers and mounds of duct tape I tore through. Just for that very moment, that priceless look on his face. His eyes were wide, blinking a few times as his lips form to say a few words but they all fall flat.
“They are coming on the hunt with us.” He comments, peeling the wet jacket from around his shoulder and discards it on the backseat beside me.
“Sam. There isn’t anything more to know. Dad trusted them, therefor so do I. They are a little rough around the edges but when has that ever not been the case with other hunters?” He shrugs half-heartedly.
It takes me back to the days where Sam and I used to light up fireworks and just enjoy the show. Glancing over at the angel, with each explode of color his smile grows wider.
“Cas!” I snap back to reality, flicking my eyes to the bright blonde momentarily before ripping my eyes away to search the sea of people to look for him. I wanted to chase after him, follow and find out more when Gabriel gently brushes her hand over my upper arm; “You alright?” She asks and I feel ridiculous, there was no way I would run into Jensen down town, what kind of luck would that be? Perhaps I am just imagining things, it was probably just a guy who looked like him so I simply wave it off. “Yeah, I'm fine. Let’s head back to yours.” I know better than to ask if she had dealt with her ‘problem’. She would brush it off or shoot me a warning glare so I had learnt better than to ask over the last few months.
“How delicious indeed. Farewell, feathers.” With a snap, Crowley is gone and the two of us are left alone again.
“You left your beer in the other room so I brought it for you.” He interrupts my gushing over the pie and I swallow quickly, taking the half-finished beer from his hand. His eyes linger on my pie, not letting his gaze break.
“That isn’t what I meant.” His voice appears behind me and I fight the urge to jump out of my skin, a tingle of lust quivering down my back.
“It’s ok, I’m here. I promise I’m not leaving.” I reassure him as I sway him gently. I don’t know how much time passes before his sobs die out and there are no more tears left for him to cry. He peels away without another word and shuffles to the bathroom. My guess was he needed a moment to regroup and collect himself.
She looks over at me, noticing my solemn look. Perhaps this road trip was a bad idea. At first, I was enthralled with the thought of running away with this blonde for a while but now as we sit so far away from home in her mini cooper, I couldn’t help but feel a little homesick. I was always with Dean and Cas, so being away from them was such an oddity.
I join him on the hood of Baby, leaning back against her windshield as I let out a relieved sigh. It had been months since we had the opportunity to simply live in the moment and take a breath. Hunt after hunt, there was never any time to come out here to the familiar clearing to just talk about nothing and drink beers ‘till sunrise.
His voice trails off but the song continues, his fingers strumming a few remaining notes before falling silent. There was no applause, not even a peep from the audience. People continue on with their own business and he places the guitar down. He stands without a word, unplugging the speaker.
I continue the slow strokes with my grace, allowing it to flow and tingle over his sensitive head and without warning, he cums;
I pull into a clearing and lets the engine die out along with the headlights. I grab a torch from the glove compartment, climbing out and heads around to the trunk. I pop it open, digging behind all the hunting gear for a familiar plastic bundle.
“Not even for fun?” I pry a little more, scuffing my boot along the carpet slowly as my eyes look anywhere but into his.
Not a word, not another breath. He left me feeling dirty and a complete mess. I lay there, stunned. Completely unsure what has just happened. When I woke this morning, I hoped that it was just a dream. Something I could wash myself clean of. But as I lay here in the cum coated sheets, the scent of his dominance having left a residue behind, I felt like I had committed the greatest sin of all.
I have never felt such a deep connection with music before but this was a whole new experience, a new emotion. I could feel my soul breaking down the center, cracks forming along the delicate binding. The pain and sorrow in his voice as he sings destroys my shattered heart and I feel the lyrics etching into my mind. In that moment it felt like the song is written for me.
Adjusting his coat, he doesn’t bother to look at me; “I know Dean. It’s fine. I’m going to go wait in the car.”
“Dean. Can you imagine what he was going through? Loving Gabriel was one thing but saying it out loud? Worried about coming out? And then having that love ripped away?” He squeezes my arm and I pull it away, a sense of grief washing over me. It wasn’t the reminder of loss for Gabriel, but the loss that Sammy felt and I didn’t even notice.
“I-” I hesitate for a moment, her golden eyes flicking up to watch me cautiously. I knew she wouldn’t push for answers as I begin to stab at the crust of the pie. I let everything out about how the night unfolded, leaving out bits and pieces of magic and monsters as not to terrify her. She dips her head in various parts, obviously piecing everything together in her mind. There was a moment of silence before she responds.
“Come ‘ere.” He gestures for me to move closer. Peering inside at the multitude of gears, parts and grease, I was definitely out of my depth. Guns, knives, mass destruction, I could do. But a car? Perhaps I shot too high and should pick something a little more mundane.
I take a deep breath. When we first started this exercise all those years ago, I couldn’t think of a single thing. But as she built my confidence; proved to me that I am worth the fuss and affection, it became easier.
I give him a brief run-down of the events that had occurred in the library, from finding Dean in the health, mind and sexuality section to the relentless flirting from the librarian. I was expecting him to tell me it was nothing or to just brush it off. But instead his face lit up like he had just come to a realization.
“Were you up all night reading?” I ask curiously, stepping into his dimly lit room and settles down on the edge of his bed.
His pink tongue flicked out over his lips, a smirk pulled at the corners in utter amusement at my reaction. I tried to justify it. Tried to reason with why he is acting the way he did but even as he slid up to straddle my hips, all types of rationality slip away.
“Perhaps the beach is as good as I thought it would be.” He comments slyly and I shoot him a glare, “Shu’ddup.”
No matter how many times I study those emerald eyes for a hint of longing or desire, or the amount of time I spend watching his body language in a desperate attempt at seeing some kind of love in return was absolutely damning.
“Practice safe eating. Always use condiments.” He literally deadpans, his face stoic as I burst out into genuine laughter.
Finishing up in just under an hour, I take a moment to admire my work before going to ‘wake’ the angel who was probably reading at this point of the morning, last night's activities pushed to the back of my mind.
Weeks pass and I am travelling alone yet again. Scouting angels, trying to piece heaven back together. Nights blur into mornings and vice versa. Maps litter the walls, pictures are scattered around the now semi-permanent motel I inhabit.
“What is your plan?” Cas asks the other hunters, rolling his shoulders back a little. This was the part he was good at. Planning, strategizing and destroying.
He eyes us both suspiciously, Sam immediately going quiet and getting up with a huff. He storms off to his room and I meet Cas’ gaze. His head tilts ever so gently to the left as if asking what was wrong and I respond with a soft shrug. He places the plastic bags on the dining table where I was situated, fishing through for my Chinese food. He places it beside me, his face lit up in excitement. “They gave me a bag of fortune cookies for free, would you like one Dean? I am eager to see the kind of prediction these small cookies have to offer me.”
After grabbing dinner from a diner, we then decide to turn in. We sleep in separate beds after a simple goodnight. I fall asleep almost instantly but thankfully with my light sleeping habits, I was stirred awake around midnight from a soft whimper.
Dean puffs out his chest and like my worst nightmare has crawled out from the pages of a memior, he sounds exactly like dad as he says; “Every good man deserves a woman. If you don’t go get that, I will.”
She shuffles closer, curling against my side and rests her head on my shoulder. I wrap my arms around her, my hand threading through her messy hair and my fingers run circles on her scalp soothingly. I feel her body go limp, peering down at her as I watch her eyes grow heavy.
