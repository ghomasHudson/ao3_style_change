She then stood up and in one fluid motion fell to her knees in front of Cas. She reached out with her hands and undid his belt, unzipped his pants and pulled at his trousers to expose himself to her. She stroked him with her hand a few times then dipped her head and took Cas into her mouth. This was something he had never experienced before. Her mouth was so hot, wet and as she moved up and down on his length he could feel he sucking in her cheeks to create a vacuum. When she got to the tip of his penis she swirled her tongue around the head, he had to make her stop or he knew he would climax right then and there. It felt like nothing he had ever felt before.
Bobby saw his oldest son with happy tears streaming down his face looking at the two individuals in front of him, not even trying to hide it from the rest of the world. Dean was lost in the two faces of his two loves, Bobby wondered if the boy even saw or heard anything or anyone else at this moment. The three of them stood in a circle holding hands in front of Pastor Gideon staring into each other’s eyes. Gideon spoke again, “It is rare in this world that a person finds a true soulmate, someone they were destined to spend their existence with but even rarer still is when that soul is split into three and sent throughout the cosmos to find their other parts. That is exactly what we witness today, the joining of the eternal, the hunter and the magic that completes them both. Despite every trial, every setback Dean and Cas have found each other, time and time again, growing in friendship, respect and love together. Then the spark that was missing to fuse them together forever arrived with a prayer from a lost soul, Ashby. Dean, Ash and Cas, we all want you to know how loved, respected and cared for you are, we are all ecstatically happy for the three of you. It will not be an easy road for the three of you, however when has anything ever been easy for a Winchester?” Gideon laughed and the wedding guests joined in.
Their lives had been happy through the year and a half and Ash liked to think she had something to do with it. They ate, lived, hunted and played together. The road was theirs and they always had the bunker to go home to and if you asked Dean or Sam they would tell you that they had never been so happy. One of their favorite things to do after a hunt is to find whatever dive bar nearest to the hunt that they just finished and have a few drinks, shoot some pool or throw some darts. This is where the whole clan, Dean, Sam, Eileen and Ash and Cas found themselves on a cold, wet night in December somewhere in Ohio just a few days before Ash’s 42nd Birthday.
Cas moved his kisses down Ash’s neck kissing his way down to her breast. Ash’s eyes locked with Dean as Cas slipped the strap off of Ash’s left shoulder allowing him access to her left breast. Cas took her nipple into his mouth and began to lick and suck at its taunt peak. Dean saw Ash’s eyes close for just a second and then he heard Ash’s voice in his head as she extended an arm out to him, “Come to us Dean, we want you with us.” Cas must have heard as well because he stopped what he was doing and turned to look at Dean as well. “Come here handsome.” Was all that Cas had to say and Dean was practically launching himself at his lovers. When he closed the few feet gap between where was sprawled on the bed and where Cas and Ash were at the foot of the bed, Dean was breathing as if had just ran for his life.
Dean responded in kind but then once he started to step back, Cas caught the look in Dean’s eyes. Dean grabbed Castiel by the nap of the neck and crushed Cas to his body, kissing him hungrily. Cas was so engrossed in the kiss he almost forgot to breathe, something his body now needed, he broke Dean’s kiss to gasp for air. Cas then heard a musical little laugh coming from his side. Ash was there beside him and Dean. She threw her arms around the both of them. Her smile made her eyes twinkle and her dimples become pronounced. Pregnancy was good on Ash, Cas thought, he didn’t know how it was even possible, but it made her even more beautiful than the last time he had laid eyes on her. She batted her lashes at him and blushed. So she could still hear thoughts, good to know, thought Cas. "Yeah but can you hear me Cas?" Ashby spoke straight into Cas's brain. He nodded his head. Cas then took his turn kissing Ash as well, next thing he knew he, Dean and Ash were making love to one another. The bond they shared just as strong and profound as ever. It was 2 am in the morning once the Winchester Thrupple got settled after their much needed, long overdue reunion. Dean on one side of the bed, Cas on the other and Ash in the middle. Ash was a snuggler, Cas and Dean were coming to realize they were too so the close quarters were ok but they all agreed that with Ash pregnant they were going to need a bigger bed. Of Course, there was going to be another period of adjustment for them, a lot more thigs more important than sleeping arrangements to work out. They would have to learn to live as three individual’s madly in love with one another but they could see it through together, with their new start.
Dean stopped on the second step up the stairwell heading up and out of the bunker, he turned around slowly and looked at her with a softer expression than she had ever seen on his face, except for in Cas’s memories, of course. Ash moved toward the hunter, stopping at the bottom of the stairs. She looked him softly in the eyes and told him, “I just came to realize, I know why you are reacting this way. I understand, I really do but here is not the time or the place to talk about it, OK? We can do that later when you’re ready.”
Well, she was 42 now and way too old to get pregnant, in fact the last time she had went to the gynecologist before Cas had found her they said was close to menopause. Also there was the fact that she was not able to have children again after chemo when she was 29. It sterilized her, she no longer created viable eggs. Alan and she had went through a long painful process of trying to get pregnant again only to have the Doctors tell them it was absolutely not a possibility without IVF and a donor egg, maybe not even then.
Unlike Cas this was not Ashby’s first wedding. That had happened over 20 years and a lifetime ago. She had married Dean in a small ceremony at the bunker when she was about 6 months pregnant with DJ. Cas and Dean wanted to wait until Cas could legally marry both of them before having a big wedding. To be honest she would have been just find with a ceremony at the bunker for the three of them, just surrounded by close family. However, Castiel and Dean wanted everyone they had ever known (and who were still alive) to be at their wedding. So Ash said yes to the whole thing to make her husband’s happy.
Ash as a little girl talking to a young boy with dark circles under his eyes, who no one else could see. Her singing on her Pa Schmitt’s radio show with her uncle Robbie on Sundays mornings. Her playing softball as a child, running and falling over her own feet because she was so pigeon footed. Her and her little sister in the back seat of her Moma’s 1965 Mustang watching the cars behind them. Losing her Grandmother at 9 year old, feeling rejected by her Dad’s side of the family. Coming home from Elementary school and doing chores around her Grandma and Grandpa Jenkins laundromat. Having to move away from her home to follow her Moma to a new life with another husband. Her Moma’s bought with cancer and how scared she was that she would lose her like she lost her Grandma Schmitt. The abuse and bulling that surrounded her, the self-loathing, how she saw herself as ugly and fat. Playing softball and learning to weight lift. Losing her Dad at age 18, watching him wither, and caring for him while he fought cancer. Her friends, her first love, her first lover and then her husband. Nights of love, the long wait for a child, the joy of being a Mommy, and a wife.
Wrapping his head around how this all was going to work still gave him migraines but Dean was willing to take it slow and let everybody get to know each other better. Thanks to Cas they all knew each other’s life stories and how they felt about one another but still he wanted to take it slow. Cas and Dean had still not figured out how to keep Ash with them. It was becoming increasingly clear that their time with her was limited to a few years at most, but Cas was determined to find a way to keep her spirit, her consciousness with them for as long as he could.
Ash told Cas to let her handle Dean as he not too gently pushed them out the door of the diner. Cas told Ash that he felt that it was best for him to take care of it but Ash insisted that she had this. She had worked around gangsters, druggies and murderers and some of the worst of the worst the human race had to offer. That she knew how to handle herself with Dean Winchester. God, she loved that boy, she loved her Angel but sometimes it was hard being stuck between them when they argued and she did not have her own body to get in the mix and speak her mind. She knew Cas listened as she talked to whomever and she listened when he did but sometimes she just wanted to talk to them both at the same time and not have Cas have to translate for her and vice versa really.
I am still losing time, I know it! I can only set back and wait for someone to call for me, for someone to be desperate enough to call out to the unknown. I am beginning to give up hope, will I be floating through the ether forever? Sam and Dean could be old men by now for all I know. Jack, he must have forgotten about me by now. I know they are alive because I would know if one or all of them had met their final end. If that were the case I would just ask for entrance into their heaven, I think it would be granted. I have to hold on to the memories and pray that someone will call soon. I must not lose hope!
You see, one of the reasons I prayed to anyone listening was I had lost my family. My Momma, my Husband, my only child, my Son and almost everyone I ever loved to that durn virus that swept through the United States and Canada last year. “So Cas gives you control at times?” Sam asked. “Yes, most the time I am happy to let him take charge but at work it is me who runs the show. I mean can you imagine him in a Memory care unit, he would be sapping his grace plumb out every day trying to heal EVERYBODY! I mean, I know he means well but he taxes himself too much. I’m sure you boys know what I’m talking about.” Ash replied. Sam just simply nodded his head up and down in agreement.
Cas makes his way across country to Kansas, where he has to lean on Ash's experience as a nurse and waits for the boys to reply. They do after a month.
Dean punched the horn on the Impala, jerked the car to the side of the road and slammed on the brakes. “Ashby Renee Mullins, how could you EVER say that? Don’t you get it, do you? When I called you two “My Heart and Soul” back at the diner I was not kidding, you are my Heart and Cas is my Soul.” “I know Dean,” She cut him off, “I know you love me but you’re not attracted to me, I know your type and I am not it! God Dean, just admit it already. Let Cas get another vessel, I will still be here, I’m not going anywhere but, at least that way you can make love to Cas.” Once again Cas was screaming at her, “Ashby,” Cas growled, “don’t you do this to me, I don’t want you to leave me, I don’t want another vessel, I love you!”
He saw the man tied to the chair, it was more than he looked just like Cas, the voice, his mannerisms, exactly the same, unsettling to say the least. If this wasn’t Cas, this person was a dead man, hell, even if it was Cas, the looks that Dean was giving him did not bode well. Sam jumped from his musing as his Sissy fell to her knees into the man’s lap. Dean fell beside her. Sam could not look away as both his brother and Ashby kissed this man in a very passionate, intimate way as if they were the only people in the room. Sam had never seen Dean kiss a man before but obviously he had kisses Cas many times because he kissed him like he knew exactly what he was doing.
Pastor Gideon spoke once more, “Now it is time for more of the formalities, please Ash repeat after me,” Ash repeated, “I Ashby Renee Schmitt do take this man Dean Winchester and this Angel Castiel to be my lawfully wedded spouses, to have and to hold, for richer, or poorer, in sickness and in health, to cherish and adore, to honor and support, both now and for all time and eternity.” The pastor then had Castiel, then Dean repeated the same litany. Except for Dean, of course who had to throw a few sexies, dudes and babies in there for good measure.
It had been 6 weeks since Ash had announced that she was pregnant, the morning sickness had gotten better if she ate as soon as she woke up in the morning. Dean always made sure she had peanut butter and crackers made and stacked on a plate on her bedside table with a glass of water. He still worried about her and the baby but the weight that she was gaining now made him relax a little.
Dean sighed heavily, “Of Course I’ll drive you to work! Yeah, I did promise her I would help Sam and her clean out the nest in Louisville. Are you sure you just can’t come with us? We’ll be gone for at least four days.” Sam heard her say, “No Sweetie, we can’t, not this time but Cas and I have discussed it and we are going to put in our 2 weeks’ notice and request that we be placed on PRN status from now on. That is unless we need the money, in that case we can continue to work at the nursing home.” Sam spoke up “No Sissy, we have what we need. The Men of Letters legacy money is more than enough to keep us comfortable. I think having you and Cas with us all the time will be great. Right now you need get you some food and watch the new Father Ted episode. ” “Yeah, Bubbie that sounds great. Let us go get dressed first.” She replied and turned to go out the door but did not leave until she had given Dean another long kiss and hug.
It was actually Ash’s soft voice that spoke to him on their second day together, that he should start looking for his family. They had waited long enough to be reunited with Cas and that when there is love, when there is family you move the earth to get to them, to help and nurture them. “Wow.” Cas thought this spirit that had called to him was already a Winchester even though she had never met his family before. So he took out her cell phone and started dialing numbers. Knowing that one of them would be one of Sam or Dean’s phones that were currently in use.
Sam noticed that Ash was chewing one minute then stopped, she was looking up from her bowl of chili and cornbread eyes fixed straight in front of her, then she muttered in her sweet drawl, as she met Sam’s eyes,“Uh,oh, Bubbie now we’re in for it!” Sam turned his head to see his older brother rage walking toward them a frantic look in his eyes, Sam rolled his eyes. This was NOT going to be fun at all! Sam stood up and but himself between Dean and Ash and Cas. “Look Dean don’t freak out, everything is ok…we are all OK!” Sam saw Dean raise his hands and place them palm side up, an offering that said, “Hey, I’m cool, your cool, we’re cool.” He sat in the both beside Ash and Cas and threw his arm around their shoulders. He leaned down and gently placed a kiss on their lips avoiding the split on the right side of their lower lip.  This was a shock but a relief to Sam because he had never seen his brother do anything but hold their hand or kiss them on the top of their head. He was glad they could share that kind of affection.
He had removed his grace from Ash 9 weeks ago and with very few exceptions most hours out of the day he could hear Dean and Ashby call out to him. They were hurt, Dean angry and Ash feeling guilty and lost. Cas’s only peace came from the knowledge that they had each other. He had to hold onto that, he knew that he may have killed the happiness that could have been between his Hunter, himself and Ashby but he had to make the move. He had to find a way to save Ashby and still be with both of them for as long as they both lived and afterwards as well. Ash was strong, more powerful than Cas, Dean or even Ash herself had ever imagined. She was not weakening as quickly as they suspected she might but she was still weakening, her soul was weakening from the connection her and Cas shared. The fact that the two could exist in one body mostly independently was unheard of, literally. In the millennia Angels had been taking earthly vessels never had there been a bond like theirs.
and all set down around the map table. They all set in uncomfortable silence for several minute until Sam is the first to speak up. “So..uh..Cas what are you going to need? I mean your old clothes don’t fit and we don’t have anything in..um..your size, do we need to go shopping?” Cas then replies, “No I have all I need back at the apartment in town. I have two sets of street clothes for our days off of work and 9 sets of scrubs that we wear while on duty.” Wait,” Sam interjects, ”You can’t go hunting in bright blue scrubs Cas, I mean, you will stick out like a sore thumb!” Dean immediately starts shouting in an angry voice, “What the HELL Sammy, we ARE NOT taking her, er...him, oh hell…them on a hunt! He rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, trying to stave off the headache that threatens to become a supernova of a migraine.
Cas spoke up, “Dean, would you mind coming out from there for a bit? I need to talk to you and ash together.” “Dean was so caught up with what he was doing that when Cas spoke, he jumped dropping his wrench, Ash could hear it clang on the floor beside Dean. “Dammit Cas, Angel, you scared the crap out of me! Dean huffed but pulled himself out from under the truck. He looked up and his gaze instantly softened when he took in the Angel before him. Dean grabbed a rag and began wiping his hands and face, both of which were splattered with oil and grease.
Cas opened his mouth to meet Dean’s tongue with his, Dean didn’t know what to do really but just kept kissing Cas. Even in this male body Cas aroused him in a way no other person ever had, well not until they had found Ashby, at least. Dean realized in that moment it didn’t matter what form Cas took, male, female, it didn’t matter. He would always love and want his Angel, his Soul. With that thought Dean pressed Cas up against the log wall of the cabin, pressed his body up against the shorter man and intensified his kiss.
Sam was walking quickly, holding a small child that did not look too happy about what was going on at the moment. Dean’s heart swelled with pride, that child was his son, his name was Dean Winchester Junior but they just called the green eyed boy DJ. He was 14 months old now and a hand full, of course he was, he was his son and a Winchester after all. He began crawling at 5 ½ months and was walking by 10 months old. By the time he was 1 year he was talking in full sentences. Dean could hear him now Crying, “Unc Am, Unc Am, I wan my Dada.” Mom, Dad, I really wish you could be here right now, I miss and love you guys so much. I hope that you both are proud of your sons and the life we have built.
Cas laughed, “Yes, I know this and neither am I, although Ash has helped me learn what it means to feel and how to process emotions. More than I was ever able to with Jimmy Novak’s body. I learned a bit every time I was turned into a human but Ash knows how to open my sense of self and teach me what I am capable of. We can learn Dean, together, Ash is willing to teach you as well.” Dean, looked his Angel in the eyes and nodded. Dean spoke, “Cas, I know you know her really well and love her too but I have just met her and she seems like a great gal but she’s a stranger.” Cas took this as a turn to nod their head. “Here Dean, let me show you, who she is.” Cas placed a hand on Dean’s forehead and a rush of images, emotions and memories flooded the hunter’s head.
Dean looks at her as she tries to set up, he tries to help her but she has already set herself straight, all be it she does look a little green around the gills in Dean’s opinion. She takes a long deep breath and looks up at the two men before her and simply says, “I’m Ashby Mullins but please call me Ash.”
Dean was beginning to wonder how he ever could thought of Ash as plain. He realized one day about a month or so after their first kiss, while they were working out in the bunkers training room that she was gorgeous, the smile, and the eyes that sparkled with intelligence and wit, and all those curves. He had never been what he would have probably called in his youth a “chubby chaser” preferring small tight bodies and classically beautiful women. However, he loved them both and began to notice how strong their body was. He began to notice how they could lift and push and move in ways he had never seen another woman move. How their full ample breasts felt against his chest when they kissed and how those soft curves and the firm underlying muscles of their arms felt wrapped around his waist in a hug or how solid their legs were as they straddled his lap when they made out. Oh and how they made out!
Sam had taken to watching TV with Ash, they both loved Dr. Who and Torchwood. They also loved watching what they called “Britcoms” together. Dean just did not get the humor in those shows but they made Sam and Ash happy and thus Cas and Dean were happy. Ash and Sam’s bond had started to grow and Sam even taken to calling her Sissy, every time his did Ash would give him the most beautiful, brilliant smile. She in turn started to call Sam Bubbie or Bubba and it always made Sam grin like an idiot. They were building their own version of family once again and they all were happy for once.
Sam replied, “Don’t be such a drama queen Dean, they are my family too you know! Cas knows better than we do how to handle himself and Ashby is a tough gal, she has been through almost as much as we have in her life.” There several conversations over the last month or so that were similar to this. Despite these heated debated, Sam did what Sam thought was right and took them on an easy hunt. Cas even let Ash take the lead.
Cas had been looking for a way to find his body since he fell in love with Ash and that need only intensified as Dean and Ashby had fell in love as well. Dean and he were able to spend time together in the cabin between worlds but only at great cost to Ash. The time Cas and Ash spent there was also risky to her. She never faltered, never complained but it taxed her. This was something Cas could not allow, there had to be a way for all three of them to live their lives together and not sacrifice Ash in the meantime. So Cas began to search for a way to get a body of his own. A year and a half ago he had contacted his brother Gabriel and asked for his help and Gabriel was happy to help.
It took them 10 minutes to travel what would have taken them at normal highway speeds about 25 minutes, to get home. Dean was basically on auto pilot at this point because all he could think of was how long he had waited for this. He could feel the want and need coming off of Ash and Cas in waves. He needed to let Cas know that wanted him too. So he said a silent prayer to Castiel and got an answer right away. “Make love to her tonight, I will be there, I will feel it. I want to feel her too you know, I want to feel you, I want all of us to complete the circle. I will find a way, just give it time. ”Cas told Dean in his head. This only made Dean more desperate to get in the bunker to his room, hell, it was going to be hard for him to get them through War Room or hallways without possibly making Sam very uncomfortable.
Dean was roused out of his musings by DJ yelling, “Dada, Dada!” Sam handed him over to him and jokingly said. “This little demon was insistent that he see his Daddy, because obviously Mommy, PawPaw Bobby, Papa, Uncle Sam and Aunt Eileen are not good enough at the moment.” Dean laughed, he knew how much his brother loved his nephew, and said “Well, hopefully he’ll go with Uncle Gabriel for a little  before the ceremony, I bet he’ll eat up anything Gabe has to give him, he loves his “Unc Gabby.” DJ hearing his favorite Angelic Uncle’s name spoken brought a bright smile to DJ’s tear streaked face. “Unc Gabby, here, Unc Gaaaabbbbyyyy, here!” DJ chortled. Sure enough the Mookie SOB showed up as he always did when DJ called, day or night. “Woah, there buddy, Uncle Gabe was in the middle of chatting up a waitress.” Gabe huffed in mock exasperation, but quickly changed his tone when his nephew made a scowl. “Oh Buddy boy, don’t you worry about it you know all you have to do is holler and Unc Gabby is here for you, besides Daddy needs to finish getting ready to marry your Mommy and my Crazy little Brother, your Papa.” Gabe grabbed the baby from his Daddy and then promptly disappeared.
Dean didn’t really notice, he really wasn’t paying that much attention, his focus was on his Heart on the stage, when someone sat down beside him. “Hey, there handsome, haven’t seen you around here before.” She said. Dean looked over at the pretty red head setting beside him. She was a good looking gal, Dean thought, heck he probably would have taken her back to whatever crummy no tell motel he was staying at, that is once upon a time before Cas and Ash had found him. She was drunk and Dean could tell what she wanted. He politely responded back, “Yeah, just passing through with my family, heading back home.” “Oh, you travel often with your family, that’s nice, well what you say we get out of here for a while? I’m sure that you wouldn’t be missed, seems like everyone you walked in with is busy doing something.” She slurred at him. “No thank you, we are just about to leave. Here let me pay for your next drink for the offer.” He said as he waved the bartender down. “Oh, thank you handsome.” He heard her say. He was about to tell her something like no problem when she was right on top of him.
Dean looked over, rolled his eyes and took his hand out of his jacket pocket and grabbed Cas’s hand. Dean once again looked them in the eye and peered deep, shifting forward so that their noses were almost touching. Dean took only a second longer before he looked away again, scrunching “Oh Cas, Dude, why did it have to be a fat chick, couldn’t she have been hot or something, I mean, son of a bitch, what the hell!” Sam looked back and hollered at Dean, “Dude, that is uncalled for! There is nothing wrong with Cas’s new vessel! Besides, it sounds like Cas’s is half in love with her as it is, you better watch out or he might just smite you.” He said with a kind smile and hearty chuckle. It’s good to have you back, Cas. I knew it was you as soon as I saw your eyes, they are exactly the same, how is that even possible, I mean not just the presence behind them but the color and everything? It is kinda freaky though.”
Cas huffed, “Her name is Ashby Mullins, she prefers to be called Ash, she is a gentle soul with a will of iron. She may have walked different roads and taken a different path than you but she is just as much a warrior as the two of you! Yes, I have changed because of her, she can interact with me in a way that no vessel ever has been to before and if you two do anything to harm her soul, her spirit I will SMITE you!” With this both Winchester’s actually gulped at the ferocity of their voice, the smooth, sweet Southern tones and the force of angelic power combined with the “Nurse Mullins mode” voice to make the hairs on their neck’s stand up. In fact, Cas could see the hairs on Dean’s forearms standing on edge right now.
Dean is moaning into her mouth as she kissed him while she stretches him out, her nimble fingers brushing against the bundle of nerves that curve inside Dean. He knows that she can find it easily, because she has with him many, many times. Dean is hard and throbbing so Cas reaches down and begins to gently stroke him, making him buck hard on Ash’s hand. She looks up at Cas and says in a husky voice, her accent still lilting, “I think he’s ready for you Angel.” “Are you ready Dean?” Cas asks. “Yes, oh yes, Angel, yes.” Is Dean’s reply.
It had been 6 months since Sam and Dean picked up Cas and Ash at that bus stop outside of the nursing home and making out was all it ever was. Dean wanted more and knew Cas did but Dean was still worried about Ash wanting to be with him in that way. He knew that she loved him and now he wanted her as much as he wanted Cas but he was the one who would be the one to push away before his body and mind were beyond the point of no return, which seemed to be happening with more and more frequency.
The poor soul is a woman, with light, fine brown hair and brilliant blue eyes, a soft round face that makes her look younger than she actually is. I can tell by looking down into her soul that she is a kind, loving person, who has dedicated her broken life to serving others. She prays, “Whoever can hear me, if anyone even cares anymore, I am in so much pain, I can’t live through another day with this. I need relief but I can’t bring myself to just let go. I want love, I want a life, I want to be accepted and loved but that is too much to ask. At least it seems like it, god, I don’t know what else….”
Cas stepped in then and kissed Ashby, he wrapped his arms around her and held on for dear life. He had never felt like this before. Sure he had his share of sexual encounters but this was different, Ash filled him with wonder, with love and with hope like no other human ever to exist save for Dean Winchester. Dean was right, she felt, smelled and tasted divine. Castiel was unsure what to do next, he didn’t know how far to take the kiss, or where to put his hands that was acceptable to Ash. It was as if she could read his thoughts because she stepped back from the kiss for a moment to look Cas in the eyes.
Once outside in the parking lot, Ash is shaking her hand. She then says, “Cas says it’s not broken just bruised with some strained tendons, but dang that hurt.” Dean had her in his arms kissing her before she knew what was happening. He broke of the kiss, “Wow, Ash that was one hell of a punch! My baby don’t that shit off of nobody.” Sam and Eileen were now out in the parking lot coming up to the Impala. “Hey guys, did you get a load of your sister in law Sam? She told that loud mouth in there who was boss, didn’t ya Ash?” Ash just looked at him with a baffled look. Sam replied, “Real mature there Dean!” “What? It was awesome, I’m in love with one sexy, badass lady and a friggin Angel! How could it be any better?!” Dean replied. Eileen just shook her head at Dean and signed, “You do realize Dean that you just proposed to Ash and Cas in the middle of a bar fight?”
Looking once again Dean looked at the person in front of him straight in the eyes and just held the gaze, surely attempting to make this fluffy, little woman flinch, it was either that or it was Dean’s attempt at staring straight down into the soul their new passenger. Either way, Cas did not flinch and Ash’s body remained open and relaxed.
She stepped close to the man reaching her hand to touch his dark stubbled face. The man visible leaned into the touch, closing his eyes and sighing, turning his nose as if to breathe Ash in. Dean did not like that one bit. “Hey Prev, if you sniff my wife again like that you won’t be able to smell ever again, I can promise you that.” Dean informed the man. The man straightened and opened his blue, blue eyes and stared at Dean with such intensity, once again the twist in his gut and the shock down his spine. Ash spoke then, “I am going to listen to your thoughts, do not try to block me, do not try to lie, I will know and you will not like what happens when The Winchesters are lied to.”
Ashby began to cry, her face and lip hurt now and she was not about to let Cas heal her right now, she was too upset. As the tears began to flow in earnest, Dean opened the Impala’s door and jumped out. He ran around to her door and threw it open, she knew what was coming; he was going to throw her out of the car. She unbuckled the seat belt and with great sobs of remorse and loss she grabbed her small duffle bag, she stood up and went to step past Dean, but he was there like a wall in front of her, arms braced one on each side of the door. He was staring at her with such intensity it hurt her to look at him but she did, she met his gaze and tried not to flinch. He grabbed her by the arms and crushed her in a kiss that was hot, needy, and full of electricity but tinged with desperation.
As he lay there on his back Cas laid down in bed beside him and began to kiss Dean, his hands running over the planes of Dean’s chest and stomach. As Cas kissed Dean, his tongue dancing in and out of Dean’s mouth, Castiel moved his hand to where Dean and Ash’s bodies met and began to stroke both Ash and Dean. Two fingers sliding against Ash and branching in a v to rub Dean on each side of his penis as Ash rocked back and forth on Dean. She placed her hands on Dean’s chest and raised up on her knees to allow access for Cas to touch Dean and Ash both but not breaking contact between the Hunter and his Heart. It was almost than Dean could stand, he was barley holding in, trying not to come so quickly. As if knowing what he was thinking, Ash spoke, “Dean Baby, let go, I want to feel you come inside me.” That did it! Dean came apart, his orgasm making his whole body shudder. He was practically screaming around Cas’s tongue. After a good two minutes of feeling himself pulse gush after gush unto Ash, he found himself softening and Ash moving off of him.
With these thoughts racing through Cas’s and  Ash’s and his head, Cas cleared their throat and asked Dean to please follow them to Ash and his room. Dean nodded his agreement and followed his best friend down the hallway. Dean couldn’t help but notice how Cas’s (well their) long honey brown ponytail swayed across their shoulders and back leading to a nicely rounded bottom and wide hips that swayed in the opposite direction of the ponytail. This physical form in front of him was far from the usual type that he found attractive but the physical presence that they projected was very warm and comforting to him. “Hell,” he thought, “it is Cas, that makes sense but why does Ash’s voice and presence have such effect on me? Cas has always had that effect on me and still does but her voice calls to me too. Ugg, listen to me I’m practically a chick myself with these stupid thoughts, get a grip Winchester.”
As they stepped out of the piles of clothing on the bedroom floor Ash stepped back and looked Dean up and down. The look in her eyes told him that she liked what she saw. Dean watched her face as her hands ran over his shoulders, chest and stomach. Her eyed dipped lower to take all of him, she made a little O shape with her mouth, reached out with her small hand and delicate fingers wrapping them around his length and began to gently stroke him, Dean started to fall apart. He grabbed her and laid her down on the bed taking a moment to take all of her in, trying to memorize every curve, the way her strong legs spread inviting him to come closer, the way her arms reached for him, and the delicious way her very full breasts heaved with the movement of her chest where she had been breathing heavily, from all the running, all the emotions and all the want and need. He couldn’t wait any longer Dean had to be one with this wonderful woman. He bent down to kiss her again as he took his hand and touched her most intimate places for the first time.
Ashby Mullins felt she had been on a rollercoaster tonight! She had been hunting with her family, taking down a nasty skin walker in the back woods of Ohio. Before tonight Ash would have told you that in her opinion nothing good ever came out of Ohio, well except for the license plates on Dean’s Baby, she guessed. Well, that certainly changed in a hurry tonight. Now as she stood there in the parking lot of a rundown karaoke bar with one of the two most gorgeous men in existence kneeled down on one knee in front of her and Cas, asking them to marry him, she was gob smacked, standing there with her mouth hanging open, unable to speak. She looked up from those mossy green eyes that she loved so much and looked at the others in their party, they wore the same expression on their faces.
“Cas,” she said, “I have waited so long to kiss you, don’t be afraid to touch me, to be with me. I love you Cas, I want to be with you too, that is if you want me?” a look of worry crossed her face for a moment as if she was not sure if she was going to like the answer. Cas honestly did not have words so he let his lips, tongue and hands do the talking. Cas, kissed Ash again letting all the desire, passion and love he felt for this woman flow out of him and into her as ran his hands over her back, her bottom and arms. She responded in kind grabbing ahold of him letting her hands roam.
Dean speed up his pace as she called his name. Wave after wave of her climax flowing through her, into her very soul, touching where she always felt Castiel when he gently told her that she loved her. She guided that feeling to where she knew he was and heard his gravelly voice echo in her head, “Oh Ash, yes, Oh Dean, yes, “she felt Cas stirring within her, filled her to overflowing and as she came again and again she could feel Cas’s grace pulsing right along with the waves that overcame her. She heard Dean calling her name again as his body reached the point where he could not hold back anymore either and orgasmed with her. Ash opened her eyes and looked at Dean, her hunter, one third of her soul and he looked deep into her eyes and said “Ash, my Heart, I love you!” Then he smiled this wicked, almost feral grin “Well, well, where you have been all my life? That was by far the most wonderfully intense thing I have ever experienced.” Then he started kissing her while he tried to slowly pull out of her still pulsing sex.
Dean woke up in such a good mood, he felt whole, he felt stable and loved. He felt like he deserved this chance to be happy, really happy for the first time in his life. He rolled over to look at his Heart and Soul, Ash was still sleeping, her honey brown hair a mess, her small lips pink, just begging for Dean to kiss them till they were red and slightly swollen. He behaved himself and just gave her a kiss on the forehead and jumped up for a quick shower and then to fix his family breakfast. On the way out the door He prayed to Cas hoping that he would come give him a good morning kiss but he was silent.
Dean once again did as he was told and he sat up on his knees and lined himself up with Cas and pressed himself in. The tight, warm, slick feeling of Cas wrapped around him felt like a dream. He looked down at Cas, his Angel, he was muscular and strong, Dean did not have to worry about breaking or hurting him like he did some women he had been with. He took the lead and reached down to Cas with one hand, once again wrapped his fingers around Cas’s penis and began to stroke him in rhythm with the strokes he was giving to Cas. With the other hand he held Cas’s hip to better secure them together.
He want to try the projection process with Ash and Dean but knew that it would be tricky. Maybe, he thought, it would be easier with just Ash to start with. So on the same night Dean had his dream of Cas, Ash and the baby, Cas told Ash he wanted to try something, if she was willing. “Oh Cas, “she thought, “sure, what do you want to do?” He had her lie down on their bed and relax, taking deep breaths and focusing on the sound of Cas’s inner voice, the gravelly, deep rumble that used to come out of Jimmy’s body. At this time Cas’s essence projected his physical self into a dimensional space that he had created several years ago. He then he took Ash’s mind and projected her there as well. He was worried that it was going to be difficult but it was quite easy actually.
Dean loved to hear Ash sing so he made sure to find a bar that was doing karaoke that night. He would set at the bar or table closest to the stage and watch as she sang her heart out. Afterward she would come down and set down beside him so he could tuck them under his arm until Ash was called up again to sing. Right now she was singing on of his favorites Black Velvet, she had a huskiness and sultriness to her singing voice that was perfect for the song. Plus, it made Dean incredibly hot and she knew it. God, he loved this woman and their angel that shared her body.
Dean was so lost in thought that he did not even notice the diminutive angel cross the 3 of 4 feet between them and stare up into Dean’s face. “Shit,” he thought, “for a curvy gal she sure can be stealthy! Plus, Cas now has to look up to me even more than he did when he was wearing his old vessel.” This gave Dean a great amount of amusement and he even smirked, just a little. Although, thinking about Cas as something different but still the same as this Ash lady was giving him a headache.
Cas took another breathe, “Dean you and I have been in each other’s existence since I was created, we were meant to meet, I was destined to pull you beautiful, righteous soul out of hell. In fact, until I saw Ash’s and then DJ’s soul I had never seen anything like it. Even through the torture you endured in hell you soul was still strong, bright and when I reached down and pulled you out a part of me was left with you and a part of you became a part of me. We have been brothers in arms, best friends and lovers but now we are two thirds of a whole. I promise you that I will always stand beside you, I will always fight for you and I will attempt to make you see how amazing you are each and every day from now until the end of time.”
“I will not fight or lie to you Ashby, I just want to be home with my family, with my Hunter and my Angel. You know that is what you are, don’t you Ashby, you are my Savior, my Angel, it was your strength that got me through the process of re constructing my body.” The man said to Ash, staring deep into her eyes. Dean had to jump to catch Ash as she cried out and slumped to the ground, her head landing in the man’s lap. “Cas, Cas, it is you! Oh My Angel!” She cried out throwing her arms around his middle, tears streaming down her face. Dean was on his knees beside her in a blink of an eye, looking the man, looking Cas in the eyes.
As promised, five minutes later, the car Cas was anticipating came around the corner and stopped just of 20 ft from the bus stop pavilion. Ash, was quietly reminding Cas that he needed to breathe and that he might as well go introduce this new face to the two of the three most important people in his existence. So Cas stood up and straightened the royal blue scrub top and bottoms that were standard issue at the particular nursing home that they had been working at for that last month, which was fine with Cas, because they made these new eyes appear even a deeper blue then they did in any other color clothing. It was comforting to him to look in the mirror and see almost exactly the same color blue that he had worn with Jimmy Novak, looking back at him in the mirror.
Ash went to prop herself up on deans pillows when she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror on Dean’s dresser. Her hair was an utter disaster, her eyes were so bright and her cheeks were flushed and her lips were swollen from kissing Dean with his stubbly face. She hardly recognized the person in the mirror. She looked, well she looked positively glowing, like she was 25 years old again. She went to get out of bed and Dean firmly held her to his torso. “Where do you think you’re going?” he asked. “Well,” she replied “first of all, I need to go pee and secondly, I don’t know about you but, after the hunt and then making love, I need a shower. Do you have a bathrobe I can borrow?”
Dean and Ash made love again in the shower, they took their time and only stopped once the water had ran completely cold. Cas just sat back and let it happen. He tried to keep his own thoughts away from their time together but their emotions, Ash’s hormones and brain kept bringing him back to them. He watched through Ash’s eyes as Ash and Dean washed each other in the very cold water. He listened as to them talk as they were dressing for bed and making their way back to her and Cas’s bedroom. Ash and Dean were both exhausted and in need of rest, but Cas needed to talk to Dean. Ash kissed Dean Goodnight as they tucked each other into bed.
One morning Cas asked if they could spend the day in cabin between the worlds, he said that he was sorry for being so distant for so long but he had to do some research and thinking. Ash was more than happy to spend time with her Angel and agreed right away. Cas was in charge at the time and said, I need to go talk to Dean, Ash thought Ok, so what you talk to Dean all the time, Cas was still acting weird and it made Ashby nervous but she shielded him from these emotions as Cas walked down the hall, up the stairs and into the bunker’s garage.  There was Dean with his adorably bowed legs sticking out from under her and Cas’s 1948 Chevy step side pickup. He loved that truck almost as much as he loved his Impala, Baby, almost.
Dean had a nightmare, this was nothing new; Dean’s dreams were often filled with nightmares and blood, a reflection of the life he had lived since he was young. Waking up in a panic, covered in sweat and ready for battle was nothing new either but now he had Ash’s calming, loving presence to sooth him. She snuggled close all night long, every night and Dean wouldn’t have it any other way. When the nightmares did come she would hold him that much tighter and run her hand over his hair and back until the panic subsided. She had asked him about counseling, but he knew they would just think he was crazy and he didn’t like shrinks at all. However, since asking Ash and Cas to marry him and then finding out he was going to be a Daddy he had been seriously thinking about finding some help. Ash said she was looking for someone familiar with the life because she knew she needed it. Especially since Cas left them, flat on their asses, gripping to keep it together, clawing to tread water. Dean still longed for Cas, still missed him terribly but he was pissed as well.
He knocked on the door of Sam and Eileen’s room but they were not up yet so he decided to go ahead and get something to eat, they knew that was the plan anyway. So Dean headed to the little café down from the hotel they had been staying at while on this hunt. He was ordering the special, when a petite curvy figure came into the café, Dean’s heart leaped into his throat, only to have it settle back down where it was supposed to be in his chest when the lady turned around to face him, nope that was not the loves of his life. After Dean finished eating he just sat in his booth and drank a few cups of coffee and started browsing the internet, he really didn’t have anything in mind but then he found himself looking at jewelry for Ash and Castiel. Before he knew it he was looking at engagement rings. After looking at about 3 or 4 different rings, it actually hit him what he was doing. The scariest thing about it, for him was that he wasn’t freaking out about it. He knew then and there that he was a goner.
Once safely inside bunker Dean, Sam and Cas enter he war room he sees Jack setting at the large map table that dominates the center of the room. Jack jumps up and makes a bee line for Cas. Dean moves to step in but Sam grabs his arm and shakes his head at Dean. Sam the nods toward the Nephilim and whispers, "Wait." Dean then turns to look at his Son and his Angel. Jack already has his arms wrapped around the shorter, curvy, brunette in front of him. The boy is furiously kissing their cheeks and crying. "Papa! I am so glad you are home I have missed you so much! Daddy and Uncle Sam have been a mess with you not here. I kept telling them that you are fine and that you were just getting things ready for you to come back home, but would they listen to me, No!"
Cas grabbed a tube of lube that was in the drawer of the bedside table, and opened it up, handed to Dean and then laid on the bed. “Take your fingers and put a generous amount of lubrication on them, this will make the process more pleasurable and comfortable for us both.” Dean did as he was told. “Now take one or two of those fingers and insert them into me.” Dean swallowed hard and said, “Cas, Angel, are you sure?” “Yes Dean I am positive!” Dean took two of his lubed fingers and reached between Cas’s legs, and gently pressed them to his opening until they slid in and began working them in and out of him. This made Cas buck his hips, Dean could see that almost instantly Cas had gotten full on hard again. To Dean’s surprise so had he. Cas then instructed, “Now add another finger, oh, yes, oh, Dean, that is right.” Dean took this as a good sign and over a matter of minutes worked his way up until he had four fingers inside of his love. Then Cas still bucking himself against Dean’s hand said, “Please Dean, I believe I am ready for you now. Just apply so lubrication to yourself and insert yourself into me.” Dean thought to himself that no one but Cas could ever make no nonsense instructional about love making sound so damn sexy, but he did. He had anal sex with girls before, but he had never worked them open in this way, had never even seen it in any of his pornos, or if he had he didn’t pay attention to it.
It was a party to remember full of family, fun, food, and stories and dancing. While the reception party continued long into the night, the newlyweds left about midnight. Bobby and Jody had left much earlier with DJ so he could be fed supper and put to bed on time. They said goodbye to everyone and walked hand in hand in hand down the path to the main cabin, where they would spend the next few days. Their honeymoon of sorts. This was a special place for them long before the wedding but now it was a place they could always go to remember how it all started.
They spent another hour or so laying in the big bed together, talking and snuggling. There happiness and contentment are palpable to them all. Then they feel Ash begin to fade slightly, the potion reaching the end of its efficacy. Cas kisses both of his lovers again and “We will be together again, I love you both so much, Dean you are my hero, my hunter and Ash you are MY Angel! Just know that no matter what happens, I love you two. I will fight heaven, hell purgatory and earth to come home to you no matter what the odds. Ash I think you need to return all of us back to the bunker, I know you are tired.” “Ok, Castiel,” She says as she kisses him again. They all slowly find themselves back in their bedroom. Cas and Ash once again in one body and Dean holding them tight. The humans drift off to sleep and the Angel waits to make his move.
Dean caught a pair of cuffs that Sam had thrown at him and placed them on the man’s hands. “Keep real cool and don’t try anything, got it Buddy?” Dean growled out. “Yes, Dean.” The man said. His voice sending shocks down Dean’s spine and twisting his guts. The man sounded just like Cas! He went with Dean without a fuss, following ever order from Dean exactly. Once back in the War room, Eileen trained her gun on the man and Dean to pat him down. As Dean was going down each leg patting him down the man asked, “How far along is she, about 12 weeks?” “Hey, Buddy I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about but shut your cakehole.” Dean snipped. No weapons, no wallet, no cell phone just the clothes on his back.
Dean reached out and gently touched the screen, his eyes full of wonder. “He healed you, Ash, Cas healed you and as soon as he was gone you got pregnant with my baby. My child, Ash you are going to have my child, I’M going to a DADDY! Hell, yeah!” Dean got the goofiest grin on his face and it changed his whole body. His spine was straighter, his smile genuine stretching from the crinkles at the corners of his eyes to his mouth and echoed in his hazel green eyes. “Sammy, you’re gonna be a friggin’ uncle, I gotta call Bobby, he’s gonna be a grandpa! It is a boy or a girl? Wait it’s too soon to tell, right? Oh God, I hope it’s a boy, I don’t think this Daddy could take a teenage girl but then again she’ll be raised by a bunch of hunters so she bound to be bad ass, especially with you for a Momma.” Dean babbled at them all. For the first time in over a month, the Winchester family members who still living in the bunker laughed together. It was good.
Castiel could feel her soft presence in the back of his consciousness, she was no longer in pain, no longer lonely and she knew Cas would be there with her until she was ready to move on to her eternity. She was not quite there though because as soon as she had him with her, sharing her body and thoughts, she had to help him get back to his family. He shared all he was with her and she shared with him, it had already changed the both of them. He felt stronger and more emotionally centered then he had in a very long time. It was as if some of what she was, was becoming what he was and vice versa.
Somethings never change, Dean and Cas were still as pig headed about telling themselves what everyone who interacted with the pair knew for more than 10 minutes knew. They loved each other, Cas may not even realize it and Dean couldn’t fathom loving a “Dude” but he did. Dean loved Cas and that was all there was to it, in Sam’s opinion.  Sam did not really know but suspected that their feelings were romantic in nature and maybe even sexual. Which was for Sam hard in the early years of his and Dean’s relationship with Cas, because he never even imagines that Dean could be attracted let alone romantically love another man. But, then again, Cas was not a man he was an Angel and he guessed it didn’t matter what vessel Cas chose, or what vessel chose him, Cas would always be Cas.
Dean sat there made small talk, encouraged Ash to eat the rest of her food and even made her drink one more glass of water before looking at Ash and saying, “OK it’s time to get my Heart and Soul home for the night, we will be at our place Sam, you and I will talk later.” He stood up, gave Sam a short steady glare and then took Ash and Cas by the hand, pulled them up out of the booth and ushered them to the door with his hand in the small of their back. Sam was relieved that he didn’t make a scene but he knew eventually there would be hell to pay for putting as Dean put it, his “Heart and Soul” in danger. With a deep sigh Sam paid the tab for the meal and got in his car to drive back to the bunker.
Cas responded in kind, moving his hands down Dean’s body, pulling up on his outer shirt and untucking his undershirt. Dean felt Cas’s callused hands run over his back, leaving trails of gooseflesh where ever the roamed, it was almost enough to make Dean totally lose his senses. Then as he adjusted himself to press even closer to the Angel before him, he felt his very prominent erection rub against another bulge almost as big as his own rub against his hip. The sensation the friction made him and Cas both moan while kissing each other. Dean then slid his hand along Cas’s side and tentatively palmed Cas’s groin, he didn’t know where him being so bold came from, it was so new. Then again Dean had never been shy in the sex department and tended to take the lead. What he found was that Cas was just as hard as he was, so once again Dean took the lead and moved both hands down to help relieve the angel of his trousers.
Ash still holding on to Dean, lifted her head to look up at him and said with the biggest grin on her face, “Of Course Dean, I am sure you can manage that. By the way, Cas is ready to speak with you, if you are ready to talk to him.” Dean just nodded his head up and down but did not let go of her. She gave him a quick squeeze back and relinquished control over to her angel. Ash felt herself slowly pulled from the forefront of her consciousness to a warm, safe place where she felt totally at peace. She could still hear Cas and Dean talking to each other but she knew it was as friends who have missed each other greatly.  She also could still feel Dean’s arms around Cas and her shoulders, and that their arms are still around Dean’s waist. She just lets the warmth and peace flow over her and listens to Cas tell her to rest, he is here and loves her.
As he scrambled eggs, made toast, and cooked turkey sausage and turkey bacon (Oh, Dean is going to love that) he thought about how happy he was for his big Brother. He knew that Dean had been lonely for most of his life, just like him. He had Eileen now but he knew that she was hunter too so you never know what could happen. They loved each other very much and enjoyed spending time together when they could. In fact Eileen had taken to staying with Sam whenever she was not on a hunt of her own. Those were the best time for Sam, the times when his life felt most full especially when it had been Eileen, Sam, Dean and Cas. That had felt like home that had felt complete.
He had not told either one of them what he was doing, he knew he couldn’t because they would find it too dangerous and unnecessary. He knew that Ash was finding him more and more distant from her, hiding his thoughts, feelings and intentions from her, he hated it but didn’t know what else to do. The research and preparation was very consuming by itself but to block Ashby took extra. Once he left her body, he felt that sense of being untethered, floating through the ether once again until Gabriel could harness him into a focus that would hold him until the long ritual was done. There he had been for 40 days, the only way he knew was Gabriel informed him of each new day on Earth. Not that Cas really needed it he could hear his lovers call to him in their waking hours and only heard silence when he knew that must be sleeping. Even then their dreams could come to him as if they were prayers.
“So Dean, how are you feeling?” Sam asked. Dean cleared his throat and replied, “I’m kinda freaking out here, me married to anyone was laughable a few years ago. In fact if someone had told me that I would be married, with a kid, and happy, I would call them crazy, a liar or both. But, here I am married to Ashby, about to marry Cas and we have DJ, I’m happy man. I still wonder when the other shoe is gonna drop though, ya know?” Sam clapped him on the back and nodded his head vigorously, “I know exactly what you mean. We both have found happiness only to have it ripped away from us before it really started. I just have to have faith that finally the Winchesters have been allowed to be happy. We still are about the family business but this time we really are a family.” Sam and Dean sat on the cabin's porch and set in silence for sometime just enjoying each others company . When Dean next looked at his watch only 15 minutes before the wedding started so Sam and Dean went inside and combed their hair and straightened their ties one more time before heading down the path to take their positions for the ceremony.
As I said at the beginning of this fic, this is my first attempt at anything like this. I hope you all enjoyed it, and I would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to hear any feedback you guys have. I am going to be editing and updating this work, I have more to tell but I also want to tell DJ and Maryellen’s stories. What it would be like to be raised by these three misfits. We know without a doubt DJ will have powers, I mean come on he has angelic grace fused in his soul, what exactly does that mean? What kind of person does he grow in to. Plus, Maryellen even though just mentioned in the above paragraphs was a character that I wanted to fit into the world of Supernatural as a Winchester child.
When Dean thought he couldn’t take it any longer, Cas relented and stood up to look into Dean’s eyes. “Dean, I want you to make love to me now. If that is what you want.” Cas and Dean both removed their clothes as they made their way to the bed kissing as they went. Dean trying to reconcile what he should do with what he wanted to do. So he thought, what the hell, just roll with it Dean. “Yes, Cas, I want to make love to you too, but I don’t know how, not really.” Dean admitted Cas replied, “OH Dean, I have been doing research so let me show you how.” The thought of Cas’s “research” made Dean even harder, imagining Cas reading and watching porn to learn how to make love to him, it filled him with a sense of happiness that a few years ago, heck a few months ago he would have never expected to feel.
Cas, gave her a pensive look of his own but nodded a yes. Ash could feel herself fading from this space back into her body lying on her bed in the apartment. She then focused on the place that she just came from, and she felt him there. She could feel Cas waiting on her, she concentrated and moved her mind that way. She found him there, now dressed in his trousers and an undershirt. She was however naked still so she just thought of what she wanted to wear and she was dressed in boy shorts and a button down shirt. Cas looked in her direction and with an awestruck expression, moved toward her. “Ash, how did you do that, how are you here?” he asked. “I just let my mind search for a second until I felt your presence and then followed your presence back here.” She replied back.
That night Cas stepped Dean through the process, Ash laid her hand on Dean’s forehead and assisted Cas to the place between worlds where the Hunter and the Angel could be alone. Dean opened his eyes with in the walls of the cabin and straight in front of him was Cas, the Cas that Dean and Bobby Singer had met all those years ago. Dean couldn’t believe it! He grabbed Cas and hugged him for all it was worth. They stood there for several minutes just hugging one another. It was Cas who broke the hug, he stepped back just a few inch’s and then Dean heard him say “Dean, I’m going to kiss you now.” All the questions that Dean had just flew right out of his head as his Angel pressed his lips to the Hunter’s lips.
They made back to the motel sometime after midnight, Sam and Eileen going to their room and Dean, Ash and Cas to theirs. As they showered and got ready for bed Ash was back in control, Cas was preoccupied and for some reason he was being blocking Ash from hearing what he was doing. This was OK because Ash would do the same things at times, especially when she wanted to think about something nice she wanted to do for Cas when they stole their time together in the cabin between the worlds. However, Cas had never blocked Ash before but she just let it go. As she and Dean snuggled themselves into bed, Cas felt very distant, it had been such a long day and she was tired so she kissed her Hunter goodnight, prayed to her angel and fell into a deep sleep.
Dean took this opportunity to speak up, “Oh, sure Sweetheart, you were just gonna let him go, I know your type, set your claws into a guy and suck him dry, alienate him from his family and totally screw up his life. Well, lady you got another thing coming, you will not take Castiel away from me and my Brother, you hear me?"
When Cas had told them about a bit of Cas’s grace that was attached to DJ’s soul only minutes after he was born, they were floored. DJ being born 3 weeks early also was a side effect of the power within the baby. He had been fully formed, no problems breathing on his own and already moving in a way that baffled the medical staff. He started cooing after two days, by the time he was a month old he was holding up his head. The milestones of growth were always early for him but started to slow down as he grew.
After breakfast Ash and Cas and he about their day with Dean. They did some research, looking for a case and beginning to figure out how to tell everyone they loved about the engagement. They really didn't have to worry about what everyone thought because the were ALL happy for them. Bobby was the one who put it best. "Dean, so your little less of an idgit now, you finally got the guts to ask the Angel and my beautiful niece to marry you. Bobby loved Ashby, he thought she hung the moon and she felt the same way about her Uncle Bobby. It made Dean so happy to know that his family loved him and was happy for him. After Dinner Cas said that it would be a good time to go back to their room, he had a potion that they needed to drink to prepare for their time together. The effects of which should last 4 hours at least but maybe more depending on how Ash’s powers held up. They then laid on the bed holding one another and started the breathing exercises the normally did before entering their own little dimensional pocket.
“Dammit, Cas, why, why did you leave, we are barely holding on here!” He prayed. Of course he heard nothing. Sam and Eileen came in with the things Dean asked for and a phone tucked to Sam’s ear. “Here Ash, Bobby wants to talk to you.” Dean watched as she reached out a shaking hand and took the phone. “Oh… Un…cle… Bob…bb…bby,” she managed to sob out. Dean took the phone from her hand and put it on the bed and turned the speaker phone on. “Hey, Bobby, got ya on speaker phone now, tell me something good! He just left, he didn’t say a word to us, just left us.” His voice was shaking again, with an edge of anger bleeding through. Ash held his hand and stroked her hand up and down his back. Making little circles, trying to sooth him. He felt like such an ass, he knew Ash was a thousand, no a million times more wrecked by this, she and Cas had shared the same body for almost 2 years now, she really did have a chunk ripped out of her. For Dean it felt like just another relationship gone wrong. How could he have ever thought he could be happy? Ash was staring at him with a new depth of loss, “Dammit, Ash, no baby don’t you even get that into your head, you are my Heart, you make me happy, I just am being an Ass, I’m hurt, baby!” he thought at her. A wave of relief transformed her face a little. “I know you are Sweetie, I’m sorry I jumped strait to ‘Oh my God, I’m not enough, he’s only with me for Cas.’ Thoughts.” She thought at him.
“So your, Cas huh? If you are who you say you are, you know it is not going to be that easy! We will meet you five minutes after you get out of the nursing home. Yeah that’s right, we know where you work, live, eat and by this point we know where you shit. So don’t worry, we can find you, and if you ARE screwing with us you WILL regret it!” Cas sighed loudly, of course they wouldn’t be easy, they had been lied to, manipulated and hurt so many times and he had been gone for several months before he was able to find Ash. Cas replied back to the boys (with the encouragement of Ash, because she found the phrase and the story behind it “hi-larious”), “Ok, just don’t be too much of an Assbutt!” and then sat down on the bus stop bench and waited for the sound of an very specific engine to arrive.
Dean had the man set down in a chair and tied him to it, his wet clothes dripping onto the marble floor. Ash and Sam came back into the room, she looked pale and both of them were soaking wet as Dean and the man were. “OK, now tell us who you are, why you are here and why you look like Cas?” Dean barked. “Dean, it is me, I came home to you, you and Ash, our family.” The man calmly stated. Yeah well, we will be the judge of that.” Dean said. He felt Ashby’s hand touch his arm gently, he looked at her. “Dean Sweetie, let me talk to him.” She said “OK baby, but I’m not going anywhere.” Dean replied. “I never imagined you would.” She halfheartedly smiled.
“Oh Crap” is all that Dean can say before he literally leaps up on the table, jumps off of it to the other side to grab Cas as he falls to the ground. “Cas, Cas, wake up Buddy, SAMMY…., Sam places his hand on his older brothers shoulder and says. “I’m here, are they breathing?” “Yeah, yeah, breathing….”as he picks Cas’s slumped form off the floor and carries the unconscious being to one of the couches on the far side of the room. Dean and Sam both look concerned but it its Dean who truly looks like he is about to go into a panic attack. Thought visibly racing through his mind, thoughts of, “Oh GOD what have I done, Oh, Cas don’t leave us, don’t leave ME again!” When he gets Cas down on the couch, Cas’s eyelids flutter.
She was so hot and wet, her clitoris already like a hard rounded pearl, her labia plush and the opening of her vagina pulsing around his fingers as he slipped the index and middle fingers of his right hand inside of her. Ashby let out a muffled moan around Dean’s lips and tongue. “God Cas, she is perfect, isn’t she?” He prayed. The answer from Cas was a deep and throaty "Yes, Dean!" The tone of his own voice matched Cas's as he moaned Ash’s name and asked if she was ready for him. She replied, “OH Dean, yes.” Dean felt her spread her legs even further and he lined himself up with her and pushed himself in. It took all the self-control that Dean had left now not to come the first time he stroked in and out of her.
As he drifted off to sleep Dean, prayed to Cas and thanked him for his love and for bringing him his Heart. When Dean finally went to sleep, he dreamed of fishing with his loves. Except it was Cas the way he used to be, all trench coat, blue eyes and messy black hair. Ash was her usual, beautiful self, all curves and smiles, standing at the water’s edge, Cas was holding her in his arms. When they turned toward him he realized that she was holding a little bundle of blankets. Dean stepped up to the two people on the planet that meant the most to him and peered down into blankets he saw a baby with green eyes and honey brown hair. “Look DJ here’s Daddy!” She looked at Dean and asked, “Would you mind holding him Sweetie while I fix some sandwiches? “Hell yeah, give me my boy.” leaning down and kissing her on the lips, while taking the baby in his arms. As she walked away Cas came to stand beside him, taking his arm and placing it around Dean’s hips and drawing him to his side. Dean looked at Cas to see a look of utter happiness cross the Angel’s face. Dean then leaned down and gave Cas a kiss filled with love and passion. It was the best dream Dean had ever had.
Dean laid down in the bed and scooched in closer to her again, wrapping his arms around her and kissing her softly. “Don’t you ever think that I don’t want you Ash! I want you forever and always. You are perfection for me. Cas and I would be lost without you now. I know I was umm…being an...um….ass earlier but I just freaked out. I know you and Cas can handle yourselves, you can handle yourself even without Cas but the thought of losing you was too much. Then where talking about Cas getting another vessel and you leaving us, I don’t know. The thought of being with anyone but you and Cas just seemed, it just SEEMS wrong.” Dean said as he hugged her tight.
Finally! There is a call, someone at the end of their strength, wanting to give up but too afraid to take their own lives. They are searching, praying for a purpose some way to continue on, without the pain, without the loss and hopelessness they have felt for so long. I know their pain, I have been lost and at the end of my rope, it was the Winchesters who rescued me and I can try to rescue this suffering human.
The last steps of the ritual were almost complete, the time of “make or break” as Dean would put it was upon him. Either he would be back in his body able to go home to his fiancés or he would be no more. If it were the later he had given Gabriel specific instructions to go to the Winchesters and tell them what happened. To help make them understand why he did this, why he had to try. He did not want to “Die” but he could not risk not trying. As these thoughts swirled through his consciousness he felt white hot heat, painful, tearing waves of power rip through him and the last thought he managed to put together was “Ash and Dean I love you, I will see you soon, I hope.” He forced the thought out of himself and sent it in their direction hoping that they would receive his word, then there was nothing but black.
Cas and Ash reached Bobby and took them both by the arm one on one side and one on the other. They both looked at Bobby, eyes misty and sparkling with joy. When they all stopped at the end of the procession Bobby loos up to see the officiate Pastor David Gideon, standing  in the middle the platform, Dean and Sam off to the left, Jody and Eileen off to the middle right and Gabriel and Charlie off to the far right. Gideon began to address the audience. “Friends, family, hunters, angels and demons alike we are here to witness a very special occasion the joining of not two but three individuals in eternal matrimony. Who gives this bride and this groom away? “I Bobby Singer do, I place this woman Ashby Renee and this angel Castiel into the eternal care of my idjit of a boy Dean Winchester. Dean stepped forward, Ash and Cas both gave Bobby a kiss on the cheek, and then Dean took a hand from each of his loves.
It was a Thursday about a month after the last round of calls when Cas received a text from one of the numbers that he had called. Cas’s heart rate picked up, when he saw that there was a message from another number other the nursing home asking if they would be willing to work an extra shift. It seems it was almost a daily occurrence, to which Ash reminded him, “Well, Hun that is just part of being in healthcare, ALWAYS short staffed.” She was not exaggerating, it was long hours and emotionally draining at times but well worth their time.
Dean looked on in consternation at his little brother hugging this chunky, mousey haired, short woman (“I mean she barely comes up to Sasquatch’s arm pit!”, he thought to himself.) He knew without a doubt it WAS Cas riding around in a new vessel. But, the vessel was so different and the fact that the person who used to control that body was still rolling around in Cas’s head, made Dean nervous. Cas seemed enamored by this chick and that made him worry. Where had that come from, this dependence and care for this stranger who just happened to pray for someone to rescue them? Dean loved Cas in ways that he had neverput into words, he was his brother in arms, his best friend (other than Sam) and they both knew they had a “profound bond” as Cas would put it, but, had that changed the minute the woman Ashby Mullins had shown up?
Dean began to feel himself float away, this was normal for the process and he was used to it by now. When he come back to himself he was in the cabin standing by a big four poster California King sized bed. “Well, that’s new.” Dean thought. Usually the room was smaller with a full sized bed taking up most of the room. Setting on the bed cross-legged in his boxer shorts was Cas. Dean looked down and noticed all he had on was his favorite pair of black boxer briefs. So Dean flopped down on the bed and scooched closer to Cas. “Hey, there angel, My God I have missed your face, well especially those lips of yours!” Dean whispered.
Sam thought if looks could smite, Dean Winchester would be a pile of smoking ash or a pillar of salt right now because Ash was giving him a look that made Sam feel like a kid in the elementary school principals office.
The rain and lightning was so bad, he did not want Ash out there, afraid for her and his unborn niece or nephew. He knew that she was a tough, smart, resourceful hunter but she was also his family, so he trained his sawed off at the man in the coat and waited for instructions. When Ash told Dean to take the trench coat wearing man into the bunker, Sam took another look at Ash and knew she was about to throw up, pass out, or both. Sam stepped up beside her and held her hair as she lost what little was in her stomach. He walked her back in, making sure she was steady enough to stand on her own before he let go of her.
Cas had never leaned on the knowledge and skills of his vessel before and found it exhausting but fascinating, in fact he never knew he could interact with his vessel in such a way. He kept reminding Ash’s soul/consciousness that she could rest once he was home, however, she was insistent that helping him learn “a good bedside manner was wonderful” and that “she was not alone anymore,” so she was fine with the arrangement right now. Plus, she knew that this could not last forever, she would have to move on eventually or Cas would have to find a new vessel. Seeing that he was so fond of Ash, he did not want to do that if it was not necessary, or if that was what Ash wanted.
They met Eileen and Sam in the hall as they were heading to the security monitors. Dean and Ash signaled that they were going up the stairs, when Eileen made the most god awful sound out of her throat, like she was being strangled and Sam was white as a sheet. Ashby, must have heard their thoughts because her head snapped in their direction, stopping dead in her tracks and yelling, “CASTIEL!!!” Confusion, anger, and then relief flew over face and then she was off in a run again, heading up the stairs before Dean could even blink.
Cas was expecting Dean to close the back door and get into the passenger’s side front seat but, to Cas’s surprise he walked all the way around the Impala and opened the back driver’s side door and crawled in. His right hand still in his jacket pocket. Cas knew it most likely held a gun or an angel blade, but he was still able to keep a neutral expression on his vessels kind face. “A resting Nurse” face was what Ash referred to that particular facial expression. The tone of voice that accompanied that particular face was a no nonsense, authoritative way of speaking to the individual on the other side of the conversation. Right now Cas was using Ash’s “Nurse Mullins” mode, to let Dean know that they were “not bothered” by his menacing posture.
He was so caught up in his own thoughts that he practically plowed through Cas, who was standing in the open door of the room that Dean wanted Cas and Ash to call home. He instinctively wrapped his arm around Cas to steady the angel. Dean felt a warm current run through him as his arm cradled around the Angel’s back. Dean’s eyes trailed from the electric blue eyes to the small, pink lips that were slightly parted, he looked over the face of the person in his arms and saw his best friend, his fellow warrior and at that moment he knew that there was no denying that his feelings for this celestial being ran deeper than he could ever admit and it had been that way for a long time. He tried to deny it for so long but this time it was different, this time he was not going to let himself chicken out. Dean Winchester was going to tell Cas the truth. He didn’t know how or when but it had to be soon because it was about to kill him if he didn’t get it off his chest soon. Dean shook his head to clear his thoughts and after making sure Cas’s feet were firmly on the ground, dropped his arm to his side. Dean looked Cas in the eyes once again and said, “Um, sorry there Cas, didn’t mean to run ya over. Let’s go into the room and talk about our next steps.”
“Good morning, Bubbie, how did you sleep last night?” she asked. “Oh just fine, it got a little loud a few times, must have been a storm last night.” Sam teased. It had the desired effect though, Ash was blushing and smiling when she said, “I just wanted to say hi and bye before we got ready for work, it’s Thursday and they want us to work a double tonight so Cas and I will probably just crash at the apartment tonight instead of driving all the way back. Sweetie do you mind driving us in to work? Besides aren’t you two heading to meet up with Eileen in Kentucky?”
“There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you and Sam. Dean, you are my family but there is something I have never told you. Dean I love you…,” before Cas could continue Dean burst in, “Cas I love you too, your my family, my…” Cas then held up a hand and Dean stopped from continue to talk. “Dean,” the angel replied, “I didn’t even truly realize how deeply I felt for you until I lost my old body. It is more than just familial love I feel for you, I am completely and utterly in love with you. You are part of me, and I know that you could never feel the same way about…” Before Cas could finish the sentence Dean was on his feet and standing in front of Cas. He dropped to his knees to the floor and grabbed Cas by the shoulders putting his torso between Cas’s knees and pressed himself flush to their body and pulled the angel into a kiss.
He saw Dean flop down on the loveseat against the wall, head hung down with a hand on each side of his head elbows braced on each knee rubbing his face and hair. “Ash is sick, Sam, I think being without Cas is going to kill her, I want you to know that if we have to burn her body your gonna have to burn me too, right beside her. I won’t live in a world without her, not for a minute. I have lost my Soul, that we know can be lived through,” he laughed bitterly, “but Sam I can’t live without my Heart, I just can’t, not for you, not for Bobby, not for anyone.” Sam looked at his brother. Dean was not kidding, it broke Sam’s heart. “Not even for Cas?” Sam asked but before Dean could answer Eileen and Ash came the down the stairs.
Cas loved seeing both of his loves come apart like this, enjoying each other and him. Cas felt Dean moving in and out of Ash, both of them making the most delicious sounds. Cas had imagined this for a long time and it would never have possible except for the amazing woman that prayed to anyone listening, at the end of her rope and the end of her hope. He answered and he never would regret it. She was so strong, so beautiful, inside and out and powerful! Dean was a shelter of strength for him, the one constant since the day he felt Dean’s soul in hell all those years ago. Through all his faults, all his mistakes Cas knew Dean would always love him, he always had.
“God, I love you Ash, god, I want you, need you so bad right now, for now and ALWAYS.” Dean growled, his already deep voice thick with need as he began to kiss her as if he wanted to devour her. Ash responded in kind but after a moment she broke away from their passionate kisses. “Dean, Sweetie, If you don’t get me back to the bedroom I am going to have to make love to you right here, that would be quite a show for Sam and Eileen when they get home.” “Well, we can’t let them getting all jealous of the way you make me scream, now can we?” Dean replied a devilish smile on his handsome face, his eyes a stormy green. It was enough to make Ash remember her own name. He grabbed her by the hand and started leading her to their room.
“Ash, did you have powers before we met? You never mentioned anything other than you being able to sense feelings and see ghosts.” Cas said as he once again took her into his arms. “No, but since being with you I can do things I never knew I could. I have talked strait to Dean’s mind while you are in control. I vaguely heard the intentions of the vamp we took down a few days back, and now this. It has to be because of you and your grace, that’s the only thing that makes sense.” Ash replied. “So do you think once we separate, the powers will fade?” he asked. “I don’t know…wait, why would we separate? Is there something you aren’t telling me?” Her voice was getting louder and the pitch of her voice was getting higher. Cas pulled her to him once again and brushed his hand over her hair. “Shhh, don’t worry, I am not leaving you Ash, not yet, not until I can find another vessel, so we can be together like this all the time on the physical plane.” He kissed the top of her head.
Dean saw that tears now streaming down Cas’s face as well. Ashby kissed Cas like he was oxygen, like she was trying to inhale him to fill that void that was there since Cas left her alone in her own body and mind. She broke off the kiss and grabbed Dean, kissed him with the same intensity making his mind short out for a second. He watched as she gently all be it unsteadily stand up; Sam was there to help her find he balance. Dean looked Cas dead in the eyes and touched his face, he knew as surely as he knew his own name this was their Angel, his Soul. Dean grabbed him behind the neck and pulled him into a fierce kiss of his own, the feel of those slightly chapped pillowy lips made hot tears spring from his eyes. When he broke off the kiss, he stood up, stared into those electric blue eyes, and then punched Cas hard enough in the face to knock him backwards.
Dean didn’t want to stop kissing Ash but he could feel the inevitable happening, just like it always it did when he was kissing Cas or Ash, he was getting hard. He grabbed Ash’s small hand and pushed it to the bulge straining against his jeans. Her eyes went wide, her pupils so large that in the dim light of the street lamp he could only see a rim of cobalt blue iris. “Do you feel that Ash, that’s all you! Dammit, I’m just so afraid, I want all of you. I want to see, feel, taste and savor every soft curve you have, feel your strong muscles wrapping around me, we both know I want Cas, have for a long, long time but I want you too. You drive me crazy!” He crushed her in another deep kiss that made her moan deep in her throat.
I hate I am having to do this, I hate that someone’s family is going to lose a family member just so that I can be with mine again but I can’t leave my Family alone. They deserve to know what happened, they need to know I am still “alive”, that I have not left them, and that I not abandoned them when so many others have over the short and brutal years of their lives. To Sam and Dean of course, their three of four decades on this earth feel like an eternity, a bloody, brilliant life filled with too much pain and suffering and too little happiness. Jack is so young, so and has known very little but suffering and hurt, I have to try to bring them happiness, we can be happy again.
They went on dates and had nights in just like other couples except Cas and Ash shared the same body and had to take turns spending time with Dean. Cas and Ash each took their turn manning the wheel as it where throughout their day and Dean had long since been able to figure out which was which by body language and tone of voice. However, those deep electric blue eyes always were the same. Always calling to him in the most profound, deep, meaningful and at times needy ways. It was enough to drive him crazy at times. Yet Dean Winchester promised to be a good boy and wait it out, even if it killed him.
Dean almost never left her side, I mean he even followed her into the bathroom for a good two weeks until she started screaming at him to get out and give her some “Durn privacy.” Dean would post himself outside the door as sentry until she finished. Ash was a strong woman but she just like Dean lost and hurt, they clung to each other but were not able to make themselves do much more at first.  Between Bobby, Eileen and Sam they managed to keep them both fed and clothed. It was getting better, Ash even made biscuits, sausage gravy, veggie sausage gravy out of almond flower for Sam and her Great Granny Templeton’s Chocolate gravy (One of the weirdest and most disgusting sounding things he ever heard of until he tried it, it was sweet, thick and rich almost like a warm pudding) for Dean for dinner about a few nights ago. Dean loved the stuff and so did Bobby. Dean helped do dishes and they even turned on some music and Ash sang a little. It was a little more normal then it had been in weeks.
Ash came to stand beside Eileen, happy tears running down her sweet face. Eileen wrapped her arms around her and held her close to her. This is when Sam’s eyes jerked back to Dean and Cas. Cas was on the floor still tied to the chair, his head had just smacked the hard marble floor after Dean had hit him square in the jaw. Sam yelled his brother’s name and lunged forward as he saw Dean hit the floor hard with his knees and continue to punch Cas in the face. “Stop it, stop it!” yelled Ash. She had moved her body to be a physical barrier between Cas and Dean. “I don’t care how hurt or scarred you are it its NEVER, EVER Ok to hit your spouse, do you hear me Dean Winchester?” He just stared at her for a second, just blinking. She responded with a very forceful, “Dean, I said do you HEAR ME?” He nodded weakly, said “Yes, ma’am” and then began to move toward Cas again. Ash once again made sure she was between Cas and Dean.
Ash felt Dean fill her up for the first time, he felt so right but a wave of doubt filled her mind, "Oh Cas, this should be you, you’re the one he really wants.” Cas spoke to her in a whisper to her mind, “Oh Ash my love, we both want you.” With this she let herself release the worry and fears and be with one of the three parts of her heart, her very being. Oh, how she wished she could touch Cas like this too, but that was impossible, she told herself. She allowed herself to focus on the man buried deep inside her right now. She loved him as much as she loved Cas, she wanted him too, he was so sexy, so handsome, strong and giving. She never had to worry about her or Cas’s protection when he was around.
The next morning, Dean awoke to Ash and Cas’s side of the bed being empty. He got up threw on some sweat pants and a shirt and padded down the hall to the bathroom and then the kitchen. Cas and Ash, Sam and Eileen sat in the kitchen eating cereal and drinking coffee. Dean managed to make himself grumble out “Mornin’ everybody.” There were various levels of enthusiasm in the replies. Ash had just finished her frosted shredded wheat and asked Dean what he would like for breakfast. Dean really didn’t care, he was too busy thinking about what the rest of the day would be like but he knew he needed to eat. “Ha,” he thought to himself, “you know it’s gonna be good if it distracts ME from Ash’s cooking.” She was staring at him waiting for a response but he could tell by the twinkle in her eye that she had heard his thoughts. “Damn inconvenient being in love with a telepath, couldn’t even freak out in his head privately.”  That thought made him inwardly chuckle.
Dean felt himself getting even harder, although five minutes ago he would not have thought that was even possible. Ash moved to touch Dean, to stroke him, and said, “Lay down my Hunter.” He obliged. Ash pulled Dean’s boxer brief off and tossed them out of her way. She climbed up to straddle herself over him, lining herself up to plunge herself down on his length. This sent a wave of pleasure run up and down Dean’s spine, her warm, tight, wetness wrapping around him and when she began to move her hips to roll against him, he began to pant.  It felt so good, safe and warm. Love and need all wrapped up in one slick, silky movement.
“Well,” Dean started, “we will just have to talk to her about it. What are we going to do Cas, how are we going to keep her with us?” “I don’t know, Dean but we will find a way for all of us to stay together somehow. I will find a way.” Cas said as he looked longingly into Dean’s eyes. “I still don’t understand a lot of what I am feeling now but I know this you and Ash are a part of me I just can’t let go of, I can’t lose either of you. I want us to be together Dean, forever and always. I’m going to have sex with you now Dean, are you ready for me?” Cas asked, to which Dean replied, “Yes my Soul, I have waited a lifetime for you. Cas checked in on Ash to make sure she was still resting and she did all through the night as her Hunter and her Angel made love.
He broke the kiss with moan of his own, “Ash we need to get home now, get back in Baby, buckle up and hold on because I’m not going the speed limit to the bunker. If we stay here very much longer, I’m going to have to throw you on the car hood and make love to you right here.” Dean growled. “Ok.”, was Ash’s only reply. She did exactly what Dean told her to do and by the time Dean was buckled in they were flying down the highway at about 95 miles an hour or better. Thankfully for them no one stopped them for speeding.
Her name is Ashby Mullins, most everybody called her Ash. She grew up in the Southern part of the U.S., sharing time between Tennessee and Alabama, throughout her formative years. She however, had lived in Washington State for most of her adult life, but she still has a sweet, melodic twang to her voice when certain vowels passed her lips and when she became animated or upset the accent was even more noticeable. It was endearing to Cas and made him even more certain that he had chosen well, that she had been waiting for him to come lift her out of the mire that had become her life. All her family gone, her husband, her son, her sister and her Momma had passed during an outbreak of a nasty virus that turned people into monsters.
Dean handed him some clean sweatpants and a white undershirt. Dean had changed into a clean pair of pajama bottoms but he remained shirtless. His well-muscled torso smooth save for a trail of golden brown hair starting at his navel and disappearing below the waist band of his lounge pants. The pentagram tattoo on his chest had not changed, the freckled perfection that was Dean Winchester had not changed. Ash was wearing nothing but her bra and panties having stripped out of her other wet clothes but not taking the time to redress. Her abdomen had begun to round out just a little, a product of the tiny life growing with in her. Cas was so happy for Dean and Ash, he had hoped that after he had healed Ash over the time their time sharing her body that she and Dean would get this chance. It only took him leaving her healed body behind to make conception possible.
Sam looked at Eileen, took her into his arms and kissed her lightly on the lips. She stepped back to sign to him, “Do you think they are going to be alright?” Sam sighed and signed back. “Yeah, eventually but in the meantime it is going to be a hellish round of Dean vs. his emotional constipation and consternation.” Eileen just rolled her eyes and let out a high, exasperated snort and she turned around motioning her to follow her back to bed. He gladly retreated back to the safety of his love and his bed.
Dean continued to move his hips plunging deeply into her, each movement sending waves of pleasure through her whole body. But, as he moved his long, wide, callused fingers across her clitoris, she lost all sense of up or down. She came in a rush. With her fingers digging into Dean’s lower back and her own hips pushing up to meet Dean stroke for stroke, she forgot all about Dean’s brother Sam down the hall and let out a call of pleasure, panting and screaming her lover’s name. “Oh GOD Dean, yes, yes, baby, I love you so much! Oh my, oh my….uhh...hum.”
Dean reached a wide callused hand, thick but tapered fingers encircling Cas’s very hard, thick cock with them. He began slowly stroking Cas, touching him the way Dean liked to be touched. That was the only information about what another guy might want, so he took that and continued to kiss his Angel. Dean savored the feel of the veins and ridges of Cas’s penis, the velvety soft skin and the deep throaty sounds that were coming from the angel’s mouth. Cas looked intently into Dean’s eyes and then it was Dean who was against the wall.
He went to kiss his Angel and he noticed movement out of the corner of his eye. He looked around quickly, ever the hunter on alert, even in this private place, it was years and years of training and habit ingrained into him. He felt his jaw drop, it was Ash standing at the foot of the bed, and she looked gorgeous, hell she looked down right edible. She was wearing a sea green silk babydoll teddy, with matching garters and stockings. The color made her eyes an even deeper blue, so deep that the irises were almost and dark as the pupils and her fair skin positively glowed. Dean looked over at Cas and Cas looked at him. Cas had the same look on his face that Dean did. It was a look of adoration, want and love. Ash stood there looking very nervous with her hands crossed over her middle as if bracing for an inevitable punch in the gut.
Cas dropped their hand, losing the flow of memories between the two people he loved the most, his vessel and his Hunter. In that short time of about an hour he had showed them both all the memories that he had of Ash from his point of view and hers to Dean and Dean’s memories to Ashby. Cas also let his own feelings and memories of the two individuals that he adored above his own Father, above his whole existence flow out of his essence. At the end the humans were crying, holding onto one another and the angel’s presence overflowed with joy between them both.
Dean was the first to break the silence, “So about last night, Sam I’m sorry, I was a jack ass.” Dean said looking at Sam, “I am just protective and I was mad you guys went behind my back to take Ash and Cas on a hunt.” Sam looked at his brother in awe, what was this? Dean Winchester apologizing for being an ass, without having to prod him too, wow, Cas and Ashby were good for his brother. “I get it Dean,” Sam replied, “I really do but Hunting is the family business and if Ash is part of the family she has to learn how to defend herself, you know? Besides she is Cas’s vessel, I mean it is unlike any vessel angel relationship I have ever witnessed or head of, but he loves her too right?” Dean nodded his head and answered “Yes.” Sam continued. “That means he is there to protect her as well and plus, you CAN”T stop Castiel from hunting, I mean he is a freaking angel after all.”
Ash was more than obliging, as she stood up she removed her skirt and panties and placed them on the floor beside her bra. She took Cas’s hand and pulled him up to his feet pressing herself flush with his body, kissing him as she unbuttoned his shirt and removed his pants and boxers the rest of the way. Leaving him now completely exposed to her. He took the opportunity to take her hand and lead her to the cabin’s bedroom and ease her down onto the bed. She spread her legs wide enough for him to lay between her legs, groin to groin, chest to chest. He braced his arms by her shoulders and she took him once again in her hand and assisted him to enter her.
Once Cas figured out how to get all three parts of his whole into the cabin he knew that the next step would be to leave. It was a risk, he knew they felt it a terrible loss, a confusing, soul splitting loss but he had to try. So when he found the actual remnants of his body a few weeks ago he knew he had to make his move. So he made the potion they needed to go to the dimensional pocket together and had Dean and Ash follow him there. He wanted to be with both of them like that at least once. To show how much he loved, wanted and needed them. Because he knew that returning to them might not be possible. The ritual to reconstruct the body and attach his grace to it might end him but it was something he had to do to insure Ash’s continued existence.
Sam heard someone padding down the hall and looked up to see his Big Brother strolling through the door, scratching his chin and yawning widely. “Hey there Dean, I expected you to be the last up and out of bed after the night you had.” Dean gave him a pointed look but shrugged his shoulders and smiled wide enough Sam thought his head might crack open. Sam shrugged his own shoulders and said.” Oh well, there’s coffee and OJ, I made eggs, sausage and bacon, oh and toast if you’re hungry.” “Yeah Sammy, that sounds good,” Dean replied as he grabbed a plate and started to pile it up with food. Of course just as Sam predicted, Dean scrunched up his nose at the turkey bacon but took some of the sausage. Amazingly Dean did not complain about the healthier options, “WOW,” Sam thought, “He must be in a good mood.” They set there in silence until both of them were done eating, just enjoying the quiet of the morning.
As soon as they had the Impala safely parked in the bunkers garage, Dean and Ash jumped out of the car. Dean grabbed Ash once again, claiming her lips, running his hands over her rounded bottom and wide hips. “Cas she feels, tastes and smells so freakin’ good.” Dean thought to himself and to Cas, his hands sliding up under her t-shirt to feel the velvety soft skin of her back, crushing all those gorgeous curves against him. “How did I ever not want a woman like Ash, Cas, it makes no sense?” he prayed. Cas was silent, but a burst of angelic grace radiated out from Cas essence, through Ash and into Dean, leaving Dean and Ash both trembling and so in need. The burst of grace also healed the marks on Ash’s body from the hunt earlier.
Ash was glaring hard at the cocky, angry and unreasonable man in front of her, “How could he ever think that I would try to take him away from his family?” Then it dawned on her, Dean was jealous! Without even thinking about it, Ashby Mullins started giggling, like a school girl. This only made Dean look even angrier than before. He started yelling again, “What the HELL is SO funny? You think this is a game, well it is not.” Ash rolled her eyes and looked at Sam who just shrugged his shoulders and threw up his hands in frustration at the two other people in the room. Ash could tell he didn’t have a clue what he could do to stop this craziness.
Ash and Dean had been legally married since before DJ was born but had waited for the big wedding till the time came that Cas could be legally married to them as well. Surprisingly, it only taken a little over a year for polygyny to be decimalized and then sanctioned by the U.S. government as a legal institution. “Of Course,” Dean thought, “not too many woman marring more than one man, most of the time it was the other way around. That being said there are very few woman who have ever lived that are like our Ash. A swell of pride, love and admiration washing over Dean as he thought of his wife.
He heard her screaming, he hear him cursing his name; he heard them both pray; it was almost more than he could bear. Castiel, one time Angel of the Lord, Angel of Thursdays and temperance listened as the very reason for his existence called out to him in pain and he was powerless to answer. The ritual that Gabriel had found for him was taking more of his grace than he had expected. Even with Gabriel’s help it was strenuous on both of them. You see Cas was once again in search of a body, he did not want another vessel, he wanted his body back.
To Say Dean Winchester was excited and nervous about the prospect of making love to both of the loves of his life at the same time was an understatement. The night after deciding they would try it the next day was very long for Dean. He did his best not to toss and turn or keep Ash up with his thoughts or his hard on but she seemed restless too. Was she worried about it? Would he be able to please both of them? What would be like seeing them make love to each other for the first time? I mean they would want to, wouldn’t they? I mean this was not all about him, it was about all three individuals’ relationship, right? These thoughts and more raced through Dean’s head until he finally was overcome by exhaustion sometime in the early hours of the morning before the sun even rose.
Gabriel popped back into the tent holding Dean Jr., the child had been teleported so many times in his short life he thought it was normal. Those lessons would come later and Cas would be there to guild him. Dean Jr. was laughing wildly at the crazy faces Gabe was making until he saw Cas. “Papa, Papa,” Dean Jr. squealed and stretched out his chubby arms for his Papa to take him. Cas gathered the little boy in his arms, holding him close and kissing the top of his head. Never in all the millennia that Castiel had lived would he have ever imagined this life. Not only was he marrying Dean Winchester (who would have ever guessed Dean would marry anyone let along a male angel AND a curvy woman), he was also marrying an amazing woman who had at one time been his vessel. The cherry on the top of it all was the fact that Cas was a father.
Ash is setting in bed, holding her chest, crying uncontrollably into Sammy’s arms. Her lovely face transformed into a mask of pain and sorrow. She turns her head to see Dean standing there, “Dean, He left me, oh my God, he left us! He’s gone, he’s gone, I, I….”back into uncontrollable sobs. Dean takes her into his arms from Sam and pulls her into his lap. “My Heart, oh my heart, shhh, can you guys go call Bobby and please get her a glass of water and a cool wet rag?” Dean felt his voice crack and waiver, he could feel the tears pricking his eyes. Sam squeezed his shoulder and nodded his head, he and Eileen exited the room.
They flew through the War Room and down the hall to Dean’s room. When they were in the room Dean shut the door hastily behind him. He turned around and there she was, cheeks flushed, eyes sparkling with need and love, lips reddened from the hungry kisses that they had been sharing and she was all his, no all his and Cas’s. Even though Cas was not in control of the body he shared with Ash, he was there, Dean could feel him but Dean wanted to focus on Ash at the moment. He once again stepped up and took her in his arms. Her body was radiating heat and he could tell that whe wanted him as much as he wanted her. He once again slide his hands under her t-shirt, this time not only caressing her soft curves but pulling the whole thing up and over her head.
Sam was frankly fascinated by Ash, She obviously was not a wilting flower. She was visibly strong, with shoulders just a little broader then the average woman.  She has strong arms that when she flexed her arms the muscles of her biceps would show quite a bit of definition. He couldn’t really tell about her legs but he suspected those were muscular as well. She wasn’t Dean’s or Sam’s type per say but she has a lovely face and a gorgeous smile that made her cheeks dimple and her eyes sparkle. She seemed to be the kind of person to do anything for the one’s she loved and she seemed to love Cas but, frankly Sam didn't know if she really knew what she was getting herself into with being Cas's vessel.
Cas looked up to see that Sam had tears streaming down his cheeks. He stood there in front of them while Eileen held him, his chin resting on her head. Eileen stepped back from Sam, with a bright smile on her face and signed so fast that Dean had trouble keeping up so Sam had to translate. “About damn time Dean, somebody needed to make you an honest man a long time ago. I should have guessed it would take more than one person to make you settle down. It took an Angel and a Telepath to get to you!” Sam stepped up to Dean, Ash and Cas and wrapped his long arms around them. “I am so happy for you three, Cas you have been family for a long time and Ash, I love you Sissy!” Cas replied to Sam. “Ash says she loves you too Bubbie, as do I Sam.”
It was decided that for the time being Cas and Ash would continue to work at the nursing home, and spend their weeks at their apartment. Their days off they spent at the bunker with Sam and Dean. There were a few weeks that they wondered the halls of the bunker alone when Sam and Dean were out hunting but for the most part Tuesdays and Wednesdays Dean made sure they were home so that he could spend time with Cas and Ash. There were several nights Thursday through Monday that you would find Dean over at Cas and Ash’s apartment after they got off of work, to feed Ash dinner or set on the couch and hold hands. Even when Dean didn’t drop by they never let a day go by without at least talking on the phone for a few minutes to at least tell one another they loved each other.
Finally, her prayer that was answered by Cas and getting to know the lonely, lovely, sweet spirit that shared her body. The sense of love and belonging that they shared. Her encouraging Cas that his family was in fact waiting for him. Them working at the nursing home teaching Cas to care for the ill and ailing without angelic grace. Floating in the background of Castiel’s consciousness but totally aware of his thoughts and what was he was  doing, being able to communicate back at him. Then there was the moment she came to in the bunker and looking into the eyes of the man who set Cas’s spirit on fire and realize she too was falling hard for him herself, realizing he was jealous or HER, frumpy, fat and ugly as she thought was.
Cas rolled over to face Dean, the Hunter was relaxed and looked amazing. His cheeks and lips were just as flushed as Ash’s had been as Cas had looked through her eyes into the dresser mirror. He took and caressed Dean’s cheek with their hand, he let some of his grace flow through into Dean, refreshing him just enough to have a conversation for a few minutes. “Hello Dean,” greeted Castiel. Dean’s eyes opened quickly and smiled at Cas in a way that made his metaphysical heart burst. “I would like to talk for a while, if that is OK? I know you have had….” Dean cut him off with a kiss that made both of them whimper. “Cas, Buddy, no that’s not right, Angel, yep, My Angel, My Soul, we can talk all we want, as long as you want.” Dean again kissed Cas, the Hunter put all the years of bottled up emotion and want into that kiss. Dean let his hands roam over Cas’s and Ash’s body, looking Cas in the eyes and making “Mmmm” sound in the back of his throat. It left Cas’s thoughts reeling, and he had to force himself to focus on what he was about to say.
I…I’m…so….sss…oorry….ba…by…I did...did…n’t…mean…,” God she hated how pitiful she sounded! “to maa…ke…him…go….aa…waay!” Dean griped her tighter and through the tears he stared at her hard. “Ashby Renee Winchester, don’t you even go there! Cas, that bastard, it is his fault!” Dean spit out. Ash quickly said regaining some composer, “NO, NO, Dean, don’t call him that, he is still our fiancé, or rather your fiancé, you know you don’t have to call me a Winchester. Cas is the one you should be calling by your name.” “As I just said, Ashby Renee Winchester, or do you not want me without Cas?” he said with a painfully questioning voice, she could hear the way she had just cut him with her words. “Oh Dean, of course I want you, you are so brave and strong, your My Hunter, you make me feel like I am this beautiful, wanted, creature that I know I am not but that is how you say you see me. I love you so much! I am just afraid without Castiel you wouldn’t want me either! I feel so empty, so alone in my own head, my own body, I mean if I can’t even keep Cas with me, with us, how am I supposed to be able to keep you?”
Dean felt a relief wash over him and as he listened to the message several times again, that voice called to him. He didn’t know why but it stirred something in him, in fact he knew from that moment it WAS Cas who called, it was his best friend, his angel of Thursdays and temperance, his Angel.  Of course, that was too much a chick thing to say so when he told Sammy about the message he explained it away as checking the phone was just to see if anyone from their past needed their help.
Even now with Cas back home, back safe with his Family, Dean felt that hole as real and raw as it was the day before he had just happened to check one of his old cell phones to look at messages that Cas had sent him before he was gone. This was when he found the new message from an unknown number from Washington State. This sweet, lilting voice with a slight Southern drawl was telling him that “Dean, this is Cas, I know you thought I was gone forever but, I have a new vessel and want to come home to you, to you Sam and Jack. We have made our way across country and are living in Lawrence. Ashby Mullins is my vessels name, we are working as a nurse at a local nursing home facility, The Shepard’s Field. Please, call or message me back.”
Ash could not believe this was actually happening, as she looked into the blue eyes of her Angel as they made love. She could touch, taste, smell and hear him, as if he was physically there, something that should not be possible. Cas was gentle and kind, he was hesitant at times, like he was trying to decide what to do next, so Ash took the lead and set the pace. She was glad for them to take their time. After all, who knew if they would get another opportunity like this one? At the end of their slow love making session they lay in bed and talked about everything that they could think of. Most of the things they talked about were things that they had shared early on in the first weeks of the two of them sharing her body but to actually see each other, to be able to hold each other was blissful.
