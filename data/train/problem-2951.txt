He tells me that yeah, he believes that is something that Erudite would be capable of. I tell him that I’m worried about my parents. He looks away and takes a breath before agreeing with me, but also telling me that he thinks I have other things that I need to be worrying about. He’s right, and I agree with him. I have people that are trying to kill me. I have to worry about that and passing this second stage of training. After looking at each other for longer than is probably normal, I get up and tell him that I should go. What I don’t voice out loud is that leaving is the last thing that I want to do, but I feel like he already knows that from our silent exchange. He seems to want to say something as I’m leaving, but he evidently decides not to and then I leave.
“I see you watching our brothers quite a bit, do you have a problem with them being together?” Sam had learned that being blunt was usually the best way to get an answer. It left little room for someone to wiggle out of answering by directing the answer to something else that was said. He hoped that Gabe didn’t have a problem with them, because he was starting to realize that maybe his brother wasn’t the only one with a thing for a Novak, but he wasn’t going to risk the friendship that he had built with Gabe to find out. That meant that he had to see where Gabe’s head was before he told him anything about himself.
Once I make it on the train, I meet a guy named Benny. He’s from Candor. It’s nice to talk to someone who seems to think this is just as crazy as me. Being from Candor though, he speaks his mind about it. I look out of the door to see where we are headed and notice that others are now jumping back out of the train onto the roof of a tall building. When I tell Benny that they are jumping, he says that they must be trying to kill us. We somehow get ourselves together enough to jump off the train and onto the roof along with the other initiates.
Dean had wanted to expand the restaurant but his mother hadn’t wanted to go that route, but after she healed the relationship with Naomi, Mary decided that it would be okay if he wanted to try. She ended up teaming up with Naomi at her bakery and they changed the name to Make or Bake It. They felt that the Pumpkin Pie Bake Off had broken and then reshaped their friendship and wanted something that would tie into the struggles that they had been through over the years.
Naomi, while gathering ingredients for the day's scones,  slipped in the water that had built up on the concrete floor, hitting her wrist on a metal shelving unit in the store room, breaking the radius. Of course, it had to be on her dominant hand, and less than a month before the bake off.
Thank you so much for reading this! If you feel like leaving a Kudos or comment that would be super awesome too! They are like crack to me! Once again thanks to the amazing mods for SPN Media Bang this was so much fun! And thank you again to Supernatastic for the awesome art work! And CrowleyLovesUSUK and Bobby for the beta work!
“I get it, I’m not saying that I’m okay with you guys sneaking around behind my back, but I get it. What is that you had in mind? There had to be a reason that you came to me, but I’m having trouble figuring out what I’m supposed to do. What do you need?” Mary really did understand, her father hadn’t liked John, but she had been so in love with him that when she was forced to choose, she chose John. It had taken her and her father many years to get past that and him buying the bakery was his olive branch, that had been part of the reason that she really couldn’t turn down the offer.
“Yeah? How exactly does that work? I can’t bake if you haven’t noticed. What can I possibly help you with?” Castiel raised an eyebrow at Dean in challenge.
The two pies are presented to the judges, and for this round the contestants wait in the room while all three judges taste the two different selections. During this time, Cas noticed that Betty had her phone open to a picture of the recipe. The picture was of the recipe that he had been practicing with and it was in his handwriting. “So, Betty,” Cas started as he picked up the phone. “Is this the recipe that you were using? This one right here, that just so happens to match the one in my bag? The one that is written in my handwriting?”
I tried talking to him, but he made me feel about the size of an ant. He acts like I have done something to personally offend him. When I asked him a question he replied, “What makes you think that you can talk to me?” I couldn’t help myself, and my sarcasm came through, “Must be because you are so approachable.” He didn’t comment back, so I don’t think he hates me as bad as he acts like he does. I mean, he snapped on Benny when he made a jab at his name after everyone jumped into the hole in the roof. I’m not sure what the problem is, but I intend to find out. There are so many rumors about him going around, maybe he just likes to keep his privacy.
It's years later, and Naomi hadn’t won in a few years, but was determined that this would be her year. She needed the money, but she needed the publicity that came along with winning the bake off even more. Sales had dropped since it had been a few years since the last time that she was featured on For The Love Of Pie. She had to do something to draw people back to her bakery, and winning the bake off would be the push she needed to get them back in.
Cas thought that was a great idea and went over to the little television that Dean had on the far counter in his kitchen. What could he say, Dean liked watching cooking shows while he was actually cooking. It wasn’t like he usually saw something different on there, but it was entertaining to see others techniques while he was in the kitchen.
We make a run for it, heading down the street and making a turn at the next intersection of the path. Unfortunately, Gordon fires a shot, hitting me in the arm as I go around the edge of the building. Cas notices as well, saying that I’ve been hit. It’s a testament to my worry, that I don’t have a witty comeback to this statement. He stops me, pulling me back into him as three men step around the far end of the building and two more come up behind us. Gordon yells for us to drop our weapons. We are then bound and lead into a building that seems to be being used as a base of operations of some sort.
“Woah, okay guys I’m gonna have to ask you not to do that anywhere that I could possibly find myself. Congratulations on that, all of that,” Dean motioned between the two of them, “but yeah, I’m going to need some brain bleach to get the image of a munchkin climbing my baby brother out of my head. Thanks for that, but we think we have something and we wanted your opinion.”
“That doesn’t sound ominous at all.” Dean was trying to sound funny, but it fell flat at Cas’s expression. “I’m sorry, should I not have interrupted? I just wanted to spend a little more time with you before we had to face everyone. That and I didn’t want your coffee to get cold.”
Cas rarely stood up for himself, especially to his family, but he really did feel like Dean was worth it, and if they were ever going to be able to be together without hiding, then they would have to figure out a way to get their mothers to at least be civil to one another. The first step in that was getting Gabe on board, and that wasn’t going to happen if all he was going to do was yell at Cas for being around Dean.
I would have to step up my training though if I was going to stay Dauntless. I got up early everyday and trained on the bags, I did extra training with the weapons. I think that Cas noticed, because he actually came up and started showing me what I could do to improve my fighting ability. He gives some really mixed up signals. He treats me like he hates me, then tries to help me. It’s almost like he wants to help me, but is trying to only do what is expected of him. I think he sees that I am trying though, otherwise he wouldn’t be trying to help me at all. It’s like he was trained to be a robot, with no feelings. Like he’s only made to respond to stimuli a certain way and when he responds differently he goes back to factory settings and comes at me like a complete dick. I won’t lie, I find him intriguing.
“Are you inviting me to your place, Samsquatch?” Gabe knew that it wasn’t an insinuation that anything was going to happen, but he really did have to give Sam a hard time, otherwise he would get all sappy and that just wasn’t him.
Well, he can really screw off now, because I’m not telling anyone my secret. I tell him that I don’t have any tricks and he reminds me, once again, that no one makes it through the sim that fast. He says that if I’m not going to tell him then I should at least tell my friends. I wish that I could tell them, so that there was some way to help them have an edge over this system. When Garth asks what he’s talking about and if there is some way to make it easier, I just say no, and that I don’t know what he’s talking about.
Once I feel like I can function again, he asks me what I’m doing there. I tell him that I’m in trouble and he decides we can’t have this conversation here. He pulls me to a side hall. I almost tell him right there, but then he has this look. This is ridiculous, I should be able to trust my own brother, but I stick to something that was true until very recently. I tell him that I’m not going to make it at Dauntless. I tell him that I don’t fit in there and he insists that I have to fit in there. I tell him that I’m not like them, he says no one is, that they are crazy. I try to see where he stands on things and ask him if he thinks that I could go back to Abnegation. He says that I can’t go back, that they would never let me do that.
“Absolutely. Tomorrow night at your place then?” Cas could tell something was off with Dean, but he wasn’t completely sure what it was. He thought he had an idea, though, and he didn’t believe he was the only one who had been drawn to the other tonight. It seemed the more time they were in each other’s space, the more those feelings he had when they were younger were making themselves known. This time, however, Cas was pretty sure Dean had been leaning in to kiss him. Maybe this time it could be different.
When they reached the front they realized that they had in fact caught Betty off guard. “What’s going on? Did someone drop out? There are only two tables.” She seemed genuinely confused, but neither contestant could bring themselves to feel sorry for her after all, her cheating was what brought them to team up in the first place.
After several hours, Dean decided that Cas had received enough training for one night. It wasn’t the best bread Dean had ever tasted, but he couldn’t handle being this close to Cas. There were too many things Dean had noticed, not only about Cas, but about himself, as well. It wouldn’t do his prospects of expanding the business any good if he started letting himself slip. He had managed to keep his desires for the same sex under wrap for most of his life. Letting them  show only once, and his mom berating him about it, was enough for Dean. Funnily enough, it was over Cas then, as well.
It hadn’t slipped his notice that Dean had called him Cas. It was something that he had done when they were kids, and it made Castiel smile now. He hoped that eventually, and if this went well, they could eventually be friends again. They would just have to find a way to convince their mothers that it wouldn’t be the end of the world. If Dean even wanted to be friends after this.
Gabe leaned back against the counter, deciding to let his brother finish. “Alright, but I get my chance to talk when you are done. Agreed?”
We will be there at eight. Gabe says there is no reason that we have to wait so late when no one is hiding anything. Evidently our previous behavior is ‘creepy’.
Sweet Treats was in better repair than A Slice Of Heaven; that was the first thing Castiel noticed. The second thing he noticed was that it smelled amazing inside the bakery. “What is that wonderful smell?” That was how he decided to greet Dean after their awkward separation yesterday, really?
Dean chuckled. “It really wasn’t that big a secret, but you did really well in the first round.” He meant it. The muffins he had seen looked really good and didn’t resemble the charred mess that now covered the baking table in the back of A Slice Of Heaven.
Dean decided to be sweet and take Cas up a cup of coffee and warn him that Gabe was home and they knew that Dean had spent the night, but just as he arrived at the door he heard voices. He could tell that Gabe had beaten him to talk to Cas, Dean wasn’t upset by that, but he would have liked to give Cas a heads up.
Cas took it as his job to keep Dean under control, which was turning out to be a difficult task. “Dean, please just leave him alone. He didn’t mean anything by it; he’s just looking out for me. Why did you have to drink tonight, anyway? You knew we were supposed to be talking about our mothers and that Gabe was coming with me.”
“Huh? Well, at least it was just you and Gabe, although that might make their conversation a little more heated. Cas was hoping to talk to Gabe calmly, but I don’t think he likes me very much.” Dean was now worrying about how Cas would fare in that conversation. Their plan of meeting tonight hinged on how his talk went this afternoon.
We gather around to find out our final scores for round one of training. Gordon is explaining that if we are ranked above the red line we go on to the second stage of training. If we are ranked below the red line, they don’t want to waste anymore time on us and we will be thrown out. We become factionless based on one little red line. I’m sitting with my friends as they start lighting up the names. Some people start shouting, but I’m almost afraid to look. I somehow manage it, and my name is above the line! I honestly was starting to think that I wasn’t going to make it.
“I took Gabe home, and I know that you took Cas, because we saw you leaving just before I pulled in. You know, for two people who claim to want to be discreet, you two are very unobservant.” Sam might have been being mean, but his brother didn’t get to be smug when he was being reckless the way he was.
Sam was hopeful, and he was even working up his courage to tell Gabe that he might have an idea of what he was talking about, but he never got a chance to say anything. Gabe pushed him back against a shelf and pulled him down to where he could kiss him, and kiss him he did. It wasn’t the most comfortable of positions due to their height difference, but Sam didn’t ever want it to end. Of course that’s when Dean decided to come looking for them.
Sam and Dean had of course grown up here, but Cas had spent a lot of time here as a kid before their families were torn apart. It was difficult for him to be back here, especially knowing that he wasn’t really welcome. He and Gabe hung back, while Sam took a seat on the couch. He was hoping that Mary would join him and that this would be a civil conversation. After all, it wasn’t Cas and Gabe that Mary had been feuding with all these years, it was Naomi. As it turned out, it didn’t really matter who it had been, they were Novaks and that was enough to get Mary going.
However, Gabriel and Sam were fair game and he would prod and pry all he pleased, it was his right, being a big brother, afterall. “So, Cas, what do you think of Sam and Gabe kissing in the store room?”
“Sure.” It was, after all, what Castiel had been thinking anyway. He needed to work on his baking, just in case Dean wasn’t planning on helping him in the next round. It was the finals, and if he made it that far, Cas might just be on his own.
“It’s not fair Dean, you’re right, but it isn’t their fault either. We could have stopped with the charade a while back, and simply dealt with the fall out, but we both wanted the attention that the feud brought to the bake off and the bakeries in return. I know neither of us has had an easy time keeping everything from everyone, but we won’t have to do that anymore. When we go into that building tomorrow, everyone is going to know that the feud is over and that we are the ones that brought it to an end. If that doesn’t tell them how important this thing between us is, I don’t know that anything would.” Cas reached out and stopped Dean’s fingers from wiping yet another tear and pulled his hand into his own lap.
Then he questions me again. “You would help me with that, wouldn’t you?” I’m starting to get nervous, but I ask how I would help him anyway. He tells me that I should be aware that Abnegation is undermining the faction system, breaking the rules, harboring divergents. I tell him that I didn’t know that, but if that is true then I’m glad that I left. He tells me that he needs to know that he can count on me to enforce the law, even if it’s been broken by someone close to me, someone that I care about. I tell him of course. Lying is becoming easier. I’m not so sure that is a good thing, just an observation. He says that is good and that he will have his car take me back to Dauntless.
Cas hadn’t meant his statement to be chastising, but it was apparent by Dean’s face that he had taken it that way. “I guess I just have an idea, and maybe a goal. What do I need to turn that into a plan?”
Waking up beside Cas was something that, while new, was also something that Dean just knew that he would come to love. The fluff of dark hair that was tickling his nose, the warmth of the body against his and the smell of coffee coming through the door that they either left open or someone had opened. The last was what finally woke him up enough to get dressed and go down the stairs.
More than that though, I’m afraid that the test will say that I should stay. Abnegation has never seemed to be the faction that I am meant to be in. I don’t want to feel trapped the rest of my life. It must be time to go. Sam is calling for me. I climb down and we walk to the testing center.
Sneaking off with Cas after their round was proving to be more difficult than Dean had originally planned. Gabe seemed to be paying more attention to them than he was before and it was something Dean hadn’t been expecting. He had even sent Sammy over to talk to Gabe. They had both left town and escaped their families, so they hadn’t been expected to continue this silly feud. It was just one more thing that Dean felt was unfair. Sam and Gabe could talk in public and not have to sneak around; their friendship was nothing to be ashamed of or hidden.
“Hey, stop. We will figure this out. I talked to Sammy this morning, and he’s okay with us. He was just a little surprised, and I don’t really blame him for that. I think he might help cover for us if we need it, as long as we don’t abuse it. We will use the bakery when we can, and if we can’t, I’ll talk to him. Who knows, we may not both make it to the finals, and if that’s the case, it won’t matter anymore anyway.” Dean pulled Cas back in for another kiss. “Come on, it’s time to start. We will have time after we submit and before the judges come to a decision; we can try to sneak away again then.”
Cas leaned over and kissed his shoulder. “Good, that just means I get more time with you. What do you think our brothers would say if we took our shower together this morning?” He wasn’t sure if he would be comfortable enough to do anything with Dean while they were in the house, but if he wanted to, Cas wasn’t going to complain.
That’s what Sam did. They had a few drinks while waiting on Dean to come back downstairs, but that didn’t happen, and it was one of the best nights Sam had had in a long time. Nothing happened, not really. They just talked and spent some time together, but it wasn’t sarcastic or defensive, like most of his conversations with Gabe had been.
Pulling up at Dean’s house, Gabe looked a little down, and that was not what Sam had been expecting from the normally rambunctious man. “What’s up Buttercup?” Okay, so Sam wasn’t as funny as Gabe, he never claimed to be, but it did at least make the other man smile just enough that he felt better about inviting him back. He didn’t want Gabe to think that he was just wanting to hook up after all the conversations that they had about his brother only wanting the same with everyone around them. It didn’t seem like that would be something that Gabe was looking for, at least that was Sam’s thinking.
Dean was in shock, that was the only way to describe it. He had expected at least a little more argument from his mother, but he wasn’t going to complain. She may not approve of him and Cas, but she didn’t seem to be going to do anything about it. That was about the most that he could ask for at this point. He was certain that after she got to know the man that he had grown into that she would come around. “Um, we need to talk about a plan that I came up with, but we are going to need a little more help.”
Dean leaned in, kissing Cas. He seemed almost as eager as Cas had earlier, but he wasn’t worried about this ending; he was just struggling with not being able to kiss Cas whenever he wanted to. “Come with me for a little while. We can go somewhere he won’t be able to find us.”
When Dauntless does exciting, there is no over the top or too much. There is a zip line that goes in between the old buildings, but that isn’t all. It goes inside some of them. I have to make myself small to even fit in some of the spaces, and wonder how some of the larger guys fit. It’s exhilarating, and I get so caught up that I almost forgot the most important part, but I remember just in time and I make it down the zip line eventually finding my brakes.
It’s now been brought to my attention that he is right behind me and that makes me nervous. He says that we are high enough, but I disagree. We need to be higher, I can’t see the other team’s base from here. I start to climb again, but he stays where he is until I stop to see what he’s doing. I ask if he’s alright, but he just looks around and then down at the ground. He looks anywhere he can that keeps him from looking at me. I ask if he’s afraid of heights, well, more like tell him. He informs me that everyone is afraid of something. I honestly didn’t think that he was afraid of anything, and I told him this in return. When I turned around and started climbing again, he huffed out a laugh and followed me once again.
The distraction was proving horrible for Cas; he was never going to learn to make the pumpkin bread. Getting out of his head and concentrating on the bread was difficult, but would prove to be the best thing for him. Cas actually managed to make a good loaf, and was able to even reproduce it.
I say yeah, that I’m happy with Dauntless, but he asks about me coming to see Sammy. I tell him that I only wanted to talk to him. He asks if I’ve seen my parents. I get an icy chill any time that he speaks to me. I don’t feel like I can be honest with him. It would get my mother in trouble. I think that he may be referring to Ellen and Bobby, but just to play it safe, I say no. He tells me that it’s hard to let go, and that Faction before Blood is an important idea, but it is sometimes difficult to fulfill. He says that it goes against our human nature, and that our nature is exactly what we need to overcome. How can human nature be such a bad thing? I ask if he thinks that human nature is a weakness, and he says that it’s the enemy. That it’s human nature to keep secrets, lie and steal, and that he wants to eradicate that. He says that’s how we will maintain a stable, peaceful society.
“Well, Cas, I decided that if you were going to help me put together a plan to show my mother, then you needed to know what I was wanting to offer in my restaurant.” Dean’s cheeks became a little flushed at that, and Cas thought it was absolutely adorable.
“No Dean, you were fine to interrupt, it wasn’t a bad conversation. My brother is rarely serious, but he wasn’t upset. He just seemed a little thoughtful, and I think that Sam has helped him a lot over the last few weeks. It’s almost like he is trying to be more compassionate.” Cas had been surprised that Gabe wanted to talk, and even more so when it wasn’t simply to tear him a new one for having Dean over.
Well, that was not what Sam had been expecting, but it did ease one fear that he had. He had started to worry that maybe Gabe was homophobic, and that was something that he wouldn’t be able to deal with. “Okay, so no problem with them both being guys or that Dean’s a Winchester?
And with that, they explained the whole thing again, this time with Mary adding in the parts about Betty coming and talking to her. They had decided that Betty may have learned about Dean’s crust from Mary, but they just couldn’t figure out how she had gotten her hands on Cas’s recipe. No one had access to it because he always had it with him, except when he was working in the bakery when he was practicing in the back. They were talking about this when it hit him. “She came by a couple of days ago. She asked to use the bathroom while I got her order together. I was doing a practice run, so my recipe was out on the back table. She would have walked right past it, that must have been when she took it.”
The judges had completed their tastings and were discussing amongst themselves the merits of each entry. It was truly nerve racking for Cas. He knew Dean would make it through without a doubt, but he wasn’t as sure of himself. Yes, Dean had taught him how to bake, but would that be enough? Cas wasn’t completely sure.
“You know I don’t have anything against them over all, it’s just the way Dean was in school, but if he was trying to hide his feelings, then that would explain a lot. Sam said I need to give this a chance, and that it isn’t what it seems. He said Dean is different with you, and I see now you are different with him.” It was true, the way that Cas’s face lit up when he was talking about Dean, along with the long glances that had originally caught his attention at the bake off, Cas was definitely in love with the older Winchester.
Meeting up with Cas was always something that seemed to excite Dean. He didn’t like having to keep this thing with Cas a secret, but he couldn’t deny that sneaking around was somewhat exhilarating. When Dean made his way around the side of the trailer that was still set up where they had been taking down the rides, Cas grabbed him and pulled him into a kiss that said it had been a lot longer than a few hours since they had last seen each other. Of course, they hadn’t been able to properly say goodbye to each other this morning, and that’s why Dean completely understood that Cas wanted to meet before the contest started and they had to appear to hate each other.
It’s almost as big of a hit as Dean and Cas are. Their story is something that the residents of Lawrence can’t seem to get enough of. It has been told and retold and every year at the bake off it seems to be the main topic around town once again. They weren’t going to complain though, because every year they get another influx of not just nosey locals, but also tourists that seem to be drawn in by the gossip as well. It has helped not only their restaurant, but also their mothers bakery.  So, they figure it’s a win-win situation.
Of course, the first one to be announced was Dean, but then again, Cas had never had any doubt he would be selected to go to the finals. The second one who was announced was Betty. Again, it wasn’t too much of a surprise, as she had been a finalist for the last ten years, though never being able to beat Mary or Naomi. She was convinced this was her year, and she once again stated that as she climbed the stairs to the stage. Then, to Cas’s total surprise, his name was called. He had made it to the finals. Of course, it had been mostly Dean’s teaching that had gotten him there, but he was happy to have made it, nonetheless.
When we leave the room, Charles is right up in Cas’s face. I hadn’t had time to warn Cas about his father being with me, or anything that had happened while he was under Lucifer’s charge.  He pretty much ignores Charles anyway, simply announcing to the group that we need to keep moving and walking away. He picks up a gun from one of the fallen guards and continues leading the way out. It’s amazing how when it was only me and the members of our group, I had to be the leader, but with Cas here, it’s so easy to let him take the lead. Even though he takes charge, I still walk beside him. We’re a team and we both know that, everyone else will learn it as well. We get out of the building and there are members of Dauntless all around, but they appear to still be a little unsure of what is going on. This makes it easier for us to make our escape with members of Abnegation and Erudite with us as well.
“She took my pie idea! What she just described was the exact recipe I was going to use for the bake off. Well, except for the crust; that is different. What am I going to do? It was perfect, and now I have nothing to make. I don’t have time to learn a completely new recipe. I’m not that good of a baker!” Castiel was still venting, but Dean was no longer paying attention to what was being said.
“Come on, I drove tonight. I remembered how crazy it could get and definitely didn’t want to ride with my mother. I can take you to Cas’s place.” Sam led the way to a shiny black pick up truck Gabe hadn’t seen before, which made sense because Sam hadn’t been around town in a few years.
Benny comes out after taking out his own guy and we raise the flag together. I guess Uriel will have to accept defeat. I know that he doesn’t like me, but he’s going to have to deal with me, at least for a little bit longer. We laugh as we keep waving that ugly orange flag, then we head down to join the others of our group that are gathering around the base of the building. As we are walking back to the train, Cas pulls away to talk to some of the other members of Dauntless while I’m taken aside and asked to go back another way. I’m told that it’s an initiation of sorts and when I look over at Cas, he looks back and acts like I didn’t just catch him staring at me. There wasn’t any worry in his eyes though, so it must not be anything too bad.
“Maybe a little bit of both. I’ll tell you something, but you have to promise me you will give them the benefit of the doubt and save your judgement of Dean until you get to know him for who he is now. He stepped up and helped mom with the bakery, and has pretty much put his life on hold to try to do what he thought was the right thing. He’s grown up a lot since you left and he hasn’t been a ‘man whore’, as you put it, in years. In fact, I can’t even tell you who the last person he dated was. Just think about it. We can talk more later; the judging should be about to start.” With that, Sam started walking back towards the fairgrounds.
As the buzzer sounded, they had decorated the pie and were just drizzling the top with a toasted caramel sauce. It was ready to be presented and they were both as clean as they had been when the round originally began. Betty, however, was covered in flour and had bits of pumpkin in her hair. To put it nicely, she looked like she had been in a fight with her pie, and the pie had won. “Nice hairdo, Betty,” someone yelled from the audience. It sounded suspiciously like Gabe, but Dean couldn’t be sure.
It’s complete chaos on the screen and off, as Lucifer is starting to realize what he was made to do. The screens start going to static and I am finally able to look away from them and back to Cas. We seem to get lost in each other's eyes once again, but we are brought back by Lucifer’s pitiful protests. He’s trying to bring something back up on the computer, but since he was the one that wiped the program, it was done completely. I threw his words from earlier back at him, telling him that there was a certain beauty to his resistance. This is evidently too much for him to take and he charges towards me, but I am just as angry as he is and I knock him to the ground easily. Cas draws my attention to the monitors and the guards that are rushing through the tunnels towards us, and tells me that we have to go, now.
Cas held Dean’s hand in his own, so all that Dean could do was run his thumb over the knuckles that he could reach on Cas’s hand. It was the sweetest thing that Cas or anyone, really had ever said to Dean. In that he heard that he was worth everything that they had gone through and that he would have Cas on the other side, no matter what the outcome was tomorrow. That was exactly what he needed to hear, and Cas was exactly who he had needed to hear it from. He leaned in to place a gentle kiss on Cas’s lips, that as usual with these two did not stay as innocent as it had started.
The next thing I know, I’m standing in a field outside the wall. I hear something in the bushes behind me and turn around to see what it is. A vampire runs at me, and just as it gets close enough that I think I might not get away, lightning strikes. The field that I’m standing in catches on fire. I grab a long branch that is lit with flames and swing it at the vampire. It recoils from the flame, even though I know it can’t kill it. It would injure the creature.
Dean and Cas found a little area where they could talk out behind a grove of apple trees. It wasn’t the most private place around, but it would work. They only had about thirty minutes, and Dean had to reassure himself that Cas wanted this and that once the competition was over, they wouldn’t have to hide any more. They needed to figure out a time and place they could talk and come up with a plan to deal with their mothers. It was apparent that after a decade of trying, their fathers had given up, but Dean was stubborn, and he was starting to see that when it came to something or someone he cared for, Cas could be just as bull headed.
When his mom approached him about the bake off, Dean thought he had found the perfect opportunity to get his mother to agree to expanding the restaurant. He convinced her that if he did the bake off for her, then she would at least look at a business plan. She was concerned about making the revenue to do the expansions and the renovations that would be necessary, but if he could ease her mind about that, she would be more willing to listen to his ideas.
Dean would definitely have an advantage over Castiel, whom he knew wasn’t anywhere near the baker Dean was. He would simply have to make an amazing pie to ensure that he beat whoever they were up against this year, and he thought he had the perfect recipe.
“Anyway, Dean and I came to an agreement of sorts. We agreed that he would help me learn how to bake, so that I didn’t end up losing the bakery, and I would help him make a business plan. He wants to expand the bakery he and his mom own, and she agreed to take a serious look at the business plan if Dean wins. It might seem counterproductive that we are helping each other, but it works. This round might get a little trickier because there can only be one winner, but it worked for the last round. I’m honestly not sure what is going to happen, but that is how I started hanging around Dean Winchester, as you put it.” Cas wasn’t done, and they both knew that, but he had to compose himself and prepare for what was going to come when he continued this conversation.
“I know, Sammy, but I don’t care what mom says. You were old enough when all this started, you should remember it wasn’t Cas who was the problem. He didn’t have any choice but to go along with his mom, just like us. He isn’t bad!” Dean didn’t mean to raise his voice, but his brother coming in and finding him laying on the couch with his arms around ‘the enemy’ had not gone over well, and Sam had been giving him a hard time since the second Cas left the house. Dean guessed he should be grateful Sam had waited that long.
Before we can talk more about this, someone shouts behind me and she is gone. I can’t believe that I met my mother. She seems to know that I’m divergent. I wonder if that’s because she is as well. I need to be really careful. My parents have never come to me before about anything, so this must be really important.
I nod and that’s all it takes. He swings around firing at the guards that are still gathered around us. They scatter and Lucifer yells to finish it, and then tries to do something on the screen that they seem to be putting in orders for the sim. Cas is amazing, using bodies of the guards as shields, while trying to get to the ones that are running the simulation. I manage to get a knife from one of the guards, and I look up to see Lucifer looking at a screen with Abnegation lined up like a slaughter, with Dauntless spread out holding them at gunpoint. Whatever he is doing, he’s frantic, and it unnerves me. The Dauntless are having the members of Abnegation kneel. They are about to start murdering them all. I can’t let that happen, so I throw my stolen blade and land it in Lucifer’s hand. It lands square in the middle, and I tell him to shut down the sim. He of course says no, these people keep underestimating me. I look up at the screen and see Benny pushing Abnegation members to the ground, completely unaware of what he’s actually doing, and I snap.
I look over at Cas, he winks at me and turns back to his friends. I’m kind of dumb founded, I just stare at him until Benny jostles my arm and gets me back to the present. I had never realized how beautiful he is. I need to get myself together.
It wasn’t like the distance had really helped the first time around. Dean thought about Cas all the time. He just wasn’t allowed to talk to him, especially after his parents laid down the law about boys not liking boys. Surprisingly, it wasn’t his dad who was the worst, and he wasn’t sure their feelings were really based on him liking another boy, or if they really centered around it being Castiel, a Novak. He was pretty sure it was the latter, since his parents didn’t seem to have any issues with their friends who were gay.
Castiel, her son, was in the bakery and saw what happened to his mother. He quickly took her to the doctor, but the news was not good for Naomi. She would not be able to use her arm for at least six weeks, and that was if she rested it the way the doctor suggested. If she tried to continue the way she had been, it would take even longer to heal.
Training isn’t just about fighting. There is also weapons training. It took a while, but I got better with a gun. Knives, I am awesome at! I can hit the target every throw, usually bunched together in the center. Benny tells me that it’s scary how good I am at this, but all I can do in return is laugh. He’s really not wrong. It scares me a little too, how dangerous I could be, but it’s also a good thing. I have to move up the board.
I flinch, but get myself back under control and continue to follow my line to get my weapon. Once we have those, we load a train. It is once again stopped. The reason for that is probably that everyone is moving like zombies and wouldn’t be able to jump on it fast enough. There is a Dauntless leader stationed at every door helping us on. We are then lined up inside, without hardly any room to breathe, let alone move. Once I am in my line, it's hard to see those that aren’t immediately beside or in front of me. Cas’s height is the only reason that he is visible several lines ahead of me. I’m both relieved and worried by the fact that he is here. If he wasn’t then the leaders would know what I have suspected for a while, that he is divergent as well, the fact that he’s here either means he is playing the system like I am and hoping to somehow make it out undetected, or the worse option, that he is under the control of the simulation that is causing all of Dauntless to act like robots.
“I brought Cas a coffee, and Sam has one made for you in the kitchen.” Dean said this as he passed Gabe, who was standing just inside the doorway. He handed Cas the cup and sat back on the side of the bed that he had vacated when he went in search of caffeine.
I ask him what he means and he tells me that he thinks I am lying to him. I don’t want to lie, but I have to protect myself. He’s the one that I wish I could tell the most. His blue eyes bearing into my own and I have to turn away. I ask him why he thinks that I would lie to him. He leans in and says that he’s going to ask me one more time what my results were for the aptitude test. I blink and lie to his face. I have to make him believe that my results were Abnegation. He turns away, like I have hurt him, and then tells me that it’s time for me to go. When I’m walking out the door, he calls my name. I look back and he tells me that Dauntless doesn't break the glass like that. I turn away and leave the room.
I go out ahead of the others, and I can tell that none of them are Dauntless, because they hang back and let me check that the coast is clear. I gather weapons from the fallen Dauntless that are littering the streets outside of the hideout. I get them onto the train and give them weapons. When we are getting close to the rooftop where we jumped the first day of initiation, I tell them to get ready. John, my father, asks what now. I tell him that he isn’t going to like it. I open the door and look at all of them, then as we reach the roof, I jump. They follow, one by one, Charles of course going last. We run across, until we reach the end and the hole that we had to jump through. I tell them that there is a net at the bottom, don’t think, just jump, then I do just that. I climb up and jump first.
They were at Dean and Cas’s restaurant with the extended Winchesters and Novaks gathered around the table. This was what it meant to be a family, being able to spend time with those that you love and that love you. They all hoped that they would have many more years of this, but it was definitely a good start. To think it all came about because of a family feud and a pumpkin pie war.
“We do need your help, both yours and Mary’s. When you all were younger, you used to make some pies that, how do I say this, not exactly what everyone was used to. We need some help doing that again. If we join up together, and I checked, it isn’t against the rules for two finalists to team up if they both make it to the final round independently, and you both will help us, we can come up with something that this town has never seen before.” Dean was starting to feel more confident, his mother was on his side now and they were just waiting to hear the verdict from Naomi on whether or not she would help them as well.
Finally the contestants and their families go their separate ways to try and get some sleep before the finals the following day, or at least that was what they had said they were going to do. As Dean was waiting for Cas to climb into Baby, he noticed that Gabe was climbing up into Sam’s monster of a truck and Mary was riding with Naomi. He really hoped that things between Mary and Naomi would be better now, and it hadn’t passed his notice that during their little experiments, that Naomi and Mary had held their own discussion. He had tried to allow them their own time to work things out once it looked like they were going to, so he didn’t pry.
She tells me that I need to be careful. I’m not completely sure what she is talking about. I try to ask, but she just asks about my tests. It takes a few minutes for me to answer, I don’t trust easily and I really don’t know this woman, even if she is blood. She says that I can’t tell my friends or instructors. I ask her what I am, what’s wrong with me? She says that I just don’t conform and that makes them uncomfortable. They can’t control me, therefore, I scare them. She told me that I’m at the most risk during the second stage of training. That they will be getting inside my head.
The three of them had been friends before the feuding began, but it had put a strain on Betty’s friendship with both ladies. She felt confident that she stood a chance this year with both of them out of the running, especially since she knew the reputation Castiel’s cooking ability had. The only one she wasn’t completely sure of was Dean, but she had been thrown off guard with Castiel making it past the first round.
Sam and I, since we don’t know what faction our parents should have been in, aren’t so sure what the tests will say tomorrow. The way the factions are set up, when you are eighteen, you choose the faction that you will be as a full fledged member of society. There is no going back. Once you choose you either succeed or you become factionless. The factionless are considered the scrugs of society and have no home and no family. You don’t want to be factionless.
It turns out that what they had come up with was a whipped pumpkin silk with an almond bark crust and garnished with whole almonds along the top. It looked amazing, and with Sam’s idea of using almond milk in the pie, it was a little more healthy as well. Dean wasn’t too sure how he felt about a healthier pie, even if it wasn’t really all that healthy, but went along with it because it was definitely something different than they had seen in any of the past years competitions.
“What’s really bothering you Dean?” Cas knew that Dean didn’t have a problem with Gabe and Sam getting together, and he knew that Dean was aware of how close the two actually lived. If Sam was going to fall for someone while he was here, Gabe was actually the best option because there wouldn’t have to be any decisions made about who was going to give up their lives to move so far away. They only lived about a half an hour apart, it was perfect. It was something else, and Cas just couldn’t figure out what it was.
Those of us that passed are now working. We have to unload the train and load it into trucks. Benny thinks that this is a crappy celebration, but I understand that it is supposed to help keep us disciplined. There is a blonde woman behind a stack of crates. She catches my attention and waves me over.
That question seemed to catch Gabe off guard, “What? Um, no not really. I’m just honestly surprised at how they interact with one another. I guess what bothers me is that I’ve never seen Cas act that way around anyone, he’s usually so closed off. Dean, on the other hand, I have never seen him take anything serious, but he seems to be taking things with Cas very seriously. I guess I just wasn’t expecting that.”
When we got back to the dorm area, the first person that came out was still sitting there rocking back and forth, while we discussed what it was like under the simulation. Benny has a fear of insects apparently, and was explaining how he was completely covered by them, they were in his ears and his mouth, they were just everywhere. Garth starts talking about someone that was so panicked that he had a heart attack and almost died. Benny mentions that I didn’t seem to have a problem at all, even though I deny that and explain how awful it was they still don’t seem to believe me. Noone came close to my time, which they remind me of again.
That was all it took and Dean was out of the car, following Cas up the steps and through the front door. He really hoped that Sam and Gabe hadn’t just stopped for something to eat. If they had then they would be getting a heck of a surprise when they showed up.
Originally Castiel thought his family’s bakery was the best place to meet, so that is what they agreed on. They also both agreed they would keep this secret because there was no way their families would agree to them working together. Their mothers couldn’t even stand to be in the same room, let alone speak civilly to one another. Now, however, he was wondering if this was even a good idea at all.
It didn’t take long before they had a sort of decent loaf of bread. It wasn’t the best thing Castiel had ever tasted, but it was a lot better than any of his other attempts. Dean seemed to think it was wonderful, if the expression on his face was anything to go by. “Good try, Cas. Let’s try again. You’ll get it; I have faith in you.”
“You know me Samsquatch, I gotta get my digs where I can, besides you wouldn’t know how to feel if I started acting all mush like those two love birds out there.” Gabe’s face flared red like he hadn’t meant to say that, but it was out there and he wasn’t going to take it back.
“Thanks Deano, I’ll talk to you more later Cas, just remember what I said.” With that, Gabe made his way out of the bedroom, closing the door behind him.
Walking down the hall, I see Lucifer with several of his goons. There are rumors that he is leading a search on divergents. I again think about Sammy and if his results were similar to mine. I honestly hope not. With him in the middle of everything going on with Erudite and their hunt for divergents, if his test was inconclusive then Lucifer would have every reason to go after him. He calls me over and talks to me. Saying how proud he is that I know my own mind, even with my test results showing Abnegation. He doesn’t bring up Sam and neither do I. I don’t want to bring extra attention to Sammy, I guess I’m still trying to protect him from afar. This time however, I seem to have his attention. He looks me up and down and says that Dauntless suits me. I’m not really sure what that means. This whole interaction really makes me miss Sam though,  I haven’t seen him since the choosing ceremony.
Cas tells stories of having to behead vampires that still roam the areas outside of the wall. He tells stories about having to kill monsters that look so human that it makes him have nightmares. He looks at me as he’s talking about these, and I think that he is afraid that I won’t be able to do this because of my Admegation background. I will be able to, because no matter where I came from, I am Dauntless now. I have to be.
When I wake up in the morning, it’s to a soft touch to my face, almost caressing. He tells me that he wants me to see something and that I should follow him. I don’t really want to get out of bed, but I do and follow him out of his room and onto the roof. He tells me to look down over the edge, and when I do, I'm not really sure what I see. It’s Erudite, but what are they doing? I ask Cas and he says that they have been coming here every morning for the last few weeks. He’s been watching them and they are loading in supplies, computers, and these. He holds up a cylinder that contains an amber liquid inside. When I ask him what it is, he says that he thinks it’s some kind of cognitive transmitter that you inject, like a serum. I ask him why and he says that it’s supposed to make you more susceptible to suggestion, but that as many as they have that they could create an army. I think back to what Sammy said about Erudite overthrowing Abnegation and my blood runs cold. Then over the loudspeakers, there’s someone announcing that all initiates must report for the final stage of testing, and if I wasn’t already pale enough, I know that I lose what color is left.
Caleb points out that what I’m actually doing is pushing Garth out of Dauntless. He explains that I was one of the worst during the first stage of training, but during this second stage, I’m the best. He explains that when cuts come around again, I won’t be at the bottom of the board again and that he will. When the others tell him to screw off and shut up, he says that he just wants to know how I do it. He wants to know my secret.
Luckily, Dean agreed, and the two of them began to make their way towards the stairs. Cas wasn’t completely sure where Dean’s bedroom was, but he figured it was on the second floor, and since that was the way that Dean seemed to be leading him,  it seemed like a safe bet.
They’re still sitting there as we leave the hall. I can’t think too much on that now. I have to make it in my new faction. I have to focus all of myself on making it in. I don’t want to be factionless. When we leave the town center, the other Dauntless initiates start running down the street. It does seem that they, we, run everywhere. We reach the poles where the train runs over head and they all start climbing. The only time I have ever been on a train was to load the food for the factionless that is taken deeper into the city. I haven’t been on one that was moving. The train doesn’t stop though. It just flies by, and they are jumping on. I have to run to catch up, and even then I only catch the last car before it passes a section of platform that is so deteriorated that I would have fallen through.
“As long as it wasn’t bad. Sam said they came by here last night, but decided that they were better off staying at my house. I can’t say much, at least they brought me some clothes. That saves me from having to run by on the way to the fairgrounds. I can just get ready here and go straight there.” Dean looked up at Cas then, just realizing that his words may not be such a good thing to Cas. What if he wanted the time alone with Gabe this morning?
Then we are in another room and I recognize it immediately. It’s Abnegation, and I immediately have a sick feeling in my stomach. I ask Cas why we are in Abnegation, but he doesn’t answer me for a moment. Then he stops, looking up at me, he says the last fear is your worst fear and that it lives in the deepest part of your mind. He’s walking again now, into another room. Once we have completely entered, I see Chuck coming down the stairs into the room and what little doubt that I had of what this was is crushed. I say, simply for myself because he knows this, “Chuck had a son. What was his name?” Then as if answering my question, Chuck calls to him, “Castiel.” It keeps repeating and there are now several Chucks around the room. We are surrounded by them. They are all holding a belt, like a whipping strap. He keeps saying Castiel and that he is just trying to help him. Then the next thing that I know he is swinging. Cas blocks blow after blow and when he is finally able to hit back, they all go down and then we are back in the simulation room.
“Come on. We don’t have long before we are needed back in the competition hall.” Dean groaned and whined a little bit, and Cas was sure that if he ever questioned him about it, he would completely deny ever making that sound; but Dean did eventually relent, and the two walked back to the fairgrounds. What they didn’t notice, however, was that Betty was hiding behind one of the trees in the orchard after having followed them out there.
She didn’t want the same thing to happen here, it was bad enough the way that she had reacted all those years ago when Dean had told them that he loved Castiel. Her saving grace at the time had been that Dean was too young to run off and do what he wanted without her consent. Now if she forced him she wasn’t sure what would happen, but the fact that he was here facing her told her that it probably wouldn’t go in her favor.
Castiel thought for a moment, and Dean seemed to think that he was going to reject his idea, but that was not what was giving him pause. He had only seen the confidence Dean had projected to everyone for the last ten years. It caught him off guard to see a sliver of that friend he had grown up with peeking through. The Dean now rarely asked for help. It was something Dean’s mother thought was a sign of weakness. The Dean from ten years ago had been willing to ask Castiel for anything. They had been best friends, after all.
Both of their mothers always emphasised how important it was to keep their recipe for the finals a secret, so they couldn’t believe Betty was talking about hers on the news like it was no big deal. That was, until Cas started yelling at the television. So, of course, that caused Dean to pay more attention to what was being said on the screen.
That’s it, I can’t deal with this alone anymore. I have to talk to Sammy, at least check on him. It’s been too long since I’ve seen him. I need to know that he’s okay. I leave through one of the back doors and take an alley that is rarely used. I jump the train, the way that Dauntless has taught me to, and I walk right in the front doors of Erudite headquarters. Sammy comes up to me straight away, he must be able to tell that I need a hug. He simply says, Dean, and then envelops me in his brotherliness.
Cas didn’t answer, but after a few seconds Dean saw him excuse himself from his brother and head towards the bathrooms, only to veer off at the last minute and look over at Dean.
We all take a train out to the edge of the city. It actually stops this time. We are lined up along the wall and there is talk about what is outside. Cas tells us that Dauntless has one main goal, and that is to protect the people inside the wall from the supernatural beings that are still outside. I am not sure why he chose now to go over the stories, but I still listen with rapt attention, like I do anytime someone tells of the creatures from the outside world. I may have been raised in Abnegation, but it never stopped my curiosity. Every time someone would mention  the outside I would always listen. I found myself intrigued with the monsters that were out there and the people who fought them. That is probably the main reason that I chose Dauntless. I wanted to live those stories when I was a child and this was my way of doing just that.
The worst part of that second experience was that Dean had apparently been across the street and seen the smoke. He came in just before the fire department had arrived and was witness to just how bad a baker Castiel really was. He felt like an idiot, but he had no other choice but face Dean, now that the firemen had left. “So, now you know my secret.”
“You are probably right. So why don’t you distract me, moose man?” Gabe’s grin was almost leering, and Sam was pretty sure he wasn’t mistaking the signals he was getting, but he was the kind who liked to double check everything.
“Well it isn’t fair. This was my first real shot at winning. It’s always been Mary or Naomi, no one else has ever had a chance at winning until now. I couldn’t risk not winning, and when I saw your recipe laying on the table, I had to take my chances.” Betty looked defeated, but no one there felt any sympathy for someone who would stoop so low as to steal someone's recipe to use against them. That was just too low for anyone to understand.
I keep to myself that they may, in fact, be my old family as well. The way things are going I’m having a hard time keeping away from the bottom of the leaderboard. The first time I fought someone, he was twice my size. Uriel set up new rules yet again, saying that no one taps out. We fight until someone can’t continue. I bet you can guess who couldn’t continue. I fought, but he fought dirtier. This landed me at the bottom of the board, not last, but close enough. After a rough day, Benny suggested tattoos. That is something that no other faction does, so I agreed.
We are lined up in four lines and people are getting it administered. I can’t help but to freak out a little. I have to find Cas, he’ll know what to do. I ask if anyone has seen him, but no one has. I go to look for him, but before I can make it out of the hall Uriel comes up talking about how I should have been first in line. He says that’s okay though and has someone come up and inject the serum where we are. He makes a comment about it hurting like a bitch, and that now I’m really one of them, and just walks away, leaving me standing there rubbing my neck and wondering what the hell just happened.
He didn’t want to leave the next part out; he just wasn’t sure how Gabe would take it. “That’s where it started at least, but as I’m sure you have figured out, that isn’t all it is anymore. We haven’t really had much of a chance to talk about it, but I know not keeping us a secret is important to Dean, and it’s important to me. Wait, let me finish.” Cas could tell that it was killing Gabe to be quiet, so he would have mercy on his brother and make this as short as he could.
“Cas, I need to see you tonight; we need to talk. I can’t take this sneaking around much longer. I don’t want to have to hide this, and if we don’t figure out something with our moms, then that’s what we are going to be stuck doing.” Dean was trying to calm himself down, and his new favorite way of doing that was running his fingers through Cas’s perpetually messy hair. It was working; he could think a little clearer, and his breathing was starting to slow down. It helped even more when Cas pulled him in for a kiss. He didn’t think he would ever get over the feel of Cas’s lips on his; at least, he hoped he wouldn’t.
Working with Naomi, Mary remembered why she enjoyed baking with her so much. She was very particular about the way that she wanted her kitchen, but she had determination. Where Naomi was strict in her baking, Mary was creative, that’s why the two of them had worked so well together before. Mary would suggest something and if Naomi couldn’t talk her out of it then they would try it. These trial and error episodes were what made their recipes so good, they were different, but not so wild that no one would want to eat them.
“So you both would go together against Betty in the finals. That would definitely draw in the press and it doesn’t hurt that it would completely throw Betty off.” She looked at Mary for a moment, but then changed her focus to her youngest son. “Alright, I’ll help, for you.”
I’ve lived by one rule for as long as I can remember. Take care of Sammy, that’s been my life. Abnegation teaches selflessness, and the one person I have never had a problem putting above myself is Sam. Other than that, I don’t really feel like I belong in Abnegation. To be honest, I’m not sure that Sam does either. Sam is so smart, like smarter than anyone I have ever met. He could easily fit in with Erudite, although that is one faction I would really rather him not be associated with. The leader of the Erudite, Lucifer, has done nothing but cause my family grief.
I watch as a group of Dauntless gather just up the road from us. John gets so mad when they gather and just watch, but I can’t help but to look for my babies. I guess it’s a mom thing. I’ve seen them, when the Abnegation would bring food, but they never saw me. We left them with Bobby and Ellen because we knew that they would look after them. That they could give them a life that we would never be able to as long as we are living as we do.
Left with no other choice, Castiel made the decision to step up and take his mother's place in the bake off. He had her recipes and the bakery, and at least a rudimentary knowledge of how a pie should be made.The only problem was that Castiel couldn’t bake. The knowledge of how something should be made and actually being able to make it were two totally different things.
“Everything is okay, it’s just that Gabriel is back. Mom wanted him to do this instead of me, but he was out of town and couldn’t make it in for the preliminaries. Now, I’m stuck, since I am the one who competed. He would have been the answer I was looking for if he had been able to come a little sooner. Now, he’s just going to be a hindrance. He’s going to want to teach me and work with me, and it won’t leave us any time together. He’s staying with me, and with Sam at your house and Gabe at mine, the bakery will be the only place we can meet. I think I just panicked a little that I wouldn’t be able to see you anymore.” Cas just seemed lost.
Dean grabbed Cas by the arm, pulling him back into the kitchen. He really didn’t want their brothers to wake up to them making out, standing over them. Dean pushed Cas back against the counter and braced himself with his hands on Cas's hips.
“Freaking sasquatch, makes it look easy to climb out of this thing.” Sam chuckled at Gabe’s grumbling as he walked up and unlocked the door.
I ask just to be sure, that he just said he would be able to see inside my mind. His simple reply was uh huh, with a, why are you asking, look on his face. He walks over and runs a finger along my neck. This makes me shiver. I don’t know if he thinks it’s fear or not, but it definitely was a little of both, fear and anticipation. The fear this time isn’t because of the tests, it’s the fear of my own reactions and the thought of Cas being this close to me. I look into his eyes, then he breathes in and injects the serum.
“Mom?” Sam didn’t know all the details about what went on with Dean and his parents before, but he could tell that there was something that both of them were trying to find in the others eyes. It didn’t seem likely that it was anything good, so he wanted to move the conversation along.
At the end of the hour, the timer went off and Castiel presented his dish. It looked and smelled just as good as any of the practice rounds, and he hoped that it would taste just as good. Dean, as usual, was confident in his baking ability and was putting on a show for the observers, introducing his bread with flair. It was cute and annoyingly distracting, and Cas almost missed his turn to introduce his dish. Again, he noticed that Gabe was looking at him funny, and he was starting to get the feeling that his brother had seen something between him and Dean that they weren’t ready for people to notice.
“Castiel Novak? I mean, I always knew that Benny guy in Paris was more than a roommate, but really, Dean? Castiel Novak? Mom is going to lose her mind over this.” Sam seemed to run out of steam. Dean wasn’t sure if he simply didn’t have anything else to say, or if it was something on his own face that made his brother stop, but he was grateful for it either way. He had always been close to his brother, and he had been hoping Sam would understand.
“Cute, lovebirds, but we need to get back to work.” Gabe was a little gruff, and Dean couldn’t help but notice that his eyes kept going back to Sam. He was certain that there was something there, but he couldn’t be certain what it was. Hopefully they would be able to figure it out on their own, he didn’t want to see his little brother hurt either. He might have to have a talk with Gabe about all of this when the bake off was over.
Over all, it’s been a good few years in Lawrence, but there was more news to come when Sam came into the bakery holding the newest member of their family. He and Gabe had been trying to adopt for quite some time, but had been unsuccessful up until now. The paperwork had gone through last month and the couple were now the proud parents of a beautiful little boy, named Jack.
When Cas looked out at the sea of observers, he was drawn to his brother who was, of course, sitting with their mother. Gabe wasn’t as into the cook off as he probably should have been, in Cas’s opinion; he seemed to be more focused on Cas. There was a look of confusion and maybe a bit of denial, but it had been a while since Cas was able to spend any real time with his brother. And while he missed him dearly, this was nowhere near the time to be trying to figure out what was going on in his head. Gabe simply mouthed 'later' to Cas and then looked away, towards Sam Winchester, if Cas wasn’t mistaken. Maybe Dean was right and those two would be a good distraction for each other, after all.
The women described what they had tried so far, some of the ideas were shot down by the boys, but others seem to be taken well, they added them to the list and started working on making something that the people of Lawrence had never had before. It was challenging, because there are so many different ways to make pumpkin pie, but they had decided that the best way to beat Betty was to be very different and yet hold a little bit of that classic pumpkin pie taste with it. It was a challenge, but they felt that it was one that they were up for.
“I can’t believe Betty would do that! What is wrong with her? I trusted her because she’s been friends with my mom for so long.” Cas was livid. He hadn’t even told Dean what he was going to be doing in the finals yet. There was only one way Betty could have found out what he was baking, and that was to be a freaking sneaky assbutt.
Looking around myself I see weapons and raw meat. I look back to ask what it is for and he is gone. Then I hear it. There is growling so loud that it must be right behind me. I go to grab something, still not sure which it would have been, but the meat and the weapons are gone. Then the giant dog is chasing me. I run for only a moment then turn and face the dog. I drop down to my knees and the dog stops. There in front of me is a puppy, not the snarling, growling beast from seconds before. I reached to pet it, Sam has always had a soft spot for dogs that just maybe rubbed off a little on me, and then there was a shout.
When I ask him who wouldn’t let me, he says that Erudite wouldn’t. He says that they wouldn’t let Abnegation break any more rules. That’s insane. I ask if they actually think that they’re running the government now and he tells me that they may be soon. I can’t believe that, then he says that Erudite should be in charge, and that it certainly shouldn’t be Abnegation. Sam’s lost his mind. He’s been brainwashed by Lucifer. He says that all the other factions want Erudite in charge and that Abnegation has failed. When I try to tell him that there are people here that are manipulating him, he says that it’s time for me to go. That seems to be what I’m hearing the most today. I ask him Faction before Blood, and he just looks at me. I can’t believe that Sam would ever put anything over me. I wouldn’t dare put anything before him. I tell him that I got it and walk away.
Dean still didn’t see Cas, but what he did see stopped him in his tracks, just as he was stepping off the last step. There on the couch was his gargantuan brother, sprawled out. That wasn’t what stopped him though. Sammy sleeping on the couch was something that he had gotten used to seeing every time his brother stayed over. The short little lump laying beside him, however, was definitely a new addition.
“Yes, Gabe, I’m sure you have a lot you want to say, but please wait until I’m finished.” Cas waited for his brother’s agreement before he continued on.
Either way, we left. I gave birth to my boys in an abandoned building just outside of town. A lady from Abnegation snuck out and helped to deliver them. I didn’t know what to do. I was able to keep them for a few months, but as it started getting colder I knew that they would die out here. So I did the only thing I could do. I gave them up in hopes that they would have a better life. The lady that had delivered them told me that there was a family that would take them in. I knew the name, because John and Bobby had, at one time, been close friends. I don’t know what happened to end their friendship, but John had always said Bobby was a great man. I hoped that he was right.
“Stop! It’s true, and obviously we haven’t said that to each other, but I know that’s how I feel. I haven’t been able to admit that to anyone out loud until just now, but I have loved Dean for over a decade without knowing he felt the same way. How can I not believe this is different? I know his reputation, and I know what our family thinks of him, but I can’t help how I feel, and if he feels the same way, then I can’t see a single thing that is more important.”
I go down to the common area, where we eat, and find Benny. The first thing that he does is ask about the sweater I’m wearing. I wouldn’t dare tell him that it belongs to Cas. I would never live that down and that is the last thing that I am thinking about right now, even though the reminder does make me smile. I didn’t think that I was capable of that right now. I guess I was wrong.
Just then Charles Shurley came up to us and asked if I was followed. I can’t help the incredulous look I give him. Now that I know what he did to his son, especially a son as wonderful as Cas, I can’t even stand to look at the man. He changes the way he words it, asking if there are soldiers outside. Ah, he’s wanting to get away. I tell him that no, it’s clear. Sam is crying now, saying that he should have believed me, and that he left as soon as he realized what was going on. He asks why Dauntless are fighting for Erudite. I explain to them that they don’t know what they’re doing, they are under a simulation. I tell them that I need to wake them up, and to do that I need to get into Dauntless. Charles says that it’s impossible, it’s a fortress, it’s not going to happen. He talks like he has any say in what I’m going to do. I look him in the eye and tell him that I can get us there.
“Right, no, you are right. I shouldn’t have asked Sam to lie for me anyway. It would definitely make things better if we could figure something out.” Dean leaned his head against Cas’s, and they just stood there breathing for a few minutes.
Going into testing they line you up in alphabetical order. So Sam is, of course, standing beside me as we enter the doors that will determine the rest of our lives. Inside is Joanna, Bobby and Ellen’s daughter. She can’t show favoritism and I wonder how she was even able to conduct my testing. She says hello and leads me to a chair in the center of the room. The room itself is made up of mirrored walls. That is not something that I am used to, considering that we aren’t allowed mirrors in Abnegation. I look away, because I have been accused of looking in reflective surfaces too long and don’t want to bring trouble to Bobby or Ellen.
Sam grumbled at this and turned to look at his brother. “You really are obnoxious in the morning, do you know that? It’s your fault we weren’t able to talk last night. You can at least allow me the time to be functioning before you start in on me.”
I think back to Lucifer being at Dauntless and decide that yes, I need to be really careful. I’m also going to have to find a way to get to Sam and make sure that he is okay. I haven’t talked to him since coming here. I really need to fix that situation. I will find a way soon to talk to him.
This round would be two groups of three, and the judges would wait until after everyone had completed their dishes before deciding on the finalists. Dean and Cas were in the first round, and they were, in fact, going head to head. They were on opposite ends of the room, so as to contribute in a small way to the feud that neither one really wanted to perpetuate. They were willing to bicker a little and try to stay as far apart as they possibly could, but they wouldn’t degrade each other, and they wouldn’t get violent. It wasn’t something that they had really talked about; they just weren’t really comfortable doing that. It may have been a very dramatic finale for their mothers, but they refused to stoop that low. It would be harder to explain when everything came out if they were mean to each other now. Though, some teasing was fun.
The choosing ceremony is tomorrow. I have no idea what I’m going to do. I have a feeling that Sam is going somewhere besides Abnegation. I definitely don’t want to be here if he is not. I love Bobby and Ellen as if they were blood, but I don’t think that I could remain in Abnegation without Sam. He’s the one that keeps me in line. He keeps me selfless. Without him I would probably be kicked out myself. I’d rather take a chance on a faction that suits me better, I just don’t know which one that is. I’ll spend what time I have left in Abnegation with Sam and Bobby and Ellen, and hope that something comes to me while I sleep. After dinner Sam says something kind of strange. He says that I need to think of the family tomorrow, but also about myself. I’m pretty sure he knows that I’m leaving Abnegation tomorrow and he’s telling me that it’s okay. Even with as gruff as Bobby can be he told us he loves us. I think he knows.
When we make it across the bridge and enter the building on the other side, there is a tiny area that is boxed in. He says that it’s a fear of confinement. Just then the walls start moving in and he tells me that a Dauntless would try to find a way to stop it. I look around trying to find anything, and just as I’m about to freak out myself I find some nails that are lying on the ground. He says that I’m doing well as I try to wedge them under the moving walls to slow them down. It takes a while though, and evidently, when he gets nervous he tries to make stupid jokes. He tells me to take my time, he’s just enjoying himself in the shrinking room. I can’t help the eye roll. I really am trying my best.
I ask him again, where they are controlling it from. This time he agrees to take us. Charles actually has the nerve to ask if I really had to shoot him. I explain to him that every minute that we waste another member of Abnegation dies and another Dauntless becomes a murderer, so yes, I really had to shoot him. He leads us through the tunnels even further, and I’m starting to think that I know where he’s taking us. I believe that we are going to the area that Lucifer was coming from the last time that I saw him here. I was right, as we get close, he hangs back. I look around the corner and there is Gordon and some other goons. I ask if it’s him, and he says yes. That’s when I tell them that I’ve seen Lucifer here before. John takes my spare gun, looking me in the eye and tells me that I’m the one that said there wasn’t a single second to waste.
“You will want to be around me. I know you will.” That actually made Cas feel better; evidently Dean was starting to understand how Cas felt. That or it was just the alcohol giving him even more confidence.
“Come on, I have ice cream and chocolate syrup. We can watch trashy comedy and pig out until we go into a sugar coma, just as long as we get to the fairgrounds in time for the bake off no one will ever know.” Sam smiled and climbed out of the truck.
We climb down and join the others. Once we let them know where the other team is they look to us on where to go next. Cas even asks me what the plan is. I slip into the leader roll, one that isn’t that hard for me to take on even though it isn’t really something that I’ve had to deal with. It almost comes naturally, especially with him by my side. I tell them that we need to split up into two groups. I’ll take a group up the side while the other group engages Uriel. We get inside and they yell out that they can see us. We run, Cas leads one group straight into the fire fight. My group goes along the side up to the watchtower that I saw their flag in.
As I’m leaving there are guards that come up and act like they’re going to take me away. They say that I need to go with them. The hell they say. I have been trained to fight and I do just that. I’ve knocked them both back when I hear the voice that fills my nightmares. Lucifer calls out for us to stop. They fall back and he asks if I’m alright. I tell him that I’m fine, but end up having to follow him anyway. He leads me through a room with people attached to monitors who appear to be going through sims, but we find our way to a table and chairs and he tells me to sit down. I do and he surprises the hell out of me by saying that he’s happy that I came there today. This surprises me so I blurt out, you are? He ignores my question and asks me if I am happy with my faction.
“Well, Sammy, to tell you the truth, he’s been shooting some really meaningful glances at Dean today. I just don’t want him to get hurt. I remember your brother’s reputation. I was in school with him, remember? And regardless of what he might think, not everyone in town thinks he’s quite as straight as he wants them to. Cas is just different; he doesn’t see the risks like I do. I don’t want him getting hurt, that’s all.” Gabe ended by repeating himself, and Sam saw that as very telling. He didn’t think that Gabe would be against their brother’s being together if he knew that Dean wasn’t just playing Cas.
“I knew there was something going on. Spill it, Samsquach. Do I need to be worried?” Gabe was trying to keep it light, but he really was concerned for his brother. Cas had been through enough; he didn’t need Dean hurting him and causing trouble with their family, on top of it.
Jack looked like he belonged in both of their families and Sam had teased Dean and Cas relentlessly that he was meant to be their child, but they just weren’t ready for that yet. Once the restaurant was on its feet a little bit more they were planning on looking into adoption as well. They simply wanted to make sure that they were able to devote the time that a little one would inevitably need and they weren’t quite there yet.
They had to have run to set up a base. Everyone is standing around arguing over what we are going to do and who will be the one to decide. I figure that while they are fussing over stuff that should be easy to figure out, I’m just going to go and see if I can see what’s going on. I begin climbing the ferris wheel and Cas comes up behind me. He asks what I’m doing and when I tell him that I’m trying to get a better vantage point, he agrees and begins to climb up after me. I tell him that he doesn’t have to come with me and he says that I should go easy. That I took a beating and need to be careful.
Sam grinned. Yeah, he knew where this was headed. “I’m sure there’s some left in here somewhere. You aren’t going to get tore up like he is are you? Although, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have any trouble carrying your short self up the stairs.”
“Okay, as I was saying, we don’t want to have to hide. So, to me that says what we have means something. I know it’s quick, and not something anyone is going to approve of, but I think he’s different. He told me he had feelings for me when we were younger, and those never went away. If that’s the case Gabe, then he’s loved me as long as I have loved him.
I didn’t want him to be taken from us. I didn’t want him to be taken from me. I wanted everything to stay the same, but that wasn’t what was going to happen. I convinced him that we could leave, we could run and join the factionless. What he did wasn’t that bad, but there are strict rules in the city. He wasn’t a member of Dauntless, so he should never have been out there chasing monsters. Just because he was born into that faction didn’t mean that once he was of age that he could continue leaving the fence. He hadn’t been supposed to in his youth, but boys will be boys.
Sam chuckled. “I wouldn’t dream of it, but you know this town. Don’t get too friendly in front of anyone or everyone will know.” With that, it seemed that their heavy conversation was over, and Sam took his overnight bag up to the spare room. Apparently, he was going to be staying with Dean for a bit. He didn’t care, of course, but it would have been nice if he had known beforehand. Now he had to get ready and head to the fairgrounds. It was almost time for the semi-finals.
I wake up with a jolt, and Cas is there asking if I’m alright. Lucifer is still off to the side talking with other Erudite and Dauntless leaders. Cas says that it all looked good to him and is trying to calm me down without showing too much concern. We meet in yet another area of Dauntless as Gordon welcomes all the new members of Dauntless. There is a lot of celebrating going on, but I don’t see Cas anywhere. Finally, as we are leaving and heading down the corridors, I hear Uriels voice. He’s telling people to get into lines. Benny asks what’s going on right before Uriel decides to tell us. He says that we are getting a tracking device. Cas hadn’t mentioned this, so it isn’t something that has been done before and my mind immediately goes to the serum that was being brought in my Erudite.
“Fine, bitch. I’ll make the food; you get to go buy the alcohol.” And that’s what they did. Dean decided that they needed some burgers to go with their beer. By the time Sam was back from the gas station, the food was ready, and they sat down to eat. With all the stress that Dean had put on himself lately, it was no surprise that he was putting away the beer faster than the food. Sam would just have to keep an eye on him.
This guy is crazy! Cas looked like he was intrigued by me as well. That’s good to know. We are evidently going to be playing some crazy capture the flag war game. The bullets are mini sims that feel like you are really being shot by a bullet. At least there is some good news. Cas chose me for his team. Uriel thinks he’s trying to gain sympathy for when we lose, but I think he wanted me on his team for some other reason.
He was trying to calm himself down without looking at Dean, since that seemed to give him away earlier, but he was finding it difficult. Looking at his brother just brought his attention to his mom, and that spiked a different kind of anxiety he really didn’t need right now. Looking over at Sam was a similar situation, because he was seated between Mary and John, and that brought to light the same anxiety. They had to do something about this. His nerves simply wouldn’t take much more.
Sam wasn’t fond of the nickname, but he was trying to do his brother a favor, so he let it slide. “I’m not sure what you are talking about, but I think I saw your brother talking to some of the contest officials. He may have stepped to the side to discuss something."
Of course she didn’t want to go talk to Naomi, but they weren’t leaving her much of a choice. When it came down to it they had always been the most creative when they had worked together and if they were going to pull off Dean’s plan then they were going to have to get super creative. Mary was fairly certain that Naomi wouldn’t even let them in the door, that was when she realized that Naomi’s sons were their ticket in. That was their purpose in this little group right now. Cas alone wouldn’t have been able to pull it off, but with Gabe backing him, she didn’t see Naomi telling them that she couldn’t even listen.
John was so brave that I just knew that he would be staying with Dauntless. I hadn’t prepared myself for having to choose between him and my home. When the time came, it was not a difficult choice to make, but looking back now, I wonder what would have been different. John had chosen Amity, and while it did suit him in a way, it wasn’t a perfect match. I was lucky that I also fit in, to an extent.
There were tables and vendors set up for those who were participating and those who were watching. It was almost like a part of the fair itself continued on. Dean was walking down one of the aisles, when he saw Cas talking to his brother Gabriel. Apparently, everyone was in town for the competition. He was honestly surprised Naomi hadn’t had Gabe step in for her instead of Cas; he was actually a baker, after all. It would have made more sense. Dean was rather glad she hadn’t, though. Without everything happening just the way it had, he probably never would have gotten his chance with Cas.
I went to find Joanna, she was the first to warn me that I was in danger here, she also covered for me when my tests were inconclusive. She tells me again about her friend that did so well in the second stage training that one of the head Dauntless leaders came to watch him on the final day. The next day he turned up dead at the bottom of the chasm. She said it was the Dauntless leadership and told me that I couldn’t let them find out about me. I asked her, what if they already know?'' She told me that if they already know, then I’m already dead.
I don’t know if it’s because I’m from Abnegation and I was raised to put others before myself or what, but I can’t see hurting someone just because you’re scared. I mean facing your fears and finding a way to overcome them is what the second stage of training is about. If he really wasn’t able to face his, to the extent that he would try to kill me, then he definitely wouldn’t pass this stage. Cas tells me that I should go lie down and I agree. He takes the floor. I feel a little bad about sleeping in his bed while he has to sleep on the concrete floor, but I don’t have the courage to tell him to join me. I’m not sure that I would ever be able to openly admit to him that it’s what I really want.
“I guess my biggest problem is that it just isn’t fair. It’s not fair that we have had to hide everything that we’ve done, even when we were only friends. They were able to talk and hang out from the very beginning, not sneak around at bakeries after midnight or behind ride trucks at the fairgrounds. I hate keeping us a secret Cas, this, you, it’s the first time I’ve ever really cared about letting people know.” They had already arrived at Cas’s house, but Dean wanted to get all of this out. He was afraid that if he waited that it would be pushed back under the rug like he usually tried to do with his feelings, but this was too important, Cas was too important.
Cas was feeling defensive, and he hadn’t ever admitted that out loud, he had barely started admitting it to himself, but this had to be said. Gabe had to understand how important this, how important Dean, was to him.
Cas got back to baking; they didn’t have long and he would need all of his time to make the pumpkin bread. At least he didn’t have to worry about having time for it to cool. Since they were in the first round, it would have time while the other participants took their turn.
“Yeah, that’s a good idea. Maybe after he sleeps a bit we can still talk. We have a few ideas, but nothing that seems like it would be any better than things that have been tried before. I know dad tried for a long time to get them to move past this, and it didn’t work.” Sam looked back to Gabe, who had a strange look on his face, but didn’t say anything else. Cas decided that was his cue to leave and went back to leading Dean up the stairs.
Mary expected Dean to carry on the feud between the Novaks and the Winchesters, but Dean had no problem with Castiel. In fact, they had been friends up until their mothers decided that they hated each other, and his friendship was something Dean really missed. He would participate in the bake off and try his best to win, but he wouldn’t be involved in the family feud his mother was trying to push.
Cas spotted him and took his phone out. Texting was the only way they seemed to be able to communicate when they were around everyone all the time, and they hadn’t had a chance to talk since this morning, when Sam so rudely woke them up. Dean was chuckling to himself when his phone beeped.
“Yeah, okay, I’m sorry. Go ahead then; explain to me why you are spending time with Dean Winchester. With everything going on with our families, it just isn’t something I was expecting. I mean, I know he looks good, but surely you know better than to be taken in by that, right?”
“Your winners for this year's Pumpkin Pie Bake Off, Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak!” The excitement in the building was palpable and Dean grabbed Cas up spinning him around in his enthusiasm. Then he planted a kiss right on Cas’s lips in front of everyone present, not caring what a single one of them thought about his actions.
We climb in silence then, only the sound of our breaths and our hands and feet finding the rungs as we go. Then one of the rungs breaks, years of rust has probably made this thing a death trap. He grabs my legs as I start to fall. Once I get my balance, he asks if I’m okay. No, I’m definitely not okay. It’s not the fall that has me shaken though, it’s how he ran his hand up my leg to my waist to steady me. I stutter out that I’m fine and continue climbing.
“I do not want to go in there.” Sam and Gabe had been sitting in the driveway of Cas’s house for a while now, but with Dean’s car in the driveway, neither one of them wanted to go inside.
Then I see Andrea. She’s Benny’s girlfriend and someone that I have grown close to over our training period. I can’t do this! I yell for her, but she keeps shooting. If I could just break her out of the sim then I wouldn’t have to hurt her. I yell her name over and over, but she keeps getting closer and is still shooting. I finally have no choice, I have to shoot her or she will kill me and my mother. As she drops, so does my stomach. I understand now why Cas has to turn his head when shooting an innocent. The look on Andrea’s face will haunt me forever. I don’t know how I will ever face Benny again.
“I get it. My mom always said if she wasn’t getting to compete against your mother, then it wasn’t any fun. I kind of get where she was coming from. If there isn’t any good competition, it isn’t a challenge.” Dean must have felt he was being too sappy and quickly added on, “That just means I have to get you trained up, so you can give me someone worth competing against.”
Since the profits were down, the bakery had a few things that needed fixing. One of those things being a leaky pipe in the walk in cooler. There were also loose boards and rusty racks, but they wouldn’t prove to be what ultimately did her in, so they weren’t quite as important. However, things add up and make a difference in their own way.
When I get back to the dorm area, everyone greets me with a pat on the back, or a good job. Everyone that is except Caleb, he comes up telling me about a story that has been released about my family. It talks about how there are problems in Abnegation, emphasized by both my brother and myself defecting. It went on talking about how there must be something going on there for all the children to be leaving their family and faction to go to another faction, even if their tests come up as Abnegation. That’s crazy, but it is one of the main reasons that I didn’t want to leave. That puts pressure on Bobby and Ellen that they really don’t need or deserve. They were wonderful parents, even to us, who weren’t theirs by blood. That’s just the kind of people they are. Bobby always told me that family doesn’t end with blood. This was always said when I was feeling down and like I didn’t really belong.
One of the other initiates, Garth, is having a really hard time at knives. Uriel tells him that he has to go get the knives that he just threw. They are laying on the ground by the targets that everyone is still throwing at. When he hesitates, Uriel tries to make a point. That if he is afraid to pick them up that he isn’t brave enough to be Dauntless. Garth makes the point that Uriel himself said there is a difference between brave and stupid. This doesn’t go over well with Uriel. He makes Garth stand in front of the target and tells Cas to throw the knives. If Garth flinches he’s automatically thrown out of Dauntless. I can’t stand by and let someone be bullied by Uriel, especially not someone that I consider a friend. Just before Cas throws the first knife I speak up.
“Please tell me that you are pretending to be this dense.” After a moment of Sam just looking back at him in response Gabe huffed out a chuckle. “Well, maybe not. I thought that there was no way that you hadn’t picked up on it considering the side eye that your brother has been giving me all afternoon. I thought you were the smart one, maybe it’s just because he’s got those rose colored glasses going for him right now.”
“Sure, we can talk. It’ll be nice to get away from all of this commotion for a little while. I have a few questions for you anyway.” With that, Sam led Gabriel the opposite direction from where he had seen his brother and Cas head into the orchard.
The bell out front announced someone was at the door, but the store had been closed for a few hours. That meant it was probably Dean. Castiel looked down at himself and his work space and decided Dean had the worst timing possible. He was covered in flour and bits of batter; there was even some on his nose that he hastily wiped off before entering the main store area of the bakery.
“We can talk later. I really don’t have time to get into everything, but just know it isn’t what you think. You need to keep an open mind, because I didn’t, and it only made things worse. They have some stuff going on involving the competition, but they have some personal stuff going on too. Talk to Cas, and then I think that we all need to have a conversation as well.” Sam figured that covered enough that Gabe wouldn’t ask too many questions before he talked to Cas, and it really wasn’t Sam’s place to tell him what was going on.
“Bitch.” With that they went the rest of the way into the building and found their places. The semi-finals were getting ready to start.
Winning the bake off wasn’t some magic cure all, but it did make it a little easier on both the Winchesters and the Novaks. It might not have been in the way that they originally had planned, but with their families not arguing anymore, it opened a lot of doors for possibility. Three years down the road and the families had undergone some changes. Not only emotionally, but financially and physically as well.
“Okay. I can’t say I understand how you feel about Dean, because I have never been very fond of him, but if you say this is important to you, then I support you. The biggest problem I see is mom. She is never going to let you be with a Winchester; not as long as her and Mary are still feuding. To her, the most important thing is the bakery, and that feud has kept people coming in for years.” Gabe felt for his brother, but he couldn’t see a way around their mother.
Dean continued making breakfast. He had bacon and biscuits already going, and just as he was about to start the eggs, something caught his attention. They were running a special on the news about the contest. That wasn’t necessarily what drew his eye though. There on the tv was Betty, and she was discussing what kind of pie she was going to make for the contest.
“And the fact that we have to hide to even hang out is ridiculous! Sam and Gabe don’t have to hide. They can just go out to a bar and hang out instead of having to meet up in the garage. That’s the worst part. Just because they moved out of town and aren’t around all the time, they aren’t expected to keep this thing going. I don’t want to have to argue with you just to make them happy. I want to be able to kiss you and not worry about anyone seeing us.” Cas was done with this; he had stopped Dean from drinking anymore, but he thought that maybe Dean should take a nap, because right now this was pointless.
After what seemed like a lifetime, the announcer came on stage and announced he would call the names of the finalists, and they would need to come back up on stage. It wasn’t like they were very far; the semi-finalists had been corralled just down below the stage so they would have easy access through the crowd of people when the finalists were announced.
He knocks me onto the ground again, but this time there’s a gun. I point it at him to start with, but I remember that it wouldn’t do any good that way. Everyone is surrounding us now, he’s made his way over top of me, but I have an idea. I turn the gun on myself. He takes the opportunity for what it is, grabbing the gun. I tell him over and over that it’s me, and it’s okay, and that I love him. He closes his eyes and goes to turn away, just like he did in his fear landscape, and this is where I lose if I’m not careful. I grab his face, turning his head back and tell him to look at me. It’s really me. Then, there’s a shift, the look of recognition crosses his face and he says my name.
Dean had taken his mother up on the offer of running the restaurant alone, well without her. Cas had decided that he wanted to help both businesses, but he works mainly with Dean in their family restaurant, A Slice of Life. It’s not super fancy, but then again in Lawrence, they wouldn’t want it to be. You can come in, sit around the table and food is served family style. It’s something that wasn’t offered here before and has been a great hit amongst the residents.
“I’m going to help him to his room. I want to be in on this conversation, but he needs to lay down and try to sleep this off a bit.”
“Well, first of all Betty should mind her own business, and before you go defending her you should know that she is the main reason that we are here. Besides spying on us, she has also been stealing from us. She took Cas’s idea for his pie and my idea for my crust. Then, she went on the news and announced what kind of pie she was making, essentially ruining our chances of actually using the recipes that we had planned or making us look like the thieves.” Dean wasn’t done, but it looked like Mary wasn’t going to be able to contain herself for much longer, so he paused to let her go ahead and get it out.
It was Garth that they eventually pulled over the edge. Benny and Charlie look at me but neither says anything. I might not have wanted him near me anymore, but that would have been solved by him being cut and sent to live with the factionless. I didn’t want him to kill himself. The guilt builds inside of me until I can’t take it anymore and head back through the tunnel like hallways that are common in Dauntless.
Climbing into the pick up wasn’t easy, but Gabe wasn’t going to show his struggle. So, after huffing and puffing and climbing up into the giant truck, he decided that he would take the attention off of himself and direct it back at Sam. “How did you know I’m staying at Cas’s house?”
He tried a few times to get me to stop, and yes I am human, he did ask. I just wanted to be able to get a good vantage point. When I do stop, he climbs up even with me. I tell him that it isn’t too bad, he agrees, but I don’t believe him. It’s an amazing view. I can see all the way across the park. I enjoy a few seconds with only me and Cas in a little bubble on top of the world. I have to be careful, I could see myself falling for him, and that would be dangerous. I spot Uriel’s team flag and point it out to Cas.
Danger isn’t something that they, we, think about too much. I guess if I think about it, we are kind of dumb with some of the stunts that we pull, but it makes me feel alive. Alive is something that I haven’t felt in a long time, if ever, living in Abnegation.
Cas finds me and tries to talk to me, but I just want to be alone right now. The guilt for causing him to kill himself is eating me alive and I just want to be able to break down where no one can see me. He follows though and tells me that he heard about Garth and that he is sorry. He knows that we were close before last night, but he missed the exchange in the commons earlier, he doesn’t know that I told him I would kill him. He doesn’t know that I flat out refused his apology. He doesn’t know that it was my fault.
He had never been given any indication that Dean was interested in men, but then again, he hadn’t been allowed around Dean in a decade. There could be many things he didn’t know about him, and just because Cas hadn’t kept his sexuality a secret, didn’t mean that Dean had to announce his. The looks and little touches that had been shared between the two wasn’t something Cas had shared with anyone in the past who wasn’t a romantic partner. Maybe this was just how Dean was in the kitchen; Cas didn’t know that either. He was starting to believe he didn’t know anything about Dean at all.
“Why did you run off and leave me to ride with mom alone? You know how she gets after one of these things, and it’s bound to be worse this year because she isn’t in it. I had to, uh, I had to get a ride with someone, and then I get here and Dean Winchester is pulling out of the driveway. What the hell are you thinking, Castiel?” This was not how Gabe wanted to start the conversation, especially after he had promised Sam he would try to be open minded.
“You do know that this disqualifies you from this year’s bake off, right?” The announcer did not look saddened in the least with this information. “You need to go on now, and get off the stage.” Betty did as she was directed, but was very displeased with the outcome.
We pass a couple arguing with the Dauntless, at the same moment that a shot goes out. Cas grabs my arm having me continue. He tells me to just keep moving, that there is nothing I can do. He then asks me where my house was. We seperate from the group and make our way to the tiny house that was my home for most of my life. We enter with our guns raised, just like everyone else that is a part of Dauntless, but that is where the similarities end with us. The moment that we are in the door, the guns are down and we are searching for my family. We split up a bit and continue searching. When we still don’t find them anywhere in the house, he asks where else they might be. The problem is that I have no idea.
If Sam and I both leave, that will leave Bobby and Ellen alone. I don’t want them to think that they have done something wrong in the way that they raised their children. They have been the best parents that anyone could ask for, I just don’t know if I can be as selfless as I would have to be to remain in Abnegation. I guess I have to wait and let the test tell me where I belong. I keep being told to trust the test, guess it’s time I do that. The only problem is that Sam seems as down as I feel right now, and doesn’t want to go to bed either. It’s like he wants to spend that extra few minutes with the family.
Sam doesn’t seem to see that though. He was actually defending him at a discussion between our parents and another member of the committee. Sam is also headstrong. If he believes something to be the truth he will fight like no other to get his point across. Because of this, I think he would also fit in well with Candor. I used to joke and tell him that he would be a lawyer one day. Now, I don’t even want to joke about it. There is a very good chance that I won’t be with my brother after the choosing ceremony. Bobby and Ellen’s daughter Joanna turned eighteen last year and at her choosing ceremony she defected and chose Dauntless. That just adds one more worry to the pile going into the ceremony the day after tomorrow.
Dean wanted to expand the bakery to include other types of food. After all, he had spent five years in France, and he didn’t spend all that time away with the intention of limiting himself to making pies and scones. He had tried, on several occasions, to convince his mother they needed a full service restaurant, but she would never risk what she had built. Dean didn’t want to leave his mom to run the bakery alone, but he wanted to do more with his education.
Over a hundred years ago, there was a great war. The war between supernatural beings and humans was long and it tore the world as we knew it to pieces. There weren’t many humans left, but those that were banded together and created the city. It has high walls that keep us safe from those supernaturals that are still out there. Living in the city is what we are used to.
Then Sam’s name is called. He placed a hand on my shoulder and looked into my eyes. I try to express understanding. I know he will not be Abnegation any longer. I hope he knows that I respect the choice that he is making. I wonder yet again if maybe he had the same problems with his testing that I did. I can’t ask though. He chooses Erudite. I knew that it was coming, but Lucifer’s grin is still enough to make me worry. He looks as if he wants to welcome Sam into his arms, but settles for a handshake. I really don’t like him. Bobby and Ellen are holding hands and they look so sad. Ellen tells me that she loves me. My family is not one to say those words. We aren’t overly expressive, but if they are going to be said now is the time, I guess.
Naomi came down the stairs and never took her eyes off of Mary, who was still standing just inside the door. “Why is she here? I know we need to talk about some things, Betty came by earlier and I was very surprised at what she had to say. I’m guessing this is about that?” This last part was aimed at Castiel and he seemed to shrink under her glare, but Dean wasn’t going to have that, he was done seeing people talk down to Cas and he sure as hell wasn’t going to stand here and watch Cas’s own mother do it.
“I don’t care if you can dance, I just want to be close to you.” Dean had never been one to show too much emotion, but cas was bringing out a completely different side and he didn’t think it was such a bad thing. Dean laid his head against Cas’s and continued to sway, just being in each other's arms, that was until there was a clearing of a throat behind them and he glanced up to find Gabe and Sam watching them.
Leaving the building was, of course, a chore. There were so many well wishers and others who were simply hanging around, wanting to see if there were any developments between the Novaks and the Winchesters. Each family was trying to leave, but there seemed to be a never ending stream of people. Sam, who had a height advantage and was able to see over everyone, spotted Gabe sneaking out a side exit and excused himself from his mother's side, allowing her to continue the discussion about pumpkin scones with the lady from down the street. He didn’t know why she kept trying; his mother was never going to give up that recipe, no matter how many times she asked.
“Uh, we’re friends. He seems to care a lot about his brother, and about you. Sam’s not a bad guy, not to mention he grew up pretty damn good looking too. I don’t know what it is about those Winchester genes, but they make some pretty sons. Anyway, I’m getting off topic, What are we going to do about mom? Am I to assume that this big talk everyone keeps mentioning has something to do with that?” Jesus, Gabe hated it when he blushed. He just couldn’t seem to hide embarrassment at all, and he was a little embarrassed when it came to the giant moose. He liked being around Sam, and he hadn’t been lying about him growing up to look like a freaking model.
“Meh, shut up. We need to get some stuff done before we head to Dean’s. This place is a mess.” Gabriel couldn’t deny it, so he simply brushed it off and found something that he could throw back at Cas. The house really wasn’t messy, except for maybe the room Gabe was using, because the man really was like living with a toddler.
Castiel had been surprised, yet very happy, that he had made it through to the next round. He would work hard and get that recipe down before the semi-finals. His mother coming down with a cold was both a blessing and a curse. He was pretty sure the only reason he made it past the first round was because of her helping him during practice, but it also meant she wouldn’t be standing over his shoulder, or across the room, criticizing his every move.
Since Gabe was making no moves to get out of the truck, Sam pulled past the drive and started towards Dean’s house. He wasn’t sure what Gabe was expecting tonight, hell he wasn’t even sure what he was expecting. They had known each other growing up and had become fairly good friends over the last week, but they had only had their first kiss today and he wasn’t sure where Gabe saw this going. He wanted to make sure that they were on the same page before things went too far, and if that meant that they had to have another conversation then so be it, that is what they would do.
“I guess we need to talk about things, now that everyone is sober and starting to wake up. I’ll wake Sammy, and we can get started.” Dean excused himself from his kitchen and went to wake his brother.
Cas snickered, but did as Dean had asked, heading to the bathroom to take his shower while Dean texted his brother and made himself another cup of coffee. He had gotten ready in the bathroom, so he really didn’t have anything else to be doing while he waited on Cas. While he was drinking it, he wondered what would happen today. He was hopeful that it would come as a shock to Betty that they would team up. Surely, she knew that they would have seen the broadcast and not be making the same thing.
She wanted to start repairing bridges where she could and saving the boys' chance at winning was going to be her start. To get there however, she had to mend a few others first, starting with Naomi. “I know that I am the last person that you want to talk to right now, but can you at least hear the boys out? Betty did them really wrong, and I’m not talking about coming to us, there is more. They need our help. Will you at least listen to them?”
The kids only added to the mix. When they were younger their children had actually been children and would be playing in the other room at the house, but now they were there helping, actually contributing to ideas, in Dean’s case and keeping track of what they had tried and what they wanted to try next, in Cas’s. It was a good system, Dean was starting to relax, there was a pretty good chance that they were going to pull this off. He was so happy that when a song came on the radio that was great for dancing, Dean didn’t even think twice about getting up and pulling Cas in for a slow  dance.
Coming out of the bathroom, Dean noticed that it was really quiet and decided that he needed to check where everyone was. He walked into the kitchen, finding Cas sitting alone at the table sipping on what looked to be another cup of coffee. He must have noticed Dean’s confusion though, because he seemed to answer Dean’s thoughts. “They decided to go ahead and meet up with our mothers at the fairgrounds. Gabe rode with Sam. Do you care to give me a lift?”
“Thanks, Sammy. Hey, actually that’s what we were talking about. Gabe is staying with Cas for a while, and Cas was afraid that if we both move on to the next round, we won’t be able to get together as easily. Do you think you could, maybe, distract Gabe again? Maybe even a few times? I’m not asking you to do this for a simple romp in the hay, but for actual practice for the competition. It may not even matter if both of us don’t make it through this round, but if we do, I would really appreciate the help.” Dean held the puppy dog's eyes for as long as could, but his brother's were better than his and finally he broke with a grin. He knew that he could convince his brother and soon Sam was smiling back at him.
“Yeah, Dean wants the four of us to get together tonight and see if we can come up with an idea to try to get our mothers to stop hating each other. Evidently, that would help not only me and Dean, but you and Sam as well. I know that look, and that was a very lovely red that just ran all over your face when I asked about Sam, so don’t try to deny it.” Cas very rarely had something to tease his brother about - it was usually the other way around - so he was definitely going to take advantage of the opportunity.
Cas was agreeing before Dean had even finished talking. He needed some time with Dean as badly as Dean seemed to need the time with him. “Let’s go before he gets back. He seems to be interested in your brother; maybe that will keep him distracted for a little while.” With that, they left the fair ground and headed out into the orchard.
“For the first time, I want everyone to know that you make me happy and that what we have is special. I hope that after tomorrow I’ll be able to do just that, but it just makes me so mad that they haven’t had to do that. Why is it that, just because we both came back to help out with the bakeries that we have to hate each other? Why is it that, since they stayed away, they don’t? Why is it okay for them to be seen sitting together at the semi-finals and we had to sneak around? It’s not fair, Cas, it’s not fair to me and it sure as hell isn’t fair to you.” Dean stopped to wipe the tears that he didn’t realize had begun falling down his cheeks.
There, I ran into the very first person that I had to fight in our training session. He kicked my butt that first day, but I am able to take him down this time. I guess it helps when I have a tangible goal that I can see. It probably doesn’t hurt for me to know that if I don’t succeed I’m gone. There’s no way around that. I can see Cas and Uriel talking to each other down below. He just ran right in and gave us cover. He might be one of the craziest people that I have met, not in a bad way. He’s very protective, I can see that easily. He’s smart though too. It’s like he only allows certain people to see certain things about him. It’s really not a bad idea. I grab the flag once the guy is down and go out onto the platform in the building.
Just as he started to step forward though, Mary surprised him by placing her hand on his arm and stepping forward herself. “It does have to do with Betty, and I’m sure that you all had a similar conversation to the one that she and I had, but that isn’t the main reason for our visit.” She was proud of herself for remaining calm, again, she didn’t want this to end badly for either family.
“Where are you two going?” Sam stepped around the corner before they could make it out of the room, which was probably a good thing. That way, if he did manage to get Dean to take a nap, they wouldn’t disturb him.
“Why would you bring Novaks in this house? You know, Betty told me something yesterday that I just couldn’t believe, but looking at you all now I just don’t know.” Then, Mary looked between Sam who was sitting on the couch and Gabe who was standing behind him looking more like a pit bull then anything that she had ever seen in her life. “What do you two have to do with this? She told me that she had seen these two sneak off to make out in the orchard, but that doesn’t have anything to do with you. What’s going on?”
Now, though, he wasn’t really sure what to do. He had a cup of coffee for Cas that he didn’t want to get cold and there was another cup waiting downstairs for Gabe. He also wanted a chance to talk to Cas before they left for the final round. Deciding that he really didn’t want to wait, Dean knocked on the door. When the conversation seemed to pause he let himself in.
He couldn’t stand to see the defeat in Dean’s eyes and quickly encouraged him. “That is a great start. We just need to figure out how to get you from point A to point B. That’s what I’m here to do, remember?”
“I thought that you wanted to know where Gabe and I came into this, it may not be as exciting as Dean and Cas getting together, but we wanted to help bring our families back together. There was a time that we were all practically family and yes things change, but Gabe and I have talked about it, we really think that these two idiots over here love each other. They shouldn’t have to stay apart because of some feud that is not even between them.”
I pull the knife from his hand and the screen and hold it to his throat, telling him, yet again, to shut it down. He says that he admires that I am willing to die for what I am trying to do, but so is he. He calls me out, saying that I can’t kill him. I’m running out of time, the members of Dauntless that are showing on the screen have their guns aimed at Abnegation. I look around the room and take in what is showing on each of the screens, but as I’m doing this I see one of the simulation pods lying on the floor, and I get an idea. He says that maybe I’m not quite as Dauntless as I thought I was, and while he meant it as something derogatory, I take it as a compliment. I tell him he’s right, I’m not, I’m divergent.
Dean was trying really hard not to laugh at Castiel; it was simply too adorable, and in the end, he couldn’t hide the snicker. “Maybe stir with the spoon instead of the mixer. Here, let me show you something.” And, just like that, Dean took over Castiel’s training.
“I don’t mean to be a bother, but isn’t that against the rules?” Betty thought that surely this wasn’t something that they could do. They couldn’t team up in the final round, that wouldn’t be fair. Would it?
“Quit using your mommy’s recipes, Winchester.” Cas knew that he was in fact using his mother’s recipe as well, but it was something, and he didn’t really know what to say to Dean’s comment. He knew that they would have to do this, but he really didn’t have a come back for Dean’s statement. He really had almost burnt down the bakery, twice.
One by one Dauntless are lining up to take the weapons. They really have made an army. There’s a guy who comes stumbling into the room after everyone else has lined up. He’s still pulling on his clothes as he tries to ask another Dauntless member what is going on. He tries another, asking what we are doing. After a second or two I hear Gordon speak to Uriel once again. He tells him that the guy is divergent. Uriel must take that as some kind of a signal. He goes up to the guy and tells him not to worry about anything, that it’s going to be alright. Then he shoots him in the head. There isn’t any hesitation, and he doesn’t seem to be bothered at all. Divergents must be dealt with.
“Stop! Anyone can stand in front of a target and it doesn’t prove anything.” This is how I find myself standing in front of the target with Cas’s icy stare trying to bore holes in my head. Garth covered the entire target and I’m not sure that he has the same faith in Cas that I do. It’s not hard for me to stand here and let him throw the knives. He hits me on the last throw though and when I confront him about it, he says that Uriel wouldn’t have let him stop without drawing blood. He’s probably right, and he barely nicked my ear anyway.
After another round of staring between us he asks why I say that. I can’t help the chuckle that escapes my throat as I tell him that he already knows why. He’s been asking me questions that tell me he has known for a while, but I haven’t been able to tell him anything. I don’t tell him now either, but he nods, confirming that he already knew. I tell him that as soon as all the others find out that I’m going to be dead, but he interrupts me before I can say anymore. He tells me that he isn’t going to let that happen. This is another moment that I believe he sees something in me that I am trying to keep hidden. He has figured out my biggest secret, maybe he knows how I really feel about him as well.
“I get it. Thanks, Sammy. Just, uh, don’t tell mom. Please?” Dean hated that he sounded so small when it came to keeping this from his mother, but before everything that happened, he had been really close to her. Now that he was having to keep this a secret from her, it was killing him. They hadn’t ever been as close as they were before the blow out, but they had been working on it, and them sharing the bakery for years had helped that. He really hoped this wasn’t what would push them completely apart.
I guess my body gives up on finding a place to be alone to break down. I lose it and start crying. I tell him that it’s my fault, but he argues that no, it wasn’t because of me. That it was Garth’s choice. It was his choice to attack me last night and it was his choice to take his life today. He tells me that Garth would have been factionless, that he wasn’t going to make it past the final test. I tell him that neither am I. That gets his attention and he levels me that stare that should probably be intimidating, but I only find endearing.
“I have a proposal. What if we help each other?” Dean wasn’t sure how Castiel would react, but he didn’t seem too opposed to Dean as a person, so maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as he feared.
I wake up in the infirmary that has been set up for initiates. Benny and Garth are there and they look sad. They have on some military type vests and that means that I’m about to miss training if I stay here. When I ask about it, they say that Uriel cut me. I’m out. I can’t be out. I will be Dauntless. They leave so that they won’t miss the train. I get changed and run after. I made it. Cas watched me run along the platform for a few seconds, but eventually helped me up onto the train. For a second I didn’t think Uriel was going to let me back in that easy. I guess he liked my determination.
When Mary and Naomi had their blowout, it had affected more than just their friendship. Chuck and John had been golfing buddies for years, and Dean and Cas had been as close as brothers. John had silently agreed with everything that Mary dictated, but it was harder for Dean. He was upset about losing his friend, and it was the first time he and his mother had such a serious argument.
This was their opportunity, at least she was asking questions instead of simply ordering them out of the house. Betty also provided them with an entrance to the conversation that they needed to have without even knowing it. Dean wasn’t going to deny his feelings for Cas, especially when he looked over and saw him staring at the floor like someone had kicked his puppy. He walked over to Cas and placed a hand on his elbow, letting him know that he was still there, standing right beside him and that he wasn’t going anywhere.
Castiel just shook his head and looked back at the mess covering the tables and himself. “No, the bread seems to think that I have personally offended it’s mother and is now out for retribution. Any advice?”
Dean and Cas worked flawlessly together by this point and most of the time they knew what the other needed without even having to use words. The hours that they had spent baking together while they were getting ready for this were really paying off. Cas’s directions, that he had written down as they went through the different experiments, were perfect and Dean’s cooking added just enough flair to keep the audience intrigued.
“Sam, Sammyyyyyy! Yo, bean pole, come on. Your little boyfriend is already awake and in the kitchen making a candy bar in a cup. It’s time to rise and shine!”
I’m in a building in the old city when I hear a scream. Someone goes flying by over my head on a zipline that Dauntless set up. I had once been Dauntless, and had heard stories about the zipline, but I never did get to experience it. When I attended my choosing ceremony, I was already in love with an amazing young man who was also from Dauntless. I followed him and left my home and my family.
