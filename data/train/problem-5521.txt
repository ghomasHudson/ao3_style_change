He pulls his fingers out slowly, smiling at the results. “Here’s what you’re gunna do for me,” Steve tells him, pressing his fingers back in. Tony bites his lip, throwing his head back a little. “First of all not that, I want to hear you. Wanna see you. So don’t fuckin hold back on me,” Steve tells him. “Now, what you’re gunna do,” he murmurs as he pulls his fingers out again, leaning over Tony. “Is finger yourself, open yourself up for me and I want it to be good too. Give me a show,” Steve tells him.
who likes mornings. They remain silent for a long moment, mostly enjoying each other’s company in silence or maybe that’s just Tony not wanting to talk without morning coffee because there
yeah that’s good,” he says, breath hitching as Bucky hits the right spot. “I… M’getting close,” he tells them.
He turns back to Steve, “I can see why you brought him home.” People don’t talk to them like that; perk of being pretty widely feared even though they aren’t much known for lethal force. But still, people don’t stand up to them often and to a point they count on that to operate. Not that Tony gives a shit and Bucky likes that about him, knows Steve does too. ‘Course, if anyone decided to overstep their bounds with Tony they’d regret it faster than immediately.
“Wait, can you ride me facing that way- I, uh-” words fail him for a minute as his cheeks turn more red.
.” Tony tilts his hips up again, a silent invitation for Steve to continue. Steve sits back a little, one hand settling on his thigh while he carefully teases at Tony’s hole with the other. Tony moans, head bending back to expose his throat a little. “
Tony snickers, “I can deal with that, at least as long as you aren’t a jackass,” he murmurs as he leans in and kisses Steve.
“Shoulda worn it when I had exams. I’ve never failed anything,” he says. Not true, he failed high school English several times because who gives a fuck what a metaphor is and that’s not an important subject anyway but MIT classes? Total breeze- there’s no way he’d fail classes in which he’s smarter than the people teaching them and yeah, he should have just brought the uniform over just to tease Steve over an extended period of time. “Coulda fulfilled that fantasy of yours a long time ago,” Tony says, “coulda made you wait the whole month for this,” he points out.
Steve pulls away and Tony makes an annoyed noise at the loss. Steve shakes his head at him and runs his hand up the inside of Tony’s thigh before reaching over and running his fingers through Bucky’s hair. Bucky tries to pull away but it’s too late. “Asshole,” Bucky tells Steve. “Do you know how hard it is to get slick out of your hair?”
“Well if you’re going to waste your opportunity I might as well get something out of it,” Bucky says, clearly confident that he’s not about to be turned down. Steve shakes his head at him as Tony sticks his head out the bathroom door, obviously scooping the room out. Steve gives him an apologetic look. “Hey, Tony,” Bucky says easily and Tony, clearly not stupid, knows what’s coming and gives him a look.
, yeah, okay,” Bucky murmurs and he presses in. Tony lets out a long moan, pushing himself back onto Bucky. “
,” Steve yells from the living room and Tony sighs, pulling his ass out of bed and stumbling his way to the living room.
- figure it out its always good,” he murmurs, leaning forward a little to give Steve better access to his hole. “Like-
He repeats his actions, pulling Bucky’s hair harder this time and he’s rewarded with a tighter grip on his hip and Bucky panting against his shoulder blade. “Okay, okay,” he murmurs, pressing a kiss to Tony’s shoulder. He starts moving his way down Tony’s back, his fingers detangling from Bucky’s hair as he goes, leaving a trail of kisses down his back. He stops at Tony’s tailbone, leaving a soft kiss there before he pulls away. “Ass up,” he tells Tony, patting his hip.
When Tony picks up his pace in earnest Steve and Bucky’s grips on him get tighter. Steve guides his movements a little and Bucky drops his hands from his thighs in favor of running his hands up Tony’s arms, down his back, and over his thighs again like he’s trying to touch every inch of skin he can reach. “Like that, Tony,” Steve tells him as he guides his hips, “
too. Not that he planned that, the in between parts of the sex bit make them not worth his while if he can help it. And he can do the sex thing any time so frankly the entire thing is just a pain in his ass, figuratively of course.
Rhodey actually short circuits at that. “Sam!” he calls over his shoulder, “Sam get over here my white boy is dumber than yours by a
Bucky makes a soft, appreciative noise as he runs his hand up Tony’s back slowly before getting to his neck and curling his fingers around the back of it. Tony can’t help the small shiver he lets out as Bucky leans in, pressing more weight into the back of his neck. “You gunna cooperate for me, baby?” Bucky murmurs in his ear.
He crawls onto the bed, making his way up to Steve slowly. Steve tracks his every move carefully, leaning forward a little as Tony ducks down and noses at the inside of his thigh a little before nipping at the area. With jeans in the way it’s a little pesky, but it serves its purpose given the way Steve sucks in a breath when he does it. “Come up here,” Steve tells him, reaching out for him. Tony grins, obliging Steve as he crawls closer. The look on his face when Tony runs his led up the inside of Steve’s thigh is so worth it.
Tony rolls his eyes. “This isn’t my first rodeo sweet cheeks. I’ve gotten out of tougher situations than this.” He doesn’t really expect to be punched in the face but that’s the response he gets. Fucking assholes. “Do you honestly expect me to find that scary?” Howard has hit him harder than that and even if he hadn’t being beaten to a pulp hurts like hell but it’s not scary. Granted he doesn’t think they’d every figure out what he
,” he whines in an attempt to appeal to Steve’s polite side. It works because Steve’s fingers tighten around his throat just a little and Tony can’t help it, he cums with a loud moan, hand curled over Steve’s. For a solid ten seconds he swears he loses touch with the world until the pleasure fades enough for him to notice Steve breathing heavily onto his shoulder while Bucky looks satisfied, but confused.
He does his best to hold in his excitement at that and he’s sure he fails at it though he follows Bucky’s instructions quickly. He earns a pleased noise out of Bucky for doing so too. After a few moments of nothing Tony wiggles his ass a little, a silent invitation for Bucky to get a move on. Bucky’s hand touches his hip finally, sliding up his side and back down again as Bucky crawls in closer, nudging Tony’s legs apart as he does. Tony obliges, spreading his legs a little wider and grinning when Bucky sucks in a breath. “That’s it,” Bucky murmurs, sliding a hand up Tony’s ass, settling on the small of his back for a moment. “You look good like this,” Bucky tells him; thumb caressing the small of his back.
“Doesn’t mean I can’t watch,” Tony says a little primly. Steve smiles at him again and grabs the dildo with one hand and reaches out to Tony with the other, feeling his hole. “You think you’ll be okay?” Steve asks, sliding two fingers in and Tony bites his lip, nodding. “What did I tell you about that?” Steve says. Tony huffs out a sigh because he can’t help it, its instinct.
Rhodey nods. “Cool, we’ve established that you’re as stupid as they come can you stop being like that and like… move in with literally anyone else?”
“Wouldn’t be impatient if you gave me what I wanted,” Tony tells him. Bucky shakes his head and shifts Tony’s head to the side, pressing his face into Tony’s neck and
“Well don’t take forever,” Tony tells him. “You know I have a small attention span.” He doesn’t, not for this anyway. He’s always liked being the center of attention and he’s discovered that he
Steve drops his sticks beside what Tony assumes will at some point be a fire and perches himself on the log Tony is grudgingly perched on. He’d prefer
Tony can’t help the small moan he lets out as Steve’s hand moves back up his body, slowly making its way up the expanse of his back and when he reaches the nape of Tony’s neck he wraps his hand around it. He doesn’t squeeze or try and wrangle Tony’s head in one direction or the other like some alphas have, he just lets his hand sit there as a soft sign of reassurance. The action makes Tony shiver, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck again as he moans into his mouth. The fingers on his neck flex a little and Tony lets out a small noise of pleasure as he tangles a hand in Steve’s hair, tilting his head to the side and all but shoving Steve’s face into his neck.
appreciate me saying. It’s funny now, but I was concerned then- his poor penis was a medical emergency. Anyway, we went to the hospital and clearly little Rhodey recovered just fine, and I do know this because I was on Dick Checking Duty for like a month and
“It’s a better angle if you want to watch me fuck you in the skirt,” Tony guesses and given the redness level on Steve’s face he’s right. He shakes his head, smiling because Steve is nothing if not predictable. Its one of the things Tony both loves and hates about him. “Ready?” he asks Steve and he laughs.
Thankfully Tony solves the debate for them by lifting his head and glaring at Steve, hair wild and eyes narrowed. “One,
suggested and you sure shit don’t get to be mad at Bucky when I did the same damn thing and you’re clearly not pissed at me.” Like Bucky should be held more responsible for their collective actions than Tony should be, they did the
Steve moans into Tony’s neck and he pulls his hand away from Tony’s ass. “You are so fucking hot,” Steve tells him. “
“No, I’d do that anyway. Go on,” Steve tells him, prodding him forward. Tony shakes his head but turns to go, letting out a soft yelp as Steve smacks his ass. That’s so more Bucky’s thing than his but he’ll take it.
“Bossy,” Bucky tells him but obliges, picking up the pace of his movements and letting out a small noise of appreciation as Tony moans. “You always this easy?” Bucky asks him as Tony pants a little.
out of these fucking clothes.” Steve hesitates for a moment, one hand moving to the hem of his shirt and pausing there for a moment. Tony has no time for that though so he reaches out and pulls the shirt off himself, tossing it aside. Its not like he hasn’t seen Steve shirtless before but damn he looks
to be what gets Steve going, flipping them over so he’s poised over Tony before kissing him hard. Tony moans into it, legs curling up to Steve’s waist as he pins one of Tony’s hands above his head. He lets out a moan at that too, because that’s also a thing for him. Steve kisses down his neck, nipping at the skin there and Tony gasps, back arching a little into him. “You want me to use you? That something you like?” he asks harshly and Tony nods as words fail him. “
“What the fuck Steve, were you planning on reenacting the entirety of Shrek over there while I was left out in the cold?” he asks. Steve snorts and starts laughing as Tony climbs onto the bed and over to Bucky.
“If you keep talking like that I think I’ll be fucked,” he mumbles. Tony pulls his hand away from his ass and looks around his body at Steve. His cheeks are flushed and he’s got his hand around the base of his cock like that’ll help much.
They’re curled up on the bed and Tony needs a shower before he feels too hot again but he also doesn’t want to move. Steve prods him gently and Tony swats him away. “You need to shower,” Steve murmurs. “Come on, I’ll wash you,” he adds.
“Shh, I’ve got you. Take your shirt off,” he tells Tony softly and alright, he can do that. He strips his shirt off and tosses it aside with little care for where it lands and Tony gasps softly when Steve’s hands land on his bare hips, thumbs stroking his hip bones softly. “You look beautiful like this,” Steve tells him, looking over his body. Tony can see the lust there and he knows he’s probably way ahead of Steve as far as arousal goes, everything is so much more intense with heats, but the way Steve is looking at him makes him wonder how accurate that assessment is. Steve smiles a little, biting his lip before he full on grins and kisses Tony again, enthusiasm obvious.
to get caught in a blast or two it just worked out that way and he knows his shit. He’s got bruised ribs but its not that bad, he’s had worse. He supposes its probably kind of fucked up that Howard has done more damage than actual explosives but in Howard’s slight defense the explosions weren’t really that large.
acting like a giant jackass. You were the one who brought up that you and Bucky share everything, which seems to be true from what I’ve witnessed. And
of your ass, make peace with my relationship with Bucky, and Bucky, come here,” he says, reaching out and wiggling his fingers. Bucky shakes his head, smiling a little as he comes over and takes Tony’s hand when he gets close enough. He seems surprised when Tony yanks him onto the bed and Steve, little
long and you manage to try and torment him by doing something he considers a huge turn on?” he asks, frowning at Steve, who quickly realizes his mistake. “God you’re being dumb,” Tony mumbles, settling back into Steve’s lap and pulling Bucky back in again.
,” Tony says, voice sounding a little desperate even to his own ears. He hears the way Steve’s breath catches for a moment and the way it picks back up again when he leans back into Tony’s neck, leaving sloppy kisses down it before pulling away. Tony makes an irritated noise and Steve huffs out a laugh.
“Well what the hell, explain yourself! How the hell did you get back to New York? And why are you in
, and Bucky’s hips stutter to a stop as he presses in as far as he can go. His moan is muffled as he bites into Tony’s shoulder and the pain is almost too much and Tony’s back arches into Bucky as he throws his head back.
“Yeah, but not yet,” Steve murmurs, pulling his hand away and Tony pouts at him again. “Don’t get impatient with me now, I’ve got plans,” Steve tells him.
Basically he’s a slut, Tony knows because he’s heard the stories. And he hadn’t exactly been brought around as a significant other so much as an extended tryst so his idiot ass planned for fooling around, Tony realizes. He rolls his eyes, “well maybe you should have considered that
Tentatively, Tony spreads his legs more, smiling when Steve sucks in a breath and leans in a little. He reaches over himself slowly, carefully tracing his hole as Steve watches, eyes glued to his every move. He teases himself a little, back arching a little as he slides a finger in some and then pulls it back out. Fuck its good, watching Steve watch him as he teases himself. Steve licks his lips as he leans forward to spread Tony’s legs wider. “Want you to move a little faster, baby. Want to see you fuck yourself on your fingers,” Steve tells him.
not sleeping with your sleazy best friend. I don’t know if he’s got diseases and I’m not finding out by sticking his dick in me, thanks,” he says.
tries to make an escape but Tony is sitting in his lap so that doesn’t happen. Tony smacks his leg with his free hand. “You stop that. You’re not going anywhere and this is your room anyway,” Tony points out.
. Bucky must not think its permanent though or Tony suspects he would have just gotten rid of the problem- him. Morita has suggested he’s done that at least twice so Tony figures Bucky expects Steve to get over himself except he looks surprised that he’s shared a moment with Steve so now he’s not so sure.
had fevers that ran the same temperatures that omegas deal with though apparently omegas do better with the temperature rise. He’s not entirely sure how true that is.
“I have no communication with him for a week and a half and he gets abandoned in a foreign country by his asshole father, turns to
you feel fucking perfect.” He pulls away for a half a second, looking at Steve over Tony’s head and honestly he thinks that’s kind of rude and he’s not even
fuckin good.” Tony moans into Steve’s neck, marking him again and Steve changes their position, falling forward so Tony’s back on the mattress with his legs spread wide. “Always so fucking eager to take me,” Steve tells him as he leans over him. Steve kisses him roughly, nipping at his bottom lip before nosing his way down Tony’s jaw and kissing down his neck. “God, you smell even more turned on than you feel,” he says, letting out a small moan.
“Archibald incident?” Steve asks, obviously not paying much attention as he tumbles in looking annoyed.
He huffs but alters his position a bit, getting a better angle and fucking into himself again. This time he moans right away and Steve nods, “that’s better. Give me what I wanna see,” he tells him. Tony moans, fucking into himself faster, legs falling back open as he lifts his hips some. Yeah, that’s the way he used to do it. Fuck, he forgot how good this could be. He lets out another moan, biting his lip as his back arches.
He wouldn’t, Tony knows that for sure. “I know you wouldn’t do anything I don’t want,” he tells Steve. “You can experiment, if you want.”
Archibald,” Rhodey says. The look on their faces when it happened was priceless too. Archibald because he was freaked out that Rhodey knew his name when he’d never mentioned it and Rhodey because his attempt at picking out a Standard Rich White Guy Name ended up being a correct guess.
“Take off your pants,” he tells Steve, who wastes no time following his instructions. Tony mostly ignores the noises of Steve struggling out of his jeans as he fingers himself open more, focused on the sensation.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve murmurs. “Now shower.” He rolls his eyes but lets Steve drag him off to the shower and lets him do most of the work washing him too, just because he can and also because he’s tired. When Bucky inevitably shows up to ruin his shower Steve leaves him there to suffer under the spray while he goes and deals with it. He can
“Come on baby, you know you wanna cum. S’okay, want you to,” Tony tells him as Steve shifts his position to sit up, changing the angle that Tony’s sitting at and he moans as Steve reaches around, under the skirt, to jerk him off. His other hand remains on Tony’s hip, guiding his movements and its rough and sloppy but
“Not maybe, this is lifted directly from the page. Points for attention to detail,” he murmurs, fingers trailing up Tony’s thigh on the stockings. Yeah, Tony made sure they matched what Steve drew.
Which is how he finds himself perched in the chair in his makeshift lab and also Steve’s room wearing a button down of Steve’s, a crisp white because he seems to have a thing for sticking Tony in the color for god knows what reason, thigh high stockings, and heels. Steve’s got some interesting taste Tony will give him that but he hadn’t been opposed to trying any of the stuff he drew out so he figured what the hell, might as well test some of this stuff out. He’s chewing on the end of a pen thinking up designs for a couple new projects when he hears Steve come down the hall.
He shivers, tilting his head a little for Steve. “‘Course I do, makes it easier to tease you,” he tells Steve. Bucky too. All he’s got to do is turn this way or that, or give them the right look, or stretch just the right way and suddenly it’s all eyes on him. He’s always liked attention, assuming he wants it in that moment, and he especially likes attention from Steve and Bucky.
Steve’s breath hitches and Tony hears Steve open the condom package. “Jesus fucking Christ,” Steve says, words tumbling together. “You should see yourself like this, skirt ridden up around your hips, fingering yourself open like that. On display- for
He leans down and kisses Steve slowly, not letting Steve take the desperate control he wants to just to tease him more. Steve makes a soft noise into the kiss, trying his best to hurry things along without hands but Tony pulls away a little every time he tries. “
Tony knows what he’s actually asking. If he likes any of this at all, because Steve cares about that kind of thing. He shakes his head, “not exactly,” he tells Steve and he raises an eyebrow.
Bucky snorts and starts laughing. “So you’re a gun snob too. Good to know,” he says, walking over and leaning in for a kiss. Behind him Steve tenses and Tony thinks its about time he gets over whatever the hell his issue is with this.
“You okay?” he asks because Tony’s looking at him with a weirdly concentrated look on his face, like he’s trying to figure out some kind of philosophy question. He’d say a math problem except Tony is more than exceptional at math and he got bored and annoyed of Steve’s philosophy course text in like five minutes. Said philosophy was a useless discipline and he’s not entirely wrong there, in his defense.
Steve looks over to Bucky and shrugs but he knows them well enough that it’s not an agreement to do what Tony wants. “You seem kinda wound tight,” Bucky tells him and uh,
He moans at that, pressing his face into Steve’s neck and earning a sharp moan out of him too. “Scent me,” he tells Tony, tilting his head to the side. Tony noses at his neck a little, kissing up the side of his neck and sucking at the skin there before he rubs his cheek along his neck. “
“Don’t do that,” Steve tells him, “I wanna hear you.” He curls his fingers slightly and Tony’s hips tilt up involuntarily as he moans.
He throws back his head, panting as Bucky sets a punishing pace. Bucky takes advantage by leaning in and kissing his way down Tony’s neck, teeth grazing his neck almost roughly as he moves down the column of Tony’s throat. With his free hand Tony tangles it in Bucky’s hair, fingers keeping a loose grip that still makes Bucky moan.
to omegas in heat exactly but Tony has literally never shown an interest before and Steve’s not about to take advantage.
“Sure you are, but that doesn’t get rid of the paint smell and it’s drowning the you smell out,” Steve tells him, nipping at his jaw.
“Forty percent hearing loss in my left ear. Scarlet fever as a kid, I think. I honestly can’t remember.”
. “Sorry, its just that you looked absurd,” Steve tells him, shrugging a little. Tony flips him off and goes back to rooting around in his bag for a few moments.
“Not especially relevant to my life, so no. I have a bunch of cold and sinus shit though, might help with the fever at least.” It can’t be comfortable, being that hot. Okay, actually he knows its not comfortable given that he
Tony pulls again, a sharp yank that has Bucky stuttering in his pace for a moment as he lets out another loud moan. “Oh, m fuckin close,” Bucky tells him and Tony nods frantically.
“Well, its Tony,” Steve says in way of an explanation. “He’s always good for us.” He takes another step closer, effectively pinning Tony between Bucky’s body and his. “You look nice like this,” he murmurs, running a hand down Tony’s chest until it hits Bucky’s hand, still at his waistline. His breath hitches for a moment and he’s not even sure what he’s meant to anticipate out of the simple contact between the two, especially when they seem more intent to tease him than please him.
Tony carefully balances himself out with his hands on Bucky’s chest and moves, teasing them a little as he lifts off some and sinks back down slowly. He does it again, watching as both Steve and Bucky’s breath hitches. “Faster,” Bucky tells him, tapping his thigh. “Come on, wanna feel what you can do,” Bucky murmurs.
“My apologies Bucky, our god damn half asleep boyfriend didn’t consider that empty apartments, no word of a move, and postit notes with addresses on them look like a fucking kidnapping situation to anyone with a half a brain let alone two people who worked in the CIA,” Steve says. There’s a brief pause and Tony thinks for a moment he might get peace but then Steve sighs. “He’s not going to listen to you,” he says, but sticks the phone to Tony’s ear a moment later.
Across the room Steve has paused what he’s doing, watching with a slightly open mouth and obvious arousal. “Better hurry up,” Tony tells him in a low, almost husky tone. Steve picks up the pace looking around and Tony figures he must find the box he’s looking for because he hears him shuffle things around for a moment. He doesn’t pay attention to where Steve is until he feels the bed sink and he looks over. “Gunna fuck me now?” he asks and Steve looks him over, eyes focused on Tony’s fingers in his ass.
Steve pants heavily into his neck, movements soft and jerky as he cums too and Tony sighs. “Think that vibrator is still on,” he murmurs after a moment. Steve lets out a soft laugh and shakes his head.
He shrugs, “seen it enough times to know. You’d think people would take the hint and leave you alone,” he says, giving Bucky a pointed look. Tony laughs, relaxing some presumably because Steve isn’t putting up with Bucky’s attitude.
Sam looks at him like he’s especially stupid. “Yeah alright, I fold. You’ve got the dumbest white boy,” he says, walking out.
Tony laughs and flips the camera showing Rhodey the familiar skyline. “I’m in Brooklyn and you weren’t misinformed by Pepper.”
He feels the mattress sink as Bucky reappears behind him, hand settling on the small of his back again. “Is so,” Bucky says, “you could have given me a better heads up.”
Tony lets out a soft gasp as Steve slides a finger in and pulling it back out. “Two fingers,” Tony tells him, “wanna feel you.” Steve’s pace falters for a moment at that but he recovers fast, thankfully, and presses two fingers into Tony. He bites his lip and tries his best not to buck his hips as Steve pumps his fingers in and out. Steve pulls off and Tony makes a small noise of disappointment.
“Don’t whine at me, baby, or I’ll just leave you here like this,” he says, reaching down and cupping Steve through his jeans. He leans forward as he runs his hand up Steve’s length, “and I can feel how much you want this too,” he murmurs, blinking innocently.
of it then I’m attached to the toilet by the ass for a week.” If there’s a smell that’s the opposite of Tony’s heat it’s probably that and the smell of liquid gluten shits, Steve swears, has given him genuine PTSD. Which is the upside of a half busted sniffer, not having to worry about stray reminders of shits past.
“Tony, I-” his words cut out as he moans, nosing at Tony’s neck as he tilts his head to the side for Steve. “I’m-” he starts but words fail him again.
. I don’t have patience for whatever bullshit you’re trying to pull so how about you get with the god damn program and communicate like a fucking adult,” Tony tells him, sounding strangely like Rhodey. Is this what its like to deal with himself? God he hopes not because he’s annoying if so.
For a moment he looks annoyed too but he seems to realize something and he best fucking voice it because Tony doesn’t have the patience today. “I… I’ve never actually been with someone I loved before. Cared about sure, but love? Never really felt like it was in the cards for me.”
“Name one thing worse than this,” Tony asks, turning to face Steve. Normally he sort of forgets to think when he’s this close to Steve because who wouldn’t, Steve’s gorgeous. But at the moment he’s more preoccupied with his hatred of all things camping. If he sees a single fucking wasp he’s leaving.
He rolls his eyes, “I’d say I’d rather shoot myself but Hammer weapons are so shit I can’t even rely on them to not jam when I do it. They had wanted me to fix the guns but I can’t fix design flaws when the design
He follows Bucky’s instructions, pulling his hair a little and Bucky lets out a loud moan, fingers on Tony’s wrist tightening for a moment. “
“Fuck, Bucky,” he murmurs. Bucky knows what he’s asking because he reaches down, hand sliding into Tony’s pants til his hand reaches Steve’s and he moans into Tony’s mouth.
Tony snorts, “I didn’t work any magic, I just happen to be good company.” Which Bucky would know, if he made a move.
“Rumlow’s pants,” Steve points out and yeah okay, he’s got a point there. Steve smiles, knowing he’s got Tony there. He leans in and kisses Tony softly, “want to make the playlist?” he asks and hell
“Do you have something to add, sweetums?” Tony asks and Rhodey wrinkles his nose. Which, rude, Tony calls him all kinds of things that are worse than that. Steve and Bucky made him promise never to call them platypus but that wasn’t a hard sell considering only Rhodey gets to be his platypus.
The best he finds is a bunch of cleaning supplies, some Christmas decorations, and that pile of crap guns he’s supposed to fix. He picks up a Christmas decoration and frowns at the ball, wondering what the hell his life has become. What the hell is he supposed to do with cleaning supplies, useless weapons, and
“I like to feel fancy,” Tony says, nose in the air. Steve shakes his head and leans into his neck, nipping at the space under his jaw.
Bucky kisses down the side of his neck, fingers dipping below his belt line a little. “Dangerous answer, baby. You really want to go with that?” he murmurs.
It takes a long while for Steve to move, walking over slowly, taking Tony in as he goes. He stays in position, letting Steve get a good look at his fantasies come to life. As soon as he can reach Tony he trails his fingers down his leg, hand curling around the inside of his thigh as his thumb brushes against the top of the stockings. He doesn’t take his eyes off Tony’s face as he does it and for whatever reason that’s attractive to him. “You looked through my notebook,” Steve states, not asks.
done and it’d be funny if not for Steve’s confusion. But when Tony gets out of bed and walks over to his, grabbing his notebook and tossing it aside in favor of replacing it in Steve’s lap with himself so he can’t say he’s complaining. Tony leans forward and Steve has no fucking clue what to do here because this is unexpected and it shouldn’t be, he guesses, on account of Tony knowing nothing of subtly and he runs on being far too bold and blunt for his own good. So this seems like a normal thing he’d do but Steve still didn’t expect it.
Something must occur to him though because he quickly drags his head back out and gives Steve a panicked look. “Wait, this isn’t like-”
Sam shoves Rhodey aside and sticks his face in the screen. “Double digits?” he asks and Rhodey shoves him back out.
to his tastes so isn’t enough to make hanging out with annoying drunk high schoolers fun but that doesn’t mean Tony doesn’t have his own plans. Rhodey frowns on screen, tilting his head like he’s going to get a better view that way when Tony would have to change the way his phone is held to get that result. “What are you wearing?” he asks.
“Why the fuck do you care?” Steve asks and he needs to get past this damn thing, it shouldn’t even be scientifically
Tony huffs, “well come on,” he says, prodding Steve until he listens. He takes his sweet ass time and has the
, which would worry him if Tony didn’t stumble out the front door looking a little worse for wear but obviously fine. He spots them fast and rolls his eyes as he shuffles his way over. “God, took you fucking long enough,” he mumbles as he pitches forward into Steve’s arms. He turns, and for the first time in months, exchanges a look with Bucky and they both know exactly what he’s asking.
being in the center of it assuming that’s what he wants in that moment, and during sex he likes to know he’s doing his job well. And Steve? Tony got him out of that absurdly prudish habit he had of being way too quite during sex.
lingering around but for now Steve isn’t really concerned about it. “It’s been awhile,” he says as Steve settles his hands back above his head. Its sweet that Tony didn’t even have to tell him what to do.
“Fuck, do that again,” Tony tells him, ignoring the slightly desperate edge to his voice. Steve’s teeth catch the skin of his neck again bit this time he bites, lightly, as he moves the dildo. “Fuck
is what he wanted. Or some approximation of it anyway. And fuck, its nice too, Bucky’s urgent kisses paired with Steve reaching around his waist to undo his pants. Tony moans as Steve’s hands dip into his pants, feeling him. He moans, pressing himself into Steve’s hand for more friction but he’s a bastard and he pulls away
. The fact that he’s an omega helps, not that Steve’s entirely picky, but he does have a preference for them. “What?” Tony asks, grinning when he notices Steve looking.
“No, no. Don’t hide from me,” he murmurs. “S’okay. This… this is fuckin amazing Tony, so fuckin good. Been dreaming about you dressed like this basically since I met you,” he tells him. He bites his lip again and Steve lets out a soft huff. “Stop that. I wanna see you moan. Be good for me,” he says and Tony sucks in a breath, barely resisting the urge to bite his lip again. “Like that,” Steve murmurs as his hands slide back down to Tony’s thighs. “What made you recreate this, hmm? Just me?” he asks.
He’s sure Bucky’s got a whole list of stupid reasons why this could be a bad idea. “Yeah, something tells me Steve wouldn’t be happy about this,” he murmurs and Tony snorts.
“I actually like him so I think I’m going to stick around for a bit until I get bored or married, we’ll see what happens first,” he says.
, okay, Tony can do that. He complies, rolling onto his back in what has to be record time before Bucky is on him again, grabbing a wrist and pinning it above his head with a harsh grip. It hurts but Tony finds he likes it, moaning as Bucky presses back into him fast and hard. His other hand falls to Tony’s hip, gripping it almost as tight as his wrist as he fucks into Tony almost harshly.
“Yeah, but they don’t show you from my perspective. On the bed,” Steve instructs. Tony rolls his eyes fondly but listens, crawling onto the bed and laying across it. It’s a fuck of a lot better than whatever Steve decided was sleep material worthy before this. That had felt like lying on a damn
“Am not, its true,” Steve murmurs, pulling Tony into his lap. Tony rearranges himself; shifting so one leg is on either side of Steve’s hips and curling his arms around his neck.
“Always eager,” Steve mumbles like that’s not his favorite thing about Tony. He obliges though, pressing the toy in faster and Tony gasps. “You like that?” Steve asks and Tony nods. “Guess you’ll really like this,” he says and Tony feels the vibrations almost before he feels them. He lets out a loud gasp and his back arches as his fingers tangle harshly in the sheets and he lets out a soft ‘oh.’
He knows he’s probably going to have a whole collection of hickies by the time Bucky’s done with his neck but he can’t be bothered to give a shit. He tilts his head so Bucky has better access and he nips at the underside of Tony’s jaw, teeth grazing the skin there before he kisses it, moving slowly down his neck. Tony lets out a soft whine, fingers twining tighter in Bucky’s shirt as Steve hits just the right spot again.
“Yeah, this isn’t normal even for middle class people. Pretty sure every apartment I’ve ever lived in can fit into this room,” he says. Tony twists to look around, trying to gauge square footage.
He’s been told his eighties meets hippie dipped in black is a weird look but he likes the flow-y skirts and Steve’s vegan ass can eat it, leather is great. “Unlike some people I prefer style,” he says, giving the ill-fitting jeans and T-shirt the guy is wearing a disdainful look.
He’s surprised when Steve deposits him at Bucky’s door, “stay here,” he tells Tony as he looks down at him. He resents that he’s
“I’m not really known for my patience,” he tells Bucky. Which Steve already knows, and frankly so does everyone else who knows anything about him.
Clearly Bucky forgot about that because he’s got the memory of a sieve but thankfully he’s got Steve around to remind him of important things like this. “No, its weird,” Bucky says and Steve pinches the bridge of his nose.
“Oof, turned down before you even ask. Well, you attempted to shoot your shot,” Steve tells Bucky, patting his arm in sympathy.
“Come here,” Bucky says and Tony walks over, letting out a surprised noise when Bucky pulls him in close, spinning him around and pinning his hands over his head. Steve gives him an appreciative once over and how do they do that? Just make a bunch of plans without doing more than looking at each other? It makes no sense, like witchcraft.
good as soon as Steve starts moving his fingers the way Tony wants him to. “Like that,” Tony tells them, “yeah, little faster-
Bucky looks him over again as he crawls onto the bed, crowding Tony into the mattress as he grabs Tony’s wrist and pins it above his head. “I see plenty I like,” he murmurs. Tony lets out a soft puff of breath; leg skating up Bucky’s side and over his hip. “What, got a thing for that?” he asks, grip around Tony’s wrist getting tighter and
“Actually I think the STI infected dick of America might be a guy named Brock Rumlow,” Tony says, nose wrinkled again.
He considers changing his answer but no one would ever accuse him of being smart outside of engineering so he doesn’t. Instead he reaches out and curls his fingers in Bucky’s hair, pulling at it a little. “Mm, pretty sure I’ll like whatever it is you do,” he says, grinning when Bucky moans into his neck.
, Tony,” he says, rolling his hips into Tony’s ass. He lifts his ass a little and grinds back into Bucky, pulling at his hair as he does so. Bucky moans again, hand flying to Tony’s hip and gripping it tight, “
Steve sighs, “you’re fucking useless when you’re tired,” he mumbles and that’s fucking rude okay. He just wants to sleep, that’s not a crime. Instead of coming back to bed though he leans over Tony like a jackass and digs around for his pants, finding nothing because he climbs over Tony to get out of bed. He groans, making his displeasure known as Steve plods off to deal with Bucky, who is probably fine on account of not being a child. He can find his own damn way home.
“Always so damn pushy,” Steve murmurs. “Can’t just let me appreciate you like this, spread out for me. Always gotta hurry me along.”
that is a lot hotter than Tony expected it to be. “Fuck Steve, keep doing that,” Tony tells him as Steve shifts his hips up to match the pace he’s set. Steve’s grip tightens as his breathing and thrusts become a little more erratic.
to laugh when Tony makes an irritated noise and decides to help him out by pulling his damn pants off himself. “That was
Its soft and slow and Tony licks his lips as Bucky lets Steve tilt his head to the side, one hand tangling into his hair. He might be embarrassed by the noise he just made but he’s more focused on Bucky and Steve. Bucky lets out a soft, surprised moan and Tony’s breath hitches as Steve bites Bucky’s lip gently as he pulls away again. He looks over to the computer and Tony senses it before Steve does it. “No, no, no, no!” he yells as Steve ends the call. He lets out a loud shriek and flings himself off the bed, grabbing his coat because fuck business meetings, he’s going home to properly sort this.
“Fuck, Tony you’ve got me,” Steve tells him. “Had me since I walked in on you bent over your desk trying to find a plug.”
“One, you’re a bad liar. Two, should I tell Steve you don’t actually hate each other because he’s worried,” he says.
to get what I wanted out of it, then I restarted it on account of not liking what I had, and now I've got this. So if the sex bit isn't good I am sorry but I had to wrestle this little fucker out.
“I’m tempted but uh-” he cuts himself off, clenching his jaw like he can’t even bring himself to turn Tony down.
“Tony,” Steve all but moans out and Tony’s pretty sure he doesn’t even know what he’s asking for, not really, and that makes this all the better. He carefully presses another finger in, shifting to get a better angle and moaning as he presses in a little deeper.
Rhodey looks confused and he shouldn’t because Tony is making perfect sense here, he’s just being dumb. “Tones, one second you don’t want to be hit on, now you’re whining that you aren’t being hit on? What do you want, man?”
“I think I want to know if you get louder,” Bucky says and yeah, he hasn’t really seen much of anything yet.
high and he cried while eating a McDonald’s big mac. Don’t know why that’s a big deal to him but he’s real embarrassed about it. Also, one time he got his dick pierced and-”
“- so yeah, I ended up on the subway with a fucking pigeon in my lap because the stupid thing refused to go away,” Bucky says. Steve looks confused and honestly Tony too because, brave as the pigeons in New York are, they aren’t usually
Steve flips him off and leaves in a huff and Bucky rolls his eyes. He figures Steve will get over it.
I’m arguing semantics. Second of all, that was a totally smart decision on account of I wasn’t footing the hotel bill. Genius,” Tony says, nose in the air.
“No, I’m dying if dysentery,” he says as he flees the scene, waving an arm around behind him in a sad attempt at a goodbye.
Bucky pulls him into a kiss, moaning into his mouth as the back of his legs hit the bed. Tony pushes him gently, dropping Steve’s hand to do it, and Bucky sits down, nuzzling Tony’s stomach as he does. Tony runs his fingers through Bucky’s long hair as Steve comes up behind him, hands settling on his waist. “How is it that I always end up naked first? And this time I had lots of clothes on so that’s no excuse. Get naked,” Tony tells them, reaching down to lift Bucky’s shirt over his head. He can hear Steve toss his behind him and he pushed Bucky onto his back. “Pants. Off,” Tony instructs.
For a moment Tony doesn’t respond but then he squints a little. “Are… you even affected my me?” he asks and Steve frowns.
With a dramatic sigh impressive even for a teenager, she grabbed the bottom of her shirt with both hands, slowly lifting it until she rested the shirt below her breast-line. There was definitely significant bruising around her ribs.
“Come on cub, I went to one when I was little, I promise it will be fun!” her Tati tried convincing her for the third time. It didn’t matter how great seeing real animals sounded, she did not want to go to the zoo with Tati and...Vivienne. “Plus Vivienne pointed out how important it is for you to interact with animals, not just the stuffed ones,” he joked, nodding towards Wolf who was tucked into her arms. They were sitting on her bed in her room while Vivienne waited in the kitchen.
“Dad told me he was supposed to be a Rogers, but then your birth dad died and Nana couldn’t afford it on her own. His bio dad was a nightmare, right?” she asked in confirmation.
“I overheard Robert on the phone with a man from the Philippines. He owed a debt and was going to send that innocent sweet baby angel away like a fucking worthless
Steve dated girls. They didn’t last long…but he was a teenager. And he was too busy to date anyone for very long, anyway. Doesn’t mean he’s gay.
“There’s no reason to explain Capsicle. I get it. I mean I’m always screwing up, and a pain, a totally selfish asshole especially to those I care about, incapable of considering other’s feelings.” He paused for breath. “I’m just a deeply damaged person. Not even a superhero can put up with that for long.” Tony couldn’t look up to meet Steve’s face, but raised his vision to stare distantly at Steve’s chest. He can do this. Just a little bit longer and he could crawl back to the bottle.
“Do you have any other reasons for why we should break up?” Steve asked slightly concerned about what Tony will answer.
They got back to their shared apartment, where Tony unlocked the door and entered with the Brooklyn twins trailing behind him. Tony was just about to turn around and apologize when he noticed that Steve and Bucky were making a grab for him. He knew they would never hurt him, but past habits die hard, and he flinched, jerking his whole upper body back.
,” he tells them. “Or go further, all the way, I’m not above watching,” he adds. “Actually I’d prefer it. Or joining, I’m not picky.”
I’m okay, so okay. Move baby, wanna feel you,” Tony tells him. Steve nods, shifting his position so he’s got one arm above Tony’s head balancing himself as he looks down at Tony. Then he starts to move, slowly at first and Tony gasps softly, biting his lip to hold back his reaction some.
“You stop that,” Steve tells him. “Or I won’t fuck you later.” Tony pouts but Steve allows it, laughing a little before turning his attention back to the way his fingers are moving inside him. “You look good like this baby, all wet like you are.”
, like you were suffering,” Bucky mumbles. “Come on, let’s go,” he tells Tony, picking up his hand and pulling him off. Tony reaches out for Steve, snagging his hand as Bucky drags them both off to the bedroom.
“Mm, no you’re not,” Steve agrees as he kisses down Tony’s neck. “You dressed up because you like the attention I give you but you don’t let me touch you just to tease me. You like pushing me to the edge, making me beg for it,” Steve murmurs.
“They didn’t. I escaped Area 51, the government is looking for me,” he says, deadpan and Tony starts laughing.
Steve’s at his wits end but he’s not the only one with feelings. So Steve didn’t expect a real relationship to come of this, neither did Bucky. But Tony is… well, he’s so
, he forgot how good this can be and with Steve behind him making all these small little noises of arousal- yeah, that’s the good stuff. “Put that condom on,” Tony tells him, “because I don’t have much more patience.”
By the time Steve comes back Bucky has stopped worrying about his reaction and started to worry that Tony’s bed hog habits are a permanent thing. He’s taking up the entire bed minus the corner Bucky has staked out for himself and the guy is fucking tiny, even
to do here and its due tomorrow so he should like… deal with that. Tony, he figures, will find some kind of solution to his problems because he’s weirdly good at that. “You don’t like… happen to have suppressants lying around do you?” he asks and Steve snorts.
good right now. Tony reaches out, running his hands down Steve’s chest, almost feeling compelled to do so. Steve’s got an odd look on his face as he watches Tony’s actions, watching carefully until Tony hits his belt line and he decides to make quick work of that too.
any fucking coffee in this hellscape. Or maybe Sam has reason to keep quiet, he doesn’t know, but it’s Sam who breaks the silence.
Natasha’s soft hands found his on the table. “Steve you didn’t do any of that. You know the saying ‘people don’t change?’ that’s a load of bull. People say that because changing for the better is hard and they use it as an excuse. Tony wasn’t changing himself because he thought he needed to... to keep you. He wanted to be a better person because he loves you, and he felt like you were worth the effect to improve himself. You both inspire each other with your strengths. You drive him to want to be better for himself as well. Give him the strength to become the kind of person he wants to be. And that was true long before the two of you were lovers”
“Hey Tony,” Bruce continued to smile at him as he sat the mug down. There wasn’t pity in his voice or eyes only support and Tony melted a little more inside. He always had an extra soft spot for Bruce, who he thinks had been alone even longer than him, which is too bad because unlike him, all Bruce has ever wanted is to help people. He knew Bruce had a soft spot for him as well because he was Bruce’s first friend after the Hulk. That thought sort of made him sad, because Bruce deserved the best and the fact that Bruce has a soft spot for Tony only because Tony had no sense of self preservation when he’d first met Bruce made him feel unworthy of all the care Bruce gave him.
“Ah, that explains it. I’ll have to make them something in thanks.” Tony ponders. “I’m sorry I never realized that you were feeling pressured or in adequate.”
He tried to push the thought of an injured Tony from his head too. He didn’t need that add on right now. When he started to explain though, the words got stuck in his throat, but Steve pushed pass because it needed to be said. “Tony broke up with me.” His voice sounded small and squeaky even to himself.
I was making him miserable and putting everyone’s safety at risk and he just couldn’t take it anymore. It’s okay. It’s for the best, really.” Tony didn’t even try to smile with the reassurance. He couldn’t even pull up a fake one right now.
“If that’s the only reason you’re here Rogers then feel free to get out of my workshop now.” Now that he wasn’t ‘in danger of dying’, he just wanted Steve to leave. To realize that Tony wasn’t dying, and he no longer needed to remain here. Tony all but pushed himself from Steve’s arms and stood up. The fact that he hadn’t fallen or hurt himself again was a surprising bonus.
It was okay though or at least that’s what he kept repeating to himself. Today was the last day. He was so close to winning which surprised even himself but he’d also never had worse blue balls in his life. He felt like he might explode. That’s why he was going through all this beer at 2pm in the afternoon. He’s hoping to make the time go by faster or maybe drink til he passed out. A mantra of
Steve looked at his friends surrounding him and felt impossibly good especially considering he and Tony were still in a state of being broken up. But they made him optimistic about the future. “I’m going to go talk to Tony. Clear everything up. I think he’s wallowed alone long enough, and yes I’ll remember what we talked about.” Steve shot the others a hopefully reassuring smile and received in turn 3 hopeful smiles in turn. With that discussion finished, Steve hopped to his feet and basically sprinted down the stairs.
Steve jumped in with his own righteous anger, “That’s a highly intrusive and not an appropriate questi-“
Bucky didn’t have to be told twice. “Tony I’ve never seen anythin’ so sexy in my life. You’re just lettin’ Steve use your mouth like you’re not even a person but just some sort of toy he can just take his pleasure from. Then tomorrow when ya talk ya gonna sound like a chain smoker and everyone will know it’s because Steve had spent the entire night beatin’ your tonsils with his dick. What do you think about that Doll? Having everyone you talk to know how much of a whore you are.” Bucky’s voice was husky as he looked directly into Tony’s eyes as he talked.
This left Tony sitting by himself, hand still out to hand his cellphone to Bruce, in a now empty lab. The franticness he was feeling was fading, leaving behind ice as its replacement. Oh, of course Bruce would leave once he understood the true. That Tony was the one at fault and Steve hadn’t done anything wrong. That Tony had been a liability, putting them all at risk. Of course, Bruce wouldn’t feel like Tony deserved comfort once it became obvious that Tony had brought this all on himself. It’s what he deserves.
He’s heart sank when he realized the messages were from before their fight but then he read the messages and froze.
Then they’d both started to thrust and Bucky was amazed their ability to sync up with each other’s movements was transferable from the field to the bedroom.
That’s not to say that Tony didn’t love Steve. He loved him so much more then he can express, and he has for a long time. He knew that he would always love Steve because of who he is and all the things they’ve experience and done together no matter the future. But he too wasn’t willing to compromise certain values for love. After all that’s how the whole civil war thing happened, and he knew that if a similar situation were to occur he still would have to stand behind what he believed in as he’s sure Steve would do the same. Because your values are a part of who you are, and you can’t give up a part of who you are for love. Love wouldn’t be meaningful if it meant losing yourself, and love doesn’t mean you’ll end up with who you love.
Despite his best effort, he’s insecurities echoed in the insuring silence, so Steve blurted out “Is it me? Did I do something wrong? Was I too pushy? Or is it because I exhaust you? Do I make you unhappy? Is there someone else? Do you not love me anymore?” and there is was. Everything he feared, said and out in the open now. Tony’s eyes grew wide as Steve spoke and every second without a reply was agony. He’s looking at Tony and he’s sure that he’s expression is begging Tony to deny it, to assure him. Except that wasn’t really fair, was it? He doesn’t want to guilt Tony into answering what he wanted to hear. Suddenly Steve snapped his gaze away, looking at the ground, fists clench as he suddenly found himself losing his battle against his tears. His shoulders shook but he tried his best to not make noise.
“I.. I’m …. not sure” Steve floundered because to be honest, he’s not 100% sure what happened. All he knew was he wants to, no needs to talk to Tony. He needs to sort this out with him.
As the 3 of them sat down he noticed an empty chair. (Actually 2 empty chairs but he didn’t want to think about that right now).
He’d spend so long crying over losing the best thing he’d ever had, while simultaneously being so resigned to the situation. When Steve first convinced him to go out with him, Steve had promised that they had years of history and he knew Tony inside and out, that he was in love with everything that Tony was, that he was certain he would never willingly let Tony go. Steve had used his superhuman emotional strength, which Steve definitely had before becoming Captain America, to push back every insecurity that Tony had. Upon seeing that he probably wouldn’t be able to convince Tony to have more self worth overnight, he convinced Tony to stay by stated that people didn’t deserve each other. The universe didn’t work that way. What mattered was that he wanted Tony and Tony wanted him back.
“Steve, geez! Breath! I was only teasing you. We know you’re not perfect, but you have to know that no one is perfect in relationships. You gave it your best shot, we know you did.”
“Dammit Bucky! I’m trying to help both of you out here.”  Then Steve’s other hand came up to fist Bucky’s cock, covering it with lube before letting go.
Steve’s first instinct was to go embrace the man, but two feet from Tony he halted in his tracks, arms still raised when he remembered their current situation. Again, Steve felt a surge of resentment towards himself. Look at how much suffering he’d caused Tony and now he was frozen here having no idea how to fix it all over again. What happened to all his determination and bravery from moments prior. He tried to remember the team’s words as he pushed back thoughts about how he wasn’t good for Tony.
“Hey Steve, JARVIS said you were here. I thought you would have went to the medical with Tony. We’ll just grab a change of cloth and we can leave k? I’m disgusting from chasing the Hulk”. Steve hadn’t turned around but he’s pretty sure the Doctor was flushing apologetically at Clint’s comment.
He’s hands flew to the doorknob which expectantly was locked. Even through the doors, Steve could tell Tony was trying to suppress the sound, but it wasn’t working.
Steve started to shuffle off to their room. Before he realized that it wasn’t their room anymore. All of a sudden, he was frozen in the hallway and didn’t know what to do. Which direction to go. Grief struck him all over again at the realization. Should he move his stuff out? After all it was Tony’s room to begin with. Would Tony even want it anymore? It seems Tony had removed a lot of his things from their room already. Had he driven Tony out of his own room?
“Steve you are so much more than Captain America. You’re not perfect but you’re perfect for me. Steve, I know you have flaws, but I don’t love you despite those flaws. Those quirks about you make it so that you fit perfectly with me and my imperfections. You take such good care of me and I don’t just mean with the food and the regular sleep schedule. You’re a rock of support and you inspire the best in not just me but everyone. Not by being Captain America but because at your core, you are a good man who doesn’t just believe in fairness and justice but fights for it. You’re loyal and protective. And you might not be a genius by definition, but you challenge me every day with your opinions, suggestions, ideas, and debates. You’re my best friend. You make me laugh. You make me Happy. So, Steve rest assure that there’s no one else I’d rather be with. I love you.”
Clint looked about ready to punch him, but he just felt hollow. Natasha had enough senses to stepped in.
“I’m pretty sure I get a vote here and I vote yes on that Idea” Steve’s voice made Bucky realize that Steve’s moved to be at Tony’s mouth again and that he was completely hard once more. He raised Tony’s head up with a hand full of hair and forced his cock back into Tony’s mouth without preamble. Then he started to plunge Tony’s mouth every bit as aggressively as he’d just done. Closing his eyes again to concentrate on the sensation as he moaned. “Ah Fuck Tony you’re mouth is amazing. That’s it take it. Take it you little whore. You can take every I give you can’t you? You tramp…….uhn ..yes.... You going to cum now that both your holes are plugged up like you wanted?” Steve tipped his head to get a look at Tony’s engorged cock between his legs. “You going to cum untouched? You are, aren’t you? Just like the slut you are?”
No one said anything on the way back to the tower, which Tony guessed meant that they didn’t think this was the time. ‘Probably waiting until we get home to chew me out,’ He thought with anxiety.
“Then what happened to you Steve? You usually only look this wrecked when Tony is seriously injured or something”
And Steve almost exploded. “No, I’m Steve Rogers, and I could have been better. Should have been better for him!”
“Steve, that’s exactly what we’re talking about. You feel those things, which makes them valid. Which mean that it’s just as important to address your insecurities. You’re not less important Steve. You’ll never be.”
“Good,” Bruce approved. “Then I have some advise for you.” Steve stares at him intently, nodding for him to continue. “As hard as it is to hear, this didn’t just shake Tony’s perception of self. This has broken the trust that he had in you and the relationship.” Bruce saw Steve open his mouth but cut him off. “I’m saying it as it is and I’m telling you Not to take it to heart if he hesitates to trust you so soon. You’re the kind of person that gets deeply hurt when you don’t get trust, but you need to be patient. My concern is Tony makes people bad at patience, you included, but getting into another yelling match is going to make it worse. Worse then it would have been before. You need to get a hold of your emotions. I know Tony brings out strong feelings. If it helps, keep in mind that it’s not that he doesn’t trust you. He doesn’t trust himself. He doesn’t trust that he’s enough to keep you or any promises you make to him.
“Bruce remember Steve’s words? He thinks that Tony was the one to break up with him.” She shifts her attention to Steve. “Steve how did this happen?” All eyes turned to him.
Natasha laid a comforting hand on his knee. “It’s okay Steve. Like I said, we aren’t here to judge. We just want to fix it. It’s not like you knew what he was thinking and the full extent of what was going on either. Mistakes happen, and yes this one is a particularly bad mistake.” Steve groans again. “but what’s important now is to move past it and clear up the misunderstanding.”
Now that his anger has subsided, he felt sort of terrible. Not about yelling at the reporters because really, they’d deserved it, but retrospectively he should have thought about how he’s speech came off to his misfit pair of lovers from the 1920s. He hadn’t meant to undermine what they must have gone through back then. They probably think he’s a total ass for minimizing the social progresses of society that to them must seem like a miracle.
Tony always tried to play it cool, never wanted to seem too attached. Steve knew it was a play. A play that even now a year later Tony still wasn’t willing to drop. Steve knew Tony cared. Tony cared and loved so much. But sometimes he wonders if the reason Tony hasn’t dropped his act, the reason he still fights like he’s expandable is because he still doesn’t understand how much he’s cared about and loved not just by him but the whole team and others as well, because he still doesn’t understand that he’s done so much good and touched so many lives. Steve is hurt by the fact that Tony hates himself so much when all he can feel when he looks at Tony is his heart swelling with love.
“I’m going to keep fucking ya because you feel so good and there’s nothing in the world I’d rather do than fuck ya. Havin’ ya around my dick is my purpose in life. If it were possible I’d fuck your hole and your mouth as the same time but I guess havin’ Steve doing it is the next best thing” Steve would have rolled his eyes at that comment is he wasn’t so close to coming.
Tony gasps, arms tightening around Steve. “Fuck baby I can feel your knot. Come on, want it so bad Steve
“Fucking right I did, have pretty much since I met you but that’s not the issue at hand here. In the shower,” Steve tells him, prodding at him again.
Tony’s half asleep in Steve’s arms when Steve sits straight up, dislodging Tony from his position of comfort. “Get back here,” he mumbles, reaching out for Steve.
He’s polite and gives Bucky his second before he shifts, lifting himself a little to see what’s going on. He doesn’t anticipate Bucky reaching out and gripping the back of his neck again, forcing him back down again and he moans loudly, a surprising flush of pleasure rolling over his body. “Oh you like that, hmm?” Bucky asks as Tony pants, fingers tangled in the sheets again.
“Want you to move faster,” he tells Steve, urging him along. Steve complies, picking up the pace as he moves to kiss Tony, moaning as he does. “Yeah baby, that’s it,” Tony tells him. “Feels good,” he murmurs.
That’s kind of complicated but Tony decides to do his best. “I like seeing you like this,” he says and Steve’s eyebrows draw in a little. “Shh. I like getting you worked up, teasing you. Like it when you lose control a little, take what you want,” he tells Steve, leaning into his space and kissing him. “Like it when you use me for your pleasure. Thought this might get you there faster,” he murmurs against Steve’s lips.
clear here? Apparently not so how about I point out some things I think are obvious. First of all if I wanted to leave you for Bucky I would have done so with gusto, a complete lack of tact, and a lot of drama. But I don’t because, contrary to popular belief, you can care about more than one romantic partner at one time the same way you can care about multiple friends, family members, pets, and sex positions. And you care about them each in special ways that don’t take away from each other. Once again, my love is not a finite resource that will run out one day when I love the color red too hard and stop loving Bucky suddenly, that’s now how things work. So I’m not leaving you for Bucky, I care about you in a special way specific to you, and I love Bucky in a special way specific to him and if you’re worried about me leaving you for anyone it
but he allows it, watching Steve shimmy down the bed a little until he’s somewhat distantly between Tony’s legs. He gives Tony an appreciative once over before he grins and trails his fingers down the inside of Tony’s thighs lightly. Tony shivers a little, biting his lip. “What is it with you and doing that?” Steve says. “Stop your damn lip biting and moan like you want to.”
Turns out its neither of those options and he ends up being strangled harder which like, not particularly cool but its not like Tony’s hands are currently available to fight himself free not that he thinks he’d do a good job of it. He’s always been better with defense than offense. Not that he can do much of
Not like he hasn’t thought long and hard about that one, he’s got no choice and with his health problems he’s not about to get any bigger. Though he’s not as bad as he was when he was a kid. Back then he was such a waif it’s a surprise he didn’t get carried off in a strong gust of wind.
Tony gets home and all but throws the door open, clearly surprising Steve and Bucky with it. They happen to be in the kitchen watching something on Steve’s phone when they jump at Tony’s noisy entrance. “You two are fucking
Tony shakes his head, running his fingers through Bucky’s hair. “Honey, the kinkiest thing you’re into is handcuffs and that’s so tame its not even a kink,” Tony points out.
“Not being turned down enough didn’t seem to leave you big headed,” Tony says like this is a real opinion he has.
no,” Tony says, reminding himself of Rhodey again and he’d be proud. Usually Tony is the stupid one but- oh, maybe
if someone told him about this this morning he’d one hundred percent say he’d say yes but now that this is happening he’s pretty sure Tony has a melted brain. Not that that’s what
they both know that’s not an accurate description of their relationship. It’s just the closest they’ve got as far as language goes.
“Well, I mean Steve happens to be a Howling Commando but other than that I’ve mostly told you everything,” he says.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed but you two decided that it was a good idea to go out of your way to
to know that Tony wants him too given the sheer amount of time he spends trying to goad him into doing something. And at the moment Bucky looks damn tempted but he looks away for a moment, considering walking away Tony assumes.
“Less teasing, more sex,” Tony tells him. Steve laughs a little, but obliges, taking Tony back into his mouth. Tony moans as Steve sets a pace, mercifully faster than his starting point. “Yeah, that’s it,” Tony tells him, “fuck that’s good.”
Tony frowns, apparently struggling to come up with body parts. “Ears?” he asks, probably thinking he’s got Steve there but he shakes his head.
Tony’s pretty sure he wouldn’t either, not with Steve looking at him like that and not when this always feels great. “Mm, me either. Forgot how good you feel,” Tony tells him.
Steve shakes his head, “only you,” he murmurs. “Get up. This room smells like paint and the half finished wall is irritating me,” he says.
short and he doesn’t know what the hell Bucky and Steve are silently deciding but he knows he’s going to like it.
“What, did you live in closets your whole life?” he asks. The room so isn’t that big. Actually the whole condo is small by his standards but given the look on Steve’s face when he walked in he’s going to assume his opinion is a little off.
and this is soft and pleasant the way a mattress should be. Steve climbs onto the mattress after him and frowns. “Is this new?”
“Nope,” he says. Steve makes a displeased noise and Tony thinks its funny that he’s frustrated with his own fantasy. He presses a finger all the way in and moans a little. Behind him, Steve shifts listlessly as Tony starts to move his finger in and out of himself.
Tony nods, “love the feeling of a knot in my ass,” Tony says, “can’t wait to feel you fill me up.” His fingers tighten in Steve’s hair a little and he curls his legs around him, urging him on.
Bucky swears, letting out a low groan. “Fuck I can’t believe you got him to do that,” he murmurs and Steve laughs.
Tony grins, “you’re gunna be fucked anyway. Lie back,” Tony tells him. He goes to turn around but Steve speaks up before he gets far.
There’s a layer of suspicion in his voice, but its not out shadowed by his admiration. Tony sighs, “my father is Howard Stark, if that tells you anything,” he mumbles, clenching his jaw. He’s not surprised when its Steve who reacts first, jolting a little and jostling Tony as he does it.
“Oh did not. Always gotta stick your nose into everything,” Bucky mumbles at him. Tony decides he’s had enough of that and grinds down on Bucky, resulting in him losing his concentration as his fingers tighten on Tony’s hips. “
want this,” he murmurs as he runs a finger over Tony’s hole and yeah he fucking does. “God,” Steve says softly, “
There’s a list, and also a list of things he wants to try but he leaves that particular list alone for the moment. “Like it when you two work together, always feels like you’re telling each other something I’m out of the loop on but when I-
Then thanks to some stupid suggestions from Clint, it had resulted in a bet. Natasha had bet Bucky that he couldn’t go without sexual activities for 30 days! Which mean no sex but also no masturbating or even
“I would have, yes.” Tony’s reply was immediate and without hesitation. Then he stiffened, losing some color in his face. Steve moved forward to embrace him and support him if needed but Tony backed away out of his reach. “I get what you’re saying Steve.” Tony’s tone was wooden, his face and posture more closed off than it’d ever been before. All Steve could do was watch. What was happening? Why? “You’re saying that I’m not going to change. I wish I could tell you that I’ll change, but you’re right, I can’t. I’m already too set in my ways. So even if we weren’t dating, I’d be compromising the team.”
“Also, I bet knowing you have insecurities too would help Tony with his own self worth. Assure him that he’s not weak for not always believing in himself. Think of it as a bonding exercise. If you trust Tony with your secrets. Maybe he’ll be more inclined to disclose his own to you.” Natasha added.
As soon as he made it to the work shop he dumped all of the stuff in his arms in the corner while locking the lab down. Knowing that his current calm was temporary until everything totally sank in completely. He reached for his pain meds. All that walking with the heavy load he was carrying was causing his leg to hurt. Plus, he was due for another dose.
Three pair of eyes continued to stare before Clint responded, “Steve, you do know that LOL means ‘laugh out loud’, right? This basically looks like you dumped Tony and then laughed in his face”
Tony continued but started staring at the floor. “I really hadn’t meant to trivialize what you two must have gone through. I know that it was so much harder in the 1920s to be gay. Something you can get prosecuted or murdered for. I’m sorry that I don’t have that experience to relate with you guys. I know it’s a lot better than it was back then…” He took a peek upward and realized that they were crowding into his personal space. Then each of them gently cupping one of his cheeks.
“I just….. I don’t want to go through something like that again. I felt so helpless, so raw. I just wanted to cry through the whole ordeal. I need you to understand how I was feeling. I need you to not….. I need you to understand” and that hadn’t come out as clear as he’s meant it too. But he looked straight into Tony’s eyes, and tried to convey all he’s feeling, hoped that he could convey even a fraction of his love.
Upper body forced down by Steve’s weight Tony could only whimper and sudden Bucky couldn’t take it anymore.
“I.. Don’t be vindictive Tony. I was simply stating what I felt at the time. Beside I said it for both of our sakes!” In the back of his mind, a more rational part of him, the part that loved Tony more than anything shouted out at him. Begged him to stop, to not make it worse, wanted to slap himself for hurting Tony, and wanted to run to Tony and scope Tony up in his arms to comfort him. Because no, it wasn’t supposed to happen this way. He was supposed to apologize. Tony was supposed to forgive him. Then he’d spend the next few days spoiling the genius and having make-up sex.
Sometime later when he’d cried himself out, Natasha was still there holding him together. Beside him was a mug of specialty brewed tea. Bruce’s contribution no doubt. It was he’s rare tea from the Himalayas that he had limited quantities of. In the kitchen, Clint seemed to be cooking for all of them. He did feel a bit better. Not good but not as bad as he’d been. With his teammates here and their support, he felt like at least he had a match in the dark cave he was trapped in.
Tony seemed to hesitate and Steve could only hope it was to serious consider the question. Finally, Tony opened his mouth, “No Cap, like I said before, we’re over. That text might have been the insighting incident but that doesn’t make this break up any less real.”
Tony took a chug from the bottle this time. Why is he thinking about these things? He was trying to logic out the situation. Trying to understand why he and Steve could no longer be together despite how much he loved Steve. Despite how much Steve loved him, had loved him. He wasn’t going to deny how much Steve had loved him. Steve showed it in everything he did, and Steve wouldn’t lie about his emotions. To deny Steve’s feelings would be doing Steve a grave disservice. To deny Steve’s feelings would be too insulting to Steve, too dishonest and unjust after all he’s done for Tony. But he was also trying to accept that it was only logical that Steve fell out of love with him, or that he would eventually fall out of love with him. He was trying to accept the fact that Steve has finally found something he isn’t willing to give up for love. In this case his own and the safety of the team. How can Tony deny him that? The team was his family too, and if they were at stake, he was willing to sacrifice his relationship with Steve and contain his love for Steve to ensure their safety. Not that any of them would ask that of him ever. Convincing himself was working but he was getting more depressed as well.  He’s tired, he’s so so tired. So finally, he laid down on the couch and let himself rest. He knew sleep would be fretful right now, but it would burn a few hours away with less pain than what he was currently feeling.
Momentous speech complete, Tony marched off the stage, but not before he caught Bucky and Steve’s astonished expressions.
“It’s okay Steve…” He whispers. “You were completely right. This is over, this relationship is done.”
“I’m still not done Steve,” Bruce continues with an apologetic smile. “You also need to realize that this incident has left its mark on you as well. It’s plain to see for everyone here that heard your depressing rant about Tony not wanting you. You have insecurities too Steve, and that’s okay. But you need to recognize them and work past them or those insecurities are going to make it difficult for you two to be together and ultimately hurt you both.”
In the end, he decided that he’d leave the decision to Tony on what he wanted to do with the room. It was the least he could do for Tony. In the mean time, he didn’t want to be more of an imposition than he’d already been, so he went back to his old room and started shucking off his clothe, letting them drop to the floor in the mostly empty room. As he lowered himself to the bed, he looked at the night stand where he’s old phone charger sat. He should probably charge his phone in case SHIELD needed him. Steve reached into his pant pocket and pulled out the phone, plugged it into the charger and turned it back on in case someone called.
“I for one am looking forward to the day when the need to realize you’re gay and the need to ‘come out’ is not something that anyone should have to experience. That’s real equality.”
“Steve,” Bruce budded in, surprising everyone. “I’m sorry I got angry and accused you of hurting Tony. Natasha’s right. I got too into Tony’s problems and forgot that you’re a part of this too, and you’re hurting also. So, I’m going to make it up to you by passing on what Tony has told me.” Bruce paused to gesture to Steve to not interrupt. “It’s not something he told me in confidence and I think he’d want me to tell you given the situations.” Steve hesitantly gave Bruce a nod. “Okay, Tony has told me that he used to sleep better but ever since Afghanistan and then New York, he’s been getting night terrors.”
“JARVIS, Lock Down. No overrides, not even Pepper’s. No one gets in. And not a word about anything related to this or anything about my current state to anyone in the tower. I’m not kidding this time, no using intonations or try to work around my orders in any way this time” Tony stated with all the seriousness he could muster before he lost himself in thought.
“Ah… You’re much looser now that Steve’s fucked ya aren’cha?” He whispered in Tony’s ear as Tony wanton cries filled the room. “But while he’s long, I’m thicker than he is, aren’t I kitten? Which means you’re still so goddamn tight around me.” He panted out still trying to stuff more of his dick into Tony’s hole.
Hey, sorry this update took a while. This part was a bit harder to write than originally anticipated. Anyways hope you guys enjoy it.
“The ones all over the ground!” but even as he yelled with Tony, he was relieved. The man seemed to be energetic and comprehensive and that quenched some of Steve’s worries.
Bucky shot him an incredulous look, “Because I’m bound to this stupid chair right now because of some Asshole.”
Steve did find her words comforting, but he had a hard time believing it right now. He really wanted to talk to Tony, because only then will he know the truth.
“Lord, You look…..Stevie’s right, your purpose in life is to take cock every which way. That’s what gives ya the most delight in this world. This might make me a bad person but I love it. I love how you look like this.  I feel like I’m about to come in my pants from just watching you and nothing else.” Tony met his eyes in response and absolutely keened from the back of his throat with his mouth full of Steve’s dick. Good, Bucky wasn’t going to let Steve show him up when it comes to talking dirty.
“For you Steve. You bring out the best in him. You two bring out the best in each other.” Natasha was looking at him with conviction, and then Clint pulled his attention.
Steve wasted no time and headed down. He knew that knowing Tony, he’d locked himself in the lab to blame and ridicule himself. Steve knew he took too long to get home which definitely wouldn’t have help rev down his self torment.
“Oh, Thank God!” Steve gasped. A darker more insecure part of Tony couldn’t help but think that Steve probably wouldn’t have cared as much if he’d seen Tony just drinking himself to the point of black out, because it wouldn’t have been Steve’s fault then. It would just be Tony being broken, being an alcoholic.
What was he doing? He shouldn’t be blaming Tony. This is all his fault. Tony would, of course, be blaming himself. He always does. Steve should have been more careful. He should have proof-read his messages. God, he was a horrid person with how much he must have hurt Tony. How could he ever make up for this? He can’t. He probably broke all of Tony’s trust. Broke all of his promises to keep Tony from harm. He didn’t deserve Tony. Wasn’t good enough for him. He…
Sighing Natasha tried a different approach. “When Tony has insecurities would you rather he talks to you or us?”
“Okay Tony…. I’m gonna come back later so we can talk about this okay?” He needed to know. To check that that was what Tony meant.
“Yeah he did..” Bruce replied but was mainly focused on Tony’s hand at the moment. It was definitely going to be a 2
All of Steve’s insecurities rushed him at the words. Maybe he really didn’t make Tony happy? Maybe Tony realized he could do better? Maybe this break up was just what Tony was waiting for?
“We’re superheroes Cap” Clint shot him a look like he was stupid which really was pretty offensive considering it came from Clint. “We take hits for each other all the time because we’re teammates and friends and
In light of the courage that Tony showed Steve wanted to give some of that trust back. “I just think. One of these days you’re going to wake up and realize that you can do better.” Steve almost smirked as Tony’s jaw drops. “I know you don’t think so, I know you usually end up waving it off as nothing, but you give so much to us Tony without asking for anything in turn. You’ve provided us with a home and anything we could ever hope for. You spend hours making upgrades for us. It’s not just the money. You always come to spend time with us if anyone had a nightmare. You’re handsome, and a genius and I couldn’t keep up with you on my best day. And I sometimes think, besides being Captain America, what else do I have to offer you?” Steve’s last admission seems to have pulled Tony from his trance.
Tony thinks, trying to be optimistic. Tony doesn’t realize that his knuckles had turned white from how hard he’s holding the tea mug, but he couldn’t let go. This mug of tea may be the last thing Bruce ever does to show that he cared for Tony.
“She told me that peeling the label off of things is the universal sign for being sexually frustrated.”
“I understand Steve. I really do. It’s for the team, right?” and for a second Steve had thought that Tony had got it, got how he was feeling, got how much everyone cared. But then Tony’s expression turned sad as he looked down “It’s for you too.” And Steve realized that something was very wrong.
Bucky and Steve smirked at each other. “Well look at that, not that we needed anymore proof of how slutty Tony is.” Then the calm broke and Steve took his already lubed cock in hand guiding it to Tony’s taunt hole. Tony was definitely looser than he’d been before Bucky had fucked him due to Bucky’s girth and how sloppily he’d bin shoving his cock into Tony but God they were so huge. it’s a wonder how Tony can even take one of them and now they were both going to shove in there. That thought turned Bucky on so much that he was mildly concerned about there being no more blood left for his brain.
degree burn. Dammit. Bruce pushed the mug out of Tony’s reach so it would cooled down more before focusing on Tony again. “How are you holding up? Tell me what happen…” Bruce hesitated before amending. “I’m here if you want to talk about it.” He didn’t want to force Tony into anything. Plus, the last time Tony had tried to talk to him, he’d fallen asleep. In his defense, he’d just finished an all nighter in the lab that he hadn’t told Tony about, because despite his own hours poorly kept hours, Tony was a nag about Bruce getting enough rest. Plus, he’d been away from people for so long, he’d been really rusty at comforting people. Natasha had given him a few tips since then, so he at least felt like he could handle the current situation. However, it would be understandable if Tony wanted to talk to someone else. Thus, Bruce also quickly added “Everyone on the team is here for you if you want to talk about it.” which at least seemed to calm Tony down some.
Tony turned his blank eyes to make eye contact with Steve. “Okay.” Was the only thing he said in response.
As soon as Steve registered the word, he felt a rush of relief. “Oh, Thank God!” But then the hurt in Tony’s eyes turned to anger.
“Clint stop, I trust his judgement. Stop yelling. Look at him.” He must have looked worse then he thought because Clint’s anger immediately deflated into concern. Who knew he cared?
“I..uh.. by remember what you guys just told me?” That didn’t seem to be the answer Natasha was hoping for since her frown darkened so Steve gave it another shot. “Talk to you guys about it?” Steve didn’t really want to bug the team with his problems, but he figures that they were basically offering, and it might help him a lot.
Steve gave a slight nod. “Yeah, he use to do a lot of over the top things just because he thought that’s what I wanted and because he was really paranoid about me breaking up with him.”
Based of the expression on Tony’s face, he looked like he was having a spiritual experience. It looked even better since Tony had dried cum, drool, and lube all over his face. It came as a surprise to Bucky that Tony could speak anything at all.
Steve smiled before feeling even more guilty. Tony was being so sweet despite his terrible behavior this morning. God he deeply regretted saying that Tony was compromising the team. That was a low blow and must have struck Tony right where it hurts, right at the insecurities Steve had always tried to shoo away from Tony’s person. After all, the team was Tony’s family, and he’s pour every bit of himself that he can into the team.
Chugging a fourth of the massive bottle, Tony contemplated while ignoring all of JARVIS’s nagging that he should consider a change in activity. He considered all the times the tabloids accused him of being an alcoholic. He wasn’t in denial, he really wasn’t, but he really didn’t think he was an alcoholic. He might turn to alcohol easily when things go wrong but when things are good he rarely drinks too much or feels the need to drink at all outside of social occasions. He admits there’s definitely dependence there, but he really doesn’t feel like the craved is daily like alcoholics do. He continued to try and contemplate anything other than him and Steve, and eventually his thoughts tapered off as he got more and more drunk.
All Steve could do was point through the glass. Three pairs of eyes turned to where he was pointing. Natasha swore, the only one to remain remotely calm, and made for the override station for the door of the workshop.
Steve hadn’t been scared that he’d be judged. He trusted his team, but her words gave him hope that even if he couldn’t say exactly what he meant, they’d still listen and help and try their best to understand. So, Steve took one more fortifying breath before it all started tumbling from his mouth.
“Steve!” Bucky had shouted to get Steve to open his eyes but it came out more as a moan. He’s voice was low and rough as the words scrapped on their way out his throat, he figured he probably looked as wrecked as Tony did. It had the desired effect though because Steve opened his eyes to look at him and then immediately afterward at Tony. By the next second Steve had pulled Tony off his dick by the scruff of hair on the back of Tony’s head.
Suddenly Tony’s face and eyes shut down and closed off. No, NO! That wasn’t what he wanted, wasn’t what he was trying and failing to tell Tony. He cursed himself for his inadequacies and inability to articulate himself the way Tony could. He wanted to do better. He needed to do better. But as he looked up to try again, Tony’s expression turned loving as he stared into Steve’s eyes.
Tony tried to wait Steve out but really he knew he was delaying the unavoidable, so eventually he spoke again. “Steve you pull me up to be better which means that I drag you down. I can’t be selfish by picking my own happiness over yours. If I had one wish it would be for you to be happy.”
Seeing the reaction Tony was quick to defend Steve. “He didn’t do anything wrong Bruce, honest. He was just trying to watch out for you all and keep the team safe!” Tony looked a bit frantic at the thought of getting Steve into trouble all because he couldn’t seem to get Bruce to see that Tony had been the one at fault. “Bruce calm down! It’s all my fault, I swear!”
Natasha tried to peak at Steve’s face by prying at his hands, but Steve wouldn’t budge. Sighing she continued, “If it makes you feel better, I do think you’re partially at fault here.” Steve finches but is otherwise still. “Just like Tony is partially responsible. You both had the chance to talk it out but you both assumed the worse immediately which always ends with a yelling match between you two that solve nothing and only hurts you both more. You guys need to get a handle on your emotions and talk like adults instead of expressing yourselves like a toddler.” Natasha then patted Steve on the head before continuing, “We’ll work on it when this is over. What happened next Steve?”
Steve didn’t even try to continue with the paperwork by this point. Just waiting for Tony’s reply. When Tony did, it was with 2 sequential texts.
“So, then what did you say?” Natasha gently prompted, and Steve took a moment to appreciate her friendship before continuing.
“Steve don’t you dare wallow in self pity while Tony is suffering. You need to go fix it!” Which just caused Steve to roll into another round of sobs. Natasha whipped her head around to glare at Bruce, fearless of the Hulk.
And Tony knew that, he really did but… he just saw the bomb and didn’t think, just acted. He knows that Steve can handle himself but in that moment all he could think about was how much Osborn had bragged about the capabilities of this new bomb and when he saw it going toward Steve, his body moved on its own.
“Because Tony’s been through so much. He has a right to be protective of his heart. I’m just being unreasonable.” Steve concluded and who could argue that that wasn’t true?
“I….” Steve took a deep breath, this was important. Besides, it doesn’t look like he’s going to get to Tony without an explanation. “It was supposed to say, ‘I’m leaving now’” and as much as Steve doesn’t want to be beaten to a pulp by the hulk, he felt like he probably deserved it for being so careless.
“Steve. Be nice.” Tony’s voice was small but clear. He looked up at Steve from his place on his lap where he’d slipped to when Steve sat up. Tony made no move to get off of Steve’s lap though.
Steve made a face at the word bae but then almost smiled. Tony had told him it’s what all the kids are using these ways. His expression turned fond. Only Tony would send such a concerned text after Steve yelled at him while pushing him away because Tony Had Tried To Save Steve’s Life! He felt terrible. He wanted to go home and hold Tony and apologize and kiss him all over.
“That’s one of the things we love the most about you sweetie.” Bucky added. Steve nodded in agreement.
It took a second but Tony got what Steve was implying. “With my mouth. I can with…” he breath eagerly trying to lift his head up.
them to talk when Tony felt better. He wanted Tony to know he couldn’t get away without having their conversation no matter how long he prolongs it. It was Steve’s way of making sure that Tony would come to him when he was feeling better on his own, because if he didn’t, Steve would come find him. He tried to let Tony know that Tony wasn’t alone, even if at the end this didn’t work out in Steve’s favor and they broke up. He has Steve. He’ll always have Steve.
Glossy eyes turned to him with no comprehension in them, but slowly Tony seemed to recognize him. That recognition turned to hurt fast as Tony started to try and push him off with weak floppy arms.
He knew that Steve and he used to be friends, best friends, and just because they weren’t together anymore doesn’t mean that Tony and he weren’t still friends, still teammates. They’d promised each other at the start of this that no matter what happens in the relationship, it wasn’t going to cause them to lose their friendship, lose each other in the end. And just because they weren’t together anymore doesn’t mean that Tony doesn’t love him anymore.
“I’m not the one you need to convince Steve. Convince Tony. He’s just had all his insecurities confirmed. It won’t be as easy as shoving his insecurities all back in a box again. It’s gonna take time to herd all the insecurities back and that will take determintion and dedication. Are you really okay with starting back at square one again?”
“That’s not true…” Steve replied so quickly that Bruce realized that it must be an automatic response for whenever Tony talked bad about himself. He smiles, feeling a lot better knowing that despite what had happened, Steve cares about Tony deeply and doesn’t for a second think that the things Tony says about himself are true. None the less he lifts his hand to silence Steve.
As Steve talked Tony seemed to go through a variety of stages disbelief, confusion, shock, hope. Steve honestly though he’d stop at anger and Tony was about to start yelling at him any second now but was surprised and mortified when anger turned to hopelessness, resignations, devastation and then nothing. It was like Tony’s face had shut off which was not a good sign. It made fear envelope Steve.
He made a quick reply and really tried to focus on his paper work so that he could get to leave soon. Tony’s text had sent urgency through him. Before he got more than a sentence further though, he’s phone chimed again.
Steve was in the common room looking out of the tower at central park, looking at the dots of couples and children enjoying the nice day. He didn’t know what else to do with himself. He didn’t feel like doing anything else anyways. Behind him the elevator doors open, and he hears 3 sets of foot steps.
“God Damn It Steve!” Bucky did look to Steve then struggling against the bindings again. “Unbind me you bastard!”
Behind him Dr Banner looked concerned too as he walked up for a better look. Then all he could see was red hair. “Steve, you look terrible.”
Bruce didn’t see but he’s quip did give Tony a small smile before he remembered that he’d been getting plenty of hydration lately due to Steve. He took a gulp from the tea mug to try and stifle down another round of sobs. Bruce was trying to help. The least he could do is talk to Bruce. Despite trying, it took him another 10 or so minutes to calm down enough to get understandable words out. “You can’t fix this Bruce. Steve and I are over..
